They added that the situation was mainly caused by a lane closure on site and roadworks taking place nearby and that they have undertaken an 'in depth review' on their parking operation to make improvements going forward.\nPaul, who shared pictures of queues of cars waiting to exit the car park on Sunday, said: \"It was a sell out crowd for the women's game. There was one lane open out of a packed free blue car park.\n\"There were people in long queues filtering into the one lane. The game had finished well over an hour ago. There was no-one obvious from the club controlling traffic flow. Utter shambles.\n\"It appears main exit road was shut as heavy machinery was on it, so cars were leaving though one gate near the main road, where there are also traffic lights.\"\nHe claimed 'hundreds' were stuck in the large car park and shared a number of pictures to social media showing the extent of the queues.\nA spokesperson for Manchester City said: “We are committed to creating the best possible matchday experience for our fans, meaning we are disappointed by the extended wait times when leaving yesterday’s sell-out match and we wish to apologise to all those impacted.\n\"The situation was largely caused by a lane closure on site, further impacted by a signalling issue and roadworks taking place on several surrounding roads.\n\"To reduce wait times in the future, we have undertaken an in-depth review of our free parking operation with internal and external stakeholders and have identified a series of measures to improve the flow of cars which we will introduce ahead of this week’s match.”",
