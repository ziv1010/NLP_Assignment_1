Specht’s work boosting her brand and image for profit through social media posts, when she’s not studying or playing ball, is a part of the new normal for student-athletes and their colleges and universities.\nSince June 2021, the NCAA, the governing body of college sports in the U.S., has allowed college athletes to earn money by marketing their own names and images through a policy known as Name, Image and Likeness, or NIL.\n“I feel like NIL has been huge for athletes to profit off of and to earn a paycheck and a personal brand,” Specht said. “It’s helped me make a name for myself. I’ve met a bunch of female basketball players that I might have met from being active on social media.”\nThe introduction over the past few years of NIL and the transfer portal into college sports revolutionized and confused the landscape of the industry even for those walking the terrain every day — among them athletes and administrators.\nTo help other Northern Colorado athletes identify money-making opportunities like Specht has found, the UNC athletic department recently announced the launch of two NIL initiatives.\nThe Bear Pride Collective and the Northern Vision Exchange will connect UNC student-athletes with businesses, fans, donors and alumni for partnerships with the purpose of financial compensation for the student-athletes.\nThe athletes’ ability to now earn money to supplement any scholarship funding is at the heart of the Name, Image and Likeness policy.\n“It’s giving student-athletes the opportunity to generate revenue outside of scholarships,” UNC athletic director Darren Dunn said. “They are allowed to generate revenue for themselves as long as they do something in return.”\nThe NCAA for a long time said some college athletes couldn’t be paid or receive compensation because of concerns over amateur status, a policy that generally included NIL money. However, the rules were inconsistently enforced and much debated.\nThe discussion surrounding paying players grew with a 2009 lawsuit filed against the NCAA by former UCLA men’s basketball player Ed O’Bannon. Ultimately, O’Bannon’s suit and his victory paved the way for the NIL policy adopted by the NCAA two years ago.\nO’Bannon, who led the Bruins to the NCAA title in 1995, said as the plaintiff that the NCAA’s amateurism rules that prevented student-athletes from being compensated for the use of their names, images and likenesses constituted an illegal restraint of trade, according to the legal information website Justia.com\nO’Bannon filed suit against the NCAA and the Collegiate Licensing Company — the company contracted to administer the domestic and international licensing programs for the NCAA — alleging the NCAA’s amateurism rules, insofar as they prevented student-athletes from being compensated for the use of their NILs, were an illegal restraint of trade under the Sherman Antitrust Act.\nA three-judge panel with a U.S. Court of Appeals in 2015 ruled in favor of O’Bannon, saying a ban on student-athlete compensation was a violation of federal antitrust law, according to the University of Baltimore Law Review in March 2017. A year before the appeals court ruling, a district court judge backed O’Bannon’s suit under the Sherman Act.Colleges and universities now have limited powers on behalf of student-athletes in the NIL realm, according to NCAA rules. Dunn said universities can help guide student-athletes, but the institutions can’t get involved with discussions or negotiations on transactions.\nUNC’s general counsel may be involved as an advisor on NIL matters, according to associate athletic director for strategic communications Dennis Driscoll. NIL laws are different from state to state. Universities have to know and be aware of laws and regulations on NIL within athletic leagues or conferences, within the NCAA and the state.\n“We can help guide the student-athletes but we can’t get into the discussions,” Dunn said. “It’s evolving and changing, and there’s not a lot of clear direction from the NCAA.”\nBear Pride Collective, Northern Vision Exchange\nThe Bear Pride Collective works through a third-party organization to facilitate NIL opportunities or transactions between UNC student-athletes and fans, donors and businesses, according to a news release from the university.\nAbout 85% of each donation goes to the student-athlete, according to the Bear Pride Collective website, bearpridecollective.com.\nThe organization behind Bear Pride Collective is an Atlanta-based company called Student Athlete NIL (SANIL). The agency’s website says it’s “dedicated to helping brands, universities and most importantly student-athletes, navigate the new era of Name, Image and Likeness.”\nUNC’s news release said Student Athlete NIL is not officially affiliated with the athletic department. The agency is acknowledged by UNC athletics and will function within rules handed down by the NCAA, the Big Sky Conference and the state of Colorado.\nThe Bear Pride Collective is the collective recommended by UNC to support its student-athletes.\n“The purpose is there are a lot of people who want to help student-athletes, and they don’t know how and maybe don’t have the time to determine how,” Dunn said.\nIf, for example, a donor wants to help the UNC women’s basketball program with $10,000, the money goes into the collective and it works with the team or player to do something in return.\nDunn said this is a theme of the affiliations with Bear Pride Collective and Northern Vision Exchange initiatives. The student-athletes don’t get money for nothing. They have to give something in return as part of the business partnership.\nThe student-athlete can participate in a variety of activities to earn the money, such as making a personal appearance, charitable work, speaking engagements or receiving a commercial sponsorship through the collective.\n“It could be making an appearance or it could be a player doing social media posts (on behalf of a business),” Dunn said. “The student-athletes have to do something in return to promote the entity.”\nThe Northern Vision Exchange is an operating system where companies and fans may identify students to engage in a business transaction.\nThe idea with the exchange is a business, a collective or individual registers on a database. Through the database, they may search UNC student-athletes using a variety of criteria.\nThe interested party may then message the student-athlete directly or request contact information to start a discussion about an NIL opportunity.\nA company named INFLCR — pronounced influencer — runs the exchange operating system. Dunn said neither INFLCR nor UNC will be involved in the negotiations between the interested parties and the student-athletes.\nUNC is working with INFLCR through a contract with the Big Sky Conference, Dunn said. Each member school pays the conference to set up a working agreement for INFLCR, he continued. Dunn also said the university pays a variety of fees to the conference at the end of each year.\n“The INFLCR agreement is with the Big Sky Conference and as part of our membership dues and fees, the conference office pays for this agreement and their services,” UNC athletics said in a statement. “The costs for the Northern Vision Exchange is covered by the conference office. The Big Sky Conference does not publicly share details of their agreements for proprietary reasons.”\nUNC does not pay the Bear Pride Collective. Dunn emphasized Bear Pride Collective and SANIL are separate from UNC. Dunn said Student Athlete NIL charges a fee to the donor based on the donation to the collective.\nDunn said the athletic department heard from student-athletes and businesses on how it’s difficult to forge a connection for an NIL deal.\n“So this is a solution for the businesses and student-athletes to give them a chance to come together more easily,” he added.\nNIL requires time and effort: ‘It’s a job’\nSpecht signed to play at Idaho State coming out of high school in Folsom, California. She opted for a redshirt year with the Bengals, meaning she did not play as a freshman. Specht transferred to UNC following her freshman year, and she’s in her second season with the Bears.\nThe NCAA’s Name, Image and Likeness policy went into effect between Specht’s senior year of high school and freshman year of college. She said she decided then to invest in herself and post content on Instagram and TikTok.\nSpecht said she was a regular and consistent poster over the next three months and gained more than 100,000 followers combined on both platforms.\nSpecht’s growing social media was noticed by small brands and she earned approximately $300-$400 per post. She eventually heard from a Los Angeles-area-based music and talent management firm called MISSMANAGEDLA, which represents select artists and top-tier digital content creators.\nMISSMANAGED representatives wanted to help Specht with NIL opportunities. One of the bigger deals Specht received through this relationship came while working with Amazon on a six-month contract.\nThe contract awarded Specht a five-figure total for one feed post per month on Instagram promoting different Amazon products geared to college students. Specht declined to offer the specific amount of the contract.\nAs part of the contract, Specht had to agree to do a post about the products. She chose the products she wanted to try and Amazon sent those to her for free.\nSpecht with other NIL deals, brands or companies will send a product and the athlete does not have to post about the item.\nAmong the products Specht received was an Amazon Echo Dot, a smart speaker that connects to devices and acts as an intercom, and back-to-school items such as a backpack, pencils, beauty supplies, hair ties and face wash.\n“I felt comfortable with Amazon because I had a familiarity with what was being sent,” Specht said. “That is one of the big things about being an influencer marketer. Your followers want you to be trustworthy. I like to be honest, and I wouldn’t post about something that I didn’t like.”\nSpecht currently has almost 80,000 followers on Instagram and about 30,000 on TikTok.\nDunn said the athletic department plans to brief and educate Bears student-athletes about Bear Pride Collective and Northern Vision Exchange during the spring semester.\nSpecht said the introduction of the Bear Pride Collective and Northern Vision Exchange should increase student athletes’ access to NIL opportunities. Specht said she doesn’t think access is “super high” now for her fellow student-athletes.\nFinding deals and connections requires a lot of work, which Specht said she focused on during her redshirt year at Idaho State and later while recovering from an injury. She said it’s difficult to have time for NIL while in season with basketball.\n“It’s a job, and if you want to make the most of it, you have to put in the time and effort,” Specht said.\nThe time and effort for NIL have a significant payoff for one group of athletes, Specht said, and those rewards extend beyond the dollars and sense.\nSpecht said NIL opportunities are particularly beneficial for female athletes. There are financial benefits, but there is also increased exposure and a higher awareness of women’s sports. Specht said it’s important to her for light to shine on female athletes, and NIL allows for this.\nLSU women’s basketball player Angel Reese was the most outstanding player of the Final Four last spring when the Tigers won their first championship. Reese’s star power has taken off since, and now she’s estimated to have one of the highest NIL values in college sports.\nOn3, a media site on college sports and NIL, reports Reese’s value at $1.7 million. Iowa guard Caitlin Clark, whose team lost to Reese and LSU in the national championship game, has an estimated NIL value of $783,000, according to On3, and she recently signed a multi-year deal with Gatorade.\nSpecht mentioned LSU gymnast Olivia Dunne as another female athlete reaping the benefits of NIL. On3 earlier this year reported Dunne is the highest-earning female athlete in college sports with a valuation estimated at $3.5 million.\nSpecht has worked with the dating app Bumble. With Bumble, women are required to make the first move, which it says shifts the old-fashioned power dynamics and encourages equality.\nSpecht said she likes to align with a brand making a point to promote female athletes and women.\n“There are a lot of female athletes, and it’s amazing to see them getting paid for their athletic ability,” Specht said. “They’re getting deals because of how talented they are and they’re being rewarded.”",
