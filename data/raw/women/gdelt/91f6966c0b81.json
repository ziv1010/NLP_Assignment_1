  "body_text": "Chloe Mustaki believes that the Ireland team can give Australia ‘hell’ in their World Cup opener against the co-hosts in Sydney this Thursday.\nIt will be confirmed today whether Denise O’Sullivan, Ireland’s creative force in midfield, will be deemed fit enough to play in the opening Group B game – following her agonising shin injury against Colombia that caused the behind-closeddoors warm-up game to be abandoned.\nThe Matildas’ impressive 1-0 win over France on the same night underlined the scale of the task which faces Vera Pauw’s side on Thursday.\nHowever, Bristol City defender Mustaki, who recently signed a contract extension with the newly promoted WSL club, feels that Irish teams thrive in these situations, when all the odds are stacked against them.\n‘At the end of the day, we relish being the underdogs,’ Mustaki said.\n‘We are going to give them hell as much as we can and hopefully, come out with the right result.\n‘We are not here just to participate. We have got a hell of a squad and we are going to prepare as best we can coming into this game and see what the outcome is.\n‘Of course, they are the home nation, they will have massive support.\n‘It is going to be a battle but we will be ready for it and we love being the underdogs.’\nThere will be plenty of Irish fans among the 82,000 in Stadium Australia this Thursday, given the large community of expats that are living in this country.\nNone of the Ireland players have ever played in front of a crowd that big, while the biggest attendance Mustaki has played in front is 14,000 in Gothenburg, when the team drew a qualifier 1-1 with Sweden in April 2022.\n‘I don’t think I have an idea of how insane it is going to be. I am trying not to think about it too much, trying just to concentrate on the football. At the end of the day, when you walk onto the pitch, everything around you just fades away.\n‘So, if we can just concentrate and focus and stay connected on the game, whoever is playing on that pitch, hopefully we can come out with the result, as I said. It will be surreal, and we won’t really believe it until we see it, because it is something that only Katie and a few others have experienced and we might never experience it again, that amount of people, so we have to savour it,’ she said.\n‘The Sweden game was the biggest crowd I played in front of, 12 or 14,000. But most of us play fulltime and we are used to playing under pressure.\n‘Obviously, it will be to a different magnitude in Sydney but once you cross the white line, you forget about everything else.\n‘Hopefully that will be the case on Thursday.’ Mustaki – whose mother flew out at the weekend and her brother who lives in Melbourne is coming to the game – is one of the wonderful personal stories in this Irish team, having recovered from Hodgkin’s lymphoma in her teens and also battled back from a badly-ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) to be part of the World Cup squad.\n‘I think it is starting to sink in now we are here in Australia,’ she said. ‘A few weeks leading up in Ireland, it still felt a bit of a far-fetched idea that we were heading to a World Cup, but I think touching down in Australia now, being in Brisbane and having the buzz around, it is fantastic and it feels like we are a part of something special,’ she said.",
