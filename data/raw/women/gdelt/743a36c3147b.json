The rise has been driven by changes in search engine algorithms and shifting online habits among Generation Z users.\nThe online discussion site now reaches 60% of UK internet users, up from 33% in 2023. A report links this sharp growth to updates in Google’s search system, which increasingly promotes useful content from online discussion forums in its search results.\nGoogle and Reddit partnership\nA key reason for this rise is Reddit’s relationship with Google. The search giant uses Reddit data to help train its artificial intelligence (AI) models, and Reddit is currently the most frequently cited source in Google’s AI-generated search summaries. This has resulted in a significant increase in traffic being directed to Reddit forums.\nReddit also has a similar agreement with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. This partnership helps ensure Reddit content remains visible to people searching for information online.\nThe Gen Z effect\nReddit believes changing online behaviour is also boosting its growth, particularly among younger users who are looking for real, human opinions rather than polished content. This trend is strongest among those aged 18 to 24, with more than three-quarters of that group now visiting the site.\nThe company is now the sixth most visited organisation of any kind for UK users aged 18 to 24, compared with 10th place a year ago. More than three-quarters of people in this age group now use the platform.\nIn the UK, more than half of Reddit’s audience is female. Data shows that 71% of women on Reddit in the UK have a personal interest in skincare, beauty and cosmetics. This has led to increased activity on UK-based subreddits (topic-focused community within Reddit) focused on these topics.\nSimilarly, subreddits related to pregnancy and parenting in the UK have doubled in size over the past year.\nReddit’s changing image\nJen Wong, Reddit’s chief operating officer, told The Guardian that the platform’s audience has become much more diverse.\n“Reddit started with this perception, rightfully so, for a male skew – gaming and tech as the anchor. Reddit has become very diverse – it is gender-balanced in the UK now … what’s interesting is that one in three are Gen Z women on the platform,” said Wonf\nYounger users are increasingly turning to Reddit for advice during major life moments, Wong added.\n“Gen Z are very open to looking online for advice around these life stage moments, like leaving home and renting for the first time, which happens a little bit later for some of this generation. It’s a very safe place to ask questions about balancing a cheque book, or how to pay for a wedding.”\nReddit vs AI slop\nWong also told The Guardian that Reddit wants users to visit the platform directly, rather than arriving through search results. She described Reddit as an alternative to AI-generated content.\n“You see these accidents of AI slop and AI advice – Reddit doesn’t have that,” she said. “It’s not clean. It’s messy, in that it has lots of different pieces of advice that you have to sift through. It’s not manicured down to one answer for you, but that’s kind of the point.”\nSport and live discussions on Reddit\nReddit is also becoming a popular space for sports fans. Many supporters of Premier League clubs now watch matches while actively using their team’s subreddit.\nAccording to company data, the Premier League subreddit has recorded more than a billion additional views over the past year.\nThe platform is also emerging as an important space for women’s football discussions, which often receive less media coverage than the men’s game. Views of subreddits dedicated to Arsenal Women and the England Lionesses have doubled in the past year.\nThe online discussion site now reaches 60% of UK internet users, up from 33% in 2023.
