We lost that match, and the missed strike taught me a lot of things. It taught me never to take your opponent lightly, as we did since we had defeated them four years ago. The miss also prepared me mentally for the 1996 Olympics and I feel I could score in the final because I was not taking my opponents (Spain) lightly then,” Bovelander, 58, told TOI on Thursday. The Dutch hero was in the city to announce his association with Rotary Pune Sports City's expansion programme.\nThe Netherlands penalty corner specialist has been spending time in India and is helping various academies and organisations develop programmes for grassroots hockey, something he feels can help Indian hockey in the long run. Bovelander feels Indian hockey has revived again, unlike their former fierce rivals Pakistan. And he credits the Hockey India League (HIL) for the turnaround.\n“I think India faced a big problem after the 80s and 90s when the game changed, and they did not adapt quickly. Fortunately, they came back, and I think the change started when the HIL started. Because of the league, there were more coaching courses and there was a good high-performance programme as well for the national teams. And then when the results were positive, there was more interest. So, winning the bronze medal and having the women’s team finish 4th at the Tokyo Olympics has been a big boost.”\nBovelander, however, doesn’t have similar things to say about Pakistan.\n“Decline of Pakistan hockey has hurt the sport at the world level. If the economics are good, it’s easier for sports as well. But it is important that the traditional (hockey playing) nations like India and Pakistan are at the top, at least participating,” said the man who spent his entire 15-year career playing for only one Dutch club - Bloemendaal.\nHaving followed Indian hockey, Bovelander agreed that the men’s team is relying on their top goalkeeper Sreejesh PR a lot. However, he feels it is difficult to find a substitute for the best. “With goalies, it is always tricky because you have just one spot. It’s difficult to ignore the best even if you want to plan long-term. India relies on him, but that’s what it is. You always rely on a couple of players, and he will be replaced one day,” he said.\nHockey has gone through a lot of rule changes, but the same can’t be said for football. “(Slightly joking) I think football is a boring game. Not much has changed in the sport, there are some rules that need to be changed I feel. The stoppage time is too random, they can start using a shot clock. But the fact is, billions of people watch football despite that. How many watch hockey?”\nHe felt hockey is too fast for TV and the authorities need to work on the speed of the ball. “Football is far slower in comparison but it is easy to follow. Hockey is too technical and has too many rules.”\nBovelander said the sport was not just about winning titles and attaining excellence. “It also teaches life skills and builds character.”\nEnd of Article\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",
