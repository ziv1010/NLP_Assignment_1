As such he realized that the conservative approach was correct. He created the meme of #WalkAway on Twitter and it blew up, going viral as other Democrats started joining in, agreeing they were offended by what was being said and done in their name, using the strengths of their numbers, so they, too, agreed they were going to walk away. (See Antifa, Brandon Straka, Democratic Party, Socialism).\n- $4.9 billion in government subsidies (#207) The amount Elon Musk's three companies were given in government subsidies: Tesla, SpaceX & SolarCity, Elon Musk's growing empire is fueled by $4.9 billion in government subsidies.\n- [ ]; (#680) Kill Box, Q’s answer to an anon’s query about meaning to Drop #676, but not always, sometimes used to indicate letters to connect with other letters within a drop, I.e. [C], [I], [A] (#144) or [p], [r], [a]. [y] (#128), when such letters are buried in other words.\n- —-23: (#1319) This cryptic post’s meaning was finally semi-revealed after Q’s new Trip Code was revealed in Drop #1422 where Q posted an Anon’s capture of his latest Drop with the new Trip Code: \"NowC@mesTHEP@in—-23\". However, the significance of the \"M dash, dash, 23\" is still in question.\n- One suggestion is it refers to the last to numbers of Executive Order 13823 Protecting America Through Lawful Detention of Terrorists which was signed by President Trump on January 13, 2018. (Thanks to FreeQs Bagster and ransomnote). This turned out to be red herring as Q’s new Trip Code is actually !CbboFOtcZs as displayed in subsequent drops. Q posted the name of the new campaign as a Trip Code password in the clear deliberately per drop #1430 “We exposed the password [#91 (#1430)] on purpose [23].”.\n- Another is that it represents the number of days until the North Korea summit meeting on June 12th.

This comports to the subject of the Haiti Relief abductions.\n- Some are interpreting the plusses to mean missing words and are filling in the blanks as “and a child” based on earlier reports from the New York Police Department finding a video on Anthony Weiner’s laptop showing Hillary Clinton performing oral sex on a female child and then demanding the child do the same for her. This is supported by Q including “(raw vid 5:5)” immediately after the series of blank plusses. (See Clinton Foundation.\n- 17 intelligence organizations (INFO) The seventeen intelligence agencies operated by the United States government in its various departments and agencies that were mentioned by the Obama administration as having determined that the Russians had compromised the 2016 election although it actually became clear later that only three or four had actually made such a claim. Some of these are large, independent agencies, such as the FBI, CIA and NSA. Others are smaller offices within Departments or agencies whose main focus is not truly intelligence, such the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research or the Treasury’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis. Four out of the 17 were involved in the January 2017 assessment about Russia: CIA, FBI, NSA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which is an umbrella agency that oversees all 17 organizations. The seventeen are as follows:\n- Central Intelligence Agency.\n- Defense Intelligence Agency.\n- Department of Energy Intelligence and Research.\n- Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Intelligence and Research.\n- Department of State. Bureau of Intelligence and Research.\n- Department Treasury Department’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\n- Drug Enforcement Administration.\n- Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n- National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.\n- National Reconnaissance Office.\n- National Security Agency,\n- Navy Intelligence.\n- Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n- U.S. Air Force Intelligence.\n- U.S. Army Intelligence.\n- U.S. Coast Guard Intelligence.\n- U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence.\n- 187: (#121) Murder, homicide code in most jurisdictions\n- 187_Site_E: (#1001) Little Saint James Island, also referred to as Epstein's Island, or Pedo Island Translate this as \"Kill_Site_E\" in the file name of the Image of Epstein’s Island, being described by Q as a Killing Site.\nLittle Saint James Island, or \"Pedo Island\"\n(See 187, Epstein Island).\n(Thanks to FreeQ TXnMA for catching this obscure gem in the file name and for the new graphic!). - 1/14/2014: (#835) President Obama delivers a speech at the Department of Justice in Washington, DC, to announce the outcomes of a review performed by John Podesta (really?) of our intelligence programs and phone surveillance.

Sister is Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube. 23andMe is important as it adds DNA data to Google, YouTube, big data conglomerate. (See CEO Anne Wojcicki, Sergey Brin, Google, Alphabet, YouTube.)\n- 302s: (#1442) A FD-302 form is used by FBI agents to \"report or summarize the interviews that they conduct\" and contains information from the notes taken during the interview by the non-interviewing agent (there are always at least two agents present, one to interview and one to take notes). It consists of information taken from the subject, rather than details about the subject themselves. A forms list from an internal FBI Website lists the FD-302 as “Form for Reporting Information That May Become Testimony.” The use of the FD-302 has been criticized as a form of institutionalized perjury due to FBI guidelines that actually prohibit audio and video recordings of interviews. Prominent defense lawyers and former FBI agents have stated that they believe that the method of interviewing by the FBI is designed to expose interviewees to potential perjury or false statement criminal charges when the interviewee is deposed in a grand jury and has to contradict the official record presented by the FBI. They have also stated that perjury by FBI agents allows the FBI to use the leverage of a potential criminal charge to turn an innocent witness into an informant. In some cases, it is disagreement with what was recorded as being said by FBI agents’ on one Form FD-302 and a later Form FD-302 memorializing two separate encounters that results in felony charges of “Lying to the FBI” that have entangled people involved in the Russia/Trump probe. (See FBI General Michael Flynn, MF, Joe Pientka, Peter Strzok, PS, Sally Yates).\n- 470 Investigators: (#1553) Possibly the 470th Military Intelligence Brigade. The article being cited says “. . .Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who is working with Huber, has a staff of 470 investigators, giving Huber access to enormous investigative firepower that far exceeds the staff of any special counsel.” The phrase “470 investigators” may not mean four hundred-seventy investigators but rather mean investigators from the 470th Military Intelligence Brigade, if Sessions were treating the statements as literally true and making it part of some misdirection. As research by FreeQ Disestablishmentarian discovered, such a connection would certainly tie Q’s information about Military Tribunals and the Q operation itself to Military Intelligence. (Credit to FreeQ Future Useless Eater for finding the 470th data). (See CIGIE, Inspector General Michael Horowitz, US Attorney John Huber)\n- [666}: (#666) The dollar drop in the DOW industrial average on day after the State of The Union Speech.

It was the first derivative of the baseline Airbus A320 aircraft, and carries up to 236 passengers with a maximum range of 3,200 nmi (5,900 km; 3,700 mi).\n- ABC agencies/depts: (#1806, #1910) A government, inside the beltway slang reference to the alphabetic acronymmically referred to Intelligence agencies such as the ATFE, CIA, DNI, FBI, NSA, etc.\n- ABC News: (#1515) American Broadcasting Network whose news department, according to Wikileaks, was one of thirty-three news organizations which colluded with Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC in the 2016 elections. Six reporters/editors were named as involved. (See Cecilia Vega, David Muir, Diane Sawyer, George Stephanoplous, Hillary Clinton, Jon Karl, and Liz Kreutz).\n- Abedin, Huma: (#2, #3, #6, #8, #15, #38, #45, #56, #68, #485, #921, #1235, #1250, #1360, #1515, #1516, #1977, #1980) Huma Mahmood Abedin is a Democratic American political staffer who was vice chair of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign for President of the United States. Prior to that, Abedin was deputy chief of staff to Clinton, who was U.S. Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. Abedin was also the traveling chief of staff and former assistant for Clinton during Clinton's campaign for the Democratic nomination in the 2008 presidential election. Some say that Abadin was Hillary Clonton's political Handler, the person who controlled her.\nAbedin, a Muslim, has close ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. (Huma’s mother, Saleha Abedin, sits on the Presidency Staff Council of the International Islamic Council for Da’wa and Relief, a group that is chaired by the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi\nHer mother was also Editor in Chief of Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs, a pro-Sharia law magazine, for which Huma was a columnist and reporter during her time at the White House. Her father, Syed Zaynul Abedin, is an Indian born Muslim, who became a professor in Saudi Arabia who founded the Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs, an institution established by the Government of Saudi Arabia with the support of the Muslim World League which was “perhaps the most significant Muslim Brotherhood organization in the world,” according to former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy. Its then-General Secretary, Umar Nasif, founded the Rabita Trust, “which is formally designated as a foreign terrorist organization under American law due to its support of al Qaeda.” That is not guilt by association but what federal prosecutors would call a “nexus” of like-minded people who shared the same goals. Muslim Brotherhood goals.\nAbedin married Anthony Weiner, who was then a U.S. Representative from New York. Weiner resigned from Congress in June 2011 after an incident in which a sexually suggestive photo that he sent to an adult woman via Twitter was captured and publicized. He later tweeted photos of his genitals to an underage girl and was arrested. Wiener is now serving a prison sentence for that crime.\nHillary Clinton's email server seems to have been mirrored to Abedin's Apple MacBook Pro laptop and then to her husband's laptop where over three hundred thousand supposedly erased and acid washed emails from the server were discovered by the New York Police Department in a folder of files named \"insurance,\" when Wiener's laptop was seized as evidence in a child porn and abuse criminal case. Reports about the contents of the \"insurance\" files say they included salacious photos of Hillary Clinton and Abadin, along with \"others\" (not suitable for this forum) that left veteran detectives \"sick and shaken.\" Abedin's own MacBook Pro was destroyed by the FBI for some unexplained reason, according to then FBI Director James Comey, after Abedin turned it over to them for examination as part of her non-questioning in the Clinton email \"matter\".\nRumors abound about Abadin's real relationship with Hillary Clinton with salacious hints about a sexual nature leading the pack. Apparently Huma Abedin accompanied both Clintons on at least one visit to Little Saint Charles Island. (See Handler, Anthony Weiner, Apple, former FBI Director James Comey, Epstein Island, FBI, Hillary Clinton, Muslim Brotherhood, NYPD, email Server). - Abraham Lincoln: 16th President of the United States. For more complete information, please see the Lincoln, Abraham LexiQon entry.\n- ACLU: (INFO) American Civil Liberties Union is a Civil Rights watch dog group that seems to only watch for Rights that matter to leftists and progressives. For example, this organization seldom supports the 2nd Amendment Right to keep and bear arms, or to support the Right of persons to speak on conservative issues.\nRecently members of the ACLU were exposed participating in organized efforts to censor conservative thought and discussion on Reddit when that they acted in concert with Gary Phillips' \"BanOut2018\" cabal to deliberately sabotage conservative social media SubReddit topics by posting abusive, non-compliant rule breaking posts that would eventually get the topic banned from Reddit by \"Trolling\" the Pro-Trump threads with the purpose of getting them shut down. According to top Reddit Moderators, in an article in BigLeaguePolitics the ACLU members, along with members of Media Matters, under the direction of Phillips, a CBS employee in charge of Digital Media in LA, coordinated attacks on multiple SubReddits to deny people their free speech rights thus censoring conservative discussion and thought. In addition, the ACLU has been remarkably silent in the Alex Jones bannishment from social media case, likely in part from similar coordinated efforts from the media.

Akhmetshin has connections with another prominent figure in the Trump Russia collusion story, Russian Lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.\nBoth Akhmetshin and Veselnitskaya are registered lobbyists and although most people are under the impression that only Veselnitskaya attended the Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort. However, that is not the case, she was accompanied by Rinat Akhmetshin. Both were involved in the meeting that was set up to inform the Trump campaign that Hillary Clinton's campaign was receiving illegal campaign donations from foreign sources, notably Russia, but in actual fact, the two just started lobbying for repeal of the Magnitsky Act. The Trump team quickly ended to meeting.\nWe now know that Veselnitskaya had a meeting with Glenn Simpson, founder and President of FusionGPS (the company hired by the DNC's legal representatives Perkins Coie LLC) both before and after the Trump Tower meeting. We also now know that Akhmetshin and Veselnitskaya associated with FusionGPS, who also was Christopher Steele's employer for the purpose of creating the Trump/Russia Dossier. Another employee of FusionGPS brought into the mix is Nellie Ohr, wife of Bruce Ohr, making a nice cabal of planners to embroil the Trump campaign into a made-up Russian collusion story. The connections are too pat to not be a reasonable conclusion.

However, before the first Drop data base rebuild, that signature had been “Alicein Wonderland”. - In Q Drop #83, nine drops after asserting that Q is Alice, Q strongly equates Alice with Hillary Clinton. This is later confirmed in Drops #2048 & #2049 where Q states that “HRC = Alice”\n“SA = Wonderland”\nthen asks Q asks\n“WHO ARE THE WHITE RABBITS?”\n- Q states categorically in Drop Q #74 that “Q = Alice”.\n- Alice \"&\" Wonderland: (#74) Q’s original signature, In Q Drop #74 “Alice = Q.\" Q changed his signature of \"Alice in Wonderland\" to \"Alice & Wonderland\" at the last rebuild of the entire drop database, (I just noticed it while in a Freepmail discussion with FreeQ slag) and also changed this drop to show that Q was indeed Alice, and to alter the original \"in\" to \"&\" and to let all Autists know that it has important meaning. My interpretation is this is a sign that, like Alice in Wonderland, Q is the ultimate outsider. . . and that Q is Trump!\nThink about Saudi Arabia in terms of the queen of heart’s garden in Wonderland where the subjects are painting the roses red. All of that country is an artificial garden, a \"bloody wonderland\", built on blood money. Ultramodern buildings in fanciful shapes, marinas ditto, million dollar cars abandoned to buy more million dollar cars? It’s ALL whimsically painting the roses red. . . Because they can. The same satire of haughty waste seen and shown by Lewis Carroll in the ultra rich British Empire. Remember the caucus race in Alice in Wonderland?

The Antifa movement has been referred to as the “Violent Paramilitary Wing of the Democratic Party of America.” The symbology of the modern Antifascist movement parallels the symbology of both the 1930s and 1940s communist anti-fascists and ironically, the Nazi fascist themselves.\nAntifa March Flag 2017 (Left) —\nWWII NAZI Naval Ensign War Flag • 1935-1945 (Right)\nComparison of the 1933 Communist Anti-Fascist Logo and\nthe Logo of 2017 Soros sponsored Antifa(cist) movement.\n(See Iron Eagle, NWO, SIS, GS, George Soros, Symbols). - APACHE: (#646) The Internet domain hosting Securedrop in Belgium, also Apache programming language which may have been used to write SecureDrop, also database software that apparently runs SecureDrop, or Apache Co. (NYSE:APA), an oil and exploration company that the Rothschilds’ Family Trust (++) divested their one-third ownership interest in in mid January 2018. Apache runs natively on Android mobile devices but runs only on Apple iOS devices that have been jailbroken which could be why Q noted a dichotomy between Google’s [new Pixel phone], [Samsung] and Apple’s iPhones in drop #771 with the two Android phones in kill boxes.

First mention of Apple in Q drop #428 refers to George Soros selling his shares in Facebook, Twitter, Apple, and Snap, just before he transfers much of his holdings into a non-profit. Next mention of Apple is when comparing Apple to [Samsung], note Samsung in a kill box. The final Q mention of Apple (drops #1309, #1310) are two images of Apple’s Hong Kong Retail Store and Apple’s new World Wide Headquarters campus in Cupertino, CA, which were preceded by two images of JetBlue cargo Jets and the interior of some shipping container or semi-truck with two or more pallets of shrink wrapped cases, all without explanation. (See Apple, Samsung, George Soros)\n- AP News: (#1515) Associated Press news agency which, according to Wikileaks, was one of thirty-three news organizations which colluded with Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC in the 2016 elections. Three reporters/editors were named as involved. (See Hillary Clinton, Julie Pace, Ken Thomas, Lisa Lerer).\n- APRIL SHOWERS, April Showers (#1007) Several possibilities:\n- Lots of activity in April. This seems possible as there was a flurry of Q drops. Q reiterated this meme in Drop (#1162) and indeed Q had listed a laundry list of thing to occur in April on Monday, April 2, 2018 with the heading:\n- April [A]\n- IG report.— The first only partially redacted (Lisa Page’s name blacked out, but job title remained, occasional locations of McCabe locations or meetings, and some investigators names redacted) was released on April 13, 2018 (See Andrew McCabe, IG Michael Horowitz, Lisa Page).\n- Sessions public attack.— Posted in bold font. Repeated calls from conservatives for Sessions to in-recuse himself from the \"Russia investigation\" or resign as Attorney General, Trump criticizes too in Tweets about lack of action on DOJ and FBI corruption, Congressional oversight committees threaten Department political appointees with impeachment. April 5 through 15, 2018.\n- RR problems.— Posted in bold font. After slow-walking Congressional Committee subpoenaed documents and repeatedly missing deadlines, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein threatened with opening of impeachment by both committee chairmen. More information released about RR’s entanglement with Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the FISA Warrant, etc., and further evidence he should have been the one to recuse himself. Calls from multiple sources for Rod Rosenstein's firing. Rosenstein says he’s \"OK with that.\" April 5 through 13, 2018.\n- Seals broken.— Possible referral to unsealing of tens of thousands sealed Federal indictments apparently brought by numerous Federal Grand Juries around the country just since October. Not yet happened.\n- [A]rrests.— Arrests of those persons named in the tens of thousands of sealed indictments mentioned in \"Seals broken.\" Not yet happened.\n- Why was Huber made public?— U.S. Attorney for Utah District John Huber was appointed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate more into Hillary Clinton’s email Scandals, the Uranium One scandal, the FBI non-investigation of both, the DOJ’s meddling, and the politicalization of those two agencies. Revealed early per Q on March 29, 2018—\nWhy now? — The DOJ’s Inspector General’s report is due very soon and the IG has no subpoena power for no-longer-employed retired/fired/resigned Federal employees, and more importantly, no prosecutorial power at all, but a Federal Prosecutor does have these powers. It was revealed by Sessions that Huber is assigned to work with the DOJ’s IG, using his report as a base, for consideration of criminal charges. - Everything has meaning.

Not yet happened.\n- FBI.— Release of ex-FBI Director James Comey's attack book on President Trump, plus intense media attention to push that narrative, combined with the release of the partially redacted DOJ IG report on the firing of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the questionable legality of the NY FBI raid (at Special Counsel Mueller’s instigation) on Trump’s personal attorney’s, Michael Cohen’s office, home, and hotel room, seizing privileged client work-product, results in heavy turmoil around the FBI. Cohen Raid - April 9, 2018 (See Andrew McCabe, DOJ, FBI, Michael Cohen, Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Donald Trump.\n- DOJ.— Between Rosenstein, Sessions, the FBI, Mueller’s acting as if he were the Attorney General in assigning cases to investigate and prosecute (i.e. Michael Cohen vis-a-vis Stormy Daniels and source of $130,000) and which office, etc. the turmoil in the DOJ seems to be reaching epic proportions. Cohen Raid - April 9, 2018.\n- Mueller.— Mueller’s is overstepping his authority, acting as if he were the Attorney General in assigning cases to investigate and prosecute (i.e. Michael Cohen vis-a-vis Stormy Daniels and source of $130,000) and to which office, etc., multiple calls are rising from legal and constitutional scholars for the firing of Special Counsel Mueller, and/or Rosenstein. If Rosenstein, the claim is that a new, stronger Deputy AG would be named who would rein in Mueller from his out of control investigations. Cohen Raid - April 9, 2018.\n- Election Integrity.— Potential evidence revealed on election fraud. Not yet happened.\n- Immigration Bill.— Potential introduction of Administration’s ideal Immigration Bill. Not yet happened.\n- Border.— Hypothetical scenario: Central/South American Caravan \"Refugees\" arrive at U.S. border demanding entry. President Trump refuses entry but California Governor Brown demands, in the name of humanitarian ingests and \"for the children\" they be allowed entry, MSM side with Brown. Soros funds massive demonstrations across the country. Not yet happened.\n- Wall.— Trump orders U.S. Military and National Guard to man the \"wall\" figuratively and also Tweeted on March 23, 2018 the wall is a defense issue and military can build it. Orders NG to border—April 3, 2018.\n- Military start.— Military starts building the wall?

Formerly a colony of the British Empire, Australia is still a member of the loose assembly of United independent Commonwealth Nations as a constitutional Monarchy under the United Kingdom with Queen Elizabeth as a titular head of state, however Australia is actually operated as a constitutional parliamentary democracy with a Prime Minister as executive head of state. Australia's current Prime Minister is Scott Morrison.\nAustralia is a member of the Five Eyes alliance of intelligence agencies including agencies from New Zealand, Great Britain, Canada, and the United States that share facilities, intelligence, and information with each other, and, apparently spy on each other's citizens even when the statutory or constitutional laws of each Five Eyes member nation prohibit the intelligence agencies of that nation from spying on their citizens, thus side stepping those restrictive prohibitions.

Joe Hockey, New Zealand, Scott Morrison United Kingdom). - Autists: (#314) Anyone trying to decipher Q drops, especially members of 8chan, where the term was originated by the members\n- Avenatti, Michael (#1753, #1754) Michael Avenatti, flamboyant attorney who represents stripper/porn star Stephanie Gregory Clifford, AKA Stormy Daniels, in her lawsuit against President Donald Trump to set aside an agreement which prevents her from alleging she had an affair with him while he was married. She is already in violation of the agreement by bringing the lawsuit. The agreement for which she received an alleged $160,000 is a contract in which she is now in default. . . and could face millions of dollars of penalties. Avenatti maintains that because only Trump’s attorney signed the agreement, it is not binding.\nIn mid-September 2018, Avenatti announced he was representing another client, Julie Swetnick, who claimed that as a young college student in the early 1980s, she had attended high school parties put on by younger boys, where she had witnessed the then teenaged Supreme Court Associate Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh with his friend Mark Judge, spiking the drinks of, and then drugging, teenage girls in preparation for multiple boys to \"gang rape them in a rape-train\" fashion of one boy after another, including Kavanaugh and Judge, even though she did not witness him actually perform a rape. Again, she provides no corroborating evidence, victims (although she later claimed to have become a victim after attending ten such parties and doing and saying nothing), or specific dates, or sites. Note that the only named persons at these rape-train parties are those which have already been named in the publicly released data from the original accusation. After Avenetti's announcement, a letter signed by 65 women who attended high schools around the Catholic High School Kavanaugh attended and had been at parties where he had been claimed they had never seen or experienced any such events. Nor does Kavanaugh's contemporaneous calendar permit the attendance at even one such party.

Baker is a former government official at the Department of Justice who served as General Counsel for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In December, 2017 he was replaced as general counsel and reassigned to a different position within the FBI. It was revealed on April 19, 2018 that he was a recipient of at least one memo from former FBI Director James Comey. On May 4, 2018, Baker resigned (under threat of being fired) from the FBI and joined the Brookings Institution as a fellow who will write for the justice-focused blog Lawfare, He also teaches at Harvard Law School. When the application documents for the original FISA warrant for surveillance of Carter Page were finally released, it was uncovered that Baker, as FBI General Counsel, had approved of their legality and that they were complete and accurate, when they were not, and in fact were obfuscating material facts.\nOn October 3, 2018, Baker testified before a closed Congressional hearing in which he apparently revealed that approximately six weeks before the first request for a FISA warrant, he had met with lawyers from Perkins Coie LLC, the firm who had been engaged by the Democrat National Committee to create what would later be referred to as the Steele Russia Trump Dossier which would provide the primary source material used for the warrant application. This meeting implies possible foreknowledge of the questionable source provenance of the dossier. John Solomon of The Hill reports:\n\"Congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met with Democratic Party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump-Russia collusion weeks before the 2016 election, and before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump’s campaign.\n(See Carter Page, Cristopher Steele, DNC, FBI, FISA, Hillary Clinton, John Solomon).\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met during the 2016 season with at least one attorney from Perkins Coie, the Democratic National Committee’s private law firm.\nThat’s the firm used by the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s campaign to secretly pay research firm Fusion GPS and Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence operative, to compile a dossier of uncorroborated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election.\nThe dossier, though mostly unverified, was then used by the FBI as the main evidence seeking a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant targeting the Trump campaign in the final days of the campaign.\nThe revelation was confirmed both in contemporaneous evidence and testimony secured by a joint investigation by Republicans on the House Judiciary and Government Oversight committees, my source tells me. - Bakers: (#1297) Researcher Anons who knead the Q crumbs into useful data chunks of bread.

In the aftermath of the seizure, Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer pleaded guilty to money laundering and facilitating of prostitution in connection to website linked to sex trafficking. Ferrer will testify against his fellow Backpage co-founders.

Backus is an elected Democrat New Mexico State District judge in the Taos, New Mexico. She was first appointed to her seat by New Mexico Governor to the New Mexico Eighth Judicial District Court Division 2 in 2011. She was elected to that seat in 2012, and retained in 2015 to a term that expires in 2020. Judge Backus decided to release the five Muslim adults, called the Amalia defendants—who were found in supervision of eleven allegedly mistreated and abused children ranging in age from one to fifteen years of age, and the body of a twelfth kidnapped child who had died under suspicious circumstances—on $20,000 signature bonds each, meaning they would only have to pay that amount should they not show up for trial. The accused people would also be required to wear ankle radio location bracelets.\nThere was credible evidence presented that the adults were training the children in preparation to perform mass shootings, perhaps in school venues. Locals had heard constant gunfire from the location of the camp, and numerous guns and ammunition was found during the raid. Some of the children had allegedly been recruited under the enticement of “dying as a martyr.”\nJudge Backus has a reputation of imposing extremely light sentences and bail on violent offenders and often releasing such offenders on their own recognizance. After this essentially no bail release of the Amalia defendants, “anonymous credible threats” were made against Backus. After the judge’s ruling, at least one of the adults, a woman, was reported to have been re-arrested by Federal agents. - Baker, James: (#1316) James Bakeris the former FBI General Counsel who had his power removed in January and then was fired April 31, 2018 when it became obvious he had participated in the Hillary email scandal and Trump/Russia scandal.

BanOut2018 is a conspiracy to pretend to be Trump supporters Internet Troll conservative websites and pro-Trump SubReddits on Reddit with the goal of disruption, fomenting dissension, and starting arguments, and ultimately getting either conservative users, the pro-Trump threads, or the entire pro-Trump or conservative topics banned.\nAccording to Top Reddit Moderators an article in BigLeaguePolitics article, who described the technique as fairly simple on Reddit for them to get a SubReddit banned. A BanOut2018 member would join a conservative or pro-Trump SubReddit and start posting abusive, insulting, comments inciting violence, exposing private data, or otherwise violating Reddit rules of conduct. Other members of BanOut2018 would jump in and up-vote these rule-violating comments en-masse so they would rise in popularity above the normal comments in the SubReddit, naturally gaining the attention of Reddit moderators until they'd be deleted, getting a down grade for the entire topic. Enough frequent downgrades can get a SubReddit thread and eventually the entire topic banned. According to the Top Reddit Moderators who described the technique, BanOut2018 was successful with this topic on /r/The_GreatAwakening SubReddit and all similar topics, which were discussion about Q, the second most popular topic on Reddit, completely banished!\nMembers of BanOut2018 have been identified as being members of the ACLU and Media Matters. There is a closed, private SuBReddit for coordination of their activities and which areas on Reddit and other websites where they plan on attacking.

Originated in 1954, by Prince Bernhard of The Netherlands, the first meeting invited two participants from each nation, one from the left and one from the right of the political spectrum, intending to cover both sides of the philosophical conversation.

Usama Bin Laden ostensibly killed in Pakistan on May 2, 2011 on order of President Barack Obama in a raid by US Navy Seal Team Six members on a compound outside of Abbottobad. Identity confirmed by DNA match (say what?) and body buried at sea in less than 24 hours. Interestingly, all mention of Usama’s severe kidney disease and need for kidney dialysis has been scrubbed from the Internet. Original reports had claimed Usama had died of kidney failure as early as December of 2001.\n- Binney, William: (#384, #770, #2129, #2130) is a former highly placed NSA technical director. He still has contacts within the NSA.\nBinney is one of the persons involved in the challenge to the NSA's Trailblazer controversy in which he and three other NSA employees, Thomas Drake, J. Kirk Wiebe, Ed Loomis, along with Diane Roark, a staff employee of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, had signed the report to the Defense Department Inspector General about waste, fraud, and abuse involving the Trailblazer project when Binney had already developed another system, ThinThread, which essentially accomplished the same thing. The five were accused of violation of the Espionage Act for their complaint and their homes were raided by the FBI. Later all accusations were dropped except one charge against Thomas Drake, a misdemeanor conviction.\nBinney's contacts in the NSA have been contradicting the DNC's contract IT specialist Crowdstrike,who claim the Russians hacked into the DNC Server and downloaded gigabytes of confidential emails and other data to give to Wikileaks and the Donald Trump for President Campaign. Instead Binney's NSA contacts are telling him that the DNC Server Breach; during the 2016 Campaign was not accomplished by means of a remote hacking over the Internet. They tell him they can tell this by examining the Metadata on the downloaded files copied from the DNC's server and noting the time between when one file was copied and another was copied. The timing shows the speed of transmission. That speed is far too fast for any transmission over the Internet available at the location of that server. It matches the speed of local download to a device, either a USB Flash Memory Drive, or a USB Hard Drive, connected to a USB port on the server. It does NOT match the available speeds of any known Internet Connection over Ethernet or WIFI. Ergo, the files were copied locally by someone who had physical access to that server computer and then hand carried, shipped, or mailed, the purloined files out of the building by some means. This NSA analysis comports with other forensic IT specialists who have examined the Metadata of the files taken from the DNC's server and given to Wikileaks.\nThe most likely suspect in the local breach is Seth Rich, who was killed by gunfire shortly afterward in a botched strong-arm robbery in which nothing was taken.

The company received widespread notoriety in 2007, when a group of its employees were convicted of killing 14 Iraqi civilians in Nisour Square, Baghdad for which four guards were convicted in a U.S. court. Academi provides security services to the United States federal government on a contractual basis.\nSince 2003, the group has provided services to the Central Intelligence Agency, including a 2010 contract for $250 million. In 2014, Academi became a division of Constellis Holdings along with Triple Canopy and other security companies that were part of the Constellis Group as the result of an acquisition.

He has been the state's senior senator since 2013 and is ranked as the second wealthiest member of the Senate. Previously, he served as Attorney General of Connecticut from 1991 to 2011.\nDuring the overtime hearings on the nomination of U.S. D.C. Appeals Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who at the last moment before the committee confirmation vote to send his nomination to the floor had been blindsided by an allegation that he, while still in high school, some thirty-six years ago, had attempted to sexually assault a fifteen year old girl, Senator Blumenthal assuming the guilt of Kavanaugh, after claiming the judge had lied about a simple difference in interpretation between how the Senator was reading an entry in Kavanaugh's high school yearbook and what Kavanaugh told him it really meant, which was sworn to by a person mentioned in the entry, cited the latin phrase \"Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus\" and asked the judge, one of America's finest legal minds, if he knew what it means, implying that he was going to say that Kavanaugh was lying. Kavanaugh tossed it back to the Senator with the line, \"You translate that, I suspect you would know better than I.\"\nThis was a direct barb at Senator Blumenthal who had run for senate and before that for Attorney General on his record as a Vietnam war hero, telling stories of his heroic actions and displaying medals he received in the Marine Corps. The problem was that Blumenthal never went to Vietnam, never partook in any battles, never performed the heroic acts he bragged about, and in fact, never left the continental U.S. when he was in the military. He won his elections on \"Stolen Valor,\" LIES. The latin phrase that Judge Kavanaugh threw back in Blumenthal's face, \"Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus\", translates to English as \"If you lie about one thing, you'll lie about everything.\" The Judge showed him up for who and what he was! That's why Blumenthal abruptly changed the subject.

Normally used with Ethernet networks, these transparent bridges can also be used in WIFI, bluetooth, and cellular networks. These bridges operate in a way that is transparent to all the network's connected hosts. This bridge records MAC addresses in a table that is much like a routing table and evaluates that information whenever a packet is routed toward its location. A transparent bridge may also combine several different bridges to better inspect incoming traffic. There is no reason such a bridge could not be combined with GPS data, scraping information, data requests, messaging, etc.\n- With Q’s comment in drop #834 “The BRIDGE.” followed by “187” and then “The BRIDGE-2.” followed by “@Snowden.”, we have a hint that the Bridges are people who leaked data from secret computer sources to Wikileaks and the first one was murdered (187).

(See Aly Watkins, Carter Page, Steele Trump/Russia Dossier, SCIF, Senator Mark Warner, New York Times. James Wolfe, President Donald Trump). - Bush, President George Walker: (#1098) George Walker Bush is a Republican politician who served as the 43rd President of the United States for two terms, from 2001 to 2009. He was followed in the Presidency by President Barack Hussein Obama. Prior to being elected to the presidency, Bush served as the 46th Governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000. He is the son of the President George Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st President, and Barbara Bush.\nIt was during Bush’s first nine months in office that, on September 11, 2001, the U.S. suffered the first enemy attack on its mainland in history when four jetliners were hijacked by nineteen Islamic terrorists, most from Saudi Arabia. Two of the hijacked aircraft were flown into the two towers, Buildings One and Two of the World Trade Center in New York City, a third was flown into the side of the Pentagon, the headquarters of the U.S. military forces. The fourth plane was retaken from the terrorists by a counter attack by the passengers who had learned their eventual fate, but in the battle on board, it eventually crashed with the loss of all lives on board. Both 110 story World Trade Towers completely collapsed into a twenty-five story pile of rubble, killing many first responder police, fire, and medical personnel, including many others who had no time to get out of the buildings. The total loss of life of what has come to be known as 9/11 was 2,997. The attacks were attributed to a group known as Al Qaeda, “The Base” lead by an Arab Billionaire, Usama Bin Laden. Bush declared war on Terrorism.\nIn Bush’s last year in office the housing market bubble crashed due to years of sub-prime lending required by a program started in the Clinton Presidency that essentially required banks to lend mortgage money to unqualified borrowers. This requirement put a large number of new buyers into the housing market forcing prices up beyond the economic utility value of the houses they were purchasing. Financial institutions in order to meet the government’s demand that unqualified borrowers be accommodated, created new mortgages which had flex payments for a few years which allowed these normally unqualified borrowers to buy a home by making a monthly payment as much as one-third what was actually required to even service the interest accruing on the loan. That accrued interest was instead added to the principle for a number of years. After the end of a that sweet low “flex” payment period, usually five to seven years, the monthly payment would adjust to the correct amount plus an amount to pay the now larger principal. Some of these loans were amortized over thirty or even forty years but due in total in five or seven years, with a huge growing balloon payment due at the end of the low payment period.\nThe rosy promise was that the unqualified borrower would be the typical upward mover, selling for a huge profit, out of the house, and moving on, buying another flex loan mortgaged house. The mortgage bankers pulled people who already owned their home to take out their equity based on the bubble inflated prices they’d created, or to move up to two-story McMansions, and bank the difference\nHowever, many were struggling to even pay the flex mortgage payment of just $1600 per month were now receiving new mortgage payment demands for $5500 per month or even more that reflected the REAL interest rate as their sweetheart flex periods ended! Those huge amounts were unpayable because the mortgage banking industry that had blossomed under the glut of new, unsophisticated new buyers and borrowers, who had sold them their house or their mortgage and told them how much they were capable of borrowing, had exaggerated and often outright lied about the borrowers’ incomes to even qualify for the flex amount! In some cases, creating what came to be called NINJA borrowers, No Icome, No Job, Approved for a flex Mortgage!\nThose that had the huge balloons, found that property values were rapidly declining, not increasing as they’d been promised, and they could not refinance, nor could they sell for enough to satisfy the current mortgage they had inflated by five or seven years of added interest. Many stripped their homes of appliances, copper piping, and wire, then just walked away.\nThe financial institutions who had been forced make these mortgage loans (there were penalties if they did not, such as being denied participation in the FDIC) were not innocent either. Trying to minimize the eventual catastrophe, the banks packages thousands of these sub-prime junk mortgages together, and because mortgages have historically been good investments, got them rated as AAA investments, and sold the packaged mortgages to insurance companies, retirement funds, and other big investment companies at a discount, as triple A mortgages, just as if they were as good as those mortgages from people who HAD the means to pay them! Then, someone had the not-so-bright idea that insurance companies should be allowed to sell insurance against losses for financial risk. The same insurance companies were going to back that insurance against risk loss with these wonderful AAA mortgage holdings, that they could also insure against loss.\nSix times during his tenure as President, Bush tried to get Congress to do something about the sub-prime mortgage problem, and each time the Democrats blocked it. Bush did not comport himself well by attempting the socialist approach by bailing out banks that were “too big to be allow to fail” after the crash started escalating just before the 2008 elections.

Prior to the approval, the Clinton Foundation received a $140 million donation from Russian sources close to Putin and Ex-president Bill Clinton received $500 thousand for two fifteen minute speeches in Moscow, twice his normal rate. Samples of US uranium were transported to Russia in a diplomatic pouch escorted by then FBI Director Robert Mueller. (Thanks to FreeQ Cboldt).

Canada, with Mexico and the United States is a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), an international trade agreement that supposedly opens the borders between nations for free passage of goods without tariffs and allows joint economic well being. The practice was less than the intent. Canada is also a member with the United States and most of the nations of Europe and some from Western Asia in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a mutual defense alliance formed after the conclusion of World War II. Formerly a colony of the British Empire, Canada is still a member of the loose assembly of independent Commonwealth Nations as a constitutional Monarchy under the United Kingdom with Queen Elizabeth II as a titular head of state, however Canada is actually operated as a Constitutional Parliamentary Democracy with a Prime Minister as executive head of state. The current Prime Minister of Canada is Justin Trudeau.\nCanada is a member of the Five Eyes alliance of intelligence agencies including agencies from New Zealand, Great Britain, Australia, and the United States that share facilities, intelligence, and information with each other, and, apparently spy on each other's citizens even when the statutory or Constitutional laws of each Five Eyes member nation prohibit the intelligence agencies of that nation from spying on their citizens, thus side stepping those restrictive prohibitions.\nThe Uranium One purchase of 20% of U.S. Uranium was centered in Canada. The $140 million donations to the Clinton Foundations from Russian organizations associated with Russian energy company RosAtom which was the ultimate beneficiary of that purchase were filtered through Frank Giustra, a Canadian multi-billionaire into a Canadian registered wing of the Clinton Foundation so the donations would/did not get reported on U.S. IRS informational tax returns.

Launched in 2008, the project was said to be investigating the terrorist organization's funding. According to the DEA, Hezbollah has become increasingly involved with drug trafficking and organized crime as a method of funding its activities. The investigation was tracking how large sums of money were being laundered from the Americas, through Africa, and to Lebanon into Hezbollah's coffers. An investigative report published by Politico in December 2017, described how, during the Obama administration, national security concerns regarding the Iran nuclear deal took precedence over the DEA project.

Both 4Chan and 8Chan (Name derived from the old TV “channels”) are on an area of the “Dark Web.” The Dark Web is essentially an area of the Internet where Google’s web crawling Internet mapping robots do not go to seek out the websites and follow links. Hence the websites in this “terra incognito” of the Internet are not catalogued in Google’s Search database and the data on them cannot be searched. It’s the “Wild West” of the Internet, unregulated, uncensored by anything except the agreement of the website operators and their users. In some areas, literally nothing is prohibited. Most website operators, but not all prohibit such things as child pornography. . . but there are rumored invitation only sites, which apparently exist behind both passcode and paywalls, where it is tolerated. Other criminal activity occurs on similar members only sites.\nBecause topics cannot be easily searched in Google or other mainstream search engines, the Dark Web is not an area of the Internet commonly frequented by average Internet users, the “normies,” as Dark Web users refer to them. The people who do use the dark web, and gather in the “chans,” are generally known to be rebellious, raucous, and independent minded, and not too rule oriented. They are interested in alternative information about what is going on in current affairs as well as in other areas of history and science (including what some prefer to call pseudo science and history but may just be science and history not accepted by the orthodoxy).

He was unanimously confirmed by the Senate for the position on August 5, 2010.\nClapper committed perjury under oath before a US Senate oversight committee when he flatly denied that the NSA was collecting data on millions of U.S. citizens' phone calls. Many Senators called for his resignation as a liar. Clapper excused his lies with an \"I forgot\" the law excuse. Clapper resigned at the end of the Obama administration and is a vehement opponent to President Trump.\nHe is probably the second JC listed in initials in Drop #559.

The order establishes who has authority to classify activities, programs, documents, and media, and to whom and how they can delegate their authority to so classify activities, programs, documents, and media, It describes the process for declassification and review before such declassification, and establishes exceptions to review requirements, and sets hierarchies of authority, with such authority deriving ultimately from Presidential executive powers, for both classification and declassification. It also sets four levels of terminology describing the four degrees of security for classification as Classified, Secret, Top Secret, and Special Access Program (SAP), and also addresses the ability to share the document with Foreign persons or Agencies as part of the classification/declassification process. The entire order is well worth reading for anyone who wants to understand the U.S. classified document, etc., system in place today.\nComparison of the Classified Sections in the Carter Page FISA warrant a\npplication and Executive Order Number 13526\nQ points out the EO specifically prohibits an authorized \"originating\" classifier from doing certain things. For example in Section 1.7 (a) it states:\n\"1.7 Classification Prohibitions and Limitations. (a) In no case shall information be classified, continue to be maintained as classified, or fail to be declassified in order to:\nSince none of the fake information in the Steele/Trump Dossier meets 1.7(a)(4), but it DOES seem to completely fit 1.7(a)(1,2, and 3) by bringing attention to multiple violations of the law by the previous Obama administration, the CIA, DOJ, FBI, DNI, and many members of those organizations, as well as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) as well, organizational malfeasance, administrative error, embarrassment to multiple persons in all of those departments, agencies, and the Obama administration, and restrained political competition by favoring one candidate over another, there was no justification for originally classifying the Carter Page FISA warrant application documents and there can be no lawful reason for continuing to maintain the classification under this Executive Order. (See Barack Hussein Obama, Classified National Security Information, Executive Order # 13526, Carter Page, CIA, CLAS/UNCLAS, DOJ, DNI, Executive Order, FBI, FISA, FISC, Steele/Trump, President Donald Trump).\n(1) conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error;\n(2) prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency;\n(3) restrain competition; or\n(4) prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interest of the national security.\" - Clickbait: (#1711) Articles, headlines, and websites intended to attract (bait) Internet users (clicks) for the purpose of making revenue—including rotational ads from multiple advertisers which pays websites for “impressions” (eyes of viewers that simply fall on their ads) such as those provided by Google to individual websites or from the sales of products or publications from the website itself—by enticing the user to click on a link to visit a website. From a historical perspective, the techniques employed by clickbait authors can be considered derivative of yellow journalism, which presented little or no legitimate well-researched news and instead used eye-catching headlines that included exaggerations of news events, scandal-mongering, or sensationalism. For sites that thrive on thousands of click-throughs to content, many authors see the use of clickbait as a means to tap into human psyche by crafting these eye-catching headlines.\n- Clinton, Bill: (INFO) Former President William \"Bill\" Jefferson Clinton (born William Jefferson Blythe III; August 19, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 42nd President of the United States from January 20, 1993, to January 20, 2001. Prior to the presidency, he was the Governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981, and again from 1983 to 1992. A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton was ideologically a New Democrat and many of his policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy. Married to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who later became U.S. Senator from New York and then later U.S. Secretary of State under President Barack Obama. Together, they have one child, Chelsea Clinton.\nDuring Clinton's two terms as President, credible accusations were raised during the 1996 presidential campaign that the Clinton for President Campaign had solicited and received donations from the People Republic of China in exchange for classified technology having to do with the screws that silently propelled our nuclear submarine fleet, other classified secrets having to do with nuclear arms. The Chinese fundraising scandal involving DNC finance vice chairman John Huang first came to light in the final weeks of the 1996 presidential campaign. A former Commerce Department official, Huang was a top fundraiser who scooped up suspect foreign cash for Team Clinton.\nThe most suspect funds were brought in by Johnny Chung, a bagman for the Asian billionaire Riady family. Chung confessed that at least $35,000 of his donations to the Clinton campaign and the DNC had come from a Chinese aerospace executive — a lieutenant colonel in the Chinese military. Chung said the executive had helped him meet three times with General Ji Shengde, the head of Chinese military intelligence. According to Chung’s testimony, General Shengde had told him: “We really like your president. We hope he will be reelected. I will give you $300,000 U.S. dollars. You can give it to . . . your president and the Democratic party.”\nDuring the Clinton Administration, there was a pattern of Clinton approved transfers of classified technology to Communist China, either through out right sale, or allowing China access through sending the technology in American satellites to be launched on Chinese rockets which strangely failed and when the wreckage was later examined the classified chips were found to be missing from the American satellites. For more information on this read the Cox Report Controversy Timeline Wikipedia Article on these transfers.\nThe sprawling fundraising scandal ultimately led to 22 guilty pleas on various violations of election laws. Among the Clinton fundraisers and friends who pleaded guilty were John Huang, Charlie Trie, James Riady, and Michael Brown, son of the late Clinton Commerce secretary Ron Brown. But many questions went unanswered, even after the revelations that Clinton had personally authorized offering donors Oval Office meetings and use of the Lincoln bedroom. A total of 120 participants in the fundraising scandal either fled the country, asserted their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, or otherwise avoided questioning. The stonewalling worked — and probably encouraged Hillary Clinton in her own cover-up of her private e-mail server and her ties with the Clinton Foundation.\nBill Clinton with wife Hillary, formed the Clinton Foundation, which is used to feed money to the Clinton Family and friends under the guise of charity. Hillary later used the Clinton Foundation as means for a \"Pay-for-Play\" key to gain access to her ear and her policy decisions in her role of the Secretary of State. (See Chelsea Clinton, China, Clinton Foundation, Hillary Rodham Clinton). - Clinton, Chelsea: (#2080) Daughter of Hillary Clinton is the only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She was a special correspondent for NBC News from 2011 to 2014 and now works with the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Since 2011, she has taken on a prominent role at the foundation and has a seat on its board. Q posted a couple of photos of her and her mother, both wearing Christian crosses in an upside-down position, a known Satanic symbolism.\nUpside-Down Crosses\nHillary Clinton’s cross appears to be a Spanish Silver Piece-of-Eight coin recovered from the wreck of the Atocha galleon, which has a cross on the obverse, but worn in an upside-down position on a string of pearls. Chelsea’s appears to be a simple gold or silver cross on a chain.(See Hillary Clinton, Clinton Foundation, Symbols). - Clinton Foundation, The: (#10, #52, #70, #71, #76, #77, #89, #199, #261, #479, #484, #520, #866, #906, #1345, #1445, #1512, #1538, #1552)On its website, The Clinton Foundation claims \"Building on a lifetime of public service, President Clinton established the Clinton Foundation on the simple belief that everyone deserves a chance to succeed, everyone has a responsibility to act, and we all do better when we work together. For nearly two decades, those values have energized the work of the Foundation in overcoming complex challenges and improving the lives of people across the United States and around the world.\" They also claim on their website: \"Fact: 87% of Clinton Foundation spending (link is external) goes to directly to programs that improve people's lives around the world.\" But the \"external link\" is only external in that it links to the Clinton Foundation's Twitter Account which makes the same claim based on the authority of the Clinton Foundation website, begging the question, where each uses the other to verify itself. Others find the Clinton Foundation actually expend less than 4% on programs that actually reach the target persons intended to be helped, while the balance of the expenses seem to redound to friends and family members of the Clinton's as expenses of delivering that \"help.\"\nDonations to the Foundation were observed by many to be linked to policy decisions by, and meeting with, Hillary Clinton when she was the U.S. Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013 in a \"pay for play\" scheme in which access and decision by the Secretary of State and her appointed officials were dependent on making a donation, and the size of the donation, to the Clinton Foundation, and/or engaging her husband, former president Bill Clinton for a twenty Minute speech before your organization.\nThe worst case example of this \"pay for play\" was what became to be known as the Uranium One transaction in which a Russian State owned company, Rosatom, essentially controlled by Russian Federation President Vladmir Putin, gained ownership of 20% of the United State's Uranium, a strategic material, that should never have been permitted to be controlled much less owned by anyone except an American company and citizen. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had the highest veto power over this transaction. She did not veto it. What preceded that affirmative decision for the transaction is what is of interest.\nFirst, Bill Clinton was invited to Moscow, Russia, to give a fifteen minute speech for an Investment banking organization at twice his normal rate, netting the Clinton's $500,000. A series of donations totaling $145 million, which are traced back to principals in the Russian energy industry, are funneled through a man named Frank Giustra, a Canadian billionaire, are donated to the Clinton Foundation during the time the decision is being considered, after the sale has been announced but not consummated. However, these donations are not revealed by the Foundation. Secretary Clinton allows the sale.\nSuspicions have been raised that to facilitate this scheme, Hillary Clinton established an email and document server external to the Department of State's secure and Archived system, outside of oversight, where she could receive and send emailed about the exchange of favors for donations.\nWhen Hillary Clinton's announced her candidacy for president of the United States, donations to the Foundation and its ancillary charities, such as the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), increased, likely due to the potential for access to the future President's ear and policy decisions. However, when she lost, the donations to the Foundation dropped to a trickle, with many donors jumping to the McCain Foundation almost instantly. This drop gives proof to the motives of the Foundation's donors. Without the political advantage, the \"good works\" were insufficient motive to give.\nAs employees of the Foundation, the Clintons, Bill, Hillary, and daughter Chelsea, have many of their living, travel, health, and incidental expenses covered by the Foundation. Chelsea's house is owned by the Foundation. Many other Clinton friends and relatives are also beneficiaries of similar Foundation employee benefits. These are accounted as program expenses, as are their salaries, which permits that claim that \"87% of expenditures goes to programs.\" (See Canada, Bill Clinton, CHAI, Chelsea, Hillary Clinton, John McCain, Vladmir Putin, Rosatom, Uranium One). - Clinton, Hillary Rodham: (#1, #2080) Hillary Rodham Clinton is the former Secretary of State, former First Lady as wife of President William Jefferson Clinton, 2016 Democratic presidential Candidate, co-founder of the Clinton Foundation, and likely conspirator in the framing of President Donald Trump in the Russian Collusion plot. A photo of Hillary Clinton has recently surfaced in which she is seen wearing a Spanish Coin from the wreck of the Spanish Galleon Attocha but it is mounted so the obverse cross is upside-down. This cross matches the plain upside-down cross Clinton's daughter Chelsea Clinton has been seen wearing.\nUpside-Down Crosses\nSuch upside-down crosses are traditional Satanic symbols. (See [3], Alice, Alice & Wonderland, Alice in Bloody Wonderland, Chelsea Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll, Saudi Arabia, Symbols). - CLOCK, Wind the Clock: (#370, #477, #506, #564*, #628, #793, #963, #1044, #1108*, #1232, #1433, #1441) Q tells us \"Timestamp\" and to \"Wind the Clock\" in Drop #477 and \"The CLOCK and the GRAPHIC are ESSENTIAL.\" In Drop # 370 Q said \"Clock started – 10 days.\" The Timestamps we’ve been told are key to the graphic. If we wind every date from the starting of the clock on December 18th—the day of Q drop #370—minus ten days starting date would be 12/7/17. Every minute is one day on Q’s clock graphic. Thus the first of sixty minutes of an hour on the Q Clock would represent 24 hour day of 12/07/17, then next minute would represent the twenty four hours of 12/08/17. . . And so on, continuing around the clock for each calendar day, winding around the face of the clock each time one completed 60 days. . . Spiraling out as we go around the clock. The word Q uses in Q Drops #564 and #1164 is “clockwork.” We plot Days on which Q posts drops drops, and days of major public events on this clock calendar.\nWhen plotted this way, patterns of Drops and event relationships emerge. For example, we can see that Q went mute for ten days beginning on 12/25/17 through 1/3/18, exactly six months before beginning another extended silent period starting on 05/23/18.

As of April 2018, on referral from the Special Counsel Robert Mueller, he is under investigation by federal prosecutors into multiple matters, including bank fraud, wire fraud and campaign finance violations, relating in part to payments made to Stormy Daniels.\nHis office and home were searched pursuant to a Federal Search warrant on April 9, 2018, by the New York Federal Attorney’s Office, although the Federal Attorney for the NY district recused himself from involvement. In late July 2018 it was leaked from the NY Federal prosecutor’s office that Cohen had been surreptitiously recording his conversations with his clients, including then presidential-candidate Donald Trump without their knowledge. A leaked recording of one such conversation with Trump has reached the media showing Cohen and Trump discussing the financing of a purchase the rights to a script or book about a tryst that was claimed to have occurred between Trump and a purported “Playboy model” in which Trump suggests no financing, just pay cash or check. This violates Trump’s Attorney/client confidentiality. (See Special Counsel Robert Mueller Stormy Daniels, Donald Trump) - Cohen, Steve: (INFO) Rep.

These resignations are happening for a reason, even though those reasons may not be apprehensible to the “normies” because the MSM is not reporting those reasons, but instead are seeking to cover those reasons up.

He is now the former executive assistant director of the Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch. He instead has accepted a position of Vice President of Security for Caterpillar Corporation. Coleman reviewed the data on Anthony Weiner's Apple MacBook Pro on which were found hundreds of thousands of emails from Hillary Clinton's unauthorized email server from her term as Secretary of State which were claimed to have been deliberately erased, bleach-bitted, and essentially beyond retrieval, but also described as only referencing yoga classes and her daughter's Chelsea's wedding plans. Instead Coleman stated there was much more than that on the laptop in a folder labelled \"insurance\" including classified State Department correspondence and \"-Hillary Clinton & Foundation, -Crime Against Children+++\". Coleman also stated that Directory James Comey would have been \"briefed on the (contents of the laptop files) first thing in the morning by his subordinates in the +++Criminal Investigative Division+++.\" and further it was added in the Q Drop that the Inspector General stated that \"Comey told us that he did not recall the briefing by Coleman reflected in his calendar.\" (See FBI, former FBI Director James Comey, Chelsea Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Clinton Foundation, DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz, email Server, Anthony Weiner).\n- Colin Stretch: Colin Stretch is Facebook's former top lawyer.

Comey is Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who arrogated to himself the authority which he did not possess to exonerate Hillary Clinton on the illegal email private server which she used instead of the secure Department of State servers when she was Secretary of State. Comey wrote his exoneration memo before he interviewed the major people involved, gave immunity to major people involved in exchange for no useful testimony, and destroyed evidence in the form of the laptops of those major players.\nComey also admitted leaking FBI confidential documents to a University professor friend with instructions to leak them to the media with the intent to force the appointment of a Special Counsel after he'd been fired by President Trump, asserting that Trump's firing him was somehow obstructing justice in a contrived FBI investigation of Trump colluding with the Russian Federation to \"steal the 2016 election.\"\nWe now know the FBI was complicit in creating that fake claim and accusation, which was conceived by the opposition Hillary Clinton campaign. Many ranking members of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have been exposed as participating in that plot and more are being exposed.

First an avid Q supporter and prolific YouTube Q commentator, Corsi performed an amazing instantaneous 180 and became an extreme critic, calling Q a fake, and a hoax, when Q started criticizing commentators who were using Q Drops as a means of monetization by selling books and producing clicks, obviously targeting Corsi stopping just short of naming him. In 2017, he became the Washington, D.C. bureau chief for the conspiracy theory website InfoWars.\nOn September 5, 2018, it was announced that Corsi had been subpoenaed by the Special Counsel to appear and testify before the Grand Jury. The New York Times article cites Corsi's attorney speculation that Corsi may be required to testify on his knowledge about Trump erstwhile advisor Roger J. Stone Jr.'s apparent prediction that Wikileaks was planning to release information damaging to the Hillary Clinton campaign. Both Corsi and Stone are associated with Alex Jones and INFOWars, and its parent company Free Speech Systems LLC.

Freeper Jack Black notes that “Jumpin’ Jack Flash” was itself actually released in 1968, but the importance here is that Strzok emails claimed he got from a 1986 single which may have been a typo on his part. I researched the usage of Crossfire Hurricane, as that is the important phrase. Some other FBI contemporaneous FBI documents refer to ‘Operation Hurricane’, without the word “Crossfire.” Although found in Strzok/Page emails, it is no longer mentioned by Q in the Q Drops.

Hence the websites in this terra incognito of the Internet are not catalogued in Googles Search database and the data on them cannot be searched. Its the Wild West of the Internet, unregulated, uncensored by anything except the agreement of the website operators and their users. In some areas, literally nothing is prohibited. Most website operators, but not all prohibit such things as child pornography. . . but there are rumored invitation only sites, which apparently exist behind both passcode and paywalls, where it is tolerated. Other criminal activity occurs on similar members only sites.\nBecause topics cannot be easily searched in Google or other mainstream search engines, the Dark Web is not an area of the Internet commonly frequented by average Internet users, the normies, as Dark Web users refer to them. The people who do use the dark web, and gather in the chans, are generally known to be rebellious, raucous, and independent minded, and not too rule oriented. They are interested in alternative information about what is going on in current affairs as well as in other areas of history and science (including what some prefer to call pseudo science and history but may just be science and history not accepted by the orthodoxy). People posting there are anonymous. Most have long since given up on the Main Stream Media as being a genuine news resource and prefer to search out and share primary sources.

X1changes to X2 as a function is applied, the delta would be the amount of change between the two values of X.\n- In the Q drops, use of the word “Delta” often denotes an instruction by Q to anons to note the change in time from a POTUS Tweet or comment as compared to the time of a Q drop. This is important for the process of establishing proofs. There are quite a few times when a drop is posted, and then a short time later a POTUS communication will occur with similar meaning or words.\n- Zero Delta: (#2129, #2136, #2139) Were there to be a drop in which the drop and the POTUS communication is “Zero Delta” - or, that is, simultaneously, the implication, of course, would be, that the Q team and the POTUS synchronized their comms. Small increments of time or “deltas” can indicate the same thing. Up until September 10, 2018, the shortest delta of such an event has been less than one minute in Drop #1568. However, in Drop #2136, Q posts a photo showing where an Anon requested on 8Chan at 13:15:50 that POTUS and Q do a simultaneous Tweet and Drop, an essentially ZERO DELTA, to encourage the Anons (and FfeeQs):\nPOTUS TWEETS at 12:35 PM Mountain Time, Q Links to a TWEET in a Drop at 14:35:16, 10 seconds later\nZERO DELTA\nA little under an hour and twenty minutes later both President Trump and Q Tweeted and Dropped with nearly identical time stamps with a variance of ten seconds of each other. The hours can differ on the time stamps due to differing time zones where the two different services are located, or the time where the viewer is looking at Twitter.

In the past, Democrats were considered moderate to Liberal with a small faction of ultra-Leftists socialists. Modern Democrats have swung far to the left with a much larger proportion of their leadership and members in the Liberal to progressive to socialist cohorts. The Democratic Party is the oldest surviving party in the United States, tracing its history back to Thomas Jefferson, one of the principal authors of the Declaration of Independence and a signatory on that document, and who served as the third President of the United States. The Democrats are primarily opposed in modern politics by the Republican Party. In Q drop 2352 Q says \"WELCOME TO THE DEMOCRAT PARTY.

DiGenova later served as Independent Counsel investigating the 1992 pre-election search of then-candidate Bill Clinton's passport file by officials of the George H. W. Bush administration.\nEarlier in his career, DiGenova was an aide to Republican Senator Charles Mathias of Maryland. Lately, DiGenova called on President Trump to pardon Scooter Libby, adviser of Dick Cheney, who was found guilty of perjury for lying to the FBI in an investigation revolving around leaks of sensitive classified material about the revelation that Valarie Plame, a CIA analyst who was married to Joseph Wilson, worked for the CIA. However, special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald who charged Libby already knew who had outed Plame when the FBI approached Libby, and, it now turns out, the witness, New York Times reporter Judith Miller, Fitzgerald used to \"discredit\" Libby's statements and \"prove\" he lied to the FBI, has now recanted her Grand Jury testimony and stated she was \"cajoled and pressured\" to say what she originally said, which was \"incomplete,\" basically, not true. In fact, it was common knowledge that Plame was an employee of the CIA and had not worked as a field agent for at least five years. It is worth noting the Joseph DiGenova is married to Libby's lawyer, Victoria Toensing. On April 13, 2018 President Trump pardoned Libby. Libby had already served a 30 month prison sentence for a crime he had not committed.\ndiGenova has been a strong Trump supporter and has been calling out the FBI and the DOJ for what he sees as an attempted slow coup by persons within those departments. Q directed our attention to a recent statement diGenova made:\"As I've been saying for two years, there's been a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton in the email case and then if she had lost, to frame Donald Trump. And that is exactly what these texts are about. Whether or not Mr. Strzok and Lisa Page and others are indicted is certainly a question people can debate, but let me just say I know there is a grand jury underway, testimony is being taken about Strzok, Page, McCabe and others involved in this case and the reason we know it is that James Baker, the former general counsel of the FBI, as turned State's evidence and supposedly is fully cooperating with the Inspector General and with the Federal Grand Jury. I can assure you, Mr. Comey has been very silent in recent weeks and the reason is very simple: he knows he's going to be indicted.\"\nSocial Media sites and the mainstream media dismiss diGenova as a promotor of \"conspiracy theories\" and what he said above as one of those \"conspiracy theories,\" ignoring all evidence to the contrary. diGenova is currently appearing as an expert commentator and legal analyst on FoxNews.

He comes out of the Long Island U.S. District office where he had worked as a Criminal Division prosecutor specializing in prosecuting gang activity, specifically MS-13 members, since the early 2000s. He is the New York City Bar Association’s prestigious Stimson Medal winner in 2007 for prosecuting dozens of MS-13 gang members on Long Island. He received bi-partisan support for his previous position. Prior to his appointment to the Long Island position, Donoghue had been Chief Litigator for CA Technologies, formerly known as Computer Associates International, Inc. and CA, Inc., which is an American multinational publicly held corporation headquartered in New York City. It ranks as one of the largest independent software corporations in the world. Richard Donoghue, U.S. Attorney for New York.

Like most of the writers featured on Amerika, the name Brock Dorsey appears to be pseudonymous as Google and Internet searches for other articles or even their existence aside from that website is fruitless. (Credit FreeQs Jack Black, Little Jeremiah). Most likely “Brock Dorsey” is a pseudonym for David Brock, an erstwhile conservative writer during the 1980s who penned such exposés as The Real Anita Hill. The writing style seems to be a match. Brock remade himself into a rabid progressive mouthpiece writer when he was outed as a homosexual. Later founded the extreme leftist media watchdog group Media Matters for America also founded super PACs called American Bridge 21st Century designed to elect Hillary Clinton president. Brock was connected for a while as the homosexual partner of Alafantis of Pizzagate notoriety. (See James Alefantis, Bridge, Comet Ping-Pong Pizza Restaurant, Hillary Clinton, Media Matters, Pizzagate).\n- Dorsey, Jack: (#522, #1379) Twitter CEO Jack Patrick Dorsey is a computer programmer and Internet entrepreneur who is co-founder (with Noah Glass) and CEO of Twitter, and founder and CEO of Square, a mobile payments company. Q refers to Dorsey as @Jack, a reference to the means of addressing members of the Twitter community. Twitter is a social media platform website that has had difficulty in finding a means of monetizing its business model. Lately Twitter has been in the news for President Donald Trump's frequent Tweets (the short, now 288 character limited messages that are the posts made on the Twitter platform) the president uses to get his message out, avoiding the Main Stream Media's censorship. Twitter itself is censoring conservative users deleting Tweets, shadowbanning member's accounts and Tweets, and outright banning members who post material that the managing administrators do not agree with politically or that does not toe the \"politically correct\" line.\nShadowbanning is the practice of making a user and his Tweets/posts effectively invisible to any followers/subscribers of his/her Tweets. This practice was exposed in an undercover video made by James O'Keefe's ProjectVeritas reporters. Even President Trump's account was blocked for a few hours for \"hate speech\" by an administrator. When brought to the management's attention, it was explained away as a glitch in an algorithm, and not deliberate. Q brought Dorsey to Anon's attention for being mentioned in a conversation with Democrat House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in Q drop #1379. On September 13, 2018, Dorsey's company announced that phrase \"Illegal alien\" would get any Tweet blocked from being posted as \"Hate Speech. (See Nancy Pelosi, Twitter). - DOSSIER: (#436, #436, #718, #1164, #1708, #1743, #1745) The FusionGPS/FBI/Steele/Russian Trump collusion dossier used as the primary piece of evidence to get the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to grant a warrant to surveil Carter Page, and any third parties with whom he had contact, i.e. the Trump Campaign, and later the Trump Transition Team, and then the Trump Administration.

John Maguire Dowd is an attorney who had been a United States Attorney and also a Marine Corps Judge Advocate General. He has been employed by several Washington, D.C. law firms due to his expertise in white collar crime defense. He has also been a special counsel for Major League Baseball, most notable in the Pete Rose banishment case. Q links to an article in Drop #1849 from Business Insider with the misleading headline of ”Former Trump attorney John Dowd called Mueller 'terrific' after quitting Trump's legal team”. The article however says that Dowd actually said that his relationship and discussions with Mueller were “terrific” not that Mueller himself was “terrific” as the headline implies. (See Robert Mueller, Donald Trump).\n- Downer, Alexander: (INFO) Alexander John Gosse Downer AC (born 9 September 1951) is a former Australian politician and now diplomat who was leader of the Liberal Party from 1994 to 1995, Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1996 to 2007, and High Commissioner (Ambassador) to the United Kingdom from 2014 to 2018. Downer had drinks in London with George Popadopoulos who told him he had a contact (Maltese Professor Joseph Mifsud) who had connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Downer passed on this braggadocio information to intelligence operatives, supposedly instigating the Russia/Trump investigation. (Thanks to FreeQ weston for the question). (See Australia, , Five Eyes, George Papadopoulos, Joseph Mifsud, Stephan Haller, Vladmir Putin).\n- Dragon: (#1394) The text messages between former FBI Lead Agent Peter Strzok and former FBI Special Counsel Lisa Page made reference to both “Crossfire Hurricane,” and “Dragon” relating to the Russia involvement in the 2016 elections. FReeQs learned of and discussed Dragon in an article by John Solomon. “Crossfire Hurricane” was one of the code names for four separate investigations the FBI conducted related to Russia matters in the 2016 election. . . Four days later the same team was emailing about rushing to get approval for another FISA warrant for another Russia-related investigation code-named “Dragon.” (Credit LexiQon editor TexOkie). (See Crossfire Hurricane, FBI, FISA, LP, Lisa Page, PS, Peter Strzok).\n- Drake, Thomas: (#2121) Thomas Andrews Drake is a former senior executive of the NSA who was charged in 2010 of violating the Espionage Act by supposedly \"mishandling classified documents.\" Drake was actually part of an internal investigation involving the NSA's own Inspector General and was a whistleblower exposing wrongdoing within the NSA. He along with three other NSA employees, J. Kirk Wiebe, William Binney, Ed Loomis, along with Diane Roark, a staff employee of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, had signed the report to the IG about waste, fraud, and abuse in the Trailblazer project. Trailblazer was designed to track all cellphone and internet communications in the USA, yet a prototype already existed and the five were pointing out that repeating work that had already been done was a waste. The homes of all who signed the report to the IG were raided by the FBI, and all were threatened with prosecution. However, it was only Drake who was actually charged with violation of the Espionage act in 2010 because he had helped the signers with paperwork internally. The government also claimed Drake had spoken to a reporter. All five claimed the acts of the FBI and DOJ were acts of retaliation against whistleblowers in violation of the Whistleblower acts.\nHowever, less than a year later, all charges were dropped after Drake pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor under the \"Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,\" something that Jesselyn Radack of the Government Accountability Project (which helped represent him) called an \"act of civil disobedience\". Instead of going to prison as a spy, Drake became the 2011 recipient of the Ridenhour Prize for Truth-Telling and co-recipient of the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence (SAAII) award.\nQ brings Thomas Drake to our attention in Q Drop #2121 to refute the veritas and official looking nature of a possibly \"Paytriot\" site which has produced a report using Drake's image and name to give it some gravitas called \"Report For The President\". Drake has Tweeted that he has nothing to do with this site or with the report, stating: \"PSA: Heard http://reportforthepresident.org claiming I’m prominently behind it w/out my image on their website. However, I disavow ANY connection of ANY kind, am NOT part of their team, was never contacted & they’re using my name w/out my consent or permission in blatantly false advertising.\" Since Drake's rebuttal, his photo and name have apparently been removed from the site.\nIn addition, another potential \"Paytriots\" site, JOINT TASK FORCE- MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, is still using Drake's name and image to also give itself more weight than is justified by whomever it is that is behind it. Drake is also denying any connection with these frauds in another Tweet, where he said: \"Brought to my attention that http://jtfmaga.com website has me prominently listed as part of their team. FALSE. Can categorically state I’m NOT on their team, am NOT part of #jtfmaga, was NEVER contacted by them & do NOT support them.

Both charges carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison. The records Edwards disclosed were allegedly confidential documents relating to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, the Russian embassy and others, to a reporter from digital media company BuzzFeed. According to the news reports on her arrest there was another unindicted coconspirator who was also in contact with the Buzzfeed reporters from FinCEN along with Edwards. \"Prosecutors said Edwards saved the confidential reports on a flash drive and sent them to the BuzzFeed reporter using an encrypted messaging application. They said that at the time of her arrest, she was in possession of what appeared to be that flash drive, and a cell phone containing communications with the reporter. Prosecutors also said in a criminal complaint that the reporter exchanged encrypted messages with an unnamed associate director at FinCEN to whom Edwards reports.

It was created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act, signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson, after a series of financial panics (particularly the panic of 1907) led to the desire for central control of the monetary system supposedly in order to alleviate financial crises. The bill was passed by Congress during a recess without a quorum or a quorum call with only progressive supporters in attendance, leading some to challenge the legality of the entire system. The real purpose of the Federal Reserve System was to enable to creation of Fiat Currency, a flexible, expandable paper money that could be lent into existence to the Central Government, and also be lent into circulation that was not backed by anything tangible, an elastic money supply that could be adjusted at the whims of central planners.\nThe privately owned banks which make up the Federal Reserve Banks are:- 1st District Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\n- 2nd District Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n- 3rd District Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\n- 4th District Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.\n- 5th District Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.\n- 6th District Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.\n- 7th District Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.\n- 8th District Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n- 9th District Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\n- 10th District Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.\n- 11th District Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n- 12th District Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.\nFederal Reserve Districts Map\nBy Chris Houston - File:Federal Reserve Districts Map.svg, CC BY-SA 3.0,\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=29409440\nIf you notice, the locations of the Federal Reserve Banks, and hence the districts, are heavily weighted toward the Liberal East, with only three of the twelve banks being located west of the Mississippi River. This was likely deliberate.(See Keystone, Rothschild, Symbols). - Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI: (#Too many Q Drops to list) Federal Bureau of Investigation is the United States pre-eminent and most prestigious law enforcement agency. Under the Obama administration the FBI became politicized at the upper levels of management and weaponized with many of the upper management corrupted to exercise the not inconsiderable power of the agency to be used to protect friends of the administration and pursue opponents.\n- Midyear Exam: the investigation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of an unauthorized, insecure, private email server for official classified correspondence. The ultimate manifestations of this weaponization and corruption were put on display when Director James Comey usurped the prerogatives of the Attorney General and exonerated the former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton from what appeared to be egregious security violations in eschewing using the Department of State’s secure email servers in favor of her own home-brewed and unsecured server which was kept in the closet in a bathroom of a private company in a strip mall, so she could keep her emails from being archived as law required. Suspicion arose that Clinton was selling access to her office and policy decisions through donations to the Clinton Foundation.\n- Crossfire Hurricane:\nThe next blatant exercise of corrupt power was the investigation of the opposition candidacy and eventual president of the United States, Donald Trump, and the use of unverified and unverifiable opposition research in the form of a fake dossier on Donald Trump’s possible connections to the nation of Russia and its President Vladimir Putin which had been created by a former British agent, Christopher Steele, now referred to as the Steele Trump/Russia Dossier. Paid for by the Hillary Clinton Presidential Campaign Committee through the FusionGPS law firm, as well as the FBI directly to Steele, and after the FBI had severed connections to Steele when he was discovered to be less than trustworthy, the FBI based their application for a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant application for a search warrant to surveil a member of then candidate Donald Trump’s campaign, Carter Page as a possible foreign agent of the Russian Federation, based almost entirely on allegations in the Steele/Trump dossier, and presented that application to a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) without telling the court its provenance, its lack of confidence in Steele, and the fact that it had not been able to verify anything in the dossier, a requirement before requesting the warrant.\nThis misbehavior and the sheer animosity toward candidate Trump at its heart became obvious in investigations by Inspector General Michael Horowitz, and congressional investigators. More and more FBI and DOJ personnel have been implicated in a coup attempt to first preferentially swing an election, surveil a political candidate, protect the other party’s candidate, and finally bring down a duly elected US president as the investigation proceeds. There is even evidence of collusion of the other party with foreign nationals including Russians that has been projected onto the innocent parties who are the targets of the investigations that are being ignored, or actually the investigators were complicit in arranging.\n- James Comey — former Director of the FBI — fired by President Trump.\n- Andrew McCabe — former Deputy Director of the FBI, and then Acting Director of the FBI after the firing of James Comey — fired by Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein at the recommendation of DOJ Inspector General for “lack of candor” during questioning about the Clinton matter.\n- James Rybicki — former FBI Chief of Staff under James Comey — fired.\n- Josh Campbell, former Special Assistant to FBI Director James Comey — fired.\n- James Baker — former General Counsel for the FBI — fired for his involvement in both the Clinton and Trump affairs.\n- Tashina Gauhar — FBI Associate Counsel — Status Unknown.\n- Trisha Anderson — Former Advisor to the FBI Office of the Legal Counsel — allowed to resign to avoid being fired.\n- Lisa Page — former FBI attorney with the office of General Counsel assigned to Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok’s married lover — allowed to resign as a cooperating witness.\n- Kevin Clinesmith — FBI Attorney with the office of General Counsel — Status Unknown.\n- Sally Moyer — FBI Attorney with the office of General Counsel — Status Unknown.\n- Michael Steinbach — FBI Attorney with the office of General Counsel — Status Unknown.\n- Edward “Bill” Priestap — Director of FBI Counterintelligence Division and Peter Strzok direct supervisor and a completely cooperating witness to all of the cabal’s involvements in the Trump and Clinton affair coverups — Priestap apparently remains in place in the FBI, but some reports including Q say he may have been demoted by having had his power removed.\n- Peter Strzok) — former Deputy Director of the Counterintelligence Division, later demoted and transferred to Human Resources, who was also fired from being the Robert Mueller Special Counsel lead investigator when it was revealed his extreme animosity toward candidate and then president Donald Trump in emails to his FBI employed mistress Lisa Page on his FBI provided cellular phones. Strzok was also lead investigator the Trump/Russia investigations and, according to whistleblower John Clacalone, took over the Clinton email investigation and then proceeded to politicize it, and then upper management forced Giacalone to retire when he complained about the situation. — Fired after supposedly cooperating in testifying before the House and Senate investigative committees where he came across as condescending and smirking. He often refused to answer some questions.\n- Randy Coleman — Assistant Director of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division, Strzok’s assistant — current status unknown.\n- John Giacalone — MISTREATED WHISTLEBLOWER — former FBI Executive Assistant Director of the National Security Branch and the original Clinton email server investigation lead who was forced to retire when he objected to the coverup of the Clinton crimes and the take-over of his investigation by top management.\nThe prior Director of the FBI before James Comey was Robert Mueller, now the appointed Special Counsel to investigate any Russian collusion with the Donald Trump Campaign and prosecute almost anything he chooses to prosecute. It should be noted that James Comey, Rod Rosenstein, and Robert Mueller are long-term personal friends going back to college which continued through business and professional and family involvements. Such relationships should have resulted in Mueller recusing himself from accepting the appointment to investigate ANYTHING involving the FBI, Comey, and Rosenstein (Rosenstein recommended Comey’s firing to President Trump).\n(See Andrew McCabe, Christopher Wray, Crossfire Hurricane, Donald Trump, FISA, FISC, Hillary Clinton, Inspector General Michael Horowitz, Intelligence Community Inspector General, James Baker, James Comey, James Rybicki, John Giacalone, Josh Campbell, Kevin Clinesmith, Lisa Page, Louie Gohmert, Midyear Exam, Michael Steinbach, Robert Mueller, Rod Rosenstein, Peter Strzok, Sally Moyer, Tashina Gauhar, Trisha Anderson). - Feinstein, Dianne: (#1962, #2276, #2280, #2281) Dianne Goldman Berman Feinstein is a politician serving as the extreme Leftist Democratic senior United States Senator from California, a seat she has held since 1992. A member of the Democratic Party, she previously was Mayor of San Francisco from 1978 to 1988, which she won after the assassination of Harvey Milk. A rabid anti-gun activist, Feinstein has been a longtime proponent of the \"assault weapon\" registration, modification, and outright bans.\nIn early July of 2018, Feinstein received a letter from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, a professor of Psychology at Palo Alto University (California), which made allegations that Judge Brett Kavanaugh, a Judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals, had drunkenly sexually assaulted her, just short of rape, some thirty-five or so years before at a high school beer party when Ford was a mere fifteen years of age. When Judge Kavanaugh was nominated by President Trump to fill the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court left by the retirement of Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, Feinstein, instead of revealing this explosive allegation, sat on it all the way past the conclusion of the normal hearings and background investigations. Meanwhile arranging for Ford to have legal counsel, polygraph examinations, and private Democrat investigations. Days after the close of the hearings, the letter to Feinstein was somehow \"leaked\" to the press. However in testimony it was revealed that Ford had mailed copies of her story to both the New York Times and the Washington Post months before and they also sat on it.\nFeinstein's arranged lawyers delayed the Judicial Committee's vote on Kavanaugh for an additional ten days while all ten Democrat members of the committee held press conferences demanding she be heard and believed, denigrating Kavanaugh as already guilty as charged. When time for testimony arrived on September 27, 2018, Feinstein as ranking member lead a lockstep assault on Kavanaugh's character, demanding he accept an additional delay for the FBI to do an investigation. The final vote was eleven Yea to eight Nay, with two Democrats walking out. One Republican, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a RINO, made his Yea vote conditional on there being an FBI investigation of not more than one week before the final floor vote.

Not to be in any way with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the FIFA case has been accurately deemed the \"FIFA corruption crisis,\" which came to a head in mid-2015 with indictments of many FIFA officials and with a case that involved bribery, cheating, organizational election fixing, referee corruption, game fixing, and even murder. FBI agents, British intelligence agents, including Christopher Steele who discovered that the FIFA conspiracy was global in nature, and other players in the Steele Trump/Russia Dossier were involved in the FIFA investigation. Steele contacted FBI agent and and assistant legal attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Rome Michael Gaeta at the U.S. Embassy in Rome. Gaeta was also the FBI's head of the Eurasian Organized Crime unit and specialized in investigating criminal groups from Georgia, Russia, and Ukraine. One name also involved with the FIFA corruption investigation and prosecution and also with the Hillary Clinton/Donald Trump campaigns was Loretta Lynch. Coinciding with all of this was the case involving Carter Page with Stephen Halper who was also involved with the FIFA corruption case. Coincidences? Perhaps.

The Act created the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to oversee requests for surveillance warrants by federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

Flynn defended himself until he had exhausted all of his assets and was close to bankruptcy. He only capitulated when Special Counsel Mueller's team threatened to go after his son and other family members, at which time Flynn agreed to plead to these bogus charges. After months of waiting, on December 4, 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller finally transmitted charging documents and sentencing recommendations on Flynn to the trial judge, recommending a sentence of zero to twenty-four days imprisonment and a $5000 to $9500 for the charge of lying to the FBI. Mueller includes a recommendation for leniency even with those low guidances due to Flynn's record of cooperation with the investigations.\nThere are reports that contrary to Flynn being entirely free of Federal charges, a separate Federal Grand Jury has been empaneled under another Federal prosecutor in the Virginia Federal District to further indict him for writing an op-ed newspaper opinion referencing Turkey that the prosecutor claims could constitute lobbying without being registered as a foreign agent, an article which Flynn apparently failed to mention in his discussions with Mueller and is therefore not covered by immunity. There is apparently another outside prosecution in which Flynn is assisting which is more murky. (See Adam Lovinger, DIA, Michael Flynn Jr., Robert Mueller). - Flynn JR: (#1265) Michael Flynn, Jr. is the son of General Michael Flynn the fired National Security Adviser to Trump who was accused and pleaded guilty of lying to the FBI.

For more complete information see the Feinstein, Dianne LexiQon entry.\n- Ford, Christine Blasey (INFO) Christine Margaret Blasey Ford is an professor of psychology at Palo Alto University and a research psychologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine. Ford is the woman who made a supposed last minute allegation after the close of the hearings on President Trump's nominee to fill the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court, of a 36 year old sexual attack upon herself that she claims was made by a then teen-aged Brett Kavanaugh when she was just fifteen years old. However, it turns out she actually made her complaint to her Congresswoman in early July, before the hearings even started, and had actually been in the Washington area on August 7, also before the hearings, just 33 miles away, to take a polygraph test, contrary to her statements that she was fearful of flying, which later delayed her appearance before the committee by ten days so she could travel to Washington. In fact, it came out in her testimony, that Senator Dianne Feinstein's staff retained representation for her in early July, apparently before Judge Kavanaugh had even been informed that he was the nominee by President Trump. These all belie her earlier supposedly statements. The Democrat Judicial Committee members, led by Senator Feinstein, sat on this information from early July until after the finish of the testimony to expose it.\nThe myth is, as she testified, is that Ford wished to alert the Judiciary Committee members and President Trump about her explosive allegations before Trump made his final selection from his short list of candidates, so she wrote her letter begging confidentiality. If this were true why did she not write President Trump instead of writing her Democrat Congresswoman and then her Democrat U.S. Senator? When asked under oath, this PhD said \"I didn't know how.\" The other interesting fact here is that Judge Brett Kavanaugh was a surprise nominee who was not on either of the two lists released by President Trump as a candidate.She also wrote letters to the New York Times and the Washington Post relating her allegations. Those are not the acts of a woman seeking anonymity.\nFord's story claims that at age fifteen, after an afternoon of swimming practice, while attending a summer evening beer drinking party with four inebriated teen-age boys, Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, P.J. Smyth, all two years older than her, plus another unnamed boy, and at least one other girl, her lifelong girlfriend Leland Keyser, she was sexually assaulted. This event is weak on details: the party which she does not recall how she knew about it, as described by Ford, took place at a house with unknown owners, with an unknown host, at an unknown location, on an unknown date, and she really is unclear as to how she got there of how she eventually got home, although, now in testimony, looking puzzled, vaguely claims that Leland Keyser (who does not recall it) drove her home. The location is vaguely located approximately close to the country club where she was swimming. . . and which is at least fourteen to fifteen miles from her home.\nDuring the course of the party, Ford claims she drank one beer. She needed to go up a short flight of stairs to the bathroom when she says she was suddenly shoved into a bedroom by one of two boys, either Brett Kavanaugh or Mark Judge, who then locked the door behind them. Kavanaugh then threw her on the bed and got on top of her and started grinding his genitals on her while groping her. Judge was alternately encouraging Kavanaugh or telling him to stop, then jumping on them. One of the boys had turned the volume on a radio that was already playing in the room when they entered so that her cries for help could not be heard to the others down stairs. When she tried to scream, Kavanaugh put his hand over her mouth, causing her to fear he might \"accidentally kill me.\" Kavanaugh was drunkenly trying to remove her clothing but was not being successful due to her wearing a \"one piece swim suit under my clothes.\" Ford relates that on the second time Judge jumped on them on the bed they toppled over such that Kavanaugh was no longer on top of her and she was able to escape, run across the landing to the bathroom and lock herself in, where she waited. She heard the boys, \"laughing, drunkenly pin-balling off the walls down the stairs\" at which point she left the bathroom ran down the stairs, through the living room where the others were talking and went outside and went home. Various stories she related had her walking home, riding home, or, in testimony, having Leland drive her home, but not ever telling her of the sexual assault.\nHer story and the name of her attackers only came out in 2012, when she had to enter \"couples therapy\" because she had insisted that when they remodeled their home that it had to have \"two front doors\" against the advice of her husband and the remodelers. Why this was important to her and what it had to do with a 36 year old assault is never explained. It is ALSO at the exact time that then Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney had listed Brett Kavanaugh on his short list of potential Supreme Court nominees.\nThe four people who Christine Blasey Ford names as being present at the claimed party, including Ford's lifelong girlfriend, to a person deny that the party, or the events, ever occurred. Ford also took the steps of scrubbing her social media and internet presence, an unusually effective scrubbing to boot which shows expert help, not to mention an unusual move for someone who is merely wishing to provide factual information to the hearings.\nLeftists will stop at nothing. On September 28, in response to an request made by the Maryland Democratic Caucus Chair to the Montgomery County Police Department and the Maryland State's Attorneys Office to open a criminal investigation of the allegations that Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted and attempted to rape Christine Blasey in their jurisdiction somewhere, sometime over thirty-five years ago. The Chief of County Police, J. Thomas Manger, and the State's Attorney, for Montgomery County Maryland jointly signed the response letter.\n\". . .in 1982, assault and attempted rape were both misdemeanors and subject\nto a one-year statue of limitations.\nAll of these accusations are for naught and based on misapplications of the law. Even in the hearings the questioners and the Judge himself were under the misapprehension the violation of these many years ago was a felony and had no statute of limitations. Such is not the case.\nIn relating her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ford affected the mien of a teenage girl, with a very high voice that at times she forgot in answering the questions put to her and reverted to the voice of an adult woman, and wearing oversize glasses, which had the effect of making her look smaller. She also demonstrated an unusual ignorance for a PhD in Psychology about topics she would be expected to know in that field such as the use of polygraphs. An expert body language analysis is quite instructive to watch. The expert discusses the use of psychological ploys by Ford in her testimony. Once pointed out by the expert, they become quite obvious and impossible to not see. Of particular interest were the comments about her eye movements that are unconscious which people all do when accessing parts of the memory having to do with real events which are visual and those with created fiction that was written down.\n(See FBI, Sen.

He was first elected in 2008, defeating as the Republican incumbent Michael Coleman who won the initial election by a very small margin. However, Franken was declared the winner after an automatic recount when an uncounted ballot box of uncertain provenance was discovered and a series of court arguments Franken's lead was increased to 312 out of over three million votes cast.\nIn November 2017, Leeann Tweeden, alleged that Franken forcibly kissed her on a USO tour in 2006 during a rehearsal for a skit.

The degrees of freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft guilds, those of Apprentice, Journeyman or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and Master Mason. These are the degrees offered by Craft (or Blue Lodge) Freemasonry. Members of these organisations are known as Freemasons or Masons. There are additional degrees, which vary with locality and jurisdiction, and are usually administered by different bodies than the craft degrees.\nThe basic, local organisational unit of Freemasonry is the Lodge. The Lodges are usually supervised and governed at the regional level (usually coterminous with either a state, province, or national border) by a Grand Lodge or Grand Orient. There is no international, worldwide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry; each Grand Lodge is independent, and they do not necessarily recognise each other as being legitimate. Modern Freemasonry broadly consists of two main recognition groups. Regular Freemasonry insists that a volume of scripture is open in a working lodge, that every member profess belief in a Supreme Being, that no women are admitted, and that the discussion of religion and politics is banned. Continental Freemasonry is now the general term for the \"liberal\" jurisdictions which have removed some, or all, of these restrictions.\nSome scholars attribute the formation of the Masons to the destruction of the Knights Templar and the Masons being established to continue their legacy. Q states in Drop # 1632 that \"Most all powerful organizations have sinister components. With power comes corruption.\" Implying that we should not condemn all Masons because of corrupt members.

The \"GPS\" initialism is derived from “Global research, Political analysis, Strategic insight\". The company was co-founded in 2011 by Glenn R. Simpson, a former investigative reporter and journalist for Roll Call and The Wall Street Journal; Peter Fritsch, former Wall Street Journal senior editor; and former Wall Street Journal journalist Thomas Catan.\nThe Washington Free Beacon, a conservative political news website, contracted with FusionGPS to research backgrounds on all the Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump. Once Donald Trump became the nominee, the Beacon dropped funding. However, the company found another customer, Perkins Coie, a law firm the engaged them on behalf of Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the DNC to do deep background on candidate Trump with relation to his business dealings with Russia.\nSimpson has testified they contracted with a retired British MI-6 agent Christopher Steele to compile what was to become known as the Steele Trump/Russia Dossier. He also testified the company hired two Russia experts as employees: Mrs. Nellie Ohr and Edward Baumgartner. Mrs. Ohr came with a bonus, she had previous experience in the CIA, and her husband Bruce Ohr, was the number four official in the DOJ. It became evident that FusionGPS became more than just an opposition research arm of the Hillary Clinton campaign, but acted as an actual advocate, helping to disseminate their created Dossier to politicians such as the late Arizona Senator John McCain (McCain died in office of brain cancer August 25, 2018) a known Trump opponent, intelligence agencies such as British Intelligence through Steele’s contacts, and directly in interview with the media.

Gaeta specializes in investigating criminal groups from Georgia, Russia, and Ukraine. He was working at the U.S. Embassy in Rome, Italy, when sometime in 2010 he was approached by (the supposedly retired) United Kingdom intelligence agent Christopher Steele who told Gaeta that he had discovered that the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the organization responsible for maintaining the standards, sportsmanship, championships, game rules, etc, of the international sport of football (Soccer) was completely corrupted and its upper management to lower echelons were involved in bribery, point shaving, organizational election fixing, game fixing, and even murder. These allegations, after a protracted international investigation, resulted in indictments brought by the US Department of Justice in 2015 which were described as the \"FIFA corruption crisis,\" and later in convictions.\nBy 2011, Gaeta had been promoted to FBI headquarters in Washington DC and the Directorship of the Eurasian Organized Crime effort, with a concentration on Russian, and Ukraine criminal activity. In another case, separate from FIFA. . .\"Gaeta also oversaw the investigation of Russian mafia boss Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov. Beginning in 2011, and continuing for two years, Gaeta was in charge of a major federal investigation into a money-laundering operation allegedly run by Tokhtakhounov, whose Russian ring was suspected of moving more than $50 million in illegal money into the United States. As part of the investigation, the FBI put a wiretap on Trump Tower for two years ending in 2013, to “eavesdrop on a sophisticated Russian organized crime money-laundering network that operated out of unit 63A,” according to a May 2017 ABC News report. The case was unrelated to Trump. (Bold emphasis ours, LexiQon editors.)\nHis contacts with Christopher were apparently instrumental in disseminating the Steele Trump/Russia Dossier throughout the FBI and pushing the investigation in 2017.

The game Q is apparently directing us to examine is actually possibly the most famous chess game in history between Stepan Levitsky and Frank James Marshall, which was played in 1912 in Wrocław (then Breslau), Poland. The game, which seemed irretrievably lost, was won by Marshall with a move that included an unexpected and amazing Queen sacrifice:\nAmerican Beauty: Stepan Levitsky vs Frank James Marshall 1912.\nYou can see a play-by-play with commentary of the game on Youtube.

The Secretary of State established the Global Engagement Center (GEC) in April 2016 pursuant to President Barack Obama’s Executive Order #13721. The GEC was subsequently codified into law by 114th Congress (2015-2016) in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which defined its mission as being to “lead, synchronize, and coordinate efforts of the Federal Government to recognize, understand, expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at undermining United States national security interests.” The legislation originated as bipartisan bills introduced into both the House and the senate entitled Information Warfare Act, that was renamed and incorporated into the final bill.\nThe GEC and its partners have established programming across multiple platforms, including social media, satellite television, radio, film, and print. This programming is conducted in various languages, including Arabic, Urdu, Somali, and French. The Washington Post and the International Business Times reported that after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, worries grew that propaganda spread and organized by the Russian government swayed the outcome of the election, and representatives in the U.S. Congress took action to safeguard the National security of the United States by advancing legislation to monitor incoming propaganda from external threats.

He is a member of the Republican Party. A native of Central, South Carolina, Graham graduated from the University of South Carolina in 1977. He received his Juris Doctor from the University of South Carolina School of Law in 1981.\nDuring the overtime hearings the Democrats engineered to smear the name, career, reputation, and family of DC Appellate Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump's nominee to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat left by the retirement of Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, by claiming he had sexually assaulted a teenage girl thirty-six years ago when he, too, was a teenage high school student, Senator Graham rose to the occasion and made a barn-burning, rip-snorter of a speech ripping a new rear orifice in the behinds of every Democrat for their unethical behavior and the damage they were doing to the nominee, his family, the Nation, the Senate, and the Constitutional process of \"Advise and Consent.\" Graham's outrage was palpable. Unfortunately it had little effect on Democrats with no sense of right or wrong and no ethical moorings. . . and one Republican Senator. (See Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, Dianne Feinstein, Senator Chuck Grassley, Senator Jeff Flake, Christine Blasey Ford, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, RINO, President Trump). - Grassley, Senator Charles \"Chuck\": (#49, #1253, #1458, #1459, #1496, #1497, #1553, #1990, #2274, #2319) Senator Charles \"Chuck\" Ernest Grassley is a Republican politician serving as a seven term United States Senator from Iowa, a seat he was first elected to in 1980. He previously was a member of the Iowa House of Representatives and of the United States House of Representatives. His current committee and subcommittee assignments are:\n- Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry\n- Subcommittee on Rural Revitalization, Conservation, Forestry and Credit\n- Subcommittee on Energy, Science and Technology\n- Subcommittee on Production, Income Protection and Price Support\n- Committee on Finance\n- Subcommittee on Health Care\n- Subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure\n- Subcommittee on International Trade, Customs, and Global Competitiveness\n- Committee on the Judiciary (Chairman)\n- Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights\n- Subcommittee on Immigration and The National Interest\n- Subcommittee on Oversight, Agency Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts\n- Committee on the Budget\n- Caucus on International Narcotics Control (Co-Chairman)\n- Joint Committee on Taxation\nGrassley came into more national prominence with the rancorous qualification and confirmation hearings for President Trump's latest nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, to replace the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, in mid-to-late summer of 2018, when the Democrats on the Committee on the Judiciary went on a search and destroy mission on Kavanaugh's career, reputation, and life, going back into his teenage and high-school records and unfounded and unsubstantiated accusations of sexual misbehavior at a party when he was seventeen years old for which there was a single accuser and no evidence and for which the named witnesses ALL claimed they did not see what the accuser said they had experienced and witnessed. Despite Grassley's attempts to maintain decorum, treat the accusing witness with respect, and even the opposing Democrats with the proper decorum the Senate requires, the democrats attempted through a campaign of delaying tactics, innuendo, outright accusations, rumors, lies, and hints of character flaws without evidence to smear Kavanaugh and his family, in an attempt to force either him or President Trump into withdrawing the nomination. Grassley, using parliamentary rules succeeded in moving the vote in committee and to the floor of the Senate, not without further sabotage from RINO Republican Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona) who demanded another FBI background check investigation in exchange for his \"Aye\" vote, and eventual approval of Kavanaugh for the seat. Grassley handled it all in a gentlemanly manner, with grace, firmly, and politely.

Hagin will leave by the end of June 2018. Questionable relationships with persons associated with now exposed sex-trafficking sex-cult NXIVM through Hagin’s co-founded business Command Consulting, marketed as \"a global security and intelligence consulting firm that provides advisory services to governments, corporations, and high net worth individuals\", which had among its client a Libyan politician and tycoon Basit Igtet and his wife Sarah Bronfman who were also involved with NXIVM.\nA collection of at least eight sources who spoke have suggested that Hagin may have turned a blind eye to his clients’ involvement with the group because of the massive payout he would receive through a Libyan treasure hunt for a supposed $200 Billion hidden somewhere by Muammar Gaddafi which his company was hired to find for a large ‘finder’s fee’.\nIt is unclear when Hagin's firm stopped working with Igtet, but documents confirm that the relationship lasted until at least 2013. Hagin gave up his stake in Command Consulting when he joined the Trump administration, but according to financial disclosures he has continued to earn nearly $100,000 from the firm in the last year.

It shares the island with the Dominican Republic. Haiti has long been subject to disastrous political policies and natural disasters. The Q drops have pointed out the misuse of its people by being targeted for human trafficking and the theft of its resources and relief donations, especially by the Clinton Foundation which was in charge of relief efforts under the personal supervision of former U.S. president Bill Clinton in the aftermaths of two recent major natural disasters that impacted the island nation and its citizens.\nMany of the recovery contacts went to friends of Bill and Hillary Clinton and frequently were obviously misdirected. For example an earthquake \"reconstruction\" fabric mill was built in the north part of the Island while all of the earthquake damage was in the south. The benefits of the mill went to American corporate Clinton Foundation donors. After the more recent Hurricane, a contract to rebuild the nation's phone system went to a Wyoming cellular phone company, another Clinton Foundation donor, which until they got the multi hundred million dollar contract, had no experience with land lines, or the management, employees, or infrastructure to handle such a task. As such, the task ran into many delays and problems.\nRecent major upheavals in Haiti have included: 2004 Haitian coup d’état, United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, 2010 Haiti earthquake, Haiti cholera outbreak, and Hurricane Matthew. Q links to an article in the Australian press on the Child Sex Trafficking rings operating in Haiti.\nSuspicions have been raised that both the Clinton Foundation and the International Red Cross have been used by traffickers to move victims out of Haiti because generally, no one bothers to do customs inspections on the shipments of such humanitarian organizations, especially during crises.

The possibilities are:\n- Attorney General Jeff Sessions dropping the hammer in Drops #571 and #2163.\n- In the Hammer and Sickle communistic symbol in Drops #290 and #1955.\n- As a speculative secret Weather modification program in Drop #1044, weaponizing the weather. While the source found does not seem very strong, I think it’s plausible, given what we’ve been looking at over the last several months. However, I could not find confirmation from any other sources of a “Project Hammer” other than from a video game reference.\n\"In conversation about why several astronomical observatories are closed there was this comment from 'Mike Dillon' regarding the DARPA project HAARP, and another one called HAMMER. It has to do with harnessing the energy from coronal mass ejections to modify weather with an intense amount of energy. Dillon states, 'HAMMER' is 'High Altitude Meteorological Manipulation Energy Research.'\"\n(Credit LexiQon Associate Editors TexOkie and Cat's Pajamas). - Again, highly speculativeIn #1044, is it possible that the picture with Hussein pointing the AK47, when it is released, could provide a tripwire for “HAMMER?” . . .

Often the purpose of this person is to minimize and/or mitigate damage a politician or official can do to himself or his office by inadvertently saying or doing the wrong thing at the wrong time or to the wrong person. A handler will remind his client who it is he or she is meeting, id=f they have met them before, and details about that person and the previous meeting. The handler will also brief on important issues to discuss with the person which they are interested in.\nSatirist Jonathan Swift, author of \"Gulliver's Travels,\" called these people \"flappers\" because in the mythical country of Brobdignagia, for a pubic servant to hear the entreaties of any one speaking to him, a flapper had to flap his ears, and for that public servant to say anything, a flapper had to flap his lips. Our government, indeed, any bureaucracy, is composed of layers of flappers whose sole purpose is to prevent decision makers from hearing the entreaties of the populace and speaking decision makers' unfiltered decisions to the populace.\nIn the context of the Q drops, the meaning seems to be that certain well known agents and politicians are under the influence of “handlers.” Some possibilities for who the handlers might be could include some higher ups in the rogue facets of the intelligence agencies, or possibly even from the ranks of the power elite themselves, depending how high on the food chain the person(s) Q references is/are. A good example may be the relationship between former president Barack Obama (puppet) and his \"advisor\" Valerie Jarrett (handler).(See Barack Obama (puppet), Valerie Jarrett (handler)). - Handler, Evan: (#1515) Los Angeles Times reporter Evan Handler reported by Wikileaks to have colluded with Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC in the 2016 election.\n- Hannity intruder: (#840) Sean Hannity’s wife finds an intruder trespassing at their $10m Long Island home and the invader claims he is writing a book about the Fox News host.

The AGM-88 can detect, attack and destroy a radar antenna or transmitter with minimal aircrew input. The proportional guidance system that homes in on enemy radar emissions has a fixed antenna and seeker head in the missile's nose. A smokeless, solid-propellant, booster-sustainer Rocket motor propels the missile at speeds over Mach 2. HARM, a U.S. Navy-led program, was initially integrated onto the A-6E, A-7 and F/A-18 and later onto the EA-6B. RDT&E for use on the F-14 was begun, but not completed. The USAF introduced HARM on the F-4G Wild Weasel and later on specialized F-16s equipped with the HARM Targeting System (HTS). The HTS pod, used by the USAF only, allows F-16 to detect and automatically target radars with HARMs instead of relying on the missile sensor alone.

He hosts The Alex Jones Show from Austin, Texas, which airs on the Genesis Communications Network across the United States and online. Jones runs a website, Infowars.com, devoted to conspiracy theories and what the main-stream-media calls \"fake news,\" and the websites NewsWars and PrisonPlanet. Jones was the target of a coordinated censorship attack from Liberal organizations to completely shut down his voice on August 6, 2018 claiming \"Hate Speech\" as the reason.\nStarting with Apple's iTunes Streaming Media and Podcasts, Amazon, Facebook, Google searches, Instagram, and YouTube quickly did the same on the following day. As of September 7, 2018, Twitter has banned Jones permanently. Twitter has also been known to \"shadowban\" users from being seen by other users based on their political viewpoints. It has been shown that it is mostly conservative voices that are being censored by such shadow banning, the sudden inability of subscribed users to see that member's content, by Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, and other social media providers. Some conservative sites are finding themselves demonetized, deprived of the means of making money on their social media accounts, with their ability to use credit cards suddenly discontinued.\nQ has stated in Drop #2088 that Alex Jones is backed by \"MOS\" which is likely to be the Mossad, the Israeli Intelligence agency. Q points out that Jones is not a Q backer, which for a \"conspiracy enthusiast\" is odd, to say the least. In fact his associates and Jones have been actively hostile to the Q movement. Jerome Corsi, an active participant on InfoWars, once a Q analyst did an instant 180 turn several months ago and started claiming Q was a hoax without providing any evidence to back his assertion. Corsi has been called to testify before Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Grand Jury. In Drop #2101 Q points to Jones corporation Free Speech Systems LLC, which owns his radio and video shows. The claim has been made that the \"Russian hackers who were attempting to meddle in the 2016 Presidential Election were trying to direct social media users to fake news on Jones' InfoWars website using \"thousands of bots.\" The reason Jones' news was \"fake\" was that it did not agree with the Main Stream News of the major networks, and offered alternatives.

JW has targeted both Democrat and Republican administrations contrary to the claims found in Wikipedia which somehow tries to conflate FOIA suits to individuals and political parties, when in fact it only applies to government. In fact Judicial Watch frequently prevails in its FOIA suits because usually the agency sued does not have a legitimate reason to deny access to the data and is ordered to release it. Judicial Watch has been responsible for revealing much of the governmental corruption in the since its creation, doing the hard work the news media is no longer willing to do. Unfortunately JW is only welcome on Fox News and other conservative news sites and networks, regardless of the evidence they unearth.

The acts have reportedly incensed Russian President Vladimir Putin. An article in the Daily Beast reports that in January of 2018, a court of law in Switzerland exposed Karapetyan as a Russian agent when it was shown that he had attempted to enlist a top Swiss investigator, named only as Viktor K., as a Russian Double Agent, persuading him to travel to Moscow to meet with Veselnitskaya, and bribing him to reveal national secrets of Switzerland.

Nominated by President Donald Trump after the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, Kavanaugh had completed a contentious round of hearings and, after all testimony was closed, and Kavanaugh was awaiting the vote of the Senate Judiciary committee, ranking minority member Senator Dianne Feinstein, (D - California) suddenly announced she had been in possession for several months of an anonymous letter from a woman, who requested her letter and the incident there-in NOT be revealed, but who none-the-less, anonymously accused a teenaged Kavanaugh and another high school aged boy of, approximately thirty-five years ago, \"locking her in a room against her will at a party, from which she eventually escaped. Feinstein demanded the nomination be sidelined until the allegation could be thoroughly investigated by the FBI. However, the FBI declined to investigate.\nThe letter, with sufficient details to identify the writer, was leaked to the Mainstream Media press (which we later learned already had it, along with the FBI, and other Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary committee who sat on it, since July!) and the story grew from merely \"locking her into a room\" to a \"drunken\" attempt at groping, attempted forced undressing, assault with the intent to commit rape, and an attempted rape of an underage minor, and \"fear of he might take my life!\" All of which went un-reported. However, they were not alone, and the other witness says it never happened, and Judge Kavanaugh claims not only did he not do it, he cannot recall ever being at a party such as the woman describes. The woman, Christine Blasey Ford, a Stanford (California) Professor of Psychology and Social Work, has been uncovered to be a leftist, anti-Trump activist who spent the weekend before she decided to \"come out,\" scrubbing her social media histories, apparently to hide that very tell-tale trail of rabid leftism.\nFord claims the event \"ruined her life\". . . yet she went on from age fifteen, when this supposedly happened to her, to get four or more college degrees including two PhDs, one in Social Work and another in Psychology, marry successfully, give birth to four children, and become a full professor at a prestigious university. She says the traumatic incident really only came out in couples therapy in 2012, but Ford says she cannot recall exactly where, when, or even who was at the party where it happened, and told the therapist there were four unnamed boys, who have now been conflated down to two. We also now know that her parents were involved as defendants in an expensive foreclosure case in 1996 in which the judge who decided against them so that they lost their home, was Brett Kavanaugh's mother. Why did she not speak up then to challenge her attacker's mother hearing a case so important to her parents?\nOn September 27, 2018, The U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary reopened the confirmation hearings for the sole purpose of hearing testimony from Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett Kavanaugh's response. as well as questions to both from a special attorney engaged for the purpose, and committee members of both parties. Dr. Ford was treated politely and attentively by both sides as she related her story, but did not reveal anything new. One thing that did come out is that Senate Democratic staff members had been instrumental in retaining attorneys for Dr. Ford at the beginning of July, even before Kavanaugh had received notification he was the nominee from President Trump, which belied some of the \"reluctant witness narrative.\"\nHowever, later in the day, when it came time for Judge Kavanaugh's testimony, only the Republicans treated him respectfully and politely. The minority Democrats were rude, interruptive and accusative, not letting Kavanaugh complete an response before interrupting him to argue their position. Kavanaugh was righteously angry about the evidence less allegations which have less than no corroboration but actual denials from the people named as participants in events that to a person, including personal friends of Ford, attest under oath never occurred. Kavanaugh displayed the righteous indignation of an innocent man whose reputation, family, career, and credibility had been deliberately and maliciously maligned by lies. He did it without attacking Dr. Ford herself, but instead offered her sympathy for what was done to her by someone else.\nKavanaugh went through his contemporaneous 1982 calendar/diary which he meticulously kept up-to-date, emulating the calendar his father kept, demonstrating there were no unaccounted for dates on which this unknown date, location party, with specific attendees could have taken place, because he was mostly out of town, visiting prospective colleges, football camp, beach week, etc. While there were some social gatherings and occasional beer blast, Kavanaugh was meticulous in recording where and who was in attendance. Meanwhile, Democrats were focusing on comments on Kavanaugh's page in his high school year book, taking the worst interpretation possible even if it smeared someone with that worst innuendo. . . even when that person had already submitted a sworn affidavit that it had an innocent explanation.\nOn September 28, 2018, at approximately 1:54 PM, the committee vote was finally held. Kavanaugh was approved by a vote of 11 Aye to 8 Nay, with two Democrat committee members literals walking out of the hearing room instead of voting instead of voting. One Republican, Arizona Senator Jeff Flake made his vote a conditional Aye vote, siding with Democrats, explaining he would vote No on the floor if there were no FBI investigation, limited to one week and that his AYE vote in committee was conditional on an FBI investigation. President Trump ordered the limited FBI investigation less than an hour later at the request of the Senate leadership.

Kennedy cut taxes to increase revenues to the US Treasury, just as Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump successfully have following his model, using the Laffer Curve, which shows that tax revenues can be maximized at two levels of taxation, one high and one low.

Customary international law, based on practice that nations have come to accept as legally required, establishes the traditional rules that govern the conduct of military operations in armed conflict. Article VI of the US Constitution states that treaty obligations of the United States are the “supreme law of the land,” and the US Supreme Court has held that international law, to include custom, are part of US law. This means that treaties and agreements the United States enters into enjoy equal status as laws passed by Congress and signed by the President.”\nAll US persons subject to US Law must observe the Law of Armed Conflict, including US Corporations and violators may be held criminally liable for war crimes.\nThe Law of Armed Conflict recognizes three categories of participants.- Lawful Combatants: those engaged in activities with government sanction, have a chain of command, and wear a distinguishable uniform.\n- Unlawful combatants: those engaging in war activities without the above. Unlawful combatants who engage in hostilities violate LOAC and become lawful targets. If captured can be tried as war criminals.\n- Noncombatants: those not engaged in hostilities and are not authorized to do so. Noncombatants may not be made the object of direct attack.\nIn the current situation, LOAC effects on the secretive cabal players as well as those of the Deep State (DS) have yet to be fleshed out. A simple reading would indicate that the only participants in the current crisis that are obviously lawful combatants are the members of the US military and any of its Allies participating. How the DS participants are treated remains to be seen. At stake is the conduct of military tribunals for the bulk of the participants without the need for a declaration of martial law.

In a link Q provides to investigative journalist Sara Carter’s website, “in 2016, Halper was an integral part of the FBI’s investigation into short-term Trump campaign volunteer, Carter Page. Halper first made contact with Page at his seminar in July 2016.\nPage, who was already on the FBI’s radar, was accused of being sympathetic to Russia and sought better relations between the U.S. and Russian officials. Halper stayed in contact with Page until September 2017. During that time, the FBI sought and obtained a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to spy on Page and used Halper to collect information on him.” According to the article and Q, Lovinger’s exposé helped ”…raise troubling questions about Halper, who was believed to have worked with the CIA and part of the matrix of players in the bureau’s ‘CrossFire Hurricane’ investigation into Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.\nHalper, who assisted the FBI in the Russia investigation, appears to also have significant ties to the Russian government, as well as sources connected directly to President Vladimir Putin.\" This is, of course, the infamous surveillance warrant that allowed the government to surveil any concatenation of contacts from Carter Page all the way through the Trump Campaign and later the Trump presidential transition team, and later yet the Trump Administration. It led to the illegal unmasking of many American Persons and eventually General Michael Flynn’s conviction for lying to the FBI for telling the FBI something different than an unmasked phone tapped conversation had overheard.

Since 2016 the bill, which applies globally, authorizes government to sanction human rights offenders, freeze their assets, and ban them from entering the U.S. In response to the sanctions applied by the U.S., Russian Federation President Vladmir Putin imposed reverse sanctions on the United States among which was the prevention of many adoptions of Russian children by U.S. couples, including some that were close to completion. Lobbying for the repeal of the Magnitsky Act by Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and lobbyist/\"retired\" Russian intelligence agent Rinat Akhmetshin in a meeting at Trump Tower in June of 2016 has been held out as part of the Russian Collusion narrative of the DNC/Hillary Clinton fake conspiracy story that has embroiled the Trump Administration.

Manafort has been indicted and convicted by a Virginia Federal Court of eight of eighteen counts, none of which had anything to do with the Trump/Russia mandate given to Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Instead they were banking and Federal Tax reporting crimes associated with his business in the Ukraine from several years before he was ever associated with the Trump Campaign. Manafort was also in partnership with Roger Stone who the Special Counsel is now looking to indict for something.

Omarosa was brought to the White House staff by President Trump due to his positive experiences with her in her three appearances on his Apprentice reality TV series. After serving a year in the White House, White House Chief of Staff General John F. Kelly (ret.), along with the attendance of several White House staffers including attorneys and representative from the Human Resources Department, fired Omarosa in a closed door confidential meeting in the White House Situation Room on December 12, 2017. She was forcibly removed from the White House grounds. The reasons given were misuse of official vehicles, money issues, and “integrity issues” thats could have “legal consequences” for Omarosa is she doesn’t accept a peaceful separation. She did.\nQ specifically states the “integrity issues are LEAKS!\nAfter leaving the White House Omarosa returned to Reality TV, appearing on Celebrity Big Brother. She also spent the last few months writing (ghost written) a tell all book entitled “Unhinged,” accusing President Donald Trump of running a essentially a chaotic, incompetent, irrational, and racist administration. She also at various time claimed to have heard, heard of, then again heard, or heard rumors of an infamous recording from ten years in the past in which then TV star Trump used the word “nigger” when referring to Black persons. She then claimed the specific others listened to the recording with her. These “others” have publicly refuted her claims stating they’ve heard no such recording. It should be noted that Omarosa has been shown to have falsely accused others in the past of using the same slur to aggrandize herself.\nIt is ironic that we know the contents of her White House firing conversation because Omarosa demonstrated her lack of integrity by illegally bringing a recording device into a Secure Compartmentalized Information Facility (SCIF) and secretly recording that meeting without permission: ”Omarosa secretly recorded John Kelly firing her in the SITUATION ROOM”—UK Daily Mail. It is obvious from listening to her recording that it was already recording as she entered the SCIF, raising the question “How many other confidential meeting/conversations did Omarosa record and leak and to whom?” It is interesting to note that much of the White House leaking stopped when Omarosa left.

Elected as a Republican, he often voted with the Democrats, and in the last term frequently voted in opposition to President Donald Trump. Q refers to McCain as \"We do not say his name\" and \"No name\" and President Trump has occasionally echoed the first appellation in some of his Make America Great Again Rallies. McCain seems to have been instrumental in passing the now known to be fake Steele/Trump Dossier to the FBI and helping to disseminate through the machinations of FusionGPS. McCain is considered a RINO (Republican In Name Only) due to his frequent votes with the Democrats, especially his swing does defeating Republican attempts to repeal such troubling laws as the Affordable Care Act also known as ObamaCare, which failed repeal by one vote in the Senate, McCain's, a vote for which he left his sick bed to return to Washington to cast. Senator McCain died in office on August 25, 2018, after stubbornly refusing to resign due to health reasons so he could continue to vote against President Trump's agenda as long as he could, preventing a new senator to be appointed to take his place, even though the governor of Arizona has been hinting he may appoint McCain's wife Cindy, a likely very progressive vote to replace him, regardless of her qualifications.\nMcCain ran what appeared to most conservatives to be a deliberately losing campaign as the 2008 Republican candidate for President of the United States with Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin against Democrat Illinois Senator Barack Hussein Obama and his running mate, Delaware Senator Joe Biden.\nAlthough a military veteran and former prisoner of war, and considered a hero by many, McCain was also despised by many veterans for his rumored cooperation with his North Vietnamese captors when he was a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, seeming to receive far better treatment from them than his fellow captives.

McCullough, who oversaw the intelligence community, said he contacted then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper about the issue. McCullough said he was later told not to report his concerns to Clapper, and received \"personal blowback... to my family [and] my office. Emails beyond Top Secret passed through the unsecured server,\" More information can be read on a Fox News article.\nIn addition, McCullough was interviewed on Fox News by Catherine Herridge, where he states “As one of the few people who viewed the 22 top secret Clinton emails deemed too classified to release under any circumstances, the former IG said, ‘There was a very good reason to withhold those emails ... there would have been harm to national security.’ McCullough went further, telling Fox News that ‘sources and methods, lives and operations’ could be put at risk.” Q linked to a New York Times article (behind a paywall) reporting that while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, the Chinese beginning in 2010, started systematically finding and either jailing or executing our Intelligence Assets in China. . McCullough has testified before Congress on these facts. (See CIGIE, James Comey, FBI, Intelligence Community Inspector General, Hillary Clinton, Louie Gohmert, Peter Strzok). - McGahn, Don: (#2388) Donald Francis McGahn II served as White House Counsel for U.S. President Donald Trump, from the start of the Trump administration through October 17, 2018. Some claim that McGahn was somehow responsible for the appointment of Robert Mueller as the Special Counsel for the Russia/Trump Collusion investigation although this is highly unlikely. McGahn previously served as Donald Trump's legal campaign counsel during the presidential campaign having been a previous Federal Election Commissioner appointed by President George W. Bush in 2008 so was quite familiar with Federal Election Laws. After Trump won the presidential election McGahn was named general counsel for the Transition Team. Fake News from the New York Times reported, according to anonymous sources, that President Trump ordered McGahn to fire Robert Mueller in January of 2018. This report was denied by both President Trump and Don McGahn as having never occurred.\nPresident Trump relied on McGahn and his team for the selection of judges to fill the vacancies in the Federal District Courts and Appellate bench. McGahn personally recommended judges Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to their current positions as Justices on the U.S. Supreme Court to President Trump.\nHowever, despite this trust, in August of 2018, the New York Times also reported that President Trump had decided to let McGahn \"take the fall\" for any Russian collusion and obstruction of justice charges due to \"shoddy legal advice from McGahn.\" The same article stated that McGahn had been cooperating extensively for months with the Office of Special Counsel and testifying about Trump's obstruction of justice by firing former FBI Director James Comey.

Bush, Justice Neil Gorsuch, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Special Counsel Robert Mueller, New York Times, President Donald Trump). - MBS: (INFO) Mohammad Bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.

On August 27, 2018, Meadows Tweeted confirmation that the FBI had been found to have leaked evidence to the news media and then used the subsequent stories based on those leaks as independent evidence as independent confirmation evidence to fraudulently seek Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants. Meadows was citing closed door testimony apparently provided by FBI intelligence analyst Jonathan Moffa testimony made on August 24, 2018, behind closed doors before the House Judiciary and Oversight committees. Other anonymous sources in a Q provided link to a Fox News article claimed Moffa did not say what Meadows says he said. This Meadows Tweet seems to confirm the narrative of the leaks on the FusionGPS Steele Trump/Russia Dossier prior to the FISA warrant application which used those very articles citing things only found in the dossier as independent confirmative evidence for its veritas.

Mifsud said, 'I have dinner with Lavrov tonight. Lavrov is my friend. Lavrov this, Lavrov that,'\" Website news organization Buzzfeed cited Mifsud’s erstwhile girlfriend. \"He even show me picture with Lavrov.\" Despite the claim, there is no evidence as of yet proving Mifsud and Lavrov ever met, or that the former professor has any ties to the Russian government. According to court documents George Papadopoulos says Mifsud told him in April 2016 that the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.

Mills was brought in with Hillary Clinton for her FBI interview with Peter Srzok, and allowed to sit in as Clinton's \"attorney\" even though Mills was herself a target of the investigation and a person on the witness list. Mills' Apple notebook computer was seized as evidence in the investigation, but instead of being returned to Mills, or held as evidence, the FBI states they took the step of \"destroying\" Mills laptop. That is unheard of, and there is no basis in law for such evidence to be destroyed—this would be obstruction of justice if it was evidence—and if it is not evidence then under what theory of law could they destroy a private citizen's property?.

The “incels” were praising the actions of Minassian, according to the MSM, even referring to him as “Saint Minassian.

Moffa’s testimony was hinted at anonymously by Representative Mark Meadows (R) N.C., in a Tweet, confirming the clues of how the FusionGPS Steele Trump/Russia Dossier was leaked prior to the FBI using it and several news articles using supposed items that only existed in the dossier as factual back up in the warrant application to the FISC.

However, the demons that are invoked are not the small ones, but very powerful ones. In working with victims of this programming, it is clear that high level demons were placed within these people at very early ages.

However, that theory does not explain why the Mossad would have pushed the MSM support of Obama and his sabotage of USA/Israeli relations and now, when the US is much more supportive of Israel, would be trying to sabotage the president who is fostering that support.

Mueller is also the former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation prior to James Comey. He, James Comey, and Rod Rosenstein are all good friends going all the way back to college, and share family and business as well as professional interactions.

Upon questioning by U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee investigators, it became clear that Munro-Leighton was lying. In her mid seventies, not only was she a couple of decades older than Judge Kavanaugh and could not have shared highschool experiences with Kavanaugh, but as a life-long resident of Kentucky, she had never lived or visited any locations where she and Kavanaugh could have met or interacted, In addition, she was claiming to have written a handwritten anonymous letter that Senator Kamala Harris (D, California) had entered into the committee records and her knowledge of the details as detailed in the anonymous letter did not comport with the letter.

Based in London, it became operational in October 2016, and its parent organization is the UK's Government Communications Headquarters, commonly referred to as GCHQ. In Q Drop #2331, Q directs Anons and FreeQs to an October 4, 2018 CNN article in which it is announced that three member nations of the Five Eyes Nations, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK, are all simultaneously announcing that Russia has been acting badly in the cyber sphere, accusing the \". . .Russian military intelligence of carrying out a worldwide campaign of \"malicious\" cyber attacks, including the hacking of the US Democratic National Committee in 2016.\"\nIt is interesting to note that these are the same three nations who filed objections with the White House over President Trump's announcement he was going to completely declassify the pages of the Carter Page FISA warrant application documents that were still redacted. Speculation opined that these nations were objecting because the UK spy organizations were heavily involved in compiling the fake information in the Trump/Russia Dossier created for FusionGPS and Perkins Coie LLC, and ultimately the FBI, by British Intelligence Agent Christopher Steele. The likelihood is that the UK was still fearful President Trump would move to declassify those redacted pages despite the request from the three Five Eye agencies.\nThis October 4, 2018 claim of Russian misbehavior, at this particular time by these three five FiveEye Intelligence Agencies, a majority of the group of nations, may be a further attempt to forestall that pending declassification, because they believe our government would then be in the position of embarrassing three national allies who had made \"official\" announcements by revealing the involvement of their agencies in such surveillance rather than the bogeyman du jour, Russian military. Q certainly implies this is the case: \"Why now? Think DECLAS.\" (See Australia, Carter Page, Christopher Steele, DNC, Dossier, Five Eyes, FusionGPS, GCHQ, Hillary Clinton, New Zealand, Perkins Coie LLC, Russia, President Donald Trump, United Kingdom). - National Journal: (#1515) The National Journal’s news department, according to Wikileaks, was one of thirty-three news organizations which colluded with Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC in the 2016 elections.

The letter also informs the recipient that if the recipient reveals to anyone that the letter was received or what it requires to be produced, then the recipient has committed a federal felony and will be prosecuted.

Dan Bongino opines that Papadapoulos is a key to current events unfolding. Papadopoulos' wife stated he is thinking about suing the government. The discovery process will reveal and begin to bring down the whole wrongful scheme against Donald Trump. However, on September 7, 2018, Papadopoulos was sentenced to a total of 14 days in jail for his \"crime\" of lying to the FBI about when he first met Matese Professor Joseph Mifsud who told him he had contacts with some Russians he claimed were close to Russian Federation President Vladmir Putin who had some \"dirt on Hillary Clinton\" and that he could perhaps facilitate a meeting with them and/or Putin. It is still problematic as to how the FBI knows when Papadopoulos first met Mifsud as no one has ever interviewed Mifsud as he has disappeared and has not been found to testify.

He works there as a Lobbyist for firms such as Boeing. (See Susan Molinari).\n- Payseur: (#1969) Q posts an Anon’s query about Payseur being the mysterious “P” at the top of everything, but does not comment. Some Anons take this as an affirmative otherwise Q would not have posted it.\nPayseur is a family name of an immigrant to post-Colonial America. While many demonstrably false claims are extant about the Payseurs, a few nearly-verifiable facts are available.\nThe first Payseur was Daniel who emigrated from France and arrived in America around 1805. He is believed to have been adopted, and took the last name of his benefactor. Daniel had a son named Jonas Payseur who had a son named Lewis Cass (L.C.) Payseur. LC Payseur became quite rich in the post-Civil War Southeast (North Carolina and Alabama). He was heavily invested in Railroads, timber, milling, and eventually communications.\nNow for some unverifiable information: Daniel Payseur, was supposedly the Dauphin, the crown prince of France, born to Louis XVI, the last King of France, and Queen Marie Antoinette, who as a toddler was smuggled out of France when his Royal parents were guillotined. He was first spirited away to Belgium, and then to London, where he acquired the name Payseur, and then immigrated to the US. Illuminati researcher Fritz Springmeier asserts that the Payseurs are the top of the thirteen main families/bloodlines of the Illuminati.\nOthers repeat this assertion and maintain that the Payseur line is still viable, though dispersed under many, many, different names over the years. The line is rumored to have true silent-ownership of hundreds of businesses in dozens of industries. The Payseurs are allegedly the most secretive, richest, and powerful of the Illuminati heierarchy.

It is the oldest and largest law firm headquartered in the Pacific Northwest and has a total of 19 offices across the United States and Asia. Perkins handled opposition research for the 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign against Candidate Donald Trump. They hired FusionGPS to create a dossier on Trump’s interactions with the Russian Federation. It is likely that Perkins already had in hand the start of a background report written by Christopher Steele working for FusionGPS which had been prepared for The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative on-line news site, prior to the end Republican primaries. Steele was then hired again by FusionGPS to flesh out his original report. Steele created what was to become known as the Steele Dossier for Hillary Clinton/DNC. Perkins Coie, apparently at the instructions of their clients, Hillary Clinton/DNC, through FusionGPS and Steele shopped the Dossier to the media, the late Senator John McCain, foreign and domestic intelligence agencies, and the FBI, anything to get it public attention to derail Trump’s candidacy.

They have a name for their effort of \"BanOut2018\" which reveals their intent to banish any discussion of Pro-Trump or conservative thought. Reddit moderators have identified Phillips as the coordinator of the postings that were behind the decision to ban the /r/The_GreatAwakening SubReddit Q discussion board on Reddit and all discussion about Q on Reddit. The method was for one of his acolytes to post something to the SubReddit advocating an act of violence, harassment, or exposing some personal information, all of which were deliberately against Reddit rules of conduct, and then the other members of Phillips' cabal, would jump in giving the offender's comment up-votes. These offending comments, with their confirming up-votes which bring them to the top of the SubReddit, would naturally bring them to the attention of the administrating moderators, and cause the topic to gain demerits. Sufficient demerits and negative reports would eventually cause the administration to ban the topic entirely. That was the goal that \"BanOut2018\" has set out to accomplish in numerous pro-Trump websites and social media sites. It is deliberate and effective. Members of Phillips group include people who are identified as active in Media Matters and the ACLU. His site makes plain Phillips progressive, liberal viewpoints. (Credit FreeQ Steven W.).

We know now that he was likely the agent who was taking notes that would later be memorialized in the 302 form from those notes and his memory that would be used to assert Flynn had lied to the FBI. Pientka has stated, however, that he did not think that Flynn ever mislead, much less lied to his interviewers. The implication is that some superior officer in the FBI (McCabe?, Comey?) altered the 302 to make it seem that Flynn had lied. (Thanks to an article written by FreeQ LS ). More current reports are stating that Pientka is prepared to testify against McCabe, Comey, and Strzok.

Q says “ThinkPickle Factory:” in Q drop #1394, Q confirmed that the reference “Pickle” was intended to indicate the fact that the CIA has been nicknamed the “Pickle Factory” since at least 1963, when that name was cited in print. The CIA’s intelligence briefings sent to the president were called “pickles,” derived from the acronym \"PICL\", which stood for \"President's Intelligence Check List,\" (pronounced \"pickle\"), which was developed for President Kennedy in June 1961. Since these were prepared largely by the CIA, the joking appellation \"The Pickle Factory\" was soon coined for their source. In 1965, the PICL was replaced by the President’s Daily Briefing (PDB), a much duller acronym, but the \"Pickle Factory\" stuck for a few years in the press and is still referred to occasionally by some insiders by this old appellation. (Thanks to FreeQ Steven W.).(See C_A, CIA, [C]lowns [I]n [A]merica, Clowns, Hillary Clinton).\n- Pizzagate: (#1063) Pizzagate, the reputed scandal surrounding the Comet Ping-Pong Pizza Restaurant, owned by James Alefantis (a pun on “a l’enfants” = “to the children” in old French), a Rothschild family member, and its suspicious relationship with child trafficking, pedophilia, the Podesta Brothers, Hillary Clinton, disturbing erotic art involving children, Spirit Cooking, and other very odd, strange occurrences ignored by the mainstream press.

Q goes further to state that the Chinese did not hack there way in but were granted access in exchange for cash donations to the Clinton Foundation. Access was managed by Crowdstrike. Pollock has been a Investigative reporter for the Washington Examiner, Bureau Chief for PJ media, a Senior Producer at Fox News, and a producer for ABC’s Good Morning America.

He is a former United States Army officer and was Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from January 2017 until April 2018. Pompeo was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 2011 to 2017, representing Kansas's 4th congressional district. This Congressional representation prompted Q’s use of the nickname “KANSAS” for Pompeo in many of the Q drops. Pompeo was replaced by Gina Haspel, the first female CIA Director in History (outside of Tom Clancy fiction) when he was tapped to replace the previous Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was fired for insubordination when he refused to implement the President’s foreign Policy directives. (See CIA, Gina Haspel, #Rex Tillerson)\n- Posobiec, Jack: (#2122) Jack Posobiec is a is an American correspondent for the American conservative cable news television channel, One America News Network.[2][3] He has been described by some as an internet troll[4] and conspiracy theorist[5] known primarily for his controversial and pro-Donald Trump comments on Twitter. Posobiec is an associate of Alex Jones and Jerome Corsi, and has lately been a Q \"debunker,\" supporting the claims of another Twitter member who goes by the sobriquet of \"Microchip\" to be the real Q. Microchip's claims have been debunked by numerous other Q supporters and his predictions of what Q will do or say next have never been accurate. Yet Posobiec keeps pushing it. His latest attempt is pointing to a 2017 Breitbart article that Microchip claims to have linked to on Twitter two days before Breitbart actually published it. Why that September 14/16 2017 article dispute would have any probative value about Q is questionable, when Q did not appear until October 27, 2017. That shows the lack of knowledge both Posobiec and Microchip are playing with in their debunking.

Priestep is now said to have \"flipped\" and is cooperating with investigators. Per Q: Bill Priestep is Peter Strzok's immediate supervisor. As a Cooperating witness some reports state he had been allowed to remain in his position but had, according to Q, had his power removed. In December of 2018, Priestap retired from the FBI. Preistap was the last remaining holdover who was involved in the Clinton eMail and Foundation investigations and coverups as well as possibly being involved in the spying on the Trump Campaign/Presidency, at least at the upper levels of the FBI and DOJ.

Launched in 2008, the project was said to be investigating the terrorist organization's funding. According to the DEA, Hezbollah has become increasingly involved with drug trafficking and organized crime as a method of funding its activities. The investigation was tracking how large sums of money were being laundered from the Americas, through Africa, and to Lebanon into Hezbollah's coffers. An investigative report published by Politico in December 2017, described how, during the Obama administration, national security concerns regarding the Iran nuclear deal took precedence over the DEA project. The Obama administration actively subverted both DEA and FBI drug investigations, obstructing justice, to avoid any embarrassment to individuals involved in the Iran deal.(See BHO, Cassandra Project, DEA, DOJ, Hillary Clinton, Iran, Joint Plan of Action, John Kerry,).\n- PROJECT DEEPDREAMv2:(#790) Possible upgrade to MKUltra.(See CIA).\n- Projection: (#9, #953, #1053, #1252, #1452, #1538, #1570, #1571, #1862, #1925, #1927, #1928, #1934, #1935, #1943, #1944, #2128, #2170, #2205) There are several definitions for the word Projection but only three of them matter in the Q drops.\n- Projection: Claiming others are doing something illegal or immoral that you yourself are already doing because they just must be doing what you would be doing in the same position as they are in. As part of this projection, the ascribing to others actions you would take based on motives or ethics you yourself embrace, assuming that other share those same motives and ethics, no matter how base they might be. Prime example is Hillary Clinton Campaign and DNC officials including Clinton claiming the Presidential campaign of Donald Trump was colluding with the Russians to sway to outcome of the 2016 presidential election without evidence when it now becomes evident it was actually the Hillary Clinton Campaign which was colluding with Russians to affect the outcome of the 2016 presidential elections. Classic Projection.\n- Force Projection: (#1029) The ability to impose a nation's will on an external nation to accomplish a goal. War is the ultimate force projection. It is a term used in military and political science to refer to the capacity of a state \"to apply all or some of its elements of national power — political, economic, informational, or military — to rapidly and effectively deploy and sustain forces in and from multiple dispersed locations to respond to crises, to contribute to deterrence, and to enhance regional stability.\"This ability is a crucial element of a state's power in international relations. It can be also applied to a business or even an individual, a politician, or political party or movement, in business in an economic or political application of force against another individual, business, or political situation. Another prime example here would be the force projection used by Antifa against any appearance of an individual conservative speaker on a college or university campus.\n- Psychological Projection: In many ways related to mere projection, but deeper and inherently imbedded in the psychology of those who exhibit it, this is the denial of the behavior they ascribe to others and criticize, especially when it is misdirected bad behavior, they themselves are doing and must deflect attention from what they are doing. Defensive mechanism to point the attention away from themselves to someone who may at first glance be doing something similar, but for entirely innocent reasons, but who can be accused of something those who need the deflection can blame them for doing. For more complete information see the Psychological Projection LexiQon entry.\n- ProjectVeritas: (INFO) ProjectVeritas\" is an undercover video documentary project founded by James O'Keefe dedicated to baring the real motives and actions of the Main Stream Media, the DNC, various Left Wing organizations, Planned Parenthood, and social media platforms and their political bents and policies and practices as exposed by catching their employees, officers, and backers in unsuspecting undercover videos. The Main Stream Media, although using such undercover video and photography themselves, are quick to condemn O'Keefe's use of such undercover approaches and further reproach O'Keefe as \"not a real journalist\" because he espouses a \"right-wing philosophy\" regardless of the facts he uncovers. They label everything he exposes as \"fake news.\" Many of ProjectVeritas' video's have been banned from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for \"Hate Speech.\" (See Shadowbanning, Facebook, James O'Keefe, YouTube).\n- Pruitt, Edward Scott: (#1179) Edward Scott Pruitt (born May 9, 1968) is an American lawyer and Republican politician from the state of Oklahoma who is the fourteenth Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nominated for the EPA position by President Donald Trump, Pruitt was confirmed by the United States Senate to lead the EPA on February 17, 2017. Pruitt is vehemently opposed to the activist environmental regulations and policies of the Obama EPA and has been reversing many of those regulations and policies.\n- PS: (#1288, #247, #1891) Q uses these initials for two usages:\n- In most common usage in the Q drops, Q uses PS for FBI Deputy Assistant Director of the Counterintelligence Division Peter Strzok who was also a member of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia/Trump Probe. Peter Strzok was also involved in an illicit affair with Lisa Page. Strzok may be behind everything at FBI, agent who questioned Hillary and Flynn, involved in Uranium One investigation, etc. (#1288) per Q: now a cooperating witness. He has now been fired. For complete information on Peter Strzok see the LexiQon entry for Strzok, Peter. (See FBI, General Michael Flynn, Hillary Clinton,\n- Lisa Page, Robert Mueller, Strzok, Peter, Uranium one).\n- In Q Drop #1891. Q PS is Sony PlayStation. Q is pointing out that such game consoles have built in chat log systems which can be used for game players to communicate when playing shared games but which can also be used to talk about other, non-game subjects. Q hints that Deep State conspirators have been using these Sony game consoles along with Microsoft Xboxes, which have similar chat capabilities, to communicate, among other surreptitious means. These game console conversations are facilitated by the use of an Internet servers on Sony's and Microsoft's company's computers. (See Xbox).\n- Psychological Projection: (#1822, #1925, #2170) Psychological Projection is the psychological phenomenon where someone denies some aspect of their own behavior or attitudes and assumes instead that others are doing or thinking so. It is usually seen as the externalization of a person's negative traits, placing blame on an outside force such as the environment, a government, a society or other people. Projection can also extend to philosophy and knowledge. This occurs when a person or small group of people assume that everyone else is working with the same ideas and/or information that they are. When this fails to happen, however, it can lead to pluralistic ignorance. Some examples:\n- Antifa members who are the actual fascists accuse everyone who disagreed with them of being fascists, and reactionaries.\n- Liberal progressives who need minorities kept under in racial groups, i.e. racists who claim that anyone who criticizes them must be racially prejudiced.\n- PSYOP: (#142) Psychological Operation, fool the target by using psychological misdirection, psychological pressure, or persuasion using the knowledge of human natural reaction individually or in groups, large or small.

But my guess (refer to definition for 4,10,20 above) is that Q is hinting that POTUS-4 [10] represents the hand inside the puppet president, with \"10\" as the tenth letter in the alphabet which might mean the president’s HANDler was (Valerie) Jarrett, the real power behind the hand puppet Obama.\n- Quick History Lesson: (#1252) Q’s Quick History Lesson, copy and paste version:\n- 13th Amendment: Abolished Slavery.\n- 100% Republican Support.\n- 23% Democrat Support.\n- 14th Amendment: Gave citizenship to freed slaves.\n- 94% Republican Support.\n- 0% Democrat Support.\n- 15th Amendment: Right to vote for all.\n- 100% Republican Support.\n- 0% Democrat Support.\nQ’s Quick History Lesson Graphic Version\n— R —\nR to Rybicki, Jim:\n(#@$&0-9) A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\nReturn to the Top of the LexiQon.\n- 13th Amendment: Abolished Slavery.\n- R, R’s: (#19) Republicans.\n- [R]: (#1277) Renegade, the Secret Service Name for President Barack Hussein Obama.

Ramos allegedly had a long standing dispute with the paper in the past, even suing them in court for criminal defamation in 2012, a case that a judge later tossed due to the fact the data published was factual and readily available to the public. He allegedly opened fire with a shotgun at the publication’s Annapolis, MD headquarters, reportedly targeting victims according to news outlets. Q later links to an archive of Ramos’ rambling Verizon page supposedly justifying his lawsuit and Q suggests investigators look at the final graphic used by Ramos, which is apparently his family crest, or coat of arms.\nMost likely this is a custom designed vanity fake that anyone could purchase from ads in the backs of magazines in the 50s through 70s.

Ironically, on September 12, 2018, the Q discussion SubReddit area on Reddit called /r/The_GreatAwakening was abruptly banned with no warning, due to \"Inciting violence, harassment, and dissemination of personal information.\" It is highly unlikely that any of the participants making comments on those threads, unless they were deliberate trolls, made any such comments. In Q drop #2198 Q directs us to these Reddit use Statistics for the /r/The_GreatAwakening SubReddit which show the impact to usage the unwarranted take-down had:\nA peak at /r/greatawakening traffic stats from before the banIt is quite obvious the SubReddit was taken down for political reasons because of the political pro-Trump content. Previously, the same week as the take down of the Q discussion area, Reddit also took down a comedy discussion area for MillionDollarExtreme and associated subs /r/BillionShekelSupreme and /r/ChadRigh, belonging to what the administrators term an \"Alt Right Comedy Troop. The reason again was described as content that violated Reddit's new content codes, specifically \"violent content.\" In other words, it wasn't Liberal, Progressive, politically correct content.\nIn Q Drop #2314 Q points out once again that \"Symbolism will be their downfall\" under a copy of Reddit's advertisement for Reddit Premium which includes a faux Reddit coat of arms made up of too cutesy cartoon characters.

A CBS employee, using a group of lefties, including \"More than 30 covert left-wing actors have been identified coordinating with the plotters, including activists linked to Media Matters and the ACLU,\" who call themselves \"BanOut2018, pretending to be Trump supporters posted inflammatory commentary in the Q forums which would instantly be given comparatively large numbers of up-votes by their organized cronies. These high positive responses to violent and harassing comments, which violate the rules of Reddit, naturally bring the moderators attention to the SubReddit. Enough of them, too frequently posted, result in the banning of the entire topic, regardless of the negative response from the regular users complaints and request the interloping trolls cease posting. The CBS employee has been identified by the top Reddit moderators as Gary Phillips, who serves as digital media administrator for CBS Studios International in Los Angeles.\nBanOut2018 SubReddit Page\nPhillips runs a private subreddit in which he makes clear his liberal ideology, and plans his covert actions against Trump subreddits according to copious information reviewed by the editorial staff.

A dose of purified ricin powder the size of a few grains of table salt can kill an adult human. The median lethal dose (LD50 — the amount of a poison which will kill 50% of those which are given that dosage) of ricin is around 22 micrograms per kilogram of body weight if the exposure is from injection or inhalation (1.78 milligrams for an average adult). Oral exposure to ricin is far less toxic as some of the poison is inactivated in the stomach. An estimated lethal oral dose in humans is approximately 1 milligram per kilogram. Symptons of Ricin poisoning vary according to the mode of delivery:\n- Inhalation: Within three to four hours flu like symptoms develop with breathing difficulties, respiratory distress, fever, cough, nausea, and tightness in the chest. Heavy sweating may follow as well as fluid building up in the lungs (pulmonary edema) mimicking pneumonia. This rapidly worsens as the lungs fill with fluid. Death occurs within 24 to 72 hours.\n- Oral injection: If sufficient dosage survives inactivation by stomach acids, vomiting, diarrhea would been within several hours, leading to bloody vomitus and diarrhea. This leads to Severe dehydration may be the result, followed by low blood pressure. Other signs or symptoms may include seizures, and blood in the urine. Within several days, the victim's liver, spleen, and kidneys would stop working, and the victim could die without major medical support within three to five days.\n- Skin and Eye exposure: It is unlikely to be absorbed through normal skin. Contact with ricin powders or products may cause redness and pain of the skin and the eyes. However, if you touch ricin that is on your skin and then eat food with your hands or put your hands in your mouth, you may ingest some.\nIn early October 2018, envelopes containing a white powder which tested positive for Ricin, were received at the Pentagon. No Pentagon personnel were injured by the Ricin attack using the envelops.

Admiral Rogers is native of Chicago, Illinois . He graduated from Auburn University in 1981. He received his commission via the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps. He began as a surface warfare officer (SWO) and was selected for re-designation to cryptology (now Information Warfare) in 1986. o He is a distinguished graduate of the National War College and a graduate of highest distinction from the Naval War College. He is also a Massachusetts Institute of Technology Seminar XXI fellow; Harvard Senior Executive in National Security alumni; and holds a Master of Science in National Security Strategy. In 2003: during U.S. invasion of Iraq, Rogers joined the military’s Joint Staff, which works for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where he specialized in computer network attacks. By 2007, Rogers had been elevated to serve as the director of intelligence for the military’s Pacific Command. His work in the Pacific lead, Rogers to become promoted to director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2009. Shortly afterwards Rogers was named commander of U.S. Fleet Cyber Command and commander of the U.S. 10th Fleet, with responsibility for all of the Navy’s cyberwarfare.\nIn 2014: President Barack Obama nominated Admiral Rogers to be his new director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the commander of the United States offensive cyberoperations unit in the Department of Defense. He did not need to be confirmed by the Senate for director of NSA, but had to be confirmed by the Senate to head United States Cyber Command, for which the Senate unanimously confirmed him. In mid-2016: The Washington Post reported that Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter and Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James R. Clapper, Jr. had both recommended to President Obama that Rogers be terminated as director of the National Security Agency. Clapper and Carter had put Rogers on notice for poor performance in internal security and leadership style. His termination was reportedly delayed. Before the firing process moved forward, Rogers met with then President-elect Donald Trump without notifying his superiors, apparently to tell Trump about the surveillance of his campaign phones and Trump Tower itself via the Carter Page FISA warrant. Trump moved his offices and campaign to one of his Trump resort properties the day following Rogers' meeting with him (Swordmaker). Rogers was reinstated as NSA director in the Trump Administration. In January 2018: Rogers announced he would retire from the NSA in the spring. Rogers followed through with that resignation on May 4, 2018 when he officially handed over his position his successor Paul Nakasone. (Research Credit LexiQon Editor StormFlag).

Prior to his current appointment, he served as a United States Attorney for the District of Maryland. Only six senators voted against his confirmation as deputy Attorney General: Blumenthal (D-CT) Booker (D-NJ) Cortez Masto (D-NV) Gillibrand (D-NY) Harris (D-CA) Warren (D-MA). In early 2017, Rosenstein was tasked with writing a recommendation on whether or not the then Director of the FBI James Comey, of whom Rosenstein was due to his position as Deputy Attorney General the direct supervisor, should be fired for a variety of reasons. His conclusion in that letter was that Director should be fired. Comey was in fact terminated from his position of FBI director by the President of the United States, Donald Trump. Subsequently, Rosenstein,in the position as (Acting) Attorney General after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from any decisions revolving around the issues having to do with Russia, appointed a Special Counsel to investigate the involvement of Russia in the 2016 election and also supposed obstruction of justice by the President for firing the FBI director, which he recommended be done.\nRosenstein appointed a life-long friend, Robert Mueller, as the special counsel to handle the investigation when, due to the writing of the recommendation letter, Rosenstein himself would be a primary witness in any obstruction investigation against the president and by law required him to recuse himself from making any decisions.\nThe latest development are reports published in mid-September 2018 by the New York Times, which considering the anonymous sources may mean they are not true, that Rosenstein offered within days of being appointed to his position to wear a \"wire,\" a microphone and recording device, when meeting with President Trump in the Oval Office, intending to record the President to demonstrate how \"unfit for office\" the newly elected president\" who had just appointed him was to serve as president, and that the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, which allows a majority of Cabinet Members can recommend the removal of a sitting president be removed for mental or physical disability, be immediately invoked. Rosenstein denies he ever made such an offer. The following week Rosenstein went to the White House to meet with Chief of Staff John Kelly amid rumors of either being fired or resignation to forestall being fired.

He was also a lawyer, academic, former diplomat and Islamic cleric. He has been a member of Iran's Assembly of Experts since 1999, member of the Expediency Council since 1991, and a member of the Supreme National Security Council since 1989. Q linked a Reuters’ article relating how on August 27, 2018 the Iranian parliament sanctioned Rouhani, rejecting his assurances that his promised economic turn-around would be still forthcoming. The parliament had two days before fired Rouhani’s “minister of economy and finance and weeks after they sacked the labour minister, blaming them for the collapse of the rial currency and surging inflation.”\nQ is hinting a major event is going to occur in Iran soon. In mid 2018, it was discovered the former U.S. Secretary of State under Obama, John Kerry,has been traveling to Iran to meet with Rouhani and other top Iranians to tell them to ignore any overtures from the Trump administration as the Democrats will soon get rid of him and be back in power. This is a clear violation of Federal Law and could possibly be considered a treasonous act. In addition it has been learned that in 2013, three Democratic members of the House of Representatives, Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison, Indiana Congressman Andre Carson, and New York Representative Gregory Meeks, who, along with self-styled leader of the Nation of Islam, Minister Louis Farrakhan, secretly met and dined with Rouhani.

It was his staff who discovered on examining the supposed missing Hillary Clinton private eMail server, which is apparently not so missing, that according to Congressman Louie Gohmert (R), “they found that her emails, every single one except four, over 30,000, were going to an address that was not on the distribution list.” Gohmert added that “It was going to an unauthorized source (sic) that was a foreign entity unrelated to Russia.”\nTwo different ICIGs, chief investigator Rucker and the IG himself, Charles “Chuck” McCullough, have testified they brought these facts to the attention of the FBI investigators including the fact there were classified documents improperly and illegally on Clinton’s private server and nothing was done about it. Peter Strzok, lead investigator of the Clinton eMail “matter,” testified before Congress that he vaguely recalls the meetings, but does not recall the content, both of which occurred before FBI Director Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton for any wrong doing, with the last ICIG briefing being held in June 2016 about a month before former FBI Director James Comey stated that he would not recommend any indictment of Clinton for mishandling classified materials. Q links to a Daily Caller article on Rep. Louie Gohmert’s discussion on these disturbing findings. On August 29, 2018, the Daily Caller published another article on this subject in which the FBI denied finding any evidence at all of any breach of the Clinton’s eMail server.

Other CNN innuendo is that Schmitz was somehow connected to George Papadopoulos merely because he was sitting next to him at a Trump meeting. Appears to be an attempt by CNN to reboot the Trump/Russia collusion story.

The press went apoplectic, claiming that the phrase should actually be a hyphenated word \"scot-free\" rather than a two word phrase or name \"Scott Free\", asking \"Who is 'Scott Free?',\" and chortling as if they had caught Trump in another ignorant gaffe.\nOn the contrary, Q points out that Trump is again playing 4D chess while the MSM press is playing checkers by showing that Trump has sent the Anons and FreeQs another proof of the legitimacy of Q memes in a double meaning as \"Scott Free\" is the name of the production company formed by Ridley Scott, producer and Director of \"White Squall,\" the source of the signature phrase and motto of the Qanon movement \"Where We Go One, We Go All,\" turning their criticism on them.

Sessions served as Attorney General from January 2017 until November 7, 2018, the day after the disastrous mid-term elections where the Democrats regain control of the House of Representatives, when he tendered his resignation. President Trump named Sessions' Chief of Staff, Matthew Whitaker, as Acting Attorney General, skipping over the current Deputy Attorney General Rodney Rosenstein, the person who would normally be named as acting Attorney General according to Department of Justice protocol.\nSessions had resigned from his fourth term as Republican U.S Senator for the State of Alabama to accept the position in President Trump's Cabinet. The day after confirmation, Sessions recused himself from any investigation having to do with the possibility of Russian collusion with the Trump Campaign to effect the results of the 2016 presidential election due to his having some contacts with the Russian Ambassador in his official Senate duties, and a momentary contact at a Trump campaign event where he again ran into the Ambassador. Legal scholars have since stated that Sessions received bad legal advice from the DOJ and need not have recused himself based on such official and fleeting contacts.\nHowever, for purposes of the Russia/Trump 2016 election investigation, all such question devolve to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who for those issues is the Acting Attorney General. Legally, Session could reverse his recusal at any time. In other important actions, Sessions has appointed a special DOJ inspector general, Michael Horowitz to investigate corruption within the DOJ and the FBI, with special attention to the Hillary Clinton eMail case. He has also ordered an outside the Washington D.C. area U.S. Attorney to work with Horowitz, Utah AUSA John Huber, who has been assigned 470 prosecutors to prosecute those corrupt officials that are uncovered. Q points to a cumulative total to date of over 55,000 sealed \"Indictments\" that are pending action. Sessions also selected Ezra Cohen-Watnick as his DOJ counter-terrorism advisor which Q says is important.

The group's primary activity is advocating for U.S. military involvement in the Syrian Civil War through congressional office visits, media awareness campaigns, and organizing junkets for key U.S. foreign policy decision-makers (including the late Sen. John McCain, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Sen. Lyndsey Graham). SETF is indirectly funded by the U.S. State Department through contracting firms including Chemonics and Creative Associates International. SETF's executive-director, Mouaz Moustafa, is a former field organizer for the U.S. Democratic National Committee and previously served as executive-director of the Libyan Council of North America.

The users who have been \"shadowbanned\" are not notified of this status but will suddenly see a drop of responses to his/her posts from high numbers to zero as other users will not receive links or his/her \"tweets\" or any notifications that the shadowbanned user has been ostracized by the platforms' censors. First uncovered by undercover video's of Twitter workers bragging about how they can shadowban users they disagree with politically by James O'Keefe's ProjectVeritas, more and more conservative social media users have reported being treated in such a manner by Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and other social media platforms, and have been unable to get relief from the companies' management which generally ignores their attempts to contact them. Shadowbanning can have catastrophic economic impact on small online businesses who have built their businesses on reaching their customers through social media.\nThere is no recourse from such treatment as it is extremely difficult to contact the administrators of these social media platforms to learn what happened and when contacted they will not explain their reasons. Some high profile victims of such treatment have been Alex Jones, Diamond and Silk, and David Horowitz, whose responses dropped from several hundred thousand per post to just one. Even President Trump's Twitter account was given the Shadowban treatment for a few hours by a single arrogant Twitter censor. Such high profile people can sometimes get attention and the companies invariably claim an \"algorithm glitch\" for the problem.

She was a 38 year old, female, Iranian born, and vegan, animal rights activist and PETA member, and an obvious progressive. Her claimed motive was YouTube’s censorship and demonetization of her YouTube channels for “inappropriate content,” when other videos with more egregious content were allowed to remain uncensored. Family members (brother, father) warned authorities she might do something violent targeting YouTube and police questioned her the morning of the attack. Father, Ismail Aghdam, is an Electrical Contractor now living in Riverside County, California. The family moved to the USA from Iran in 1996.

So far FreeQs have identified two possibilities:\n- SIGLE could be the “System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe” which was established in 1980 to disseminate information to government agencies between the participating nations. Ostensibly SIGLE data is available to others as well. Although supposed Governmental funding of SIGLE ceased in 1985, a new network for the acquisition, identification and dissemination of grey literature was formed called “European Association for Grey Literature Exploitation” or “EAGLE,” which became the producer of the SIGLE database. Input to the database ended in 2005 when the EAGLE General Assembly decided to the liquidate the network. However, in 2007, together with the last EAGLE operating agent, FIZ Karlsruhe, integrated the SIGLE records into a new open access database called OpenSIGLE hosted by the French STI centre Institut de l'information scientifique et technique at the French National Center for Scientific Research (INIST-CNRS).

This has become the most likely meaning in Q Drops as later Q Drops have refined the usage: In Drop #1334 Q makes the point that the rank and file employees of the UK are “SIS Good”, implying the problem there, as here, is at the top. In Q Drop #1382 to meet with SIS, was the reply to an anon asking why Peter Strzok in London for Comey. In Q Drop #1385 Q asks if “SIS is good?”, but also implies that the covert SIS of the FBI continued in relation with the UK's SIS (See \"Special Intelligence Service\"). Later it gets more obvious with Q Drops #1443 “UK [SIS], #1455 “UK/SIS and SIS ‘good agents.”, #1493 “UK SIS”, #1828 UK PM/MI6/SIS[SPY ACTIV], and #1876 “O-PRO in SIS/UK-P?”.

It was a part of the U.S. Army Signal Corps so secret that outside the office of the Chief Signal officer, it did not officially exist. SIS was an early predecessor to the modern National Security Agency (NSA) and later appropriated by the National Security Council who reappointed the resources into the modern NSA.(Thanks to FreeQ truthluva).

A second technical version of this system, SIS II, went live on 9 April 2013.” Schengen Information System). Given the global nature of corruption and clean-up (”WW”), it’s possible the Schengen-IS may be an important player in rounding up Euro corrupt players. Likely deprecated for Q purposes.

The room itself is a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), a room, an area, or even a building in which it is illegal to bring in any recording device, camera, cellular phone, etc., or sometimes even notepads, and no insecure external connection to the outside is permitted. It is usually a felony to bring any such devices into a federal SCIF. All of the activity and conversation inside is presumed restricted from public disclosure.

She saw this activity on at least two days, implying this was an ongoing activity, resulting in thousands of fraudulent ballots and votes. After witnessing this activity, Smith was summarily fired with no explanation. Broward County has been notorious for election count delays, recount delays, and hanging chads, and other discrepancies in voting as well as irregularities in voting rules and regulations under the Democrat control of the Supervisor of Elections. Accusations of fraud have been frequently lodged against the Supervisor of Elections. In 2016, the Supervisor destroyed all the ballots soon after the election in contravention of the laws of Florida.\n- Sniffers: (#30) Internet bots designed to search the Internet for specific data on websites. Sniffer bots can be used by Social Media websites, government agencies, private security firms, or even individuals. Data they may seek is Social Security Numbers associated with names, passwords, credit/debit card numbers and associated data, bank account data, personal information, compromising photos or information, etc. They differ from web crawlers that vacuum up all website data in that they are specific in the data types the \"sniff\"out.\n- Snopes: (#56, #1533) Snopes is a Soros backed left wing “Fact Checking” organization which often twists and often even falsifies its fact checking to support progressive Liberal philosophy and denigrates anything conservative or right 018 Democratic wing. By being accurate on checkable objective facts, Snopes establishes a reputation of veracity in those areas, which makes its leftward slant on subjective “truth” more insidious as they present it in the same way as they do objective truth. Citing only Leftwing and/or progressive sources as authoritative on determining history or social questions is another way Snopes uses to establish the truth of their declarations. For example, Liberal main stream news sources are never described as ever being leaning left wing, but any citations from conservative news sources, no matter how main stream or popular, are always described as “right wing.” (See George Soros).\n- Snowden, Edward: Edward Snowden, former NSA contract worker who stole and released millions of classified NSA documents.

She was the founder and former co-owner of the designer brand Kate Spade New York. Although quite wealthy, and the mother of a thirteen year old daughter, Spade was the apparent victim of a suicide. She was found to have apparently hung herself from a doorknob using a red Kate Spade Silk Scarf. A cryptic note to her daughter was left reportedly saying \"Ask your father.\"\nSpade was a known associate of the Clinton Foundation, was involved in the CF’s Haiti Earthquake relief programs and reportedly received some funding ($5 million) from the CF to build a textile factory in Northern Haiti just prior to selling her company (the Earthquake damage was in the Southern part of the island nation) which was never built. Spade was rumored to have been involved in the rescue of \"Haitian orphans\" being run by the Clinton Foundation as well, which had a taint of scandal when some children were found not to be orphans. Spade has also been pictured partying with James Alefantis of Pizzagate notoriety. She is just one of several celebrities who have chosen this means of suicide in recent weeks and months.

Most recently, the such censorship reared its ugly head on Reddit with the unwarranted banning and deletion of the SubReddit /r/The_GreatAwakening, an area dedicated to discussions about Q, on September 12, 2018, ostensibly for \"inciting violence, harassment, and the dissemination of personal information.\"\nMost likely the posts that may have violated those new Reddit conduct rules had been posted by Internet thread Trolls, who had posted such content for the purpose of getting the entire topic banned. This is a weapon from the arsenal of those who attack the conservatives on line.

At its ideal extreme, private or personal ownership of all property would be abolished, including the ownership of an individual's body, efforts, creativity, and thoughts. Everything under socialism would be decided by the needs and for the ultimate benefit of the State or collective community. Decisions would be made from the top down. Committees of \"educated\" persons would decide the needs of individuals and those needs would be then provided for them. Similarly a committee of \"educated\" persons would evaluate an individual and determine how that individual would best contribute to the State or the collective community. \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.\" Socialism sounds good in theory, but in each and every case where it has been applied, it fails miserably.

The text of the statement is as follows:\nStatement from the Press Secretary\n— LAW & JUSTICE — — Issued on: September 17, 2018 —\nAt the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of transparency, the President has directed the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice (including the FBI) to provide for the immediate declassification of the following materials: (1) pages 10-12 and 17-34 of the June 2017 application to the FISA court in the matter of Carter W. Page; (2) all FBI reports of interviews with Bruce G. Ohr prepared in connection with the Russia investigation; and (3) all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all Carter Page FISA applications.\nIn addition, President Donald J.

British agent who was the former head of the Russia Desk for British intelligence. He later worked as a independent contractor for FusionGPS, the FBI, and perhaps other agencies. Steele is claimed to have been the principal investigator and/or author of what has become to be known as the “Steele Dossier” which began life supposedly as a background investigation on the candidate Donald Trump, contracted as for the conservative website news organization The Washington Free Beacon, prior to the Republican primary election. After the primary and Donald Trump’s win, on May 3, 2016, The Beacon ceased its funding.\nThe Hillary Clinton Campaign and the DNC, through the using a law firm, hired FusionGPS to do opposition research on Trump, and FusionGPS in turn hired Steele. The bare bones Beacon report grew into seventeen memos that eventually were compiled into the Steele Dossier. Sometime in June, Steele also shopped the dossier to the FBI, British Intelligence, and various media resources who rejected it as unsourced and not verified. Steele continued attempts to market the dossier, while the FBI picked him up as a paid consultant in their Trump/Russia investigation with a contract requiting no media contact or release of the Trump information he had provided. In October, Steele passed on sixteen of the dossier memos to David Corn of Mother Jones Magazine, who published enough to let the FBI become aware he had broken his agreement and they claim they broke off allure of Steele as a source. Having lied to the FBI his reliability as a source should have precluded the use of any of his material in any FISA Court applications. . . but it did not impact using the Steele Dossier for the purposes in getting a primary FISA Court surveillance warrant on Carter Page and three renewals, all using Steele’s reliability as an honest agent. Not a word was said to the court about his discharge for leaking and lying.\nIn a Washington Examiner article on August 3, 2018, it was reported that Bruce Ohr was used as a conduit between the FBI and Christopher Steele, who had been fired as a source for lying about contacts with the media. The FBI has maintained the cut off all contact with Steele due to this misconduct in October 2016, however it has now been show that Ohr, though his wife’s employment at FusionGPS and its employment of Steele, was in contact with Steele and reported his continuing feed of information back to the FBI at least twelve times with FBI form 302s beginning on November 22, 2016, and extending through May 15, 2017, documenting Bruce Ohr’s reporting of Christopher Steele’s data.

He realized that the only way he could react to that offense was to walk away. He posted his thoughts on this on Twitter and created the #WalkAway for those on Twitter who wished to Tweet a comment. He was amazed to find he was not the only Democrat who offended by the leadership and the outrageous conduct of other Democrats such as Antifa, BlackLivesMatter, and many others for whom facts did not seem to matter, that emotion trumped everything, and violence was justified by their feelings.

Lately members of the elite have been killing themselves at what seems to be a higher than normal rate. There seems to be linkages between these suicide victims and the Clinton Foundation, Hillary Clinton, and in some way with sexual child abusers and possibly even perhaps pizzagate. Among those suspicious suicides, which may actually be homicides, are:\n- Chester Bennington, age 41, musician and singer with Linkin Park: suicide on July 20, 2017, by asphyxia due to hanging by a belt from a doorknob in his home, two months after his friend Chris Cornell, age 52, committed suicide in a similar manner.

Sullivan was also a senior advisor to the U.S. government for the Iran nuclear negotiations (Joint Plan of Action) and a visiting professor at Yale Law School. Prior to teaching at Yale, Sullivan worked in the Obama Administration as Deputy Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor to U.S. Vice President Joe Biden. He also served as the Director of Policy Planning at the U.S. Department of State, and as Deputy Chief of Staff to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Book written by Tom Clancy involves nuclear bomb intended to go off outside a football stadium in Colorado while pro game with VicePresident and one other cabinet member are in attendance. Bomb turns out to be a fizzle due to makers killing their bomb maker before he takes the final step of installing an exciter material to increase yield and make into Hydrogen weapon. Purpose was to trick US and Russia to go to war by making US think the bomb was a Russian Attack. Movie version moves attack to Baltimore, drops fizzle subplot. Bomb Uranium in both is from US source.\n- Continuing Clancy book and movie analogy in Q drop #1306, Q strongly implies the Uranium being used to clandestinely continue their nuclear bomb research, likely in Northern Syria at a now destroyed facility, was deliberately sourced by Obama and Hillary Clinton, Et al., through the Uranium 1 scandal in which 20% of US uranium was sold to Russia. Some of it was transferred to NK, some to Iran, but source is ultimately Traceable to US. (See Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Iran, Joint Plan of Action, Robert Mueller, U1, Uranium 1)\n- Supermicro: (#2334, #2335, #2336) Super Micro Computer Inc. although having offices in San Jose, California, has its products manufactured by a Chinese company which manufactures computer mother boards and logic boards for generic devices. Three years ago it was discovered by Amazon and Apple that Supermicro was surreptitiously placing an extra chip on those boards that would intercept data and send these data by whatever connections became available to servers in China. Amazon and Apple which were going to use rack mounted servers from a third party computer assembler, Elemental Systems, in their respective cloud services, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Apple's iCloud, had both ordered large numbers of these servers. Both companies discovered a suspicious Integrated Circuit (IC) non-spec chip, \"not much larger than a grain of rice installed on the (Supermicro) mother boards\" of these test sample computers they'd received from the Elemental Systems.\n\"One official says investigators found that it eventually affected almost 30 companies, including a major bank, government contractors, and the world’s most valuable company, Apple Inc. Apple was an important Supermicro customer and had planned to order more than 30,000 of its servers in two years for a new global network of data centers. Three senior insiders at Apple say that in the summer of 2015, it, too, found malicious chips on Supermicro motherboards. Apple severed ties with Supermicro . . . \" — Bloomberg Businessweek\n\"Multiple people familiar with the matter say investigators found that the chips had been inserted at factories run by manufacturing subcontractors in China.\"\nBoth Amazon and Apple officially deny these claims. Amazon went ahead and acquired Supermicro in mid-2015. But Apple cancelled its order for 30,000 Elemental Systems rack mounted server grade computers and issued the contract for the servers to another, more expensive supplier, one who did not use the same motherboard maker. However the official line from each company is as they wrote: “It’s untrue that AWS knew about a supply chain compromise, an issue with malicious chips, or hardware modifications when acquiring Elemental,” Amazon wrote. “On this we can be very clear: Apple has never found malicious chips, ‘hardware manipulations’ or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server,” Apple wrote. “We remain unaware of any such investigation,” wrote a spokesman for Supermicro, Perry Hayes. The source of all this is reporting from Bloomberg Businessweek citing anonymous sources in the companies and government, so it is possible it is Fake News. So far it is also single sourced and any other reports are all citing Bloomberg as their source.\nIt should be noted that although Q shows a photo of an Apple store, Apple designs its own logic boards with the boards being multi layered, making the addition of an additional chip a not inconsequential proposition, requiring a re-engineering of the entire board to accommodate the new addition. Apple is also fully in charge of their own quality control for their products, with a detailed computerized comparison done on every logic board to assure that it matches specifications when it comes out of manufacture. In addition, Apple designs each of the processors and many of the ICs on their mobile devices as Systems on a Chip (SoC) by hand, not computer designed, and it would be nearly impossible for any Chinese agency to add something to a chip (it would have to be done at the design stage). Any surreptitiously added IC would raise a red flag in the quality control checks done on every Apple product. Also, Apple does not use third-party reference design motherboards as do many PC manufacturers, who often buy parts such as motherboards and logic boards from multiple suppliers of which there are many such generic makers in China. Apple was purchasing these rack mount server grade computers for a specific use in their content data server farms. They were designed by Elemental Systems to handle massive streaming video, not for home or even office level use. They would not be found on a home computer grade mother board. It is highly unlikely they would be found in a home Microsoft PC or any mobile laptop either. It would not exist in any Android or iOS device either. . . although Chinese made Android devices have been discovered that regularly upload the data about their users to servers in China. As Q says, they were on top of this from three years ago.

Sussmann was formerly with the U.S. Department of Justice, and according to Perkins Coie's website, is a nationally-recognized privacy, cybersecurity and national security lawyer. The website further puffs Sussmann as being \"engaged on some of the most sophisticated, high-stakes matters today, such as his representation of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in their responses to Russian hacking in the 2016 presidential election. This work was detailed in the best-selling books The Perfect Weapon (2018), Russian Roulette (2018) and Hacks (2017).\"\nThe bio on the website further states that Sussmann has been ranked as a “Privacy and Data Security Expert” in the Chambers Global and Chambers USA directories. He is often quoted in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and other media. His legal work also has been cited by investigative reporters in two other important books: Power Wars (2015) and Dragnet Nation (2015). He has provided Congressional testimony and litigated national security issues in federal court.\nIt would have been this \"expert\" who had recommended bringing in Crowdstrike to investigate the DNC server when it was discovered it had been \"hacked\" and data stolen. However, the conclusions that Crowdstrike made that it was an external break-in via internet has been debunked by numerous other forensic IT specialists, including those who work for the NSA, who state that the meta data associated with the stolen files show the break-in was local and the files were copied to a local flash drive, not sent over the internet.

Symbols allow people to go beyond what is known or seen by creating mental and often emotional linkages between otherwise very different concepts and experiences. Q has stated numerous ties that their symbols will bring the people behind the evil down, and that \"> Some examples of the symbols Q has pointed out in the Q Drops include: pervasive owl(s), Ys representing goat heads or antlers, the Eye of Ra or a stylized left eye, the eye of providence at the top of a pyramid, Antifa/Nazi flags, Masonic symbols, temples (especially the temple with owls on Epstein Island), pedophilia symbols, satanic symbols (such as the upside down crosses worn by Chelsea and Hillary Clinton), the zodiac, religious symbols, especially some that seem counter intuitive such as the snake/viper symbology of the Vatican's audience hall.\nVery Odd Architectural Symbolism In Vatican Audience Hall\nOther symbols not mentioned by Q and more subtle, but just as effective and perhaps insidious, are the symbolic use of paper currency for actual value, logos for companies, a color (Gang colors), sounds, monuments, specific animals, totems, websites, icons, emojis for emotions, the Letter Q has become a symbol for a movement, and in some instances even the images of certain people can represent specific memes, support, sponsorship, protection, or guilt, etc, by association when none may be warranted. For example of such use of a symbol can be demonstrated by the use of Q to sell books, T Shirts, or other Q paraphernalia as if Q were sponsoring such sales when Q has distanced itself from such commercialization of the Q movement.

Some trolls deliberately post violent, lying, or racist posts with the intent of shutting down an entire thread, or getting an entire topic banned on a site. Other trolls purpose is to enrage other thread participants and to start flame wars by attacking the participants with ad hominem slurs, insults, and other approaches that are not discussions, but character assassinations, designed to start fights. Some do it just for fun, but others are paid trolls.\nThere is a good chance that the shut down of the Reddit SubReddit The_GreatAwakening Q discussion area was engineered by a organized attack of anti-Q trolls.\nBigLeaguePolitics broke the story that Top Moderators from Reddit revealed that it was an organized cabal of left-wing posters who organized the take down of /r/The_GreatAwakening on Reddit.

These high positive responses to violent and harassing comments, which violate the rules of Reddit, naturally bring the moderators attention to the SubReddit. Enough of them, too frequently posted, result in the banning of the entire topic, regardless of the negative response from the regular users complaints and request the interloping trolls cease posting.

Goldstone told the Washington Post he had arranged the meeting at the request of a Russian client and had attended it along with Veselnitskaya.\nOn June 3, 2016, Veselnitskaya told Russian oligarch Aras Agalarov that she had “official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary [Clinton] and her dealings with Russia” that “would be very useful to” Trump, according to an email to Donald Trump Jr. from colorful music industry publicist Rob Goldstone, who was informed of Veselnitskaya’s offer the same day by his pop star client—and Agalarov’s son—Emin. Veselnitskaya started to talk about “individuals connected to Russia supporting or funding” Clinton and the DNC, but then switched her pitch to voicing objection to the Magnitsky Act, under which a number of prominent Russians were sanctioned for human rights abuses.\nInstead, Veselnitskaya only talked about the Magnitsky Act, a law which applied sanctions against Russia and resulted in Putin ending the adoption of Russian children into the west. The meeting was terminated by the Trump people when it became obvious it had been misrepresented and was actually a lobbying attempt. Goldstone later said he didn’t know this was Veselnitskaya’s goal and that he apologized to Trump Jr. for wasting his time.\nIt has been revealed that Veselnitskaya was actually working closely with FusionGPS and in fact met with FusionGPS’s president Glenn R. Simpson both before and after the Trump Tower meeting and there appears to be evidence that Veselnitskaya had engaged FusionGPS to lobby for the repeal of the Magnitsky Act. (Incidentally, Simpson and FusionGPS, although acting on behalf of Russia and Russian oligarchs never bothered to register as foreign agents, the same thing Special Counsel Robert Mueller is charging Paul Manafort and his partners with.) In the matter of the Trump Tower meeting, FusionGPS was acting on behalf of Perkins Coie LLC, who in turn was acting for the Hillary Clinton Campaign. These relationships make the twenty minute meeting have all the hallmarks of a scam sting.\nIn a statement reportedly made to the London Times, Veselnitskaya said: “Nothing at all about the presidential campaign [was discussed at the meeting. I have] never acted on behalf of the Russian government never discussed any of these matters with any representative of the Russian government.”\nAdd into this tangled web the fact that on July 14, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security revealed that Veselnitskaya, who was considered an undesirable person and prohibited from entering the United States rumored to be due to some previous illegal activities inimical to the interests of the United States, had been granted special entry Visa waivers on multiple occasions in 2015 and 2016 at the request of the DOJ. Such a waiver required the signature of Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who claims no knowledge of Veselnitskaya.\nIn an interview with NBC News, Veselnitskaya stated her June trip involved lobbying against the Magnitsky Act and that she never had any dirt to share on Clinton. After the Trump Tower meeting, she travelled to WashiMagnitsky Actngton, D.C., where she met with several members of Congress on the Magnitsky Act.

Q implies there is meaning in the substitution rather than ignorance. The writer is likely a lawyer. Lawyers use the word “Viva” as short for Vive Voce which has several pertinent legal meanings: It may refer to:(1) Word of mouth; (2) A voice vote in a deliberative assembly (3) An oral examination; (4) Spoken evidence in law; or (5) Related to #1, orally transmitting information.

He was first elected to the Senate in 2008. He is currently a Vice Chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus and the Vice Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Prior to his congressional career, Warner was the 69th Governor of Virginia holding the office from 2002 to 2006. While he was vice-chairman of the Intelligence Committee, the Committee's 56-57 year-old Director of Security James Wolfe was involved in a sexual liaison with a twenty-two year-old New York Times reporter Aly Watkins. During that liaison, Wolfe leaked various information and classified documents to Watkins that should only have been viewed by the Committee Chairman Republican Senator Richard Burr and Vice-Chairman Warner in their unredacted forms, and other classified documents that could be seen by other committee members only in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) environment even when redacted. Among the classified documents that Wolfe provided to Watkins were sealed indictments, the unredacted Carter Page surveillance warrant application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and other unredacted Trump/Russia classified documents. Wolfe has been convicted of lying to the FBI about his relationship to Watkins when he pleaded guilty to that charge on October 15, 2018.

C. correspondent, had a sexual liaison with James Wolfe, now 58 years old, the long time Director of Security for the Senate Intelligence Committee, apparently in exchange for access to classified information and documents the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Oversight was reviewing. Among the classified documents that Wolfe provided to Watkins were sealed indictments, the unredacted Carter Page surveillance warrant application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and other Trump/Russia classified documents provided to Chairman Senator Richard Burr (R) and Ranking Member Mark Warner (D) as well as other Senator members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Oversight under seal, many of which could not be viewed outside of a SCIF facility. While it is not a crime for Watkins to receive these documents, it is a crime for Wolfe to provide them under the espionage acts. Wolfe pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, also a felony, on October 15, 2018, about his contacts with Watkins.

John McCain (R) and some consider (T). McCain was a five term senator from Rino Republican from Arizona. The (T) appellation is for Traitor as some refer to McCain due to his rumored cooperation with his North Vietnamese captors during the Vietnam War. McCain died in office on August 25, 2018. He stubbornly refused to resign despite his deteriorating health so he could vote with the Democrats against President Trump's agenda items up until his death.

Weiner was found in possession of an Apple MacBook Pro laptop that not only had photos of himself in compromising nude positions which he had sent to a fifteen year-old girl, but also, in a folder entitled \"insurance\", several hundred thousand other files including many of the missing email files from Hillary Clinton's email Server from her term as Secretary of State which included much of the deleted and \"bleach-bitted\" classified emails and files the Clinton had sworn were only about Yoga classes and her daughter Chelsea Clinton's wedding.\nThere were other files that are purported to document the \"Pay for Play\" arrangements between the Clinton Foundation and Secretary Clinton's access and policy decisions as Secretary of State, as well as rumored photographic evidence supposedly showing Hillary Clinton's and Huma Abedin's \"Crimes against Children\" of a sexual and worse nature that some say shocked hardened New York Police Detectives to tears and into throwing up. Testimony before Congress revealed that the FBI did only a cursory inspection of the files on the Weiner laptop, looking at fewer than one thousand of the over 360,000 files in the \"insurance folder.\"\nWeiner will be released on parole early in the Spring of 2019 from his five year sentence for sexting a fifteen year old girl and attempting to setup a meeting for sex with her.

Q referred to her right below the line “What is CORRUPTION.” in Q Drop #391. (See Chuck Schumer, D, Democrat, Corruption)\n- Weissmann, Andrew: (#2022, #2092) Andrew Weissman is the lead prosecutor for the Robert Meuller's Office of Special Counsel. Prior to accepting that position, Weissmann had been the chief of the DOJ’s criminal fraud division. He has had previous special counsel team experience when he was brought onto the special prosecutor's team in the Enron where he was lead prosecutor on the Arthur Anderson Accounting Firm case where he created crimes that did not exist to convict the entire company of 80,000 employees in conspiring with the management of Enron in Financial Fraud instead of indicting just a few involved people. Although the case was completely reversed by the US Supreme Court, it was too late to save Arthur Anderson, as it went bankrupt and all 80,000 jobs were destroyed, based on Andrew Weissmann's lie that the company had acted fraudulently, when in fact they had been victims of Enron's hiding the real books from them.\nHe also was the lead prosecutor who, again, created a crime that was not a crime convicting five mid-level managers of Merrill Lynch, a New York Investment Bank, who had bought some power generating barges from Enron and then sold them for a profit six months later to a third party that was, unknown to Merrill Lynch, owned by Enron's treasurer. The government, personified by Weissmann, maintained this was an illegal \"parking\" transaction to \"avoid taxation.\" The various prosecutions cost the government over $15 million. The total sale price for the barges was under $6 million and the profit made by Merrill Lynch was about $657,000, on which taxes of about $160,000 WERE PAID! This in the Enron Case that involved revenues of $100 Billion, and Weissmann was fixated on a single transaction that involved 0.00006% of that revenue.\nYet, somehow, out of this perfectly legal transaction, Weissmann, constructed something that he claimed was illegal. . . yet he could not name a Federal statute. Among the charges for each of the defendants were \"Lying to the FBI.\" All but one conviction was reversed by the Fifth Circuit Court. The only one that was not reversed was a conviction of \"lying to the Grand Jury\" for a mid-level manager at Merrill Lynch who was told by Weissmann to express his opinion of what he understood a phone call that he was not even a participant on was about. . . one in which it turned out the prosecutors BURIED the evidence that his opinion was correct, deliberately not sharing exculpatory evidence with the defense, despite orders from the court to do so, and laws that require it, but of which Weissmann claimed his opinion was somehow a \"lie.\" He had agreed to plead guilty to that charge to avoid a 37 year prison sentence on the other charges based on NON-EXISTENT crimes.\nWe have now learned that before being appointed as Mueller's lead prosecutor, Weissmann was “kept in the loop” by Bruce Ohr about his unethical contacts with Christopher Steele and the FBI, after Steele had been fired by the FBI. Weissmann called a meeting of several AP reporters and leaked to them about Paul Manafort and his Ukrainian business dealings. Shortly after that the AP published an exposé of Manafort, putting the FBI's investigations of the Russia involvement in the 2016 elections at risk, yet Weissmann was still pulled into Mueller's team.

Whitaker's appointment as Acting AG was criticized by Democrats and some never-Trump Republican pundits due to his opposition to the appointment of Robert Mueller as the Trump/Russia investigation special counsel and Whitaker's past vocal and written criticism of the conflicts of interest of both Mueller and the man who had appointed Mueller to that post. Senate Democrat leader Senator Charles Schumer (N.Y.), as well as many other Democrats and some never-Trump Republicans, called for Whitaker to immediately recuse himself from all involvement in the Trump/Russia probe as Sessions had done to divorce himself from all oversight of the Mueller Special Counsel Office and leave Rod Rosenstein still in complete control.

Ergo, it was an \"Inside job\" by someone who had physical access to the DNC servers and not a remote internet hack.

A Federal Grand Jury issued a sealed indictment with 30 charges of Wolff for lying to the FBI in May 2018. The indictment was unsealed and Wolfe was arrested on June 8, 2018. The reporters receiving these leaks, although not named in the indictment, have been circumstantially identified due to details contained in the indictments: reporter-1, is likely Manu Raju of CNN; reporter-2, is definitely Ali Watkins of the New York Times; reporter-3, is likely Marianna Sotomayor of NBC; reporter-4, is likely Brian Ross of ABC. It has how been revealed that Wolfe sent copies of the FISA Warrant application on Carter Page.

Online video repository and streaming video service of user posted content, owned by Google/Alphabet, known for censoring conservative content. Most recently Youtube censored Alex Jones' InfoWars content for \"Hate Speech\" which they cannot or will not define, but generally means anything that is not politically correct according to Liberal or progressive thought. Other content Youtube has censored are hundreds of channels having to do with firearms. Last year YouTube demonetized and shadowbanned \"Diamond and Silk\" two black women who are outspoken Trump supporters, making it almost impossible for their millions of subscribers to see their videos, purely based on their political stance.
