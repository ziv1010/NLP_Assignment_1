Louisville gets their first ever win over Clemson.\nWhile Louisville has accomplished a fair amount since joining the ACC. They’ve produced a Heisman Trophy winner, inserted themselves into the College Football Playoff mix a couple times, and even made an appearance in the league’s title game. One thing they have not done is beat Clemson. The Cardinals are 0-8 against the Tigers, all coming since joining the league in 2014. While Louisville has to travel to Death Valley to face Clemson this season, this is one of their best chances to earn win No. 1 in the series. The Tigers’ run as a true national title contender seems to be in the rear view mirror, partially due to the fact that Dabo Swinney refuses to use the transfer portal, and are coming off of their worst season since 2010. While Clemson is still very talented due to their high school recruiting, they lost a lot of production to the draft and portal, plus their offense was very underwhelming last season as is. A win won’t come easy, but it’s very much on the table.\n—U of L women’s basketball signee Mackenly will play in the Chris Brickley Invitational High School All-American Game on May 11 in Chicago.\n—Louisville has reached out to class of 2026 point guard Dezhon Hall from Indianapolis.\n—Sierra Leone jockey Tyler Gaffalione has been summoned for a stewards’ review after his rough Derby ride.\n—Good interview with Tyler Shough here.\n—The CJ takes an updated look at Pat Kelsey’s top transfer portal targets.\n—ESPN serves up a spring overreaction for each member of its way too early college football top 25.\n21. Louisville\nOverreaction: Tyler Shough will be a star.\nA seventh-year senior, Shough has had a hard time staying healthy throughout his career. But in the spring game, he showed exactly why Jeff Brohm went after him in the transfer portal. Shough played nearly flawless, going 8-of-12 for 177 yards and two touchdowns — that included one score on the first play from scrimmage, a beautiful 80-yard pass to Chris Bell that immediately showed Shough’s arm strength. His predecessor, Jack Plummer, had experience running the Brohm offense, but if there was one thing the Cards did not do it was stretch the field consistently enough.\nShough has the arm talent to do that, and Bell looks poised to be WR1. Louisville wanted to add more receivers through the portal, but even without that, Shough has made major strides over a short period of time in getting acclimated to a new offense and making plays happen. — Adelson\n—Jeff Brohm discusses the challenge of the spring transfer window.\n—U of L has offered class of 2025 DL Kyler “KG” Garcia from Nashville.\n—I enjoy these rankings.\n—Some of the best soccer clubs in the world are coming to Louisville in August to play in this year’s Women’s Cup.\n—The CJ has 19 places in Louisville to get brunch or dinner with mom this weekend.\n—Louisville checks in at No. 22 in The Athletic’s post-spring college football top 25.\n22. Louisville\nJeff Brohm was brought to Louisville to make this program great again, and he got off to a heck of a start last year, leading the Cardinals to the ACC Championship Game. Louisville had one of the best portal classes of the cycle, headlined by quarterback Tyler Shough. The Cards also have a potential first-round pick on the defensive line in Ashton Gillotte.
