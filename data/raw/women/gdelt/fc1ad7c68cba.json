Everything, that not just football fans love, but everyone in the world.\"\nWhy is the 2034 Saudi Arabia World Cup so controversial?\nThere are a myriad of reasons why the 2034 World Cup being hosted by Saudi Arabia is so controversial.\nOne aspect is the country's shocking human rights record. Gender equality in Saudi Arabia is another hot topic, with women and girls severely restricted in what they are able to do, while there is no free press and homosexuality is illegal. These issues were raised ahead of the Qatar World Cup but often fell on deaf ears.\nStaging the World Cup has been considered by many charities and human rights activists as an attempt from Saudi Arabia to \"sportswash\" their reputation and image, using sport to cover up the controversies and issues within the country.\nThe decision-making process has also come under fire. Saudi Arabia's was the only bid for the 2034 World Cup, with FIFA changing their criteria and eligibility for host nations. The governing body stated that the tournament had to be held in Oceania or Asia due to the 2030 World Cup being held across three continents (Europe, Africa and South America), thus limiting the amount of competition and number of viable bids that could rival Saudi Arabia's.\nNot only this, FIFA also shortened the time allotted to those preparing bids to just 25 days, meaning many countries couldn't put together a proposal in time. Unsurprisingly, Saudi Arabia launched their bid almost immediately after said rules were put in place.\nWhen will 2034 FIFA World Cup take place?\nNo official dates have been released regarding the 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia but reports have suggested that the competition will be held in the winter months.\nMuch like the Qatar World Cup in 2022 that was staged in November and December, the high temperatures and humidity in Saudi Arabia mean a winter tournament is likely.\nWhile Saudi Arabia have refused to rule out the possibility of a summer World Cup, a mid-season tournament seems far more likely at present.",
