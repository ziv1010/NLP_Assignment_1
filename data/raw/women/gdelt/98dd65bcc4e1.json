We will discuss with FAM to make sure we continue with this project. We will also look at men’s football,” he said.\nFAM president Fleetwood Haiya said it was encouraging to note that the Goshen-FAM regional and national championships continue to unearth and polish women’s football talent in the country.\nHe also urged the corporate world and organisations to join FAM and Goshen City in promoting women’s football, which has a great potential of making the country proud at continental and global competitions.\n“Special thanks to Prophet Bushiri for the financial investment into the tournament. With the support, we have made significant steps in developing women’s football. We hope others will also see the potential that women’s football has,” the FAM president said.\nNational Women’s Football Association chairperson Adelaide Migogo said the fact that there were a lot of surprises in this year’s edition proves women’s football is growing fast in the country.\nThe latest edition saw minnows Mzuzu-based Topik Sisters finishing in the top-four and Blantyre giants FCB Nyasa Bullets Women failing to get past the quarter-final stage.\nIn the final, Ntopwa drew first blood in the 15th minute through Kondawu Banda, the eventual Player of the Tournament, before Ireen Khumalo drew level for Silver Ladies from a direct free-kick six minutes to time.\nKhumalo was red-carded after taking off her shirt in celebration of her goal, subsequently reducing her team to 10 players. This was her second bookable offence.\nMidway through the match, it rained heavily but the quality of action on the pitch remained catchy and entertaining.\nWhen it came to the dreaded post-match penalties, Silver Ladies missed twice while Ntopwa flopped once to eventually win the title and relive their experience in the 2022 edition when they triumphed 5-3 over Ascent Academy on spot-kicks after full-time ended 1-1.\nNtopwa coach Isaac Jomo Osman, whose team received K9 million first prize, said: “This is unbelievable. It is exciting to be back as champions and flag carriers at the Cosafa Champions League.”\nSilver Ladies coach Andrew ‘Aluki’ Chikhosi hailed his charges for putting up a gallant fight, saying it was just unfortunate that they missed the opportunity of becoming Goshen national champions for the first time.\nPrevious champions Ascent Academy finished third after thrashing Topik Sisters 6-0 in third-placed match with Faith Chimzimu hitting a hat-trick to win the golden boot with a total of six goals. Leticia Chinyamula, Marriam Mnenula and Fatima Lali scored the other goals.",
