  "body_text": "Papua New Guinea is seeking a new coach to take charge of the Orchids at the World Cup in 2026 after parting ways with Tahnee Norris.\nThe Papua New Guinea Rugby Football League announced that Norris would not continue as head coach of the Santos PNG Orchids by mutual agreement.\nWith the 2026 Rugby League World Cup set to be hosted in Papua New Guinea and Australia in October and November 2026, PNGRFL will immediately commence a thorough recruitment process to identify and appoint the next head coach for the Orchids.\nPNGRFL Chairman, Sandis Tsaka, said this transition marked an important step in the team’s preparations as the Orchids look to build on recent achievements and represent PNG with pride on the world stage.\nThe Orchids will play two matches at Port Moresby’s Santos National Football Stadium, against France on October 17 and Fiji on October 24, before travelling to the Gold Coast on October 31 to face the Kiwi Ferns.\nPNG were semi-finalists at RLWC21 in England, losing to the Jillaroos, and are now ranked No.5 in the latest IRL World Rankings behind Australia, New Zealand, England, France and Samoa.\nTsaka expressed gratitude for Norris’s significant impact during her tenure.\n“On behalf of PNGRFL and the entire rugby league community in PNG, I want to sincerely thank Tahnee for her dedication, experience, and tremendous effort over the past years,” he said.\n“Tahnee has played a pivotal role not only in leading the Orchids but also in developing the women’s game across the country. We wish Tahnee every success in her future pursuits and thank her for her legacy within PNG Rugby League.”\nUnder the leadership of Norris, the Orchids have participated in the 2024 Pacific Cup against Australia and New Zealand and the 2025 Pacific Bowl against Cook Islands and Tonga.\nTsaka said a feature of Norris’s leadership was the focus on developing young players, with more 10 players making their Test debuts during her tenure, including 19-year-old fullback Fleur Ginn and halves Caitlin Tanner and India Seeto.\nBackrower Josephine Howard is considered a star of the future.\n“I’m incredibly proud of how far this group has come,” Norris said. “Watching our young players step onto the international stage and prove they belong has been one of the most rewarding parts of my role.”\nNorris, who has also coached Queensland women’s team in State of Origin since 2021, is the most capped Jillaroo after playing 33 Tests between 1998 and 2013.\nShe was among the first six female players inducted into the NRL Hall of Fame in 2024, along with Karyn Murphy, Katrina Fanning, Veronica White, Natalie Dwyer and Tarsha Gale.",
