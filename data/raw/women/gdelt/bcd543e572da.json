  "body_text": "Everton fans' behaviour saw them banned from matches\nThe club says its updated approach has resulted in a marked increase in enforcement action\nTwo men have been banned from attending football matches for three years. Everton FC supporter Stephen Connolly made tragedy chants during a Merseyside Derby, landing the 62-year-old from Kirkby with a three-year football banning order.\nAnthony Kane, 38, from Norris Green, was the second Everton FC supporter to be banned from attending football matches for three years on Monday, February 2. He was convicted of possession of cocaine at the Manchester City vs Everton match on October 18.\nThe men are just two of the 72 people so far this season who have been banned from attending Everton home or away games for offences including assault, threatening behaviour, racist, homophobic or discriminatory language or gestures, and smoking within the stadium.\nEverton Football Club has enhanced its safety and reporting systems to strengthen the club’s ability to identify and address anti-social behaviour across both home and away fixtures.\nThe club says its updated approach - combining upgraded technology, improved CCTV coverage, clearer reporting routes and strong cooperation from supporters - has resulted in a marked increase in enforcement action during the first season at Hill Dickinson Stadium and beyond. Greater confidence among supporters to report concerns promptly has also played a key role in this progress.\nThis figure represents three times as many suspensions as were issued during the final season at Goodison Park, which is said to reflect the effectiveness of the new systems rather than an increase in incidents.\nIt said since August 2025, 14 supporters have received football banning orders following court convictions, with a further 57 cases currently progressing through the courts or subject to police updates, which are expected to result in additional banning orders for the most serious offences.\nIn recent weeks, enforcement actions have included the convictions of Connolly and Kane, and the banning of a supporter pending a club and Merseyside Police investigation following a violent altercation at a recent home fixture.\nAs a club, Everton currently has 83 supporters subject to football banning orders of varying lengths, underlining the firm stance being taken in partnership with law enforcement to tackle serious misconduct.\nEverton remains committed to maintaining a safe, inclusive and welcoming environment for all supporters and continues to work closely with fans, stewards, security teams and law enforcement across all competitions.\nEverton’s head of security and stadium safety officer, Dave Lewis, said: “I want to thank both home and away supporters for the role they continue to play in helping us identify and address anti-social behaviour.\n“Our aim is always to create an atmosphere that best supports our players, but we will not tolerate violent, anti-social or discriminatory behaviour of any kind. This conduct comes from a very small minority and does not reflect the incredible support we see week in, week out at both men’s and women’s home and away fixtures.\n“Behaviour at away matches can also impact a supporter’s ability to attend home games, and we will continue to work closely with fellow clubs and law enforcement to ensure consistent standards are upheld across all competitions.”\nEducation is an important part of the club's strategy for tackling abuse and discrimination. Everton’s most recent home fixture was dedicated to the club’s All Together Now campaign, with supporters continuing to learn about its impact through matchday content, programme features and in-stadium activations.\nSupporters who witness anti-social behaviour, harassment or discrimination are encouraged to report it by speaking to a steward or police officer, or by using the club’s confidential reporting channels.\nIncidents can be reported to the stadium safety team by texting HELP and details of the incident and location to 84300, or by emailing reportit@evertonfc.com.\nGet all the big headlines, pictures, analysis, opinion and video on the stories that matter to you by signing up to our daily and breaking newsletter.\nSign up to our breaking news newsletter here.
