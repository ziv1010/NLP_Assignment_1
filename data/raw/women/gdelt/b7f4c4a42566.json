Willman uses his unbelievable trickster skills to pull off a whole range of devilishly comical pranks that will amaze you. With some help from a team of twisted pranking professionals, Willman pulls open his box of mind-blowing tricks on unsuspecting targets and even helps settle a few old scores. This looks like the perfect Netflix show for families.\nStream on Netflix from April 1\n'Ripley'\nA new take on Patricia Highsmith’s classic character, Tom Ripley, this Netflix series will see Andrew Scott step into the eponymous role as the suave conman. Set in the ‘60s, the show sees Ripley travel to Italy after being hired by a wealthy tycoon to convince his wantaway son to return home and take up a position within the family business. Those familiar with Ripley’s (mis)adventures will know that this leads to a complex tale of deception, fraud and even murder. The cast also includes Dakota Fanning and John Malkovich in supporting roles and the show comes from the mind of Steven Zaillian, who co-created HBO’s criminally under-watched “Night Of” mini-series that was critically acclaimed back in 2016.\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\nStream on Netflix from April 4.\n'The Antisocial Network: Memes to Mayhem'\n4chan is one of the most infamous websites on the internet. The anonymous messaging board has generated some of the most viral memes ever created, but it’s also become a platform that has spread real-world chaos from the rise of QAnon to the January 6th riots. This Netflix documentary explores how a group of bored teenagers built an online community that developed into an unstoppable beast that has changed the world, and not exactly for the better.\nStream on Netflix from April 5\n'Unlocked: A Jail Experiment'\nIn the face of sky-high recidivism rates and challenging jail conditions, Arkansas sheriff Eric Higgins has a radical idea: What if he gave the prisoners in his care more freedoms instead of less? Allowing these incarnated men to come and go from their cells as they please and decide themselves how certain aspects of the prison unit are run, Higgins hopes to foster a sense of personal responsibility. But while some rise to the occasion and seek to build order, other prisoners opt instead to sow the seeds of chaos. Through candid interviews and unrestricted access, “Unlocked: A Jail Experiment” explores a unique social experiment and asks if Higgins’ unconventional methods were ultimately successful.\nStream on Netflix from April 10\n'What Jennifer Did'\nNetflix has become the streaming home of unmissable true crime, and “What Jennifer Did” is the latest shocking documentary that will hook Netflix subscribers. This twisting feature-length doc comes from Jenny Popplewell (who previously made 2020’s \"American Murder: The Family Next Door\"), and centers on Jennifer Pan, a young woman who endured a night of sheer terror when intruders broke into her parent's home, tied her up and shot her mom and dad. The local community were shocked that Jennifer endured such a horrific ordeal but as authorities investigated this seemingly random crime, it became clear that Jennifer knew more about what happened that night than she claimed.\nStream on Netflix from April 10\n'The Circle' season 6\n“The Circle” returns to Netflix this month so check your DMs and remember that you never quite know who you’re speaking to online. If you’ve never watched “The Circle” it’s a reality competition where contestants move into individual apartments in a large complex and must communicate with each other via a social media app. Players can be truthful and present themselves honestly, or they can create a character, and use deceptive means to gain influence. As the social experiment continues, contestants are voted off via a secret rating system. The goal is to become the top influencer and win a huge cash prize. “The Circle” is always a drama-filled blast, and will premiere with four episodes on April 17 followed by weekly drops through May 8.\nStream on NetflixNetflix from April 17\n\"The Upshaws\" part 5\nIt’s time for a reunion with the chaotic Upshaw family as Netflix's comfort-watch sitcom returns for its fifth outing. Wanda Sykes, Kim Fields and Mike Epps lead a talented comedic cast in this straightforward but very charming show set in Indianapolis. Netflix is labeling this as “Part 5” but it’s essentially the second half of the show’s third season, and will contain six episodes. Don’t expect any major twists as “The Upshaws” isn’t that kind of show, but Netflix is promising a few surprises for dedicated viewers. Plus, fans will be pleased to know the sitcom has already been renewed for a fourth season so this won’t be the last we see of the Upshaws either.\nStream on Netflix from April 18\n\"Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver\"\nTo be blunt, the first “Rebel Moon” movie wasn’t very good (it scored just 21% on Rotten Tomatoes), so the general hype levels for “Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver” seem muted at best. However, director Zack Snyder has a legion of passionate fans who will no doubt be eager to watch this sci-fi epic as soon as possible, and perhaps it’ll be a rare sequel that betters its predecessor. This follow up will pick up where the first “Rebel Moon” left off and see Kora (Sofia Boutella) and her allies face an enemy they thought defeated: The villainous Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein). Expect lots of visual spectacle and plenty of hammy dialogue.\nStream on Netflix from April 19\n'Boling Point’ season 1\nAfter being served up in its native Britain last year, the U.K.’s answer to “The Bear” arrives on Netflix U.S. this month. Set in a fine dining restaurant in Manchester, England, “Boiling Point” is a stressful drama that will have you never wanting to work in the service industry. It primarily centers on the restaurant’s head chef, a determined cook named Carly (Vinette Robinson), who is working overtime to keep her staff employed and the lights switched on. Despite her best efforts, the pressures of running an eatery in tough conditions take their toll, and exhausting shifts lead to heated exchanges, costly mistakes and traumatic moments.\nStream on Netflix from April 29\nEverything new on Netflix in April 2024\nSynopses provided by Netflix\nAPRIL 1\n\"The Magic Prank Show with Justin Willman\" (Netflix Series)\nFamed magician and comedian Justin Willman uses his extraordinary skills to pull off ambitious and hilarious pranks like you've never seen before.
