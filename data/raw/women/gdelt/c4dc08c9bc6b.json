Yet when asked by a young fan about Princess Charlotte's absence, the future king shared a surprising piece of information regarding his little one's education.\nThe sweet exchange occurred during the memorial event in Portsmouth on Wednesday, when William crossed paths with the great-granddaughter of Captain Alastair Bannerman, a soldier involved in the D-Day Landings, after recounting an excerpt from his diary. Upon completing the reading, William struck up a conversation with the young girl, asking her \"Do you like the Red Arrows? \", in reference to the fantastic aerial show overhead.\nIt was at this point that a woman accompanying the little Royal enthusiast remarked: \"I think she was going to ask you where Charlotte was,\" as it so happened, the young lady was a massive fan of the princess, who wasn't present at the time. Without skipping a beat, William cleared up her absence by revealing: \"Charlotte's at school! \" Going a step further to satiate the curious mind before him, he knelt down and spilled: \"Charlotte's got exams.\"\nLike many children around the country, Charlotte was studying hard for her exams and sitting them this week, which meant she was sadly unable to attend the memorial, something it turned out she wasn't all that happy about. \"Yes, she had tests. She wasn't looking forward to the school day,\" admitted the Royal dad, before crossing his fingers in a clear wish of good luck for his only daughter as he added: \"Hopefully it's all gone well.\"\nThe latest comments are yet another glimpse at the close bond shared between Royal father and daughter, as Prince William and Princess Charlotte have often delighted fans in recent years after being spotted in several heart-warming moments together. Among some of the most memorable occasions to date include the moment she sweetly reached out to her dad for a hug on the Buckingham Palace balcony at last year's Trooping the Colour ceremony, and when the pair teamed up together to offer a message of support to the women's England football team, The Lionesses ahead of their championship games last Summer, reports the Mirror.\nAlthough Princess Charlotte is busy with her exams this week, she is far from the only royal to have struggled with them in the past, Kate Middleton shared a revelation about Prince George being fed up with constant testing, last year. During an October visit to a Welsh high school, the Duchess confided: \"George is just at the beginning of being tested. He says, 'Mummy, I keep getting tested all the time.' But when it gets to A-levels you feel like you're on it,\" as quoted by The Sun.\nPrince George's heavy exam schedule compelled Kate to forgo joining Prince William for his Earthshot Prize Awards in Singapore last November, as she chose to stay at home to back him up in Windsor.",
