  "body_text": "Uganda Crested Cranes defender Shadia Nankya has completed a move to the National Women Super League in the United States, Kawowo Sports can reliably confirm.\nIn a what is a landmark move for Women Football in Uganda, Nankya has signed a four-year deal with Washington Spirit.\nWashington Spirit is one of the teams that has played in the NWSL since its inception in 2012 and won their first League title in 2021.\nCurrently, the team is under the stewardship of former Barcelona Women FC coach Jonatan Giraldez.\nIt should be noted that the National Women Super League is ranked as the best division in the world.\nNankya has been plying her trade at FC Masar in Egypt where she performed remarkably, being one of the key players on the team since joining them at the start of last year.\nNotably, she helped guided the team to a third place finish on their debut in the CAF Women’s Champions League and was named in the team of the tournament alongside compatriot Aisha Nantongo who also plays for the same club.\nThe move to Washington Spirit will see Nankya hit two birds with one stone, continuing with her football career but also furthering her studies.\nNankya broke to the scene as a teenager with Uganda Martyrs Lubaga Women Football Club in 2016.\nThe towering defender would eventually break into the Crested Cranes (Women’s National Team) two years later playing at the 2018 CECAFA and COSAFA Championships where Uganda scooped bronze at both tournaments.\nNotably, in her final year at Uganda Martyrs Lubaga, Nankya despite playing as a defender managed to win the top scorer’s gong in the FUFA Women’s Cup with 9 goals.\nIn 2019, the fearless defender joined UCU Lady Cardinals, where she played until last year before moving to Egypt.\nNankya had to recover from a nagging knee injury in 2021 that forced her to miss Uganda’s participation at the 2022 CECAFA Women’s Championship and 2022 Africa Women Cup of Nations (WAFCON).\nWhereas there have been female footballers that have moved to USA in recent years, Nankya becomes the first Ugandan to play in the top tier league.\nSandra Nabweteme, Sandra Nantumbwe, Sharon Naddunga, Tracy Jones Akiror, Asiat Naluggwa, Joan Nakirya and recently Patricia Akiror are some of the Ugandan female footballers who have played in the USA but at College level.",
