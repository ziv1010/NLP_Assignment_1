  "body_text": "The EU's 27 member countries are expected to study a proposal to impose sanctions against two far-right Israeli ministers at a meeting later this month, after Sweden's foreign affairs minister wrote a letter to the bloc's foreign policy chief calling for action.\nThe letter was sent to Kaja Kallas as the UK, Canada and other western nations introduced an asset freeze and a travel ban against Israeli Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich for inciting violence against Palestinians.\nIn the letter, Swedish Foreign Minister Maria Stenergard, who did not refer to the two by name, said that the European Council should \"urgently decide on targeted sanctions against Israeli ministers who promote illegal settlements activities and actively work against a negotiated two-state solution.\"\nThe letter, dated June 10, was made public on Thursday as Ms Stenergard held a media briefing in Stockholm in which she described Israel's blockade of humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza, and restriction of aid distribution inside the enclave, as a war crime.\n\"There are strong indications right now that Israel is not living up to its commitments under international humanitarian law,\" she said. \"It is crucial that food, water and medicine swiftly reach the civilian population, many of whom are women and children living under wholly inhumane conditions.\"\nAt the media briefing, Ms Stenergard highlighted the shifting mood within Europe, which has become increasingly critical of Israel's 19-month military operation in Gaza that has been compounded by settler violence in the occupied West Bank.\nMost EU countries last month backed a Dutch call to review the EU-Israel Association Agreement over concerns that Israel may have breached its human rights obligations. Ms Kallas's office is currently conducting the review, which may result in a partial or total suspension of trade relations.\nSweden, like many EU countries, does not have a national sanctions regime and only issues sanctions through the bloc in a process that requires a unanimous decision by its 27 member states.\nYet unanimous support of sanctions against Mr Ben Gvir and Mr Smotrich is unlikely. Some EU countries remain firmly in support of Israel, including Germany, Italy, Greece and Hungary. The latter has blocked numerous proposed EU sanctions against extremist Israeli settlers for months.\nAn EU Commission representative on Thursday said that Ms Kallas had received Sweden's letter but declined to comment on its content.\nNo EU country joined the UK, Canada, Australia, Norway and New Zealand in sanctioning Mr Ben Gvir and Mr Smotrich earlier this week, despite expectations that France would follow suit. Paris last month co-signed a statement with the UK and Canada threatening sanctions over the Gaza war.\nThe French Foreign Affairs Ministry has \"taken note\" of Sweden's letter, a representative said on Thursday, adding that France believed that it was best to discuss sanctions with other EU countries and not take action at a national level.\nFrance has imposed sanctions against Israelis in the past without the EU. In February, Paris announced measures against 28 extremist Israeli settlers, including travel bans and asset freezes, after a similar announcement by the UK.\nThe French representative said the Swedish letter would \"obviously be discussed\" at the next meeting of EU foreign affairs ministers in Brussels on June 23.\n\"We have not hesitated in condemning the remarks of the two ministers,\" the representative said.\n\"But it seems to us that, in terms of reaction to Israel and what's happening in the Gaza Strip, the European dimension is important.\"\nCritics have said that such sanctions have been ineffective in influencing decisions taken by the Israeli government and military, particularly in Gaza.\n\"A majority of Israelis, as public opinion polls indicate, support the slaughter and are even waiting for the population transfer that is to come in its wake,\" wrote columnist Gideon Levy in an op-ed published by Israeli daily Haaretz on Wednesday.\n\"Therefore, the pressure and the punishment must be directed at Israel in its entirety.\"",
