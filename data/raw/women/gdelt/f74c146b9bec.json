  "body_text": "England boss Sarina Wiegman admits they need \"plan B\" vs Brazil without key player\nWiegman will be looking to make it 30 games unbeaten since taking charge of the Lionesses in 2021 - and make it four trophies in the bag by picking up the first ever Finalissima at Wembley\nSarina Wiegman says England will move to \"plan B\" in defence without Millie Bright for their clash with Brazil at Wembley.\nThe England boss is also expecting the Brazilians to provide a much tougher test than the ones posed at the Arnold Clark Cup in February.\nWiegman will look to win a fourth trophy with the Lionesses in tomorrow night's Finalissima with the South American champions at Wembley. But the Selecao will be desperate to make a big statement by ending Wiegman's lengthy unbeaten run as England boss, just three months away from the start of the World Cup.\nThe Lionesses will have to cope without Millie Bright, a stalwart of the Euro-winning side, after she pulled out with injury last week. The Chelsea centre-half is expected to see a specialist about a knee problem picked up against Lyon two weeks ago.\n\"Millie isn’t here,\" said Wiegman. \"Of course I wanted her to be available but she has played so many games for us and Chelsea. So we have a plan B ready for when she is not available and we’ll see that tomorrow.\n\"It is disappointing but on the other hand it is opportunity to see our team when she is not playing.\n\"The first Finalissima will be a great occasion, we'll have 90,000 people here. We expect to be challenged a lot more in defence (by Brazil) than we were at the Arnold Clark Cup.\n\"That gives us a lot more information about our team ahead of the World Cup. I think it is going to be a very exciting evening.\"\nWiegman also gave her reaction to two women from English and Welsh Football Associations being appointed to the FIFA council and UEFA's executive committee on Wednesday. Football Association chair Debbie Hewitt has made history by being elected as the British vice-president on the FIFA Council, while Professor Laura McAllister CBE FLSW has been appointed to UEFA's executive committee - becoming the first Welsh woman to do so.\n\"Of course we want more women in the game,\" said Wiegman. \"Lots of changes are underway I would say, but this is another example that we want even more in those positions. It is really good news though, particularly that Debbie Hewitt is the vice-president.\n\"We have to make women part of the decision-making process. Let’s make it an even better place for women in football.\"\nAt the previous international camp, Wiegman gave every outfield member of her squad minutes during the Arnold Clark Cup. However, the England boss hinted that there won't be as much rotation this time around, against higher ranked opposition in Brazil and Australia over the next week\n\"We’ll experiment a little less,\" Wiegman added. \"Partly that is because we only have two games. But we’ll also need to manage the load of the players a little bit. So it is a little bit of balance. But we always play to win.\n\"We are in a period where the players have many games and the load is really high, so we'll manage that too. After the Brazil game we'll see how the team is and what we still need to see.\"\nTomorrow night marks the second time England have returned to Wembley since their memorable Euro 2022 final victory over Germany last summer. It is not their only game of this international window, with the Lionesses facing Australia at Brentford on Tuesday night at the Gtech Community stadium\nNEW! Our Year: European Champions 2022 - The Official England Winners Book\nWith a foreword by England manager Sarina Wiegman, this is the only official book of the historic triumph, reliving every kick of a thrilling tournament and telling the stories of the players who made it all happen.\nOrder from https://reachsportshop.com/book/our-year-european-champion-2022/",
