Follow along as we check in with them each month in the build-up to the tournament, tracking their progress as they prepare both mentally and physically for a chance to shine on the game’s biggest stage.\nAdvertisement\nTrusting the process is the attitude Nigeria’s head coach Randy Waldrum is trying to instill in the team throughout his tenure.\nRecently, that process included a seven-game losing streak, dating back to July 2022 when Nigeria lost on penalties to Morocco in the semifinal of Women’s Africa Cup of Nations. For the Super Falcons, trust meant letting go of their quest to win a 10th WAFCON title and looking towards the bigger picture: a successful campaign at the Women’s World Cup in July, starting with the 2023 Women’s Revelations Cup in León, Mexico.\nComing off two narrow 1-0 losses to Mexico and Colombia, Nigeria snapped its losing streak with a win against Costa Rica. Forward Ifeoma Onumonu started all three matches and played 238 minutes as the team’s center forward.\nOnumonu is trusting the process and staying present\nShe said it’s easy to get caught up in the results, but Nigeria has to understand the games leading up to the World Cup are part of a journey.\n“(We’re) trying to stay focused and dialed into what we’re trying to build,” Onumonu told The Athletic. “I think everyone goes out to win the game. But ultimately, this is a team sport so … you can try to go out there and get the game yourself, but it’s going to take a team effort in order to progress and get to where we want to be by World Cup time.”\nMaking the most of each game and camp will be crucial to Nigeria’s goal of advancing out of a tough group B and reaching the knockout stage of the tournament – something the Super Falcons have only done twice in their history, making the quarterfinals in 1999 when the tournament only had 16 teams and the round of 16 in 2019. No African team has made it to the semifinals of the tournament in its 32-year history.\nWith only 142 days until the first match of the World Cup, the opportunities to call Nigeria’s squad into camp are limited to two more international windows – one in April and one in June/July before the tournament.\nAdvertisement\nThe 23 players will come from different playing styles and leagues around the world. One thing Onumonu concentrated on during the February window was creating on-field chemistry with her teammates. Frustrations can and do arise from a squad that doesn’t often play together, but she says the key to overcoming them is learning the strengths of each player and having conversations.\nThe win over Costa Rica in their final game of the Women’s Revelations Cup was a result of building team chemistry during the window.\n“We played our best against Costa Rica,” Onumonu said. “I think that came because, over the last nine days prior, it was trying to figure out how to play our best within the system (and) playing in a way we know within this new system that we’re given.”\nAlong with building chemistry on the field, Onumonu is still adjusting to the team’s culture off the field, as she previously told The Athletic.\nGrowing up in Southern California and American soccer culture, Onumonu experienced an environment more focused on the individual rather than the collective, like her Nigerian-born teammates. Despite the cultural differences, Onumonu says there are always good vibes around the camp and she enjoys singing with the team.\nThe Super Falcons have arrived at @Q2Stadium 🇳🇬 pic.twitter.com/b9sYvj5ITo\n— U.S. Women's National Soccer Team (@USWNT) June 16, 2021\nThe other key to her game, staying present, is a mentality Onumonu is constantly and consistently working toward developing.\n“I have to kind of take a step back and realize that it needs to be like a day-to-day and moment-to-moment thing as well,” she said.\nIt also means a change in how Onumonu views competition.\n“It sounds crazy, but I feel like we kind of get caught up in that competition,” she said, “but in an almost negative way.”\nAdvertisement\nInstead of trying to make fewer mistakes than her teammates, she is focused on playing to the best of her abilities.\n“That’s been like my focus in my way of trying to stay present day to day,” Onumonu said.\nIn February, Onumonu rejoined her NJ/NY Gotham FC teammates in Florida to prepare for the upcoming NWSL season. With a chance to make Nigeria’s final World Cup roster, Onumonu looks to return to her form from the 2021 season when she was tied for the league’s most goal contributions (eight goals and four assists) and earned a spot on the Best XI Second Team.\nA new NWSL season on the horizon also means new opportunities for Onumonu to continue her work as a board member of the Black Women’s Player Collective. Recently the collective gifted four HBCU women’s soccer teams Therabody equipment to help with recovery work. Onumonu said they chose recovery equipment because HBCUs are often forgotten about and don’t get the same resources as other universities. The initiative has a two-fold impact: to give HBCU student-athletes equipment and to shine a light on programs many people don’t know about.\nThough Onumonu is still working on her goals for this year, growing on and off the field with Nigeria, Gotham and BWPC are at the top of her list.\n“The Journey to the Cup” series is part of a partnership with Google Chrome.\nThe Athletic maintains full editorial independence.
