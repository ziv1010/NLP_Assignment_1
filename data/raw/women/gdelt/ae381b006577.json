The east Sussex club famously operates both it men's and women's team on equal budgets and penned an open letter to women's football review chair Karen Carney this week on the subject of equal prize money in the FA Cup - the fund in the women's competition this season is £3m, while for the men it totals nearly £20m.\nUnited, having been knocked off the top of the WSL by Chelsea in their last outing, will be hoping to get back to winning ways in what was the most favourable tie available to them at this stage.\nLewes, who have sold out of tickets for this one and have assigned United a 15% designated away allocation, are currently seventh in the Championship, only one place higher than the Durham side that United beat 5-0 in the previous round of the competition.\nThese sides haven't met since 2018/19 when United won 2-0 and 5-0 at home, being presented with the Championship trophy after the latter game.\nWhere to watch Lewes vs Man Utd on TV/live stream\nWhen is kick off? Sunday 19 March, 12:30 (GMT)\nWhere is the match being played? The Dripping Pan\nTV channel/live stream? BBC iPlayer/Red Button (UK), FA Player (International)\nReferee? Stacey Fullicks\nLewes team news\nLewes were missing Ellie Hack, Jamie Rita and Lauren Heria in their recent Championship defeat to London City Lionesses. The Rooks have a couple of on-loan Chelsea youngster to call on in forward Emma Thompson (pictured above) and defender Charlotte Wardlaw.\nMan Utd team news\nFull-back Jayde Riviere is still the only player missing for Marc Skinner. The Canadian started training with the squad on Tuesday and is expected to progress to full sessions next week.\nFellow January arrival Lisa Naalsund is waiting for her debut after remaining an unused substitute against Leicester and Chelsea this month - she wasn't available before that.\nThere is potential for some changes to the team that started against Chelsea, with Vilde Boe Risa, Estelle Cascarino, Adriana Leon and Aissatou Tounkara also among those hoping for opportunities.\nLewes vs Man Utd score prediction\nMarc Skinner has stressed that United won't take this tie lightly in terms of preparations, despite the obvious mismatch between the sides in terms of league positions, and is expecting Lewes counterpart Scott Booth to want to have the ball and play.\nBut this weekend's hosts have struggled for goals in the league this season and that isn't a good sign going up against the second meanest defence in the top flight. Even with potential changes, United should also still have the quality - as was seen against Durham - to secure a comfortable win.\nPrediction: Lewes 0-4 Man Utd\nFor more from Jamie Spencer, follow him on Twitter!",
