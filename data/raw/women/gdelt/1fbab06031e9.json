We’re taking you into the convoluted land of World Cup qualifying today. It’s kicking off.\nOn the way:\n- Saudi Arabia and Qatar qualification anger\n- Turkish refs betting drama\n- Xabi Alonso’s Madrid ‘rift’\n- Painting dressing rooms pink\nWorld Cup furore: Saudi Arabia and Qatar had home advantage and extra rest before games\nUnderstanding the Asian section of World Cup qualifying demands the patience of a saint or a world-class IQ (neither of which is in my locker). If I told you there were 46 nations and four separate group stages to allocate slots at the finals — and that an additional round sends one more country to the last-chance saloon of the intercontinental play-offs — I’m assuming you’d lose the will to live.\nAdvertisement\nJacob Whitehead had a spirited go at making the framework intelligible, and the reason he did so was that the progression of two Asian Football Confederation (AFC) teams to the 2026 World Cup is causing a stir. In the face of a qualifying path so complicated, it would be impressive if controversy didn’t flare up somewhere down the line. Slightly inevitably, it has.\nThe complaints surround Saudi Arabia and Qatar, both of whom have secured their spot at next summer’s tournament. They will be in the United States, Canada and Mexico — stick with me here — by virtue of topping their groups in round four, and they’re the latest of eight qualifiers from the AFC zone, following Japan, Iran, Uzbekistan, South Korea, Jordan and Australia.\nHere’s the problem. In theory, the round-four fixtures should have been held at neutral venues. Instead, and for reasons that have not been explained to the satisfaction of anybody, the Saudis and Qataris had home advantage, which they made the most of. Iraq were pipped by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates lost out to Qatar.\nYou might have picked up on the tie between Qatar and the UAE because at the end of it, UAE fans invaded the pitch and rioted. Footage of the trouble spread across social media. On top of the choice of venues, the Saudis and Qataris had three more days’ rest before the decisive matches. The losing teams are crying foul.\n‘This is not fair play’\nIt’s well known that Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as examples of football’s changing geopolitical order, are close to the centre of World Cup affairs. Qatar hosted the tournament in 2022 amid criticism of its human rights record. Saudi Arabia will stage it in 2034 after succeeding with an unopposed bid to FIFA. It also faces scrutiny on human rights grounds.\nUnsurprisingly, Iraq and the UAE, believing the fourth qualification round was weighted against them, are questioning why home advantage existed. As UAE coach Cosmin Olaroiu pointed out, an easy solution would have been for the group involving the Saudis to be based in Al Alrayan, and the group containing Qatar to play their games in Jeddah. “All teams should have an equal chance,” he said.\nAdvertisement\nHe wasn’t the only manager angered by the lack of neutrality. “This is not fair play,” Oman’s Carlos Queiroz complained.\nQatar hosting the World Cup and ceaseless investment in the Saudi Pro League mean those two countries have some of the best facilities in the Middle East. That’s fair to point out, but the opaque logistics have left a bad taste.\nIraq and the UAE now meet over two legs next month in the AFC’s fifth and last round, then that tie’s winners will hope to be one of the two nations to make it through to the finals from the six-team intercontinental play-offs in March. Because truly, this road to 2026 never ends.\nNews round-up\n- Four fans of Brazilian side Flamengo are in a serious condition after a bus travelling to Argentina for a Copa Libertadores tie against Racing overturned in Rio de Janeiro. Forty-six people were injured.\n- An RB Leipzig supporter, meanwhile, has died following a medical emergency before last night’s DFB-Pokal away game against Energie Cottbus.\n- Spain and Germany are through to the final of the Women’s Nations League. The Spaniards won the 2024 title and the smart money is on them retaining it.\n- An amateur player in England suffered a fractured skull after being attacked during a match on Saturday. The incident took place in the Liverpool Premier League, a 12th-tier division.\n- Football’s lawmakers are considering rule changes that, among other things, could allow VAR interventions on second yellow cards. At present, VAR can only overturn straight red cards.\nReferees in gambling scandal: Turkish FA reveals 317 active officials have betting accounts\nA potentially significant scandal is brewing in Turkey, where conspiracy theories stalk referees. The distrust of them won’t be helped by dramatic revelations about betting practices there.\nOn Monday, the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) used a press conference to shine a light on the gambling habits of the country’s match officials. It revealed that of the 571 who are currently active, 371 have betting accounts. Of those, 152 actively gamble. One of them, incredibly, has placed more than 18,000 bets in the five years since 2020.\nThose being investigated include seven referees and 15 assistants who work in Turkey’s Super Lig, its top division. The competition is continuing, but there are calls for it to be suspended. Alongside TFF’s investigation, prosecutors are probing the matter, too. No names have been given, and it isn’t clear if any of the officials involved gambled on games they participated in, but we’ll stay tuned to developments. The implications of this story could be seismic.\nTrouble brewing in Madrid?: Alonso facing early dressing-room rift\nFrom a distance, I’d regard Real Madrid as being in a happy place. They are five points clear of arch-rivals Barcelona at the top of La Liga and they’re quietly chipping away in Europe. Coach Xabi Alonso has made a good fist of taming the beast.\nAdvertisement\nSo it surprised me to read Mario Cortegana’s report of a rift developing between Alonso and senior members of his dressing room. Sure, we saw Vinicius Junior’s tantrum after he was substituted in Sunday’s Clasico win against Barca, but I assumed the squad would be warming to a head coach who is making them tick. Apparently not.\nSwitching to Alonso from his predecessor, Carlo Ancelotti, was bound to be a sharp gear change. Ancelotti is a people person who accommodates the whims of his pros, sometimes altering tactics depending on their wishes. Alonso is less touchy-feely, a man with a defined identity. Life is more disciplined and he’s said to be stricter. Player entourages are no longer as free to knock around Madrid’s training ground.\nOne source put it like this to Mario: “He thinks he’s Pep Guardiola, but for now, he’s just Xabi.” And of course, Alonso has plenty to prove, but under Ancelotti last season, Madrid limped behind Barca in La Liga. They were pulverised by Arsenal in the Champions League. It wasn’t happening, and if I were a fan at the Bernabeu, Alonso’s internal battle is one I’d want him to win.\nAround TAFC\n- Fans of Football Manager 26 will enjoy Ajay Rose’s suggestions of clubs to pick. Dutch side Vitesse, with a points deduction and next to no cash, sound like an inviting challenge.\n- Norwich City once painted their away dressing room pink to try to psychologically affect their opponents. I watched Leeds United make a mockery of it by routing them 3-0. Does applying dark arts to visitors’ facilities work?\n- For the first time in 727 days, Sam Kerr was back captaining Australia, but couldn’t inspire her side in a 3-0 defeat against England last night. The road in between has been long and fraught. Charlotte Harpur was there to watch her.\n- I still can’t get my head around the savage statement from leading shareholder Dermot Desmond that accompanied Brendan Rodgers’ sacking at Celtic. It’ll be spoken about for a long time. Michael Walker explains how the atmosphere at Parkhead became so toxic.\n- Most clicked in Tuesday’s TAFC: Lionel Messi’s call for MLS changes.\nCatch a match\n(Selected games, kick-offs ET/UK time, all 3.45pm/7.45pm unless stated)\nCarabao Cup, round of 16: Arsenal vs Brighton, Liverpool vs Crystal Palace, Swansea City vs Manchester City, Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Chelsea — all Paramount+/Sky Sports; Newcastle United vs Tottenham Hotspur, 4pm/8pm — Paramount+/Sky Sports, ITV.\nDFB-Pokal (German Cup), second round: Koln vs Bayern Munich — ESPN, Fubo (U.S. only).\nSerie A: Inter vs Fiorentina — CBS, Paramount+, Amazon Prime, DAZN, Fubo/DAZN.\nMLS: LAFC vs Austin, 10.30pm/2.30am — MLS Season Pass/Apple TV.\nAnd finally…\nThe first round proper of the Netherlands’ KNVB Cup got underway last night. How did it go for VVV-Venlo in their tie against Heerenveen? The best way to answer that is to treat you to the third goal in their 3-0 defeat, above. It’s pretty special as blunders go.
