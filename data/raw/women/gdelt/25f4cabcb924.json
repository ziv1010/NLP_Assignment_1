  "body_text": "POPE FRANCIS: Last appeared in public on Sunday with an Easter blessing and popemobile tour through a cheering crowd in St. Peter’s Square. PHOTO COURTESY OF WIKIPEDIA\nPope Francis died Monday at age 88. The Vatican said Francis suffered a stroke which led to a coma and his heart to fail, as he recovered from a ﬁve-week hospitalization for double pneumonia.\nHistory’s ﬁrst Latin American pontiff charmed the world with his humble style and concern for the poor but alienated many conservatives with critiques of capitalism and climate change.\nFrancis recently returned to the Vatican after 38 days in a hospital for a respiratory crisis that developed into double pneumonia, the longest hospitalization of his 12-year papacy. He last appeared in public on Sunday with an Easter blessing and popemobile tour through a cheering crowd in St. Peter’s Square. No funeral date has been announced. The next pope is yet to be decided.\n\"I hope that whoever comes after him can be as competent, as affectionate and as loving,\" said Mary Soul, a Christian resident of Aleppo, Syria. Here’s the latest: “Remarkable life”\nBill and Hillary Clinton celebrated Pope Francis’ \"remarkable life and legacy promoting peace, economic inclusion, and social justice and ﬁghting climate change.\"\nThe former U.S. president and secretary of state said Francis’ pontiﬁcate was \"extraordinary,\" recalling his endeavor \"to embrace the entire world\" — including people of different faiths, those not always welcomed in the church, and anyone struggling.\n\"By his own example, he taught that every human being’s personal search — even a pope’s — for a purposeful life was meaningful and important, and that power and politics must always make room for compassion and coexistence,\" they said in a joint statement.\nEiffel Tower tribute\nWith clouds descending over the last glimmer of the setting sun, the Paris monument extinguished its sparkling lights for a moment of memory.\nBells tolled across predominantly Catholic France when the pope’s death was announced, including at the recently restored Notre Dame Cathedral. Grieving Catholic believers and tourists paid respects as the cathedral held special Easter Monday services.\nNotre Dame rector Olivier Ribadeau Dumas recalled how Francis was \"the pope of the poor. He is the one who invited us to live the Gospel in its radical form.\"\nTrump to attend funeral.\n\"Melania and I will be going to the funeral of Pope Francis, in Rome. We look forward to being there!\" Trump said on social media.\nClosing up the pope’s formal apartment at the Apostolic Palace is a key part of Catholic tradition after the death of a pope. Ofﬁcials draped a red ribbon through the door handles on Monday afternoon, then poured liquid wax on the bow and impressed Francis’ papal seal on the wax to hold the knot.\nIt wasn’t immediately clear whether church leaders also closed off Francis’ other apartment in the Domus Santa Marta, where Francis had chosen to live since his 2013 election. The hotel is for visiting priests and guests, as well as a residence for some priests who work at the Vatican.\nA ﬁnal call to Gaza\nFrancis had a frequent evening ritual during the war in Gaza. He would call the territory’s lone Catholic church to see how people huddled there were coping.\n\"He called us last time, it was Saturday, Holy Saturday, two days ago, and he asked us to pray and gave us a blessing and thanked us for all the service for peace,\" said the Rev. Gabriele Romanielli at the church in Gaza City.\nThe pope in his last public appearance on Sunday again called for a ceaseﬁre between Israel and Hamas. Only 1,000 Christians live in overwhelmingly Muslim Gaza. Some prayed for him on Monday.\n\"The pope was our biggest support after God in this war,\" said 19-year-old Suheil Abu Dawoud.\nVatican: Cause was stroke\nThe Vatican said Francis suffered a stroke which led to a coma and his heart to fail, as he recovered from a ﬁve-week hospitalization for double pneumonia. It also said the pope had decreed that he will be buried in St. Mary Major Basilica in a simple underground tomb. The basilica is home to Francis’ favorite icon of the Virgin Mary, to whom he was particularly devoted.\nThe Vatican has begun a Rosary prayer in St. Peter’s Square in its ﬁrst public commemoration following Pope Francis’ death. Cardinal Mauro Gambetti, archpriest of St. Peter’s Basilica, led the prayer as the sun set.\nThe ﬁrst reading was delivered by Sister Raffaella Petrini, president of the Vatican City State and one of the highest ranking women at the Vatican. Her appointment was a sign of Francis’ insistence that women be given more prominent, decision-making roles.\nSouth Sudan Churches\nThe South Sudan Council of Churches says it remembers with gratitude Francis’ visit to the country and his \"dedicated efforts to promote healing and unity among our leaders.\" The pope once famously knelt and kissed the feet of rivals President Salva Kiir and deputy Riek Machar, which the council called \"a profound act of humility.\" Tensions continue, however, recently raising fears of a return to civil war.\nPutin: Timing “a special sign”\nRussian President Vladimir Putin in televised remarks noted that the pope died immediately after Easter, suggesting that \"this is a special sign that the person has lived their life not in vain and has done a lot of good.\" Putin said Russians will always remember his \"highly positive attitude to Russia.\" Earlier, he said the pope encouraged the development of a dialogue between the Russian Orthodox and the Roman Catholic Churches.\nThe archbishop of Buenos Aires, Jorge Ignacio Garcia Cuerva, has told journaists that \"we are a bit orphaned.\" He also said the Argentine Francis was famous for asking people to pray for him. \"Then he would say, ‘And if you don’t have faith? Still, send good vibes my way.’\"\nThe archbishop said it couldn’t have been easy for Francis to learn to be a \"father to the world.\"\nAddress to Congress\nFrancis became the ﬁrst pope to address the U.S. Congress. It was a pivotal moment in bitterly divided Washington in 2015. He called on lawmakers to create a \"culture of care\" in welcoming immigrants, protecting the environment and sharing the nation’s wealth with those less fortunate.\nThe pope later spoke from a Capitol balcony, greeting thousands with \"buenos dias.\"\n\"I spoke this morning to my newsagent who told me his mother, who is a Hindu, loved Pope Francis,\" said Patrick Somerville, as mourners knelt before a portrait of Francis at London’s Westminster Cathedral to offer prayers. \"And I think that says it all.\"\nIn Francis’ hometown of Buenos Aires, Argentines gathered for Mass. Some cried. \"I think he was a rebel. He may have been contradictory, but that was nice, too,\" said worshiper Catalina Favaro.\nBishop Jorge García Cuerva told those gathered that \"the pope of everyone has died. The pope of all humanity who insisted one and a thousand times that there must be room for everyone.\"\nThe pope’s beloved soccer team — Buenos Aires club San Lorenzo, who nickname is \"The Saints\" — wrote \"Goodbye, Holy Father\" on its website. The team won the national championship in 2013, the year Francis was elected pope.\nBiden and Obamas\nFormer U.S. President Joe Biden says Francis was \"unlike any who came before him. Pope Francis will be remembered as one of the most consequential leaders of our time, and I am better for having known him.\" Biden, who is Catholic, called the pope a \"challenging teacher\" and \"above all, he was a pope for everyone.\"\nBiden had planned to visit Francis one more time before leaving ofﬁce, but the trip was canceled because of wildﬁres in the Los Angeles area.\n\"Pope Francis was the rare leader who made us want to be better people,\" former U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, said. \"He shook us out of our complacency and reminded us that we are all bound by moral obligations to God and one another.\"\nMixed emotions in Ukraine In Ukraine, there was a mix of sorrow and hope. \"From a human point of view, it’s sad, of course,\" said Valentina Soﬁlkanych in Lviv. \"But as a Ukrainian, I hope the next Pope will be more pro-Ukrainian, we will feel more support from the church.\" Francis tried to maintain the Vatican’s traditional diplomatic neutrality during the war there.\nMeaning in small details\n\"He was a pope who was humble. When he visited Kenya, he rode in a very simple car,\" said Ted Mutuku, a Catholic in the capital, Nairobi.\nVoices from the Middle East The leader of the Catholic Church in the Holy Land, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, said Francis was always deeply interested in the region, and Gaza was \"a symbol of Francis’ pontiﬁcate,\" with the pope \"always close to the poor, against the war.\"\nThe Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem will hold a requiem mass on Wednesday with leaders of other major Christian sects.\nIn the occupied West Bank, Bethlehem Mayor Anton Salman said Francis worked to \"restore the value and meaning of humanity.\"\n“World’s conscience”\nThe pope was \"in many respects the world’s conscience, never hesitating to challenge the powerful on behalf of the vulnerable,\" said Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is Catholic. He noted the pope’s visit in 2022, when he apologized for the church’s cooperation with Canada’s policy of Indigenous residential schools, saying the forced assimilation destroyed their cultures.\nBrazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said the pope \"tirelessly sought to bring love where there was hatred. Unity where there was discord. And the understanding that we are all equal, living in the same house, our planet, which urgently needs our care.\" Francis visited in 2013.\nSoccer-loving pope\nGianni Infantino, president of soccer’s world governing body FIFA, noted the pope’s love for soccer and said that \"all the prayers of the whole football world are with him.\"\nItalian President Sergio Mattarella said Pope Francis’ ﬁnal public act – an Easter morning blessing and popemobile tour through a crowd of thousands in St. Peter’s Square – in retrospect seems like his ﬁnal goodbye to the church.\nSexual abuse criticism\nCritics of the Catholic Church’s handing of clergy sex abuse say the pope did far from enough.\n\"Where Francis had supreme power, he refused to make the necessary changes,\" said Anne Barrett Doyle, codirector of the U.S.-based group BishopAccountability.\nDavid Clohessy, former national director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, noted the pope’s \"prompt and impressive action\" on other matters but said the pope’s \"genial personality and warm demeanor distracted many from the unhealthy and still essentially unaddressed structural and cultural flaws in the church that cause kids to keep being hurt.\"\nChurch grows in Africa\nMany across Africa have said they felt connected with the pope, who often spoke about issues at the heart of the region, from climate change to marginalization.\nThe pope was \"very unambiguous in telling world powers to stop exploiting Africans,\" said the Rev. Michael Nsikak Umoh, spokesperson for the Nigerian bishops’ association.\nIn Congo, where pope visited in 2023 to demand that foreign powers stop plundering Africa’s natural resources, Abbé Camille Esika in the capital, Kinshasa, said Francis \"wanted to be the voice of the voiceless.\"\nThe pope visited Africa ﬁve times, acknowledging the strong growth of the Catholic Church there. The South African Catholic Bishops’ Conference has encouraged all Catholics to pray for those choosing his successor.\nU.N. chief praises the pope’s example of ‘mutual understanding’ United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a statement recalls that Pope Francis once said: \"The future of humankind isn’t exclusively in the hands of politicians, of great leaders, of big companies … (it) is, most of all, in the hands of those people who recognize the other as a ‘you’ and themselves as part of an ‘us.’\" Guterres adds that \"Our divided and discordant world will be a much better place if we follow his example of unity and mutual understanding in our own actions.\"\nPublic ﬁnal respects\nThe Vatican says the general public likely could begin paying ﬁnal respects to Pope Francis starting Wednesday in St. Peter’s Basilica, to be conﬁrmed when cardinals gather for the ﬁrst time after Francis’ death Tuesday morning.\nFrancis’ cofﬁn will be moved from the chapel of the Domus Santa Marta hotel where he lived to St. Peter’s Basilica for public viewing. In a change ordered by Francis, the pope’s body will no longer placed on an elevated bier in the basilica. Rather, the wooden cofﬁn will be placed facing the pews.\nNo date for the funeral has been announced. It must be held between four and six days after the death.\nTrump condolences\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says Vance’s team expressed \"how excited and grateful they were for the opportunity to have met with the pope just yesterday.\" In an appearance on Fox News, she added that \"it’s a solemn day for Catholics around the world, and we are praying for all those who loved the pope and believed in him.\"\nPresident Donald Trump posted on Truth Social: \"Rest in Peace Pope Francis! May God Bless him and all who loved him!\"\nThe Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama offered prayers, saying Francis dedicated himself to the service of others, \"consistently revealing by his own actions how to live a simple, but meaningful life. The best tribute we can pay to him is to be a warmhearted person, serving others wherever and in whatever way we can.\"\nOrthodox Christian unity Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople, the leader of the Orthodox Christians, said Francis’ wish was for a greater unity with the Orthodox, calling him \"a genuine friend of Orthodox Christianity.\"\nHe mentioned their meeting in 2014, in which Bartholomew told Francis of the upcoming 1700th anniversary of the First Ecumenical Council and invited him, saying Francis \"appeared enthusiastic.\" But \"it was not to be,\" Bartholomew said, adding that he would welcome Francis’ successor. Iran’s president commends Francis’ position on the war in Gaza Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian offered condolences and praised Francis’ humanitarian stance including support for \"innocent Palestinian women and children\" in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\nIrish leader says Francis recognized every human’s essential dignity Irish President Michael Higgins says Francis’ recognition of the \"essential dignity\" of every human being helped him confront issues such as climate change and the plight of migrants, as well as the child sexual abuse scandal that has rocked the church. During his last visit in 2018, Francis spoke about the scandal that has undermined support for the church in the once overwhelmingly Catholic country.\n\"On such matters, and on others such as attitudes towards women and those of the LGBTQ+ community within the Church, Pope Francis sought to play a\npositive role,\" Higgins said. \"I recall at the end of our meetings he would say as to his work on such issues, ‘it is very difﬁcult’, as he asked for and offered prayers.\"\nWorld Jewish Congress\nThe president of the World Jewish Congress, Ronald S. Lauder, described Francis as \"a true moral leader, a man of deep faith and humanity, and a steadfast friend to the Jewish people.\" Lauder noted that in 2022, the congress’ executive committee had a private audience with the pope \"where we launched the historic ‘Kishreinu’ (Our Bond) initiative, marking a new chapter in Catholic-Jewish relations and reinforcing the common future of our two peoples.\"\nChurches in the Philippines, the largest Roman Catholic nation in Asia, rang their bells to mourn Francis.

The faithful gathered in St. Peter’s Square, where bells tolled.\nEva Bonnano, from Philadelphia, called it \"a very sad day. It is honestly impressive, I think, that he made it to Easter, I think that is almost like a miracle for Italy.\"\nJohann Xavier said he had traveled from Australia, hoping to see the pope. \"But then we heard about it when we came in here. It pretty much devastated all of us.\"\nPraying for peace\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country grieves with Catholics and all Christians who looked to Francis for spiritual support. \"He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians. Eternal memory!\" Zelenskyy wrote on social media. Head of US bishops says Francis will be remembered for outreach Archbishop Timothy P. Broglio, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said Francis will long be remembered for his outreach to those on the margins of the church and society: \"He renewed for us the mission to bring the Gospel out to the ends of the earth and offer divine mercy to all.\"\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer described Francis as a courageous leader who reached out to people of all beliefs during a \"complex and challenging time.\"\n\"He was close to the realities of human fragility, meeting Christians around the world facing war, famine, persecution and poverty.
