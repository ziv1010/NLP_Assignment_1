The league's first round of expansion included Bay FC and the Utah Royals for the 2024 season, with each franchise paying a $53 million fee, along with Boston Legacy for the 2026 season. A second expansion process brought in Denver Summit FC, also for next season.\n'We've been through these two rounds, and so we pretty much know the universe of people who are interested -- there's more than a dozen of them,' Berman said, per Sports Business Journal. 'Those conversations are ongoing and each of them have a different perspective on how much time they need to launch and the investments they need to make in order to be successful, including potentially around infrastructure.\n'We want to not force a square peg into a round hole. We want to be more flexible so that we can get to the best possible result for the next round.'\nCities expected to be interested in adding a NWSL franchise include Cincinnati, Nashville, Philadelphia, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Atlanta, Jacksonville and St. Louis.\nBerman, whose four-year contract expires at the end of this season, is reportedly expected to sign at least a short-term extension.\n'What I can say is that I intend to be here,' she said. 'I joined this league because I believe in the future of women's sports and professional women's soccer. That's all I can say.'\n--Field Level Media\nShares\nShare\nTweet\nShare\nFlip\nEmail\nGet a daily dose of Colorado Star news through our daily email, its complimentary and keeps you fully up to date with world and business news as well.\nPublish news of your business, community or sports group, personnel appointments, major event and more by submitting a news release to Colorado Star.\nMore InformationBhubaneswar (Odisha) [India], September 19 (ANI): The Odisha government has taken a significant step towards strengthening its statistical...\n(Photo credit: Jay Biggerstaff-Imagn Images) Tom Brady's dual role as minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders and primary NFL color...\nDUBAI, 18th September, 2025 (WAM) - The Community Development Authority in Dubai (CDA) has achieved new global recognition after being...\nAbu Dhabi [UAE], September 18 (ANI): The Ministry of Commerce and Industry said that the Central Banks of India and the UAE are advancing...\nNew Delhi [India], September 18 (ANI): A national workshop on strengthening financial management in Urban Local Governments (ULGs)...\nAB Digital Media New Delhi [India], September 18: India's bond market stands at an unprecedented inflection point in 2025, having...\nBEIJING, China: Tensions between China and the Philippines flared again this week after a confrontation near the contested Scarborough...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: More than half of America's healthcare workforce is preparing to leave their current jobs, a new survey shows.
