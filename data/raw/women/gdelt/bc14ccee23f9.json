This [can] really put us on the map and show that we’re more than just a HBCU soccer team–and we’re here to compete.”\nHBCU Women’s Soccer Invitational: Empowering Women Athletes\nHosted at the home of D.C. United (MLS), DC Power FC (USL Super League), and the Washington Spirit (NWSL), the inaugural invitational saw each team mark their first time playing in a professional stadium, setting the tone for a fiery matchup.\nThe Lady Bison and Lady Pirates met around this time last year at Powhatan Field in Norfolk, Virginia. The game resulted in a scoreless draw but this time, the Lady Bison, the reigning Northeast Conference (NEC) champions, came swinging in full force defeating the Lady Pirates.\nMeanwhile, Hampton, touting a 16-member recruiting class, encompassing players from five continents, eight countries, and six states, faced Howard, a seven-member recruiting player, including one coming from Ontario, Canada, 24 returners with championship mindsets encompassing HBCU and NEC honors.\nWith locked-down defenses on both sides, much of the first period remained scoreless until Bison sophomore forward Sinclaire Green prevailed with her first collegiate goal before halftime.\nThis marked the beginning of a trend that would soon carry post-intermission, tripled by goals from the reigning NEC titleholders: sophomore forward Gabriella Garcia-Terrell (Rookie of the Year), Rachel Suttle (Defensive Player of the Year), and a pivotal assist from James, reigning NEC Midfielder of the Year.\nFor Garcia-Terrell, coming into the Aug. 17 match meant channeling the spirit of resilience and collaboration that propelled the Bison to an NEC championship last year. The star rookie noted some of the pre-game conditioning centered around elevating game fitness and tactical and structure work, such as building upon formation and chemistry to establish a precedent for the team going forward.\n“I think that’s really what a pre-season is about,” she told The Informer, “getting on the same page before the actual season.”\nFurther, the invitational comes at a time of unprecedented success for women’s sports all around.\nFrom sold-out stadiums to record-breaking viewership, including the Washington Mystics’ recent 34% surge, visibility and engagement in women’s sports is seeing an integral rise with events like the soccer invitational setting the backdrop.\nThe added importance, according to Danita Johnson, president of business operations for D.C. United, is ensuring HBCU talent is a part of the continued growth.\n“This historic matchup between Howard and Hampton is a milestone that highlights the power of women’s sports and the importance of diversity in athletics,” Johnson said in a statement. “To see these talented student-athletes take the field at Audi Field is a testament to the growth of HBCU women’s soccer. We are honored to provide a professional stage for this inspiring moment.”\nForging New Paths for HBCU Sports\nIn addition to building team morale, Hampton director of athletics Anthony Henderson said fronting the inaugural invitational presents a two-fold opportunity on both ends: dawning a new legacy for HBCU athletics, and amplifying the principles of these institutions as a whole.\nA former football player of the Virginia university, Henderson emphasized how athleticism can showcase the wealth of excellence that exudes a historically Black education, exemplifying “that we’re just as good as everybody else,” especially in today’s times.\n“We’re in a unique situation where, if we’re really good at certain sports, and not just the revenue sports…it’s going to be more than a local story,” he said, highlighting Howard’s Swim and Dive Sports Illustrated cover following the league’s NEC win in 2023. “It’s those types of opportunities that winning and being successful brings, not only to the athletic department…[but] so people can see all the other great things that are going on on campus.”\nThe athletic director parallels James’ vision to see opportunities like the invitational forge a new mindset among young athletes of color, notably one where they can “especially look at Hampton” while considering their collegiate careers.\nPartnered plans to continue developing a “pathway-to-pro” pipeline— further investing in more playing opportunities in women’s professional soccer— include: DC Power FC working to host a joint training session with the winning team in spring 2026; an event featuring executive women leaders that intersect the HBCU and pro soccer communities; and a trial opportunity for an upperclassman seeking a future pro contract, according to the press release.\nBeyond Sunday’s invitational, Henderson and Brent Leiba, head coach of Howard University’s women’s soccer team and the 2024 Northeast Conference Coach of the Year, tout similar hopes to create a legacy where all Black athletes prosper.\n“These games matter, not just for the athletes on the field, but for the visibility and growth of women’s soccer across our communities,” said Leiba in a press release, “especially in communities who see themselves in our players.”",
