  "body_text": "September 2023 is here and as is standard the gaming industry is going into overdrive. For the next few months Xbox and Game Pass players will be given the chance to get hands-on with some of the biggest games of the last few years, one of which is possibly the most anticipated of the decade. But what are the best new Xbox and Game Pass games to release in September 2023?\nThis is the month when Starfield finally releases, onto Game Pass for good measure. We’ve also got the hotly anticipated Lies of P, the super niche, but super exciting Train Sim World 4, some krazy kills as Mortal Kombat takes it back to the beginning, and even an expansion to Cyberpunk 2077, the previous ‘most anticipated game of the decade’. Oh, and FIFA is back. Isn’t it?\nWhat will you be playing from this little list?\nStarfield – Coming to Game Pass\nLet’s get it out of the way then.\nEspecially as it launches day one onto Xbox and PC Game Pass, we are sure that most will be blasting off into Starfield in September. Bethesda’s first new IP for years is bound to be absolutely huge, and the promise of over 1000 explorable planets backs this up.\nWhether you decide to follow the main story and explore the universe as a member of the explorer’s guild Constellation, choose to go your own path and become a space pirate, and simply mine away resources for days on end, the choice really is yours. After all, would you expect any different from the makers of Skyrim and Fallout 4?\nStarfield will surely be up on GOTY lists come December, and we simply cannot wait to take our own spaceship into the unknown.\nChants of Sennaar\nThis one looks bizarre, to say the least.\nExplore an incredibly colourful cel-shaded world in Chants of Sennaar, and attempt to decode an ancient language that is spoken throughout the game. In many ways similar to Tunic, in which you had to figure out the game’s systems through cryptic clues and indecipherable language, Rundisc and Focus Entertainment’s new title puzzles you.\nThe Peoples of the Tower are in dire need of connecting together again, and only you can do so by decoding their language, solving all number of environmental puzzles, and using stealth to avoid the dangerous Guardians along the way.\nWill you get lost in the labyrinth, or manage to make your way through to victory? Find out this month in Chants of Sennaar.\nThe Many Pieces of Mr. Coo\nAnd if you thought that Chants of Sennaar looked strange, that’s got nothing on The Many Pieces of Mr. Coo.\nDevelopers Gammera Nest have crafted a unique point-and-click puzzle adventure that places wacky cartoon sprites onto more realistic backgrounds. The result is a world that looks to be straight out of Salvador Dali’s imagination.\nThe star of many funny short films by artist Nacho Rodríguez, Mr Coo gets his video game outing, accompanying you through a series of colourful situations. In order to progress, you must solve some innovative and surreal puzzles.\nTrust us, your mind will be well and truly boggled.\nNBA 2K24\nShootin’ hoops is the preferred sporting past-time of many in the gaming sphere, and we can say with a lot of certainty that NBA 2K24 will take the world by storm. But who are we kidding? Every fresh basketball release from 2K is a hit, and the new instalment will iterate upon 2K23.\nBoasting of ultra-real gameplay attainable with the power of modern consoles, with particular improvements to 1-on-1 situations, this looks to be the best way to experience the NBA and WNBA from your home.\nThere’s also a massive overhaul to MyCAREER to look forward to, with an expansion to the City that many players spend countless hours in. What’s more, your own pro will be shaped by their actions both on and off the court – be on your best behaviour, now!\nThe Crew Motorfest\nWelcome to the Motorfest – a sprawling festival celebrating the best of vehicles. Sound familiar? Yes, The Crew Motorfest may be taking a hint of inspiration from the Forza Horizon series, and the scaled-down Hawaiian island of O’ahu it calls home may be a nod to the Test Drive Unlimited franchise, but that’s not such a bad thing.\nAt the end of the day, Ubisoft’s next racer is going to have fast cars, a huge open world to explore, and the opportunity to do it all with your own crew.\nThe sequel to 2018’s The Crew 2, The Crew Motorfest once again allows you to tear up the streets in all manner of cars. In addition, you can glide across the water in boats, and soar through the skies in a multitude of planes.\nSocialising is at the heart of The Crew, and it will be very easy to group up with some mates, and take in the themed campaign missions together. So let’s hit the streets!\nMortal Kombat 1\nIt was perhaps inevitable that NetherRealm would one day take the krunching Mortal Kombat series back to its roots. After countless entries into the fighting series, Mortal Kombat 1 presents an origin story to many of the iconic kharacters.\nGameplay-wise, perhaps the biggest addition to the fighting is the tag-teaming that goes on. Before each match, you’ll be able to recruit a Kameo fighter to the battle, who can jump in to disturb play. Use them to extend your own combo, disrupt an opponent’s, or to finish off a kombatant on low health. We can’t wait to figure out the meta and bring this into online play.\nOf course, no Mortal Kombat game will be complete without a bunch of terrifically gory fatalities. Catch us watching MK1 fatality compilations in no time!\nLies of P – Coming to Game Pass Day One\nLies of P launches this month, straight onto Xbox and PC Game Pass for good measure. This action-packed soulslike throws you right into the Belle Epoque era as a troubled puppet. The city of Krat is your home, and a web of lies and deception lies at its heart.\nFight against terrifying eldritch horrors in tense and tight combat, where any move could be your last. Wield huge weapons capable of dealing devastating amounts of damage. The locales that you will journey through in Lies of P look stunning, with dark and drab backgrounds being lit up by your attacks.\nElden Ring and Dark Souls fans, look no further.\nAnd to think, all he wanted to do was to be a real boy…\nCyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Expansion\nWake up V. Your time is not over – it’s time to jump back into Cyberpunk 2077 with the Phantom Liberty Expansion!\nThis enthralling spy-thriller will have you on the edge of your seat, as you attempt to save the actual President of the United States. Her orbital shuttle has been shot down over Night City, so you must head back to its neon-soaked streets to save her. When infiltrating the enclaved city of Dogtown, dominated by a militia all too happy to shoot your brains out, you will need your wits about you to survive.\nWith Keanu Reeves’ Johnny Silverhand making a return, alongside Solomon Reed, played by Idris Elba, Phantom Liberty has a star-studded cast to guide you with.\nWe cannot wait to jump back into Night City – perhaps a full re-run through the game is in order?\nTrain Sim World 4\nIf all you have ever wanted was to experience the best in the train world, journeying across their world with their mechanical might behind you, Train Sim World 4 is the one for you.\nThe fourth instalment in the sim series, Train Sim World 4 provides train-fans with even more opportunities to ride their favourite vehicle. Iterating upon features laid out in previous titles, Train Sim World 4 also adds brand new experiences. For one, you’ll be treated to the country of Austria for the first time, adventuring across the countryside on the S-Bahn Vorarlberg Line.\nMany players will simply be enjoying their time in the game’s expansive free roam, experiencing the joys of train driving in super-realism.\nAll aboard, for Train Sim World 4! Grab it from the Xbox Store.\nWhateverland\nAnother colourful puzzle game with point-and-click gameplay? Sign us up!\nWhateverland releases this month, and is from the brains of Caligari Games. You’ll be playing as Vincent, who finds himself trapped in Whateverland after a thieving job goes wrong. He’s been imprisoned by the witch he attempted to steal from, and as a result must team up with Nick to organise an escape.\nBut how do you go about breaking out of a parallel universe? That’s a question for you to answer, with a branching dialogue system, as well as a spot of sports, helping you through the journey. With multiple endings to the chaos on offer, Whateverland is perfect for repeat playthroughs as you aim to see it all.\nIf you can’t wait, grab a look at the free Whateverland Prologue in order to prepare yourself.\nPaleo Pines\nOne for the kids (or the kid inside us all), Paleo Pines is a bright dinosaur romp through a charming and friendly world. Evolution on the island of Paleo Pines went a bit different, as humans and dinosaurs coexist, in harmony no less!\nYou have befriended Lucky, believed to be the last of her species. But can you find other Parasaurolophus around the world?\nA main feature to be found within Paleo Pines is a farm-sim, in which you’ll build your own unique ranch. Lay down plants, decorate your ranch with paths and other decorations, and truly make Paleo Pines your home!\nWildmender\nIf you prefer your farm-sims with less dinos and more godly spirits, then might we interest you in Wildmender? With an expansive desert for you to explore on your lonesome or with online friends, Muse Games’ newest title chucks you into a vast desert, and tasks you with keeping yourself and your squad in tip-top shape.\nAs well as nurturing your own farm, you must defend your land from the threat of wraiths, who seek to destroy everything in their path. Everything could be gone in an instant – fail to prepare, prepare to fail!\nEA Sports FC 24\nMaking its way to us towards the end of the month, EA Sports FC 24 (better known as FC 24) is the brand-new instalment in EA’s long-running football series. It’s essentially FIFA 24, albeit without the ability to call itself that!\nNevertheless, FIFA fans will feel immediately familiar with what is found within FC 24. The usual graphical improvements are here, powered by the innovative Frostbite engine, as is the huge draw that is Ultimate Team.\nNotable changes have been made to the gameplay, with HyperMotion V depicting every player on the pitch with their unique playing style. Expect to see Haaland leaping for crosses like he does every game for Manchester City, and Chelsea’s Raheem Sterling tearing it up on the wings with his signature running style.\nNew leagues are also on their way, not least in the women’s game. This opens up even more opportunities to play the beautiful game.\nUsher in a new era of football with EA Sports FC 24.\nThe best Xbox games for October excite too\nFor us, the thirteen games listed above should well be seen as the best new Xbox and Game Pass games for September 2023. There’s obviously a chance many will fall by the wayside thanks to the sheer draw of Starfield, but for those not looking for a space epic, there are tons of other options.\nAnd October 2023 isn’t going to be letting up either. It’s just as blockbuster packed in fact. Expect to find Hellboy Web of Wyrd, Cricket 24, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, Lords of the Fallen, Alan Wake 2, Sonic Superstars, Gangs of Sherwood, Ghostrunner 2 and Jusant all hitting the wishlists.\nFor now, go and get Starfield installed and prepare to lose any sleep you may have planned.",
