  "body_text": "DraftKings has more than 30% of the U.S. online sports betting market share. Operating in 21 states, its data provides a significant window into the behavior – and success – of U.S. sports bettors. And its recently released 2023 EOY sports betting insights are illuminating.\nSuper Bowl champions, the Kansas City Chiefs, were DraftKings’ most bet on team in 2023. Yet, the Chiefs were also the biggest bankroll breakers – the team that lost bettors the most money in 2023. The most money was wagered on the Philadelphia Eagles. While the most money was won by Baltimore Ravens bettors. And as expected, the Super Bowl was the most bet on game of the year.\nMeanwhile, Travis Kelce might be the apple of Taylor Swift’s eye, but he was the player that cost DraftKings bettors the most money. Meanwhile, the Titans’ Derrick Henry won the most money for bettors.\nThe NFL also claimed DraftKings biggest parlay payout, totaling a stunning $489,383.01.\n14-leg parlay turns $5 bet into $489,000+\nTravis Dufner hit the Christmas miracle of parlays on DraftKings this year. The 32-year-old placed a $5 bet on a 14-leg anytime touchdown parlay for Week 16 NFL games at +9787560.\nOn Saturday, Pittsburgh Steelers running back Najee Harris and Buffalo Bills receiver Gabe Davis started the journey off right. By Monday night, Dufner had hit 13 of the 14 legs. All he needed was a Christian McCaffrey touchdown in Monday night’s game between the San Francisco 49ers and Ravens – which came right before halftime.\nThe $489k winner watched it all unfold in the Santa outfit 🙌🎄\n— DraftKings Sportsbook (@DKSportsbook) December 26, 2023\n(via: @br_betting) pic.twitter.com/S34e5mBU9S\nOther sports, however, offered ample long-shot opportunities. MLB provided the top two winning prop bets. The odds on the exact result for the Texas Rangers beating the Arizona Diamondbacks in the World Series were +150000, while the odds on the exact results of the Diamondbacks beating the Philadelphia Phillies for the National League pennant were +100000.\nThe most bet on MLB player was Trea Turner, the Phillies shortstop who set a record in 2023 for the most stolen bases in a season without getting caught. But it was MLB pitcher Zach Wheeler who was the most lucrative for MLB bettors.\nWhile the vast majority of DraftKings’ action was on men’s sports, one women’s sport made the highlights. The most money wagered on a soccer match in 2023 was the June 10 match between Man City and Inter Milan. But matches from the FIFA Women’s World Cup claimed the next two spots. The July 26 match between the U.S. and the Netherlands drew the second highest amount wagered on a soccer match in 2023. Meanwhile, the Aug. 8 match between Sweden and the U.S. came in third.\nNext year should be another growth year for sports betting, providing even more legal resources for Americans. It should also be a good year for DraftKings, in particular. Although it could face increased competition from newcomer ESPN Bet, DraftKings is projecting a positive adjusted EBITDA of between $350 million and $450 million next year.",
