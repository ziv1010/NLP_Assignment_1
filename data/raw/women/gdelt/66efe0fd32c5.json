  "body_text": "Although it is understood Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) delivered an earlier concept, it is unclear whether the Danish heavyweight continues to be involved.\nThe NEOM stadium is one of 11 proposed new-build venues for the 2034 FIFA World Cup, which football’s world governing body controversially awarded to Saudi Arabia last month. The country was the sole candidate in the running to host the tournament.\nLocated in the Hidden Marina – the initial 2.3km-long section of the Line overseen by Austrian practice Delugan Meissl Associated Architects (DMAA) – the NEOM stadium would sit 350m above ground and be used for group stage matches and the quarter-finals, according to the Saudi World Cup bid.\nAdvertisement\nPopulous is behind at least four more of the tournament’s stadiums: the planned 92,000-seat King Salman Stadium, which will host the final of the 2034 tournament, next to a new Foster + Partners’ airport in Riyadh; the King Fahad Stadium, also in Riyadh; the under-construction Dammam Aramaco Stadium, which is due to feature games for the 2027 Asian Cup; and the Qiddiya stadium, which was unveiled in February last year as the first proposed 2034 World Cup venue.\nThe concept for Populous’s Dammam stadium was drawn up by Foster + Partners, which also worked with Populous on the Lusail stadium in Qatar, the venue for the final match of the 2022 World Cup.\nOther British names involved in the Saudi World Cup include Manchester-based AFL Architects. The practice said last month that it had been commissioned to design the 47,500-capacity King Abdullah Economic City Stadium in Jeddah on the Red Sea.\nArup is understood to be working on the planned New Murabba Stadium, the AJ reported last August. The 46,000-seat arena, located north-west of central Riyadh, would host group and second-round games.\nArup is also refurbishing the King Abdullah Sports City Stadium, in Jeddah. The 58,400-seat venue would host quarter-final games in 2034. The 15-stadium tournament includes just four refurbished stadiums – a decrease from earlier FIFA tournaments.\nAdvertisement\nLast summer, the AJ also reported on BIG’s involvement with the Saudi World Cup but the practice has not responded to a request for comment on the NEOM stadium.\nSeven new stadiums were built for the 2022 Qatar World Cup, which was criticised for underplaying the tournament’s environmental impact.\nQatar also came under intense scrutiny over deaths and poor treatment of workers in the construction of stadiums for the tournament. A report by the Guardian in 2021 put the total number deaths of migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka at 6,5000 – far exceeding the three deaths admitted to by Qatar officials.\nPractices accepting work in Saudi Arabia continue to provoke debate. The country has come under scrutiny for its human- rights record, including its treatment of women, restriction of free speech, and treatment of the LGBTQ community and other minorities.\nIn November, architect Duncan Baker-Brown wrote in the AJ that working on Saudi giga-projects such as NEOM was incompatible with being an ethical professional and being a member of the RIBA. The same month, Gensler’s European headquarters in London, DMAA and Mott MacDonald were announced as the ‘core’ design team for the Line’s first phase.\nThe AJ understands that architects on common design elements on The Line – also known as ‘vertical neighbourhoods’ – are due to be announced in early 2025.\nThe Saudi 2034 bid said holding the tournament would be an ‘opportunity to showcase the country’s commitment to environmental sustainability’.\nPopulous declined to comment.",
