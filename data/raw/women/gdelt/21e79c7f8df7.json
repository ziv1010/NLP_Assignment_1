  "body_text": "Bangladesh U-19 women open SAFF title defence with 12-goal blitz\nBangladesh announced their intentions in thunderous fashion in Pokhara.\nOn a cool Saturday in Nepal, the defending champions tore through Bhutan 12-0 in the opening match of the SAFF Women’s Under-19 Championship, a statement win that felt less like a season opener and more like a warning to the rest of the field.\nIt took patience at first. For 27 minutes, Bangladesh camped in Bhutanese territory, probing, passing, pressing. Then the breakthrough came, and the floodgates never really closed. By half-time, it was 4–0. By full-time, Bhutan were simply trying to survive waves of green and red shirts.\nMunki Akhter led the demolition with four goals, her movement sharp and her finishing ruthless. Trishna Rani Sarkar was just as devastating, striking a hat-trick with a mix of power and poise. Alpi Akhter added three of her own, while captain Arpita Biswas and Mamuni Chakma chipped in with a goal each. Three of the 12 came in injury time, underlining Bangladesh’s refusal to ease off even when the result was long settled.\nThe goals told their own story. Mamuni Chakma broke the deadlock directly from a left-footed corner. Trishna doubled the lead late in the first half after a slick move down the right. Munki struck twice before the break, once in open play and again in stoppage time, to leave Bhutan reeling at 4-0.\nThe second half turned into a showcase. Trishna completed her hat-trick within an hour, Alpi punished defensive confusion, and Munki kept finding space where none seemed to exist. Even as the clock ticked down, Bangladesh pressed for more, a hunger that reflected both confidence and intent.\nThis is not an accidental surge. Bangladesh and India were joint champions in the last edition, and this time, the Bangladesh Football Federation has clearly set the bar high. The head coach has been sent with a clear mandate. Win the title. Develop the next generation. Make a mark.\nThe tournament is being played in a league format among four teams, with the top two advancing to the final. If this opener is any indication, Bangladesh are not here to ease their way in.\nThe real test arrives next. Bangladesh face India on February 2 in what already feels like an early final. After a 12-goal opening roar, one thing is certain. Bangladesh have started this championship like champions, and they look very much in the mood to finish it that way too.",
