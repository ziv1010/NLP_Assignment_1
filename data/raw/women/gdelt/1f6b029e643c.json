I thought when Lucy [Bronze] scored [England’s sixth goal in the 91st minute], ‘we’re going to get this’. Then The Netherlands scored, that’s how close it was.\n“I was really proud of the performance, but we’re not through and it’s very disappointing.”\nEngland’s failure is a major blow to Team GB after they won the 2022 Euros and reached the final of the World Cup in the summer. It also comes as a blow to LGBTQ+ representation in Team GB during next summer’s Olympics, with several out and proud LGBTQ+ Lionesses now set to stay home.\nThe Netherlands now go into February’s semi-finals along with the other group winners, Spain and Germany, as well as France.\nTeam GB women’s football squad has previously competed at the 2012 Olympics in London and 2020 Olympics in Japan, both times reaching the quarter-finals.",
