  "body_text": "Ranked: Spain’s best bucket-list attractions\nNo Spain, no gain\nFor those who love to travel, Spain really does have it all. From mouthwatering cuisine and culture-packed museums to epic mountain terrain and an extensive coastline that stretches for almost 5,000 miles (8,000km), it’s a country with enough bucket-list experiences to fill several lifetimes. We’ve gathered the opinions of our well-travelled editorial team and ranked the best things to do here, fully in the knowledge that such an approach is deeply subjective and that you might well disagree with us. Vamos.\nRead on to see how we’ve ranked Spain’s bucket list experiences...\n31. Royal Palace of Madrid, Madrid\nWith a mind-boggling 3,418 rooms, spread out over a whopping 1.5 million square feet (135,000sqm), this mega-structure in the Spanish capital holds the title of Europe's largest palace. Twice the size of other famously regal buildings like Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Versailles, the Royal Palace of Madrid is the King of Spain's official residence and a staggering architectural feat.\nNestled within the incredibly ornate complex, that was built between 1738 and 1764, the palace's two million annual visitors enjoy highlights such as the Royal Armoury, Throne Room and the magnificent Hall of Columns. Do not miss out.\n30. Murcia Cathedral, Murcia\nSome buildings in Spain demand your full attention and refuse to let anything else have it. The Murcia Cathedral, which dates back to the 14th century, is one such structure. Behind the 18th-century Baroque façade, with its intricate and harmonious blend of architecture and sculpture, you’ll find a dramatic Gothic interior and all manner of Renaissance influences.\nThe cathedral’s Bell Tower, or Torre-Campanario, is 295 feet (90m) high – 311 feet (95m) if you include the vane – and offers the best views of the city. Its bells are individually named and have been used as calls to prayer, as well as warnings of flood and war and messages of peace and celebration.\n29. Alcazaba, Málaga\nWhen it comes to majestic Moorish buildings that dominate a city’s skyline, visitors to Spain have some amazing ones to choose from. This seriously impressive 11th-century palace-fort, perched on a hill alongside the impressive Castle of Gibralfaro, is the ideal gateway to such things.\nSpanning over 161,000 square feet (15,000sqm), the Alcazaba has been restored many times over the years without losing its original grandeur. Come for the courtyards, gardens and defences, stay for sweeping views over Málaga and the Mediterranean. By its entrance, you'll find the ancient 220-seat Teatro Romano amphitheatre.\n28. Mount Teide, Tenerife\nSat in the middle of scenic Tenerife, you’ll find Spain’s highest peak and one of Europe’s most visited national parks. Mount Teide, an active volcano that last erupted in 1909, is the undisputed star of the show in Teide National Park, hitting a height of 12,198 feet (3,718m) above sea level.\nSee the mountain in the golden hours of sunrise (pictured) or sunset to witness it at its most magnificent. For a memorable view of the entire island and the Canary Islands archipelago, minus the effort of climbing, take a shortcut to the top with the Teide Cable Car.\n27. Party and relax, Ibiza\nWhile the club culture, foam parties and all-night DJ sessions aren’t for everyone, there’s a reason this hedonistic island in the Balearics is so revered by those who like to dance until the sun comes up. Simply put, it’s because nowhere in Spain, or Europe for that matter, has a nightlife that lives up to its reputation quite like Ibiza.\nPacha Ibiza (pictured), which opened its doors in 1973 and has recently celebrated its 50th anniversary, was the island's first superclub. Needless to say, the partygoers adore it. Those wanting to relax should head to the north of the island for a more chilled-out experience.\n26. Ysios Winery, Álava\nDesigned by Santiago Calatrava as a ‘temple dedicated to wine’, the Ysios Winery is an architectural masterpiece that might, ever so briefly, make you forget the nature of your visit. The conspicuous vineyard laid out in front should, when you’ve picked your jaw off the floor, bring it flooding back though.\nSat at the foot of the Sierra de Cantabria mountain range, in the heart of Rioja Alavesa, this avant-garde boutique winery brings a bold and revolutionary approach to the area’s famous wine-making traditions. See for yourself what all the fuss is about by joining a tour and tasting session.\n25. Aqueduct of Segovia, Segovia\nRunning through the historic heart of beautiful Segovia, a UNESCO World Heritage Site 57 miles (92km) northwest of Madrid, is a testament to the might of Roman engineering. Thought to have been built around AD 50, and made from over 20,000 blocks of unmortared granite, this remarkably well-preserved structure boasts 167 arches and stretches for 2,667 feet (813m).\nAfter admiring what was once one of the largest aqueducts in the Roman world, be sure to make some time for Segovia’s other amazing attractions. The fairytale-esque Alcázar with its Rapunzel towers and the city’s Gothic cathedral, almost 200 years in the making, are a must.\n24. El Retiro Park, Madrid\nThe big green lungs of the Spanish capital, El Retiro Park stretches out across over 125 hectares of Madrid. Home to more than 15,000 trees, the Madrileños come here for a spot of escapism – enjoying walks, playing sports, visiting exhibitions and going for a paddle on the artificial lake.\nOn 25 July 2021, El Retiro Park and the tree-lined avenue Paseo del Prado, known jointly as the Landscape of Light, became the first site in the city to be granted UNESCO World Heritage status. Take a break from the modern-day urban sprawl by spending a day among its rich tapestry of nature and stately buildings.\n23. As Catedrais, Ribadeo, Lugo\nFrom secluded spots that feel like heaven to tourist magnets where the sunbathers are packed in like sardines, you don't need us to tell you that Spain is synonymous with beaches. Perhaps the best of them, or certainly the most interesting, is this one in the country’s windswept northwest.\nAs Catedrais, meaning ‘The Cathedrals’, has been designated a Natural Monument and is famous for its striking rock formations. When the tide is out here, you can kick your shoes off and explore huge, otherworldly arches that have been carved out by the elements over time. In peak seasons, booking is required.\n22. Palma Cathedral, Palma, Mallorca\nRather unfairly, Mallorca is sometimes dismissed as a package holiday destination with little to offer your typical history buff or culture vulture. Stunning attractions like Palma Cathedral, however, flip such misconceptions on their head.\nConstruction work on this monumental building, built in the Mediterranean Gothic tradition, began in the 13th century and didn’t end until the 1630s. In the years since, it has incorporated design elements from subsequent time periods. At the start of the 20th century, renowned architect Antoni Gaudí (more on him later) adapted the interior to be a brighter and more open space.\n21. Camino de Santiago\nTime to strap on your hiking boots and answer the call of the great outdoors? This extensive network of ancient pilgrim routes, which lead to the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in northwest Spain, dates back to the 9th century and pulls in long-distance walkers from all over.\nThe trails and footpaths that make it up bring to mind natural waterways, with small brooks joining together to make streams, and streams joining up to make rivers. Stretching for almost 500 miles (780km), the popular Camino Francés (‘French Way’) starts near the France-Spain border and crosses the Pyrenees. It takes around 35 days to complete.\n20. La Tomatina, Buñol, Valencia\nEvery year, traditionally on the last Wednesday of August, visitors to Buñol in the province of Valencia are left seeing red. Not because they're angry, but because they're usually having to wipe large quantities of splattered tomatoes from their eyelids. Trust us, this one's more fun than it sounds.\nMarking the culmination of the town’s week-long festivities to honour their patron saint, San Luis Beltrán, the event pulls in thousands of attendees from around the globe. Said to be the biggest food fight in the world, it involves over 120 tonnes of tomatoes being thrown around by a maximum of 22,000 ‘combatants’.\n19. Montserrat Monastery, Barcelona\nJust 28 miles (45km) northwest of Barcelona, the rocky profile of Montserrat – summit 4,055 feet (1,236m) above sea level – and its Benedictine monastery awaits. Here is a place that exists proudly at the heart of Catalan identity, an instantly recognisable mix that attracts religious pilgrims and outdoor enthusiasts alike.\nFounded as a monastery in 1025, it was burnt down by Napoleon's troops in 1811. During the Spanish Civil War, many of the religious men and women who lived there were killed. Under Franco's regime, it became a sanctuary for artists, scholars and politicians, as well as a symbol of resistance.\n18. Basílica del Pilar, Zaragoza\nAccording to ancient tradition, this jewel of Baroque art on the banks of the river Ebro was built in the same place where the Virgin Mary appeared to the apostle Santiago in AD 40. Along with the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, which is the end point of the Camino de Santiago hiking trails, it’s one of the most important spiritual destinations in Spain.\nThe current basilica, which replaced the site’s previous religious structures, was designed in 1681 and greatly modified in the 18th century. Inside, you’ll find not one but two frescoes by Francisco Goya and a stunning altarpiece by Damiàn Forment. Head up Pilar Tower for an unforgettable view of the historic city centre.\n17. Picasso Museum, Málaga\nBoasting over 230 works by one of the most celebrated and influential artists of all time, the Pablo Picasso Museum is an absolute must-visit in Málaga. The idea to have a permanent home for Picasso's work, in the city of his birth, was first mooted in 1953 but it took until 2003, 30 years after his death, for it to become a reality.\nUp in Barcelona, you'll find an even bigger museum dedicated to the life and work of this extraordinary creative. Pop that one on your bucket list while you're at it.\nDiscover the world's most beautiful museums\n16. Belchite, Zaragoza\nFought between 1936 and 1939, and thought to have claimed the lives of an estimated 500,000 people, the Spanish Civil War ripped families and communities apart. Even now, almost 90 years on from the bloodshed, the scars of the conflict are still visible across the country's landscape.\nBelchite, near Zaragoza, contains the ruins of a town destroyed in 1937. Left untouched as a symbol of the conflict, and today serving as a devastating reminder of the war’s intensity, visits to the ruins are only permitted if you’re part of a guided tour.\n15. Mosque-Cathedral of Córdoba, Córdoba\nOne of the world’s finest works of Islamic architecture, it’s difficult to overstate the beauty of Córdoba’s great mosque. A UNESCO World Heritage since 1984, getting over two million visitors every year, the Mezquita nods to a time of intercultural coexistence between the city’s Muslims, Jews and Christians.\nBuilt between AD 784 and 987, back when the Moors ruled Spain, it was consecrated as a church in 1236, with the Renaissance cathedral nave added in 1523. An architectural symbol of religious tolerance, if no longer an ideological one (only Catholics can worship here), the building's blend of influences is a sight to behold.\n14. The 'Food Capital of Spain', San Sebastián\nIt was the late, great chef and author Anthony Bourdain who once said “there’s no better place to eat in Europe” than San Sebastián. With the second most Michelin stars per capita in the world and more mouthwatering pintxos than you can shake a small stick at, it's certainly hard to argue with the Kitchen Confidential writer's view of the place.\nKnown locally as Donostia, this gastrophile's dream on the Basque coast boasts some of the planet’s best restaurants including Arzak, Akelarre, Elkano and Mugaritz. Even the morsels on offer at the bars and markets are like little tastes of Heaven.\n13. Maspalomas Dunes, Gran Canaria\nTravellers looking for somewhere to serve up their best Timothee Chalamet in Dune impression should head for this desert and oasis at the southern tip of Gran Canaria. Its 400 hectares, protected by the Canarian government as a Nature Reserve, consists of a beautiful beach, a spectacular dune system, an idyllic palm grove and a brackish lagoon.\nWhether you think this looks like paradise or an alien planet (or both), there are now five miles (8km) of marked trails to help you make the most of it. The Charca de Maspalomas is the ideal spot to watch aquatic birds including grey herons, common egrets and yellow-legged gulls.\n12. Museo Reina Sofía, Madrid\nPart of Madrid's Golden Triangle of Art, the Reina Sofía is one of the world’s finest contemporary art museums. Boasting a collection of over 20,000 works by renowned artists including Joan Miró, Salvador Dalí and Pablo Picasso, this is the place to dive headfirst into the marvels of modern art from a mostly Spanish perspective.\nNo visit here is complete without contemplating the twisted drama and horror of Picasso’s Guernica (pictured). The enormous painting immortalises the cruel suffering inflicted by the bombing of a Basque town in 1937 by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, at the request of Spanish Nationalists during the country's bloody Civil War.\n11. Park Güell, Barcelona\nAt the end of 2024, the unmistakable Park Güell in Barcelona's hilly Gràcia district celebrated 40 years as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Designed by Antoni Gaudí at the behest of industrialist Eusebi Güell, initially to house the city’s wealthy families, today it’s a scenic outdoor spot that watches over the Catalan capital and draws in over four million visitors per year.\nHighlights here include the Austria Gardens, the Hypostyle Room and the Dragon Stairway (pictured). With visitor numbers limited to preserve the space for future generations, pre-booking tickets is a must.\n10. Plaza de España, Seville\nThe most famous square in Seville and, arguably, all of Spain is actually a semi-circle. Built for the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929 in a Spanish Renaissance style, with touches of Moorish Revival thrown in, this place overwhelms visitors with its beauty across a diameter of 656 feet (200m).\nAdorned with more than 7,000 colourful ceramic tiles, depicting historical events, provinces of Spain and scenes from Spanish literature and mythology, the plaza is a feast for the eyes. Paddling down the Venetian-style canal, under its four bridges which each represent one of the country's ancient kingdoms, is a joy.\n9. Caminito del Rey, Málaga\nDepending on how good you are with heights, a walk along the Caminito del Rey (meaning ‘The King’s Little Walk’) will either induce vertigo or make you feel like Indiana Jones (at times, it can do both). Once considered one of the world’s most dangerous walks, it reopened in 2015 after extensive safety improvements.\nFound 37 miles (60km) inland from Málaga, it really is worth plucking up your courage for this unique five-mile (8km) path. The breathtaking views, as you weave through Gaitanes Gorge on wooden walkways 328 feet (100m) in the air, will stay with you forever.\n8. The Santiago Bernabéu, Madrid\nSpain lives and breathes the beautiful game. Not only are their national men’s team the reigning European champions, but the country’s women are also the current World Cup holders (England were beaten in both tournament finals).\nReal Madrid CF are Spanish football's most decorated club side and the winner of more European Cups (15) than any other team in history. Their famous home has just gone through a €1.76-billion (£1.51bn/$1.91bn) renovation, resulting in a shiny new look and a capacity of 85,000. Enjoy a tour, check out the trophy collection and catch a match here if you can.\n7. Dalí Theatre-Museum, Figueres\nStudded with plaster-covered croissants, this strange red castle in northeast Spain, topped with giant eggs and Oscar-like statues, is a fitting final resting place for the master of surrealism himself. Certainly, with around 1,500 of his works on show, there’s no better place on the planet to explore the wild imagination of Salvador Dalí.\nPieces on display range from his early experiments to his final creations, and include the Mae West Room, Rainy Taxi (also known as Mannequin Rotting in a Taxi-Cab) and a tiny room with a mirrored flamingo. Since his death in 1989, Dalí has been buried in a crypt at the museum’s centre.\n6. Cave of Altamira, Santillana del Mar, Cantabria\nKnown as the ‘Sistine Chapel of Paleolithic Art’, the Cave of Altamira is home to paintings that are 14,000 years old. Created using natural, red-coloured ochre and outlined in black, the bison, deer, boars and horses on display here connect you to our distant ancestors in a way that feels truly profound.\nDeclared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985, it isn't actually possible to go inside the cave for conservation reasons. Found in the Neocave of the Altamira Museum, just a few metres from the original, the painstakingly reproduced replica – brought to life using the same prehistoric techniques – is still well worth the effort.\n5. City of Arts and Sciences, Valencia\nWant to feel like you’ve travelled into the future and, quite possibly, into a different dimension? Take a stroll at the mind-bending City of Arts and Sciences. Designed by the Valencian Santiago Calatrava, and finished in various stages at the turn of the millennium, the project cost an eye-watering €1 billion (£740m/$915m) to complete – four times the original budget.\nThese days, much of the pricing controversy has dissipated and several of the buildings are now considered icons of the city. Standouts include Europe’s biggest aquarium, a digital 3D cinema shaped like a human eye, an interactive science museum and a spectacular concert venue.\n4. Puente Nuevo, Ronda, Málaga\nNo matter how long you spend looking at this dreamlike bridge in the Andalusian province of Málaga, you won’t be able to convince your brain that it actually exists. Puente Nuevo, meaning ‘New Bridge’, spans 216 feet (66m) across the El Tajo gorge at a head-spinning height of 322 feet (98m).\nCompleted in 1793, after 34 years of construction, it helped to connect the spectacular split-city of Ronda. During Spain's Civil War, it’s thought prisoners were thrown from a chamber above the central arch. A scene in Ernest Hemingway's classic novel For Whom the Bell Tolls is believed to have been inspired by these dark events.\n3. The Guggenheim, Bilbao\nPerhaps the world's most recognisable art museum, the Guggenheim's transformative effect on the Basque Country's largest city has been nothing short of extraordinary. Its impact in terms of visitor numbers, economic uplift and positive media coverage has become known as the ‘Bilbao effect’ – a phenomenon where cultural investment combined with showy architecture results in the good times returning to a place down on its luck.\nJust outside the curvy walls of Frank Gehry’s iconic design, which opened in 1997, you'll find a huge spider by Louise Bourgeois and a giant dog made of flowers by Jeff Koons.\n2. Alhambra, Granada\nSet against the atmospheric Sierra Nevada mountains, the world-famous Alhambra stands as a proud testament to the grand vision of Moorish culture. Mostly dating back to the 13th and 14th centuries when Granada’s Nasrid rulers transformed it into a fortified palace complex, the UNESCO World Heritage Site is today one of Spain’s most popular tourist attractions – receiving over 2.6 million visitors every year.\nThe Palacios Nazaríes here are thought to be among the finest Islamic buildings in Europe. Combined with the soothing layout and lush greenery of the Generalife Gardens, they form a headline act that’s hard to beat.\n1. La Sagrada Família, Barcelona\nWith so much effort put into this breathtaking structure, we had to make it number one. Today, over 140 years since the laying of the first cornerstone, construction continues on what must surely be the world’s most beautiful building site.\nDue for completion in 2026, 100 years on from the death of the cathedral’s chief architect Antoni Gaudí, five generations of Barcelonians have seen the Sagrada Família rise up and tower over their city. It was designed so that its highest point would be just below that of nearby Montjuïc hill, 568 feet (173m) high, as Gaudí believed nothing made by man should be taller than 'God’s creation'.",
