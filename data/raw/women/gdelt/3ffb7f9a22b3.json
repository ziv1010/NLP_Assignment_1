It was instant shock, and she was shivering and shaking.\n\"Fortunately, our goalkeeper [Danielle Bartels] is an ER [emergency room] nurse. Jayna was saying I can't feel my foot any more ... After two hours, we gave up [waiting for an ambulance] and we brought a car onto the field.\n\"She didn't like it, but we moved her. Danielle did a great job, and [Azzurri NPLW physiotherapist] Zoe [McLachlan] and [strength and conditioning coach] Col [Sanctuary]. They immobilised her leg, and it took quite some time, but we got her in the car and went straight to Lake Mac [private hospital] and they got some orderlies to help.\n\"It was getting to a point where she was just shivering uncontrollably ... and the pain was just excruciating.\n\"Everyone was great. Maitland were very supportive of the situation, Liam [Bentley], Peter [Haynes] from Northern were great. All concern was around the player.\"\nThe Cup final was 0-0 at the time of abandonment.\nAzzurri, who were beaten by Olympic on penalties in last year's Cup decider, finished top of their group to advance to the finals.\nThey progressed to another final after beating Adamstown 1-1 (4-3) in a penalty shoot-out, while Maitland disposed of defending champions Olympic 4-0 in their semi-final.\nAzzurri have already claimed the Charity Shield and League Cup this year.\nThey are second in NPLW on 33 points, five points behind leaders Maitland (38) with four rounds remaining.\nCharlestown have a game in hand over the Magpies, and the premiership could be decided in a last-round showdown between the two sides.\nFraser's injury comes with Azzuri's leading scorer Madi Gallegos also sidelined due to a knee issue.\nThe State Cup was contested by 19 clubs from across northern NSW over three days at Speers Point.\nUrunga beat Lake Cathie 1-0 in the Community Plate final on Sunday.\nIn NPL Men over the weekend, leaders Edgeworth (47 points) maintained a three-point buffer over second-placed Broadmeadow (44) with a 2-1 win against Cooks Hill (18).\nLambton improved to fifth place and 23 points by backing up their midweek win over third-placed Weston (31) with a 3-0 victory against Belmont Swansea (15). Weston succumbed 3-1 to Broadmeadow, Adamstown (14) drew 0-0 with Olympic (22) and Maitland (22) were 3-1 winners against Azzurri (24). Valentine (16) produced an important 2-1 victory over New Lambton (6).",
