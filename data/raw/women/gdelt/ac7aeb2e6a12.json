  "body_text": "The members of the Vermont congressional delegation this week offered support for the members of Operation Southern Spear while also condemning the Trump administration’s deployment of the Vermont Air National Guard’s 158th Fighter Wing based in Burlington.\n“My heart is with all the Vermont National Guard members and their families as they prepare for a deployment during the holidays,” said U.S. Rep. Becca Balint. “Vermonters are proud of the brave men and women who sacrifice a lot to serve in the National Guard, representing both Vermont and our country. I know I speak for all Vermonters when I say that I am praying for their safe return back home when their deployment is over.”\nShe went on: “I am, however, deeply concerned about the Trump administration’s decision to deploy the 158th Fighter Wing of the Vermont Air National Guard. Any deployment must be based on lawful authority, and full transparency must be provided to Congress. … The Vermont congressional delegation has received zero notice, information, or clarity about the location, duration, and purpose of this deployment. This is not normal, nor should it be tolerated. … The decision to send our service members into harm’s way must be rooted in a clear mission and safety. It should not be based on unpredictable, unilateral and unlawful directives from any president.”\nU.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders added, “After campaigning against ‘endless wars,’ the Trump administration is threatening a military intervention in Venezuela, which may include the Vermont Air National Guard. I will do everything I can to prevent that conflict. … Instead of addressing the crises facing the American people, Trump is focused on engaging in an illegal armed conflict. Under our Constitution, only Congress can authorize the use of military force. We must make sure the United States does not get involved in yet another war and destabilize another region.”\nAnd U.S. Sen. Peter Welch offered gratitude to the Vermont Guardsmen while offering his own condemnation.\n“I want to thank our brave airmen for their faithful service to Vermont and the United States—and acknowledge the difficulty of leaving their families at home this holiday season. You have my full respect and gratitude,” he said. “At the same time, I strongly oppose President Trump’s mobilization of the Vermont Air National Guard alongside thousands of other U.S. military units in what appears to be a relentless march to war. … One of the gravest decisions Congress can make is to authorize the U.S. military to attack a sovereign nation — in this instance, a sovereign nation that has not attacked us. I will continue to urge my colleagues — Democrats and Republicans — not to cede our constitutional authority for a war of choice based on lies.”\nUnemployment rate\nThe Vermont Department of Labor this week reported the unemployment rate for September was 2.5%, reflecting no change from the prior month.\nThe civilian labor force participation rate was 64.4% in September, a decrease of two-tenths of one percentage point from the prior month’s revised estimate. The comparable U.S. rate in September was 4.4%, an increase of one-tenth of one percentage point from the revised August estimate. Due to the federal shutdown, federal data was delayed, which accounts for the timing of the release.\nState revenues\nSecretary of Administration Sarah Clark this week released Vermont’s revenue results for November.\nThe state’s General Fund, Transportation Fund and Education Fund receipts were a combined $214.4 million, down $17.2 million, or 7.4%, below the $231.6 million monthly target.\nState officials say collections may have been impacted by the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday, which resulted in November being a “short month” for revenue collection purposes. Some November revenues may spill over into December. Total General Fund revenues for November were $128.7 million, down $15.3 million or 10.6% below the $144 million target, driven by lagging collections in the Corporate Income Tax.\nRevenues in the Transportation Fund were $24.3 million, representing a $200,000 increase in collections, or 0.9% above target.\nMonthly Education Fund revenues of $61.4 million were off $2.1 million, or 3.4%, below their November cash flow target of $63.5 million.\nAccording to Clark: “November receipts reflected some downside pressure, although the reduced number of banking days at the end of the month due to the Thanksgiving holiday weekend may have had an impact. As a result, December’s revenue results may provide a clearer picture of where receipts stand. Those results and the updated January consensus forecast will both provide valuable information for the expected revenue picture for the second half of the fiscal year.”\nAntisemitism\nIn the wake of the antisemitic attack in Sydney, Australia, Rep. Balint joined fellow lawmakers in introducing the Antisemitism Response and Prevention Act.\nAccording to a news release, “this comprehensive strategy to combating antisemitism supports the Biden administration’s landmark U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, including its approach to defining antisemitism. ARPA also fully funds the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Education, reverses the Trump closure of regional offices, prevents regional offices from being closed in the future, and creates greater congressional oversight over the work of the Department. Additionally, ARPA mandates the designation of a Title VI coordinator on every college campus in order to provide students with additional resources to report hate incidents if they occur, while working to prevent antisemitism and other hate on campus.”\nThe bill creates a Hate Crime Reporting Center to record, track, index, report, and publish data related to hate crimes committed in the United States. The bill also establishes a national coordinator to Counter Antisemitism to spearhead a whole-of-government response to the antisemitism crisis in America.\n“The terrorist attack against Jewish families in Sydney is a tragic example of how antisemitism is on the rise. As the grandchild of a man killed in the Holocaust, I personally know how attacks like this threaten our identity and community, said Balint, who is Jewish.\n“I am proud to co-lead this legislation to combat antisemitism in our country. This bill would provide resources to prevent and combat antisemitism in our communities and on college campuses. It will also ensure strong Congressional oversight and guardrails to prevent any administration from politicizing antisemitism to further attack their opponents. Antisemitism is not just an attack on Jewish people — it is a threat to democracy and the safety of all communities.”\nAustralia attack\nAll 25 Jewish members of the U.S. House of Representatives, including Becca Balint, released a joint statement in response to an attack on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, that targeted Jewish people celebrating the first night of Hanukkah.\nIn part, it reads: “We stand in solidarity with the Australian Jewish community and together extend our condolences to the family and friends of the people murdered and are praying for the complete recovery of the dozens wounded, and the entire Jewish community feeling besieged.”\nIt goes on: “Antisemitism is a cancer that eats at the core of society, whether in Australia, the United States, or anywhere it is allowed to take root and grow. We join leaders around the globe in condemning this evil act and in calling for justice, peace, and unwavering support for those affected. We also call on all leaders to do better standing up to antisemitism, bigotry, and hate. We must also do better in our work for a world where everyone can celebrate their faith and traditions free from discrimination and fear.”\nHealth care costs\nThis week, Balint released a statement after voting against Republican legislation that fails to extend Affordable Care Act health care tax credits.\nIn part, it reads: “For months, Americans have sent a clear message that health care costs are too high. In only 14 days, more than 20 million Americans who receive coverage from Affordable Care Act plans will see high deductibles and their premium costs more than double because of the expiration of federal subsidies. Families around the country are receiving notices that their monthly premiums will increase to unreasonable prices, with some being expected to pay premiums upwards of $3,000 a month. Vermonters cannot afford that.”\nIt goes on: “People will be forced to forego care or choose to lose coverage altogether. Hospitals in rural states like Vermont that are already struggling from over $800 billion in Medicaid cuts from the Republican tax bill will have to absorb the cost of providing more uncompensated care, pushing them to the brink of financial collapse. Our health care system is barreling toward catastrophe, while Republicans prioritize tax cuts for billionaires over coming to the table with Democrats to provide affordable health care. … Republicans have no plan to lower health care costs. Speaker Johnson’s last-minute health care proposal is full of recycled ideas that undermine the Affordable Care Act and fail to extend the subsidies that keep premiums affordable.”\nMD office invasions\nThis week, Balint voiced opposition to two Republican bills before the House of Representatives that would ban medically necessary, evidence-based health care: “Republicans want to take health care away from people, whether through devastating cuts that threaten your local hospital, allowing your health care premiums to skyrocket, or preventing doctors and parents from making medical decisions that are right for kids. … Decisions about kids’ health care should be made by parents and doctors, not by Marjorie Taylor Greene or Mike Johnson. The bills Republicans are advancing this week are shocking invasions of privacy. … I want trans kids and their families to know that I stand with them. I won’t back down.”\nACLU statement\nThis week, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced proposed rule changes to Medicare and Medicaid that seek to eliminate access to medically necessary care for transgender youth.\nOne of these rules would prohibit hospitals receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds from providing gender-affirming care to patients under 18, while the other would stop the flow of federal Medicaid funds to cover that same care.\nACLU Staff Attorney Monica Allard said: “Let’s be clear: it is still legal to provide this necessary health care to trans youth in Vermont. Moreover, Vermont’s responsibility to provide access to affordable health care for all kids does not change based on federal Medicare and Medicaid rules. The Trump administration knows it does not have the power to single-handedly ban gender-affirming care for youth, so it is targeting critical funding instead. With these proposed rules, the Trump administration is trying to threaten health care access for everyone unless providers abandon trans youth. That’s not governance — it’s extortion.”\n‘AI experiment’\nU.S. Sens. Welch and Bernie Sanders and nearly a dozen Democratic senators have introduced the Seniors Deserve SMARTER (Streamlined Medical Approvals for Timely, Efficient Recovery) Care Act.\nThis is bicameral legislation to prohibit the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from implementing the Wasteful and Inappropriate Service Reduction model that is set to begin Jan. 1 and last for six years.\nAccording to a news release, the Trump administration’s WISeR model will introduce prior authorization requirements into Traditional Medicare for the first time ever — allowing private companies to use artificial intelligence to decide whether to approve or deny certain medical procedures for patients on Traditional Medicare.\n“The model will impose new burdensome requirements on health care providers, especially those working in small or low-resource settings, and create new roadblocks for patients. Under this model, AI will get to decide what care patients receive, even after their doctors have recommended a particular procedure or medication,” the release states.\n“From Day One, the Trump Administration has been on a rampage to wreck Medicare and make health care unaffordable. Their newest plan to let AI take over important Medicare prior authorization decisions will be a disaster for providers and make it harder for seniors to get the care they need,” said Welch. “We’re fighting to ensure health care decisions stay in the hands of seniors and their doctors.”\nProtecting artists\nDemocrat Welch and Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn, of Tennessee, introduced the Visual Artists Copyright Reform Act, or VACRA.\nThis is bipartisan legislation to modernize copyright registration for visual artists to make it easier and less costly for high-volume visual artists to register and protect their works.\n“Vermont’s visual creators make significant contributions to our country, and their work should be protected. But visual artists often struggle to protect the authenticity of their work because of the unique challenges facing high-volume artists,” said Welch. “We’re working to modernize copyright processes and safeguard the creativity of visual artists.”\nThe Copyright Act of 1976 offers the promise that copyrightable works are automatically protected the instant they are created. However, those rights cannot be enforced unless each work is registered with the Copyright Office. The registration process is so complicated that the time and expense of compliance is too high for high-volume creators like photographers, illustrators, and graphic artists. We are committed to working with the Copyright Office to address these shortcomings.\nThis summer, Welch and Blackburn reintroduced their bipartisan Transparency and Responsibility for Artificial Intelligence Networks (TRAIN) Act, legislation to help musicians, artists, writers, and others access the courts to protect their copyrighted works if and when they are used to train generative AI models.\nNuclear plant plans\nThe Vermont congressional delegation, along with U.S. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, and Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, introduced the Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Act of 2025, bicameral legislation “that aims to give states a more meaningful role in the development and approval of reactor shutdown plans and post-shutdown license transfers. The legislation will also provide new support for Community Advisory Boards and economic development in host communities throughout the decommissioning process,” according to a news release.\n“For too long, working class communities across the country have been forced to deal with the safety and economic consequences of (a) nuclear power plant while having virtually no say in the plans, which the people of Vernon understand all too well,” said Sanders. “That is unacceptable. These communities deserve economic relief and a meaningful role in the decommissioning process. The Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Act of 2025 would make sure communities like Vernon are actually part of the decision making and receive the federal support they need to deal with the very real impacts of these closures.”\nThe process of hosting and decommissioning a nuclear plant carries significant consequences for both the operator of the plant and the surrounding community, according to the news release.\nManufacturers pay $60,000\nAttorney General Charity Clark announced that Vermont and 35 other states have reached a settlement with automobile manufacturers Hyundai and Kia for their sale of millions of vehicles nationwide that lacked industry-standard, anti-theft technology.\nUnder the settlement, Hyundai and Kia have agreed to install free zinc-reinforced ignition-cylinder protectors, provide restitution to eligible consumers whose vehicles were damaged by theft, and pay approximately $60,000 to Vermont.\nThe manufacturers have also committed to equipping all future vehicles sold in the United States with this technology.\n“I am pleased to announce that Hyundai and Kia will take corrective action as a result of this multistate settlement, providing a free fix for their customers, as well as pay restitution to customers whose cars were damaged,” said Clark. “It’s important to me that we protect consumers, the marketplace, and public safety in our communities, and this settlement will do just that.”\nThe settlement is the result of a multi-state action taken against Hyundai and Kia, which chose not to include anti-theft “engine-immobilizer” technology in millions of their vehicles sold throughout the United States, including in Vermont. An engine immobilizer prevents thieves from starting a vehicle’s engine without the vehicle’s “smart” key, which stores the vehicle’s electronic security code.\nMoneyBack Program\nGov. Phil Scott and Treasurer Mike Pieciak have announced that the state will mail Vermonters a check for their unclaimed property this holiday season.\nThe MoneyBack program is an annual effort between the Treasurer’s Office and the administration to proactively return unclaimed property to Vermonters whose identity and address can be verified by shareable Tax Department data.\nThis year, the program will return over $150,000 to over 1,000 Vermonters with claims ranging from $100 to $250. The average amount returned is about $150.\nVermonters included in the MoneyBack program will receive a letter from the State alerting them of the amount they will receive. Within a few days of receiving the letter, recipients will receive a check in the mail for their unclaimed property.\nUnclaimed property includes lost checks, forgotten security deposits, investments, and other financial property. Entities annually report these assets and turn them over to the state. The Treasurer’s Office safeguards them until claimed by rightful owners or their heirs. Unclaimed property can belong to individuals, businesses, nonprofits, government entities and more.\nAll Vermonters are encouraged to visit missingmoney.com to check for unclaimed property. For inquiries regarding a claim or assistance with the claims process, contact the Treasurer’s Office Unclaimed Property Division at 802-828-2407 or email unclaimed.property@vermont.gov.\nNew state director\nU.S. Rep. Becca Balint has announced the hiring of the office’s new state director, Jessica Nordhaus. Nordhaus will lead the Vermont offices, directing outreach and constituent services.\nNordhaus began her career as an entrepreneur, founding Horny Toad Activewear (now Toad & Co.) immediately after graduating from Yale University, according to a news release. She has been involved in education, community organizing, K-12 school reform, political consulting, public policy, nonprofit development, and equity work. According to the news release, Nordhaus directed Change The Story VT until its sunset in 2022, before joining Balint’s team in 2023.\nMorley appointed\nGov. Phil Scott has appointment John Morley to fill the vacant Orleans District Senate seat.\nMorley replaces Sam Douglass, who resigned in October.\nMorley grew up in, and resides in, Orleans County with his wife, Jodi. He has worked for the Village of Orleans for 33 years, managing an electric department, street department, water and wastewater department, fire department, and library. Morley is an active member of the community, serving on many boards, in addition to having served in the Vermont House of Representatives for six years from 2004 until 2010.\nMorley’s appointment was effective Dec. 5.\nCompiled by the staffs of The Times Argus and Rutland Herald.\nVt. Green Football Club\nThe Vermont congressional delegation introduced a bicameral resolution congratulating the Vermont Green Football Club on their historic win in the 2025 USL League Two National Championship.\nThe Vermont Green FC’s win came after an undefeated season and marks the second year in a row a Vermont-based soccer team has won a national championship.\n“Vermont Green FC has proven that Vermont is a soccer state. In just three years, they have not only built a team but built a community,” said Balint. “Their undefeated season, overflowing with crowds, has made our state proud. I’m looking forward to watching them defend their title in 2026.”\n“I think I speak for the whole state in congratulating the Vermont Green on their extraordinary championship season, and I am glad to join my Vermont colleagues to recognize their accomplishments in the Congressional record. Undefeated. Two overtime playoff wins. Finally, national champions. Unbelievable,” said Sanders.\n“We’re so proud of this team’s achievements and of their commitment to building a soccer community that reflects the core values of Vermonters: hard work, dedication, and teamwork,” said Welch. “We look forward to cheering on the Boys in Green as they defend their title in 2026!”",
