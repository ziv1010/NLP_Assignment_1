  "body_text": "Maybe the “old” guys have a point.\nAfter Saquon Barkley and the Giants failed to agree to a long-term deal ahead of the deadline on Monday, numerous star running backs across the NFL voiced their displeasure with the devaluing of the position across the league.\nVeteran running backs reportedly formed a group chat, organizing a social media blitz while continuing to seek out possible remedies to the position’s decreasing worth to executives.\nMuch of that stems from a belief that running backs decline much quicker than players at other positions, given the physical, punishing nature of the role. Players in the latter half of their 20s who have finished their rookie deals are already considered old, and teams in recent years often have preferred to move on to younger, cheaper options they believe can step in and immediately deliver similar results.",
