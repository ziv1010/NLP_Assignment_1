Arundhati Roy on her fugitive childhood: ‘My knees were full of scars and cuts – a sign of my wild, imperfect, fatherless life’\nWhen war broke out between India and China, the author and her brother were taken by their mother on a chaotic journey from hill station squat to an eccentric household in Kerala. Would they ever find a safe space?\nRead more\n6. ‘It has a heroic, Roman quality’: how Arkansas’s timber university building could revolutionise architecture\nConceived as a “spider’s web of sticks”, Arkansas’s vast wooden wonder may become a template for environmentally sound buildings. Architecture critic Oliver Wainwright visited the Anthony Timberlands Center for Design and Materials Innovation in Fayetteville, where the future is wooden.\nOliver also featured alongside all our cultural critics in our comprehensive autumn arts preview, taking in everything from Caravaggio and football stadium architecture to Spinal Tap II and Little Simz.\nRead more",
