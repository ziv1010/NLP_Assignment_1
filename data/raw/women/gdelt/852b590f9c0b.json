I'm pumped and grateful to be included in this year's honours.\n\"We [Powderfinger] always felt responsibility to give back and be charitable where we could be.\"\nCollins wants to use the honour to encourage others to support live music.\n\"I hope people keep being involved in seeing young bands and music because that is the future.\"\nSuccessful, dominant — but divisive\nFormer Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is one of the six people awarded the highest honour – the Companion of the Order of Australia.\nMr Andrews is recognised for his service to the people and Parliament of Victoria, public health, policy and regulatory reform, and infrastructure development.\nHe was the state's longest-serving Labor premier from 2014 to 2023 and led Victoria through significant historical events, including the 2019-20 bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHe resigned from politics last year, leaving as a successful, dominant, and polarising figure.\nBush tucker cuisine\nAunty Beryl Van Oploo started work at 12 but didn't have a formal education until she was 31.\nNow 81, the chef, proud Kamilaroi woman and educator's career spans more than 50 years.\nThe Indigenous elder is also known internationally for using bush tucker in modern cuisine.\nShe's been recognised with a Medal of the Order of Australia for her service to the Indigenous community and the hospitality industry.\n\"It's a great honour and the people that have nominated me, I thank them,\" she said.\nAunty Beryl's love of food began in childhood in Walgett in northern NSW.\n\"I come from a family of 17, my aunt raised me and she never separated us because she didn't want us to be part of the Stolen Generation.\"\nShe got her first job at 12, and it would be nearly 20 years before she received a formal education.\n\"If you have an education you have a voice, and you have a choice – that was lacking in our communities,\" she said.\nAunty Beryl now runs a hospitality school in Sydney.\nPosthumous honour for 'Colac'\nAFL legend, the late John Devine, has been recognised with an Order of Australia medal for his service to football and Tasmania.\nDevine died in January last year aged 82.\nHe was recruited to play for Geelong from the Victorian country town of Colac and made his debut in 1960, nicknamed \"Colac\".\nAfter playing 118 games for the AFL/VFL he moved to Tasmania, where he coached the North Hobart club to grand final victory in 1967.\n\"When dad arrived in 1967 it was right on the edge of the bushfire tragedy and the North Hobart oval was covered as a crisis centre for fire engines and recovery work,\" his son Mark Devine said.\n\"It was an unusual initiation into his job as the North Hobart coach.\"\nDevine's son said his father would have been surprised by the appointment.\nThe former footy player entered Tasmania state politics in 1979, serving as the ALP member for Denison until 1984.\n\"He had simple motives — he wanted to be able to help people.\"\nThe COVID-19 honour roll\nSouth Australian epidemiologist Katina D'Onise is one of 34 Australians to be recognised for their work through the pandemic.\nProfessor D'Onise received a Member of the Order of Australia for services to public health for her work overseeing COVID-19 operations for South Australia Health.\n\"The pandemic was a rare opportunity for me to use everything I've ever learned all at once,\" Professor D'Onise said.\n\"It was incredibly challenging, but it was also really rewarding — I saw so many people come together.\"\nShe also worked on vaccine hesitancy to improve vaccination rates in remote and Indigenous communities.\nProfessor D'Onise is now working on removing discrimination in public health.\n\"For me, it's so pleasing to see when public health works. I'm deeply honoured to be recognised and I'm thrilled that public health has also been recognised.\"\n'I get angry and it keeps me going'\nMargaret Findlater-Smith has dedicated more than half a century to improving women's lives.\nThe Canberran, who has served on the boards of the National Council of Women Australia, Equality Rights Alliance and Women's Royal Australian Naval Service (WRANS), has received a Medal of the Order of Australia for service to women's affairs.\n\"You do things not to get rewards or to be recognised, you do things because you feel strongly about it,\" she said.\n\"It's nice to have someone say thank you.\"\nMs Findlater-Smith began her career as a WRANS radio operator in the 50s, before going into public service.\nShe credits her mother's community work for her own dedication.\n\"I think she would have probably ended up in today's life, very similar to what I have done,\" she said.\n\"I get really angry about not much happening for women and that's what has kept me going.\"\nMs Findlater-Smith says there's still more to be done.\n\"We still haven't got equal pay for work or equal value and we still don't have the top standard for parental leave, but we are getting there.\"\nThe truth about filicide\nThea Brown has received a Member of the Order of Australia for significant service to social welfare, particularly through family violence and child protection research.\nThe Monash University emeritus professor has led two of the country's most comprehensive studies into filicide.\nThe grandmother of two told the ABC the issue of filicide in Australia is alarming and relatively unknown, with the rate remaining unchanged for 20 years.\n\"If I had a dollar for everyone who told me that hardly ever happens, I'd be a rich person,\" she said.\n\"It's a complex problem to resolve. How can you stop somebody killing their child?\"\nShe welcomed the team's work being recognised.\n\"It makes me feel that the work we are doing has been seen to have some value in the eyes of some parts of the community. I really appreciate that.\"\nChain reaction\nWest Australian Pat Ryan's first job in child protection helped him see \"how bad it could be\" for young people.\nYears later, he joined Dismantle, a social enterprise group for young people that runs programs like bike-building.\n\"While we're teaching them about how to build a bike, they're actually having a conversation about mental health,\" Mr Ryan said.\n\"Funny enough, we don't care about bikes — we are about young people.\"\nMr Ryan has received the Order of Australia Medal.\n\"What we're trying to do is to lift the profile of social enterprise in WA and show that creating impact at the core of business models can change lives.\"\n'A real need'\nDarwin's Donna Rousham's work with children with disabilities was inspired by her daughter, Tahnee Afuhaamango, who in 2021 broke a swimming world record without even realising it.\nAfuhaamango — who broke the 200-metre freestyle record by six seconds — is a swimmer with Down syndrome.\nMrs Rousham started the Starfish Swim Group for children with special needs in 2007.\n\"We started the swim school because there was a real need for kids with disabilities who couldn't fit into the mainstream programs,\" she said.\n\"We're living in the territory and there are pools and water everywhere, so these kids should not miss out.\"\nMs Rousham has received a Medal of the Order of Australia.\n\"Swimming is just one of the best sports in the territory,\" she said.\n\"I hope this award will lift our group and show how much it's needed in the community.\"\n'Deep gratitude to WA'\nFormer Western Australian premier Mark McGowan is the second COVID-era premier to be given the highest honour — the Companion of the Order of Australia.\nThe former Labor premier stood down last year at a press conference held with just 45 minutes' notice.\nHe has been recognised for service to the people and Parliament of Western Australia, public health and education and international trade relations\n\"My deep gratitude goes to the people of WA for being so kind to me,\" he said.\n\"Thank you to my former colleagues, staff and the Labor Party. I was very fortunate to have their support during my time as premier and throughout my parliamentary career.\n\"Without that support, I would not have achieved anything.\"\nBut the award, he said, belonged to his wife and three children.\nAnyone can nominate any Australian for an award in the Order of Australia.
