But then to be able to come back together again and see the hype is amazing - the Australian public getting behind this team - so I hope it continues.\n\"It was huge for us throughout that tournament, so hopefully it's huge for us now with these qualifiers because it's going to be extremely important for us to have three strong performances.\"\nVan Egmond, who returned from a debilitating back injury to play a pivotal role for Australia in her fourth World Cup, flew into Perth over the weekend and watched on as Newcastle went down 1-0 to Glory in A-League Women on Sunday.\nIn just their second season, van Egmond's Wave finished top of the competition to claim the shield.\n\"It was amazing,\" van Egmond said.\n\"You create your own luck, at the end of the day. We were relying on a result and it went out way.\n\"To win the league in my opinion is massive. To be the most consistent team in a competitive competition over there is very good, especially being the second year of an expansion team.\n\"Now, we'll look forward to a semi-final and hopefully create history again.\"\nBut first, the focus is on the job at hand in Perth.\nThe winner of the Matildas' Group A will join the winners of Group B and Group C, as well as the best-ranked runners-up, in the third round of the Asian Qualifiers in February. The winners of two home-and-away series progress to Paris.\nVan Egmond has 135 caps for the Matildas and has been to two Olympics already. Wheeler, with 14 caps for her country, was unused by Gustavsson during the World Cup and the No.6 will be keen to seize any opportunity given in Perth.\nIN THE NEWS",
