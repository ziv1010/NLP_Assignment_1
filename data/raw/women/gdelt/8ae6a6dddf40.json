Lionel Messi is a god.\nSerious Matters\nJames suffers cardiac arrest\nBronny James, USC freshman basketball player and son of LeBron James, suffered cardiac arrest during practice yesterday. He collapsed and was taken to the hospital and, as of this morning, was out of ICU in stable condition.\nAdvertisement\nIt was a distressing event, and rocked the sports world for much of the day yesterday. It comes less than a year after we watched Bills defensive back Damar Hamlin collapse during a game from cardiac arrest.\nWe have a brief explainer on cardiac arrests in athletes here, which is very much worth your time this morning. One tidbit I want to highlight:\n- Is this happening more often now? Cardiac arrest has afflicted young athletes before. Still, The Mayo Clinic reports that cardiac arrest is still extremely rare in athletes. Many things can trigger it. Hamlin endured commotio cordis, while basketball player Keyontae Johnson — who suffered cardiac arrest during a game in 2020 — was diagnosed with “athlete’s heart.” We still don’t know what caused James’ cardiac arrest.\nMore updates will come through the James family when appropriate. Stay tuned.\nFunny Money\nContextualizing three massive numbers\nThe numbers keep going up, and it makes me feel old. Is this how it happens? It feels like yesterday that a $100 million contract represented a max deal in the NBA. Now it’s what Anfernee Simons and Jarrett Allen make.\nYesterday was a big day for mumbling about big numbers. Let’s start with the lowest one:\nJustin Herbert and the Chargers agreed to a five-year, $262.5 million deal yesterday, with $218 million guaranteed. It’s the second-highest guarantee in league history behind Deshaun Watson’s $230 million. An extension for Herbert was a foregone conclusion, especially after Jalen Hurts signed his deal earlier this offseason. Next up, with what could be a bigger number: Joe Burrow.\nThe Celtics signed Jaylen Brown to a fully guaranteed five-year supermax extension worth $304 million. It’s the richest contract in NBA history, and will pay Brown nearly $70 million in 2028, when he’ll be just 31. He might have another max in him. The numbers feel dizzying, but it’s valuable to reread Mike Vorkunov’s column from last week, which argues that we should be framing NBA contracts differently going forward, based on salary caps.\nIt feels a little more natural with that context, but man, $304 million. Jay King writes that with the contract done, Boston can stop worrying — for now.\nDid you hear about that $1 billion Saudi offer for Kylian Mbappe? The young French superstar is currently at odds with Paris Saint-Germain, who would rather ship him elsewhere than employ him while he waits for a free transfer to Real Madrid. So PIF-controlled Saudi club Al Hilal swooped in with a, yes, $1 billion offer.\nAdvertisement\nAbout $330 million of that would go to PSG, while Mbappe would earn around $770 million for one single year of his services. That’ll make you mutter. Over in the UK, Nick Miller writes that in this new loony soccer world, of course this offer makes sense. Now we wait to see what Mbappe will do.\nBriefs\nMessi, man\nThe crowds are yelling, “Small sample size,” but I don’t care. Lionel Messi is already living up to his unattainable hype in just two matches. He scored twice and assisted on two other goals in Inter Miami’s match yesterday. Paul Tenorio and Pablo Maurer have a full report from the frenzied scene.\nA joy to watch—unless you're a defender.\nRewind all of Messi's moments from a two-goal, one-assist showing against Atlanta in @LeaguesCup action. pic.twitter.com/MxkGHjIDAf\n— Major League Soccer (@MLS) July 26, 2023\nDodgers trade for familiar face\nThe Red Sox traded utility man Kiké Hernández back to the Dodgers yesterday for two pitchers, theoretically addressing needs for both teams. Our trade graders aren’t so sure it’s a great move.\nBarkley drama avoided\nYesterday, the Giants and Saquon Barkley agreed to a new one-year deal worth up to $11 million, slightly more than what Barkley would’ve earned on the franchise tag. The agreement ends what could’ve been a tense training camp holdout. Read more on the surprising deal here.\nKU lineman arrested\nKansas offensive lineman Joe Krause was charged yesterday with “aggravated criminal threat; cause terror, evacuation or disruption,” just hours after campus police responded to a bomb threat against the Kansas football facility. See all the details here.\nWorld Cupdate\nThe rematch is here\nThe U.S. women’s national team squares off against the Netherlands tonight at 9 p.m. ET on FOX in what might be the most anticipated matchup of the group stage. These two teams faced off the 2019 World Cup final, a 2-0 win for the Americans.\nThis matchup isn’t anything like that one, though:\n- For one, star Oranje attacker Vivianne Miedema is out with an ACL injury. As Kimberly McCauley writes in her excellent match preview, Miedema, 27, has been the center of this team’s attack since she was a teenager. Playing without her is a massive change.\n- Watch out for Sophia Smith. One of the Americans’ best players will likely find herself matched up against veteran Dutch captain Sherida Spitse, who’s lost a step at 33 but is still a key player for the Oranje. The 22-year-old Smith is quick in both pace and decision making. It could be a massive advantage.\nRead the rest of Kimberly’s preview here for more tactics talk, including some predictions on how each lineup could look. Also, could Rose Lavelle start? Keep an eye out for lineup announcements today.\nAdvertisement\n“Penalties”\nThe hilarity of Jim Harbaugh’s suspension\nOn the surface, Jim Harbaugh’s pending four-game suspension makes total sense. Harbaugh allegedly lied to NCAA investigators, and now they’re doling out punishment. More context is necessary:\n- Let me be clear: We are no fans of the NCAA’s archaic place in this era of rapid progression for college football. But it’s ironic that Harbaugh, a man who harps on doing the right thing any chance he gets, is in trouble for straight-up lying to the NCAA. I can’t decide if that’s punk rock, hypocritical or a weird combo of both.\n- The infraction is supremely stupid, as Ari Wasserman points out in a great column today. Harbaugh’s lie was about buying recruits hamburgers with his own money. Yes, really. In the age of NIL, we are talking about suspending the coach of a top-five team for buying burgers. It’s time to be done with this idiocy.\n- Harbaugh’s suspension is even funnier. We’ll see if Michigan can survive this brutal stretch without its head coach: East Carolina, UNLV, Bowling Green and Rutgers. If they don’t go 4-0, they aren’t a title contender. But they should roll.\nStuff like this reminds us we are in a netherworld between the old eras of college football and the new. Here’s to hoping burgers are allowed in the future.\nPulse Picks\nA must-read this morning: Ken Rosenthal returns with more of the latest trade rumors, published late last night. The Rays and Diamondbacks might be shifting strategies.\nToday’s A1 is a beautiful story on Celtics announcer Mike Gorman, who is ready for one final season on the mic after a health scare.\nWould the Bills cut Damar Hamlin? One of the league’s most incredible stories could meet its cruelty at the end of training camp.\nWe know it’s not a great time to be a running back. Falcons rookie Bijan Robinson could prove that wrong.\nBroncos coach Sean Payton did not mince words on the NFL’s gambling policy yesterday: “Shame on us.”\nRocky Wirtz saved the Chicago Blackhawks. Then he nearly destroyed them. How do you distill a legacy marked by such extremes?\nThe LA Galaxy is banned from adding new players from abroad this summer. Or are they? Tom Bogert investigates a fascinating loophole.\nTexas quarterback Arch Manning has signed his first NIL deal.\nThe Cowboys and cornerback/interception magnet Trevon Diggs agreed to a new five-year, $97 million deal. One contract extension down for the Cowboys, one to go.\nAces star/WNBA legend Candace Parker is out indefinitely after undergoing foot surgery. The Aces are so loaded they might be OK without her.\n(Photo: Michael Hickey/ Getty Images)",
