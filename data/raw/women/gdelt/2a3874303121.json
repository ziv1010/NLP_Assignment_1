Now in its 72nd year, Wexford Festival Opera continues to amaze and delight in equal measure, when operatic performers from all over the world convene at the National Opera House for two weeks of world-class opera.\nBut of course, the great thing about Wexford Festival Opera is that it about so much more than opera. From lunchtime recitals to pop-up performances, lectures to tours, there is something for everyone during Wexford Festival Opera.\nAdd in Wexford Arts Festival, countless art exhibitions and the hugely successful Spiegeltent Festival and you have a cultural concoction of events that is unmatched anywhere in Ireland.\nBelow is a guide to everything that is happening throughout the next two weeks in Wexford:\nFriday October 20\nOutspoken\n7.30 p.m. Red Books, St Peter’s Square\nOutspoken is Wexford’s monthly spoken-word open-mic.

The event has hosted much-loved local poets like Margaret Galvin, Anne Cousins, Paul Hennessy, Sinead O’Reilly, Ronán P. Berry, Éire Ní Fhaoláin, and many more. Rather than having a special guest, this festival session of Outspoken is an extended open-mic. What makes this one special? Dress code? Outrageously operatic.\nJazz at Johnstown: Cormac Kenevey &Trio\n8 p.m. Johnstown Castle\nIn 2006, Cormac Kenevey funded and recorded his first album This Is Living – a collaboration with the exceptionally talented Dublin stalwart Phil Ware and his Trio whichwas quickly picked up and released by Alan Bates at the CANDID record label in London(home to Stacey Kent and Jamie Cullum). Thus began a career as a jazz singer with astring of critically acclaimed national and international appearances.

His tourdates have included locations in London (Ronnie Scott’s, Pizza Express Dean St), aroundEurope, and as far afield Abu Dhabi and Mexico.\nTulua\n8 p.m. Wexford Arts Centre\nTULUA are a traditional Irish fusion band hailing from the southeast of Ireland.

Together, they have performed Scott 4, Scott Walker’s seminal album and this, in part, has carved out their sound. For this performance at the Wexford Arts Centre expect an eclectic mix of original music, sung by Brian Brody, accompanied by Simon Quigley on piano, a full string section and other interesting instrumentation, as well as dramatic songs that offer hints of Brel and Walker.\nOctober 23-30\nSinging-Swinging Pubs\n9 p.m.-10.45 p.m.\nThe Guinness Wexford Singing and Swinging Pubs competition returns this year after a short sabbatical, perhaps the oldest amateur talent competition in Ireland, stretching back to the 1950s. It’s not just the singing, there is plenty of musical swinging, and it will take place over eight nights, starting at 9 p.m. with the last act at 10.45 p.m. The format is simple: three pubs a night, from October 23 to 30, will host a show before a packed audience and an adjudicator.

Their tears, however, are insincere and when they learn that Buoso has in fact left all his money to a monastery, they become frantic with greed. Buoso’s duplicitous heirs connive to change the will. Rinuccio, who wishes to marry Lauretta, (Gianni Schicchi’s daughter), suggests that the wily Schicchi will have a solution to the family’s dilemma. Schicchi’s plan is to rewrite the will in the family’s favour. Since no one outside the family knows that Buoso is dead, Schicchi will pose as Buoso, change the will and then ‘die.’ The family manages to hoodwink both the doctor and the notary into thinking that Schicchi is Buoso, only to be outwitted at the last by Schicchi who double crosses them and takes the inheritance for himself. Sung in English. A walk through production. Community Opera Sponsor: Energia Group.\nOpera Festival Fireworks\nWexford Quay, 7.15pm\nThe 2023 Wexford Festival Opera is to be officially opened by An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at 7.15 p.m. The traditional fireworks display will follow at 7.30 p.m. over the harbour.

But she is already betrothed to his general Abenamet. Machinations ensue, and though Almuzir tries to dispose of Abenamet, the general outwits the ruler by disguising himself as an unknown knight.

Sister Angelica claims to have no wishes, but the other nuns believe that Sister Angelica has lied. They know her true hope is to hear from her family who she has not had contact with in 7 years. The nuns have heard rumours that Sister Angelica was banished to the convent as punishment. Their conversation is interrupted by the news that a magnificent coach is waiting outside. Sister Angelica is agitated, rightly assuming that her family has come to visit her. The Abbess announces the arrival of Sister Angelica’s aunt, the Princess. The Princess tells Angelica that she must renounce her claim to her inheritance as her sister is to be married. Angelica replies that she has repented of her sin, but she cannot forget her illegitimate child, who was taken from her 7 years ago. Without compassion, the Princess tells Angelica that her son is dead and Sister Angelica, devastated, signs away her inheritance. Heartbroken Sister Angelica decides to end her life, in the hope that she may at least be reunited with her child in death. She realises that by taking her own life she has committed mortal sin and is damned to be eternally separated from her child.

In exchange he will give Cesira passage for her and her daughter Rosetta to Ciociara, the mountain village of Cesira’s youth. However, the decision only plunges the two women’s lives further into war’s criminally abusive ways, their dignity as women stripped from them by war’s weapon of rape. In Ciociara, Cesira encounters townspeople suffering their own wartime privations, and is befriended by the bookish pacifist Michele, who becomes her lover. Giovanni, who is collaborating with the Nazis, pursues her to Ciociara, and a rape occurs when Cesira and Rosetta fall into the hands of marauding Moroccan troops. Rosetta, hardened by the assault, breaks with her mother, but the death of Michele signals a reconciliation — and the presumption of healing — for mother and daughter.
