  "body_text": "The Nigerian women’s national team will now face Cameroon in a one-off international friendly on Tuesday (today) at the MKO Abiola Sports Arena in Abeokuta, following the cancellation of the initial leg originally billed for Saturday at the Remo Stars Stadium in Ikenne, The PUNCH reports.\nLogistical issues on the part of the Cameroonian team, who arrived in Ikenne late on Friday, forced the cancellation of the first leg due to disrupted matchday protocols and recovery schedules.\nThe second leg had initially been moved forward to Monday, June 2, following the cancellation of the first leg, but African football governing, CAF, declined to approve the new date, prompting a return to the original schedule of Tuesday, June 3.\nThe friendly will now serve as a single high-stakes encounter, with both sides aiming to fine-tune preparations ahead of major international engagements.\nFor the Super Falcons, today’s fixture will be their first outing since a narrow 1–0 defeat to France in November and forms a key part of their build-up to the 2024 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco.\nAfrica’s most successful women’s side, Nigeria have lifted the WAFCON title nine times and reached every semi-final since the tournament’s inception in 1991.\nSuper Falcons head coach Justin Madugu has played down concerns about injuries in the squad, confirming that all players in camp are fit for the clash.\n“The team is good to go. At the moment, we’re not experiencing any serious or major injuries that would give us concern. Of course, we don’t know what could happen between now and matchday, but right now, all the girls are fit and ready,” Madugu said ahead of the game.\nHe also addressed the return of experienced forward Francisca Ordega to the national team, after the attacker missed the last international camp due to injury, saying her experience and form merited the recall, and her leadership could be crucial for the younger players in the squad.\n“Francisca was supposed to be part of the team against France, but she had a slight injury that prevented her from joining us. Since then, we’ve monitored her performance. Last year in Russia, she was among the league’s top scorers, and she’s continued in good form since moving to Saudi Arabia.\n“She has earned the opportunity to be here. With her experience, we believe she can help guide the younger players and motivate them through her accomplishments,” he explained.\nThe Falcons’ coach also suggested that the inclusion of several home-based players in the squad was with a view to giving them international exposure, noting that he hoped all the players would get playing time across the two originally planned matches.\n“It was our plan to play two games and give everyone an opportunity to participate. Even with the schedule changes, it’s still our desire to make sure each player has a chance to get on the pitch and feel the intensity of international football.”\nSpeaking on the long-term goal of claiming a record 10th WAFCON title later in coming months in Morocco, Madugu called on Nigerians to continue supporting the team.\n“I appeal to Nigerians to wish the team well and continue to support us. The Super Falcons have earned their place in the hearts of the people through their achievements on the continent. We know what lies ahead, and we are determined to ensure that Mission X becomes a reality.”",
