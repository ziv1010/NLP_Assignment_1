Sharing a sneak peek at the programme at the Edinburgh TV Festival, the streaming site's bosses reckon the pair will come across 'relatable'.\nFestival audiences watched a short teaser on Wednesday, ahead of the series' release. Scenes showed former professional football player Beckham spill on his nighttime routine, giving fans a more intimate look into the star's private life.\nIn a confessional clip, David is seen revealing that he cleans and tidies their home every single night, cutting used wicks from the couple's candle collection. He tells an interviewer his pet peeves when sorting out the family's sprawling home, explaining he hates a 'messy house'.\nIn the episode's preview, his fashion designer and former Spice Girl wife Victoria is later seen gushing over her husband's cleanliness, telling David she appreciates the work he does around the house. But minor drama is sparked when the ex-England striker says he's doubtful that's true.\nAfter showing the clip, Netflix's director of documentary film Kate Townsend explained that female representation behind the camera in her department was strong but she would also like to have more women on screen within their projects.\nNetflix boss Adam Hawkin told attendees how excited he was for the release of the pair's programme, telling festival-goers that he feels the show will highlight elements of the Beckham's married life that viewers will be able to 'relate to'.\nAnother streaming site chief told film fans at Edinburgh TV Festival that despite new releases with notable British bokes, including David, Tyson Fury and Robbie Williams, the company now wants to commission shows with 'icon British women'.\nReferencing their big hitters such as The Crown and Sex Education coming to an end, vice president of UK content at Netflix, Anne Mensah, said the 'future is even stronger' for the steaming site. \"We've got the best team, we're working with the best people, what is not to properly love?\n\"We are working on the back of these incredible shows but the future is even stronger and that’s the best position to possibly be in but it’s really hard that you don’t want to, like, oversell it, but I am so excited.\"\nFollow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.",
