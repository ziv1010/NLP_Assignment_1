  "body_text": "Super Falcons captain Rasheedat Ajibade has seen her PSG Women’s team’s nine-point deduction upheld, despite the club appealing the punishment handed down before last Christmas, PUNCH Sports Extra reports.\nPSG Women were sanctioned over a licensing issue involving Canadian player Florianne Jourde. Jourde reportedly did not possess a FIFA international transfer certificate, which is required for a player to obtain a licence when changing clubs.\nPSG Women, however, maintained that they acted in good faith and with full transparency, noting that the French Football Federation (FFF) had validated the move by issuing Jourde a licence.\nThe French giants initially protested the ruling, but following their appeal, the decision was upheld on Wednesday.\nThe club were first sanctioned by the FFF on December 22, 2025, after a complaint lodged by Fleury, a team PSG had defeated 4-0 on November 8.\nAs part of the punishment, the FFF extended the forfeiture to two earlier league fixtures, also victories, against Le Havre (2-0) and Strasbourg (1-0). Other results prior to those matches were deemed time-barred.\nThe penalty has dropped PSG to fifth place on the league table. They recently lost 1-0 to leaders Lyon and will now turn their attention to Saturday’s derby clash against second-placed Paris FC.\nAjibade, meanwhile, returned to first-team action two weeks ago after being sidelined with injury since November.\nSince joining the club in the summer, the Super Falcons star has made eight league appearances, providing one assist, but she is yet to open her goal-scoring account.\nWith eight games to go in the league this season, she will hope to inspire the club to the final play-offs.",
