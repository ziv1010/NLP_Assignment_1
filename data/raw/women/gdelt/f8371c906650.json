Here, we take a look at her life off the pitch from her net worth to her relationships...\nFamily\nThe Nottingham-born ace is close with her family and has said they all keep her grounded with her new-found success. Speaking to GQ Magazine, she revealed that it was during a kickabout in the garden with her dad and brother that she decided she wanted to be a professional footballer. So she joined a local team and her supportive parents took her to matches and training. \"I was playing a local Saturday match and saved a penalty,\" she said. That was the moment she knew she wanted to be a keeper.\nHer parents were the first people she messaged when she was nominated for FIFA's Best Award. \"I was blown away [to be nominated]. There aren't loads of awards around for goalkeepers,\" Mary told BBC Sport.\n\"I texted my mum and dad straight away. They humbly replied with just 'well done'. It was a standard Earps family reply, super chilled. It's really nice and the real icing on the cake. It doesn't happen often and it never really happens to me so I forget [these awards] exist in a way. To be named on the shortlist, it came out of the blue, and it was really cool.\"\nAre you happy that Mary Earps won Sports Personality of the Year?

In September 2020, she was hoping her efforts for Manchester United would earn her a recall to the England team - but, she didn't make it. Goalkeepers Carly Telford, Ellie Roebuck, Hannah Hampton and Sandy MacIver were all picked ahead of her.\nUpon hearing the news, Mary sank to her kitchen floor and broke down. She recalled: \"I got to a point where I felt I had sort of reached my limits. I had given football a good go, but wasn't quite good enough. I had responsibilities, I had a mortgage and it wasn't adding up.\" Mary stuck with football for another two years and has since proven that she has a rightful place back in the squad, competing in the 2023 Women's World Cup. \"We don't fear anyone\" was her message ahead of one game against Nigeria at Brisbane Stadium as an inspiration to all.\nNet worth\nBefore she made it in England, Mary was juggling low-paid, part-time jobs so that she could make enough petrol money to drive to training for Doncaster Belles. Earps used to work part-time in a cinema, a toy shop, two coaching jobs and even for her dad's company.\nSpeaking on Jill Scott's podcast, she explained: \"That summer I was just moving on to my A-Levels, I had a job in the cinema, a job at a kids' toy shop, two coaching jobs and I worked with my dad's business, where I was doing some telesales work for him. I had quite a few jobs to pay for my boots and petrol basically.\"\nShe continued: \"I used to get expenses with Doncaster but there was no real money in the game back then. At first I had not passed my driving test so I was relying on my local team-mates for help. There was a girl who even drove from Southampton up to Doncaster and used to pick me up on the way. It is mad how the game has changed since then.\"\nMary also completed a degree in Information Management and Business Studies at Loughborough and did an extra year at school to make sure she could meet the entry grades. Posting a graduation snap on Instagram, she wrote: \"Today I graduated from one of the top universities in the country, the university that I've always dreamed of attending, with a 2:1 degree in Business... and it's safe to say that the stress, sweat, tears and sleep deprivation were all worth it. Thank you for a challenging and unforgettable four years.\"\nThese days, she's reported to be worth £2.4million thanks to her Manchester United wages of £318,000 a season, coupled with her impressive social media audiences.\nLove life\nAway from football, the pro player lives her best life travelling the world and spending time with her loved ones at home. It is unknown whether Mary is in a relationship and she chooses to keep much of her personal and love life private. Though she is the TikTok queen of the Lionesses with a following of over 1 million, and regularly joins in the latest trends or shows behind-the-scenes footage of matches to let fans in on the reality of being part of the England women's team.\nOne scan of Mary's Instagram account (@1maryearps) and you'll spot her holidaying it up in Madrid, Dubai, Australia and Berlin. Mary loves to snap a happy and relaxed shot when she's taking a break from football and soaking up the sun abroad. And she's no stranger to a pun, captioning a photo of her in Greece : \"I can finally say that I've been to Greece, better late than feta.\" Another picture of her rowing a boat in Spain reads: \"When you're trying to do a cute pout but forget you don't have a top lip.\"\nAs well as achieving numerous awards, Mary has been supported by her local community and even has a bus named after her in her hometown, West Bridgford, near Nottingham. She is often stopped for photographs and spotted in the street by fans - though it's taken some getting used to. She told Vogue: \"A lot has changed since our Euros win, including the profile of the game. I'm trying to adjust to and enjoy the attention that comes with success. Not that I would have it any other way.\"\nOutside of goalkeeping, Mary has a degree in information management and business studies too, but she's most passionate about shaping the future of football for females. She told GQ: \"'I'm very ambitious about wanting to push myself to reach my absolute maximum potential and change the landscape of female goalkeeping. You know, just small goals.\"",
