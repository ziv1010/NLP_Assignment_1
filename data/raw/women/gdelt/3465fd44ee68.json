  "body_text": "FOOTBALL – Chelsea beat Ajax 3-0 away in the first leg of the Women’s Champions League quarterfinals last night to close in on a second straight appearance in the last four of Europe’s top competition.\nEngland forward Lauren James opened the scoring and Germany midfielder Sjoeke Nusken added goals either side of halftime for Chelsea, which is bidding to win the Champions League for the first time.\nThe second leg is at Stamford Bridge on March 27.\nThe London club is chasing a quadruple of major trophies in coach Emma Hayes’ final season in charge before she takes the helm of the United States’ women’s national team. Hayes’ team leads the Women’s Super League, is into the final of the English League Cup and has reached the quarterfinals of the FA Cup.\nAjax are competing in the knockout stage of the Champions League for the first time and caused plenty of problems for Chelsea early on at Johan Cruyff Arena, only to concede goals from the visitors’ only two shots of the first half.\nJames rounded the goalkeeper and slotted home in the 19th minute for a goal that stood after a VAR check for offside, before Nusken slid in to convert the second in the 44th.\nNüsken headed in the third goal in the 83rd to leave Chelsea in total control.\nLater, eight-time winners Lyon came from behind to defeat Benfica and put themselves in a strong position to progress from the quarter-finals.\nThe hosts took the lead through Portugal midfielder Andreia Faria’s composed finish in Lisbon. Delphine Cascarino equalised before Germany midfielder Sara Dabritz headed the winner in the 79th minute.\nThe second leg takes place in France next Wednesday.\nLyon, who last won the competition in 2022, will be favourites to finish the job next week.\nBenfica had started strongly with Andrea Falcon having an attempt tipped on to the bar before Faria’s goal.\nThe winners of the tie will face Swedish side Hacken or Paris St-Germain over two legs in the semi-finals.\nMeanwhile, SK Brann coach Martin Ho is keen to prove that his side can get the better of reigning title-holders FC Barcelona when the two sides meet in the quarter-finals tonight, despite the obvious gap in resources.\nFacing a Barcelona squad bristling with internationals including Norway’s Caroline Graham Hansen and Ingrid Syrstad Engen, Ho said he has no fears as his team face their toughest test yet in Bergen after making it out of the group stage.\n“What I’ve tried to focus on is how can we be most effective with the resources we have, how can we best prepare the players, give them confidence and belief that they can go into the game and be competitive and get a result,” Ho told Reuters.\n“It’s more focused on what we can do to give ourselves the chance of being competitive, and I believe that on the day, with that bit of luck that every team needs, including the top teams, you can get a result.”\nThe 33-year-old Englishman took the reins at Brann last July and successfully steered them through a group stage, drawing 2-2 at home with French giants Olympique Lyonnais and edging out St. Poulten of Austria and Slavia Prague from the Czech Republic to qualify in second spot.\nWhile Norway are one of only five nations to have won the Women’s World Cup, the country’s clubs have often struggled at the European level. But Brann’s performances this term and the development in the team have caught the attention of many fans.",
