Shortly after, Serbia broke the deadlock as Nina Matejic slotted the ball past Katie Cox.\nAlthough time looked to be running out for the Young Lionesses, John Griffiths’ side managed to grab an equaliser in the first minute of injury time as Mia Enderby converted from the spot.\nThe result against Serbia means England will just need to avoid defeat to France on Saturday (4pm UK) if they’re to progress to the knockout stages of the tournament.",
