  "body_text": "COLLINGWOOD has parted ways with coach Steve Symonds after the Magpies missed the AFLW finals for the first time in five seasons.\nNeeding to beat Richmond by a heavy margin in the last round to make their fifth consecutive finals appearance, the Magpies were instead handed a 52-point thrashing.\nThe club announced Symonds' contract would not be renewed on Wednesday, saying the decision was \"mutual\".\n\"This decision aligns with the club's strategic direction and our commitment to developing our elite women's football programs,\" club executive general manager of football Graham Wright said.\n\"Steve has been a significant part of our club's journey in the AFLW, and we are grateful for his contribution over the past five seasons.\"\nSymonds is the second coach to exit this season following the departure of Michael Prior at West Coast.\nSymonds replaced inaugural coach Wayne Siekman in 2019, steering the club to their first finals campaign in 2020.\nSpending five seasons at the helm, Symonds marked his 50th game as coach in their round-nine loss to Sydney.\nThis is the first time under Symonds' tenure that Collingwood has failed to play finals.\nChallenged by injury and form issues, the Pies notched only five wins across the season and finished in 11th place.\n\"I am incredibly proud of what we have achieved during my time at Collingwood and feel it's the right time for the program and myself to move in a different direction,\" Symonds said.\n\"I have been privileged to work with an incredible group of athletes and staff and I thank them for their support over the past five seasons.\"",
