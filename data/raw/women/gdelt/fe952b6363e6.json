I couldn’t care less!\nBecause pregnant women and families are being failed on your watch and what are you doing about it?\nAs very soon there is an election looming and the public will have the opportunity to remove you from your Ivory Tower.\nPeter Todd\nThurso\nEnough capacity for power link already\nIn recent articles published in Highland News & Media titles, it is stated about SSEN’s Pathway to 2030 project that: “The scale of the project is enormous but in simple terms it involves improving the grid in the north of Scotland so renewable energy can be transmitted from the Highlands, Shetland and the Western Isles to Drax, in North Yorkshire.”\nI looked at the numbers and they don’t add up. The capacity the Eastern Green Link 2 [which will transfer power to Drax] can carry is 2GW and the infrastructure to deliver that capacity is already in place.\nThe onshore network can export 1.1GW from Caithness and Sutherland south (this number is taken from NESO’s ten year electricity statement) and there is a subsea link separate from the onshore transmission going from Caithness to Morayshire carrying 0.8GW.\nIn addition, the large offshore wind farm fields built off the east coast of Caithness with a combined capacity of 2.3GW link directly into Morayshire.\nMoreover, there is another offshore subsea link getting built just now connecting Caithness directly with Peterhead, adding yet another 2GW. This offshore link, by the way, was consented without much procedure by Marine Scotland and the onshore development was pushed through under permitted development rights even though the impact on the county will be massive.\nThus the capacity of the Eastern Green Link 2 is more than covered with the infrastructure already built.\nThe 400kV Spittal-Beauly OHL SSEN plans for the far north of Scotland as part of the Pathway to 2030 project will add another staggering 6GW to the capacity we can already export. This is not to help with the current restrictions of the grid – grid restrictions are not in north Scotland, they are between Scotland and England and in England.\nThis is the beginning of a new wave of developments on a much bigger scale than anything we have seen so far. Nothing in the planning system yet requires this extra transmission capacity. But once the capacity is there it will get filled.\nThe scale of the impact on our landscape and seascape and the impact on life in the countryside will also be of a scale not yet seen. And with that the amount of constraint payments added to our bills will be of a scale not yet seen.\nThat SSEN refuse to answer the question why the line is needed despite being questioned again and again, including in the last few planning meetings of the Highland Council, is a clear indicator that there is no such need.\nKathrin Haltiner\nWesterdale\nNuclear needed to keep the lights on\nThe SNP’s fury over what they call Miliband’s “nuclear tax” has raised a wry smile among those who actually understand how our energy system works.\nThe Scottish Government hasn’t thought this one through at all. In their rush to attack the UK government they’ve ended up looking both silly and spectacularly nimby.\nScotland is perfectly entitled to decide whether it wants nuclear power on its own soil – that isn’t the issue. The issue is pretending that refusing to host nuclear somehow means we don’t rely on it and shouldn’t pay for it.\nEvery time the wind fails – particularly during those freezing winter highs when thousands of turbines stand stock‑still for days, monuments to Holyrood’s energy delusion – it is imported nuclear (and the much‑demonised gas) that keeps our lights on.\nNothing illustrates the madness more clearly than the belief that a modern country can run on weather‑dependent energy alone, or that it is sensible to give global investment firms and multinationals free rein to carve up rural Scotland to enrich their shareholders.\nWe are now living with the consequences of the “build, build, build” cart‑before‑horse policy: rotating cash machines for investors, constructed without guaranteed customers, funnelling into a choke point at the border.\nScotland can and does export energy, but only when the receiving transmission system can take it – and increasingly, it can’t. The result? Consumers paying ever more in constraint payments just to switch turbines off.\nWhat other industry is encouraged to build a product with no route to market – and then gets paid handsomely when no one can take it because the transport ended up in a traffic jam and couldn’t be delivered?\nAnd now, to justify even more over‑deployment, we are told that vast new battery installations will “solve” the problem by soaking up excess wind power. Battery storage capable of running a national grid or restarting it after a blackout is, at present, just a fantasy and it will do nothing to fix the fundamental mismatch between wind output and actual demand.\nBillions are being handed over in curtailment, subsidies, and guaranteed pricing, all added to our energy bills. And let’s be clear: these constraints exist because of the ability of potential customers to accept wind energy, not because of the Scottish grid, as we are so often told. Our grid can cope perfectly well with a few minor upgrades for what is already built and in the pipeline.\nThe current bizarre, over‑the‑top pylon proposals are to enable hundreds – if not thousands – more onshore turbines to satisfy Holyrood’s ideological obsession with wind. If approved, they will not serve Scotland; they will serve only the energy giants who stand to profit.\nCommunities across Scotland are exhausted by the bullying, the pressure, and the relentless exploitation of the landscapes they call home.\nSo yes, the Scottish Government may stamp its feet about Scots paying for nuclear. But the foot‑stomping from the rest of the UK over Holyrood’s reckless and frankly unhinged over‑deployment of wind should trigger an earthquake high on the Richter scale.\nLyndsey Ward\nCommunities B4 Power Companies\nBeauly\nCall for action on orthopaedics\nThis week we saw leaders of the SNP, Scottish Labour and the Scottish Conservatives set out their stalls ahead of a critical election now less than 120 days away. The NHS was centre stage, with all three leaders making welcome comments about improving Scotland’s health service and tackling waiting lists.\nOrthopaedics – mostly hip and knee operations – currently accounts for nearly a third of NHS Scotland waiting times with around 7000 waits of over a year for orthopaedic surgery.\nDespite the celebrations from Neil Gray’s press release earlier in the week on monthly figures from Public Health Scotland, the Scottish Government is certain to miss its own target to eliminate waits over 52 weeks by March.\nIndeed, 167 less patients were seen for orthopaedic surgery in November 2025 compared to October 2025 – a 4 per cent decrease.\nGreen shoots do appear; as the First Minister mentioned in his speech on Monday, there were a record number of hip and knee operations last year.\nThe £135 million from the Scottish Government to tackle waiting times is making some difference – even if targets are not being met. For some health boards however, the tide has not turned.\nIt is vital that the Scottish Government – regardless of its political make-up after May 2026 – continues this increase in multi-year investment if Scotland is to effectively tackle the historical backlog and the injustice of waiting such a long time for cost-effective life changing surgery.\nThe 1.7 million people in Scotland living with arthritis and other musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions need 2026 to be the year politicians prioritise these conditions to reflect the sheer scale and impact they are having on Scotland’s public health, economy and society.\nComments and rhetoric during the election campaign are important – action is paramount.\nLauren Bennie\nHead of Scotland, Arthritis UK\nWhat a coup...\nThe U.S. military arsenal is vast, it has over a million military personnel, thousands of aircraft, numerous ships (some with carriers), 4600 tanks, nearly 400,000 armoured vehicles and 1770 nuclear warheads.\nDo you think if we spoke nicely to him, allowed him to capture Mr and Mrs Swinney (or even better, Douglas Ross) and run Scotland, he would throw in a couple of snowploughs?\nFiona Murray\nWeydale\nONLINE VIEWS\n‘We just keep trying to improve’: The team effort driving John O’Groats forward\nVery interesting article about the improvements to John O’Groats. My wife and I visit Scotland most years and have been impressed by the work done – improved football pitch, good places to eat such as Cafe Groat, great service from staff in the Post Office, Groatie Buckie Shop and the Tourist Office and Jeri at the Mill, to name but a few.\nWe have often visited Orkney and passed Stroma, wondering what it would be like to go there, so really looking forward to getting on to the island.\nBrian Weir\nArmagh",
