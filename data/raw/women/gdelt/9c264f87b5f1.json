  "body_text": "Let me begin with some good advice: never watch a rock biopic with a music journalist. Certainly, an adherence to this rule might have saved my wife a measure of worry when she thought I was suffering a medical emergency during a screening of Bohemian Rhapsody at my local Odeon. Hearing gasps of horror, she asked me what was wrong? “It’s what that guy playing Roger Taylor just said,” I replied. “About Queen being uneasy about playing Live Aid cos they hadn’t done a gig for years.” And what of it? “Well, it’s wrong. They toured the year before. They played four nights at Wembley Arena!”\nAt least she now knows to ignore any shrieks of displeasure I might let loose while witnessing portrayals of a musician’s life splayed onto celluloid. Which is good, because music biopics are a profitable and ongoing fixture in cinemas worldwide. My question as to why a film crew were gathered in a nearby pie and mash shop on Royal College Street was answered recently when I saw the trailer to Back To Black, a forthcoming picture about the life and death of Amy Winehouse.\nAnd this week it has emerged that Sam Mendes is to make individual biopics of all four Beatles, to be released together in 2027, and that Ridley Scott plans to direct a film about the Bee Gees. It’s likely this evergreen genre will be ah-ah-ah-ah staying alive longer than I will.",
