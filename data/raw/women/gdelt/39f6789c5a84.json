  "body_text": "Real Madrid’s 18-year-old striker Alvaro Rodriguez made his La Liga debut on Saturday. His rise to the first team has been surprising, dazzling and somewhat chaotic.\nAll of this is reflected in the details of his past week, as Rodriguez travelled almost 6,500 miles, played 70 minutes of football in two matches in less than 24 hours, then made Madrid’s squad for their Champions League last-16 first leg against Liverpool.\nAdvertisement\nHere’s the story of his past seven days — and the longer journey that has brought him into the limelight.\nTuesday, February 14\nRodriguez lands in Madrid from Bogota, Colombia, where he was playing in the South American Under-20 Championship with Uruguay. He played in seven of their nine matches, the last one on Sunday, February 12, as his country finished runners-up.\nThe striker scored five goals at an average of one goal every 100 minutes as Uruguay qualified for the Under-20 World Cup to be played in May and June.\nHe arrives in Spain with jet lag, but has breakfast with his family and goes straight to low-intensity training with Real Madrid Castilla, essentially the club’s reserve team but one that is packed with youth players and is considered part of the academy. Castilla play in Spain’s third tier and are managed by club legend Raul.\nOn Wednesday and Thursday, Rodriguez trains normally. On Thursday, he is informed he will train with the first team the next day.\nFriday, February 17\nRodriguez trains under the orders of Real Madrid head coach Carlo Ancelotti, who, in the absence of Karim Benzema, includes him in the squad for Saturday’s trip to Osasuna.\nIt is Miguel ‘Chendo’ Porlan, a former Madrid player and now first-team delegate, who tells Rodriguez the good news, after a regular meeting between Raul, Carlo Ancelotti and Davide Ancelotti, the Italian’s assistant and son.\nThe head coach praises Rodriguez in the pre-match press conference: “We trust him. He gives us a profile that we don’t have.”\nSaturday, February 18\nRodriguez travels to Pamplona. He made his senior debut for Madrid on January 3, coming off the bench for 23 minutes against third-tier Cacereno in the Copa del Rey. Now he wants more.\nThe forward takes his place among the substitutes at El Sadar with that special match-night feeling. With the score at 0-0, he warms up.\nAdvertisement\nMadrid’s assistant coach calls him over. But there’s a change of plan. Uruguayan Federico Valverde, Rodriguez’s ‘big brother’, scores to make it 1-0. The young striker takes his place back on the bench again. Time to wait, maybe for nothing.\nGO DEEPER\nInside ‘La Fabrica’: How Real Madrid’s academy turned into a talent factory supplying Spain\nEight minutes later, the much-anticipated moment comes. Rodriguez is Ancelotti’s third substitution, replacing Rodrygo in the 88th minute.\nFinally on the pitch, with one of his first touches in Spanish league football, he provides the pass for Vinicius Junior to score, but the VAR disallows it for a fractional offside.\nRodriguez does not stop. In stoppage time, he recovers the ball and drives towards goal before finding Marco Asensio to his left. Asensio slots home and this time, it really is 2-0. Rodriguez has his assist and the pair celebrate together.\nThe match ends and Rodriguez hugs, and is hugged, by everyone, including Ancelotti, who congratulates him. He could hardly have been expected to do more.\nHis mother, Pilar, and her husband, Juan Carlos, are waiting for him, too. It is touching to see Rodriguez — known as ‘El Toro’, the bull — hugging and kissing both of them.\nRaul, after talking to Davide Ancelotti, tells him that he is counting on him for Castilla’s match the next day in Madrid.\nSunday, February 19\nEver since Rodriguez entered the orbit of the first team, his entourage have been repeating the same message to keep him on his toes. Sunday morning’s version must have gone something like this: “The most special game was against Osasuna; the most important is against Linares.”\nJust 17 hours after the Osasuna game, Rodriguez starts and plays 63 minutes in Castilla’s Primera Federacion 2-0 win against Linares. His side go top of the table.\nAfter the match, there is more big news.\nRaul tells him he will travel on Monday to Liverpool for the first leg of the Champions League round of 16.\nAdvertisement\nMonday, February 20\nRodriguez continues to live what feels like a dream. At around 11am Spanish time, he flies with the rest of the Real Madrid squad to Liverpool. At 7pm UK time, he trains at one of football’s temples, Anfield.\nSo, what next? And where did Rodriguez come from?\nRodriguez’s chances of playing against Liverpool are low. Benzema will start, most likely with Valverde and Vinicius Jr completing the attacking three. The second half might well see Rodrygo come on… and let’s see who else.\nWhatever happens, it will be another day to remember after the most remarkable week Rodriguez will have experienced since joining Madrid from Girona in the summer of 2020.\nRodriguez grew up in Girona, not far from Barcelona, and was known at La Masia, the club’s famed youth academy, but no attempt was made to sign him. There was a view that he didn’t possess ‘Barca DNA’.\nMadrid took advantage and a source involved in negotiations with the player, who spoke with The Athletic anonymously to protect their position, said once their interest was known, Rodriguez, as a Madrid fan, did not have eyes for anyone else.\nBut at Madrid, there wasn’t unanimity over the deal. His physique was admired as having the potential to develop, but with some shortcomings. They were also unconvinced that his position, as a left-winger, was ideal for his skill set.\nIn his first year, in the under-17s led by Roberto Rodriguez, who is now head of methodology and scouting for Madrid’s women’s youth teams, he suffered a lot of injuries. So a very specific physical plan was designed.\nRodriguez played some games that season as a striker but was moved more permanently into that position for Fran Beltran’s under-18s the following year. By that point, it became clear he wanted to be a centre-forward.\nIn that 2021-22 season, he moved away from the wing for good and learned his new role by binge-watching videos of Romelu Lukaku.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Raul, Rodriguez’s childhood idol, heard about a great game he played at Atletico Pinto, he asked for videos and reports about him. Then he watched him live and decided to bring him in for the following matchday with Castilla. On January 8, 2022, Rodriguez scored his first goal with Madrid’s second team and cried with the emotion of it all.\nRodriguez’s career was launched. Raul played a big role, believing in him like no one else and even overseeing a new, very specific physical training plan for him.\n“Raul sees things in the boy, he’s mentored him and started to polish him,” says one of several club sources who preferred to speak anonymously to protect their position.\n“He detects that he is a sponge: he listens and internalises. Raul chooses him ahead of the under-18 strikers who are very well regarded.”\nAnother such source added: “With the under-18s, Rodriguez was like Erling Haaland. He’s quicker than people think and if they try not to give him space, he gets his back in, brings the ball down and distributes. In the box, he finishes any aerial ball. Down low, if he turns he can shoot with both feet.”\nGO DEEPER\nSenior stars stepping up and a new teenager: how Real Madrid coped without Benzema\nRodriguez wears a 13.5 shoe in UK sizes. He is a music lover and is described as very humble. His self-confidence is also highlighted.\nWhen it became known that 18-year-old striker Iker Bravo was joining Castilla on loan from Bayer Leverkusen, having already made his Bundesliga debut, Rodriguez still saw himself as ‘Raul’s No 9’.\nIn the dressing room of the senior team, he has been supported above all by his compatriot Valverde, but also by other youth-academy graduates such as Nacho Fernandez and Lucas Vazquez. Rodriguez asked for Valverde’s shirt when he first made Madrid’s first-team squad, against Sevilla in October.\nIn August, Rodriguez renewed his contract until 2027 and his new deal contains a series of performance-related triggers that will permanently improve his salary as he continues to develop.\nAdvertisement\nAncelotti and his staff like the player, although no decision has been made on plans for him for 2023-2024. It may well be that he stays with Castilla while continuing to experience time with the first team, especially if Raul’s side are promoted to Spain’s second tier.\nBut of course, Rodriguez might well end up forcing a quicker decision if, as those who know him best expect, he continues on his rise.\n(Top photo: David S Bustamante/Soccrates/Getty Images)\nThe Athletic’s Spanish football coverage has expanded…\n- La Liga news, La Liga table; La Liga fixtures and results\n- Dermot Corrigan is joined by four new writers…\n- Real Madrid news from Mario Cortegana and Guillermo Rai\n- Barcelona news from Pol Ballús and Laia Cervelló Herrero",
