  "body_text": "Norwich City Women's boss says a heavy home defeat “doesn’t affect how great the girls are”.\nThe Canaries were run ragged by Hashtag United at The Nest on Sunday, losing 7-1 after being five goals clear at half time.\nCity’s reply was a well-worked effort that split the dominant Hashtag defence for second-half substitute Olivia Cook to put away.\nManager Shaun Howes was proud of his team in defeat.\n\"We’ve lost a game of football,\" he said. \"That might affect our league posting, but that doesn’t affect how great the girls are.\n“We’ve lost to a really good team, but the character the girls showed in that second half was amazing.\n“They're a very good team. They have got quality all over the pitch and have players that played at this level and the ones above.”\nTo prove Howes’s point, Hashtag signed ex-England under-17 and ex-Women Super League player, Maisy Barker, on the morning of the game.\n“That’s what we’re competing against,\" added Howes. \"We're in Norfolk and we sign girls from Waveney and other teams and their signing girls from the WSL.\n\"So that’s where we want to aspire to get to, but it’s a bit more difficult when you have the girls here who are playing for the love of the game not for financial gains, and we live in Norfolk!\n\"There are still massive positives. The girls never gave up, we got a goal which, on the second-half performance, we deserved. They could have felt sorry for themselves at half-time, but instead they came out and gave it a go.”\nCanaries defender Chardonnay Johnston took a knock early on in the first half when the game was 0-0 and Howes believes it proved to be a turning point.\n“I think the first half we were rocked a bit by Chardonnay getting injured, it took us a little while to get back to that,\" said Howes. \"Then we conceded three quick goals. Our confidence and our heads dropped and you could see that.\n“We never look at the league. We just want to keep growing and developing and making ourselves better as a team. This will make us better.\n“We’re about getting crowds in and the community engagement.”\nNext week City have a derby against King’s Lynn Town Ladies in the county cup and while Lynn are in a lower league they will not be taken lightly by Howes.\n“We will take it like every game and do our due diligence,” Howes said.\nKatie Knights got stuck into every challenge and kept running for the whole game, something she was proud of - but ultimately it wasn't an afternoon to enjoy.\nShe said: “As the game was going on I had it in my head to try as hard as I can and fight for everything as that’s all I could really do.\n“Really, really disappointing. A really tough game. They're a great team who move the ball really quickly, but everyone is still really disappointed.\n“I think we started really well, on the front foot, getting in their faces and Chardonnay's injury knocked us.\n“I think if we had played how we did in the second half earlier on we would have given ourselves a better shot, but I do think we can be proud of the second-half performance.\n“I think we were a different team who showed what we are about.\"\nThis result leaves Hashtag United 11 points above City, who are fourth, behind Wimbledon and London Seaward. Knights is still confident they will finish in the top two though.\n“The race for second is something we will give our everything for,\" she said. \"I think it’s something we are absolutely capable of when we play as well as we know we can.”",
