He looks completely different,” she told The Telegraph.\nWhile the families of many of the other hostages have asked the media not to use Hamas’s videos of them in captivity, dismissing them as propaganda, Hersh’s parents want the world to see it.\n“People have forgotten that (the hostages) are actual, real people,” she said.\nMs Goldberg-Polin and her husband John have turned campaigning for the release of their only son into a full-time job.\nWhen she arrived for her interview with The Telegraph, Ms Goldberg-Polin, a petite woman with a neat bun of silver hair, wore a plain white T-shirt with the number 207 written in strips of duct tape.\nShe and her husband began wearing numbers to mark how many days Hersh had been in captivity after growing tired of journalists constantly asking how long it had been since their son was taken.\n“You know how in America when you go to conferences they put stickers on you with your name on? This is my name. My name today is 207,” she said, adding that the stickers also serve as an uncomfortable reminder of the plight of the hostages – something the Goldberg-Polins fear is becoming less acute to many Israelis as the war drags on.\n“I think it makes people uncomfortable, which people should be because we failed them: Every day is another day of failure,” she said.\nWith Israeli leaders talking up the potential for a breakthrough in the hostage negotiations, Ms Goldberg-Polin said she had lived through many such moments in the last seven months of war, moments which seemed pivotal but turned out to be merely posturing.\n“There’s a lot of posturing and game playing and theatre – and we’re just extras in the movie we did not sign up for,” she said.\nOn Tuesday, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, vowed to press on with the planned invasion of Rafah in southern Gaza, a move that many say could dampen prospects for a hostage deal and endanger the hostages themselves who are likely to be kept in underground tunnels in southern Gaza.\nHersh’s parents feared the worst when Hamas released a preview screenshot of the video with Hersh an hour before it was released. Other videos released by the group showed hostages dead, supposedly killed by Israeli airstrikes.\nMrs Goldberg-Polin remembers exactly when she saw her firstborn last.\nHe was saying goodbye after the dinner marking the last night of Sukkot on Friday, Oct 6. Hersh and his best friend got their backpacks and went off camping.\n“At around 11pm, he kissed John and he kissed me. He turned around really casually in the doorway and said ‘Love you, see you tomorrow’,” his mother said. “That was 208 nights ago.”\nLike most people in Israel on Oct 7, Ms Goldberg-Polin, her husband and their two daughters were woken up by air raid sirens as air defences roared into life in response to a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza.\nThe family were keeping Sabbath, but Ms Goldberg-Polin decided to break it as she had no idea where those attacks would catch Hersh, who did not tell her where exactly he was going.\nWhen she turned on her phone close to 8.30am, she saw two messages pop up on the screen. One said “I love you”, the other said, “I’m sorry”.\n“I already knew something horrible was happening,” she said.\nThe IDF scrambled to respond to the unprecedented attack, and it was only 48 hours later before Israeli troops caught the last Hamas fighters on Israeli soil.\nHersh’s family assumed he had died when they saw the first images of the carnage at the Nova music festival on the edge of the Negev desert – around 260 festivalgoers were killed in the massacre there.\nBut they later came across a photo showing partygoers huddling in a bomb shelter - before Hamas fighters started throwing grenades inside to smoke them out.\nJohn and Rachel managed to track down the other people in the photo, who told them Hersh had grabbed hold of one of the grenades and tried to throw it out of the shelter to save the others.\nThen, a grainy video emerged showing Hersh being loaded onto a pickup truck with other captives in a dusty field near Kibbutz Re’im.\nHe was missing the lower half of his left arm and appeared to have fashioned a makeshift tourniquet out of a strip of clothing.\nHowever horrible it was for the parents to see their son covered in blood and missing a limb, the Goldberg-Polins finally got hope he was alive.\n“This is when you start to live on another planet because our first thought was ‘Oh, thank God, he was kidnapped’, which is not what normal people say.”\nThe deal offered by mediators to Israel and Hamas reportedly calls on the terrorist group to initially release at least 33 vulnerable hostages – women, children, elderly or wounded, which could potentially include Hersh.\nMrs Goldberg-Polin does not count on a sure release as the decision-making between the two sides seems opaque: “They’re not asking the mum. I don’t know who’s going to make the list.”",
