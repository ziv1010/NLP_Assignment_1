  "body_text": "OPINION: Cutting red tape and making life more affordable for Albertans\nPublished 11:00 am Friday, January 30, 2026\nBy MLA Jackie Lovely\nFamilies in communities across the Camrose constituency work hard and share a deep sense of pride in our way of life. Like all Albertans, parents in our region want a fair shot for their kids, a reliable job, and a government that always respects their time and money.\nThat’s why United Conservatives remain focused on making life more affordable, cutting unnecessary red tape, and investing in services that benefit real people in real communities.\nFor many families, the cost of registering a child for hockey or soccer can be a major affordability concern. That’s why United Conservatives are helping more kids get in the game.\nThrough programs like KidSport and Every Kid Can Play, thousands of young Albertans are getting help with registration fees so costs won’t keep them stuck on the sidelines. Sports help kids stay active, build confidence, and become leaders. Supporting families so their kids can participate is an investment in a healthier and stronger tomorrow.\nLast year, United Conservatives provided $8 million in funding through the Every Kid Can Play program to expand access to sports and recreation for children and youth. KidsSport Alberta received $3.5 million in 2025 with an additional $547,000 in funding this year to reach even more Alberta families. This combined funding will directly support more than 1,500 additional kids to join a soccer league, play hockey, or learn martial arts.\nAt the same time, we know families and small businesses are tired of paperwork, delays, and outdated rules. That’s why United Conservatives have been leading the way in cutting red tape.\nSince 2019, we have eliminated nearly 220,000 government hurdles and saved Albertans over $3 billion. With faster, simpler approval processes and the Automatic Yes Toolkit, businesses that follow the rules can open, expand, or invest with more confidence. So far, the toolkit has reduced wait times for about 25 per cent of all government permits. That means businesses can make first sales sooner, expand faster, and give investors more certainty.\nWe’re also focused on strengthening health care in ways that matter to families, especially in rural communities like ours. Midwives play an important role in supporting women, newborns, and growing families, and United Conservatives are working to expand access to midwifery care across the province. Through a $10-million investment over three years, the Alberta Midwifery Strategy is helping grow the workforce, improve integration within the health system, and ensure more families can access care closer to home.\nAs a result, the number of practicing midwives in Alberta has grown by 25 per cent since 2021, helping ensure families continue to receive timely, high-quality care. The strategy also supports training, research, and innovative approaches to care. By investing in health care professionals and practical solutions that work for communities of all sizes, United Conservatives are helping ensure Alberta families have the support they need, when and where they need it.\nBy keeping life affordable, cutting red tape, and investing in services that support families, United Conservatives are ensuring Alberta stays the best place to live, work, and raise a family\n–MLA Jackie Lovely can be contacted at her constituency office located at #104, 4870 51 Street, Camrose AB, T4V 1S1, or by telephone at 780-672-0000.",
