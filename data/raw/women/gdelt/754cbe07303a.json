  "body_text": "—NET Rankings Update (men’s): No. 25.\nThursday afternoon Cardinal news and notes\nBen Mugavin and Henry Chessler are the among the kids who have caught Cardinal fever thanks to the 2024-25 team.\n—NET Rankings Update (women’s): No. 41.\n—The Courier Journal’s Brooks Holton has a deep dive on Pat Kelsey’s prowess coming out of timeouts.\nThat said, U of L produced 53 points by scoring on half (22 for 44) of its ATO opportunities in January. It had two games, the win at Pitt (4 for 7) and Tuesday’s victory over Wake Forest (5 for 8), in which it broke double digits after timeouts; scoring 10 and 13 points, respectively. And only four of its possessions ended in turnovers.\n“Out of timeouts and special situations, we work on that all the time,” Kelsey said after the aforementioned win at Virginia, during which his team went 3 for 4 on ATO execution. “The opportunities don’t present themselves every game to use a lot of the things you work on, but, every day, you’re continuing to put deposits into that area so that, when we need them, we can bring them out of the mothball, so to speak.”\nSmith accounted for 20 of Louisville’s points after timeouts over the past month. He hit six of his Division I-leading 82 3s on 11 attempts during these sequences. J’Vonne Hadley came in second with 11 points, followed by Hepburn with nine and Terrence Edwards Jr. with seven. Scott, Khani Rooths and Aboubacar Traore also chipped in two points apiece.\nAs of Wednesday, the Cards ranked 22nd nationally on KenPom.com in adjusted offensive efficiency (118.9).\nThis season has been the best I’ve ever seen a Louisville team consistently execute in ATO situations.\n—Federal prosecutors are investigating whether Terry Rozier manipulated his performance in 2023 as part of an illegal sports betting scheme.

Louisville is on the list.\nRecord: 15-5 (8-1 ACC)\nKey wins: vs. West Virginia (Nov. 28); vs. North Carolina (Jan. 1); vs. Clemson (Jan. 7); at Pitt (Jan. 11)\nPreseason ranking: No. 9 in the ACC\nLatest AP poll ranking: No. 21\nThe case for Louisville\nPat Kelsey took over an intimidating situation when he left Charleston for Louisville last spring. The Cardinals had won a total of 12 combined games over the past two seasons, finishing last in the ACC in both years under Kenny Payne.\nKelsey didn’t have a single scholarship player return from last season. And unsurprisingly, there were rough spots early in this campaign. The Cardinals were 6-5 through 11 games, getting blown out by Ole Miss and Tennessee. But since losing to Kentucky on Dec. 14, they’re unbeaten with wins over Clemson, Pitt, North Carolina, SMU and Wake Forest — their competition for second in the league. And eight of their nine ACC wins have come by double figures.\n“They’re the real deal,” one ACC coach said. “Nobody wants to go through injury, but sometimes it can set your lineup. You’re not playing too many guys. They’ve been down [Kasean] Pryor and [Noah] Waterman and I still feel like they’ve been in a really good rhythm.”\nWhile James Madison transfer Terrence Edwards Jr. (13.5 PPG) received more hype last spring when he committed to Louisville — and he has been very good — the backcourt duo of Chucky Hepburn and Reyne Smith has sparked the 10-game winning streak.\nHepburn (15.0 PPG) has been one of the best transfers in the country after spending three seasons at Wisconsin. He leads the team in scoring and is 13th nationally in assists (6.4 APG). He scored 32 points against West Virginia and 26 each against Kentucky and North Carolina. Hepburn also dished out 16 assists in last week’s win over SMU.\n“Chucky Hepburn is a menace on the ball,” one opposing coach said. “He makes them go. He can score 30-plus points, he can be the best player on both ends of the floor. He’s very disruptive defensively. He can dominate both ends. He’s very efficient, he gets to his spots, he’s physical.”\nSmith (14.5 PPG), who came over with Kelsey from Charleston, is having the best season of his career despite coming off the bench for the majority of it. He moved back into the starting lineup five games ago and is averaging 20.0 points and shooting 50% from 3-point range over that stretch. He had 30 points and 10 3-pointers in the win over SMU.\nReyne Smith is second in scoring for Louisville.

Their backcourt is really good, and as a team, they’re very selfless. Guys know what their strength is, and when Smith is on, they’re really tough.”\nLouisville’s defense has settled down since getting blitzed early by Kentucky, Ole Miss and others. The Cardinals allowed at least 1.06 points per possession in seven straight games between Nov. 29 and Dec. 28 but have allowed only two opponents to hit that mark since then.\n“They guarded the hell out of us,” one opposing coach said. “He’s got those guys bought in. Those guys are all playing hard, they’re all playing for another.”\nThe case against Louisville\nJust about everything that could go wrong from a personnel perspective already has — the Cardinals have had a litany of injury issues: Pryor tore his ACL in the Battle 4 Atlantis title game and is out for the season. Washington transfer Koren Johnson underwent shoulder injury in early December and is out for the season. Aboubacar Traore missed 10 games with a broken arm before returning to play a reserve role, while Noah Waterman has missed the past three games with a thumb injury.\nWith two players redshirting in addition to those injuries, Kelsey has been forced to use a short bench.\n“They don’t have great depth,” one coach said. “They’re an injury away or foul trouble away, especially without Pryor and Waterman. He’s using seven guys.”\nAlong with the depth issue, the absences of Pryor and Waterman mean Louisville has just one player taller than 6-foot-8 in its primary seven-man rotation. The Cardinals also don’t get a ton of easy baskets, averaging only 6.2 fast-break points (No. 326 nationally) and 31.5 paint points (No. 182).\n“The center position could be a concern. Just someone who can really get them an easier basket,” one ACC coach said. “James Scott is good, but when they run up on someone who can tighten the screws on Smith and Hepburn, who will step up?”\nWhen we’ll know if Louisville is for real (or not)\nLouisville seems to have established itself as the second-best team in the ACC and its schedule gets much easier over the second half of the league campaign.\nThe Cardinals are likely to be favored in every game for the rest of the regular season, with a home date against Pitt representing the toughest remaining test. Four of their next five matchups are on the road, which is never easy in conference play.\n—Rick Pitino put out a video Thursday morning imploring Kentucky fans not to boo John Calipari on Saturday.\n—The CJ has a profile of new Louisville volleyball coach Dan Meske, who has been the associate head coach at U of L for the last eight years.\n—Matt Norlander’s Court Report feature for CBS leads off with Louisville talk.\nKelsey had done roster makeovers before, but not anything like Louisville. Taking pieces at Winthrop and Charleston and remolding those rosters into teams that were winning 25-plus games was a different setup than trying to lift Louisville back into respectability, let alone relevance. He turned his spacious office into a bedroom and slept there almost every night for three months while building out his team with his staff.\n“We didn’t bend on the guys we wanted or the things we valued,” Kelsey said. “Toughness, competitive, basketball IQ, are they phenomenal teammates that make people around them better?”\nHe expected to win a lot right away. Some doubted the hire; he wasn’t Louisville’s first, second, third or fourth choice. Ask around college basketball and a lot of people will tell you: Kelsey’s wired differently than most. To some, he’s an odd bird. Right now, he’s the right bird for the Red Birds.\nIn a crowded race for national coach of the year — a race that no doubt also includes Kentucky’s Mark Pope, who guided his shorthanded team to a road win at No. 8 Tennessee on Tuesday night — Kelsey is also a strong candidate. It’s not just the 16-5 record and immediate top-three status in the ACC. Louisville (which has played a weaker ACC schedule) also has seven wins away from home. Depth was a huge attribute in the spring, but injuries have ravaged this team. Kasean Pryor and Koren Johnson are out for the season, having not played since November. Aboubacar Traore missed 10 games in November and December because of a broken arm.\n“We were reeling,” Kelsey said. “Trying to find ourselves. Who are we now?”\nNoah Waterman’s sat the past three games because of a thumb issue. Two would-be minutes-getters, Kobe Rogers and Ali Khalifa, are redshirting. If anything, Kelsey downplayed just how much his roster has been impacted.\n“Fellas, half the world could care less about your problems and the other half are glad you have them,” he’s told his team.\nNo one’s done more with less at the high-major level.\n—ESPN has picked up its option on the ACC TV deal through the year 2036. Additionally the league is working toward a new revenue distribution model to reward the league’s biggest brands.\n—Eric Crawford pens an appreciation for the job Dani Busboom Kelly did at Louisville.\n—I wish we played every night.\n—ESPN ranked Ja’Corey Brooks as the 96th-best player in college football last season.\n—Reyne Smith is the guest on the latest episode of C.L. Brown’s podcast. You can listen to it here.\n—CBS ranks Chucky Hepburn as the third-best transfer in college basketball this season.\n3. Chucky Hepburn, Louisville\nOld school: Wisconsin\nSometimes a change of system can do wonders for a player. Such is the reality for Hepburn, who is averaging career bests in points (15.1), assists (6.4) and steals (2.5) while keying Louisville’s Year 1 resurgence under Pat Kelsey. During his three seasons at Wisconsin, the Badgers typically played at a slow-ish pace and didn’t always take a ton of 3-pointers. Now, in Kelsey’s free-flowing system, Hepburn is not only scoring for himself but creating for others at an impressive clip. He leads the ACC in assists and steals and has the Cardinals surging toward their first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2019.\nA reminder that 247 Sports had Hepburn as the 101st-best player in the portal during the offseason.\n—There are pregame and postgame events for Louisville fans/alums who are making the trip to Atlanta for Saturday’s game against Georgia Tech.\nMore details about the Saturday night event can be found here.\n—The Houston Texans are another team that has Quincy Riley on their radar.\n—Louisville lost a great fan unexpectedly last weekend. RIP to Dave Quinlan, who attended and tailgated for every U of L home game over the past 15 years.\nDave is on the far right here:\nOur thoughts and prayers go out to Dave’s family and all who are mourning his loss.\n—Louisville’s win streak is at 10, but Rick Bozich notes that really good things happen to Cardinal teams that are able to win 11 straight.\n—Matt McGavic of Louisville Report takes a closer look at new Cardinal quarterback commit Briggs Cherry.\n—Pat. Kelsey.\n—Jeff Lightsy Jr. has a new interview with Louisville hoops signee Mikel Brown Jr. that you can check out here.\n—The Mike Rutherford Show is back this afternoon from 3-6 on 1450/96.1 The Big X.\n—And finally, beat SMU.",
