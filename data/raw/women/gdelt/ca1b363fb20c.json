  "body_text": "TUCSON, Ariz. — If she’s being honest, Adia Barnes’ first instinct was to deny it, to tell a bit of a white lie. Say: No, you didn’t actually see what you thought you saw. You misinterpreted. I definitely didn’t flip the bird while saying, “F— everybody,” on national TV.\nBut then friends and former teammates and coaches who had been blowing up her phone told her, no, that probably won’t work. Watch the video, Adia. You can’t really deny this one.\nAdvertisement\nSo, she did. And clear as day, from a camera angle that couldn’t have been better if it were scripted, there was the Arizona women’s basketball coach, gathering her players at midcourt after they had beaten UConn in the 2021 Final Four, revving them up, sticking her middle finger in the air and saying so clearly that even a terrible lip-reader could decipher it: “F— everybody.”\n“At first I was embarrassed,” Barnes said. “I was kind of ashamed. That wasn’t meant for anyone else.”\nBut as she watched it again and again, she moved past the finger and curse word and to what happened immediately after. How players enveloped her in a huddle, how they jumped around together and came in tightly as one. The elation, the emotion, the payoff of that team’s struggles. That’s what mattered to Barnes. Not the image that was being shared around social media but what came next. That’s how she knew she didn’t need to apologize for anything.\n“I was with my team,” she said. “No one believed in us, but we believed in each other.”\nAdia Barnes on a morning press conference and is asked about the TV clip showing her animated postgame speech to her team:\n\"I’m not apologizing for it because I don't feel that I need to apologize… I wouldn’t take it back.\" pic.twitter.com/C54yUIwqBb\n— Alec White (@Alec_White_22) April 3, 2021\nThe Wildcats had not just beaten UConn in the Final Four; they had controlled the game. At times throughout, she had turned to her husband and assistant coach, Salvo Coppa, and asked him if she had the math right. Were they really up 14 on UConn? Three years ago, her team won six games all season, and now it was up 14 on UConn? On Geno Auriemma’s team? He was the coach who had ended her college career in the 1998 NCAA Tournament, a college career that everyone had told her wouldn’t happen because she was too small and wasn’t skilled enough. But that was fine — she just went on to become an All-American. More than two decades later, Barnes gathered with her team at half court as the head coach of a program headed to the national championship, a program everyone told her not to take over. It pays terribly. They’ll never climb in the Pac-12 — don’t do it. Just wait for something better.\nAdvertisement\nBut to Barnes, there wasn’t going to be anything better. Arizona could get better. And she knew she was the coach who could do it. It had never mattered to her what other people thought as long as she thought something bigger, something better. She had always been the one who was too small, had always gone after the role that was supposedly too big.\nSo yeah, there was the middle finger and the “f— everybody,” but there was also joy and elation and success. All of that was and is Barnes, and that’s why she wasn’t going to apologize for any of it.\nAt this point, Barnes has lost track of how many people told her not to pick Arizona.\nThe first flurry came in 1994 when she was a high school senior. The second time was in 2016 when she was a Washington assistant.\nAs a high schooler, she didn’t pick up many college offers. When an Arizona assistant came to one of her games during her senior year, the recruiter called back to Wildcats coach Joan Bonvicini at halftime. The notes? Barnes was undersized and hadn’t played on a good travel team, and her best offer was from Division II Cal Poly Pomona. The assistant wasn’t positive she’d transition well to the next level but was certain Bonvicini would like her. “She was one mean sucker,” Bonvicini said. “She was the kind of player that other teams hated playing against because she didn’t back down from anybody.”\nBonvicini wanted her. Within days, Barnes had her first major offer.\nOpposing coaches whispered — Barnes was too small to play in the Pac-10. Her high school coach told her to pick any of her mid-major offers over Arizona. In the Pac-10, he told her, she was going to be a little fish in a big pond. Wouldn’t she rather be a big fish in a small pond?\n“I still remember that analogy,” Barnes said. “And I remember thinking, ‘Well, I’m gonna go prove everybody wrong. I’m gonna go work my butt off and do my best and whatever happens, happens.’\n“Of course I was going to bet on myself.”\nAdvertisement\nAs a freshman, Barnes struggled a bit with the upgrade in competition, but during her sophomore year, she and Arizona blossomed. Barnes was named to the all-conference team and the Wildcats doubled their win total from the previous season and recorded their first 20-plus-win season in program history. During her junior season, another all-conference year, Arizona made its first trip to the NCAA Tournament. And as a senior, Barnes was named an All-American and the Pac-10 player of the year as Arizona advanced to the Sweet 16. She left as Arizona’s leader in scoring, rebounds, steals, free throws made and games started.\nShe bet on herself again two decades later when her alma mater came calling.\nAs an assistant coach, she and Washington were riding a wave of momentum to the Huskies’ first Final Four appearance. Arizona had reached out about its head-coach opening. The Wildcats had finished last or second-to-last in the conference the previous three seasons, and they were looking for a new direction. The previous season, Washington had beaten Arizona by 16 and 22 points in conference play. Barnes had always looked forward to her return trips to Tucson, but she also dreaded the realization that the Wildcats were an easy game on their tough schedule.\nBarnes was an assistant on a hot team and the program’s only All-American. For a team that didn’t present as an obvious turnaround job (and wasn’t about to open its bank account for anyone, even a famous alumnus), then-athletic director Greg Byrne knew he’d have to lean heavily on the latter.\nJust as it had been during her recruitment, the whispers started. She got calls from former coaches — including, she says, Bonvicini, Lin Dunn and Nancy Darsch — cautioning her about taking over the Wildcats.\n“Everybody told me not to take this job. Everybody told me this is career suicide,” Barnes said. “They said: This is a bad job. They don’t pay anything. They don’t invest in basketball. They never have.”\nBarnes took the job.\nAdvertisement\nIn her first year, the Wildcats won 14 games and finished ninth in the Pac-12. Publicly, she told people the program was on the upswing. In private, she knew she was working with a six-year timeline to reach the NCAA Tournament. In Year 2, the program took a step back as Barnes began reloading her players into the program — Aari McDonald was sitting on the bench as a Washington transfer; Sam Thomas was a freshman whom Barnes needed to console throughout the season because they lost so much.\nIn Year 4, as the team came together, Tucson started backing the team. In Barnes’ first season, the Wildcats hadn’t ranked in the top 50 in national attendance, but behind an exciting, defensive-minded team that upset ranked Arizona State, UCLA and Stanford on its home court, Arizona averaged nearly 6,000 fans, the 12th most nationally. Had there been an NCAA Tournament that year, the Wildcats would’ve been in — two years before Barnes’ planned timeline.\nIn Year 5, Arizona made it to the national title game. And in Year 6 — last season — adjusting to a post-McDonald world, the Wildcats didn’t make as deep of a run but still turned out nearly 8,000 fans a game, the sixth most of any team in the country. From the sideline and in the broadcast booth, Bonvicini watched as her protege built and continues to build the program even further than she did, past the concerns that even Bonvicini once had.\n“She’s the kind of person that you never want to question or doubt,” Bonvicini said. “She has a great belief in herself and what she’s capable of doing. … She had a vision of where Arizona could be and should be.”\nBarnes couldn’t have been home more than 24 hours after losing in the national championship game to Stanford before she looked at Coppa and said, “How do we go back?”\nThere was no relishing in the moment, no basking in the light of an almost title. Yes, she was proud of what her team accomplished. In her fifth year at Arizona, she pulled the Wildcats out of the cellar and put them on a national stage.\nBut opposite her on that stage was Tara VanDerveer and Stanford. And Barnes knew VanDerveer, in the legendary coach’s fifth season at Stanford, had won the Cardinal their first national title. She followed that up with a national championship two years later and three Final Four trips in the next six years. How, she asked Coppa, does she get there?\nAdvertisement\n“I’m not coaching to be middle of the pack. That’s not what I want,” Barnes said. “Tara has done this for so many years — I want to build a program like that. I want to do what Dawn (Staley) did. I want to do what Muffet (McGraw) did. I want to do what Geno did.”\nAll of those coaches built and sustained programs. Barnes, in her seventh season as a head coach — already with three NCAA Tournament appearances to her name — is on the same timeline as those coaches. But she still studies what they do and picks their brains when she can.\nLast season when Arizona beat then-No. 6 Louisville in the second game of the season, Barnes felt as though she had cracked a code. On paper, she believed her team was better in almost every category than her team that had gone to the national title game. The Wildcats reeled off eight wins but stumbled in conference play and bowed out in the second round of the tournament. When the season closed, she tried to figure out what she could’ve done to build better chemistry.\nThis season, she built a team with talented players and a shorter bench, believing that might ease some of the issues she faced last season. But her aggressive, trapping defense, one that has drawn the ire of coaches across the country and for which Arizona has become known, didn’t take as well. Early this season, she changed things up to better fit her personnel. Sometimes the Wildcats had to win in different ways, but that fighting mentality seemed to persist — they picked up come-from-behind overtime wins on the road against UCLA and USC late in the Pac-12 season and grinded it out against Utah and Colorado.\nThe Wildcats earned a No. 7 seed in the NCAA Tournament and will face West Virginia on Friday. Barnes loves that Arizona wasn’t a bubble team, and she knows that, on her original timeline, any NCAA Tournament in Year 7 would’ve felt like success. But she also loves that this doesn’t feel like success now. She and her team have pushed the bar higher. She and the Wildcats are not just happy to be here anymore.\n“I’m at, like, a point where things are good. But how do I figure out a way to make them really good? And then great?” Barnes said. “I’m in that process of building it. We’re at this point where I’m like, how can I get us to take one step up and then continue to climb and … then sustain that — sustain in the top 10. I want a program that’s going to consistently go to Elite Eights, Sweet 16s, Final Fours and is gonna make runs and have a chance to win a championship. I want to win a championship.”\nThere was a practice early in Barnes’ freshman season at Arizona when she arrived late. She either got lost on campus or held up in a class — the reason doesn’t (and didn’t) matter. But when she entered the gym, Bonvicini told Barnes that instead of practice that day, she’d be running the stairs at the football stadium.\nAdvertisement\nNot long after, exhausted from weeks of practice, Barnes accidentally set her alarm for 7 p.m. instead of 7 a.m. the night before practice. She woke up 45 minutes into the Wildcats’ practice session. She sprinted over to McKale and was an hour late.\nBonvicini was beside herself. She stopped practice and told Barnes she knew she could be a vital part of the program, but she needed more. Running wasn’t going to solve anything. “Running didn’t faze her one bit,” Bonvicini said. “She could run forever.” So, Bonvicini decided to sit Barnes on the sideline as she lined up the team on the baseline. They ran and ran and ran.\n“She was crying tears, begging me to stop,” Bonvicini said.\nShe didn’t.\nThis might be Barnes’ most painful memory from Arizona.\nBonvicini saw it as a breakthrough. No one was thrilled with Barnes, but everyone — in a mildly twisted way — realized how much Barnes cared about her teammates, how it mattered to her more what happened to them than what happened to her. Barnes was never late again.\nBonvicini sees a similarity in how Barnes has built Arizona — how she has tried to find the perfect players and right personnel to build her tight circle, to find the people for whom she would run and for whom she would do anything to avoid that fate for them.\nOn the recruiting trail and in the gym, it has served her well. Player after player talks about her authenticity. It’s why Thomas — with just a few weeks off from her overseas team in Italy — decided to spend part of her break in Tucson instead of going home to Las Vegas. It’s why McDonald, who joked to everyone that she was never coming back to Tucson because she had spent plenty of time there, instantly accepted a role on Barnes’ staff this offseason. (“OK, so I missed Tucson. I wanted to come back and help Adia,” McDonald said.)\nAdvertisement\n“She seemed so different from some of the coaches I talked to,” Cate Reese said about her own recruitment. “She felt more real. She was who she was; she wasn’t trying to be anyone else.”\nThat’s exactly what Barnes has been for these players and this program — the player who was too small; the coach who dreamed too big; the person who took Arizona from an afterthought to a program that churns out top-10 attendance; the middle finger and coach surrounded by her adoring team.\nShe knows there are skeptics who think she and Arizona won’t ever get back to the championship game, and frankly, she welcomes the doubt. She doesn’t care if those whispers get louder. It’s all she has ever known. So go ahead and pick against the Wildcats, she says, and join the long list of folks she has proven wrong.\n(Illustration: John Bradford / The Athletic; photo: Sam Wasson / Getty Images)",
