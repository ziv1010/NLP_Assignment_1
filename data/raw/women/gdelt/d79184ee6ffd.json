Then you are down very quickly.\n‘We conceded three goals within half an hour which is not good enough. We played a better second half but overall it was not good enough.\n‘We expected this and planned for this and knew it was going to be a different game [from the 5-0 home win over Belgium on Friday night].\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

We’ll be out of things if we defend like that.’\nAgyemang, meanwhile, was left delighted following her debut goal for England, finding the back of the net just 41 seconds after she was introduced.\nThe 19-year-old, who earned her first senior England call-up this month to replace the injured Alessia Russo in the squad, came on for Jessica Park in the 80th minute.\n‘It means a lot to me,’ Agyemang said. ‘I’m really grateful for the opportunity for my debut and to come and score my first goal.\n‘Unlucky with the result but I think the team put a lot of effort in and on another day, that’s three points.\nMore Trending\n‘It was a great ball from Leah [Williamson] and as soon as I touched it, I just thought, ‘Hit it’ – I’m really grateful and really proud of myself.\n‘I think there’s a lot more [to come from me].
