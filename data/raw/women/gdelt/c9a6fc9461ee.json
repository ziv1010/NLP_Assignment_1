  "body_text": "A new twinning partnership between Wrexham AFC in Wales and Kick4Life FC in Lesotho will ‘seek to foster international cooperation and exchange between two community- focused football clubs in Europe and Africa’.\nWrexham and Kick4Life say they are aiming to work together to strengthen their community impact, with coaching exchanges, jointly promoting women’s football, and co-development and delivery of a new ‘Football for Good’ curriculum covering health, education, social inclusion and employability. Over the next three years, the partnership will reach 3,000 vulnerable children and young people across both communities.\nThe club twinning builds on a national twinning between Wales and Lesotho in Southern Africa, which was born at a meeting in Wrexham in 1984, based on similarities between the two nations related to size, landscape, population, bilingualism and cultural heritage.\nThe ‘Wales-Lesotho Link’ has since seen various collaborative projects, including educational and creative exchanges, bringing benefits for people in both nations, promoting cultural awareness and understanding, and facilitating a two-way flow of ideas and knowledge.\nHumphrey Ker, Executive Director of Wrexham AFC, said: “The link between Wales and Lesotho, signed in Wrexham meant that when this opportunity was conceived, we had to take advantage of it. We have an overarching goal of connecting the Wrexham community to the World and this is the first step on that journey. I am excited to be attending the launch event and representing the Club.”\nKick4Life Co-founder, Steve Fleming, said: “This is a truly unique partnership between two football clubs with a shared ambition to have a positive social impact in their communities. There is so much we can learn from each other and we look forward to demonstrating how two football clubs, in very different parts of the world, can work together to change lives.”\nKick4Life’s Country Director, Motlatsi Nkhahle, added: ” We are two clubs with very different histories, and separated by nearly 6,000 miles, but united by a common commitment to, and connection with, their local communities. Anyone who has watched the documentary series, will know the enormous importance of the club to the people of Wrexham. And those who are familiar with our work at Kick4Life will be aware of our club’s dedication to achieving social change here in the Mountain Kingdom.”\nThe partnership is being supported by the British High Commission to the Kingdom of Lesotho, with the High Commissioner, Harry MacDonald, stating: “Kick4Life has achieved tremendous things on the pitch and more importantly off it to change lives of young people in Lesotho. The partnership with Wrexham AFC brings one of the most exciting football clubs in the world alongside Kick4Life and means more young people than ever in Lesotho will develop life skills and football opportunities. Wrexham AFC are expanding the proud traditions of Wales and its friendships here in the Mountain Kingdom.”\nFleming added: “Wrexham AFC have secured the seed funding for the partnership via one of their sponsors and we are now seeking additional partners to come on board to help us reach more underprivileged people through the power of football. The contexts are very different, but across topics such as gender, social inclusion and employability, football offers huge potential to make a difference in both Lesotho and Wales, and we look forward to raising awareness of the positive impact of the game.”\nAs part of the partnership, Kick4Life will also oversee the Lesotho Wrexham Supporters Club which will be launched at a screening of Football League Two match Wrexham v Harrogate at Kick4Life’s No.7 Restaurant in Lesotho later today.\nKick4Life is a charity and football club based in Lesotho which delivers a range of football- based programmes for vulnerable children & young people covering health, education, life-skills, gender and employability. The organisation has also pioneered a number of hospitality social enterprises, including No.7 Restaurant and Hokahanya Inn, which support the sustainability of their charitable activities, as well as providing training and employment opportunities for young people.\nKick4Life women’s team currently play in the Lesotho Women’s Super League (becoming national champions in 2021), and the men’s team play in the Lesotho A Division.\nAdd Wrexham.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our trusted coverage when you search.",
