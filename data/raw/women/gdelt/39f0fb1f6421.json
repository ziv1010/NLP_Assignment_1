  "body_text": "Every International Women’s Day, we celebrate and admire the amazing women in our lives, be that mothers, sisters, daughters or friends.\nThe annual event, on March 8, allows us to reflect on the inspirational and incredible women in our lives.\nIt is also a day to acknowledge some of the finest women East Lancashire has produced, and the contribution they have made to not only putting our area on the map, but improving people's lives and having a positive impact on society.\nWe have compiled a list of five of East Lancashire's most inspiration women, who are role models for young women and girls across the region.\n5 inspirational East Lancs women this International Women's Day\nBarbara Castle\nWho else to start with but Barbara Castle, the MP for Blackburn from 1945 to 1976 and one of the most prominent Labour politicians of her time.\nThroughout her career, in a privileged, male-dominated arena she held various cabinet positions including Health Secretary, Minister of Transport and Minister for Overseas Development.\nOne of her most notable achievements came in 1968 when she intervened on behalf of female sewing machinists on strike at the Ford Motor plant, who had protested about unfair pay.\nAs a result of this, she successfully brought in the Equal Pay Act of 1970, which was a huge breakthrough for working women who were trying to earn a fair wage and living.\nAfter leaving the House of Commons she became a member of the European Parliament, and in 1990 was handed a peerage as Baroness Castle of Blackburn.\nShe was admired for her hard work, determination and tenacity, standing up for people and particularly women’s rights.\nWhen she died in 2002, aged 91, she was described as “one of the most remarkable women politicians of the last century,\" and is immortalised in Blackburn with her statue outside Blackburn Cathedral, and Barbara Castle Way is named in her honour.\nMartha Jane Bury\nA truly admirable figure from Blackburn, Martha Jane Bury was a profound suffragist and working-class activist.\nShe experienced times of hardship, but despite this she continued to work to lift up other women and help them to thrive.\nBorn in 1850, she was aged just two when her father died, which put her family into extreme deprivation, with her mother working as a draper and taking in lodgers to get by.\nAs a girl of only 11, she worked in the cotton mills in the Blackburn with Darwen area, enduring often dangerous work, picking up cotton from underneath the lethal machinery, a job that often led to the deaths of many children.\nShe was determined to escape from the cotton mills and attended night school, which drastically improved her quality of education.\nWhen she married in 1882, her experiences as a child had shaped her into a strong-willed and courageous woman who had risen from living in poverty to middle-class status.\nHowever, she never forgot her roots and devoted herself to the “Co-operative society”, which she became president of, and under her leadership, the Darwen Society became the largest “Cooperative” group in the UK.\nAfter her death, a statue named the “White Lady” was erected in Darwen Cemetery in memory of her and her remarkable legacy.\nJulie Hesmondhalgh\nActor Julie is best known for her role as Hayley Cropper in Coronation Street, playing the role from 1998 to 2014.\nShe wom “Best Serial Drama Performance” for her portrayal at the 2014 National Television Awards and “Best Actress” at the 2014 British Soap Awards.\nShe is also known for roles in Happy Valley, Mr Bates vs The Post Office, and Broadchurch.\nBorn in Accrington, she had a passion for amateur dramatics from a young age and applied to drama school at the age of 18.\nAside from acting, Hesmondhalgh has always been someone who has a deep sense of care towards the public and her community.\nShe has worked closely with the Sophie Lancaster Foundation, where she led a creative writing competition across schools in the Northwest in 2011.\nMore recently, in 2019, she set up a group named 500 Acts of Kindness which is a fundraising community where 500 people donate a pound each week to give to an individual, group, family or organisation that is in need of support.\nLisa Goodwin-Allen\nLisa is best known for being an executive chef at the Michelin-star Northcote restaurant, based in Langho.\nBefore rising to stardom and becoming an award-winning chef on the BBC cooking show “Great British Menu”, she began her culinary career by working at Holbeck Gyll in Windermere.\nShe worked there on a part-time basis while completing a National Vocational Qualification in catering.\nShe then moved on to working at the Le Champignon Sauvage in Cheltenham.\nFollowing this, she returned to the Northwest where she found a role as a chef at Northcote and rose through the ranks to eventually become “head chef” after being both a “chef de partie” and a “sous chef”.\nThen, in 2004, she was named head of the restaurant and placed in charge of the kitchen at just 23 years old.\nSuccess didn’t just end there for Julie, as she even ended up becoming one of the four chefs to cook a banquet that was hosted by none other than King Charles.\nUnder her leadership, Northcote has become a culinary destination in England and the kitchen has produced a number of top chefs who have learned from her expertise.\nIn an industry dominated by men, Lisa Goodwin-Allen has shown gender has no impact on culinary skill and creativity by becoming one of the top chefs of her generation.\nKeira Walsh\nKeira Walsh is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Chelsea and England.\nA Haslingden High School and Bacup and Rawtenstall Grammar School sixth form student, Keira took up the sport playing for local junior clubs as a girl.\nHer talent was spotted by Blackburn Rovers, where she came through the ranks before being snapped up by Manchester City as a teenager.\nAfter eight years at City, she signed for European giants Barcelona in a world record transfer for a female player, spending three years on the Catalan coast before her move to Chelsea in what was again one of the highest ever transfer fees for a female.\nShe made her England debut at 20 years old and captained the Lionesses for the first time aged 21.\nShe was a key player in England's 2022 Women's Euros victory, winning player of the match in the final as the Lionesses won England's first major silverware since 1966.\nWalsh is recognised as one of the best players in the women's game.\nAside from football, Walsh is a strong advocate for mental health support and breaking the stigma surrounding getting and accessing help.\nShe also encourages young girls and women to get into sport, hoping her success can inspire others to follow in her footsteps.\nHave we missed anyone?
