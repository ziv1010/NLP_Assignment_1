  "body_text": "Raw airs tonight (Feb. 3) with a live show from Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse in Cleveland, Ohio. This is the first episode of Raw during the four week build towards Elimination Chamber 2025, which takes place on March 1.\nWWE Raw preview (Feb. 3, 2025): Let’s see who gets to lose against John Cena at Elimination Chamber\nLet’s see who gets to lose against John Cena at Elimination Chamber\nJohn Cena was the runner up in the men’s Royal Rumble match, but that’s not the only way to challenge for a world title at WrestleMania. Shortly after the show was over, John announced his automatic entry into next month’s Elimination Chamber match. Cena vows to win the chamber match and go on to win the 17th world championship of his career at WrestleMania 41, because that’s what is best for business.\nSo, which wrestlers get the honor of losing against John at Elimination Chamber? That question will begin to be answered tonight as qualifying matches take place. General Manager Adam Pearce has yet to announce who is competing in these matches, so we’ll have to use our imagination for now.\nOne name that comes to mind right away is CM Punk, who is probably also trying to figure out if there is another way to land a WrestleMania main event after losing the Royal Rumble. One issue here is that CM has only competed once on Raw since returning to WWE over a year ago. Can he pull some strings backstage to get to use Cena’s automatic entry clause as well, or will he have to lace up his boots if he wants to keep his WrestleMania dream alive? For what it’s worth, Cleveland is the city that Punk walked out of WWE Raw from in 2014 following that year’s Rumble, so I’m curious to see if anybody brings that up tonight.\nOther Raw contenders for these chamber spots might include Logan Paul, Seth Rollins, Sami Zayn, Bron Breakker, Sheamus, Rey Mysterio, Penta, Finn Balor, Dominik Mysterio, Kofi Kingston, and Karrion Kross.\nThere’s also Drew McIntyre, of course, assuming he isn’t going to storm out of the building again. I think he is still officially on the Raw roster, but who knows, maybe he was quietly moved over to SmackDown over the weekend.\nThere are plenty of wrestlers on the SmackDown brand who belong in chamber qualifying matches, but I assume they won’t be around tonight since WWE says the transfer window is closed.\nRoman Reigns is another star who I’d expect to be in the mix for a world title shot at WrestleMania and would want to be in the chamber, but he also rarely ever wrestles outside of PLEs, so I don’t expect to see him in a qualifying match tonight. Perhaps the rules are different now that Raw is on Netflix.\nWhich of these men will duke it out on Raw tonight in order to earn their way into a future loss against John Cena at Elimination Chamber? Make sure to tune into Raw to find out.\nThe rest of the card\nThe only other thing WWE has announced for Raw is that Royal Rumble winners Charlotte Flair and Jey Uso will make an appearance. There’s isn’t a hard rule that says they already have to announce which championship they will pursue at WrestleMania, but maybe one of them is ready to let us know.\nWill Women’s World Champion Rhea Ripley, WWE Women’s Champion Tiffany Stratton, World Heavyweight Champion GUNTHER, or Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes be in the house to confront the Rumble winners? Will Flair at least make it clear that she won’t be challenging for the NXT championship at WrestleMania like she did the last time she won the Royal Rumble in 2020?\nOther stuff to keep an eye on\n- Alexa Bliss returned to WWE at Royal Rumble and it sounds like she will be on the Raw roster. Will Bliss get some mic time tonight to give us an idea of what’s changed since the last time we saw her in 2023?\n- Nikki Bella also returned at Royal Rumble, where she eliminated Bayley from the match. Is Bella planning to stick around on the road to WrestleMania?\n- Becky Lynch did not return to WWE at Royal Rumble. I reckon this was a smart decision since she would have been just another elimination in Charlotte Flair’s victory. Is The Man ready to return as soon as tonight?\n- What does CM Punk have to say after being eliminated by Logan Paul at the Royal Rumble? Will he focus his attention on the YouTube douchebag, or he is more interested in punching Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns in the face?\n- Will WWE dare give a live mic to Drew McIntyre tonight following reports that he stormed out of the building at Royal Rumble after being legitimately upset with someone in the match who screwed up his elimination spot?\n- The New Day haven’t had any success in singles matches since kicking Big E to the curb. They should probably change course and go after World Tag Team Champions The War Raiders, no?\n- Will there be a women’s Elimination Chamber match as well? If so, I’d expect to hear Liv Morgan and IYO SKY announce that they want in.\n- Chad Gable is trying to master the dark arts of lucha libre. Will we find out the identity of Dominik Mysterio’s mystery man who is training him?\n- Finn Balor eliminated Penta from the Royal Rumble match. Does that mean a singles match is coming soon between these two stars?\n- Women’s Intercontinental Champion Lyra Valkyria was dumped out of the Royal Rumble by Ivy Nile, presumably setting up a future title match. Will we get a date for that match during tonight’s broadcast?\n- Austin Theory and Grayson Waller are now on the Raw roster, but neither one made the cut for the men’s Royal Rumble match. Will Theory argue that he should be in the Elimination Chamber match because he has a WrestleMania win over John Cena?\n- As I touched on earlier, could there be any secret transfer window moves from over the weekend that WWE will announce tonight? For example, it appears that Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens should be on the same brand to continue their story on the road to WrestleMania, but Zayn is still on Raw and KO is still on SmackDown, as far as I am aware. Maybe WWE will announce that even though the transfer window is closed, the wrestlers can come and go as they please until WrestleMania 41.\n- Speaking of Sami, how does he feel about Jey Uso eliminating him from the Royal Rumble match?\n- WWE is celebrating 25 years of Stratusfaction, and Elimination Chamber happens to take place in Trish’s hometown of Toronto. Does Trish Stratus plan to step back in the ring at that event following her return at Royal Rumble? She may have unfinished business with SmackDown star Nia Jax after what happened in the Rumble.\n- Is NXT star Roxanne Perez about to be called up to the main roster after setting a new record for longest survival time ever in a women’s Royal Rumble?\n- How many times will WWE replay that clip of Intercontinental Champion Bron Breakker spearing the shit out of IShowSpeed in the Royal Rumble match?\n- Does WWE have an update on Cody Rhodes’ status after he suffered multiple injuries in his ladder match at Royal Rumble match? And shouldn’t there be even more concern for how Kevin Owens is doing?\n- Where the f*** is Omos? He wasn’t in the Royal Rumble match, maybe because it would have taken him way too long to walk to the ring inside that very large football stadium.\nWhat will you be looking for on Raw?",
