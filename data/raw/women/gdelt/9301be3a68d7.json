He's settled in really well and you can see in our goal difference where we've improved from last year and that's down to that defensive partnership.\"\nLatinovic, Clark and Humphrey have been ever-present through City's eight league and two cup games this season and, although the new arrival's settling in has been accompanied by four yellow cards, he has played a significant part in a run of three wins from the last four league games.\nSyson said his centre-backs complement each other's strengths.\n\"I think Daniel brings a little bit out of Humpa in that he tries to attack the ball a little bit more because Will's a great footballer and can play,\" he said. \"I think having someone like Daniel pushes him a bit more in that area in terms of attacking the ball.\"\nClark has had a front-row seat of the partnership and has also been impressed with how quickly Latinovic has adapted.\n\"It's been fantastic to have him,\" the keeper said.\n\"To find someone like that, that's willing to come down to Tassie and at six foot five can play and challenge as hard as anyone, it's a rare find and a great pick-up for Tasmanian football in general.\"\nDespite a 1-0 victory in their last match at Riverside, Syson described his team's performance as their worst of the season and one which would cost them heavily if repeated against ladder-leading Glenorchy on Saturday.\nSyson told his players this immediately after the match at Windsor Park but admitted: \"They already knew. They felt the anger at half-time and after the game they knew it was not up to their standards so I need to see a reaction Monday, Tuesday, Thursday going into the Knights game.\"\nThe NPL Tasmania competition is developing into a fascinating battle with the top three teams all still undefeated. However, with 10 draws between them, they are not racing away from the opposition.\nGlenorchy and South Hobart have an identical record of 5-3-0 although the Knights' goal difference is more than twice as good (+25 compared to +11).\nReigning champions Devonport (4-4-0) sit two points further back, closely followed by Kingborough (4-3-1) and City (4-1-3).\nNPL TASMANIA\nSaturday\n- 2.15pm Launceston United v Devonport, Birch Avenue\n- 2.30pm Clarence v South Hobart, Wentworth Park\n- 4.30pm Riverside Olympic v Kingborough, Windsor Park\n- 4.45pm Launceston City v Glenorchy, Prospect Park\nWOMEN'S SUPER LEAGUE\nFriday\n- 6.45pm Launceston United v Devonport, Birch Avenue\nSaturday\n- 12pm Riverside Olympic v Kingborough, Windsor Park\n- 2.30pm Taroona v South Hobart, Lightwood Park",
