  "body_text": "The Concacaf W Champions Cup 2024/25 brings a new level of competition to women's soccer in North, Central America, and the Caribbean. Among the participants, three NWSL teams are set to make history: NJ/NY Gotham FC, Portland Thorns, and San Diego Wave.\nGotham FC, the current NWSL champion, enters the competition with the best defense and a solid attack. Their participation in Group A, alongside Tigres Femenil, CF Monterrey Femenil, LD Alajuelense, and Frazsiers Whip Football Limited, promises to be challenging. Playing at home at Red Bull Arena against Monterrey and Tigres, Gotham has the opportunity to leverage their strong defensive performance to advance to the final stages.\nFollow MLS Multiplex on X (Twitter).\nOn the other hand, the Portland Thorns, known for their powerful attack, are in Group B. The Thorns are the team with the most shots in the league, with 139 shots and 78 on target. Facing opponents like Club América Femenil and Santa Fe FC, Portland needs to maintain a balance between offense and defense to advance. Their chances increase with the presence of players who have shown consistency and skill in creating scoring opportunities.\nThe San Diego Wave, also in Group B, faces a challenging journey. Currently outside the NWSL playoff zone, the Wave needs to find a better balance between attack and defense to stand out. Starting the competition against Santa Fe FC away, San Diego will need to show resilience and strategy to advance. The matches against Portland Thorns and Club América Femenil will be decisive for their aspirations in the competition.\nThe Concacaf W Champions Cup is not only an opportunity to showcase the strength of NWSL clubs but also a crucial path for qualification to the new FIFA Women's Club World Cup. With a format that includes semifinals and finals in May 2025, teams have the chance to prove themselves on an international stage.\nThese clubs represent not only the NWSL but also the competitiveness of women's soccer in the U.S. Gotham FC, Portland Thorns, and San Diego Wave navigate the challenges and seek glory in the inaugural edition of the Concacaf W Champions Cup.",
