It would mean the US men’s national team (USMNT) would again compete in the tournament.\nAdvertisement\nIt would also take place in the same summer as the Olympic Games, which will be hosted by the U.S. in Los Angeles. The Olympics are due to begin on July 14 and both Copa America and the Olympics will likely want to avoid a crossover. The Copa America final in 2024 took place on July 14.\nThe tournament was hosted by the U.S. in 2024, as part of a strategic cooperation agreement signed between the two confederations. This permitted six guest places for CONCACAF teams in the 2024 tournament, as well as all 10 CONMEBOL nations, and the tournament was jointly organized by the two confederations. The 2024 edition therefore included the USMNT, Mexico, Canada, Panama, Costa Rica and Jamaica. The only other occasion that the U.S. previously hosted Copa America was in 2016.\nShould an agreement be finalized, it would mean that the U.S. will host the tournament three times out of five between 2016 and 2028. (The 2019 and 2021 editions were hosted by Brazil — the latter tournament was scheduled to take place in 2020 but was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.)\nWhile discussions are active for the U.S. to host the event, CONMEBOL has other options in South America, including Argentina and Ecuador. Argentina had been slated to originally host the 2020 edition alongside Colombia, but a combination of pandemic challenges and social unrest led the tournament to be moved to Brazil. Ecuador were also at one time in line to host the 2024 Copa but pulled out due to concerns over costs and infrastructure.\nIn total, 1.6 million fans attended the 16-team and 32-match tournament in 2024 and the ticketing model in the U.S. netted CONMEBOL record revenues. The tournament was responsible for the bulk of $319million (£241m) worth of income for CONMEBOL alone from national team competitions in 2024.\nAdvertisement\nThe tournament was not without its challenges, however, as playing surfaces at U.S. stadiums came under fire from coaches and players. Most infamously, the kick-off for the final between Colombia and Argentina was delayed by about 80 minutes amid a dangerous situation as supporters attempted to enter the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.\nShould the tournament take place in the U.S., it will be just the latest in a string of major events involving soccer since the pandemic, with the men’s World Cup to be co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada in 2026, while the sole bidder for the 2031 Women’s World Cup is a U.S.-led bid partnered by Mexico, Jamaica and Costa Rica.\nA Copa America in 2028 would also no longer disrupt an MLS season because the league has announced that from the 2027-28 season, it will alter its calendar to more closely mirror global leagues, with the campaign ending in May.\nA CONMEBOL press officer insisted “nothing is concrete at his stage” and said his office is yet to receive information on the matter. CONCACAF have also been approached for comment. US Soccer have declined to comment.\nOn November 5, FIFA announced that the organisation would introduce a new award entitled “FIFA Peace Prize — Football Unites the World”.\nIn a statement published by the FIFA website and on President Gianni Infantino’s Instagram account, Infantino said: “In an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it’s fundamental to recognise the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace. Football stands for peace, and on behalf of the entire global football community, the FIFA Peace Prize — Football Unites the World will recognise the enormous efforts of those individuals who unite people, bringing hope for future generations.”\nAdvertisement\nFIFA said the award will be given annually, but the inaugural prize will be presented by Infantino during the World Cup draw in Washington DC on Friday, December 5. They said it will go to individuals who have “helped to unite people all over the world in peace and consequently deserve a special and unique recognition.”\nThis all came as a surprise to the FIFA Council of 37 members, which is chaired by Infantino, as well as eight vice-presidents, and 28 other members elected by the member associations. Multiple sources familiar with the process, all of whom wished to remain anonymous to protect relationships, said the Council and FIFA’s vice-presidents were not consulted or involved in the creation of a FIFA peace prize and that it was not discussed at the prior FIFA Council. They have also not had input into the selection criteria for deciding a recipient. Some found out via a media release.\nFIFA did not respond when asked to comment on this or how the creation of the award is in accordance with FIFA’s own statutes.\nThe award was announced on the same day that Infantino was due to speak at the America Business Forum in Miami, where U.S. President Donald Trump also spoke. During his interview, Infantino was asked whether Trump, who famously missed out on this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, will be the recipient of the award amid the U.S. president’s claim to have ended eight wars since returning to office. In some of those instances, he has been praised by the warring parties, but his role is more disputed in others, while tensions and/or fighting have remained in several cases, according to analysis from the New York Times.\nInfantino said of Trump’s chances of winning the prize: “You will see.”\nBut in the same interview, Infantino said: “I have a great relationship with President Trump, where I consider him a really close friend. He has such incredible energy and this is something that I really admire.”\nHe continued: “He does things. He does what he says. He says what he thinks. He actually says what many people think as well, but maybe don’t dare to say and that’s why he’s so successful. I have to say it and I’m a bit surprised sometimes when we read some negative comments. I am not American, but as far as I understand, President Trump was elected in the United States of America and was quite clearly elected. When you are in such a great democracy as the United States of America, you should first of all respect the results of the election, right?\nAdvertisement\n“In the end, he was elected based on the programme, based on what he said. He is just implementing what he said he would do. So I think we should all support what he’s doing because I think it’s looking pretty good.”\nPresident Trump is expected to attend the World Cup draw on Friday at the Kennedy Center, the performance arts venue he now chairs after his administration oversaw a huge turnover of board members and staff at the venue to reshape the center in his image since he returned to power.\nIn August, Trump announced the event would be hosted at the Kennedy Center, saying it will give next year’s tournament a “phenomenal kick-off”, adding “we’ll be involved.”\nDuring the FIFA Club World Cup draw in December 2024, Trump sent a message via videolink ahead of his inauguration the following month, while his grandson Theo and daughter Ivanka made the ceremonial first pick of the draw. Trump then played a central part in the trophy celebrations when Chelsea won the tournament in May.\nTrump’s expected presence at the draw means equal representation is also expected from Canada and Mexico. The Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed last week that he would attend the draw in D.C., where he will joined by Secretary of State for Sport, Adam van Koeverden.\nIt will be the first time Carney has seen the U.S. President since Trump halted talks between the nations to reduce tariffs on steel, aluminium and autos after being angered by the province of Ontario publishing a commercial which included former U.S. President Ronald Reagan stating in 1987 that high tariffs lead to trade wars and millions of job losses. Earlier this year, Trump repeatedly claimed that Canada ought to be subsumed into the U.S.\nTrump has also had tension with fellow co-host Mexico, saying in November that he would not rule out strikes in Mexico targeted at drug cartels. Trump said: “Would I launch strikes in Mexico to stop drugs? OK with me. Whatever we have to do to stop drugs. Mexico is… look, I looked at Mexico City over the weekend, there’s some big problems over there.\nAdvertisement\n“We’re losing hundreds of thousands of people to drugs. So now we’ve stopped the waterways, but we know every route.\n“We know the addresses of every drug lord. We know their address. We know their front door. We know everything about every one of them. They’re killing our people. That’s like a war. Would I do it? I’d be proud to. I’d probably go into Congress and say, ‘Hey’ — and you know what? The Democrats and the Republicans would both agree, unless they’re crazy, and they are a little crazy on the Democrat side. But we have lost hundreds of thousands of people a year — death, and that’s not talking about family destruction.\n“That’s talking about death, and much of it comes through Mexico. So let me just put it this way: I am not happy with Mexico. OK? Thank you very much.”\nTrump has not yet met Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum since he returned to power. Speaking early last week, Sheinbaum said she would wait for Trump and Carney to confirm their attendance at the draw before committing to going herself. “We will see if a meeting is possible,” she told reporters, as quoted by Bloomberg.\nOne politician who will not be present is the President of reigning World Cup holders Argentina. President Javier Milei, an ally of Trump, has chosen not to attend the draw according to his cabinet chief Manuel Adorni. Milei has been locked in a feud with Argentina Football Association chief Claudio Tapia amid tensions over Milei’s desire for Argentine teams to become private sporting corporations.\nFrom world politics to football politics, one man to keep an eye on at the World Cup draw this Friday may be the UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin, who is also a FIFA vice-president.\nThe current expectation is that he is considering not attending the draw on Friday. This would follow his decision to walk out early from the FIFA Congress in Paraguay in May, along with other European members of the FIFA Council, after Infantino appeared to prioritize meetings with world leaders, including the U.S. President Trump, in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. He subsequently arrived in Asuncion so late that FIFA’s congress needed to be delayed three hours due to an issue with his flight. In a statement, UEFA admonished Infantino for disrupting the timetable “to accommodate private political interests.”\nUEFA later backtracked, insisting their relationship with FIFA is “very good”, built on “open communication and mutual respect” but Ceferin also exited the congress early in Bangkok the previous year.\nAdvertisement\nCeferin, as a confederation president and FIFA Council vice-president, is eligible to receive a net annual compensation of $300,000 from FIFA. UEFA and FIFA have previously declined to comment when asked whether he accepts this money. This week, his possible out from the FIFA event may be his own organisation’s executive committee meeting on Wednesday, although it is likely that plenty of his colleagues will jet over after the UEFA meeting to join the FIFA festivities. It remains to be seen whether Ceferin will join them.\nWhen asked to comment on Ceferin’s plans, UEFA did not respond and FIFA declined to comment.\nPolitics will also play a part in who attends — and does not attend — from a football perspective on Friday. The Iranian federation, for example, say it is currently planning to boycott the event because a visa has not been issued by the U.S. government for the federation’s President Mehdi Taj.\nIranian nationals are currently under a travel ban imposed by the Trump administration since June. Exemptions are made for the World Cup itself for athletes, support staff and immediate relatives but it is not clear if the exemption applies to the draw.\nThe Tehran Times has claimed that four visas were issued by the U.S. for its delegation — Amir Ghalenoei (head coach), Mehdi Kharati (executive director), Omid Jamali (director of international relations), and Amir Mehdi Alavi (spokesperson) — but that requests for three others, including President Mehdi Taj were reportedly denied.\nSpokesperson Alavi told the publication: “We have informed FIFA that the decisions taken are unrelated to sport and that the members of the Iranian delegation will not participate in the World Cup draw.”\nAccording to the BBC, Taj, who called on Infantino to take a stand on their behalf, told Iranian television on Thursday: “The current position of the Iran Football Federation executive committee is that no one will attend the event unless all visas are issued.”\nAdvertisement\nThe U.S. State Department said: “The United States is prepared to welcome visitors from around the globe for the largest and greatest FIFA World Cup in history. A World Cup ticket does not guarantee a U.S. visa. Ticket holders need to apply for a visa or ESTA and need to meet all eligibility requirements under U.S. law. Every application is reviewed individually based on the facts of the case.”\nThe Iranian federation and FIFA did not respond to a request for comment.",
