  "body_text": "The Lionesses' WAGs and HABs: Who are Mary Earps, Lucy Bronze and Leah Williamson dating?\nFootball is came home again this summer, thanks to the Lionesses prowess in the penalty shootouts. But who is each player coming home to after the tournament?\nThe latest update to the team’s behind-the-scenes romance comes courtesy of Mary Earps, who recently revealed she is in a relationship with a woman named Kitty — partly thanks to the encouragement of her former teammates. The former Lioness goalkeeper retired from international football just ahead of the 2025 competition.\nTo make matters more juicy, Lioness WAGs can often be found on the pitch as well as off. Unlike the rather-less-less-victorious men’s team, where nobody is openly dating their teammates or someone on a rival team (the drama!).\nWelcome to the wonderful world of women’s football, where every player is likely someone’s ex. There’s even the WoSo Chart, a fan-made comprehensive mapping of all the confirmed and rumoured connections between the professional women’s players.\nNot every player is queer (alas), so there are some token straight male WAGs in the stands for diversity’s sake. Here’s the Euro England Squad 2025 — and the people they’re confirmed or rumoured to be currently smooching.\nLucy Bronze and Ona Batlle\nStatus: “Besties”\nAs the rest of the England team celebrated their Euros win, defender Lucy Bronze was sharing a tender moment with Ona Batlle, the Spanish full-back. At one point, Batlle even tenderly stroked Bronze’s cheek. These two have form: back in 2023, it was Batlle comforting Bronze after Spain beat England in the World Cup final.\nWhen Bronze went down with an injury during the match (she later revealed she had played the entire tournament with a fractured tibia), Batlle was by her side to check on her and stroke her back.\nIn true Sapphic style, these two are never beating the besties allegations. They were rivals back when Bronze played for Manchester City and Batlle with Manchester Utd, then teammates when they both played for Barcelona FC.\nWhile neither has officially confirmed a romance, they’re all over each others social media feeds. The duo holidayed together to celebrate Batlle’s birthday before the Euros, and visited Disneyland Paris over the Christmas season.\nAn added layer of lesbian drama is that Bronze was previously thought to be dating England midfielder Keira Walsh, who was also her teammate at Man City and Barcelona.\nLeah Williamson and Elle Smith\nStatus: Girlfriends?\nAs England defender Leah Williamson went to celebrate with her loved ones, her “rumoured” girlfriend Elle Smith was right there in the stands. Smith has been holding up the WAGs fashion end over the tournament, wearing the must-have Connor Ives shirred football shirt as she embraced Williamson after England’s victory over Italy in the Euros.\nThe American model and former Miss USA joined Williamson on a sunny holiday in Majorca prior to the tournament, where they posted lots of pictures of each other looking impossibly gorgeous. Back in March, Smith posted a snap of them together captioned “happy birthday my love x”, which sounds pretty couple-y to us.\nWilliamson, a committed LGBTQ+ activist, had previously been romantically linked to fellow former Arsenal player Jordan Nobbs. And they were teammates.\nJess Carter and Ann-Katrin Berger\nStatus: Engaged!\nEngland defender Jess Carter is affianced to Ann-Katrin Berger, the goalkeeper for Germany’s national team. Their romance is a classic tale of queer enemies/housemates to lovers.\nCarter, who initially thought she was straight (girl, we’ve all been there), took an instant dislike to Berger when she joined Birmingham FC back in 2016. “I thought she was arrogant,” Carter told the Guardian. But when she was looking to move house and Berger was looking for a housemate, they became platonic co-habiters.\nWhen Berger realised she missed Carter while she was off training, she planned a romantic dinner date to make her move. Clueless Carter thought it was just a friendly meal, until Berger kissed her a few days later and they eventually worked it out. They announced their engagement in May 2024 with the adorable caption “7 years down forever to go”.\nNiamh Charles and Cat Macario\nStatus: Housemates...\nEngland left-back Niamh Charles’ Chelsea teammate and housemate Cat Macario was in Basel to support her. Macario was even wearing Charles’ number three shirt to cheer her on.\nCat Macario supporting England tonight, wearing Niamh Charles’ number three. 💙#WEURO2025 pic.twitter.com/9Nq6jjcVni\n— Chelsea FC Women (@ChelseaFCW) July 27, 2025\nObviously she could have just pinched it out of their laundry basket, but a shared wardrobe is on the official lesbian dating benefits list.\nCharles was previously rumoured to be involved with her former Liverpool teammate Amy Rodgers, but it looks like the field may now be clear for Macario.\nAlex Greenwood and Jack O’Connell\nStatus: Partners\nSee, men can be WAGs too. England’s top performing defender Alex Greenwood is in a relationship with Jack O’Connell, a former Premier League footballer. The Scouse couple met as sixth-formers in Liverpool and have always shared a mutual passion for the beautiful game.\nO’Connell had to retire from the sport in 2023 due to a knee injury, and he dedicated his career to Greenwood in his final speech in a great display of non-toxic masculinity. “She is a supremely talented footballer and it has been a great consolation to be able to watch her career go from strength to strength,” he said. “I am her biggest fan.\"\nLauren Hemp and Ashley Hodson\nStatus: Girlfriends\nEngland forward Lauren Hemp is dating fellow footballer Ashley Hodson. Hemp plays for Manchester City and Hodson used to play for for Sheffield FC, before she retired last year. They’ve been officially a couple since 2023, and regularly feature on each other’s Instagram posts in frankly adorable couple pictures.\nHodson has been out in Basel supporting her girlfriend and was in the stands for the Euros win on Sunday. She was also right by her girlfriend’s side when Hemp received her MBE for her achievements in women’s football.\nHemp previously dated another footballer, Ellie Butler, who played for Coventry.\nElla Toone and Joe Bunney\nStatus: Boyfriend-girlfriend\nMidfielder Ella Toone is in a relationship with Joe Bunney. Toone plays for Manchester United, and Bunney plays for Stalybridge Celtic.\nNo lesbian drama here, but Bunney is a fan of Man Utd’s rival Man City, although they’ve found a way to make it work. “That’s the only thing we don’t have in common and it is the biggest thing for us,” Bunney told the Times. “My mates always say I’m a red now, [that I’ve] been converted. I said: ‘No. I’m a Man City fan and a Man United Women fan.”\nBunney regularly makes an appearance on Toone’s Youtube channel. Another straight and male WAG maybe, but there’s definitely a pattern for the Lionesses to prefer to pick a mate who shares their love for football at least.\nBeth Mead and Vivianne Miedema\nStatus: Girlfriends (and rivals)\nEngland forward Beth Mead is in a relationship with Dutch striker Vivianne Miedema. So yes, that meant they faced off on the pitch against each other in the 2025 Euros. “Our golden rule is we don’t discuss anything. I don’t know whether she’ll be starting tomorrow,” Miedema said at a Euros press conference. “For once, we will not be friends!’\nEngland wiped the floor with the Netherlands 4-0, but Miedema stayed on in Basel and was in the stands to cheer her girlfriend on in the final.\nMead and Miedema met while they were both playing for Arsenal, although Miedema has now been signed by Man City. They co-parent their dog, Myle, who has thier own Instagram account but wisely refuses to take sides. “She's not an Arsenal fan, she's not a City fan, she just loves her mummies,” Miedema told Mail Sport.\nChloe Kelly and Scott Moore\nStatus: Married\nEngland forward Chloe Kelly, who scored the goal that cinched the win for England, is married to a man named Scott Moore. Although Moore doesn’t play, their meet-cute is football related, of course.\nKelly held the door open for Moore at the Everton grounds, where she was a player and he was a groundsman. He then slid into her DMs on Instagram and invited her on a date... to IKEA.\nThey’ve been together ever since, with Moore balancing his job as a groundskeeper for a goldcourse with cheering on his superstar wife. Moore proposed in 2023, while on holiday in Iceland, and they got married in 2024 in Cheshire.\nSarina Wiegman and Marten Glotzbach\nStatus: Married with kids\nEngland coach Sarina Wiegman, the Dutchwoman who has now taken three consecutive teams to victory at the Euros, is married to a German man named Marten Glotzbach. He also seems to be keen on the sport, as he coached college football teams when he was a professor of economics in the Netherlands.\nThe couple have two daughters, Lauren and Sacha, and the whole family relocated to the UK when Wiegman got the job coaching the Lionesses.\nSacha, 21, seems to share the family’s love of football, signing a a two-year contract with Dutch football club ADO Den Haag (where Wiegman used to coach) that ended in May.\nMary Earps and Kitty\nStatus: Girlfriends\nLegendary goalkeeper Mary Earps retired from international football prior to the 2025 Euros, but once a Lioness always a Lioness.\nShe had kept her sexuality and relationship status private, but made a revelation ahead of the publication of her new memoir, titled All In.\nEarps, who now plays for Paris Saint-Germain, said she finally “feels ready to share” how “happy” she is in a same-sex relationship with a woman named Kitty. She also credited her former Lioness teammates for encouraging to discuss her sexuality publicly.\n'I've always tried to keep my personal life separate from my professional one, but it would have felt inauthentic not to include something so important to me in this book,” the footballer told The Sun.\n“I'm in a really happy relationship. The people closest to me have always known, and I feel ready and happy to share that with everyone now.”",
