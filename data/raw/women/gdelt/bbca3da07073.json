Now, here’s Mike Sykes.\nGood morning, Winners! Welcome back to the Morning Win! Thanks so much for rocking with me today. Appreciate y'all giving us a bit of your time here.\nIs your bracket busted like mine is? Because mine is definitely busted. I haven't checked it, but I know it is because I had Kentucky riding pretty far in this one. And, well, uh, that's over. That's exactly what I get for trusting John Calipari in 2024.\nOakland's 80-76 win over Kentucky has been most people's shock of the tournament so far.\nActually, spectacular might be a better word than shocking here. The Golden Grizzlies knocked the SEC powerhouse out of the tournament behind a historic performance by Jack Gohlke, who hit 10 3-pointers while playing the game of his life. He was one 3-pointer shy of a single-game NCAA record. That's how good he was. He shot the leather off the ball.\nREAD MORE: Jack Gohlke declares Oakland isn't a \"cinderella\" after beating Kentucky\nAs much as this game profiles as an upset, though, I'm just not quite sure I feel the same way here.\nThis has become par for the course for John Calipari's teams in March. High seeds and early exists. His teams just aren't really built for March anymore. Jay Wright perfectly explained it here — having teams full of freshmen just doesn't quite work the way it did 10 years ago. Not when the transfer portal spreads experienced talent around. That's how we got here. More on Cal in a second, though.\nLet's talk about Oakland. Because, man, this win was an impressive one.\nPlus, Oakland isn't necessarily your typical 14 seed. Greg Kampe has coached the Golden Grizzlies for 40 years. He's seen it all. He knows what type of talent he has and what he needs to do to get the most out of it. No, the Golden Grizzlies hadn't won in March since 2005 before Thursday. But the team already had 13 all-time wins against Power 5 teams coming into that game. Kampe's experience there was invaluable.\nUltimately, that experience helped his team overcome a more talented side in Kentucky. All it takes is one game in March and Oakland seized it. Good on them.\nNow, they get to keep dancing.\nJohn Calipari's seat has to be scorching\nThere shouldn't be a seat in college basketball hotter than John Calipari's.\nAs I said above, failure in March has been more of a calling card for coach Cal in recent years than anything else. Sure, he'll send great players to the NBA, and his teams will rack up regular-season wins. But he'll let you down when it counts the most.\nKentucky has just one NCAA tournament win in the last four seasons. The Wildcats haven't made it beyond the round of 32 since 2019. That isn't getting the job done at Kentucky, to put it simply.\nSo, will he lose his job? Probably not. There are about 35 million reasons why, our Cory Woodroof writes.\nThat would be a lot of money to pay to a guy for failing at his job. So it sounds like Cal will be back for at least another year. Good luck, Kentucky. You seem to need it these days.\nRELATED: Kentucky's five worse losses under John Calipari\nThe NFL isn't listening to its players\nThe hip-drop tackle simply isn't that big of a deal. The players don't mind it and it doesn't lead to injury as often as you might think. So, with that in mind, when the players say there's no need to ban it, you'd think the league would listen.\nBut nope! It looks like they're moving forward with a ban anyway. Here's Robert Zeglinski on why that's so shameful.\n\"Banning the hip drop isn’t about improving player safety at all. It’s about the league finding another avenue to streamline and protect its financial investment in offensive players. Even if that comes at the expense of the quality of the game or what the players themselves actually desire, the NFL wants to eliminate all contingencies to protect its broadcast (as well as fantasy and betting) money — the talented offensive players who light up NFL RedZone every Sunday. I can think of many, much more efficient ways to improve NFL player safety — as much as one feasibly can in a brutal sport like football — before I ever even entertain the subject of hip-drop tackles. That should tell you everything you need to know.\nThis is virtually the league’s skill-player version of the old rule that bans hits on quarterbacks below the knee. And, if passed, it will be applied in the same byzantine manner. The NFL doesn’t care that defenders will struggle to adjust. You either eat the flag and fine in a situation that often isn’t even in your control, or you simply can’t be part of the fun anymore. Because it’s not about the defense or sanctity of the sport, and it never was.\"\nThe numbers on this are staggering. It's really not a huge issue. It's just the NFL being the NFL.\nA MUST READ: The NFL is only pretending to listen to its players\nPhoto Friday: The other side of March\nUpsets are fun for us, but always devastating for the loser.
