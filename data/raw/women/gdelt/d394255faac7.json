  "body_text": "Former Arsenal man has outplayed Levy – now he must offer a vision for Spurs’ future\n“Joined at the hip” was how Vinai Venkatesham described his relationship with Daniel Levy when the new Tottenham Hotspur chief executive was formally introduced by the club in June, another one of those bold statements in football that barely make it past lunchtime.\nA dizzying period at Spurs this week, a club at which nothing changed for 25 years and then everything changed in 24 hours. When Venkatesham and Levy appeared together on the club’s in-house media joshing about a shared love of red wine, did the younger man know the great secret kept even from Levy? That being, over in the Bahamas, the Lewis family were plotting a Premier League corporate regicide like no other.\nWe may never know whether Venkatesham was aware that the majority shareholders in Spurs’ Enic owners were planning the end of Levy in the chairman’s seat. As Levy himself contemplates life without Spurs one assumes he too has turned that same question over in his head. There would surely be part of the old corporate tough-guy who would admire the ringcraft of the CEO whom he said in June was a friend.\nThere had never before been a chief executive at Spurs in the years when Levy, the executive chairman, simply was Spurs. There were lots of managers and a plentiful range of sporting directors who came and went. But now the clock is back at one minute past midnight with a new man in charge of it all, leading a family of very private billionaires into a brave new world. The Lewis family always owned Spurs. Now they control it – and that brings much higher stakes.\nWhat will be Venkatesham’s edge? He is the Lewis family’s man – and all the indications are that they entrust him to shape Spurs as he sees fit. The timing of his arrival is as important as anything else. The new chairman Peter Charrington is not going to be Levy II – he sits on far too many boards and oversees far too much of other people’s money to spend his life at a football club.\nIn the past two decades, the club has been able to blame Levy for its failures – and occasionally acknowledge his successes. That has offered its own strange sense of reassurance too. Enic struggled at the start with the Manchester United-Arsenal duopoly and Levy tried to find Spurs their own Arsène Wenger – as if that might solve everything. The rise of the new money at Chelsea, Manchester City and later Newcastle United did not help Spurs either. As Levy found his feet, it felt for many years that Spurs and Liverpool occupied the same rung of the ladder. They competed to sign the same players and had the same restrictions placed upon them by an ownership that could not outspend oligarchs and fossil-fuel fortunes.\nIf that was still the case when the two clubs met in the 2019 Champions League final, Liverpool have since then forged ahead. Never as much as this summer when, after winning a second Premier League title, their approach to the transfer window has been as aggressive as those once prosecuted by Sir Alex Ferguson or Roman Abramovich.\nLiverpool have done so, in no small part, as a result of the work of recruitment specialists who cut their teeth at Spurs. The returning Michael Edwards, now owner Fenway Sports Group’s football chief executive, and previously Ian Graham, once the club’s data specialist and head of research. Both of them were relatively junior figures at Spurs in the Harry Redknapp era.\nFSG had a clear idea of how they could compete with much wealthier rivals. They appointed Jürgen Klopp and they embraced the age of data analytics. The resurgence on the pitch improved revenue to a point where it now sits above United for the first time. Spurs were 17th, 16 places behind Liverpool in the Premier League last season and nowhere close to being in the same market for players as them this summer.\nVenkatesham is not a football specialist\nSpurs have made strides under Levy and their new stadium is a much bigger project even than the two Anfield stands rebuilt by FSG. Spurs have the debt on the multi-use stadium to serve, around £850 million, and even if the Lewis family wished to finance a more aggressive recruitment strategy there are, of course, limits to that.\nVenkatesham has to offer a vision for the future. At Arsenal he was well-liked. He forged a new relationship with fans’ groups as well as influential institutions such as the European Club Association and within the Premier League. Venkatesham was the only big-six representative who rang round the other 14 to apologise for his club’s role in the Super League. A former oil trader, he was not a football specialist. Mikel Arteta’s appointment and the signings of various players was left to the likes of Edu, then the club’s sporting director and boardroom heavyweight Tim Lewis.\nVenkatesham was an affable, collegiate type who, among other things, was an enthusiastic backer of Arsenal’s women’s team. It is not hard to see why Levy saw him as a complementary personality, although he never thought Venkatesham would outlast him – much less within the space of three months.\nIt is understood that Venkatesham originally turned down the offer from Levy to join Spurs and felt that he has done all he wished to do in football at Arsenal. Levy was persistent and persuaded Venkatesham it was the right move.\nSince then Venkatesham had been part of the process to appoint Thomas Frank and played a role with sporting director Johan Lange in the transfer window. Although it was telling that it was Levy who oversaw the negotiations with Crystal Palace counterpart Steve Parish over Eberechi Eze. Maybe that was just old habits dying hard. Levy going head to head with another experienced operator who has a stake in his club, as well as a key role in its day-to-day running.\nIt is understood that Venkatesham handled the contract renewal for Cristian Romero, whose relationship with Levy was rumoured to have broken down by this summer. This is by no means Venkatesham’s first run at being part of a big club’s leadership. But from the moment he broke the news to staff on Thursday that Levy had left the building, all eyes turned to the fresh-faced new chief executive. Spurs have been trying to find a way to thrive for a long time – and now, after an extraordinary week, it is Venkatesham’s turn.",
