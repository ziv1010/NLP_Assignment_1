In tonight's (Wednesday) episode, she opened up more about her relationship history.\n\"It’s completely different with women,\" she said, \"especially for me, it’s always been about a deep emotional connection which then makes the sex more passionate than ever anyway because you have such a deep bond between you.”\nShe added: “I had relationships with men throughout my life, there was always something missing for me […] I am attracted to men still but literally that connection will just wear off.”\nWhat to Read Next\nSo who has she dated before? She's been very reticent to talk about her personal life in the past, but this much we know…\nKelly Smith: 2005 until 2013\nThe very definition of a footie power couple, Alex and fellow Lioness Kelly Smith were in a very serious — but secret — relationship for eight years.\nAlex detailed the couple's relationship in her autobiography, How (Not) To Be Strong, saying the pair were once \"madly and deeply in love\".\nShe also added at her book launch event: \"I went back and forth on whether I'd actually be writing the chapter. But then it was one of those moments, I'm writing this book and I want to tell everything. I thought I'd be cheating you all if I didn't put that in there. And for me, it's like that first love story, I fell madly and deeply in love\".\n\"And yes, there's that heartbreak and those things, but it's a huge part of my life and I wouldn't go back and change that. Because that feeling of love and that excitement and what it gives you, it needed to be in there.\"\nThe quiet years: 2013 - 2020\nIn an interview with the Sunday Times, Alex revealed that she had been \"too bruised\" to trust anyone new for years after she and Kelly split in 2013.\nHowever, she added to Fabulous that she didn't understand the pressure put on single people to become a couple: \"There is an implication that there is something wrong with you because you are on your own.\n\"My life has always been about being independent, making sure you can look after yourself and never wanting to feel that someone can walk out on you and take everything away from you. But I do realise that having built myself up, I have to work on knocking down a lot of the invisible walls I have inside me, and that's what I'm trying to do.\"\nShe also revealed that she had signed up for a dating app, but never used it because it felt unnatural to her: \"I haven't actually dared go on it. I am completely hopeless, but every time I think about it, it just doesn't seem natural to me, so absolutely nothing has happened.\"\nSam Robertson: 2020\nIn the same interview, she said that she and Sam Robertson – Adam Barlow on Coronation Street – attempted to go on a date, but it was rudely interrupted by a member of the public trying to sneak a photo of them.\nShe said: \"I never seem to have a lot of luck on dates. My one date in ages was going out with Sam, who is lovely. The next morning, our pictures were all over the press because someone in the restaurant had taken a photo. It wasn't exactly a great start.\"\nJess Glynne: 2023 - present\nDarling, hold my hand… pop star Jess and Alex have been doing exactly that since news broke of their relationship back in October 2023. Alex soft-launched their relationship later that month when she posted a picture of Jess on Instagram, saying: \"Happy new song day and you day\" on the singer's birthday.\nSince then, the couple have apparently gone from strength to strength — with Alex telling campmate Ruby Wax on Tuesday night's I'm A Celeb: \"I think before her, I never knew happiness. […] she just walked up to me… [it was] really ballsy. I was like, 'I like your ballsiness', and then the spark was just instant and then yeah…we fell madly in love.\"\nAnd when asked whether a wedding might be in their future, Alex confessed: \"I will get married to her, just waiting for her to ask, Rubes. I know my forever is with her.\" Awww!\nHappily, she might not need to wait for long. Jess has since hinted that there could be an even bigger prize waiting for Alex at the end of her jungle stint. Today, she posted on her Instagram account: \"I better go get a ring...\" with a sparkling ring and eyes emojis. Now that's an IAC finale worth tuning in for…\nI'm a Celebrity airs on ITV1 and ITVX nightly from 9pm",
