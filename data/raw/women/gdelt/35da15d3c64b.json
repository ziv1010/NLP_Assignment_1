Their awkward reactions after being featured on the kiss cam went viral, sparking discussion about the alleged affair.\nDuring the musical night held at Gillette Stadium in Boston, Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin used a kiss cam to interact with the crowd. At one point, the camera zoomed in on Byron and Cabot, causing a social media uproar. Soon after realising that they were in the spotlight, the CEO ducked, hiding from the lens while Cabot turned her back, covering her face.\nRecommended Stories\n- Surat RTO Books 242 Vehicles For Using Illegal White LED Lights video\n- ‘Cameraman Dadaji Pe Focus Karo’: Elderly Man Steals The Show During Wedding Dance Practice | Video\n- UP Mid-day Meal Row: 2 Packets Of Amul Milk Diluted In ‘Dirty’ Water-Filled Steel Bucket Before Calling School Kids\n- Masked Group, Driving Range Rover, Rob ‘Innocent’ Man At Gunpoint In Broad Daylight: ‘Maybe They Need Money For Petrol'\nThis is not the first time that on-camera kissing has gone wrong. There have been several similar incidents previously. Let us take a look at some of them.\nOlivia Rodrigo Sibling Incident — 2024\nLast year, Olivia Rodrigo’s Guts World Tour witnessed an awkward situation when she unknowingly asked two siblings to kiss each other on camera, thinking they were a couple. The incident happened during her first tour stop in Sydney. “You guys are so cute. I’ve a really huge fun thing to ask. Would you guys give us a kiss on the Guts cam?\" asked Rodrigo, oblivious of their equation.\nEmbarrassed, the boy shook his head with a nervous smile and mouthed, “She’s my sister\" as the girl sitting next to him blushed awkwardly with the crowd at SuperDome roaring with laughter. Realising her mistake, Olivia Rodrigo said, “She’s your sister? Sh**. Never mind, scrap that. Oh, wow. That has not happened before.\"\nLater, Olivia Rodrigo reacted to the error by commenting on the boy’s TikTok video where he wrote, “Olivia Rodrigo asking my sister and me to kiss was not on my 2024 bingo card.\" The Bad Idea Right? Singer commented, “I AM SO SORRY\" in bold letters.\nFootball Fan Cheating Scandal — 2020\nBack in 2020, a football fan was caught cheating on his girlfriend with another woman at the Barcelona SC’s match against Delfin in Ecuador. During halftime, the kiss cam footage showed the man kissing a woman at the stadium. But soon after realising that they were being filmed, he quickly distanced himself from the lady. He removed his arm from the woman, shifted uncomfortably in the seat and leaned forward with frustration.\nLater, when the footage went viral, the man confessed to cheating. Defending himself, he said, “If it were a woman in my place, what would you do? Various videos have been circulating of unfaithful women, but they haven’t been made fun of as much as me. I’m going to defend my honour and my pride as a man until the end. We all fail and we all repent, thank you to those who have invited me to church, and if I go, it is so I can heal my family,\" as per a report by Fox Sports.\nOn-Screen Moment\nIn the Season 1 finale of Modern Family, titled Family Portrait, binge-watchers came across one such on-camera kiss. In the particular scene, Phil Dunphy, who was married to Claire, attended a basketball game with his longtime crush Gloria and friend Manny. When Gloria leaned in and planted a kiss on his lips, Phil looked visibly hesitant and uncomfortable while the crowd booed at Phil for not reciprocating the gesture.\nPhil Dunphy was left in sheer panic, convinced that Claire must have seen Gloria’s spontaneous kiss. However, Claire was only concerned that Phil had ignored her phone call and did not witness the kiss. What followed was a hilarious tangle of misunderstanding and self-sabotage.",
