Lauryn, who claims she has known Kyle since her early twenties shares two children with the married footballer, son Kairo, four and daughter Kinara, one.\nBefore it was revealed that Kyle was also the father of Kinara and Kairo, she teased the KW initials as she shared a Christmas dinner menu with the initials being shown. Lauryn previously revealed she sent Annie, 32, a message just after Christmas confirming the paternity of her daughter following social media speculation.\nNow, she has shared the extremely blunt message with her 246,000 followers on Instagram. \"Hey it's Lauryn,\" she wrote on December 27, adding: \"I just wanted to quickly tell you that Kyle is the father of our daughter. He's been having a relationship with us all including the baby & I've got everything to prove it. He's been apart of our lives seeing the children [sic].\"\nShe continued: \"I wanted to have the decency to tell you. If you want to speak further we can but he's been lying to us both. He doesn't want us to speak. He'll gaslight you saying why hasn't she put it out there knowing we have a legal agreement atm. He'll probably say I'm a nutter or obsessed to get you to believe him. All his boys have known from the start, so don't trust them. I'm sorry.\n\"I've got to protect myself legally if you need to speak again to see evidence etc unblock me on insta so I know to call you. Or [redacted] could always show you in person. This isn't a prank or joke. Think back to all your messages. Your messages in March with him, how weird he was acting before the World Cup.\"\nLauryn also claimed that the message, which was shared in court documents had been leaked to the media by another party claiming: \"This wasn't given to them by me.\" She added that while extracts of the messages had been published, her full message had not been shared.\nIn his written judgement, His Honour Judge Edward Hess wrote: \"As well as making a significant number of obvious social media hints about the paternity, the mother decided to send a text message to the father's wife on 27th December 2023, at a time when she knew the father was playing football so would not be at home, saying: \"Hey its Lauryn I just wanted to quickly tell you that Kyle is the father of our daughter\". This was intended to, and did, cause distress to the father's wife. I do not accept the mother's explanation that this text message was sent in an attempt to create a good working relationship between the two women in the father's life.\"\nHe accused Lauryn of being \"difficult, unreasonable\" and treating Kyle like an \"open-ended chequebook\". The Mirror previously revealed that Walker has no emotional relationship with his children with Lauryn. A source said: \"Unfortunately, he has had to make the decision to not be involved in the children's lives emotionally due to Lauryn's behaviour.\"\nOur source went on to add: \"Lauryn is known for attempting to control a narrative that suits her story - she has consistently sought public attention with staged shoots, trips to the Euros and constant social media goading around her brief encounters with Kyle.\" Lauryn, however, disputes these claims.\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.",
