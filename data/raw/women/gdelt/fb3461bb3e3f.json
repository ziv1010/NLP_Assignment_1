Some have completed permanent moves, while others opt to stage select games at the higher-capacity grounds.\nLiverpool and Aston Villa have both completed stadium moves this summer, while Arsenal have committed to hosting a greater number of games at the Emirates. It is hoped more teams in the top flight will follow suit, sooner rather than later.\nHere's a look at the stadiums that will stage WSL games next season.\nThe Emirates\nThe Emirates won't be Arsenal's only stadium next season, but the club did announce earlier in the summer it will become their main home from next season. Eight of the Gunners' WSL games will be staged in north London, while three of their Champions League games will also be played there if they progress into the group stages.\nAll remaining WSL fixtures, Continental League Cup and FA Cup fixtures will be played at Boreham Wood's Meadow Park, which has been their long-term home. The Emirates has a capacity of 60,704, while Meadow Park can only accommodate 4,500.\nVilla Park\nAston Villa previously played their home games at Walsall's Poundland Bescot Stadium, a little over 10 miles from the club's main ground in B6. This summer, it was announced Villa Park will become the main home of the women's side for the 2024/25 campaign, with the Bescot now serving as a secondary home for non-WSL fixtures.\nVilla Park has a capacity of 42,640 and it is hoped the move will have a positive impact on attendances in the upcoming campaign as the team look to get off to a flying start under new manager Robert de Pauw.\nBroadfield Stadium\nBrighton stage their women's home games at Crawley Town's Broadfield Stadium, just over 21 miles from the Amex Stadium. The ground has a capacity of 6,135 and has been the team's home since their promotion to the WSL in 2019.\nThe Seagulls finished ninth in the league standings last term, ahead of Leicester City, West Ham and Bristol City. Next season, they will work under newly-appointed manager Dario Vidosic.\nKingsmeadow\nThe main home of Chelsea is Kingsmeadow, a 4,850 capacity stadium in Kingston upon Thames, and the ground of League Two side AFC Wimbledon. Chelsea will play handful of fixtures at Stamford Bridge, including their WSL clashes against Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool.\nKingsmeadow is approximately nine miles away from Stamford Bridge, and has been the home of Chelsea since 2017. They have an average attendance of 3,000, while their biggest attendance in the 2023/24 WSL campaign was 32,970 against Arsenal at the Bridge.\nVBS Community Stadium\nBetween 2014 and 2023, Crystal Palace played their home games at Bromley's Hayes Lane. However, last year, they moved to Sutton United's VBS Community Stadium in South London.\nThe VBS Community Stadium has a capacity of just over 5,000, and is roughly 8 miles away from the club's Premier League ground, Selhurst Park. The team do play a select number of fixtures at the main stadium, and they recorded their first win there back in March of this year.\nWalton Hall Park\nWalton Hall Park has been the home of Everton since 2020. They played their first WSL home game at the ground in February that year against Manchester United, which ended in a 3-2 loss for the Toffees.\nThe ground has a capacity of 2,200 with just 500 seats for spectators. It is a little over a mile away from Goodison Park, and three miles away from the club's new stadium on Bramley Moore Dock, which is currently under construction.\nKing Power Stadium\nLeicester City were among the first WSL teams to make the club's main stadium their permanent home. They made the move to Filbert Way in 2021, having previously played at Farley Way Stadium and Riverside Pavilion in Leicester.\nThe King Power has a capacity of 32,261, but they attracted an average attendance of 2,656 in the WSL last term. Burton Albion's Pirelli Stadium is only used as an alternate venue when scheduling prevents them from playing at the King Power.\nSt Helens Stadium\nLiverpool completed a stadium move this summer, having previously played at Tranmere Rovers' Prenton Park in Birkenhead. The lack of appropriate venues in Liverpool's city centre means the club have often had to look elsewhere for stadiums.\nIt was announced in July the Reds would be moving to St Helens Stadium, the home to St Helens RFC. The ground has a capacity of 18,000, but is double the distance from Anfield compared to Prenton Park.\nLast season, Matt Beard's side played just one game at Anfield in the Merseyside derby against Everton. In 2024/25, that will be increased to three games against both Manchester clubs, as well as their city rivals.\nManchester City Joie Stadium\nManchester City play their home games at the Joie Stadium, which was previously known as the Academy Stadium, based on the Etihad Campus. The ground was renamed the Joie Stadium for sponsorship purposes last season.\nThe stadium has a capacity of 7,000, with just under 5,000 seats in total. It has been the home of City's women's team since it opened in 2014, while they do play a handful of games at the Etihad Stadium.\nLeigh Sports Village\nLeigh Sports Village has been the home of Manchester United since their acceptance into the Women's Championship in 2018. It's a 12,000 capacity ground, based in a multi-use sports, retail and housing development in Greater Manchester.\nIt's roughly 15 miles away from the club's main ground, Old Trafford. The women's side first played at the Theatre of Dreams in March 2021, and they continue to play a handful of games there every season.\nGaughan Group Stadium\nThe Gaughan Group Stadium, as it is currently known for sponsorship reasons, has been the home of Tottenham Hotspur since 2022. The ground, more commonly known as Brisbane Road, has a capacity of 9,271.\nIt is the home of Leyton Orient in East London, and is over 10 miles from the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Like most WSL clubs, the Lilywhites do play a handful of fixtures at the main ground every season, often against north London rivals Arsenal.\nChigwell Construction Stadium\nThe Chigwell Construction Stadium is the home of National League side Dagenham & Redbridge, but it has also been the home of West Ham since 2020. It has a capacity of just over 6,000.\nBased in Dagenham, the ground is just over 11 miles from the London Stadium, where the men's team play their home games. The Hammers haven't played at the club's men's stadium since 2019, and they were the only WSL team not to do so last term.",
