Mead featured on 10 occasions last season, scoring five and assisting five in the WSL and UEFA Women's Champions League, before sustaining a devastating ACL injury in November 2022.\nElsewhere, Jonas Eidevall has made five changes to the side that earned a dramatic away point against Manchester United last Friday.\nKatie McCabe, Caitlin Foord and Frida Maanum all return to the starting XI after game-changing displays off the bench against United.\nManuela Zinsberger will be back between the posts and centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy also starts in our backline.\nArsenal starting XI: Zinsberger (GK), Maritz, Ilestedt, Wubben-Moy, Catley, Walti, Little (C), Maanum, McCabe, Foord, Russo\nSubs: D'Angelo (GK), Beattie, Codina, Pelova, Kuhl, Mead, Lacasse, Blackstenius\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
