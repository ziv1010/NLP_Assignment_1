We've won six of our last seven and had one draw. So, confidence is high. We feel like we turned our form about six weeks ago and we hit our best in the second half of the season.\n\"A bunch of new players, some injuries at the start, we knew we'd come home strong, and fourth place is a pretty respectable finish given the turnover we had in the squad.\n\"But, we also know prior results don't mean anything in finals.\"\nJaffas finished fourth on 33 points, one ahead of Maitland (32) and two clear of sixth-placed Newcastle Olympic (31).\nThe Magpies are back in finals after finishing a disappointing ninth last year, 14 points adrift of the top five.\nThey were 1-0 victors over Lambton in their first exchange this season, but Jaffas came from 2-0 down last weekend to win 4-2 in the competition's final round.\nMaitland then drew 2-2 with Belmont Swansea in a catch-up match on Wednesday night.\nMagpies forward Braedyn Crowley finished the season with 22 goals to be the NPL's leading scorer for 2025.\n\"They've got a couple of dangerous players in the front third in Crowley and [Daniel] Mcfarlane, who have been doing really well and scoring lots of goals between them.\n\"We're wary of them, but we're also confident we've put in two good performances against them this year and they've been two good games.\"\nOn Saturday (4pm), second-placed Edgeworth (53 points) will be aiming to beat third-placed Weston (50) for the first time this year when they meet in the qualifying final at Jack McLaughlan Oval.\nWeston beat Edgeworth 1-1 (3-1) on penalties on June 12 to progress to the Australia Cup round of 32 for the first time.\nIn the league, Weston ended the Eagles' unbeaten record with a 2-1 win in a catch-up match on July 16. The Bears were 2-0 victors when they met again in the penultimate round on August 2.\nEdgeworth have the best defensive record in the league, leaking just 15 goals in 22 games, while Weston have the best attacking record of 61 goals.\nThe loss of leading scorer and last year's golden boot Ryan Feutz six weeks ago was a blow to Edgeworth's premiership intentions. Flynn Goodman has scored nine goals and Jaylen Rodwell six.\nWeston's goals are coming from everywhere. Chris Hatfield has scored 14, Cooper Buswell 10, Aaron Niyonkuru and Blake Archbold both seven, and Burke Fahling has notched six in a potent attacking display.\nEdgeworth go into the finals after beating Azzurri 1-0 in the final round while Weston were 2-0 winners over Valentine, who are in the promotion-relegation play-offs after finishing 11th.\nPremiers Broadmeadow (59) have the weekend off.\nValentine travel to fourth-placed Northern League One team Singleton on Saturday (1pm) to play the first leg of a home-and-away promotion-relegation play-off.\nWest Wallsend and Toronto, who were third and second in Northern League One, meet at Lake Macquarie Regional Football Facility on Sunday (5pm) in the first game of their two-legged play-off.\nThe NPL Women's premiers are set to be crowned at Cooks Square Park on Sunday after leaders Maitland (42) and second-placed Charlestown (40) meet in a 4pm showdown.\nThey have shared the results in two previous exchanges. Maitland were 3-0 victors in round seven and Azzurri turned the tables with a 1-0 win in round 14.\nAlso on Sunday, fourth-placed Olympic (25) host third-placed New Lambton (32) at Darling Street Oval (4pm) in a preview of the following weekend's minor semi-final, while Lake Macquarie and Adamstown, both on 13 points, will play for fifth position at Lake Macquarie Regional Football Facility (5pm).",
