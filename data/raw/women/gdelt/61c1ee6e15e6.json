The document stipulates several measures aimed at containing the illegal migration and at implementing the European regulations in the field. Under the new amendments, foreigners will have the right to reside on the Romanian territory until the completion of the asylum procedures. Under the new regulations experts with the European Union Agency for Asylum are allowed to get involved in the process of receiving and analyzing the applications. “First off we are focusing on the optimization of the Foreign Ministry institutions enabling them to respond to both the need of citizens and the Romanian society. At the same time, the measures are meant to bring the national legislation in line with the European regulations in the field, with the recommendations of the European Court and the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union”, one of the MPs says.\nFOOTBALL On Tuesday Romanian sport celebrated 38 years since Steaua Bucharest won the European Football Champions Cup. On May 7, 1986, in Spain, in Seville, a team, made up exclusively of Romanian players, defeated the famous FC Barcelona 2-0 in the penalty shootout. Steaua’s goalkeeper, Helmuth Duckadam, then entered the Book of Records, after he saved all four shots executed by the Catalans. In February 1987, in Monte Carlo, Steaua also won the European Supercup, with the score 1-0 against the Soviets from Dinamo Kiev. Two of the authors of those unique performances in the history of Romanian football, midfielder Lucian Bălan and defender Ilie Bărbulescu, have died in recent years.\nDRILL A multinational NATO exercise entitled “Swift Response” 24, which is also taking place on the territory of Romania, has begun.
