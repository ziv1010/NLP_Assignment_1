  "body_text": "The Newcastle Jets are working with Venues NSW to reach what the club feels is a fairer deal to hire McDonald Jones Stadium this season.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nThe Newcastle Herald revealed the two parties were at loggerheads over what one outsider described as a \"preposterous\" $300,000 security bond to use the region's premier venue this A-League Men's season.\nThe Jets have 13 home games scheduled for McDonald Jones Stadium and are understood to have proposed paying two games in advance, an offer that was rejected by Venues NSW.\nIn a letter issued to the Jets on October 29, ahead of their home clash with Sydney FC, Venues NSW warned that action would be taken to protect the organisation if the Jets didn't pay $250,000 by 5pm on November 12.\nVenues NSW - an agency of the NSW government that oversees several stadiums and arenas across the state - further put the Jets on notice, stating if the balance of the security sum was not paid by Wednesday's deadline, \"Venues NSW will take what other actions are available to protect our position\".\nIt was unclear whether \"other actions\" would involve forcing the Jets to find an alternative venue to play their games.\nThe stand-off prompted Maitland mayor Philip Penfold's call for the Jets to be housed at Maitland Sportsground, should the venue undergo a significant upgrade.\nBut the Herald understands as the Wednesday deadline passed, the Jets and Venues NSW were working to reach a middle ground, and the Jets' next home game against Perth Glory on November 23 will go ahead as planned at McDonald Jones Stadium.\n\"The club has continued to work with the stadium to reach an agreement,\" a Jets spokesperson told the Herald.\nVenues NSW has been contacted for comment.\nIt is believed the Jets, under new ownership, agreed to pay $300,000 last year due to the club's history of non-payment under previous owners. They are also understood to have cleared outstanding debts.\nThere are no A-League Men's games this weekend due to an international window.\nNewcastle's A-League Women's side are back in action on Sunday (2pm), when they head across the ditch to play Wellington Phoenix in round three.\nThe Jets opened their 2025-26 campaign with a 2-1 win away to Canberra United on November 2, then had the bye last weekend.\nThey are set to host Western Sydney in their first home game of the season at No.2 Sportsground on November 22.\nThe club would love to have their women's team also play at McDonald Jones Stadium, but it is financially unviable.\nInstead, they have eight home games at No.2 Sportsground this campaign and one in Maitland.\nLast season, the Jets women were forced to relocate several fixtures due to poor pitch quality.\nA damning report released on Wednesday by Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) - soccer's union body - called for an urgent overhaul of A-League Women.\nThe PFA laid bare the shortcomings of the competition in its 2024-25 A-League Women (ALW) Report after surveys revealed the competition is the \"least preferred league among players\" and was \"falling behind\" other codes in Australia.\nIt also noted the competition had few matchday venues that met the needs of players and fans, highlighting a trade-off between atmosphere and stadium facilities.\n\"Appropriately sized venues that made for a good atmosphere tended to be dated suburban grounds with subpar infrastructure,\" the report stated.\n\"The best pitches and facilities were usually found at major stadia that are too big for the ALW's current crowds.\"\nPlayers from away teams were surveyed at each match last season, with venues scoring ratings out of five for pitch quality, atmosphere and facilities.\nMcDonald Jones Stadium received the highest average rating across the league of five, being the best, for pitch quality and facilities and four for atmosphere.\nNo.2 Sportsground was one of the worst rated, earning two for pitch quality, three for atmosphere and three for facilities.\nMaitland Sportsground, which underwent an upgrade eight years ago, earned four for all three elements.\nFinancial insecurity was reported as being alarmingly high for players, and the PFA is pushing for full-time professionalism.\nThat seems a lofty ambition, however, even with Australia set to host the women's Asian Cup early next year.\nThe ALW minimum salary is $26,500 for a 35-week season, and 62 per cent of players surveyed worked outside of football to supplement a paltry football wage.\nBy comparison, cricketers in Women's Big Bash League earn a minimum wage of $74,851.\nAFLW ($67,337, set to be $72,373 by 2027), NRLW ($41,800, set to be $50,000 by 2027), Super Netball ($45,320), and Women's National Basketball League ($29,465, set to be $46,952 by 2028) are all ahead of ALW in terms of minimum wage.\nTraditionally, the Jets women have trained in the evenings after work, but this year they have switched to early morning sessions (6.30am to 8.30am).\n\"For the girls, I always say the best time to be a female footballer is tomorrow,\" Jets coach Stephen Hoyle said this week.\n\"The game is evolving all the time. If you look at 10 years ago to now, it's really important that the sacrifices that these girls make, we leave it better than we found it for the next generation.\n\"But then, as soon as we can go full-time and provide them with the infrastructure to just be a footballer, the better, because these players are professionals, and they behave like professionals, they just have another life outside of that as well.\"\nJets captain and midfielder Cassidy Davis is back in the mix for a starting spot after missing the opening match due to a foot issue.\nLast season's player of the year Sophie Hoban remains sidelined after being a last-minute withdrawal in Canberra due to a quadriceps strain.",
