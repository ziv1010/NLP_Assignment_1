  "body_text": "Friday’s briefing: Forest hail heroes and Villa overcome Young Boys\nNottingham Forest paid tribute to their 1979 European Cup-winning heroes in style with a 3-0 win over Malmo in the Europa League at the City Ground.\nAston Villa’s 2-1 home win over Young Boys was, though, overshadowed by trouble from the away supporters.\nCeltic came from behind to win 3-1 away to Feyenoord while Old Firm rivals Rangers were held to a 1-1 draw by 10-man Braga at Ibrox.\nIn the Conference League, Crystal Palace slipped to a 2-1 defeat at Strasbourg and Aberdeen drew 1-1 at home against Armenian side Noah.\nForest roll back years with vintage European display\nNottingham Forest paid tribute to their 1979 European Cup-winning heroes in style with a 3-0 win over Malmo in the Europa League.\nNostalgia was in full supply ahead of kick-off, with most of the living players from that famous night paraded on the City Ground pitch as well as a two-minute film projected onto the Brian Clough Stand.\nAlthough the stakes were much lower this time than for Brian Clough’s men in Munich 46 years ago, Forest were again victorious following goals from Ryan Yates, Arnaud Kalimuendo and Nikola Milenkovic.\nForest continued the upward trend under boss Sean Dyche – who has now delivered three wins in a row amid a five-match unbeaten run in all competitions.\nVilla win marred by trouble in away end\nDonyell Malen struck a first-half brace as Aston Villa secured a 2-1 home Europa League victory over Young Boys amid trouble from the away support.\nMalen’s double gave the hosts a deserved two-goal lead at the break – but that resulted in Villa players being pelted by objects thrown by visiting fans.\nThe goalscorer suffered a cut to the head after he was caught by a flying plastic cup.\nOrchestrated clapping and singing turned ugly when Young Boys fell behind and the game was stopped for five minutes as fans clashed with police in the Doug Ellis Stand, and even needed captain Loris Benito to calm them down.\nDozens of police officers were deployed in riot gear in front of the away end, and no further trouble occurred after the interval.\nJoel Monteiro score a late consolation for the Swiss side as Villa closed out a fourth win from five in the competition to sit third in the table.\nMartin O’Neill enjoys winning Europa farewell\nLegend. #FeyenoordCeltic | #UEL | #CelticFC🍀 pic.twitter.com/tqvgZX3sFd\n— Celtic Football Club (@CelticFC) November 27, 2025\nMartin O’Neill wrote a memorable final postscript in his history with Celtic in Europe as the interim manager led his team to a 3-1 win over Feyenoord.\nGoals from Yang Hyun-jun and Reo Hatate saw Celtic come from behind before half-time – and substitute Benjamin Nygren added a late third as the Scottish champions kick-started their Europa League campaign.\nO’Neill, 73, is expected to make way for Wilfried Nancy before Roma visit Celtic Park on December 11 – and will leave the Bhoys, who now have seven points, with a platform to enjoy another memorable European run.\nRangers held by 10-man Braga\nJames Tavernier scored a penalty as Rangers earned their first Europa League point of the season with a 1-1 draw against 10-man Braga at Ibrox.\nDanny Rohl’s side recovered from a slow start to claim a first-half lead but conceded a soft goal to Gabri Martinez in the second period, shortly after Rodrigo Zalazar had been sent off for violent conduct.\nRangers winger Mohamed Diomande was also shown a red card in stoppage time for a second bookable offence.\nThe point lifts Rangers off the foot of the 36-team league, but leaves Rohl’s side up against it if they are to qualify for the knock-out stages with just three matches left to play.\nEagles have wings clipped by Strasbourg\nStrasbourg take the three points against Palace 💙#UECL | @RCSA pic.twitter.com/UN3n1XbAPg\n— UEFA Conference League (@Conf_League) November 27, 2025\nCrystal Palace came unstuck in Strasbourg as they slipped to a 2-1 Conference League defeat.\nTyrick Mitchell’s first-half goal had put the Eagles, who are fifth in the Premier League, on course for a third win from four European matches.\nBut Palace were pegged back by Chelsea-bound striker Emanuel Emegha and then teenager Samir El Mourabet grabbed his first senior goal to complete the turnaround.\nAberdeen’s hopes of remaining in the Conference League beyond Christmas suffered a major blow after they were held to a 1-1 home draw by Armenian champions Noah.\nKevin Nisbet’s first goal of the season put Jimmy Thelin’s side ahead just before half-time, but Nardin Mulahusejnovic headed in an equaliser.\nLeague of Ireland champions Shamrock Rovers were beaten 2-1 by Shakhtar Donetsk as their own winless run continued while Shelbourne lost 2-0 away to AZ Alkmaar.\nWhat’s on today?\nFriday night’s live action in the Sky Bet Championship sees promotion hopefuls Ipswich head to Oxford, who are fighting for points at the other end of the table.\nScotland Women play a friendly against Ukraine in Jerez, while Wales Women take on South Korea in Malaga.\nSeveral Premier League clubs are holding press conferences – including Newcastle, Manchester United and Manchester City along with Arsenal, Chelsea and West Ham.",
