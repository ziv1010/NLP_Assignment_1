She has dedicated herself to refereeing for her country and in the WSL (Women’s Super League).\nYesterday (Thursday) she received an honorary Doctor of Science (DSc) from the University of Chester, in recognition of her contribution to women’s football.\nProfessor Eunice Simmons, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Chester, said: “It is always a moment of pride to celebrate the success of our graduates with their family and friends as they embark on their future careers. We congratulate them on everything they have achieved and wish them well for their futures.\n“It’s also an honour to welcome Cheryl Foster who has done so much to promote women’s football and we’re delighted to award her with an honorary Doctor of Science.”\nCheryl said: \"I am deeply honoured to receive this honorary doctorate degree from the University of Chester in recognition of my contributions to women's football. This recognition is a testament to the power of sport in empowering women and inspiring future generations.”\nAfter retiring from playing, Cheryl became a FIFA referee in 2016 and has dedicated herself to refereeing for her country and in the WSL.\nCheryl has represented Wales at the highest level, becoming the first Welsh female referee at the UEFA Women's Euro 2022. In the following year, Cheryl officiated the UEFA Women’s Champions League final between Barcelona and Wolfsburg. She then became the first Welsh referee since 1978 to officiate at the FIFA Women’s World Cup in Australia 2023.\nThe Llandudno woman has been a trailblazer for Welsh sport, pursuing a pathway in refereeing to \"challenge stereotypes\" and prove females in sport deserve an equal standing with their male counter-parts.\nCheryl is also a PE teacher in Chester who has dedicated hours of her free time talking to upcoming young referees and footballers and inspiring children and particularly young girls to overcome barriers and prejudice to pursue their dreams.\nHer achievements and dedication were recognised by the Welsh government, receiving the Sport Award in 2024. A few months later she received an MBE from Prince William for her services to association football and women’s sport. Cheryl has left a legacy which shows an aspirational path to success for others to follow and build on.\nSign up for the North Wales Live newsletter sent twice daily to your inbox\nSee what's happening in your area:",
