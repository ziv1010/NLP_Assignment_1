I think that's okay.\"\nCarol agreed: \"I think everybody will be the same, Naga but having said that the weather's not looking too bad for most of us on Sunday.\"\nThe broadcaster kept the running joke going throughout the show when Carol returned an hour later to share the latest updates with viewers just tuning in.\nNaga added: \"No one's caring about what you're saying about Sunday morning's weather,\" before she rightly pointed out that there will be a lot of people who are not football fans and will be interested in the weekend's weather report.\nShe continued: \"Actually there will be a lot of people who are not football fans even though they'll get into the spirit of it, there will be a lot of people who will be out and about, doing stuff with families and stuff on Sunday, so every second matters Carol.\"\nHave you joined Threads?
