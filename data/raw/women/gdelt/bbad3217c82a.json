Chloe Harrison filmed passengers singing lewd songs about her the night before last week's Europa League fixture at Camp Nou.\nThe 25-year-old was warned by her supervisor that there were 'some' United fans on the plane. But Chloe, from Audenshaw in Tameside, had to endure lewd bellowing from those on the flight - with one chant even inviting her into the toilet with them.\nShe said: \"I turned up on the flight and my cabin supervisor told me 'we've got a few football fans on, it should be okay, they seem alright'. I walked to the back of the plane and looked and it was just full of men.\nREAD MORE: Girl, 16, dies after being hit by car in horror smash as man arrested\n\"There were like three women on the flight. Even when we were doing the safety demo, they were starting to do small chants about football.\n\"We pulled the trolley out to do the service and as soon as the seatbelt signs went off, they all came to the back to try to go to the toilet. I was thinking 'this is going to be a nightmare'.\"\nChloe's fears on the 6pm flight last Wednesday (February 15) soon turned into a reality. After the cabin crew reportedly sold out of all their beer and vodka, passengers started using her name in their chants after overhearing it during flight announcements.\nThe baffled staff member claims they chanted 'get your t*** out', but also sang 'we love you Chloe, we do' and even 'shoes off if you love Chloe' - all while brandishing one shoe in the air. Yet they ruthlessly mocked her poor colleague - singing 'she serves to the left, she serves to the right, Chloe makes the other flight attendant look like s****'.\nChloe said: \"About half-way through the flight, I was walking down the aisles with a rubbish bag and I could hear something. I looked up and they were all looking at me. I was thinking 'why are they all looking at me while they're chanting?'.\n\"There was one older lady sat in the middle of the plane and she said, 'oh I bet you want to curl up into a ball, don't you?'. I was like 'what are they saying?' and she joined in with them and started singing 'we love you Chloe'.\n\"I was thinking 'how do you know my name?' They must have heard my name when they did the announcements at the start.\"\nChloe added: \"I just wanted to climb inside the rubbish bag. They all took their shoes off and I could hear them chanting 'shoes off if you love Chloe'.\"\nChloe says she was mostly unfazed by the attention on the two-hour flight, even sharing clips of it on TikTok where it racked up more than 2.7million views. \"They were just having a good laugh, excited for the football and going on holiday,\" said Chloe.\nAs the flight progressed and the rowdy fans sank more booze, their chants got louder and louder. Chloe said: \"We sold out of all the beer and all the vodka, they were all really drunk.\n\"They kept asking for more drinks and coming up to the front. There's nothing you can do in that situation, if they're all standing up you just have to tell them to sit down.\n\"We turned lights out for landing and they all started going 'lights out if you love Chloe'. They were making up random chants.\n\"When they were leaving, a few were even joking 'come in the toilet with us'. They were all trying to leave through the back and ask for my Instagram, I kept telling them I don't have it.\n\"They were saying 'I'll never forget you'. I messaged my friends when I got off the plane like 'you'll never believe what's just happened'.\"\nJust three months into her job, Chloe says she's never experienced anything like it before, with other crew members agreeing it rarely happened. Despite social media comments suggesting the men's behaviour was wrong, she said it didn't bother her as it was mostly 'harmless' fun.\nChloe said: \"It made my day go faster, it was fun. I've only worked there [at Ryanair] for three months, but when I spoke to everyone they said it's never been like that before apart from maybe in the summer when people are off to a party place like Ibiza.\n\"I was telling my friend just before that I was looking forward to summer flights and everyone singing and dancing. No one was complaining about it. Everyone found it funny, it was just a laugh.\n\"They were all harmless. A few made a few comments or tried to grab me as I was walking down but I just said 'don't do that'. Other than that they were all funny.\n\"Even when they said 'get your t*** out' and 'Chloe's got a nice a***', it didn't really bother me at all. If there was any trouble we could have got the police on arrival, but we didn't need that.\"\nChloe posted the video to TikTok with the caption: \"Manchester to Barcelona RyanAir flight full of United fans = fun fun fun x The last chant was my favourite.\" One person commented: \"This is brilliant.\"\nAnother wrote: \"Chloe needs a payrise and danger money.\" One added: \"I love the fact that you had a laugh and didn't take any of it seriously. Banter does still exist.\"\nOther TikTok users didn't feel the same way. One sarcastically wrote: \"Yeah 'get your t*** out' is lovely.\"\nAnother commented: \"Omg I can't stress how important it is for us women to stick together against this sort of behaviour. It's not acceptable.\" Ryanair has been approached for comment.\nREAD NEXT:\n- Two women treated by paramedics after crash on busy city centre road\n- Arson attack at former home of Coleen Campbell - hours after she was jailed for her role in the killing of ex-husband - probed by cops\n- Mum who ran fetish Facebook page caught with sick images\n- 'Out of control' mob found guilty of brutal street stabbing which claimed life of dad\n- A year on from war, how Greater Manchester wrapped its arms around Ukraine and her people",
