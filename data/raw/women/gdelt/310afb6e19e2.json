Max stated only that there was a “delay” with the episode and that it would be posted “soon.”\nEventually the episode dropped. The show picks up with a major storyline from the first installment — the return of safety Jonathan Owens from the Paris Olympics, where he watched gymnast Simone Biles, his wife, win three gold medals.\n“I got to see her make history,” Owens tells his teammates in a team meeting. “So I’m blessed, man, and ready to get back at work.”\nThe episode shows a lot of work — and a little bit of fun too — as the Bears prepare for and then play in their preseason game against the Buffalo Bills in New York. Here’s our recap of the highlights from “Hard Knocks.”\nBest practice battle\nPro Bowl cornerback Jaylon Johnson is upset he wasn’t voted among the NFL’s top 100 players in the preseason, and he told the media as much earlier this month. The episode shines a light on Johnson’s thoughts on the topic — and then shows the impressive plays he has been making in camp, particularly against wide receiver Keenan Allen.\n“There ain’t no way,” Johnson says of missing the top 100. “There ain’t no way. I don’t know how you make Pro Bowl, All-Pro and not be a top-100 guy. I could’ve been 101 I guess, but g−−−−−−, Aaron Rodgers didn’t even play in the season and he was voted.\n“I mean, hey, everybody makes mistakes, it ain’t just the media that do it. Players clearly — if they voted for it — they made some g−−−−−− mistakes. But it is what it is. At the end of the day I know the truth and it’s all right, I got some more for them.”\nThe episode then moves to Johnson breaking up several passes against Allen and celebrating joyfully multiple times. Allen acknowledges to reporters he didn’t have a catch against Johnson early in camp but notes: “I’m going to get him, though, tomorrow, one-on-ones.”\nCaleb Williams watch\nQuarterback Caleb Williams is featured again but through a collage of smaller interactions than in the first episode, which heavily focused on his relationship with coach Matt Eberflus.\nAt one point in practice, Williams talks through a slant with rookie wide receiver Rome Odunze. In another clip, Williams asks Odunze if he’s going clubbing because his arms are wrapped in a fishnet-type material under his tape. In a third, Williams enthusiastically congratulates Odunze on a rookie karaoke performance that is much more successful than Williams’ was. Later, during the Bills game, he talks through a missed connection with Odunze on the sideline.\nIn the episode’s only clip from the quarterback room, Williams explains his first memory is playing flag football at 4 years old because his mom didn’t allow him to play tackle at first.\n“That was so blissful,” Williams says of running around and playing flag. “If they actually bring flag football to the Olympics, I would 100% want to do it.”\nAnother behind-the-scenes moment comes when Harrison Freid, Bears director of research and analysis, shows Williams photos of an officiating crew with Eberflus in the room. He explains that Williams may not see all crews in a season but impresses on him that it’s in his best interest to “be good with them.”\nBest fly-on-the-wall moment\nOdunze revving up his teammates during his rookie song is fun to watch, but so is a quieter moment in the episode.\nGeneral manager Ryan Poles and assistant GM Ian Cunningham sit side by side in Poles’ office reviewing practice film.\n“He looks different today, doesn’t he?” Poles asks, confirming he’s asking about Williams.\n“Like in a rhythm?” Cunningham responds. “He knows he’s playing (against the Bills).”\nBest backstory\nThe episode tells the story of Velus Jones Jr.’s experimentation at running back in an effort to make the roster. But it also tells the story of Ian Wheeler, a rookie running back out of Howard who deferred acceptance to medical school.\nWheeler explains that he wants to be a psychiatrist. But first he wants to make a go of playing in the NFL — his dream since he was 3.\nHe’s trying to do that with the help of running backs coach Chad Morton, who can be both hard on and encouraging of Wheeler. Morton at one point says Wheeler is like Eeyore and later comments it’s like he’s wearing a diaper. But then he calls out encouragement for big plays and runs alongside Wheeler as he goes into the end zone in practice.\n“It’s like really tough love at times,” Wheeler says. “And then he’ll come and be like, ‘That was actually a really good play.’ And then tell me not to smile.”\nBest family moment\nWide receiver DJ Moore brings his two children and fiancee to the Museum of Ice Cream in Chicago.\n“This is a dangerous off day,” Moore says.\nThe trip features a hot dog ice cream concoction, complete with hot dog-flavored ice cream, a pink bun and what looks like relish and mustard.\nMoore makes a strange face while eating it, but the family seems to have more fun playing in the “sprinkle pool.”\nFunniest moment\nMoore’s young daughter, Arielle, already has been a star on Bears social media, and she delivers some of the best lines of the episode, including asking Moore about the hot dog ice cream.\n“Is it nasty?” she says.\nAt the game, she declares with conviction that the Bills suck.\nAnd any working parent who has had a child ask an absurd question at a most inconvenient moment can relate to her asking Moore — as he’s on the field preparing for the game — “What’s the bumblebee’s name from ‘IF’?”\nMoore is stumped.\nFunniest moment follow-up\nOffensive lineman Theo Benedet, who was the star of the first episode after stripping down to an eagle Speedo during his rookie song, updates the O-line about all that happened since the episode.\n“People Magazine wanted an interview yesterday,” he says. “There was a 40-year-old mother of two who told me she thought I had very nice legs. One lady said that her eagle had landed, with a winky face.”\nRepeat celebrity appearance\nAfter the show featured Owens and Biles in Episode 1, Biles shows up via old footage in the second episode.\nAfter Owens talks to his teammates about the Olympics, the cameras cut to practice at Halas Hall, where cornerback Jaylon Jones talks to Owens about Biles’ legacy in gymnastics.\n“So in the sports world, she’s like LeBron and Jordan combined?” Jones asks. “That’s what it sounds like.”\nOwens compares her feats as an individual athlete to those of Serena Williams because of the expectation of greatness that follows her. When Jones wonders about Biles teaching him flips, Owens explains they did a rope-climbing contest.\nVideo of the contest shows Biles shimmying up a rope with her legs locked out straight in front of her.\n“I made it like halfway up, bro, and then I’m like, ‘Nah,’” Owens says. “Stay in your lane.”\nBest game moments\nThe episode is heavy on footage from the Bears’ 33-6 preseason victory over the Bills.\nAlong with Williams’ preseason debut, rookies Odunze, Wheeler, Austin Booker and Austin Reed are featured along with Jones’ work at running back.\nBooker, a defensive end drafted in the fifth round, has 2½, and after the first he receives hearty congratulations from defensive coordinator Eric Washington.\n“First NFL sack. First of many,” Washington says. “Go get three more if you’re supposed to get them. Don’t be satisfied.”\nReed, the undrafted quarterback whose appearance in the first preseason game was cut short because of severe weather, gets another shot and completes two passes, including a 34-yarder, much to the delight of his nervous, mic’d-up parents.\nThe episode wraps up nicely when Wheeler scores two touchdowns.",
