Sun-Times…\n-\n- U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Fuentes closed the book on the last of five now-dismissed prosecutions tied to September protests outside a federal immigration holding facility in the western suburbs.\n-Fuentes used a nine-page opinion not only to dismiss, with prejudice, a misdemeanor charge against Dana Briggs, but to highlight how each of those five cases, all tied to Operation Midway Blitz, “were highly unusual in this district for several reasons.”\n- “The court cannot help but note just how unusual and possibly unprecedented it is for the U.S. attorney’s office in this district to charge so hastily that it either could not obtain the indictment in the grand jury or was forced to dismiss upon a conclusion that the case is not provable, in repeated cases of a similar nature,” Fuentes wrote.\n* Related stories…\nSponsored by PhRMA\n340B hospitals mark up medicines and pocket the profit\nDid you know 340B hospitals can charge thousands of dollars for medicines they might have bought for a penny? And they pocket the profit – passing the bill to Illinois patients, employers and taxpayers who are hit with higher medicine costs. The fact is this government program was created in 1992 to help patients access more affordable medicines. Today, the 340B program has become less about patients and more about boosting the bottom lines of hospitals and for-profit pharmacies. Tell Congress it’s time to fix 340B.
