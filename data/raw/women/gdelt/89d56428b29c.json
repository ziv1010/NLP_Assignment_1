But not a SINGLE protest has been done against CBI. Genuine protestors have now been replaced by BJYM & BJP workers on the streets of Kolkata. In their own words: the ONLY agenda is toppling the Govt,\" he added.\nIn order to validate his arguments, Gokhale attached screenshots of the hastag being used and driven by infamous \"BJP and Hindutva\" handles. \"No genuine protestors or ordinary people have used this hashtag,\" he added.\nHighlighting the timeline of the events in his post, the Rajya Sabha MP wrote, \"The hashtag BJP have been trending is \"Mamata Must Resign\". This is how it started: On 15 Aug, AFTER CBI took over the case, BJP IT cell issued a call to \"trend\" the hashtag \"Mamata Must Resign\". This was amplified by BJP ecosystem including head of OpIndia.\"\nFurthermore, he flagged the statistics alleging that the trend is an organized work of BJP IT cell and not something from ordinary people.\n\"Over 2 lakh posts in just 4 days using the EXACT hashtag #MamataMustResign. This is NOT organic. And the reach? Over 91 MILLION. Impossible for ordinary accounts,\" he added.\nThe TMC MP also stated that the saffron party's IT cell is amplifying the trend using bot accounts in various countries. As per the data shared on X (twitter) by Gokhale, almost 45 per cent of posts on the trend are from the US. The other main origin countries were Russia, Eritrea, Nigeria, Colombia and Suriname.\nEnding the thread, he accused the BJP of hijacking the protests and turning them into an agenda for toppling the West Bengal government.\n\"CBI has been silent for 5 days just to help BJP run conspiracies. This \"toolkit\" of BJP+CPM to destabilize Bengal will get a befitting response. We will NOT allow justice to be derailed,\" he added.\nKolkata doctor rape and murder case: SC takes cognisance, CBI in action\nAmid growing outrage over the alleged rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata, the Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognizance of the case and is set to hear it on August 20. This development comes as healthcare services across several states, including West Bengal and Delhi, continue to be disrupted by ongoing protests from junior doctors.In Kolkata, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) continues to probe the incident, with Sandip Ghosh, former principal of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, appearing before the agency for the third consecutive day. The CBI has requested detailed information regarding phone calls Ghosh made before and after the incident, according to a PTI report citing a CBI officer.\nKolkata Police have also been active, summoning TMC MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy shortly after he called for the CBI to interrogate the Kolkata police commissioner. Former BJP MP Locket Chatterjee and two doctors have also been summoned for allegedly spreading rumors and disclosing the victim's identity.\nHealthcare services in West Bengal have been severely impacted for ten days as junior doctors continue their strike, demanding justice and increased security measures. The ongoing protest has also spread to Delhi, where resident doctors have been striking for a week, and Goa, where services at the state-run Goa Medical College and Hospital have been disrupted for three days.\nThe Indian Medical Association's 24-hour strike, which began on Saturday, has ended, but the Action Committee for the Central Protection Act in Delhi has announced the continuation of their strike due to unresolved safety concerns. In solidarity, doctors in Delhi plan to hold a candle march at Rajiv Chowk Metro Station.\nMeanwhile, the West Bengal government has announced new safety measures for women in workplaces, especially in state-run hospitals, including designated safe zones and retiring rooms monitored by CCTV.\nThe tragic incident has sparked a nationwide outcry, with over 70 Padma awardee doctors writing to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging the swift enactment of a special law to protect healthcare workers and calling for the harshest possible punishment for those involved in violence against medical professionals.\nThe case has also drawn significant attention from football fans in Kolkata, where supporters of East Bengal and Mohun Bagan gathered in a rare show of unity to demand justice for the victim. The protest occurred outside the Salt Lake stadium, where a Durand Cup match between the two clubs was canceled due to concerns over law and order.\nThe Union Home Ministry has asked state police forces to provide situation reports every two hours in response to the protests, indicating the gravity of the situation as the nation waits for justice.",
