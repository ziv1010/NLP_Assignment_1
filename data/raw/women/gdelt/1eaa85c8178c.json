As this year’s winners are announced, the calibre of entries offers fresh, thought-provoking and considered work that takes root at the centre of the corporate landscape.\nThis year’s Corporate Engagement Awards winners reflect a diverse range of sectors and disciplines. With a comprehensive programme that honours work across over 20 categories, including ‘Best alignment of brand values during a CSR programme’ and ‘Best stakeholder communications,’ the Corporate Engagement Awards takes into consideration type, sponsorship, CSR, communication and process, ending with the evening’s coveted special award, the Grand Prix.\n“This is the 13th year for the awards programme, and the entries continue to enthuse and inspire our judges,” says Andrew Thomas, publisher of Communicate magazine and founder of the awards. ” Tonight’s Grand Prix winner, the partnership between Three UK, Samaritans and Chelsea F.C, is a charitable initiative raising awareness of the crucial issue of men’s mental health.”\nThe campaign by Three UK, Samaritans and Chelsea F.C used football to address men’s mental health. Suicide is the biggest killer of people under 35 and men under 50, which makes being able to reach out to others for mental health support crucial.\nThree UK’s research found that British people are almost twice as likely to talk about football than their own mental wellbeing. Bringing together several components of all three organisations with a halftime takeover at a Premier League match at Stamford Bridge stadium, the campaign highlighted the mental health support that Samaritans provides. In partnership with Samaritans and Chelsea F.C, the halftime takeover encouraged men to #TalkMoreThanFootball.\nAndrew Thomas continues: “It is the innovation, the creativity and the desire to make a change that mean these three organisations walk away with tonight’s top honour.”\nThe full list of the Corporate Engagement Awards 2023 winners is as follows:\nPARTNERSHIPS\nBest charity, NGO or NFP programme\nGold – Robert Walters Group and the Global Angels Foundation\nSilver – Greene King and Macmillan Cancer Support\nBronze – Superdrug, Savers and Marie Curie\nHighly commended – Sigma Software Group\nBest educational programme\nGold – OVO Foundation\nSilver – NatWest MoneySense\nBronze – Birmingham Organising Committee for the Commonwealth Games and EVERFI\nBronze – WHSmith and National Literacy Trust\nHighly commended – AstraZeneca and Plan International UK\nHighly commended – Barclays LifeSkills\nHighly commended – KPMG\nBest arts and culture programme\nSilver – Sigma Software Group\nBest environmental or sustainable programme\nGold – Northumbrian Water Group and Hopscotch Consulting\nSilver – The Conservation Volunteers and NatWest Group\nBronze – SailGP and Aggreko\nBronze – Springer Nature and Hubbub\nHighly commended – Cargill T¼rkiye and Linkus PR\nBest pro-bono work for a charitable, social or ethical cause\nGold – Sigma Software Group\nSilver – Bowel Research UK (BRUK) and Bladonmore\nSilver – ITV ‘Britain Get Talking’, Mind, YoungMinds and SAMH\nBronze – New Horizon Youth Centre and Havas UK\nBronze – Ukraine Warrior Games Team and TEAM LEWIS Foundation\nBest sports and leisure programme\nGold – Sport England and Hopscotch Consulting\nSilver – Project Rugby\nBronze – Flutter Entertainment plc\nHighly commended – NBA and EVERFI\nSPONSORSHIP\nBest sponsorship activity to support or develop a corporate reputation\nGold – Tata Consultancy Services and Jaguar TCS Racing Formula E Team\nBronze – Takeda, Over The Wall and Hill+Knowlton Strategies\nBest alignment of brand values through sponsorship activity\nGold – Stroke Association and Wiltshire Farm Foods\nSilver – Three UK, Samaritans and Chelsea F.C.\nBest engagement of an internal audience in a sponsorship programme\nGold – Superdrug, Savers and Marie Curie\nBronze – Gowling WLG and DRPG\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\nBest CSR activity or programme to support or develop a corporate reputation\nGold – SoftServe\nSilver – St Richard’s Hospice and DRPG\nBest alignment of brand values during a CSR programme\nGold – Turkish Aerospace\nSilver – Aldermore Bank and EVERFI\nBest community involvement during a CSR programme\nGold – Cargill T¼rkiye and Linkus PR\nBronze – Sigma Software Group\nBest engagement of an internal audience in a CSR programme\nGold – Pets at Home and Hubbub\nGold – Virgin Media O2\nSilver – Samsung UK and We Are Futures, Iris, Taylor Herring, Future Learn\nSilver – TEAM LEWIS Foundation\nBronze – Flutter Entertainment plc\nHighly commended – Paramount and The Chameleon Agency\nBest collaboration for a single event\nGold – Three UK, Samaritans and Chelsea F.C.\nSilver – EPAM Systems, Inc\nBronze – B&Q and Shelter\nBest foundation\nGold – OVO Foundation\nSilver – Make-A-Wish UK, Tommy’s, Whizz Kidz and Poundland/Poundland Foundation\nTIME\nMost effective one-off campaign\nGold – Three UK, Samaritans and Chelsea F.C.\nSilver – NSPCC and Lidl GB\nMost effective long-term commitment\nGold – Greene King and Macmillan Cancer Support\nSilver – Make-A-Wish UK, Tommy’s, Whizz Kidz and Poundland/Poundland Foundation\nSilver – NatWest MoneySense\nBronze – KPMG and National Numeracy\nBronze – Robert Walters Group and the Global Angels Foundation\nBronze – Superdrug, Savers and Marie Curie\nHighly commended – Barclays LifeSkills\nHighly commended – Premier Inn and Restaurants (Whitbread) and Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity\nCOMMUNICATION\nBest stakeholder communications\nSilver – Coloplast UK, Four Agency Worldwide, Colostomy UK, Ileostomy and Internal Pouch Association, and Urostomy Association\nBest internal communications\nSilver – Sigma Software Group\nBronze – Paramount and The Chameleon Agency\nBest PR and external communications\nGold – Weleda and Red Consultancy\nSilver – Three UK, Samaritans and Chelsea F.C.\nBronze – Turkish Aerospace\nPROCESS\nBest collaborative approach\nGold – Greene King and Macmillan Cancer Support\nGold – WHSmith and National Literacy Trust\nSilver – Women in Sport, Places for People, Hey Girls and Hopscotch Consulting\nBronze – Network Rail and Shelter\nBronze – Three UK, Samaritans and Chelsea F.C.\nBest team effort during a programme\nSilver – Convatec\nBronze – CBRE UK and Macmillan Cancer Support\nMost effective sponsorship of a single event\nGold – Takeda, Over The Wall and Hill+Knowlton Strategies\nGRAND ACCOLADE\nGrand prix\nWinner – Three UK, Samaritans and Chelsea F.C.",
