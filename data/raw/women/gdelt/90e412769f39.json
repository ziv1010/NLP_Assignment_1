  "body_text": "Seattle Pride Match Puts Egypt, Iran And FIFA In An Awkward Spotlight\nNext year’s World Cup schedule has created an unexpected clash. The match chosen for the tournament’s single Pride Match is Egypt versus Iran, two countries known for criminalising homosexuality. Both national federations are now pushing FIFA to cancel the celebration.\nHow the Pride Match was chosen.\nThe Seattle organising committee picked 26 June, months before teams were assigned. Once the World Cup draw was finalised, Egypt versus Iran ended up on that date. This is entirely a local decision and not an official FIFA designation. Pride events at sporting matches are common in the United States to create spaces where queer fans and athletes feel safe and included.\nEgypt’s stance on LGBTQIA+ rights.\nHomosexuality is not explicitly illegal in Egypt, but same-sex relationships are not recognised legally. Same-sex marriage, civil unions, and domestic partnerships are all prohibited. Authorities often use laws on “debauchery,” “public morality,” “prostitution,” or “public indecency” to arrest, prosecute, or harass people suspected of being LGBTQIA+. Queer Egyptians face police entrapment, forced “anal examinations,” arrests, and social stigma. Many remain closeted to avoid these risks.\nIran’s penalties for same-sex activity.\nIn Iran, consensual same-sex activity for men can result in long prison terms, flogging, or even the death penalty. For women, punishments include lashes and imprisonment, though only male same-sex acts carry the death sentence under the country’s interpretation of Islamic law. Paradoxically, Iran legally permits gender-affirming surgery and maintains one of the most comprehensive frameworks for transition in the region. Despite this, trans people face severe social stigma, police harassment, and sometimes forced or coerced surgeries. Some gay and bisexual people report being pressured to pursue transition because homosexuality itself is criminalised.\nMedia outlets in the region report swift reactions. Al Jazeera quoted Iran Football Federation president Mehdi Taj, who said both countries had lodged objections. He described the Pride Match label as an “irrational move that supports a certain group”. The BBC reported that Egypt’s Football Association wrote to FIFA saying it “categorically rejects holding any activities related to supporting (homosexuality)” during the match.\nSeattle is home to an estimated 12,000 to 15,000 people of Iranian background. Many supporters travelling from Iran may be blocked from entering the United States under current restrictions. The situation also raises questions about the safety and treatment of queer players within national systems where public acceptance is limited.\nWill FIFA intervene?\nFIFA has stated that the Pride Match decision sits entirely with the local organising committee. Many advocates would see any attempt to pressure Seattle to drop or move the event as siding with governments that penalise or even execute people for being queer. Critics have pointed out that FIFA’s track record includes awarding tournaments to countries with harsh anti-LBGTQIA+ laws, such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar.\nFor now, the Pride Match remains on the schedule. Whether the governing bodies of Iran and Egypt continue to push for its cancellation will likely become an ongoing story as the World Cup approaches.",
