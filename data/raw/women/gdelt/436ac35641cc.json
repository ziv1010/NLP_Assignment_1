We grew into the game because we knew we had to manage our emotions for the first game,” said Italy coach Andrea Soncin.\n“As the match when on we loosened up and out quality showed through.”\nBayern Munich midfielder Caruso’s strike was the only real highlight of a game which boosted Italy’s hopes of taking the other quarter-final spot with Spain seemingly certain to top the group.",
