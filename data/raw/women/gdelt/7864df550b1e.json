  "body_text": "adidas has unveiled the official match ball that will be used when we take on OH Leuven in the UEFA Women's Champions League on Wednesday.\nPaying homage to the host city of Oslo, the design celebrates Nordic heritage, collective strength and the modern evolution of the women’s game.\nRooted in the spirit of Scandinavia, the ball draws inspiration from Nordic Shield Maidens - legendary female warriors who embodied strength, courage, and independence - and the concept of “Skjaldborg”, the shield wall used during battle– symbolising unity, resilience and interconnection. These references are brought to life through a striking visual language that fuses Nordic modernity with intricate etching and carving techniques, echoing ancient armour and craftsmanship reimagined for today’s stage.\nThe football features a crisp white canvas base, overlaid with bold panels between the stars constructed in a metallic fire red finish. Surrounding each star, silver metallic elements evoke protective shields and interlocking armour, reinforcing the theme of collective strength. Detailed silver graphics etched into the red blocking reference Nordic carvings, while tiger motifs – a nod to Oslo’s nickname “Tigerstaden” – are integrated into the design.\nEngineered for elite performance, the official match ball uses adidas’ thermally bonded, seamless construction to provide precision, consistency and control in all match conditions. Its textured surface enhances grip and touch, supporting the technical qualities of top players across the competition — including Beth Mead, Kim Little and Katie McCabe as they look to make their mark in Europe.\nThe official match ball for the UEFA Women’s Champions League Final in Oslo will make it’s debut during the UEFA Women’s Champions League knockout phase and is available today via adidas stores, selected retail partners and online at adidas.co.uk\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
