  "body_text": "Steph Houghton signs Man City contract extension\nManchester City captain Steph Houghton has signed a one-year contract extension with the club until the summer of 2024, which will see her surpass a full decade in sky blue.\nHoughton first joined City at the start of 2014, having established herself as one of the WSL's top defenders during her time at Arsenal. She then went on to play a key role as City became a force within the league.\nThe former England captain saw her 2021/22 campaign ravaged by injury, which had a knock-on effect with her international career and resulted in missing out on Euro 2022. But she has regained full fitness in recent months and hardly missed a minute in the second half of this season.\n\"I'm over the moon to have another year to look forward to at this amazing club,\" Houghton said.\n\"Manchester City has been my home for almost ten years, and I love everything about it – it's my club, and to sign for another year, I'm absolutely buzzing.\nRead the latest Man City Women news here\n\"When I first joined, I just wanted to be here as long as I could, and to play at the top level, so I never really put a number on it. Once you get closer to that decade mark though, you do think about the idea of hitting that milestone.\n\"I feel good in myself and my body, and I'm really enjoying my football, so it was an easy decision for me in all honesty. Both on and off the pitch, I feel as though I've got a lot to give in terms of my expertise and experience with the rest of the girls, and I'll be continuing to support everyone as much as I can. Ultimately though, my happiness has always been the most important thing for me in my career, and I am so happy to be sitting here with another year in City blue to come.\"\nHoughton is already the third Manchester City player to sign a new deal within the last few weeks, following Alanna Kennedy and Khadija Shaw. Manager Gareth Taylor is also expected to get a new one-year deal, with his current contract expiring later this month.",
