  "body_text": "GOOD MORNING. This is Nick Vinocur, wishing you a healthy and productive week in Strasbourg, if that’s where you’re headed. For those of us left behind in Brussels, the weather is meant to revert back to 21 degrees Celsius by Tuesday, with plenty of rain. I’m relieved for my new friend, Xing Hui, a 10-year-old panda at the Pairi Daiza zoo who was looking pretty uncomfortable under Arizona-like temperatures on Saturday afternoon. Pandas’ natural climate is 17-25C, not unlike your Playbook author. Hold tight, Xing.\nHello, Strasbourg: EU life swings back into gear this week with the season’s first plenary session in Strasbourg and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s State of the European Union speech on Wednesday. Read on for the latest on SOTEU, exclusive comments from Austria’s foreign minister on the Martin Selmayr “blood money” furor and an update from the friends of Johan Floderus, the Swedish EU diplomat who’s been held for 512 days, and counting, by the Iranian regime.\nAdiós, Rubiales: But before we get stuck in, Spain’s suspended football chief Luis Rubiales announced his resignation late Sunday, citing the intense public criticism he’s received after forcibly kissing footballer Jenni Hermoso at the Women’s World Cup final. Aitor Hernández-Morales has the story.\nDRIVING THE WEEK: VON DER LEYEN’S SOTEU\nVON DER LEYEN TO TOUT WINS IN SOTEU SPEECH: Ursula von der Leyen is widely expected to trumpet her achievements and stay vague about her plans for the future when she walks up to the dais in the European Parliament at 9 a.m. on Wednesday, to deliver the final SOTEU of her (first?) term as Commission president. The Commission have created this countdown for anyone counting the seconds to the speech.\n**A message from Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: Goalkeepers invites you to imagine two visions for the future. In one, 800 women die every day during childbirth. In the second, virtually no infants or mothers die from preventable causes during childbirth or in the first days of life. This second vision is as plausible as the first.**\nLots to talk about: Von der Leyen, who never campaigned for the job but was picked as a wild card by EU leaders in 2019, has presided over the most geopolitical Commission in a generation, backing Ukraine to the hilt, toughening the bloc’s rhetoric on Beijing and building a tight relationship with U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration.\n‘Promises kept’: Expect the speech to be heavy on numbers, pledges met and promises kept. While Playbook is not aware of the speech’s contents, diplomats who had lunch with von der Leyen at the Berlaymont recently said she’d claimed her office had kept 92 percent of its pledges. And the Berlaymont has produced this slick guide to the Commission’s achievements, titled “Promises Kept,” that may well hint at a theme.\nKeyword bingo: At a time when the Berlaymont’s best-known commissioners, Margrethe Vestager and Frans Timmermans, have either already bolted or are halfway out the door, and with others expected to follow, von der Leyen will likely aim to signal stability by highlighting her track record. Diplomats will be watching closely for any sign from her about the twin hot topics of the day: EU enlargement and its dour twin, internal reform.\nThinking big: With enlargement expected to be a key theme of the speech, Suzanne Lynch and I report today on the EU’s historic push to add new member countries. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s land grab in Ukraine has prompted the EU to move faster on expansion — but rapid growth is going to hurt.\nWhat campaign? Von der Leyen’s speech may have overtones of a campaign address, with nods to the various constituencies that would have a say on any second term: Look how much I’ve done. Wouldn’t you like to keep me around for another five years?\nCloudy crystal ball: But among the diplomats and political operatives Playbook spoke to, none expect von der Leyen to give a clear sign on whether she plans to seek another term after the Parliament election next June. There’s much still to do for an incumbent who, as soon as she becomes “candidate von der Leyen,” could dilute the status of her office and spend all her time campaigning.\nBerlaymont jitters: The problem is the uncertainty for people who work below von der Leyen in the Commission and those who, further afield, have a stake in her decisions. When former President Jean-Claude Juncker left the stage in 2019, he’d made it clear months earlier that he would not seek a second term, giving commissioners and their staff a measure of peace of mind to wrap up their files and plan ahead. This time, the leader’s plans are shrouded in mystery — a recipe for growing anxiety in the cabinets.\nNOW READ THIS: In comments to POLITICO’s Chief Europe Correspondent Matt Karnitschnig, Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg signaled his government was de-escalating a row with the EU’s senior representative in the country, Martin Selmayr, over comments he made about Austria’s imports of Russian gas. “Everything has already been said about this,” Schallenberg said over the weekend in a written response to questions from POLITICO on the affair. “We are working hard to drastically reduce our energy dependency on Russia and we will continue to do so.” Full story here.\nWEST GOES EASY ON RUSSIA AT G20\nG20 REDUX: Did the West just give Russia a free pass to save the G20? That’s the question my colleagues Suzanne Lynch and Alex Ward probe in this wrap-up piece from New Delhi where the G20 ended Sunday. Yes, leaders accomplished what they had set out to achieve — a final summit declaration that all sides could endorse. But at what cost?\nUkraine language: From the get-go, the challenge was always going to be getting buy-in from all leaders on the section on Ukraine, Suzanne and Alex report. The G7 group got what they wanted in terms of language committing countries to “refrain from action against the territorial integrity and sovereignty or political independence of any state.” But there was no specific attribution of blame to Russia.\nThe G20 lives: It seems that getting a text that everyone could endorse trumped other concerns. “The alternative would have been a nonfunctioning of the G20, putting doubt in the future of the G20,” said one EU official.\nFrenemies: The EU’s leadership were also in town, with von der Leyen positioned right beside G20 bad guy Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at Saturday’s afternoon session. European Council President Charles Michel also held a bilat with MBS. Though both Michel and VdL had a busy schedule of meetings, they only participated in one ensemble — the scheduled meeting with host Narendra Modi — the latest indication of the state of relations between the two EU presidents.\nOn China: Von der Leyen said she had a “frank” exchange with China’s Li Qiang. Michel also met the Chinese premier, confirming that plans for an EU-U.S. China summit are underway for later this year.\nTreading a fine line: A statement from Michel following the meeting said that “the One China Policy is a fundamental principle of the EU-China relationship,” adding: “At the same time, the EU naturally has economic ties with Taiwan.”\nCalviño takes the spotlight: Spare a thought for Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who missed the G20 after catching COVID. But for Spanish First Deputy Prime Minister Nadia Calviño it was an opportunity to step into the limelight. The candidate for the presidency of the European Investment Bank substituted for Sánchez at the main sessions, taking her seat alongside some of the world’s most powerful leaders and participating in the leaders’ visit to the Rajghat memorial for Mahatma Gandhi on Sunday.\nPressing the flesh: Calviño also met bilaterally with heavy hitters such as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank President Ajay Banga.\nTHE CASE OF JOHAN FLODERUS\nCAMPAIGN LAUNCHED FOR EU OFFICIAL IMPRISONED IN IRAN: The friends and family of Swedish EU official Johan Floderus are today launching a campaign to support him, as he hits 512 days imprisoned without charge in Iran. Floderus was working at the European Union External Action Service when, in April 2022, he was taken hostage while on holiday in Iran. He turned 33 in prison on Sunday.\nAwful conditions: In a statement shared with Eddy Wax, the Swedish national’s friends and family tell of the inhumane conditions he is enduring at Evin prison in Tehran: 24 hours of light in his cell, just one phone call permitted per month and no contact with his family for the first ten months of detention. He’s spent 300 days in solitary confinement and he had to go on hunger strike to force the Iranians to let him make calls, it states.\n#FreeJohanFloderus: “Johan asked for more to be done in hope of his return home. His family and friends echo his plea and reiterate his innocence of any wrongdoing. Johan Floderus is arbitrarily detained. He should be released immediately and allowed to travel home,” the statement reads. They have launched a website and a hashtag, urging people to contact politicians about his case.\nTime to act, Borrell: “I wonder whether the EU has fulfilled its duty of care and loyalty to its staff,” said one EU official who knows Floderus and works at a directorate-general dealing with relations with non-EU countries. Floderus’ continued imprisonment “makes more of us fair game for rogue states,” the EU official added.\nStockholm and Brussels: Sweden and the EU are jointly responsible for his safe return, Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson said last week when the New York Times broke news of his situation. The bloc’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said last week he’s been working “relentlessly” to free Floderus and will continue to push for his release.\nWorked or works? The EU has sought to present Floderus as an EU and Swedish citizen rather than one of its own staff. Floderus “worked” for the EU, Borrell said in Spain last week. The official transcript of his remarks, though — marked “check against delivery” — suggests erroneously that Borrell used the present tense “works”. This confusion is compounded by the fact Floderus still has a biography page on the EU’s websites, suggesting he is currently employed at his unit in the EEAS dealing with Afghanistan relations. But last week the Commission did not confirm if Floderus is still employed at the EEAS.\n**Did you book your tickets to Paris?

He will be joined by Eurogroup President and Irish Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe, the head of the Northern Ireland civil service and Ireland’s Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.\nMoney man: Speaking ahead of the visit, Šefčovič said: “The European Union’s support to this programme is part of our strong commitment to peace in Northern Ireland, now and in the future … We are — collectively — clearly demonstrating that we are putting our money where our mouth is.”\nEnergy talk: Varadkar will also hold a bilateral meeting with Šefčovič who recently took over responsibility for the Green Deal. Let’s see if the Irish leader, a member of the EPP, repeats his recent call for the EU to set up a new fund to compensate farmers for meeting targets in the Nature Restoration Law.\nSERVING JUSTICE: Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the head of Belarus’ United Transitional Cabinet, writes today in an opinion piece for POLITICO that the Swiss prosecution of a self-confessed member of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko’s murder squad is a watershed moment. “I am confident there will be justice for every crime committed in my country,” she writes, “and that we can show the rest of the world’s dictators that they too will be held to account.”\nGREECE CALLS FOR EU HELP: Greece’s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has called for help from Europe as the death toll from flooding in the country rose to 15 over the weekend, with more still missing. The Greek PM said he will meet Ursula von der Leyen in Strasbourg on Tuesday to discuss extra funds for Greece to tackle the impact of the storm, which he said “was beyond any prediction,” Nektaria Stamouli reports.\nAnger grows: Mitsotakis visited the operations center of the flood-stricken area of Thessaly in central Greece on Sunday afternoon, while riot police fired tear gas at crowds gathered to protest outside. Anger is brewing over the government’s poor handling of yet another natural disaster.\nJUST SAY THAT YOU WANT ME: Donald Tusk is the man Poland’s ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party loves to hate. In the run up to the October 15 election, PiS politicians are taking any topic and repackaging it as an ad hominem attack against the opposition leader, Jamie Dettmer writes.\nBABY BOOMERS: Can a baby-making conference in Budapest help Europe avoid demographic collapse? The populist right certainly hope so. Carlo Martuscelli reports on how leaders such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán want Europe to produce more babies — but policies encouraging a baby boom across the Continent are delivering mixed results.\nRULE, BRUSSELS!

The first is a future based on the way progress is going – slowly and, in some cases, backwards: Over 9 thousand babies still die every day before reaching their first birthday, A woman dies from complications due to childbirth every two minutes. Indeed, the world already has so many of the medicines, technologies, strategies, and expertise needed to reignite progress. They just need to be funded and deployed. But there’s a second, more hopeful vision of the future; one where virtually no infants or mothers die from preventable causes during childbirth. And this second vision is as plausible as the first.
