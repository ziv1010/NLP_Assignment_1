  "body_text": "ADELAIDE, Australia — France coach Herve Renard high-fived his staff on the sideline as it became clear his team was on its way to the quarterfinals of the Women’s World Cup.\nOnly 23 minutes had been played at Adelaide’s Hindmarsh Stadium on Tuesday, but France was already 3-0 up against Morocco and on course for a showdown with co-host Australia.\nThe French scored once more in the second half to win 4-0 and end Morocco’s historic debut run at the World Cup.\n“The result speaks for itself,” Renard said. “We were able to score four times and now we’ve got a foot in the door for the quarterfinals. Things are getting a little bit heated. Only eight teams left in the running. The objective now is to pull off the best performance that the French team has ever done.”\nFrance took fourth place in 2011 and this is the fourth straight time it has advanced to the quarterfinals of the World Cup.\nA three-goal burst in nine minutes took the game away from Morocco, with Kadidiatou Diani, Kenza Dali and Eugenie Le Sommer all scoring early in the match.\nLe Sommer, who is France’s all-time leading scorer, headed in a fourth in the 70th minute to complete the win. She has now scored 92 goals for her country — more than any French player, male or female.\n“Her game was exceptional,” Renard said. “Her legs, it was as if she was 25… I hope that this lasts. Each time I’m actually blown away by what she’s capable of doing.”\nRenard knows France has a sizable task to get past Australia when the teams meet in Brisbane on Saturday for a place in the semifinals.\nFrance lost a friendly to the Matildas leading into the tournament. But Renard said the pressure of being a co-host, along with New Zealand, could weigh heavily on the Australians in front of their home fans.\nFrance was eliminated as hosts in the quarterfinals in 2019.\n“It can be hugely disappointing, and it was for France when they were knocked out in the quarterfinals,” Renard said. “And we are hoping to put Australia through exactly what France went through when they were the host country… We’ve come with great ambition and if you come with great ambition you need to be capable of beating the best teams.”\nMorocco’s tournament is over after it became the first Arab nation to advance to the knockout stage.\nThe Atlas Lions were also the first Arab team to register a win at the Women’s World Cup by beating South Korea in the group stage. They followed that by upsetting group winner Colombia to advance to the round of 16 at the expense of No. 2-ranked Germany.\nBut overcoming France, one of the tournament favorites, was a step too far for Reynald Pedros’ team.\n“I’m not disappointed, because we got to the round of 16. This was our first World Cup and we knew that the further in the competition we got, the harder it would be,” Pedros said.\nHe added that his team’s success was even more remarkable than Morocco’s historic semifinals run at the men’s World Cup last year.\n“Let’s not forget that three years ago we were just putting together a women’s team in Morocco,” he said.\nDiani opened the scoring for France in the 15th minute when she was left unmarked in front of goal to head in Sakina Karchaoui’s cross from the left.\nIt was Diani’s fourth goal of the tournament after her hat trick in France’s 6-3 win over Panama in its final Group F match.\nDali scored five minutes later after Diani cut back from the right. Dali struck a first-time shot low into the corner to beat Morocco goalkeeper Khadija Er-Rmichi.\nAnd France was 3-0 up when Diani blocked the attempted clearance of Nesryne El Chad into the path of Le Sommer to convert.\nLe Sommer got a second goal when she headed it in at the far post from Vicki Becho’s looping cross with 20 minutes left in regulation.\nAustralia advanced to the quarterfinals with a 2-0 win over Denmark. Star striker Sam Kerr returned from a calf injury to make her first appearance at this World Cup. She was a second-half substitute against the Danes.\nColombia 1, Jamaica 0\nColombia’s players danced and sang on the field long after the team secured its historic first trip to the Women’s World Cup quarterfinals.\nCatalina Usme’s second-half goal gave Colombia all it needed to defeat Jamaica in Melbourne. Both teams were aiming for a first victory in the knockout stage, with the winner moving on to the last eight at soccer’s biggest tournament.\n“After the goal went into the net, I had all sorts of emotions,” Usme said. “During all the years in women’s football, it’s such a beautiful moment, giving us the possibility to make history for our country. But we can go beyond. We came here to play seven finals. And we need to go step by step.”\nColombia, a team that didn’t even qualify for the 2019 tournament, played a physical, scrappy match. Linda Caicedo, the team’s 18-year-old sensation who plays for Real Madrid, created opportunities and tested a Jamaica defense that didn’t concede a goal in the group stage.\nColombia moves to Sydney for a Saturday knockout match against European champion England, which advanced on penalties after a scoreless draw with Nigeria.\n“The game against England, we came here to play seven finals,” Usme said. “We’re certain in our preparations. We’re dreaming big. We know we can pull it off. We can do it.”\nUsme yelled in celebration after trapping a long pass from Ana Guzman and calmly finishing in the 52nd minute. When she was subbed off late in the game, the Colombia fans chanted her name and she bowed to the crowd.\nEven when speaking to reporters afterward, Guzman and teammate Jorelyn Carabali broke into song.\nThe match in Melbourne was an anticipated showdown between Caicedo and Jamaican Khadija “Bunny” Shaw. In the end, though, it was Usme’s emphatic goal that made the difference.\n“We are three games away, but each time we get closer to the beautiful trophy that we really dream of. It’s difficult but not impossible,” Caicedo said. “I know we can do it, the team really dreams of it, we want it. There is no obstacle that we can’t overcome.”\nShaw was an attacking force with Manchester City last season, scoring 20 goals in 22 league games, but she went scoreless at the World Cup.\n“Right now we’re a bit low, because didn’t want to end the tournament. But I’m proud of all my teammates,” Shaw said. “A lot of people didn’t think we’d make it this far.\n“We just have to be proud of our performance and lift our heads up. The gap is closing.”\nThe Reggae Girlz had just one goal in the competition, Allyson Swaby’s header in a 1-0 victory over Panama, while Shaw sat out of that match because of a red card in the opener against France.\nCaicedo, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer when she was 15, had a pair of goals in the opening round amid questions about her fitness. She was seen dropping to the ground during a practice session earlier in the tournament but played the entirety of Colombia’s 1-0 loss against Morocco in its group final on Thursday.\nAfter defeating South Korea in its World Cup opener, Colombia upset Germany 2-1 before falling to upstart Morocco in its group finale. Colombia became just the second South American team to top its group, joining Brazil.\nJamaica’s defense held title contenders France and Brazil scoreless in the opening round, helping to push the Reggae Girlz through to the knockout stage. The Jamaicans lost every game at the 2019 tournament, their only other appearance.\nColombia had more chances in the first half but Jamaica’s stout defense held and the match was scoreless at the break.\nThere was a scary moment when Jamaica’s Trudi Carter was hit hard in the face by the ball in the 21st minute but she returned.\nJamaica goalkeeper Becky Spencer was able to punch away Usme’s cross in the 29th. Caicedo sent the ball over the goal with a chance in the 38th.\nJamaica’s Drew Spence was shown a yellow late in the half with a tackle on Caicedo, after Chantelle Swaby was also booked.\nSpence nearly scored on a header in the 82nd but it went just wide. She raised her hands to her face in disbelief over the missed chance to even the game.\nColombia was without Manuela Vanegas because of yellow card accumulation. Guzman, who like Caicedo is 18, replaced her and gave the team some spark — as well as the crucial ball to Usme for the winning goal.\nLas Cafeteras, making their third World Cup appearance, also reached the Round of 16 in 2015 but were stopped in a 2-0 loss to the United States.\nNow, they’re only team from the Americas still in contention.\n“This is an immense pride. It’s a home pride, a regional pride. We know we’re worthy representatives of Colombia and South America,” Colombia coach Nelson Abadia said. “Now we’re representing the whole continent. We’re representing the whole of the Americas.”",
