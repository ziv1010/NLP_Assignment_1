  "body_text": "Netflix has partnered with FIFA on a new soccer game to coincide with next year’s World Cup.\nThe game, which wasn’t given an official title, will connect to most supported TVs and be playable using your phone as a controller. The game’s developer, Santa Monica-based Delphi Interactive, said in the Netflix release that the goal is to make this “the most fun, approachable, and global football game ever created.”\nFurther details on the title, such as gameplay mechanics and a release date, weren’t provided. Netflix says more information will be revealed in 2026.\nNotably, this marks a return for FIFA-branded video games after Electronic Arts ended its long-running licencing deal with the sports organization in 2022. This meant that following FIFA 23, the EA Vancouver-developed series was rebranded to EA Sports FC for every subsequent entry. FIFA is also working with VR developer Enver on the upcoming arcade game FIFA Heroes.\nDelphi’s untitled FIFA game, meanwhile, will join a growing catalogue of Netflix games for TV, including Lego Party!, Tetris Time Warp, Dead Man’s Party: A Knives Out Game and Pictionary: Game Night. These are separate from the more than 100 games that are playable through Netflix on mobile. All of these games are available at no additional cost to Netflix subscribers.\nOutside of gaming, Netflix has also partnered with FIFA to stream the 2027 and 2031 Women’s World Cups in Canada.\nSource: Netflix\nMobileSyrup may earn a commission from purchases made via our links, which helps fund the journalism we provide free on our website.
