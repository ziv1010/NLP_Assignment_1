He would later be part of Nigeria’s Davis Cup team and represented Nigeria at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea.\n“My tennis career started as a ball boy at Ikoyi club,” he said. “Being a ball boy was my side hustle then and it allowed me to earn pocket money and learn to play tennis.\n“I did what everybody around me were doing then (having fun and earning extra pocket money).”\nWhile there were a host of tennis tournaments like the Lord Rumens classics at the time, Odizor revealed winning the ATP tennis competition sponsored by Nuel Ojei group of companies in Ikoyi was his proudest moment.\nRead Also: Kenya’s EndSARS riots\nThe Duke would go on to have some documented rivalries with the likes of David Imonite, Sadiq Abubakar amongst others , however, he said playing with them was neither difficult nor challenging for him as he saw them as teammates rather than rivals.\n” They (Imonitie and co) were my national and Davis Cup team mates but not really my rivals because we were not at the same level then.”\nOdizor claimed his early involvement with the Nigerian national team for his swift transition from amateur to professional,\n“My segue from amateur to professional was seamless because I actually got on the Nigerian national team when I was about 15-years-old and started winning monies immediately,” he said. “My first major win was the Bendel Open around 1974 or 75 ( I think that I won 7,500 naira and Naira was a bit stronger than dollars then). I also won the Guilders Cup or the Nigerian Open back in the day. “\nIndeed 1984 was a pivotal year for Odizor reaching his highest ranking of 20th in the world in the doubles event, however some quarters believe he was ahead of his time and would have been challenging for grand slam titles if he were playing in this current generation.\nNevertheless Odizor disagrees: “The time that I played tennis was God’s chosen times for me. Today’s technology would have allowed me to play a lot longer. I retired because of various injuries and was unable to perform at my optimum ability and or level.”\nUnlike in the 1980s, when tennis competed for space and attention with other great sports like football for instance, the sport is currently a struggling in Nigeria with virtually no player in the top 500 in both the men and women’s game, Odizor believes that atleast a seven-year return to the grassroots would reverse the fortunes of the game in Nigeria.\nHe also said that the stormy waters of politics in the game had stopped many of the off springs of Nigeria’s finest tennis players, including himself from representing the country.\nHe explained: “We need to return to grassroot tennis for at least seven to ten years before we can authoritatively compete with the rest of the world.\n“Actually my son and sons of other Nigerian champions( David Imonitie, Tony Mmoh, Desmond Osuigwe (whose daughter won the French Open juniors) all played tennis but the politics and intrigues of the Nigerian tennis federation discouraged us from allowing our children to waddle in that mess.”\nThe tennis icon also revealed that he would be in Nigeria for a coaching clinic hosted by his Houston-based foundation and is partnering with some Nigerian based companies to sponsor it.\n“The Duke Odizor International Tennis (DOIT) Foundation is responsible for the free summer tennis clinic with sponsorship support from friends and some Nigerian companies ( Rainoil and Captain Martin with Azimuth Shipping Line),” he said. “We are expecting a few more Nigerian companies to join us soon.”\nOn his current state of affairs, Odizor added: ” I actually bought and owned a tennis club in Houston but was too inexperienced back then( (1994) to properly run the facility. It took a toll on my health and had to sell it. I am semi-retired now and enjoying my lifetime pension from the ATP.\n” I mentor and teach a few tennis prodigies in Houston and in Nigeria and looking to opening a tennis academy in the Epe area of Lagos or in Benin, however I am open minded to any state government willing to give us land to build such a tennis academy.”\nWIMBLEDON 2024: WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW\nWimbledon is a grasscourt Grand Slam managed by the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC). The tournament was first held in 1877. Here is what you need to know about the year’s third major after the Australian Open and French Open:\n* Wimbledon is held in London every year.\n* Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam played on grass courts, which is the original surface of the sport. Grass courts tend to produce faster games and favour players with strong serve-and-volley skills.\n* Since it is the oldest tennis tournament in the world, Wimbledon holds on to its traditions, including the all-white dress code for players.\n* In the Royal Box on Centre Court, members of the British royal family and other dignitaries attend matches.\nWHEN IS WIMBLEDON HAPPENING?\n* This year’s Wimbledon runs from July 1 to July 14.\nWHERE IS WIMBLEDON TAKING PLACE?\n* The three main show courts at the All England Club are Centre Court, Court One and Court Two.\n* Unlike other Grand Slam venues, the All England Club does not name its courts after former players.\n* Centre Court is the largest with a capacity of nearly 15,000 spectators and has been the centrepiece of Wimbledon since it opened in 1922.\n* Court One has a capacity of 12,345 while Court Two, nicknamed ‘Graveyard of Champions’, for its history of upsets, seats 4,000.\nWHO IS INVOLVED IN WIMBLEDON?\n* The top-ranked players automatically enter the main draw with 32 seeds announced prior to the draw to ensure they do not meet in the early rounds. From the 2021 Championships, seedings for the gentlemen’s and ladies’ singles are based on world rankings.\n* Australian Open Champion Jannik Sinner is the current men’s world number one.\n* World number two Novak Djokovic will be looking to end his 2024 title drought after winning three of the four Grand Slams last year, as he hunts for a record-extending 25th major trophy.\n* Reigning Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz, who won the French Open this year, is world number three.\n* Poland’s Iga Swiatek, the French Open and U.S. Open champion, is the women’s world number one. Swiatek’s best finish at Wimbledon was in 2023, when she made the quarter-finals.\n* Czech Republic’s Marketa Vondrousova is the defending women’s champion.",
