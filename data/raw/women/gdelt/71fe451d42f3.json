  "body_text": "x\nThe Super Bowl LX stage is set.\nOn Sunday, the New England Patriots downed the AFC No. 1 seed Denver Broncos on the road in increasingly awful, snowy conditions, 10-7.\nIn the NFC, meanwhile, the Seattle Seahawks won a thriller over the Los Angeles Rams, 31-27.\nWith the Patriots and Seahawks set for the Super Bowl on Feb. 8, it's the 11th rematch in the Super Bowl era. The two previously met in a Super Bowl XLIX classic 12 years ago that was decided on Patriots corner Malcolm Butler's goal-line interception with 20 seconds remaining.\n6 years ago today...\n— NFL Stats (@NFL_Stats) February 1, 2021\nThe #Seahawks chose to throw it, and Malcolm Butler got an INT to win SB XLIX... pic.twitter.com/M8I2VuDMAT\nWhile the Seahawks are an early 4.5-point favorite, here are five reasons why the sequel in Santa Clara will have the same ending.\nNew England is allowing 8.7 points per game in the playoffs, tied with the 1982 Miami Dolphins for the second-fewest among 22 teams in the Super Bowl era that needed three wins to reach the big game and only trailing the 2000 Baltimore Ravens, who allowed 5.3 points per game.\nThe run defense has been superb, with the Patriots' AFC playoff opponents averaging 71.3 rushing yards per game and 3.1 yards per carry. The pass rush has also been effective, with New England totaling 12 sacks, including at least three in each game.\nNew England's caught some breaks along the way, such as getting a broken-down Los Angeles Chargers offensive line in the wild-card, a subpar Texans offense in the divisional round and Denver's backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham in a snowstorm. The Seahawks, led by quarterback Sam Darnold (who is infamous for \"saw ghosts\" against New England early in his pro career), will unquestionably be the Patriots' toughest test. But New England won't lack confidence after convincingly shutting down its first three playoff opponents.\nMaye's passing numbers against the Broncos — 10-of-21 for 86 yards — were far from gaudy, but his excellent decision-making with his legs was the difference in the game. The second-year quarterback gained 65 yards on 10 carries, and he picked up a first down or touchdown on all seven of his keepers before three kneel downs in victory formation at the end of the game.\nHis most consequential carry came in the closing minutes on a 3rd-and-6, when Maye called his own number and came up aces.\nDRAKE MAYE OUTRUNS HIM\n— NFL (@NFL) January 25, 2026\nNEvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/1FoNGda29L\nPer Boston Herald's Andrew Callahan, offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels called a safe outside zone run to Rhamondre Stevenson, but Maye improvised at the snap, holding onto the ball for a naked bootleg and picking up seven yards to move the chains.\nAfter the game, center Garrett Bradbury shared his stunned reaction in the moment, telling reporters, \"I hit my block, and all the defenders started running the other way. I'm like, 'What? Oh my God.\"\nIt took a lot of guts for Maye to call an audible. The decision showed that at the most important moments, New England can trust him to make the right play.\nWhat's old is new again.\nBack in January 2002, an upstart Patriots squad with a second-year quarterback entered Super Bowl XXXVI with few giving them much of a chance over the established St. Louis Rams, who were seeking a second Lombardi Trophy in three seasons.\nWhile these Seahawks aren't as proven as those Rams were, the parallels to this season are hard to ignore. Seattle's offense has been on red-hot, averaging 36 points per game in the playoffs, and the defense has been one of the league's best. It's hard to poke holes in the Seahawks, who look like the best team in the NFL. But that was the case 24 years ago. And we know how that ended.\nFebruary 3, 2002: Adam Vinatieri nails a 48-yard field goal on the final play to give the 14-point underdog Patriots a 20-17 win over the St. Louis Rams at Super Bowl XXXVI in New Orleans. pic.twitter.com/CKtnMITgdU\n— This Day In Sports Clips (@TDISportsClips) February 3, 2021\nDuring the postgame show, Fox studio analysts Howie Long and Michael Strahan already raised doubts about New England's ability to keep pace with Seattle's offense. Expect that to be a common refrain over the next two weeks.\nSeahawks wideout Jaxon Smith-Njigba, an Associated Press Offensive Player of the Year finalist, is the most dynamic playmaker on either side, while mid-season trade acquisition Rashid Shaheed has been the perfect vertical complement to an explosive passing attack. Running back Kenneth Walker III displayed his all-around game in Sunday's win over the Rams, finishing with 111 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown on 23 touches.\nThe Patriots will also hear about their strength of schedule — the league's easiest during the regular season (.391) — and how they've benefited from an easy playoff path. That bulletin board material can go a long way.\nOf the last 13 Super Bowl winners, nine have been by the team with the more experienced head coach. That favors New England.\nPatriots head coach Mike Vrabel is in his first year with the team but his seventh season overall, whereas Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald is only in Year 2.\nVrabel is great at giving his teams an edge by mastering the smaller, harder-to-quantify details. On Sunday's game-sealing interception, NFL analyst Nate Tice showed how Vrabel used the league's substitution rules to his advantage, taking as much time as possible to get defenders on the field, forcing Denver to rush the snap, impacting the sequence.\nVrabel’s game management is an advantage https://t.co/9yEoG4K6Kt\n— Ted Nguyen (@FB_FilmAnalysis) January 25, 2026\nAs an underdog going against the league's hottest team, every detail counts for the upset-minded Patriots. They have the right coach for the moment.\nMore must-reads:\n- Stefon Diggs addresses critics after reaching first Super Bowl with Patriots\n- Patriots’ Will Campbell gets roasted for awful first half\n- The 'Super Bowl XXXIX starters (Patriots vs. Eagles)' quiz\n+\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
