  "body_text": "DETROIT — Two summers ago, Jason Foley traveled from Toledo to Chicago to make his big-league debut. Down on the dirt at Guaranteed Rate Field, he stood with his family before the game, taking pictures. Tigers teammate Zack Short was there, too. Now here’s the good part: Short had been sent down the previous day.\nAdvertisement\nThe Tigers had a couple of roster moves, so Foley wasn’t Short’s direct replacement. But in the manager’s office, when A.J. Hinch informed Short he was going back to Toledo, he had something else to add. He asked if Short wanted to hang around an extra day to see Foley’s debut.\n“A.J. has a lot of feel for that type of stuff, and he let him stick around because he understands how important of a moment that is,” Foley said. “Especially for two guys coming from a school where only three total big leaguers have come out of.”\nYes, Foley and Short are two of the only three players from Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Conn., to play in the majors. The other is Troy Scribner, who pitched briefly for the Angels and Diamondbacks in 2017-18.\nShort, the underdog infielder, watched that day from a stadium suite as Foley, the undrafted pitcher, threw a scoreless inning in his major-league debut.\nTwo years later, the former roommates are back together in the Tigers clubhouse.\nThe two are still in a group text with a few buddies from college. And last week, one of the friends put in the chat: Do you guys ever take a step back and think about how wild this is?\n“I almost wish we talked about it more, between us, how cool it actually is,” Short said. “It’s wild. Just walking onto campus the first day, if somebody would have told us, ‘Hey, you guys are gonna play in the big leagues together,’ it’d be like, ‘Sure. Definitely. Yeah, right.’”\nShort ended up at Sacred Heart because it was his only real offer. He was 140 pounds coming out of high school, a talented infielder but not the type of guy who caught the eye of many scouts. He had some interest from nearby Fairfield University, but Sacred Heart offered first, and Short accepted.\nFoley was a tall, hard-throwing right-hander from Long Island, but there was a time he wasn’t even sure if he wanted to play college baseball. He wasn’t heavily recruited and didn’t play in many showcase tournaments. He went to Sacred Heart for its academics almost as much as baseball. At the time, the school had a total enrollment of about 8,500 students.\nAdvertisement\nAsk both players now what their college baseball program was like, and you’ll get an interesting reaction. Half laugh, half sigh.\n“Pretty bottom of the barrel,” Foley said.\n“Not exactly state of the art,” said Short.\nTheir home stadium at the time was The Ballpark at Harbor Yard, an indy league park five miles from campus. The school rented white vans, and the players piled in to play their home games.\nAs freshmen in 2014, they played an early season game against LSU in Baton Rouge. They looked around at the beautiful field and the packed stands and thought, Oh, so this is what baseball is about.\n“And then we just got our brains beat in,” Foley said of Sacred Heart’s 8-1 loss.\nGames were one thing. Practices were another. At Sacred Heart, there were 33 Division I sports and not exactly enough facilities to properly support all of them. They practiced at nearby parks, the football field, the softball field and random indoor facilities.\n“Zack, how many places do you think we practiced at in three years?” Foley shouted one day across the Tigers’ clubhouse. “Twenty-five? 30?”\nShort walked over and pulled up a picture on his phone of the closest thing they had to a regular practice field — a rather pedestrian patch of grass that looked like it could host beer-league softball games.\n“We had a playground in the outfield,” Short said.\n- Sometimes, the baseball team would even practice in the basketball gym. They would bring in portable mounds and place weights on top to hold them in place. Pitchers would do PFP with tennis balls, the coaches sometimes hitting with racquets.\n“We didn’t know anything different,” Foley said.\nTake grounders on a basketball court, and you’ll learn to react quickly.\n“The ball skips,” Short said. “It’s like a wet infield. As soon as it hits the wrong seam, it’s just gonna take off, and you hope that it … doesn’t hit you in the teeth.”\nOn at least one occasion, the baseball team had its practice session cut short when the women’s fencing team entered the gym and claimed it was their turn.\n“I threw a fit,” Foley said.\nAdvertisement\nAnd if a hitter wanted extra work, sometimes they had to wait until midnight — once all those other sports wrapped up their practices — to access their makeshift cages.\nAs much as Foley and Short might bemoan their alma mater, it’s not without hints of love. You have to care about a place to talk about it the way they do. Their Pioneers teams weren’t world-beaters, but they had their moments. As sophomores in 2015, Sacred Heart rallied to win the Northeastern Conference tournament. In the semifinal game, Foley pitched a two-hit shutout and Short hit two home runs. In the final game, Short hit a game-tying double in the ninth and later scored the go-ahead run to defeat conference power Bryant University.\n“To this day, I wouldn’t have traded it or changed it for anything in the world,” Short said.\nShort and Foley shared a dorm suite as sophomores and a house as juniors. At the time, they were regular guys, going to school, playing baseball and having fun. The major leagues still felt a long way away.\n“You never really knew what you were getting from him,” Short said of sharing a place with Foley. “Same thing now. He was a wild card, that’s for sure.”\nEven then, though, Foley could tell Short had a special quality about him. He was the guy who always wanted extra work, who would go home and turn baseball on the TV or go online and watch hitting videos.\n“He’s one of the hardest working guys I know,” Foley said. “He’d be in the cages in the morning and cages at night after games at 10 o’clock.”\nShort was drafted by the Cubs after his junior season in the 17th round of the 2016 draft. He was never a player who came with great expectations. But it turns out the whole experience can sometimes be a little sweeter when you come from somewhere like Sacred Heart.\n“There’s guys from big programs whose life gets significantly worse when they get drafted,” Short said. “I thought I was in the big leagues when I was in rookie ball. Everything just means a little bit more, and it tastes better.”\nAdvertisement\nShort had a methodical rise in the Cubs system, showing ability as a good defender with power and plate discipline. But he suffered a hand injury that derailed his 2019 season shortly after he reached Triple A. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, Short was 25 years old and not invited to the Cubs’ alternate training site. He spent most of that summer at home playing golf and wondering about his baseball future. He would stand in front of the TV holding a bat, anything to get mental reps.\nThen he was traded to the Tigers at the deadline in exchange for Cameron Maybin. When Short got the news, he called his family, and then he called Foley.\n“He didn’t believe me,” Short said at the time.\nShort proved himself the next spring to earn his shot in the majors, but his journey since then hasn’t been linear. Short hit only .141 in his 156 at-bats during the 2021 season. He played only six games in the majors in 2022.\nAnd during an offseason in which many on the outside thought he might be let go, Hinch and team president Scott Harris instead showed faith in Short’s strengths.\nHe was called up to the majors on April 29 as the extra man for a doubleheader. He said that day he hoped to prove his bosses right, and that is largely what he has done since. He homered in his first game and ended up staying on the roster.\nIn his first 23 games, he hit .302 with three home runs and helped the Tigers to a 16-11 record in May.\n“What you’re getting now is a lot like the guy I saw in college,” Foley said.\nFoley’s story shares similar themes: An overlooked player who came out of nowhere to contribute in the majors. He was undrafted out of Sacred Heart but discovered by a Tigers scout in a New England summer league. He came to Detroit as a fastball pitcher with great talent but could struggle with control and allowing hard contact. He had Tommy John just as he was finding his footing in the lower rungs of the minors.\nIn 2020, Foley began throwing a sinker, and the trajectory of his career changed.\nAdvertisement\nNow, Foley ended May with a 1.57 ERA, an elite groundball rate and one of the nastiest sinkers in the league. He has become a go-to late-inning option for the Tigers, a lot different from the guy he was in college.\n“It’s just been night and day,” Short said. “I don’t want to say he didn’t want to be there, but (he) didn’t really love baseball, didn’t realize how good he was, and I still don’t even think he realizes how good he is sometimes.”\nShort and Foley have been in the same organization for a few years now, so sometimes they take all this for granted. Some of their Tigers teammates don’t even realize the connection.\nBut here they are now, two of the only three big-league players to ever come out of Sacred Heart, both under-the-radar talents who fought their way to the major leagues. They happen to be doing it at the same time, for the same team.\nHow do you explain that?\nShort shook his head.\n“You can’t.”\n(Top photo of Jason Foley: Ken Blaze / USA Today)",
