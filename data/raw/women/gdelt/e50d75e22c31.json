  "body_text": "More fans will watch football at Old Trafford this season than in any other in Manchester United’s history. Over 2.3 million tickets have been sold and there are several reasons.\nThe main one is that United keep being drawn at home in cup competitions — 10 consecutive home draws including Fulham in the FA Cup on Sunday. The odds of that happening are 1,024/1.\nAdvertisement\nThrow in the unexpected Europa League play-off against Barcelona, when over 100,000 fans waited in an online queue for home tickets, and you can see why United’s 9,000 executive seat holders are especially delighted, as they pay no extra for cup games.\nIn contrast, regular season ticket holders groan as more ticket money is taken from their bank accounts — the price of following a winning team. Fans had a choice of opting out of that automatic cup scheme to save money, but those who did missed out on League Cup final tickets last month.\nThen there’s demand for tickets, which on a consistent basis has never been higher. The club are now selling out every first-team home game, including the Carabao Cup and Europa League fixtures. This was previously unheard of. Take the 2016-17 Europa League run, for example, with group-stage games against Feyenoord and Zorya Luhansk not coming close to selling out, nor did knockout games against Saint-Etienne (who brought probably the best European away support to Old Trafford in recent years) or Rostov. This season? Five straight home Europa League sell-outs, including against Sheriff Tiraspol, who brought only 150 fans. Those attendances set crowd records for the Europa League group stage.\nAway crowds at Old Trafford are also on the rise. Domestic allocations sell out in 95 per cent of cases: that’s 3,000 for Premier League games, 7,500 in the League Cup and 9,000 in the FA Cup. Southampton, Crystal Palace, Brighton and Bournemouth did not sell out their allocation in the league this season. When that happens, United move the segregation line and sell more home tickets.\nReal Betis brought 4,500 fans to Old Trafford, twice as many as Barcelona. Again, Barcelona not taking their full entitlement meant United could sell more tickets to their own fans. United fans pointed to those extra tickets put on sale being high-price executive ones, but the club are adamant no tickets were re-designated as executive for the Barcelona game.\nMost tickets are taken by season ticket holders, but whenever they become available online to members, they are snapped up within minutes. United closed their membership scheme in January with 360,000 paid-up members — the most members of any club in the world. Bayern Munich are second with 290,000.\nAdvertisement\nUnited now boast members in 167 countries and have a club-record 275 official supporters’ clubs in 94 countries. A United supporters’ club must have a minimum of 50 official members. They have 15 supporters’ clubs in India, where the club planned to play in 2020 before COVID-19, and in the US. United will start taking the Carabao Cup trophy around supporters’ clubs next week.\nNo United tickets for men’s games have gone on general sale this season, but the women’s matches have. For the women’s team, attendances are rising to over 5,000 for home games at Leigh Sports Village and are much higher when they play at Old Trafford. United hope to set an English women’s club crowd record this month at home to West Ham.\n🔈\"Seeing my name there… It's unreal really!\" 🥺✨\n🎞️ Hayley, Vilde and Hannah have looked back at their favourite Old Trafford memories… #MUWomen || #WSL\n— Manchester United Women (@ManUtdWomen) March 17, 2023\nWhile televised games proliferate, often to the inconvenience of match-going fans, the rising demand for tickets to see United echoes rising crowds across English football post-pandemic. The current Premier League average this season is 40,405 — a record for top-flight English football, but clubs at all levels are experiencing a surge in crowds.\nUnited remain the best-supported team in the Premier League with an average attendance of 73,960 at Old Trafford, though its capacity was cut before COVID-19 by 2,000 to reconfigure and provide space for disabled fans and executive areas. The executive area in the Stretford End, which was long a bugbear with fans, will be given over to normal seats from 2024. This is one of several fan-friendly measures taken by a club that has barely communicated with supporters after the Glazer takeover.\nNow? Tickets are priced according to the age of fans (16 and above used to be an adult) and fans can buy cup-only season tickets. They can also donate the cost of a ticket to the club’s charitable foundation if they can’t attend. Over £500,000 will go to the foundation this season for its work with young people across Greater Manchester.\nAdvertisement\nRival clubs have closed the gap on United’s huge home crowds. West Ham United now average 62,453, Spurs 61,628 and Arsenal 60,191. All sell out every week. Liverpool could easily sell more tickets than the 53,276 who pack out Anfield and that’s why a new section is rising above the Anfield Road stand, which will raise the capacity to 61,000. Manchester City also plan a new tier of seating behind one end to raise the Etihad capacity to 61,000.\nNewcastle United, who enjoyed the second-biggest average crowds in the 2000s, slipped to seventh under Mike Ashley’s ownership. They still plan to expand St James Park beyond its 52,000 capacity, possibly by building behind the Gallowgate End. Aston Villa will build a new north stand and Chelsea’s development of Stamford Bridge to lift the capacity from 42,000 towards 60,000 was a stipulation of their sale last year. Everton’s new 55,000 home is rising on the banks of the River Mersey and Leicester City will significantly expand their home.\nManchester United need to expand Old Trafford and one reason is to address the increasing age of fans, which has crept up for decades. The average age of a Stretford Ender was 17 in 1970. It’s 45 now and over 50 in the main stand for season ticket holders. The vocal Red Army section has a much younger age profile, but more needs to be done. A bigger capacity will help.\nThere are plans to build and the club announced last year that Populous, which was behind the Spurs stadium, will work on the development, but details are scarce and uncertainty abounds given we don’t know who will own United six months from now.\nExpand Old Trafford, as United should have done years ago, and the club will enjoy the highest average home attendances in the world — currently, it’s 82,492 at Barcelona, who beat Real Madrid in front of around 95,000 on Sunday. Real Madrid’s Bernabeu will reach its new 85,000 capacity next season.\nLa Liga’s average crowd is 29,213 this season, while Serie A in Italy is similar, at 29,049. Both Milan clubs have enjoyed a crowd surge and average 72,000 in San Siro, while league-leaders Napoli are on 44,000 and Roma on 61,000.\nSevilla, United’s next opponents in the Europa League, average 36,402. You can be sure that Old Trafford will be sold out when they visit next month whatever size of following they bring.\n(Top photo: Michael Regan via Getty Images)",
