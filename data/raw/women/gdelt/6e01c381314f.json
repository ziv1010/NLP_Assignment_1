  "body_text": "Done deal\nUpdated Ellis Simms has completed the formalities on his move to Coventry City after the Sky Blues struck a deal with Everton reportedly worth between £6m and £8m. once all clauses are met.\nAccording to The Athletic, the Sky Blues were the first club prepared to meet Everton's valuation of the striker after Ipswich Town were said to have failed in a move to land him for around half that.\nSimms had been chased by a number of clubs in England's second tier, including Swansea City and Sunderland where he spent the first half of last season on loan, but Coventry won the race to sign the 22-year-old.\nSimms was signed by Everton from Manchester City's youth academy and, following successful loan spells at Blackpool and Hearts, looked to be building a case for breaking into the Toffees' first-team set-up in the near future.\nHe was recalled from the Stadium of Light by Frank Lampard in early January to bolster Everton's striking options while Dominic Calvert-Lewin tried to work his way back to fitness and was tasked by Lampard's successor, Sean Dyche, with leading the line as the lone striker at Anfield and Old Trafford in Premier League games in February.\nThe Oldham-born forward struggled in difficult circumstances against world-class defenders in those games but appeared to have announced his arrival in the top flight with a superbly-taken goal at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea where his strike earned Everton a precious 2-2 draw.\nHowever, Dyche showed little faith that Simms had the ability or experience to effectively lead the line as Calvert-Lewin's understudy and he did not feature much in the run-in.\nHe was effectively put up for sale to raise funds this summer and has now secured a fresh opportunity to build his career at Coventry where he will likely replace rumoured Toffees target Viktor Gyökeres. The Swede is believed to be close to signing for Sporting CP.\nReader Comments (170)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Unless he basically turned us down for Sporting.\n3 Posted 06/07/2023 at 21:31:44\n4 Posted 06/07/2023 at 21:34:09\n5 Posted 06/07/2023 at 21:38:17\nNow go and get Gnonto and Rodrigo.\n6 Posted 06/07/2023 at 22:06:46\nBest of luck, kid.\n7 Posted 06/07/2023 at 22:14:17\nLooks like we're ready to go with a 13-man squad in August. But at least we won't go bankrupt as we wait for P&S penalties to be imposed, and Kenwright can't claim he's made any ridiculous overpays on second-rate Spanish strikers. This strategy is all starting to make complete sense.\nGavin, maybe to Gnonto, no to Rodrigo. Mike, that was a helluva single memory of the lad.\n8 Posted 06/07/2023 at 22:21:34\nI've always said it's not important how much you sell for â€“ it's how you spend the money that counts.\nIf we bring someone in for £8 million who's better, then it's a good deal.\nProblem is, we're woeful when it comes to how we spend money.\n9 Posted 06/07/2023 at 22:26:08\nBut not good enough for Everton apparently; even for further development. That goal must have been an aberration. Just how would £8M change our world anyway?\n10 Posted 06/07/2023 at 22:28:00\n11 Posted 06/07/2023 at 22:30:22\n12 Posted 06/07/2023 at 22:32:47\nI read yesterday that we haven't got the £70M that we brought in from Gordon and Kean sales (not really a surprise) but you would think with the P&S hearing and a possible transfer embargo on the horizon, we would spend £70M this summer, and then sell Onana, Richie-style before next summers 30 June annual accounts deadline.\nWe don't want to be in a situation where we don't buy enough players now, and then aren't allowed to when we're in the Bottom 3 in January.\n13 Posted 06/07/2023 at 22:43:21\n14 Posted 06/07/2023 at 22:46:28\n15 Posted 06/07/2023 at 22:54:25\nI mean Coventry!!!!\n16 Posted 06/07/2023 at 22:55:48\n17 Posted 06/07/2023 at 23:01:05\nThe wages are a sticking point too, but the way I see it, losing Mina's £120k wages would offset it. He's also a Spanish international and can play anywhere across the line. He could also play behind DCL if he's fit in the Doucoure role, so he would give goals and options.\n18 Posted 06/07/2023 at 23:03:51\n4th best GA. GF was OKish.\nMaybe he helps them out with goal-scoring.\nGood luck to him.\n19 Posted 06/07/2023 at 23:07:49\n20 Posted 06/07/2023 at 23:07:49\nNow what I would have done is ask them to sell the striker we wanted in a swap deal involving Simms going to Coventry and the player we wanted coming to us.\nIsn't that what other teams do?\n21 Posted 06/07/2023 at 23:10:27\nIs anyone surprised though? I mean, buying silence can be expensive!\n22 Posted 06/07/2023 at 23:12:15\n23 Posted 06/07/2023 at 23:17:13\n24 Posted 06/07/2023 at 23:18:16\nPaul, re Coventry not wanting to sell to us, I never saw that, only that Gykires possibly preferred to go to Portugal. Player's decision.\nWhilst it's a shame that we are losing some of our younger players like Gibson, Samuels-Smith and Isaac Price, at least we are getting reasonable sums in for some of them.\nI also think that it's good that these players will get a chance to play regularly. Those who are 22/23 need to be playing. Although as has been said before by some posters Samuels-Smith if he goes to Chelsea will probably be loaned out, more than likely back to us so he can sit on the bench\n25 Posted 06/07/2023 at 23:19:42\nI think you'll find it was the third highest paid boardroom in the country which is still nevertheless disgraceful.\nI'm disappointed that Ellis Simms has gone before Maupay and before we signed another striker and that we allowed a very promising LB to go without a fight given we have no cover in that position.\nI just hope Dyche creates the fittest team in the league because woebetide us if we get any injuries.\nReports of Iwobi and Demarai Gray wanting away are also very concerning as I doubt we will replace them with better quality.\n26 Posted 06/07/2023 at 23:30:45\nWho'd be football manager/Chairman/owner?\n27 Posted 06/07/2023 at 23:41:39\nAlmeria chief executive Mohamed El Assy said the Toffees had made a bid for the La Liga side's 21-year-old frontman El Bilal Toure.\nThe Mali international reportedly has a 40 million Euros (£34.3m) release clause, but BBC Sport understands El Assy's quotes about a formal offer from Everton are wide of the mark.\nCome on Bill not like you to keep us in the dark.\n28 Posted 06/07/2023 at 23:45:12\nWith due respect to Ellis he hasn't pulled trees up or made himself a definite first team player with his performances.\nYes Ellis may prove himself to be a decent player but if we can sell 2-3 young players who are on the perhifery of the first team to generate 20-25m to invest in players that will have an impact THIS SEASON. I'm OK with it.\nI'd rather keep Branthwaite, who imo, is the one young player who stands above the others at the moment.\n29 Posted 06/07/2023 at 23:54:43\nBut without Sporting paying Coventry the reported â‚¬15 Million (that's a big fat £12.8 Million that we don't have!) for GyÃ¶keres, there is no way Coventry would have the cash to come over with a bid for Simms. Up until this, there has also been nothing else we can ponder on in the market, other than an aggressive Ipswich trying to low-ball us on Simms with opening bids of £3 to 4 Million.\n(Quick tangent: Ipswich is going for back-to-back promotion, which gave Coventry added-motivations to out-bid a promotion rival and prevent them from strengthening. No hard feelings Tractor Boys!)\n£6 to 8 Million is exactly the range I hoped we can get for Simms when Ipswich made the initial overture back in early June. An expiring contract with Dyche's indifferent opinon on him, this price should bring some smiles to some depressed Evertonians. If there are Add-Ons in addition to the amount above, I'll buy a round of drinks for my colleagues after work.\nAfter some tidy work on the Samuel-Smiths deal, Thelwell continues trying his best to pull rabbits out of his hat.\nAs a founding member, I am inviting membership request for the #ThelwellBrigade.\n30 Posted 06/07/2023 at 23:59:46\nSurprised he is leaving a club going places...\n31 Posted 07/07/2023 at 00:11:13\nThat said, we are running out of players, even average ones, yet we still have to pay the Invisible Threesome £15m a year. Can we not con the Arabs into taking them? Closing down sale, everything must go.\nI'm thinking of dusting off my boots. I'm crap but that doesn't seem to be a problem and unlike Maupay, I'm available on a free and am cheap as chips on salary, so that should be music to the board's ears... that is, if we actually have a board.\n32 Posted 07/07/2023 at 00:37:55\nTo get £52m for Simms, Gordon and ISS is a good testament to an academy that's failed to make much money in player sales since Rooney.\nGood luck to Simms. I could be wrong but he looks like he might be the next Dwight Gayle, a player destined to flit between good championship teams and poor Premier League ones. Nothing wrong with that. He'll make a good living.\n33 Posted 07/07/2023 at 01:16:05\nI'll seriously lose it if we don't sign someone next week now.\n34 Posted 07/07/2023 at 03:50:11\nYou forgot $400,000 on Price although minus whatever we “settledâ€ with Carlo out of court.\n35 Posted 07/07/2023 at 03:55:02\nIs this the wholesale shake up that is needed and when does it get around to the big money earners. Gbamin has walked but no word from the club and Gomes back for pre-season while Doucoure and Iwobi are in their last year of contract. Speak now or forever hold your piece.\n36 Posted 07/07/2023 at 04:52:11\nToure from Almeria looked a replacement for Simms, but he has lost 106 days last season due to a muscle injury and I found one report that he is not playing at the moment.\nIt seems that younger players are being sold rather than loaned out. Seems there is a threadbare strategy at the moment. It will be interesting to see who comes in on loan or bought. It now looks that the deals for Dele Alli and Maupay were robbery.\n37 Posted 07/07/2023 at 05:50:42\nEven if all deals are to come in at the lower end of the reported ranges:\nSimms = £6 Million\nSamuels-Smith = £3 Million\nNkounkou = £2 Million (â‚¬2.2 Million)\nBroadhead = £1 Million\nPrice = £400K (thanks to Kieran@34!)\nWe actually got only £2.125 Million (85% of the £2.5 Million) from the Stones payment due to a 15% add-on clause when we got him from Barnsley. So, Barnsley got a Secret Santa too.\nThat's £14.5 Million so far in this calendar year (even though the full amount might take some time to be fully in the bank) to help balancing the book. Not too shabby compared to our endless Free Transfers of Youngsters in the past!\n38 Posted 07/07/2023 at 06:07:10\nPaul Kossof, how do you know we went for Gyokeres? And if we did, how do you know it was Coventry that wouldn't sell him to us? They were clearly up for selling him, possibly due to the fact he appears to be going to Sporting Lisbon. It looks to me like the lad has chosen the chances of winning things and playing European football over the chance to be playing in the championship again in 12 months time, can you blame him?\n39 Posted 07/07/2023 at 06:33:55\nAnd yet, the bloody RS when faced with a similar situation managed to get £23 million for Rian Brewster.\nWhat the hell kind of team do they have negotiating for them? I mean, fair play, but bloody hell.\n40 Posted 07/07/2023 at 06:48:17\nThere will be strengthening this window, as failure to will inevitably cost more. So at the moment I am remaining calm. Thelwell will have his targets lined up and will likely need every penny of money available to him to land them.\nIt's probably a minority view but I think there will be squad investment with an overall net spend of about £40M. Time will tell.\nThis is a good move for Ellis Simms and Coventry, at £6-8M, it is a good investment and probably the best Everton can get.\nIt would be pointless staying at Everton and spending most of the time on the bench. He needs to play and make an impact. He's scored goals wherever he's gone and, if he gets an injury-free run of games, he could easily come good for Coventry and score 15 or 20 next season, getting them into the playoffs again.\nBest of luck to him, many Evertonians will be following his progress with interest next season.\n41 Posted 07/07/2023 at 06:56:29\nSpot on.\n42 Posted 07/07/2023 at 07:00:51\n43 Posted 07/07/2023 at 07:54:14\nI'm not holding my breath!\n44 Posted 07/07/2023 at 08:04:09\nI think Coventry will do well out of both deals. I just hope we insert a decent profit % on the deal, as despite not being good enough for Everton now, you can see him going for £20M in the future if he bangs in 20 goals. £8M will not look like great business then.\n45 Posted 07/07/2023 at 08:12:12\nI don't think we do sell-on clauses, Kenwright can't be arsed with the complications.\n46 Posted 07/07/2023 at 08:20:14\n47 Posted 07/07/2023 at 08:22:06\nThat says it all.\nCommunicate. Be decisive and tell, not just us mortal supporters, but the footballing world what is going on.\nUncertainty and indecisiveness is never a good thing.\nThe lack of communication and decisiveness is making those who tagged him as \"Dithering Davey\" look like an inspirational leader who made decisions quickly.\n48 Posted 07/07/2023 at 08:22:12\nSaying that, if we don't replace all these outgoings, they're all bad deals.\n49 Posted 07/07/2023 at 08:32:55\nAs someone said earlier, just imagine if Dyche could get a tune out of Dele?! For the sake of another £10M, it might be worth playing him this season considering his wages. I think we can play him another 6 or 7 times before the fee is due, could be worth sticking him in and seeing how he goes.\nYes, I'm clutching at straws, but he was a very good player at one time and stranger things have happened in football before.\n50 Posted 07/07/2023 at 08:33:42\nHowever, £6-£8M for an academy player is the type of business we should have been doing for years.\n51 Posted 07/07/2023 at 08:34:49\nI liked your comment and it made me laugh. Lay off the pink away shirts though. I thought they were great and I got one.\nEverton have a long history of using that colour in away jerseys and some of the very few good away performances last season featured it â€“ including the mauling of Brighton!\n52 Posted 07/07/2023 at 08:35:50\nOur mismanagement previously was putting young players on professional contracts, then ultimately releasing them without a fee when those contracts ended.\n53 Posted 07/07/2023 at 08:43:51\nReality is the academy is either where players make it in rare cases for most clubs or it's a way of earning money from Championship clubs. For years, we just let our youngsters rot there (Luke Garbutt, anyone?) and then leave for basically nothing.\nBeing academy graduates, the fees we receive for Gordon and Simms alone are pure profit and help our books out a lot.\n54 Posted 07/07/2023 at 08:46:39\nAdded to the Gordon fee, that will help the profit figure for the year!\n55 Posted 07/07/2023 at 08:47:27\nEven if (and it is a colossal 'if') Dele stepped up and showed the desire and performed, it would still not be worth stumping up £10M to Spurs as he is out of contract at the end of the season.\nI for one am (like others) praying we can get some chump change for Gomes and Gbamin, surely someone would pay £5M each given their improved performances last season and improved injury problems? Dele will have to be loaned out.\nWe'd better have some irons in the frickin' fire or there will be uproar after keeping Bill on. I want to completely lose my shit over GyÃ¶keres slipping through our fingers whilst Simms goes there; however, I am going to maintain for now a small fool's hope that Thelwell is given free reign to do his job and has targets lined up.\nOf the players out so far, none were regular first team players, I am much more concerned about who plays in midfield during the African Nations Cup!\n56 Posted 07/07/2023 at 08:55:38\nWhile you are right about transparency, Moshiri has never wanted transparency â€“ he has always wanted to operate at arm's length â€“ and that's why he thought texting Jim White was the way to communicate with fans. I don't think he is alone â€“ most owners of football clubs very rarely come out and address supporters.\nThe changes we have made at board level are purely cosmetic as the two people who need to be gone are still there, and getting shut of Moshiri will prove to be the most difficult. Makes you wonder why there is such a delay in MSP investing reportedly £130 million for 25% ownership, still leaves Moshiri owning 70% of the shares.\nIf Moshiri couldn't come out and address the fans after two successive relegation battles, I don't expect him to come out now and outline what going forward looks like. Let's not forget, this is the man who told us in January \"If we need a striker, I will get one.\"\nSince his boss has had to leave the scene, Moshiri has less interest and is only staying till the stadium is built and hopes a rich Arab state will offer him and Usmanov a way to reduce their debt.\n57 Posted 07/07/2023 at 09:08:38\nI can't help thinking relegation is the least of our worries. Grand Old Team eh!\n58 Posted 07/07/2023 at 09:17:39\n£10M might sound a lot for a player out of contract but it's small change compared to the cost of relegation! If Dele can weigh in with 10 goals then it's worth it.\nBuy, like you said, he's checked out and couldn't even cut it in Turkey. It's just a pipe dream I'm having as someone challenged me on another thread yesterday to come up with some positive news and I realised just how little of that there actually is!\nBesides finally bringing in some money for academy players. That's about it.\n59 Posted 07/07/2023 at 09:31:34\nYes Ellis may prove himself to be a decent player but if we can sell 2-3 young players who are on the perhifery of the first team to generate 20-25 m to invest in players that will play THIS YEAR then I can live with that.\nThe big \"if\" is if Dyche gets to spend it on players.\n60 Posted 07/07/2023 at 10:07:36\nI'd be really disappointed if we sell Ellis...\n61 Posted 07/07/2023 at 10:31:44\nAlso the â€˜have we or haven't we' where you have a go at Kenwright for â€˜keeping us in the dark?!!' I mean, I hate Kenwright but I would never expect a chairman to comment on some other head the ball chairman trying to drive his players price up?\nI'm all for slating the man and every bad decision he's made but when we're slagging the club off for not commenting on transfer bible or whatever we're in a worse state than I thought!!!\n62 Posted 07/07/2023 at 10:43:46\nThat is probably why only Ipswich and Coventry have enquired. He wasn't going to make it with us. I do wish him well though and he probably has found his level and will do okay wherever he goes at that level.\nAs far as Everton are concerned, if the £8m fee is finally agreed, it is an acceptable amount particularly if a sell-on fee can be included. Canon to step up then?\n63 Posted 07/07/2023 at 10:51:08\n64 Posted 07/07/2023 at 11:51:32\n65 Posted 07/07/2023 at 11:57:14\nWhatever, we are still bereft of any decent strikers and one dreads what is to come yet again.\n66 Posted 07/07/2023 at 11:57:47\nSelling Simms makes sense.\n67 Posted 07/07/2023 at 12:02:15\nGetting £8m for an academy player who the manager doesn't fancy is good news! Much better than endless academy talent leaving for peanuts.\nWe seem to be getting linked with some talented younger players (Bilal Toure, Gnonto, Summerville etc) and there will also be some good players available on loan (Danjuma etc).\nLast summer (bar Maupay) was one of our most sensible transfer windows in a while and I'm quietly optimistic that we might make some decent moves this summer too.\nDyche has proven he can perform wonders on a shoestring and that may be what is needed till the stadium is finished. It will be ok. I think!\n68 Posted 07/07/2023 at 12:31:33\nHowever, we aren't replacing them. Everton being linked with players means nothing.\nI am very worried about the lack of activity and the usual silence from the owner and board.\nWhy for once do we not just act, get the players in, and have a proper pre-season where Dyche can get them fit and working within a system and getting our identity back?\n69 Posted 07/07/2023 at 12:47:47\nThe silence is fine by me. I am never assured by anything The Oligarch's Mate or Young Mr Grace say.\nWe'll bring in players, many of whom will see us as a good start in the Premier League, or a stepping stone to bigger things if they're good enough.\n70 Posted 07/07/2023 at 12:48:53\nIf Chairman Bill has been involved in the negotiations then we will get the full £8 million conditional on Ellis winning the Champions League and being the first man to set foot on Mars.\n71 Posted 07/07/2023 at 13:01:31\nSimms will be good (not great) in the Championship and may end up in the Premier League eventually but, for now, is not quite at the level we need. So, letting him go makes sense, getting some money makes sense, and at the very least, it ensures that next season's strike force will have to be different.\nI expect Maupay to go also, even if it's on loan and we cover some wages â€“ he will want to get out while he still has some reputation intact (outside of our fanbase).\nFinally, our form under Dyche over the last 10 games was delivering 1 point a game, that then rose to 1.6 over the last 5 games. even if we take a middle ground of 1.3 over 38 games, it brings us 49 points.\nI'm not saying that's what we will get but with a few additions, Doucoure and the midfield looking more dangerous, McNeil chipping in and Calvert-Lewin for more than 3 games, I'm confident that Dyche will keep us out of the Bottom 3 pretty easily. So, sell, sell, sell, we'll be fine.\n72 Posted 07/07/2023 at 13:03:09\nI agree with Sam H, and Paul T, to a certain degree because we are getting a lot more for Ellis Simms than we got for Jonjoe Kenny and Tom Davies, but I was just commenting on the negativity around the club, which hasn't been this bad since Mr T (transparency) sold Rooney, for half the price he said he would. But at least it kept him in charge.\n73 Posted 07/07/2023 at 13:09:14\nI lot depends on Calvert-Lewin's fitness this season; if and it's a big â€˜if', he can stay fit, it will make a massive difference.\nI know Maupay is the current whipping boy but I think the absence of Calvert-Lewin was a large factor in his lack of form.\nMoshiri will not want us relegated any more than we do so there will be some money available for replacements, I'm sure.\nLooking through our squad, we have the basis of a mid-table side if we can strengthen up front and left-back.\nI have every confidence in Dyche to get the best out of what he's got to choose from, it won't be fancy stuff but we will be hard to beat.\nJust looking at the betting we are 1/4 to stay up and there's 5 other teams more likely to be relegated before us.\n74 Posted 07/07/2023 at 13:12:03\nWe can't keep hanging onto players in the hope that they will suddenly come good. Maybe if we had a stronger squad we could afford to wait a bit longer. But we need players who are ready to go right now and not at some unspecified time in the future.\nWe have had our fingers burned too many times waiting for some young player to get up to scratch already. Personally I doubt Dobbin or Cannon will make the grade either.\nEven if Simms did turn out to be the next Rooney, we couldn't keep him anyway. We saw that last season with Gordon and Richarlison sales. We are simply not in any position to refuse decent offers for any of our players, especially fringe ones.\n75 Posted 07/07/2023 at 13:26:17\nI think we've done decent business so far â€“ especially if we get £8M for Simms â€“ but let's see who we manage to buy. We need to bring in new players quickly because Dyche will want a full pre-season with them in order to break them into little bits and reassemble them.\nRodrigo is 32, so £3.5M and high wages is a risk for me if he asks for a 3-year contract or something stupid like that.\n76 Posted 07/07/2023 at 13:50:57\nYes its very frustrating. I can only assume that getting the players in so late every summer is to do with the financial restrictions at the club and need to shift other players first.\nHowever, I'd rather get good players in late in the window than average players in at the start. If we have another window like last summer i'll be fairly pleased. Onana, McNeil, Garner, Gueye and Tarkwoski were all good moves (though Maupay was obviously poor and the loan move for Vinagre was wasted).\nI'm hoping by the end of the window for at least 3 or 4 new transfers in and a loan or two.\n77 Posted 07/07/2023 at 14:21:02\n78 Posted 07/07/2023 at 14:30:56\n79 Posted 07/07/2023 at 14:45:40\nIf for argument's sake, we leave their output as a \"push\", one was on pennies for one more season. The other 2 more years at £70k per week.\nMoney made the former real easy to move, the latter might be tough to move this season.\n81 Posted 07/07/2023 at 16:41:17\nMuch appreciated from Toffees who know what he did for our club.\n82 Posted 07/07/2023 at 17:03:39\nEverton reportedly offered Simms and Broadhead to Coventry in exchange for GyÃ¶keres in January.\n83 Posted 07/07/2023 at 17:03:54\nTeams don't want to let players go until they have their replacement in place. Sides won't sanction moves until they know the make up of their squad.\nUnless you are operating at the very top tier, with top budgets, it's hard to get your targets signed. There's a premium to pay to get things done early and Everton can't afford that premium.\nSides play hard ball, inflating prices until the last couple of weeks of the window when they have no option but to compromise or be stuck with bloated sqauds, bigger wage bills or unhappy players.\nBe patient, I'd say. It's not what we want but it's our reality.\nOne thing I'm interested to see is the profile of player Dyche and Thelwell go for. As Sam Hoare states, last year's window was positive (Maupay aside). Another positive window with maybe another Onana out the bag would mean decent progress.\n84 Posted 07/07/2023 at 17:11:44\nIf Simms leaves, I think that would make it 7 senior players out and none in...\nWe also currently have 9 senior midfielders listed but 3 won't play. Only one real striker and only one left-back in the squad. Whilst we can put out a decentish first XI, assuming everyone is fit, we have nothing in reserve.\n5 weeks to kick-off â€” strange times.\n85 Posted 07/07/2023 at 17:31:04\nHow many would you really say I'm disappointed we have sols them or they will be hard to replace ? ?\nI can't think of 1.\nI think Branthwaite will make more than a capable replacement for coady. Mina barely played so he's not going to be missed at cb.\nHe will be missed in A&E with his dry pasta legs.\nSimms for Cannon is an upgrade I'd say. It's not like the sale of Richarlison so let's not get carried away.\nWe have been calling for the deadwood to be shed. When we start to shed the deadwood people fear the sqauds to thin.\n86 Posted 07/07/2023 at 17:54:44\nSporting management is openly talking about him to the Press. I take that as an indication Coventry have given them permission.\nReading his own quotes, Gyokere's sounds like he's leaving to go somewhere.\nI know and agree we need to sign some firepower, due to our lack of it.\nMyself, I'm leery when a 25-year old career minor-leaguer is seen as the solution.\n87 Posted 07/07/2023 at 18:33:43\n88 Posted 07/07/2023 at 19:41:01\nFrank Lampard?\n89 Posted 07/07/2023 at 19:49:15\n90 Posted 07/07/2023 at 20:35:34\nEither way, no way a player in the championship turns down Sporting Lisbon for us.\n91 Posted 07/07/2023 at 21:17:50\nGyokeres isn't a great player by any stretch - but we're unlikely to sign a great player for striker competition for DCL. More like a player who will get 8 to 10 goals in Premier League. That sounds crap, but players like Isak and Nunez were in that category this season. Gyokeres would also be a decent (if unspectacular) all-round focal point for the attack. That said, I expect many fans would consider him crap for not banging them in left right and centre.\n92 Posted 07/07/2023 at 21:19:27\nGiven our injury record, it won't be long before the treatment room is full again. Patterson and DCL are currently injured and it's not clear if either will be available for the KO. A striker has been top of the wish list for a long time, why have we still not gotten one in?\nI'm not particularly sad to have let any of the players go that have gone, Mina aside if we could have signed him on much lower wages, but literally no one has been signed and we've saved a ton on the wage bill on those that have gone. Even if we don't have much money I would have hoped we'd at least have signed one or two on loan by now, perhaps with options to buy. The likes of Chelsea have tons of promising players who will likely never get a look-in with them. The near guarantee of first team football would have been a decent offer to put on the table, no? Even if the player doesn't fancy a permanent move now he would at least get playing time - like Lukaku.\nHere's hoping something happens as the weeks tick down. Given last summers last minute waste of £15m on Maupay, I'm not feeling confident.\n93 Posted 07/07/2023 at 21:53:56\nrising to £5m based on appearances and goals, and £8m if Coventry gain promotion to the Premiership\n94 Posted 07/07/2023 at 21:56:54\nSource please?\n95 Posted 07/07/2023 at 22:02:12\n96 Posted 07/07/2023 at 22:05:09\n97 Posted 07/07/2023 at 22:12:49\n98 Posted 07/07/2023 at 22:13:50\nThey claim: \"Coventry City have completed the signing of Everton striker Ellis Simms who joins the club as a replacement for star front man Viktor Gyokeres...\n\"Simms signed a four year contract at the CBS Arena after completing his medical at Ryton, joining for an undisclosed fee, which CoventryLive understands to be £3.5million rising to £5m depending on appearances and goals in a deal that could be worth up to £8m if City gain promotion to the Premier League.\"\nSource: EchoPrevious record signings for Coventry City, include:\n1 Wales Craig Bellamy Norwich City 17 August 2000 £6,500,000\n2 Republic of Ireland Robbie Keane Wolverhampton Wanderers 18 August 1999 £6,000,000\nObviously, a fee of £6m 23 years ago, is a lot more in today's money than the possible £8m that Everton may receive.\n99 Posted 07/07/2023 at 22:14:49\n\"Simms signed a four year contract at the CBS Arena after completing his medical at Ryton, joining for an undisclosed fee, which CoventryLive understands to be £3.5million rising to £5m depending on appearances and goals in a deal that could be worth up to £8m if City gain promotion to the Premier League.\"\nPretty specific to be just a SWAG.

McNeil, Garner and Onana are young players with their best years ahead of them. Garner was unlucky with injury or I say he would have played a bigger part.\nThe loan of Coady worked out okay, Tarkowski was our best defender! Mina was good when he played but Tarkowski played week-in & week-out, probably playing through the injuries Mina was getting stretchered off with! You can't be our best defender sitting in the stands with a sore fingernail, mate!\nWe are not Man City, Chelsea or Newcastle Utd with unlimited funds to splash around. The money we spend needs to be targeted in the right way at the right players. It's not about when we sign people â€” it's about who are them people!\nIt's not hard to see the players who are not contributing a massive amount will not be missed. Yes, we need players in. But the likes of Davies, Coady, Simms, Mina, Vinagre are hardly irreplaceable. Players who can make an impact on the first team is what we need.\nIf we can trade 7 or 8 players who don't really contribute much over a season for 3 who make a genuine positive impact on the first team, then bring it on.\nThe smell of dead wood is being lifted from Finch Farm. Embrace it!\n108 Posted 07/07/2023 at 23:06:54\nThanks\nIf it's really only £3.5M, then we need to employ a specific negotiator for outgoing transfers.\nThe kid could easily get 15+ goals in the Championship next season and the season after. That's definitely worth £12M - 15M given how transfers have been going.\nIt does make one wonder whether Everton are competent at anything??\n109 Posted 07/07/2023 at 23:12:35\nI am starting to believe though that our “lucky escapeâ€ might not turn out to be one. We've still got Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee in charge, and I fear lack of signings is an impasse from a complex investment situation. Moshiri isn't putting anything more in, so who will be??\nI think this season will all be about survival once again. West Ham won't be paying £60M for Onana and nobody is coming in for Pickford either. I think our best hope is a couple of signings on loan or the never-never.\nWe're at the stage now where our Iranian fool owner has bet it all on black â€“ stadium built and clear 3 years on P&S and an investor comes in and bails him out. The issue is, who's daft enough to come in and compete with Saudi money (direct like Newcastle and indirect like Chelsea)? If Man Utd go to the Sheikh, it'd be a fool who comes in and buys now just to finish 6th to 10th maybe.\nIf the bet fails, the most palatable and likely option then is the Rangers model. Keep the name, start againâ€¦ I suspect though that a fool stubborn enough to keep Bill in place this summer is a fool that'll spend 10 years thinking they can reverse it all.\n110 Posted 07/07/2023 at 23:36:11\nI think this year will all be about survival once again.\nKin'l... splitting the atom comes close but... respect!\n111 Posted 08/07/2023 at 01:36:11\nI just fear we've tied ourselves in knots at the top.

It helped keep us up.\n113 Posted 08/07/2023 at 06:08:27\nGood look to Simms, we've messed him around these last 2 seasons and he's kept a dignified silence and worked hard when he finally got on the pitch.\nI hope to see Godfrey, Branthwaite and Tarkowski as a back 3 and think James Garner and Onana will be more prolific and consistent. Onana is going to the top so keep him another year and sell for way more than what we will be offered now.\nThe crucial signing of a centre-forward is still yet to come!\n114 Posted 08/07/2023 at 06:15:50\nI tend to separate the team from the soap opera upstairs. But the frustration gets to us all.\nI will comment and be as critical as anyone in my own style about the absence of leadership and mismanagement of the club.\nHowever, come matchday, it's all about the team and I'll watch and support those 11 players on the pitch, just as I did last season. It's all I've ever done and, apart from a few glorious years, I've lived with near misses and false hope. It's all I know.\n115 Posted 08/07/2023 at 06:27:26\nForgot to mention also looking forward to seeing Cannon rejoin the squad as I think he will make an impact and knows where the net is!\n116 Posted 08/07/2023 at 07:00:06\nBrent, I can't commit to a season ticket, so I attend when I can (I also have MS so need to manage that).\nDanny, I 100% respect all regular match goers, and you imparticular due to the traveling that you commit to support Everton.\nTo everyone, I admit I was being melodramatic last night, I'd had a couple of Friday sherberts and I've just had it with Kenwright and his smugness. I've just a feeling (like many of us) that he ain't going anywhere. In reality, I couldn't stay away too long,\n117 Posted 08/07/2023 at 07:49:50\n“I will not watch Everton againâ€¦â€. I remember uttering the same words when we let Howard Kendall go to Birmingham City as part of the Bob Latchford deal!\nIt's a good job only my Dad heard those words (“Don't be so bloody daft, Sonâ€) and TW wasn't around at the time.\n118 Posted 08/07/2023 at 07:55:35\nFor us, it's simply staying up. That's success for us. Sadly that's it. The squad lacks goals and attracting real talent will be difficult. Our history over the past 25 years has been successful in staying in the top league.\nEverton is about survival and with our squad why anymore? Simply we have been very fortunate selling talent for big money and not replacing them. It's not the manager who will be at fault, just the lack of quality to go forward.\nHopefully a few players can be signed soon but I fear transfer deadline day will be the day. Remember, staying above the Bottom 3 is success next season.\n119 Posted 08/07/2023 at 07:58:43\nThe problem is that he was the best fit striker at the club.\nAny argument for selling him that involves investing the money raised in the squad doesn't account for what's happened in the past. We know what happens next.\nLast man out can turn the lights off.\n120 Posted 08/07/2023 at 08:11:28\nDennis (92) DCL and Patterson didn't look particularly injured to me in the back-to-training vids. Unless they've already been injured in the re-conditioning process.\n121 Posted 08/07/2023 at 08:11:43\nThere is no return for him. He is never going back to Goodison and will not grace BMD.\nAs I said on the Esk's own site and latest article, they've got rid of managers, they've sacked the board. Do they think that appeases the masses? That seems to have been their \"strategic\" approach.\nNo. It doesn't. Until he is gone, the pitchforks will remain out and the sentiment amongst the increasingly majority of supporters will not go away.\nBut, they don't have much room to manoeuvre now. The phrase I used is that the rats are cornered. Approaching the end of the runway, to coin a phrase used to describe our recent relegation fights.\nCome August Joe, we'll be there for the team. Be that in person, watching from home or those overseas at ridiculous hours.\nIt comes with uncertainty, but we are getting there with a fresh start, we just need that last leech removed. Definitions of leech:\n\"Bloodsucking parasites\" \"A person who extorts profit from or sponges on others. They are leeches feeding off the hard-working majority\"\nTerry @115, I saw Cannon briefly so would like to see a bit more of him. I think he came on against Norwich (don't quote me) and looked lively. I said last season, and I hope for this one coming, we see Lewis Warrington and Stanley Mills involved with the first team squad. I've watched more of those two.\nStick together Evertonians. It's the one thing that has kept us going during these past few seasons.\n122 Posted 08/07/2023 at 08:40:25\nMaybe I'm naive and just don't understand why it had to be the other three leaving, whilst Chairmen Bill stayed on, but I believe it's the people who believe he his staying on for the good of the club, who are the most naive?\nI hope I'm wrong because I also want to go to Goodison, but I've stated that I also won't be going into the ground if Kenwright stays, and I would love to see an empty Goodison, if the bastard remains, because if everyone stayed away, I'm certain this would be too much even, for the man who has no shame.\nI wouldn't expect this to happen but what a message it would send to certain parts of William's sycophantic media. The liar who has only stayed away for his own safety, actually forced one of the most passionate fanbase's in British football out the groundðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸\n123 Posted 08/07/2023 at 08:40:43\n124 Posted 08/07/2023 at 08:43:29\n125 Posted 08/07/2023 at 08:45:23\n126 Posted 08/07/2023 at 08:54:17\nOn a positive note, without any data science skills, if you search League One youngest Players, you get a list of players who have played professional football. These players at their age are way ahead most clubs academy players in terms of professional football level ability. Most players in our academy will be hoping to play in League One at 19/20 years old. So if we rated these players then you can say they are at a lower academy level because they player in a lower league. However if you rated these players at this age for their professional football level, they are higher than most of our academy players. There must be plenty of gems here to buy and send out on loan again as they are all professional football ready.\nIt does have a mish-mash of data, but you can see League One has a history of lots of 16/17/18 year olds who have played professional football and by this fact alone are many of the best young players in the English league. Some of these won't be with a top 8 Premier League club.\nhttps://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/league-one/juengsteaelteste/pokalwettbewerb/GB3\n127 Posted 08/07/2023 at 08:59:58\n128 Posted 08/07/2023 at 09:00:52\nWhen you look at the PL, it only appears to be the top six sides wheeling and dealing, with Arsenal making a big push to win the league.\nNothing seems to be happening with the sides that finished in the bottom 10.\nAre they all waiting for the cast offs from the top six ?\n129 Posted 08/07/2023 at 09:27:19\nSimms was popular at Sunderland but he rarely played a full game or had a long run in the side. I seem to remember there was some doubts about his ability to focus for any length of time. That might come with maturity though of course.\nGood luck to him anyway.\n130 Posted 08/07/2023 at 09:52:13\nWorrying though that there are no new signings yet. As others have said, the bottom 12 are probably all chasing the same players while the top teams gorge themselves on the best takings as they go about their asset stripping and stockpiling.\n131 Posted 08/07/2023 at 10:15:54\nSimms joined Sunderland on a season-long loan for the start of the 2022/23 campaign and went on to score an impressive seven goals plus two assists in just 17 league appearances before 31st December.\nThe reports I saw, said they had a deadly combination with Stewart, who banged in another 10 goals next to him, and were one of the best scoring pair in the Championship.\nHe's not Premier League quality, that's clear.

On the pitch we need to go back to basics and build a solid ahrd-working squad that'll give Dyche a chance to progress with the project he's started (and not kneejerk if there are setbacks). My belief/hope is that he can be the new Moyesiah - who also did an incredible job on a shoestring. I was really proud of those days tbh and never really worried about the KITAP1 approach.\nGenerally I'd much rather see us cemented back in the top 10 with 50-something points each year (or top 7 with 60+) than trying to play beautiful attacking football and flirting with relegation. Obviously it'd be great to have both (which to be fair some sides are managing), but results matter more right now.\nBehind the scenes we clearly need to balance the books to fend off FFP issues, but the moves we've been making (together with sales from last year) suggest we may be able to do that, which is precisely why I'm not getting overly agitated about the lack of transfer activity. I think we will buy a striker, possibly two in the summer and probably a couple more.\nMeanwhile, in the boardroom, we've already had a bit of a cull and I suspect BK will follow soon enough as most on here are desperate for once investment money comes in and/or they identify an option Moshiri believes to be credible.\nUltimately I've seen a little glory and a LOT of adversity in my c.40 years as a fan and I can say that this is far from the worst situation we've been in. Pre-Moshiri we were on the verge of bankruptcy for years, so I don't think our finances are anywhere near the nadir, we'd also been flirting with relegation regularly pre-Moyes under the likes of Walker and Smith, this was not the first 'last day escape'.\nPreviously we didn't have an owner who'd been able to invest (or find) money and we certainly didn't have a fabulous new stadium on the way. My ambitions aren't crazy: a top 10 finish, a little squad development and continued evolution to a more sensible way of running things off the pitch, but I do go into the season with some optimism... there'll be plenty of time for moaning later on!\n153 Posted 08/07/2023 at 19:24:43\n154 Posted 08/07/2023 at 19:30:34\n155 Posted 08/07/2023 at 20:09:18\nNot even close to being good enough to cut it in the Premier League though. I've seen milk turn quicker.\n156 Posted 08/07/2023 at 20:16:52\nI think if he was better playing with his back to goal, then Sean Dyche, would have probably kept him, but I think he's got a chance because he has got a turn of pace, so I definitely can't agree with your last statement, Jay!\n157 Posted 08/07/2023 at 20:23:35\n158 Posted 08/07/2023 at 21:14:41\nIf true, my opinion is this is a fucking unbelievable deal for Coventry and quite the opposite for us.\nI suppose we will never find out!\n159 Posted 08/07/2023 at 21:40:27\n160 Posted 08/07/2023 at 21:44:01\nAlthough I agree with your opinion.\n161 Posted 08/07/2023 at 23:47:05\nIt doesn't matter if he's a little better than Maupay if he's much easier to sell and ultimately fairly easily replaced in turn. Hopefully, if he can't improve, Maupay will end up being third- or even fourth-choice by the time the season starts.\n162 Posted 09/07/2023 at 06:35:09\nYes, I agree that this coming season is about survival and the transfer policy will appear up to the last minute as you described. But Moshiri does normally pull a surprise near the end of the transfer window. The reason only known to him, with mixed results.\nI don't know if you are aware of the Greater Fool theory, used to describe Trump's business dealing in the early 2000s. A fool buys a business and expects a greater fool to buy it off him at a huge profit. Any logical analysis of the situation is confounded by unknowns, pushing the limits, a myriad of borrowings, a legal quagmire and behind-the-scenes workings. In the world of Premier League football, fertile ground seems to be the order of the day for this theory.\n163 Posted 09/07/2023 at 10:47:29\nWe have to be patient and hope that Dyche and Thelwell can get a few players to impact the first team in exchange for those who are being sold or let go, that really are not having any impact over the course of a season. Just a small improvement to the team would see us easily safe imo.\nSome will never be happy.\nThey ask for deadwood to be sold or let go, and as soon as a few squad fringe players are gone & high earners who don't contribute enough they moan the sqauds too thin.\nChris I don't agree though about your take on our finances. Kenwright never tried to invest when he was in control. Never tried to maximise the potential we had when he had a really good manager in Moyes. We were not nearly bankrupt under him, he never spent any money, we were run on what the club generated. He didn't invest a penny himself.\nWe now find ourselves in the opposite situation where the 100s of millions moshiri has wasted has effected us worse. Where its left us without a pot to piss in. With sections hanging over us, ffp tying our hands in the transfer market, players not wanting to sign for us.\nFrom where we were when Mosiri took over to where we are now is how I look at it.\nWe were able to attract players like lukaku & Richarlison now we are looking at bargain bin signings to save our premier league status.\nIt's a million miles.\n164 Posted 09/07/2023 at 10:54:23\nI think he's only shown glimpses, but then was he given the chance? Did manager after after manager have the confidence in his ability?\nI guess now we'll never know.\nThat night was a great moment, but in general I was on the fence from what I've seen of him.\nTime will tell, but I wish him well.\nPlay football regularly. That is most important for his career development.\n165 Posted 09/07/2023 at 11:12:22\nI was never convinced either but like you I wish him well.\n166 Posted 09/07/2023 at 11:58:52\n167 Posted 09/07/2023 at 13:56:01\n168 Posted 10/07/2023 at 07:08:38\nI've heard he's sold for £4M plus addons if they get promoted etc.\nIf he wasn't our player, he seems the type if profile we would easily splash £10M on. Go figure?\nGood luck to the lad, I think he's made a lot of progress last season and will continue to improve.\n169 Posted 10/07/2023 at 10:28:15\nI don't where you're from or what your problem is but if you think someone saying they wouldn't expect a chairman to comment on transfer rumours means they support the chairman, you're either pissed, can't read, or are mental. Or a combination of all three.\nGo and have a lie down.\n170 Posted 10/07/2023 at 10:48:23\n171 Posted 10/07/2023 at 11:14:36\nWe have a fairly reasonable first team though our major goalscorer is a doubt to play every week, we have a poor bench though some of the young lads might become men.\nWe have the financial situation and the Profitability and Sustainability chasms to cross, it could mean a disastrous experience but who knows?\nWhat is very likely is that we are short of funds to buy expensive players but we might just get a goalscorer and a right winger. So I agree with you that there is one aim for us this season. That is to avoid relegation with the further hope that we are not dealt with harshly and we can get around mid-table.\nI think Dyche is planning for the worst but hoping for the best. I hope we back him and the squad next season like we did last season. I couldn't think of a more suitable manager for the situatrion we find ourselves in.\n172 Posted 10/07/2023 at 11:48:55\nIt was probably going to be Usmanov and Moshiri who had a vision of owning a Champions League club. Usmanov has now gone and it looks like Moshiri is going to put the debt on the club.\nIt's been reported he has said that EFC can't really afford the new stadium. If this happens, as it probably will, it will be a millstone around the neck for possibly decades. It may also prevent takeovers. The debt could be massive, possibly as much as £1.5 billion.\n173 Posted 10/07/2023 at 12:53:30\nWe do know what our finances are like, they are disastrous. We have been recording over £100 million losses each year for the past 4 years. Last year came down to £45 million because we sold Richarlison on the last day for £50 to £60 million.\nIf you want a complete breakdown read some of Paul the Esk's past articles.
