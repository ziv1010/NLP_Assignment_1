  "body_text": "Bethany England sends clear selection message to Sarina Wiegman with latest WSL goal\n- Bethany England scored for Tottenham in WSL clash with Man City\n- The 30-year-old set a new league record with the first half strike\n- England should be considered for this summer's Euro 2025 squad\nAs another major international tournament approaches, so too does one of football's most captivating discussions: squad selection.\nThis summer is set to be a significant one for Sarina Wiegman's Lionesses as they look to reassert themselves on the big stage. England are the reigning European champions following their triumph in 2022 and were World Cup finalists against Spain in 2023, narrowly falling short on that occasion.\nBut after a turbulent couple of years following that agonising night in Sydney, England head into this summer's Euros with a point to prove. They remain among the favourites to lift the trophy in Basel on 25 July, but the competition has arguably never been stronger.\nFor that reason, it is crucial Wiegman gets her squad selection right — something the Dutchwoman has a strong track record of doing. However, this year, there are plenty of question marks, with some players at risk of missing out through injury and several young talents on the fringes of the team.\nThe tide appeared to be turning in the last international breaks of 2024, as Wiegman integrated the likes of Jess Naz, Laura Blindkilde Brown, Ruby Mace, and Aggie Bever-Jones into the senior squad. Jess Park and Grace Clinton are slightly further along in their development, but it remains to be seen which emerging Wiegman will put her tournament trust in come July.\nThat being said, the last international break suggested Wiegman is not opposed to calling upon the old guard eiher. Nikita Parris earned a place in the squadl for the first time in over two years following a strong first half of the season with Brighton & Hove Albion. However, one player in excellent club form but still overlooked is Tottenham's Bethany England.\nThe 30-year-old has eight WSL goals this season, putting her level with Arsenal's Alessia Russo, England's undisputed starting No.9. It's also worth noting, those eight goals have come for a Spurs side outside the elite, proving she can perform even without the service of a title-challenging team.\nHer goal against Manchester City on Sunday surely caught the attention of Wiegman. With Spurs trailing at Brisbane Road, England's superb strike brought them level before half-time, although they were narrowly beaten 2-1 after 90 minutes.\nThat goal also rewrote the WSL record books, as England became the first player to score more than 25 goals in the competition for two different clubs, having previously hit big numbers at Chelsea.\nIn past tournaments, club form has earned England a place in the squad, albeit a back-up player in both 2022 and 2023, and at the very least deserves the chance to prove herself during the upcoming Nations League fixtures next month. Where she stands in the England pecking order is anyone's guess, but one of the WSL's in-form forwards should not be overlooked.\nEngland will need as much firepower as possible at Euro 2025 this summer, and squad depth, particularly off the bench, could be the difference between retaining their title or falling short.\nEngland, based on performances this season, should be at the forefront of the conversation.",
