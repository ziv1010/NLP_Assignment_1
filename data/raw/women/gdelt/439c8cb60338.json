And in January this year, it was announced that the match had been moved to Stadium Australia, the largest stadium in Sydney, due to a significant interest in tickets.\nRead more: Katie McCabe had to constantly prove herself to be taken seriously in football\nThe Girls in Green will then play Canada at the Perth Rectangular Stadium on July 26. And on July 31, they will play Nigeria at Lang Park in Brisbane.\nAnd Katie told Chic about qualifying for the tournament, recalling what was going through her mind in that moment.\nShe said, “‘Oh my god, I can’t believe it’. It was obviously quite a surreal moment — and the whole process of going through the play-offs, and it was just… it was a weird kind of play-off system, and the amount of games that we had to play for it was unknown to us.\n“But I think that to get the job done in Scotland, away from home and in hand against Scotland — the game, how it went with the penalty saves and how Amber scored the goal, it was just a pretty incredible feeling.”\nKatie said that it is “exciting” to have the World Cup get closer and closer, but, when we spoke, her sights were set on the friendlies that would set them up for the World Cup — including their send-off match against Zambia at Tallaght Stadium in Dublin last Thursday week, which they won 3-2 in a positive World Cup warm-up.\nThe footballer told how going to Australia for the first time will be “an experience in itself — and she also opened up about some of what she’s most looking forward to during the tournament.\nShe said, “It would have to be the opener against Australia, and it is Sydney. It’s in an 80,000-seater solid stadium — that’s just going to be a really big one to look forward to.\n“And obviously, having so much Irish support out there is going to be incredible, too. It is going to be nice to have all the Irish fans in the stadium, ready to cheer us on for the games.”\nKatie added that it will “be nice to have a home away from home” while they’re abroad.\nShe said, “I’m sure there will be a lot of friends and family coming out for the players selected to go to the World Cup.\n“Obviously, the main focus for us as players was to make sure that we got a seat on the plane — and then I’m sure everyone’s family will be ready to fly in and support the team.\n“It’ll be nice to have a home away from home when we’re in Sydney.”\nAnd with so many incredible moments in her career already, Katie opened up about some of her highlights so far.\nShe said, “I think that with Ireland qualifying for the World Cup for the first time ever — that’s probably the one memory that will never go away.\n“And with Arsenal, it was probably winning the League. I think that signing for Arsenal, my first professional contract, after watching them playing in the FA Cup Final as a 12-year-old — that was pretty cool.\n“But then winning the League was probably the biggest moment — and I will hopefully have more big moments with them to come.\"\nThe 27-year-old told how her love of football was something that had been there from a young age.\nShe said, “My love for football, it would have come from my dad and my older brothers. When I was younger, we used to play in the hallway — and I think that my dad could see that I could kick a ball.\n“There were these mini World Cup things that we used to have with our community football team, Kilnamanagh, and he signed me up. I was the only girl playing with a lot of the boys.\n“I think he saw very quickly that I had something about me, and I just wanted to keep going from there. I loved it from there on, and I signed up for the team.”\nKatie recalled the moment that led her to realise football was the career that she wanted to pursue.\nShe said, “There was a time when there was like, one game on TV-a-year. And it was the Women’s FA Cup Final. I wasn’t aware of it, but my dad had turned it on.\n“I think I was like 12 at the time. There were a lot of Irish players playing for Arsenal — I think it was Arsenal versus Everton — and I was like, ‘that’s pretty cool’.\n“They had so much support, as well. It was England and I just — I didn’t know it was available at the time, to even do that. Ever since then, I just thought, ‘that would be quite cool to do one day’.”\nThe Dubliner opened up about some of the people who have inspired her throughout her career, and how there have been “different people who’ve inspired me in different stages of my career”.\nShe explained, “Thinking about the start of my career, my inspiration would have been my brother, my parents — my family have always been with me through my career and the journey of playing away from home.\n“But there’s also important players — Gemma Byrne, Fara Williams — and there’s been a lot of people around me who have supported me through the good and bad moments throughout my career.\n“The friends that I’ve made along the way are pretty incredible — and the reason to play sport, I guess.”\nKatie told how she feels fortunate “to be in the position that I am” and how important it is to her that she uses her platform in a positive way.\nShe continued, “When I set out to play football, it was more so to enjoy it and be the best that I can be at it.\n“But with the position I’m in now, and having young girls looking up to me, I think that it’s important to use my platform in a positive way; to encourage girls to join local teams, play football, make friends and enjoy it.\n“I am fortunate enough to be in the position that I am, and hope that I can help influence that in a positive way.”\nKatie also opened up about some of the hurdles that face young girls when it comes to sports — noting that while it has gotten better “especially within Ireland” it is important to “keep driving it the best way that we can”.\nShe said, “It can be a number of things. And I think one of the things, when it comes to football, was the accessibility and visibility.\n“It wasn’t visible to me, that I could be a footballer, when I was a young girl growing up. I think it’s important (to change that) — and it has gotten a lot better, especially within Ireland.\n“Where I live in England, you see women’s footballers on billboards, posters and things like that — you make it visible for young girls, who are able to see that.\n“And I think that that’s part of why I wanted to work with a brand like Cadbury’s, as well — the work that they do with the senior women’s team and kind of drive the awareness of the game and encourage that participation through what they do. It’s an important thing to do — and I think that we need to keep driving it the best way that we can.”\nREAD MORE: Ireland footballer James McClean's marriage to wife, autism diagnosis and anti-Irish abuseREAD MORE: Liam Brady leaves RTÉ Sport after 25 years on screen \"I’m going to miss the guys\"Katie was speaking as part of the Supporter & A Half campaign, which has supported women in football — from the grassroots of the sport to the senior level — since Cadbury’s partnership with the FAI began in 2021.\nThe partnership drives awareness of the game and encourages participation in the sport, with 30 clubs having benefitted from the support so far.\nAnd Katie told how it was a “no brainer” for her to work with them as an ambassador this year.\nShe said, “When I work with brands, it’s really important for me to know the values of the company.\n“When Cadbury came in initially and wanted to work together, it was a no-brainer because of what they wanted to do and how they wanted to partner with the FAI.\n“And like I said, it’s obviously fundamentally to promote grassroots football to women. That’s something that I’m passionate about because of the time that I had with Raheny United, which was the senior women’s team at the time.\n“I was only 16.\n“And look, our facilities weren’t great at the time, and our training kits — Cadbury are using an important campaign to help better that.\n“It was just a no-brainer for me to start working with them.”\nEarlier this year, Cadbury’s Supporter & A Half campaign launched the FAI Cadbury Kick Fit initiative.\nThe programme focuses on 20 grassroots clubs around the country and aims to raise awareness and encourage participation in senior women’s football — with the goal of encouraging 600 women to take part in the programme.\nThe initiative — which is described as a fun, non-competitive social programme for women — runs for eight weeks over the summer. The goal is to keep fit and create a social club, while also encouraging the recruitment of coaches and players to clubs.\nEach club is managing the initiative, while being supported by FAI Development Officers and FAI Women’s Football Programme Coordinators.\nAnd Katie opened up about how important it is to have local communities involved in grassroots football clubs.\nShe said, “For me, in the local community and the football club that I had, we had a lot of volunteers around the club doing stuff of the importance of making sure that kids could play football.\n“I think that having those sort of people in the community is really important. And, obviously, it helps the clubs around Ireland — in rural Ireland, as well, not just in Dublin — to have people involved with the clubs; to keep people interested and keep kids interested, most importantly.”\nPeople around the country can become a Supporter & A Half and support grassroots clubs by purchasing a Cadbury product and help teams to recruit coaches, players, volunteers and club stalwarts.\nEight grassroots clubs — one from each FAI region, who are registered with the FAI Club Mark programme with a senior women’s team — will be randomly selected to win direct support.\nThe prize includes advertising, media and PR to the value of џ3,000 per club to run a recruitment drive in their area and help grow their women’s teams for the future.
