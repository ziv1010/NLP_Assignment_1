  "body_text": "Written By:\n- Date published:\n8:48 am, August 18th, 2023 - 103 comments\nCategories: act, Carmel Sepuloni, Christopher Luxon, david seymour, national, Pacific, uncategorized, you couldn't make this shit up -\nTags:\nI get the feeling that David Seymour has decided to model himself on Winston Peters.\nPeters has made a career of saying really outlandish news worthy quotes and getting publicity for them. It appears that Seymour is attempting to do the same.\nIt is one of the features of MMP and the way that some minor parties behave that they can say something that 90% of the population disagrees with and only 10% agree with but this is a win. 10% of the votes in an MMP election gets you a lot of seats in Parliament.\nAnd Seymour and Act have been cultivating the red neck racist vote with a passion recently.\nYesterday he hit a new low, when he hinted at the Ministry of Pacific Peoples should be blown up.\nin my fantasy we’d send a guy called Guy Fawkes in [to the ministry] and it’d be all over”.\nThis is terrifingly Trumpian. The Orange buffoon often says the most outlandish things and the problem is that some of his goons will then go out and try and do what he has hinted at.\nNational Leader Christopher Luxon has attempted to distance himself from Seymour’s outburst. Sort of.\n“I don’t agree with that, right?” said Luxon when the comments were raised by an audience member at [a recent] meeting. “The point is I’m not the leader of the Act Party, I’m the leader of the National Party … Don’t imbue me with comments from him.”\nHe may be the leader of a different party but those parties are joined at the hip. National has had Act on life support for a long period of time just so it could maximise the right’s representation in Parliament.\nAnd they have the same donors. My standards are very low when it comes to Luxon but I expected him to say something stronger than what he did say.\nCarmel Sepuloni and Golriz Ghahraman have responded in a more direct manner than Luxon was able to. From Newshub:\nDeputy Prime Minister Carmel Sepuloni said the comments were unnecessary.\n“This is so typical of David Seymour, particularly with Pasifika and Māori, just constantly race baiting and causing division where it doesn’t need to happen,” she said.\nGovernment agencies representing certain groups in society are there because “clearly inequities still exist”.\nSepuloni argued representative agencies are “really important.”\nGreen Party MP Golriz Ghahraman also took a swipe at Seymour.\n“Just a man who received donations from known white supremacists making a ‘joke’ about his fantasy to bomb brown people institutions,” she tweeted.\nI am confident that this will blow up in Seymour’s face. This sort of violent base rhetoric should cost.\nI can sense the good people of South and West Auckland and Porirua of Pacific background stirring and getting ready to vote. In seeking to court the racist vote this time Seymour has overstepped the mark.\n- Comments are now closed\n-\nSeymour will Benefot Cost Ratio most of government into ash if they allow him a cost-cutting program to afford a tax cut by eradicating multiple public institutions.\n4 months of public glee followed by horror.\n-\nNasty, twisted little man. Takes such glee fantasising how many thousands of people he will make redundant.\n-\nSeymour nailed it.\nDont take issue with what he said. Try and understand what he was saying.\nBureaucrats are sucking tbe tax paying productive workers of nz dry…. While they have their saftey \"jobs\"\n-\nSeymour Butt is a horrible little creep closely related to Roger the Rat.\n-\n-\n-\nGreen Party MP Golriz Ghahraman also took a swipe at Seymour.\n“Just a man who received donations from known white supremacists making a ‘joke’ about his fantasy to bomb brown people institutions,” she tweeted.\nIMO : A fantasy…..of a dangerous man.\nNAct and Winston Fist…..a fucking nightmare. Why we must win.\nNZ wont survive those slime…..\n-\nMr Seymour’s motley crew want to swing a wrecking ball through many if not all of Labour/Greens incremental reforms since 2017. It will affect the “doing it hard” bottom 50% immediately with attacks on minimum wage, Living wage, FPAs, PPL, Māori Seats, Tiriti o Waitangi, hard won Union/workers rights and much more.\nAct would have been long gone but for the Natzos loyal support in Epsom electorate.\nDon’t forget NZ National ignored the last MMP review regarding lowering the threshold, so they know well the “coat tailing” implications of their assisting Act.Media channels have largely given Act a free run and their dodgy MPs like warm gun lover Nicole McKee unbothered by scrutiny.\nNatzos should be hounded on this one, as should Mr Seymour. More voters need to know what Act really means. Guyfawkes?–what a wanker.\nGloriz got it right…“Just a man who received donations from known white supremacists making a ‘joke’ about his fantasy to bomb brown people institutions,”\n-\n\"Media channels have largely given Act a free run….\"\nHave they ever! Every day without fail on TV1 6pm news, Seymour pops up with some utterly inane comment about something the PM or a minister has said. It is as if the moment a govt. minister dares to open their mouth, the media rush to the pipsqueak for a response.\n-\nA lot of senior journalists are getting on a bit and haven't moved on from being Roger Douglas's cheerleaders, and the rest only see politics through the lens of the horserace where Seymour offers a reliable one liner for clickbait.\n-\nSeymour Butt is a child protege of Roger The Rat and Richard Dick Preeble. He is trying to outdo the Racist Little Prick Winston Peters of NZF???\nNiether Seymour not Winston Peters are practicing Maori’s Winston is more aligned to his Italian and Scottish Roots, than his Indigenous Blue Tongue Roots here in NZ. IMHO\n-\n-\n-\nIm 70 years old. This labour government is the worst government in my life time.\nThe labour party kept printing money and this caused inflation.\nOnce again the productive tax paying workers in nz are paying the price. I for one have no work because people have stopped spending money.\nPeople who support labour and the greens are politicaly nieve\nTbere is no incentive to be a productive worker in nz because so many Bureaucrats are on the pigs back taking advantage of productive tax paying workers.\nSocialism has never worked and kills a lot of people.\n-\nYou're 70 years of age and you can barely make a cogent argument.\nBack to school …\nModern nation state governments in the OECD, do not print money. They have an internal currency overseen by a Reserve Bank.\nWhen they have a budget deficit they borrow money to fund it. Treasury usually organises that here.\nRecently, a new development has come into play – QE (which can be called printing money – well sort of, because it is only temporary and has a redress – called buy back) applied in some nations after the GFC. This was because of a crisis in the money markets.\nThe New Zealand RB did this between March 2020 and July 2021.\nIn 2022 the RB announced a plan to wind down the QE over 5 years – selling $5B pa to Treasury.\nThe QE during the GFC did not cause inflation.\nThe QE here and the delay to return to deposit criteria caused house price inflation in 2021. The pandemic, border lockdowns (here and globally), disruption to the global supply change (pandemic/isolation of China/the Ukraine war and sanctions) and local weather events (here) caused the rest of the inflation.\nIt is still lower in New Zealand than the OECD average. As is our debt.\nTbere is no incentive to be a productive worker in nz because so many Bureaucrats are on the pigs back taking advantage of productive tax paying workers.\nThe real problem is the lack of contribution from those making tax free capital gains and the consequent over-taxation of workers and or under-funding of public services. Ignoring the first and acting on the second just results in under funding of public services – such as aged care (don't worry the nice David Seymour will allow you a way out of suffering …).\nYour'e 70 and display no concern about global warming and the de-spoiling of our environment (waterways) … have learnt not so much.\n-\nwell put SPC is all I can say!\n-\nLabour party over spending in unproductive areas has caused inflation and paying people to stay at home.\nThe way to decrease inflation is o put people out of work by raising interest rates.\nThats what the reserve bank does.\nWho cares about the productive worker.\nNz is broke thats why services are under funded.\nYes good idea tax the shit out of productive people so that they leave the country close down their business and stop employing people.\nMaybe we should all be bureaucrates\nGovernments have tried for years to control inflation eventually they always fail.\nNow governments and greenies are taking on nature… Good luck on that to\nChina has about 6,500,000 million cows and over 1000 coal fired power stations\nWhen cbina. India and russia.. To name a few take global warming seriously then i will.\n-\nLabour party over spending in unproductive areas has caused inflation and paying people to stay at home.\nThen why did inflation not occur, until it did at higher rates overseas? And most people paid while at home are on the pension.\nGovernments have tried for years to control inflation eventually they always fail.\nThere had been little inflation in OECD nations for most of the century (not so much since the 1980's).\nNations that have a CGT and estate taxation have better funded public services, go figure.\n-\n-\nI take issue with this.-'The QE during the GFC did not cause inflation.'\nHow could it..not?It stimulates spending,distorts real,market risk and pricing.\n' the world’s leading central banks, including the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank, and the Bank of England, have injected more than $25 trillion into the global economy since 2008, with more than $9 trillion of that amount coming from COVID-19 alone, according to the Atlantic Council’s Quantitative Easing tracker.'\nMajor central banks have printed $25 trillion since 2008, data shows (finbold.com)\n-\nThen go and look at the inflation figures for the nations that applied it during the GFC and see what you find.\nWhere was the inflation before the pandemic?\n-\nSurely an expansion in credit availability ,incentivises banks to make loans and get people spending.\nThere seems an obvious correlation between Q.E and the explosion of property prices around the world.\nThen interest rates had to be lowered to make these huge mortgages 'affordable'.\n' It is important to realize that QE was an emergency measure used to stimulate the economy and prevent it from tumbling into a deflationary spiral.'\nThe counter to deflation=inflation.How it is measured and monitored is a telling factor.The effects will be felt for quite sometime imo.\nWhy Didn't Quantitative Easing Lead to Hyperinflation? (investopedia.com)\n-\nYou've now answered your own question, there was no inflation because of QE after the GFC because it merely countered a recession/deflationary spiral.\nThen interest rates had to be lowered to make these huge mortgages 'affordable'\nNo, low interest rates made larger mortgages affordable so people could afford to pay more for property (allowing those with debts to sell).\nQE did not cause tradeables inflation (pandemic disruption to the global supply chain and division against China, lockdowns loss of labour availability, sanctions Ukraine war and weather events did that).\nThe consequence of QE largess is the buy back phase – higher interest rates, then property prices fall back to smaller mortgage affordability levels and otherwise population and market supply.\n-\n'\nThen interest rates had to be lowered to make these huge mortgages 'affordable'\nNo, low interest rates made larger mortgages affordable so people could afford to pay more for property (allowing those with debts to sell).\nVery good!\n'higher interest rates, then property prices fall back to smaller mortgage affordability levels '\nYou may not be aware, but central banks all over the globe are raising interest rates to combat inflation.\nThis is where the inflation went-'There seems an obvious correlation between Q.E and the explosion of property prices around the world.\n–The CPI measures inflation of owner-occupied housing by measuring price change for the purchase of new housing. The 'purchase' consists of the price of buying a newly built house, excluding the land the house is built on.'\nCan't accept your version at all.\n-\nThere seems an obvious correlation between Q.E and the explosion of property prices around the world\nYes. But it did not cause any inflation rise, then or now because property value change it is not measured in the inflation statistics.\nbut central banks all over the globe are raising interest rates to combat inflation.\nYes, but the cause of this inflation is not rising property value – which is not a component. But tradeables.\n–The CPI measures inflation of owner-occupied housing by measuring price change for the purchase of new housing. The 'purchase' consists of the price of buying a newly built house, excluding the land the house is built on.'\nStrange definition as it’s more accurately the cost of building not cost of buying (the difference might be the builders finance costs) and the price of new build housing is the same whether it is owner occupied, or built for rent. Only the rising cost of building is determined – based on tradeables such as gib board, other building material and labour factors.\nThus the rising or falling value of market property (because of GE or interest rate whatever) is not in any way involved.\n-\nstrange definition is it!-How housing costs are measured in consumer price indexes at Stats NZ | Stats NZ\nYou seem to have veered off course.\nI'm saying Q.E lead to property inflation.\nIt's been bubbling away for years and has now spilled over.\nDo not accept your argument at all-'Thus the rising or falling value of market property (because of GE or interest rate whatever) is not in any way involved.'\nYour correlations are inconsistent and unreliable.\n-\nYou've consistently conflated property value inflation with the CPI inflation that RB's have responded to. The CPI does not measure property value change (investment/land value changes only cost of new building).\nThe strange definition is used – because they assess/measure the annual difference by what those building the new houses charge to buy them (the variable between cost of building and selling is cost of their finance, or the mark up they are trying to realise). It's messy because sometimes people pre-buy and sometimes builders go bankrupt if prices rise while building etc.\nPS For mine, I think you are way out of your depth on these topics.\n-\n'PS For mine, I think you are way out of your depth on these topics.'\nToo funny…you contradict yourself continually.\nHere educate yourself,try not to cherry pick segments…in your world inflation is transitory and CPI is the only measure.\n'What Causes Inflation? (investopedia.com)\n-\nRB's respond to CPI inflation. There had been little CPI inflation between 1990 and 2020. Property value inflation is not the cause of the rise CPI inflation of late, despite your beliefs.\n-\nComprehension required.\nCPI is not the the gold standard of measuring inflation imo and distorts it.\nI suppose you believed in 'trickle down 'theory …too.\n-\nIf you believe that QE leads to property inflation, and want to convince others to also believe … .\nConsider providing at least some evidence of the correlation between QE in a nation and the level of property value change in that nation.\nShow a consistent pattern between the various nations QE and the property value change.\nCoz it ain't that simple\nCPI is not the the gold standard of measuring inflation imo and distorts it.\nMeh. You earlier stated\nYou may not be aware, but central banks all over the globe are raising interest rates to combat inflation.\nThis in response to a rise in the CPI which does not measure property value change.\n-\n'Yes. But it did not cause any inflation rise, then or now because property value change it is not measured in the inflation statistics.'\nUnbelievable …so cause and effect is not relevant if x,y or Z measure is applied.\nHopeless.\n-\nIt may have escaped your notice that nations with the highest rates of inflation never applied QE. And those that did, include some with the lowest levels of property value increase.\nSo I can understand your reluctance to make any effort to prove your claims/evidence drought.\n-\n'It may have escaped your notice that nations with the highest rates of inflation never applied QE'\nMaybe, but I doubt Zimbabwe is a valid comparison for…your argument.\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nYou do understand that the pension is socialism??\n-\n-\n-\nHi David – there is a place for violent, private fantasies. It's called 4chan. If you go there, at least we will have some comfort from the fact that the intelligence services are more likely to be monitoring you. Thanks.\n-\nWhy is David Seymore saying such obvious racist rubbish.??? .. So Seymore can …\nget a bigger Headline than Winston.\ntell all brown people \"you are the problem\"\nappeal to the \"make NZ ungovernable\" group.\nWhat is alarming to me, Luxon did not say \"We will be keeping the Ministry of Pacific People\", (so is David Seymore hinting at an agreed list of targets for removal?)\nAll Luxon did say was he did not agree \"with that\" *(comment)? *(Policy)?\nWe are left wondering……. Making annoyed noises is not a statement of Nat intent.\n-\nSeymour Butt and the Drunken Dwarf both chasing the Red Neck Votes.\n-\n-\n-\n-\nSpam eh? Probably where it belonged. All good\n-\n-\n-\nOn cue, Seymour's words have consequences:\nThe media need to hold him to acount.\n-\n\"On cue, Seymour's words have consequences:\"\nfrom your link:The incident happened before ACT Leader David Seymour joked in a radio interview that he would like to see the ministry blown up.\n\"Green Party MP Golriz Ghahraman also took a swipe at Seymour.\n“Just a man who received donations from known white supremacists making a ‘joke’ about his fantasy to bomb brown people institutions,” she tweeted.What evidence of these donors does she has to make such an statement …\n-\nACT Party leader David Seymour has come under fire after accepting a donation from a far-right extremist and characterising the man's threats to destroy mosques as \"a silly comment on Facebook\".\nIn October, Newsroom reported that a far-right extremist who had threatened to \"destroy mosque after mosque till I am taken out\" had made a donation to the ACT Party by auctioning a hat signed by Seymour.\nMike Allen is a Christchurch e-bike salesman whose parody Trump hats – which read \"Make Ardern Go Away\" – went viral after he was temporarily banned from selling them on TradeMe. Newsroom then reported that the proceeds from the hats went towards funding advertisements for far-right Facebook pages, including the now-deleted page on which Allen threatened to destroy mosques.\nhttps://www.newsroom.co.nz/calls-for-act-to-return-far-right-donation\n-\nso no white supremacists then, but just one (1)\none learns to take comments from a left-wing extremist politician with a grain of salt.\n-\nOnes one to many ya sad git\n-\nWell that explains your comments history.\n-\n-\n-\n-\nThe media need to hold him to account.\nIt's much more likely that Newshub/ZB/NZ Herald will be intent on amplifying Seymour's dogwhistle rather than questioning it. It would not be surprising if the two guys who turned up uninvited at the Ministry were actually 'reporters' from one of those esteemed organs of the 4th estate.\n-\n\"The media need to hold him to account\".\nNot likely.\nThe MSM love his superficially witty quips and smug smirks\nWhen they see him its like going up to a comedian and asking him to say something funny, and he usually gives them what they want.\nThey aren't going to give that up willingly.\nSeymour is turning into Winston's successor, populism on the hoof, promising whatever looks good at the moment – fixing potholes, higher speed limits for the petrolheads.\nWhat people don't realise is that the extra money they will have in their pockets after ACT's tax cuts will disappear just as fast as they got it with the inevitable rise in inflation with all the extra money being spent and the higher charges for government services which will be quietly introduced to pay for their promises.\nPeople need to remember what we had when ACT's predecessors in the Rogernome government were in power in the late 80s – home lending rates and inflation around 16%, and it will happen again.\nIf people think inflation and home lending rates are high now, they ain't seen nothing yet.\n-\n-\nThey'll be two ACT/TPU henchmen pursuing the narrative Seymour has been promoting.\nIt’s not coincidence, Seymour is directly responsible for this.\n-\nFrom the link:\nDavid Seymour told Stuff on Friday he does not resile from the comment because to do so would be to give currency to the idea he was being serious.\n“Anybody who’s trying to link the incident to my very obvious joke is politicising the matter for political purposes and that’s part of the problem\n1) Who was dog whistling for political gain? He was.\n2) So it was just a joke eh? Makes no difference. The racist inference is there.\nDear God, save us from this awful dork!\n-\nOnly racists make such \"jokes\". It is the classic out to say “just joking ”\nWho was Seymour sharing the \"joke\" with? Hoskins and his listeners?\nIf he did not \"mean\" it, why did he say it?\nHe is behaving like a total lying creep who is now blaming the victims of his racism as \"not knowing it was a joke\".\nSadly, an overspend, (paid back), has been used to lambast that Ministry, and give Seymore room to grandstand to his followers.\nThis is a sick faction he is attracting.\n-\nIt isn't just racism as such in my view. It represents the ignorant viewpoint of the red-necked among us who think they are superior to the Pacific communities on the basis their skin is brown. That means it is okay to make them the butt of humiliating jokes which is exactly what Seymour was doing… using a mistake made by someone in the Pacific ministry.\nI noted in the Herald's letter to the editor section that the current 'question' being asked of readers is \"why is Carmel Sepuloni so under-rated.\" The answer is simple. She is a woman of South Pacific origin. In short, she has a brown skin. No matter her impressive credentials and qualifications etc. “she’s bro-owwn”\n-\n-\nDick,dick, and dick IMHO.\n-\n-\n-\n\"I am confident that this will blow up in Seymour’s face. This sort of violent base rhetoric should cost.\nWish I was as optimistic as you,\n-\nWho could possibly say what you have just quoted and expect to be taken seriously?\n\"this will blow up in Seymour’s face.\"\nThat can only be taken as calling on someone to bomb Seymour surely? A call to blow him up is at least as deplorable as his own remark.\n-\nLOL ..Thanks Alwyn you made me snort my afternoon cup of tea over the keyboard.\n-\n“I don’t agree with that, right?” said Luxon when the comments were raised by an audience member at [a recent] meeting. “The point is I’m not the leader of the Act Party, I’m the leader of the National Party … Don’t imbue me with comments from him.”\n-\nGave me a chuckle too!\n-\n-\nblow up in someone's face\nidiom. informal. (of an action, plan, etc.) to go wrong in a way that harms or damages the person who did the action, made the plan, etc.: The risk with making such a promise is it could blow up in your face later.\nLearn to comprehend before rushing to throw shit at others.\n-\nAlwhinge comprehends, and loves throwing shit at others – \"senior/toddler phase\"?\n-\n-\n-\nRace baiting does not work in NZ everyone will remember Winston Peters famous line “Two Wongs Don’t Make a White” and is rhetoric about abolishing the Maori Seats has seen his share of the Maori Seats from 42% to nearly zero.\n-\n-\nSeymour says it because he knows his redneck supporters will be all aboard with it.\n-\nIf you are right then that marks a significant change in the ACT support base, because up until now at least, ACT has pitched itself as a social libertarian party. They have been socially quite liberal and although you could accuse ACT supporters of being overly obsessed by wealth and gain you couldn't really accuse them of being lynch mob or conspiracy theorist.\nIf they are starting to pander to rednecks it is a new development, and one that will inevitably lead to battles with NZ First as the two parties vie for the position as default redneck party.\n-\n-\nDavid Seymour told Newstalk ZB on Thursday he would keep his pledge to abolish the Ministry of Pacific Peoples.\n\"In my fantasy, we'd send a guy called Guy Fawkes in there and it'd be all over, but we'll probably have to have a more formal approach than that.\"\nGuy Fawkes was an English soldier who attempted to blow up Westminster Palace in London in 1605.\nA telling comment – the Waitangi Tribunal, Human Rights Commission, Ministry of Pacific Peoples, Maori Health Authority – and a re-write of the TOW.\nHis NACT government is a return to 1950's assimilation polity, our version of little England Brexit retreat from modern society, sans the 1935 Labour government – with full blown neo-liberalism: PLUTOCRACY (more wealthy New Zealanders and a regime based around serving the interests of those with capital).\n-\nGotta wonder if national a regretting taking in the little lap dog now it's turning into a mangy rabid mutt.\n-\nHe ia a little is mangy flea ridden mongrel\n-\n-\nRemembered a question from a recent episode of \"The Chase\".\nQ:Who has been termed as the only person to have entered the (British) parliament with honest intentions:\nA: Guy Fawkes.\n-\nA bit of a dupe, I suspect. The plot was not to kill, but to imply risk to a whole ruling class if their King remained a Protestant (the Catholics had no other candidate for the Crown – in France they assassinated one Protestant King and then had his Protestant successor convert for fear of the same).\n-\n-\n-\nWon't anyone think of the children ?\nWhat a humourless country NZ has become.\n-\nGrown ups will think of the Riechstag.\n-\nJust jokes aye? You wouldnt think there had already been a massacre of brown people..in a NZ Mosque. By a white supremacist. Well..you wouldnt.\n-\n\"It's just banter,\" defence. Problem for this little oink is that he asks for serious discussion about the public service while acting in the most childish way possible. People then see he's not serious about the discussion at all.\nSeymour said the \"joke\" surrounding Government departments is met with those attending saying \"'hahah'.\"\n\"Then we talk about serious stuff about how you actually restructure the public service. Unfortunately, now you can't have the joke and you can't have the serious discussion.\"\nSeymour relies heavily on these quips and one liners as part of his political style. They’re part of his armoury and important to his image and popularity so if he wants to use them to his advantage, his opponents should be able to use them to his disadvantage.\nWhen he makes a mistake he should own it and the media and public should show no mercy.\n-\nDon't you mean \"little oik\" not \" little oink\"?\n-\n-\nLooks like Seymour and ACT are going full on Nazi to secure the right wing red neck vote ???😇☺️🥹😡🥲🤣\n-\n-\nHe may be trying to emulate Winstons public persona but Winston on a good day has a charm, charisma and sense of humour that are impossible to fake.\nSeymour always comes off as an edgy head boy perfect with limited life experiences.\nWinston love him or hate him, is a rockstar, we don't call him Winston Peters we call him Winston.\nLove him or hate him (I love him and hate him) we'll be talking about Winston in a century.\nSeymour and Acts party support will drop like a led balloon if they ever make it to a coalition with national, a lot of people voting don't realise Act is a neoliberal, open borders, free trade party they think act is a populist protectionist party.\nAs for Luxon saying \"I don't agree with that, right?\" That sounds like he's asking his campaign team \"is that our position\"\nWeak and pathetic. He makes Jeb Bush look charismatic\n-\nI see his mother died of cancer aged 50. Blessed relief for her to not have to witness the evil spectre her son has become.\n-\nReading through all the horrible comments, including insulting David's mother, it's clear that Labour supporters are struggling with themselves. They all behave like the type of people they say they don't like. Nothing left in the tank.\nLike it or not, there's a new government in 56 days. They won't be perfect, but at least we'll stop dismantling democracy, stop with the endless money printing, and maybe actually get something done for the first time in six years.\n-\nIt's a reaction to David Seymour's disgraceful abuse of his position. Holding a mirror to dangerous behaviour, and you don’t like it, right?\nAs for David Seymour, I blame the parenting.\n-\nSeymour is too busy playing with his sausage.\n-\n-\nWhere do you get your fact free drivel?\nNew Zealand began QE in March 2020 and it ended in July 2021.\nIn 2022 the RB announced a plan to wind down the QE over 5 years – selling $5B pa to Treasury.\nDismantling democracy … dancing cossacks, kiwi or iwi – each decade a new bunch of \"high school diploma\" inbreds … Muldoon Brash Seymour embarrassing.\n-\nMoney printing? What money printing? Making up tall stories to suit what you want to believe? I haven't read any \"horrible\" comments. Just people telling it as it is whether you like it or not.\nAs for the comment \"insulting David's mother\". What an over the top response to a fairly benign statement \"I blame his parents\". I think it might also be true.\n-\n-\nSeymour is too busy playing with his sausage. It is going to be a real bun fight the next 8 weeks hope you have all stocked up on plenty of popcorn???\n-\n-\nGeof, it is not Labour supporters wanting to end human and workers' rights. Nat/Act will do away with most structures which support our democracy.\nThey intend to rule for the rich, by taking huge quantities of tax for themselves and we will get crumbs not bread and butter.\nIt will be back to user pays and laws of the jungle. You wonder at our sadness. We see the \"system\" is so engrained, of class and wealth, that like lemmings we are rushing to a bad end. David Seymour is an example of that clique of self interest.\n-\n-\nCheers Barfly, we were in this position in 2017… many a slip\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nI've made a big investment in you, Peter. Time and money, and it's not working. Now, I could just shake my head and smile. But in my house, when a turd appears …\nLet me tell you what justice is. Justice is the law, and the law is man's feeble attempt to set down the principles of modesty, decency. It isn't an angle, or a contract, or a hustle! Decency is what your grandmother taught you. It's in your bones! Now you go home. Go home and be decent people. Be decent.\nhttps://www.moviequotes.com/s-movie/the-bonfire-of-the-vanities/\nThe King's Men was the acting company to which William Shakespeare (1564–1616) belonged for most of his career. Formerly known as the Lord Chamberlain's Men during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, they became the King's Men in 1603 when King James I ascended the throne and became the company's patron.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Men_(playing_company)\nIt was November, 1605, and high treason was on the mind of every English subject. A small group of angry Catholics, fed up with ongoing persecution at the hands of the Protestant monarchy, hatched an elaborate plot to blow King James I and his government to smithereens. As luck would have it, a warning letter surfaced at the last minute and James ordered a search of his Palace. The most notorious conspirator, Guy Fawkes, was discovered in the cellar, match in hand, ready to ignite twenty barrels of gunpowder \"all at one thunderclap.\"\nTo say that Shakespeare would have been familiar with the conspirators is an understatement. These traitors of the realm had some deep connections to Shakespeare and his family. Shakespeare's father, John (undoubtedly a covert Catholic) was friends with William Catesby, the father of the head conspirator, Robert Catesby. John Shakespeare and William Catesby shared illegal Catholic writings that eventually wound up in the attic of John's home in Stratford. Moreover, the Mermaid Tavern in London, frequented by Shakespeare and owned by his closest friend and confident, was a preferred meeting spot of the turncoats as they schemed to obliterate the Protestants once and for all.\nAnd so on to MacBeth 1606.\nA master of details, Shakespeare wove direct references to the Gunpowder plot right into Macbeth. To commemorate the discovery of the heinous scheme, King James had a medal created picturing a snake hiding amongst flowers. Lo and behold, we find a nod to the medal right in the play when Lady Macbeth tells her husband to look like the innocent flower, but be the serpent under it. Even more significant is an obvious allusion to a Jesuit priest named Father Henry Garnet, who had concealed his knowledge of the conspiracy. When Father Garnet finally confessed, he insisted that his previous perjury was not really perjury because he lied for God’s sake. For this bit of spin doctoring he became known as the great “equivocator” and was promptly hanged. Sure enough, in Act 2, when Macbeth’s Porter wonders what kind of people would enter the gates of hell, he declares:\nFaith, here’s an equivocator, that could swear in both the scales against either scale; who committed treason enough for God’s sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven. O, come in, equivocator. (3.2.9-12).\nhttp://www.shakespeare-online.com/biography/gunpowderplot.html\n-\nThanks SPC. I had studied Shakespeare at University level and had not come across the Father Garnet ref in Macbeth, though I knew about Father Garnet. Reading Shaekspeare and following all his literary and political refs and comments is an education in itself.\n-\n-\nThis stupid lefty website won't let me comment on @realitys post keeps on saying duplicate comment\nWho is being made redundant? by making these so called public service jobs not exist these people who work in a useless enterprise which creates nothing of value, can free up tax money to pay your choice of police officers or doctors or something a lot better the govt does. Unless you wanna start establishing ministries for indian people or ministry for asians or how about ministry for whites, that is how stupid the ministry for pacific peoples is\n[we hold back new comments to make sure that spam and trolls don’t get through.

Later Don McKinnon 1991-1998.\nThe Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs was first established in 1990 to look after New Zealand's growing Pasifika population. Prior to that, Pacific communities living in New Zealand fell under the responsibility of several government departments including the Te Puni Kōkiri (Ministry of Māori Development) and the Department of Internal Affairs's Pacific Affairs Unit. In 1975, Pacific communities established the Pacific Island Advisory Council to address their socio-economic needs. The council established education resource and multicultural centres while the Pasifika communities lobbied for a stand-alone ministry.[1]\nOn 22 December 2015, the Ministry announced it would be changing its name to the Ministry for Pacific Peoples, to reflect the growing number of Pasifika children born in New Zealand.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_for_Pacific_Peoples\nThe ACT Party of David Seymour is rejected by Roger Douglas the party co-founder.\nIt wants to abolish the Ministry of Women's Affairs, the Human Rights Commission, Maori Health Authority, Waitangi Tribunal.\nAbolish David Seymour as Epsom MP.\n-\nNotasocialist – perhaps instead of belittling public servants you could spend time improving your sub-standard grammar, jumbled expression and lack of punctuation. Then you may be able to make your point more worthy of commenters' entering into discussion with you on the merits or otherwise of thousands of public servants being made redundant.\n-\nFair point about my grammar, but you still didn't answer my question, and the same goes for all of you supporters of big govt. I have to ask you all a question though, when does it stop? When does the ministry for pacific peoples or the minister for racing, or the ministry for women. Or minister for youth.\n-\n-\nIf Seymour is the most presentable and sane one in his nasty little party, I hate to think what the others are like. They need to keep a lid on their actual beliefs but sometimes the hate and bile just leaks out and you see a glimpse of the reality\n-\nSeymour is too busy playing with his sausage. It is going to be a real bun fight the next 8 weeks hope you have all stocked up on plenty of popcorn???\n-\n-\n\"I can sense the good people of South and West Auckland and Porirua of Pacific background stirring and getting ready to vote. In seeking to court the racist vote this time Seymour has overstepped the mark.\"\nOf course, Seymour knows most people from these areas aren't likely to have voted for ACT…\nSometimes I wonder what has happened to politics in New Zealand of late (or maybe I just didn't understand it in my youth). However, policy decisions never seem to be based on a cohesive ideology, even neoliberalism. Now, it's all about sound-bites, dog-whistle outbursts.\nACT, the party that was largely founded on less government involvement in people's lives, for example, seems increasingly opinionated and critical of others who don't share its own – more than might be expected.\n-\nSeymour is a real doosie!!!\n-\nLook I gotta ask all of this 'left leaning' page, If the NZ GDP is 385 Billion and the Govt Budget is roughly 144 Billion, that means that more than 1 in every 3 dollars is a govt dollar, the way one person might view the 'essentials' health, education and emergency is 24B, 17.4B 2B+ defence force 4B. So these are essentials feel free to add anything else that materially improves New Zealander's lives and don't say the DOLE that costs 30Billion or something and last I checked Maccas was still hiring ? NZ has 180 Billion of Debt David Seymour is serious in reducing that so future generations don't get hit with the Bill + interest + no currency value + no real public services + a socialist dystopia. So where do we cut ?\n-\nIf you had checked the facts\nhttps://budget.govt.nz/budget/pdfs/estimates/v9/est23-v9-socdev.pdf\nYou would note that the $30B includes over $20B (21.6B) for super payments and under $10B (8.7B)for income support (unemployed, sick, disabled and sole parents).\nSo these are essentials feel free to add anything else that materially improves New Zealander's lives\nEducate yourself. Housing. Tax credits for low income family support. Accommodation Supplements.\nhttps://budget.govt.nz/budget/2023/by/vote/index.htm\nThere is $6B in debt repayments, $2B in NZSF contributions (allocating for a future cost).\nhttps://budget.govt.nz/budget/pdfs/estimates/v4/est23-v4-finan.pdf\n-\nOk so even if you add in that 30B you get 75 Billion, ish the rest is waste who needs and who gets that much extra money? the nz govt seems to want it. And also, lets just pose a moral question, if you work you whole adult life 18-65 and you don't save any money for when you leave the workforce on the belief that the Goverment is gonna come and pay you out?? how stupid can you be, thrive on free will, save some money on your own not dependance\n-\nEducate yourself, look through the vote allocations – the link was given to you. Transport etc look through it.\nAnd see if you can determine the actual cuts ACT is proposing.\nSuper History.\nLabour proposed a contributory model back in the 1970's. National rejected it for the tax paid model. NACT is continuing with super.\nAnd both their tax cut plans would increase the amount paid out – it is fixed to the average net (after tax) wage.\nFor a laugh, see whether the extra cost to super is greater than their proposed spending cuts.\n-\n-\n-\n- Comments are now closed",
