World Cup 2026 Host Committee led by the Los Angeles Sports & Entertainment Commission announced Jones will help them deliver a tournament experience that “leaves a lasting and meaningful legacy” for the region.\nEight World Cup matches will be played at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, which will feature the U.S. Men’s National Team’s opening game scheduled on June 12, 2026.\nAs part of the tournament, the organization is expected to deliver 39 days of fan engagement activities and entertainment. Jones will join recently announced Community Chairman Snoop Dogg in welcoming visitors to the tournament.\n“L.A. is home and it is with excitement and pride that I will serve as an official Los Angeles World Cup 2026 community ambassador,” Jones said in a statement.\n“I’ve spent my life here — growing up in the Conejo Valley playing AYSO and club soccer, to bringing home a NCAA championship with UCLA. Then helping create a MLS dynasty with the LA Galaxy hoisting trophies and winning titles,” his statement continued. “Yet, most important of all raising my family here.”\nJones played in three World Cups for the U.S. Men’s National Team —in 1994, 1998 and 2002. He spent 12 seasons with the LA Galaxy, spanning his entire Major League Soccer career.\nIn the last three decades, he has helped elevate the sport’s profile in the United States through his work as a broadcaster, coach and co-founder of Angel City Football Club of the National Women’s Soccer League.\n“As we prepare to welcome the world in 2026, Cobi Jones is the ideal representative for the Los Angeles World Cup 2026 with his deep ties to the game as a player, lifelong connection to LA, and unwavering commitment to growing the games of soccer,” said Kathryn Scholessman, president and CEO of the LA Sports & Entertainment Commission, and head of the host committee.\n“We’re honored to have him represent our region and help ensure the tournament leaves a meaningful and lasting legacy for Angelenos and visitors alike,” she added.",
