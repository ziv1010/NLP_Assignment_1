Talisha Green bravely heading home with a bullet header following an excellent corner delivery from Danielle Canham.\nThe closest Tafea came to securing an equaliser in the first half was via tournament top goalscorer Jane Alatoa, whose majestic run through Auckland’s midfield and defence deserved a goal. United’s goalkeeper Amberley Hollis was on hand, reacting quickly to push the Vanuatu international’s shot wide, in an otherwise relatively quiet half for the stopper.\nShortly before the cooling break, Wasi nearly added a second, latching on to a perfectly weighted through ball from Penny Brill, but her shot rippled the wrong side of the net.\nWhile Auckland United went searching for a second goal, Tafea goalkeeper Netty Kalsau was a considerable factor in keeping her side in the contest, making a very good save on the stretch to deny Wasi from a header.\nAs the half wore on, Tafea seemed most likely to find an equaliser from a moment of magic from Alatoa or Sine, although as the game went on the pair became increasingly isolated up top as Auckland United cut off the Vanuatuan side’s supply lines from midfield.\nWhen the leveller did come, it was via a substitute, having only just arrived on the field. Liyao Eramol acrobatically connected with a scissor kick, burying the ball past Hollis in the Auckland United goal and sparking huge celebrations from team mates and fans alike.\nTafea’s tails were up, and Alatoa had the chance to snatch the win after escaping the attentions of Greer MacIntosh, only for Hollis to push the ball away for a corner.\nWith penalties on the horizon, the opportunity to win the match fell to Danielle Canham, timing her run perfectly and having the simple task of side-footing into an unguarded net after team mate Piper O’Neill’s low cross from the by-line.\nThe Kiwi side will now turn their attention to this weekend’s final and a date with Papua New Guinea giants Hekari United at the National Stadium.\nAuckland United: 2 (Talisha GREEN 10’, Danielle CANHAM 104)\nTafea FC: 1 (Liyo ERAMOL 82)\nHT: 1-0\nContent Sourced from scoop.co.nz\nOriginal url",
