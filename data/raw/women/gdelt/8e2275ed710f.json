  "body_text": "The National Women’s Soccer League Boston expansion team unveiled its second effort to name itself following the disastrous first attempt in Oct. 2024.\nInstead of BOS Nation FC, the Boston team will be known as Boston Legacy Football Club, per a club announcement on Wednesday morning.\n“The club has gone through a rigorous fan feedback and quantitative analysis process, collecting hundreds of name suggestions from initial fan feedback and whittling that down over five months to one name, Boston Legacy FC,” the team announced in its statement unveiling the new name.\nAfter responses to the original name proved almost exclusively negative in late 2024, the club acknowledged in December that it would try again.\nAdvertisement:\n“Your voices have made it clear that revisiting our team name is essential,” controlling owner Jennifer Epstein said in an update on Dec. 31.\nBoston Legacy FC is set to take the field in 2026 as part of an NWSL expansion to 16 teams. The club has already hired front office staff, including former Barcelona executive Domènec Guasch as Boston’s first general manager.\nThe other major story already surrounding the team is its choice of home venue. Alongside the City of Boston and Mayor Michelle Wu, the club is currently locked in a court case over whether or not it will be allowed to go ahead with a major renovation project of White Stadium, which the Legacy intends to use.\nAdvertisement:\nThe lawsuit opposing the stadium renovation was brought by 20 citizens and the Emerald Necklace Conservancy, a private nonprofit group. A ruling is expected soon. Should the lawsuit succeed in defeating the current stadium project, the Legacy would need to seek alternative options for hosting home games.\nWhat do you think of the new NWSL Boston team name?",
