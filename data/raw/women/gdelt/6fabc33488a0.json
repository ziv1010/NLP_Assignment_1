  "body_text": "• Strikers Oparanozie, Oshoala return\nDespite calls from stakeholders and coaches to have ageing and inactive players dropped from the Super Falcons, head coach, Randy Waldrum, has once again invited 39-year-old defender Onome Ebi in his 23-woman squad for next month’s pre–World Cup friendlies in Turkey, The PUNCH reports.\nThe biggest news, however, is the return of striker and former captain Desire Oparanozie, who plays in the Chinese Women’s Super League for Wuhan Chegu Jianghan, after she was frozen out of the team in 2021.\nThe nine-time African champions have a date against Women’s World Cup-bound Haiti women’s national team at the Emir Sports Complex in Antalya, Turkey April 7, before taking on World Cup co-hosts New Zealand at the Mardan Sports Complex, also in Antalya, April 11.\nThe exhibition in Turkey is part of the Nigeria Football Federation’s plan to prepare the Falcons for the World Cup scheduled holds July 20 to August 20.\nLast month, the Falcons took part in the four-nation Revelations Cup tournament in Mexico, where they played three matches, losing two and winning one all by a 1-0 scoreline.\nHaving lost to hosts Mexico and South American giants Colombia respectively in their first two games of the tournament, the Falcons salvaged a 1-0 win over Costa Rica at the Estadio León in León de los Aldamas.\nIt was an underwhelming performance from Waldrum’s ladies and fans expressed doubts over the team’s chances of going far in New Zealand, querying Waldrum’s criteria for inviting ‘tired legs’, including Ebi for the tournament.\nAhead of their next friendlies in preparation for the World Cup, the American coach invited goalkeepers Chiamaka Nnadozie, Yewande Balogun and Abia Angels’ Inyene Etim.\nIn defence, he called up Osinachi Ohale, Ashleigh Plumptre, Glory Ogbonna, Rofiat Imuran, Michelle Alozie and Oluwatosin Demehin.\nOther invited players are Halimatu Ayinde, Christy Ucheibe, Ngozi Okobi-Okeoghene, Deborah Abiodun, Toni Payne, Regina Otu, Asisat Oshoala, Rasheedat Ajibade, Esther Okoronkwo, Ifeoma Onumonu, Uchenna Kanu and Gift Monday.\nMeanwhile, NFF president Ibrahim Gusau, has assured that the Falcons will put up an excellent show at the ninth Women’s World Cup.\n“Nigeria is very excited to be amongst the 32 finalist countries for the FIFA Women’s World Cup; the first to be co-hosted and the first ever for 32 teams. It is indeed a historic moment for us at the NFF and the Super Falcons and indeed for all the other teams that qualified,” Gusau said during a reception for the Women’s World Cup Trophy Tour in Abuja.\n“Indeed, the Government and people of Nigeria have high expectations for this year’s FIFA Women’s World Cup competition. Our Super Falcons have been preparing hard and still preparing to make an excellent run in Australia and New Zealand\n“We want to assure you that our Super Falcons will not be coming to Australia and New Zealand just to make up the number.”",
