  "body_text": "I know this post is going to be lost in the conversation over Daniel Levy, but today happens to be the transfer deadline for the Women’s Super League. And after what feels like an eternity, we do actually have some Tottenham Hotspur Women transfer news to discuss!\nDONE DEAL: Tottenham Women announce signing of Cathinka Tandberg, Anna Csiki loan\nA new Tottenham player! It’s a miracle!\nFirst, the club announced that they have signed 21-year-old Norway attacker Cathinka Tandberg from Hammarby IF.\nI wish I could tell you more about “Tinka” Tandberg than I do. I know that she was considered one of the more promising young Norwegians in football as a teenager playing as a forward at Linkopings, and she got her own article at Total Football Analysis. Stats for the Damallsvensken are sketchy, but last season she scored 11 goals in just 800 minutes with an xG/90 of 1.16. That’s pretty dang good! Tottenham desperately need players who can actually score goals, which is an area they really struggled in last season. Signing a young Norwegian who has a track record of doing just that feels like they got another solid player on the upside of her career. Sure hope that’s right!\nNew Spurs manager Martin Ho had this to say about Cathinka:\n“We’re delighted to welcome Cathinka to Tottenham Hotspur Women. She’s an exciting young talent with pace, creativity and intelligence in the final third. But just as importantly she’s a humble, hard-working character who wants to keep improving.\n“Cathinka is a great fit for the culture we’re building here and we’re looking forward to seeing the impact she can make with us.”\nThis is just Spurs’ second new signing this summer after bringing in Japan international defender Toko Koga, who is already turning heads in Spurs’ preseason appearances. That said, while the window is still open it’s a pretty meager return, especially after the departures of Haley Raso to Eintracht Frankfurt.\nSpeaking of departures, Spurs also announced that Ana Csiki has left for West Ham on a season-long loan.\nThe 25-year-old Hungarian defender joined last summer under then-manager Robert Vilahamn, but was something of a bust, playing just over 200 minutes last season after breaking out in 2022 at Hacken. It’s not clear whether this move was initiated by the player, or if Ho just doesn’t fancy her with Koga coming into the side, but at any rate she’ll hopefully be able to resuscitate her career down the road.\nIt doesn’t appear as though Spurs are going to be making a ton of changes to a side that slid to an 11th place finish last season and only avoided relegation because Crystal Palace Women were historically poor. That doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence, but perhaps this is a team that just needed a change of leadership and Martin Ho can get a tune out of them.\nTottenham Women’s first match of the season is this coming Sunday against West Ham at Brisbane Road. Kick-off is 7:00 a.m. ET / noon BST. The match is televised on Sky Sports+ in the UK, and can be streamed on YouTube.",
