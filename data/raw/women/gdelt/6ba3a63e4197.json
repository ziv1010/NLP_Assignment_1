She scored some bangers at training last night and is a very good player.\n\"Kiarra can score. I think Emily will be unique. She's scored a lot of goals in reserve grade.\n\"It just gives other people opportunities. We'll still be competitive and we'll create chances.\"\nBroadmeadow were 3-1 winners over Azzurri when they met in the first round.\nMagic's round-12 fixture with fourth-placed Maitland (21) last weekend was washed out while Azzurri came from behind to seal an important 2-1 win over fifth-placed Adamstown (16).\nCharlestown coach Niko Papaspiropoulos expected to have their leading striker Emily Diaz back in action against Magic after she was a late withdrawal for the Rosebud battle through illness.\nDiaz was among a number of first-grade players missing, mostly due to injury, when Charlestown lost 4-1 to an also understrength Newcastle Olympic in the Women's League Cup semi-final on Wednesday night.\nOlympic coach Neil Owens hoped former national league goalkeeper Claire Coelho would be back from holidays in time when they played Adamstown at Lake Macquarie Regional Football Facility on Saturday night (7pm).\nMaitland coach Keelan Hamilton should have close to a full complement of players available when they play Mid Coast (six) in Taree on Saturday (6pm).\nMid Coast captain-coach Emma Stanbury is sidelined with a fractured rib.\nSixth-placed New Lambton (13) will be looking to bank some valuable points against last-placed Warners Bay at Alder Park on Sunday (4pm) to stay in touch with the top four.\nMORE IN SPORT:\n- Maroons rookie Reece Walsh throws down the gauntlet to Kalyn Ponga\n- Newcastle set to welcome back national cricket carnival next summer\n- The Kiwi Fern soaking up Knights opportunity and shot at NRLW\n- Layne Morgan's plans to cement herself as Wallaroos' halfback\n- Saturday grand final for Newcastle RL in 2023\nTo see more stories and read today's paper download the Newcastle Herald news app here.",
