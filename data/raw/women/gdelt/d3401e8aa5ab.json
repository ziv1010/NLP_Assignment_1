  "body_text": "NU Notes: Satterfield Sizes Up Offense For Colorado\nNebraska’s offensive coordinator Marcus Satterfield met with members of the media ahead of Wednesday’s practice.\nNebraska’s offensive coordinator Marcus Satterfield met with members of the media ahead of Wednesday’s practice. Satterfield addressed what this week has been like for the offense and what he thought went well with Jeff Sims as Nebraska’s new quarterback.\n“It’s been a good week,” he said. “When you get to play a game, you get to uncover some warts you need to work on, and I think our guys and our coaches have done a nice job. We’ve been attacking things that we needed to get fixed. From just personnel things of getting off the field, from the sideline to the huddle, to the play calls, the technical things needed to be improved.”\nSatterfield was asked about what the wide receivers' room has looked like without Isaiah Garcia-Castaneda, who suffered an ACL tear in last Thursday’s game.\n“It’s an opportunity for the young guys to step up,” Satterfield said. “We have a bunch of young receivers that have unbelievable abilities and can help us. This is an opportunity for them to show what they can do.”\nHe also spoke on his perspective of Sims’ first game as a Husker.\n“I told him to just trust his training,” he said. “He was under control I thought, and he had an unbelievable game from a competitive standpoint. I knew he would be able to use his feet and we could use them in the quarterback run game. I was not aware that he could run that physically, like he was a physical runner the other night. That was great to see, and I think that’s something he can build on in the future.”\nThe Huskers will return to action on Saturday, Sept. 9 at 11:00 a.m. against Colorado at Folsom Field. The game is set to be broadcast on FOX, with radio coverage provided by Huskers Radio Network.\nRenewal of the Nebraska-Colorado rivalry becomes one of nation's must-see games in Week 2\nDeion Sanders and his Colorado Buffaloes stampeded to the forefront of college football with their dizzying opening performance, and now fans and non-fans alike want to see what they do next.\nIt will be a grand stage for Saturday's home opener in Boulder. The Buffs (1-0) are featured for the second straight week on Fox's Big Noon game, they are in the AP Top 25 this week at No. 22 and the opponent is former longtime Big Eight and Big 12 rival Nebraska (0-1).\nAll eyes will be on Deion's son, Shedeur Sanders, to see what he does for an encore after throwing for 510 yards and four touchdowns against TCU. Will two-way phenom Travis Hunter be able to be on the field for over 120 plays again? And will freshman sensation running back Dylan Edwards be able to get the ground game going after he starred as a pass-catcher last week?\nNebraska fans would love nothing more than seeing the Cornhuskers spoil the party at Folsom Field. The teams are in the middle of a four-game nonconference series that started in 2018, and the Huskers have lost the first two meetings. A win here would give an early boost to first-year coach Matt Rhule's effort to bring back the program.\nBEST GAME\nNo. 11 Texas (1-0) at No. 3 Alabama (1-0), 7 p.m. ET (ESPN)\nIt's a rematch of last year's thriller in Austin, which Alabama won 20-19 on a late field goal.\nThe “Texas is back” trope started well before the season among the Bevo crowd, but anxiety was running high of the opener before the Longhorns pulled away to beat Rice, 37-10.\nAlabama lost two regular-season games last year for only the second time since 2011, and there was a wait-and-see vibe heading into the season with the Crimson Tide having to replace Bryce Young and nine other NFL draft picks.\nNew starting QB Jalen Milroe accounted for five touchdowns last week, but that was against Middle Tennessee State.\nHEISMAN WATCH\nWashington's Michael Penix Jr. is poised to put up more big numbers when Tulsa visits. The sixth-year quarterback is in his second season with the Huskies and has recorded three of the top four passing performances in program history. He threw for 450 yards and five touchdowns last week against Boise State, with 11 of his passes going for at least 20 yards.\nNUMBERS TO KNOW\n3-145 — Louisville's record when trailing by 15 points or more in the second half before it erased a 28-13 halftime deficit to beat Georgia Tech 39-34.\n16 — Michigan's home winning streak entering its game against UNLV, third-longest behind Alabama (21) and Georgia (19).\n18 — Years since Oregon, which visits Texas Tech, played a true road game in the Lone Star State.\n111 — Arkansas' point total over its last two games, a 56-13 win over Western Carolina last week and 55-53 over Kansas in the Liberty Bowl.\n72 — Michael Pratt's school record-tying number of career touchdown passes for Tulane after he threw four against South Alabama.\nUNDER THE RADAR\nTexas A&M at Miami, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. Eastern.\nTexas A&M's Jimbo Fisher and Miami's Mario Cristobal wanted mulligans after each went 5-7 last season. Both are coming off easy wins in their openers and can use this game as an early progress report.\nThe Aggies beat Miami 17-9 in College Station last year, shortly before a six-game losing streak began. Two straight disappointing seasons have made A&M's 12th Man antsy.\nHOT SEAT\nNew Mexico's Danny Gonzales opened his fourth season with a 52-10 loss at Texas A&M and now faces a must-win home game against FCS team Tennessee Tech.\nThe Albuquerque native and ex-Lobo player has lost 25 of his 32 games and has three Mountain West wins. He's in the fourth year of a five-year, $3.5 million contract, and his buyout of $400,000 won't stop UNM from making a change if things don't get better.\nGonzales is selling hope after bringing in more than 40 newcomers. Among them is UAB transfer Dylan Hopkins, who leads what has been the nation's worst offense for two straight years.\nColorado and Nebraska players are getting a history lesson on a contrived rivalry that became real\nColorado and Nebraska players and coaches are paying a bit of lip service this week to the schools' football rivalry in advance of their game Saturday. They should talk to the guys who lived it.\nDeion Sanders' home coaching debut a week after the 22nd-ranked Buffaloes' upset of TCU will be the prime narrative entering the game in Boulder, Colorado.\nFor going on 40 years, though, the rivalry that retired CU coach Bill McCartney once talked into existence has been a theme — even though they moved to different conferences more than a decade ago.\nNebraska coach Matt Rhule said he watched YouTube clips of past games before he was hired and understands the teams' shared history. “When you have a legacy behind you,” he said, “you have to live up to it and you have to build on it for the future.”\nWhat do Rhule's players say? Ethan Piper, who grew up in Norfolk, Nebraska, said his grandfather told him about the rivalry. Receiver Alex Bullock, from Omaha, said he had heard about it. Defensive back Omar Brown, from Minneapolis, said he's told teammates this game “is a little more serious.”\nFor Sanders, he got a feel for the magnitude through conversations with former CU players and alumni who made it clear their disdain for their neighbors to the east.\n“I’ve learned the severity, the serious nature of this rivalry, and I’m embracing it 100%,” Sanders said. “This is personal. That’s the message of the week.\"\nSanders' son, starting quarterback Shedeur Sanders, was more direct: “We don’t like Nebraska,” he said.\nIf young Shedeur only knew.\nWhen the CU-NU series was at its height, it was possibly the most nasty and hateful rivalry this side of Ohio State-Michigan. It also coincided with a down cycle at Oklahoma, the Huskers' traditional rival. Colorado filled the void.\nThe Buffs were just 7-17-1 against the Huskers from 1986-2010, but their wins were devastating and a lot of the games were close. They were both ranked in all eight meetings from 1989-96, including six games when each was in the top 10. Colorado shared the national title in 1990, and the Huskers won three from 1994-97.\nThey were the top two teams in the Big Eight the last seven years of the conference, and they were 1-2 in the Big 12 North in 1996 and 2001. The Buffs' 62-36 victory in '01 signaled the beginning of a Nebraska decline from which it has yet to recover.\n“The beating we put on them, that will never, ever leave my mind,” said former CU tight end Daniel Graham, a 2002 first-round pick of New England who won two Super Bowls with the Patriots before returning home — he's from Denver — to play for the Broncos.\nGraham’s loathing of the Huskers was baked in by older teammates. He, in turn, made sure the next generation saw red whenever they lined up against Nebraska. The rivalry went dormant when Nebraska moved to the Big Ten and Colorado to the Pac-12 before the 2011 season. The teams are in the middle of a four-game nonconference series that ends next year in Lincoln. Colorado won the first two meetings.\nSanders is playing the rivalry thing to the hilt. In a nod to McCartney, he is barring his players from wearing any shade of red around the facility.\n“It’s so exciting to see that and hear that,” Graham said, “because someone is telling them what this rivalry means to us, what this game means to us.”\nOne of the first things McCartney did when he took over the Buffs in 1982 was contrive a rivalry with Nebraska and ban red in the football building. At that point, the Buffs hadn't beaten the Huskers in 15 years.\n“I still remember, as a kid, when he would do the whole outline of the schedule in red and ban the color red and all this other stuff and how we looked at him and just said, ‘Who are you? What is this?’ ” Omaha sports radio host John Bishop said. “That was the heyday of the Oklahoma series. You don't designate a rival. We were conditioned to the idea that rivalries came about because both teams were really good. Of course, Colorado was not, in the moment.\"\nFueled by the local media and McCartney's lead, Colorado fans hurled insults at all things Nebraska. Huskers fans were outspoken about the inhospitable treatment they'd receive in the Folsom Field stands. Nebraska players weren't all that keen on the place, either.\nTerry Connealy, a defensive lineman from 1991-94, said he and his teammates were hesitant to take off their helmets on the sideline because of projectiles fans aimed at them.\n“It was a pretty vicious fan base there,” Connealy said. “When you went to Oklahoma, there was just more respect, I would say, than there probably was from the Colorado fan base.”\nNo one had it worse than Byron Bennett, the kicker who had snowballs and oranges thrown at him as he lined up to try a field goal in the last seconds of a 19-19 tie in 1991.\n“Of course, I'm locked in, but you've got to be an idiot not to notice this stuff hitting around you that's normally not hitting around you while you're trying to kick a field goal, a game-winning one at that,” Bennett said this week. “I know for sure now a whistle would be blown. But it wasn't back then.”\nEarlier in the game, Bennett said, fans poured beer on him while he was taking care of an equipment issue along the wall separating the seats from the sideline.\n“The rivalry was out of this world,” Bennett said. “I know Husker fans like to play it down, Coach (Tom) Osborne liked to play it down, saying they weren't our rival. But you can't help but know it was a rivalry. Great athletes on both sides, especially during the '90s. I enjoyed playing in those games.”\nGraham was relaxing in Mexico last Saturday when Colorado knocked off nationally ranked TCU 45-42 as a three-touchdown underdog. He listened to the first three quarters, but had his cousin FaceTime him for the fourth so he could watch it — and then celebrate.\n“We were walking through the airport coming back from Cabo, wearing our Colorado stuff, and everyone was like, ‘Go Buffs!’ It’s exciting,” Graham said. “Colorado is back on the map now.”\nHUSKERS OPEN FALL SEASON AT VISIT KNOXVILLE COLLEGIATE\nThe Nebraska men’s golf team kicks off its 2023-24 season by traveling to Tennessee for the Visit Knoxville Collegiate, Sept. 8-10.\nFollowing a practice round on Thursday, the 54-hole tournament begins on Friday, Sept. 8 with Nebraska tee times beginning at 7:50 a.m. (CT).

Reed Malleck\nSecond-year Nebraska head coach Judd Cornell will lead an experienced lineup of five returning lettermen to Tennessee.\nSenior Gentry Scheve (Emporia, Kan.) earned the top spot in qualifying heading to Tennessee, after closing the 2022-23 season strong. Scheve earned lineup spots in each of Nebraska’s final four events last season, including a career-best fourth-place individual finish with a 215 (69-72-74) at the Fighting Illini Spring Collegiate (April 22-23). His performance in Illinois followed a career-best 208 (-8) at the Tiger Collegiate (April 10-11).
