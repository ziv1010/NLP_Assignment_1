England's victorious women's football and rugby teams have also been recognised.\nSir Idris, 53, known for his roles in The Wire and Luther, is knighted for services to young people, having founded the Elba Hope Foundation, which supports community empowerment, education, youth advocacy and sustainable development. He said: \"I receive this honour on behalf of the many young people whose talent, ambition and resilience has driven the work of the Elba Hope Foundation.\n\"I hope we can do more to draw attention to the importance of sustained, practical support for young people and to the responsibility we all share to help them find an alternative to violence.\" Meanwhile, Wicked star Cynthia Erivo has been made an MBE for services to music and drama. Earlier this year, David Beckham, Gary Oldman and Tess Daly were among the people to be named in the King's Birthday Honours list 2025, as reported by ChronicleLive.\nIn the latest New Year Honours list, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, who took home the Olympic gold at the 1984 Winter Games and saw success at the World, European and British Championships, are made a Dame and Sir for services to ice skating and to voluntary service. The pair, who later became the faces of ITV celebrity competition show Dancing On Ice, said the honour is \"wonderful and humbling at the same time\".\nDame Jayne, 68, said the timing of the honours seemed \"perfect\" after the pair danced on the ice for the last time this year. She said: \"We had such a great time, we were so happy with the tour and the fact that we got through it.\n\"It was a big thing for us to mark our career before retirement, and then receiving this award at the end of the year, it's just finished everything. It's perfect.\"\nThey join other stars who rose to fame in notable partnerships, such as Paul Elliott, one half of the Chuckle Brothers, who is made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), and Matt Lucas, half of the comedic Little Britain duo with David Walliams, who becomes an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). England's Lionesses feature heavily on the list after their Euros win in the summer - with captain Leah Williamson made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).\nAlex Greenwood, Keira Walsh, Georgia Stanway and Ella Toone, who were all part of the side that beat Spain in the final in Basel, Switzerland, in July, become MBEs. And the team's Dutch manager Sarina Wiegman, who has won the Euros twice with England, and once with the Netherlands, is awarded an honorary damehood, the Cabinet Office said.\nMembers of England Women's Rugby World Cup winning squad are also strongly represented, with Marlie Packer and Zoe Aldcroft becoming OBEs, along with coach John Mitchell. Teammates Ellie Kildunne, Sadia Kabeya, and Megan Jones are made MBEs after the Red Roses defeated Canada in the final in September.\nPaula Radcliffe, a three-time London Marathon winner who held the women's marathon world record for 16 years, is made an OBE. Elsewhere, The Kumars At No 42 actress Meera Syal, 64, becomes a Dame and broadcaster Gabby Logan, Harry Potter and Star Wars actor Warwick Davis and presenter and author Richard Osman are made OBEs.\nOsman, 55, who writes The Thursday Murder Club book series, said he was \"absolutely thrilled\" with the honour. Davis, also 55, said: \"This is the best thing that's ever happened to me and I've been in Star Wars.\"\nFootball commentator Clive Tyldesley, known for his \"Solskjaer has won it\" line as Manchester United claimed the 1999 Champions League, becomes an OBE for services to sports broadcasting and to charity. Writer Roy Clarke, creator of sitcoms Last Of The Summer Wine, Open All Hours and Keeping Up Appearances, becomes a knight.\nOther famous award recipients include comedian Bill Bailey, who has been made an MBE for services to entertainment, singer Ellie Goulding who has been made an MBE for services to biodiversity and the climate, and former Coronation Street star Sally Lindsay who has been made an MBE for her services to drama.",
