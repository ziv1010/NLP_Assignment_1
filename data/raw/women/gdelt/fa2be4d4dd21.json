You can start loosely planning your schedule from September through May, marking which days of the week will be reserved for \"drop everything, it's time for Chelsea Women.\" Keep in mind the five-time defending Women's Super League champions are going to be competing in four competitions once again in the first campaign under the new French manager, Sonia Bompastor. The kick off times and dates for all 22 of Chelsea Women's WSL fixtures have been confirmed.\nTwo weeks ago, the only time that was announced was the Matchday 2 meeting at newly promoted side Crystal Palace on September 27. That encounter will kick off at 19:30 BST or 2:30 p.m. ET across the pond for all the Americans out there. Two weeks later, the Blues' first meeting against Arsenal will be played on October 13 at 14:00 BST in front of what should be a packed Emirates Stadium. It'll surely be one the entire team wants considering the way the group performed in that same venue last December. That'll be the first match after CFCW's opening UEFA Women's Champions League game on either October 8 or 9.\nSeven of the first nine league matches are set to kick off at 2 p.m. in the United Kingdom. Two of those are the club's first matchup at Stamford Bridge against Manchester City on November 17 and Fran Kirby's return to Kingsmeadow scheduled for December 8.\nAfter the winter break, Chelsea square off against West Ham on January 19 and Arsenal on January 26. The meeting with the Gunners will be played at Stamford Bridge with the kick off at 14:00 GMT. Manchester City away, arguably the most difficult match of the season, is slated for March 23 at 13:00 BST. Hopefully, less than five days after that the West Londoners are competing in the quarterfinals of the Champions League.\nTo close out the campaign, Liverpool travel to the Bridge on May 11 for a 2 p.m. UK kick off.\nUpdated Women's Super League fixture list with dates and kick-off times\nMatchday 1: September 20 vs. Aston Villa (Kingsmeadow) - 19:00 BST, 2:00 p.m. ET\nMatchday 2: September 27 at Crystal Palace (Selhurst Park) - 19:30 BST, 2:30 p.m. ET\nMatchday 3: October 6 vs. Manchester United (Kingsmeadow) - 14:00 BST, 9:00 a.m. ET\nMatchday 4: October 13 at Arsenal (Emirates Stadium) - 14:00 BST, 9:00 a.m. ET\nMatchday 5: October 20 vs. Tottenham (Kingsmeadow) - 14:00 BST, 9:00 a.m. ET\nMatchday 6: November 3 at Everton (Walton Hall Park) - 14:00 GMT, 9:00 a.m. ET\nMatchday 7: November 10 at Liverpool (St Helens Stadium) - 14:00 GMT, 9:00 a.m. ET\nMatchday 8: November 17 vs. Manchester City (Stamford Bridge) - 14:00 GMT, 9:00 a.m. ET\nMatchday 9: December 8 vs. Brighton and Hove Albion (Kingsmeadow) - 14:00 GMT, 9:00 a.m. ET\nMatchday 10: December 15 at Leicester City (King Power Stadium) - 15:00 GMT, 10:00 a.m. ET\nDomestic football pauses for the Christmas and New Year period.\nMatchday 11: January 19 at West Ham United (Chigwell Construction Stadium) - 15:00 GMT, 10:00 a.m. ET\nMatchday 12: January 26 vs. Arsenal (Stamford Bridge) - 14:00 GMT, 9:00 a.m. ET\nMatchday 13: February 2 at Aston Villa (Villa Park) - 14:00 GMT, 9:00 a.m. ET\nMatchday 14: February 16 vs. Everton (Kingsmeadow) - 14:00 GMT, 9:00 a.m. ET\nMatchday 15: March 2 at Brighton and Hove Albion (Broadfield Stadium) - 14:00 GMT, 9:00 a.m. ET\nMatchday 16: March 16 vs. Leicester City (Kingsmeadow) - 14:00 BST, 10:00 a.m. ET\nMatchday 17: March 23 at Manchester City (Etihad Stadium) - 13:00 BST, 9:00 a.m. ET\nMatchday 18: March 30 vs. West Ham United (Kingsmeadow) - 14:00 BST, 9:00 a.m. ET\nMatchday 19: April 20 vs. Crystal Palace (Kingsmeadow) - 14:00 BST, 9:00 a.m. ET\nMatchday 20: April 27 at Manchester United (Leigh Sports Village) - 12:00 BST, 7:00 a.m. ET\nMatchday 21: May 4 at Tottenham (Brisbane Road) - 14:00 BST, 9:00 a.m. ET\nMatchday 22: May 11 vs. Liverpool (Stamford Bridge) - 14:00 BST, 9:00 a.m. ET\nNote: All fixtures are subject to change.
