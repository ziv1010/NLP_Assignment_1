  "body_text": "Mary Earps has confirmed the primary reason that motivated her Manchester United departure in a heartfelt message to supporters via social media.\nUnited also relayed that Earps will part ways with the club following the conclusion of her contract. The expectation is that the goalkeeper will join French outfit Paris Saint-Germain.\nEarps spent the last five years at United but her current deal with the club had been winding down as the summer approached.\nThe Red Devils had been in talks with her camp over fresh terms but those negotiations did not bear any fruit.\nA club statement read, “Everyone at Manchester United would like to thank Mary for her fine service and wish her the best of luck in the next stage of her career.”\nIn her farewell message, Earps explained that she decided to pursue a new adventure away from United because her career stage no longer aligns with the club’s current direction. This comes mere days after Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s admission that INEOS do not have a clear plan in place for the women’s team.\nThe shot-stopper wrote, “Dear the United family, After 5 years of service to your great club, I have decided that it’s time for a new challenge. It’s a decision I’ve gone backwards and forwards on for some time, and is not one I’ve made lightly. The club is about to undergo a period of transition, and unfortunately I don’t feel it aligns with the timing of where I’m at in my career, therefore I think now is the right time to make a change and embark on a new challenge.”\n“There aren’t the right words, or enough words, to express my heartfelt gratitude to you all, but I hope the below comes somewhere close.”\n“I’m proud to have played every league minute for the badge for the past 5 seasons, and even more proud for us as a team to have broken the record of the most clean sheets kept in a season in 2023. The icing on the cake was winning the FA Cup at Wembley, a trophy I’ve always dreamed of winning, with you all singing at the top of your voices. I could list so many more of my favourite memories, but these in particular I’ll cherish.”\n“I have loved playing in front of you all, near and far but especially at Leigh Sports Village and Old Trafford. It doesn’t feel real that I won’t be playing in front of you all again next season, and I’m sad we’re saying goodbye. But from the bottom of my heart, thank you. Thank you for your incredible support over the years; the ups and the downs, I’m grateful for it all.”\n“To my teammates, there have been some special people to grace our changing room over the past 5 years. I’m fortunate to have stood alongside you all and I’ll be rooting for you.”\n“Although this United chapter has sadly come to a close, I take with me a heart full of incredible memories. Thank you for welcoming me as one of your own and letting me be a part of your club. I wish you all the very best for the future and I hope I can continue to make you proud in my next chapter.”\nEarps joins a number of high-profile players who have left United as free agents. Earlier this week, Marc Skinner’s side confirmed the departure of captain Katie Zelem.\nForward Lucia Garcia’s tenure also came to an end. The Spaniard is poised to become the latest addition at Mexican outfit Monterrey.\nEarps made 125 appearances for United and helped the women’s team win their first major piece of silverware last term when they beat Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup final.\nLast year, United turned down a world-record fee for a goalkeeper in women’s football when Arsenal lodged an offer for her.\nWant to be the first to hear breaking Man United news?
