  "body_text": "From the unprecedented destruction of a summer storm to the revitalization of historic downtown buildings, 2025 was a year of transformation for Bemidji. In the face of adversity, the community came together to clear the path for a season of growth and renewal. These are the Pioneer’s top stories from a year defined by its obstacles, but remembered for its resilience.\nWeathering the storm\nIn the early morning hours of June 21, a historic storm that featured hurricane-grade winds swept through the Bemidji area, downing 9 million trees and causing extensive damage throughout the city.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhile the destruction dramatically altered Bemidji’s landscape, the community didn’t skip a beat and immediately rallied to help each other sort through the wreckage and get back on their feet. The day the storm hit, when Sanford Bemidji Medical Center was suffering from power outages, the United Way of Bemidji Area mobilized Mychal Stittsworth and Jason Rylander to grill food for its staff and patients.\nWith power outages that spanned more than a week for some, several organizations provided free meals to residents and frontline workers, including Lueken’s Village Foods and Sanford Health. Just days after the storm, Buffalo-based food truck SafesideBBQ traveled to Bemidji to serve around 800 free meals.\nAgencies outside of Bemidji also showed up to lend a helping hand. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, the Bemidji Fire Department received assistance from roughly 100 firefighters representing 19 other departments across the state. In July, veteran-led nonprofit Team Rubicon descended upon Bemidji to provide humanitarian aid, offering free cleanup services to homeowners in need.\nIn the weeks that followed, Gov. Tim Walz and U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar toured Bemidji to assess the damage, with Walz declaring a Peacetime Emergency for Beltrami County after his visit.\nAs the impacts of the storm continue to be felt throughout the community, locals are still seeing glimmers of hope through the wreckage, with Kelliher-based Heim Log Homes even salvaging 122 downed trees to repurpose as home-building material, providing a silver lining to a severe weather event that the Bemidji area will not soon forget.\nCommunity comes together\nAs is the case every year, Bemidji offered plenty of new and returning community events in 2025. And as residents in the Northland know, you don’t have to wait until summer for the fun to start — nearly 70 people came out to the annual Brrrmidji Plunge benefiting Special Olympics in February, despite real-feel temps of 13 degrees below zero.\nAfter the June 21 storm caused significant damage throughout town, many wondered if the 81st Annual Bemidji Jaycees Water Carnival would be able to go on as scheduled. However, organizers leapt into action to ensure the festivities would continue, just with a few venue changes for some of the week’s events.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAlumni were welcomed back to town for Bemidji’s All School Reunion, held in late July. As part of the festivities, the historic Central School Bell – the only artifact left standing after Central School burned down in 1958 – was officially dedicated next to the arch at the BHS campus.\nLater in the summer, teams once again assembled for the 19th Annual Lake Bemidji Dragon Boat Festival. After a one-year championship hiatus, the HydraHeads reclaimed the first-place title for the 11th time; the team’s most dominant win came in the finals with a time of 2:02.65, knocking out three potential first-time winners by nearly four seconds.\nThe Sanford Bemidji campus served as the grounds for the 20th annual Niimi'idiwin (powwow) in August, with members of the White Earth, Red Lake and Leech Lake Nations represented as the sound of drum songs filled the air. At the 52nd Annual O-Bah-Shiing powwow in Ponemah, the Kingbird family honored their late relative, Albert \"T\" Kingbird, with a breechcloth and bell dance.\nCar enthusiasts had all the more reason to flock to Bemidji in 2025. The third annual Babe’s Burnout Car Show drew more than 7,000 attendees to the Sanford Center in July, and a month later, rally car stars burned rubber as a street course in the Sanford Center parking lot capped off the Ojibwe Forests Rally in a first-of-its-kind event.\nAs summer transitioned into fall, runners descended on Bemidji for the 13th Annual Blue Ox Marathon. Although the route was slightly altered due to storm damage at Lake Bemidji State Park, participants experienced a picturesque fall day in the Northwoods. Returning champion Ellyssa Peterson secured the women’s division win, while Bemidji native and first-time marathoner Brett Kurschner won the men’s division title.\nBemidjians rang in the holiday season with the 29th annual Night We Light parade and ceremony, as over half a million lights illuminated the city. During the event, organizers highlighted the community partnerships that emerged from the June storm, and representatives with several agencies that were integral in the storm’s response and cleanup served as joint Grand Marshals for the parade.\nTrial between Bemidji and Northern Township\nNorthern Township’s petition to incorporate, filed on April 14, was a controversial move that, depending on who is asked, came out of nowhere. But in truth, this topic has simmered for many years, thanks to a need for wastewater services at the township’s north shore Lake Bemidji properties.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe issue finally reached a boiling point in 2025.\nBemidji followed suit and attempted to reenter wastewater negotiations, but was unsuccessful. Then, the city filed its counter-petition to annex portions of Northern Township on May 19.\nThis set the pace for a historic boundary trial – typically, such trials are not contested in Minnesota. Both municipalities made final offers to avoid the trial, but negotiations were unsuccessful.\nThus, the trial commenced on Sept. 29. Each entity hosted Judge Jessica Palmer-Denig for a week to share their side of the story, complete with public hearings.\nThe hearing ended on Oct. 10 and the trial is now in its final stretch. Judge Palmer-Denig has until mid-April 2026 to finalize a decision, as one must be made within a year of the first petition.\nThe ruling will affect both municipalities and will decide who provides wastewater treatment services to Lake Bemidji’s north shore. It will also determine if Bemidji grows or Northern Township solidifies its boundaries, with a wastewater treatment plant project to follow.\nHistoric downtown buildings see new life\nA couple of downtown Bemidji's oldest buildings got new life in 2025 with major renovations of the former Elks Lodge and Bemidji Hardware, both over 100 years old.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Elks building, now called the Fourth Street Lodge, is home to the Blue Oyster bar and restaurant, the Fourth Street Lofts boutique hotel and The Loft Event Center.\nThe four lodging rooms pay homage to Bemidji's history, featuring names from hotels that dotted the downtown landscape a century ago: The Rex, The Dalton, The Markham and The Lakeshore.\nThe Loft Event Center has already held several concerts, meetings and two Elevated Markets featuring a variety of vendors.\nThe entire former Elks Building, now known as the Fourth Street Lodge, is owned by developer Mitch Rautio, restaurateur Keng Dechawuth and local banker Carl Johnson.\nOne block to the west, the former Bemidji Hardware building has gotten a facelift and renovation to accommodate three professional service firms: Hazelton Law Group, TrueJourney Investments and a third company to be announced.\nThe building has been home to a variety of businesses, including Bemidji Hardware, Swedmark Hardware, a bargain center, a furniture and home decor store, and more recently, Junkin’ Treasures and Ally’s Corner. It also housed at least three bars, Bottom’s Up, O’Brien’s and the U Bar.\nBrooks Hazelton, owner of Hazelton Law Group, purchased the building when he and his wife, Lauren, formed HMN Properties, named after the first initials of their children.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPolitics spurs protests\nPresident Donald Trump was elected for a second term in the Oval Office in November 2024. His inauguration was a sneak peek of what to come for Bemidji residents when Indivisible Bemidji volunteers gathered on Jan. 20 at the Beltrami County Historical Society to rehouse artifacts, preserving history.\nAnd 76 days into Trump’s second term, Indivisible Bemidji hosted Bemidji’s Hands Off Rally, joining a national day of protest to speak against Trump’s agenda. The peaceful demonstration saw more than 1,000 attendees.\nIn May, roughly 100 gathered at Bemidji’s Social Security Administration building in defiance of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, which slashed funding for many governmental programs but has since been dissolved.\nA third demonstration followed in June to support Lakeland PBS as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was facing defunding threats by the Trump Administration.\nA fourth protest followed closely after, the first “No Kings” rally of 2025, which again saw over 1,000 participants.\nMore protests followed throughout 2025, including a \"Workers over Billionaires\" rally on Labor Day and a second “No Kings” rally on Oct. 18. The second “No Kings” rally was one of the largest days of protest in American history, with an estimated 5 to 7 million participants nationwide.\nIndivisible Bemidji organized each rally, with some as part of a national protest.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArts impacts\nAfter a shortened three-play season in 2024, the Paul Bunyan Playhouse board announced in January that it planned to put on a full 74th season of five plays in 2025 while also creating a long-range strategic plan and raising funds for operations. However, in February, the board announced that the 2025 season would be suspended. The nonprofit organization, which dates back to 1951, also operates the Chief Theater in downtown Bemidji.\nThe June 21 storm damaged the building at 310 Fourth Street NW that housed the Loon Country Arts Collective, a nonprofit, artist-run gallery. The gallery has since found a new home in the historic Carnegie Building at 426 Bemidji Ave. N.\nThe Bemidji Symphony Orchestra capped off its 20th season under music director Beverly Everett in the spring and partnered with local organizations that provide services for the homeless in conjunction with its November concert.\nOutreach events were held at the Bemidji Community Table, People's Church, the New Day Center, and the Boys and Girls Club of the Bemidji Area. Also involved in the project were Evergreen Youth Shelter, Northwoods Battered Women’s Shelter and Village of Hope.\nThe project culminated with the BSO’s concert, which included a performance of Lucas Richman’s “Concerto for Violin: Paths to Dignity,” featuring former Los Angeles Philharmonic violinist Mitchell Newman. The piece, written exclusively for Newman, serves as a catalyst for meaningful discussion on the connections between homelessness and mental health, as well as the role the arts can play in restoring humanity and dignity to the ever-growing population of displaced citizens.\nLibrary funding cut by county\nBeltrami County began working on its budget sooner than normal to observe potential state and federal cost shifts in May. County Administrator Tom Barry presented a list of 10 budget principles and priorities, which the board adopted as a tool to narrow down the county’s budget in anticipation of the cost shifts.\nThe list included funding mandates at a minimum. This clause would come back in a big way when the commissioners received a budget update during a Sept. 2 meeting. The county planned to cut community services by 42%, equating to $8,000 worth of Paul Bunyan Transit funding; $7,500 worth of Beltrami County Historical Society funding and over $170,000 worth of library funding – lowering funds from $437,725 to $265,162, the state-mandated minimum.\nCommunity members gathered to protest against the funding cuts when the preliminary budget and levy were set on Sept. 16. Then, the Kitchigami Regional Library System discussed the cut during a Sept. 18 meeting, culminating in a “meet me halfway” offer that was ultimately not approved.\nThe county budget was officially approved on Dec. 2, including the contentious cut to library funding.\nSports successes\nBemidji-area sports fans are no strangers to success, and 2025 was no different.\nThe year started with a bang as the Bemidji High School boys wrestling team finally got over its Willmar hump again to qualify for the Class 3A state meet as a team. Several other individuals qualified for state as well.\nThe BHS boys hockey team returned to the Section 8AA championship for the first time since 2016, falling to Moorhead, the eventual state champs. Daniel Scherling also became the first BHS boys swimmer to compete at state since 2021. Aubrey DeWitt closed out a historic gymnastic career for BHS in Minneapolis as well.\nBefore the spring season started, Bemidji State men’s hockey pulled off an upset over second-seeded Augustana in a winner-take-all Game 3 in the Mason Cup Playoffs. The Beavers eventually lost to top-seeded Minnesota State one game shy of making the NCAA Tournament.\nWhen the snow melted, BHS boys volleyball entered its second season in program history, becoming the only program at the school to be self-funded. The Lumberjacks’ challenges with the Minnesota State High School League’s biennial competitive section realignment persisted, but it was announced that they were admitted into the Central Lakes Conference in the fall.\nBefore the end of the 2024-25 athletic season, Blackduck High School softball qualified for its first-ever state tournament. A handful of BHS athletes also made it to state in track and field.\nAs the summer wound down, BSU men’s hockey made headlines again, adding a pair of former professional hockey players to its roster in August. The Beavers became the first team in college hockey to use the NCAA Eligibility Center for former Canadian Hockey League players who turned pro. Also on the hockey front, Bailey Rupp made another leap in her national development.\nWhen the fall season rolled around, the BHS boys cross country team made it back to state for the first time since 2022. BHS football returned to the Section 8-5A championship as well. Four BHS swimmers made it to state, including Finley Zothman in two events.\nThe calendar year of sports was capped off with the World Junior Championship Pre-Tournament Series games in Bemidji, welcoming Czechia, Slovakia and Latvia to the Sanford Center ahead of one of the largest international hockey tournaments in the world.\nGovernment projects make progress\nBoth Beltrami County and the city of Bemidji saw big projects move forward in 2025.\nThe city continued to work with Greater Bemidji to move a rail corridor clean-up project, which includes a YMCA, forward. A Planned Unit Development preliminary review was unanimously approved in May, further helping the project become a reality.\nThen, the first step of the project to clean up the site was approved in October, with the demolition of three corridor buildings.\nBemidji’s State Highway 197 reconstruction project was far bumpier in 2025. It was approved at the end of 2024, but was stalled in March due to a federal grant freeze. The Minnesota Department of Transportation noted that the grant was reinstated, but is now one year behind schedule.\nFor Beltrami County, its new jail project is moving according to its schedule and could be operational by Spring 2027.\nThe Beltrami County Commissioners settled on demolishing the current jail once the new one is complete, and for the time being, turning the space into a parking lot once the new jail is operational.\nWard 3 sees a new face\nRon Johnson had been the face of Bemidji’s third ward since 2001. This changed in 2025 when new council member Mark Dickinson was sworn in on Jan. 6.\nJohnson was redistricted out of Ward 3 when the council voted to redraw maps in 2022. He launched a bid for Bemidji’s At-Large council seat later that year, but lost to current At-Large Councilor Audrey Thayer. His final attempt to stay with the council came in 2024 when he lost the Ward 1 race to Gwenia Fiskevold Gould. This ended his over two-decade term as Bemidji’s Ward 3 councilor.\nDickinson continues to serve the Bemidji City Council and is wrapping up his first year.\nThis collection of stories was written and gathered by Pioneer reporters Annalise Braught, Dennis Doeden, Jared Rubado, Madelyn Haasken and TJ Rhodes.",
