  "body_text": "Could granddaughter of 'The King' play for Wales?\n- Published\nTo rugby fans, Barry John was 'The King'. To Gwalia United's Anna Powell, he was the grandfather in Wales who used to play rugby.\nPowell was born and raised in Australia but has moved \"home\" to Wales as she bids to live her dream of playing football in the Women's Super League (WSL).\nThe 20-year-old listened to tales of John's rugby exploits while growing up in Fremantle, Perth.\nBut having crossed the globe to join Gwalia last month, Powell is \"learning things each day\" about John, the former Wales fly-half who died in 2024 and will be long remembered as one of the greatest players his sport has seen.\n\"My mum would tell us stories about him. When we were young we'd be like 'yeah, OK, that seems pretty cool',\" Powell said.\n\"But over here, I have been blown away by the legacy he has. It's almost like he is still with us in a way because his name continues to be brought up.\n\"I was saying to mum, 'I am shocked'. She said 'I told you so' and I said 'yeah, you were right!'.\"\nPowell's parents are Lucy - one of John's four children - and Meirion, from Caerphilly, who left Wales for Australia in 2003.\nThe family would return to these shores to visit their many relatives, with Powell remembering how \"dadcu\" - Welsh for grandfather - \"didn't stress about anything\".\n\"I have many memories with him,\" Powell said. \"But the memories I have are not of the rugby legend Barry John. He was dadcu to all of us.\n\"He would throw sweets at us in his flat overlooking Llandaff fields. He would tell stories. He was so calm and relaxed and funny.\"\nWhen Powell was tasked with doing a school project on a family member, John was the obvious choice.\nAs a result she rang him for information on his legendary career in which he played for Llanelli, Cardiff, Wales and the British and Irish Lions.\n\"He was so animated - he would bring up the matches and I could visualise everything. He was such a great storyteller,\" she said.\n\"You could tell he had so much pride for Wales. But he wouldn't say 'I did this, I was so amazing', he praised everyone.\n\"He said [Sir] Gareth [Edwards] and JPR [Williams] were great players to play with. He would talk about the joy of playing as opposed to what he did.\"\nQuinnell's hand in the move to Wales\nThe idea of trying rugby was discussed at one stage, but Powell has been a football fanatic since joining her local club, Fremantle City, about a decade ago.\nShe spent two years playing at college in Texas before the move to Britain, which came about thanks in part to the family's rugby connections.\nPowell's great uncle is Derek Quinnell, John's brother-in-law and former team-mate. Quinnell's sons, former Wales players Scott and Craig, are Powell's first cousins once removed.\nWith Powell keen to play football in Wales, Craig got in touch with Trystan Bevan, the former Cardiff Blues head of performance who is now the general manager at Gwalia.\nWithin days, Powell had agreed a deal running until the end of the season with the option of another year.\nShe is living with her grandmother, John's widow Janet, and uncle as she looks to establish herself in the National League Southern Premier Division, the third tier of the English football pyramid.\nThe rugby genius they simply called 'The King'\n- Published4 February 2024\nCardiff City Ladies to be renamed Gwalia United\n- Published1 March 2024\n\"I feel so grateful and blessed to be over here, to enjoy all of Wales and to be with my extended family in my original home, I guess [you could call it],\" Powell said.\nAcademic studies have been put on hold as Powell, a midfielder or forward, focuses on \"working hard for Gwalia\".\nHer ultimate goals are to reach the WSL, the English top flight, and to play international football.\nBut would Powell play for Australia or Wales, should the chance come?\n\"I love my country back home but I also love Wales and the fact that I am Welsh,\" she said.\n\"Whether I had a famous granddad who played rugby or not, it's the people and the life and the history of Wales. It's so wonderful to know that I'm a part of that.\n\"Whether it is Australia or Wales, anything would be such an amazing opportunity.\"\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.
