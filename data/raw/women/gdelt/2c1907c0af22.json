  "body_text": "The only guide to the round that admits it’s completely unhelpful. What it lacks in insight, it makes up for with wild theories and detours onto unrelated topics.\nIt’s your unhelpful guide to Round Eleven.\nFriday\nSydney vs. Carlton (SCG) 7:50pm Seven/Fox\nIt’s early in the season, but the Carlton President has already come out and given his full support to Michael Voss.\nYou know Voss is in trouble then, and with Damien Hardwick out there, you just know the Blues will not be able to help themselves.\nI’m not saying Hardwick is going to the Blues; I’m saying people involved with the Blues won’t be able to resist sounding him out and, in the process, destabilising the club.\nCarlton can’t resist a saviour; fixing all their problem in one fell swoop is just too tempting for them.\nThis is the problem when you just think you should be on top rather than working for it. They are the trust fund baby of the league.\nAnd to lose this would be a disaster. Sydney hasn’t exactly shot the lights out this season.\nLast week, they only won because North Melbourne are numerically challenged.\nWhile I wouldn’t put it past Carlton to stuff up basic maths, they used to do it all the time with the salary cap, the Swans can’t rely on that again.\nTo borrow from Kerry Packer speaking about Alan Bond ‘you only get one North Melbourne interchange debacle in your life.’\nI’m tipping Carlton but hoping the Swans get it done as next week’s column will write itself.\nSaturday\nSt Kilda vs. Hawthorn (Marvel) 1:45pm Fox Footy\nThe Hawks are having a nightmare off the field this season, but on the field, they are slightly less of a nightmare.\nLast week, was a bit of a false positive. Beating the Eagles is like stealing candy from a baby, an inept and uncoordinated baby.\nStill the Hawks have some good young players coming through, so there’s hope there.\nWhen the Saints lost to Adelaide a fortnight ago, I imagine I wasn’t on my lonesome when I thought, ‘here we go again’.\nBut the Saints got things back on track against the Giants and now they get a week off to firm up those defensive drills.\nThe Saints other main priority is to make sure Max King doesn’t get injured again. I would be putting him in one of those Zorbs whenever he isn’t playing.\nSure, that will make it hard for him to have a life, but players shouldn’t have lives, they exist to perform for us.\nSaints to win.\nMelbourne vs. Fremantle (MCG) 2:10pm Fox Footy\nMelbourne have a big reason to win this. Thanks to the Luke Jackson trade and the resulting movement of draft picks, a Fremantle loss is a win for Melbourne.\nIn recent weeks, what was looking like the deal of the century for the Dees has been coming back to a more even keel.\nJackson, and Fremantle have been improving significantly in recent weeks, they’ve won three in a row.\nAnd now they get a Melbourne side without Clayton Oliver.\nThat’s a big out. Oliver is the guy in the group assignment volunteering to do all the work. He’s the best player I’ve ever seen in a Melbourne jumper.\nAfter losing to the Power last week, the Demons can’t afford to drop this game, especially as Collingwood, Brisbane and Port seem to have forgotten how to lose.\nA loss here and the Dees start looking like the Crows, or worse, Carlton.\nThe good news for the Dees, is this is at home, so it’s unlikely Brodie Grundy will shush the crowd.\nWe also get to see Max Gawn and Luke Jackson go against each other in this one.\nNot since Darth Vader took on Obi-Wan Kenobi have I been so excited for a match-up.\nI’m tipping Fremantle.\nGeelong vs. Greater Western Sydney (GMHBA) 4:35pm Fox Footy\nGeelong’s injury list is painful to read.\nCam Guthrie (toe), Max Holmes (knee), Sam De Koning (face), Gary Rohan (hamstring), Cameron Mooney (KO’d), Rhys Stanley (eye), Ollie Henry (testicle), Mitch Duncan (hamstring), Jack Bowes (calf) and Jhye Clark (foot).\nOllie Henry’s injury is particularly eye-watering. I can’t think of many circumstances were having your name and ‘testicle’ in the media is a good thing.\nIt’s either a painful incident or you’ve done something you shouldn’t have in the workplace.\nThe injury woes have led to the Cats dropping their last two games, but losing down in Geelong is not something they often do.\nThe Giants have been competitive this season, while managing to dodge victory, like a matador avoiding a bull.\nThe result is their better than the bottom three teams but that’s about it.\nI’m tipping Geelong.\nGold Coast vs. Western Bulldogs (TIO) 7:25pm Seven/Fox\nThe Bulldogs travel into the heart of Suns territory, Darwin.\nConsidering they played in Ballarat last week, that’s quite the gear shift.\nIt does show you that playing AFL takes you to all the great cities of the world.\nIn recent weeks, the Doggies have been on fire, smashing the Crows last week and now they get the Gold Coast.\nI relate to the Suns. They remind me of what every teacher wrote on my report card, ‘has not lived up to his potential.’\nWell, the joke now is on those teachers, I’ve proved I just didn’t have any potential.\nThe Suns have been in the news with Hardwick retiring, with the media asking Stuart Dew if he felt this put pressure on him.\nI don’t think he should worry; I can’t think of any occasions where a club have ruthlessly sacked someone just to get a premiership coach.\nI’m tipping the Suns.\nWest Coast vs. Essendon (Optus) 7:30pm Fox Footy\nThere are no words to describe how bad I am at golf.\nDriving the ball, chipping, putting, any who have witnessed me doing these have said later it was the worst thing they’ve ever seen, bordering on the traumatic.\nOnce at the driving range, I teed off and somehow hit it behind me and broke a window, narrowly missing several people.\nThe staff came and physically removed the club from my hand and banned me from the premises.\nThey said I was a danger to myself and everyone else.\nThis is all to say, I am still better at golf than the Eagles are at Australian Rules Football.\nThe news broke this week that Essendon has brought in a medical specialist to help with their injury problems.\nNow while more jokes than I could fit on the internet come to mind, I would have thought the club would already have this.\nIsn’t preventing injuries part of the medical and fitness departments job?\nTo my knowledge, only the Eagles actively try to injure their players.\nI’m tipping the Bombers.\nSunday\nRichmond vs. Port Adelaide (MCG) 1:10pm Fox Footy\nA bit on at Tigerland this week, with Damien Hardwick announcing he’s leaving.\nNot since Zayn left One Direction has such a move shaken a group of men to its core.\nHardwick led Richmond to three premierships and was a big part of rebuilding the club into a powerhouse, but apart from that he didn’t do much.\nAndrew McQualter now steps in as the interim coach, and Dimma has given him some advice ‘be yourself.’\nThis is terrible advice. I spent a lot of time being myself and it led me to being friendless, loveless and with several injunctions.\nMy advice? Be Paul Rudd. The guy is charming, and he just doesn’t age. Men and women like him, and he was in Clueless which is a classic and still stands up.\nPort will be disappointed to be facing the Tigers after their coach has left, although usually, a team lifts because a coach has been sacked.\nIn this case, the coach sacked the team, but that’s not as motivating.\nDavid King has predicted this week that Damien Hardwick will be the coach of Port Adelaide in 2024.\nSo, you can be assured he won’t be coach of Port Adelaide next year.\nI’m tipping the Power.\nCollingwood vs. North Melbourne (Marvel) 3:20pm Seven/Fox\nIs this even legal? It feels like it shouldn’t be.\nAre we going to have adults fighting children next? Lions vs Christians?\nThe only way I could see the Pies losing this one, is if North Melbourne managed to change the sport to netball.\nPersonally, I enjoyed watching the Pies lose across various codes. The question now is, will Collingwood drop their badminton team?\nOne bit of good news is Tarryn Thomas has been cleared to make his AFL return and Brett Ratten says he’s “pretty close” to be picked.\nIt’s just great to see an AFL player get a second third fourth fifth sixth seventh eighth chance.\nAnd it’s not like the AFL hasn’t been banging on about respecting women, and how they take all this stuff seriously, so there’s no hypocrisy in letting him back into the game.\nIf he was a rubbish player, they would have dumped him months ago. North can play him all they want; they just can’t swing around and grab the high moral ground in the future. Oh, and it’s a disgrace.\nI’m tipping the Pies.\nAdelaide vs. Brisbane (AO) 4:40pm Fox Footy\nAdelaide were awful last week, and now they face the Lions, who are building nicely.\nJoe Daniher is playing well, and he is like the canary in the coal mine. If Joe is up and about, so are the Lions.\nIf he’s asleep at the bottom of his cage, get out of the mine because dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide are building up.\nWait, I don’t think the analogy stretches that far.\nThe Lions have now won seven in a row, the Crows have not.\nThey do get Taylor Walker and possibly Riley Thilthorpe, which they need, given they kicked just five goals last week.\nBrodie Smith is in doubt, as he is suffering from the most relatable injury ever ‘general soreness’.\nI always suffer from general soreness. It happens as you get older. I can injure myself while lying in bed, not moving.\nNext time someone asks, ‘how are you going?’ just say ‘general soreness.’\nI’m tipping the Lions.\nYou can help support me in producing this ridiculous nonsense I churn out on a regular basis.

Thank you. Thank you.\nWith your tip locked in, I can now safely place all my current savings, future savings, house, and first born child on Melbourne winning this match.\nMay 26, 2023\n\"I can’t think of many circumstances were...\"\n\"The result is their better...\"\nOh Titus. Didn't the teachers at St Aloysius Boys' School for the Overly Privileged teach you the difference between their/they're and were/where?\nMay 26, 2023\nGeneral soreness should be one of the options on the Application for Leave form at every workplace.\nMay 26, 2023\nFMD - tipping Fremantle? Is this some kind of reverse psychology? For the love of all that is good in 💜 & carries the sufficient burden of an ⚓️, please don’t mess with my head. Bring back real Titus.\nMay 26, 2023\nVery pretty brilliant, Titus. Love your “satire not really satire but still satirical” take. But take exception to the “here we go again” thought when StK lost badly to Adelaide. You’ve turned something deeply spiritual, to all StK supporters, into something almost dismissive.\nCameron Mooney being out injured KO’d is an interesting one. According to boxing rules, he has to be out for at least one month. According to AFL rules, he has to be out for at least 12 days. A tricky one for sporting authorities. Where’s John Douglas when you need him?\nMay 26, 2023\nWill Collingwood drop their badminton side literally made me laugh out loud!\nMay 26, 2023\nTurn it up Titus ... What do you know about babies ... that'll own babies with an addiction to Ripe Raspberries?? Con\nMay 26, 2023\nAt least hamstring awareness is specific; general soreness not so much. In hockey at least we have lower or upper body injury.\nMay 26, 2023\nLiked your Geelong injuries bit, leaving out Dangerfield was special. Geelong are my 18th favourite team too.\nMay 26, 2023\nGeneral Sorness 😂😂😂\nMay 26, 2023\nTitus how very deviously clever of yourself reprising Lou's Kiss of Death on old town 'Freo'. Blink! next round you shall be dusting off the cobwebs, checking the oil and other essential fluids on the vintage Rolls in the O'Reily garage plus brushing up the eyebrows for the annual pilgrimage to Princess Park. Bob's your uncle. Too bad it's been renamed Visy Park, the ramp's been removed and replaced by a monolithic lump of Kubrick. Demon's to win.\nMay 26, 2023\nSome years ago my name and the word \"testicle\" were mentioned in the same sentence in the media. Local news only, though.\nIt was in connection with that unfortunate incident with the mayor of Devonport's wife. I'm still not permitted to divulge the details. I can only say that at the time of the incident it was getting dark and there was a COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE misunderstanding on my part (in both senses of the word).\nMay 26, 2023\nHamstring strains and general body soreness are both legit reasons to take time off work. Used to play footy on a Sunday arvo, and took plenty of Monday’s off with general body soreness. Did a hammy big time and took 3 days off. Couldn’t reasonably be expected to walk to catch public transport. And not safe to drive a car. The GP I visited signed the sick certificate so all above board. Bit of a hassle getting the sick certificate—had to drive through peak traffic and couldn’t find a park nearby, so a 10 minute walk.\nMay 26, 2023\nWHY TITUS REALLY CHOSE THE SUNS\nTO BEAT THE BULLDOGS IN DARWIN\nThe shorter the flight\nThe stronger the bite.\nBy Saturday night\nWe'll know if he's right.\nMay 26, 2023\nYou think you're bad at golf, Titus? Whenever I play golf I only get to hit the ball 18 times, and on each occasion it disappears into a hole in the ground about the size of a tin of beans. Everyone else gets to hit the ball heaps of times.\nNunawading is lovely in June-\nmight have to visit there soon.\nThey're literary folks,\nwith their limericks and jokes,\nbut none can outshine the Full Moon.\nMay 26, 2023\nKeep up the poetry Gents. Elevates an already brilliant read.\nMay 26, 2023\nWow, Cameron Mooney is 43 years old and retired in 2011. Geelong are in deep shite if they expecting him to come back into the side.\nMay 26, 2023\nWith reference to \"one fell swoop\" - while that is the correct term, when talking about Carlton the oft-quoted \"one foul swoop\" is actually more appropriate.\nI also note, without comment, that the Carlton President was the CEO of PwC during the period now under some discussion in political circles. Still, with a past No.1 ticket holder list like Robert Menzies, Malcolm Fraser, John Elliott and Josh Frydenberg, they are used to political circles at Princes Park.\nMay 26, 2023\nDidn’t you see Robbie Flower ? !!\nMay 26, 2023\n@ JON HOLMES\nGood point.\nHis memory does seem to be pretty selective sometimes.\nA while ago he mocked the white headband that Aoron Naughton wears. When I read that I immediately thought \"Heavens to Carl Ditterich!\"\nMay 26, 2023\n‘…the trust fund baby of the league’.\nSo true, and so many years still to atone for the Elliot era.\nMay 26, 2023\nWest Coast sees the Geelong injury list and laughs in pitiful sobs. Except for Dom Sheed, his near fatal career threatening thorax injury hasn’t fully recovered.\nMay 26, 2023\nExcuse me sir! We’re the pokie-less, community outreach, slightly less rapey, Caroline Wilson-loving Roos! We’ll take the moral high ground anytime we damn well please.\nMay 26, 2023\nI just had a look at the fixture and it looks like the Pies have 3 byes in the next 4 rounds. Lucky the Daicos’ can have a lively 3 way kick to kick at home in the backyard to stay sharp.\nMay 27, 2023\nTitus, the best player in a Melbourne jumper was one R Flower. I saw him single handedly towel up the tigers and we had great wingers too!\nMay 27, 2023\nI lost money betting on Carlton last night, but still enjoyed the game immensely. All the way through the aftermath of the Essington 'supplements' scandal, one thing brought me comfort: the Blues are a basket case. David Teague? Oh, stop, I'm laughing too hard...\nMay 27, 2023\nOh, and please stop correcting TO's abysmal grammar. It's part of the charm.\nMay 27, 2023\nAbysmal grammar is definitely part of TO's charm. We just have to hope he never gets the idea that the more abysmal it gets the more charming it gets.\nMay 27, 2023\nOne of the funniest men in the world lmfao 😂\nMay 29, 2023\nVery cynical of you to tip Freo, Tittus. However the footy gods frown on this sort of thing and they gave you your comeuppance.\nLoved the write-up on Carlton. Can't wait for the MKNR.\nLoved the poetry and the comment from G Train about the Sainters' souls. It's only 1hr 27 min from Nunawading to Elsternwick by pushbike.\nCouldn't resist checking and the (current) Mayor of Davenport doesn't have a wife, only a partner called Pete. So I confidently infer your testicle incident happened a while back TEBS. I hope the testicle in question is back in good working order.\nMay 29, 2023\nAnd now everyone's wishing we copied his tips.\n(I tipped Freo, Port, Pies and Dons, so almost.)",
