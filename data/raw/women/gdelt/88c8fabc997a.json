  "body_text": "LINCOLN, Neb. — More than 7,000 miles separates the West African village in which Nkem Ogbechie was born from the Ventura County, Calif., home that he and his wife, Angela, selected to raise their family.\nThe path that Nkem journeyed in four decades is actually much longer.\nHis father, a former track and field star, practiced medicine in Nigeria. Nkem’s mother, an accomplished athlete, worked as a scientist. Nkem was the oldest of four siblings. His family moved to Boston when he was 3, so his parents could advance their careers.\nAdvertisement\n“They always reminded us,” he said, “that their athleticism didn’t pay the bills. It was their training, their education, their ambition, the work ethic.”\nAngela competed in four sports and was the valedictorian of her high school class in Southern California. She earned admission to Stanford and lived one door down and across the hall from Nkem as a freshman at Toyon Hall.\nHe was a defensive lineman on the football team. They met on Sept. 22, 1996, and married 10 years later after Angela received a Master of Business Administration degree from Columbia and Nkem earned the same from Rice. He later studied at Harvard, where his sister, Kaego, starred in volleyball. She was inducted into the Harvard Varsity Club Hall of Fame in 2022.\nIt was within this environment of high achievement that Manaia Ogbechie, the oldest of Nkem and Angela’s five children, was molded.\nToday, she brings instant energy as a true freshman reserve for the No. 1-ranked Nebraska volleyball team, a super sub on a super team. Nebraska is 20-0 and 10-0 in the Big Ten. The Huskers allow fewer than 16 points per set in conference play. They’ve swept 11 consecutive opponents to enter Friday at No. 11 Wisconsin, an 8 p.m. CT clash of rivals on Halloween.\nWhy is Nebraska so dominant?\n“Between our starters and our bench,” setter Bergen Reilly said, “we have two of the best teams in the country in the same gym.”\nAnd first-year coach Dani Busboom Kelly plays almost everyone, a shift from the style employed by her predecessor, four-time national champion John Cook.\nOgbechie has appeared in 16 of 66 sets at middle blocker for Nebraska this season. Despite limited opportunities, her impact is undeniable.\n“One word: insane,” senior Rebekah Allick said. “She’s going to be absolutely insane.”\nOgbechie would start at 99 percent of all college programs, Busboom Kelly said. But there is no brewing controversy in Lincoln. The Huskers start Allick, an intimidating presence, captain and the Huskers’ emotional leader, and junior Andi Jackson in the middle. Jackson, a returning first-team All-American, ranks among the most athletically gifted players nationally.\nSo for the 6-foot-3 Ogbechie, it means an occasional start or a set off the bench.\nAdvertisement\nThe strong play of the second team at Nebraska gives it almost an unfair advantage. Not only are the Huskers’ starters better than the competition, they’re also more rested.\nOgbechie’s .529 hitting efficiency leads all Big Ten players with 70 or more swings this season. Her kills per set (2.56) and blocks per set (1.38) top the group of Nebraska middle blockers.\n“She’s so dynamic,” Jackson said. “I’m really impressed with how calm she is and how she can go in and change the game.”\nOgbechie has been changing the game for most of her 18 years. She has no plans to stop.\nManaia Ogbechie 😤\nNo. 1 @HuskerVB gets the 3-0 win to advance to 19-0 on the season. pic.twitter.com/IQi7csg1j1\n— Big Ten Volleyball (@B1GVolleyball) October 25, 2025\nNkem and Angela Ogbechie established a series of principles to guide them in building lives with their children: family, competition, education, faith, fun and good health, among others.\n“If there’s ever a question of what we should do,” Nkem said, “where we should go, how we do it, it’s going to be with these things in mind.”\nThe children traveled with their parents last year to the South Pacific to learn about Angela’s Samoan heritage. They’ve visited Central and South America, Europe and Asia. Manaia and her siblings attended Caltech’s summer coding camp and logic camp at Stanford. They visited UCLA’s innovation center.\n“I grew up with my parents always telling me that education is first,” Manaia said. “They just love to learn.”\nNkem and Angela enrolled their children in a Kumon learning program. It requires hours of study and tutoring beyond schoolwork. Manaia started at age 3. She was learning calculus early in her elementary school years.\n“The woman is brilliant,” Allick said.\nCoaches at Nebraska and her father use the same word to describe Manaia.\n“Well beyond her years,” assistant coach Brennan Hagar said.\nAdvertisement\nUntil about three years ago, in fact, Manaia gave little consideration to a collegiate career in volleyball. She saw herself as too studious and planned to spend a semester abroad in France.\nMaybe she would follow her parents into business. Angela works as the chief supply chain officer for Deckers, the producer of Hoka, Ugg and Teva footwear. Nkem is the head of operations strategy for Amgen, a large biotech company.\nOr perhaps Manaia would take the path of her aunt, Kaego, who graduated from volleyball at Harvard for the investments industry, then turned toward work as a business adviser, entrepreneur and author.\nAs a high school freshman at Oaks Christian School, Manaia didn’t know how to hit a quick set, the fundamental swing for an offensive player at the middle of the net in volleyball. A year later, in 2022 as her interest and skill level in the sport grew, Manaia traveled to Omaha for the final weekend of the NCAA tournament.\nLouisville, coached by Busboom Kelly, beat Pittsburgh and lost to Texas for the national championship.\n“That’s when I became a Dani fan,” Manaia said.\nShe blossomed on the court and received exposure in the U.S. national team development program, with which Nebraska assistant Jaylen Reyes assists.\n“As it turned out,” Nkem said, “Manaia was really good at volleyball.”\n“I just hope I can inspire somebody.”\nIncoming @HuskerVB middle @ManaiaOgbechie explains her “why” behind playing volleyball. ♥️ pic.twitter.com/EXhoDiJKe0\n— Hail Varsity (@HailVarsity) January 29, 2025\nPriorities shifted. Manaia looked at UCLA and Ivy League schools. She initially committed to play volleyball at Northwestern, viewing it as the best mix of academia and athletics.\nLast year as her career aspirations came into focus, Manaia reconsidered. After graduate school, she aims to climb the ladder in athletics. Her goal? To work as a Division I athletic director or as the general manager for a professional volleyball franchise.\n“Volleyball became so important to me, I couldn’t ignore it anymore,” she said.\nAdvertisement\nSo instead of studying alongside brilliant minds at her aunt’s alma mater, Manaia practices daily with numerous former five-star recruits, four returning All-Americans and Olympic hopefuls.\n“For now,” Nkem said, “there is no better school for volleyball than Nebraska. Period, full stop.”\nNebraska allows her access to a 24-sport athletic department, flush with Big Ten money and resources. She chose a double major in the College of Business in management and marketing.\nVolleyball and her career focus inevitably mix. But Manaia strives to maintain a separation to keep balance in her life.\nLast winter and spring, four of her freshmen teammates enrolled at Nebraska to get a jump on volleyball. Manaia graduated early from high school and stayed in Los Angeles to work as a research assistant for a TV show, “Women’s Sports Now,” and as an intern for I Love to Watch You Play, a program designed to help parents navigate youth sports.\nThe seismic coaching change at Nebraska in January did not faze her. Busboom Kelly paid Manaia and her family a visit. The new coach saw the Stanford logo stamped on the playing court out back at the Ogbechie home. All was good.\nAfter Manaia got to Nebraska early this summer, Nkem and Angela purchased a condo in downtown Lincoln. They use it as their base to travel from California and support Manaia. Her sister, Masina, a senior in high school, is committed to Harvard. Sister Malie is a high school sophomore and a volleyball prospect. Brothers Malosi and Manu, in eighth and second grades, play football and basketball.\nNkem and Angela raised Manaia to set an example for her siblings.\n“Don’t be a jackass,” her father told her, “because your brother is watching.”\nShe has taken the advice to heart. Manaia went to her sisters and brothers, not her parents, to seek guidance on her college decision.\n“My siblings are the reason I do everything,” she said.\nAdvertisement\nThe source of her motivation removes pressure from Manaia on the volleyball court. Her thought process helps explain the ease of her transition to fit as a key piece on the top-ranked team in her sport.\n“I’m not here playing for myself,” Manaia said. “I’m playing for so many other things. The team being the first, but also what I’m representing. That’s my Samoan and Nigerian ancestry. That’s my siblings.\n“When I’m on the court, it’s for everybody else. And that makes it so easy.”",
