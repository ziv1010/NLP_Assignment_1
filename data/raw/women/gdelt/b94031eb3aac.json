About a dozen players on the squad were on the 2018 team or 2022 team and have followed Ikeda to the big time.\nThe backline will be anchored by captain Saki Kumagai, who is playing in her fourth World Cup. And leading the midfield will be Manchester City's Yui Hasegawa.\nKumagai scored the winning penalty in a shootout when Japan beat the Americans 12 years ago for the title. She is the only player remaining from the 2011 squad, and the 32-year-old recently joined AS Roma from Bayern Munich.\nAlmost half of the 23-woman squad is made up players competing in leagues in Europe or North America. The rest are playing at home in Japan's WE League. Clearly Japan — a traditional leader in women's soccer — is trying to keep up as the game keeps expanding and improving.\n“I believe that the speed of growth of women’s football in the world, including various environmental aspects, is developing at a tremendous momentum right now,” Ikeda said.\nIn addition to Hasegawa, some of the scoring punch is also likely to come from overseas-based players such as Angel City forward Jun Endo, Hina Sugita of the Portland Thorns, West Ham’s Honoka Hayashi, and Liverpool’s Fuka Nagano.\nEndo is recovering from a left knee injury and is the easiest player to spot: she is the darting left-footer with the pink hair who has become a favorite in Los Angeles. People expect things to happen when she touches the ball, and she has promised to get a fresh hair coloring — still pink — for the World Cup.\n“She is a player who is trying new things in search of her own development in the American league,” Ikeda said. “Her speed and strong, accurate kick with a solid left foot will be a plus for the team.”\nAyaka Yamashita is expected to get the start in goal.\nJapan often faces a size deficit in many matches, but its technical level might be the best in the world.\n“Of course it is important to develop athletic players who are fast and big,” Ikeda said. “However, physical ability is not just about being fast and big, it also includes agility, which I think is one of the strong points of Japanese players. So I want to take advantage of that strength that we have.”\nJapan plays its Group C games in New Zealand, opening against Zambia at Hamilton on July 22, followed by Costa Rica on July 26 in Dunedin and Spain on July 31 in Wellington.\nJapan, ranked No. 11 by FIFA, will be an overwhelming favorite against Zambia and Costa Rica. The game with No. 6-ranked Spain is likely to be for the top spot in the group.\n“First of all, it’s the World Cup, so I don’t think the FIFA rankings and other such numbers are of any help,\" Ikeda said. \" Above all, I think Zambia will be well prepared for the first game of the tournament, so I think it will be important for us as well to be fully prepared for the first game.”\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",
