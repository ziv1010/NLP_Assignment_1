  "body_text": "As expected, Arsenal Women were not in the business of making Chelsea’s life at the Molineux easy in this Women’s League Cup final. There was a lot of back and forth between the two sides, until Arsenal began winning more challenges and showing more quality upfront while Chelsea had to rely on the talents of Lauren James, Mayra Ramírez and co..\nArsenal WFC 1-0 (a.e.t) Chelsea FCW, Women’s League Cup final: Post-match reaction\nGame management gap\nOn one such occasion, Mayra managed to hit the back of the net on a superb effort from her. But the goal was disallowed due to Erin Cuthbert’s handball in the buildup.\nArsenal continued to press for goals, with loads of missed shots and tension building up from Chelsea’s defence not doing a good enough job of keeping harm away from Hannah Hampton’s area. At the same time not even VAR could save us from the horrifying refereeing in English football, which is arguably worse in the women’s game.\nAt half-time the only change made by Emma Hayes was changing the armband, from Niamh Charles to Erin Cuthbert. Otherwise Chelsea kept struggling, and were only saved by Arsenal’s bad aim and Hannah’s good parries.\nWith neither team able to score a goal in 90 minutes of play, we headed to extra time. The match balance didn’t change as Arsenal got the lion’s share of chances to score, and Chelsea couldn’t find much to answer them.\nIt felt it was only a matter of time until Arsenal got their goal. That finally happened on minute 116, via Stina Blackstenius.\n- The strongest lineup we could muster, with Hannah Hampton between the posts and Mayra Ramírez leading the charge upfront.\n- VAR not in use to review Lauren James being tripped in the box, but quickly called to nullify Mayra Ramírez’s opener.\n- You can touch the ball with your hands in the area as an inline player, as long as you are wearing an Arsenal jersey. Them’s the rules!\n- Get well soon, Frida Maanum!\n- Emma’s second substitution made at minute 95.\n- Baffling game management from the boss today. Even though the starters didn’t perform up to standards today, there were several decisions from Emma that would have been long questioned if she wasn’t leaving the club by the end of the season.\n- Next up: Manchester United away in the FA Cup semi-final.\n- KTBFFH.",
