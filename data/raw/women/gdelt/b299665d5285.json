Eventually, both players headed back towards the locker room with Gauff chatting to members of her team until the disruption was handled.\nThe US Open became the latest sports event to be impacted by climate protesters railing against the use of fossil fuels.\nAt Wimbledon in July, two matches were interrupted when activists got onto Court 18 and threw orange confetti on the grass.\nFossil fuel protester is dragged out by security at the #USOpen.

Just Stop Oil describes itself as a “nonviolent civil resistance group demanding the UK Government stop licensing all new oil, gas and coal projects.”\nGauff, a 19-year-old American, and Muchova, a 27-year-old from the Czech Republic, were both playing in the semifinals at Flushing Meadows for the first time.\nThe other women’s semifinal, between Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus and Madison Keys of the United States, was set to begin after Gauff vs. Muchova finished.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments",
