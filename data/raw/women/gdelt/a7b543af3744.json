The Chelsea vs West Ham and Arsenal vs Crystal Palace games are London derbies, while Manchester City v United should be an exciting Manchester Derby, held at Etihad stadium.\nThe #BarclaysWSL is BACK this week! 🤩 pic.twitter.com/i4oWFyEeCp\n— Barclays Women’s Super League (@BarclaysWSL) January 13, 2025\nBased on the current WSL standings and upcoming fixtures, here’s my prediction for the top 4 teams this weekend:\n- Chelsea (28 points) are set to face West Ham United away. Given Chelsea’s strong form and West Ham’s struggles this season, Chelsea are likely to secure a win and maintain their lead at the top of the table.\n- Manchester City (22 points) will host Manchester United in the Manchester Derby at the Etihad Stadium. This match could be closely contested, but Manchester City may have a slight edge playing at home.\n- Arsenal (21 points) will play against bottom-placed Crystal Palace at Meadow Park. Arsenal are heavy favorites and expected to secure a comfortable win – this is potentially a great chance for our Gunners to improve their goal difference.\n- Manchester United (21 points) face a tough away fixture against Manchester City. While they’re level on points with Arsenal, this challenging match could see them drop points.\nMy anticipated changes to the WSL table by the end of Sunday:\n- Chelsea are likely to extend their lead at the top if they win and Manchester City drop.\n- Arsenal could potentially overtake Manchester City for second place if they win and City lose or draw.\n- The gap between the top 4 and the rest of the table may widen further, as 5th-placed Brighton & Hove Albion (17 points) face Liverpool away.\n- At the bottom, Crystal Palace (5 points) may fall further behind if they lose to Arsenal, while Leicester City (6 points) could potentially move out of the relegation zone if they manage a positive result against Tottenham.\nThese predictions are based on current form and standings, but the unpredictable nature of football means surprises are always possible.\nCity vs Manchester United is the highly anticipated Manchester derby.\nThe Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium will feature a special “Matchday Live” event.\nKick-off is set for 18:45 (UK time) on Sky Sports.\nWhat results will you be hoping for this weekend Gooners?\nMichelle M\nFollow JustArsenal’s Gooner Women on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Womens Team!\nDo you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team?
