  "body_text": "NewsFisk, Höbinger and Fahey take the honours at LFC Women's end-of-season awards\nGrace Fisk was named Liverpool FC Women Players’ Player of the Year as Marie Höbinger took Young Player of the Year during a ceremony at the AXA Melwood Training Centre on Thursday.\nFisk, signed from West Ham United in the summer, has been a model of consistency at the back for Matt Beard’s side and was the unanimous choice by her teammates.\nAustria international Höbinger, who recently became the first player in Barclays Women’s Super League history to get a hat-trick of assists from corners, finished ahead of Mia Enderby to pick up the young-player prize.\nCaptain Niamh Fahey also received The Red Way award in recognition for the way she represents the club’s values on and off the pitch.\nLiverpool bring the 2023-24 season to a close on Saturday when they travel to Leicester City for a 3pm BST kick-off in the WSL.\nBeard’s charges require just a point to secure a fourth-placed finish ahead of Manchester United, who host title-chasing Chelsea at Old Trafford.\nAhead of the trip to King Power Stadium, Fisk and Höbinger sat down with Liverpoolfc.com to talk about their pride at receiving the awards and look ahead to the final outing of the campaign…\nOn winning their individual awards…\nFisk: It makes it really special that my teammates have voted for me. They get to see me day in, day out over the course of the year, so it means a lot and I really appreciate them and thank them for their votes. It is my first full season at Liverpool but it’s mad because it feels like I’ve been here for ages, and obviously it has been a great season in the WSL. We just hope we can kick on again next season.\nHöbinger: It feels special. Coming in during the summer was a lot and I’m just happy I could bring on the pitch what I wanted to. I think it’s an amazing team and they make it very easy for us to play alongside them.\nOn how well the team have performed this season…\nFisk: In pre-season we sat down and spoke about aspirations and the aim was as high as possible. So to be where we are in the WSL right now with the possibility of clinching fourth, I think we would have bit your hand off at that in pre-season. We’ve obviously had big results against the top three or four teams which have been really special. The first game of the season away at Arsenal set us up really nicely and although that feels like ages ago now, those big wins meant a lot and have carried us throughout the season.\nHöbinger: I think there is something really special about this group and everyone is very hard-working. I think everyone wants to leave their hearts on the pitch for everyone else and I think that makes it special. That’s why we had highlight games like we did against Chelsea and Manchester United during the last week and it’s fun playing like that.\nYou have to accept cookies in order to view this content on our site.\nWatch on YouTubeOn becoming the first player in WSL history to get a hat-trick of assists from corners…\nHöbinger: We work on them [set-pieces] a lot and I think, for me, every corner is the same and I try to put the ball in areas where obviously the big girls can go for them. I’m happy that they scored. I don’t really care about the amount of assists, I think it’s just great we got the goals. Set-plays are important in football and we know that as well.\nOn Saturday’s WSL season finale at Leicester…\nFisk: Last game of the season, this means a lot and with fourth spot on the line we are obviously going there to get all three points. Leicester are a tough team, they are very aggressive in the way they play and as you can see from the season we have been up and down against them. We’ve been training really hard these last few weeks and hopefully we can end the season on a high.",
