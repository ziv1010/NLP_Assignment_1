  "body_text": "The OTHER Tom Silvagni 'incident' at Rich Lister's house - we reveal his open secret before arrest. Plus, Bianca's new Collingwood pad - and the real reason Lambo Guy wants to buy failed Derrimut gym: COSTELLO'S MELBOURNE\n- In our brand-new gossip column, Melbourne's ultimate insider Seb Costello uncovers the city's biggest bust-ups, power moves and backroom whispers – straight from the major players of sport, media and politics\nPacker's hometown horror\nJames Packer spent years growing Melbourne's Crown Casino into an international giant - but he's a Bondi boy at heart. He lived there for more than 20 years.\nThe terrifying events that unfolded on Sunday - which saw 15 innocent people killed when father-and-son gunmen allegedly opened fire at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration - have left their mark on the former resident.\n'I'm horrified. Absolutely horrified,' Packer told me.\nPacker's old pad was barely 100m from the footbridge where the Bondi shooters - one dead, the other in custody - carried out their rampage.\n'This is not the Bondi I know,' Packer told me.\nWhen I caught up with Packer on the phone, he was in South America, enjoying some sunshine with his three teenage children.\nHe is preparing to spend Christmas in Australia for the first time in five years with his 87-year-old mother Roslyn.\nJames Packer spent years growing Melbourne's Crown into an international giant - but he's a Bondi boy at heart, and was shattered by Sunday's shooting. 'I'm horrified,' Packer told me\nThe events that unfolded on Sunday, which saw 15 people killed when father-and-son gunmen allegedly opened fire at a Hanukkah celebration, left their mark on the former resident\nIt'll be an emotional homecoming for the mogul formerly known as 'Jamie', with Boxing Day marking 20 years since the death of his father, late media tycoon Kerry.\nTom's bad reputation\nThere's an interesting story doing the rounds about convicted rapist Tom Silvagni.\nThe suggestion is that Tom - who is being sentenced today - has an alleged history of not taking 'no' for an answer when it comes to women.\nI've heard allegations he once acted inappropriately towards a girl - not his rape victim - at the home of a prominent Melbourne philanthropist.\nYesterday, I spoke with the Rich Lister in question. She insists the story is 'hearsay' and that she's never personally witnessed an 'incident' involving Tom.\nBut among the alumni of Melbourne's fancy APS institutions, Tom's reputation for 'going too far' was an open secret.\nI heard that from the mother of daughters who run in the same crowd as Silvagni.\nTom Silvagni (left) arrives at Melbourne's County Court with his mother Jo (centre, back), father Stephen (right) and defence barrister David Hallowes SC (centre right) on November 24\nI'm aware of allegations that Tom (pictured in his court sketch) once acted inappropriately towards a girl - not his rape victim - at the home of a prominent Melbourne multimillionaire\nLast Friday, the woman who was raped by Tom at his family's former Balwyn North home in January 2024 read her victim impact statement to the court.\n'No matter how many times I told you [to] stop or tried to wriggle out of your grip, you didn't,' she said, as Silvagni watched on via video link from remand.\nThat same afternoon, I spied another Xavier College old boy, AFL CEO Andrew Dillon, deep in conversation as he strolled around The Tan track, the 3.8km gravel path around Melbourne's Botanical Gardens.\nIt was a big day for the league, what with the Silvagni name being one of football's most famous. Dillon had no time to stop for a chat with this columnist.\nThe AFL in general has been swerving the topic.\nHead office hasn't been brought into the case, publicly or privately. When we reached out to the league this week for comment, we were effectively told, 'Next question'.\nIt will be a very interesting pre-season at St Kilda FC, however.\nTom's father, Stephen Silvagni, is the club's list manager. He's among the safest officials at St Kilda - a known favourite of coach Ross Lyon.\nAnd brother Jack is hoping to play his first game for the Saints next year, though his training has been delayed due to a groin injury.\nAll eyes will be on Jo Silvagni and whether she continues to be the face of Chemist Warehouse\nWhile no one holds them responsible for Tom's crime, the Silvagnis will no doubt be asked about the case when the players return over summer.\nMatriarch Jo Silvagni may also be having tricky conversations with her employer Chemist Warehouse, for whom she has been a long-time team member and valued contributor.\nShe isn't to blame for what Tom did, of course, but reports she stared at her son's victim from the front of the court weren't exactly flattering.\nBianca bunkers in Collingwood\nBianca Censori, better known as Mrs Kanye West, recently set up a bolthole in Melbourne's inner-north.\nRumour has it Ye helped Bianca pick out the multimillion-dollar pad in trendy Collingwood, an apt location for the 30-year-old, given her latest foray into the arts.\nCensori's recent artistic endeavour took place in Seoul, South Korea.\nSporting a red, skintight catsuit, Censori made a deep, meaningful artistic comment about domestic duties... I think?\nI recently caught up with a former flame of Bianca's.\nRumour has it Melbourne girl Bianca Censori has found a multimillion-dollar pad in Collingwood\nBianca, better known as Mrs Kanye West, is seen in her pre-fame days\n'Kanye was a rebound from me,' the elite sportsman joked over coffee.\nHe also noted that Bianca was something of a social media exhibitionist even before she started dating the divisive rapper.\nWe didn't press the topic.\nStill, good luck to Bianca, we say.\nShe's a genuine home-grown celebrity. Her name is famous from Brunswick to Boise.\nAnd she has certainly surpassed this columnist as the most famous alumnus of Carey Baptist Grammar.\nMokbel considers his options\nIn a nursery in Melbourne's eastern suburbs, I bumped into a close associate of one Tony Mokbel.\nIt's been a few months since the convicted drug trafficker walked from court a free man.\nThis individual I saw was heavily involved in Mokbel's Brunswick-based syndicate back in the day. He'd also done significant jail time.\nI introduced myself to the Mokbel mate. He recognised me from TV, so I made a point of putting my phone on the floor - I wanted him to know that I wasn't recording him.\nWe talked about recent events, including Tony's newfound freedom.\nEventually, I got to the point.\n'Could you help me land an interview with Tony Mokbel? He's got a hell of a story and I want to tell it.'\nI recently bumped into a close associate of one Tony Mokbel. He's not rushing into a tell-all interview after being freed from jail and is said to be exploring his legal avenues\nI'm not the only one who wants the first-hand account of Fat Tony & Co.\nThe big-budget brands of network television are buzzing around too.\n'Ultimately, it's up to Tony,' the man said initially. I won't share all the details of what he said next.\nBut if you're holding your breath for a Mokbel tell-all early next year, you're at risk of oxygen deprivation.\nThere's still a pile of legal avenues for Mokbel to explore before he starts speaking out.\nFor one, he'll be looking at wrongful conviction and other proceedings related to the use of his lawyer Nicola Gobbo as a police informant.\nGyms circle debt-laden Derrimut\nFor a decade, Derrimut 24:7 was Melbourne's fastest-growing fitness brand - think big spaces and big boys with loaded-up barbells.\nAnd don't forget the girls with bolt-ons, sleeve tattoos and OnlyFans accounts.\nFlashy founder Nick Solomos swagged around in gold chains and sports cars.\nBut all that glitters is not gold.\nDerrimut 24:7, with its 26 gyms in Victoria and South Australia, is now in administration with debts of $40million.\n'The Derrimut set-ups were world class. The equipment was high quality. But the membership fees were way too cheap,' said Tony Doherty, founder of Doherty's Gym in Brunswick.\nDoherty is a good mate of Arnold Schwarzenegger. He hosted the Arnold Classic expos in Melbourne for a number of years.\n'Derrimut were doing memberships for $99 a year. That wouldn't cover anywhere near the costs of a member,' Doherty added of the chain's questionable price point.\n'I've never understood how that model works. I wouldn't take the company over.'\nStill, some people are interested. Among them, Adrian 'Lambo Guy' Portelli.\nNick Solomos, the flashy founder of Victorian gym chain Derrimut 24:7, swagged around in gold chains and sports cars. But all that glitters is not gold\nAdrian 'Lambo Guy' Portelli made an offer for battered gym chain Derrimut 24:7. It was knocked back by the administrators\nOther businesses linked to a Derrimut 24:7 takeover include Revo Fitness, founded by ex-cricketer Andrew Holder (pictured)\nAdministrators HM Advisory have declined Portelli's latest offer, but apparently the flamboyant businessman isn't finished - despite him saying 'I've had to pull out'.\nPortelli, who rose to fame as a Lamborghini-driving prolific buyer on Nine's The Block, amassed a fortune through his membership club, LMCT+.\nFitness sources suspect that Portelli, in addition to wanting to break into the gym business, saw significant potential in converting the high-value Derrimut 24:7 clientele into LMCT+ members.\nOther businesses linked to a Derrimut 24:7 takeover include Revo Fitness and IronHub 24/7.\nRevo is the wallet-friendly fitness brand founded by ex-cricketer Andrew Holder. It has its fair share of critics, who say the low prices make it too teeny bopper.\n'Revo's full of school bags and kids on Snapchat,' a rival gym owner told me.\nIronHub 24/7 is a traditional muscle Mecca. It has two sites in the city's south-east.\nThe bodybuilding focus makes its business a closer cousin of Derrimut 24:7, with the team looking to expand into Pakenham and Ballarat in the near future.\nDuring my chat with Doherty, he threw another name into the mix: World Gym.\n'They are doing an astonishing job with their expansion into Australia too. Keep an eye on them. They're going big here and they are doing the industry right,' he said.",
