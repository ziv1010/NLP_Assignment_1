  "body_text": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — It’s 8:34 a.m. Wednesday at MetLife Stadium, where a dozen workers are seen tending to the recently rolled-out pitch inside the 82,500-seat NFL venue. As the sun grows stronger, making this 70-degree morning feel closer to 76, workers walk the length of the grass field, examining every inch of its surface.\nAdvertisement\nThey walk slowly, placing orange flags on troublesome areas. Workers with rakes will soon return to those spots for reinspection. They stomp on the ground at the visible seams between patches of turf, tugging at its surface to seemingly smooth out any imperfections.\n“This is a year in the making,” says Blair Christiansen, the venue’s pitch manager for the Club World Cup this summer. “While the turf has come in, in the last 24 hours, this has been 12 months of research trials, grow-ins and sign-offs.”\nDelivered via 23 truckloads from a turf farm 94 miles away in Hammonton, N.J., this pitch will set the stage for the first of eight Club World Cup games hosted at MetLife this summer. The first will feature Brazilian side Palmeiras against Portugal’s Porto on Sunday, with the tournament’s grand finale set here for July 13.\nWhat the workers were doing here Wednesday will be repeated over and over as the tournament rolls on for “continued quality control,” as Christiansen described it.\n“It’s a pretty robust process of relaying turf from 100 miles away, and then there’s this continued quality piece that we’ll be doing for days leading into the first game and right through until the last game,” he said. “It’s all about quality.”\nPitch quality at the Club World Cup will certainly be top of mind over the next month.\nThe tournament is serving as a trial run for FIFA to master the quality of its playing surfaces ahead of the men’s World Cup next year. At MetLife this is especially important because the venue is hosting the finals of both competitions and is staging the most games of any U.S. stadium selected by FIFA for both tournaments.\nPlaying surfaces were a top concern at last year’s Copa America, which was organized by CONMEBOL. Following the opening match at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta between Canada and Argentina, Argentina’s players and head coach Lionel Scaloni criticized the playing surface. Some even said it felt like playing on a “trampoline.”\nAdvertisement\nIn the 12 months leading into the Club World Cup, FIFA studied which grass type would be best for the New Jersey venue, landing on a “warm-season grass” it believes will endure the local elements. The grass was grown at Tuckahoe Turf Farms, which is also responsible for the grass being grown for the men’s World Cup in 2026.\nPreparations included inputting lessons from last year’s Copa America, too.\n“That’s part of the process. If we weren’t cognizant of some of the feedback of that, it’d be naive,” Christiansen said. “We’ve taken that feedback, and in the past 12 months, we’ve made some alterations to the profile, with alterations to the actual turf itself. We think with the improved knowledge and technology, it’ll be a different surface.”\nSome of those changes include making sure the turf is “not sitting on a concrete pad anymore,” Christiansen said. “I suspect that not to be as firm — that was some of the (feedback) comments. We’ve introduced the stabilized fiber technology into it and sort of given it a bit more resilience, as well.”\nChristiansen said player feedback was also considered as part of their continuing process.\n“This is their careers,” Christiansen said. “They train for decades, some of them, and for them to be able to showcase the skills that they’ve developed in that time, the surface plays an integral role in that. (With) higher-quality surface, you’re likely to see some high-quality football as well.”\nThe stadium, shared by the NFL’s New York Giants and New York Jets, usually features a synthetic turf year-round. This specific pitch was long considered one of the worst surfaces to play on in the NFL but received a major facelift before the 2023 NFL season that included a new turf selection. Still, the NFL Players Association has long preferred natural surfaces for players, with the Club World Cup reigniting that debate this week.\nAdvertisement\nThe FIFA competitions staged at MetLife these next two summers will feature natural grass, before returning to a synthetic surface for the NFL.\nThe pitch for the Club World Cup has a “unique profile,” Christiansen says. FIFA has built a “drainage layer” below the surface, lifting the turf about six inches higher than where it stands throughout the year, forming a two-inch stabilized sod. The sod has “an 85-millimeter drainage cell with a geotextile layer beneath the cell,” he said.\n“It seems to be what we believe will be an outstanding surface for the tournament,” said Christiansen, who also worked with FIFA to oversee the grounds at Eden Park in Auckland, New Zealand, for the Women’s World Cup in 2023.\nThe natural grass pitch at MetLife is also surrounded by an artificial pitch, which, Christiansen says, “many stadiums around the world do.” He called it “an evolution of knowledge” that allows for the natural surface to be more easily maintained. It’s hard to ignore, as the artificial turf is much darker.\n“Over time, we worked out that having a synthetic ring road around the natural turf surface is the best for the tournament,” Christiansen said. “There’s a lot of ancillary work that happens outside the field, and if we can keep more people off the grass than on the grass, that’s great, and it gives them access as well, without having to try and maintain turf in some pretty challenging environments with some pretty pressing needs.”\nSome of those needs in New Jersey include adjusting to blistering heat and summer storms. This week, temperatures in the region reached the mid-80s to low-90s, with Thursday considered one of the warmest days of the year. This weekend, the local forecast is calling for cooler temps and a 45 percent chance of rain Sunday, as of Friday afternoon. Those predictions, however, change by the hour.\nFlash storms are also common, with a lot of rain accumulating quickly over a short time. Tuesday, Christiansen estimated the pitch endured just over half an inch of rain in two hours. “That was a brilliant test for the turf itself,” he said. “The turf is actually sand, (which) drains outstandingly well.”\nAdvertisement\nChristiansen described how, on Tuesday, while others sheltered from the rain, he was out on the pitch, walking the turf with an umbrella. He was “trying to understand exactly how it took that rain.” He examined things like where the water went, how quickly it dried, the firmness of the surface and how it felt under his feet.\n“From what I saw, I don’t know how many events are going to be as heavy as it was (Tuesday), but this turf stood up. No problems.”\nThe pitch installation began Monday and was set to be completed within a six-day window by Sunday’s opening game at MetLife. “There’s no doubt there’s some challenges here,” Christiansen said. “The time frame is challenging, but we wouldn’t have taken it on. FIFA is really comfortable, with the processes over the last year, that this can be achieved.”\nEach venue’s turf is tailored to its own specific needs. However, FIFA’s goal is for players to experience consistency in playing-surface conditions from venue to venue across the tournament. Five stadiums — Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, Lumen Field in Seattle and MetLife — will also host matches for the men’s World Cup in 2026.\n“It’s a learning exercise for both FIFA and the venues,” Christiansen said. “There’s no better lead-in to next year (than) by actually test-running the venues and the turf. What I’ve seen so far (at MetLife) has exceeded expectations in terms of the quality, and I’m sure next year we’ll be ramping up with another 12-month lead-in to be even better.”\nAs for the turf used at MetLife for the Club World Cup this summer, Christiansen said, “We believe this is the grass for the future of FIFA here.”\n(Photo: Robbie Jay Barratt / AMA / Getty Images)",
