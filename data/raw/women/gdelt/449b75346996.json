The former First Lady, 59, was snapped during an outing in Spain on Wednesday, when she met with former Spanish ambassador James Costos - whom her husband worked with during his time as President. While Michelle kept a straight face during the meeting, she channeled a cool and calm aura with her vacation-ready outfit, sporting a... -\nTrump flips burgers and throws footballs at frat house before the Iowa-Iowa State game\nFormer President Donald Trump made an appearance at an agricultural fraternity house on Saturday before the annual Iowa-Iowa State football game between the Hawkeyes and the Cyclones where he was seen flipping burgers and throwing footballs.

Many are shocked to see so many RINOs in leadership roles in the Lone Star State. But it makes sense when you consider Texas’s long history of establishment politics. It’s a sad reminder that the establishment won’t back down easily, and they’re not afraid to get in the gutter and play dirty; as we can see with Paxton’s impeachment trial. Fortunately, Paxton’s legal team is skinning the RINOs as we speak. ... As it stands, the... -\nStudy Finds 75 Percent of U.S. Banks Didn’t Hedge Interest Rate Risk; Unrealized Losses on Securities $516 Billion at End of First Quarter\nA group of academics have conducted a study that found that during the fastest pace of Fed interest rate hikes in 40 years, the majority of U.S. banks failed to hedge their interest rate risk. The report’s findings include the following: “Over three quarters of all reporting banks report no material use of interest rate swaps.” “Only 6% of aggregate assets in the U.S. banking system are hedged by interest rate swaps.” “Banks with the most fragile funding – i.e., those with highest uninsured leverage — sold or reduced their hedges during the monetary tightening. This allowed them to record... -\nAmerica’s Coco Gauff tops Aryna Sabalenka to win US Tennis Open\nCoco Gauff beat No. 2-seeded Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 to win the US Open for her first major title.

Matthew Sowash, the president and CEO of Holy Ground Tiny Homes, failed to deliver tiny homes to 189 buyers while spending hundreds of thousands on seemingly personal purchases, KDVR reported. The nonprofit company spent more than $400,000 to buy and repair race cars and other vehicles in addition to $35,000 in real estate in Colorado and Alaska, according to an 81-page report filed Friday and... -\nStaten Island migrant shelter suffering a sewage crisis that stinks up the neighborhood as residents complain the building was never suitable to house people - 'It's disgusting and nobody should be subject to that'\nThe migrant crisis worsens in New York City as a Staten Island shelter continues to cause hygiene issues in the area. School turned controversial shelter, St. John Villa Academy is currently housing nearly 300 migrants, something it was never built to do. The 67-year-old building is currently acting as full-time residence and bathroom for the migrants in the area. Due to the age and purpose of the building, it was never meant for 24/7 use, and the ejector pumps are incapable of moving huge quantities of raw sewage into the city's sewers. To address the issue, a septic-treatment company visits... -\nWorld’s Oldest Computer and Ancient Greeks’ View of the Universe\nA bronze artifact salvaged from an ancient Greek shipwreck, recognized as the world’s oldest computer, may hold the secrets of the universe.When we talk of the history of computers, most of us will refer to the evolution of the modern digital desktop PC, charting the decades-long developments by the likes of Apple and Microsoft. What many don’t consider, however, is that computers have been around much longer. In fact, they date back millennia to a time when they were analog creations. Today, the world’s oldest known “computer” is the Antikythera mechanism, a corroded bronze artifact which was found at the... -\nAncient Roman Mosaic Reveals Women Wore Bikini\nA mosaic from an Roman villa in Sicily depicts ten women wearing an ancient version of the two-piece bikini.

The Villa Romana del Casale, located in Sicily, dates back to the early fourth century AD. Among the ruins, archeologists have discovered one of the largest collections of ancient Roman mosaics. All of them are surprisingly well preserved. One of the rooms of the villa is called Sala delle Dieci... -\nWhy thousands of U.S. congregations are leaving the United Methodist Church\nBishop Karen Oliveto sees her consecration in 2016 as a breaking point for some of the thousands of people who have made the once unthinkable decision to leave the United Methodist Church. Oliveto is the church's first openly gay bishop and oversees congregations in Colorado, Montana, Utah, Wyoming and one church in Idaho. Her service defies long-standing rules in the denomination. Disregard for those church laws is fueling divisions that have already led to the exodus of about 20% of the United Methodist Church's congregations across the U.S. since disaffiliations began in 2019. The number of members who have left... -\nPro-Life Protesters Could Face Up to 10 Years in Prison: ‘Political Witch Hunt’\nDOJ is accusing pro-life activists for violating FACE ActFour more defendants facing federal charges over an October 2020 \"rescue action\" protest at a Washington, D.C.-based abortion clinic will begin trial this week.

Indeed, it has yet to get beyond the so-called “grey zone,” the heavily contested strip of land that lies in front of the first main line of Russian defenses. The New York Times reports that “In the first two weeks of the counteroffensive, as much as 20 percent of the weaponry Ukraine sent to the battlefield was damaged or destroyed, according to U.S. and European officials. The toll included some of the... -\nAmerica First Legal Launches Follow-up Investigation After Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office Withholds Censorship Records\nMA AG’s Office Claims Censorship Records Could Reveal “Law Enforcement Matters” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, America First Legal (AFL) filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General regarding the existence and number of law enforcement investigations relating to misinformation or disinformation based on information it revealed in response to our investigation.

The extraordinary advice came at a feisty press conference in Jacksonville this week that was also marred by an unseemly shouting match between DeSantis, a candidate for his party’s presidential nomination, and a Black Air Force veteran. Lashing out at what he called the “medical authoritarianism” of mask mandates and other anti-Covid measures, DeSantis accused federal health agencies of being “basically... -\nNew Mexico Governor Faces Call for Impeachment After Banning Concealed Carry\nNew Mexico Gov.
