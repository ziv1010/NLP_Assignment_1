Whether she's carrying the perfect fall bag or starting a burgeoning burgundy clothing trend, Kate Middleton's style is constantly under the microscope. Even when she's wearing a princess-coded cowboy hat, Kate is probably inspiring someone to purchase a matching item somewhere in the world.\nOn Saturday, September 27, the Prince and Princess of Wales shared a previously unseen photo of Kate posing with England's women's national rugby union team on Instagram. In the sweet snap, Princess Kate could be seen wearing a bright red cowboy hat, adorned with a sparkling tiara. Meanwhile, a couple of rugby players wore white cowboy hats featuring a red rose, referring to the team's nickname.\n\"Wishing the very best of luck to the @redrosesrugby in their Women's Rugby World Cup Final at Twickenham today,\" the caption said. \"We're so proud of you!

The Princess of Wales is the royal patron of the Rugby Football Union, which is why she wanted to show her support at the Women's Rugby World Cup 2025 Group Stage match between England and Australia.\nPrincess Kate's personal message follows her husband Prince William's appearance on Apple TV+ series, The Reluctant Traveler. The Prince of Wales spent time with the show's host, Eugene Levy, and opened up about the difficulties the Royal Family faced in 2024—including Princess Kate's cancer diagnosis.\n\"I'd say 2024 was the hardest year I've ever had,\" William explained. \"You know, life is sent to test us as well, and being able to overcome that is what makes us who we are.\"\nWilliam previously shared the same sentiment during a visit to South Africa in November 2024. \"Honestly? It's been dreadful,\" William said, as reported by the Daily Mail. \"It's probably been the hardest year in my life.\"\nGet exclusive access to fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.\nAmy Mackelden is the weekend editor at Marie Claire, where she covers celebrity and royal family news.
