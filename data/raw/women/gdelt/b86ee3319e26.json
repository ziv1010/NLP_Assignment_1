  "body_text": "STEVE HARPER spent two decades as a goalkeeper with Newcastle United, but it was only in his later years with the club that he made regular appearances in the first team.\nIt is ten years ago this weekend that he made his last, emotional, appearance, but in his 20 years, he only made 157 first team league appearances after signing from local team Seaham Red Star in 1993 as he found Pavel Srnicek, Shaka Hislop, Shay Given and finally Tim Krul all in front of him.\nEngland women’s captain Gill Coultard and Steve Harper at their former college, East Durham, in 1998\nIn his early days at St James' he had loan spells at Bradford City, Gateshead, Stockport County, Hartlepool United and Huddersfield Town which meant that when he eventually made his first team debut against Wimbledon in 1998, as a half-time substitute, he had achieved the rare feat of making an appearance in each of the top five divisions of the English game.\nThe highlights of his time at St James' included an FA Cup final appearance against Manchester United in 1999 which Newcastle lost 2-0.\nIn 2002 he made several appearances in the UEFA Champions League and he kept a clean sheet when the Magpies beat Italian giants Juventus 1-0 at home which helped Newcastle qualify from the group stages of the Champions League.\nIn June 2006, he expressed to manager Glenn Roeder his desire to play first team football so Roeder got him to sign a contract which kept him at St James' until 2009.\nNewcastle United keeper Steve Harper celebrates during United's victory over Turkish side Fenerbahce in the UEFA Cup match at St James' Park on 19 October, 2006\nAn injury to Shay Given at the start of the 2006-07 season gave Steve another first team chance. On September 20, 2006, he played against Liverpool, which was his first Premier League appearance for 15 months. He put in some excellent performances at that time, particularly a wonderful save against Manchester City in early November.\nLater that season, a third injury to Shay Given meant he kept a clean sheet against Chelsea, a feat only achieved by two other goalkeepers. It was also the first time since 2001 that he played in consecutive matches.\nAt the beginning of the 2007-08 season, when Sam Allardyce was the manager and Newcastle were still in the Premier League, he played in the first six games of the season and kept two clean sheets.\nIn January 2009, he signed a new contract which would keep him at St James' until 2012. When Shay Given joined Manchester City, Steve, at the age of 33, became the Magpies’ first choice goalkeeper.\nWith Newcastle in the Championship for season 2009-10 he put in some great performances and kept a club record 21 clean sheets, conceding only 35 league goals at less than a goal per game, and on March 6, 2010, he made his 50th consecutive start in the 6-1 win over Barnsley, the longest run of consecutive league appearances in his career.\nThe subsequent promotion back into the Premier League was one of the high points of his career.\nNewcastle United goalkeeper Steve Harper says a tearful farewell to fans following the Premier League match between Newcastle United and Arsenal at St James' Park\nSteve's final first team appearance for Newcastle was a Premier League home fixture against Arsenal, ten years ago on Sunday, May 19, 2013, when, on an emotional afternoon he was made captain for the day, with his father watching in the stands.\nThe 38-year-old, who wore the number 37 shirt as Tim Krul was wearing the number 1, said: \"I was wobbling. Seeing my dad just before we went out, he was a miner for 30 years, supposed to be as hard as nails, but he was wobbling too, and that got to me.\n“(Lukas) Podolski then smashed me in the family allowance, and that snapped me out of it.\n“The lads made a presentation to me afterwards and I told them that's what you get at this club if you give your all. I have not got half the ability of some players in that dressing room but I have always given it everything.\n“It's a heavy shirt to wear, and an amazing club to play for, if you can handle it.\"\nUnfortunately, Arsenal spoilt the party with Laurent Koscielny scoring the only goal of the game in the 52nd minute which left Newcastle 16th in the Premier League and manager Alan Pardew seeking talks with owner Mike Ashley and managing director Derek Llambias. Arsenal, on the other hand, secured Champions League football for the 16th consecutive season.\nNewcastle: Harper, Debuchy, Taylor, Coloccini, Yanga-Mbiwa (Campbell 80), Tiote, Cabaye (Anita 57), Gutierrez, Ben Arfa, Cisse, Gouffran (Marveaux 65).",
