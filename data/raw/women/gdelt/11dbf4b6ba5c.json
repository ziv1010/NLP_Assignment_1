This is something I take to heart. Taking part in making Indian River County a better place is what motivates me. We are facing many challenges due to growth, including needed infrastructure expansion, protection of our environmental resources, lagoon health, affordable housing, expanded job opportunities and the restructuring of our county service delivery.\nSmart growth, fiscal responsibility, and community involvement is the key for the future of Indian River County. We have made great strides in planning for our future by utilizing community visioning and outreach, but our work is not done and we must start implementing plans and projects in order to attain the community our residents envision for Indian River County. As we work to implement these community wide strategies, experienced leadership is more important than ever. I am committed to creating a community where we can all thrive, where our children, my son included, can buy a home, find a job and enjoy the quality of life that we all enjoy in Indian River County.\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\nImplementation would be my top priority. We have spent the last several years planning for our future including creating the following: Indian River County Strategic Plan, Community Visioning, Urban Service Boundary Study, Utilities Master Plan, Economic Development Plan, Manatee Protection Plan, Indian River Lagoon Plan and Parks Master Plan. It is now time to take these plans and move forward with implementation. I would work to ensure these plans are used as a roadmap to drive service delivery, road expansion, water and sewer delivery, affordable housing creation, job expansion, new park locations and expansion of conservation lands to protect our water and environmental resources.\nWe have also worked to re-organize our county structure to be more responsive to our residents. Creating a Natural Resource Department to focus on our environment and lagoon, hiring a Planning and Development Ombudsman to manage and address customer service and the revamping of our permitting and review process to remove unnecessary red tape. I would continue to work on streamlining our processes to create a more efficient and responsive county. In doing so we will be able to create opportunities for affordable housing and job growth. We are here to serve our residents and we must do so in a way that is transparent, easy to navigate and responsive.\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\nLeadership, experience and community involvement.\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy? If yes, please explain: No\nLink to campaign website or social media page:\nTim Borden, Sebastian\nAge: 40\nEducational background: Some College\nCurrent occupation and work history:\nReal Estate Owner/ Broker Treasure Coast Realty LLC 2011-Current\nProperties Plus Real Estate Sales Associate 2005-2011\nGrand Legacy Real Estate 2002-2005\nVolunteer and civic engagement:\nHabitat for Humanity Volunteer\nIndian River Water Cleanup\nSunday School Teacher Community Baptist Church\nLittle League Baseball Coach\nPast President Realtors Association Indian River\nFlorida Realtor State Director\nFlorida Realtors Housing for all Trustee\nWhy are you running for office?\nIndian River County Commissioner District 1\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\nIt is hard to name one. We have experienced so much growth and with 40,000 more residents expected to move to IRC by 2030 we must develop a strategic plan to ensure our quality of life. When we hear growth we automatically think of housing, housing is just one aspect. We have roads, utilities, jobs, schools, law enforcement and fire rescue, hospitals, green areas, public parks, protect the lagoon, etc.\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\nI have had a very successful career in the business world. The county is facing many challenges and most of them are real estate related. I have the knowledge, experience and drive to ensure Indian River County remains one of the best places to live.\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

Indian River County has moved leaps and bounds over what was happening when I took office. With my fellow Commissioners and basically a new staff we have instilled a sense of teamwork, increased morale and made customer service Priority #1. All the while, handling it pretty well with the new growth we experienced during and after COVID. We still have more to do. More to save or environment and work harder on the IRL recovery. Come up with more incentives and ideas for affordable housing and improve our recreational venues and programs.\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\nMy top priority heading into my second term would be to continue the path we set while I was newly elected Commissioner, then elected Chairman in 2022-2023 to bring Indian River County into the future.\nNumber one of my goals in the 2020 election wand will always be is to provide strong leadership, teamwork and make customer service top priority. We are doing that by using a different playbook than what was used in the past. We have upgraded County services, put key people in vital roles to make a difference while being held accountable yet giving them the freedom to do their jobs using new ideas and innovation.\nWe must and are properly managing our growth. We are taking a strong look at all our comp plans and LDR's and making sure proper zoning is in place. We must also make sure we continue to keep of infrastructure needs ahead of any new or planned growth to meet our needs.\nI am also continuing my commitment to our environment and natural resources. We still have more to do in regards to the lagoon. I have been a big proponent of offering a way for the county to store storm water from the IRF canals in the western part of the county to reduce that influx into our lagoon. I currently serve as Vice-Chairman of the IRLNEP and slated to be Chairman next year.\nPublic Safety is always on my list of top things. We must continue to have the best public safety and health programs possible but yet keeping in mind to be fiscally responsible. We are doing that and must continue on positive forward motion to keep good employees and attract new ones and provide the tools they need to get the job done.\nThese are what i campaigned on in 2020 and I have kept those promises and will do this and more in 2024.\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\nWhat distinguishes me from my opponents is my ability to understand how county and state government operate, to bring people together to solve issues. Next my age, as I have already been called out for that by my one of my opponents, but the fact is that I am a third generation Indian River County resident and fifth generation Floridian. I know where we have been and where we need to go. My life experiences, my previous career as a firefighter and the fact I have a proven track record of leadership and able to instill a sense of teamwork throughout my life. As a Commissioner and Chairman in 2023, I was the lead when we had to hire a new County Administrator and County Attorney along with basically a complete County re-organization. Also while Chairman I initiated joint meeting between the BOCC and City Councils to talk about our respective issue and open a positive line of communication. These are what sets me apart by providing leadership and being part of a team to make our County better.\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy? If yes, please explain:\nI was a guarantor for a local business that had to file for protection under Chapter 13.\nLink to campaign website or social media page:\nStephen Hume, Vero Beach\nAge: 42\nEducational background:\nMaster Degree of Science Information Technology/Cyber Security Florida State University\nCurrent occupation and work history:\nDirector of Cyber Security, Digital Forensics and Information Technology at Keiser University\nProfessor Digital Forensics Cyber Security Keiser University\nProfessor Advanced Technology and Computer Programming Indian River State College\nVolunteer and civic engagement:\nChairman of the Veterans Council of Indian River County\nTreasurer Vero Beach Museum of Aviation\nTreasurer Oak Chase Home Owners Association\nWhy are you running for office?\nDevelop a strategic plan to give our county direction and purpose\nLeverage county resources to bring high-paying careers to Indian River County\nSupport law enforcement and first responders to keep our community safe\nCut taxes and eliminate waste to ease the pain of inflation\nProtect our community’s conservative, family values\nDouble down on our commitment to veterans\nProactive solutions to ease traffic congestion\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\nMy top priority will be executing a strategic plan for the county that is consistent and logical.\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\nI am committed to making the difficult decisions and allowing voters to hold me accountable, rather than focusing on constant re-election efforts. Our community needs more than rhetoric; it requires genuine leadership. In this role, a politician must tirelessly advocate for and communicate their policies to the public, ensuring our future success. I represent the rapidly growing population of young families, who will ultimately shape this county's future.\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy? If yes, please explain: No\nDavid Shaw, Vero Beach\nAge: 29\nEducational background:\nBachelors degree from the University of Montana\nCurrent occupation and work history:\nI am currently the regional manager of the southern division of a large agricultural family business. As well as an entrepreneur and the real estate market.\nVolunteer and civic engagement: N/A\nWhy are you running for office?\nI want to serve and protect Indian River County. We have a very unique environment that I intend to keep. We are not like our neighbors and I don’t want to see it slip away. The recent building of the Aspire and Griffon complexes off of route 60 and the only newly added job opportunities being gas stations, car washes, and storage units raised concerns. The influx of population without the proper infrastructure poses a real threat to the way of life here. Especially with the glaring issue of our (agricultural land) orange grove’s demise. We will have serious issues if the zoning changes from agriculture to high density commercial. Zoning is a crucial cornerstone, for any city. There is a lot of room for potential abuse of authority for monetary gain. With 24 nieces and nephews, I feel I have an innate obligation to them and to my fellow citizens. An obligation to make sure there’s a future that is worth looking forward to. A future that provides prosperity through well paying jobs, an infrastructure that is up to the task and suitable living arrangements. Not high density housing or careers that consist of gas stations and car washes.\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\nThere are many things that are at the top of my list. However, this particular one has my attention.\nI would investigate the allocation of government funds.\nThe reason that this is a top priority for me is because last year our existing commissioner council gave 425 thousand dollars to The Learning Alliance, an NGO. Just prior to doing so, The Learning Alliance reported a profit of 19+ million dollars that fiscal year. For 2023-2024 this same NGO has requested another 630 thousand dollars of our tax dollars. These funds should have been reinvested locally to support our county and citizens. As a commissioner, I would always be taking into account the best interest of my citizens. It would be paramount to make sure our citizens tax dollars are being allocated properly and precisely rather than lining others pockets. I vow to work for our people; not the other way around.\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\nI’m young and full of drive. When I think about the future of our home I am thinking decades into the future. I do not want to watch our county turn into another tourist town with high rise buildings and too much traffic. I see a future where our county is as beautiful as it is now, but it will take grit to refute the incoming pressures to monopolize IRC. With my experience working as a manager, being an entrepreneur, and competing as an athlete I have overcome many challenges throughout the years. My perseverance and dedication to success has given me a strong foundation and I want to use this foundation to serve and protect for the betterment of our county. I do not view this election as a career path, but rather an opportunity and an obligation to secure a bright future for the next generation. Indian River County is worth fighting for and we have the ability to protect our home, but we need leaders that are willing to make the tough choices. Not those who will give in to appease others or reduce potential conflict. I know that if given the opportunity I will be that leader.\nI have a strong moral compass combined with the will and determination to fight for our citizens and this county.\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

Being Mayor, now County Commissioner and holding elected office is the best job of my life. Coming in first in the 2016 and 2018 general elections for Vero Beach City Council then first again in the 2020 election for County Commissioner, District 5 is a great honor. I thank each and every individual who took the time to make his/her will known. You gave me a mandate for change and the confidence that comes with it. I never forget that all power comes from you.\nSince 2016, when I became the first woman ever to start her City Council term as Mayor in the 100+-year history of Vero Beach, and continuing to today as County Commissioner, I proudly have worn my official name badge everyday everywhere I go. This simple act has served to encourage people to speak with me anytime anywhere about anything on their minds. It keeps me in-touch with their hopes and dreams, as well as their fears and concerns, for our community.\nPeople can come away from me with the knowledge that they have direct access to local government. That their thoughts and feelings are important and will be considered in the decision-making process. It is not a one-time event; it is the start of a relationship. I invite them to contact me at any time. I view local government and my role in it as a partnership with the People. A sacred trust. A grassroots leader in touch with the People is more important than ever today. I delight in people. I relish problem-solving.\nAs a county, we are at a critical juncture. With the need to protect our water supply, lagoon, green spaces, and very sense of community in the face of what can become a relentless push for development. I remain committed to protecting this special place we call home and the strong sense of community that we enjoy. And I am optimistic that we can do so. With the help of our new County Administrator, initiatives to improve existing services and to plan carefully for our future have begun. I enjoy being part of that process. Envisioning and suggesting improvements. And I look forward to continuing to contribute to the process and its implementation in my second term.\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\nRe-evaluating growth and the price we pay for it. Working with our municipalities to do so.\nIn simple terms, land use within our county and the quality and quantity of our water. For example, a review of the Urban Service Area currently is underway with public outreach workshops having been conducted. Related studies or plans underway include a first-time Parks & Recreation Master Plan, a Stormwater Master Plan, and a Beach Preservation Plan. All of which will become valuable tools in planning the best future for our county.\nWith regard to actions I’ve already taken, my initiative to create an educational native plant garden at the County Complex was completed within a year of my start on County Commission with the help of Pelican Island Audubon Society. The funding for this award-winning demonstration project largely was raised through private sources.\nI’ve promoted the updating of our 1988 Geohydrology Report prepared by the US Geological Survey (federal agency) since the Soil & Water Conservation District advised us of this need in 2021. This report is the most comprehensive and specific guide to the water in our County. I voted against the creation of Community Development Districts (500+ acres at a time with financial incentives for developers) in our county in 2022, and I voted against filling in wetlands for purposes of development in 2023.\nAdditionally, I’ve requested that the traffic studies for proposed developments be readily available to County Commission and the Planning & Zoning Commission and that a cumulative count be kept of the amount of traffic added any given year. From my perspective, adding a subdivision should be considered within a larger context than several hundred feet from its doors. It takes years for roads and bridges to be added or even expanded. Most of us already have felt that our roadways are unable to keep up with the current increase in traffic. A large project such as the I-95 Oslo Road Exit is intended to make travel easier but the area effected will need to be planned carefully.\nOther important issues currently facing us include our aging infrastructure, our economic growth, our continuing viability as an affordable home to our hardworking middle-class, and how best to address our homeless. Keeping our taxes low always is a concern.\nI’ll close with the newly-minted mission statement derived from the results of Strategic Planning sessions held with Staff and County Commission: “Dedicated to Indian River County through service excellence.” Making customer service a top priority for all bodes well for our future.\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\nMoss = Leadership\nBeing Mayor. I am honored to be the only woman to start City Council as Mayor in the 100+-year history of Vero Beach.\nZudans = Lack of Leadership\nMy opponent, Mrs. Zudans, nominated herself for Mayor at the reorganization meeting of Vero Beach City Council last November. Her motion died for lack of a second.\nMoss = Experience/Commitment to the Community\nHaving served two terms on Vero Beach City Council and completing my first term on County Commission, my commitment to our community is clear.\nZudans = Lack of Experience/Commitment to the Community\nMy opponent, Mrs. Zudans, filed to run for County Commission less than halfway through her first two-year term on Vero Beach City Council.\nMoss = Accomplishments\nWith a mandate from the voters, I started as Mayor on 11/21/2016, and I signed the contract for the electric sale on 10/24/2017.\nFor details, see “How FPL-Vero Deal went from “War” to “Godsend”, reprinted with permission of Standard + Poor’s Global Market Intelligence at votelauramoss.com.\nZudans = Lack of Accomplishments\nTo date, with regard to the City’s single largest project, Three Corners, to say that Mrs. Zudans has been unsuccessful in bringing it to fruition is an understatement. It recently has regressed and devolved all the way back to the Request For Proposal (RFP) stage - a huge waste of time and taxpayers’ dollars. And the downward spiral includes Mrs. Zudans recusing herself from an important vote in this matter against the advice of the City Attorney. She was advised that Florida Statute required it and still refused to comply. Elected officials have an obligation to follow the law whatever their personal opinions might be.\nFor details, see “Three jeers for clown show on Three Corners”, Vero News, 06/13/2024\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

Government should focus on a limited number of things like police, fire, courts of law, and public infrastructure. For those limited rolls leaders should use restraint and common sense without picking winners and losers. Everything that the private sector and our citizens can do better than government should be left in the private sector with minimal taxes and regulation. This ultimately supports local businesses, residents and families.\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain\nMy top priority would be to develop the agenda for graceful growth by anticipating the needs of our infrastructure, public safety, density, and urban service boundaries while completely overhauling the building department.\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\nI believe that most people are capable of common sense and desire to be free of excessive government intervention in their lives and businesses. That is the attitude that I could bring to the position.\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

We raised our three children here and they graduated from our public high schools. They are all doing well and each one has completed his/ her Master's Degree.\nWhen it states in policy that the responsibility of the education for our public school students lies with the School Board, I take that very seriously. My question each day is --- how can we continue to do better? And, are we supporting the people in our schools who need the help? This is a team effort with our parents and community members. Our public schools have a wonderful diversity and I want all children to be successful. I believe my success in all the positions I have held is an asset to me as a School Board Member. I have walked the walk.\nWe are on a good path with Dr. Moore and all of our district and school staffs, and I want to make sure that continues. We are an A rated school district and I am proud of that , but we must never become complacent. We can always continue to\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\nI have three platforms, but my top priority will be recruiting and retaining teachers. In 1970, 33% of all graduates in America were in Education, now it is 9 percent. People are not going into education for several reasons, but the issue is, we still need teachers. What can we do as a community with work force housing and creating our own teachers who come back to teach with us? IRSC would be a good partner with that effort. Maybe a private-public partnership with paying for tuition the last two years at IRSC as an incentive, since the first two years are paid with the Promise Program.\nIn order for our students to learn, they must have great teachers. And please know, I believe we have very strong teachers and I am so glad they chose IRCSD to teach.\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\nI don't think there are too many people who have given as much time that I have to this school district. I started teaching here in 1980 and left in 2009 when I was Principal of SRHS. I then came back as a Principal Consultant and an Executive Director for Secondary. I am now in my 4th year in my first term as a School Board Member. What distinguishes me? I have a great work ethic and I am not afraid to roll up my sleeves to get the job done. I believe Public Education is one of the main foundations in this country and I believe we must work even harder to make sure we protect this institution. I am out in our schools and community on a regular basis --- not because I am running again, but because I love it.

Not just on a bottom line dollar level but also on a personnel and future vision level. My son Liam will be in first grade and my daughter Fiona will be in kindergarten so I have vested interest in the success of our public schools. When I look at our 60% literacy rate and similar math scores but 95% graduation rate that does not paint a great picture of how I would expect our system to run. There are a lot of business inefficiencies that need to be fix to get our school system unclogged so we can get back to the business of educating students.\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\nWorking with Dr. Moore and his team to enable our teachers to teach from passion and regain control of the class room. They need to feel supported and engaged in the process and not micromanaged and persecuted\nAdopt and maintain a student code of conduct to reduce the discipline problems in school especially pertaining to drug use\nNarrow the communication gaps between parents, students, teachers and administrators so that everyone is looped in and can invest in the students success.\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\nI am a free thinking business owner who has tough decisions to make on a daily basis. Starting businesses from the ground up gave me a lot of experience in dealing with different people, emotions and situations and finding common ground. Also provided me with in depth knowledge on budgets, forecasting, inventory management, customer satisfaction and leadership. I am empathetic to individual needs but do not believe you need to be everything to everyone.\nI have kids in the public school system, my son Liam will be in first grade and daughter Fiona will be in Kindergarten. I also believe that our female athletes should be protected and would of voted with the rest of the board to take a stand on changing title IX. In particular when it comes to reidentifying the definition of gender. I am sure you know my opponent voted No on that issue and did not want to protect our female athletes.\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

When a non-partisan election becomes partisan and issues that have nothing to do with the academic achievement of our children take precedence; it’s time that someone stood up for the children in public education. I run to as a way to give back to our community. I seek no compensation or benefits and have no political agenda other than the education of our children and the success of our public schools.\nI am running to support teachers in the classroom and for increased teacher pay. Florida ranks 50th nationally in average teacher pay. I am running to improve third grade literacy, to stop the middle school academic slide, and to offer more career and certification choices in high school. I am running for student and school safety; we must further harden our schools. I am running for financial accountability and transparency.

As YOUR Indian River County Sheriff, I oversee a budget of more than $74 Million, 565 full time employees, approximately 420 inmates, and am responsible for the safety and security of Indian River County. I consider myself a Constitutional Sheriff. My additional responsibilities include overseeing the jail and court security, and also serve the Florida Sheriff’s Association in a variety of capacities including Region 5 Task Force Leader, member of the Board of Directors, and Chair of the Investment Committee for the Florida Sheriff Employee Benefits Trust. I also serve as a Commissioner for the Florida Corrections Accreditation Commission.\nI have been employed with the Indian River County Sheriff’s Office since 2003 and prior to being elected had been promoted to the rank of major where I oversaw both the Law Enforcement and Administrative Service sections of the agency. I have also served in a variety of ranks and capacities including patrol deputy, field training deputy, undercover narcotics detective, criminal investigator, and public information officer. Prior to being in law enforcement, I was the youngest manager (19) at Sam’s Club in Orlando, having worked my way up from Cart Pusher at the Sebastian Walmart, and spent a total of six years with the Walmart corporation.\nVolunteer and civic engagement:\nI have served as a board member for United Way, Chairman of the Board for Safespace, and currently host three annual fundraisers for the Florida Sheriff's Youth Ranches. Under my leadership, the Indian River County Sheriff's Office has once again become a Torchbearer Agency for United Way and recently hosted a car show benefit for them. We have a Crossfit Competition scheduled for September, for which proceeds will also all go to United Way.\nWhile I did not start the Florida Sheriff's Youth Ranches BBQ, we have raised more than $1.2 million dollars as an agency to benefit that organization. I added an annual Clay Shoot (coming up again this November), and a fishing tournament. Annually, since you elected me, we have given nearly $100,000 per year to the Florida Sheriff's Youth Ranches.\nWhy are you running for office?\nI have been blessed to lead the best team of law enforcement professionals in the state. We have advanced the use of innovation and technology and made vast improvements in public safety and customer service. I am running for reelection because I have a lot more work to do and am just getting started in advancing 21st Century policing into the Indian River County Sheriff’s Office.\nA few of our accomplishments in just three and half years include, the implementation of body cameras to improve transparency, the creation of a real time crime center to assist deputies and detectives in keeping the public safe, the formation of a total wellness approach for our members to include mental and physical health components, as well as the expansion of inmate programs to reduce recidivism and avoid our community being victimized by crime.\nSince serving as YOUR Indian River County Sheriff, our agency is now viewed as being a leader in innovation, recruiting, and tactics not just on the Treasure Coast, but around the State. We regularly host training classes now, and often get asked to travel to other areas to teach our programs and share how we do things.\nI have been fortunate to be able to take care of our heroes through a step-pay plan and a resiliency health and wellness team (S.T.A.R. and Emerald Medical). We have come a long way, but still have a lot of work left to do to get proper compensation to ensure that we are a leading agency for years to come. While we have recruited from other agencies in Florida and around the Country, it will take a leader like me to continue to draw this talent. The employees want to know that they have a leader who has their back, supports their efforts to receive a living wage, and who will stand shoulder to shoulder with them should they have to do the one thing we all hope we never have to do - pull the trigger to protect themselves or another. I have proven to our team that I am that leader and I am confident that they want me to continue to lead our team of heroes well into the future.\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\nThe top three issues facing me as Sheriff during the first days of my next term will be runaway inflation and the potential for a financial crisis, the fact that every county is now a border county due to the failed border policies of our Federal Government, and the increase in population to Indian River County.\nInflation has made it difficult to keep pace with South Florida agencies to stay competitive in hiring and recruiting. It will continue to impact our ability to bring in new recruits and employees. Public Safety Dispatch and entry level positions remain difficult to fill as we are now competing with fast food restaurants paying $15 or more an hour. I would continue to work with our County Commissioners to grow our budget in a responsible way to increase wages to ensure our heroes are paid what they deserve.\nHaving recently traveled to our border, it is more clear to me than ever that Indian River County is a border county. I have grown our narcotics unit and have recently presented results of ongoing investigations into fentanyl traffickers and those who have sold drugs resulting in overdose deaths. While our efforts have shown that overdose deaths are on the decline for the third year in a row, we need to keep our foot on the gas pedal to ensure we are keeping our county safe from those who think it is acceptable to sell drugs. Additionally, we are focused on the gang members and criminals who have illegally crossed our borders and are now on American soil. Terrorists have crossed our borders and intend to commit harm to our country. I would continue to remain vigilant against these and other threats to our community.\nLastly, our population increase and ensuring we have enough law enforcement to respond to the needs of the community is one of my top priorities. In the first days of my term I will be focused on the next budget that will surely have to include additional positions to account for this growth. We have slowly grown the agency since I have taken office, but if we are to keep pace with this growth we will need an annual increase in positions year over year as our community continues to grow.\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\nI have always been and remain focused on ensuring the members of the Indian River County Sheriff’s Office are trained, equipped, and prepared to serve and protect our community. I was overwhelmingly elected in 2020 and have only improved the quality of service the residents of Indian River County receive from their Sheriff’s Office. Nothing has changed in my commitment to serve as the Sheriff of this wonderful county, and I remain the most qualified and experienced person to occupy the Office of Sheriff for Indian River County.\nI am the only candidate who has served as Sheriff and know the weight of being that leader. I have prepared and passed three budgets and stayed within those budgets each year. I have led the agency to new heights, leveraged technology, and have a proven track record of success as YOUR Sheriff. During my time in office, the policies and technology I have implemented have resulted in decreases in crime including a 32% decrease in auto burglaries, 34% decrease in residential burglaries, and 13% decrease in grand theft autos with a significantly higher recovery rate. Additionally, under my leadership, we have enjoyed a 45% decrease in liability claims notices, and a 38% decrease in actual lawsuits against the agency. Since taking office, Florida has hit a 50 year low in crime and that is not because of places like Orlando, Miami, and Tampa, but because of Sheriffs like me, in county’s like ours, that are working hard to decrease crime and arrest and hold accountable those who think they can prey on our beautiful little town.\nI believe the good citizens of Indian River County elected me because of my customer service approach to things. As George H.W. Bush said, “Good policy is good politics.” I established a Customer Service Unit with a dedicated telephone number and email that is available to citizens to answer questions, direct calls and emails, and assist with all things that don’t fit neatly into any other category. I believe I am known for my customer service skills, which have permeated our law enforcement and corrections components since I took over, and believe it is one of the reasons why I will be reelected.\nLastly, I am the only candidate with children in the school system. I am the only candidate who is not retired from a law enforcement agency. This is my career. I have never worked at another agency. I am fully committed to the role of Sheriff and the people of Indian River County. I am not collecting a retirement check and have no desire to do so. I want to serve as YOUR Indian River County Sheriff for as long as you will have me.\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy? If yes, please explain: No\nLink to campaign website or social media page:\nKeith Touchberry, Unincorporated Fellsmere\nAge: 60\nEducational background:\nMaster of Science, Criminal Justice, UCF\nCurrent occupation and work history:\nCurrently the police chief for the City of Fellsmere. At 10 years and 10 months, I am the longest serving police chief in the city's history. I also hold the title of Assistant City Manager. Prior to being hired as the chief in September 2013, I served the citizens of Vero Beach as a police officer for nearly 25 years. I worked my way up through the ranks and left VBPD as a Captain and second-in-command to work in Fellsmere. Prior to my career in law enforcement, I served on active duty in the Marine Corp infantry field and prior to that, the Army Reserve. I have had a parallel career in the classroom teaching a variety of basic and advanced courses to law enforcement officers both locally and throughout the state, and to undergraduate students enrolled in an online criminal justice program formerly offered at Florida Tech. In addition to teaching, I developed several advanced and undergraduate level courses.\nVolunteer and civic engagement:\nMember and past president of the Florida Police Chiefs Association (FPCA) (2007-present)\nMember and past chairman of the FPCA Professional Standards Committee (2007-present)\nMember of the FPCA Legislative Committee (2018-present)\nMember and past President, Treasure Coast Chiefs of Police and Sheriffs Association, 2007-present\nChairman of the public safety sub-committee, Treasure Coast Opioid Task Force (2018-2020)\nChairman, Region XI Training Council, Indian River State College, 2014-present\nMember and past chairman, Executive Roundtable of Indian River County, 2014-present\nMember and co-founder, Fellsmere Action Community Team, 2014-present\nMentor, Big Brothers and Big Sisters, 2017-2023\nMember, Fellsmere Exchange Club (2013-2018)\nWhy are you running for office?\nI am running to provide the quality leadership the members of our Sheriff's Office and our community deserve. Leadership at our Sheriff's Office is compromised and as a result, many decisions about employee livelihood such as promotions, transfers, training and education, and discipline are not fairly, impartially, and consistently applied. Morale is low among many, and trust in leadership and each other is strained. This has also created a challenge for recruiting and retention. As of June 27, 2024, the Sheriff's Office via a public record request, reported a total of 45 vacant positions, 28 of which were sworn and 17 non-sworn. Of those sworn positions, 15 are entry level deputies. Such vacancies create gaps in service, increase overtime, and further reduce morale and proficiency. The budget has increased exponentially over the last three years, surpassing what the previous sheriff's budget increased during the preceding twelve years. Despite the existence of numerous vacant, funded positions at the end of the last three fiscal years, the sheriff's office returns very little money to Indian River County government, leading many to question what the sheriff's office is spending their money on. Monitoring the Sheriff's budget this cycle, we've learned that since the Taxpayer Associations debate, the original budget request for fiscal year 24/25 that contained an 11.9% or, $8,841,569 increase in funding has been amended to a 6.5% or $4,782,112 increase. Despite this reduction, IRC staff have told the Board of County Commissioners in their Budget Message, that \"continued increases in the Sheriff's budget at the levels of the past few fiscal years are fiscally unsustainable.\" It also appears as if the Sheriff's Office has abandoned their request to launch a three-year capital campaign to fund a 3.2-million-dollar K9 training facility this fiscal year, and a 5.8-million-dollar classroom/auditorium project the next fiscal year. Finally, while our sheriff's office is comprised of great, talented people, there exists a mindset among many that cities are in counties and deputies are superior in authority. They have conducted operations in cities without advance notice or de-conflicting, like serving high risk search warrants and participating in the federally funded \"Operation Stonegarden\" program. Operating in cities in this manner is unsafe and does not reflect professional standards in inter-agency relationships.\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\nAfter the immediate responsibility of conducting an inventory of all sheriff's property and ensuring the budget to actual spending is appropriately paced, building relationships within the Sheriff's Office and the community to enhance trust, determine mutual goals and objectives and developing a plan to achieve them together will be a top priority. An emphasis will be placed on Immigration issues, general crime, illicit drugs, and the social problems impacting our community like homelessness and mental health. An emphasis will also be placed on continuing to manage cold cases. Our leadership team will also analyze the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats facing the organization and address them accordingly. Ultimately, the first year will be spent connecting with the community and all law enforcement partners, managing systems, programs, and processes for effectiveness and efficiency, and addressing the existing culture and paradigm of the organization and its members from what it currently is to what it should be based on the internal and external analysis methods mentioned.\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\nI have 35 years of law enforcement experience in Indian River County serving the last 10 years and 10 months as the Police Chief and Chief Executive Officer of the Fellsmere Police Department. I am also the only veteran in this race having served in both the Army Reserve and the active duty ranks of the Marine Corps infantry field. I have a Master of Science Degree in Criminal Justice from the University of Central Florida and I am a graduate of the prestegious Southern Police Institutes' Administrative Officer Course held only twice annually at the University of Louisville. I have been a member of the Florida Police Chiefs Association (FPCA) since 2007 and served as it President from 2022-2023. As a member of the FPCA Legislative Committee, I am active in legislative affairs and I am responsible for initiating legislative changes to three statutes in the past four years. I am currently working on a fourth. My involvement in the FPCA has enabled me to develop professional relationships with law enforcement leaders and legislators throughout the State of Florida. I am the primary ethics instructor for two leadership programs offered through the FPCA, and the Indian River State College Criminal Justice Leader program. I am innovative in my approach to law enforcement, having developed several programs designed to reduce crime, enhance our quality of life, and build relationships in the community. One example is an \"Habitual Drunkard\" program based on an obscure statute designed to prevent alcohol sales to known alcoholics in partnership with family members and point of sale locations. Another example is a literacy based program called \"Cadets and Kids\" designed to increase literacy scores while promoting trust in the police profession. Finally, I conceived of a program designed to prepare future educators for the \"post Marjory Stoneman Douglas world\" they will enter upon graduation from college. I oversaw its development in partnership with local law enforcement agencies, Indian River State College, local school districts, and the office of Safe Schools. The program is now expanding statewide.\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

Throughout my journey, I have ascended every leadership rank within the IRCSO, and led every division and section with a steadfast commitment to excellence. I am the only candidate in this race, who has accomplished this and the only candidate who is certified in both law enforcement and corrections.\nMy vision for the future of the IRCSO is crystal clear – an agency of dedication, free from distraction that hinders our ability to serve the good, hardworking people of Indian River County. It is evident that our community is not receiving the level of service they deserve, and it is my solemn promise to lead with integrity, ensuring that taxpayer money is utilized efficiently and effectively.\nWe will aggressively address the issues that affect our community, such as the Fentanyl Opioid Crisis, Illegal Immigration, Cybercrimes, and School Safety Initiatives.\nThe men and women of IRCSO deserve a leader who will uphold those high standards and quality of life that each of you expect and deserve. As Sheriff, I pledge to preserve these standards with unwavering dedication and a relentless pursuit of justice! Tough on crime, tougher on criminals!\nWe will build a safer, stronger community where every individual feels protected. We will focused on a brighter future for IRCSO, where transparency, accountability, service and excellence are not just words, but the pillars upon which our agency stands.\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\nAs we embark on a new journey to set a fresh course for the Indian River County Sheriff's Office, it is imperative that we lay down a solid strategic plan that will guide our actions and decisions moving forward.\nA strategic plan serves as our roadmap, outlining our goals, priorities, and the steps we need to take to achieve success. It will be the foundation upon which we build a more efficient, effective, and community-focused sheriff's office.\nIn developing our budget, my administration will take a comprehensive approach, balancing the current needs of our community with a forward-thinking perspective. We will consider factors such as the growth rate, inflation, and unfunded mandates that impact our budget, recognizing that every dollar spent ultimately comes from the hardworking taxpayers of Indian River County.\nWith the sheriff's office accounting for a significant portion of the county's general fund, at 54.4%, it is crucial that we find ways to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations without unduly burdening our taxpayers. My team and I will be committed to exploring innovative solutions and cost-saving measures to optimize our resources and deliver top-notch services to the community.\nUnder my leadership, we will adopt a prudent approach to financial management. We will not allocate funds without a well-thought-out plan in place, ensuring that every dollar is spent wisely and in alignment with our strategic goals. Additionally, we will actively seek out grant opportunities to alleviate the financial strain on our taxpayers and support our initiatives for improvement and innovation.\nBy adhering to a strategic plan that prioritizes fiscal responsibility, transparency, and community engagement, we will pave the way for a brighter future for the Indian River County Sheriff's Office and the residents we serve.\nSecondly, as we strive to be responsible stewards of the trust and resources entrusted to us by the taxpayers of Indian River County, it is essential that we conduct a thorough evaluation of every division and section within the Sheriff's Office. This evaluation will enable us to ensure that our resources and personnel are deployed in the most effective and efficient manner possible, maximizing the return on investment for our community's safety and security.\nBy rigorously assessing each section of the Sheriff's Office, we can identify areas of strength, areas needing improvement, and opportunities for optimization. This process will allow us to reallocate resources where needed, streamline operations, and enhance overall effectiveness in fulfilling our mission to protect and serve the residents of Indian River County.\nMy commitment to conducting regular evaluations underscores our dedication to transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement. By striving for excellence in the deployment of our resources and personnel, we are not only honoring the taxpayers' investment in us but also demonstrating our unwavering commitment to safeguarding the well-being and interests of our community. Through strategic evaluation and thoughtful action, we will ensure that every dollar invested in the Indian River County Sheriff's Office yields a tangible and meaningful return in the form of enhanced public safety and security for all.\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race? *\nIn this election for the office of sherif, what sets me apart for my opponents is my unparalleled experience and unique qualifications. As the only candidate who is dual certified in law enforcement and corrections, I bring a comprehensive understanding of both aspects of the criminal justice systems to the table.\nMy background as a former jail administrator, where I was responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Division of Correction and Judicial Services, demonstrates my hands-on experience in managing critical aspects of law enforcement. Additionally, my extensive tenure at the Indian River County Sheriff’s Office, where I supervised every division and every section on my way to becoming Deputy Chief, showcases my deep knowledge of the organization and its operations.\nCurrently overseeing a substantial budget (100 million) at Indian River State College and managing multi-million-dollar construction projects (40-50 million), I have proven my ability to handle complex financial matters and infrastructure developments. My track record of leading men and women to excellence speaks volumes about my leadership skills and my commitment to fostering a culture of excellence within my team.\nMoreover, my reputation as an authentic leader who is trusted by those around me further sets me apart from my opponents. My ability to build trust and inspire confidence in my team members is a valuable asset that will undoubtedly serve well in the role of sheriff.\nOverall, my combination of experience, leadership qualities, and proven track record make me the standout candidate in this election. My dedication to getting the job done and committed to excellence make me the ideal choice to lead the Indian River County Sheriff’s Office into the future.\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

(Fellsmere Action Community Team) Member\nWhy are you running for office?\nTo restore Ethics, Transparency, and Accountability to the Tax Collector's office by removing the cronyism, nepotism promotions & six-figure salaries for loyalty.\nStop the revolving door of employee turnover. In the 15 years the incumbent has been in office, over 170+ employees have left. She was appointed to office in 2009 with 46 employees; I was the 61st employee to go in 2016. The office is currently budgeted for 73. That is nearing a triple turnover!\nStop excessive, wasteful spending on advertising, car allowance, Queueing System, Deputy for Hire, Beach Office, and Salaries that are not in line with experience.\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain *\nHire an HR Professional immediately. In the 15 years the incumbent has been in office, she has never had one on staff.\nOPEN THE OFFICES—no more appointments are required! There will be appointment options, but I have a more efficient way to compromise with all.\nOffices will open during your lunch hour and will explore Saturday hours, alternating offices.\nI will meet with each employee to hear their expectations of me and share what I expect of them. I will also learn from them what their goals are to ensure they have the right tools to succeed and whether they are in the proper position for their skills/experience.\nI will reassess the salaries of frontline clerks to bring them up to a competitive rate. I do not need to hire an expensive company for a salary study! The minimum wage will soon be $13 hourly, and the starting rate for a frontline clerk is only $15 hourly. Then you have the executive assistant (secretary) making $112,500 annually, even more than the finance or IT directors. Something is really wrong with that. The frontline staff are the face of your office!\nEliminate Self-Political-Branding: All signage returns to the name of the Indian River County Tax Collector, and your checks will be made payable to the same.\nEliminate unnecessary travel expenses to promote a self-serving agenda.\nRe-assess the Beach office for more efficient usage or even closure.\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\nHaving worked there, I know the position of Tax Collector is that of an Administrator, not a Legislator or a career politician.\nMy focus is and has always been on serving our community, not Tallahassee, and my presence in Tallahassee will be minimal.\nI see ALL people equally.\nI believe in self-imposed Term Limits.\nMy professional experience.\nI would never tout or misguide taxpayers with misleading information. The incumbent touts that she is proud to have returned $40m locally. That is the job! She is required to return all excess fees; it is a fee-based office!\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

Our office has saved more than $40 million in taxpayer money that gets sent back to the county to fund critical programs that affect seniors, families and children in our community.\nWe will continue saving taxpayer money, while providing the best customer service possible to everyone who visits our office. I am proud of our work, and proud to serve this community I hold so dear.\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\nIn my new term, we look forward to opening a new Tax Collector's Office in Fellsmere. I believe that government should be accessible for people. That's why we're making it even easier for residents in Fellsmere to obtain driver license, title and registration services, property tax services, hunting and fishing license, local business tax and many, many other services we provide.\nAs always, fiscal responsibility, taxpayer money savings, and sterling customer care will be guiding principles for leadership in the Tax Collector's Office of Indian River County.\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\nI am proud of my proven, successful record running the Tax Collector's Office of Indian River County. Before running for Tax Collector, my husband and I built a business right here in Vero Beach. When I was elected I promised to bring my unique business acumen to the Tax Collector's Office. That's how we've been able to save and return more than $40 million taxpayer dollars back to the county. That's why we have low wait times, convenient appointments, friendly and helpful staff, and rave reviews from Indian River County residents.\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?
