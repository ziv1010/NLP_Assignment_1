  "body_text": "Michele Kang will invest $50 million in US Soccer over five years, making the Washington Spirit's owner the biggest contributor ever to girl's and women's football initiatives through the national program.\nThe donation is the largest ever to US Soccer by a woman.\nKang not only is the owner of the NWSL's Spirit, she also is the majority owner of women's teams Olympique Lyonnais Feminin in France and London City Lionesses in England.\nInvestments in women's sports are nothing new to Kang, who donated $85 million in July for women's health initiatives in sports, then donated $7 million to the U.S. women's rugby sevens program after the Paris Olympics, while also creating her own sports science nonprofit.\nKang originally purchased a 35 percent stake in the Spirit in 2020 then became the majority owner in 2022 for a $60 million investment. The club will face the Orlando Pride on Saturday for the NWSL title.\nThe 65-year-old is the founder and chief executive of Cognosante, a medical technology company.\nIn May, Cognosante was acquired by Accenture Federal Services for an undisclosed sum.\nKang's Kynisca Sports International, which was launched in July and based in London, invested $3.3m on 31 October in IDA Sports, which is developing footwear for female athletes.\nIn January, Kang joined the ownership group of the Baltimore Orioles.\n-Reuters",
