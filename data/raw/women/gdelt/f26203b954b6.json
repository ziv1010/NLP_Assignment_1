That’s a problem for Europe at a time when some Republicans in the United States are also looking to stop further military assistance packages for Kyiv, and Brussels needs all EU countries to sign on to future aid.\nEurope’s moment: Europe has already surpassed the U.S. in overall assistance for Ukraine, according to the Kiel Institute, but it could soon have to shoulder much more of the burden.\n**A message from Google: New research by Public First estimates that Google’s products, platforms and tools will help provide an estimated €179 billion in economic activity in 2023 across the EU. Read the full report here.**\nWhat to expect: The gap between Smer and Progressive Slovakia is narrowing in the final days of the election, with the latter party gaining ground. The winner will need coalition partners to form a government. Among the potential partners for Fico’s Smer is Republic, a far-right party whose leader, Milan Uhrík, is a radical opponent of both the EU and NATO and calls for an end to government support for all NGOs.\nStaying humble: Speaking to Playbook, European lawmaker Martin Hojsík of Progressive Slovakia declined to name potential coalition partners, except to say his party excludes an alliance with Smer or any far-right group. “We are not saying we would go with these guys or with those those guys. We are waiting humbly to see what the voters will tell us,” he said.\nOnline battlefield: Hojsík denounced what he called a “flood” of online hate speech and disinformation ahead of the vote, urging the European Commission to take action under the EU executive’s Code of Practice on Disinformation. “There’s massive amounts of it, lies, hate speech and everything. I find it quite hard and tricky to have a situation where you have blatant lies spread on Facebook with thousands of shares. This is something that needs urgent attention from the Commission.”\nOn Tuesday, the EU’s chief digital affairs official, Věra Jourová, said the election was “a test case” of how vulnerable European elections are to Moscow’s “multi-million-euro weapon of mass manipulation.”\nDon’t tread on me: Asked why this election matters, Slovak MEP Lucia Ďuriš Nicholsonová told my colleague Eddy Wax that it would have “huge influence on the whole region” of the Visegrád Group of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, “and I think that it’s not just some fake threat coming from Fico.” Ďuriš Nicholsonová belongs to the Renew group and runs her own small party called Apple, which hopes to govern with Progressive Slovakia.\nPutin risk: “I think this is a real fact that [Fico] would stop providing the support for Ukraine. I think he’s very close to Putin, as [are] his potential coalition partners,” she said. “He will be definitely aligning with Orbán, I mean they will become allies.”\nPOLAND’S ELECTION CAMPAIGN\nELECTION WATCHERS FLAG ‘CONCERNS’: With just two weeks to go until Poland’s parliamentary election, observers who completed a two-day trip to the country are flagging concerns about the “heated and polarized” campaign.\nYou’re doing what? Among worries about unequal access to media and late changes to election rules, the observers zeroed in on the fact that the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) is holding a referendum on migration on the same day as the October 15 election.\nEtonnement: “It’s a subject of worry and even amazement that the referendum is held on the same day as the parliamentary election,” French MP Mireille Clapot, who led the delegation of five lawmakers from different countries and different political groups, told Playbook. The group is mandated by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which is tasked with election monitoring.\nName, please: The referendum raises questions about campaign financing as well as voting secrecy, Clapot said, because voters will be asked to accept or refuse a referendum ballot as they enter the polling station — and the names of those who refuse will be marked down and recorded.\nNot all bad: “There are a lot of officials and local committees that are working hard to make sure everything goes well but we have to be clear that we had issues and concerns,” said Clapot, who is a member of President Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance party in France.\nRENEW CALLS FOR ‘URGENT’ DEBATE ON POLISH VISA SCANDAL: The European Parliament will hold an urgent debate on Poland’s so-called visa-for-bribes scandal. Renew called for the debate, and it was approved on Thursday at the Conference of Presidents gathering of Parliament chief Roberta Metsola plus political group chairs.\nBackground: Opposition parties are hammering the Polish government over reports that the country’s consulates allegedly issued hundreds of thousands of temporary work visas in return for bribes.\nRenew chief weighs in: “This scandal can have serious consequences on the integrity of the Schengen area and it undermines greatly our trust between partners,” Renew group chief Stéphane Séjourné told Playbook. “We need to go to the bottom of the issue. It is extremely serious.”\nProblems for ‘everyday Poles’: “I am afraid that the carelessness or complicity of the Polish government will eventually have repercussions on everyday Poles,” Séjourné said, adding that the scandal could lead to “some sort of controls” on borders with Poland.\nFURTHER LISTENING: In this week’s episode of POLITICO’s EU Confidential podcast, Suzanne Lynch and the team discuss the visa scandal and the Polish election.\nLOOK AHEAD TO GRANADA\nUKRAINE’S PITCH FOR FULL EU MEMBERSHIP: As debate heats up about EU enlargement ahead of next week’s European Political Community summit in Granada, Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has made clear that Kyiv won’t be fobbed off with second-tier membership. It comes as EU countries mull over a Franco-German proposal for a more gradual approach to EU enlargement.\nTwo-year timetable: Kyiv is aiming to become a “fully fledged candidate for full-fledged membership” of the EU, Shmyhal told POLITICO’s Suzanne Lynch in an interview, vowing to take his country into the Union within the next two years. “We are performing all the maximum efforts to ensure that Ukraine would become a fully fledged member of the European Union. This is of critical importance for all Ukrainians,” he said.\nDoing its homework: Ukraine had met all seven conditions set out by the European Commission in June 2022 to proceed to the next stage in the accession process, Shmyhal said, after a resolution passed by the Cabinet this week. This included recognition of the rights of national minorities — a move largely seen as an olive branch to Budapest, which has objected to the treatment of ethnic Hungarians in Ukraine. The Commission is due to give its verdict on Kyiv’s efforts by the end of October.\nKyiv’s unique position: The prime minister also made the case that Ukraine is in a unique position as it seeks to join the club. “We want to be a fully fledged member because Ukraine today is the unique country … that has paid such a huge price for its will to become a European Union member. No single other candidate country to the European Union has ever had such a huge support of the population — over 90 percent of Ukrainians — wishing, willing and wanting to become a fully fledged European member.”\nGRANADA DECLARATION SET TO BOOST DEFENSE: The EU is set to push its defense capabilities to counter Russia amid a threatening global environment, according to a draft summit declaration seen by POLITICO (and first reported by Bloomberg), Barbara Moens writes in.\nSee you in Granada: “We will strengthen our defense readiness and develop the European defense technological and industrial base, including with more investments,” reads the text for the informal leaders’ meeting to be held in Granada next week. The so-called Granada Declaration aims to prepare a political direction for the next European Commission and also tackles the need of intra-European reform before any future enlargement. Your Friday Playbook author will be on the ground in Granada, along with my colleagues Clea Caulcutt and Sarah Anne Aarup.

France and Italy are set to present a joint paper on tackling illegal migration in the Mediterranean, diplomats from the two countries told my colleagues Clea and Giorgio Leali.\nPaperwork: Officials are hard at work trying to get the document — which could focus on sea monitoring, anti-trafficking action, and prevention in countries of origin — across the finish line. On Sunday, Macron also said he would like to see EU officials and equipment deployment in transit countries, much like the arrangement between the U.K. and France.\nThere’s more: Franco-Italian reconciliation will also be on display in Sicily. France’s Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin and his Italian counterpart Matteo Piantedosi will meet today in Palermo on the margins of a conference on fighting organized crime. The two ministers are set to sign a Franco-Italian cooperation agreement which will cover areas including migration, police and security, a person with direct knowledge of the file said.\nMigration flashpoint: The meeting coincides with growing fears of instability in Africa’s Sahel region, which has been shaken by coups and France’s recent announcement it’s withdrawing troops from Niger. “There cannot be stability in the southern neighbourhood if the Sahel is abandoned to its fate,” Malta’s Prime Minister Robert Abela told my colleague Jacopo Barigazzi.\nDon’t say Russia: “The presence of other international actors, who have contributed to this instability, is prevalent. This is obviously of concern,” said Abela. Sahel will be brought up in the discussions but agenda items focus on the southern neighborhood.\nCommon strategy: Before the meeting, Meloni sent a letter to the MED9 leaders, seen by Playbook, in which she said the gathering was a chance to “agree on a common strategy to stress the importance” of decisions on migration.\nIrony is not lost: In the letter Meloni also called on the leaders to “unblock the impasse” on the EU’s migration pact — which was held up by Italy’s refusal to sign the so-called crisis regulation, which aims to force EU countries to accept migrants in crisis situations. After the hold-up, Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson told a Brussels press conference that a decision on the matter would come “in a few days.” More on that here.\nSlow down: “Italy didn’t say no … it has just asked for time,” said Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, speaking at a press conference in Berlin alongside his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock. Tajani added that more time is needed “to examine the content of this proposal from a legal point of view.”\nSPEAKING OF MELONI — CULTURE WARS, ITALIAN STYLE: From opera bosses to TV stars, Meloni stands accused of purging her political critics from Italy’s most prized cultural institutions. Even EU officials in Brussels are starting to worry, Hannah Roberts reports.\nEU-CHINA\nNEW — BORRELL TO VISIT CHINA NEXT MONTH: High Representative Josep Borrell is off to China — for real this time. “The mission will be in mid-October. The aim is to hold the EU-China Strategic Dialogue,” EU foreign policy spokesperson Nabila Massrali told POLITICO’s Stuart Lau. “The agenda is still being finalized as the Chinese Golden Week holiday period starts.”\nNo more delays: This will be Borrell’s first visit to Beijing since becoming the EU’s high representative. He’ll be conducting the strategic dialogue with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Previous attempts at organizing the trip have been postponed — once because Borrell got coronavirus, followed by a delay caused by the disappearance of Wang’s predecessor Qin Gang.\nSpeaking of vanishing ministers: It remains unclear if Borrell will be able to meet with China’s defense representatives, given the disappearance of Defense Minister Li Shangfu, who U.S. officials say has probably been purged due to an internal investigation.\nSCHOLZ AIMS AT EV PROBE: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz voiced skepticism over the EU’s probe into potentially illegal subsidies for Chinese electric vehicles, saying Europe should not be protectionist. Josh Posaner and Hans von der Burchard have more.\nIN OTHER NEWS\nBALTIC SEA CLEAN-UP MISSION: Europe’s environment commissioner is headed to Palanga, Lithuania, to head up a conference on cleaning up the Baltic Sea. Some 300,000 tons of munitions were dumped into the sea after World War II. Virginijus Sinkevičius will oversee the first broad effort, including Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Finland and Sweden, to address the issue of unexploded ammunition.\nEU money: “We will announce … that we will have a dedicated stream of funding” for the clean-up, Sinkevičius told Playbook. “We now foresee for €1 million for the beginning of the project and we will see if we can tap into additional funds.”\nA JOINT PASSION: Belgian MEP Maria Arena and her businessman son share a common interest: cannabis. The lawmaker, whose properties police raided in connection with the Qatargate corruption scandal, has taken a prominent role in efforts to harmonize EU cannabis laws. Her son, Ugo Lemaire, co-founded a company called BRC & Co that sells CBD products, Eddy Wax reports. Arena denies a conflict of interest, but not everyone is convinced.\nCENTRIST DUDS: Europe’s centrist politicians are disconnected from desperate voters exhausted by seemingly permanent crises, Jamie Dettmer argues in an opinion article for POLITICO. That is making room for populists to thrive, he argues.\nNOW READ: Esther Webber on how a 180-kilometer “railway to nowhere” came to symbolize British decline. The HS2 project has become a huge embarrassment for a nation that once prided itself as the world’s railway pioneer.\nFRIDAY FEATURES: Paul Dallison’s Declassified humor column this week covers Donald Trump’s “batty” whales and the British Airways pilot who was sacked for, well, attempting to fly high.
