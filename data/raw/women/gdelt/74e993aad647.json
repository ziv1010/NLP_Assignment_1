  "body_text": "Bristol bidding to be host city for Women’s Football World Cup 2035\nThere would be a fan zone on Queen Square\nBristol City Council could soon bid to host matches for the Women’s Football World Cup in 2035 at Ashton Gate stadium. The tournament is likely to be held in the UK as the country is the only one bidding.\nThe council would recruit a team of staff to help coordinate the operation, as this year’s Rugby World Cup was “challenging” to deliver with existing levels of staff. A fan zone would be set up on Queen Square, to meet the requirements of being a host city.\nThe bid will be considered by councillors on the strategy and resources policy committee on Monday, October 13. A report to the committee revealed the plans, and gave details of how the tournament could benefit Bristol.\nThe report said: “The UK is the only bidder to host the 2035 FIFA Women’s World Cup. There is therefore a very strong likelihood the UK will be successful in its bid. The World Cup promises to be one of the biggest sports tournaments in the world and bigger than the Olympics.\n“The economic benefit this would bring to Bristol would be enormous, and given this would be on the world stage, it would have a lasting legacy. Not progressing with the bid will mean Bristol will miss out on one of the largest sports tournaments in the world and certainly one that the UK has hosted.”\nThe costs of being selected as a host city have not been made public. But there would likely be a huge boost to the local economy, including with hotels and pubs as thousands of football fans flock to Ashton Gate.\nThe last Women’s World Cup was hosted in Australia and New Zealand in 2023, when England narrowly lost one-nil to Spain in the final. The next world cup will be hosted in Brazil in 2027. This year the Lionesses won the Women’s Euros, beating Spain on penalties in a tense final.\nAlso this year, Ashton Gate hosted quarter-finals and both the semi-finals of the Women’s Rugby World Cup. Visit West said that Bristol’s local economy was boosted by hosting some of the matches, “cementing Bristol’s position as a world-class host city for major international sporting events”.",
