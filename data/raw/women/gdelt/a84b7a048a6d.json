  "body_text": "Orlando Pride, led with a stellar leading record of 18 wins, 2 draws, and 6 losses, set the pace in the 2024 NWSL regular season to wrap up with a tight 3-2 victory over Seattle Reign FC. This did not only ensure that the Pride stay atop the league but also one for the record books with 60 points, surmounting North Carolina Courage's 2018 mark. And the biggest highlight? They did not lose one single game at home, a real fortress of Inter&Co Stadium.\nFollow MLS Multiplex on X (Twitter).\nThis piece looks into some of the defining moments of this historic season and the stage that will present itself in store for Orlando Pride in the playoffs. This was a result of blending individual talents, sharp game strategies, and a fanbase that truly made all the difference.\nOrlando Pride, the Power by Numbers\nPride's stats this season are something: 18 wins, 60 points, both records for a season in the NWSL. But more than just statistics, that speaks volumes of a team operating in perfect symphony. It gets even better at home, where they closed out the regular season with a home record of 10 wins and 3 draws at Inter&Co Stadium, further solidifying their stronghold there.\nOrlando's 46 goals this season didn't go unnoticed either. That total set a new club record in goals scored within one season. Marta, with nine goals this season, being one of the standout players, and players like Ally Watt and Kerry Abello showing up in clutch moments-an incredible forward line that keeps every opponent on high alert.\nMarta: The Legend in Action\nOne of the most iconic figures in women's soccer, Marta scored the winner against Seattle Reign, really nailing down her legacy with the Pride. It was also her 40th goal in NWSL regular seasons, further adding to her legend.\nIn the 57th minute, Marta took a pass from Emily Sams near midfield and beat through Reign defense, nailing a shot into the net as if to remind everyone why her skill and experience just can't be touched. But beyond scoring, her presence opens up the attack by fueling confidence and energy for the whole team.\nDefense and Season Risks\nThe successes notwithstanding, Orlando Pride showed they still have some work to do, particularly in defending against aerial plays that allowed goals like Maddie Mercado's. While it is equally important that Pride's offense is one of the best in the league, it must be sharp enough not to allow surprises going into the playoffs.\n2024 Playoffs: The Next Battle\nOrlando Pride enters the playoffs as the one to beat. With the top seed locked in their pocket, their first matchup has an opponent slot open awaiting upcoming matches for the eighth seed: a November 8 home date against the eighth-seeded team.\nPlaying at home, Pride look to their support once again and the already familiar turf of Inter&Co Stadium. To opponents, that is more than a disadvantage: pride faces an opponent that never lost on their own ground, full of enthusiasm.",
