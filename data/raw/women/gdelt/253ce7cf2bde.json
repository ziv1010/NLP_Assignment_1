Once the list gets long enough, it’s time to debate: Which runway shows thrilled us the most? What songs could we not stop listening to? What movies are we still thinking about? It’s not about ubiquity—just because something was everywhere, that doesn’t mean it’s good, after all. Instead, it’s about what inspired us, made us click “Add to Cart,” or just plain felt fun.\nPart gift guide, part year in review, the Bazaar 100 is our list of everything that brought us joy in 2023—listed in no particular order. Read on to see it all.\n01\n“Literally Me” Miu Miu\nLyst’s brand of the year delighted fans with two runway shows that riffed on the messy details of our busy everyday lives. Only Mrs. Prada could make a thrown-on hoodie or an overstuffed bag look this witty or this chic.\n02\nBarbie Lives Up to the Hype\nThe pink-hued frenzy leading up to the release was fun, but more importantly, the film seems destined to become a classic: a funny, feminist, meticulously crafted confection that will be playing at tween sleepover parties until the end of time.\n03\nA New Champion in the Battle for Sneaker Supremacy\nThe Mexico 66 is sleek, sporty, and favored by Bella Hadid—what more could you want in a shoe?\n04\nFashion’s Unofficial Motto in 2023: Be Transparent\nFrom Tibi’s tissue-thin T-shirts to Prada’s crystal-clear tank tops and dresses, spring and summer collections were filled with delicate (and wearable!) sheer layers.\n05\nWhen Rihanna Upstaged the Super Bowl\nShe performed at the halftime show in scarlet Loewe and Alaïa and broke Twitter with a casual belly rub announcing her second pregnancy.\n06\nAll Red Everything\nRihanna was on to something—from the runways to the sidewalks, shades of cherry and crimson are everywhere.\n07\nHot Labor Summer\nFor the first time in over 60 years, the two unions that represent actors and screenwriters shut down Hollywood with simultaneous strikes. Picket lines replaced red carpets as SAG-AFTRA and WGA members protested for better working conditions, receiving broad support from moviegoing audiences.\n08\nFoodie Beauty\nLatte makeup, blueberry milk nails, strawberry girl makeup—the beauty community’s hunger for TikTok-friendly content brought on a feast of food-inspired trends this year. At the same time, perfume went gourmet, with pistachio scents like Kayali’s Yum Pistachio Gelato and vanilla fragrances like D.S. & Durga’s Deep Dark Vanilla taking over.\n09\nA Twisted Beach Read\nMost years don’t have an It novel, but The Guest—Emma Cline’s dark portrait of a young woman coming apart in the Hamptons—really hit the zeitgeist.\n10\nA Menorah for Party Girls Everywhere\nFor this year's Hanukkah, New York designer Susan Alexandra brought her signature sense of whimsy and love of her Jewish heritage to a colorful, spiritual collection.\n11\nSofia Richie Grainge, It Girl of the Year\nSofia’s quiet luxury style became a viral sensation thanks to her wedding to Elliot Grainge. Months later, her simple beauty videos and #GetReadyWithMe TikToks continue to inspire thousands on social media.\n12\nL.A.’s Fashion-World Dominance\nChanel, Versace, and Balenciaga all staged runway shows in Los Angeles this year—a trend arguably kicked off by Celine’s show at the Art Deco Wiltern theater in December 2022.\n13\nEveryone’s New Favorite Blush\nThat soft pink flush you’ve noticed on just about anyone under the age of 30? It’s not youth—it’s Rare Beauty’s Soft Pinch Liquid Blush. When the weightless, buildable formula went viral this year, it kicked off a craze for liquid blush for dewy skin.\n14\nThat Big Summer Tour …\nBeyoncé is no stranger to raising the bar for herself as an entertainer, and with the Renaissance World Tour, she did it again. Fans across the globe brought out their best metallic garb to cheer and sing along to an album that celebrates dance music’s unapologetic Black and queer roots. “Release your wiggle” isn’t so much a lyric as it is a lifestyle.\n15\n… and the Other One …\nDid you really experience summer 2023 if friendship bracelets and secret song theories didn’t take over your social media feeds? Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour (yes, it’s still not over!) is on its way to becoming the highest-grossing concert tour of all time, proving you should never underestimate the power of Swiftie Nation.\n16\n… Which You Could Also See at the Theater\nThe first legs of Swift’s and Beyoncé’s respective tours brought in over $1 billion combined—but why stop there? Both artists also released full-length feature-film versions, allowing fans to relive the concerts of the year all over again.\n17\nTiffany & Co.’s Flagship Gets a Major Makeover\nIn April, the brand threw open the doors to its reconceived Fifth Avenue flagship, which is now filled with artwork from names like Jenny Holzer, Damien Hirst, and Rashid Johnson.\n18\nA Moving Memoir About How Profoundly Friendship Can Shape Us\nIn the Pulitzer Prize–winning Stay True, New Yorker staff writer Hua Hsu recounts his friendship with an Asian-American college friend whose quest for identity and belonging informed his own.\n19\nPhoebe Philo Is (Really, Truly) Back\nIn 2021, three years after ending her wildly influential tenure as the creative director of Celine, Philo announced she would be launching a new label. This year, it finally debuted, thrilling fans with its weird, funky glamour, tailored to the female gaze.\n20\nIce Spice, Baby\nThe orange-haired rapper was everywhere this year, from the Barbie soundtrack to the Met Gala to your local Dunkin’ Donuts, where she released a signature drink.\n21\nThe Triumphant Return of Lip Gloss\nWhile balms will always hold a special place in our hearts, high-shine lip glosses from top brands like Fenty Beauty and Dior topped our list of makeup favorites in 2023.\n22\nThe Hottest Shoe of the Year: A Mary Jane\nLuxury sourcing agents were kept busy tracking down Alaïa’s perennially sold-out fishnet flats this year. After months on the waiting list, the bare-it-all twist on a ballet flat is back in stock (for now).\n23\nLaid-Back Celebrity Breakup Announcements\nFirst, Jada Pinkett Smith revealed that she and Will Smith have been living apart for seven years. Then, Meryl Streep confirmed she’s been separated from her husband, Don Gummer, for six years. And just last week, Cardi B admitted she’s “been single for a minute now.” There’s something very old-school and appealing about celebs announcing their breakups casually, months (or years) after the fact.\n24\nThat Sports Guy Who Got a New Girlfriend …\nTaylor Swift’s romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce surprised everyone—and brought a whole new subset of viewers to the NFL.\n25\n… and Other Unexpected Celebrity Romances\nNo one had Kylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet on their bingo card for 2023. Or Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny. Or Ariana Grande and SpongeBob.\n26\nAn It Watch With an Epic Wait List\nAll the chicest women are lining up to get their hands on Cartier’s Baignoir watch. The modernized classic shines on a leather strap and dazzles in the form of a gold bangle.\n27\nThe Beauty Gadget Our Editors Are Obsessed With\nThere’s no shortage of at-home facial tools on the market these days, but Therabody's TheraFace Mask is on an entirely different level. A mask that provides LED benefits with a side of face massage? Count us in.\n28\nThe Rise of Closet Sales\nEver the trendsetter, Chloë Sevigny kicked off a summer of shop-my-wardrobe pop-ups when she hosted a closet sale in downtown Manhattan on Mother’s Day. Soon enough, Jemima Kirke and a range of fashion insiders and influencers followed suit, offering fans the chance to buy IRL the clothes they’d been admiring online.\n29\nTikTok’s Gender Studies\nGirl math. Girl dinner. Guys who can’t stop thinking about the Roman Empire. This year, TikTok’s biggest trends were all about explaining life inside the gender binary.\n30\nThe Ne Plus Ultra of Bottle Episodes\nSixty-six minutes long and utterly devastating, The Bear’s Christmas episode guest-starred John Mulaney, Sarah Paulson, and Jamie Lee Curtis at the top of her game.\n31\nThe Red Lip of the Year\nLegendary makeup artist Pat McGrath’s Elson lip shade went viral after it was worn by (who else?) Taylor Swift.\n32\nThe Continuing Renaissance of Tory Burch\nTory Burch’s shift from preppy staple to fashion-girl grail has been building for several years, but really hit its stride in 2023.\n33\nA Historical Novel About Hypermodern Topics\nA twisty tale of identity, self-mythology and the writing life set in Victorian England, The Fraud reminds us that Zadie Smith is one of our greatest living novelists.\n34\nSimone Biles’s Comeback …\nFollowing a monthslong hiatus, the Olympic gymnast won her sixth all-around world championship gold medal at this year’s World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Belgium—making her the gymnast with the most medals in history (37, to be exact).\n35\n… and Sha’carri Richardson’s, Too\nThe professional sprinter broke boundaries and shattered racial stereotypes with her big win this year, when, at the 2023 World Athletics Championship in Budapest, she once again proved she is the fastest woman in the world. Known for her colorful hair, vibrant personality, and pristine makeup even while on the racetrack, Richardson knows she’s that girl.\n36\nJackets With Attitude\nTough, oversize aviator jackets were the final layer everyone wanted to wear, from celebrities leaving dinner at Sushi Park to the street-style throngs in New York, Milan, and Paris. Our favorite oversize take came from the Row.\n37\nThe Performances We’re Still Thinking About\nBetween Lily Gladstone in Killers of the Flower Moon, Sandra Hüller in Anatomy of a Fall, Emily Blunt in Oppenheimer, and Penélope Cruz in Ferrari, women are going to dominate the upcoming Academy Awards.\n38\nThe Kids Who Sued the State of Montana Over Climate Change—and Won\nIn Held v. Montana, 16 young people (ages 5 to 22) argued that the state had failed to protect their constitutional right to a “clean and healthful environment” by issuing permits for fossil fuel companies. When the judge sided with them, the door to legal protections against climate change opened just a bit wider.\n39\nAn Indie-Rock Supergroup for the 21st Century\nPhoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus, and Julien Baker are all stars in their own right, but they created something even bigger when they came together with their first full record as Boygenius, The Record, an album of songs celebrating and complicating queer female friendship.\n40\nQuiet Luxury Gets Loud\nWealth whispers, but Gen Z does not. On TikTok, an app impossible to enjoy on mute, Zoomers everywhere discovered the subtle fabulosity of a worn-in Birkin and the Row’s Zip platform boots. And yes, they made sure to scream it from the digital rooftops with aspirational getting-ready videos, #OOTDs, and Sofia Richie outfit re-creations.\n41\nHunter Schafer’s Red-Carpet Reboot\nAfter the strikes ended and movie premieres came back, it was Euphoria star Schafer—on tour to promote The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes—who got the fashion party started again with a series of striking looks from Schiaparelli, McQueen, and Marni.\n42\nSabato De Sarno’s Gucci Debut\nSabato De Sarno named his first collection for Gucci “Ancora,” a word that means “still here” in Italian. His runway of 55 looks was a pared-back vision that focused on an ever-present heritage. There were Jackie bags covered in diamond netting, lots and lots of horsebit, and logo monogram short-shorts worn with the infamous GG-buckle belt.\n43\nHip-Hop’s 50th Birthday\nThe genre celebrated its history (and its future) all year long, with everything from star-studded surprise performances at Yankee Stadium to celebrations of the trailblazers behind its most iconic looks.\n44\nThe Perfect Penny Loafer\nEmily Ratajkowski wore this shoe on one of her many neighborhood fashion-show dog walks this summer, causing it to sell out instantly. But insiders were already huge fans of Haller’s loafer, which looks like high-end menswear and feels like slippers.\n45\nSlicked-Back Buns Were Everywhere\nThe ballerina bun is nothing new, but this was the year we saw the simple style on just about every It girl—along with all the runways and all over our news feeds.\n46\nSarah Burton’s Final Bow at McQueen\nAfter working at Alexander McQueen for 26 years, half of that time as its creative director, the British designer created a final collection that was both tender and vulnerable, with chiffon gowns and leather bustiers that conjured images of vulvas and spines. In her show notes, Burton wrote that she was inspired by female anatomy, red roses, and Queen Elizabeth I. She also dedicated the show to McQueen, “whose wish was always to empower women.”\n47\nThe Charming Ubiquity of Pedro Pascal\nThe actor became everyone’s crush (and “internet daddy”) this year thanks to his style, dashing looks, and humor, which he showcased in repeat surprise appearances on Saturday Night Live.\n48\nA Novel That’s Impossible to Put Down\nSometimes it seemed like everyone on the subway in 2023 was carrying R.F. Kuang’s bright-yellow novel about cultural appropriation and identity. Yellowface’s story is as sly as the design—you won’t be able to stop texting your friends about the most outrageous parts.\n49\n“Ludicrously Capacious Bags”\nWe’re still mourning the end of Succession, but at least the show ended with a bang—and gave us a memorable new catchphrase on the way out. Tom’s blistering speech about a poorly chosen purse was a perfect example of what the show did best: sharply written, devastatingly delivered analysis of status, power, and style.\n50\nPeak Ribbon\nBows became a symbol for femininity that women everywhere wanted to wear—woven into their hair, tied onto their bags, and attached to every dress, sweater, and shoe they owned. Blame Simone Rocha and Sandy Liang, whose frothy visions of girlhood ushered in a ribbon economy.\n51\nOne Headband to Rule Them All\nHeadbands haven’t been this popular since Blair Waldorf’s heyday. Jennifer Behr’s sophisticated satin silhouette was worn by celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence and Sofia Richie Grainge.\n52\nThe Coronation of Coco Gauff\nAt 19, the tennis player became a bona fide new star, winning her first Grand Slam at this year’s U.S. Open and thanking those who didn’t support her along the way. “To those who thought [they] were putting water on my fire, you’re really adding gas to it,” she said. “And now I’m really burning so bright right now.”\n53\nDior’s Love Letter to Indian Artistry\nMaria Grazia Chiuri took Dior to India for a Pre-Fall show that highlighted the incredible craftsmanship of the country’s artisans. Chiuri works closely with Karishma Swami, the artistic director of Chanakya International atelier to make the house’s intricate textiles. Together they also created the Chanakya Foundation school in 2015, which aims to empower women through an education in crafts.\n54\nThe Year’s Most Lovesick Man\nThe Amazon Prime adaptation of Taylor Jenkins Reid’s beloved novel Daisy Jones & The Six inducted a new character into the Hall of Famous Yearning Men. We fell for ’70s rock star Billy Dunne the way we fell for his forebearers, among them Mr. Darcy, Peeta Mellark, and the Hot Priest in Fleabag.\n55\nGenre-Bending Queer Shows\nThis year, gay stories weren’t relegated to either B-plots in a television sitcom or Very Important films in the queer canon. Movies and TV depicted queer culture in a kaleidoscope of ways: From Bottoms, a raucous lesbian teen comedy, to All of Us Strangers, a heartbreaking gay ghost story. From Red, White & Royal Blue, crown jewel of the YA romance-to-streaming pipeline, to Fellow Travelers, a lesson in gay history with sex scenes that would make your civics teacher blush. From Passages, an unflinching depiction of a queer family’s emotional warfare, to Saltburn, a tantalizingly queer-coded depiction of class warfare.\n56\nWhen Everyone Stopped Wearing Pants\nWant to go out wearing nothing but a pair of bedazzled Miu Miu briefs and black stockings? Thanks to this year’s runway trends, you finally can.\n57\nThe Viral Mascara\nThis beloved drugstore buy was at the center of a TikTok scandal called #MascaraGate this year, which spurred meaningful conversations around beauty influencer authenticity. As a result, the mascara flew off of shelves, with fans praising its superior lengthening and defining abilities.\n58\nThe Drag Queens Who Fought Back\nIn a year when their right to perform was challenged in state legislatures across the United States, drag queens rallied to protect their art form—and fans rallied with them.\n59\nLouis Vuitton’s A-List Entourage\nFrom Cate Blanchett to Zendaya, Nicolas Ghesquiere really knows how to maximize his brand’s impact on the red carpet.\n60\nA Bag With a Statement Handle\nThe metallic top handle of Matthieu Blazy’s Sardine bag is shaped like a small herring, and it’s sexy in a way most standard straps are not. When you hold the bag, you feel powerful—like you’re holding something strong, not just a leather container for your credit cards and lipstick.\n61\nCelebrity Couples Coordinate Fits\nWho could forget Hailey and Justin Bieber’s mismatched party outfits for a Rhode launch event? Or Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny’s courtside style? Or Prince William color-coordinating his ties to Kate Middleton’s monochromatic ensembles? This was the year celebs realized that power-dressing is more effective if you do it as a pair.\n62\nThe Best Vest\nEditor-turned–Attersee designer Isabel Wilkinson Schor understands the power of understated, structured separates. This year, she opened Attersee’s first IRL store for like-minded editors, designers, and other fashion multi-hyphenates to shop her power vests, dresses, and pants.\n63\nThe Easiest Manicure Ever\nWe spotted short nails backstage at Christian Siriano, Kate Spade, and Proenza Schouler. But the nail trend didn’t end there—it appeared on the red carpet at the Met Gala, the CFDA Awards, and beyond.\n64\nOur Beckham Obsession\nNetflix’s four-part documentary about soccer star David Beckham’s rise to fame and his marriage to Posh Spice was the unexpected streaming hit of the year. Something about the celebrity couple—and their ’90s style—captured our collective attention and hasn’t quite let go.\n65\nA Uniquely Humorous and Tragic Romp\nBig Swiss, a novel about a transcriptionist seducing the patient whose therapy sessions she’s transcribing, is both a send-up of post-hipster utopias like Hudson, New York, and a deep exploration of grief and depression. Jen Beagin is the rightful heir to stylists like George Saunders.\n66\nAbortion’s Winning Streak at the Polls\nOver a year after Roe was overturned, voters have proved over and over that they want to preserve a women’s right to choose.\n67\nThe Quiet Ascendance of Greta Lee\nBetween Past Lives and The Morning Show, 2023 was her year.\n68\nNew York’s New Guard of Designers\nBrands like Diotima, Willy Chavarria, and Luar are at the height of their creative powers, adding a new level of excitement to the city’s Fashion Week.\n69\nRalph Lauren’s Return to New York\nOver his 83 years, Lauren has come to embody a certain kind of New York glamour, so his brand’s post-pandemic absence left a notable hole in the city’s Fashion Week calendar. When he returned this fall with a glitzy runway at the Brooklyn Navy Yards, it felt like a warm hug.\n70\nThe Status Blanket\nIt exists. And it’s woven from the softest wool and cashmere. Perch it on the back of a desk chair or sofa, and wait for the compliments to roll in.\n71\nSofia Coppola Core\nWith the hotly anticipated release of Priscilla and the publication of her first book, Sofia Coppola Archive 1999–2023, every It girl’s favorite director won 2023.\n72\nMaximillian Davis Brings the Cool to Ferragamo\nThe designer is reinvigorating Ferragamo by drawing on the experimental spirit of London club culture, his own Caribbean heritage, and a bold new perspective on elegance.\n73\nSZA’s Big Feelings\n2023 was the year to stop underestimating the R&B star, as her second full-length album, S.O.S., became a streaming force with dreamy, lovelorn singles like “Kill Bill” and “Snooze” taking over the charts and TikTok.\n74\nThe Year Celebrities Actually Told All\nBabs! Britney! Harry! 2023 was the year celebrities gave us what we really want: unfiltered retellings of their lives and their wavering relationships with fame.\n75\nThe Redux of Body Sprays\nAll the online chatter about perfume layering this year spawned the resurgence of body sprays—a category we haven’t touched since the ’90s. Brands like Henry Rose, Sol de Janeiro, and Ellis Brooklyn launched new light and airy scented mists, designed to be layered with your favorite perfume or simply applied often over the course of the day. It’s the perfect indulgence for those too sensitive to partake in other scent trends.\n76\nJenna Lyons, the Realest Housewife\nThe onetime J.Crew designer shook up The Real Housewives of New York City with her deadpan humor, impeccable taste, and steadfast refusal to be anyone but herself.\n77\nDaniel Lee’s Burberry Reboot\nMr. Lee reimagined the British-with-a-capital-B brand with a new Burberry blue, a logo that brought back the Prorsum Knight, and a grunge-y first collection that twisted the brand’s famous plaid with skirts, leggings, and coats in deep shades of purple and yellow.\n78\nTikTok’s Favorite Primer\nUsually being tacky is seen as a bad thing, but in the case of this gel-based primer, it works. Not only does it dry down with a translucent finish that works on all skin tones, but the primer is formulated with hyaluronic acid to help keep skin looking plump.\n79\nPamela Anderson’s New Narrative\nWhile on a press tour for her documentary and memoir, the blonde bombshell took full control of her public persona with the help of some iconic looks. From a sweet vintage Alaïa dress to a punchy archival Yohji Yamamoto suit, Anderson proved her style is fearless—and when she appeared at Paris Fashion Week without makeup, her confidence inspired a new generation of women.\n80\nA Hot Hotel for Fashion Insiders\nPalm Heights Grand Cayman launched in 2019, but this was the year it really came into its own as the premier destination for A-listers and fashion insiders like EmRata and Paloma Elsesser.\n81\nAn Ode to the Original Quiet Luxury Role Model\nSunita Kumar Nair’s coffee-table book about Carolyn Bessette Kennedy is deeply researched and downright gorgeous. Buy it for anyone in your life who knows there’s nothing basic about a well-cut white button-down or a camel-colored skirt.\n82\nIt Bakeries\nDid you find yourself standing in a block-long line sometime this year for a pastry? The answer is: Probably. Breakout bakeries like L’Appartment 4F in Brooklyn Heights (croissants!) and From Lucie (Marie Antoinette–esque cakes!) in the East Village encouraged New Yorkers to give in to their sweet cravings.\n83\nThe Book That Captures This Bizarre Moment in Politics\nLeftist writer Naomi Klein digs into the online life of her doppelgänger, Naomi Wolf, who has descended into the world of far-right conspiracy theories and looming fascism. Lucid, moving, and compulsively readable, this is a dark dive into the shifting nature of reality and the existential threat of digital distortion.\n84\nAn Impossible-to-Describe Film\nGreek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos has cornered the market on exquisitely directed, appealingly strange art-house fare since his English-language debut The Lobster in 2015. In his hotly anticipated drama Poor Things, Emma Stone chews the sumptuous scenery as a Victorian Franken-woman.\n85\nLauren Halsey’s Triumphant Met Takeover\nHalsey’s rooftop installation this past spring at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, modeled on the museum’s Temple of Dendur, served as both a funkified monument to her life growing up in South Central L.A. and a beacon for artists everywhere historically been overlooked by the art world’s gatekeepers. Halsey has also used art to give back with Summaeverythang, a community center in South Central.\n86\nOlivia Rodrigo Does It Again\nThe pop dynamo proved she’s here to stay with her stellar sophomore album Guts, released to critical acclaim earlier this fall. Rodrigo pays homage to rock idols like Courtney Love and Alanis Morissette with witty lyrics and bang-your-head beats.\n87\nJacob Elordi, Purse Man\nJacob Elordi—the Kissing Booth star turned Sofia Coppola leading man—has had a big year. Along with the release of four major films, he’s turned the spotlight onto one of his favorite street-style accessories: the purse. His delectable collection ranges from Bottega Veneta’s spacious Andiamo tote to a delicate leather crossbody bag from Celine.\n88\nTabi Talk Goes Mainstream\nMaison Margiela’s cleft-toe shoes have divided fashion insiders for years. But when a so-called Tabi thief went viral on TikTok for swiping his date’s beloved shoes, the argument for why they’re a must-have got much clearer.\n89\nFear of God Hosts Its First, Blockbuster Runway Show\nFor the first time in the brand’s 10-year history, designer Jerry Lorenzo took over the Hollywood Bowl with a star-studded crowd, a long-awaited Adidas collab, and a collection that was an ode to California sportswear with belted blazers, suede-fringe western jeans, and glossy glazed moto pants.\n90\nA Surprisingly Sensual Dystopian Novel\nC Pam Zhang’s follow-up to her 2020 debut, How Much of These Hills Is Gold, explores the ethics of pursuing desire and pleasure in the face of widespread human adversity.\n91\nCelebrity Makeup Artists Deliver the Goods\nMakeup artists are the original beauty influencers—and 2023 saw them reach new heights. Mario Dedivanovic’s Makeup by Mario SurrealSkin foundation became one of the year’s must-have products, while Patrick Ta’s Major Headlines Double-Take Crème & Powder Blush Duo and Charlotte Tilbury’s Hollywood Flawless Filter continued to dominate social media, especially among Gen Z. Bazaar editors also couldn’t get enough of Gucci Westman’s Westman Atelier Skin Activator Serum and Eye Want You mascara, as well as Jo Baker’s Bakeup Tarantulash mascara, and Bobbi Brown's Jones Road Miracle Balms.\n92\nDressing to Match Your Dog\nFashion dog moms everywhere rejoiced when their favorite designers made pup-size versions of runway pieces, from exclusive pet collections launching on Ssense to Sandy Liang teaming up with pet brand Little Beast. A ribbed crop top for your dog? Why not!\n93\nAn Un-Dupeable Candle\nThere’s no replicating the scent of Loewe’s earthy tomato garden candle—or its basketball-size ceramic holder.\n94\nBalenciaga’s Genius Runway Casting\nFashion critic Cathy Horyn was the unexpected breakout model of the year, after Demna cast her for his Paris runway alongside Amanda Lepore, Isabelle Huppert, and his mother. As the creative director wrote in the show notes, his Spring collection was a tribute not only to “crafting the garment,” but also to all of those who have shaped him and his sartorial vision.\n95\nThe Mainstreaming of Romance Novels\nBetween highly anticipated, swoony releases by Emily Henry and Curtis Sittenfeld, an East Coast branch of romance bookstore the Ripped Bodice opening in Brooklyn, and 10.3 billion cumulative views of #romancebooks on TikTok, 2023 was the year we read with our hearts on our sleeves—and even sought out more spice (IYKYK).\n96\nExperimental Bridal Fashion\nMore and more women are playing with style when they get married (Tabis very much included), and we’re here for it.\n97\nA Substack Hit Bag\nThis was the casual bag every insider actually carried offline—and then raved about in their newsletter.\n98\nBlackpink Rocks Coachella\nThe reigning queens of K-pop made history at Coachella this year.

Rihanna, Beyoncé, and Zendaya were just some of the guests who lined the runway on Paris’s Pont Neuf—and it’s not hard to imagine any of them wearing William’s digitized version of Vuitton’s Damier check pattern on an upcoming red carpet.\n100\nPrep Comes Back With a Vengeance\nToday’s most exciting designers aren’t celebrating the old-money lifestyle; they’re perverting it. With Miu Miu’s schoolgirl skirts the size of a belt and Thom Browne’s zany tweed basics made more for misfits than Ivy League elites, the foundation of American style is going through a dark, twisted, and surprisingly slinky rebrand.",
