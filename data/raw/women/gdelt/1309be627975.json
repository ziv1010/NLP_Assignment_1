Women, a side that was established in 2017.\nThey aren't to be confused with Southampton Women's FC or Southampton Saints Girls and Ladies Football Club, who have existed in the city since the 1970s but are not affiliated with the men's club.\nWith a win over Reading and a penalty shootout win over Bristol City, the Saints have made a promising start to the Conti Cup campaign in Group D.\nElsewhere, It's exceptionally tight at the top of the Women's Championship after 11 games played, with Southampton only one point behind Charlton Athletic and Sunderland and only one point ahead of Crystal Palace and Birmingham City.\nA familiar face in the dugout\nWe'll go head-to-head with a club legend this evening as Southampton are coached by former Gunner, Marieanne Spacey-Cale.\nAn incredibly gifted deep-lying forward, Spacey-Cale scored 79 goals during her nine-year spell at the club and won a string of domestic titles and trophies from 1993 to 2002.\nSpacey-Cale has been in the dugout for the Saints since 2018 and is also the club's Head of Girls and Women's Football.\nPreviewing the tie\nWalti on Southampton: \"We take Southampton completely seriously and we've seen a lot of good clips to analyse them. We've definitely seen where their strengths are but at the same time, we want to dominate that game.\n\"We want to go into that game and win it in front of a great crowd and that's what we're looking forward to.\"\nSpacey-Cale on us: “Arsenal will be a fantastic test for us, and we’ll put on a show for our fans, who have been with us every step of the way up until now.\n“We go into the fixture without any pressure on us - It’s about going out there, enjoying it and giving a good account of ourselves.\"\nTeam news\nWith no press conference this week, Jonas Eidevall has not provided an update on the fitness of Kim Little, Vivianne Miedema and Jen Beattie who all missed out on the matchday squad at the weekend.\nLeah Williamson, Laura Wienroither and Teyah Goldie continue their ACL rehabilitation at London Colney.\nMatch officials\nReferee: Stacey Pearson\nAssistant Referee: Harley Hetherington\nAssistant Referee: Michael Butcher\nFourth Official: Lorraine Catchpole\nHow to watch\nA record crowd is expected at St Mary's this evening but for those unable to make the journey, the game will be streamed on Southampton's Saints Play platform for £2.\nYou can see all the key moments and a behind-the-scenes look at matchday via our social media channels.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
