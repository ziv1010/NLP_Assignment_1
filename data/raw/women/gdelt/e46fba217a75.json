  "body_text": "This week, the Sports Journalism Awards nominees were announced, and The Athletic has dominated the category of Audio Documentary.\nFour of our podcasts have been selected and, in case you missed them, we’ve provided some links below for you to listen.\nBobby ’90\nThis is Bobby ’90, a four-part special podcast series from The Athletic to mark what would have been Sir Bobby Robson’s 90th birthday. In the first episode of the series, Sir Bobby talks about his childhood and growing up in the north east.\nAdvertisement\nAs preparation for his final book, Sir Bobby looked back over his remarkable life story with George Caulkin. Thanks to the generosity of Sir Bobby’s family, we can publish the recording of those conversations, featuring memories of his life as a miner’s son, watching some of the greatest-ever Newcastle United teams, and embarking on an incredible football career of his own.\nWe also hear the story of Sir Bobby’s repeated bouts of cancer and how he came to launch his “last and greatest team”: the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation.\nThe shows were written by Sir Bobby and George and were mixed and edited by Ollie Bellwood.\nYou can listen to the full series for free on the Pod on the Tyne feed.\nFor more information, and to donate, please go to sirbobbyrobsonfoundation.org.uk\nAccess All Areas: Brentford\nJay Harris is given access all areas to one of the most intriguing clubs in the Premier League: Brentford.\nLast season, the club had the lowest wage bill in the top tier yet were able to do the double over champions Manchester City and, in their short two-year stay (so far) in the league, have beaten all of the ‘Big Six’ at least once.\nBut how do they do it? That’s what we’re here to tell you.\nFirst up, a whizz through the history of Brentford since owner Matthew Benham took over.\nHear from chief executive Jon Varney, head coach Thomas Frank, captain Christian Norgaard, performance director Ben Ryan, director of football Phil Giles, women’s head coach Karleigh Osborne, technical director Lee Dykes, director Nity Raj and club announcer Peter Gilham as they tell the Bees’ story.\nListen to the full series for free on The Athletic’s narrative feed, Go Deeper.\nSound of Arsenal\nThis special podcast has been designed to take you into the crowd at the Emirates Stadium using a technique called ‘binaural audio’.
