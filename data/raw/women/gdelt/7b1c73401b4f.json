  "body_text": "Women's FA Cup final sets attendance record with Wembley Stadium sell-out\nThe Women's FA Cup final between Chelsea and Manchester United at Wembley Stadium on Sunday saw the event sell out for the first time ever.\nThe attendance of 77,390 was not only a record crowd for a Women's FA Cup final, but a world record for a women's domestic match, beating a league game between Barcelona and Atletico Madrid and an English record for any women's club game - beating Arsenal vs Wolfsburg in the UWCL two weeks ago.\nThe final, which capped off an extraordinary year for the women's game in England, exceeded last year's event where 49,094 spectators witnessed Chelsea's victory over Manchester City to claim the trophy at Wembley. The attendance broke the previous record for the competition, surpassing the 45,423 fans who watched Chelsea defeat Arsenal in the 2018 final, which was also a record for a women's club game in England at that time.\nReflecting on the historic achievement, Baroness Sue Campbell, the FA director of women's football, expressed her delight, stating:\n\"This is still very early days for the professionalisation of the women's game, but it speaks volumes of what's happened and how well the leagues and clubs are doing and the sort of following that the players are starting to get as individuals.\n\"To break the world record is a massive statement and a wonderful marker as to where the women's game has come in this country.\n\"A lot of credit goes to all of the players and the clubs in the Barclays Women’s Super League, the Barclays Women’s Championship and below that, but also credit to everybody that's worked at the FA to make sure this is a reality,\" she continued.\n\"I've said before that we've come a long way, but we’ve still got an incredibly long way to go, and we know that.\n\"But it's another marker in the sand that the game in this country is now alive and well, flourishing and growing.\"",
