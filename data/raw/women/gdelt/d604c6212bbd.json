The singer wore a tie-dyed, green shirt paired with a navy baseball cap and black thick-frame glasses.\nIt didn't take long for fans to notice that he was looking more tanned than usual and the 50-year-old admitted he had been for a spray tan and hadn't had time to wash it off.\nOne viewer reacted on X/Twitter: \"Is Robbie Williams ok? Had to take a double look didn’t even recognise him @loosewomen #loosewomen.\"\nAnother jested: \"@loosewomen @robbiewilliams fake tan hands #loosewomen #robbiewilliams.\"\nWhile a third quipped: \"Shows what he thinks of this programme...he couldn't be a**ed to change out of his pyjamas.\"\nAnd a fourth joked: \"How did Robbie Williams seamlessly turn into Garth from Wayne's World, minus the hair? #LooseWomen.\"\nRobbie's Loose Women appearance comes hot on the heels of his return to Soccer Aid on Sunday evening.\nThe Angels hitmaker has been at the helm of the charity football match since its inception in 2006 and made a number of cameos throughout the game at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge.\nHe looked smart wearing a blue suit with his grey hair styled into a mohawk. However, some viewers were left doing a double take and admitted they didn't recognise him.\nDon't miss: Loose Women presenter tipped for Strictly 2024 line-up in rival channel swap\nDon't miss: Loose Women's Denise Welch in tears as she's reunited with nurse who saved son\nDon't miss: Eamonn Holmes' GB News co-star breaks silence on 'horrid time' after Ruth split\nOne person tweeted: “Do you know I’ve only just turned it on and I didn’t recognise Robbie Williams at first with his new haircut lol.”\nSomeone else wrote: “Robbie Williams looks so different these days. I wouldn’t have recognised him if it wasn’t Soccer Aid.”\nElsewhere on Wednesday's Loose Women, Denise Welch confirmed that her son, Matty Healy, is engaged.\nThe 1975 frontman and his new girlfriend sparked engagement rumours earlier this week when they both shared a cryptic post to their Instagram Stories. And now Matty's mum has confirmed the news to be true and it turns out the couple have been engaged for \"weeks\".\nAfter returning from the break, Christine Lampard announced there was some exciting breaking news before she exclaimed: \"Congratulations to our Denise because you're soon to be the mother of the groom.\"\nA smiling Denise replied: \"I am...He's got engaged to Gabriella Bechtel, Gabriette she's known as, and it's with a Black Diamond. He had it made for her. And I couldn't be more thrilled. She's from Los Angeles. She's absolutely gorgeous.\"\nLoose Women airs weekdays at 12.30pm on ITV.",
