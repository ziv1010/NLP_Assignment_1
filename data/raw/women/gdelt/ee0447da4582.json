  "body_text": "Alisha Lehmann is letting fans see the real her — no filter. The 27-year-old Swiss athlete has jumped on Fanvue, giving her millions of followers a more personal, unfiltered look at her life beyond the pitch and the headlines.\nHer football story is stacked: debuted for Switzerland at 17, 65 caps, FA Cup final with West Ham, became a fan favorite at Aston Villa, lifted the Serie A title with Juventus, had a quick stop at Como, and just recently signed a 2.5-year deal with Leicester City to return to the Women’s Super League.\nOff the field, she has built a strong public presence, with 16 million Instagram followers, brand shoots with Tezenis, regular media attention, and a profile that has kept her in the spotlight for years. Now Fanvue is where she’s showing the side people actually want: relaxed, real, and way more personable than the usual social-media highlights.\nHer page is loaded with exclusive stuff: pro photoshoots in stylish, confident outfits (classy, no nudes), face-covered poses, training and recovery clips, everyday moments fans rarely see, and football nostalgia — including the viral Ronaldinho crossbar challenge she did for the launch (the one where the ball accidentally nailed the cameraman…a classic).\nIt’s the kind of behind-the-scenes access that makes fans feel like they’re actually along for the ride instead of just watching from afar. Lehmann is giving people more of who she really is, not just the polished version.\nFanvue Co-Founder Will Monange said:\n“Alisha has a strong connection with her fans already. Fanvue lets her share more of her life. More openly, more personally, and completely in her control.”\nSubs kick off at $8/month (cheaper if you lock in longer) and deliver that closer, more real look. Fanvue just raised $22 million, but for Lehmann it’s dead simple: more fans getting the authentic her, while she runs the show her way.\nFrom goal scorer to straight-up fan favorite, she’s handing people the keys to her world.\nPrices and availability are accurate as of the time of publication and are subject to change without notice. Please check the retailer’s website for the most up-to-date pricing information.",
