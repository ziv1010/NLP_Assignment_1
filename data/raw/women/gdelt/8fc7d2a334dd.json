After the immense cultural impact of its last edition, held in Côte d’Ivoire in early 2024, the significance of Africa’s premier football tournament shot up, thanks to a heightened level of hyperactivity on social media across the continent that accompanied the games. It united Africans together through lighthearted banter and unusual camaraderie.\nMorocco will be hosting this year’s competition, marking the North African country’s first time as AFCON hosts since 1988. Morocco has emerged as an African football powerhouse, not only for having stellar men’s and women’s teams across all levels, but also for its willingness to serve as organizers for multiple African football events. It hosted this year’s Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON), the second of three consecutive times it is scheduled to host the competition. It is also set to co-host the 2030 men’s FIFA World Cup.\nAdvertisement\nBetween December 21 and January 18, 2026, all eyes will be on Morocco, as many Africans root for their favorite national teams.
