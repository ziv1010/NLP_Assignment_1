But being Prime Minister is a 24/7 job which requires stamina.”\nIt came as Rishi Sunak was out campaigning for the Conservatives in north London, with his wife, Akshata Murty, and Bob Blackman, the MP for Harrow East.\nHe has also been active on his social media channels, including posting his first TikTok, to promote his new policy pledge of bringing back National Service for 18-year-olds.\nBoth Liz Kendall, the shadow work and pensions secretary, and Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, were dispatched for the media rounds this morning for Labour.\nA Labour source immediately hit back at the Conservatives’ claims, insisting that the party leader was working “around the clock”.\n“Keir and the Labour Party are working round the clock, taking our message of change to the country.\n“We were out speaking with voters across the country within half an hour of the election being called. Meanwhile the PM has been holed up with his aides at his house”.\nThe Tories yesterday said it was inaccurate to suggest that Mr Sunak was not out on the trail, pointing to his meeting with veterans on Saturday morning.\nFollow the latest updates below and join in the conversation in the comments\n06:00 PM BST\nThat’s all for today...\nThank you for joining our coverage of day four of the 2024 general election campaign trail.\nWe will be back early tomorrow to guide you through the latest.\n05:31 PM BST\nTories still need to fill over 150 seats amid MP exodus\nThe Conservative Party still have to find candidates to stand in around 150 constituencies, the party admitted, Daniel Martin writes.\nA source said the party had candidates in place in three-quarters of the seats in Great Britain. That would mean it had only filled 474 seats – leaving 158 to be found. The party does not usually field candidates in Northern Ireland.\nThe deadline for candidates to be nominated is June 7, meaning the party has less than a fortnight to fill all the vacancies.\nRead more from The Telegraph’s Deputy Political Editor here\n05:13 PM BST\nSunak posts first TikTok of election campaign to promote National Service plans\nRishi Sunak has used his first video on TikTok to promote his new plans for a National Service to young people.\nThe Prime Minister sought to reassure teenagers that he was “not sending everyone off to join the Army” and invited users of the social media platform to ask him questions about the policy.\nMr Sunak said: “Hi TikTok. Sorry to be breaking into your usual politics-free feed but I’m making a big announcement today and I’ve been told that a lot of you already have some views on it.\n“So, first thing: No, I’m not sending everyone off to join the Army.\n“What I am doing is proposing a bold new model of National Service for 18-year-olds. They will be able to choose to spend 12 months in a full-time military commission or one weekend per month volunteering in roles in your local community, like delivering prescriptions and food to elderly people or in search and rescue.”\n05:04 PM BST\nDavey: Conservatives’ National Service plan an example of ‘breathtaking hypocrisy’\nSir Ed Davey said the Tories’ National Service plan was a “distraction” and an example of “breathtaking hypocrisy”.\nHe also welcomed Labour’s proposal to lower the voting age to 16.\nSpeaking in Cambridgeshire, he said: “The Liberal Democrats have long supported votes from 16 and I’m glad other parties are now catching up with us. All I’d say is as political reforms go, it’s an important one but it’s quite small.\n“We need to transform our politics. As for this distraction of a policy by the Conservatives on National Service, the hypocrisy is just breathtaking.\n“What we need is full-time, professional, highly trained troops. We’ve got the best Army in the world and we should be backing it.”\n04:51 PM BST\nEd Davey says election feels like 1997 again\nSir Ed Davey has said the general election campaign feels like 1997, when Labour won a landslide.\nThe Lib Dem leader claimed his party is getting the best response from voters it has received “for a generation”, as he accused the Tories of taking the public “for granted”.\nHe made the comments as he unveiled the Lib Dems’ new battlebus, named Yellow Hammer 1, in Whittlesford, Cambridgeshire, on Sunday.\nAsked about the Lib Dems’ targets in the election, he told the PA news agency: “I’m not putting a ceiling on our ambitions. All I’m doing is talking to voters with my teams across the country, and the Liberal Democrats are getting a great response – a better response than we’ve had for a generation.\n“I was elected back in 1997 and this feels to me quite a bit like that.”\nHe added: “I feel people like Jeremy Hunt have let them down, taken them for granted, assumed they’ll always vote Conservative.”\n04:33 PM BST\nNicola Sturgeon police probe could detonate ‘political grenade’\nScotland’s prosecutors could detonate a “political grenade” that derails the SNP’s general election campaign, a nationalist MP has warned them after they confirmed Nicola Sturgeon remains under investigation, Simon Johnson reports.\nAngus MacNeil urged the Crown Office to provide “clarity” on whether they will “hold off” until after the election on bringing any further charges over the investigation into the SNP’s finances.\nThe Western Isles MP said any action over Operation Branchform before July 4 had “huge potential to change the narrative of this campaign”.\nRead more from The Telegraph’s Scottish Political Editor here\n04:14 PM BST\nThe majority of the public back the idea of a National Service, polling shows\nThe majority of the public back the idea of a National Service, polling has shown.\nRishi Sunak last night vowed to create a mandatory scheme where school leavers will either have to enrol on a 12-month military placement or spend one weekend each month volunteering in their community.\nResearch conducted for Onward, a think tank, last year found that 57 per cent of people supported the Government introducing a “new national service scheme” for young people.\nSupport stretched across all political affiliations, with voters of all parties backing the idea, but was strongest among Conservatives, with 71 per cent supporting it.\nNearly three times as many young people supported the scheme than opposed it, the polling also found.\n03:54 PM BST\nLabour candidate for Ossett and Deby Dale poses

National Service could “damage morale, recruitment and retention” in the Armed Forces just days before Rishi Sunak announced it was party policy.\nAndrew Murrison rejected suggestions that the Government could reintroduce National Service in Britain on Thursday.\nResponding to a written question in Parliament, Mr Murrison said: “If potentially unwilling National Service Recruits were to be obliged to serve alongside the professional men and women of our Armed Forces, it could damage morale, recruitment and retention and would consume professional military and naval resources.\n“If, on the other hand, National Service recruits were kept in separate units, it would be difficult to find a proper and meaningful role for them, potentially harming motivation and discipline.”\nHe added: “For all these reasons, there are no current plans for the restoration of any form of National Service”.\nMr Sunak announced last night that more than 30,000 school leavers would be assigned military service as part of the new plans.\n03:25 PM BST\nPictured: The Liberal Democrats’ ‘battle bus’ starts its tour in South East\n02:59 PM BST\nLib Dems target Tory seats by highlighting taxes on pensioners\nThe Liberal Democrats have their sights set on snatching a string of coastal seats from the Conservatives by highlighting stealth taxes on pensioners, Will Hazell reports.\nSir Ed Davey’s party is targeting older voters in seats where the number of pensioners being sucked into paying income tax is higher than the Tory majority.\nAt the Autumn Statement in 2022, the Government froze the level at which a person starts to pay income tax at £12,570 until 2027-28 – dragging more people into having to pay the tax every year.\nThe Lib Dems believe that the hike will allow them to benefit from a “pensioner revolt” in marginal ‘Blue Wall’ Conservative seats.\n02:44 PM BST\nJames Cleverly: ‘Stimulating a habit of volunteering’ with National Service\n🇬🇧 *We'll introduce a bold new model

Stadium because he is meeting voters in the South East, it is understood.\nThe Prime Minister, who supports Southampton, is unable to go to the game because he is campaigning, but will be keeping a close eye on the score from afar this afternoon, sources said.\n02:13 PM BST\nSunak’s National Service announcement like ‘Alan Partridge shouting Monkey Tennis’\nRishi Sunak’s announcement of a new National Service is like “Alan Partridge shouting Monkey Tennis”, a Liberal Democrat MP has said.\nHelen Morgan, the MP for North Shropshire, said that more needed to be done to improve the living standards of the Armed Forces, rather than investing in the new scheme.\nShe told BBC News Midlands: “I think it’s a pretty desperate campaign announcement to be honest with you, I was put in mind of Alan Patridge shouting ‘Monkey Tennis’.\n“The reality is the armed services are the smallest they’ve been since Napoleon… we need to retain the service personnel that we have by giving them decent homes standards to live in, we need to do more to increase the size of our armed forces.”\n01:36 PM BST\nThe year the state pension will start to collapse – whoever wins the election\nThe state pension could become unaffordable as soon as 2035 if Labour and the Tories pledge to protect the triple lock in their election manifestos, Mattie Brignal reports.\nThe cost of paying the benefit will outstrip National Insurance Contributions (NICs) as the ratio of workers to pensioners shrinks, according to analysis for Telegraph Money by the Adam Smith Institute.\nThe think tank warned that the ballooning cost to taxpayers meant the state pension was “very likely” to become fiscally unsustainable between 2035 and 2045. It means action will have to be taken to cut the size and scope of the benefit.\nRead more from The Telegraph’s Senior Money Reporter here\n01:15 PM BST\nPictured: Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty on the campaign trail\n12:48 PM BST\nTory Party manifesto 2024: Rishi Sunak’s expected policies for the general election\nIn his first major policy announcement of the election campaign, Rishi Sunak has vowed to bring back National Service for 18-year-olds to create a “renewed sense of pride in our country”.\nIt is the first step in the prime minster’s steep uphill battle to win voters back to the Tories before the general election on July 4.\nBut what other policies has the Prime Minister announced for his 2024 campaign?

Not only have Labour rowed back on this commitment, one of their flagship policies, they have dropped 2030 timeline for this pledge.”\nHe added: “The choice at this election is clear: a clear and bold plan to cut taxes whilst also delivering a plan to make the UK the largest defence power in Europe to protect our national security under Rishi Sunak.\n“Or going back to square one with the same old Labour Party, who will hit hardworking families with punitive tax rises and never put our national security first.”\nAsked about when Labour would reach 2.5 per cent, Ms Reeves told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: “We’re not going to put a timetable on that”.\n“We’ve committed to do in government a strategic defence review to make sure that we’re getting value for money for all of our spending, including on defence where some of the procurement costs of purchasing new equipment have, frankly, got out of control under this Government.”\n12:09 PM BST\nLabour grapples with plans for a British wealth fund – without the wealth\nPrecise details of Labour’s policy plans are hard to come by, but one thing is clear: “The National Wealth Fund will be a crucial tool in our armoury towards bringing about growth,” according to shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, Tim Wallace writes.\nReeves has vowed to set up a British sovereign wealth fund if Labour wins power, using it to “create good jobs and spread productivity in every part of the country”.\nThere is just one rather large problem: where will the money come from?\nRead more from The Telegraph’s Deputy Economics Editor here\n11:43 AM BST\nFarage confirms plans to stand as future candidate\nNigel Farage has confirmed that he plans to stand as an MP at a future election, as he insisted that he still has “one more big card to play”.\nThe honorary president of Reform UK said that he felt “extremely disappointed” when Rishi Sunak called the election last week, saying that he had “lost perhaps first mover advantage”.\nMr Farage told GB News: “I’ve always reasoned aged 60 that I’ve got one more big card to play, personally, in terms of putting myself forward as a candidate – the question is when to play it.\n“I had decided I’d do it this year, and I thought I’d have six months of it – I didn’t, I had six weeks.\n“Will I at some point in the future come back to try and reshape, to actually create a centre-right right of British politics, because there isn’t one?\n“At some point in the future, the answer to your question is yes.”\n11:20 AM BST\nI look forward to my own daughters doing National Service, says Sunak\nRishi Sunak has said that he is keen for his own two daughters to take part in National Service, as he believes they would find it a “rewarding experience”.\nThe Prime Minister unveiled plans last night for a mandatory scheme where schools leavers will either have to enrol on a 12-month military placement or spend one weekend each month volunteering in their community.\nMr Sunak said that he wanted his own two daughters to take part as it will “teach them… much about themselves as the society they share”.\nHe wrote in the Mail on Sunday: “I know not everyone will agree with this plan. But bold action is the right thing for today’s Britain. As a father, I look forward to my own two daughters doing their National Service: I think they will find it a rewarding experience.\n“It will teach them, as it will other youngsters, much about themselves and the society they serve.\n“To those who complain that making it mandatory is unreasonable, I say: citizenship brings with it obligations as well as rights.

it’s a joke, isn’t it\n“You get a focus group of half a dozen Reform voters in a room, the chairman says ‘Now, what about national service?’\n“When you’re a weak leader - and Sunak is not a leader in any way at all - you’re a follower, so you follow what the focus groups say, and you say ‘by doing this I can attack the Reform vote’. That’s what it’s all about.\n“Look, it’s totally impractical - the Army has shrunk from 100,000 to 75,000 in 14 years of conservatism and, most interestingly, we have a growing number of young people in this country who do not subscribe to British values, in fact loathe much of what we stand for.”\nAsked by Sir Trevor if he was referring to Muslims, Mr Farage said: “We are.”\n09:42 AM BST\nJames Cleverly confirms he will stand for re-election\nJames Cleverly confirmed he will run for re-election, and said he intends to continue as Home Secretary too, Amy Gibbons reports.\nAsked if he would be standing again, he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg: “Oh God, yeah, absolutely. I love being an MP for Braintree, I love being the Home Secretary, and I intend to be both after the next election.”\nIt comes after a series of senior Tories, including Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, have announced that they will be standing down on July 4.\n09:34 AM BST\nNational Service plan ‘does not deal with the big challenges facing young people’ says Labour\nPlans to bring back a National Service “doesn’t really deal with the big challenges facing young people”, a Labour frontbencher has said.\nLiz Kendall, the shadow work and pensions secretary, claimed that the Tory plan was “more of the same from the Conservatives”.\nShe told Sky News: “It doesn’t really deal with the big challenges facing young people who are desperate, they are desperate to get the skills and qualifications they need to get good jobs, to have a home they can call their own, and Labour has a fully-costed, fully-funded plan to give young people those real opportunities that they need to build a better life, and that’s the choice at the next election.”\nShe added: “This election should be about the country’s future, not fighting for a better past and I think this announcement epitomises the choice at the next election, more of the same from the Conservatives.”\n09:26 AM BST\nCleverly: ‘We force people to do things all the time’\nJames Cleverly said “we force people to do things all the time”, when asked whether he was comfortable compelling teenagers to take part in national service.\nChallenged on whether community service can really be “volunteering” if it is mandatory, the Home Secretary pointed out that young people are already required to stay in education, claiming: “No one argues with that.”\nAsked if he was comfortable as a Conservative forcing teenagers to do something, he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg: “We force people to do things all the time.\n“We force 16-year-olds who, as a society, for example, we recognise are not fully formed, and they still require education. So the decision was made that they remain in education or training. So we force teenagers to be educated. No one argues with that. I think we all agree that it’s an investment in them.\n“This is about maintaining that investment in young people, in the future of our society, in bringing people together, in pushing people sometimes out of their comfort zone, and perhaps pump priming a lifelong habit of volunteering, which is good for the individual, and good for society.”\n09:25 AM BST\nLabour will implement the smoking ban if it wins the general election\nLabour will implement Rishi Sunak’s smoking ban if the party wins the next general election, a shadow cabinet minister has said.\nThe Prime Minister’s smoking and vaping Bill – which would have phased out smoking for anyone born after 2009 - has been axed after Parliament ran out of time to pass it before its dissolution ahead of the general election.\nBut the legislation had widespread support from the Labour Party, and was backed by Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary.\nLiz Kendall, the shadow work and pensions secretary, confirmed that Labour would ensure the Bill was passed.\nShe told Sky News: “ I mean Wes Streeting has been campaigning for that and if we’re elected, we will make that happen and make it less likely that young people will smoke than than vote Tory.”\n09:10 AM BST\nYoung people to be paid for military service but not volunteering element of National Service\nYoungsters will be paid to serve in the military under the Tories’ national service plan, but not to volunteer in the community, James Cleverly has said, Amy Gibbons reports.\nAsked about what compensation people will receive under the mandatory scheme, the Home Secretary said the 12-month military placements will come with a salary because they are “longer”.\nHe told Sky News’s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips: “The military option will come with a salary because it is longer, and therefore, by extension... the other elements of it won’t be.”\nHe added: “I was in the reserve forces, as you know, the military reserve forces are paid, for example, special constabulary are not, St John’s Ambulance people are not.\n“So that mix is actually quite in keeping with the structures that we already have.”\nHe insisted that the “mixed ticket” is “well established”, adding: “What we want, of course, is we want to make sure that everybody is involved, because this is about building a network across society.”\n09:09 AM BST\nTories would have been criticised regardless of how Sunak responded to the rain, says Cleverly\nThe Conservatives would have been criticised regardless of how Rishi Sunak responded to the rain during the general election announcement, James Cleverly said.\nThe party and the Prime Minister have come under fire after Mr Sunak was left sodden by a downpour as he gave his speech outside No10 without an umbrella.\nThe Home Secretary told Sky News’s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme: “Whatever way that we had responded to the rain, whether we’d moved the announcement, whether we had someone with an umbrella, you guys would have criticised us.”\nHe added: “When people are going to the ballot box are they going to ask ‘was it raining when he made the announcement?’\n“Or are they going to ask ‘who was the person that was instrumental in the furlough programme that kept a roof over my head during Covid?

And they pride themselves on it,” said Lord Darroch, who was British ambassador to the EU and the US during a diplomatic career that spanned 40 years.\n“The EU has moved on from Brexit.

That’s part of it, but the bulk of this is about helping build a cohesive society where people mix outside of their bubble, whether it’s through military service, other uniformed service or non-uniformed.”\n08:47 AM BST\n‘Nobody is going to jail’ if they refuse to take part in National Service, says Cleverly\nJames Cleverly has insisted “no one is going to jail” if they refuse to carry out national service, but the Tories would “compel” people to take part, Amy Gibbons reports.\nAsked what would happen if someone said they didn’t want to engage, the Home Secretary told Trevor Phillips on Sky News: “There’s going to be no criminal sanction for this. No one’s going to jail over this…\n“We want to make this compelling, we are going to compel people to do it, but also we want to make sure that it fits with different people’s aptitudes and aspirations.”\n08:43 AM BST\nLib Dems: National Service money would be ‘better spent’ on reversing troop cuts\nThe money set aside for a new National Service would be “far better spent reversing Conservative cuts to troop numbers”, the Liberal Democrats have said.\nRichard Foord, the party’s defence spokesman, said: “If the Conservatives were serious about defence, they would reverse their damaging cuts to our world class professional armed forces, instead of decimating them, with swingeing cuts to the number of our regular service personnel.\n“Our armed forces were once the envy of the world. This Conservative government has cut troop numbers and is planning more cuts to the size of the Army.\n“This would be far better spent reversing Conservative cuts to troop numbers.”\n08:32 AM BST\nWatch: Rishi Sunak explains plan for ‘bold new model’ of National Service\nBritain faces “a future that is more dangerous and divided”, Rishi Sunak has said, as he set out his plans for a new National Service.\nThe Prime Minister, who launched the plans as part of the Conservatives’ election campaign last night, said that one of the “problems” in society was that “we have generations of young people who don’t have the opportunities they deserve”.\nHe added: “Britain today faces a future that is more dangerous and more divided.
