  "body_text": "The 50 best Irish good-news stories from 2023: Sexton's ‘best dad’ moment, Cara Darmody’s maths results, and an Irish birthday at the Oscars\nFrom Biden's Irish baby shout-out to Dolly Parton’s Liveline appearance and Paul Mescal’s grá for Gaeilge, we’ve rounded up the most heartwarming and inspiring headlines of the last year\nHere are some of our favourite news stories from 2023:\n1. A new Late Late host\nAgainst the backdrop of the RTÉ payments scandal, Patrick Kielty took over as host of The Late Late Show on September 15. The veteran stand-up comedian had big shoes to fill, succeeding Gay Byrne, Pat Kenny and Ryan Tubridy. However, he immediately endeared himself to viewers with a funny and heartfelt opening monologue. Since then, Kielty has repeatedly risen to the occasion. Following the beginning of the Israel-Palestine war, he recalled his experiences growing up in a conflict zone and noted that the people of Ireland are “living our own miracle”. He then addressed those caught up in the conflict and expressed the hope that “your miracle comes soon”. Kielty also proved a hit on The Late Late Toy Show, with more than 1.7 million viewers tuning in.\n2. Sinead Farrelly’s call-up\nSinead Farrelly was called up to the Republic of Ireland women’s soccer squad for the first time in April. Any call-up is momentous but, for Farrelly, it carried extra poignancy. The American had not played competitively in eight years. Injuries sustained in a car accident in 2015 forced her into early retirement. In 2021, she made allegations of sexual coercion against a former coach, a disclosure that prompted a wider investigation into abuse in US women’s soccer. After making tentative steps back into soccer this year, Farrelly made her debut for the Republic of Ireland in April. She later played a key role in the World Cup, an experience that was life-changing. “Since I’ve come back, I’ve felt such a shift,” she told Fifa. “Even though I’ve been struggling physically, I’ve felt so much joy.”\n3. Ireland win Grand Slam\nIt was a St Patrick’s weekend to remember as Ireland won the Six Nations in decisive fashion. Having racked up wins against France, Scotland, Wales and Italy, Ireland faced England in the Aviva Stadium on March 18. After a rocky start, Ireland recorded a 26-19 win over the old enemy to clinch the Grand Slam and Triple Crown. To make it even sweeter, it was Ireland’s first time winning the Six Nations on home soil since 1948. It was also Johnny Sexton’s final ever Six Nations match. He went out on a high, becoming the leading points scorer in Six Nations history and breaking a record previously set by Ronan O’Gara.\n4. Paul Lynch wins Booker Prize\nIn November, Paul Lynch became the sixth Irish author to win the prestigious Booker Prize for his novel, Prophet Song. The book, which imagines an Ireland under totalitarian rule, was described by Esi Edugyan, chair of judges, as “a triumph of emotional storytelling, bracing and brave”. She added that readers would “not soon forget its warnings”. Lynch received a £50,000 prize for his efforts while sales of Prophet Song surged following his win. It was a standout year for Irish authors, with Paul Murray also making the shortlist for his novel, The Bee Sting. Sebastian Barry and Elaine Feeney were also long-listed for their novels, Old God’s Time and How To Build a Boat.\n5. Aisling Hanly’s All-Ireland win\nBack in March, Aisling Hanly captained her school, Convent of Mercy in Co Roscommon, to an All-Ireland in ladies’ football, scoring the winning goal. It was a feat made all the more impressive by the fact that Hanly, who was born profoundly deaf, wears two cochlear implants. Indeed, she wears a rugby scrum cap during match play to protect her implants. After speaking openly about her disability, Hanly was hailed as an inspiration both on and off the pitch. “I don’t let it bother me at all, and it shouldn’t bother anyone,” she said. “Sport is a great way to get out, make friends and become more confident in yourself.”\n6. Enniskerry's NFL hero\nEnniskerry isn’t the most likely starting point for an NFL hero. However, Daniel Whelan is fast becoming a rising star in American football. Born in Wicklow, he moved to California at the age of 13. After picking up American football, he played as a punter with UC Davis and spent a season in the XFL, an American football minor league, before being signed up by the iconic Green Bay Packers this summer. After making his league debut in September, he became the first Irish-born player to feature in an NFL game since 1985. So far, he has made a strong start. Come on you boys in Green Bay!\n7. The unstoppable rise of Rhasidat Adeleke\nAthlete Rhasidat Adeleke continued her remarkable run this year, becoming the first Irish sprinter to win an outdoor NCAA title. The Tallaght native claimed a 8. remarkable win in the 400m at this year’s NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, a year-end competition featuring elite collegiate athletes from across the United States. Adeleke ran 49.20, winning a gold medal for University of Texas and setting a new Irish record. In July, Adeleke announced she was going professional and signed a contract with Nike. The following month, she finished just outside the medals at the World Athletics Championships, securing an agonising fourth place finish. Next up? Paris 2024, where all eyes will be on the 21-year-old.\n8. When love conquered fear\nOn February 18, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Dublin to take part in the Ireland For All march. The march, which was organised by Le Chéile in response to a number of anti-immigrant protests, saw people march in solidarity with refugees and affirm Ireland’s commitment to welcoming migrants. Musician Christy Moore performed at the protest and told the crowd that “we are stronger when we are together” and added that he was there to express “revulsion” at “the hatred and violence expressed by a small number of people”. Activist Ailbhe Smyth echoed this sentiment and said, “We have come together to celebrate that fabulous rich variety and diversity that is Ireland today.” A reminder that love conquers fear.\n9. Maths hero Cara Darmody\nIn August, 12-year-old Cara Darmody became the youngest person in Ireland to pass Leaving Cert maths, scoring 97pc. The youngster undertook the exam to raise awareness for the plight of disabled children in Ireland and their families. Cara’s two younger brothers both have autism and she has campaigned extensively for improved services for children with special needs, even meeting with senior politicians to lobby for change and calling on the Government to fund private assessments for children on waiting lists. She also raised more than €55,000 to fund therapies for children with special needs in two local schools. What a hero.\n10. U2 go to Vegas, baby\nU2 travelled to Las Vegas to become the first group to perform in Sphere on September 29. Sphere is an immersive venue with state-of-the-art visual capabilities that has been hailed as revolutionary and groundbreaking. U2 were chosen to wet the proverbial head with their show U2:UV Achtung Baby Live at Sphere. It quickly became the hottest ticket in town with people flocking from all over the world to experience the cutting-edge venue first-hand. Reviews were overwhelmingly positive with The Guardian heaping praise on the “genuinely astonishing visual effects” and singling out U2’s performance. The Irish quartet’s residency continues until next spring.\n11. Dubliner Seán McGirr lands fashion’s top job\nDublin designer Seán McGirr landed one of the most illustrious gigs in fashion after he was named creative director of Alexander McQueen in October. McGirr succeeded Sarah Burton and is only the second creative director to helm the brand since its founder died in 2010. McGirr, who studied at Central St Martins, previously oversaw ready-to-wear at JW Anderson and has worked with other heavyweight brands like Dries Van Noten, Uniqlo and Burberry. Speaking about his appointment, the brand’s CEO, Gianfilippo Testa, hailed McGirr’s “experience, personality, and creative energy” and stated he would bring a “powerful creative language to Alexander McQueen while building on its unique heritage”.\n12. Youngest party leader steps up\nIn March, Holly Cairns became the leader of the Social Democrats after party founders Catherine Murphy and Róisín Shortall announced they were stepping down as co-leaders. In doing so, the Cork South-West TD became the youngest party leader in the country at the age of just 33. In her maiden speech as party leader, Cairns outlined her own extraordinary journey from grassroots activist to party leader and memorably described herself as “a member of the first generation who will be worse off than our parents”. The speech resonated and was viewed hundreds of thousands of times on social media, marking the arrival of a new voice in Irish politics.\n13. First Irish female tops the charts in 14 years\nOne of the breakout stars of 2023 was Jazzy. The Crumlin woman became the first Irish female artist to enjoy a number-one single in Ireland in 14 years when her smash hit Giving Me topped the charts in May. The song additionally went gold in the UK, peaking at number three and earning a shout-out from Calvin Harris, who described it as a “banger”. Did we mention it’s been streamed more than 100 million times on Spotify? It’s something of a fairytale rise for Jazzy who was working in a bakery in Tesco until last year and credits the free violin lessons she received in primary school with inspiring her to pursue music. Expect more bangers and bops from this star in the making.\n14. Katie Taylor defies the odds\nBack in May, Katie Taylor lost her first ever fight to Chantelle Cameron. Six months later, Taylor and Cameron returned to Dublin’s 3Arena for a highly anticipated rematch. The stakes could not have been higher for the 37-year-old boxer with a loss threatening to end her career and a win allowing her to reclaim her undisputed title. Taylor entered the November 25 fight as the underdog, with many observers favouring her opponent. Thanks to her signature steel and determination, however, she defied the odds and won the fight by majority decision, becoming a two-weight world champion. “Whoever wrote me off obviously don’t know me very well,” she said afterwards. “Don’t ever doubt me.” And who would?\n15. Barbenheimer rescues Irish cinema\nBarbenheimer was the cinematic event of the year and was credited with single-handedly bringing back event cinema. To recap, both Barbie and Oppenheimer were released on July 21 and resulted in Irish cinemas taking in more than €3.93m during opening weekend as cinemagoers ventured out in their droves to see the two blockbusters — some even attending both films back to back. Barbie went on to become the highest-grossing film of all time in Ireland, while the Cillian Murphy-led Oppenheimer surpassed An Cailín Ciúin to become the highest grossing film for the IFI. The result? Cinemas that have struggled since the pandemic enjoyed a mighty jolt while film fans were treated to two of the films of the year. Win-win.\n16. An Cailín Ciúin makes history\nIn what was viewed as a groundbreaking moment for Irish language cinema, An Cailín Ciúin made history by becoming the first ever Irish language film to be nominated for Best International Film at the Academy Awards back in January. It was nominated alongside Close (Belgium), EO (Poland), Argentina 1985 (Argentina) and the eventual winner, All Quiet on the Western Front (Germany). Director Colm Bairéad and producer Cleona Ní Chrualaoí described the nomination as “a truly historic and meaningful moment for Irish film, the Irish people and the Irish language”. Having grossed more than €1m at the Irish box office, An Cailín Ciúin has since earned nearly €5.9m worldwide, enjoying releases in Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Italy, Australia and many other territories.\n17. Buy Caio Benicio a pint\nFollowing the horrific knife attack in Parnell Square on November 23, Irish people united to honour the heroic actions of Caio Benicio. The Brazilian delivery rider was credited with acting quickly and tackling the assailant, preventing any further casualties. In response, a fundraiser titled ‘Buy Caio Benicio a Pint’ was set up on GoFundMe and raised nearly €370,000. Benicio later revealed that he was overwhelmed with the support but expressed gratitude. “Yes, I speak a different language. Yes, I have an accent. But I love [it] here so much that I would defend this country like a true Irishman would!”\n18. Sexton’s ‘best dad’ moment\nJohnny Sexton, one of Ireland’s greatest ever rugby players, hung up his boots after this year’s Rugby World Cup. While the tournament didn’t quite go to plan for Sexton or his teammates, there was a special on-field moment in October that tugged at the heartstrings of viewers at home. As Sexton walked around the pitch and processed the team’s heartbreaking quarter-final loss to New Zealand, his son, Luca, sought to comfort him and told him, “You’re still the best dad” before offering his old man a hug. The gorgeous interaction was captured by cameras and served to remind fans of what really matters.\n19. An Irish happy birthday at Oscars\nOne of the most joyous, life-affirming moments at this year’s Academy Awards on March 13 came when the team behind An Irish Goodbye won the Oscar for Best Live Action Short. During their acceptance speech, the film’s co-directors, Ross White and Tom Berkeley, decided to cede the spotlight and encouraged the entire Dolby Theatre to sing Happy Birthday to the film’s star, James Martin, who turned 31 that day. Martin, who has Down syndrome, was delighted as everyone from Colin Farrell to Janelle Monáe joined in the singalong. As for where he celebrated the rest of his birthday? At Elton John’s after-party, naturally.\n20. Daniel Wiffen breaks world record\nOn December 10, Daniel Wiffen became the first Irish swimmer to break a world record in the pool. The Co Down man set the short course record in the 800m freestyle at the European Championships, smashing the mark set by Australian swimmer Grant Hackett 15 years earlier. It was a magnificent milestone to end an extraordinary year, which saw Wiffen win international medals and break other records. He was honoured with a Swim Ireland Award for Performance Athlete of the Year (Swimming). Paris 2024 now beckons with Wiffen among Ireland’s most exciting medal prospects. Remember the name.\n21. Potus’s shout-out to baby Margot\nDuring his trip to Ireland in April, US president Joe Biden’s most adorable meeting came during his visit to Leinster House, when he came face to face with eight-week-old Margot Moynihan Roantree, the daughter of Senator Rebecca Moynihan. Moynihan attended Biden’s address with her baby in tow, with Margot earning a shout-out from Potus. “I apologise to you, little baby girl,” he said. “The idea you’re subjected to hearing the president of the United States deliver a policy speech is as bad as what all my children had been put through.” Biden made it up to Margot by posing for a photo with her afterwards. One for the mantlepiece.\n22. Eighty-three-year-old knitter gets the world’s attention\nDelia Barry, an 83-year-old from Greystones, Co Wicklow, became an unlikely sensation after her knitwear was featured in The Banshees of Inisherin. A lifelong knitter, Barry was asked by the film’s costume designer, Eimer Ní Mhaoldomhnaigh, to create jumpers for the film’s cast, including Colin Farrell. With no patterns to work off, she studied vintage photographs of fishermen to get inspiration for some of the film’s knitwear. Barry’s creations attracted international attention from the likes of The New York Times, Vanity Fair and the BBC. Speaking of finding fame at 83, she told The New York Times: “Because you get older, it doesn’t mean that you’re not useful anymore. There’s a lot we can do, if we want to.”\n23. Paul Mescal speaks Irish\nIs there anything Paul Mescal can’t do? This year saw the Maynooth actor earn his first Academy Award nomination, win an Olivier Award and land a role in the highly anticipated sequel to Gladiator. His greatest achievement, though? Dusting off the cúpla focal. At the Bafta Awards in February, he flew the flag for the Irish language when he did a red-carpet interview as Gaeilge with TG4. Mescal, who attended a Gaelscoil primary school, impressed viewers with his warm embrace of the Irish language. It was viewed 3.5 million times on X, formerly Twitter, and was even covered in The New York Times. As if we needed more reasons to be proud of him.\n24. John Creedon’s tribute to Sinéad O’Connor\nFollowing the tragic and untimely death of Sinéad O’Connor, John Creedon decided to pay tribute to her by devoting his entire RTÉ Radio One show on July 26 to the singer, playing hits from her back catalogue and sharing reminiscences. The show was likened to something of a musical wake, with fans from all over tuning in to pay their respects to one of our greatest musicians. Creedon was widely praised for striking the exact right tone as people grieved a great cultural loss. It was a reminder of the power and immediacy of radio as well as of the importance of public service broadcasting.\n25. Lankum nominated for Mercury Music Prize\nLankum, the Irish contemporary folk quartet, were nominated for the Mercury Music Prize this year for their album, False Lankum. Widely regarded as one of the most prestigious awards in British and Irish music, Lankum were among 12 acts to be included on this year’s shortlist. Fellow nominees included Arctic Monkeys, Fred Again and Jessie Ware. Previous Irish nominees include U2, Róisín Murphy, Fontaines DC, Lisa Hannigan and Jessie Buckley. At the ceremony on July 27, Lankum performed a stirring rendition of Go Dig My Grave. Ultimately, the group lost out on the prize to Ezra Collective, meaning Ireland’s wait for a Mercury Prize continues. However, False Lankum continues to make waves.\nRead more\n26. Weightlifter Thammy Nguyen wins medal\nThammy Nguyen became the first Irish athlete to win a medal at the European Weightlifting Championships when she secured a bronze medal in the 49kg in April. Nguyen, who was born in Vietnam and moved to Ireland as a small child, had previously competed in weightlifting. She stepped away from the sport and got married, had two children and started a number of businesses with her husband. When her brother, Nhat Nguyen, represented Ireland in badminton at the Tokyo Olympics, she was inspired to get back into weightlifting. Now the 4’10 powerhouse is eyeing qualification for Paris 2024. And you wouldn’t bet against her.\n27. Ferguson on track to become £100m player\nFew people had a better 2023 than Evan Ferguson. The 19-year-old had a fantastic season with his club, Brighton & Hove Albion, and was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year in August alongside the likes of Bukayo Saka and Erling Haaland. He later signed a contract extension, keeping him at Brighton until 2029, and his performances have fuelled speculation that he could become a £100m player. Elsewhere, Ferguson netted his first ever goal for the Republic of Ireland. His greatest accomplishment, though? Passing his driving test. “I haven’t sweated as much in a match as I did during that driving test I don’t think,” he said. “Never again!”\n28. Rare orchids at Trinity\nThis year, Trinity College participated in No Mow May, a biodiversity initiative that encourages people to refrain from cutting the grass for a month to help native wildlife. The front lawn was transformed into a gorgeous wildflower meadow for the month, with flowers blooming and pollinating insects reaping the rewards. Over the course of the month, chair of botany Jenny McElwain spotted a rare orchid known as a broad-leaved helleborine growing under a tree, prompting Trinity College to extend its no-mow policy through June. More than 30 species of flower popped up through the soil during the two-month experiment, including a second orchid. As professor Jane Stout explained, it’s proof that “nature can persist and recover” if given adequate space and time.\n29. Fan Fionn McGivern\nOne of the most unforgettable photos of the summer was that of two-year-old Fionn McGivern. The picture, snapped by James Crombie for INPHO, shows Fionn standing alone in the stairway of the stands in Croke Park with his hands behind his back, utterly engrossed in the All-Ireland hurling semi-final between Kilkenny and Clare. “All week, he’s been shouting, ‘Come on the Cats,’” his father told the Belfast Telegraph. The photo was viewed more than 3.5 million times on social media platform X.\n30. Deaf barrister Sofiya Kalinova\nSofiya Kalinova broke new ground by becoming the first deaf person to qualify as a barrister in Ireland. A graduate of UCD and the King’s Inns, Kalinova was called to the Bar in October by Chief Justice Donal O’Donnell. She is the first barrister to practise law in Irish Sign Language (ISL). Originally from Bulgaria, Kalinova completed her studies and exams in spoken English and ISL, neither of which are her first languages. Writing on LinkedIn, Kalinova said that her achievement not only represented a “personal triumph” but “advances inclusivity and diversity in the legal profession”. She added, “Let’s keep breaking down barriers and making strides together.”\n31. Recognition for Irish beef and Achill salt\nIn November, two Irish food products received special recognition and protection by the EU. Irish grass-fed beef was awarded Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status, while Achill Island Sea Salt received Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status. They’re in good company as these prestigious designations have previously been bestowed on the likes of French champagne, Greek feta cheese, English Stilton cheese and Italian parma ham. Ireland has a number of registered PDO/PGI food product names, including Clare Island salmon, Imokilly Regato and Timoleague brown pudding. Anyone else feeling peckish?\n32. First dementia-inclusive shopping centre\nWith more than 64,000 people living with dementia in Ireland, it’s becoming more and more important to create spaces that are dementia-friendly. In November, Mahon Point Shopping Centre in Co Cork became Ireland’s first dementia-inclusive shopping centre. The shopping centre partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on the initiative, which saw retail staff undergo dementia-inclusive training to help make the shopping centre a warm and welcoming environment for shoppers with dementia and their families. Bravo.\n33. Dolly Parton chats to Liveline\nWho had ‘Dolly Parton appears on Liveline’ on their bingo card this year? In October, the Queen of Country made a surprise appearance on the RTÉ Radio 1 show, chatting to Katie Hannon about everything from her career to child literacy. She recounted her trip to Co Kerry in 1990, during which she ended up performing in Páidi Ó Sé’s pub in Ventry. Ó Sé gifted Parton his jersey, which she revealed is framed and has pride of place in her basement. She additionally thanked a group of women in Co Kerry who dressed up as her for a Guinness World Record attempt. “I’m proud of all of you — you made me proud.” Come back any time, Dolly.\n34. Charlie Bird meets Bruce Springsteen\nIn May, Charlie Bird got to fulfil a dream when he met with Bruce Springsteen backstage at his RDS show. The veteran journalist, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2021, spoke with Springsteen using a digital speech app and got to exchange a few hugs with his musical hero. Springsteen’s kindness didn’t end there either. On stage, he dedicated the song Land of Hope and Dreams to Bird, prompting a standing ovation from the Dublin crowd. Bird later described the meeting as “a magical moment”. “Oh God, Bruce is a great human,” he wrote on X. “My final wish has happened.”\n35. Irish woman returns artefacts\nIn recent years, there has been a movement around repatriating historical artefacts. This year, a Limerick woman was inspired by an article she read online to return her late father’s collection of Aboriginal and African objects to their countries of origin, as per his wishes. The collection includes beautifully crafted wooden clubs, shields, harpoons and more. Walsh got in touch with Dr Christos Tsirogiannis, a lecturer in archaeology at the University of Cambridge, who offered guidance, and she is now in the process of returning the objects to South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan and Australia. An official from the South African embassy expressed gratitude, telling Walsh that it was “a lovely gesture”.\n36. Ciara Mageean on track for success\nCiara Mageean enjoyed a banner year on the track. In May, she reclaimed the Irish 800m record with a time of 1:59.27. Less than two months later, she set a new national record over the one-mile distance, breaking a mark previously set by none other than Sonia O’Sullivan. In August, she broke her own 1,500m record when she came fourth at the World Athletics Championships in a race widely considered to be the greatest 1,500m women’s race of all time. Weeks later, she smashed that same record yet again during a Diamond League event with a time of 3:55.87. The Portaferry woman now holds national records over four distances, confirming her status as one of Ireland’s greatest athletes. Bring on 2024.\n37. League of Ireland\nThis year saw Irish fans attend domestic soccer games in their droves, with the League of Ireland experiencing a rise in attendance figures. A huge 135,000 more people attended games across the Premier Division, First Division and Women’s Division this season compared to 2022, an increase of 20pc. The season culminated with 43,881 fans attending the FAI Cup Final, breaking a record that had stood for 78 years.\n38. Common crane\nSome 300 years after they became extinct in Ireland, the common crane has made a return to these shores. Bord na Móna announced this year that a pair of common cranes returned to one of Bord na Móna’s rewetted peatlands and successfully fledged a new chick. This marks the second year in a row that a chick has been fledged in Ireland, a sign that the crane population could be on the rise. Ireland has a longstanding affinity with the crane. The Gaelic name ‘corr’ forms the basis of numerous place names, while the bird plays a central role in much of our folklore. Now it looks as though the crane is ready to start its next chapter here in Ireland.\n39. SJP x SuperValu\nIn a turn of events that nobody could have anticipated, Sarah Jessica Parker revealed herself to be a SuperValu fangirl this summer. The actor, who owns a home in Co Donegal with husband Matthew Broderick, shared a series of photos on Instagram of her time in Ireland. Among them was a photo of SuperValu-branded cabbage as well as a photo of her wine on the shelves of her local store. Irish fans were tickled by the plug while SuperValu commented, “SuperValu and SJP, the crossover you never knew you needed.” She later jokingly described SuperValu as her “favourite place to be”. First Matt Damon, now SJP. Which Hollywood star will reveal themselves to be a SuperValu fan next?\n40. Hollywood goes green\nThis year was the year that Irish acting talent came, saw and conquered on the awards circuit. Irish talent landed 14 nominations at this year’s Academy Awards, with Colin Farrell, Paul Mescal, Brendan Gleeson, Barry Keoghan and Kerry Condon all securing Oscar nods, meaning one-quarter of all acting nominees were Irish. Not bad going. Elsewhere, Farrell won a Golden Globe for The Banshees of Inisherin, while co-stars Keoghan and Condon both won Baftas. Meanwhile, Tipperary native Daryl McCormack was nominated for not one but two Baftas for his work in the two-hander Good Luck To You, Leo Grande. Unreal. With Cillian Murphy, Andrew Scott and Keoghan all tipped for awards success next year, it looks as though the Irish are here to stay.\n41. Bulldog reunited with family\nThere were happy tears back in January when the Nawrocki family were reunited with their beloved dog. Baya, a French Bulldog, went missing from her home in Athenry, Co Galway, before Christmas in 2020. Two years later, she was found on a busy road in Dublin and taken in by the DSPCA. After checking Baya’s microchip, they discovered she was flagged as missing or stolen and tracked down the Nawrocki family to reunite them with their four-legged friend. The emotional reunion was captured for social media and used to remind the public of the importance of microchipping your pet. The Nawrockis were overjoyed, while Baya settled back in well and bonded with the family’s other dog, Diabolina.\n42. Afghan Sara Wahedi’s trip to Tipp\nIn October, Sara Wahedi, an award-winning entrepreneur, was on a train in Ireland when she was struck by her bottle of Tipperary Still Water. As a child, Wahedi moved to Canada from Afghanistan with her mother and brother. There, she was looked after by a Norwegian-Canadian woman named Marit and her Irish husband, Merrill. He used to sing It’s a Long Way To Tipperary and encourage the children to join in. “Within a few months, you could mistake us for an Irish choir,” she wrote. Wahedi recounted the full-circle moment on X, noting that the water bottle brought back memories of Merrill and his kindness. It was viewed 7.8 million times, and Wahedi was even featured on Tipp FM. The universe works in wondrous ways.\n43. Sinéad O’Connor’s acts of kindness\nFollowing Sinéad O’Connor’s passing, many spoke of the late singer’s good deeds. Philip Woolcock wrote a letter to The Telegraph on July 29, recalling the time the singer reached out to his 20-year-old daughter Louise, who was suffering from terminal cancer. Sinéad invited Louise to spend a week with her in London, where they dined, drank and danced. “Louise returned home exhausted and happier than I had seen her since her devastating cancer diagnosis,” wrote Woolcock. He added that Sinéad, who never sought publicity for this act of kindness, stayed in touch with Louise until she passed away in 1992. “Today my thoughts are with two remarkable women who, I have no doubt, will be somewhere still laughing, dancing and singing.”\n44. JW Anderson wears Irish rugby jersey\nDesigner JW Anderson sported an unusual look to close out his Milan Fashion Week show in June. The Northern Irish designer strutted down the runway in an Ireland rugby jersey. An unusual sartorial choice for one of the world’s most revered designers, perhaps, but there was a very sweet reason for it. He was paying tribute to his father, Willie Anderson, a former rugby international who earned 27 caps for Ireland. It’s not the first time father and son have honoured one another. Earlier in the year, Anderson designed a custom jumpsuit for Rihanna to wear during her Super Bowl halftime show. His dad later tweeted, “We are so proud of Jonathan for designing Rihanna’s outfit for the Super Bowl halftime show. Unbelievable.”\n45. Ireland's final frontier\nWe have lift-off! After six years of hard work and painstaking research, Ireland launched its first ever satellite into space on December 1. Educational Irish Research Satellite, also known as Eirsat-1, blasted off into space from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. Measuring just 10.7cm x 10.7cm x 22.7cm, it was designed, built and tested by dozens of UCD students alongside experts from the European Space Agency. Within three days, the satellite had circled the Earth 34 times. The launch was hailed as a giant leap for Ireland and its nascent space sector, with UCD president Orla Feely calling it “a remarkable first for the scientific community in Ireland”.\n46. Charlie’s Bar Christmas ad\nForget John Lewis. The Christmas ad of the year was created by none other than Charlie’s Bar in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh. The pub unveiled a charming ad depicting an elderly man walking alone through town before stepping inside the doors of Charlie’s Bar and befriending a young couple. The message? “There are no strangers here, only friends you haven’t met yet.” The ad was filmed on a phone and cost just £700 but has attracted worldwide attention and garnered millions of views across social media. In the wake of the ad’s success, the pub launched a clothing range to tackle loneliness in older people, with all proceeds raised going to Age NI and the South West Age Partnership. A heartwarming Christmas tale if ever there was one.\n47. Mum of 12 secures medical school place\nEarlier this year, Rosemary Murphy made headlines when it was revealed that the mother of 12 was returning to college to start a medical degree and become a doctor. The Dublin woman left school after her Junior Cert but harboured a lifelong ambition to study medicine. For 11 years, she devoted her time and energy to getting into medicine, completing a UCD Access course. After sitting her HPAT exams, she was shortlisted and interviewed for a place in the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland. Eventually she was offered a spot and she commenced her studies in September. Some woman for one woman.\n48. Solar-powered lockers in parks\nAs part of efforts to encourage people to get active, a number of Local Sports Partnerships around the country have installed solar-powered BoxUp lockers in parks containing sports equipment that can be borrowed and used by the community, free of charge. Each locker contains things like tennis rackets, frisbees, basketballs and hurleys. Members of the community simply download the BoxUp app and select how long they wish to borrow each piece of equipment. The lockers have been installed in parks across Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. The goal is to remove barriers to physical activity by making equipment accessible. So simple yet so clever.\n49. We show Seanchoíche some love\nIf there’s one thing Irish people love, it’s telling stories. Little wonder then that Seanchoíche has been one of the year’s breakout cultural events. Founded by Ciaran Gaffney, the storytelling event sees ordinary people get up and tell extraordinary stories around a particular theme. Indeed, the name comes from the words ‘seanchaí’ and ‘oíche’. The event regularly takes place in Dublin but has also popped up at venues and larger events across Ireland, including the All Together Now festival. It has also enjoyed sellout international events in London, Amsterdam and Sydney. With tickets regularly flying out the door in less than a minute, it’s clear that Seanchoíche has tapped into our desire for human connection and developed into something special.\n50. Katie McCabe scores our first Women’s World Cup goal\nIn July, Katie McCabe made history by scoring the Republic of Ireland’s first goal at a Women’s World Cup when she scored a stunner directly from a corner kick against Canada. For her efforts, the Irish captain was nominated for Goal of the Tournament. While the Republic of Ireland may have bowed out in the group stages, it was a momentous achievement that symbolised how far the women’s national team have come. Elsewhere, McCabe became the first Irish Ballon d’Or nominee since Roy Keane. She was one of 30 women nominated, finishing in 22nd place. G’wan Katie.",
