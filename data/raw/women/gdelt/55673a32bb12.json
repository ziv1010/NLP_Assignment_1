Rugby League legend Billy Boston has also received the huge honour.\nSir David has been made a knight for his services to sport and to charity, having partnered with Unicef and campaigned with Malaria No More, a charity working to eradicate the disease.\nHe said: \"I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honour. To have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career, and literally a boyhood dream come true.\"\nThe 1999 treble winner with the Reds, who earned 115 England caps and skippered the Three Lions 59 times said: \"I'm so lucky to be able to do the work that I do, and I'm grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment.\n\"It will take a little while for the news to sink in, but I'm immensely proud, and it's such an emotional moment for me to share with my family.\"\nSir Stephen, who took over the then-ailing GMP in May 2021, has been recognised for services to policing. He has overseen a dramatic tunraround in the force's fortunes.\nGMP, which was in special measures when he took over, has now been nationally recognised as the most improved for its re-focus on community policing.\nThe Chief Constable, who is on the board of the College of Policing, said he was 'delighted and humbled in equal measure' to be honoured.\n\"It has been the privilege of my life to work amongst the extraordinary officers and staff of Greater Manchester Police and in several other forces across our country,\" he added.\n\"My honour is reflective of their sustained determination, decency and effectiveness in the service of the public.\"\nCardiff-born Sir Billy, now 90, blazed a trail for black sports stars during the 1950s and 1960s, making 488 appearances for Wigan and finishing his career with a British record 571 tries to his name.\nHe received his latest honour from King Charles at Buckingham Palace earlier this week, where he was surrounded by his family.\nHis wife, Joan, said: \"Billy's family are so proud of him and so excited that everything he's done for the sport and for our community is being recognised.\" Adding: \"I hope this inspires more young people to get involved in Rugby League and to cheer on their players.\"\nTom Bloxham, the chairman of the pioneering regeneration company Urban Splash, has been awarded a CBE.\nTom has been recognised for services for culture following his two-decade tenure as Founding Chair of Factory International and the Manchester International Festival (MIF).\nBefore standing down last year, he helped the festival gain both national and international acclaim. He then led the organisation into a new era with the opening of the Aviva Studios, the UK’s newest cultural landmark and the new permanent home of Factory International.\nHe has held numerous cultural roles, including serving as a trustee for both Arts Council England and the Tate. He has also been Chair of the Ancoats Urban Village Trust and the Centre for Cities think tank, as well as a trustee of the Manchester United Foundation and the Bloxham Charitable Trust.\nSpeaking of the honour, Tom said: \"I've been fortunate to enjoy a long and diverse career, one that has opened doors to extraordinary opportunities and allowed me to pursue my passion for arts and culture.\n\"Along the way, I've had the privilege of working with some of the most brilliantly talented figures in the cultural sector, and I’m truly delighted that those collective efforts have been recognised today.\"\nNicholas Massey, the CEO of Forever Manchester, the charity that has put £65m into local communities since it was established in 1989, has also been awarded a CBE.\nOldham Athletic owner Frank Rothwell received an OBE with the businessman, philanthropist and fundraiser for Alzheimer's Research UK recognised for his charitable services to dementia research.\nIt comes four years after the Latics owner became the oldest person to complete a solo row across the Atlantic Ocean at the age of 70 - and completed it again three years later, raising more than £1.4m.\nCoronation Street and Emerdale boss John Whiston was also awarded an OBE. The managing director of continuing drama and head of ITV in the North at ITV Studios, who lives in Sale, received the honour in recognition services to broadcasting and to television.\nHe said: \"It may take a village to raise a child but it takes hundreds of supremely talented people to make great television.\n\"So although I’m hugely flattered to be given this honour, I know it belongs just as much to everyone I have worked with over the years and, most recently, my colleagues on the Soaps.\n\"Coronation Street and Emmerdale are very special shows, made by very special people and this honour is an incredibly special symbol of that.\"\nThe former chairman of Bury FC, Dr Marcel De Matas, has been given an MBE. As has teenage darts sensation Luke Littler, from Warrington. He has been recognised for services to darts alongside his Crewe-based rival Luke Humphries.\nTameside council's interim chief executive, and the former interim CEO of Oldham council, Harry Catherall, has also been awarded the title, for his ‘outstanding contribution to public service.'\nMr Catherall has spent more than 45 years in public service, starting as a 16-year-old apprentice at Tameside Council and putting off his retirement for more than five years to support various crisis-ridden authorities across the region.\nHe said: \"It's a privilege to work alongside talented, dedicated and passionate people who are fully focused on changing their lives for the better and I am absolutely delighted to be honoured with an MBE. I thank Oldham for the nomination, and everyone for their very kind words.”\nA senior scout is one of a number of community workers and volunteers to be recognised, having been awarded an MBE. Greg Archer's father set up his local scout group back in 1975, the year before he was born, and he has been a part of the scouting community ever since.\nHe has been a volunteer for more than 30 years and is now the Deputy County Commissioner and Deputy Lead Volunteer for Greater Manchester West.\nMr Archer said he was 'blown away' and 'truly humbed and honoured' to be recognised for services to young people. \"Scouting has been such a big part of my life, and it's given me far more than I could ever give back,\" he said.\n\"This recognition really belongs to the amazing young people, volunteers, and fellow leaders I’ve had the privilege to work with over the years. I share this with all of them,\" he added.\nA Manchester-based social entrepreneur has also been awarded MBE for services to gender equality in women and young girls. Jane Kenyon founded Girls Out Loud in 2010 which has helped shape brighter futures for more than 30,000 teenage girls.\nThe social enterprise has partnered with more than 80 schools and trained over 2,000 professional women as mentors, with a further 3,000 volunteers supporting school-based initiatives. Jane, who lives in Knutsford, has personally raised over £2m to fund this work.\nShe said: “This work has been my life’s purpose – from mentoring girls one-to-one to building an organisation that champions them at scale. I’ve always believed in helping women and girls see the power they already have and reminding them that they aren’t alone.\"\nCheshire Fire and Rescue Service crew manager Stuart Plaskett has been awarded the prestigious British Empire Medal (BEM) in recognition of his exceptional fundraising efforts and unwavering dedication to the Fire Fighters Charity (FFC).\nHe has led the Service in raising an extraordinary £683,000 through a wide range of activities, including car washes, sporting events, clothes recycling bins on stations and activities at fire station open days.\nHe said: \"I'm overwhelmed by this news and feel extremely proud and humbled. The Charity has supported me and my family over the years, during various times of need, so I just wanted to give something back.\n\"But I couldn’t have raised all this money without the support of my colleagues who, when asked, went above and beyond, especially through the pandemic, to help keep our charity afloat.\"\nHere is the full list of everyone who lives, works or who grew up in Greater Manchester and bordering areas of Cheshire named in the King's Birthday Honours list for 2025.\nKnights Bachelor\nWilliam John Boston MBE.
