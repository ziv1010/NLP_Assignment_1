  "body_text": "Strictly Come Dancing 2025 is well and truly underway, with all celebrities and their pro partners battling it out to lift the Glitter Ball trophy.\nThe BBC reality competition series, hosted by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman, returned this autumn for another year of jaw-dropping routines and emotional journeys for our cohort of famed contestants.\nAfter weeks of build-up, the celebrities finally met their dance partners, with Strictly producers introducing two new faces as part of the professional lineup.\nViewers got to know 25-year-old American dancer Alexis Warr and 30-year-old Aussie dancer Julian Caillon, with the two coming over from Dancing with the Stars.\nThe long-running reality show has had to shake off a few scandals over the last 12-18 months, and this series certainly hasn’t been without drama either, thanks to injuries, sickness, and late entrants.\nGet personalised updates on Strictly\nWake up to find news on your TV shows in your inbox every morning with Metro’s TV Newsletter.\nSign up to our newsletter and then select your show in the link we’ll send you so we can get TV news tailored to you.\nSo, with Strictly Come Dancing in full swing for another year, let’s run through the couples hoping to waltz their way into your hearts—and who have already danced their last dance.\nLewis Cope & Katya Jones\nEmmerdale star Lewis Cope was announced as Kristian Nairn’s replacement after the Game of Thrones actor was forced to drop out of the competition.\nThe 30-year-old revealed before the competition that he was looking for a dance partner who would ‘push him,’ and joked he’s going to go out of his way to impress judge Shirley Ballas.\nWell, he’s definitely going to be getting what he wants, with Katya Jones being revealed as his partner for the next three months.\nKatya won the competition in 2017 with her partner Joe McFadden, and finished strongly with her partner Wynne Evans last year, eventually coming 8th.\nLewis said in a statement ahead of his debut: ‘I’m so excited to be swapping the Dales for the dance floor and joining this year’s Strictly Come Dancing. I’ve always been a fan of the show and cannot wait to get started!’\nLewis quickly emerged as an early favourite to take home the Glitter Ball, despite not being part of the original lineup.\nKaren Carney & Carlos Gu\nKaren Carney was the 14th celebrity to be announced for the new series of Strictly, and she’s been paired with Carlos, who was benched last series.\nThis was despite Carlos finishing as a runner-up in 2023, dancing with Molly Rainford, and then finishing sixth with Angela Scanlon in the 2024 series.\nKaren was revealed as a Strictly contestant on Vernon Kay’s BBC Radio 2 show, which was guest-hosted by Gary Davies on the day she was announced.\nThe new BBC dancing star is a former footballer who is now the lead female pundit for both men’s and women’s football, across TNT and ITV.\nOn joining Strictly, Karen said in a press release: ‘It really is a dream come true to be a part of this year’s Strictly Come Dancing lineup.\n‘I’m such a huge fan of the show, and I can’t believe I’m finally getting the chance to take part. I’m so excited to meet everyone and get dancing!’\nVicky Pattison & Kai Widdrington\nVicky Pattison was the 11th celebrity contestant announced to appear on Strictly 2025, dancing alongside returning pro Kai Widdrington.\nShe’s best known for appearing on Geordie Shore, but has made a name for herself since appearing on the show as a TV personality and presenter.\nHowever, Kai was warned from the off that he’d have a big task on his hands, as Vicky confessed to being a ‘drinker, not a dancer’, comparing her moves to those of a ‘drunk aunty’.\nOn joining Strictly, Vicky commented: ‘I’m absolutely buzzing to be part of this year’s Strictly Come Dancing lineup… but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t terrified.\n‘I am not a natural dancer! However, it’s such an amazing opportunity for me to step out of my comfort zone and to challenge myself in a completely new way, and I just really hope I don’t make too much of a fool of myself!’\nEllie Goldstein & Vita Coppola\nTrailblazing model Ellie Goldstein was the ninth contestant to be announced this year, dancing with Vito Coppola.\nEllie made history in 2023 as the first model with Down syndrome to grace the cover of British Vogue.\nShe said about joining the Strictly cast: ‘It’s a show I’ve loved watching for so long, and the chance to now be part of it feels like a dream.\n‘I know it’s going to be challenging, but I’m ready to do it with the glitter and glamour and make some magic on that dancefloor. Let the Strictly journey begin!’\nVito has a stunning record on Strictly, finishing as a runner-up twice and a winner once. In fact, he won the competition with another dancer named Ellie, so the omens are good.\nLa Voix & Aljaž Škorjanec\nSinger and 2024 RuPaul’s Drag Race UK finalist La Voix was the seventh contestant to slide onto the dance floor, and the drag superstar has been paired with Aljaž Škorjanec.\nOn joining Strictly, La Voix said: ‘I’ve performed for royalty, RuPaul and Simon Cowell, but nothing fills me with more excitement (and quite a bit of terror) than the thought of dancing in front of millions on live Saturday night TV.\n‘Strictly is a national institution and I can’t wait to get started. All that’s left to say is: good luck to my partner! Here’s hoping they can help me go from La Voix into La Danse.’\nLa Voix is in trusty hands with Slovenian dancer Aljaž, who won the series in 2013 and has made the top 10 every year that he’s been a professional partner.\nLast year, he made it all the way to the final with partner Tasha Ghouri.\nGeorge Clarke & Alexis Warr\nThe sixth contestant to twirl into the 2025 ballroom was George Clarke, dancing alongside a newcomer, American dancer Alexis Warr.\nGeorge is known as George Clarkey online, where he is a YouTuber and social media star known to millions for his comedy content. He also co-hosts The Useless Hotline podcast.\nOn joining Strictly, he said: ‘Never thought I’d say this, but I’m doing Strictly! Honestly, I’ve got no idea what I’m doing, but I’m excited to get stuck in and potentially fall over a fair bit.’\nHailing from Utah, Alexis joined Strictly from US series Dancing with the Stars, on which she was part of the large dance troupe.\nBalvinder Sopal & Julian Caillon\nBalvinder Sopal confirmed she was joining Strictly Come Dancing on Good Morning Britain, and second newcomer, Julian Caillon, was also revealed as her partner.\n‘I can’t stop butterflies. Every time I think about it, they just go,’ Balvinder said – the actress is best known for starring as Suki Panesar in EastEnders.\nShe added in a statement: ‘I’ve dabbled [with dance] a little bit. I did ballroom and Latin as a kind of hobby, and I really love it. And I think when you’ve got a passion for something, you’re naturally kind of inclined to enjoy it.\nDespite having a little bit of dancing in her past, she’s admitted: ‘I don’t know if I’ll be any good! It is about telling the story with your feet, with your body, and not speaking.’\nShe continued: ‘So, you know, I won’t have to learn any lines, which would be great, but it’ll be like learning a new language, I think.’\nAustralian dancer Julian also joins from Dancing With the Stars – however, he comes to Strictly from the Australian version of the long-running reality show.\nAlex Kingston & Johannes Radebe\nAlex Kingston tuned in from a holiday in Italy to confirm she had signed up for the Strictly Ballroom, and she’s now found out that she’ll be dancing with the lovely Johannes Radebe.\nThe 62-year-old actor, who played River Song on Doctor Who (aka The Doctor’s wife) opposite three Doctors on screen, had been rumoured as a member of the Strictly cast for weeks before\nAlex admitted that she had lurched from feeling ‘excited’ to feeling ‘terrified’, which means that having a calming presence like Johannes as a partner will be what she needs.\nWhile Johannes has never won Strictly, he’s finished in the top eight in all five of the last editions of the competition, reaching as high as second with John Waite.\nAlex said about joining the Strictly cast: ‘When I saw Sarah Hadland performing last year, I just thought, she’s done it, and not only has she done it, she went all the way.\n‘I reached out and asked her what her experience was, and she was really honest with me about how hard it is, how overwhelming it can be, but also how it absolutely changed her life.’\nAmber Davies & Nikita Kuzmin\nAfter Dani Dyer was forced to drop out of the contest after breaking her ankle, the BBC announced Love Island star Amber Davies would be replacing her.\nAmber is competing now with Dani’s professional dance partner, Nikita Kuzmin.\nIn a statement, Amber said: ‘This has been the craziest 24 hours of my life. I’ve watched Strictly with my family since I was younger, and to now be part of the show is a dream come true.\n‘I’m going to give it my all, and I am sending Dani well wishes for a speedy recovery. I hope I do her proud.’\nThe late addition couple quickly became favourites among viewers, earning high scores from the judges too from the offf, despite having just a day to rehearse their first routine.\nAlso, if you’re sad about Dani having to drop out, there have been hints that her Strictly days aren’t totally behind her.\nHarry Aikines-Aryeetey & Karen Hauer\nOlympian and star of BBC’s Gladiators, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, was the first famous face confirmed to be gracing the Strictly ballroom this autumn.\nThe TV personality already took part in last year’s Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special with pro-partner Nancy Xu, and now he is back for round two.\nThis time, he’s been partnered with Karen Hauer, with Nancy on the bench after finishing ninth with Shayne Ward last year.\nSpeaking about joining Strictly, Harry said: ‘After the Christmas Special, it was so nice I just had to do it twice! I’m so excited to be part of the Strictly family this series, and I’m ready to give it all I’ve got.\n‘I’ll be bringing tons of energy to light up the dance floor. Let’s hope I’m as quick at picking up the routines as I am on the track,’ he said in a statement.\nThe multi-gold-medal-winning Team GB sprinter was announced as Nitro in the high-stakes BBC gameshow in 2023, hosted by Bradley and Barney Walsh.\nWho has left Strictly so far?\nThomas Skinner & Amy Dowden\nThomas Skinner was the 10th celebrity contestant confirmed to be part of the show, but the first to be eliminated, alongside his partner Amy Dowden.\nThe TV personality, social media star and businessman is best known for his appearances on The Apprentice, and was considered quite a controversial pick for the show.\nAfter spending time with American right-wing politician JD Vance, his casting was criticised by others in the media, and things got worse when he had to apologise after allegedly snatching a journalist’s phone during a Strictly press conference.\nMeanwhile, Amy returned back on the dancefloor after being forced to retire midway through the competition in 2024.\nAfter being the first duo voted out of this year’s contest with their Salsa to Bonkers by Dizzee Rascal, Thomas apologised to Amy, saying of his experience: ‘I’ve loved it. I’ve never danced before, and my stay was short, but Amy’s amazing. It’s been great fun and I’ve enjoyed it.\n‘I can’t really dance that well, but I’ve had fun! Thank you, Amy. Sorry that we haven’t done too good, ‘cause you’re a different class.’\nRoss King & Jowita Przystal\nLorraine’s very own US showbiz reporter Ross King and his pro partner Jowita Przystal were the second-eliminated couple during Movie Week.\nRoss previously poked fun at his lack of experience and joked about being the favourite to be the first one out.\nAlas, their time together was short-lived, having failed to secure the judges’ backing in the dance-off with their Thunderbirds-inspired Paso Doble.\nWhen asked by Tess about their time on the show, Ross said tearfully: ‘I have loved every single minute of it. I would like to say thank you to everyone who has supported us, all the people who voted – they’ve been amazing. I want to thank everyone here in this room, backstage, the judges, the crew – every single person here has made me so, so welcome.’\nJowita, who hailed Ross as her ‘King’, also vowed to be ‘a be a little part of [his] life forever.’\nChris Robshaw & Nadiya Bychkova\nFormer England rugby captain Chris Robshaw was the eighth celeb to join the Strictly Come Dancing 2025 roster.\nThe sporting icon became captain at 23 years old, earning 66 caps for England and captaining the national team 43 times. In 2016, he led the team to a Six Nations Grand Slam victory.\nBut sadly, despite pushing himself so far out of his ‘comfort zone’ throughout his time on Strictly with pro Nadiya Bychkova, he had an early exit.\nSpeaking the evening after his elimination, he told It Takes Two host Fleur East: ‘Of course we’re gutted to be out of the competition, but we’re incredibly proud of what we’ve done and achieved.\n‘I don’t say this lightly but over the last 24 hours, it’s been extremely emotional.\n‘The amount of messages we’ve had from friends, family, people on social media. ‘It’s been really overwhelming. I actually relate it to retiring from rugby.’\nStrictly viewers were equally gutted for Nadiya, who hasn’t had much lucj in recent series, having only made it to Blackpool twice in the six years she’s been a professional dancer.\nIn 2024, she was dumped out in 15th place, as Tom Dean was the first star eliminated.\nStefan Dennis & Dianne Buswell\nStefan Dennis, who’s best known for playing Paul Robinson on the popular soap Neighbours, was paired with fellow Aussie and last year’s winner Dianne Buswell this series.\nDianne and her partner Chris McCausland lifted the trophy in December 2024 after a remarkable campaign that saw her go one better than her runner-up finish with Bobby Brazier.\nAlas, actor Stefan, 66, wasn’t able to replicate her success, as their journey together came to an unexpected end after just a few weeks.\nThe TV icon was forced to withdraw from Strictly due to an injury, just one week after making a comeback when he was given a by due to illness.\nA statement released by him at the time read: ‘I can’t tell you how devastated I am to have to leave so prematurely.\n‘There has been, and still is, so much love and support from everyone for both Dianne and myself. I owe both the Strictly family and Dianne a massive debt of gratitude for giving me the opportunity to fulfil my dream of being able to dance with my wife. (When my leg is better).’\nEver the joker, he added a note that made Neighbours fans smile: ‘Fun fact for all the avid Neighbours fans… it’s the same leg! 😂’\nDianne, of course, made Strictly history this time as the first dancer in the history of the competition to take to the floor while pregnant, as she expects a baby boy with boyfriend Joe Sugg.\nJimmy Floyd Hasselbaink & Lauren Oakley\nJimmy Floyd Hasselbaink was the first big shock elimination of the series following a surprise dance-off against Amber and Nikita during Icons Week, in which Jimmy paid tribute to Prince.\nHe and his pro partner, Lauren Oakley, danced their Purple Rain American Smooth for a second time but, unfortunately, the judges unanimously voted to save theatre star Amber.\nSpeaking after the decision was made, Jimmy said he had ‘absolutely loved’ his time on the dancefloor, adding: ‘I can only say thank you very much for letting me have this experience and to my daughters for pushing me to come here and do this.’\nHe also thanked his partner: ‘Most importantly, [to Lauren] this girl, she is just absolutely incredible.\n‘She has been absolutely amazing with me. [To Lauren] You are a diamond.’\nMore Trending\nJimmy is famously an ex-football pro. He played for clubs including Leeds United, Atlético Madrid, and Chelsea, carving out a prolific goal-scoring career in the Premier League and across Europe.\nSince retiring, Jimmy has been both a football pundit and a football manager, and was last in charge of Burton Albion as of 2022.\nA version of this article was originally published on August 11.\nDeals of the Day\n-\nThe Traitors is over – but Claudia Winkleman’s shoes are everywhere\n-\nCraving sun, city streets or theme parks holdays?
