  "body_text": "- Read on for the latest news and gossip from around the grounds in Canberra sport. This week we've got fans lining up for a Canberra Stadium experience, venue makeovers and plans for the Big Bash.\nThe Canberra Raiders have launched talks with Canberra Stadium officials in a bid to increase the venue's hospitality capabilities and improve the game-day vibe next season.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nAs debate rages about the cost, timeline and location of a new stadium in the capital, the reality is the grand old girl at Bruce is the only solution for the Raiders and ACT Brumbies for the next decade (hopefully not any longer than that but ... let's not go there today).\nSo while we're all dreaming of the future, the Raiders are making sure they don't lose sight of the short-term while the stadium saga drags into its 16th year. They have lodged a request for an expansion of some corporate facilities to cater for demand.\nLocker Room can reveal the Raiders have a waiting list of supporters who are willing to pay for a suite or an open-air box for NRL games. The solution? No one is entirely sure yet. But some options that have been floated include building temporary structures at the northern and southern ends for either enclosed boxes or viewing decks where people can gather.\nThere are constraints involved in that, though, given Canberra Stadium's age. The main catering facilities are located underneath the Meninga and Gregan-Larkham stands, making it hard to stock newer venues at the ends of the ground. One idea is for an entertainment deck similar to the one at Magic Round in Brisbane to \"create some more fun\".\nThe need for extra corporate facilities isn't the reason to build a new stadium, but it can certainly be added to the growing list.\nThere are 57 boxes at Canberra Stadium. Over the space of 11 home games for the Raiders men's team, fewer than 10 of the 627 available options were unsold this year.\nThe stadium issue aside (and we know it's a big one), it's a sign of how well the Raiders are going with their supporters despite effectively going through a rebuilding period.\nThe club will go to the sponsor market soon for the limited available spots on their 2025 playing strip.\nBIG BASH EXPANSION\nCricket Australia insiders say Canberra's corporate backing and the prospect of major government investment makes a compelling case for a Big Bash licence - but no clear plan for expansion leaves them in murky waters.\nCA officials will steer clear of making public comment on Canberra's Big Bash hopes, fuelled by Cricket ACT chairman Greg Boorer and a $3 million funding commitment from Chief Minister Andrew Barr as part of Labor's ACT election campaign.\nBecause with no concrete plan to expand the competition, CA publicly outlining parameters for a licence could lead to bid teams springing up in Geelong, the Gold Coast and even New Zealand saying they are a perfect fit for a licence of their own.\n\"The growth of the Big Bash Leagues is one of the great success stories of Australian sport and is testament to the great cricket and experiences that bring people together over the summer months,\" a Cricket Australia spokesperson said.\n\"We are grateful for the interest and support of governments, broadcasters and commercial partners who are integral to this growth. We continually review the optimal shape and structure of the league to ensure that it remains the strongest possible asset for all of Australian cricket and would assess any proposals for new clubs on their merits.\"\nThe idea of adding another team into the mix has its detractors. Some have suggested the Sydney Thunder should relocate to Canberra. But if a team was to move, would the Melbourne Renegades make more sense?\nThere is a clear divide between the areas represented by the BBL's two Sydney franchises, but in Melbourne, it seems to be less about territory and more about whether you prefer to wear red or green.\nMcKELLAR PARK MAKEOVER\nA McKellar Park makeover could include shaded seating on the eastern side, upgraded lights, a new lift to access the grandstand and renovated bathrooms to create a space for mums to breastfeed babies as part of a plan to transform Canberra's A-League Women's experience.\nCanberra Women's Football Inc is working with the Belconnen Soccer Club to apply for a grant for McKellar Park upgrades to improve the venue Canberra calls home during the A-League Women's season.\n\"We really believe in the concept of 'if you can see it, you can be it'. We're trying to create an environment where women of all ages would be comfortable and happy to come and watch our elite Canberra women's team play,\" CWF member Mikaela Danvers said.\n\"In terms of the upgrade we're trying to apply for grant money for, it's a broad spectrum of upgrades that will contribute to making McKellar that sort of safe, welcoming space for spectators, but also making it a professional environment for the team.\"\nThe shaded seating would provide relief for fans during the summer months, while lighting upgrades would allow for matches to be played at night throughout the A-League campaign.\nRenovated bathrooms would include a safe space for mums to breastfeed and look after babies, while fixing the lift would address a major issue, given an ongoing technical issue \"makes it really hard for anyone with a disability or access issues to be able to get up to the grandstand\".\nWHAT DOES TASSIE COST BLOWOUT MEAN FOR CANBERRA?\nTassie's stadium plan has blown out by $60m, what does that mean for Canberra?\nWell, Canberra's latest cost estimations are already well above the $715 million slated for the waterfront Hobart facility with a roof. Tasmanians are now expecting the project to cost at least $775m.\nThe ACT government expects a new stadium without a roof in Bruce to cost at least $1.3 billion.\nBut costs aside, there were some revealing details in the Tassie stadium's 267-page report delivered to the Tasmanian Planning Commission this week.\nThey expect the venue to host seven AFL matches, three AFLW matches, VFL, VFLW and local action during the football season. In summer they're budgeting for four BBL, four WBBL, a Test match and a women's limited-overs international. They've also lobbed in Socceroos, Matildas, NRL, women's rugby union World Cup games and Wallabies Tests.\nIt's a pretty ambitious wish list, especially given Tasmania has hosted just one Test cricket match since 2016 and competes with Manuka Oval for the rights to games.\nThe big lesson for Canberra out of this is that building it doesn't mean sports will be falling over themselves to come with several other venue options around the country.\nIf the ACT government is serious about building a new venue, they also need to be serious about creating an events fund that will give organisers the ability to attract the big events. Spoiler alert - that doesn't come cheap.\nA NEW NAME FOR HOME FIELD\nBally McBallpark? The Robbie Perkins Ballpark? The artist formerly known as Narrabundah Ballpark?\nTHE GOLDEN GIRL IN TOWN\nStill basking in the glow of the Paris Olympic Games, Emma McKeon was the most in-demand person in Canberra this week when she came to town for a whirlwind tour of the city.\nAustralia's greatest Olympian was jumping from event to event as part of her role as the Young Australian of the Year.\nIf McKeon wasn't already exhausted from a career that yielded six Olympic gold medals and 16 overall, she must've been feeling the strain after signing hundreds and hundreds of autographs for fans.\nMcKeon hosted an event for Canberra Times subscribers on Thursday and also took part in a session at ANU, while also finding time to mingle with the next gen of swimming stars at the AIS.\nIt should come as no surprise that the 29-year-old - who ended her Olympic career in Paris - was completely unflappable through it all.\nRACING FOR A CHANCE\nPort Macquarie mare Bomarea is making the long trek down the highway to compete in the Black Mountain at Thoroughbred Park on Friday as trainer Marc Quinn chases a $100,000 bonus and a slot in the Kosciuszko.\nQuinn and Bomarea will make the eight-hour trek for a bumper day of racing with plenty on offer. The day will double as the traditional Joseph Jones race day, which normally attracts a big crowd.\nThere's a $100,000 bonus up for grabs in the Black Mountain (1000m) for any horse that can break the track record of 55.84 seconds.\nAnd while Parramatta might've struggled in the NRL this season, King Gutho returns from a six-week break to hit the track again. The ultimate goal for all is to squeeze into the field for the $2 million Kosciuszko at Randwick on October 19.\nHave your say\n- Have you heard something and want to get in touch?\n- caden.helmers@canberratimes.com.au",
