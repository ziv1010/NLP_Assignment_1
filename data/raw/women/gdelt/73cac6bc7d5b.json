Throughout the year we ask questions of the most plugged-in Syracuse Orange fans and fans across the country.\nSign up here to participate in the weekly emailed surveys.\nTNIAAM Reacts: Will you be going to the Syracuse football spring game?\nAnd can the women’s lax team stay at #1?\nHere’s this week’s survey questions for you to answer. We only have three this week because we know you are still recovering from four days of NCAA Tournament action.\nDo you believe that Syracuse women’s lacrosse can hold up through the regular season?\nWill Adrian Autry be at risk of losing other players to the transfer portal or will the exodus end with Symir Torrence and Jon Bol Ajak?\nSpring football practice has started so we want to know if you plan on attending the spring game on April 21st. Would you be interested in a TNIAAM meet-up before the game?",
