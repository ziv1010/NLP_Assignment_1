He wrote: “Good heavens, this is beyond awful.”\nAs people responded to his tweet, one person said he was “out of order”. Gary, who welcomed a second refugee into his home last year, replied: “There is no huge influx. We take far fewer refugees than other major European countries. This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s, and I’m out of order?”\nREAD MORE: Piers Morgan issues Gary Lineker defence after government migrants policy comment\nIt was later reported that the presenter's employer, the BBC, planned to speak to him about his comments. He would be “reminded of his responsibilities on social media”, according to Sky News.\nA spokesperson for the BBC added: “The BBC has social media guidance, which is published. Individuals who work for us are aware of their responsibilities relating to social media. We have appropriate internal processes in place if required.”\nAs politicians, journalists and members of the public shared their views online and Gary hit the headlines over the row, he returned to Twitter the following day to quip: “Morning all. Anything going on?” He then added: “Great to see the freedom of speech champions out in force this morning demanding silence from those with whom they disagree.”\nLater, Gary acknowledged the support he had received from those who agreed with him, writing: “I have never known such love and support in my life than I’m getting this morning (England World Cup goals aside, possibly). I want to thank each and every one of you. It means a lot. I’ll continue to try and speak up for those poor souls that have no voice. Cheers all.”\nThe Home Secretary meanwhile said she was disappointed with Gary's comments. Ms Braverman told BBC Breakfast: “I'm disappointed, obviously. I think it's unhelpful to compare our measures, which are lawful, proportionate and - indeed - compassionate, to 1930s Germany. I also think that we are on the side of the British people here.”\nGary's followers were divided over his comments, with some backing him while others disagreed. Will wrote: “Thanks Garry. As the grandson of a refugee it means a lot when people with your high profile speak out.”\nSteve commented: “Agree and support 100%. We used to be a country known for helping those far less fortunate than us. I'd like to think we might be again one day...but that won't happen with our current government.”\nAnd Johanna said: “You stated what all decent people are thinking and it really matters. Thank you, Gary.”\nBut Mark complained: “Gary Lineker is entitled to his opinions like everyone else but because of the set up of the BBC & being supposedly impartial he has to be careful what he tweets if he wants to go the political way then he will need to consider his position within the organization.”\nAnd Robert raged: “Every licence fee payer is funding Gary Lineker's anti-Brexit and anti-border control rants.”\nBut this isn't the first time the former England forward has caused controversy. Here are some of his most outspoken moments, including his feud with Piers Morgan, his BBC salary and the refugees he has hosted at his home.\nOutspoken moments\nIn September 2021, Gary criticised the Labour party, accusing its members and politicians of being more concerned about arguing among themselves than holding the Government to account. It came amid difficulties within the opposition party, including Andy McDonald's resignation as Shadow Secretary of State for Employment Rights and Protections.\nGary tweeted at the time: “Seems the Labour Party is constantly in opposition with itself rather than the government.”\nIn 2018, he clashed with ex-cricketer Jonathan Agnew, who told him he should keep his views on Brexit to himself. Jonathan wrote: “Gary. You are the face of BBC Sport. Please observe BBC editorial guidelines and keep your political views, whatever they are and whatever the subject, to yourself. I’d be sacked if I followed your example. Thanks.”\nBut Gary hit back: “Jonathan, I'm the face of my own Twitter account. I'll continue to tweet when I like and if folk disagree with me then so be it. Thank you so much for your concern, which, I imagine, wouldn't be a concern at all if you agreed with me.”\nShould Gary get the sack? Let us know in our poll below.\nSexism row\nLast summer, Gary received a backlash over a tweet he posted celebrating the England Women's football team winning the Euros. Referring to Chloe Kelly's celebration after scoring the winning goal – in which she waved her shirt above her head and celebrated with her teammates in her sports bra – Gary tweeted: “The @Lionesses have only gone and done it, and Kelly is England's heroine, bra none.”\nThe tweet immediately received criticism, with the Match of the Day presenter being accused of “casual sexism”. Gary later deleted the tweet.\nLater, he called the backlash “ludicrous”, telling the Telegraph: “It was ludicrous. But it was just a few people who, I think, weren't watching the football match. So they've automatically thought I was making a sexist comment because women wear bras.”\nGary said he only deleted the tweet because he feared it was being taken out of context by those who didn't watch the game, and so hadn't seen the celebration he was referring to.\nHe added: “I'm not easily bullied. I think about my tweets all the time. That's why I thought about that one. Because I thought it was quite funny. It was just a play on words, like I do all the time, in most of my tweets when I'm watching football matches.\n“I just try to be different, which is what I do on TV. I try to do similar kinds of things and I've always done it. And I just think a few people just took it the wrong way. And I understand that. If I've got 8.5 million followers, every tweet I do, someone will have a pop.”\nHosting refugees\nIn October last year, Gary revealed he had welcomed a second refugee into his Surrey home. He said the man, who is fleeing oppression from President Erdoğan's oppressive regime in Turkey, is now training to become a rocket scientist.\nGary told the Mirror: “He’s a really smart kid and wants to be a rocket scientist, actually. He was with us about a month and was such a sweet kid and has now gone to university.\n”The 26-year-old had been caught up in a military coup and imprisoned for 18 months in Turkey before fleeing.”\nHuge BBC salary – and major cut\nIn September 2020, Gary agreed to take a £400,000 pay cut as host of Match of the Day. He also agreed to be more careful when using Twitter to discuss politics.\nThe deal was announced at the same time as a BBC report that promised the corporation's staff would be bound by strict new rules on social media usage. BBC director general Tim Davie said at the time: “Gary knows that he has responsibilities to the BBC in terms of his use of social media.”\nGary said at the time: “I love working with the BBC, and am very proud to continue to be a part of their outstanding football team. I’m looking forward to the next five years – with a European Championship and World Cup on the horizon, it’s exciting times for me and the team.”\nHe also tweeted: “Oh dear. Thoughts are with the haters at this difficult time.”\nPiers Morgan feud\nFor years, Gary has been engaged in a Twitter feud with TV presenter Piers Morgan, with the pair often exchanging nasty blows on social media. Piers has criticsed Gary for everything from his salary, ratings, politics, and even his ears.\nIn 2019, Gary slammed the Government's decision to extend the suspension of parliament ahead of the UK's exit from the European Union. Piers replied: “Says the man who has howled for 3yrs that we should ignore the result of a democratic vote...”\nGary responded that he had never thought the 2016 Brexit vote should be ignored, writing: “We could though look at the crooked, lying nature of how it was sold to us back then by the elite now dictating (literally) and decide as a democratic country if that’s still what we want.”\nPiers hit back: “Mate, it doesn’t get more elite than you...as BBC licence fee payers know to our cost.” Gary replied: “Mate, it doesn’t get much more elite than ostentatiously showing off your wealth (you constantly tell me you earn way more than me) with a deluge of pictures by marauding, around the Côte d’Azur on a yacht.”\nPiers wasn't done, saying: “I don’t pretend not to be in the elite... and it’s not my fault I earn far more than you, it’s my talent.”\nIn the past, Piers has nicknamed Gary “jugs”, while Gary has branded Piers “tubs”. But in January last year, the pair appeared to have made up, with Piers tweeting a photo of Gary in an apron with “Chef Gaz” written on it, claiming the pundit was cooking him dinner.\nThe picture also showed the controversial host grinning and holding a glass of red wine. He captioned it: “Decided to finally get my BBC licence fee money out of Gary Lineker at his home last night.. have to say, Chef Gaz delivered a quite delicious feast including Gambas al Ajillo and Fillet steak au poivre.\n“Did everything himself (for 5 of us) and it was all perfectly cooked. Then he proudly showed off his golden boots, before the shock late Leicester result came through to ruin his evening. All in all, a most enjoyable soirée - and definitely worth 43p!”\nTV porn prank\nEarlier this year, Gary had an embarrassing moment on live TV when a phone that had been secretly hidden in the BBC studio started playing loud porn noises. The sound interrupted Gary's pre-match punditry ahead on an FA Cup tie.\nAs he discussed the game, the noises kept coming at regular intervals, as fans up and down the country laughed.\nA YouTuber, who uses the name Jarvo69 aka BMWJarvo, unveiled himself as the prankster. He streamed a live video explaining how he had managed to tape a phone to the back of the BBC's set.\nGary saw the funny side, and took to Twitter to explain what had caused the noises, writing: “Well, we found this taped to the back of the set. As sabotage goes it was quite amusing.”\nThe BBC later offered a formal apology, with a spokesperson saying: “We apologise to any viewers offended during the live coverage of the football this evening. We are investigating how this happened.”\nREAD NEXT:\n- Gary Lineker blasted by ‘blocked’ boxer Carl Froch after migrants policy comment\n- Gary Lineker migrant row: Leicester City fans and MPs react as BBC confirm stance\n- Sir David Attenborough's new BBC documentary may be his 'final' series\n- London pub from Ted Lasso TV show to invite fans to stay over for just £11 a night\n- Gogglebox fans upset as Pete and Sophie share a disturbing picture",
