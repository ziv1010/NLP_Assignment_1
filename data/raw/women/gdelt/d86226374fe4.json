The two-page report on ‘Children Under the Lash’ was the first in a three-part series of reports on cruelty to children in Irish and British schools, and highlighted the concerns of local GP, the late Dr Paddy Randles, about the beatings being experienced by young lads in the town. However, the editions of the News of the World covering the issue over the following weeks disappeared from outside shops in the town before proprietors opened up for their Sunday morning customers.\nDr Randles made the brave move of speaking out against what he saw going on in the town in the 1960s. As a local doctor, he had many mothers in Navan bringing their young sons to him, having suffered injuries at the hands of their teachers at the primary school.\nThe News of the World spoke to three of the young lads at the time, as well as Dr Randles. One young boy, who had broken an arm while swinging on a tree a year earlier, was hit on the same arm six to ten times a day by a rubber hosepipe.\nWhen his mother went to the school to complain, she was told she was not a fit mother. The young boy’s parents eventually went to a solicitor in Dublin to get a summons issued.\nRepresentatives of Reform, a society campaigning for abolition of corporal punishment in Irish schools, went to see the head brother, but he had nothing to say.\nDr Randles told the News of the World: “The boy’s father was so annoyed he was going around to see the brother,” he said. “I persuaded him not to go. I went and saw the head brother and asked if he was aware that a rubber hosepipe was being used. He asked me ‘Would you like to see what I use?’ and produced a strap and threw it on the table.”\nDr Randles, an expert on children with a keen interest in child psychology, described it as a form of sadism.\nThe News of the World reporter attempted to talk to one of the Brothers at the local showground, where he was refereeing a boys’ football match. He promised to talk afterwards, but cycled off and didn’t appear as arranged.\n“Next day, we learned that another teaching brother from the school had visited the boy’s father at his place of work and tried to persuade him to have our report suppressed,” the newspaper writes.\nHe wasn’t the only one seeking to bury the reports. When they appeared on 4th May 1969, the newspapers were cleared out of the shops in town before Mass-goers emerged from first Mass. Over the following Sundays, deliveries of the newspaper left rolled up outside newsagents in the town disappeared in the early mornings. A truck delivering newspapers to Navan was stopped at Kilcarn Bridge and the newspapers dumped in the river Boyne.\nDrs Paddy and Mary Randles had contacted the newspaper in 1969, in an era when local and national newspapers in Ireland were much more conservative and slow to rock the establishment, as in evidenced in the Meath Chronicle reporting of the situation at the time.\nA small story on the front page of the Chronicle on 10th May 1969 was headlined ‘De La Salle Brothers’ Work Appreciated’ and read as follows: “It was unanimously resolved at a meeting of Navan De La Salle Past Pupils’ Union on Tuesday night (1) that we fully appreciate the work of the De La Salle Brothers for the past 52 years in Navan; (2) we reassure them of our continue loyalty and our confidence in their work for the boys of Navan, both inside and outside the school.”\nThe issue became controversial again in the late 1990s when a De La Salle school reunion was proposed.\nDr Randles died in July 2017, aged 93, and in May 2018, the council of the town which had previously ostracised his wife and himself honoured him with the unveiling of a bench in his memory, close to their practice on Watergate Street. It was around this time that Sinead O'Shea became aware of his story.\n“When I left Navan at 17, I felt it was a conservative place. I discovered later it was a hotbed of resistance. I’d been oblivious,” she said following the Boston screening.\nA friend told the filmmaker about Dr Randles and how he had “really stood up to the church in terms of corporal punishment.\n\"I met Mary, and she was emphatic about Paddy’s role but did not mention what she’d done or the mother and baby homes.”\nWhile O’Shea was conducting interviews with Mary, a report came out in 2021 that cited atrocities in Ireland’s mother and baby homes where 9,000 children died over the decades all the way until 1998.\n“I asked if she knew about it, and she said, ‘Oh yes, we used to hide unmarried mothers here.’ It was so amazing. She would never volunteer information, but if you asked her the right questions, she’d tell you. It’s part of the general modesty of the place.”\nPray For Our Sinners recounts the experiences of Mary, Betty, and Ethna about the brutal treatment of young, unmarried pregnant women who were separated from their families and placed in “mother and baby homes,” run by Catholic nuns, where girls were mistreated, many infants died, and many were taken illegally for adoption.\nA fourth subject, Norman, details how as a boy, he was routinely beaten in the De La Salle school. Norman was forced to leave school at age nine to work in a factory long before physical punishment in schools was eventually banned in 1984.\nO’Shea wanted to highlight how these ordinary people stood up to the powerful Catholic Church’s injustice and mistreatment at a time when there was little institutional or community support. In addition to sheltering young girls at their home, the Randles dispensed contraception, which was illegal at the time, and helped Betty get her infant daughter back after she was illegally adopted. Ethna refused to go to a mother and baby home and kept her baby.\nO’Shea said one of her goals for the film is to give credit to these unsung heroes.\n“Nobody was praising them for taking such huge risks when the stakes were really high for them. To me, that’s real heroism. I sometimes think a lot of what we praise these days is quite shallow; when the stakes are high, that’s bravery,” she said.\nBreak Out Pictures, distributors of Oscar-nominated 'An Cailin Ciúin', has announced Pray For Our Sinners, will open in cinemas from 21st April next.\nThe film is directed by O’Shea, produced by O’Shea and Maya Derrington with Katie Holly as executive producer. It will screen at the Lighthouse Cinema, Smithfield, in the Dublin Film Festival at 8.30pm on Friday 3rd March.",
