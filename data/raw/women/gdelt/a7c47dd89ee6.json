  "body_text": "Kelly Smith backs Arsenal to return ‘stronger’ and challenge Chelsea for WSL title next season\nArsenal legend Kelly Smith believes the Gunners will be “stronger” next season and can compete to win the Women’s Super League title once key players return from injury.\nSmith returned to the club last month to join Jonas Eidevall’s coaching staff as Arsenal reached the Champions League semi-finals and battled to finish in the top three of the WSL, despite being depleted by injuries over the final weeks of the season.\nArsenal lost four senior players to ACL injuries last season in Leah Williamson, Beth Mead, Vivianne Miedema and Laura Wienroither, as well as captain Kim Little to a season-ending hamstring injury.\nThe Gunners face an important summer in the transfer market as Eidevall looks to bring in reinforcements to the squad, while the news that Brazil centre back Rafaelle Souza will be leaving the club has given Arsenal another area to strengthen.\nBut Smith believes the younger players who stepped up over the final weeks of the season, such as midfielders Victoria Pelova and Kathrine Kuhl, will benefit from the experience and will give Arsenal additional depth as they look to compete with champions Chelsea for the title.\n“Any time the season rolls around it is our ambition to win the title, compete in the Champions League, and win trophies,” Smith told The Independent. “That’s the club that Arsenal are.\n“We have to recalibrate in terms of the injuries, get them back on the pitch, and look at the transfer window. I know Jonas has been in meetings talking about the players he wants to bring in, so new signings will be coming in to strengthen the squad that we have.\n“I think the injuries certainly hindered us but the players who stepped up and wore the Arsenal shirt did themselves so proud - they couldn’t have done any more.\n“But those players really stepped up in a big, big moment and that will help them for next season.\n“The amount of injuries we’ve sustained this season has given other players opportunities a lot of game time that they might not have had if those players were fit. So I think we are going to be stronger in that aspect moving forward.”\nSmith, one of Arsenal and England’s greatest players who won four league titles and five FA Cups with the Gunners, hopes to return to Eidevall’s coaching staff next season after passing on her experience to the team over the final stages of the season.\n“I was delighted when Jonas and Clare [Wheatley, head of women’s football] approached me to come in and work with the players,” Smith said.\n“I’ve been working with the attacking players, looking at their finishing and mentality, trying to help them in the final-third area. I’ve been watching the game and giving opinions from afar but being back in the environment and seeing how Jonas works, it’s been exciting.\n“ I had been out of the game since 2016 in that respect but it’s been really good: the game has evolved since I was around and there’s a whole new professional element to it. I’m delighted to be back amongst it.”\nKelly Smith is a Barclays Football Amdassador",
