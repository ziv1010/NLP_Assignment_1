  "body_text": "Anthony Joshua and Jake Paul will face off this week in a controversial night for boxing. Jake vs Joshua: Judgment Day has been billed as a ‘colossal showdown’ between the sport’s ‘biggest disruptor’, YouTuber-turned fighter Jake Paul, and Britain’s Anthony Joshua.\nPaul (12-1, 7 KOs) is a WBA number 14-ranked cruiserweight, while “AJ” (28-4, 25 KOs) is a two-time unified WBO, WBA, and IBF heavyweight world champion and Olympic gold medalist. The two will meet at the Kaseya Center in Miami, Florida, with the fight marking Joshua’s return to the ring after his defeat to Daniel Dubois in September 2024.\nThe fight will be a sanctioned, professional heavyweight bout contested over eight, three-minute rounds with 10oz gloves. Both fighters exchanged words in their pre-fight press conference, with Paul saying it will be ‘the biggest upset in the history of sports’.\nAs reported by Sky Sports, he said: “There’s no sporting teams in history that have gone together where it's this big of a difference in terms of skill, experience, resume, height, weight, etc. So this is going to be the biggest upset in the history of sports and you guys get to witness it.”\nJoshua claimed he’s taking part in the controversial fight for the boxing ‘purists’, saying: “With this one it feels like I’m being pulled in to save the purists of boxing because people don’t like I’m fighting Jake. If we look at the people that don’t want me to be here, but want me to put an end to ‘the Jake Paul show’, I understand it and that’s why I carry boxing on my back with this fight.”\nThe main card also features eight professional bouts including Anderson Silva vs Tyron Woodley, as well as several women’s fights and international contenders across weight divisions. Ahead of the fight this week, we’ve found a way to watch the entire Jake vs Joshua card for free.\nWhen is Anthony Joshua vs Jake Paul?\nAs the fight is being held in Miami, Anthony Joshua vs Jake Paul will begin in the early hours of Saturday, December 20, here in the UK. The main card is scheduled for 1am, with the Joshua and Paul ringwalks expected to start around 3.30am.\nAnthony Joshua and Jake Paul will face off for a heavyweight clash in Miami on December 19. The fight will stream live on Netflix, which fans can get for free with Sky's £15 Essential TV bundle, the brand's 'lowest ever price' for Sky TV.\n£0\nNetflix | SkyHow to watch Anthony Joshua vs Jake Paul without having to pay for Netflix\nAnthony Joshua vs Jake Paul will air exclusively on Netflix at no extra cost with a regular subscription. However, there’s a way to bag free Netflix access from Sky, which throws in a membership at no extra cost with all of its TV streaming packages.\nThese start at £15 for the Essential TV bundle, which also comes with around 100 channels and free Discovery+. There’s no Sky Sports access included though, so football, darts and boxing fans may want to consider the £35 Essential TV, Netflix and Sky Sports bundle.\nVirgin Media also gives away free Netflix access with its rival packages such as the £37.99 Entertainment bundle, which comes with 362Mbs broadband alongside more than 200 TV channels. The downside is both providers require customers to sign up for 24-month contracts to get these prices.\nNetflix’s coverage on the night will be led by Kate Scott as the main host, alongside a team of desk analysts including Lennox Lewis, Laila Ali, and Andre Ward. The ringside team will be led by Mauro Ranallo, with expert analysis by David Haye and Crystina Poncher.\nAnthony Joshua vs Jake Paul full fight card\nJake Paul vs Anthony Joshua (Heavyweight)\nAlycia Baumgardner vs Leila Beaudoin (Super featherweight)\nCaroline Dubois vs Camila Panatta (Lightweight)\nAnderson Silva vs Tyron Woodley (Cruiserweight)\nCherneka Johnson vs Amanda Galle (Bantamweight)\nYokasta Valle vs Yadira Bustillos (Minimumweight)\nAvious Griffin vs Justin Cardona (Welterweight)\nKeno Marley vs Diarra Davis Jr (Cruiserweight)\nJahmal Harvey vs Kevin Cervantes (Super featherweight)",
