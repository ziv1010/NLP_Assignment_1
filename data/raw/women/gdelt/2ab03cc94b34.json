Steve Smith was the only Sixers batter who looked somewhat comfortable on a slower Perth pitch. He made a mere 24 off 13 balls before being given out LBW.\nThe Scorchers had no troubles chasing down the low total of 132, doing it with 15 balls to spare. The win sees the Scorchers lift its sixth BBL trophy.\nView this post on Instagram\nOn the court, the Australian Open is well and truly in the pointy end of the season.

Supporting the Sky Blues, from elite squads through to the Academy, has always been about helping athletes at every level perform at their best. We’re proud to continue that journey for another three years.”\nThis partnership extension also introduces a new collaboration with ISC Sport, designed to strengthen production capabilities, elevate product innovation, and streamline kit delivery across the club.“It is incredibly exciting for ISC to be involved in this extended partnership.

We are thrilled to be building on this relationship for another three seasons as we head into an exciting future together.”\nThe renewed deal also sees Under Armour maintain naming rights to the Under Armour Sydney FC Cup, an Australian underage elite pathway tournament, reinforcing the shared goal of strengthening grassroots participation and providing young footballers with meaningful development opportunities.\nThe extension underscores a trusted and values-led relationship and positions all three partners to continue delivering world-class product, support and innovation for players and fans throughout the next three seasons.\nKaylee McKeown x Always Human\nSports and entertainment marketing agency Always Human has added Aussie swimming powerhouse Kaylee McKeown to its talent pool, taking on exclusive management representation for the Olympic champion and world record holder.\nThis partnership marks a major milestone in McKeown’s career, and further cements Always Human’s reputation as an agency that helps build the commercial and cultural relevance of Australian athletes.\nThere are very few athletes who can lay claim to being the greatest-of-all-time while they are still competing. McKeown is one of them. A five-time Olympic champion and nine-time Olympic medallist, McKeown is the most successful individual Australian Olympian in history.\nMcKeown is the reigning Olympic champion in both the 100m and 200m backstroke, a double she has achieved at two consecutive Olympic Games. In doing so, she became the first woman in history to win both events across back-to-back Olympics.\nThat success has been underpinned by global supremacy. A three-time world-record holder, McKeown is the first woman ever to simultaneously hold the world records in the 50m, 100m and 200m backstroke.\n“We’re thrilled Kaylee has chosen Always Human to represent her going forward. Kaylee is undoubtedly Australia’s golden girl of the pool. With the Commonwealth Games this year, annual major international swimming meets, and then the LA 2028 Olympics all within the next few years, Kaylee will be one of the most visible and celebrated athletes in the country,” said Josh White, CEO of Always Human Group and McKeown’s manager.\n“Our team is focused on helping drive Kaylee’s brand, commercial partnerships and profile to ensure she is capitalising on her incredible achievements.”\n“I’m ecstatic to be signing with Always Human as I head into the next Olympic cycle. They’ve worked alongside some of Australia’s top-tier athletes, and I’m excited to be part of a team that aligns so strongly with my values,” commented McKeown on her move.\nAlways Human’s talent division represents a roster of some of Australia’s highest profiled athletes and creators, including global football star Mary Fowler, three-time Olympic champion Jessica Fox, two-time AFL Norm Smith medalist Will Ashcroft, cricket icon Ellyse Perry, Pole Vault Olympic champion Nina Kennedy, ex-Wallaby Nick ‘Honey Badger’ Cummins, and hit sports podcast Hello Sport.",
