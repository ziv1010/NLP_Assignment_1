Skelly’s Langwarrin was convincingly beaten 5-0 away to Caroline Springs George Cross in their VPL1 clash last weekend while Macleod’s Chelsea closed to within a point of top spot in State 4 South.n Langy is in the midst of a relegation battle with three teams facing the drop at season’s end.\nThere was no stopping George Cross striker Saif-Eddine Sakhi on Saturday and his hat-trick underpinned a commanding display by the home side with Brad Blumenthal’s 76th-minute goal the sole response from the visitors. “We are now in that relegation battle with probably four other teams,” Skelly said. “It was a disappointing result and George Cross were just too good for us on the night to be honest.” The result drops Langwarrin down to second-bottom in the league two points above Moreland City, equal on points with Kingston City and a point behind Melbourne Srbija. Eastern Lions are 10th with 14 points.\nChelsea thumped Sandown Lions 8-1 at Edithvale Recreation Reserve on Friday night. It was no contest by half-time with the home side 4-0 up. Luke D’Alessandro started the rout after five minutes then two Daniel Vella goals in 10 minutes gave Sandown a mountain to climb. James Stinson scored then repeated the does just after half-time before a Dylan Scott free-kick in the 60th minute had the Sandown keeper scrambling in vain at his near post. A deliberate handball to stop a goal-bound Adam Dunsford header reduced Sandown to 10 men and Stinson completed his hat-trick from the resultant penalty. Laim Burford made it 8-0 and Sandown’s sole reply came a few minutes from the end.\nChelsea 16-year-old Matthew O’Neill had a superb game and was involved in the build-up to most of the goals. Chelsea went into the contest without Daniel Lewis, Nathan Boccari, Nathan Gondelle, Christian Murray, Adam Bartosy and Alex Namar.\nIn more State 4 news another sensational night at Rosebud culminated in a goal-of-the-season contender as the home side ran out a 2-1 winner over Mentone. Rosebud missed some early opportunities but broke through in the 24th minute when an inswinging corner from Connor Wharton was met with a great leap from Kori Weetch who headed truly to make it 1-0.\nMentone’s usual goal threat Marcus Spivey brought his side back into the contest in the 78th minute with a great finish from the edge of the box. With just three minutes of normal time remaining it was going to take something special to decide the issue and it arrived with a goal-of-the-season contender from Barney Johnson. The young midfielder ran onto a cleared corner from the Mentone defence and unleashed a stunning 30-metre drive that rocketed into goal off a post.\nSomerville and host Lyndale United drew 1-1 in a scrappy encounter last weekend. Marcus Anastasiou broke the deadlock in the second half when he ran onto a Max Watson through ball and calmly slotted home. But Lyndale earned a well-deserved point when Mohammad Yaquby levelled in the 85th minute.\nBaxter earned a 3-3 draw with high-flying Endeavour United at Baxter Park on Saturday. It was a gritty performance from the home side to recover from 3-1 down. Davide Sbalchiero, Ali-Zamer Noor and Daniel Bancroft scored for Baxter.\nFrankston Pines were thumped 12-1 away to Monash University last weekend. Jaishiv Narayan scored for Pines in the club’s largest losing margin this century.\nIn State 1 news Mornington produced a statement performance overpowering Doveton 5-0 at Dallas Brooks Park on Saturday. In the 21st minute Rory Wagner who was a standout throughout was brought down in the box and Kieran Dover stepped up and calmly converted to put the home side in front.\nJust before the break James Kelly finished off a superb team move to double the lead and knock the wind out of Doveton’s sails.\nAfter the restart Mornington took full control. Dover continued his fine form adding two more goals to complete a hat-trick and the Seagulls’ display was capped off when former assistant coach David Stirton came off the bench to slot home the fifth goal to seal a comprehensive win.\nIn State 2 news Peninsula Strikers had a 2-1 away win over Berwick City last weekend. In the third minute a superb Danny Brooks through ball split apart the Berwick backline and Cooper Andrews squared the ball to Wayne “Buzzer” Gordon who buried it in the bottom corner for the opener.\nStrikers could have doubled their lead two minutes later when Campbell Steedman was put through but his effort was well saved by Berwick keeper Colby Jones. In the 33rd minute Jaiden Madafferi released Joel Bowen who got to the ball first only to be clattered into by Jones. The referee pointed to the spot and Steedman converted to make it 2-0.\nStrikers couldn’t add to the score despite creating chances in the second half and Berwick hit back in the 67th minute when a cleared corner fell to Nathan Credlin who hit a screamer into the top corner.\nThe visitors then defended resolutely to claim a deserved three points.\nSkye United drew 0-0 with Mooroolbark in their annual John Ramsden Memorial Day clash at Skye Recreation Reserve on Saturday. Skye had the better of the chances in the first half and could consider itself unlucky not to be leading at half-time. The second half was a more even affair but neither side could break the deadlock.\nThe day was a triple header with Mooroolbark which saw Skye’s reserves claim a 2-0 win earlier in the day Skye’s State 2 women’s team downing the Barkers 3-0 in the evening. The John Ramsden Memorial Winners were Paul Aitchison (seniors) and Adam Ford (reserves).\nIn State 5 news Mount Eliza cemented its grip on second place with a 4-1 home win over Cleeland United last weekend. Austin Mcewen opened the scoring after three minutes when he finished from a Jackson Tossavainen cross and Josh Luca ran onto a Mcewen through ball in the 30th minute finishing well to make it 2-0. Half-time substitute Ronnie Rono reduced the deficit in the 56th minute but McEwen restored Mount Eliza’s two-goal cushion in the 83rd minute following a cutback from Noah Green. In added time Tossavainen ran onto a Fraser Keon pass and rounded Cleeland keeper Khalid Katikang before tapping in to secure the scoreline.\nAspendale got back to winning ways with a 5-0 home win over Mount Martha on Saturday. The opener came from Ben Garside who stabbed home a well-flighted free-kick in the 18th minute. James Macnab was put through in the 62nd minute and finished off from just outside the box. Harry Salisbury’s rapid-fire hat-trick ended the contest. It started with him hammering the ball past Mount Martha keeper Derren Elliott in the 73rd minute. It was 4-0 two minutes later after Salisbury rounded Elliott and a defender then slotted the ball home.\nIn the 86th minute the rout was completed with a carbon copy of Salisbury ‘s second. Mount Martha head coach Charlie Platt felt the scoreline wasn’t indicative of his side’s display. “I’m still getting over the shock of losing this one,” he said the day after the match. “Three votes to their keeper and the crossbar.”\nSeaford lost 3-2 away to Pakenham United last Saturday. Dylan Waugh and Zail Ahmad scored for Seaford in a contest marred by a number of controversial decisions. None more so than the winning goal which came from a free-kick that Seaford is adamant should have been awarded to Tristen Stass. The free-kick took a large deflection that wrong-footed Seaford keeper Hayden Hicks.\nNEXT WEEKEND\nSaturday, 24 May, 3pm\nBayside Argonauts v Mornington, Shipston Reserve\nPeninsula Strikers v Doncaster Rovers, Centenary Park\nBentleigh Utd Cobras v Skye Utd, Victory Park\nChelsea v Rosebud, Edithvale Recreation Reserve\nBaxter v Frankston Pines, Baxter Park\nSomerville Eagles v Endeavour Utd, Westernport Secondary College\nSeaford Utd v Mount Eliza, North Seaford Reserve\nAspendale v Cleeland Utd, Aspendale Gardens Sports Ground\nMonday, 26 May, 8.30pm\nFC Bulleen Lions v Langwarrin, Veneto Club\nMount Martha BYE",
