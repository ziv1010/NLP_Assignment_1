Vine's barrister Gervase de Wilde told the hearing in London that the abuse began after Barton's comments on women, particularly in the media and involved in football, started from the end of 2023.\nIn one social media post, Barton compared female pundits Eni Aluko and Lucy Ward to serial killers Fred and Rose West. In response, Vine asked whether the former footballer had a brain injury. Barton then launched a \"calculated and sustained attack on Vine\" in January this year, Vine's barrister said, publishing several posts to his 2.8 million followers and began using \"#bikenonce\" on X, formerly known as Twitter, which led to it trending on the platform.\nSettling the case, Barton, 41, - who has been out of work since being sacked by Bristol Rovers last October – admitted his claims were “untrue” and agreed to pay Vine £75,0000 in damages and legal costs. He also posted a grovelling apology on social media.\nREAD MORE: Joey Barton launches X-rated blast at Match of the Day host Gary LinekerBut in a statement after the hearing, Vine said Barton’s apology and commitment to pay damages and legal costs “is not the final outcome of this case”. Giving more background to the case, the 59-year-old continued: “After five defamatory tweets, my lawyer offered Barton a chance to settle: pay £75k, plus my costs, and make an apology. He ignored that offer and posted more disgusting tweets about me, even publishing my home address to his followers.\n“When I then took my case to the High Court, a judge ruled that TEN of the tweets I complained of were defamatory. Having lost, Barton has returned to the offer we made after tweet five. There has therefore been a parallel action on tweets 6-10 and Barton will pay further damages on these.” He added: “A number of other steps – including statements made in Court by way of apology – are still to be taken, and Barton has agreed to pay my legal costs of all the claims. Jeremy Vine.”\nBarton’s statement from earlier today said: “Between 8 and 12 January 2024 I published 11 posts which accused Jeremy Vine of having a sexual interest in children, and created a hashtag which made the same allegations, which were viewed millions of times. I recognise that this is a very serious allegation. It is untrue. I do not believe that Mr Vine has a sexual interest in children, and I wish to set the record straight. I also published posts during the same period in which I referred to Mr Vine having advocated forced vaccination during the Covid 19 pandemic, based upon a video clip of his TV programme.\n\"I accept that he did not advocate this policy and that the video clip has been edited to give a misleading impression of what he was in fact saying. I then taunted and abused Mr Vine for bringing a legal complaint against me. I have agreed not to make the same allegations again about Mr Vine and I apologise to him for the distress he has suffered. To resolve his claims against me in defamation and harassment, I have agreed to pay Mr Vine £75,000 in damages and his legal costs.\"\nREAD MORE: Marks & Spencer's £30 accessory immediately makes summer dresses look more expensiveFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads",
