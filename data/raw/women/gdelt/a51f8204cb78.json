The prognosis is good. The amazing medical team around me are really confident of the prospects after treatment.\"\n---\nThe Commonwealth Ombudsman has found ACT police are escalating some situations by an excessive use of force.\nAn investigation from Iain Anderson has concluded behaviour it calls 'unprofessional' - including impatience, aggression, and foul language - has worsened some interactions in around one third of the cases reviewed.\nThe Ombudsman says such behaviour has the potential to disproportionately impact on vulnerable members of the ACT community including young people, First Nations people and those experiencing mental health challenges.\nThe Ombudsman's investigation reviewed more than 6000 [[6,255]] use of force reports, 201 files of body-worn camera or CCTV footage, and 645 training and governance documents, as well as the results of interviews with AFP and ACT Policing officers.\n---\nTasmania's embattled Liberal premier is expected to formally request an early election today, putting the island state on track for a second poll in as many years.\nThe call follows Jeremy Rockliff's refusal to step down as premier after losing a no-confidence motion put forward by Labor and supported by the Greens and three crossbench MPs.\nHe is expected to formally make the request today, following a sitting of state parliament to pass an emergency budget bill to ensure public servants get paid.\nLiberal MP Felix Ellis has posted on social media that the party remains behind Mr Rockliff and his decisions.\n\"The reason why we are being forced to an election as a state is because of the selfish ambition and ego of Dean Winter. This is all about him and it's all on his head.\"\n---\nAuthorities are warning snow-goers to listen to official advice following a series of rescues in heavy snow over the long weekend.\nInspector Tracey Johnston, from the Wangaratta Police Station in Victoria, says 13 people were rescued after becoming stuck due to the snow around Mount Hotham, while two bush walkers were recovered from a trail at Wonnangatta, near Mount Kosciuszko in the Snowy Mountains.\n\"We are warning snow goers to obey road closure signs to allow emergency services to continue their work at this time. They are also continuing to search the area to identify if there are any further people who require rescue at this time.\"\nSnowfall has continued across ski resorts in Victoria and New South Wales, adding to the 40-to-60 centimetres that has already fallen.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology says snow showers are expected to continue across the New South Wales ranges and tablelands above about 900 metres.\n---\nA group of Australian fire crews are on their way to support Canadian colleagues who are battling wildfires in Alberta.\nThe contingents are being sent under the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding established between the two countries, which relates to cooperation that might be needed in the event of emergency situations.\nThe Calgary Herald says there are currently 61 fires burning in the province, with 23 of them classified as being out of control.\nManitoba Minister for Natural Resources and Indigenous Futures Ian Bushie has previously said crews are arriving from interstate as well as the US and other partner countries to help combat them.\n\"Manitoba has deployed more than 650 people to support the firefighter efforts with a little more than 175 firefighters from out of province. We've deployed more than 57 aircraft and more than 80 firefighting equipment to communities that need it.\"\n---\nThere has been a second mix-up with an embryo transfer at an Australian fertility company.\nThe first incident in 2023 involved the transfer of the wrong embryo to a Brisbane woman, who later gave birth to the other couple's baby.\nMonash IVF has released a statement confirming the second incident at its Clayton fertility clinic in Melbourne, which involved an embryo being incorrectly transferred to a patient, contrary to the treatment plan which designated the transfer should have been to the patient's partner.\nThe statement says it is conducting an internal investigation and putting processes in place to stop another error from occurring.\n\"Commencing immediately, Monash IVF will implement interim additional verification processes and patient confirmation safeguards over and above normal practice and electronic witness systems, to ensure patients and clinicians have every confidence in its processes.\"\n---\nTo sport and in football news, the Matildas have poached Central Coast's championship-winning coach Emily Husband to join new coach Joe Montemurro's staff as an assistant.\nHusband has previously worked with Montemurro for last year's ALW All Stars game against Arsenal.\nHer appointment follows two successful years at the helm of the Mariners.\nThe Englishwoman was A-League Women's coach of the year in her first season in 2023-24 when she built the Mariners' squad from scratch, then led them to the semi-finals.",
