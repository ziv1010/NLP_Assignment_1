With the playoffs and Pizza cup out of the way for us for a while you'd hope now ...forever and the Champions league there this season (too early for us ;-) ) ,I guess the Carabao or FA cup in a season or two when we are a settled Prem team are our best chance to get this monkey off our back....Unless our Academy team do indeed Pizza cup it. We are one of only four league clubs now with creepy Crawley making the final of the playoffs this season. Still to play there...Accrington (Who ? ) ,the not noisy neighbours Colchester and grim ooop north Blackburn the others. Spuds have played the most due to their residence a year or two back,Todd Boehly's FM game team 2nd most....and Bournemouth would be with us except they played Spurs when in residence...so a little cheaty in that respect.

It’s a very odd stat though. We certainly are due an appearance there. A cup final win would do it. No point in going there and losing. I’m not a huge fan of new Wembley. I’ve been quite a few times now and it’s fine. But more than the aggro of getting in and out of the place, it lacks the old stadium’s grandeur; magic somehow. Arriving at the old stadium as a child for the first time (a home international), seeing the stadium lights then walking into that arena took the breath away. Maybe that’s just me being nostalgic. | | | |\n| NEW Wembley appearance on 15:39 - May 28 with 4026 views | J2BLUE | On the surface it sounds bad but i'm very happy we didn't play in a play off final at Wembley in either of the last two years. | |\n| |\n| NEW Wembley appearance on 15:41 - May 28 with 4003 views | blueasfook |\n| NEW Wembley appearance on 15:39 - May 28 by J2BLUE | On the surface it sounds bad but i'm very happy we didn't play in a play off final at Wembley in either of the last two years. |\nHaving been to new Wembley a couple of times to watch other games, I hate it.

I saw one of the Olympics matches there. Also saw England once in a friendly and the NFL games maybe 6 or 7 times which isn’t the same as seeing your team. I’m trying to be nice about it but struggling. | | | |\n| NEW Wembley appearance on 15:51 - May 28 with 3883 views | withyblue |\n| NEW Wembley appearance on 15:41 - May 28 by blueasfook | Having been to new Wembley a couple of times to watch other games, I hate it.

Dad always promised he'd take me there when Ipswich returned when I first started my love of Ipswich post Robson just beginning Ferguson era when I had just started secondary school ...kind of expecting it would be a regular thing I think and not without reason. Of course we know how things went and the one time we were there (old) Wembley I was backpacking India...and dad has been gone now 12 years so ..... come on K-Mac get us there asap. ;-) [Post edited 28 May 2024 16:03]\n| |\n| |\n| NEW Wembley appearance on 16:07 - May 28 with 3756 views | BlueBoots | I think Accrington Stanley never played at the old Wembley either, so they're the only team in that particular club | |\n| |\n| NEW Wembley appearance on 16:12 - May 28 with 3703 views | Churchman |\n| NEW Wembley appearance on 15:51 - May 28 by withyblue | Too young to have been to the old one but being an athletics stadium I have always thought it looked a bit crap akin to West Ham's ground today.

So few got to play there and the FA Cup Final was the only club game televised live. I got to see Ipswich all three times at old Wembley (I think as an amateur club they played once there too) and on quite a few other occasions for England, events, other matches. Yes, it had a running track and yes, you were away from the pitch especially at the ends. But it didn’t seem to matter. Even with a small crowd like Crewe v Brentford it was special. For the 78 game, we stood behind the goal in ‘the gallery’. 20,000 standing in that area on the upper level where you see all the banners etc. Despite how it looks, the view was really good. The terrace was more than twice the depth of a normal one and the angle quite steep. For 2000 we sat in the same place but the other side of the goal. Whether distances from the pitch like that are acceptable now is an interesting point. My neighbour who is a WHU ST holder thinks the London Stadium great. Everyone else I know whose been for football thinks it awful. The problem with Wembley was age. It was like Leeds - falling apart. Access wasn’t great, toilets thrown up breeze block affairs. It was nearly 80 years old underneath the 60s refurb and it showed. You can build a new stadium with identity. Spurs’ ground is amazing. Miles better than Wembley, Emirates or the flat pack specials dotted around the country. | | | | Login to get fewer ads\n| NEW Wembley appearance on 16:18 - May 28 with 3655 views | burnbudgiesburn |\n| NEW Wembley appearance on 16:12 - May 28 by Churchman | It was intake of breath football holy grail for clubs.

Of course a good point made by Churchman ,there were not the quantity of big stadiums as there are now in the country which had official capacities rather than squeeze as many as you can in..I think it was 100,000 ? Apart from that there was no HUGE stadiums that were not club grounds I don't think and they were dwarfed by Wembley...now of course we have Twickers all built up ,Millennium Stadium,Olympic,Spurs,Arsenal,etc,etc [Post edited 28 May 2024 16:30]\n| |\n| |\n| NEW Wembley appearance on 16:47 - May 28 with 3490 views | Churchman |\n| NEW Wembley appearance on 16:29 - May 28 by Perublue | Did they have Speedway there too or is that White city i'm thinking of ?

They even had horses clobbering the pitch. It held the magic 100,000. For night games too. The atmosphere was unique. The bigger grounds could accommodate big numbers. The 78 semi final for example was at Highbury and the crowd was around 55,000. If you hadn’t been to the toilet before the game you’d better have laid off the drink. Facilities were minimal and losing your spot on the terrace was a seriously bad idea, even if you could move. | | | |\n| NEW Wembley appearance on 17:08 - May 28 with 3377 views | Ftnfwest | In all honesty it's become a bit of a badge of honour for me.

The vastness of the stadium, the pitch and the crowd was exhilarating and certainly did take the breath away. There were 100,000 packed into the stadium and I spent most of the evening with my hands trapped down my side as it was like sardines in a tin Even better, England won 2-0 with Colin Bell & Malcolm McDonald the scorers.

We were on the terrace behind the goal at the tunnel end standing at the front of the upper level. Beckenbauer played along with Vogts, Holzenbein, Wimmer, Bonhof and Sepp Maier. They played in those green shirts. http://www.englandfootballonli | | | |\n| NEW Wembley appearance on 17:58 - May 28 with 3171 views | Pique | Most of the other clubs who've played there have been there either as a result of a playoff final (ie failing to get promoted automatically) or some silly pizza type cup.

Lots of people only experience it for nothing games, or rather games where you are not that bothered about the outcome and the atmosphere is generally poor. I struggle to get interested in any international football outside of a tournament for example yet go to plenty of England home games and always come away thinking why bother. I imagine saints fans on Sunday thought it was great. | | | |\n| NEW Wembley appearance on 19:20 - May 28 with 3040 views | Perublue |\n| NEW Wembley appearance on 19:14 - May 28 by PrideOfTheEast | Atmosphere for the England vs. Germany game at the last euros and similarly the Denmark semi final were both brilliant, and perhaps better given the crowd restrictions for covid/both games being mid week.

The walk up Wembley Way with the twin towers ahead, the climb up the stairs to see the expanse of the pitch and the entire stadium - just awe inspiring. Got to go to the European Cup Final as my first visit in 68 as an impressionable youngster and had I not already seen my first Town game by that stage (12 Sep 67, Southampton in the League Cup under the lights; thrashed 'em ) then things might have been different.* * Although I doubt it. | |\n| |\n| NEW Wembley appearance on 02:28 - Mar 4 with 1032 views | Perublue | I’ve lost track of how many others there are .. but I know we still populate the tiny list. | |\n| |\n| |",
