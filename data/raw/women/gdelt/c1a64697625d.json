Bringing a further boost to March will be a packed programme of region-wide entertainment.\nHere we have picked out 10 ideas for things to do and places to go across the month; several of them being in Newcastle but with others included in Northumberland and Durham. And there should be something to suit all tastes, with suggestions for live music included - classical and alt rock-punk - plus debut exhibitions; a cocktail festival; one-off events and shows offering something different at the theatre.\nInternational Women's Day is also coming up on March 8 and then there's Mother's Day on March 30 so there may be ideas here too that could make for a suitable celebration or present. In the middle of the month, as previously reported, there's the city's March 13-17 PaddyFest which this year will be incorporating a Fan Zone for the Carabao Cup. So, all in all, March is going to be time for get-togethers and fun - enjoy it!\nThe Shark is Broken\nThe unforgettable trio of Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss who made up the shark-hunting team at the heart of legendary 1975 movie Jaws is to be recreated at the Theatre Royal in Newcastle this March on a tour stop of this comedy which co-stars Shaw's son Ian.\nHe is also the writer of the show which recounts the troubles behind the making of Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winner - and the audience can expect a boat-load of laughs including tales of a malfunctioning shark. Running from March 18-22, the Olivier Award-nominated show celebrates a slice of movie history as well as the choppy waters beneath as it takes in the tensions and tempers that famously dogged the 1974 shoot when the lead actors were stuck together on a boat for long periods between scenes.\nIan says of his role and resemblance to his dad: \"It's a funny thing, being there in the dressing room and looking in the mirror before I go on, doing a bit of the famous Indianapolis speech from the film that my late father helped to write, just to make sure that I feel in character.\" For tickets, from £15, see here.\nBilly Elliott turns 20\nIt's been two decades can you believe since the debut of Billy Elliott the Musical - and 25 years since Stephen Daldry's Oscar-nominated film which inspired it - and now Gala Theatre in Durham will be celebrating the occasion which what is described as a 'spectacular theatrical experience'. On March 30 it will screen Billy Elliot the Musical Live, which will bring back together the team behind the much-loved film, set during the eighties Miners Strike, which tells of local lad Billy - played by Jamie Bell - who skives from boxing lessons to learn how to dance.\nNewcastle writer Lee Hall, director Daldry and choreographer Peter Darling also will be joined by the legend Elton John who provided the musical's soundtrack to Hall's lyrics. The 2pm screening on March 30 will be followed by a second showing on April 2 at 7.15pm. For tickets - costing £15; £13 concessions and £10 to Gala members - see here.\nA stylish debut\nAt The Bowes Museum in County Durham, a new exhibition called Joséphine: A Woman of Taste and Fashion will be opening on March 22 for a year-long run which promises a treat. The special display will showcase the textiles acquired by Joséphine Bowes, the museum's co-creator, and which form part of her impressive legacy.\nThe artist and collector built up a real treasure trove, with husband John Bowes, and the lady of the house had a particular interest in contemporary fashion. This new show complements the bigger exhibition From Joséphine Bowes: Trendsetters and Trailblazers which celebrates her achievements in what would have been her 200th year.\nExpect rare surviving pieces from her wardrobe; archive materials and examples of French fashion from the 1850s and 1860s plus opulent embroideries and lace. The dressmakers’ bills on show should be an eye-opener.\nAdding to the exhibits will be hats and pieces by 20th Century designers including Yves Saint Laurent to continue the trend and offer an idea of what patron of the arts Joséphine might have worn had she lived later. She died in 1874 at the age of 49.\nAdmission to the museum is £16 for local resident members; £18 for others or it's £19 for a day ticket, with free entry offered to under-18s, students and carers.

Featuring soloist Henry Hiscock, a natural sciences student at Hatfield College, the programme also will feature works by Wagner, Delius and Marquez. For tickets - £19.80; £17.60 concessions and £13.20 students plus fees - see here.\nA Vera farewell\nThere are just a few tickets left for Vera: End of an Era at the 02 City Hall in Newcastle on March 13 so those interested will have to act quick to bag a seat at this friendly evening get-together which sounds a must for all Vera fans. It will be reuniting award-winning actress Brenda Blethyn, who has announced her retirement from her starring role in the hit ITV series, and writer Ann Cleeves, the creator the much-loved detective.\nThe pair - who, as previously reported, both picked up Outstanding Contribution award at this February's regional Royal Television Society Awards - will be interviewed on stage by TV presenter Steph McGovern and they will reminiscing about all things Vera. For remaining tickets to the 6.30pm event, costing from £28.75 for current re-sales, see here.\nApollo Remastered\nWhen Andy Saunders book of this title came out in 2022, it proved a sensation. Featuring restored photographs from the NASA archives of Apollo missions more than 50 years earlier, it showed details never seen before. Before this, the Apollo images which the public became familiar with over the years - including Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon in 1969 - were taken from lower-quality copies.\nThe original NASA photographic film is stored amid great security in a frozen vault at Johnson Space Center in Houston but it's this that Saunders restored and his painstaking work - and use of cutting-edge techniques - yielded remarkable results. Now an Apollo Remastered exhibition, opening at Queen's Hall Arts Centre in Northumberland on March 30, offers an opportunity for visitors to see some of those enhanced high-definition images for free.\nThey are the highest-quality Apollo photographs ever produced and include scenes of never-before-seen spacewalks; astronauts in their spacecraft and awe-inspiring visions of Earth above the lunar horizon. The exhibition will run in galleries one and two of Queen's Hall until May 30. For more about the venue, a charity, and its programme of work see here.\nWhat's springing up at The Biscuit Factory\nEmbracing spring full-on, the Newcastle gallery will be launching a new headline exhibition this March by an artist from Fife called Fiona Sturrock who is known for her love of bold colour and patterns of light and shade.

The Stoddart Street venue also offers plenty more to look at, with more than 200 collections of original art, craft, jewellery and homewares.\nBook free tickets for the 6pm-8pm launch night here or pop in any other time as it has daily opening.\nDigging Up Newcastle\nImagine it's 4040 and consider what archaeologists might find left over from our world today. That's the premise of this play, Digging Up Newcastle, by writer-director Ian Smith which follows a couple in the future during an excavation of a site full of 21st Century relics.
