  "body_text": "If there is a theme to this year’s Movers and Shapers list, it is the new order taking shape at AFL House as Andrew Dillon settles into his first year as chief executive.\nThe winds of change haven’t just blown through the AFL ... there is a freshness to this year’s list as well.\nSome longstanding familiar names are gone and some fresh faces have joined us. See you later, Gill. Bye-bye, Buddy. And welcome to you, Nick Daicos.\nSee 50-41 HERE.\nSee 40-31 below:\n40. JOHN LONGMIRE\nSydney coach\nLast year: -\nWas at his masterful best last year, dragging an injury-riddled club from 15th on the ladder after round 14 into yet another finals campaign. Leaves no stone unturned in the quest for success, but as the equal longest serving coach in the AFL he offers wisdom and counsel for all in the game, especially north of the Murray.\n39. MATTHEW CHUN\nAFL executive general manager finance, clubs and infrastructure\nLast year: -\nTravis Auld left the AFL last year to run the Australian Grand Prix and given he was in the running to replace Gillon McLachlan until quite late, these were big shoes to fill. Up steps Chun to manage the AFL’s property portfolios, but especially to be the point of contact at the League for the Gabba redevelopment and the proposed Hobart stadium at Battery Point.\n38. BRENDON GALE\nRichmond chief executive officer\nLast year: 6\nMissed out on the AFL CEO position and reportedly knocked back what would have been a clear and powerful No. 2 role at League headquarters. Is committed to the Tigers for a bit longer and will oversee the Punt Road development. But the new Tasmanian team will need a new CEO before long and Gale shapes as the logical choice.\n37. SONJA HOOD\nNorth Melbourne president\nLast year: -\n2023 wasn’t without its challenges for Hood – ill-health for her and her coach Alastair Clarkson, and a season from the men’s team that was barely competitive in large parts. But she led the club with resolve and the foundation for success down the track has been established. The women’s program, of course, is as good as any in the AFL.\n36. CALLUM TWOMEY\nAFL Media journalist\nLast year: 36\nHas no peer when it comes to covering list management in the AFL, both through the trade and draft period. He has helped grow that aspect of game into a year-round content machine. Correctly forecast 27 of the first 29 players to be selected at the 2023 national draft. The industry has come to rely on his intel.\n35. CHRISTIAN PETRACCA\nMelbourne player\nLast year: -\nJust about the most complete player in the competition with his ability to tear games apart through the midfield or as a forward. Is something of a prototype now with rising stars such as North’s Harry Sheezel modelling their game on Petracca.\n34. TIM SILVERS\nAdelaide chief executive officer\nLast year: -\nThe Crows are waking from their slumber on and off the field. Last year’s membership figure of 68,536 was a club record, the long-mooted move from the old Football Park to Thebarton Oval closer to the CBD is set to happen and they should be back playing finals this year. Silvers is quietly but effectively leading this ‘Crow-volution’.\n33. TOBY GREENE\nGWS Giants player\nLast year: -\nFooty’s enfant terrible has morphed into one of the best players in the game and in 2023, its best captain. Greene has embraced his leadership role at the Giants – it has helped his footy - and with Lance Franklin off the scene, has become the game’s leading figure in New South Wales.\n32. CRAIG STARCEVICH\nBrisbane Lions AFLW coach\nLast year: 39\nTwo flags and five Grand Finals in seven completed seasons. Not a bad outcome for a team from a so-called “non-football state”, but Starcevich has done an incredible job of keeping the Lions in contention despite having his playing list pillaged every year, especially by the expansion clubs.\n31. CHRIS SCOTT\nGeelong coach\nLast year: 14\nAnother of the coaching old hands with great line of sight to the decision makers at the AFL. His post-match media conferences are a joy to watch as he leaves breadcrumbs for the assembled journos. Faces an enormous challenge with the Cats in 2024 and while we say it every year, this might be their last chance for some time to play deep into September.",
