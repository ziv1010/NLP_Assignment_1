  "body_text": "Former Canada boss John Herdman has been appointed the new head coach of the Indonesia men’s national team.\nThe appointment marks a return to international coaching for Herdman, 50, who has been out of management since he resigned from his position at Toronto FC in November 2024.\nThe Englishman spent seven years as head coach of the Canada women’s national team, leading the side to a bronze medal at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. He then moved across to the Canada men’s national team, guiding the team to qualification for the 2022 World Cup — the first men’s World Cup Canada had reached since 1986.\nAdvertisement\nThe Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) confirmed Herdman’s arrival on Saturday, citing his “diverse track record” as the “primary reason” for his appointment. The PSSI added his appointment marked “the beginning of a new era for national football”.\nHis first camp with the team will be in March, as Indonesia compete in the FIFA Series in Jakarta.\nHerdman replaces former Barcelona and Netherlands forward Patrick Kluivert in the role, who was dismissed in October following less than a year in charge after Indonesia failed to qualify for the 2026 World Cup. Indonesia have never played at the World Cup since gaining independence in 1945, and reached the knockout stages of the Asian Cup for the first time in 2023, where they were eliminated in the last-16.\nHerdman spent five years in charge of the New Zealand women’s national team, before being appointed by Canada in 2011. His side won successive Olympic bronze medals, including eliminating hosts Great Britain in the quarter-finals of the 2012 London Games, and reached the quarter-finals of the 2015 World Cup on home soil.\nHe made the switch to the men’s side in 2018 and led the team to their first World Cup in 36 years. Canada finished bottom of their group after three defeats at the 2022 tournament in Qatar.\nHerdman joined Major League Soccer side Toronto FC in October 2023, his first senior club head coach role, but departed after just over a year in charge with a record of 16-6-22.\nIn March, he received a written admonishment for his involvement in the Olympic drone-spying scandal that plagued Canada’s campaign at the 2024 Paris Games.\nA report commissioned by Canada Soccer and released in November 2024 said Canada’s “practice of conducting surreptitious surveillance of opponents” predated Paris. The report mentioned Herdman, which led to the disciplinary committee hearing.\nAdvertisement\n‘Herdman could remake his image at Indonesia’\nAnalysis by Joshua Kloke\nAfter flirting with the head coach jobs with the Jamaican and Honduras men’s national teams, Herdman has landed a role that is perfect for him in many ways.\nStaying in international soccer makes sense: he stuttered with the day-to-day duties during his time at Toronto FC. It was a struggle at times for Herdman to find his voice as a manager who had to motivate and connect with players every day, though his roster and poor management were also to blame for a forgettable stint in MLS.\nHerdman is at his best, and valuable to an international program, as a builder and a teacher. Coming into a national team with low expectations but promise and signs of hope is an optimal landing spot, and that’s what Indonesia looks like right now. What Herdman lacked in tactical acumen during his time with Canada’s men’s national team, he more than made up for with an innate ability to create buy-in and interest from the player pool.\nLet’s give credit where it’s due: Herdman is responsible for changing the way Canada’s men’s national team thought about their abilities to qualify for the 2022 World Cup. At the time, the men’s team was fractured. With inventive motivational techniques, he oversaw Canadian players shaking off the perception that they’re afterthoughts in Concacaf. Herdman discovered a multitude of talents and raised the floor for Canada’s national team.\nWhen Herdman took over Canada’s men’s national team, they were ranked 94th by FIFA. At their peak under Herdman, Canada rose to 33rd in the world, which was their highest ranking in the time.\nSome of that is due to Herdman’s ability to use his strong communication skills to persuade dual nationals to join Canada. He also used those same skills to get players who had stepped away from the program – like one of the best players in Canadian history, Atiba Hutchinson – to rejoin.\nAdvertisement\nAll of these qualities could possibly help turn an Indonesia side currently ranked 122nd in the world by FIFA into something different. Look for Herdman to have his hands in every decision the entire program makes. Finding dual nationals across the world to play for Indonesia will be a focus.\nFinally, it’s smart move for Herdman to move to a completely different part of the world. Staying in Concacaf would have seen him consistently hounded by questions about his role in Canada’s drone scandal. In Indonesia, there is the possibility that Herdman can remake his image and remake the image of a struggling national team as well.",
