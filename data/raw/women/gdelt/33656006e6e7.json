In the US, the White House is dealing with pushback against Donald Trump’s plan to slap tariffs on foreign films.\nAustralia\n-\nBatavia rethink | The story of the Batavia shipwreck has long been accepted as the result of one “madman” wreaking terror with rape and murder. But a Dutch academic now argues that it was more complicated than that.\n-\nChinese factor | Labor was helped towards its election win by huge swings of up to 30% from Chinese Australian voters in key marginal seats, bringing warnings from strategists and analysts that the Liberal party has failed to rebuild trust with the community after the harsh anti-Beijing rhetoric of the Morrison era.\n-\nWoman held | A 66-year-old woman is being held in police custody after two children aged six and seven were found dead at a house in Coonabarabran in north-west New South Wales.\n-\nNurses’ fight | The Queensland union movement has warned the state’s conservative government it will be in for a “hell of a bloody fight” if it pursues threats to strip nurses and midwives of back pay if they enact their legal right to strike.\n-\nStellar show | With no moon in the sky this week, Australian stargazers have a good chance to see the annual Eta Aquariids meteor showers as they streak across the sky.\nWorld\n-\nGaza ‘conquest’ | António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, says “countless civilians” would be killed if Israel goes ahead with a new “intensified” offensive in Gaza involving seizure of territory and the displacement of a large part of its population.

First, our number crunchers have been trying to identify the main demographic groups that swung to Labor – and they include urban voters, women, young people and Australians whose first language is not English. One of the most salient lessons from the election is that Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp press no longer has the power to influence elections, writes Margaret Simons, with nothing to show for full-throated editorial support in papers across the country. Another lesson, our environment editor argues, is that there will never be a better chance to strike ahead with more ambitious plan for renewable energy.\nNot the news\nIt’s 41 years since Paul Kelly used the experience of a 13-hour bus journey from Melbourne to Sydney to write the opening line of his celebrated song, From St Kilda to Kings Cross, as he dossed at Don Walker’s house.
