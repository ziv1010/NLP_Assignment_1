Group B guide\n- Published\nCan anyone stop the world champions winning a European crown?\nSpain are in Group B along with neighbours Portugal, Belgium and two-time runners-up Italy.\nAfter defeating England in the 2023 World Cup final, Spain - the highest ranked team at the tournament - are clear favourites to win Euro 2025.\nBut Belgium, Italy and Portugal have taken big steps forward during the last couple of years and will be keen to make a statement against the world champions.\nBBC Sport takes a closer look at the teams.\nBelgium\nManager: Elisabet Gunnarsdottir Nationality: Icelandic Appointed: 2025\nCaptain: Tessa Wullaert Position: Forward Club: Inter Milan\nKey player: Marie Detruyer Position: Midfielder Club: Inter Milan\nForm: Belgium won just one of their qualifying games but they comfortably made it through the play-offs with big wins over Greece and Ukraine.\nThe Red Flames finished third in their Women's Nations League group, which also contained Spain and Portugal. They ended a three-game losing run with an impressive victory over England in April before falling to a heavy 5-1 defeat by Spain in the last international window. However, they ended the campaign with a 3-0 win over Portugal.\nTournament hopes: It's a new era for Belgium. After more than 14 years in charge, long-time boss Ives Serneels was replaced by Icelander Elisabet Gunnarsdottir in January - just seven months before the start of Euros.\nDuring her short reign so far, Belgium have beaten England and pushed Spain close but their success in Switzerland seems to depend heavily on striker Tessa Wullaert, who has shown she can trouble any team's defence.\nItaly\nManager: Andrea Soncin Nationality: Italian Appointed: 2023\nCaptain: Elena Linari Position: Centre-back Club: Roma\nKey player: Manuela Giugliano Position: Midfielder Club: Roma\nForm: Italy may have only won two games in qualifying but they still managed to pip former European champions Netherlands and Norway to the top of their group.\nWith wins against Wales and Denmark in the Nations League, and a draw against Sweden, they head into the Euros on a good run of form.\nTournament hopes: Italy could be the dark horses of Euro 2025. After failing to advance past the group stage at the last World Cup and Euros, Italy have changed managers, with Andre Soncin taking charge and leading their resurgence.\nSince then, the Azurre have defeated top-10 sides Spain, Germany and the Netherlands. However, unable to string a run of two or more wins together, they have struggled for consistency.\nPortugal\nManager: Francisco Neto Nationality: Portuguese Appointed: 2014\nCaptain: Dolores Silva Position: Midfielder Club: Braga\nKey player: Jessica Silva Position: Winger Club: Gotham\nForm: After earning a place in the Euro 2025 play-offs by winning five of their six qualifying games, Portugal booked their ticket to Switzerland with wins over Azerbaijan and the Czech Republic in the play-offs.\nSince then they've held reigning European champions England to a 1-1 draw in the Nations League but the Lionesses hit six past them earlier this month and they also lost to Belgium.\nTournament hopes: In their three previous major tournament appearances, Portugal have never made it past the group stage.\nHowever, they have shown they can compete with the world's best on the biggest stage after holding the USA to a goalless draw at the 2023 World Cup.\nFrancisco Neto's side are boosted by the return of Jessica Silva after the winger recovered from a serious eye injury and Barcelona forward Kika Nazareth, but it is unclear how fit the latter is after she was ruled out for four months in mid-March following ankle surgery.\nSpain\nManager: Montse Tome Nationality: Spanish Appointed: 2023\nCaptain: Irene Paredes Position: Centre-back Club: Barcelona\nKey player: Aitana Bonmati Position: Midfielder Club: Barcelona\nForm: Spain sailed through qualifying by topping their group although they did fall to a surprise defeat by the Czech Republic.\nThey were beaten by Germany and Brazil at the Olympic Games last summer but since then, a narrow 1-0 defeat by England in the Nations League has been their only loss in their last 10 games.\nTournament hopes: Spain are the nailed-on favourites to win the tournament but there are question marks over whether Montse Tome can deliver a major trophy.\nThe former Spain international, who is in her first head coach role, replaced Jorge Vilda amid the sexism scandal involving the then Spanish football federation president Luis Rubiales.\nHowever, Tome has many world-class players at her disposal in Ballon d'Or winners Alexia Putellas and Aitana Bonmati, along with rising stars including Salma Paralluelo and Vicky Lopez.\nRelated topics\n- Published23 June 2025\n- Published23 June 2025\n- Published23 June 2025",
