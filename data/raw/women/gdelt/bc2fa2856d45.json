  "body_text": "Women's League Cup final: Chelsea players 'talk about' quadruple, says Ashley Lawrence\n- Published\nChelsea's players are talking about winning a quadruple this season - but their focus is always on the next game, says defender Ashley Lawrence.\nThe Blues have won the Women's Super League in each of the past four seasons and the FA Cup in the previous three - but could go even further this time.\nThey are through to the semi-finals of the Champions League after beating Ajax over two legs in their last-eight meeting, face Manchester United in the last four of the FA Cup, and the WSL leaders could collect the first trophy of a potential four in the League Cup this weekend.\nArsenal will be aiming to spoil Chelsea's quadruple dreams in the Continental League Cup on Easter Sunday - just as they ruined a potential treble for the Blues by winning the same final, external 3-1 last season.\nEmma Hayes' Chelsea side previously clinched a domestic treble in 2020-21, while in 2007 the Gunners lifted the league, FA Cup and Uefa Women's Cup - as well as the FA Women's Premier League Cup and Community Shield.\nLawrence, 28, says the squad are taking nothing for granted in their quest for the quadruple.\n\"It's always there, we talk about it,\" she told BBC Sport. \"But our focus is on day by day. We work towards the next game, but we are excited to be in this position.\n\"We are aware of the four trophies, Emma and the players who have been here a while know what it takes to win. It's always there, but not the main focus.\"\nChelsea are used to the strain of competing for multiple trophies at once.\nThey played in every match possible to be involved in last season, apart from the Champions League final as they were eliminated at the final-four stage. Hayes' side also reached the FA and League Cup finals and won the WSL.\nIt is new to Lawrence, who joined the club last summer from Paris St-Germain, but the Canadian said the team is ready to cope with a relentless run-in, even if it affects time on the training ground.\n\"We try to take the most important bits and pieces from a game and do better,\" she added. \"If those things are specific and apply to the next game then the staff will focus on those things.\n\"But all season it has been a quick turnaround, playing for four different trophies, and we have just been accustomed to it.\"\n'Hayes has that ultimate belief'\nLawrence, who has 130 caps for Canada, was brought to Chelsea by Hayes last season and has played a utility role for the club amid an injury crisis, deployed wide both in defence and midfield.\nShe admitted working with Hayes was an enormous draw for her to come to the WSL - and has been even more impressed at close quarters.\n\"She was a big part of my decision,\" said Lawrence. \"Everyone in the football world is aware of Emma, and the impact she has had in England and globally.\n\"It was an exciting opportunity to come to this club, for the players, the environment and for her.\n\"She exudes a lot of confidence, even before signing here I saw she has the ability to transform a team into a winning mentality. Now I am here I see she has that ultimate belief, that unwavering confidence. We need that going into finals.\"\nChelsea go into the first of those finals at Molineux as favourites after an impressive 3-1 win over Arsenal in the WSL at Stamford Bridge - a result that all but ruled the Gunners out of the title race.\nArsenal, however, have a good recent record against Chelsea, beating them 4-1 at the Emirates Stadium in the WSL this season, as well as the 2023 League Cup final.\n\"Anything can happen, especially in the final,\" warned Lawrence, who won gold with Canada at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. \"We looked at that last game with confidence, but they are a top team and will come out for the next game different.\n\"It's going to be a level playing field, so we go in with the same conviction, as that was really good from the first whistle. We will not change much but we will be ready.\"\nCORRECTION 30 March 2024: A previous version of this story stated Chelsea were chasing an unprecedented quadruple and that Arsenal were the last team to win a treble in 2007. It has been updated to clarify that Chelsea secured a domestic treble in 2020-21, while Arsenal won four trophies in 2007 as well as the Community Shield.\nDI Humphrey Goodman meets Shipton Abbott: The hit spin-off from Death in Paradise returns!\nThere's a million ways to get it wrong: New York reporter John Wilson presents a superbly strange guide to modern life",
