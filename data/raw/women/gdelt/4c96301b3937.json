European officials told the FT the call did not go well and that Trump was aggressive and confrontational with his Danish counterpart. Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment Friday afternoon via email. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's office said it \"does not recognise the interpretation of the conversation given by anonymous sources\" and pointed Newsweek to Frederiksen's official press release detailing the phone call. -\nCzechia considers return centers to assist Ukrainian refugees\nCzechia may establish return centers to help Ukrainian refugees who fled the war to return home, according to the Ministry of the Interior. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov will discuss the initiative during his visit to the country next week, as reported by Deník N. Similar centers are being prepared in Berlin, and Ukraine is also negotiating such projects with Poland. These centers aim to assist Ukrainians with the logistics of returning while also serving as cultural and community hubs. Chernyshov recently noted that most returning refugees could be exempt from military mobilization and said Ukraine is prepared to... -\nWhite House says mostly empty DC offices are a 'national embarrassment' in memo about federal RTO mandate\nThe White House's Office of Personnel Management did not mince words when addressing agency heads in a memo outlining the next steps for federal workers' return to office. \"Federal office buildings sit mostly empty, particularly Washington, D.C.-area agency headquarters offices, devastating the local economy and serving as a national embarrassment,\" Charles Ezell, the acting director of the OPM, said in the Wednesday memo. Ezell added that \"virtually unrestricted telework\" has led to \"poorer government services\" and also hampered departments' ability to train and supervise workers. The OPM defines telework as an arrangement in which employees are expected to report to... -\nTusk Threatens Orban with Consequences if EU Sanctions Against Russia Not Extended\nPolish Prime Minister also said his Hungarian counterpart \"is playing in Putin’s team\"MOSCOW, January 25. /TASS/. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk threatened his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban with consequences if he vetoes the extension of sanctions against Russia. \"If Prime Minister Viktor Orban really blocks European sanctions at a key moment for the war, it’ll be absolutely clear that in this big game for the security and future of Europe, he is playing in [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s team, not in ours. With all the consequences of this fact,\" he wrote on X. On January 24, Orban demanded that, ahead... -\nThe only person in the world with a functioning pig organ is thriving after a record 2 months\nAn Alabama woman passed a major milestone Saturday to become the longest living recipient of a pig organ transplant – healthy and full of energy with her new kidney for 61 days and counting. ... Looney’s vibrant recovery is a morale boost in the quest to make animal-to-human transplants a reality. Only four other Americans have received hugely experimental transplants of gene-edited pig organs – two hearts and two kidneys – and none lived more than two months. Montgomery called Looney’s kidney function “absolutely normal.” Doctors hope she can leave New York – where she’s temporarily living for post-transplant checkups... -\nCatholic Caucus: Daily Mass Readings 25-January-2025\nSaturday 25 January 2025The Conversion of Saint Paul, Apostle FeastSan Mauro La Bruca, church of Sant'Eufemia; altar with the relics of St. Mauro AbbotReadings at MassLiturgical Colour: White.

Many homes and buildings in California feature vented attics and this significantly exacerbated the intensity and spread of the 2025 wildfires. This isn't just a California problem, this is anywhere that is prone to wildfires. Unvented conditioned attic assemblies are significantly safer in wildfire zones, as they do not allow outside air or embers to enter the roof assembly. In this video, we discuss why vented attics... -\nAlex Marlow: Follow the Money—NFL Rigging Playoffs for the Chiefs So Taylor Swift Will Attend Super Bowl\nOn Friday’s “Alex Marlow Show,” host and Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow talked about the NFL playoffs.Marlow said, “You guys know the NFL just rigs it for the Chiefs, right? Because they need to have Taylor Swift at the Super Bowl. … [T]hat does seem real, right? … I don’t follow sportsball that close. I haven’t watched any football this year, I don’t think. … I’ve seen some of the calls.” -\nWest Coast, Messed Coast™: Any L.A. Bailout Money Must Be Accompanied by a Pirate With a Green Eyeshade\nGavin Newsom can't be trusted with billions in bail-out money for the torched neighborhoods of Los Angeles. That much is obvious to your humble West Coast, Messed Coast™ correspondent. That's what you call a cold open to this week's West Coast, Messed Coast™, report where I've been keeping close track of the fire response. Gavin Newsom and his minions in public office — especially L.A. Mayor Karen Bass — can't be trusted to properly account for what will be a years-long effort to rebuild the charred parts of L.A. County. The governor who lost or misspent BILLIONS OF DOLLARS in... -\nThe Decline and Fall of the US Senate\nThe time I’ve spent watching Democrat senators during the ongoing confirmation hearings for President Trump’s nominees has been beyond tiresome. snip So should we have term limits in the Senate? The Senate is clearly a mess, and it seems pretty much dysfunctional. But how did we arrive at this point? Was it caused by a defect in the Constitution? Not at all. The Founders intended that senators be appointed by their respective state legislatures. It was never intended that senators be politicians, elected by the voters. They weren’t until 1913, when the 17th Amendment was ratified. How has that change... -\n75 Years Ago, a Seminal Event in the History of Modern Conservatism\nThe Depression of the 1930s was more than an economic crisis. All of American society was upended, as economically hard times forced people to question their deepest beliefs about America and the American experiment. Perhaps capitalism wasn't the way to a better society. Millions of intellectuals and ordinary people toyed with the idea that Communism may be a viable alternative economic and social model. This was before the horrors of Joseph Stalin and Soviet Communism were exposed and Communism discredited. America's left-wing intelligentsia embraced Communism. The Soviet Union's fight against Nazi Germany, supported enthusiastically by American Communists, blinded many of... -\nTrump administration tests the power to email every federal employee at once\nThe new feature, announced by the Office of Personnel Management, aligns with the goals of DOGE.WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s administration is testing a new capability that would allow officials to email the entire federal government workforce from a single email address, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said in a statement Friday.The new capability could allow Trump to communicate directly with millions of federal workers across dozens of agencies simultaneously, with a single click of a mouse.The White House declined to comment.The effort aligns with the government modernization goals of the new Department of Government Efficiency, headed by tech... -\nTrump Made a Big Move Against the Deep State\nIn a decisive move that has sent shockwaves through the political elite in Washington, President Trump has dismissed 17 inspectors general. “The inspectors general were dismissed via emails from the White House Presidential Personnel Office, with no notice sent to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who have pledged bipartisan support for the watchdogs, in advance of the firings, the person said,” reports Politico. “The emails gave no substantive explanation for the dismissals, with at least one citing ‘changing priorities’ for the move, the person added.” Trump’s brazen move provides an early test for Congress, less than a week into Trump’s return... -\nPresident Trump Absolutely Destroys Democrat Rep. Brad Sherman in a Fiery Spat Over FEMA\nPresident Donald Trump dismantled Democrat Representative Brad Sherman’s defense of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), arguing that state governments, not federal bureaucracy, should take matters into their own hands rather than waiting for federal incompetence. President Trump did not mince words about FEMA’s shortcomings during a press conference on Friday with Los Angeles officials after touring the damage caused by the wildfires. Pres. Trump: I do have to say FEMA is a big disappointment. We had it working well. We had great people, but FEMA is not good anymore. What FEMA did in North Carolina. They still haven’t even... -\nFlorida man arrested for allegedly making ‘violent’ threats against President Trump\nA Florida man has been arrested for making “violent” threats against President Trump, police said. Shannon Depararro Atkins allegedly made posts on social media targeting the Commander-in-Chief. Atkins, 46, was arrested just before 7:30 p.m. Friday during a traffic stop in West Palm Beach — where he was allegedly found with cocaine, cops said. Authorities arrested Atkins after a tip, and the West Palm Beach man allegedly admitted making the “violent posts,” authorities said. “America needs one good bullet to be saved,” Atkins allegedly wrote on Facebook on Jan. 19, a day before Trump was inaugurated for his second term.... -\nMel Gibson: I’m glad Trump is here.

It’s like daddy arrived and he’s taking his belt off -\n[Catholic Caucus] A 'female cardinal' at the head of the Governorate? Francis on Italian TV announces other 'epochal' changes.\n[Catholic Caucus] A 'female cardinal' at the head of the Governorate? Francis on Italian TV announces other 'epochal' changes.A female Cardinal? Well, we're getting there... Pope Francis announced that Sister Raffaella Petrini, the current Secretary General of the Governorate of Vatican City State, will assume the role of President starting in March 2025, replacing Cardinal Fernando Vérgez Alzaga. However, the Pope's own promulgated rule states that only a Cardinal can be President of the Governate... further amendments may be necessary. \"Women handle problems better than men,\" said the Pope, riding one of the most painful clichés.On Sunday, January 19, 2025,... -\n'God forbid we should end up like Ukraine': Belarusians indifferent to election\nThere are times in history when countries are gripped by election fever. January 2025 in Belarus is not one of them. Drive around Minsk and you'll see no big billboards promoting the portraits of candidates. There is little campaigning. The grey skies and sleet of a Belarusian winter add to an overriding sense of inactivity. And inevitability. The outcome of the 2025 presidential election is not in doubt. Alexander Lukashenko, once dubbed \"Europe's last dictator,\" who has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for more than 30 years, will be declared the winner and secure a seventh term in office.... -\nWhere the Popes Are Buried\nPope Francis’ announcement this week [Dec 2023] that he wants to be buried at the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome leads to a question: Where are his predecessors? If you guessed St. Peter’s Basilica … there’s a good chance you’re right. Pope Francis cites his devotion to Mary the Mother of Jesus and his frequent visits (both as pope and before) to the basilica dedicated in her honor, which is a little less than 2 1/2 miles east of St. Peter’s. If Pope Francis is buried at the Basilica of St. Mary Major, he won’t be alone. Six...\nBrowse by Forum\nGet Connected! Join Free Republic Today!\nAlready a Member?
