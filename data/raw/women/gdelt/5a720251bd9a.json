  "body_text": "THE HAGUE, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany beat the Netherlands 2-0 to become the last of the three European teams in the women's football tournament at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games on Wednesday.\nThe third-place play-off in the Nations League was the last chance for the two teams to qualify for Paris 2024. Spain captured a ticket last Friday by defeating the Netherlands 3-0 in Seville in the semifinals of the tournament, while France, already assured an Olympic spot as the host, beat Germany 2-1.\nThe crucial match was hosted in Heerenveen, within the northern province of Friesland, providing the Netherlands a home advantage. Yet, the Dutch team was hampered by the absence of key players Jill Roord, Vivianne Miedema, and Victoria Pelova due to injuries.\nGermany had the best chance in the first half, as Chelsea player Sjoeke Nusken came close when she hit the post in the 25th minute.\nThe Germans also gained the upper hand in the second half. A goal by substitute Lea Schuller was disallowed for offside and Dutch goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar had to make some saves to keep a clean sheet.\nKlara Buhl opened the scoring for Germany at the far post in the 67th minute, and Germany doubled the lead through Schuller's header 11 minutes later.\nFollowing this win, Germany joins Spain, who clinched the Nations League title by defeating France 2-0, and the host nation France, as the three European representatives in the Olympic women's football tournament. ■",
