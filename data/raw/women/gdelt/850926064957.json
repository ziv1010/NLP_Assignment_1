  "body_text": "Tom Cleverley’s first season at Argyle has reached its midpoint (Image: Dave Rowntree/PPAUK)\nPlymouth Argyle have now played just over half (25 of 46) of their Sky Bet League One matches this season and, with their away fixture at Wigan Athletic postponed this weekend, The Moorlander is giving the Greens their report card so far.\nWhere have the Pilgrims excelled, and where is there still room for improvement? We have broken the 2025/26 campaign down into five key areas, assigning a grade and feedback for each.\nREAD NEXT: Plymouth roadworks update as major routes in the city face closures and delays\nThe League: Grade D\nStarting with the obvious, it has been a disappointing first half of the season in League One.\nFollowing relegation from the Championship, the departure of manager Miron Muslic, and the loss of key players such as forward Ryan Hardie, midfielder Adam Randell and defender Maksym Talovierov during the summer, many fans were under no illusions that an immediate return to the second tier would be difficult.\nFormer Manchester United midfielder and Watford coach Tom Cleverley arrived as the club’s sixth permanent manager in as many years, and supporters were divided over the young head coach’s brand of football and relative lack of experience at this level.\nA torrid start saw Argyle lose all four of their opening League One fixtures, before finally breaking the duck with a one goal home victory over Blackpool at the end of August.\nSeptember proved kinder for Cleverley’s side, with just one defeat, but the next two months marked the toughest period of his coaching career to date.\nFour games yielded only two goals and three defeats in October, with the most painful being a flat two-goal loss to Devon rivals Exeter City, who regained bragging rights for the first time in three years.\nABOVE: The Devon Derby defeat was a particular low for Cleverley's Greens (Image: Tom Sandberg/PPAUK)\nNovember brought further frustration, with Argyle’s sole victory in a five-game month coming via a goal from in-form ex-Port Vale striker Lorent Tolaj against his old club.\nWith sections of the fanbase calling for Cleverley’s dismissal, a run of four wins in five matches signalled an upturn in form, helped by players returning from injury and a broader spread of goals throughout the squad.\nAt the time of writing, Argyle sit 16th in the League One table, three points above the relegation zone and nine points adrift of the play-offs, having lost just two of their last nine games.\nOverall, The Moorlander awards ‘The League’ a Grade D. It would be unfair to write off Cleverley or Argyle at this stage, but mixed performances and the continued proximity to the drop zone have limited how high this grade can go.\nHowever, if recent form is anything to go by, the season may finally be turning.\nThe Cups: Grade C\nAmid the league turbulence, the Pilgrims have competed in three cup competitions this season.\nIn the EFL Cup, Argyle reached the second round. A rotated side overturned a three-goal deficit at home to QPR in mid-August, scoring three times in 30 minutes to eliminate the Championship outfit.\nA tough second-round trip to Swansea followed, with the hosts striking early, but Brendan Wiredu’s equaliser just before half-time forcing penalties after a competitive contest.\nArgyle eventually exited after a 5-3 defeat on spot-kicks, having delivered a spirited display.\nThere would be no repeat of last season’s FA Cup heroics, however, as a subdued performance away to Wycombe Wanderers saw Argyle eliminated at the first-round stage, registering just one shot on target.\nMore encouragingly, Argyle have enjoyed a solid EFL Trophy campaign, with victories over Cheltenham Town and Tottenham Hotspur Under-21s securing qualification from the group.\nA late error from goalkeeper Luca Ashby-Hammond in a 1-0 defeat away at Bristol Rovers consigned Argyle to an away draw in round two against Leyton Orient, where they snatched a last-minute winner of their own to progress.\nABOVE: Goal celebrations following Tolaj's winner at Leyton Orient (Image: Alan Stanford/PPAUK)\nThey were then drawn away once more, setting up a chance for redemption against Bristol Rovers.\nOverall, The Moorlander gives ‘The Cups’ a Grade C. The EFL Trophy has provided welcome relief from league struggles, though a flat FA Cup exit limits the score following last season’s memorable wins over Brentford and Liverpool.\nREAD NEXT: What’s on at Newton Abbot Museum this February? Folk music fundraiser revealed\nTransfers: Grade C\nArgyle oversaw a busy but measured summer transfer window as the squad was reshaped for a new league and a new head coach.\nAugust’s standout signing was striker Lorent Tolaj, who arrived from Port Vale for around £1.2m.\nThe 23-year-old has proven an astute acquisition, emerging as League One’s top scorer with 12 goals.\nOther permanent signings included Aribim Pepple (around £300,000), Bradley Ibrahim (approximately £300,000), Brendan Wiredu (around £300,000) and Owen Oseni (about £70,000).\nFree transfers Jamie Paterson, Mathias Ross, Xavier Amaechi and Jack MacKenzie added experience and depth, while loan arrivals Alex Mitchell, Owen Dale and Law McCabe bolstered squad numbers.\nABOVE: Forwards Owen Oseni and Jamie Patterson both joined Argyle in the summer (Image: Alan Stanford/PPAUK)\nIn contrast, Argyle generated more income than they spent. Maksym Taloverov joined Stoke City for roughly £2m, Adam Randell moved to Bristol City for around £860,000, Ryan Hardie signed for Wrexham for approximately £700,000, and goalkeeper Daniel Grimshaw joined Norwich City in a deal close to £690,000.\nOverall, The Moorlander awards ‘Transfers’ a Grade C. While departures were difficult to replace, Tolaj has been outstanding, Mitchell has impressed at the back, and there have been flashes of promise elsewhere.\nThe January window will be pivotal, particularly in wing-back and central midfield areas, with speculation also surrounding the goalkeeper position.\nAttendance: Grade B\nThe Green Army has long been central to Argyle’s identity, both home and away.\nFollowing relegation, a drop in numbers was expected, yet Argyle have still averaged 13,686 supporters at Home Park this season. While down from last year’s 16,400, this remains impressive given inconsistent form.\nAway support has also stayed strong, with sell-outs at fixtures including Luton, Exeter and Stevenage.\nABOVE: Bradley Ibrahim celebrates with the travelling support at Luton (Image: Tom Cusden/PPAUK)\nOverall, The Moorlander gives ‘Attendances’ a Grade B. Home Park remains one of the best-supported grounds in League One, ranking fifth overall for average attendance.\nOff the Pitch: Grade B\nOff the pitch, Argyle have remained active and stable. Tom Cleverley was appointed on a three-year deal in the summer, and in November the club brought back former manager Derek Adams as Director of Football.\nAdams’ role is strategic, supporting Cleverley and head of football operations David Fox rather than being directly involved in coaching.\nABOVE: David Fox and Simon Hallett before the Stockport victory (Image: Dave Rowntree/PPAUK)\nChairman Simon Hallett continues to oversee long-term planning and investment, including infrastructure and community projects.\nA major development this season has been the ongoing transformation of Foulston Park.\nREAD NEXT: Plymouth and Dartmoor bus concerns raised as Devon MP presses Government and Stagecoach\nThe former Brickfields site is being redeveloped into a community sports hub, with a new dual-use 3G pitch completed in November 2025 to support Argyle Women, youth teams and local sport.\nOverall, The Moorlander gives ‘Off the Pitch’ a Grade B. The board’s decision to stick with Cleverley may yet pay off and Adams’ return adds experience, with Hallett continuing to back the club financially.\nPlayer of the Season (so far)\nThere is only one choice for The Moorlander’s Player of the Season to date: Swiss forward Lorent Tolaj.\nAs League One’s leading scorer, contributing to more than half of Argyle’s league goals, the striker has filled the void left by Ryan Hardie superbly.\nABOVE: Lorent Tolaj scored the winner against his old team Port Vale (Image: George Wass/PPAUK)\nHonourable mentions go to centre-back Alex Mitchell, a defensive mainstay, and midfielder Joe Ralls, whose experience has made a noticeable impact in a short spell.\nConclusion\nPlymouth Argyle’s season so far has been a familiar rollercoaster for the Green Army.\nEye-catching wins against Stockport County and Doncaster Rovers have been offset by heavy defeats to Reading and Cardiff City, leaving supporters unsure which version of Argyle will appear each week.\nWith the January transfer window approaching, Cleverley and Adams face crucial decisions as they look to strengthen the squad and trim where necessary for the run-in.\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nSubscribe or register today to discover more from DonegalLive.ie\nBuy the e-paper of the Donegal Democrat, Donegal People's Press, Donegal Post and Inish Times here for instant access to Donegal's premier news titles.\nKeep up with the latest news from Donegal with our daily newsletter featuring the most important stories of the day delivered to your inbox every evening at 5pm.",
