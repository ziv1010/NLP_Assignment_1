  "body_text": "Former Longtime Alabama Assistant Returning to Coaching Softball\nFormer Alabama longtime assistant coach Alyson Habetz retired from college softball in August 2023 after spending the previous 25 years as a member of Patrick Murphy's coaching staff.\nThe coaching itch is one that is hard to get rid of, as it's possible Coach Saban is in the process of trying to figure out how to scratch in retirement.\nCoach Habetz realized retirement might not be the best fit for her yet, and is set to return to her alma mater, the Louisiana Rajin Cajuns, as their head softball coach for the 2024 season.\nShe was hired by the Crimson Tide in 1998, to command the Tide's outfielders and team offense. She was promoted to associate head coach in 2007, a title she held until her retirement in 2023.\nDuring her time at Alabama, Habetz helped lead the Crimson Tide to 14 Women's College World Series appearances and 11 SEC titles.\nHabetz played both basketball and softball for Louisiana, which was known as the University of Southwestern Louisiana at the time.\nDuring her playing years, she helped lead the Cajuns to a Women's College World Series appearance in 1993. She was inducted into the University of Louisiana at Lafayette’s Sports Hall of Fame in 2003.\nIn a press release on Tuesday, Habetz said, “I am honored and extremely grateful for the opportunity that Dr. Savoie and Dr. Maggard have provided to lead one of the premiere softball programs in the country at a place I call home, the University of Louisiana. This is where my softball journey began and my love for the Ragin’ Cajuns program, its fans, and the community runs deep.”\nGerry Glasco was the head coach for Louisiana in 2023 but accepted the head coaching job at Texas Tech after the season. Louisiana went 45-19 in the regular season, including a Sun Belt regular season championship with a 22-2 conference record.\nSport Your Favorite Sports Station with Exclusive Tide 100.9 Gear\nGallery Credit: Threadless, TSM\nPhotos of the Construction of the new UA Golf Facility\nGallery Credit: Simon Besnoy\nAlabama's 2024 A-Day\nGallery Credit: Wyatt Fulton\nCrimson Tide's NFL Draft First-Rounders During Saban's Tenure\nGallery Credit: Jacob Harrison\nAlabama Football 2024 Pro Day\nGallery Credit: Wyatt Fulton",
