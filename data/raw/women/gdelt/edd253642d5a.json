Barcelona and Arsenal win big\nManchester City and Bayern Munich stayed perfect in the Women’s Champions League halfway through the group stage on Tuesday, while two-time defending champion Barcelona and Arsenal recorded big wins.\nCity leads Group D with nine points after the English league leader beat Hammarby 2-0 at home. Barcelona is second, trailing by three points, followed by Hammarby on three and St. Pölten without a point.\nBarcelona earlier thrashed St. Pölten 7-0. Claudia Pina led the demolition with two goals. It followed another massive win for Barcelona, 9-0 over Hammarby in the previous round.\nArsenal is recovering from a poor start to the season, scoring four goals in the second straight game in the competition as it won 4-0 at Juventus.\nThe Gunners are second in Group C with six points, three behind leader Bayern, which eased past pointless newcomer Vålerenga 3-0. Juventus has three points.\nGoal feast\nIt took Barcelona 32 minutes to break the deadlock\nOna Batlle crossed from the left for Ewa Pajor to net the opener from close range. Then another four goals came within seven minutes as Barcelona was rewarded for its dominance.\nFrancisca Nazareth scored in the 38th minute, slotting home a loose ball. Aitana Bonmatí made it 3-0 on a rebound after Carina Schlüter parried a fierce drive by Vicky Lopez.\nKeira Walsh’s clinical finish from outside the area and Pina’s volley for her first made it 5-0 at halftime.\nPina added her second from the spot after the interval before Caroline Graham Hansen finished it off.\nArsenal back on track\nLed by interim head coach Renée Slegers, Arsenal continues to recover from its 5-2 loss to Bayern in the opening round and earlier poor form in its domestic league.\nBoosted by a 5-0 victory over Brighton in the Women’s Super League on Friday, the Gunners showed the same ruthlessness in Europe.\nFrida Maanum put Arsenal ahead late in the first half against Juve, a team which dominates the Italian league. Late goals from two substitutes, Stina Blackstenius and Mariona Caldentey, put the result beyond doubt before Caitlin Foord finished off the emphatic win.\nHarder on target again for Bayern\nPernille Harder found the back of the net again for Bayern. The Denmark veteran headed in the opener early in the game for her fifth goal of the campaign to remain the competition’s top scorer this season.\nMany more goals looked inevitable but only two came despite numerous chances.\nGiulia Gwinn doubled the advantage from the spot in the 17th minute, sending goalkeeper Tove Enblom the wrong way.\nSarah Zadrazil added the third with a looping shot in second-half stoppage time.\nSecond-half goals for City\nWithout injured star signing Vivianne Miedema, City was held at bay by the visitors in the first half.\nThe 28-year-old Netherlands forward had another operation on her troublesome left knee last month, and it’s not clear when she might be able to return.\nThe first goal came soon after the interval from midfielder Laura Blindkilde Brown, who joined City from Aston Villa in January.\nForward Aoba Fujino made it 2-0 with a header 10 minutes from time.\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",
