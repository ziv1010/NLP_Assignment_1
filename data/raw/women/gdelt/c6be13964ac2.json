  "body_text": "One loss and one win: a roundup of the Lionesses’ international break\nEngland’s October international break featured two friendlies for the Lionesses as they continued their preparations for Euro 2025.\nSarina Wiegman’s side faced Germany at Wembley on October 25 in what was a repeat of the Euro 2022 final.\nDespite missing star player Lauren James, England could field a strong starting eleven that included recently-crowned Player of the Year Alessia Russo alongside stalwarts Kiera Walsh, Millie Bright, and Lucy Bronze. Hannah Hampton continued to be preferred to Mary Earps in goal.\nAfter a matter of minutes, a poor loss of possession from captain Leah Williamson and a foul from Bright gifted Germany a penalty, which captain Giulia Gwinn powered into the back of Hampton’s net.\nEngland were offered a lifeline when awarded a penalty for handball after a VAR review and Georgia Stanway stepped up to get England on the scoresheet\nEngland thought they’d equalised through Russo, but her former club teammate Ella Toone was offside in the build-up. Gwinn scored her second two minutes later, a drilled shot in off the post, after more lacklustre defending from England.\nRusso again came close, hitting the post, but in the 29th minute Germany scored their third. A fast break saw Klara Bühl pick up the ball on the left-hand side before taking on Bronze. Her low shot had enough power to frustratingly beat Hampton at her near post. This meant that after just half an hour in London, Germany had raced to a three-nil lead over a pitiful England.\nEngland were offered a lifeline when awarded a penalty for handball after a VAR review and Georgia Stanway stepped up to get England on the scoresheet. The 50,000 England fans celebrated again three minutes later, when Stanway scored again putting England within touching\ndistance. Toone looked sure to equalise five minutes later when Germany lost possession, but her shot was agonisingly wide.\nGoing into the second half, England still lacked a proper grip in the game; Germany’s fourth came after thirty minutes, England failed to clear a free kick, Russo eventually conceded a penalty though England felt the decision was harsh. Sara Dabritz scored this third penalty of the game with ease, making it 4-2 with under twenty minutes left.\nFour of England’s six losses under Wiegman have now come since the World Cup Final against Spain last August\nOn the 81st minute, Germany similarly failed to deal with a free kick, the ball finding Bronze in the box, who halved England’s deficit. England pushed for an equaliser in the latter stages, but ultimately fell short.\nFour of England’s six losses under Wiegman have now come since the World Cup Final against Spain last August. This was also the first game under her stewardship in which England have conceded four times.\nOn Oct 29, England lined up to face South Africa in Coventry. Seven changes meant starts for Kelly, Earps, and youngsters Naz, Clinton, Park, Morgan and Le Tissier. Captain Williamson was given another chance in defence, partnering with Alex Greenwood.\nEngland dominated possession in the early stages and opened the scoring twelve minutes in. Williamson marked her 50th cap for England with a calm finish from the edge of the box that offered some redemption for her poor performance against Germany.\nClinton proved the difference-maker in both boxes, scoring England’s second goal twenty-three minutes in\nSouth Africa soon came close to equalising: Hildah Magaia’s attempt was cleared off the line by Clinton.\nClinton proved the difference-maker in both boxes, scoring England’s second goal twenty-three minutes in. Wiegman’s changes proved fruitful: Le Tissier’s cross was met by Clinton’s powerful header.\nEngland’s defensive frailties continued, with their loose passes lucky not to be punished. South Africa eventually took advantage ten minutes into the second half. Thembi Kgatlana raced past Greenwood after Williamson’s give-away to halve the deficit and score South\nAfrica’s first ever goal against England in women’s football.\nEngland also proved vulnerable to long balls over their back line. South Africa found themselves in behind England on multiple occasions: a two-on-one wasn’t converted, the ball was in the back of the net but offside, and Earps produced a fine one-on-one save.\nEngland’s success won’t be determined by these friendlies, but ultimately by their Euros campaign next summer\nEngland had the chance to restore their two-goal lead eighty minutes in, when Toone’s volley was saved by half-time substitute Andile Dlamini. Russo’s lung-busting run five minutes later was ended by a cynical foul that was checked but cleared by VAR for a potential red card.\nEngland were able to hold on to win 2-1, but questions over England’s defence remain, such as why they were frequently out-muscled and out-ran by South Africa’s forwards. Clinton provided some much-needed optimism and seems most likely to push for a starting place\nmoving forward.\nHaving lacked the dominance many expected from them during the World Cup, England’s worsening form since the final has provided little respite from criticism. Their victories are getting narrower, their defeats more frequent. Their success won’t be determined by these friendlies, but ultimately by their Euros campaign next summer.",
