  "body_text": "Women’s Champions League matchday 6 predictions\n- The final round of UEFA Women’s Champions League group stage matches will be played this week\n- Seven of the eight possible teams have already qualified for quarter-finals\n- Chelsea, Barcelona, Arsenal and Manchester City are among them\nThe 2024/25 UEFA Women's Champions League group stage will draw to a close this week as the final round of fixtures takes place.\nAlmost every single group is already decided, with Lyon, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Arsenal, Manchester City and Barcelona among those already mathematically qualified. It could produce some interesting results with little on the line in the majority of fixtures.\nThe quarter-final and semi-final draw will take place on February 7 in Nyon, with the first round of knockout games scheduled for mid-March. The semi-finals will take place in April, followed by the final at the Estadio Jose Alvalade in Lisbon at the end of May.\nBut first, the group stage must conclude, so 90min have predicted every matchday six result...\nFC Twente vs Celtic\nNeither of these teams will qualify for the knockout rounds as they sit on three and zero points respectively. The last meeting ended in a 2-0 win for FC Twente away from home, so they will be hoping for a similar result this time around.\nFor Celtic, it’s certainly been an eye opening Champions League campaign. But, after five defeats, they will be desperate to go out on a good note and record at least one victory. Given they’re away from home on this occasion, that may be too tall an order.\nPrediction: FC Twente 3-1 Celtic\nReal Madrid vs Chelsea\nAt the other end of group B, Chelsea and Real Madrid have already booked their places in the quarter-finals. Sonia Bompastor's side narrowly won the previous meeting, but Chelsea showed glimpses of vulnerability in their 1-1 draw away at Leicester City in the WSL over the weekend.\nThe Spanish side have won their last four games across all competitions, and their only defeat in their last ten came against Barcelona. They will be full of confidence ahead of Tuesday’s meeting and will hope to cause an upset to claim top spot in the group.\nPrediction: Real Madrid 2-1 Chelsea\nLyon vs Wolfsburg\nFrench side Lyon are comfortably top of group A and have already qualified for the quarter-finals. Wolfsburg, on the other hand, are the likeliest to progress in second due to the significant goal difference swing needed to see Roma progress.\nLyon won the last meeting between these two teams 2-0, so a similar result can be expected this time around. Joe Montemurro’s side also have the home advantage, which should work in their favour.\nPrediction: Lyon 3-2 Wolfsburg\nRoma vs Galatasaray\nAS Roma's hopes of qualifying for the knockout stage of this year's Champions League are extremely thin. While they are likely to run out comfortable winners against Galatasaray on Tuesday night, they need a significant goal difference swing of 17, which is extremely unlikely with just one game to go.\nLast time out against the Turkish side, Roma were comfortable 6-1 winners. Unfortunately, big scorelines in their favour in both group A games are unlikely to be enough to see them through.\nPrediction: Roma 6-0 Galatasaray\nSt Polten vs Hammarby\nBoth of these teams have no chance of qualifying for the quarter-finals, but will be determined to end their Champions League campaigns on a positive note. Hammarby edged the last meeting 2-0, but this time St Polten have the home advantage.\nThat being said, the Austrian side are yet to pick up any points in the competition this season. While it may be a close game, the visitors are likely to narrowly come out on top.\nPrediction: St Polten 1-2 Hammarby\nBarcelona vs Manchester City\nManchester City shocked the football world in October with a 2-0 win at home to Barcelona to kick off the group stage competition. However, the Catalan giants have an opportunity to claim top spot in group D with a victory on Wednesday evening due to their far superior goal difference.\nGareth Taylor’s side have suffered a number of high profile injuries, including to the likes of Lauren Hemp, Vivianne Miedema, Khadija Shaw and Alex Greenwood. They will also be rocked by the weekend's defeat to Everton in the WSL, so it's difficult to see them getting another one over Barcelona.\nPrediction: Barcelona 3-0 Manchester City\nJuventus vs Valerenga\nGroup C is already decided, regardless of what happens this week. For Juventus, they will simply want to end the year on a positive note ahead of the winter break.\nThe same can be said for Valerenga, who have accumulated just a single point from their campaign so far. The Italian club won the first meeting 1-0 back in October, and are capable of achieving a similar result this time around.\nPrediction: Juventus 2-0 Valerenga\nArsenal vs Bayern Munich\nArsenal are a different side to the one that was comfortably beaten 5-2 by Bayern Munich on the opening matchday. They have undergone a managerial change, with Renee Slegers still in charge on an interim basis, and their form has drastically improved.\nWith little to play for, apart from top spot in group C, it's unlikely there will be a repeat of the scoreline back in October. This will be a tougher test for Bayern, but it wouldn't be surprising if there is little to separate the two teams.",
