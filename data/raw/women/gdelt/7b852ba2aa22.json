Saturday will mark the 20th meeting between the two teams and the US have won 12, drawn two and lost five of their previous 19 matches against England.\nHoran, who currently plays her club football in Europe with French side Lyon, didn't go as far as saying there is a fierce rivalry between the two nations, but these games are always competitive and the calibre of fixture they want to play in.\n\"I don't know if rivalry is the right word,\" she said in a media conference on Friday. \"But, we get to face a top opponent in the women's game.\n\"There's no easy game, even coming off the last camp that we played, the teams we got to play had such difficulty for us in certain scenarios. Now we get to play against England in a world class stadium, and a legendary stadium. It's incredible.\n\"For us, as players, we're competitors and these are the games we thrive in. The pressure moments. It's got to be one of the most entertaining games for people to see.\"\nSaturday's showdown represents the first time new manager Emma Hayes will take on her home nation as head coach of the USWNT. She took charge following her departure from WSL side Chelsea at the end of last season and was successful at her first attempt as she guided them to Olympic glory back in August.\nHayes echoed the sentiment that these are the games everyone wants to be involved in. After Saturday's clash in London, her side will travel to face the Netherlands in The Hague next week.\n\"When you've got an opportunity to lead the team at Wembley against a top side in England, these are the games we want to be [involved] in, against top opposition,\" Hayes added.\n\"For each and every one of us, this is why we go to work. Hopefully it will be a fabulous game. I know both coaches will want that.\n\"We've had a good training week and we're pleased with the direction we're going in. We're looking forward to it.\"\nHaving coached in England with Chelsea for more than a decade, Hayes is not only familiar with most of the players who will be lining up in Sarina Wiegman's team on Saturday, but also well acquainted with the Lionesses' style of play.\n\"There is [challenges] against every opponent,\" Hayes added. \"That's the interesting thing about international football, there's so many differences between teams.\n\"I'm very familiar with England and their style of play. Like I said, I think it will be a top tactical match up and there is a lot of quality players.\n\"I don't think there's anything that separates England from anything we've faced before. We faced Germany in the summer, Japan, Brazil. I don't think it's anything new for us.\"",
