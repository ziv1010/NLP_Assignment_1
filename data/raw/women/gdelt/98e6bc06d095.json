Last season, it was just the final group game played there, before then staging home legs of both the quarter-final and semi-final.\nShould Chelsea progress to the knockout rounds again, it would be expected that any home legs would again be played at Stamford Bridge, potentially meaning up to nine games in total across all competitions over the course of the season. There could potentially still be scope for even more in other competitions too depending on fixtures in the FA Cup or Conti Cup.\nREAD THE LATEST CHELSEA WOMEN NEWS HERE\nChelsea recorded their biggest Stamford Bridge crowd last season in a WSL game against Tottenham, playing in front of 38,350 people in a 3-0 win. Each Champions League game drew in five-figure crowds, with the semi-final home leg against Barcelona attracting nearly 28,000.\nThe club have also confirmed that, having asked for feedback from fans, they will additionally be offering split season ticket packages that will allow supporters to either just attend games at Stamford Bridge, or just attend games at Kingsmeadow should they wish to.\nGames at Stamford Bridge will even see different stands earmarked for different purposes. The East Stand will be geared towards families, the West Stand will feature live music and entertainment, the Matthew Harding Stand will be a singing section for the more vocal fans, while the Shed End will be split between away supporters and additional Chelsea fans.\nWomen’s football fandom has started to suffer from growing pains since Euro 2022 proved to be a watershed moment for the game’s development. It has long been hailed as a brilliant way for families to enjoy football without the typical problems associated with men’s football, which cannot afford to be lost. But the rapid growth that has brought thousands more people has also led to the rise of noisier crowds, which creates better atmospheres and is more enjoyable for players.\nNeither particularly goes hand in hand, but Chelsea are looking at ways to make both possible.",
