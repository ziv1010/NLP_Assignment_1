A. Strike 🤯\n— National Women's Soccer League (@NWSL) April 26, 2025\nFrom outside the 18, Delanie Sheehan gets Houston the lead! pic.twitter.com/2th506Lovr\nThe Utah goalie faced off against fellow USWNT keeper contender Jane Campbell, and the two combined for eight saves on the night to keep things deadlocked at 0-0 until the final 10 minutes.\nAn initial shot off a free kick by Houston was blocked, but Janni Thomsen gave the ball right back to the Dash at the edge of the box, and Sheehan delivered a banger to the upper-right corner for the difference in a tight 1-0 result between the two teams with losing records.\nSandy native and BYU alum Brecken Mozingo had perhaps the best chance of the night for Utah just minutes earlier on a strike across goal that forced an outstretched one-handed save from Campbell for one of her five on the night.\nJane Campbell followers up her USWNT teammate Mandy McGlynn's save with this reacher on a dynamite shot from Brecken Mozingo.

Coenraets knocked on wood when discussing the returns and additions of players for a snake-bitten Utah team, and repeated the phrase \"need to get fit\" more times than one can count.\nThe latest in a stream of injury announcements came just before Friday's game when offseason addition Bianca St-Georges was ruled out with a thigh injury. Claudia Zornoza left the match in the 23rd minute due to injury, giving way to Flynn's return and allowing Ana Tejada to move up into the midfield for the first time this season.\nCoenraets said he expects St-Georges to miss a couple of weeks, but also hopes to gain a few players off the injury list in the coming weeks as well.\n\"We should definitely get three to four players back in the next few weeks, and then we can start building again,\" Coenraets said. \"Because as much as you build on a few things today, whenever you bring in four or five new players, you have to build again. And I think that's the hardest part of where we're at right now.\"\nUtah returns to America First Field next week for a home match against last-place North Carolina as the Royals sit three spots below the playoffs and three spots above the bottom, just six games into the 26-game season.",
