  "body_text": "Success for me is not losing to the dark side six games in a row…\nWe wanted to get a snapshot of how Newcastle United fans are thinking.\nThree months into the season and 17 matches played so far across three competitions.\nNow in the November international break and Newcastle United fans seeing their team win eight games, draw three, lose six.\nThose results summing up a start to the season with plenty of ups and downs.\nPlenty to talk about as we ask a number of Newcastle United fans, who are regular/irregular contributors to The Mag, to give us their views on the season so far, plus what will happen as we move forward.\nNext up is Tony Mallabar answering the questions.\nThree words to describe how you currently feel as a Newcastle fan?\nAm pretty chilled.\nLook, we’ve had a massive upheaval at the club this summer, with players out and players in.\nIt is really our first major transfer window in the last five windows. So we just need to chill. New players take time to bed in.\nThree words to describe Newcastle United now?\nMoving forward…hopefully.\nAlexander Isak – Time to forgive and forget…?\nLast season with a few games to go and Champions League qualification looking on the cards, I remember being at a match and turning round to Chrissy Numbers, said we needed to take Isak off and get whatever injury issues he had sorted (because at the time I was convinced the reason for his lethargic displays was down to him carrying an injury).\nEven if it meant he missed the end of the season and we failed to qualify for the Champions League, because I thought getting back a fully fit Isak for the start of next season was more important, boy did I get that one wrong.\nThis whole “Isak is a rat” thing, kind of leaves a bit of a bitter taste as in my opinion, we are Geordies and we are better than this. Did he go on like a bit of a doylem to force his move???. Absolutely.\nHowever, once that you have seen a Beardsley or a Gazza walk out the front door, anything after that, I’ve realised players come and go.\nIsak was a top player, although he destroyed any toon brownie points he ever had. At the end of the saga I’d have genuinely been happy for him to move to sunlun, rather than luckypool. Well maybe not!!!\nIf you had to choose. A win against Sunderland but lose to Fulham in Carabao Cup quarter-final, or lose to Sunderland and go through to Carabao Cup semi-finals?\nI saw a poll on The Mag recently, asking this very question, Anybody who answered Fulham was either a mackem infiltrator or a new takeover fan.\nWould winning the Carabao Cup again this season BUT finishing outside the Premier League top six, be success or failure?\nSuccess for me is not losing away to Stevenage in the cup, not getting beat off the dark side six games in a row, not going to a bottom of the league Sheffield United and capitulating, like we did all of those things under FCB’s tutelage.\nHand on heart, what is your best estimate (not hope!) of where Newcastle United will end up this season in the Premier League, the Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup, how well they will realistically do in each of them?\nHaven’t a clue is my honest answer. Obviously am rooting we win every one. My job as a toon fan is go and support us and leave the predictions/ punditry to the likes of those football intellectuals, like Gabby Agbonlahor and Troy Deeney.\nIn order, which six NUFC players have been the most impressive so far this 2025/26 season?\nWith so many new players bedding in and the likes of Wissa, Tino and Lewis Hall all out, it’s far too early to judge.\nIn order, by the end of the 2025/26 season, which six NUFC players do you think will have proved the top performers?\nAll of those fingers crossed.\nEight months ago, Eddie Howe banked the first trophy for Newcastle in 56 years, then two months later secured a second Champions League qualification in three years. Some Newcastle fans appear to be questioning his position now. What are your thoughts on Eddie Howe and how much more time has he earned to get the league position sorted and beyond that, or not?\nEddie has in my opinion. unlimited credit in the bank.\nUnfortunately, today’s football is more than ever a result driven business.\nBut look at the bigger picture, who would we get in to replace him (especially now since Rafa (who is a Geordie) is currently unavailable).\nI mean, last season luckypools manager was the best thing since Marks and Spencers cheese bread, now half of Ireland/ Norway are calling for his napa.\nWhat do you think about how the summer transfer window was conducted by Newcastle United?\nLike every other fan, I have no insight into who the club are looking at player-wise or how negotiating goes on.\nMy summer regarding the toon was a toss up on should I go to our pre season tour of Singapore/ Korea. I didn’t, although Monty and Maclush did. Or go to Celtic. I did. And regretted it ever since.\nWhat do you see as three positive things for Newcastle United so far this season?\nJacob Murphy.\nBar Loco stop taking table reservations before the match.\nThe ugly bus leaving for Everton at 7.30am so we get to luckypool in time for a decent bevy before our first visit to the scouse mackemdome.\nWhat do you see as three negative things for Newcastle United so far this season?\nEasy answer.\nMo return of the cheeseburger stand outside the East Stand ( apparently moved as not to take business off the Stack).\nMadri now being the East Stand’s premium beer option.\nLNER having railworks for two London games in a row (West Ham and Brentford).\nSunderland are now back in the same division and at this moment ahead of NUFC, your thoughts?\nFair play to the dark side, they have recruited well and are playing a brand of football that’s got them deservedly in the current top four.\nOh, had on, I can hear the sound of screeching tyres outside..,the mackems totally spawned their way up to the Premier League, have discarded the players who got them there by the way. And this will massively come back to haunt them come AFCON (Wissa, do the decent thing and stay hyem to give Big Nick a bit of a rest).\nI’ve watched a few of their games this season and in truth not even Kylie Minogue could get this (lucky lucky lucky).\nTheir fans are now going on like the stadium of excrement is now some kind of fortress, despite before this season selling out only twice, us in the cup and Beyonce at home.\nAnd don’t get me started on their version of Wor Flags ( wheeze keyezz flags).\nFunnily, before they started doing tifo displays, any kind of our show of support was “Mag behaviour.”\nAnd while am on one. remember the team who give us ‘lads fans’ only had 22k for a first team game this season. Sorry mackems but nothing could be finer.\nWhat would represent success in the 2025/26 season for Newcastle United?\nRelegated mackems, luckypool and mackems women’s team.\nWhat do you see as the minimum to achieve this coming season?\nGetting Phil T back from spurs away (midweek game), so he can do back shift at International Paints. And the heed getting into the 3rd round of the FA Cup.\nWith NUFC now having won a trophy…has that changed your priorities at all with the club now balancing getting Champions League football on a regular basis, compared to try and win cups?\nAs a fan, difficult question.\nWe are playing way too much football and for the first time ever, I questioned should I apply for my Champions League tickets (obviously I did).\nBut if something is too much for me, when does that spill owa to the normal fans. I worry.\nNext three seasons, would you rather finish top four all three seasons BUT win nothing, or finish mid-table all three seasons AND win the FA Cup in one of the three?\nWin the FA Cup, considering our legacy in the 50s because my grandad Tommy went to all three finals.\nWhat are your thoughts on the fact that we are now more than four years after the takeover and still no plans announced on a new training ground, nor a far bigger capacity stadium (either brand new one, or an increased capacity St James’ Park)?\nI said after the takeover we were/ ten years behind Manchester City / luckypool.\nEighteen months ago I was convinced our owners were waiting on the Man City 115 charges being made public, before we kick on. Time will William tell I suppose.\nIf Newcastle United were to look to the transfer market to strengthen the team/squad in January, what do you see as the priority (or priorities…)?\nBring back Isak on loan to p.ss off luckypool.\nWould you say winning the Carabao Cup last season has made you more content, or now more desperate to get the next one?\nAfter Fulham last last season I had get rid of nice guy Eddie.\nOh the joys of being Newcastle United’s number one fickle fan.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
