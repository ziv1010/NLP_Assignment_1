He also claimed that while he was being taken to the Garda barracks he was manhandled, was struck on the back of the head, and kneed in the back.\nThe court also heard that Mr Sheehan was subsequently acquitted of committing any offence under the Public Order Act by a criminal court.\nRepresented by Moira Flahive SC, Caroline Latham Bl instructed by Donal McGann of Alastair Purdy & Co Solicitors Mr Sheehan said he had never come to the attention of the Gardai prior or since the incident in 2012.\nArising out of the incident Mr Sheehan said that he suffered injuries to his face, head and back. He also claimed that he suffered from depression and insomnia, as a result of what had happened to him.\nIt also affected his relationship with family members and left him unable to deal with his late wife's cancer, the court also heard.\nMr Sheehan, a father and grandfather, is well-known in sporting circles had previously played football for Athlone Town and other clubs in the League of Ireland.\nHe also played GAA locally and intercounty football for Westmeath.\nHe had many relatives who had served in An Garda Siochana, including his grandfather, father and a son in law, and had almost become a member himself, the court heard.\nHis son Alan Sheehan played soccer professionally in England for many years, including spells at Leeds United, Leicester City, Luton Town and Notts County, and had also been capped at U-21 level for Ireland.\nAlan Sheehan has also coached at clubs including Southampton, Luton and Northampton.\nIn its defence the State's lawyers argued that Mr Sheehan was arrested after two others in his company had been observed by Gardai piggybacking in the middle of the street and were causing a hazard to traffic.\nThe State also claimed that during the incident Mr Sheehan had acted aggressively towards the Gardai, and that he was pepper sprayed after another person had assaulted one of the Gardai, and matters had got out of hand.\nIt was claimed that Mr Sheehan told the Gardai dealing with the matter that \"Don't you know who I am,\" and \"you better have a good solicitor.\"\nIts response to the public order incident was reasonable and proportionate, the defendants submitted.\nThe defendants also said that Mr Sheehan had admitted after his arrest that he had consumed five or six pints of beer that night.\nMr Sheehan rejected all of the state's allegations and said that he had only consumed one pint of beer shandy and had only been in the pub for a relatively short period on the night in question.\nThe case, which ran for several days was heard before a civil jury of five women and seven men presided over by Mr Justice Alexander Owens.\nThe jury after deliberating for just over an hour on Wednesday afternoon, found that the gardai had used excessive and unreasonable force in its dealing with Mr Sheehan.\nIt also found that he had been assaulted both in the back of the Garda car, and in the yard of Athlone Garda barracks following his arrest.\nMr Sheehan was entitled to damages of €505,000, the jury further found.\nHe was also awarded his legal costs against the state by the judge.\nMr Justice Owens thanked the jury for its service and exempted them from having to do any further jury duty for 10 years.\nThe judge placed a stay on the order in the event of an appeal to the Court of Appeal if €75,000 is immediately paid by the defendants to Mr Sheehan.\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nSubscribe or register today to discover more from DonegalLive.ie\nBuy the e-paper of the Donegal Democrat, Donegal People's Press, Donegal Post and Inish Times here for instant access to Donegal's premier news titles.\nKeep up with the latest news from Donegal with our daily newsletter featuring the most important stories of the day delivered to your inbox every evening at 5pm.",
