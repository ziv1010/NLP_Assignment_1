  "body_text": "This article has been updated to include data from the 2023-24 Women’s Super League season. It was originally published on November 7, 2023.\nAlthough Emma Hayes is now synonymous with winning, it didn’t happen instantaneously for the English manager.\nAppointed by Chelsea midway through 2012, the Blues won two games and lost three during her first stretch in charge. It was enough to keep her in the job, setting the course for one of the club’s greatest runs: seven Women’s Super League titles (eight, counting the interim 2017 competition as they reconfigured the calendar to match England’s men’s leagues), five FA Cup triumphs, a pair of Leagues Cup wins, and second place in the 2020-21 UEFA Women’s Champions League.\nAdvertisement\n“‘Determined winner,’” Hayes said when The Athletic asked what her obituary would say. “‘Good human.’ ‘Funny.’ I have a love for life, I’m always a positive person, and have a lot of good energy.”\nGO DEEPER\nThis Is Me: Emma Hayes\nWhile her shoe game and post-win celebrations give a glimpse into her personality, being a “determined winner” guides every decision Hayes makes about her tactics. A tactical chameleon, she doesn’t have the same staunch tenets of play as rivals like Jonas Eidevall of Arsenal or Gareth Taylor of Manchester City.\nBut will experience building a great club translate into what U.S. Soccer is looking for as it replaces Vlatko Andonovski’s lackluster 2023 World Cup with Hayes’ fresh perspective?\n“There was definitely a sense that we need to be better with the ball and have more solutions,” U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker said in September. The federation polled players during the coaching search and much of the focus from the tactical feedback involved building the attack, playing through the midfield and having “creative solutions in tight spaces, having the players and the tactics to beat the low block.”\nIf any team is accustomed to facing a low block, it’s Hayes’ Chelsea. She plans for the opponent rather than coaching from dogmatic principles, which may help the U.S. program rebound from its least successful cycle in history. Between sizing up her opponents’ weak points and assessing her own squad’s readiness, each game’s instructions are curated with one aim in mind: winning, above all else. That resilience paid off in her Chelsea send-off, holding her teams’ nerve after some tough results to ensure her tenure ended with another WSL title.\nHayes has found success with a variety of structures. Over the last few years, Chelsea has spent multiple matches lined up in a 4-2-3-1, 4-3-3, 5-2-1-2, 3-4-3, and 3-4-1-2. If the referee blows their whistle and she doesn’t like the tactical matchup, Hayes is quick to pivot to Plan B, even if it means switching from a back-four to a back-three in the opening minutes.\nAdvertisement\nEx-players laud Hayes’ desire to take the personal touch to better manage individuals rather than leading from a one-approach-fits-all template. “We’ve got Ferraris in the team and we’ve got Skodas,” she once told former forward Eniola Aluko. “You can’t treat them the same.”\nThat flexibility and recognition of an opponent’s approach should be music to the ears of USWNT fans after Andonovski failed to get the most out of his players this summer at the World Cup. Players seemed to lack confidence in their roles, from Alex Morgan being forced to play a different type of center forward to several players being utilized away from their primary positions. Rather than changing the approach in the final third to exploit an opponent’s weaknesses, each game saw the U.S. attempt to progress in the same manner, get stifled, then recirculate and try the same thing again.\nBy comparison, Hayes’ fluidity should be a needed salve as the program acclimates to the continually growing number of competitive peers in the international game — something Hayes knows well.\nIn 2019, the Blues were in the Champions League semifinal opposite French powerhouse Lyon. That Lyon side could have passed as a world-best XI: Wendie Renard and Lucy Bronze along the backline; Amandine Henry and Dzsenifer Marozsán among the midfielders; and an unstoppable attack led by Ada Hegerberg and Eugénie Le Sommer. For all of her side’s quality, Chelsea was undeniably the underdog in this clash.\n“We’re playing the Harlem Globetrotters on Sunday,” Hayes said during a small availability attended by The Athletic before the game. “You can either sit here and s— yourself, or you face it and go for it.”\nLyon narrowly overcame Chelsea, winning the first leg in France 2-1 before playing to a 1-1 draw at Kingsmeadow. Lyon returned to their Globetrottering best in the final, playing FC Barcelona off the field with four goals scored in the opening half-hour.\nAdvertisement\nNo matter her kaleidoscopic tactical ideology, there are some identifiable strategic trademarks of Hayes’ Chelsea side beyond their results.\nStarting from the back, her goalkeepers work to efficiently distribute beyond the first line. Since the start of the 2022/23 season, no WSL goalkeeper (with a minimum of 900 minutes) has sent a greater share of their passes 35+ yards than Ann-Katrin Berger (52.6%). The German is the only WSL regular to send over half of her passes long, with understudies Hannah Hampton (45.5%) and Zecira Musovic (41.5%) ranking 6th and 14th of the 19-minute qualifiers at the position. Berger left Chelsea in April to join Gotham FC in the NWSL.\nGO DEEPER\nAnn-Katrin Berger on leaving Chelsea, adjusting to the NWSL and her Olympic dream\nDon’t mistake Hayes as being a route one apologist, though. As a collective, Chelsea sent 11.4% of its passes long, which ranked 8th of the 13 teams that had spent at least one of the last two seasons in the WSL. Her team is comfortable with the majority of possession, third in the league with a 59.2% average rate. These aren’t the recirculating touches that U.S. fans came to dread under Andonovski, either. Chelsea ranks third behind Arsenal and Manchester City with a field tilt — a possession stat that only accounts for a team’s touches in the attacking third — of 65.7%.\nApplying Hayes’ double-pivot midfield and press to the USWNT\nIn most setups, Hayes’ midfield consists of a double-pivot at the base with a playmaking number 10 pulling the strings. That means there could be two dedicated roles for central midfielders behind an attacking quartet with the U.S. to improve build-up. It will likely be the home for Lindsey Horan, now one of the program’s most vital players and, with Lyon on a permanent basis, one of a few who regularly play in Europe.\nHoran is also capable of playing further advanced, though the pool has some elite playmaking midfielders including Rose Lavelle and Catarina Macario, while Jaedyn Shaw figures to contend for time at the number 10 role when healthy.\nHoran’s midfield role will also likely be the home for rising players like Jaelin Howell, Taylor Kornieck, Korbin Albert and Olivia Moultrie. It’s also easy to envision World Cup members Andi Sullivan and Emily Sonnett as defense-first 6s ahead of the backline, a role dominated by Sam Coffey in the first half of 2024. The preference for a double-pivot could also finally bring Crystal Dunn (who Hayes coached in 2017-18) to her preferred role after years miscast at left-back — although Hayes listed Dunn among the forwards for her first U.S. squad.\nAt Chelsea, many chances come from wide, particularly through the half-spaces between the central and wide channels. Hayes’ wingers also vary based on the personnel, at times playing with two inverted wingers while other matchups necessitate a more traditional winger who can cross from her strong-side foot.\nAdvertisement\nMallory Swanson, Sophia Smith, Trinity Rodman and Mia Fishel will be entering their primes over the next four years, while young attackers like Alyssa Thompson, Croix Bethune and Shaw could grow into more prominent roles within the team’s attacking pool too. Of these, only Rodman seems locked into playing a wide role, giving Hayes plenty of versatility as she looks to, in Crocker’s words, “have more solutions” to turn possession into goals.\nThe combination of playing with a central attacking playmaker and building up through wide channels creates a feast of service for her strikers. And none has flourished more than Sam Kerr, who was signed by Chelsea away from the Chicago Red Stars nine years after the club fired Hayes.\nThe emphasis on width also extends to Hayes’ team’s defending, with the press forcing opponents to keep the ball wide. This is achieved by having the forwards and central midfielder press players on the ball toward the sideline while keeping the double-pivot from dropping into the backline to congest the center of the park. And yet, the fullbacks’ positioning and closing down of crosses have kept opponents from turning the wide possession into a flurry of crosses; Chelsea’s average of conceding 8.44 open-play crosses per game is well below the league average of 10.62.\nChelsea’s average of conceding 8.2 open-play crosses per game over the past two seasons is well below the league average of 11.\nIn the U.S. defense, Jenna Nighswonger, M.A. Vignola and Emily Fox could be the answers on the left, with Tierna Davidson at center back to contend with Naomi Girma, Alana Cook, Abby Dahlkemper and Sonnett. Dunn, in addition to returning to midfield, could be a great fit at right back, along with Fox and Sofia Huerta. If that feels too reliant on veterans — a pitfall from Andonovski’s tenure — it’s worth noting that no American right back under the age of 25 logged even 500 minutes in the 2023 NWSL season.\nLearning from World Cup mistakes\nThis summer, there was an overreliance on the oldest members of the pool who had led their World Cup-winning sides in 2015 and 2019, slowing the involvement of the rising generation of players. It makes the inevitable roster churn under Hayes seem more daunting as a result. Since the tournament ended, Julie Ertz and Megan Rapinoe have retired. Sauerbrunn returned for the fall friendlies against South Africa and Colombia, but at 38 is almost certain to not factor in 2027. Alyssa Naeher, Alex Morgan, Kelley O’Hara, and Kristie Mewis will all be 35 or older when the next World Cup comes around, too.\nNine of Andonovski’s 20 field players stayed on for over 87% of all possible minutes.\nAt the World Cup, the U.S. didn’t play at a talent disadvantage compared to opponents like the Netherlands and Sweden, rather a multitude of factors saw the team crash out of the round of 16, its first finish outside of the top three places in the tournament history.\nGO DEEPER\nAnalyzing USWNT coaching decisions during early World Cup exit\nPlayers have been open about some issues that they failed to overcome in Australia and New Zealand. Half of the field players that started against Sweden were playing in a different position than their club role, with some players only learning how they’d be relied upon after flying to the tournament.\nAdvertisement\n“We had a scrimmage with the Philippines, and I think that was the last session where I was not with the starting team,” DeMelo said on Snacks, a podcast hosted by Lynn Williams and Sam Mewis. “Then we had a day off and then the next training session after that, he had come up to me, he’s like, ‘We’re gonna put you at the starting group.’ And I was like, ‘for what reason?’”\nDeMelo started the opening match as the team’s number 10. Despite her lack of prior integration into the team, she fared well by creating chances and working to progress the ball. And yet, she would not feature again in the group stage, only returning for one 45-minute shift as the team fell to Sweden.\n“I did not see it coming, that’s for sure,” DeMelo said.\nHayes will be entrusted with the turnover from a roster that won two World Cups to a new generation of players. Luckily, the freshest faces among that group have already had some big-game experience this year, winning the W Gold Cup and SheBelieves Cup. Many of those players are on the roster for June’s friendlies, which will be vital tests for Hayes and her new players ahead of this summer’s Olympics.\nWhether her players are ready or not, the Emma Hayes era of the USWNT is finally upon us. Denver and Saint Paul will provide the stages for her grand debut in the international game, with a brighter spotlight shining from Paris in just over two months.\nHayes won’t have much time to make a mark on her new side in time for the tournament. We may see the Olympics come and go without a clear sense of the key principles Hayes will build her USWNT around for the remainder of the cycle. However, that appears to be a potential unintended consequence that U.S. Soccer was willing to accept.\n(Photo: Robbie Jay Barratt/Getty Images)",
