But the Spanish football federation has accused the player of lying about her version of events and has threatened legal action.\nThe kiss has resulted in pressure on Luis Rubiales to leave his job, including from the Spanish government, but he has so far refused to resign.\nSpain's World Cup winners are now refusing to play while Rubiales stays in his position and their entire coaching staff have quit in protest against the president and his actions.\nFifa, which is football's governing body has suspended Rubiales from all football related activities for 90 days.\nWhat has Luis Rubiales said?\nLuis Rubiales has said he will defend himself \"so that the truth prevails and complete innocence is proven\".\nThe president of Spanish football, Rubiales apologised for the kiss after the World Cup final, but has faced a lot of pressure to leave his job and was expected to announce his resignation at a meeting on Friday.\nInstead he told the meeting, attended by the managers of Spain's men's and women's teams, that he was not going to leave his position. At the time managers of both teams applauded his comments.\n\"Jenni was the one who lifted me up,\" he said. \"I told her to 'forget about the penalty [that Mary Earps saved]' and I said to her 'a little peck?' and she said 'OK'.\n\"It was a spontaneous kiss. Mutual, euphoric and consensual. That's the key.\nA consensual 'peck' is enough to get me out of here?\"\n\"I will not resign, I will not resign!\" he said.\nWhat has Jeni Hermoso said?\nIn a statement released on Friday night Jenni Hermoso said \"in no moment\" did she agree to the kiss.\n\"I felt vulnerable and a victim of an impulse-driven, sexist, out of place act without any consent on my part.\n\"I want to make it clear that at no time did the conversation to which Mr. Luis Rubiales refers to in his address take place, and, above all, was his kiss ever consensual. I want to reiterate as I did before that I did not like this incident.\"\nIn an interview straight after the World Cup win, Hermoso seemingly defended the football president and the kiss, saying: \"It was a totally spontaneous mutual gesture because of the immense joy that winning a World Cup brings.\n\"The president and I have a great relationship, his behaviour with all of us has been outstanding and it was a natural gesture of affection and gratitude.\"\nA statement defending Rubiales' actions was also released by the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) on Hermoso's behalf following the World Cup victory, however the player says she wasn't comfortable commenting on the incident, when asked to \"reduce the pressure on the president\".\n\"I was asked to make a joint statement to reduce the pressure on the president, but at that time my mind was only on enjoying the historic achievement together with my teammates.\n\"That's why I told the RFEF, as well as the media and people close to me, that I didn't want to make any kind of individual or collective statement on this matter.\n\"Despite my decision, I must say that I have felt under continuous pressure to come out with a statement which could justify Luis Rubiales' actions.\"\nWhat has the Spanish Football Federation said?\nSpain's football federation said on Saturday it would take legal action to defend its president.\nIn a statement the federation said it would show there have been lies about what happened by Hermoso or people speaking for her.\n\"The evidence is conclusive,\" it said, saying that images showed that Rubiales had been lifted up by Hermoso and that \"Mr President has not lied.\"\nThe federation also said that, if selected, players have \"an obligation\" to play for the national team, after 81 female players said they will not represent Spain until Rubiales leaves his position.\nWhat has the reaction been elsewhere?\nThe kiss between Hermoso and Spain's football president has completely overshadowed the Spanish women's football team and their greatest ever achievement - winning the World Cup.\nSpanish players, clubs and organisations have all spoken out against the incident.\nSpain's women's coach, Jorge Vilda, who had appeared to support Rubiales and his decision to stay in his job, has since called the kiss 'inappropriate' and 11 of his coaching team have quit in support of Hermoso.\nAlexia Putellas, a Ballon d'Or winner and another member of the World Cup-winning team team has said that the kiss was \"unacceptable\".\nBorja Iglesias, who has won two caps for the Spain men's team, said: \"I have made the decision not to return to the national team until things change and these types of acts do not go unpunished.\"\nSeveral Spanish football clubs, including Barcelona, Sevilla, Espanyol and Racing Santander, have also released statements critical of Rubiales.\nEngland's Lionesses, who were defeated by Spain in the World Cup final have also released a joint statement saying:\n\"Abuse is abuse and we have all seen the truth.\n\"The behaviour of those who think they are invincible must not be tolerated and people shouldn't need convincing to take action against any form of harassment.\n\"We all stand with you, Jenni Hermoso and all players of the Spanish team.\"\nTimeline: How did the argument get to this point?\nThe kiss between Rubiales and Hermoso happened during the presentation ceremony where medals were being handed out following Spain's World Cup victory last Sunday.\nIn an Instagram video during celebrations Hermoso said: \"I did not like it, but what could I do?\". However, in an interview she later said \"The president and I have a great relationship, his behaviour with all of us has been outstanding and it was a natural gesture of affection and gratitude.\" A statement released later on her behalf by the Spanish Football Federation also defended the president's actions.\nRubiales apologised for the kiss on the Monday after the World Cup final, but many people criticised what happened as inappropriate, including Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said that Rubiales' apology was \"not enough\".\nOn Thursday, football's world governing body Fifa said it had opened disciplinary proceedings against Rubiales - which means deciding if he should be punished for his behaviour.\nOn Friday the Spanish Football Federation called a meeting where Rubiales was expected to announce that he would leave his position - but instead, he insisted he would not, repeating that he would not resign and said that Hermoso agreed to the kiss.\nThe Spanish football federation (RFEF) said on Saturday that it will take legal action over Jenni Hermoso's comments about its president and accused her of lying. Fifa announces it is suspending Rubiales for 90 days from all football activity as it continues its disciplinary proceedings.\n- Published25 August 2023\n- Published21 August 2023",
