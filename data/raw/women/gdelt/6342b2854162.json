If you think that's an unfounded statement, just check out his Fulton County Jail mugshot, taken after he was put under arrest for Georgia election racketeering and conspiracy charges. After reportedly spending about 20 minutes in jail and getting released on a $200,000 bond bail on Friday, the former US president (the only one to have a mugshot) took to X (formerly Twitter) with an incredulous promotion of his website, where he is asking for donations to support his presidential election campaign.\nThe doltish mugshot shows Trump with a stern (some might say determined) look on his face, appearing rather inconvenienced to appear in prison after announcing his plans to surrender earlier this week. However, what's even more asinine was to see how he used that mugshot as a glorified PR tool. Trump shared his mug shot accompanied by the text: \"ELECTION INTERFERENCE! NEVER SURRENDER!\"\nTrump's post garnered over 41 million views at the time of writing. The tweet found support from several Trump fans. Even X owner Elon Musk shared the post, calling the move \"next-level\".\nThomson To Start Laptop Manufacturing In India With A Homegrown Partner\nFrench electronics manufacturer Thomson is the latest brand to foray into the laptop category in India.

Chandrayaan-3 touched down on the Moon at 6:04 pm IST on August 23, 2023. All the phases of descent during the ‘15 minutes of terror’ were successfully completed. Chandrayaan-3 underwent initial preparation, velocity reduction, orientation change, attitude hold phase, fine braking, final descent, and touchdown. Powered descent began after the automatic landing sequence was initiated. After the Vikram lander successfully landed on the lunar south pole, the sensors signalled the computer onboard the spacecraft. About four hours after touchdown, the Pragyan rover rolled out of the Vikram lander.\nAfter Chandrayaan-3 successfully soft landed on the Moon's south pole on August 23, 2023, S Somanath, the chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), said that the Indian space agency's next goal is the Aditya-L1 mission. He said that the Aditya-L1 mission is getting ready at Sriharikota, news agency ANI reported. Aditya-L1 will be India's first space-based mission to study the Sun, and will be placed in a halo orbit around the Lagrange point 1 of the Sun-Earth system. Aditya-L1 has a planned mission duration of five years. The solar mission is expected to be launched by the end of August, or early September this year.\nChandrayaan-3’s activities are on schedule and all activities are normal, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said on August 24, 2023, a day after the spacecraft’s historic soft landing on the Moon’s south pole. Most of Vikram lander’s payloads have been turned on, and the Pragyan rover has begun its mobility operations. Pragyan was rolled out of Vikram on August 23, about four hours after Chandrayaan-3’s touchdown. Vikram is a lander, and hence, will conduct experiments by remaining in a fixed position. Meanwhile, Pragyan will explore the lunar surface, performing scientific activities.\nENT\nThe 69th National Film Awards were announced on Thursday (August 24).
