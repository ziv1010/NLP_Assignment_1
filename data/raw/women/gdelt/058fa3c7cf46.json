  "body_text": "Ryan Reynolds has congratulated Wrexham AFC Women on playing their “guts out” to secure a title win.\nThe 46-year-old Hollywood star, who has co-owned Welsh side Wrexham AFC with fellow actor Rob McElhenney since 2021, celebrated the female-affiliated club taking home the Genero Adran North title at the weekend.\nThe women’s club won their 11th game in the league in early March, clinching the win, and the Red Dragons lifted the trophy when the league season concluded on Sunday.\nThe champions also beat Connah’s Quay Nomads 2-1 at the Racecourse Ground.\nOn Monday, Reynolds wrote on Instagram: “Two unbelievable days of Wrexham football.\n“Nearly 20,000 people passed through the gates of the Racecourse Ground. @wrexham_afc won — but the main event was @wrexhamafcwomen winning it all and hoisting the big shiny trophy.\n“These women played their guts out and @robmcelhenney and I couldn’t be prouder or more choked up.”\nThe Deadpool actor also shared a series of photos which showed him celebrating the win with the female club and posing with Wrexham AFC players.\nSince Reynolds and It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia creator McElhenney completed a deal for Wales’s oldest club two years ago, the pair have invested in the club and promoted its profile through a fly-on-the-wall Welcome To Wrexham documentary.\nThey were also honoured in November by the Welsh Government, the Football Association of Wales and S4C for promoting the country and its language when they were given the Dragon Award.\nWrexham AFC, who are National League promotion contenders, made headlines in late January when they came close to knocking Championship side Sheffield United out of the FA Cup, instead getting a replay at Bramall Lane which they lost 3-1 after late goals.",
