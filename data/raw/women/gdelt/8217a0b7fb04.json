  "body_text": "USF lacrosse star becomes force behind team’s success\nGrowing up in a competitive family, Sofia Chepenik learned early on that hard work leads to success.\nAfter a year and a half of training with the Bulls, the 21-year-old lacrosse attacker has felt every ounce of the program’s success this spring.\nShe has earned multiple American Athletic Conference attacker of the week honorable mentions and is third in the conference with 47 goals.\nRelated: USF women’s lacrosse defeats Vanderbilt to stay atop conference\nDespite Chepenik’s accomplishments, she said she wants to be remembered for more than just someone who plays well on a field.\n“I want to be someone that my teammates can rely on and always look up to me,” Chepenik said.\nShe said she is motivated by a belief system of encouragement and positivity.\n“I hope that I can make them want to be a better person too,” Chepenik said.\nCoach Mindy McCord said Chepenik has grown as both a person and a player since her transfer from Clemson in 2023. At Clemson, she led the AAC freshman with goals and assists.\nChepenik entered the transfer portal after her freshman season at Clemson. McCord invited her to visit USF, and she eventually opted to transfer there.\nShe said she found USF to be a welcoming atmosphere where she wanted to leave a legacy.\nMcCord said Chepenik is always eager to take the next step in leadership.\n“She’s just very growth-oriented, and she’s never staying the same,” McCord said. “She’s always shedding the old skin for the new.”\nMcCord admired Chepenik’s ability to lead while maintaining an understanding of the game, making her a great asset for the team.\nRelated: USF women’s lacrosse makes history in blowout win against St. Bonaventure\nBorn and raised in Jacksonville, Chepenik was first introduced to the sport when she attended Coach McCord’s lacrosse camp at the age of 7 in 2013.\nBeing a late bloomer to the game, she didn’t start training until the sixth grade.\nChepenik’s sister also played lacrosse, and when she was going through the recruitment process, Chepenik was still young and coachless.\nChepenik said she hated the sport growing up, recounting that she didn’t consider herself a good player and how her sister was the star.\nBut through that, she only found a seed for improvement.\nHer upbringing consisted of a sports-driven environment and family competitiveness, as her siblings excelled in lacrosse and football. She learned just how much of a hard worker she could be.\n“I just kind of fell in love with working hard and getting better, and knew that I wanted to take my talent to the next level,” Chepenik said.\nChepenik now translates this same mentality for the Bulls.\nShe strives to win the AAC this spring and ultimately a national title.\nMcCord described Chepenik as fiercely competitive. But Chepenik also has an ambition for team spirit, leaving an impact on her teammates.\n“She wants to leave no stone unturned. She will prepare as hard as she can,” McCord said. “She brings a spirit that is uncanny to a team.”\nChepenik acknowledges her role on the team has helped the Bulls maintain their 11-4 overall record, clinching towards the AAC tournament during the programs’ first season in history.\n“When everyone comes in and you come into something that hasn’t been established before, and you get to make it how you want, it’s just an incredible feeling to feel like all of your work as a team is coming to fruition,” McCord said.\nChepenik anticipates a brewing legacy with USF during the program’s starting season.\nUSF plays the final game of the regular season against Stetson at 6 p.m. Wednesday at Corbett Stadium.",
