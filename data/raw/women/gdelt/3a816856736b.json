  "body_text": "Mizzou Softball gets its first transfer portal acquisition in veteran SEC INF/OF Taylor Ebbs\nThe Morning Commute for Friday, June 14\nToday we’re talking about Mizzou Softball’s first offseason addition, a middle infielder & outfield combo player who will arrive from Lexington, KY for her senior season, Tayor Ebbs.\nWith the graduation of four major contributors to this year’s 48-win team— 2B Maddie Gallagher, SS Jenna Laird, CF Alex Honnold and P Laurin Krings — there are some holes in the Tiger lineup, and Ebbs, a career .272 hitter with 25 home runs and 85 career RBI, will surely slot into one of these spaces. While she played right field at UK, that is Kayley Lenger’s spot to lose, so depending upon whatever other reinforcements the Tigers bring in, I could see her slotting in at 2B.\nEbbs, the former Oregon Player of the Year, was sidelined a big portion of her junior season with a shoulder injury that left her to learn to play with a right arm brace. Despite the injury, however, Taylor was still able to do considerable damage in just 90 at-bats, hitting .311 with 17 runs scored, 28 hits, five doubles, eight home runs, 31 RBI and a .656 SLG% / 1.019 OPS. She came up huge in UK’s series win over then-no. 7 Georgia, hitting two home runs to go with seven RBI.\nPer UK Athletics, Tayor credited her good attitude to her relationship with her faith, which allowed her to maintain a good headspace through the ups and down associated with her recovery. “I know I’m here for a different purpose than softball,” she said. “I’m here to glorify my God, so no matter what role I’m playing, I’m in a good headspace and I know that I have different roles to play in different moments. I take pride in that.”\nIf you’ve kept an eye on some potential targets — Dylan outlined seven here, and Quentin added seven more the next day in Morning Commute posts— you’d note that this name is familiar. Who knew we had a buncha clairvoyants at the site?!\nLet’s revisit what Q wrote, shall we?\nKentucky softball is set to lose a lot production from this past year’s NCAA Tournament team, with Ebbs being one of those departing players.\nOne unique aspect of Mizzou’s starting lineup this past season was the strong mix of left-handed and right-handed hitters. However, the Tigers’ top three lefties — Jenna Laird, Alex Honnold and Maddie Gallagher — are all gone. Ebbs could very much fill that void of lefty pop in the early/middle part of the lineup.\nHere’s a laser shot from Ebbs against North Carolina earlier in the season that had Kentucky softball’s twitter (X) account dishing out a pretty wild take.\nWelcome, Taylor!\nYesterday at Rock M and Rock M+\n- 2024-25 Mizzou WBB Depth Chart Preview by Dylan Heinrich\nProbable Starter at Forward: Laniah Randle— Randle is, in my opinion, the most plug-and-play option out of the incoming transfers, which is why she receives the starting nod in my list.\nDuring her junior year at Southern Illinois, she averaged 18.7 points while shooting 48.6% from the field and 74% from the line. Randle was a rebounding machine, averaging 8.8 boards per game with 3.6 coming on the offensive end.\nWhile maybe slightly undersized for a forward in the SEC at 5’11, Randle makes up for the height disparity with a level of tenacity unseen in most players, and she has a proven track record of success against high major competition, including 25 points on 10-12 shooting against Oklahoma State and a 30-point, 11-rebound outing against West Virginia.\nHead Coach Robin Pingeton, once she found out she was retained, really went to work in the portal, and it will be very interesting to see how it turns out.\n- Top 10 Opposing Players: Parker Brailsford and Deontae Lawson by Nathan Hurst\nWhile new Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer is tasked with introducing his high-powered offense to a new set of players this off-season, center Parker Brailsford will be one starter who should hit the ground running without any learning curve. Brailsford is a transfer from Washington who followed DeBoer to Tuscaloosa following the pair’s loss to Michigan in the national championship last season.\nIn Thursday’s TTOP, Hurst looks at some Bama men and how Mizzou can handle them.\n- Over at RockM.plus, there’s plenty of chatter about football and basketball. While there weren’t any new topics, there’s plenty to talk about, from Caleb Grill’s medical waiver going through, to schedule windows and more. Join us!\nOther Mizzou Stuff\n- UPDATED: Massive congrats to right side hitter Jordan Iliff, who was named to the 2024 Women’s Collegiate National Team on Thursdays. she’s one of 19 players listed on the team, which will train, per MUTigers.com, June 30-July 6 in Anaheim alongside the U.S. Olympic Women’s Volleyball team. This marks her second straight summer of being selected for the team. WTG, Jordan!\n- College Gym News releases its list of biggest improvements in the class of 2024 and 2025 recruiting rankings, and the Tigers, who have been KILLING it in the recruiting game (more on this from me to come this summer), have a couple of big risers.\nClass of 2024: Olivia Kelly (5-star, North Star Gymnastics, New Jersey)\nImprovement: 73 to 89\nReason for improvement: Kelly made massive strides since her last rating, making the her biggest jumps on both bars and floor. Having competed elite for Barbados, Kelly has greatly benefitted from international experience. That experience coupled with a really clean bars set and difficult floor routine that includes a beautiful double Arabian and two and a half twist is what helped her make the jump to five stars\nWhere she’ll excel in college: Even without the great incoming freshman class, Missouri is going to be a team to watch in 2025 with all of the talented transfers it managed to snag in the portal. Add in routines like Kelly’s, this could truly be a breakout year for the Tigers. While Kelly could realistically fit into any lineup, bars, beam, and floor are the most likely.\nClass of 2025: Kimarra Echols (5-star, Gymcats Gymnastics, Nevada)\nImprovement: 69 to 88\nReason for improvement: Missouri is starting to turn into Oklahoma with how it’s been able to find gymnasts with untapped potential early on in their recruiting journeys then turn them into stars in college. Echols fits that bill. In last year’s ratings, while she debuted as a strong bars and floor worker, her vault and beam were a step behind. She clearly put in the work, though, jumping from 16 points to a massive 23 on vault and from 13 up to 19 points on beam. Talk about a glow-up!\nWhere she can get even better: How can someone with a perfect floor total and near-perfect vault improve? The options are limited. Sitting at “just” 19 points on beam is the obvious place, but the areas of weakness are limited. If Echols can simply continue what she started in 2023, she may be able to go even higher, eclipsing 90 points in her senior season.\n- Love this team, and will watching these amazing seniors perform for the black & gold\n- Said in my best Cheers voice, “NORMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!”\n- Let’s rejoice in some Drink-isms\n- Soccer team members show us around some spots in CoMo\n- Oh, hello Matt Zollers! The tippy top of the QB performances at the Elite 11 regionals\nWhat I’m Reading/Watching\n- In light of the that Ehren Earleywine will be return to the coaching ranks at Ole Miss (surprise, surprise, as they don’t seem to care about character issues), I’m revisiting the reason why EE was let go by Jim Sterk and Missouri in January 2018 from FloSoftball’s Chez Sievers:\nDespite Missouri’s many successes, Earleywine’s coaching career has been marred by controversy. In 2016, he was investigated by the athletic department and Missouri Title IX office for nearly five months after being accused by players of verbal abuse. When the 2016 season ended, seven players left the program including pitching aces Paige Lowary and Tori Finucane.\nI’ve got to say, I know people can change, but I do not like this one bit.\n- The Media’s Role in Fracturing Sports, by Jerry Brewer (Washington Post)\nEight years later [after the death of Muhammad Ali], I wonder how many in the sports media still feel that broader sense of duty. At a time when societal grievance and division spill into the ring, I wonder whether we will adjust to meet this moment or continue to get trampled by it.\nWe currently reside, sadly so, in what the author called a “rage culture” within sports (and in daily life), where everything is a hot-take, we are directed towards who can scream the loudest and what will get the most clicks. We’ve lost the plot; we’ve lost the context of it all. And it’s not the first time this has happened. This article is fascinating, and I’m grateful my dad sent it to me. Also, there’s a part in there about former Mizzou DL Michael Sam.\n- Sports media is missing the mark(eting), by Lindsey Gibbs (Power Plays)\nThe same people who directly contributed to the disenfranchising of women’s sports are still the ones with the most power in the industry; they’re still the ones calling the shots, driving the headlines, raking in the money and endorsements, and shaping the narratives. Now here they are, using the popularity of Caitlin Clark — which is only possible because of the hard work of those they purposefully pushed to the shadows — as an opportunity to present themselves as experts in the fields of marketing and reporting on women’s basketball. But they are not merely spectators to this marginalization and mistreatment of women’s sports; they’re perpetrators of it. They have agency in this situation. And their refusal to acknowledge that might be the biggest roadblock facing women’s sports.\nThis piece was great, as is pretty much everything LinzSports writes. “But as anyone who has ever picked up a self-help book knows,” she writes, “recognizing you have power to change something is one thing, but following through is another altogether.” I just wish the media members who have the most eyes on them and yell the loudest recognize their power and use it for good. To amplify this women’s sports movement while handing the reins to those who are the most knowledgeable and have been through it.\n- Chiney Ogwumike’s message to fans and sports lovers. I just love her; she’s incredible.\n- Has anyone else checked out the limited series Clipped on FX/Hulu about former Clippers owner Donald Sterling and his downfall? It is fascinating, though outside of Ed O’Neill (AKA Al Bundy, Jay Pritchett) playing Donald Sterling and Laurence Fishburne playing Doc Rivers, who said he doesn’t watch sports and said he didn’t know who Doc was?!— the casting of the big-name Clippers players, which featured Chris Paul, DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin, and JJ Redick is next-level awful. It’s so bad I sit there and I’m like, who is that supposed to be?! Anyway, casting of the team aside, it’s really crazy and a good watch.\n- I’ll also have my eyes glued to my television as the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials start this weekend at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. All sessions will be streamed on Peacock, NBCOlympics.com and the NBC Sports App from June 15-23. Preliminary heats will be aired starting at 10am CT, with Semifinals/Finals sessions at 7pm CT each night (also on NBC).\nThe trials will feature decorated Olympians, including seven-time Olympic gold medalists Katie Ledecky and Caeleb Dressel, who look to make their fourth and third consecutive Olympic teams, respectively. The spotlight will also be on first-time Olympic hopefuls, such as breakout stars Dare Rose and Gretchen Walsh, both 21 years old.\n(** RockMNation has affiliate partnerships.
