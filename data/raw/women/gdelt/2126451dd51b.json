Including cup and European matches, total attendance for the year rose to 966,994.\nAdditionally, viewership figures surged, with televised matches more than doubling since 2021 and peak viewership increasing by 80 per cent, reaching over 3.08 million in 2023, further reflecting the league’s expanding reach and popularity.\nThe SSE Airtricity Women’s Premier Division experienced the largest increase in attendance over that period, rising by 169 per cent, while the SSE Airtricity Men’s Premier Division rose by 59 per cent and the SSE Airtricity Men’s First Division saw an increase of 159 per cent.\nIn 2023, the largest attendance recorded was 8,021 spectators at Shamrock Rovers’ home match against Sligo Rovers.\nIn the SSE Airtricity Women’s Premier Division, the highest attendance was 1,464 for the match between Shamrock Rovers and Peamount United at Tallaght Stadium.\nDirector at BDO Ireland, Austin Hickey, said: “BDO is delighted to release this landmark report, which reflects the League of Ireland’s growing importance to the Irish economy and its local communities.\n\"The report showcases not only the financial contributions made by the league but also the social benefits, such as community engagement programs and youth development through football academies.\n\"The continued growth in both men's and women's football speaks to the success of clubs in fostering a deeper connection with fans and delivering long-term value to society,”\nLeague of Ireland director, Mark Scanlon, said: “This report from BDO Ireland shows how the League of Ireland plays a crucial role through multiple dimensions bringing significant contributions to Irish society.\n\"Whether it be through direct or indirect employment, investment in infrastructure or supporter spend through travel, merchandise and hospitality, the League of Ireland has a major role to play in the Irish economy.\n\"League of Ireland Clubs have become increasingly professionalised in recent years and with Clubs now having Men’s and Women’s teams at Senior and Academy levels as well as strong community programmes, the Clubs have become integral to their local areas.\n\"This report shows us the net result of how this impacts Irish society and crucially how further investment can help the League realise its potential. We have seen increased attendances, audience and engagement with local communities and we’re excited for this to continue to grow.”",
