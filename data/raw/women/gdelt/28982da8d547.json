The men’s first team will be wearing the Cactus Jack logo on their chest for the Clásico on 11 May. The artist created the brand that is also the name of his record label, clothing collection, and works as his creative alter ego. The logo will also appear on the women’s first team jersey for their Liga F match on 18 May.\nTravis Scott is one of the most listened to artists on Spotify, famous for being able to blend styles that range from rap to alternative hip-hop among others. The musician has over 67 millions listeners a month and has been played over 44,000 million times, including the five Billions Club songs – the most played song collection – (goosebumps, SICKO MODE, HIGHEST IN THE ROOM, BUTTERFLY EFFECT and FE!N).\nThe US star takes the baton from Coldplay, KAROL G, The Rolling Stones, ROSALÍA, and Drake, the artists who previously featured on the chest of the FC Barcelona jersey.\nTravis Scott to play live in Barcelona\nFor first time, Spotify will bring the artist whose logo is featuring on the jersey to perform ahead of the Clásico. An important milestone in the career of Travis Scott – it will be the first time he has played in the city – and also for the Spotify x Barça partnership. The show will be on 10 May, the night before the Clásico, at an emblematic location in Barcelona that will be transformed into a stage. A private concert exclusively for the most loyal fans of the US singer, who will be invited to this unique show via Spotify.\nLimited edition jerseys and lifestyle clothing\nAs is the norm with these emblematic logo changes, two exclusive versions of the matchday jersey will go on sale, which will be available for purchase from 2 May at Barça Stores, through the Club’s e-commerce platform, SNKRS, and TravisScott.com\nOne of the limited edition jerseys comprises 1899 copies made in matchday quality, and the more exclusive edition comprises only 22 copies, also in matchday quality, but signed by the players starting both the Clásico and the Liga F match.\nA limited edition lifestyle clothing collection will also go on sale via the artist’s website on 9 May, bringing Travis Scott’s creative universe to comfortable and casual pieces of clothing, such as T-shirts, hoodies, shorts, a cap, a jacket, a scarf, and a retro-style football.\nFC Barcelona will also share a special edition of the popular Barça Matchday playlist on Spotify featuring themed songs to motivate the players and fans in the build up to the game, which was curated by Travis Scott.\nThis latest collaboration again brings football, music, and fashion together, reflecting the commitment from Spotify to artists, FC Barcelona, and fans of music and football worldwide.\nTravis Scott said: “El Clásico is a moment the whole world taps into. Teaming up with Spotify and FC Barcelona lets me merge my universe with theirs. This wasn’t just about throwing Cactus Jack on a jersey. It’s about building something that blurs the line between sound and sport. Being the first artist to perform in Barcelona as part of this collaboration and sharing that moment with my fans just takes it to another level.”\nFC Barcelona player Jules Kounde said: “As a long time Travis and someone who cares about style, this collaboration with Spotify is powerful. Seeing the Cactus Jack logo on our jersey and being part of a drop that blends football with fashion and music is something that I’m hugely inspired by and I’m proud to be part of a club that embraces that.”\nJoan Laporta, President of FC Barcelona said: \"The logo change for El Clásico is the clearest example of how the alliance between Spotify and FC Barcelona is capable of generating conversations that go beyond the world of sports. It reflects the Club’s desire to interact with our fans in a novel way and brings us closer to new audiences around the world, allowing us to share who we are and what we stand for. In this Clásico, which could be decisive for the season, we welcome a global figure like Travis Scott to the family of artists who have had their names featured on our jersey in one of the most important sporting events on the planet.\"\nMarc Hazan, Vice President, Partnerships and Marketing, Spotify said: \"What we're doing here is giving artists a stage unlike any other. This collaboration with Travis Scott, alongside FC Barcelona, is our most ambitious project to date. A global icon co-curating with us for the world’s biggest game and performing live for fans in Barcelona - that’s the power we’re unlocking. It's a real expression of what drives Spotify and FC Barcelona: a deep, unwavering commitment to the fans.\"\n- label.aria.viber Viber\n- label.aria.whatsapp WhatsApp\n- label.aria.twitter Twitter\n- label.aria.facebook Facebook\n- label.aria.messenger Messenger\n- label.aria.link label.aria.tick Copy link",
