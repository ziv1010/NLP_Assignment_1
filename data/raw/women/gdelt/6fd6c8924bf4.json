  "body_text": "This story is from Texas Monthly’s archives. We have left the text as it was originally published to maintain a clear historical record. Read more here about our archive digitization project.\nIt’s true—the rich are getting richer. While most Texans continue to battle the slump, the fortunes of Texas’ megarich are on the rise. In 1989, when our chronicle of the state’s richest people began, Texas was mired deep in the bust. The minimum net worth needed to make the list of the one hundred richest Texans was $100 million. But as the Texas economy improved, so did the fortunes of the Texas 100. In 1990 the minimum net worth was $120 million. This year it is up again, to $130 million. The Texas 100 of 1991 preside over total net assets of $36.7 billion. Forty-six fortunes increased, while only four went south.\nThe most telling indicator that these times are good only for the rich is that the Texas 100 has just three newcomers. Madisonville’s J. R. Parten, at 95, supplants J. Howard Marshall, 86, as the eldest Texas 100 member. Parten entered the oil business in the early twenties, and seven decades later he is still at it, recently striking a huge gas well in East Texas that bolstered an already healthy oil and gas empire. Oil widow and nationally known philanthropist Sybil Harrington of Amarillo joins the list, boosting our total of women to 21. Houston’s William Farish, who debuted in 1989’s Texas 100, returns after falling short last year.\nWhile Texans with fortunes linked to real estate and oil and gas—the traditional strongholds of wealth—are scrambling to hold their own in deflated markets, those with money in new businesses and industries are thriving. In what may be a portent of Texas’ future, the high-tech industry generated some of the greatest leaps on the list. The technology trio of Bill Hayden (CompuAdd), John Moores (BMC Software), and Michael Dell (Dell Computer) are young and on a roll. Hayden’s fortune is up $200 million, while Dell has seen a $125 million increase. Moores’s stock-based software fortune, up $140 million from 1990, is anything but soft. H.E.B. magnate Charles Butt of San Antonio, who bagged a $170 million gain this year, and Houston’s shopping center czar Jerry Moore, who racked up a $130 million increase from 1990, round out the list of the top five climbers.\nOf the four decreasing fortunes in 1991, one spiraled down spectacularly. Billionaire financier Harold Simmons, second only to Ross Perot the past two years, returns a mere multimillionaire. The corporate raider is scraping by on a net worth of $860 million, down some $840 million. Simmons’ disastrous run at Lockheed forced a stock free-fall in his publicly held holding company, Valhi, the vehicle for his takeovers and the main source of his wealth.\nThree dropped from the ranks of 1991’s top one hundred megarich: Louis Beecherl of Dallas (oil), Jesse Upchurch of Fort Worth (Tandy Corporation), and Robert Rogers of Tyler (TCA Cable TV). For the man known in the industry as Mr. Rogers, there has been trouble in the neighborhood. Divorce came knocking on Rogers’ door; the combination of losing almost half his TCA stock and a stock slump bumped him off the list. “It’s just as well,” admits Rogers. “Maybe I won’t be solicited so much.”\nThe expertise of industry analysts and local brokers, combined with the invaluable observations of business associates close to the rich, helped us put a dollar figure on every fortune. Net worth calculations are estimates tempered by conservatism, especially where real estate and debt are involved. Private companies are valued by comparing them with similar publicly traded companies. Oil and gas assets are based on reserve estimates. Public stock holdings were priced on July 15. Assets held in ongoing family businesses are attributed to a controlling family member. In many cases, the rich themselves commented on our estimates, aiding immeasurably in refining the final figure.\nThe strong showing by the class of 1991 made it difficult for new members to crack this elite group, but meanwhile fresh fortunes are constantly building toward eye-catching prominence. Developer David Wolff weathered Houston’s real estate doldrums, emerging with property worth some $100 million. A hidden treasure turned up this year in El Paso’s James Shelton, who sold his Cashways Building Supply and El Paso Sands to national conglomerates in the mid-eighties for some $90 million.\nSigns of a recovering economy have healed the psyche of the state’s wealthy. Weary of maintaining low profiles, the rich are ready to cast off their furtive lifestyle. Many, feeling that it once again is okay to be rich in Texas, enthusiastically echoed the sentiments of Texas 100 aspirant Robert Folsom, a Dallas developer and former mayor: “I hope someday I can call you up and tell you I’m worth $130 million.”\nHenry Ross Perot\nDallas, 61\nData Processing Systems\n$3 billion.\nPerot calls himself “the daddy of systems integration,” and few would disagree. Unable to persuade his employer, IBM, to offer services to computer-dazzled corporations, Perot left Big Blue in 1962 and fathered Electronic Data Systems to design, install, and operate computer systems. He sold EDS to General Motors in 1984 for $2.5 billion.\nBorn in Texarkana; christened Henry Ray; in fifth grade renamed Ross after father and dead brother. Dad was cotton broker and horse trader. As boy, broke horses for $ 1, strung barbed wire. Attended U.S. Naval academy; did four years in Navy before becoming computer salesman. Started EDS with $1,000, building the business with government contracts. EDS sale brought GM board seat; needled GM over excesses, driving the company to buy him out in 1986. Launched EDS competitor, Perot Systems, in 1988; family’s partnership called HWGA, for Here We Go Again. Owns vast acreage north of Fort Worth, including Alliance Airport development. Now setting sights on Japanese systems-integration market. While a Donahue guest, said a way to avoid Persian Gulf War was to “get rid of” Saddam Hussein. Indulges an interest in racing boats.\nOn his heritage: “When I find intense people who will believe anything you tell them, I make up good stories. I had a woman convinced that my family was descended from Louis XIV. Nothing could be further from the truth. After twenty minutes she finally realized I was pulling her leg. I’m exactly like most Texans. Most don’t know where they came from, but my family has been here several generations. It was bad form to ask people where they were from, because a lot came from adverse situations. You judged people by what they were.”\nPerry Richardson Bass\nFort Worth, 76\nInvestments\nSid Richardson Bass\nFort Worth, 49\nInvestments\nEdward Perry Bass\nFort Worth, 45\nInvestments\nRobert Muse Bass\nFort Worth, 43\nInvestments\nLee Marshall Bass\nFort Worth, 35\nInvestments\n$6.3 billion, UP $500 million from 1990. Estimate includes additional assets.\nPerry’s uncle Sid Richardson borrowed $40 from Perry’s mother and struck it rich wildcatting in the Keystone field. Using hired financial investors and their own wits, the Basses transformed the inheritance Uncle Sid left them in 1959 into a flourishing empire of oil and gas, real estate, and stock holdings.\nFather Perry has geology degree from Yale; only partner of mentor uncle. Taught boys business at dinner table. “The old man believed you had to bust your tail and get things done,” says a friend. “He pounded that notion into those kids.” Perry grew inheritance to $50 million by 1969; then quit to go sailing. Navigated Ted Turner’s yacht to the 1972 World Open Racing Championship. No longer sails; salmon fishes in Iceland. To celebrate fiftieth wedding anniversary to Nancy, donated $50 million to their favorite institutions. Brothers went to Yale; Lee has Wharton MBA; Sid and Bob have MBAs from Stanford, where Sid met Richard Rainwater (see page 125) later hiring him to guide Bass investments. “Sid’s a smart guy, but the smartest thing he ever did was to hang on to Rainwater,” says an associate.

Family gave $80 million to Yale last year.\nJerry J. Moore\nHouston, 63\nShopping Centers\n$900 million, UP $130 million from 1990. Moore is still collecting shopping centers and cars.\nMoore’s formula for success is as easy as 1-2-3; buy run-down properties, fix them up cheaply, and “work like hell.” After four decades of buying and renovating strip centers, Moore still rises at four and works sixteen-hour days, managing his 186 shopping centers.\nBorn in Houston to Polish Jewish immigrants. As child, worked as delivery boy and movie usher. High school dropout. Sold vacuum cleaners for twelve years; in fifties used savings to build houses, later strip centers. Attends Indianapolis 500 annually.

Doesn’t golf at resort. “I never learned. I would rather own the course and watch people play.”\nOn looking blue-collar: “My neighbor mistook me for his gardener, so I went ahead and cleaned up his yard. I got twenty-five bucks. We were at a cocktail party a few weeks later, and he kept staring. I said, ‘What’s wrong?’ He said, ‘You really look familiar.’ I said, ‘I should. I cleaned your yard.’ ”\nHarold Clark Simmons\nDallas, 60\nFinancier\n$860 million, DOWN $840 million from 1990. Simmons’ holding company’s Valhi stock plummets, courtesy of Lockheed takeover failure.\nA string of low-level jobs in the fifties taught Simmons a valuable lesson: “I didn’t want to work so hard. So I started figuring out how to make money.” With $5,000 cash and a $95,000 loan, Simmons bought a drugstore in 1960 and eventually built a chain. He sold out to Eckerd in 1973 for $50 million in stock.\nBorn in Alba; parents were schoolteachers. At 16 moved to first house with indoor plumbing. Started pre-law at University of Texas but quit program because he “was fearful of making speeches.” Played basketball for UT; earned master’s in economics. Stints with U.S. civil service, with FDIC, and as bank junior loan officer.

ClubCorp International swells with the addition of new clubs.\nDedman got hooked on the club industry after building Dallas’ Brookhaven Country Club in 1957.

Has given more than $50 million to education and medical causes.\nOn sports: “I’d rather play tennis or golf than watch somebody else perform. That’s why I gave SMU a center for lifetime sports. It was meant to get people to participate, not just like watching paid gladiators. That’s kind of what ruined Rome.”\nMargaret Hunt Hill\nDallas, 75\nInheritance (Oil and Gas)\nHaroldson Lafayette “Hassie” Hunt III\nDallas, 73\nInheritance (Oil and Gas)\nCaroline Rose Hunt\nDallas, 68\nInheritance (Oil and Gas)\n$2.2 billion.\nThe Hunt sisters survived the eighties by severing their ties to the family enterprises in 1983, and thus were unscathed by their kid brothers Bunker and Nelson’s financial woes.

My mother said, ‘He was the kind of little boy I wouldn’t let my other children play with.’ I wasn’t bad, I was just real curious. If I was told not to do something, I had to see why I couldn’t do it. Authority always bothered me.”\nJohn Jay Moores\nSugar Land, 46\nBMC Software\n$410 million, UP $140 million from 1990.

I never felt I’d be able to hold my own, to do what I wanted to do. I would have been working for him for the rest of my life.”\nBelton Kleberg “B” Johnson\nSan Antonio, 61\nInheritance (King Ranch)\n$200 million, UP $60 million from 1960.
