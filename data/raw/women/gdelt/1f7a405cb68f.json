  "body_text": "x\nOctober has been designated as National Positive Attitude Month. While people around the country find themselves dealing with varying challenges, stresses and opportunities in their everyday lives, the idea behind National Positive Attitude Month is to encourage people to view things with a \"glass half full\" perspective.\nThe NFL season has wrapped up its first quarter of the season, and several storylines have already begun to emerge across the league. This week, Yardbarker's NFL writers assembled to identify one positive development from each team as the league heads into October.\nDallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott.\nJerome Miron-Imagn Images\nDALLAS COWBOYS (1-2-1) | Biggest positive: Dak Prescott’s high-level play | The Cowboys would be 0-4 if it weren’t for their No. 1 quarterback keeping them in games late. Dallas leads the league in offense with 404.3 yards per game and ranks last in the league in defense, allowing 420.5 yards per game. Prescott leads the NFL in passing yards (1,119) and, in Week 4, led the offense to 40 points just to get a tie and avoid a loss.\nNEW YORK GIANTS (1-3) | Biggest positive: Rookies providing hope | The rookie trio of quarterback Jaxson Dart, running back Cam Skattebo and outside linebacker Abdul Carter isn’t just giving hope for the future, but hope for the rest of the season. All three started their first game together in Week 4 and contributed to the Giants' first win. Carter has the 11th most quarterback pressures (19) so far this season, and if the trio continues to progress in the right direction, the Giants may see themselves in the win column more often than they expected.\nPHILADELPHIA EAGLES (4-0) | Biggest positive: Special teams wins games | In 2024, the Eagles didn’t block a field goal, but in 2025, they’ve already blocked two and returned one for a touchdown. In Week 4, the Eagles' special teams came up big again with a blocked punt returned for a touchdown, making Philadelphia the first team since they did it themselves in 2014 to have consecutive games with a blocked kick/punt returned for a touchdown. While special teams is often overlooked, for the Eagles, it has helped keep them unbeaten through four weeks.\nWASHINGTON COMMANDERS (2-2) | Biggest positive: Roster depth | With No. 1 running back Austin Ekler out for the year due to an Achilles injury, No. 2 running back Jacory Croskey-Merritt has done a solid job, averaging 5.9 yards per carry. Perhaps more impressively is that backup quarterback Marcus Mariota kept the team afloat while Jayden Daniels heals from a knee injury, going 1-1 in his two starts. The quality of their depth often distinguishes good teams and bad teams, and the Commanders have demonstrated that their bench players can step up when called upon.\n— Conor Killmurray\nSan Francisco 49ers middle linebacker Fred Warner.\nDarren Yamashita-Imagn Images\nARIZONA CARDINALS (2-2) | Biggest positive: Defensive line | If not for back-to-back losses via walk-off field goals, the Cardinals could be 4-0. On the bright side, the rebuilt defensive line has looked flawless with veteran Calais Campbell leading the league in sacks from an interior defender (three), while free agent signing Josh Sweat ranks third in the league among edge defenders in pass rush with a 30% win rate. Arizona’s defense has been a challenge for opposing teams so far, and that should continue with a favorable Week 5 matchup at home against the 0-4 Tennessee Titans.\nLOS ANGELES RAMS (3-2) | Biggest positive: Puka Nacua’s incredible pace | The third-year wideout has simply been sensational through five games. With 170 yards in Sunday’s win over the previously unbeaten Indianapolis Colts and another 85 against the rival Niners, Nacua has an NFL-best 588 receiving yards and 52 receptions.\nSAN FRANCISCO 49ERS (4-1) | Biggest positive: Fred Warner’s impact | Although the 49ers defense has yet to record an interception this season, it has been one of the best units in the NFL. Spearheading that defense is the veteran Warner, who has a team-high 50 total tackles to go along with two tackles for loss, three passes defended, two forced fumbles and one fumble recovery. His 17 career forced fumbles are the most in franchise history, surpassing Pro Football Hall of Famer Patrick Willis, leaving no doubt of the impact he continues to make on an elite defense.\nSEATTLE SEAHAWKS (3-1) | Biggest positive: Secondary | In addition to some highlights from its special team unit, the Seattle defense has looked much better than last season under second-year head coach Mike MacDonald, especially in the secondary. The seven interceptions are tied with the Chicago Bears for the second-most, and the 76.4 opponent average passer rating is fourth. Other than a narrow Week 1 loss to the 49ers, the Seahawks are flying high after four weeks of play.\n— Colby Colwell\nChicago Bears wide receiver Rome Odunze.\nStephen R. Sylvanie-Imagn Images\nCHICAGO BEARS (2-2) | Biggest positive: Rome Odunze’s breakout | No one is happier to have head coach Ben Johnson in town than Odunze, who’s already thriving in Chicago’s new offensive system. Through four games, the second-year wide receiver has 20 catches, 296 yards and five touchdowns. Caleb Williams officially has his No. 1 target for years to come.\nDETROIT LIONS (3-1) | Biggest positive: Offense without Ben Johnson | Speaking of Johnson, Lions fans were begging for him to come back after the offense managed just 13 points and 3.8 yards per play against the Packers in Week 1. Since then, though, Detroit scored 52 points against the Bears, 38 against the Ravens and 34 against the Browns, mixing in a ton of creative play calls along the way. The Lions, which now lead the NFL in points per game (34.3), look like they’ll be just fine without Johnson calling the shots.\nGREEN BAY PACKERS (2-1-1) | Biggest positive: Passing game | Green Bay’s passing offense, which ranks fourth in the NFL in yards per attempt (8.3), has been one of the most efficient in the league this season. Jordan Love leads the NFL in adjusted EPA per play (0.356) and ranks second in completion percentage (76.4 percent) and fifth in success rate (53.0 percent). This passing attack is a nightmare for opponents to prepare for because Love spreads the ball around so effectively.\nMINNESOTA VIKINGS (2-2) | Biggest positive: Secondary | The Vikings aren’t getting the quarterback play they need to reach their goals, but the pass defense will keep them competitive in most games. Minnesota’s defense ranks first in the NFL in dropback EPA (-0.272) and third in passing yards allowed per game (151.5) through four weeks. Cornerback Isaiah Rodgers has been one of the best in the business this year, as he’s already recorded two forced fumbles, one fumble recovery, one interception and two defensive touchdowns.\n— Jack Dougherty\nJeffrey Becker-Imagn Images\nATLANTA FALCONS (2-2) | Biggest positive: Running back Bijan Robinson | The third-year back has been among the league’s most dynamic players through four weeks and is on pace for 2,482 yards from scrimmage. Based on his current production, Robinson is on track to become the fourth player in NFL history with 1,000 rushing yards and 1,000 receiving yards in the same season, joining Roger Craig (1985), Marshall Faulk (1999) and Christian McCaffrey (2019). (h/t Stathead)\nCAROLINA PANTHERS (1-3) | Biggest positive: Run blocking | The surface numbers say otherwise — the Panthers are averaging 3.9 yards per carry, No. 23 in the NFL — but Carolina’s run–blocking has been a strength through four games, entering Week 5 No. 7 in ESPN’s run-block win rate rankings. Among 43 qualifying backs, offseason free-agent acquisition running back Rico Dowdle ranks last in rush yards over expected (RYOE) per attempt (-1.5), according to NFL Pro data, further illustrating the Panthers’ unimpressive rushing numbers aren’t a result of struggles up front.\nNEW ORLEANS SAINTS (0-4) | Biggest positive: Quarterback development | While New Orleans is the last winless NFC team, the season hasn’t been a complete dumpster fire, with quarterback Spencer Rattler taking meaningful steps in the right direction, increasing his completion percentage from last season 10.1 percentage points, throwing more touchdowns and fewer interceptions and trusting his legs more as a runner. The Saints might be in the market for a quarterback with more upside in the 2026 NFL Draft, and Rattler’s growth is a positive sign that head coach Kellen Moore will be able to develop whoever his franchise quarterback is.\nTAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS (3-1) | Biggest positive: Run defense | Tampa Bay is the only team in the NFL to hold its first four opponents under 100 rushing yards, and it also ranks second in the league in yards allowed per rush attempt (3.3), which is a remarkable accomplishment considering it’s faced two of the league’s best running backs, Saquon Barkley and Bijan Robinson. The staunch Bucs run defense is nothing new, with the unit holding its last 13 opponents (including playoffs) under 100 rushing yards, the league’s longest active streak.\n— Eric Smithling\nNew England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye.\nBrian Fluharty-Imagn Images\nBUFFALO BILLS (4-0) | Biggest positive: A strong start | With 30 or more points scored in each of the team’s first four games, the undefeated Bills are off to their best start since 1992, when they represented the AFC in Super Bowl XXVI. After opening the season with a one-point victory over the Baltimore Ravens, the Bills have outscored opponents 92-50 while posting the second-most yards per game (404.0) of any team.\nMIAMI DOLPHINS (1-3) | Biggest positive: Post-Tyreek Hill plans | Hill’s season-ending knee injury was hard to watch , but with no guaranteed money beyond 2025, Miami has no reason to keep the 31-year-old receiver and can save $28M against next year’s cap by letting him go. Despite the team’s 27-21 victory over the New York Jets on \"Monday Night Football,\" the Dolphins are clearly not ready for primetime and can put Hill’s money to good use as they look to rebuild in 2026.\nNEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS (2-2) | Biggest positive: Drake Maye is OK | New England’s 42 points scored against Carolina were a career-high for Maye and the most since the team beat the Jacksonville Jaguars 50-10 in 2021. The second-year quarterback went 14-17 for 203 yards and two scores against the Panthers on Sunday, finishing with a career-best 155.6 quarterback rating, and is currently the NFL’s sixth-leading passer with 988 yards.\nNEW YORK JETS (0-4) | Justin Fields’ legs | Only the Bills (654) and Commanders (619) have run for more yards than the Jets (578), who average 5.2 yards per carry without a top-10 rusher. Running back Breece Hall ranks 19th with 238 yards, but among quarterbacks, only Philadelphia’s Jalen Hurts has more yards (179) than Fields, who ran for 81 yards and a score against the Dolphins and led the team in rushing in two of his first three starts.\n— Bruce Ewing\nJayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images\nDENVER BRONCOS (2-2) | Biggest positive: Pass-rushing duo |\nPer the team’s Instagram page, Jonathon Cooper has said he and fellow LB Nik Bonitto are “always in a race to the quarterback.” Bonitto holds a slight lead in the contest with 4.5 sacks in four games, but Cooper isn’t far behind with 2.5. The friendly competition has benefited Denver, which leads the league in sacks (15).\nKANSAS CITY CHIEFS (2-2) | Biggest positive: WR Xavier Worthy is back | With Worthy back in the lineup, the Chiefs' 12th-ranked passing attack (221.8 YPG) should regain its footing. After missing two games because of a dislocated tight shoulder, Worthy had five receptions for 83 yards in a 37-20 Week 4 win over the Baltimore Ravens. In his postgame news conference, Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes said Worthy showed he’s a do-everything WR and expects him to remain in that role for the rest of the season.\nLAS VEGAS RAIDERS (1-3) | Biggest positive: Rookie RB Ashton Jeanty’s returning to his pre-snap stance at Boise State | On Monday, Raiders head coach Pete Carroll said he “loved” Jeanty going back to his college pre-snap stance in Week 4 against the Chicago Bears. Unlike most RBs who stand like a basketball player playing defense, the Boise State product stood with his hands at his sides. It clearly made a difference, as he rushed for a season-high 138 yards and one TD on 21 carries in the 25-24 loss to Chicago.\nLOS ANGELES CHARGERS (3-1) | Biggest positive: Third-year WR Quentin Johnston’s breakout | Johnston was considered a potential bust after struggling with drops in his first two seasons. Now, the 2023 first-rounder is becoming one of the league’s more productive receivers. Through four games, the TCU product ranks third in the league in receiving yards (337) and is tied for third in TD catches (four).\n— Clark Dalton\nPittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.\nKirby Lee-Imagn Images\nBALTIMORE RAVENS (1-3) | Biggest positive: The offense is still dynamic | Even with the 1-3 record, you can’t really put much blame on quarterback Lamar Jackson and the offense. They have scored at least 20 points in every game, 30 points in three games and 40 points in two games. That will suffer a bit if Jackson misses some time, but the offense has played well enough to be at least 3-1 instead of 1-3 at this point.\nCINCINNATI BENGALS (2-2) | Biggest positive: Ja’Marr Chase is still great |\nThere has been nothing overly impressive about the Bengals' 2-2 start, especially after the last two games without quarterback Joe Burrow. Positives are few and far between here, but Chase is still having a great season with 26 catches and 264 yards, putting him on a pace for 110 catches and 1,122 yards over 17 games.\nCLEVELAND BROWNS (1-3) | Biggest positive: The rookie class looks strong |\nThis was always going to be a long year for the Browns and another rebuilding year, and that’s why it’s so important that their rookie class has already made a big impact. Defensive lineman Mason Graham, linebacker Carson Schwesinger and running backs Quinshon Judkins and Dylan Sampson have all already made impacts, and now quarterback Dillon Gabriel is getting his opportunity.\nPITTSBURGH STEELERS (3-1) | Biggest positive: Aaron Rodgers still has something left | Rodgers may not be the MVP-level player he was at his peak for the Green Bay Packers, but there is at least something left in his arm and he is giving the Steelers the best quarterback play they have had in at least five or six years. They do not need him to be MVP Aaron Rodgers; they just need him to be a good, capable NFL quarterback. That’s what they are getting.\n— Adam Gretz\nIndianapolis Colts quarterback Daniel Jones.\nSteve Roberts-Imagn Images\nHOUSTON TEXANS (1-3) | Biggest positive: An elite pass rush | Houston has arguably the best pass-rush duo in the NFL with Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter. The two have combined for seven sacks on the season and helped Houston shut out the Titans 26-0 in Week 4. The Texans lead the NFL with just 12.8 points allowed per game, and their ability to get after the quarterback has overwhelmed opposing offenses.\nINDIANAPOLIS COLTS (3-1) | | Biggest positive: The rebirth of QB Daniel Jones | Jones threw his first two interceptions of the season in a Week 4 loss to the Rams, but he has been outstanding overall with the Colts. The former first-round pick has completed 71.9 percent of his passes for 1,078 yards, which ranks third in the NFL. Jones has also accounted for seven touchdowns and has Indy looking like one of the surprise teams of 2025.\nJACKSONVILLE JAGUARS (3-1) | | Biggest positive: Having a nose for the football | The Jaguars lead the NFL through four games with a plus-nine turnover margin. They have a whopping 13 takeaways, including nine interceptions. LB Devin Lloyd had three picks and cornerback Jourdan Lewis, who signed a $30M deal with Jacksonville in free agency, has two. New HC Liam Coen’s team is off to a hot start primarily because it has forced opposing teams into mistakes.\nTENNESSEE TITANS (0-4) | | Biggest positive: LB Cedric Gray’s development | Following an injury-plagued rookie season in 2024, Gray has emerged as a potential anchor of Tennessee’s defense. He had a career-high 17 total tackles (10 solo) in Week 4 and ranks 12th in the NFL in total tackles through four games. Gray, a former fourth-round pick out of North Carolina, looks like he could develop into one of the best linebackers in football.\n— Steve DelVecchio\nMore must-reads:\n- Giants players hilariously give their best Cam Skattebo impressions\n- Giants DL suggests teammate could be NFL's best pass-rusher\n- The 'Super Bowl winning coaches' quiz\n+\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
