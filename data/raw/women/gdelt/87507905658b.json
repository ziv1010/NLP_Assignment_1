It has undoubtedly served her well, with her impressive record boasting a European Championship win with the Netherlands, plus a World Cup final appearance in 2019, before another Euros win with England last year.\nHowever, the circumstances surrounding the Lionesses at this World Cup now demand a degree of adaptability and a willingness to experiment in the quest for global glory.\nIn contrast to last summer, where England entered with a cohesive and settled lineup, the team's current campaign has been marred by injuries to key players. Notably, the absence of Beth Mead, the captaincy void left by Leah Williamson, and the creative spark of Fran Kirby have all disrupted the team's balance. Furthermore, the retirement of two senior players, Jill Scott and Ellen White, has added to the selection conundrum, leaving Wiegman with several critical positions to fill.\nThe recent performances, both before and during the tournament, including a goalless draw against Portugal and a narrow 1-0 win over Haiti, have highlighted a lack of standout performers.\nSome players are relatively secure in their roles, but other positions are yet to witness an individual truly stake their claim - not like it was during the Euros. It raises the pertinent question: does England have anyone who is truly undroppable?\nWith several talented players eager to seize their opportunities, Wiegman should consider tweaking the lineup. This willingness to adapt and experiment could prove instrumental in overcoming the challenges that will be posed in the knockout rounds, where the stakes are significantly higher (should, of course, England make it...they are strong favourites, but nothing is gauranteed in football!).\nOne area of concern is up top, where Alessia Russo has been leading the attack. While Russo has shown promise, and was a major part of England's Euros win when coming off the bench, her lack of goals in recent matches raises questions about her ability to fill the void left by the retired White.\nIn contrast, Rachel Daly, who enjoyed a prolific domestic campaign in the WSL, scoring 22 goals in 22 games for Aston Villa to equal the league's all-time single season record, is pushing for her chance and offers a strong alternative.\nREAD THE LATEST LIONESSES WOMEN'S WORLD CUP 2023 NEWS HERE\nWhen asked if she was frustrated to not start, Daly told reporters: “I think anyone would be. No one is happy to sit on the bench.\n“If you are, then you are not in the right place, not in the right career. It’s a tough place for Sarina to be, to pick the team. I respect her decisions and I will support Alessia all the way and obviously I know Beth [England] will do the same.\n“I think everybody is digging out for a position. It’s a headache Sarina has to have in multiple positions. I wouldn’t like to be in her shoes obviously making such big decisions coming into tournaments. But she’s a fantastic manager, we respect all of her decisions.\n“I mean you could put it [the lack of goals] down to a number of things, but I think we are quite a new side, a relatively new side.\n“We have lost a lot of players through injury, retiring. We are still building, but I don’t think it’s a worry and a concern at the minute. Hopefully, more will come.\"\nSimilarly, the right-wing position presents a dilemma. Chloe Kelly is seen by Wiegman as the replacement for Mead, but could Lauren James make more of an impact there? Or could James play in the number 10 role, displacing Ella Toone? Does Lauren Hemp provide the attacking output that's needed, or is could she be replaced as well?\nAt the back, Wiegman may also be considering where Alex Greenwood best fits in her starting XI. Does she play at full-back, or would she help sure up England's defence as a centre-back alongside Millie Bright?\nIncorporating changes in the lineup should not imply a lack of trust in the settled players who have performed well in the past. Embracing flexibility and providing opportunities for other players to showcase their abilities keeps the entire squad motivated, creating a sense of healthy competition.\nAs England prepare to face Denmark in their second group game, Wiegman faces a delicate balancing act. While the temptation to maintain a consistent lineup is strong, the importance of experimenting with different options cannot be overlooked. In fact, it could prove crucial for the latter stages. England has some of the best players in the world - it's time to see them play.\nLISTEN NOW TO 90MIN's FOOTBALL CLIMATE CONVERSATION PODCAST\nFormer Italy international Arianna Criscione, Dulwich Hamlet's Brittany Saylor and Football for Future founder Elliot Arthur-Worsop join Katie Cross to have football's climate conversation about the Women's World Cup and tournament football's carbon footprint.
