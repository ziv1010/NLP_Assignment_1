  "body_text": "The Canberra Raiders want to see how the pre-season trials and opening rounds go before deciding whether to take up Jamal Fogarty's contract option for 2026.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nThey have until round six to take up the mutual option for next year, meaning there's no rush to do so.\nFogarty also has an option in his favour that he can decide to accept.\nThe Green Machine have added former Parramatta halfback Ethan Sanders to their playmaking stocks and he'll likely get his first chance in lime green during the upcoming pre-season trials.\nCanberra will play the Penrith Panthers - at Shark Park on February 8 - and then Cronulla - at Canberra Stadium on February 13 - with Raiders coach Ricky Stuart usually preferring to only play his round-one team in one of his trials.\nIt's a similar situation to their hookers - with both Tom Starling and Danny Levi off-contract at the end of the year - with the Raiders wanting to see how the season starts before making any offers.\nIn further NRL contract news, the Raiders' interest in Gold Coast prop Josiah Pahulu has cooled with the 20-year-old no longer a recruitment target.\nFogarty was a late bloomer in the NRL and didn't establish himself in the NRL until he was 26, during the 2020 season with the Gold Coast Titans.\nNow the Green Machine have followed a similar path with their latest playmaking addition.\nThe Raiders have signed 27-year-old halfback Georgia Thomas to their NRLW squad for the upcoming campaign.\nShe'll be one of the options to cover the loss of half Ash Quinlan to Canterbury this season.\nThe Raiders also have Sereana Naitokatoka and Ella Ryan as other playmaking options on their books.\nThomas is a teacher at Kiama High, who played halfback for St George in the NSW Women's Premiership last year.\nShe's played Oztag for Australia and will move to Canberra for pre-season in May.\nRaiders coach Darrin Borthwick said Thomas caught his eye playing for the Dragons last year.\n\"She's a hard worker and a good talent, I'm really pleased that she is coming here and that's a good reward for her on the backend of a good season last year,\" he said.\n\"That's testament to the women's game, is that our players do take a different route and spend a bit of time working on their craft.\n\"She's someone that's done that and this is a really good reward for her and an opportunity that I know that she's really keen to take.\n\"She's got good skill and I'm really looking forward to working with her and seeing what she can do with this opportunity.\"\nThomas grew up playing Oztag and touch football in Wollongong, before shifting into league tag and Nines.\nLast year was her first in the NSW Women's Premiership and now she'll get a chance to step up to the NRLW.\n\"I'm so excited, there's so much talent already in the team. I'm just excited to meet everyone,\" Thomas said.\n\"Everyone that I've met at the club really suits my personality and morals and values, which is really important to me because I want to play for a club that not only the players but staff are all on the same level.\"\nSavage official: Flyer signs two-year extension\nIt was Xavier Savage's best season yet, but the Canberra Raiders flyer vows he's still got more to give.\nThe Raiders officially announced Savage has re-signed with the Green Machine for two more years, after The Canberra Times revealed last week the deal keeping him in the capital until 2027 was basically done.\nIt locks in another young gun at Canberra as coach Ricky Stuart continues to invest in youth to rejuvenate the team.\nSavage enjoyed a breakout 2024 NRL campaign after shifting from fullback to the wing - initially to team up with good mate and centre Sebastian Kris.\nHe was the Raiders' top scorer last season, scoring 15 tries from his 24 games.\nThe 22-year-old also averaged 137 run metres per game as he made one of Canberra's wings his own.\nWhile Savage was happy with how he went this year, he's set his sights on becoming even better in the years to come as the Green Machine looks to return to the top eight.\n\"I'm clearly very happy here and I am happy to stay here with the Raiders,\" he said.\n\"I'm just glad that the deal is done and I'm locked in for a further two years. I just can't wait.\n\"I'm very happy with how I went last year but I've definitely got a lot more left in the tank.\n\"Now it's time to keep training hard and turn it up again next year. It's exciting.\n\"This has become my second home now. I love Canberra and I'm trying to build a legacy down here.\"\nRaiders chief executive Don Furner was excited by Savage's potential.\nHe's one of a number of young guns wearing lime green, along with the likes of Ethan Strange, Kaeo Weekes, Chevy Stewart and Ata Mariota.\nPlus they have a slightly older group of now established NRL stars in Hudson Young, Matthew Timoko, Kris and Corey Horsburgh.\n\"We've always known Xavier had the talent to make it in the NRL, but this year in particular he showed the club his desire to work hard and take his game to the next level,\" Furner said.\n\"Xavier is still very young at age 22 and we know he still has his best football in front of him and we're happy it's with the Raiders.\"\nSAVAGE DEAL ALL-BUT DONE\nThe Canberra Raiders have all-but finalised Xavier Savage's contract extension and could know where they stand with target Leo Thompson next week.\nIt's believed Savage is on the verge of recommitting to the Green Machine until at least the end of 2027 with a deal basically done.\nThompson has met the Raiders, but has been on holidays following his international duty for New Zealand.\nThe 24-year-old's links to Canberra have the Green Machine as a genuine option to recruit the Kiwis prop.\nNot only has Thompson played for the Raiders - in NSW Cup and Jersey Flegg Cup - but his partner is from the capital.\nHe's regularly back in Canberra visiting friends and family. Thompson has been on holiday, and it's believed he'll start to make a decision about his future once he gets back.\nThere are several options on his table. He could remain with the Newcastle Knights, where he's played 64 NRL games following his debut in 2022.\nIt's believed Thompson's only considering a select few clubs, with Canterbury and the Dragons potentially the other options to Canberra.\nHe's contracted to the Knights for next year, with Newcastle desperate to keep him long-term.\nBut he's free to talk to other clubs about signing on for 2026 and beyond.\nThat could see him as the perfect replacement for veteran Canberra prop Josh Papali'i, who might hang up the boots at the end of next year.\nHe'd also be another young player among a group of emerging stars, along with the likes of Hudson Young, Ethan Strange, Matt Timoko and Savage.\nSavage was also free to talk to other clubs, given his contract runs out at the end of 2025.\nBut he looks set to re-sign for a couple more years with the winger emerging as the Raiders' leading try scorer last season.\nMeanwhile, the Raiders have re-signed England international Hollie-Mae Dodd for another two seasons, keeping her with the NRLW team until the end of 2026.\nDodd was a foundation Raiders player, but tore her anterior cruciate ligament in her maiden campaign.\nShe returned this year after her knee reconstruction and also returned to playing for England last month.\nThe 21-year-old will now be in Canberra for another two years, alongside fellow England internationals Morgan Smithies and Matty Nicholson.\nNicholson started his first pre-season with the Green Machine on Monday.\n\"I'm so excited to have signed with the Raiders for a further two years,\" Dodd said.\n\"I have loved being part of this club and I'm so keen to be back alongside the girls.\n\"It's a dream I've had since being young playing in the NRLW so I'm super grateful for the Raiders and love pulling on the green jersey.\"\nGreen Machine's $1.9m war chest\nThe Canberra Raiders will head into the free agency period armed with a signing war chest of almost $2 million.\nNewcastle Knights and New Zealand prop Leo Thompson could be the recipient of some of that Canberra cabbage when he comes off contract on Friday.\nThe Raiders have also been on the lookout for a hooker, having tried to lure Warrington rake Danny Walker to the capital.\nBut The Canberra Times revealed the Raiders had walked away from negotiations due to the Wolves' \"ridiculous\" transfer fee.\nCould they make a play for one of the NRL's top hookers who come off-contract when the clock ticks over to November 1?\nQueensland hooker Reece Robson's contract runs out at the end of the 2025 campaign, as does Sydney Roosters rake Brandon Smith.\nNewcastle No.9 Jayden Brailey is also free to talk to other clubs come Friday.\nCanberra could have some considerable coin to enter the market with given Corey Harawira-Naera's contract runs out at the end of next year and it could be Raiders great Josh Papali'i's final season in the NRL.\nPlus, the Green Machine was unlikely to offer hooker Danny Levi an extension beyond next season.\nThat frees up about $1.9 million from their salary cap for 2026 and beyond.\nSome of that will obviously be eaten up by upgrades for players like winger Xavier Savage, who the Raiders were trying to lock down before he became a free agent.\nBut the rest could be used to target players like Cowboys hooker Robson, Smith and Thompson.\nThe Raiders have also been linked to Melbourne Storm utility Tyran Wishart.\nWishart's contracted for 2025, but the Storm also has an option in its favour for the '26 campaign as well.\nThe Raiders have reportedly had their inquiries over Wishart's services rejected, with Melbourne keen to keep him down south long term.\nWishart can play fullback and in the halves, but his value to the Green Machine could be at hooker.\nCanberra only has Tom Starling and Levi with NRL experience at dummy half on its books.\nWishart's Storm teammate Ryan Papenhuyzen's another who might be worth the Raiders making a play for.\nThe Melbourne fullback is set to test the market after the Storm offered him a reduced contract in the wake of his recent injury woes.\nAt his best, Papenhuyzen's one of the most electrifying custodians in the game - although it is an area where the Raiders do have emerging talent.\nKaeo Weekes has shown his potential this year, while Canberra also has young gun Chevy Stewart coming through the ranks.\nThe Raiders are interested in bringing Thompson back to the capital - the prop played Jersey Flegg Cup for the club in 2020-21 and also played 12 NSW Cup games in '21 before joining the Knights.\nHe's in camp with the New Zealand Kiwis as they prepare to play Tonga in the Pacific Championships in Auckland on Saturday.\nEarlier in the week, Thompson said he would worry about his future when he'd finished with the internationals.\n\"I haven't thought about it at all,\" he told 1News.\n\"My focus is here at the Kiwis and once I finish up I'll have a think about it.\"",
