According to the BBC, the goalie wanted to publish a statement confirming her sexuality in order that it doesn't distract from other themes in the book, including her struggles with mental health.\nHer manager told the BBC the former Manchester United player wanted to share her story \"in her own way\".\n\"After the World Cup, the outpouring of love and support really showed Mary the impact she's had, and she was deeply touched by it,\" she said.\n\"By sharing details of her life away from football - something she's never done before - Mary is telling her story in her own way. It's honest and authentic.\"\nEarps was promised a 'full tribute' to recognise her 'international career and her significant contribution to English football' after she chose to call time on her stint with the Lionesses before the summer's Euros.\nSince then several games and international windows have come and gone without Earps being recognised and the 31-year-old, who is now playing her football with PSG, declined an FA invitation to hold the tribute before the Lionesses' friendly against China at Wembley on November 29.\nThe Daily Mail reports that discussions have taken place between Earps and her representatives. She has declined on this occasion due to a scheduling conflict but talks are expected to resume after next week's World Cup qualification draw. An FA source insisted that they remain committed to a tribute to Earps and that it is merely a scheduling matter.",
