  "body_text": "The day before what would have been the biggest race of his college career, Jordan MacIntosh was undecided whether he could stomach tuning in from home.\n“It might be hard to watch,” he said.\nHe should be there, you know?\nOver the course of the track and field season, the Portland State senior was the eighth fastest in the West region in his event, the 3,000-meter steeplechase. The top 48 qualified for this weekend’s NCAA regional championship, which is a precursor to the NCAA championships next month in Austin, Texas.\n“I pictured this race in my head for the whole year,” MacIntosh said, “That’s the pinnacle of what we train for. Make the national championship. That’s what I’ve been talking about all the year and I set myself up well for it.”\nBut instead of being on the starting line in Sacramento, MacIntosh will be at home in Portland, suffering the consequences of his coach’s inability to ensure the Vikings participated in the minimum number of meets to be eligible.\n“It’s punishing the one person who doesn’t really have control of the situation,” he said.\nNow, athletes get disqualified for all sorts of things, especially in track. At last year’s world championships in Eugene, former Oregon wide receiver Devon Allen was disqualified in the 110-meter hurdles for starting 0.001 seconds too soon after the starting pistol. It’s a fickle sport.\nBut rarely has an athlete been so badly betrayed by the institution he represents.\nPortland State failed Jordan MacIntosh.\nWhether it was inattention or ineptitude, head coach David Hepburn bears the entirety of the blame here. His utter negligence of basic rules of competition ensured that PSU’s top men’s contender would be ineligible for the postseason and his dream of becoming an All-American.\nThat’s a hard one to explain away.\nHepburn, a former decathlete at the University of Oregon under legendary coach Bill Dellinger, did not respond to an email seeking comment, and a program spokesperson said no coaches would be addressing the situation. John Johnson, Portland State’s athletic director, said his department was still investigating.\nTo be eligible for the postseason, NCAA bylaws require programs have a minimum of 14 athletes compete in eight meets between the indoor and outdoor seasons — as far as bars to clear, this isn’t exactly Mondo Duplantis-level stuff.\nMacIntosh said that he became aware that he was ineligible last Thursday, about 30 minutes after the deadline to register for the regional championships.\nOriginally from Thunder Bay, Ontario, MacIntosh grew up playing hockey and tennis. It wasn’t until his junior year in high school that he became serious about track. That year, he won the under-18 1,500 meters at the Canadian championships.\nHe went on to run mid-distances at the University of Minnesota, and two years ago was a graduate transfer to Portland State, where Josh Seitz, then an assistant coach who has since left for a job at Oregon, recruited him.\nIt was as a Viking that he took up the steeplechase, the nearly two-mile race with 28 hurdles and seven water jumps.\nHis personal best of 8 minutes, 35.44 seconds is a school record. He ran 8:39.01 at the Stanford Invitational and easily qualified for NCAA regionals. His time put him in position to potentially advance to the NCAA championships.\nWould he have won the national title?\nUnlikely.\nBut the top 16 of 24 competitors earn All-America honors, which was very much within reach.\nThe Vikings women’s team fulfilled the eligibility requirements and are competing in Sacramento this weekend. But MacIntosh was denied that opportunity.\nVikings associate AD Matt Billings filed a waiver request on his behalf to the NCAA’s Legislative Relief Waiver Office. It was denied. On Sunday night, MacIntosh learned an appeal of that decision had also been rejected.\n“We had all hands on deck,” Johnson said. “We exhausted every opportunity and avenue that we had to help the student-athlete. But at the end of the day they denied it, and the NCAA rule is the NCAA rule.”\nA spokesperson for the NCAA, Greg Johnson, called MacIntosh’s situation “an unfortunate set of circumstances.” But, he said, there are 24 NCAA championship sports. All of them have minimum competition requirements.\nAnd even if Hepburn didn’t know what it was in his own sport, it just so happens that MacIntosh did.\nAfter the Vikings lost several athletes to the transfer portal in the winter and early spring, MacIntosh said he approached Hepburn.\n“I spoke to him and asked if this was going to be a problem for us,” MacIntosh said, “because I looked at our schedule, and I knew we missed one of (the meets). And he pretty much just told me not to worry about it, like he’s got it under control.\n“And then I think it was either the first or the second outdoor meet that I counted the numbers and I realized we missed it again.”\nThere are always more sides to a story. And I’d bet Hepburn has torn himself to pieces over this already.\nThe requirements for postseason eligibility fluctuated during the pandemic. MacIntosh said Hepburn recruited football players to the track team this spring to try to boost numbers.\nHepburn runs an underfunded, non-revenue sport at a university that struggles for attention and support.\nI feel that.\nBut Johnson, the first-year athletic director, is going to have to decide what kind of program Portland State should have in, essentially, the state sport.\n“We’re evaluating,” Johnson said. “I don’t evaluate programs until after the season. We’re still competing. I’ll continue to go through that process like I do every sport.”\nHow can Hepburn credibly tell any prospective Viking that he has their best interests at heart, when MacIntosh’s case so clearly demonstrates otherwise?\nIf Hepburn is allowed to continue coaching the Vikings, you can be sure this is one mistake that won’t be made again. Surely, a painstaking amount of attention will be given to meeting eligibility requirements to avoid another fiasco like this.\nBut for MacIntosh, there is no recourse. No redemption. He is the one person to suffer consequences of ineffective leadership. There is no penalty for the university or the track program. Just the lost exposure of being represented by one its brightest stars on the sport’s biggest collegiate stage.\nMacIntosh won’t have the opportunity to become an All-American, but he will certainly keep running.\nThe Olympic qualifiers are next year. And, as the third-ranked Canadian in the steeplechase, he will enter the meet as a top contender to qualify for the Paris Olympics.\nIt’s always possible he will fall short of that dream, too. But it won’t be because he was denied the opportunity to race.\n“This is not something that athletes should be dealing with,” MacIntosh said, “or having to even think about. Because coaches should be able to meet this requirement.”\n-- Bill Oram | boram@oregonian.com | Twitter: @billoram",
