  "body_text": "Manchester United Women manager Marc Skinner has spoken ahead of the FA Cup match against Burnley this weekend.\nThe Red Devils reached the final of the competition last season and will hope to go one better in 2026.\nSpeaking to the press in comments carried by the club’s official website, the manager provided an update on the fitness of several key players.\nTeam News\nSkinner revealed that, “so, obviously, Jayde’s out for a one-match ban. So, this will mean she misses this game. Only Frido (Rolfo) has a little niggle, so she’ll miss this game. Then there’s still Tooney, Gabby (George) and Leah (Galton), and then that’s it. Everybody else is fit and ready to be selected.”\nPotential first team debut\nUnited have had a busy winter window so far, signing Lea Schuller, Hanna Lundkvist and Ellen Wangerheim.\nSpeaking on potential starts, he stated, “Lea [Schuller] hasn’t played a 90 until since November, so she trained for a week, she’s just getting used to the team, so it’s just about introducing her slowly. Hanna, we had the same conversation. How I speak to the players is I ask them if they’re ready. And they both agreed that they’re probably not ready to start right now. But coming into the weekend, it’s probably likely that Hanna will start. We’re still assessing the front options, so I think they’ll be they’ll be ready within the next few weeks for sure.”\nExtent of Ella Toone injury\nSkinner revealed the severity of Toone’s injury by stating that, “she’ll be back before the end of the season. So, it’s probably about six to 10 weeks, depending on how it was from the point of it. So, you’re probably looking around six to eight weeks [from now], something like that. So yeah, she’ll be back before the end of the season and ready to go. We’ll be looking forward to welcoming her back.”\nHe also explained that she may be back for the European games, but it is also possible she will not be available and that it is a question of waiting and seeing.\nSkinner also asserted that the club must do what is right for her and not rush her back before she is ready to play.\nFA Cup romanticism\nHe praised his side’s recent record in the cup, having reached three consecutive finals and winning the competition in 2024.\nNonetheless, he refused to take third division opponents Burnley lightly. He commented, “so, there’s a romantic kind of feeling about this cup, but, I can’t stress enough, we can’t take it lightly. Burnley might be a couple of divisions below, but they’re an aggressive team that wants to be in the WSL. I think their ownership have been very clear on that. So, we have to take this game seriously.”\nSkinner praised his team’s defensive effort in their recent 0-0 draw with Arsenal in the league, but believes his side can be much better on the ball and more aggressive than they showed at the Emirates.\nRachel Williams departure\nThe head coach also expressed his gratitude to Rachel Williams, who has now completed her move to Leicester City.\nHe said, “she’ll forever leave with my gratitude and thanks, and she’ll forever be a Red, Rachel. I can’t speak highly of her enough and, as I say, she’ll forever be a fantastic part of my memories in football, both at Birmingham and at Manchester United.”\nMared Griffiths\nUnited have recalled many of their young players on loan this winter, but one player they would like to send out is Griffiths.\nHe added, “we’d love a move for Mared in this window to be able to get her the consistency of [game] time. There’s key attributes or key kind of decisions that have to be made in youth development. It’s consistency of time and I think on the field and that exposure to that. So, that’s what’s going to happen.”\nFeatured image Michael Campanella via Getty Images\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade.
