At least 10 other financial institutions closed their windows to the billionaire real estate tycoon over his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol Hill melee. The moves came in the months after Trump left the White House in 2021, sources inside the Trump Organization told me. The stunning scale of the blacklisting is being revealed here for the first time. ... It should be reported as much as possible for the simple... -\nThe six-word plea scientists aim to send before mysterious interstellar object reaches Earth\nScientists are urging NASA to send a message to a mysterious interstellar object before it is too late. The object, known as 3I/ATLAS, is traveling on a rare retrograde path and will reach its closest point to the sun on October 29, 2025, which Harvard physicist Avi Loeb suggested could be an ideal window for a covert approach on Earth. While Loeb is not 100 percent sure 3I/ATLAS is of alien origin, he proposed communicating with it as a precaution and crafted a six-word message for the occasion. The physicist told the Daily Mail that he wants to beam, 'Hello,... -\nMinnesota Teen Says Server Forced Her to Prove Her Gender in Restaurant Bathroom\nThe 18-year-old high school student alleged the server would not let her exit the Buffalo Wild Wings restroom until she unzipped her hoodie and showed she had breasts.A Minnesota teen filed a charge of discrimination against a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant on Tuesday after she alleged that a server followed her into the women’s restroom and demanded she “prove” she was a girl. Gerika Mudra, 18, went to dinner in April with a friend in Owatonna, about an hour south of Minneapolis. When she went to the restroom, a server followed her inside and banged on the stall door while... -\nFresh blow to Starmer as Labour's approval rating slumps to its lowest EVER level - with just 13 per cent happy with government's record\nKeir Starmer was dealt a fresh blow last night as his Government's popularity sunk to its lowest level to date. The Government's approval rating slipped to minus 55, according to pollsters YouGov. Just 13 per cent of the public included in the survey said they approved of the Government's record since returning to power under Sir Keir last summer - the same percentage as the previous week. But those who disapproved slipped by another percentage point, down to 68 per cent. It meant the net approval rating lurched to a record low for this administration. The weekly poll makes grim... -\nCould a Conch Shell Be a Competitor for CPAP?\nProof-of-concept trial shows significant effect on obstructive sleep apnea symptomsKey Takeaways: *Blowing a conch shell improved moderate obstructive sleep apnea symptoms in a small randomized trial. *Sleep quality and apnea-hypopnea index also improved with conch blowing. *A larger, more diverse trial is needed to confirm the benefits observed. The forceful breathing involved in the traditional Hindu practice of blowing a conch shell, or shankh, improved moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) symptoms, a small randomized trial showed. Regular practice of the yogic breathing exercise over 6 months cut daytime sleepiness by 34% compared with baseline, as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness... -\nPolice Bust \"Spiritual Retreat\" Offering Frog Venom, Hallucinogenic Drugs in Spain\nSpanish police said Monday that they had dismantled a group accused of running a \"spiritual retreat\" that offered hallucinogenic drugs and dangerous frog venom to clients from around the world. The gang is suspected of operating from a villa in the southeastern town of Pedreguer, charging over $1,160 for multiday stays that included consumption of ayahuasca, San Pedro cactus and a frog venom known as Kambo. \"The retreats were held in groups of up to twenty participants, who were attended to by six employees of the organisation during the 'astral journeys,'\" the Guardia Civil police force said in a statement.... -\nDoes Big Pharma Deserve All the Hate?\nBinary thinking won't promote progressThis piece is the first in a series exploring the foundational players in the U.S. healthcare system: payers, providers, policymakers, and the pharmaceutical industry.Ever since Bill and Hillary Clinton advanced healthcare reform in the first term of the Clinton administration, the debate about how to improve access and affordability has been politically fraught and full of pejoratives. Everyone comes to the table with opinions and preconceived notions, many of which go unchallenged. In my classroom, I encourage my business school students to look beyond headlines, rhetoric, and reductive soundbites. Tropes like \"All that insurance companies care... -\nResearch Psychiatrist Warns He’s Seeing a Wave of AI Psychosis\nHe has an intriguing theory for why it's happening.Mental health experts are continuing to sound alarm bells about users of AI chatbots spiraling into severe mental health crises characterized by paranoia and delusions, a trend they've started to refer to as \"AI psychosis.\" On Monday, University of California, San Francisco research psychiatrist Keith Sakata took to social media to say that he's seen a dozen people become hospitalized after \"losing touch with reality because of AI.\" In a lengthy X-formerly-Twitter thread, Sakata clarified that psychosis is characterized by a person breaking from \"shared reality,\" and can show up in a... -\nJOE BIDEN REMARKABLE COMMENTS ON DC CRIME BACK IN 1992\nJOE BIDEN REMARKABLE COMMENTS ON DC CRIME BACK IN 1992. -\nMinnesota Vikings Fans Are Raging As They Threaten To Cancel Their Season Tickets Over Male Cheerleader\nSome Minnesota Vikings fans have threatened to cancel their season tickets following the team’s hiring of a male cheerleader. A new dancer named Blaize has joined the Minnesota Vikings Cheerleaders (MVC), a move that some consider to be somewhat groundbreaking. While a male football cheerleader is hardly a novelty, Blaize’s role is different. He is expected to perform the same dance-based routines as his female teammates. His inclusion on the Vikings’ official dance roster is part of a seemingly growing trend, where teams such as the Los Angeles and New Orleans Saints have welcomed males into their cheer squads. Uh... -\nDC police commander suspended, accused of changing crime statistics\nA D.C. police commander is under investigation for allegedly making changes to crime statistics in his district. The Metropolitan Police Department confirmed Michael Pulliam was placed on paid administrative leave in mid-May. That happened just a week after Pulliam filed an equal employment opportunity complaint against an assistant chief and the police union accused the department of deliberately falsifying crime data, according to three law enforcement sources familiar with the complaint. The union claims police supervisors in the department manipulate crime data to make it appear violent crime has fallen considerably compared to last year. Pulliam — the former commander... -\n[Catholic Caucus] Women Deacons? Here’s Why Not\n[Catholic Caucus] Women Deacons? Here’s Why NotThere are many in the Church who consider the ordination of women as deacons to be an unsettled question and are hopeful that the Church will admit women to the diaconate soon. This is an unfounded hope.Who can be an icon of Christ? The question haunts me. Documents of the Second Vatican Council teach that all good people who are part of the Church…all these good people relying on the exquisite promise of Christ’s resurrection are the Body of Christ. It would stand to reason, then that ‘all good people’ means precisely that. ‘All... -\nBryan Kohberger whines about being kept up at night by ‘relentless’ inmate taunts at maximum security lockup: report\nConvicted killer Bryan Kohberger has whined that he’s “extremely annoyed” and losing sleep at the maximum security prison he now calls home — thanks to fellow inmates who constantly yell through vents into his cell in a “relentless” taunting campaign, according to a report. Kohberger, who was hit with four life sentences last month for slaying four University of Idaho students, was transferred from jail to the only maximum security prison in the state and is now being held there in solitary confinement. And the prisoners at Kohberger’s new digs at Idaho Maximum Security Institution in Kuna have had it... -\nLearning About Noah, Japheth, the Ark and Betrayed Armenia\n...The following passage contains text from the book, published in 1910, Betrayed Armenia, by Armenian writer and diplomat Diana Agabeg Apgar: “The genealogy in Genesis runs thus : \"The sons of Japheth, Gomer and Magog and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meschech, and Tiras...Only the names of the three sons of Gomer, and the four sons of Javan are given in Genesis, and by these we are told were the isles of the Gentiles divided. So much for Genesis. Later history records that these Gentiles spread themselves over part of that stretch of terra firma which now goes by... -\nTrump claims another border victory after Biden auctioned wall materials for rock-bottom prices\nThe materials, which were put up for auction by former President Joe Biden, will reportedly soon be returned to Trump following a fierce legal battle... ...The material, valued between $260 million and $350 million, was auctioned on GovPlanet, an online government surplus marketplace, in 2023 after Biden halted Trump's border construction in January 2021... ...\"GovPlanet has reached an agreement, working with the Office of the Border Czar, to return border wall materials that were previously deemed surplus and sourced by the federal government to GovPlanet via existing contracts,\" the company stated. \"A third-party firm that has been contracted for construction... -\nLEO AND SYNODALITY (A Silent Implosion?) - Part II in the Series \"The First Year of Leo XIV\"\nLEO AND SYNODALITY (A Silent Implosion?) - Part II in the Series \"The First Year of Leo XIV\"This is the second of several analyses written for Rorate by our contributor Serre Verweij on Leo XIV's first year.Series: The First Year of Leo XIVII - LEO AND SYNODALITY[Part I: Leo and the Germans]As Pope Leo XIV is approaching the 100 day mark of his pontificate (today is day 97), more and more decisions are coming out which appear indicative of the course of his papacy.

On CNN, pollster Harry Enten reported that “Google searches for Epstein are down 89% from just 3 weeks ago,” “Trump's approval rating is holding steady & much higher than term 1 at this point in his presidency,” and “less than 1% say it's the nation's top issue.” “The Epstein saga,” Enten noted, “is becoming a political dud & nothingburger.” CNN’s findings confirm what many across America... -\nWhat is chain of command?

The last-minute extension came hours after Trump provided a vague response to reporters on extending the deadline on Monday. “We’ve been dealing very nicely with China… they have tremendous tariffs that they’re paying to the United States of America,” Trump said during a press conference at the White House. “We’ll see what happens. They’ve been dealing quite nicely. The relationship is very good with President Xi and myself.” Trump signed a new Executive Order later on Monday. China will now have its... -\nSCOOP: \"Thank God!\" President Trump's historic takeover of D.C.'s safety praised by residents\nPresident Donald Trump’s historic takeover of Washington, D.C.’s safety received an outpouring of support from new and longtime city residents, who told the Washington Reporter that Trump’s move is necessary for the continuing function of American government. For far too many in America’s capital city, crime has become a haven for murderers, sexual assaulters, drug markets, and more — and despite the city having plenty of redeeming places and people, the risks are outweighing the rewards for many. One female Hill staffer, who pays $3,000 a month for rent in Navy Yard, told the Reporter that she “saw someone get...\nBrowse by Forum\nGet Connected! Join Free Republic Today!\nAlready a Member?
