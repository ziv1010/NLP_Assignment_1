Once again, BBC Radio 2’s Rylan will host the show with a live voiceover from Hits Radio’s Fleur East.\nRylan says: “I’m so excited to be hosting the ARIAS again this year! Radio is a big part of my life and I know from doing my own show, it’s a big part of people’s lives around the country too. From car rides to listening while doing the dishes at home, radio and podcasts allows you to be a part of people’s day and for that reason, I love them.\n“I want to wish a big congratulations to all
