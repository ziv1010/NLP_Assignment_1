For years viewers of Love is Blind have been calling for Netflix's reality TV juggernaut to cast older participants, and we seem to have gotten our wish. Most engaged couples in Love is Blind season 7's cast are 30-somethings (a possible echo of the recent Love is Blind: UK). But, of course, the most dramatic couple of the season so far consists of the youngest man and the youngest woman from the pods: 27-year-old Hannah Jiles and 29-year-old Nick Dorka.\nNick, a smooth-talking former football player, quickly falls for Hannah, a self-described country girl who worked in medical device sales before quitting her job to go on LIB. However, the pods' biggest love triangle and lingering doubts get in the way early on. As season 7's October 23 finale gets closer, fans wonder whether Hannah and Nick will even make it to the wedding. Below, we're breaking down Hannah and Nick from Love is Blind season 7's relationship timeline, and whether they're still together after the show.\nWhat happened between Hannah and Nick on 'Love is Blind' season 7?\nNick's intro on season 7 can be summed up in two words: smooth talker. (Or, if you like the nickname Hannah gives him a bit later: Mr. Suavé.) He's admittedly flirty and leads with how he was a kicker and a punter in college. Meanwhile, Hannah can match the banter and describes herself as a small-town West Virginia girl who was a cheerleader dating the quarterback in high school. Based on the show's editing, Nick is all in on Hannah quickly, but Hannah forms connections with him and art dealer Leo Braudy.\nEven outside of the Leo of it all, Hannah has reservations about Nick. She points out that Nick always says the right thing, an orange flag that has quickly turned red in previous Love is Blind seasons. She says at one point, \"Yeah, he's sultry, but he'll probably ruin my life,\" and the other women get the same vibe. After Nick and Hannah have another superficial date (where they discuss celeb crushes and Nick says he looks like a less-buff Henry Cavill), Hannah's doubts start to come through. She worries that his rizz might be masking a manipulative side, and she voices concern about him being \"naturally flirtatious.\" She says she would not want to go to sleep without makeup on around him, and one of the women she's talking to calls that a \"walking red flag.\"\nOn their next date, Hannah voices her concerns and asks Nick why he's in the pods, and he says that he wants something genuine. She seems to have a wall up, until finally, she tells him that she's nervous he only likes her because he thinks she's hot. She has admitted that weight is a big insecurity for her, and now she has enough of a \"gut feeling\" against Nick to break things off, even though he says that she feels like \"his best friend but also his wife.\"\nAnd then, right after she breaks up with Nick, Hannah accidentally learns that her other connection, Leo, is also serious with esthetician Brittany. At the start of episode 2, Hannah chalks up her instant regret and all her conflicting feelings to confusion, and she requests another date with Nick. They're better at getting to the deep stuff when they talk again. Nick admits that he was hurt when she broke things off, and she says that she let other people's opinions of him sway hers and that she hurt him before he could potentially hurt her. From there, they talk about Nick adjusting to the future once he realized he wouldn't make the NFL, and Hannah opens up about her history with weight and why his bikini jokes affected her so much. A bit later, they trade \"I love you\"s and everything seems set for an engagement (aside from drama when Hannah tries to break things off with her other flame before Leo and Brittany get engaged.)\nDid Hannah and Nick get engaged on 'Love is Blind' season 7?\nAfter everything is settled with Leo and Hannah, Nick and Hannah have a sweet yet nervous proposal and toast to the Dorkas. But their in-person reveal is much more awkward. It turns out that Hannah had an idea of how Nick looked (whether it was the football talk or the Cavill comparison is unknown) and he's not what she expected. He's not \"really tiny,\" like she frets in her confessional, but he's a tad shorter than her in heels. After they meet, she says in the testimonial that Nick's description of himself in the pods \"wasn't really truthful.\"\nGet exclusive access to fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.\nA bit of context: Earlier, another cast member, David, revealed to Leo in the men's lounge that he and Hannah had been dating pretty seriously, and she'd even been his no. 1, but she'd \"cut him out\" after learning he was only 5'8''. (She's 5'9''.)\nAs a big and tall girl myself, I understand Hannah's concerns about her man's height and feeling like she's bigger than him. That man-big-women-tiny socialization is hard to overcome. (Also, she says that men can get emasculated due to height, which is true!) But it's tough to see her body language towards him during the reveal, and how he looks back at her when they're leaving, but she doesn't look back at him.\nAnd then there's the now-infamous duck incident. After Nick and Hannah's first night in Mexico goes well—the most-memorable moment is them discussing a possible boob job after Hannah has kids—Hannah gets the ick from Nick riding a plastic duck.\nWhile hanging out by the pool, Nick wants to ride a life-sized duck toy, and when he goes by himself, a random woman goes up to him to race him. The woman is arguably flirty, and when Hannah calls Nick back, she jokingly yells, \"Don't be jealous!\" Nick laughs and races with her anyway. And then he goes back for another round by himself. When Nick says Hannah still loves him after the duck, Hannah says, \"Maybe.\"\nThey joke about the duck, but it's not about the duck. Remember how Hannah was nervous before about marrying a naturally flirty guy? Nick even brings up the possibility that she was jealous of the random woman, but Hannah plays it cool. Fast-forward to the party where they meet the other couple, and the pair seem fine; they joke together about keeping the sex talk low-key on camera. But when Hannah's talking to the woman, she admits that the duck thing made her angry (while also exaggerating the interaction with the woman a bit). Meanwhile, Nick tells the men that he found a list Hannah made of eight to 10 of his red flags. The list included questions like, \"Too into his feelings? Maturity? Dedicated to this? Self-confidence vs. cocky? Delulu?\"\nBy the time they finally talk about the list (still during the party), they're busy trying to make the other understand why they're hurt. Hannah admits she felt bad when the woman was \"talking shit\" and he was giggling, but Nick says it was \"pointless and meaningless.\" Hannah says she sees his point of view, but still says that the moment felt disrespectful. We also don't see her answer (if she gave one) when Nick asks if she really thinks he's delusional.\nOnce they return to their suite, they pull the list out of the trash and rehash the duck incident. Still, it doesn't seem that they entirely resolve this, and they don't resolve the list itself, as the last scene of them in episode 6 includes Nick saying to Hannah, \"I'm not the only one delusional.\"\nDespite having all that drama within the first batch of episodes, Nick and Hannah show their \"ride or die\" determination by bungee jumping together. However, once they return to D.C. and move in together, they clearly have very different approaches to their home life. Nick is quite laid back about everything, while Hannah admits that it's \"her way or the highway,\" and that she's gonna struggle with sharing her space with someone more \"immature.\" She also vacuums literally every day, deep-cleans one a week, and doesn't appreciate having to tell Nick when to take out the trash or what temperature to bring the water up to boil pasta.\nHannah and Nick had very different life trajectories in their 20s, which becomes clear when they visit Nick's place. It's also his parents' place; he lives in their basement and his parents still do a lot for him, including paying his phone bill. He's loud and proud about it, explaining that he stayed in the nest longer partly due to his football trajectory (though he also could've just said \"the economy\" and waved his hands and that also would've been a valid explanation), and that he doesn't care if it's embarrassing. Meanwhile, Hannah says that she's been supporting herself since she was 18, and over their time living together she low-key hoards her knowledge and experience with bills and stocks over him. It's just two different lives clashing, but unfortunately, it clashes with Hannah talking down to Nick a lot.\nAs for meeting the family, it goes pretty well on both sides. Hannah's brother Cade is supportive and recognizes that she can dish the snide comments easier than she can take them. It's a nice moment of commiseration for Nick, and you can see that her bashing can get to him sometimes. Later he meets the rest of her family and they get along; her parents tell her to chill out and not to overthink it, but also not to underthink it. Meanwhile, Hannah charms Nick's parents, and she and his mom talk candidly about Hannah's tendency to nitpick him. In episode 10, the couple gets through a date at a climbing course, but after they finish, Hannah grills Nick on whether he's ready to get married in two weeks. Nick brings up his concern that she talks down to him a lot, and she responds, \"I think you get treated like an equal when you start contributing like an equal.\"\nDid Nick and Hannah make it to the altar on 'Love is Blind' season 7?\nThen there's Katie of it all. As Hannah and Nick prepare for the pod-reunion costume party in episode 10, Nick mentions the sports marketing manager as someone he wants \"closure\" with. Apparently, he and Katie clicked early on in the pods and \"were each other's [no.] 1s,\" but at one point he just \"never saw her again.\"\nAt the party, we get more clarity. Katie tells Nick that he was the type of guy she'd dated for the past 15 years in the real world, following the show's psychology where the pods are there to get the cast to try dating new people. Both of them say they didn't mind their age difference (Nick's 28, Katie's 36) and admit they gave each other goosebumps during their three days of dating. Katie also adds that she didn't think he was there with maturity, as he'd make some interesting comments, including saying that he \"just knows\" she's sexy, and that \"older women really fuck with him.\" She posits that it may be a \"defense mechanism, maybe coming from a place of insecurity,\" but she adds that he's a great guy and happy that she could contribute to his growth.\nNick having a 40-minute conversation with Katie during the party goes as well as you'd expect post-duck-gate. Hannah and Katie are friendly in the pods, and things seem easy-breezy as Hannah introduces Nick to Katie, but it doesn't help that Katie tells Hannah that her fiancée is \"better looking in person... in the nicest way.\" Hannah also hears Katie has been saying that to the other women, so she confronts Nick when they get home. The center of the argument is similar to duck-gate, where Nick doesn't believe he did anything wrong because Katie doesn't mean anything to him, and Hannah argues that it's about respect. This is also the fight where we get the soundbite about Hannah turning Nick from a boy into a man, if anyone's wondering how Nick's plea to be treated as an equal is going. One of his final points of the argument? \"If I tell you I love you, bet. Okay. Roll with it.\"\nThe official beginning of the end for Nick and Hannah comes when they meet a group of Hannah's friends, and the friends get to see how she's changed since the engagement. Hannah brings up duck-gate to them, and Nick admits that he feels he's trying to change his personality for this to work, even though he doesn't think he's too immature. Hannah's friends call the things that she wants Nick to do—walk the dog, take initiative in cleaning, consider her feelings—simple characteristics he needs to do to be in a relationship. Her friends come off as completely unimpressed—and this seems to be the point of no return for Hannah. In the next scene, she tells her mother that Nick doesn't match her in any aspect of her life, at the same time the women are supposed to be wedding dress shopping.\nWhen Nick arrives home, she ends things with him, listing off the same issues she's had with him since duck-gate. She makes him name his current responsibilities, and he mentions taking care of his cat... which his dad wakes up to feed in the morning. He seems mostly defensive during the conversation, claiming that Hannah is just \"throwing shade\" and talking down to him again, but Hannah says that she can't keep trying anymore. She also brings up something interesting: When she called him to give him a heads up about the breakup instead of blindsiding him, he \"tried to make up a game plan\" of how the conversation would go on camera. He apparently told her off-camera, \"I don't want you to make me look bad.\" When she finally says they aren't getting married, Nick says it's the worst he's felt in his life.\nIn the confessional, Hannah says she feels very \"manipulated,\" and claims that he was focused more on how he would look than on being open and honest with her. Meanwhile, in his solo interview, Nick says that he wanted to give it his all until the final decision at the altar, and suggests Hannah broke up with him because she was afraid he would say no. He quotes a Drake song as he claims he \"came this far to get married.\" And with a final hug, Hannah and Nick are over.\nAre Hannah and Nick still together after 'Love is Blind' season 7?\nThough we won't have the official confirmation that Nick and Hannah are no longer together until the Love is Blind season 7 finale on October 30, it seems safe to say they're no longer together. They still seem to be on good terms, as they follow each other on Instagram, but, based on their feeds, they seem to be living their separate lives.\nHannah has reflected on the pair's engagement since season 7's release. In an interview with PEOPLE, Hannah recalled that she decided to end things due to \"all these issues\" that added up over time until it \"just all came to [this] realization, we shouldn't be together.\"\nHannah also reflected on how she treated Nick during filming, admitting that she regrets handling the situation that way.\n\"Watching it back, it's a lot... The way I acted was very cruel and it was very demeaning towards him. I wish I didn't do it in that way,\" she said while insisting, \"I stand 10 toes down and what I said was the truth. And that's how I felt in the moment... I don't regret it.\"\nShe added, \"I'm really proud of myself because watching all your flaws and everything and being in a relationship in such a high-pressure and cooking environment, I had flaws. I did say things that I probably shouldn't have said, but it's just a learning experience and I realize a lot of who I am is not inherently bad, and I'm not a mean girl. It's just the way I say things is not great. And I never realized that. And that's what I realized is just to be kinder and just be more patient.... I am trying my best to be able to do that in future relationships.\"\nQuinci LeGardye is a Culture Writer at Marie Claire.
