The two Las Vegas sports stars tied the knot this weekend. Raiders' Tight End Darren Waller married Aces' guard Kelsey Plum in a Las Vegas ceremony.\nBefore the wedding, the two stars were very protective about their private life.\nBut Plum delighted fans when she posted photos of the wedding on her Instagram page. The post is indicated to be a \"paid partnership\" with Waller's Instagram page. So maybe Plum broke her own rule about keeping their lives private because this sneak peak had a sponsorship attached to it. Not unusual in celebrity land. And whatever will get the newlyweds off to a strong is good with us!\nOf course, Plum looked amazing in her fitted bodice wedding gown. Waller wore a white jacket and black tuxedo pants. His corsage of white flowers matched her bridal bouquet. You can see the two almost laughing at the alter. They look very happy together.\nThe union of these two will bring a lot of athletic prowess under one roof. Both stars are very successful in their respective fields.\nWaller was born in Maryland and raised partly in Georgia. He played football for Georgia Tech until the Baltimore Ravens drafted him in 2015. He has been with the Raiders since 2018. Waller won the 2020 Pro Bowl with the Raiders.\nPlum, a native of California, started playing basketball in high school. She joined the Aces in 2018. She won the Gold Medal in Women’s 3×3 basketball at the 2020 Summer Olympics. And she was named the WNBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2022.\nCongrats to the newest power couple in professional sports!\nAlmost 180,000 fans liked the Instagram post showing the wedding. We can safely say Waller and Plum are the most popular sports power couple since Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf. Here's to years of happiness (and success on the field/court) for the young newlyweds!\n– Wendy Rush\nTom Brady Wants To Be A Stand Up Comedian?\nIs Tom Brady looking to be the next Seinfeld?\nAccording to RadarOnline.com, the seven-time Super Bowl champion quarterback is planning a career in stand-up comedy, but his inner circle is trying to talk him out of it. A source told RadarOnline.com that \"Tom was a terrific quarterback, but he needs to toss this idea before it's too late.\"\nI can't imagine this is true, but the report comes as Tom Brady announced that he will start his job at Fox Sports in the fall of 2024 despite announcing his retirement from the NFL in February.\nTom Brady has no stand-up comedy experience, but he did star in the sports-comedy movie 80 for Brady with Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Sally Field and Rita Moreno. Some say when Fonda, Tomlin and Moreno began showing praise to Brady, it gave him the confidence to make the jump into comedy.\n\"The ladies were super nice to him and he did a nice job reading professionally written material in a small part — but stand-up comedy is a whole different league! Friends say \"he does a great impersonation of former teammate Rob Gronkowski — and his over-the-top Boston accent is hilarious.\"\nI swear, if I'm working with Tom Brady at any comedy club, and he's making more than me, I'll take him right down!\nHe spoke to FS1 host Colin Cowherd about the Fox Sports job, he said he wanted to be 100% prepared before getting in the booth. \"Decompression's important,\" Brady said. \"You're on this crazy treadmill/hamster wheel loving it at the same time. It's a daily fight… For me, I want to be great at what I do. \"Talking last week to the people at Fox Sports and the leadership there, they're going to allow me to start my Fox opportunity in the fall of 2024.\"\nTom Brady reportedly signed a 10-year contract with Fox that is worth as much as $375 million.\nWHY WOULD HE WANT TO BE AN OPENING ACT AT THE CHUCKLE HUT??!!\n-Carla Rea\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/kklz963\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/kklz963/\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/kklz963/\nSome football jokes Tom Brady might want to try. Make sure you read them, and end the punchline with a \"Ba-dum-bum -tsss\" (rimshot).\nDid you hear about the football player who needed a new uniform?\nHe went to New Jersey!\nAnd then I said - you know what happens to football players who lose their eyesight, right?\nThey become referees!\nYou know why they don't play football in the jungle?\nToo many Cheetahs!\nI met a girl at a bar, and we didn't really hit it off, so I said -\nCatch you later!\nI'll tell you how you keep a Chicago Bears fan out of your yard -\nPut up a goal post!\nYou know what you call a Buccaneer?\nA good price for corn!\nWhat do you call a Detroit Lion with a Super Bowl ring?\nA Thief!\nWhy can’t a New York Jets player get into his own driveway?\nBecause someone painted an endzone on it!\nAnd then I said to the flight attendant -\nPut me in coach!!",
