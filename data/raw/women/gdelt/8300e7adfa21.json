In other words, the virus continues to spread.”\nIn Ireland, Scoil Chaitriona in Glasnevin, Dublin, will remain closed until at least 16 March after one of its pupils became the first person in Ireland to be diagnosed with the virus. He contracted the virus after visiting one of the affected regions in Italy.\nThe diagnosis came just two days after a woman in Northern Ireland was the first person on the island of Ireland to be diagnosed with the virus. She had travelled from Dublin to Belfast by train after flying in from Italy.\nDespite this, the Chief Medical Officer at Ireland’s Department of Health, Dr Tony Holohan, said the risk of the Covid-19 infection spreading in Ireland is “low”.\nHe said sports clubs reported to have cancelled training and games had not needed to do so, such steps were “simply not necessary”, and had no basis in fact.\nHe said there are, as yet, no implications for the St Patrick’s Day celebrations.\nBut he admitted events are fast changing and could not predict what might happen over the next ten days.\nA question mark hangs over the scheduled Six Nations games between England and Italy, in Rome, and between France and Ireland, in Paris, following the cancellation of Ireland’s fixture with Italy.\nOn Monday, organisers said that all remaining matches of the 2020 Championship will go ahead as planned – unless governments order them to call the fixtures off.\nThe Irish side is due to travel to Paris to play France – which is chasing a Grand Slam – in their final game on St Patrick’s weekend (14 March).\nEngland is due to play Italy in Rome.\nThe organisers released a statement late on Monday: “The Six Nations met today in Paris to address the current situation regarding the Covid-19 Virus.\n“Six Nations and its six unions and federations are following the situation very closely with their respective governments and relevant health authorities and will strictly follow any directive given that would impact sporting events.\n“As it stands today, based on the latest information, all Six Nations matches currently scheduled are set to go ahead.\n“Six Nations is in contact with FIR and RFU regarding the possibility of relocating the Women’s and U20 Italy vs England matches to another Italian location and we will make a further announcement on this in due course.\n“However, the Italy vs England Senior Men’s match in Rome is planned to go ahead as scheduled.\n“Six Nations intends to complete all 15 games across all three championships when time allows.\n“We will refrain from making any rescheduling announcements for the time being while we keep assessing the situation.”\nIn France a number of race meetings were ordered to go ahead “behind closed doors” to minimise the risk of spreading infection.\nIn Italy last weekend’s Serie A football matches were also played behind “closed doors”.\nFormula One’s Chinese Grand Prix, on 19 April, has already been cancelled.\nBookmakers Paddy Power is taking bets that this year’s Olympic Games in Tokyo opening ceremony scheduled for 24 July will be postponed, cancelled or moved.\nBets are also being placed that next week’s first day of the Cheltenham Festival will not go ahead as planned.\nThis is despite the fact that Cheltenham and the British Horseracing Authority said it saw no reason to “develop a policy regarding abandonment of any specific fixtures due to coronavirus at this time”.\nIn 2001 the then three-day festival did not go ahead because of the nationwide foot and mouth crisis, at a £100m cost to the betting industry and a £10m hit to local tourism.\nThe bible of the horseracing industry, The Racing Post, says Cheltenham brings bookmakers £450-£500 million in turnover and around £50 million in profit.\nThere is an option that the races go ahead “behind closed doors” or defer races to a later date, possibly next month.\nWHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR\nThe most common sign that a person may be infected with coronavirus is breathing problems.\nCoronaviruses are respiratory diseases and spread when an infected patient coughs or sneezes, spraying small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth.\nIt attacks two specific sets of cells in the lungs, a goblet cell and a ciliated cell.\nThe goblet cell produces mucus on the respiratory tract, to keep lungs moist.\nCiliated cells have hairs on them that wave in an upward direction to trap bacteria viruses, or particles of dust, in the mucus sweeping them up to the throat.\nScientists and clinicians say COVID-19 appears to single those cells out for infection similar to Severe Acute Respiratory System (SARS) in 2002-2003.\nSARS also originated in China, killing 774 people – significantly fewer than the almost 3,000 killed to date by COVID-19.\nTissue falls into the lungs, causing blockages and, potentially, pneumonia. Meanwhile, the immune system goes into overdrive damaging healthy tissue and making breathing even more difficult.\nOther organs, such as the kidneys, can also be damaged.",
