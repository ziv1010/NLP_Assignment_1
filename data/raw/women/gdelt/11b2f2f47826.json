across South Australia in the 1980s.\nThe sexually motivated kidnapping, torture and murder of 15-year-old Richard Kelvin was linked by police to a series of unsolved abductions — which became known as \"The Family\" murders — sending fear into the hearts of parents with teenage boys.\nWhen news broke this week that notorious child killer Bevan Spencer von Einem was on death's door in prison, it brought with it recollections of a horrific chapter in Adelaide's history when the city was said to have lost its innocence.\nWarning: This story contains details some readers may find distressing.\nWhile the now-79-year-old was only ever convicted of one murder, von Einem was thought to be connected, alongside the group known as \"The Family\", to the brutal murder of four other young males.\nAlan Barnes, 17, Neil Muir, 25, Peter Stogneff, 14, and Mark Langley, 18, were each murdered between 1979 and 1982.\nThe loss of the young men came less than a decade after the disappearance of 11-year-old Joanne Ratcliffe, and four-year-old Kirste Gordon from a football game at Adelaide Oval in August 1973 — with the two children never to be heard from again.\nBetween late 1976 and 1977, seven young women disappeared and were murdered, in a shocking crime spree that later became known as the \"Truro murders\", named after the regional town where several skeletons were found in bushland.\nThose murders were brought to an abrupt end when convicted rapist and suspected serial killer Christopher Worrell was killed in a car crash — but the extent of his crimes were not uncovered until a couple of years after his death.\nAnd in the decade before, it was the disappearance of the Beaumont children — Jane, Arnna and Grant — from an Adelaide beach that kicked off the beginning of a difficult chapter in Adelaide's history.\nAccording to SA's Chief Justice Chris Kourakis, it was the combination of all these crimes that caused significant alarm throughout the state.\n\"My personal reflection though overall, is that coming after the Beaumont children, the Ratcliffe children and then those crimes, it unsettled the community, great uncertainty and anxiety, which has meant that many children now don't experience the freedom to explore their environments,\" he said.\n\"I think that sense of fear and anxiety has been a great loss to our community.\"\nSimilarly, criminologist Xanthé Mallett said the murders had \"a huge impact\" on the psyche of South Australians.\n\"All these young men, missing, murdered, I think it really rocked the community,\" she said.\n\"People still talk about it, it's still part of the psyche like the Beaumonts.\"\nThe group, \"The Family\", attracted the moniker after a detective described breaking up the \"happy family\", thought to be responsible for the murders, in a 1988 television interview.\nThat group, it has been speculated, potentially included members of the state's elite.\nCourt documents reveal that, at the time, police told the media the five crimes were linked, sexually motivated \"serial killings\".\n\"We have looked at the pattern in these murders very seriously,\" one detective had said.\n\"We have got certain views on these teenage killings, but they will have to remain confidential.\"\nSimilarly, the then-coroner remarked: \"The evidence generally certainly does disclose some similarities in relation to certain … deaths investigated\".\nThe allegedly connected murders came to an end after Richard Kelvin's decomposing body was found in scrubland adjacent to a dirt airstrip near the Mount Crawford forest, about 50 kilometres north-east of Adelaide, on July 24, 1983.\nHe had vanished seven weeks earlier on June 5, 1983.\nAt about 6pm, Richard had walked a friend to a bus stop a few minutes from the North Adelaide home he shared with his family, including his father Rob Kelvin, a Nine News presenter.\nRichard was expected home for dinner and was last seen jogging down a side street nearby.\nBut he never arrived home.\nAccording to court documents, Richard had been held captive for five weeks, before his body was dumped.\nPolice said there were indications he had been washed and redressed after death.\nA post-mortem revealed he was subjected to \"quite serious violence\" during that time and suffered several injuries including to his head and anus.\nToxicology results showed the presence of alcohol and sedatives.\nVon Einem was first interviewed on July 28, 1983, and was arrested in November the same year.\nHe initially denied any involvement, but after scientific evidence linked the teenager's disappearance to von Einem, he suggested Richard had been \"willingly\" in his company and he had dropped him in the CBD later that night.\nEvidence, however, showed he had contact with Richard more recently than that night.\nVon Einem denied the allegations but he was found guilty by a jury.\nDr Mallet explained that people who committed crimes like von Einem's were \"generally psychopathic in nature\".\n\"They lack empathy, they lack remorse, sympathy, they don't have the same restraints on their behaviours that you and I would,\" she said.\nDr Mallett said this meant von Einem was \"not a man who's suddenly going to grow a conscience on his death bed\" and dob on any alleged co-offenders, even as his health had deteriorated.\nShe said what was publicly known about the alleged members of \"The Family\" suggested those involved likely included \"upstanding members of the community\".\n\"So this is a very powerful group,\" she said.\nWhile serving a life sentence for the heinous crime, von Einem was also charged with the murders of two of the other teenage boys — Alan Barnes and Mark Langley.\nHe denied the charges and was bound for trial in 1990, but the charges were dropped after it was ruled some of the evidence could not be used at trial.\nAlan Barnes was allegedly the first victim of \"The Family\".\nHe vanished in mid-1979, just days prior to his 17th birthday, after he was dropped on Grand Junction Road by a friend's brother.\nHis body was found on Sunday, June 24, 1979.\nIt had been dumped under the South Para Bridge, a short distance south of Williamstown, north of Adelaide.\nThere had been no attempt to conceal the body, and like Richard Kelvin, his body had been washed and re-dressed.\nA pathology report revealed his death was due to blood loss, while toxicology reports showed the presence of alcohol and sedatives.\nTwo months later, in August 1979, fishermen discovered the dissected body of Neil Muir dumped in garbage bags at Mutton Cove, near Osborne, on Adelaide's north-west coast.\nA doctor was later arrested and charged with the murder of Mr Muir, but was acquitted in 1980 after a Supreme Court trial.\nThe youngest of the alleged victims, Peter Stogneff, was just 14 when he disappeared in August 1981.\nHe had planned to take a day off school and meet a cousin in Rundle Mall, but the plans were cancelled, and police say it's not clear if he ever went.\nHis skeletal remains were discovered in June 1982 after a local farmer lit a fire to clear land near Middle Beach, about 50km north-west of Adelaide.\nThe then coroner found Peter was \"the victim of foul play\", noting his body had been sawn through in at least three places.\nThe state of his body meant his cause of death could not be determined.\nMark Langley, meanwhile, vanished in February 1982 following an argument with some friends.\nHis body was discovered about a week later by a father and son who had been weed spraying on Sprigg Road, near Mount Lofty.\nNo more convictions, despite links\nA pathologist could not determine his precise cause of death, but said the 18-year-old had suffered injuries to his anus and rectum, while sedatives were also found in his system.\nPolice have linked each of the abductions to \"The Family\", but von Einem is the only person to be convicted of any of the crimes.\nIn a 1989 press conference the mothers of Mark Langley, Alan Barnes and Peter Stogneff made a public appeal for a mystery female caller to ring back police with more information.\n\"It affected the family a great deal. When you lose a child, it's very hard, anyone who hasn't can't really understand,\" Janice Langley said at the time.\n\"Whoever you are, wherever you are, we desperately need your help. You must have some family so you can perhaps understand a little bit the torment we've been through over the last few years,\" Jan Barnes said.\n\"Peter was very young when he went missing, he was only 14. We know there was lots of 14-year-olds around, we'd want something done about it. We'd want them protected,\" Lydia Stogneff said.\nNo parole bid\nNo-one else has ever been brought to justice for any of the murders.\nWhen von Einem was jailed for at least 24 years, the sentencing judge said public outrage created by the crime \"must be assuaged and the minds of parents and adolescents must be set at rest\".\n\"The horrendous nature of this crime has added a new dimension to murder committed in this state,\" the judge said.\n\"You do not show remorse, or admit guilt.\"\nVon Einem's non-parole period was later increased to 36 years after an appeal.\nWhen increasing von Einem's non-parole period in March 1985, then-chief justice Len King refused to refrain from fixing a non-parole period but said the \"enormity and depravity of the crime\" required an increased period in prison.\nVon Einem became eligible to apply for release in 2007, but the state's then premier, Mike Rann, vowed the convicted killer would never be returned to the community.\nVon Einem has never made a bid for release.\nThere was hope this week von Einem may have proffered a death-bed confession, or that the extra publicity would prompt anyone else with information to contact police.\nRewards of between $200,000 and $1 million are still on offer in each of the cases for information that leads to a conviction.\nSA's Attorney-General Kyam Maher this week said the crimes had been \"etched\" into \"the psyche of South Australia\".\n\"I think most South Australians would not be having any remorse whatsoever at that person no longer being around,\" he said.\n\"Every day that he's not on the planet I think is a good day for society.\"\nSA Commissioner for Victims' Rights Sarah Quick said those close to the victims would have \"varying reactions\" about the demise of von Einem.\n\"Whenever there is a significant development in a case it really reignites all the emotions that people feel from the time the crime happens,\" she said.\n\"There may be a small sense of relief for some victims but there will also be a great deal of renewed anger and frustration, particularly as any hope of obtaining answers fades.\n\"I think von Einem's complete refusal to provide any information to victims has really denied them any opportunity for closure and justice … that has complicated their grief and trauma.\"\nSimilarly, former commissioner Michael O'Connell said the families of the victims \"experienced a nightmare none of us would ever want to have\".\n\"It's lifelong impact, every anniversary of a birthday, Christmas and so on, there is an empty seat at the dining room table,\" he said.\n\"The effects can not only be life-lasting but also very deeply entrenched both emotionally and psychologically.\"\nGlimmer of hope diminishing\nMr O'Connell said the news von Einem was on his death bed would fade the small \"glimmer\" of hope of any death-bed confession, taking with it any chance of closure.\n\"With the passing of von Einem that glimmer of hope is going to get dimmer and possibly for some it will be completely diminished,\"he said.\nFor Adelaide, which he said was often wrongly touted as the country's \"murder capital\", von Einem's passing would be \"one way of closing the door\" on one of the most miserable chapters for the city.\n\"It's certainly not the murder capital, but Adelaide has lived through some of the most horrific serial killings in modern history,\" he said.\nCredits:\nEditing: Sara Garcia\nDigital production: Jordanna Schriever and Josephine Lim\nAdditional reporting: Leah MacLennan\nPhotography: Lincoln Rothall\nGraphics: Stephan Hammat\n- Share options\n- Copy link\n- X (formerly Twitter)",
