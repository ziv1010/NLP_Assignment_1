Juve are a very good side.\n“When we scored, we felt we would grab a late equaliser, but alas! It was Juve who went on to score another goal. So, not the result we wanted, but we will keep fighting.”\nInter are third with 35 points from 19 matches, 16 points behind leaders Roma and 11 adrift of Juve.\nThe top two teams in the Poule Scudeto will qualify for the Women’s Uefa Champions League.\nThe second leading scorer, Juventus’ Cristina Girelli, who won the golden boot last season, trails Tabitha by four goals.",
