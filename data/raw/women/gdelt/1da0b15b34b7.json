Chicago will receive up to an additional $200,000 if certain conditions are met.\nOnly one other intraleague transfer in NWSL history cost more: Gotham FC paid $1.25 million to the North Carolina Courage to acquire midfielder Jaedyn Shaw in September.\nLudmila, 31, came to the NWSL in July 2024 when she signed with the Stars. She'd previously spent the bulk of her career in Spain with Atletico Madrid (2017-24).\nIn 31 games over a year and a half with Chicago, Ludmila recorded 13 goals and one assist. She broke the league record for the fastest hat trick last season, scoring three goals in 10:09 of game time when the Stars tied the Courage 3-3 in August.\n'I scored my first NWSL goal against San Diego and always was a team I admired. I loved the supporters, the energy of the team, and the vibes of the city when I visited. I'm very happy to be part of this Club's history,' Ludmila said in a news release. 'From the moment Cami and the organization showed interest in me, my focus was clear. I wanted to play for this team and this city. I didn't come here just to play. I came to give my best and fight to win trophies. I'm very excited to show my football in front of all the supporters and score many goals in these colors.'\nLudmila has earned 63 caps with the Brazil women's national team and scored six goals in international competition. She competed in two Olympic Games and the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n'We're very excited to come to an agreement to bring Ludmila to San Diego. She's a player who not only brings a great deal of talent, but also complements the strengths of our existing roster,' Wave sporting director and general manager Camille Ashton said in a statement. 'Her versatility allows her to operate in multiple attacking roles, giving our coaches more tactical options in different game situations. Her creativity and movement will enhance our ability to break down defenses, and we're confident she will be a valuable asset to the Club's success moving forward.'\n--Field Level Media\nShares\nShare\nTweet\nShare\nFlip\nEmail\nGet a daily dose of Haiti Sun news through our daily email, its complimentary and keeps you fully up to date with world and business news as well.\nPublish news of your business, community or sports group, personnel appointments, major event and more by submitting a news release to Haiti Sun.\nMore InformationBISHOFTU, Ethiopia: Ethiopia has kicked off construction of a vast new airport near its capital, a project officials say will transform...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: President Donald Trump's decision on global tariffs received an unexpected breather when the U.S. Supreme Court postponed...\nDUBAI, U.A.E: As a nighttime demonstration called by Iran's exiled crown prince saw protesters shout from their windows and storm the...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on January 7, suspending U.S. support for the 66 organizations,...\nMINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota: Controversy raged over the shooting at the wheel by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer of the...\nBERLIN, Germany: Tens of thousands of households in southwestern Berlin saw their electricity restored on January 7, three days after...\nCHENNAI, India: India's capital markets watchdog is preparing to unlock the long-delayed listing of the country's largest stock exchange,...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: U.S. President Donald Trump renewed a campaign pledge to limit credit card interest rates, calling for a one-year...\nNEW YORK, New York - U.S. stock markets were more restrained on Monday following Sunday night's revelation that the Federal Reserve...\nLAS VEGAS, Nevada: After years of expensive false starts, the self-driving car industry is regrouping around artificial intelligence...\nDETROIT, Michigan: General Motors is rolling back part of its electric-vehicle push, booking a US$6 billion writedown as weaker demand...\nNEW YORK CITY, New York: From New York to Paris, department stores are remaking themselves as destinations for experiences rather than...",
