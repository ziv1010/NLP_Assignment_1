  "body_text": "Jaclyn Diaz\nJaclyn Diaz is a reporter on Newshub.\nShe frequently covers breaking news and major events for NPR's digital desk. She traveled to China to cover the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics (which involved staying in a strict COVID-19-safe bubble) and Israel to cover the attacks of Oct. 7 and the war's impact on Palestinians and Israelis.\nShe also regularly covers criminal justice issues, with a special focus on our nation's prisons and jails.\nDuring the summer of 2023, she spent a few months on the Washington Desk to help cover the Justice Department during one of the busiest summers for the agency — when former President Donald Trump faced multiple criminal indictments.\nBefore coming to NPR in 2020, she was a reporter for Bloomberg Law, covering labor issues, and for The Norwich Bulletin, covering the small communities of Eastern Connecticut.\nWhile she's at home in Maryland with her husband and cuddling with her dog, Duncan, you can read her stories online and occasionally hear her on Morning Edition, Up First or All Things Considered where she discusses things like why there's an uptick in human and owl confrontations.\n-\nIn the Justice Department's release of millions of pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, there are several instances of unredacted names of Epstein's accusers, raising concerns about privacy.\n-\n\"Football\" is a word used to refer to different games: American football, the game played at the Super Bowl, where a foot is rarely used to direct the ball. And elsewhere in the world, football refers to what Americans call \"soccer.\" But where does this word really come from?\n-\nThe three most-senior cardinals leading U.S. archdioceses issued the rebuke in a joint statement on Monday, saying recent policies have thrown America's \"moral role in confronting evil\" into question.\n-\nMinneapolis is at the center of sweeping, evolving federal immigration push. It demonstrates how different immigration enforcement is under Trump's second administration - and raises questions about the lingering effects on local communities and law enforcement.\n-\nVenezuela's Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores have pleaded not guilty to all charges during their first court appearance in their federal narco-terrorism case.\n-\nDry January is the practice of not drinking for the first month of the new year. But where did the practice come from?\n-\nDetails are beginning to emerge about the life of Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, the gunman who killed two and injured nine others in the attack at Brown University last week. He is also believed to have killed an MIT professor on Monday, police said.\n-\nAmericans have deep nostalgia, and love, for America's chain restaurants. Why? We asked and more than 150 readers answered.\n-\nFor restaurants, going viral is appetizing. But at what cost?\n-\nInflation, rising food prices and the high cost of living have been top of mind for consumers all year. But then Olive Garden offers an unlimited pasta meal, or a chain steakhouse restaurant sells a steak dinner with two sides for less than 30 bucks. So, how are chains able to keep prices as low as they do in this economy?",
