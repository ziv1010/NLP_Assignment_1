  "body_text": "Good Tuesday morning. This is Rosa Prince.\nDRIVING THE DAY\nTHE KING’S SPEECH: Parliament welcomes King Charles to SW1 this morning with pomp, circumstance … and awkward small talk. Dust off your tiara as Playbook gives you the lowdown on a King’s Speech which will be a first for both monarch and prime minister. Keir Starmer, of course, will be hoping it’s Rishi Sunak’s last.\nBreaking overnight: Home Secretary Suella Braverman’s much derided plan to stop homeless people being given tents is not in the King’s Speech — Newsnight’s Nick Watt got the scoop.\nGet your tent off my lawn: The move comes after energy secretary and Sunak ally Claire Coutinho distanced herself Monday from Braverman’s suggestion that homelessness was a “lifestyle choice,” and the PM himself failed to back her. Does the dramatic move to junk the proposal (which was never confirmed, but the home secretary herself did little to damp down) mean Sunak could finally have tired of Braverman stealing his limelight?\nNOW BACK TO THE SPEECH: Lobby hacks will be up with the lark as embargoed copies of the speech are available in the Commons from 7.45 a.m. The ceremonial stuff kicks off at 9.30 a.m. when the Yeomen of the Guard search the Palace of Westminster cellars in case any 1605 gunpowder plotters might be lingering. Junior Whip Jo Churchill will be dispatched to Buckingham Palace where she’ll be “held hostage” while the king is at parliament — presumably on the grounds that if the Commons decides to do away with him then she’ll be a goner too. Sky News begins its live broadcast at 10.30 a.m.\n**A message from Airbnb: Airbnb has long called for new short-term let rules and a registration scheme for England. To avoid unintended consequences for hardworking families, it’s essential that new rules are proportionate and based on accurate data. Discover more.**\nGame of thrones: The king will arrive in the Irish State Coach and process to his gold throne in the House of Lords; once he’s safely ensconced, Black Rod will summon MPs to join the sovereign in the upper chamber. As tradition directs, the door to the Commons will be slammed in her face to symbolize MPs’ independence.\nAwks: MPs then saunter to the Lords — by tradition frontbenchers file out alongside their oppo; cue a series of highly awkward exchanges of small talk — think Rishi Sunak pointing out an interesting gargoyle to Keir Starmer, or Penny Mordaunt asking Lucy Powell what she’s doing for Christmas.\nSpare a thought for: Lord Chancellor Alex Chalk is responsible for handing the speech to the monarch and, Playbook’s Dan Bloom reports, is planning to abide by tradition and walk backwards away from the king once his task is done. Recent lord chancellors have turned around rather than risk tripping in their full length gown and formal shoes — described by one as having no grip — but our Alex is made of sterner stuff. Want more King’s Speech fun facts and colorful anecdotes? POLITICO’s secret constitutional expert has you covered.\nThe big moment: The king is expected to begin reading the speech around 11.25 a.m. — and, as my POLITICO colleague Annabelle Dickson points out in this super curtain raiser, given how much of the program is, shall we say, not quite his cup of Earl Grey, it’ll be fascinating to see if he’ll betray his true feelings with one of his characteristic grimaces. While the king does his stuff, the Commons is suspended until 2.30 p.m.\nBack to business: When MPs return after a jolly good lunch, they’ll approve the first reading of the Outlawries Bill — which asserts the right of the Commons to deliberate on matters of its own choosing. This is followed by six days of debate, starting with a motion giving thanks to the king. By tradition, this task is given to two back bench government MPs, one newbie and one vet, and are supposed to be humorous and relatively neutral — no pressure Robert Goodwill and Siobhan Baillie, who have the honor this time around. The pair are followed by the PM and LOTO, with the first day of debate continuing until 10 p.m.\nWant more? You can watch the state opening live here and the House of Commons Library has more info here. There’s also this fun briefing on the history of the state opening.\nHousekeeping: Only one Lobby briefing today, after the speech at 1 p.m. There’s also just one briefing Wednesday, at 12 p.m, then we’re back to normal with two from Thursday.\nSO WHAT’S IN THE THING? Don’t expect surprises. No. 10 confirmed to Playbook that the speech will be as billed, with a focus on “putting in the right laws, where we need them, to safeguard the future prosperity of the United Kingdom, seize economic opportunities and deliver a brighter future.” It’s a legislative program designed to establish dividing lines with Labour going into election season. And the main thrust is a whole load of action on law and order.\nSuella of a lot of legislation: The home secretary sets out the welter of planned legislation on her patch in an op-ed in the Mail, writing: “There is no higher duty for government than keeping the citizens it serves safe.” The article makes no mention of tents — but does describe a crackdown on begging, and sets out plans to “encourage” vulnerable people to seek help for addiction or substance abuse. Meanwhile, Justice Secretary Alex Chalk has an-op ed in the Times on tackling violence and abuse of women and girls, including by banning taking nude photographs without consent. Chalk has the morning broadcast round.\nThere’s more: Under a sentencing bill, whole life orders will be introduced for murders involving the most sadistic or sexual conduct. Rapists and serious sex offenders will have to serve their full sentence. In a separate criminal justice bill, judges will be given powers to force convicted criminals to attend sentencing. A victims bill will bar the worst offenders from getting parole or marrying behind bars. As Sophia Sleigh reported in the Sun on Sunday, police will be able to enter properties without a warrant to retrieve stolen mobile phones.\nThe politics: Downing Street clearly feels comfortable fighting the election on the territory of law and order. An insider told Playbook: “It’s a real bread and butter issue. We want to be talking about the Conservatives’ record because the Conservatives’ record since 2010 is very strong.” In words briefed overnight, Sunak said: “Thanks to this government, crime is down, but we must always strive to do more, taking the right long-term decisions for the country and keeping the worst offenders locked up for longer. In the most despicable cases, these evil criminals must never be free on our streets again. Life needs to mean life.”\nAu contraire: Piffle, say the opposition. Shadow Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood added: “There’s no use posturing on law and order when the criminal justice system is crumbling under the government’s feet after 13 years of mismanagement.”\nBEST OF THE REST: The Mirror’s Ben Glaze has a good run down of the main measures in the speech, including Sunak’s plan for a phased cigarette ban. The Times’ Ben Clatworthy reveals plans for driverless buses and delivery vehicles. An independent regulator will oversee the top five tiers of English football; there will be curbs on town hall salaries; councils will be blocked from introducing low-traffic zones; a law requiring media outlets to pay all costs in libel cases even when they win will be repealed; airlines will be barred from imposing hidden charges; the Telegraph says there will be a pensions reform bill and pedicabs will be regulated.\nWatered down: Reforms to the “feudal” leasehold system mean new houses will have to be sold as freeholds, but the government has stepped back from mandating the same for most flats. No-fault evictions are back — but only after the courts are reformed.\nLow energy: A suggestion by Bloomberg’s Alex Wickham that Sunak had wanted to go harder on the speech’s centerpiece — energy legislation of annual North Sea oil and gas auctions — was rejected by the energy department Monday night.\nNOT IN THE SPEECH: With Braverman’s tent plan put back on ice, the speech is as notable for what it doesn’t include as what it does. Also failing to make the grade are a proposed ban on conversion therapy — to the consternation of some Tory MPs including Alicia Kearns. A British Railway Bill has also fallen by the wayside.\nReminder: The King’s Speech sets out the government’s broad agenda, but inclusion by no means equates to a bill becoming law — or even making it to parliament at all. And plenty of legislation has been passed which never received a mention in the plummy tones of one of our royals.\nBACK TO SUELLA: Some Tory MPs — including at least one minister — complained to the chief whip about Braverman’s tent comments, Dan Bloom hears. Big Issue founder and crossbench peer John Bird has an op-ed in the Times describing her “lifestyle choice” quote as “ignorant.” Politics Joe’s Ed Campbell asked some homeless people if sleeping rough was a choice.\nCONGRATS JAMES: The row hasn’t taken the shine off Braverman in the eyes of party members, though. She’s riding high in fifth place in the latest ConHome membership Cabinet rankings, with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly topping the table, followed by Trade Sec Kemi Badenoch, Leader of the House Penny Mordaunt and Veterans’ Minister Johnny Mercer. Rishi Sunak is in … checks notes … 23rd place. But hey — at least that’s ahead of Michael Gove AND Jeremy Hunt.\nTHE LABOUR NARRATIVE: Keir Starmer will use his response to the speech to make the case that the Tories have run out of ideas after 13 years in power. In words briefed overnight, he said: “Britain is crying out for the long-term change that harnesses the ambition of our young people, the innovative drive of our businesses, and the ordinary hope and optimism that exists around every kitchen table.” Labour’s Pat McFadden has the morning broadcast round.\nLib Dem corner: Meanwhile Ed Davey’s party will use the King’s Speech debates to call for action on the NHS and sewage. Blood and muck, as it were.\nLEST WE FORGET\nA SICKENING ANNIVERSARY: One month ago today, Hamas launched its attack on Israel, slaughtering and kidnapping men, women and children, and reigniting a conflict too many of us in the rest of the world had taken our eye off. The Israeli response has seen Gaza turned into a “graveyard for children,” in the words of U.N. chief António Guterres Monday, while more than 200 hostages remain trapped and terrified. The crisis continues to dominate politics both globally and here in the U.K.\nLast night in Gaza: The Israel Defense Forces have effectively split the Gaza Strip in two, with troops encircling Gaza City. Ground forces are expected to enter within days, opening up a new phase of the ground war.\n‘Tactical little pauses’: In an interview with ABC, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was considering “tactical little pauses” in fighting to allow aid into Gaza and to move hostages out. “We’ve had them before, I suppose, we’ll check the circumstances in order to enable goods, humanitarian goods to come in, or our hostages, individual hostages to leave,” he said. However, he dismissed the idea of a cease-fire.\nMARCH ON: The Palestine Solidarity Campaign issued a statement Monday night confirming it would press ahead with plans for a protest march Saturday, despite pleas from the Met Police and Suella Braverman. The march is due to take place hours after ceremonies to mark Armistice Day, although organizers point out it will not go past the Cenotaph, and is a day before the more widely observed Remembrance Day.\nOver to Mark: It now falls to Met chief Mark Rowley to decide whether to recommend the march from Hyde Park to the U.S. Embassy be banned — a decision he had clearly been hoping to swerve with his plea to the group.\nNo pressure: On Radio 4’s World Tonight, march organizer Ben Jemal said: “We are conscious that the police has been put under considerable political pressure by the prime minister and the home secretary with the comments they have been making and it is difficult to see that the request from the police is not linked to that.”\nIt’s complicated: Hugo Rifkind has a thoughtful piece in the Times on the dilemmas involved in the decision to ban the march.\nState of the unions: Tory Chair Greg Hands has written to Keir Starmer demanding he urge trade unions including Unison, Unite and the GMB to sever ties with the PSC. The Mail has the story.\nLABOUR’S TRAVAILS: Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy attempts to bridge Labour’s widening fractures over the Middle East question by calling on the government to condemn “violence and extremism by Israeli settlers” in a letter to his oppo, James Cleverly. The move is designed to show to those in the party with concerns about Starmer’s decision not to call for a cease-fire in Gaza that the leadership is alive to the impact on civilians. The Guardian has a write-up.\nPut it to the vote: The National confirms suggestions that SNP MPs are considering teaming up with left-leaning Labour MPs to hold a vote on the cease-fire issue during one of the party’s opposition day debates, which could come as soon as next week.\nHELPING HAND: Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told POLITICO’s Power Play podcast his country would consider participating in a sea corridor of humanitarian aid to Gaza if ships could operate with “full protection.”\nTODAY IN WESTMINSTER\nTHE ONE THAT COUNTS: It’s your daily reminder that the parliamentary event that matters this month is not the King’s Speech but the Autumn Statement in a couple of weeks’ time. The Sun’s Harry Cole hears that friend of the motorist Rishi Sunak and his mate Jeremy Hunt have ruled out anything in the way of an increase in fuel tax. The chancellor receives the latest forecasts from the OBR Wednesday, and decisions about tax cuts are said to be going “to the wire.”\nCROWD FUNDER: A fundraiser to pay the legal fees of Tory MP Bob Stewart following his conviction for hate speech has raised £10,000 in two days. Deputy Conservative Chair Lee Anderson is among the contributors to his appeal fund, the Express’ David Maddox reports.\nDOCTORS’ ORDERS: Senior doctors are being offered a “disguised” pay rise instead of a direct salary increase as part of negotiations between the BMA and the government — via the Times.\nTHEY GOT ME TOO: In the final Mail extract of her book, Nadine Dorries claims Iain Duncan Smith was also toppled by the shadowy forces that knifed ex-PM Boris Johnson.\nFRAUD SQUAD MEETS: Cabinet Office Minister Lucy Neville-Rolfe hosts the first ever roundtable between the Public Sector Fraud Authority (PSFA) and private sector organizations as the PSFA develops a four-year fraud strategy due to be published in 2024.\nBREAK THE BANK: Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride marks 99 percent of people eligible for the Cost of Living Payment receiving their second £300 payment, assisting more than 8 million households.\nUK <3 UKRAINE: The U.K. should stand squarely with Ukraine “even if it makes life harder,” according to 60 percent of voters, More in Common polling found — the Sun’s Jack Elsom has the story.\nIN HOT WATER: The U.K.’s water industry paid out £10 million in executive salaries last year, the highest on record according to Lib Dem analysis — the Times has a write-up.\nNERVES OF STEEL: Unions including the Community steelworkers’ union and the GMB said they would fight British Steel’s plans to close its coal fired blast furnaces in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, which places 2,000 jobs at risk — the Mirror has more details.\nAT THE COVID INQUIRY: Former Head of the Cabinet Office COVID-19 Taskforce Simon Ridley appears before the COVID Inquiry from 10 a.m., while Eddie Lister, a Tory peer who was Downing Street chief of staff from July 2019 until January 2021, gives evidence in the afternoon.\nSW1 EVENTS: UK in a Changing Europe hosts a lunch hour on democracy in the EU at 1 p.m.\nHOUSE OF COMMONS: After the King’s Speech debate Tory MP James Wild has the adjournment debate on dangerous driving.\nOn Committee corridor: Chief of the General Staff Patrick Sanders and Chief of the Air Staff Richard Knighton give evidence to the Defense Committee on armed forces readiness (3 p.m.) … and Prison Reform Trust Chief Executive Officer Pia Sinha gives evidence to the Justice Committee on the prison population (3.30 p.m.).\n**What type of housing does the U.K. need?
