Here are some of the athletes that have represented Cornell at the highest level with honor and pride.\nTop Male Senior Athlete: Yianni Diakomihalis - Wrestling\nTop Female Senior Athlete: Sivasangari Subramaniam - Squash\nTop Senior Athletes (in alphabetical order):\nGavin Adler - Lacrosse\nOne of the most dominant defensemen to play for the Red, Gavin Adler’s legacy at Cornell will be hard to forget. As a sophomore, Adler was an Honorable Mention All-American in a shortened five-game COVID-19 season. Returning to competition in 2022, Adler was the lynchpin of a Cornell squad that made a run to the National Championship game. He was a unanimous first-team All-Ivy selection and a first-team All-American, leading the Red with 34 caused turnovers. As a senior, Adler has racked up 59 ground balls and 21 caused turnovers. He was named a midseason All-American and is one of 25 nominees for the Tewaaraton Award, given annually to the best lacrosse player in the country. At the end of the regular season, he was selected first overall in the Premier Lacrosse League college draft and was named first-team All-American once again. Adler’s elite play will be crucial for the Red as it embarks on another postseason run.\nMax Andreev - Ice Hockey\nMax Andreev has been a staple of Cornell hockey’s attack since 2018. As a freshman, Andreev recorded 10 points and ranked fourth in the nation among freshmen in face-off win percentage. After losing the better part of two years due to COVID-19, Andreev had a breakout junior campaign where he recorded points in eight straight games, earning ECAC Hockey Player of the Month honors and ECAC Hockey Driscoll Skating and Skills Player of the Week. He finished the season with 23 points, and was named to the All-ECAC Third Team. As a senior, Andreev racked up 22 points and helped the Red make a run to the NCAA quarterfinals. Following the season, he signed an amateur tryout agreement with the Coachella Valley Firebirds.\nVictoria Atkinson - Track & Field\nA two-time Ivy League Champion, Victoria Atkinson has had an impact on Cornell track and field right from the start. As a freshman, at the Kane Invitational, she achieved a personal record and recorded the fifth-best pole vault clear in Cornell indoor track and field history. After a canceled sophomore season, she returned to competition in her junior year, sweeping both the indoor and outdoor pole vault titles to earn the title of Ivy League Champion. She is also the school record holder in outdoor and indoor pole vault.\nBen Berard - Ice Hockey\nBen Berard’s prowess on the offensive end will not be forgotten anytime soon. As a freshman, Berard played an important role in the team’s 23-2-4 regular season. He led the team’s rookies in points, with 17, and was named ECAC Rookie of the Week twice. As a junior, Berard was a driving force on the attack, leading the team with 14 goals and finishing tied for second on the team with 23 points along with senior Sam Malinski. When the Red hosted top-ranked Quinnipiac at Lynah, Berard scored both goals in a 2-1 overtime upset victory. This season, Berard once again led the team in goals with 11, and notched a career high 28 points. He was tabbed ECAC Forward of the Week after a six-point weekend against Union and RPI.
