  "body_text": "ALBANY, N.Y. — If you miss watching affiliated minor league baseball in April, imagine how fans in Albany felt 40 years ago.\nThe city hadn’t fielded a team since the Albany Senators, then affiliated with the Kansas City A’s, folded after the 1959 season, leaving the area without a club for 24 years. That changed in 1983 when the Oakland Athletics moved their Double-A team to Albany.\nOwner Ben Bernard, who was the general manager of the Double-A Glens Falls White Sox prior to getting a team in Albany, spoke about how it all came together.\n“I remember Gary Holle, got to know him and Jim Coyne who was the county executive and they had mentioned to me that they would like to have a ball team in the Albany area,” Bernard said.\n“They came up to Glens Falls and we met and then I had to find out if there was a team for sale, so I pursued that. Once they said they were interested they would definitely try to build a ballpark so I had to make sure we could get a team there. Coyne and Fred Field with the town of Colonie got involved and that’s when Heritage Park came to fruition,” Bernard explained.\nAccording to former A’s public relations director Rich Lynch, who moved with the club from West Haven, the area had soured on baseball after the New York Yankees affiliate departed and the West Haven A’s finished a dreadful 47-92 in 1980. A poor first impression, low attendance, and a dilapidated Quigley Field were too much to overcome, despite the club going 86-54 and winning the 1982 Eastern League title.\nWhile purchasing the team was one thing, finding a place to play and getting the season going was quite another. In fact, the team took a slight detour to a big ballpark in the Bronx with manager Pete Whisenant, according to infielder Mike Ashman.\n“Pete was fun to play for but he just ran it a little too loose I think for what the team wanted. Even from the beginning because he was good friends with Billy Martin, when we flew out he asked [farm director] Walt Jocketty if he could take us to a Yankee game but they said no, go straight to Albany,” Ashman said.\n“Well, there’s no cellphones, nothing back then, right? So, as soon as we land he tells the bus driver, Yankee Stadium. So, he ended up getting us to the game, we watched like six innings but we’re now we’re like three hours late to Albany and they have no idea where the hell we are. So, I think he got off on a bad foot not listening to Walt,” Ashman recalled.\nWhen the team finally arrived in Albany to face the New Britain Red Sox on April 15, Mother Nature had other plans, remembered team radio broadcaster Phil Pivnick.\n“There was a huge snowstorm that snowed out the opener at Bleeker Stadium. So we didn’t play for like five days or so, there was huge snow like 20 inches,” Pivnick said.\nAshman recalled his routine in battling the elements.\n“I had a great spring training, hitting like I never hit before, then we get that snow out and then I was struggling, then Tigers great Willie Horton was our minor league roving instructor. We were at Siena College hitting there was concrete in the cage, I was overstriding so Willie laid down in front of me and held my front leg while I’m hitting. This man made the Olympic team as a heavyweight boxer but they found out he was only 16 so he couldn’t be in the Olympics. So, I’m like if I roll one over and hit Willie Horton, I’m done,” Ashman remembered.\n“We opened up on the road in Glens Falls,” Pivnick remarked, as the team dropped its first contest 10-3.\n“Mike Warren was the first starting pitcher for Albany, and ended up pitching a no-hitter for Oakland at the end of that year,” Pivnick noted on getting the season underway.\nWith Heritage Park still under construction, Pivnick and the players noted the quirkiness of the old Bleeker Stadium, which was built in the 1930s.\n“We finally opened up at Bleeker Stadium, which was surreal. We used to play at five o’clock. We were like the preview for the twilight league games because the twilight league guys couldn’t play until after work,” Pivnick said.\n“Bleeker Stadium I don’t even think there were really even seats, they were concrete benches and they put a little trailer behind home plate that was our press box. I did games with Mike Jones and Ed O’Brien did a bunch of games with us, that was really nice having a real professional guy there, Ed was a great guy,” Pivnick noted.\n“It was amazing to play games there. It was really crazy. It was great playing five o’clock games, they actually tape-delayed ’em on the radio, they’d play ’em at eight, it was weird. We were on WTRY, which was pretty good being on a big station like that,” Pivnick continued.\n“We played some crazy games at Bleeker Stadium, the walls were so short, we had a game one team was down 12-4 and scored seven in the ninth and it ended up being 12-11. No lead with safe. It was ridiculous. We had a game in June against Buffalo, a guy named Rich Doyle pitched a no-hitter against us, beat us 6-1 and Buffalo had six solo homers, all would’ve been easy fly balls in any other stadium. Some of the games were just crazy,” Pivnick noted on the dimensions of the field.\n“We had a guy named Mark Ferguson who pitched a no-hitter. It was part of a seven-inning doubleheader. He had a perfect game going for the first six, that was very exciting,” Pivnick recalled.\n“The fans were just great. People were so excited to have baseball back. It was really something to play at Bleeker Stadium and for a 21-year-old kid it was amazing really,” Pivnick noted on being a senior at UAlbany and having his first broadcasting job in Double-A.\nPivnick added how exciting and surreal it was to be doing homework on the team bus and seeing the organization’s roving instructors like Horton and Hall of Fame third baseman Eddie Mathews along the way.\n“We had to play afternoon games, I remember that. It was a good place to hit because it was a small ballpark, really not fit for Double-A baseball. Most of the team was combined from the year before from Madison, which is where I played in Wisconsin, and Modesto where they won 99 games. So I think the expectations were we were going to be really good, which didn’t turn out that way. We had some prospects, we had a good team but not what they anticipated,” Ashman recalled.\n“That was fun, even at Bleeker because the fans were right on top of you,” Ashman added on the proximity of the fans to the field.\n“The biggest thing that I remember is when we showed up, the ballpark wasn’t ready. We started playing our games at Bleeker Stadium. It was a football field, baseball field, track, had a little of everything in it. Then we had a locker room in a gymnasium that was close by to the field itself. It was quite an adventure, let’s just say that,” first baseman Phil Stephenson remembered.\n“It wasn’t the greatest field, there were quite a few bad hops in it that were advantageous when we were hitting and not so advantageous when we were pitching. Then of course you had the running track that ran through the outfield,” Stephenson continued.\n“Thought that was an interesting way to open up the season and it was cold. That was the other part. Usually by April, growing up in Oklahoma and playing at Wichita State, it had warmed up a little bit by then, well that wasn’t necessarily the case there in the Eastern League, the first month was pretty cold,” Stephenson added.\nCatcher Charlie O’Brien also reflected on playing at Bleeker Stadium in the first half of the season.\n“The first part of it we played at Bleeker Stadium. That was a different place for sure with the track running through it. Hitter friendly, it was kind of a small park,” O’Brien said.\n“We had a good team then, had a lot of the prospects that were on it. Of course, the new stadium was way nicer but I didn’t get to play much in it because I got hurt not too long after we got to the new stadium. It was a pretty place, good fans, good people, it was a good time,” O’Brien noted.\n“It was the first time playing in Double-A for me so it was a good experience. Pretty place, you know Albany’s a very pretty place to me,” O’Brien added on his impressions of the area.\nUnfortunately, the early season acclimation was rough on the team in the standings and the organization eventually made a change at the helm.\n“Pete was an old-time baseball guy, he was on the ’61 Cincinnati Reds that lost to the Yankees. Somehow he was best friends with Billy Martin, that’s how he got the job with the A’s. He was one of these old-time guys, they fired him in July but he was just an old-time baseball guy who love to drink, and women and it was literally like going back in time. I think he had managed Modesto the year before and I think they wanted to get rid of him but Modesto was like 90-40 and a lot of guys who ended up winning the championship ended up in Albany so they really couldn’t get rid of him,” Pivnick said.\n“Once we started losing they brought Keith Liepmann in to manage the first week in July. Then Keith managed us in 1984,” Pivnick noted.\n“Pete was a screamer and a yeller but he also gave you the freedom to I guess you could say you could either be a mature individual or you could hang yourself with the freedoms he gave you and I don’t think Oakland cared for that approach and they brought Keith in and he was a big disciplinarian and it took a while for guys to get used to that as much as anything else. I think they expected a lot more out of that team, wins and losses wise than we ended up with because of where all the guys had come from the year before,” Stephenson recalled.",
