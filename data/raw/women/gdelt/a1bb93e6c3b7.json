  "body_text": "They served in public office as legislators, judges, an ambassador, a U.S. congressman, the state’s attorney general and the mayor of Utah’s biggest city.\nThey built businesses in trucking, playground equipment and software. One made motorcycles. Another crafted wooden toy cars to give to children around the world.\nThey worked in the law, putting criminals behind bars. Two were barely out of the police academy when they died, too young.\nThey were scientists and scholars. They were leaders in their faiths.\nThey were artists, expressing themselves in music, painting, dance, theater and sculpture. They promoted the classics — whether Greek plays, silent movies or vinyl records — and new creative work.\nThey wrote about history, faith and the environment. One wrote about television, delighting the readers of Utah’s two largest newspapers.\nTwo were little known outside their small circles when they were alive — but their deaths, and the way their family and friends reacted, made them well-known in Utah and across the country.\nThese 80 people, and seven animals, were notable Utahns who died in 2024. The people ranged from age 20 to 105, and they affected the lives of other Utahns in ways large and small — so we take the time and space here to remember them and what they left to us.\nBené Arnold • As Ballet West’s first ballet mistress, Arnold worked closely with founder Willam Christensen to develop dancers in the company’s early days. She also taught for years in the University of Utah’s dance department, trained young dancers for Ballet West’s production of “The Nutcracker,” and in her later years danced “character” roles such as the evil sorceress Carabosse in “Sleeping Beauty.” Arnold died Jan. 25 at age 88.\nFrank Arnold • An Ogden native, Arnold coached the Brigham Young University men’s basketball team from 1975 to 1983 — and, in 1981, took the Cougars, led by eventual NBA star (and current Utah Jazz executive) Danny Ainge, to the school’s only appearance in the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament. Arnold died June 8 at age 89.\nMark Atkinson • A legendary racer and machinist whose motto was “Ride Fast, Safety Last,” Atkinson was a veteran of the Bonneville Salt Flats and, in his shop in Mount Pleasant, designed and built two high-performance motorcycles, the “BMW Alpha” and the electric “Racer-X,” that are enshrined in the Haas Moto Museum in Dallas.

Bale died Oct. 16 at age 100.\nPeggy Boss Barney • Over a three-decade career in journalism, Barney did most of her work behind the scenes — in editor positions at Ogden’s Standard-Examiner from 1984 to 1995 and from 1995 to 2013 as a copy editor and night webmaster at The Salt Lake Tribune. Barney died Oct. 3 at age 66 in a Bountiful hospital after a long illness, her family said.\nShannon Barnson • A larger-than-life figure in Utah’s fandom communities, Barnson — who lobbied for and was voted “Worst Utahn” by Salt Lake City Weekly readers in 2013 — was a charter panelist and resident “wild card” on the “Geek Show Podcast,” bartender and concert booker at the now-defunct Burt’s Tiki Lounge, and co-emcee of a popular pub trivia game that moved from Burt’s to Lucky 13 to Keys on Main over the past 13 years. Barnson died July 2 at age 52 in his sleep, according to friends.\nBruce Bastian • As a computer science grad student at BYU, Bastian teamed with his professor, Alan Ashton, in 1979 to start the word processing software company WordPerfect — which became the fourth largest software maker by 1990, making both men rich.

Chimeegui was humanely euthanized Aug. 17 at age 12 after an illness.\nFrances Darger • Darger played violin with the Utah Symphony for seven decades, starting in 1942 and retiring in 2012, as the organization went from a part-time orchestra to a fully professional one. (She skipped a year, when she and her sisters tried for Hollywood fame.) Darger died July 30 at age 99 of natural causes.\nGerald “Skip” Daynes • Running his family’s Salt Lake City business, Daynes Music, Daynes built the company into the largest dealer of Steinway pianos west of New York. He also was a strong supporter of the Utah Symphony, Utah Opera, the Gina Bachauer International Piano Competition, Ballet West, the Moab Music Festival and the University of Utah School of Music — which, because of him, is fully equipped with Steinways.

Dmitrich died Sept. 30 at age 87.\nGene England • England and his brother, Bill, led the Utah trucking company their father, C.R.

In 2020, at age 71, Gardner — after surviving colon cancer and a heart transplant (the donor was a BYU football player) — was told to leave his home after falling three days behind on rent in a case that spotlighted the deficiencies of a COVID-19-era moratorium on evictions. Gardner died May 16 at age 74 at home.\nGeorge • One of Hogle Zoo’s longest residents, George was one of the oldest southern white rhinos in human care, zoo officials said.

Lund died Oct. 25 at age 81.\nEmaloni Takitoa Lutui • A Salt Lake County sheriff’s deputy just 18 days out of the academy, Lutui “bravely sacrificed his life,” the department said, when he saved a woman after they both fell through the ice at Settlement Canyon Reservoir in Tooele County.

Okerlund died Oct. 10 at age 72.\n1K • The first wild-fledged California condor in Zion National Park, the bird — nicknamed “1k” because he was the 1,000th to hatch in the history of the California Condor Recovery Program since it started in 1982 — was a fan favorite and a symbol of the success of bringing back the endangered species. The bird, found dead in a juniper tree, is believed to have died in March, just short of his fifth birthday.
