I had a few chances in the first half and that one in the second half went in.\"\nAustralia, fresh off an 8-0 demolition of the Philippines, unleashed a near full-strength starting XI against Taiwan featuring Kerr, Caitlin Foord, Fowler, Mackenzie Arnold and Steph Catley.\nBut despite registering 17 shots to one in the first half and enjoying 79 per cent possession, the Matildas couldn't find a way past Chinese Taipei's staunch defence.\nFowler came the closest in the 14th minute, but her powerful shot from close range rattled the woodwork and deflected away.\nTaiwan goalkeeper Cheng Ssu-Yu pulled off a series of strong saves to further frustrate the Matildas.\nBut Australia had only themselves to blame on other occasions, firing a series of shots either wide or over the target.\nKerr had a golden chance to open the scoring on the stroke of halftime, but her header at the far post flew over.\nThe Chelsea striker also fluffed a chance early in the second half when a poor first touch cost her what would have been a one-on-one opportunity against the goalkeeper.\nBut there was no stopping Fowler's thunderous strike in the 62nd minute.\nAnd when a goalmouth scramble ensued six minutes later, Kerr was on hand to put away the easy tap-in.\nIt made it five goals for Kerr across the three qualifiers, and also marked the Matildas' 900th goal.\nKerr was subbed off straight after the goal, but Yallop ensured the party continued with an easy tap-in following good lead-in work from Caitlin Foord and Amy Sayer.\nIn the other match in Perth on Wednesday, the Philippines beat Iran 1-0 courtesy of a 19th-minute goal from Tahnai Annis.",
