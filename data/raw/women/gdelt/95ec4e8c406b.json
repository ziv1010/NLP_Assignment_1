Forget football.”\n@Reech_Tio: “Super Falcons should’ve used protest as an excuse to avoid this embarrassment of a performance. What is this na!”\n@IbkSports: “It’s the end of the road for Super Falcons of Nigeria at the #OlympicGames and we finish last with zero point. Tough defeat despite the superb goal scored by Jennifer Echegini. It’s ALL OVER!”\n@OgaNlaMedia: “Three games and three defeats for our darling Super Falcons. It was not the result(s) that we wanted, but the girls fought till the end. We need to support the coach.”\n@PoojaMedia: “Super Falcons CRASH out of the #Olympics football, losing all 3 games against Brazil, Spain & Japan. Medal faith dashed in football. Goodbye, we go again. #PARIS2024.”\n@MakingOfChamps: “The Super Falcons are out of #Paris2024 #Olympics, losing a third consecutive group match, which left them bottom of their group. A lack of goals have cost Nigeria dearly, with Jennifer Echegini netting Nigeria’s only goal of the tournament.”\n@shittu10: “Well done. Hopefully, the coaches and players have learnt one thing or the other.”\n@chidigab2000: “Losing to 3 of the best top 9 teams in the world and all former champions is not a shame. Better luck next time. NFF please give this team the necessary support consistently.”",
