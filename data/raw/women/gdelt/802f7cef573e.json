The USWNT controlled its Group A opener from the outset and came away with a very comfortable 5-0 victory over the Dominican Republic in front of 3,242 on a rainy and cold Tuesday night at Dignity Health Sports Park.\nThe Americans had the perfect start as Lynn Williams scored off of a corner kick in the second minute. However, it was ruled that Sophia Smith impeded the vision of the Dominican Republic goalkeeper and the goal was waved off.\nNearly five minutes later, a breakthrough came as 18-year-old Olivia Moultrie tapped in a Midge Purce cross for the 1-0 lead in the seventh minute.\nIn the 30th minute, Williams finally had her goal, tapping in a cross from Midge Purce for a 2-0 lead.\nMoultrie, making just her third appearance with the national team and her first start, added a second goal in the 58th minute, redirecting a pass from Purce into the goal for a 3-0 lead.\nMoultrie became the third-youngest player in USWNT history to score multiple goals in a match. The other two are Cindy Parlow Cone and Mia Hamm.\n“I’m pretty ecstatic right now. I was just so happy to be on the field tonight, to have the opportunity to start is amazing,” Moultrie said.\nJenna Nighswonger, a Huntington Beach resident, capped the scoring when she converted a penalty kick in the 86th minute for a 4-0 lead and her first national team goal.\nAlex Morgan added another successful penalty kick in the 90th minute to close the scoring. It was her 122nd international goal.\nThe USWNT recorded 30 shots, compared to none for the Dominican Republic.\nWith the SheBelieves Cup and the Paris Olympics on tap for this year, the recent training camp was the first opportunity for players to make a first impression on the coaching staff.\nThe initial Gold Cup roster consisted of 11 players who are 25 or younger. Due to injuries to Alana Cook and Mia Fishel, a pair of trusted veterans were called in (Becky Sauerbrunn and Morgan).\nThe Dominican Republic defeated Guyana, 1-0, in the preliminary round on Saturday to qualify for the group stage.\nBefore the start of the game, the U.S. suffered a setback with Fishel suffering an ACL injury in her right knee on Monday. Morgan was called on to replace her and entered the game as a substitute in the 67th minute.\nMorgan, who normally wears No. 13, wore Fishel’s No. 7 because of CONCACAF rules.\nThe game was not only the first in a tournament with Twila Kilgore in charge as the interim coach, but it was also her first in her native Southern California. Kilgore was born in Downey and went on to attend Harvard-Westlake High.\n“It’s a great opportunity to come home, it’s been amazing,” Kilgore said. “A couple of my club coaches surprised me at training the other day and it was like a full circle moment for me. This is a great city that loves football.”\nIt was the sixth victory for the United States under Kilgore, who took over when former coach Vlatko Andonovski departed the team following the World Cup last summer.\nKilgore is serving in the interim role until May while new coach Emma Hayes completes the current Women’s Super League season with Chelsea. Purce said Kilgore did a good job of making sure everyone was on the same page.\n“I think that we’re playing against a low block so it gives us an opportunity for a lot of creativity,” Purce said. “And we have a lot of creative players on the front line. So it was really fun. It was a fun day.”\nMexico and Argentina played to a scoreless draw in Tuesday’s first game. Mexico had a chance to take the lead early but Rebeca Bernal missed a penalty attempt in the 10th minute.\nThat tie definitely opens up the race for second place in the group.\nThe group will be back in action Friday with Mexico and the Dominican Republic squaring off at 4:30 p.m., followed by the USWNT and Argentina at 7:15 p.m. Both matches will again be in Carson.\nThere are three four-team groups in the tournament, with other matches being played in San Diego and Houston.\nMIDGE PURCE COOOOOKED TONIGHT. 👩🍳@jennychiu caught up with @100Purcent after tonight's match. 💯🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/o3G40crbFL\n— Attacking Third (@AttackingThird) February 21, 2024\nThe 33rd teenager to score for the #USWNT: @olivia_moultrie 🇺🇸\n🎥 » @AttackingThird\npic.twitter.com/hqC7JQyVK5— U.S. Women's National Soccer Team (@USWNT) February 21, 2024\nMidge and Lynn linking up for Goal No. 2 🔗\n🎥 » @AttackingThird\n— U.S. Women's National Soccer Team (@USWNT) February 21, 2024\n.@olivia_moultrie x 2\n🎥 » @AttackingThird\npic.twitter.com/LOaIajNuaw— U.S. Women's National Soccer Team (@USWNT) February 21, 2024",
