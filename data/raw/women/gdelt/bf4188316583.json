Chelsea eye records after sealing another title\n- Published30 April 2025\nSandy Baltimore\nSummer signing Sandy Baltimore arrived in London from Paris St-Germain with bags of experience in the French league and in Europe.\nBut few could have predicted just how impressive the 25-year-old's debut season at Chelsea would be.\nHaving played as a forward at PSG, Bompastor raised eyebrows when she played Baltimore as a left wing-back.\nThat didn't faze Baltimore though, who went on to make 14 appearances, starting 13 and contributing to four goals in her last four games in the WSL.\nShe told BBC Sport in January: \"I have more responsibility defensively. I love football so that's fine, I will play anywhere.\n\"I am known for my attacking. I love to break forward, to dribble and to make runs towards their goal. But I am enjoying it because it's football.\"\nBaltimore's impressive form and consistency kept England left-back Niamh Charles out of the team.\n\"She can defend well, but can also help the team move forward to create opportunities in the box. It's really nice to have a player like her,\" said Bompastor.\n\"I know different players are competing for that left-back position, but for me, she's really performing and helping the team.\n\"She is having success and it's not just in the last few weeks, it was almost from the beginning of the season.\"\nNathalie Bjorn\nChelsea broke the world record transfer fee to sign USA centre-back Naomi Girma in January.\nBut that only seemed to provide motivation for Nathalie Bjorn, who must have known her position in the team was under threat.\nAlongside captain Millie Bright, Bjorn has provided stability to Chelsea's defence, with only Manchester United conceding fewer goals throughout the campaign.\nAsked if she had gone under the radar this season, Bright said: \"Yeah, definitely. She's been incredible for us and is a vital part of the changing room.\n\"She keeps everyone together and sometimes that goes unnoticed a little bit as well. She has had a fantastic season and is so easy to play alongside.\n\"She just gives everyone confidence. She is such a team player and as long as the team performs and wins, that is all she cares about.\"\nWieke Kaptein\nOne of Chelsea's brightest youngsters is Wieke Kaptein, who signed from FC Twente in 2023 and returned there for a season on loan.\nThe 19-year-old has been a surprise standout under Bompastor, often praised for her work off the ball and how she reads the game.\nShe has been trusted in the big matches and given responsibility, starting in key games against Manchester United, Manchester City and Barcelona.\nSpeaking in October, Bompastor said: \"I am so happy to have her in my squad. She has a lot of energy as a person and as a player.\n\"She is someone who always wants to have some advice from the staff and the coaches. She's listening to us.\n\"Even if she is young, she already has a lot of experience as a player.\"\nHannah Hampton\nOne of the biggest changes to the Chelsea side under Bompastor is a consistent number one.\nGoalkeeper Hannah Hampton has stepped up to the task, performing when it matters and picking up the Player of the Match award in their title-winning match against Manchester United.\nBompastor has encouraged her side to play out from the back and adopt a less direct approach, and Hampton's distribution has proven to be vital in that.\n\"Hampton is probably the best keeper with the ball at her feet. Technically she starts off a lot of Chelsea's attacking play,\" said former England striker Natasha Dowie on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nEx-Scotland defender Jen Beattie added: \"She's been huge. You have all the history of Chelsea winning, but it's Hannah Hampton's first season of success.\n\"She has stepped up massively. She has kept them in a lot of games. It's a big jersey to fill but she has been awesome for this team.\"\nErin Cuthbert\nAn ever-present of Chelsea's success, Scotland midfielder Erin Cuthbert does not always get the spotlight but she remains a crucial member of the squad.\nThe 26-year-old has been involved in all six of Chelsea's successive title wins and has made almost 150 appearances for the club.\nShe has a habit of popping up in the big moments - scoring in their Women's FA Cup semi-final victory over Liverpool and providing the stoppage-time winner that sealed a 2-1 result at Manchester City in March.\nHer experience and leadership has been evident again this season and she was soaking up their success after Wednesday's latest title win.\nWhat makes her stand out?\n\"It's her mentality. Last season, when they lost at Liverpool and they thought they had thrown the league title away, I remember seeing Cuthbert on the pitch crying,\" said Dowie.\n\"You saw how much it meant to her to win this title, even though they had already won it for four years in a row. She is a mentality monster, a key player.\"\nHow Chelsea extended dynasty with latest WSL title\n- Published1 May 2025",
