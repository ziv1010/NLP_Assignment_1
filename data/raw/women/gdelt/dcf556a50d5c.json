She's got a really great touch onto the crossbar.\n\"She was awesome. For the youngest player in our team, her first opportunity in goals today, and she handled it like a pro.\"\nBray is the Jets Academy first-grade shot-stopper in NPLW NSW and was a trainee goalkeeper with the club's A-League side.\nShe is an under-16 and under-19 NSW Country cricket representative.\nTo make her international debut at such a young age was \"surreal\" for Bray, who is yet to have to choose between the two sporting codes.\n\"It's been a dream of mine since I started playing soccer and I couldn't believe it,\" Bray said.\n\"The nerves were up but I was also super excited. Walking out, I was taking everything in.\n\"I'm very proud and excited and I'm glad that my parents got to be there to watch me walk onto the field. Just singing the national anthem was a surreal experience and I almost cried to be honest.\n\"I was a bit nervous at the start but once the game started going on and I had a few saves, a few touches on the ball, I started getting more comfortable with the pace and ended up going pretty well.\n\"The end score probably didn't show it, but we played pretty well.\"\nToronto 16-year-old midfielder Emma Dundas, who had a break-out debut season of A-League Women with the Newcastle Jets, also started in the 3-0 loss.\nAustralia now turn their focus to Japan on Friday before rounding out the group phase against Thailand next Monday.\nThe top-two sides progress to the knockout phase with the top-three nations qualifying for the FIFA U17 World Cup in Dominican Republic (October 16-November 3).\nDower said the Junior Matildas \"technically were off the pace\" against a Chinese side coached by former Jets mentor Gary van Egmond and had \"it all to play for now in our next game on Friday\".",
