  "body_text": "Everton vs Brentford\nMatch Preview\nDominic Calvert-Lewin has resumed full training but is unlikely to start against Brentford\nEverton are back at Goodison Park following back-to-back away fixtures that, unfortunately, only yielded a point as they face in-form Brentford in what is another must-win game.\nThe Blues are still in the bottom three having lost at Arsenal and dropped two vital points against Nottingham Forest last Sunday but they can help their cause in a big way with victory over the Bees in front of their own fans this weekend.\nEverton scored twice in a game for the first time since October at the City Ground but scoring enough goals, particularly from open play, remains a challenge which is why the prospect, however slim, that Dominic Calvert-Lewin might be involved will come as a boost to Sean Dyche's side.\nThe striker rejoined full first-team training today as he continues his recovery from a hamstring problem that has sidelined him for the past five matches and will be assessed to see if he can play a part against Brentford.\nIt would seem unlikey based on Sean Dyche'c comments in his press conference at Finch Farm today that the striker will be ready to start what is a crucial fixture but he could be involved off the bench.\n\"Dom is in and around it again, with us training,\" the manager said. \"We are still making a decision on him being truly right to come back in.\n\"It's early yet, he's just got on the grass with us, but he's done a lot of rehab – the stats and facts – and the way he's feeling is good. It's positive signs – that's for sure.\"\nDyche has chopped and changed his options up front since taking charge, with all three of Ellis Simms, Neal Maupay and Demarai Gray having started since Calvert-Lewin's sole appearance under the new boss but Gray, having added to his tally as top scorer for the season against Forest, albeit from the penalty spot, could get the nod again.\nNathan Patterson is also close to a return but an unlikely starter while Andros Townsend remains a ways away from action after suffering some setbacks in his return from a ruptured ACL last year.\nVitalii Mykolenko, who missed the 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest last Sunday through illness, is available again and is expected to line up in an otherwise unchanged back four.\nBrentford's only defeat since the break for the World Cup was in the FA Cup Third Round against West Ham in January, a nine-game sequence in the Premier League that has them sitting in ninth place, just three points off sixth and very much in the hunt for Europe this season.\nIn addition to the excellent work done by Thomas Frank, the Bees' success has been aided by good fortune with injuries, although they stand to lose Ivan Toney to a lengthy ban at some point — although, sadly, his FA hearing regarding his confession to illegal betting won't be held before this weekend meaning Brentford's chief danger man will be available for them.\nOnly Keane Lewis-Potter (knee) and Thomas Strakosha (ankle) are ruled out for Brentford whose last three away games saw them beat West Ham and draw at both Leeds and leaders Arsenal.\nHaving lost at home to Aston Villa last time out, the visit of a side that hasn't lost since November would appear daunting to Everton but Dyche has overseen progress on the attacking front in recent weeks and he will, no doubt, be impressing on his players the need to replicate the performance that toppled the Gunners in his first match since succeeding Frank Lampard.\nKick-off: 3pm, Saturday, 11 March 2023\nReferee: Simon Hooper\nVAR: David Coote\nLast Time: Everton 2 -3 Brentford\nPredicted Line-up: Pickford, Coleman, Keane, Tarkowski, Mykolenko, Gueye, Onana, Iwobi, Doucouré, McNeil, Gray\nReader Comments (198)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Disclaimer ()\n1 Posted 09/03/2023 at 14:58:18\nSean didn't smile (the humour seemed lost on the Journos) but he said it in a very dry, humourless manner, which I read as complete apathy.\nDyche is clearly unimpressed.\n2 Posted 09/03/2023 at 14:59:48\nHe is not the messiah some people think, he won't return and score 10 goals till the end of the season. He is not Jelavic!!\nJust make sure he leaves this injury behind him for good.\n3 Posted 09/03/2023 at 15:26:27\nHe is beginning to sound like an extinct species, a lesser-spotted striker.\n4 Posted 09/03/2023 at 15:42:35\nMaybe if he concentrates on his football career instead of mincing about in dresses and handbags then we may have a chance. Transports Simon Jordan criticized him for being more like the talentless Sam Smith, and would want his centre forward playing on the field instead of poncing about in skirts?\nI have to agree with him. Won't be long before we have to refer to him as them or they, this is Everton after all.\n5 Posted 09/03/2023 at 16:02:09\nA really hard game tomorrow. Our most difficult home game since Brighton. Let's hope it's a different result. We need those 3 points. COYBs.\n6 Posted 09/03/2023 at 16:47:46\nWe play Saturday not Friday, admittedly the timings of the press conferences do tend to confuse us all.\nAs for Dominic, I hope if and when he comes back into the first team, he's fully fit and raring to go. Some might not like it, but he's a key player in our battle for survival.\n7 Posted 09/03/2023 at 16:49:28\nSomeone isn't telling the truth. And to be fair here, he's hardly a goal machine anyway, is he?\n8 Posted 09/03/2023 at 17:07:30\nI wouldn't read too much into Dyche's joke about fashion. I think he's taking the piss out of the journalist's dull questions rather than out of Calvert-Lewin.\nHe seems to do it a lot in press conferences. I must admit, I find it grates a bit, but I don't really blame him â€“ the questions are so fucking dull and predictable every week.\n9 Posted 09/03/2023 at 17:23:56\n10 Posted 09/03/2023 at 17:25:49\nHope he makes the bench, no matter how much he's criticised; we're a lot more attacking threat with Dom upfront.\nI don't listen to the supposedly expert Simon Jordan, a bitter and failed club owner, a bit like our Bill.\n11 Posted 09/03/2023 at 17:31:20\nDyche doesn't seem the type to bad-mouth his players to the press, but I'd imagine he's quite straight talking to them one on one.\n12 Posted 09/03/2023 at 17:44:40\nHow boring. How utterly boring. Such a trite set of comments. I imagine you'll be making them 20 years from now along with â€˜snow joke' and other boring well versed sayings.\nSo I'll trot out the same boring defence: whilst injured, rather than do drugs, stay out in the pubs or clubs or beat up women, Calvert-Lewin decided to do a fashion shoot. So bloody what? Such a shame â€˜supporters' like you find it so offensive.\nI'd rather have him than Bernard Mendy, Mason Greenwood or even Sigurdsson. But you knowâ€¦ Slag off our best players, matey.\n13 Posted 09/03/2023 at 17:53:24\nHowever, although he's not really that good, he is surely better than Maupay and more experienced than Simms (in whom Dyche has no confidence anyway), so I suppose it's good news.\nIt's still not going to stop us getting relegated though...\n14 Posted 09/03/2023 at 18:01:38\nIf he does get anywhere near the team, let's not cast him as saviour, that is an unreasonable expectation. At his best, he is better than anything we currently have ( and that's a very low bar) but he hasn't been at that level for a very long time and he also needs yet more time on the pitch to be match sharp. To the extent he makes an impact this season, I think it will be a modest one, unfortunately.\n15 Posted 09/03/2023 at 18:25:42\nSome people like their footballers to have more manly pastimes like alcohol, gambling and drug addiction, pigeons, sexual violence, domestic violence and just general violence.\nSuch footballers never get injured, after all. They're too hard and demonstrably have their heads in the right place.\n16 Posted 09/03/2023 at 18:26:29\nIt's a bit creepy how angry Calvert-Lewin makes some people in matters unrelated to football and how utterly devoid of wit their minging patter is.\n17 Posted 09/03/2023 at 18:27:28\nThe questions are monotonous, just like Dominic's injury, but trying to read in between the lines, I'm hoping that he's been doing a lot of running and is going to come back stronger than he's been for a very long time.\nIt's all very monotonous, I say the same thing every week and have tried to stay patient because of how valuable I think Calvert-Lewin is going to be if we are to beat the dreaded drop.\nGood point, Mark@14, but my own view is that Calvert-Lewin won't have to be brilliant to really help our team. Just having someone up front who can be a target, a wall, and a focus point, should give our players a lot more confidence.\n18 Posted 09/03/2023 at 18:52:54\n19 Posted 09/03/2023 at 19:01:14\nAny man who takes payment for allowing himself to dress as a schoolgirl in a men's magazine should expect flak. But I do find what Calvert-Lewin got up to in the mag â€“ perv's mag more like â€“ utterly embarrassing and yes, perverse. If you haven't seen the pics then look them up and see then if you think he's a good fit for the club.\nHe was a cheap option to Lukaku who we never replaced. I've never rated Calvert-Lewin and lots of others don't. Fantastic if he plays and keeps us up and he will gain hero status. But he's not the answer and never will be.\n20 Posted 09/03/2023 at 19:02:37\nIf doing a fashion shoot makes him feel better and improves his mental state as a result, then surely that can only be of benefit? Personally, I don't give a shit what he does in his own time. As long as he gives his best when he plays.\n21 Posted 09/03/2023 at 19:06:12\nI was fucking raging when I saw what Calvert-Lewin got up to. The club is a laughing stock as it is. You chill out, take a powder.\n22 Posted 09/03/2023 at 19:08:32\nIt's the closest we'll get to see any European competition for some time.\n23 Posted 09/03/2023 at 19:11:51\nA physical presence who might occupy defenders better than other options and maybe score the odd goal is what it's come to and probably the biggest reason we are where we are.\n24 Posted 09/03/2023 at 19:23:05\nAt his best, Calvert-Lewin could be the difference in claiming 3 points on Saturday. I hope he's fit enough to play and I hope that we claim all 3 points.\n25 Posted 09/03/2023 at 19:23:47\nThe questions are so banal, so obvious, so fucking expected.\nI think Sean's response was spot-on.\n26 Posted 09/03/2023 at 19:25:13\nGross negligence and not having a real plan does seem to be the biggest reason why we have become a shambles but it hopefully looks like Dyche has started to get the players who have “been assembled by several different managers and directors of footballâ€ a lot fitter and playing with a lot more discipline.\n28 Posted 09/03/2023 at 19:38:23\nAnd thanks, Mark, for the other more plausible sounding explanation of the presser remarks. I can trust Dyche will handle this with proper career-focused concern.\n29 Posted 09/03/2023 at 19:38:34\nDoes that make it better?\n30 Posted 09/03/2023 at 19:42:45\n31 Posted 09/03/2023 at 19:50:07\n32 Posted 09/03/2023 at 19:50:33\nCalvert-Lewin is not the reason we're where we are, it's not the lad's fault. It's not his fault, either, that he has been so fucking unlucky with injuries.\nHe's got what us dinosaurs would call a weird (and more) sense of fashion. So fucking what? He's 25, a footballing celebrity, a millionaire, and chooses to express himself as he wants. Good luck to the lad, the lad who scored the goal that probably kept us up last season.\nIf he wants to wear flared shorts (not a skirt) rather than drink and drive, get caught in compromising situations, or break the law, then good on him.\n\"The Bitters\" â€“ that's what the Red Shite call us. Reading some of the posts on here, they play right into their hands. Leave the lad alone and get a life, for fuck's sake.\n33 Posted 09/03/2023 at 19:56:25\n34 Posted 09/03/2023 at 20:21:02\nLet's hope he's fit enough to start making a difference, he might not be the best finisher but we definitely miss his aerial ability and his physical presence and we are screaming out for someone to get on the end of the crosses we've been putting in the box since Dyche came. The lad is due a bit of luck with the injuries.\n35 Posted 09/03/2023 at 20:23:49\n36 Posted 09/03/2023 at 20:27:29\nHe's been incredibly unlucky with injuries and apparently played through injury (when he shouldn't have) last season to help keep us up. Hopefully Dyche will manage him better than Lampard.\nI imagine he'll be making sub appearances for at least a few matches before he can start but a big improvement from bringing Gray or Simms off the bench.\n(Incidentally, I feel sorry for Simms who really would have been better served by continuing his learning at Sunderland.)\n37 Posted 09/03/2023 at 20:30:58\nThat was what I perceived Sean Dyche wanted to say to the reporter.\nThat was not me having a pop at any ToffeeWebber, ha ha,\nI have just re-read my post and it sounds like I'm having a pop at someone else's post. That was not my intention. Apologies if it read like that.\nIt's what I felt Dyche wanted to say when he said \"Yeah, me and Dom chatted fashion.\" I think he wanted to say \"Just fuck off, you gormless twat!\"\n38 Posted 09/03/2023 at 20:35:23\nGood post Brian. Maybe some of the Neanderthals on here can get someone to read it to them.ðŸ˜\n39 Posted 09/03/2023 at 20:41:35\nI apparently look like a throw back to the 1990s as I haven't changed my clothes or hair style since then according to family. If I ever had any style that is.\nWhat matters is what he does when he crosses that white line in a Royal Blue shirt. And I hope he does that soon.\nHe isn't the best but he is very good. He has his limitations. He's an in the box striker who needs delivery. In recent matches I've seen, he would have given us goals on the end of McNeil's very good delivery in my opinion.\nHe won't save us from relegation single handedly. But he can be part of a team that pulls us up the league table and contribute to doing that. I for one am not contemplating relegation anyway.\nHe is an Everton player and he gets the support of me when he's on that pitch. and will get us goals. Get fit Dominic and get back. Give me a diving headed goal that almost made cry and fall to my knees in May had the kind Crystal Palace supporters not embraced me and kept me on my feet!!\n40 Posted 09/03/2023 at 20:52:12\nUTFT!\n41 Posted 09/03/2023 at 20:54:33\nWe are an infinitely better side with him in.\n42 Posted 09/03/2023 at 20:54:43\nI know there were other issues and it was a different era.\nBut for those who watched him, did the fashion-conscious George Best's off field dress at the time impact their view of him as a footballer?\nI'll judge them on the pitch, not how they dress off it. That is irrelevant.\nBrentford in less than 48 hours. I hope Dominic features.\n43 Posted 09/03/2023 at 21:00:14\n\"Maybe if he concentrates on his football career instead of mincing about in dresses and handbags then we may have a chance. Transports Simon Jordan criticized him for being more like the talentless Sam Smith, and would want his centre forward playing on the field instead of poncing about in skirts? I have to agree with him. Won't be long before we have to refer to him as them or they, this is Everton after all.\"\nPaul â€“ you're everything I despise in a ToffeeWeb correspondent, Judgemental, ill-informed, and just plain nasty.\n44 Posted 09/03/2023 at 21:05:43\nBlow up doll, Don?\n45 Posted 09/03/2023 at 21:13:50\nSurely a broadcaster from Transport should be more supportive.\n46 Posted 09/03/2023 at 21:14:47\nThat goal, that powerful diving header, that incredibly, took one of the most powerful crowds I've ever witnessed up another level, will be remembered by us all forever, and this is what Calvert-Lewin can give us, especially now we have started getting the ball wide and delivering a lot more crosses into the box.\nI'm beginning to look forward to Saturday, and hope we get the same type of awful refereeing decision that Brentford got in this fixture last season at a time in the game when they were getting absolutely blown away.\nI can feel a little bit of belief slowly returning, and a win on Saturday would be absolutely massive.\n47 Posted 09/03/2023 at 21:16:16\nHe is an important player who, when fitter, will get regular goals. In the meantime, he will help us get results the hard way. I hope he has turned the corner now with his injuries and makes some good progress.\nI hope he is fit enough to give us 60 minutes on Saturday, it could make all the difference. Probably more likely that the team that faced Nottingham Forest starts and Calvert-Lewin comes on as reinforcements for the last 20 minutes or so. Whatever, it's great news he's back in full training.\nWhat he likes to wear is his business, why should he suppress what he is interested in? For fuck's sake, it's not like he's raping the mouths of the dead.\n48 Posted 09/03/2023 at 21:17:11\n49 Posted 09/03/2023 at 21:39:32\n50 Posted 09/03/2023 at 22:00:16\nSadly, it's Everton's lack of strategy to get in the right numbers of players in the forward line which has helped toward the current decline in scoring goals.\nIt's over half a decade (6 years) since Rom left; any club with serious aspirations to be competing in the Premier League would have addressed and fixed this straight away. The mind boggles. The more I think, the more it grinds how this has been allowed to happen.\nIf Pickford left, what would happen? Hypothetical but, if Calvert-Lewin gets seriously crocked, what will happen? The mind boggles. That's some going on pork scratchings in terms of goal-scoring capability to stay in this League.\nThe focus is on football, Everton beating Brentford, and surviving in the Premier League and, as a club, start a restart at in the close season at Board Level in a full or phased replacement programme. But the priority is Brentford, the most important objective to date this season is to win this game.\nWhat Calvert-Lewin or any other footballer does at Everton in their private life is up to them. Wear the shirt, play for the Everton shirt, and give blood, sweat and tears as is needed. That's the minimum Evertonians expect from every player and so it should be.\nSo this fixture is being built up by the media, like Brentford are in cruise mode to beat Everton. Sean Dyche will use this media focus to drive the Everton squad to beat Brentford. It will happen.\nUTFTs!\n51 Posted 09/03/2023 at 22:18:47\nEven with his injury, he's still at every game, shows his loyalty and passion for Everton, and his performance against Arsenal tells me he loves the club.\n52 Posted 09/03/2023 at 22:25:37\nFekkn v Palace last season at home Calvert-Lewin with Gray's brilliant delivery saved Everton's season in 2021-22.\nThe home game v Arsenal a month ago, they couldn't control Calvert-Lewin.\nIn context of life, it makes you think, but Everton and Evertonians must unite for this massive game v Brentford.\nUTFTs!\n53 Posted 09/03/2023 at 22:27:02\nKoeman threw him out on the wing initially which was bizarre for a player of his height. He was being asked to run up and down it thus putting his hamstrings at risk.\nOnly a year or so later, he is placed as our target man and emphasis is put on his aerial threat which puts stress on other parts of his body. Then Ancelotti coaches him to make short runs in the box which means twisting and turning.\nThe body likes routine and repetition but to keep changing what he was doing as a striker was always going to be a risk, especially given he isn't the quickest and was getting fouled a lot and knocked about going for headers.\nHis injury woes have been distressing and frustratingly long drawn out but this was a player who looked dead set to score over 20 goals in the season when the pandemic happened and was disrupted.\nI think we should be sympathetic towards him and not conflating his personal hobbies with him not making the first eleven.\n54 Posted 09/03/2023 at 22:39:34\nWell, he's already done that once, mate, and yet here you are banging on about him \"mincing about in dresses\" and \"poncing about in skirts\".\nI'm pretty sure he had an alternative dress sense at the time he scored the winner against Palace. I didn't see too many Blues worried about it then. You should probably consider being a little less worried about it now. It makes you come across as a bit of a dick.\n55 Posted 09/03/2023 at 23:04:50\nMy favourite call-out song, at Everton matches, and events.\nThe Golden Age of Everton as a benchmark and spiritual home and content with football â€“ Everton FC.\nThis weekend, all Evertonians, regardless of location and time zone, please make a minute to think before this game v Brentford.\nUTFTs!\n56 Posted 09/03/2023 at 23:06:27\nGood luck, Dom. We desperately need you.\n57 Posted 09/03/2023 at 23:14:49\nChips peas and onion gravy with 3 points.\nIt's the simple things in life that make you happy.\nMake me happy, Everton.\n58 Posted 09/03/2023 at 23:34:52\nPickford\nColeman\nKeane\nTarkowski\nGodfrey\nMcNeil\nIwobi\nDoucourÃ©\nOnana\nGueye\nCalvert-Lewin\n59 Posted 09/03/2023 at 00:10:26\nThis weekend is massive â€“ Waterloo, no, but a game Everton can't lose.\nUTFTs!\n60 Posted 10/03/2023 at 06:48:05\nThat being the case, I am hoping the manager selects the following as his starting line-up (4-5-1):-\nPickford,\nColeman, Keane, Tarkowski, Mykolenko\nGray, Doucoure, Gueye, Onana, McNeil\nMaupay\nIf Mykolenko isn't fit, Ben Godfrey no problem. I am looking for a goal each off Gray, Maupay, and McNeil.\nWe Shall Not Be Moved.\n61 Posted 10/03/2023 at 07:17:31\nMy concern is the pace they have in Wisaa and Mbeumo to get beyond our full-backs. Hopefully we can take something from this game.\n62 Posted 10/03/2023 at 07:28:29\nThere is very little chance that Dyche will change the starting XI; definitely he won't be dropping Iwobi.\nWhat I would like to see Dyche do is be more proactive with the subs. I can understand why Dyche might not want to change things in a game if we are drawing or leading by a solitary goal â€“ to try and keep what you have got. But at some point, he has to trust his bench.\nI would hope to see Calvert-Lewin and Garner at some point in the game so that they gradually start reintegrating back into the team.\n63 Posted 10/03/2023 at 07:41:04\nAs the closet Premier League club to my home, I have watched Brentford develop and have the utmost respect for what they have achieved and where they are compared to where they came from.\nAs I've said a few times, I used to coach alongside their youth teams. And I saw them build that new stadium only a stones throw away from Griffin Park.\nThey, along with Brighton, are an example how to run a club with a plan and strategy, both on and off the pitch. They have a very good manager who has tapped into his Danish links very well.\nWhether they can sustain it remains to be seen. It wasn't long ago we were citing Bournemouth and I even remember Charlton years ago. With no disrespect meant, these types of clubs tend to come and go.\nWe are Everton. The longest-serving member in the top flight of English football. We are playing at Goodison Park. I don't have hope. We go to win.\n64 Posted 10/03/2023 at 07:45:21\nIn a similar way, Maupay should not be blamed â€“ he isn't what we need, but whose fault is that?\nBrentford are on a great run, but it has to stop somewhere.\n65 Posted 10/03/2023 at 07:48:00\nYou are probably correct about him sticking with his last starting line-up. I just feel Gray is more of a goal threat.\nI actually have McNeil and Gray on the wrong flanks. I meant to have Gray on the left and McNeil on the right so that they can cut in and shoot with their preferred foot.\nGarner is an interesting shout â€“ the little I have seen of him, I think he has a bit about him. That's what we need.\n66 Posted 10/03/2023 at 07:57:33\nThey won't roll over tonight so we'll have to work very hard to earn a result. I'd like to see a bit more courage from Dyche in the starting line-up: Maupay and Gray up top together in a 4-4-1-1 â€“ but at least with Dyche we know, whatever the formation etc, the work rate and organisation will mean we create enough chances to win.\n67 Posted 10/03/2023 at 08:35:54\nWe can beat them, but we will need every ounce of the Goodson roar, and no mistakes at the back. I'm hoping for a 2-0 home win. Calvert-Lewin to score.\n68 Posted 10/03/2023 at 09:19:46\nEverton, on the other hand, is a backward-looking club, run by an overweight dinosaur, with a bang-average manager and average to poor to shite players.\nPremier League survival for another season is our goal. At least we don't have to worry about our “progressâ€ being halted by richer and more powerful clubs.\n69 Posted 10/03/2023 at 09:21:56\n\"Did the fashion-conscious George Best's off-field dress at the time impact their view of him as a footballer?\"\nWe all loved Best because he was a truly outstanding player right up there with all the world names but I would argue his off-field activities did impinge on his abilities and subsequent fall from grace.\nIf he wasn't attracted by so many external forces such as fashion, women and alcohol, would he have had a longer more fulfilling career?\nWhether right or wrong, the Calvert-Lewin situation can be interpreted as similarly not being 100% focussed. Is he really putting everything into improving his conditioning and game in general to contribute to the cause?\nI don't know but the early comments from Dyche suggest he's not convinced.\n70 Posted 10/03/2023 at 09:27:36\nAll rather childish because somebody might have a lifestyle that you wouldn't have for yourself and in itself shouldn't cause any anxiety. I perhaps could understand it if, after scoring, Calvert-Lewin ripped off his shirt revealing bra and knickers instead of the manly jock strap, depending on the colour and size, of course. Next thing you know he'll be wearing gloves in cold weatherâ€¦ Sheffield steel, eh.\nJustin Fashnau, anybody?\n71 Posted 10/03/2023 at 09:38:58\nAm I concerned about what he chooses to do in his spare time? No, I couldn't care less. I am only concerned with what he does inside the 18-yard box.\nI watched Brentford v Fulham. Brentford are going to be more than a handful. We need Calvert-Lewin back.\nAnd George Best? I consider myself privileged to have seen him play.\n72 Posted 10/03/2023 at 09:40:20\n73 Posted 10/03/2023 at 09:41:46\nYes, of course George Best's career was massively affected by his outside interests. You can't burn the candle at both ends like George did and continue to shine. That's why George's career as a top class footballer only lasted for 7 years but, in those 7 years, what a brilliant light he shone with his skill which was comparable with every world class footballer at the time and since.\nI, for one, think that Dominic is doing everything he can to try and get back to being the fittest that he can. Why wouldn't he? The rewards will make him a very rich man at a very early age. It all depends on how you look at life.\n74 Posted 10/03/2023 at 09:44:26\nEverton, on the other hand, is a backward-looking club, run by an overweight dinosaur, with a bang-average manager and average to poor to shite players.\nI can't disagree with a single word, but your comments did make me laugh.\n75 Posted 10/03/2023 at 09:47:07\nHow can you take Umbridge with that comment? He was doing what a good manager should do and diverting the whole thing being about Calvert-Lewin and his recovery.\nI am sure Dyche is as frustrated as every fan that we have only had 70 minutes from Calvert-Lewin this season. I am sure there are many managers who would keep moaning about his top striker being injured, but Dyche correctly isn't letting this group of players be able to use that as an excuse. He is treating Calvert-Lewin's injury the same as Townsend and Garner, he is giving updates but that's it.\nAmazing that Lampard seems to get away scot-free as to why he allowed this situation to have happened. He could have signed a striker when Richarlison went; he didn't. He waited till there were only days left before he signed Maupay.\nThis board and owner have a lot to answer for but us relying on a striker who wasn't fit for most of last seasn is the fault of Lampard and Thelwell.\n76 Posted 10/03/2023 at 09:47:25\nThere are several players I think should be left out, but I can't nominate anyone better to come in. That is Dyche's problem, the worst squad in my 65 years watching.\n77 Posted 10/03/2023 at 09:48:42\nAnd if he's that injury-prone, nobody will be signing him, as he won't pass any medical, meaning he's probably not going this summer.\n78 Posted 10/03/2023 at 09:55:29\nPickford\nPatterson\nTarkowski\nMina\nGodfrey\nGarner\nGueye\nDoucourÃ©\nGray\nCalvert-Lewin or Simms\nMcNeil (most improved under Dyche)\n79 Posted 10/03/2023 at 09:58:13\n80 Posted 10/03/2023 at 10:10:13\nMy dad worked for Laing during the rebuilding of Salford and Manchester back in Best's day. My dad was the site manager in charge of building and fitting George's first Boutique and took me along to the tape cutting.\nI was only around 8 at the time but I remember Best turning up in a flash car with a very beautiful lady on his arm. I don't remember if Mike Summerbee was there or not.\n81 Posted 10/03/2023 at 10:10:37\nI think there's a big difference between being interested in fashion and in alcohol! The latter will almost definitely affect your performance on the pitch; the former is surely harmless in and of itself.\nIf there were rumours of Calvert-Lewin missing training to do photo shoots, that would be differentâ€¦ but there aren't as far as I know. If he were passionate about computer games (like most footballers), no-one would care a bit.\n82 Posted 10/03/2023 at 10:10:43\nThe only reason Calvert-Lewin is being castigated is that he wears clothes you and I have no interest in being seen in, and did a shoot where he appeared in an androgynous outfit which people find challenging.\nIt's being used as a stick to beat him with over his injuries â€“ which is nothing short of preposterous. He's a good-looking young kid with money to burn, and fashion companies clamouring for his services and to be seen in their clothing â€“ so what?\nThe media whip this stuff up, and social media jumps on in, followed by supporters who like to use it as a convenient excuse for why he can't play.\nSean Dyche was deliberately alluding to the fashion thing as a dig at the media and the whole pointless hullabaloo over his injuries based on nothing but conjecture. Calvert-Lewin is injured â€“ it has nothing to do with his interest in fashion â€“ hence the dig by Dyche.\nSean Dyche is a very media-savvy manager who supports his players through thick and thin â€“ he was in no way having a pop at Calvert-Lewin â€“ quite the opposite, in my view.\n83 Posted 10/03/2023 at 10:13:01\nI've always thought, put the high profile names such as Klopp, Pep et al, and see what they could do at Rotherham, Sunderland, Huddersfield or Everton. Would anything change?\n84 Posted 10/03/2023 at 10:17:46\nJustin Fashnau, anybody?\nAlan, I don't quite follow that question. Could you explain?\n85 Posted 10/03/2023 at 10:29:44\n86 Posted 10/03/2023 at 10:32:30\nI do have a problem with him doing fashion shoots and commercials when he can't do his main job, ie, playing for us. The club should stop him doing any other work till he's fully fit.\n87 Posted 10/03/2023 at 10:38:58\nPlaying video games? Driving his car? Having a haircut maybe? What about going to nightclubs or the supermarket? Should he just sit at home quietly contemplating his injury until it clears up?\nI've been signed off work since December â€“ should I be allowed out of the house? Perhaps I should also stay indoors too, and heaven forbid, wear new clothes I've bought and be seen out in them.\nI bought a few new pairs of trainers too recently - shame on me.\nFootball clubs can't stop a player from doing other things in his spare time, injured or otherwise â€“ he's not in prison and it has no detrimental effect on his ability to play football for Everton. Sean Dyche alluded to this exact thing yesterday, yet you seem to think he's got a problem with Calvert-Lewin and has publically stated it â€“ he hasn't.\nIf anything, he should be doing other things while he's not able to play football. I can assure you, sitting around the house for months on end is not good for you physically or mentally, footballer or otherwise.\n88 Posted 10/03/2023 at 10:39:50\nI have some sympathy with that: he had one decent season but not a whole lot more. For sure, I'd sooner see him achieve higher things on the pitch than the fashion runway. George Best at least walked the walk.\nLike Paul H, I've rather given up on Calvert-Lewin. Not because he wears strange clothes but I think there is something not quite right with him, which I believe Dyche has already alluded to. I'd love to be proven wrong â€“ as I'm sure Dyche would.\nIt's a sign of the times that we approach a fixture at home to Brentford with some trepidation, and rightly so. They are less fragile than we seem to be and while it's a very small sample size, we have never beaten them in the Premier League â€“ here's hoping for a first...\n89 Posted 10/03/2023 at 10:48:51\nHe's supposed to be injured but still traveling and doing other work.\nI will phone my boss up and tell him I'm sick, then go and do another job. I'd get sacked if he found out.\n90 Posted 10/03/2023 at 10:49:05\nJustin Fashnau, anybody? Why would anybody care these days or at any time to be honest?\nIf Dominic was a serial killer but was fit and banging in the goals for the Blues, I think I could turn a blind eye to that, Justin Fashnau was himself nothing to see or worry about there.\n91 Posted 10/03/2023 at 10:54:36\nWhile we might be bound by the terms of our contracts to not take on any other paid work, Calvert-Lewin is not so he isn't governed by the same rules as we are.\nDo you have a problem with him doing punditry work as well while injured? Or is it just the modelling that bothers you?\n92 Posted 10/03/2023 at 10:57:41\nLike I said, he can do what he likes. But if you're not fit to do your main job, then maybe you shouldn't be doing other work.\nOnly my opinion.\n94 Posted 10/03/2023 at 11:01:58\nIf Dominic was able to play and score goals, nobody on here would give a damn. If he was like Haaland, Rooney (as was) or Jamie Vardy (as was), I'm pretty sure people would ignore him doing things that were deemed \"extra curricular\".\nThose players sweat blood when they play. They score goals. That's what they do â€“ come rain, come shine. Whatever is going on in their worlds matters not a jot.\nAt this time, Calvert-Lewin is none of those things and he doesn't play regular football. He is not and never will be a prolific goalscorer â€“ even when fit. People are simply frustrated that our one and only recognised striker is often injured. That's it.\nSome may think he is distracted by the fashion world? I'm sure that's not the case.\nTrust me, if he was like Haaland, Rooney or Vardy and banging in goals, whilst at the weekend he was spotted wearing Ken Dodd's Diddyman Hat, it wouldn't be long before we would all join him in the stands on matchdays, wearing the self-same hat and sporting tickling sticks.\nWe're not bothered how he dresses. He's just not there for us when we need him most and people are venting their spleens. It's what humans do.\n95 Posted 10/03/2023 at 11:07:56\nIn the meantime, to all lucky enough to go tomorrow and watch the glorious victory that lifts us out of the Bottom 3 â€“ have a great day, and as they say in Early Doors â€“ I wish I was there!\nFor those watching and commenting on the Live Forum, give it until half time at least before you give up on em, eh??\nUTFT!!\n96 Posted 10/03/2023 at 11:10:05\nIf it's 'just your opinion', then surely you have some logical reason for that opinion?\nI just don't get why supporters come on a site like this with an 'opinion' but don't back it up with sensible, logic-based reasons for those opinions. :)\n97 Posted 10/03/2023 at 11:11:56\nOn George Best, it's why I was careful to mention that other factors led to his demise rather than his fashion sense,\nI do get the point of off-field activities distracting from the primary contracted aim of a footballer, but I am sure the club sanctions such activities.\nRooney and others with film shoots for sponsors and global brands. Beckham building his brand. It's not new nor uncommon.\nLet's get him fit and back on the pitch. He can carry on with his other activities as much as he wants. I just want him fit and scoring a few goals. I agree, he isn't prolific, probably never will be, but he's what we have got and need.\nHopefully he will feature tomorrow, get the winner and set up the hard-working Maupay for the second.\n98 Posted 10/03/2023 at 11:20:47\nThe distance between the fans and the players has never been greater, but is that solely the players' fault or is it down to some of the fans who are prone to examine every minute detail of a players character and lifestyle, without fully knowing the facts or the person they are psychoanalysing?\nIt's simple for me: if he's not on the pitch or involved in the first-team, I don't give it a moments thought, although I am as deeply disappointed as others may be that a key player is absent.\nProfessionals have deemed him unfit to play or not good enough to be chosen; therefore, I tend to concentrate on those that are fit and ready and chosen to play. Criticism of a player's ability is legitimate; character assassination of a player â€“ for whatever reason â€“ isn't.\n99 Posted 10/03/2023 at 11:21:53\nCalvert-Lewin can model all he wants, but has not only got to get fit but also master his shooting and one-on-ones. Look at Salah and Kane, he's not in the same league. Van Persie, Drogba, Aguero â€“ the list of complete strikers is endless.\nRashford went through a dreadful patch, and an amazing talent, but it makes you wonder if his long dip in was because of his school dinners project? He wasn't focused on football and Calvert-Lewin needs to be. Fashion shoots can wait.\n100 Posted 10/03/2023 at 11:26:43\nHe's not fit and can't play football (his main job). He (in my opinion) shouldn't be doing other work but making sure he gets 100% fit. We are in a real fight to stay up but he's off doing other things.\nDo me a favourâ€¦\n101 Posted 10/03/2023 at 11:36:57\nThat's why I could never understand the hero status for Duncan Ferguson. Always off with his pigeons instead of working for what he was paid handsomely for. His head was never right. Just another phoney pretending to be injured and not working hard enough for the team.\n102 Posted 10/03/2023 at 11:43:02\nI'm glad we cleared this up.\nThere are no reasons, as far as I can tell, see or read as to why Calvert-Lewin shouldn't do modelling, or work in his local Post Office when he's out injured, and evidently, neither can you.\n103 Posted 10/03/2023 at 11:49:53\nCome off it â€“ there's just no logic to that thinking on any level.\nFootballers have a lot of downtime between training and games â€“ they do all sorts of things to fill their time. Modelling is the issue here because men feel threatened by it.\nNow someone has said that Duncan Ferguson pretended to be injured so he could fancy his pigeons! Hahaha!\n104 Posted 10/03/2023 at 11:50:18\n105 Posted 10/03/2023 at 11:55:15\nIs it a reason not to do other things? No, it's a reason to do other things.\n106 Posted 10/03/2023 at 12:00:54\nThey have not lost in 9, beating Liverpool and drawing with Arsenal. They do have strikers who can score and I don't think we have beaten them in the Premier League. COYB\n107 Posted 10/03/2023 at 12:11:40\n108 Posted 10/03/2023 at 12:14:58\nHope no one objects to my thoughts being on here.\nNow in my 62nd season supporting Brentford FC. For the first 50 of these, they were a Division 3 or 4 then League One or Two club whose main aim was to survive. We had some good times under stalwarts like Bill Dodgin, John Docherty, Steve Perryman and Steve Koppel but mainly it was an on-going struggle.\nThen, 13 years ago, we were a League 2 outfit with few prospects, having just had a near-extinction event under the charming Ron Noades. Once again, the fans had stepped in and saved the club from going under.\nThen a genuine fan, Matthew Benham, whose background was in mathematics, stepped in. What has happened since is an amazing journey which we old-timers still can scarcely believe. In the last 18 months, we have beaten Man Utd, Man City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool (reducing Mr Klopp to apoplexy) and lots of other huge names in football. Currently, we're in the Top 10.\nHow this has been achieved has been much discussed but often misunderstood. One of the most interesting aspects is how the process of scrapping the tried and tested methods and embarking on a new approach was viewed by the \"experts\". With very few exceptions, the assorted pundits, commentators, ex-pro rent-a-gobs and media tarts announced that \"It'll never work in England, he doesn't know what he's doing \" etc.\nWe were told that Brentford couldn't get out of League One; then that they could not survive long in The Championship. Last season it was: \"They won't get 10 points, no way can they survive with their budget\" etc etc.\nAt the beginning of this season, it was the usual nonsense: \"Second season syndrome\" (which is a myth long recited by lazy and ignorant journalists), \"Eriksen kept them up\" (no, he didn't â€“ although he certainly helped). How do these clowns make a living?\nAnyway, as to tomorrow... Bees will certainly travel full of confidence but it will be a very tough match for them as only a fool would underestimate a shrewd operator like Sean Dyche. Most of the wins this season have been with 35% possession.\nBrentford are trained to defend well and wait for the attacking side to lose the ball. They then break very quickly using the speed of Henry, Wissa, and Mbeumo, combined with Toney's exceptional hold-up play.\nI think the opening goal will be very important. A draw would not surprise me.\nAll the best to The Toffees for the rest of the season. How on earth a club with the history and tradition of Everton got in this mess is another story. But we wouldn't swap Matthew Benham for Bill Kenwright.\n109 Posted 10/03/2023 at 12:15:49\nAnyway, tomorrow, Everton 2 v 0 Brentford.\n110 Posted 10/03/2023 at 12:17:15\nDyche is fighting to ensure Everton stay in the Premier League and any players not getting on board with his methods or techniques will probably find themselves on the short end of his temper.\nCalvert-Lewin (sicknote) has obviously been rumbled by Dyche.\n111 Posted 10/03/2023 at 12:18:16\nSo basically you don't have any issues with him doing 'other things' when injured, but you take exception to him modelling, and specifically modelling in a pair of culottes. We got there in the end. :)\n112 Posted 10/03/2023 at 12:19:23\nBarry @98 agree with just about all of your post. It pretty much captures my opinion on Dominic and our focus tomorrow is on the players who are on the pitch or the bench. They are who matters tomorrow.\nJoe @99. Very good points on Beckham and Rashford. I was never really convinced that Beckham was one of football's greats. I may sound harsh or uneducated, but although in a different position and for different reasons, I saw parallels with Lineker. Not a particularly brilliant footballer but he brought something to impact the game in a very good team.\nIn Beckham's case, it was that ability at set pieces and delivery for the forwards. Lineker's was scoring goals, using his pace as he could barely pass or beat a defender with the ball at his feet on most occasions.\nOn Rashford, I agree. Now he's focussed back on his football, you can see the difference in him.\nRobert @101. Funnily enough, I was having discussion about Duncan Ferguson this morning. I too never really understood the cult status. My best mate got his hair styled in recognition of him in the 90s. Joe Royle called it right. For me, he underachieved.\nOkay, I can't question injury, but his indiscipline was also a factor. I get that for a generation, those fleeting moments were the only thing they had to hold onto. But he never really done it consistently enough to be called a legend other than for his character in my opinion.\nI always felt he was a reluctant footballer. That's just a hunch though, not based on any knowledge.\n113 Posted 10/03/2023 at 12:30:02\nI'll probably be travelling with half of your crowd there and back!\nAbsolutely outstanding what Brentford have achieved. I live in Uxbridge and coached at Hayes & Yeading for years, so I'm very familiar with Brentford.\n114 Posted 10/03/2023 at 12:31:49\nNice to hear from you again, a genuine supporter who has followed his club through thick and thin and is now getting plenty of enjoyment following the now most successful part of Brentford's history in English football.\nYou and your fellow Brentford fans deserve the rewards you now getting, seeing your club so high up in the premier league and watching such good attacking football, which an envious Everton fan wishes he was seeing from my club although the signs are slowly changing under Sean Dyche.\nAs for you and Brentford fans not wishing to swap Mathew Bentham for Bill Kenwright, I'd swap Kenwright for Charles Bronson if he gets his parole!!\n115 Posted 10/03/2023 at 12:34:07\n116 Posted 10/03/2023 at 12:41:15\nI think that's a real possibility regarding Rashford and certainly Man Utd fans weren't slow in coming to that conclusion â€“ it's all about perception.\nCalvert-Lewin might be working like trojan for all we know but becoming a perma-crock whilst advertising shavers amidst fashion shoots leaves him open to \"not arsed, mind elsewhere\" comments.\nMind youâ€¦ what footballer is arsed these days?\n117 Posted 10/03/2023 at 12:45:43\nTalk up the other players, try putting some more confidence in them.\nThis is a massive game for us; tough opposition but â€“ if they improve just a little from Forest game, 3 points are there for us. COYB!\n118 Posted 10/03/2023 at 12:46:29\nWhatever anyone else thinks of him is up to them but, for me, he was an Everton hero and always will be. Evertonians love their centre-forwards.\n119 Posted 10/03/2023 at 12:49:11\nI was thinking you might come on mate, and after reading your wonderful post about how Brentford have continually made fools out of the ignorant fools, then I wouldn't swap Bentham for Bill Kenwright either. You deserve all the success you are getting, aided and abetted by a true Brentford fan who had a vision for your football club and not a vision that was just for himself.\nYou don't get anywhere far if you haven't got a plan. This is why I genuinely wish your football club all the success in the world, John.\nI thought you were awful at Goodison in the cup, and I definitely thought you were going to be dragged into the relegation battle after I saw your display that day. Erickson does deserve a lot of credit because you haven't looked back since you signed him, even if he has since left your club.\nI said earlier in this thread that I hope we get the rub of the green that you lot got at Goodison from Michael Oliver last season. Although he gave us a dodgy penalty, I think the damage came when he never gave us an earlier penalty, and couldn't wait to burst our balloon (this is how it felt to me, John!) about 10 seconds later.\nWe were probably playing as well as we ever did under Frank Lampard that day. Hopefully we can put in a similar performance tomorrow but with eleven men performing for 90 minutes.\nBest of luck to the Bees though, John, especially for the old timers like yourself who have stood the true test of time; you must be thoroughly enjoying yourselves right now.\n120 Posted 10/03/2023 at 12:52:19\nApart from Kevin Sheedy. He could walk on water, across puddles and not get his feet wet.\nIs he available tomorrow?\n121 Posted 10/03/2023 at 12:53:55\nMy dad used to moan about what could have been with Brian Labone, who wasted his talent with bloody stamp collecting. Bobby Moore wasn't a patch on Labone but fulfilled his potential through having no hobbies whatsoever.\n122 Posted 10/03/2023 at 12:57:28\nRashford transformed once Ronaldo was out of the club.\nI don't usually comment on the team selection but have been disheartened with Onana's performance in the last three games. He doesn't seem to be up for the fight despite his gesturing to the crowd. He hardly touched the ball against Forest and, from what I saw, did not create an outlet for the man on the ball, ie, he was always behind a Forest player. I'd drop him.\n123 Posted 10/03/2023 at 13:05:21\nBrentford are one of the most improved teams in English football. They have pace, tenacity and score goals. None of which apply to us.\nIs this another must-win game? Because time is running out... fast.\n124 Posted 10/03/2023 at 13:11:57\n125 Posted 10/03/2023 at 13:13:52\nThey're levels above our rabble and I can see us getting done. Sadly I think this is one of the games we really have to win to stand a hope in hell's chance of staying up.\nIf you look at our fixtures remaining, it's very difficult to see where enough wins are going to happen.\n126 Posted 10/03/2023 at 13:13:56\nAs I said, \"possibly\".\nDoesn't detract from the perception of plenty of Man Utd fans putting his drop in form down to off-field activities. Certainly not heard \"it was Ronaldo's fault\" from any.\n127 Posted 10/03/2023 at 13:17:35\nIncreasingly our fate also lies in the hands of others and what they do around us. If the teams around us start picking up the odd win or two, as they have been doing, my fear is us beginning to be cut adrift by the start of April. I really don't think a draw will do here...\n128 Posted 10/03/2023 at 13:27:44\n129 Posted 10/03/2023 at 13:37:51\n130 Posted 10/03/2023 at 13:47:45\n131 Posted 10/03/2023 at 13:49:16\nWelcome back, mate. I was scrolling through this to see if you'd pop up with your perspective. Your team are having quite the season. And Frank has proved he wasn't a one-season wonder, aka Laudrup at Swansea.\nGood luck â€“ other than tomorrow, of course!\n132 Posted 10/03/2023 at 13:51:08\nI never understood the hero worship of the felon pigeon whisperer either. What a waste of talent. Brilliant when he could be bothered but that was very rare.\n133 Posted 10/03/2023 at 14:00:28\nThe main problem for me is our three-man midfield, as it's way too safe and way too negative. Try a two in there and play two up front for once... a 4-4-1-1 would be ideal for us now, but is our Gaffer brave enough to play it?\n134 Posted 10/03/2023 at 14:02:12\nCalvert-Lewin is back doing his job, as Dyche has said he's back taking part in full training with the rest of the squad, and no doubt will be available for tomorrow.\nAs regards this “other jobâ€, as you call it, I don't think Calvert-Lewin, or anybody else for that matter who may do modelling, is sprinting up and down a catwalk, jumping into the air in the process, twisting and turning, being clattered from behind etc. So there's not much danger of any serious injury whilst on the catwalk.\nJeez, you'll be saying he shouldn't be advertising razor blades next, for fear of slitting his throat!\n135 Posted 10/03/2023 at 14:04:04\nUp next: Chelsea then Man Utd away, Spurs at home. I'd take 6 points from these next 4 games today. Reality is 4 points. Beat Fulham at home, draw at Palace. We could be on 30 points with 6 to play?\nWe still have Man City, Newcastle and Brighton to play, out of which I think we could beat Newcastle at home, they can't score in a brothel now, but zero chance v Man City and Brighton. So, 33 points with away games at Leicester, Wolves and home to Bournemouth. Realistically, those last 3 are all shite teams, but so are Everton.\nI will stick to 36 points total â€“ right on the borderline considering the amount of teams involved in this relegation stuff.\n136 Posted 10/03/2023 at 14:05:41\n137 Posted 10/03/2023 at 14:11:55\n138 Posted 10/03/2023 at 14:15:08\nWould like some of the amazing mind readers on here who know what Sean is thinking to tell us more. Unless, of course, Sean is in touch with them to confirm he shares their odd fixations.\n139 Posted 10/03/2023 at 14:22:53\nAll professional footballers are under contract and when injured it is up to the medical staff to determine if there is anything that they are doing after treatment that is not detrimental to their recovery.\nAs far as posing in a fashion magazine in clothes that very rarely become an item that the average person can afford never mind wear, as long as it is not slowing Calvert-Lewin's recovery, who cares?\nI think most young people, from about 16 to their mid- or late-20s, like to dress fashionably but not outlandishly like models in a glossy magazine, who rely on well-known personalities to show off their designs.\nIt must not be slowing Calvert-Lewin's recovery as the club would have stopped it â€“ just get him out on the pitch playing.\n140 Posted 10/03/2023 at 14:46:05\n141 Posted 10/03/2023 at 14:49:52\nI don't take winning for granted. I played football, coached football and have watched Everton enough in my life to know winning isn't guaranteed, but we go there tomorrow aiming to win, not thinking we will lose.\nWe were going to be overrun by Leeds apparently. We had no chance at home to Arsenal apparently.\nWe got 6 points from those two fixtures.\n142 Posted 10/03/2023 at 14:49:58\nWe have to plan on going ahead and somehow holding on for a win\nIf we go behind we're snookered\nWe can't keep saying we're improving under Dyche, we don't have enough games left\nWe need wins not plaudits for improvement\nA win at home tomorrow is an absolute must nothing else is good enough\n143 Posted 10/03/2023 at 14:56:41\nI would go with Garner in the central area in the hope that he might add the creativity needed to open them up.\n144 Posted 10/03/2023 at 15:02:34\n145 Posted 10/03/2023 at 15:03:24\n146 Posted 10/03/2023 at 15:03:58\nThe bigger picture here is that due to the appalling management of our club we are once again in a fight for survival and DCL is probably our last throw of the dice to keep us up. He's not even that great a player but he has enough to possibly make a difference to this poor team of ours in the remaining games and I want to see him back in the team.\nIrony of all this DCL talk is that if we get beat tomorrow it's probably all over for us and we won't see him play for us again anyway as our beloved owner will see him as another way of recouping some more money.\n147 Posted 10/03/2023 at 15:10:41\nJust watched that training session video and DCL looked ok and with how slippy the pitch must be I cant see them letting him extend to much if his injury is not ok for stretching.\nThe only laugh I get is when they say they are training in snow covered pitches. I know its where I chose to live but twice this week I have cleared over 1ft of snow off my driveway and deck.\nLets hope that DCL is ok to come off the bench as I don't think they will start him.\n148 Posted 10/03/2023 at 15:45:48\n149 Posted 10/03/2023 at 15:50:43\nI believe the one thing that Dyche is starting to install in the players is confidence in each other, and at Goodison Park I cant see any team, like you say, over running us. Most games are won in midfield but the danger I see from Brentford is they like to use the long ball to by pass the midfield and pressure the back line.\nThere is no thing as an easy game, but at home a win is to be expected. Have a safe Journey.\n150 Posted 10/03/2023 at 15:52:53\nGreat insight into Brentford's adventures of the past, they seem a thoroughly well run club and a team that's developing really well.\nThanks for the good wishes, it's good to see other teams' fans wanting us to do well, as I normally find that other fans are chomping at the bit for us to drop.\n151 Posted 10/03/2023 at 15:56:12\nIt will be a boost if Domenic makes the matchday squad but I can't see him starting.\n152 Posted 10/03/2023 at 16:57:06\nAnd also, he wasn't up to scratch, and with the pressure mounted on his shoulders from managers and fans alike, I'm sure it didn't help.\nSo Dyche, pleasingly, seems to have adopted a much more patient approach in the hope of getting long term recovery. For this reason also, I can't see him starting tomorrow, or indeed next week.\nBut having him on the bench and able to come on with 20 minutes remaining will be a huge boost. If we're drawing, he is an option to potentially win it, and if we're winning, he's an option to help us secure victory with his hold up play.\nExpect an unchanged team from Forest, maybe with the exception of Mykolenko for Godfrey.\n1-0 to the Everton!\n153 Posted 10/03/2023 at 17:05:36\nthanks for that slight bit of optimism. I know we had 15 points from 19 games compared with 19 from 15 last season, which was a horrible portent. At least we are back \"on track\" and in with a chance with Dyche.\n154 Posted 10/03/2023 at 17:11:08\nWill DCL play who knows, I think it will undoubtably improve our chances if he does. I see Richarlison is moaning he's getting very little playing time which is no great suprise is it, he would have been better staying with us and playing every game if fit.\nThe betting is pointing to another draw but we need a win urgently.\nIts difficult to keep Toney quiet it seems, if we can I'm hoping we can scrape a win. It would be worth Moshiri's weight in gold.\n155 Posted 10/03/2023 at 17:22:22\n156 Posted 10/03/2023 at 17:32:05\nDo you really care what DCL wears in his spare time? Does anyone on here really care about what any of our players wear in their spare time? I only care what they wear come match-day, and I hope that DCL manages to get his tracksuit off at some point and get onto the pitch. Come on Dom, I want to see the number 9 on your back and your arms aloft.\n157 Posted 10/03/2023 at 18:00:53\nAgree, we are Everton, but lets put it into perspective we cannot change our PL history, other than one FA cup win we have done nothing of note.\nI'm fortunate to have seen the glory days when we ruled, Watford 84, Rapid Vienna & Bayern in 85.\nI feel the pain and extreme sorrow for those tounger fans who travel all over the country to support us and have not see us win a single piece of silverware.\nWe need to push for a new owner and new board. Those who share the same mindset as us 'this is Everton' and needs to get back to where we belong. Challenging for top honours.\nAt present the likes of Brighton under Paul Barber have an excellent operating model in place, it's run like a well oiled machine. If there is a model is place any business can work, despite what history tells us.\nProactivity is what i'd call it and there is no evidence at our club this exists. It's paramount that the priority has to be the removal of those on the board at Everton and possibly the owner to sell to someone who can take the club forward, anything else is irrelvant as far as i'm concerned. These people will to drag the club down the mire.\nI'm glad the majority of our fanbase are now see the real issue and the prominent and constant denominator being a chairman who hasn't been fit for purpose (which i've continously called out for over 15 plus years) is now of the same opinion by many others.\n158 Posted 10/03/2023 at 18:23:46\nI thought exactly the same. Tom D looked very sharp, very keen. Simms looked liked his touch was off and I saw Garner cross a beauty for Doucoure to score at the far post. Dom scored too and looked okay. I suspect he's not far away\n2-1 the Toffees !!\nDoucoure and Tom at the double, its written in the stars\n159 Posted 10/03/2023 at 18:56:24\nJust be honest and admit you're confronted by a man in a skirt (or whatever it was).\nPersonally, I think it's fine for him to have an interest outside of football. I'm not sure it's really anything to do with me but it makes sense that an injured footballer would do something of low intensity and that he enjoys with his time\nWhereas Darron Gibson's interests while injured were perfectly legitimate to challenge.\n160 Posted 10/03/2023 at 19:28:48\nErnie, no, I don't think they did. They might have though had he worn a skirt, let's be honest.\n161 Posted 10/03/2023 at 19:35:37\nOnly left Everton a couple of years ago. Absolutely astonishing stuff.\nThe fucking state of Kenwrights Everton. Laughing stock. Absolutely miles away from Brentford and OMG what I would give for a Chairman like Matthew Benham.\n162 Posted 10/03/2023 at 19:40:51\nThey just call them kilts in Scotland and its acceptable for males ro wear them.\nBrentford tomorrow. The players will be wearing Royal Blue shirts, white shorts and white socks.\nThey can wear what they want after we win.\n163 Posted 10/03/2023 at 19:52:45\nKilted Scotsmen do not look like schoolgirls!\n164 Posted 10/03/2023 at 19:55:26\n165 Posted 10/03/2023 at 20:16:53\n166 Posted 10/03/2023 at 20:18:22\n167 Posted 10/03/2023 at 20:46:02\nSo which prick will eventually have such low morals that he or she will say \" okay I was 48th choice but I'll present MOTD.\nMy money is on Bill Kenwright !!!\n168 Posted 10/03/2023 at 21:06:11\nAll footballers have plenty of spare time, it's not like they're doing 12hr shifts down the mill, and finding a way to occupy that time I imagine is of prime importance.\nSome footballers focus on entrepreneurship, others playing video games, others golf and etc...others are into partying, gambling.\nsome are more detrimental than others, but pretty sure modelling didn't cause David Beckham too many issues when winning everything there was to win with Madrid and Man U. Ronaldo also seemed to make a reasonable career while also doing multiple modeller contracts. Zlatan too managed to squeeze a few goals in between shoots.\nSo really, is it really an issue to be discussed?\n169 Posted 10/03/2023 at 21:06:29\nIt seems fashionable to join the queue to kick the shit out of us these days. When did this become the norm?\n170 Posted 11/03/2023 at 00:37:04\n171 Posted 11/03/2023 at 06:29:30\nMake it worth my while blues.\nRandomly, I've got the \"Get down to Goodison\" tune / chant in my head.\nDoes anyone remember it from the 80s Radio City advert or am I imaging it and making it up?\nSee some of you there.\n172 Posted 11/03/2023 at 06:44:29\nI think we will win 1-0. COYB\n173 Posted 11/03/2023 at 07:22:06\nDanny, I hope to see you later, we'll be in the Harlech Castle just up from the Oak and opposite KFC on County Road. At least you can get served in there if you get there fairly handy. Oak rhymes with joke these days, 5 deep at the Bar and that blaring repetitive music from the '60s. '70s and '80s.\nDark House similar (without the music) unless you get in early, though always have a chat with George McKane. Miss that part of it, and that lovely Madri Lager.\n174 Posted 11/03/2023 at 07:35:10\n175 Posted 11/03/2023 at 08:15:46\n“Get down to Goodisonâ€ was indeed the start of the advert with a bit of dialogue as to who we would be playing in the upcoming match.\nDerek, 'oak' has always rhymed with 'joke'!\n176 Posted 11/03/2023 at 08:45:10\n177 Posted 11/03/2023 at 08:46:19\nIn the Championship and the League, a centre-forward would still be expected to do the basics right and follow tactics. Quite a few Everton players don't and can become invisible in games.\nMartinez fell down on defensive tactics and wasn't aware enough to keep defenders at it. Silva had the right tactics and worked extremely hard at preparation, but was let down by players and the Director of Football.\nAncelotti played a low technical type of football, believing not enough of the players had enough technical ability. This actually suited Calvert-Lewin. Lampard was into drills to try to compensate for a lack of technical ability. Dyche is into data and he is quite good at implementing it into tactics. The club management are into making a profit out of transfers, with a make-do-and-mend attitude to the squad.\nCalvert-Lewin is a Premier League player. He does have the ability, but shortage of forwards means he has been pushed into the coveted centre-forward role at Everton, with all its pressures, and played when injured. He has only ever been a professional footballer and has occupied that rarified atmosphere that we can only guess and dream about, and with the accompanying attitude we will never understand.\nPreparation of footballers isn't the best at Everton and rehabilitation has let down many players and could be even said to have been abused by some.\nCalvert-Lewin has the attitude of a top footballer and does a lot of training, particularly in the gym, but other areas have been neglected in resilience and technicality. The latter could be different coaches with different ideas.\nCalvert-Lewin alone will not be Everton's saviour. He may make a contribution, but it will be an overall improvement in the team that is needed. Something that Dyche is making progress on, game after game.\nAs for his fashion sense, I remember going into the Camden Palace in London in the New Wave '80s and thinking what good fun it all was, though I had my blue shirt, brown shoes, Farah trousers and one of the lad's jumpers on. I just think Calvert-Lewin has a similar interest and it doesn't reflect on his character.\n178 Posted 11/03/2023 at 08:46:40\nWithout any dramatics, today is most probably my last game at TDH and Goodison. I have been quite ill for a few weeks and, due to intense pressures of Yellow House work and a few other factors, I will be moving to Italy permanently by the end of March.\nI will Celebrate Vincent Van Gogh's Birthday with Yellow House on 30 March and leave the next day for Belle Italia (Puglia). I can always be contacted via www.italianinspirations.it, and I will follow TW as normal.\nLet's hope for a good - or any win - today.\nGod Bless Father Winder and Cardinal Godfrey â€“ give my regards to Scottie Road and St Ollie's and Anne McKane and Ma Joad.\nUp The Blues.\n179 Posted 11/03/2023 at 09:18:34\nSo sorry to hear you are leaving Liverpool, The Dark House, Everton and Goodison Park.\nI only met you a couple of times; you left me with a very good impression of an open-hearted, genuine man not afraid to say what he had to say â€“ talked but never boasted about his excellent contribution to the lives of young men he was trying to rehabilitate into society through his work at Yellow House.\nI hope you enjoy the rest of your time inNew Brighton and Liverpool and have a good time in Italy, best of luck and I hope your health improves enough for you to spend many years in your new home.\nThanks for your contributions to ToffeeWeb and very best wishes to you and your wife,\n180 Posted 11/03/2023 at 09:23:41\nYou probably won't remember but I did some work with Yellow House â€“ sending students for work experience and inviting you and the team into schools to talk to students about coping with mental health problems.\nAnyway, all the very best â€“ a true one-off.\n181 Posted 11/03/2023 at 09:32:27\nVita lunga e felice!\n182 Posted 11/03/2023 at 09:54:50\nGeorge, I'll call in to see you.\nDerek likewise, then I've got to get to the Brick and Winslow to catch up with a few others.\nBusy day notwithstanding the important match.\nAnd then my rituals of the Goodison Supper Bar and the Arkles.\nI should squeeze it all in and I'm not leaving it to the last train today.\nLet's go and do this, Everton.\n183 Posted 11/03/2023 at 10:00:58\nIf Calvert-Lewin is League One standard, what does that make Maupay and Simms, who can't fill his boots??? He's definitely not a distraction; a fit Calvert-Lewin is a huge addition for survival this season.\nGeorge #174,\nSorry to hear of your illness, and hope you relax and enjoy your time in Italy.\n184 Posted 11/03/2023 at 10:25:58\nA great Evertonian and human being - where's the knighthood!\n185 Posted 11/03/2023 at 10:30:04\nAs for today's game, we are back in the hideous position of needing three points and some sort of turning point.\nBrentford are in good form, unbeaten in 12 games and a well organised outfit with a superb striker and a coach who makes decisive tactical changes and doesn't leave them till the last minute.\nHowever, we looked up for the fight last weekend and we are capable of springing a surprise today. I hope to see Domenic on the bench and plenty of blood and thunder on the pitch.\n186 Posted 11/03/2023 at 10:55:30\n187 Posted 11/03/2023 at 10:56:54\n188 Posted 11/03/2023 at 11:34:50\n189 Posted 11/03/2023 at 11:41:11\n190 Posted 11/03/2023 at 11:49:49\nFinch Farm to the right Speke to the left.\nI'm going in. See you there and talk later.\n191 Posted 11/03/2023 at 11:51:02\nAlan, thanks for the clarification. I understand now the point you were making, and fully agree, the lad has a life and a lifestyle he chooses and none of us have the right to dictate how that should go.\n192 Posted 11/03/2023 at 11:53:41\nBest of luck in Italy George and enjoy today\n193 Posted 11/03/2023 at 11:59:09\n194 Posted 11/03/2023 at 12:00:22\n195 Posted 11/03/2023 at 12:23:20\nAnd, for the record, that 'handbag' was actually a bag for his shinpads which these days are the size of austerity-hit custard creams!!\nThe Toffees for the win today... DCL to come on in the last 20 and score the winner... COYB!\n196 Posted 11/03/2023 at 12:55:12\n197 Posted 11/03/2023 at 13:01:17\n198 Posted 11/03/2023 at 13:21:55\nGood Luck and but of heat will do harm.\n199 Posted 11/03/2023 at 13:28:12\nLosing today would be disastrous but I don't think a draw would be awful. I see Everton finishing on 35 points and staying up. I have three further wins from future games but not today\n200 Posted 11/03/2023 at 13:29:50\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
