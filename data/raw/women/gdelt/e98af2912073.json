Lion cake to wish our girls the very best of luck today. #womensfootball #lionesses.”\nThe cake was a tribute to the England women’s football team who were playing in the World Cup Final on the day she posted the photo.\nThe former IT manager’s death was announced on her Instagram page on Friday 5 July. The post read: \"It's with a heavy heart we announce the passing of our star baker Dawn. Not only a wonderfully talented baker but first and foremost an amazing mother, grandmother, wife and friend.”\n\"Dawn passed away peacefully surrounded by her family. We will miss her forever, but promise to continue her baking legacy!\" The message was signed off with a single white heart.\nTributes have flooded in from followers and Bake Off friends.\nGuiseppe Dell’Anno, who won the competition in 2021, wrote: “This is devastating news… I only met Dawn once, but I was blown away by her joyous personality and her infectious smile. She will be sorely missed, but will live in the heart of those who loved her forever!”\nThe official page for The Great British Bake Off posted: “We’re so sorry to hear this news. Thinking of your family and sending lots of love,” while series judge Paul Hollywood wrote: \"I'm so sorry to hear that, send my love to the family a lovely lady x.\"\nBake Off 2021's George Aristidou added: \"We never did get to make them koupes Dawn…Absolutely gutted to hear this very sad news. RIP and my condolences to all your family and friends x.\"",
