The viewer sees how playing sport equipped the girl with the skills and belief to push on in life, empowering her to go on to achieve success as an adult.\n'Play On' is a four-year campaign that aims to combat the problem of young girls dropping out of sport by highlighting the benefits that playing sports on the pitch can make to their lives off the pitch.\nLiverpool FC and Standard Chartered launched this campaign at the end of May to coincide with the last Premier League game of 2022-23.\nThe first video, 'I Quit', was a faux post-match press interview that stopped you in your tracks. It featured four Liverpool men's players announcing they're done with football. However, the twist was that the reasons they give for quitting are some of the reasons young girls give every day around the world for not continuing on with sport: not fitting in with friends, lack of parental support, safety and body image concerns.\nIn a rousing follow-up video a week later, they launched 'Team Talk' featuring manager Jürgen Klopp calling for players to go for it, be brave and not to give up. In another surprising turn of events, when the camera pans out, instead of the expected Liverpool squad, the viewer sees a room full of inspired teenage girls hanging on Klopp's every word. These girls are participants of LFC Foundation's community schemes in Liverpool and Standard Chartered's Goal programme.\nIn addition to this engaging social media campaign, LFC and Standard Chartered have created a dedicated 'Play On' web page here: a digital repository where girls, teachers, coaches, parents and anyone interested in supporting young girls can go to learn more about the campaign and have access to useful resources.\nNext season, LFC and Standard Chartered will look to take 'Play On' into some of their key markets in Asia and Africa with the 'Train the Trainer' programme, where coaches from LFC Soccer Schools and the Foundation will work with Standard Chartered's Goal programme NGO delivery partners to offer a knowledge and coaching programme delivered exclusively to women and girls.\nBen Latty, commercial director at Liverpool FC, said: \"We are so proud to be involved in this pioneering campaign, and to put our full support behind it.\n\"The first instalments of the 'Play On' campaign have grabbed headlines, and rightly so, and brought this important issue to the top of the agenda. It has been fantastic to work on this campaign with our principal partner, Standard Chartered, who recently extended their partnership with us through to 2027. We are looking forward to continuing to build on what has been achieved so far.\"\nCommenting on the campaign, Matt Parish, CEO of LFC Foundation, said: \"The LFC Foundation is committed to ensuring equal opportunities for women and girls. Through 'Play On' we will work with Standard Chartered to provide aspirational and inclusive activities to support and inspire girls to stay in sport.\"\nClaire Dixon, group head, corporate affairs, brand & marketing, Standard Chartered and chair of the Standard Chartered Foundation, added: \"We know that sport can play an incredibly important role in teaching young girls confidence, teamwork, resilience and leadership. But globally, twice as many girls than boys stop playing sport by the age of 14. We want to change that.\n\"Our Standard Chartered Futuremakers and Goal programmes recognise the important role sport can play in teaching critical life skills which equip women to go on to be the very best they can, whatever their chosen career path.\n\"This joint initiative with Liverpool Football Club, our long-term partner and one of the world's most popular football clubs, will encourage girls around the world to continue in sport, as well as provide educational and inspirational resources for them to do so. Together, we want to encourage girls, support them every step of the way, and help them Play On.\"\nThis campaign launches just ahead of the Women's World Cup in July, where all eyes will once again be focused on women's football and encouraging the next generation of females to play on.",
