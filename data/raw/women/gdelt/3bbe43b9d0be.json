The atmosphere at the opening game was crazy with 70,000-plus there.\nMr Kelly said the English women, known as the Lionesses, have a big following, which will further add to the contest.\n\"Any football in England is huge,\" he said.\n\"What I will say, I've lived in England, America and Australia and Australia's love of sport in general is crazy. I haven't seen a country get behind an event like Australia does.\nIN THE NEWS:\n- Tillies get green light as Albury and Wangaratta confirm live sites\n- Fee-fi-fo-fum, the Tillies are a dilemma for this Englishman\n- Support for wildlife corridor as tip roads work gets nod\n- Man hit in head with hammer by own mother, pair both face charges\n- Holbrook siblings bound for South Africa in national polocrosse team\n\"I guess the men aren't as hopeful of winning one, whereas the women are a much better chance.\n\"You look at the Socceroos (in the last World Cup), there was only (goalkeeper) Mat Ryan who was playing in the Premier League in England, where almost all of the Matildas are Women's Super League players.\"\nMs Morris was captured on the broadcast as the Matildas celebrated their fourth goal in a 4-0 win against Canada to secure a place in the round of 16.\n\"The game against Canada was probably the best one though because we were literally on the front row,\" she said.\n\"I got a million messages about it.\"\nAfter a dramatic penalty shootout victory in the quarter-final against France, Ms Morris is confident the Matildas can go all the way.\n\"We were at home watching the quarter-final and I don't know how many cushions got thrown across the lounge room. It was pretty intense,\" she said.\n\"I think they can do it. They've definitely got the crowd support and the home ground advantage is huge.\"\nMs Morris said it was great to see such widespread interest from the Australian public.\n\"I think female sport in general has been a lot more documented as well,\" she said.\n\"The Matildas documentary in the lead-up went really well and the fact it's all televised is nice.\n\"In the past, you wouldn't have even found a female soccer game on TV. It's so good to see that it's actually getting attention.\"\nShe said the Matildas' success had also had an impact on players in her Wangaratta club side.\n\"We've had some girls come back to the club this year due to hype around women's soccer. It's showed that they've probably missed playing and decided to get back into it,\" Ms Morris said.\nMr Kelly has predicted whoever wins out of Australia and England will go on to lift the trophy.\n\"I think they have used Sam Kerr to perfection. They've been running the other teams' defences into the ground with Emily Van Egmond and you have one of the best players in the world coming on fresh against tired legs, especially centre backs who have probably played every minute of every game,\" he said.\n\"Hopefully she pulled up well after the France game.\"\nTo read more stories, download The Border Mail news app in the Apple Store or Google Play.\nOur journalists work hard to provide local, up-to-date news to the community.
