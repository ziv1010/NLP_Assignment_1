Across the road, red scarves and flags hang outside pubs. Inside her mind, visions of Wembley finals and roaring crowds fill her dreams. But it’s a Ghanaian rhythm—calm, confident, pulsing in her veins. She flicks on her headphones, hears a distant drum beat reminiscent of Accra, and steps out. In that moment, the identity of a Merseyside girl and Ghanaian pride live in harmony.\nRoots by the Mersey\nBorn on 8 September 1995 in Liverpool, Chantelle—“Chaney” to those close—grew up kicking balls in Everton’s youth ranks before breaking into the first team in 2013. Raised in a football‑mad city, she cut her teeth in local parks, wearing Everton blue and tuning into WSL matches, dreaming big. Her Ghanaian heritage—a legacy of family stories, and festive gatherings with traditional food and music—was a parallel world. Although she spent most weekends in Merseyside, her father’s and mother's tales of Ghana shaped her identity just as strongly.\nAt Everton, she rose steadily, winning the Spring Series in 2017, earning a full‑time contract, and later playing in the Women’s Super League with both Everton and Aston Villa before moving to London City Lionesses.\nThe transition to London City marked a new chapter: she became one of their standout performers, scoring goals and helping push the club toward promotion ambitions.\nEmbracing the Ghanaian badge\nWhen Chantelle received her first Ghana call‑up in March 2025, she had already represented England at U‑19 and U‑23 levels—but her allegiance was clear.\n“It’s the motherland for me,” she said, describing how wearing the Ghana badge felt like destiny. She made her debut for the Black Queens in a friendly against Senegal in April 2025, quickly netting her first goal in a friendly game against Côte d’Ivoire—an emotional milestone where she announced herself as a scorer for Ghana.\nGhanaian fans and continental breakthrough\nAt the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) in Morocco, Chantelle’s impact was immediate. Facing Tanzania in a must‑win Group C fixture on 15 July 2025, she was voted Woman of the Match after helping orchestrate a 4–1 win that sent Ghana into the quarterfinals for the first time since 2016.\nShe dictated play from midfield, intercepted key challenges, and sealed victory with a stunning curler—her first for the national team at the tournament—celebrating with both travelling Ghanaian supporters and local fans in the stadium alike.\nIn post‑match interviews, Chantelle was equal parts leader and humble team player. “I told them that we are not going to win this game without playing as a team … I am so proud of Ghana, of the fans. I am so proud to be Ghanaian,” she told CAF Online.\nHer versatility—able to perform on the wing or in central midfield—gave coach Kim Björkegren tactical freedom. She embraced that flexibility. “I love playing on the wing, but I love being at the heart of the game even more,\" she reflected.\nIdentity, diaspora and ambition\nChantelle’s narrative carries broader resonance: she is part of a growing wave of women in sport who embody diaspora pride and cultural duality. She sought to shine a new light on Ghanaian women’s football.\n“My first thought was … to make Ghana be spoken about in a very, very good light in women’s football,” she said, eyeing legacy and role‑model status, particularly for young girls in both England and Ghana. Her journey signals the possibility of belonging to two worlds—Liverpool’s working‑class grit and Ghana’s vibrant cultural spirit.\nWomen’s sport itself—especially football—is still pushing for recognition. Chantelle’s emergence helps elevate visibility for the Black Queens and encourages wider African engagement. “I hope I can add a lot more … not just goals, but assists, leadership and encouragement,” she shared in an interview with Joy Sports after earning that Woman of the Match award.\nCultural bridge, continental dreams\nAs the quarterfinals approached, Chantelle’s presence seemed to galvanise Ghana’s campaign. She had become not only a playmaker but a cultural bridge—an Anfield‑born midfielder carrying Ghanaian hope across the pitch. Fans in Ghana chanted her name, but the magic of that has been through her mum.\n\"My mum has always kept me with my roots, even though she's English. She's always made the African peanut butter soup and the fufu, and eating kenkey and Gari,\" she mentioned to 3Sports.\nFinal whistle: reflection\nAs Chantelle continues her international journey—and the Black Queens press on in WAFCON—it’s clear her story transcends sport. She stands at the confluence of migration, culture, and aspiration: rooted in Liverpool’s tradition, yet singing for Ghana on Africa’s biggest stage. She brings tactical intelligence, technical flair, and an inclusive spirit.\nFor her, the only way this tournament becomes a success is for Ghana to claim the ultimate prize on their return to the Kotoka International Airport.\n\"[This tournament will only be successful for me] when we take the trophy. I think we deserve it. I think we deserve the respect from African football,\" she told Joy Sports.\n\"I want to give this continent so much respect, but I also want to gain it. The only way you gain it is by performing, by showing who we are.\n\"So a successful tournament for me is taking home the only thing that you can take home [the trophy].\"\nIn the end, Chantelle Boye‑Hlorkah is more than a footballer: she is a testament to the dualities that enrich modern identity. Raised on the Mersey, embraced on the shores of the African continent; Liverpool‑born, Ghana‑adored—she remains a bridge between communities, reminding us that belonging is not limited by borders, and that football can unite the chapters of our stories.\nLatest Stories\n-\n‘I wanted to be an architect but ended up as a nurse’ – Diana Hamilton reveals\n45 minutes -\nFrom wards to worship: Diana Hamilton reveals how nursing school shaped her destiny\n1 hour -\nMahama demands binding deadlines for African reparations\n2 hours -\nThis is not the time to settle political scores – Bawumia to government\n3 hours -\n5 definitive Valentine’s Day gifts to win your lover’s heart in Ghana\n3 hours -\n37% of SHS students exposed to drugs – Opare-Addo\n3 hours -\nNLC secures court injunction against striking tertiary unions\n4 hours -\nOSP says it remains guided by law after INTERPOL deletes Ofori-Atta’s Red Notice\n4 hours -\nWaiting in the Ring: life inside Bukom’s halted boxing scene\n4 hours -\nRed Notice cancellation: OSP official fires back at Ofori-Atta’s lawyers\n5 hours -\nOfori-Atta saga: Red Notice ends after arrest – OSP official clarifies\n5 hours -\nAAG raises alarm over billboard demolitions, calls for presidential intervention\n6 hours -\nHealth Minister to chair probe into ‘No Bed Syndrome’ death; promises system overhaul\n6 hours -\nPrime Insight to tackle ‘galamsey tax’ debate, cocoa reforms and Ayawaso East fallout this Saturday\n6 hours -\nCocoa crisis, galamsey complicity and election credibility to dominate this Saturday’s Newsfile\n7 hours",
