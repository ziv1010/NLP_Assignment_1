  "body_text": "UTC Renews Contract With Finley Stadium\n(gomocs.com) CHATTANOOGA—The Chattanooga Mocs agreed with the Stadium Corporation to extend their football and soccer stays in Finley Stadium another five years with an option for a sixth. The Stadium Corporation announced the agreement during their Tuesday board meeting.\nIt’s the longest pact between the city’s collegiate teams and its signature facility.\n“Finley Stadium is one of the FCS’ best venues,” Vice Chancellor for Athletics Mark Wharton explained. “I’ve been impressed over the years with how it has not rested on its laurels. The staff continually tries to improve the fan experience for our games just as our own does. The tailgating in the pavilion is festive with a simple walk to the seats on gamedays.\n“We’re very proud our women’s soccer team is able to use a professional facility too. It’s a great all-around stadium that is a perfect home for Chattanooga’s teams.”\nThe past year has seen the Stadium team focused on improvements and renovations to the facility which opened in 1997. A major step forward came in the concessions area as well as an update to the club area.\nThe new Ultra Club seats 150 individuals with up to 250 standing. It has state-of-the-art technology and has already been booked for many events in the coming months.\nExecutive Director Brian Wright noted that thanks to improvements in Finley’s food and beverage department, sales are up 28% over last year with offerings of elevated concessions at events. In addition, rental income is up 10% for the same period. He also spoke of another elevated service to come with an upgrade to the elevators that service the luxury suites and press box.\n“It currently takes 42 seconds to go from the ground floor to the third floor,” Wright noted. “While we love making friends at Finley, it shouldn’t have to be on an extended elevator ride.”\nThanks to the partnership with the City of Chattanooga and Hamilton County, new LED lighting is on the way which will save the stadium about $15,000 per year in energy costs, improve the guest experience and meet national broadcast standards to recruit new major events.\nStadium Corporation Board Chairman Mike Davis summed it up. “Our team has taken an aging asset and applied strong business principles to not only update it but position it for new opportunities. The commitment from UTC serves as a true testament to that work, and we’re grateful to continue to be the home of the Chattanooga Mocs for the foreseeable future.”\nThe Mocs begin the home portion of the 2023 football schedule with the Southern Conference opener against Mercer on Sept. 14. Portland State (Sept. 28), Wofford (Oct. 19), VMI (Homecoming-Oct. 26) and Samford (Nov. 9) also visit. The program looks to host its first FCS Playoff home game since 2016 in November after earning the first road playoff triumph last November at Austin Peay.\nThe soccer team’s home opener is Sunday, August 25, with a visit from Alabama. The following Thursday sees Xavier come to the Scenic City. Both programs are top 25 contenders.",
