  "body_text": "(MENAFN- The Post) MASERU – Ruthless, merciless, heartless, rampant, unstoppable – we are simply running out of words to describe the dominance Lesotho Defence Force Ladies (LDF) have exerted on women's football.\nAnd just when you think their dominance could not get any worse, they take it a step further.\nThe cold and harsh truth is that LDF Ladies have no peers in the Women Super League (WSL) and it will be a long time before anyone will emerge as serious challengers to the champions.\nThat point was again made vividly clear when LDF crushed second-placed Kick4Life 4-0 on Sunday in what was expected to be a tight league encounter between Lesotho's top two sides.\nKick4Life Ladies have tried gamely to challenge LDF in the past and have come closest to putting the brakes on the high-speed the LDF train that leaves destruction wherever it passes.\nTwo years ago, Kick4Life beat LDF 2-1 in the final of the Dare to Dream pre-season championship which was the army side's first-ever loss in a final.\nThe victory was celebrated across the league because it was seen as the humbling LDF needed after being the bullies of the WSL since its inception in 2015.\nLDF Ladies, who were called Likhosatsana in the inaugural WSL season, have won every league title barring one and there were faint hopes Kick4Life would knock LDF off their perch.\nLDF Ladies were still coached by Lehloenya Nkhasi when they lost to Kick4Life in 2020 and little did anyone know that the current head coach Lengana Nkhethoa was watching from the stands, already plotting revenge.\nNot being involved in the match gave him a clear picture of where the girls lost the final and what needed to change. On Sunday, Kick4Life felt Nkhethoa and the champions' wrath.\nLDF were superior in all departments and, knowing physicality of their opponents, Nkhethoa avoided physical confrontation against Kick4Life and preferred to play a passing game.\nNkhethoa, who was a hard-nosed defender for LDF's men's team in his playing days, said LDF Ladies lost the Dare to Dream final in 2020 because they played to Kick4Life's strengths. That was not going to happen again.\n“I realised when Kick4Life beat us that we were playing a similar type of football to them which was pressure football, where you shoot and run,” Nkhethoa said.\n“I implemented a new style. As women we are already physical (on the field of play), so if we play long balls when we play each other we will have many injuries and so we worked on a passing game,” the LDF mentor explained.\nIt worked like a charm on Sunday.\nLDF were 3-0 up by the 20th minute and the outcome was already sealed. Unsurprisingly, there was a slight dip in LDF's performance in the second half which allowed Kick4Life to string passes together and cross the halfway line.\nBut LDF's dullness did not last long.\nNkhethoa and his technical team shouted at the top of their voices to get the players' focus back and LDF grabbed one goal for the road to make it 4-0 at fulltime.\n“We instilled that (passing style) in them and right now they get it, even though they were a bit tired in the second half,” Nkhethoa said.\n“We told them that if you play (Kick4Life's) game they will beat you because they will push you and you will fall, that means more fouls and injuries. We needed to hold the ball and pass it. There is no team that can beat us if we are passing,” he said.\nWhy are LDF so dominant?\nMany often ask that question and Nkhethoa said there is nothing special and no secret to tell.\nIf anything, LDF have frequently shared their recipe for success with other teams, he said. According to Nkhethoa, more focus must be put into the technical development of women footballers rather than their physicality.\n“I was telling (other teams) that I want my team to have competition, I want us to play the same passing football,” Nkhethoa said.\n“Let's go back and teach our players the passing game. As much as we need to train them physically, but let's work with the ball more than anything,” he added.\n“They are women, they need more technique than anything else, so let's work with the ball more than making them run without (the ball). That's the only way we can help our league.”\nThe champions will be back in action this weekend when they take on fourth-placed FC Stoko and their focus has already shifted to claiming another scalp.\nIt is part of the commendable job Nkhethoa has also done of keeping his team hungry despite their success.\nSuccess can make one complacent and Nkhethoa said his technical team continuously work with the players to ensure they stay focused which means being with them even in their private lives and making sure they are surrounded by people who are good influences, not just for their careers but their lives in general.\n“There are those who drink but I try not only to coach them on the field, but even outside in their lives,” Nkhethoa said.\n“I am always with them making sure they are okay and aren't doing anything that would make them regret their careers ending because of their recklessness.”",
