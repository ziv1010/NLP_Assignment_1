  "body_text": "When Jessica Fields called her older brother to tell him her college choice, he hung up immediately.\nFields had picked Michigan. Her brother, Justin, had been a star quarterback at Ohio State.\nThey’d been on a family vacation when she scheduled her official visit to Ann Arbor; Justin bristled at that. So she expected his reaction to the call, though he was half-joking. He called right back, they had a laugh, and the sibling rivalry was on.\nFields will suit up for the Michigan women’s basketball team this season, arriving on campus later this month. She’ll join a freshman class that includes fellow top-100 prospects McKenzie Mathurin and Ciara Byars.\nFields, a 6-foot-1 forward from Georgia ranked No. 97 in the 2025 class by ESPN.\n“Jess is going to bring another level of athleticism to our program,” Michigan head coach Kim Barnes Arico said upon her signing in November. Calling her a “game changer,” she highlighted Fields’ shot blocking, rebounding, and bounce. “Her feel for the game is next-level and her motor is special. She is someone who will make an impact for us on both sides of the floor.”\nWhile Fields’ siblings Justin and Jadyn, a former softball star at Georgia, went to a public school in Kennesaw, the COVID pandemic forced her middle school at the time to go online-only. She transferred to Mount Paran Christian for a year, liked it, and stayed through high school.\nAs a four-year varsity starter, she was a force in the paint. Stephanie Dunn, her coach, complimented Fields’ footwork.\n“I was always the tallest player on my team in elementary school and middle school,” Fields said. “So I just got really, really good at the simple stuff. You learn one move and then you learn a counter to that move, then you keep building off of it.”\nFields can face up in the high post and attack off the dribble with either hand, and her range extends to the 3-point line.\nShe has a motor that doesn’t stop and takes pride in guarding the opposing team’s best player, good attributes for a young player hoping to get playing time on an NCAA Tournament-caliber team.\nMichigan’s interest started with Justine Raterman, who until last season was an assistant at Marquette. When she came to Michigan, she told Barnes Arico about Fields, or at least encouraged Michigan to step up its pursuit. According to Fields, Barnes Arico hadn’t spent much time in Georgia given the unlikelihood of luring talent outside of SEC country.\nFields played for a big-time AAU program, Essence, which raised her profile. Detractors in her area reminded her how far Michigan was. With her siblings now living in New York — Justin will be the Jets’ starting quarterback — location wasn’t a major factor. Neither was climate. “Basketball’s an indoor sport,” she said matter-of-factly.\nHer siblings told her to pick a program with a track record of player development. Michigan, Fields said, “was a perfect fit.” She appreciated how a Michigan coach always seemed to be at her games. On her official visit, she bonded with the current Wolverines.\nMichigan was thin in the frontcourt last year; a couple of transfer portal additions will help there, but Fields could still provide depth right away. She showed no signs of impatience in a phone call last week, already talking about a four-year career that ends with a Michigan degree.\nIt is not lost on her that her brother’s alma mater is Michigan’s archrival. After one season at Georgia, Justin Fields was a Buckeye for two memorable seasons before becoming a first-round pick. In his lone game against Michigan, a blowout win in 2019, he threw for 302 yards and four touchdowns.\n“There’s so many pictures of me in Ohio State gear,” Jessica said. “He could blackmail me if he wanted to. There’s a lot of leverage against me.”\nAfter Michigan beat Ohio State on the football field in November, she texted big bro to gloat. “He still loves me,” she said. “He wants me to do great wherever I am.”\nLatest Michigan basketball news:\n- Bracketology: Early NCAA Tournament projections for Michigan basketball\n- Michigan shakes off slow start, pulls away from Northwestern\n- Michigan basketball subject of new four-part docuseries\n- L.J. Cason comes through when Michigan needed an offensive spark most\n- Michigan basketball storms back to avoid upset at Northwestern",
