  "body_text": "The University of Northern Colorado Board of Trustees on Friday approved employment contracts for its head football and volleyball coaches.\nFirst-year head coach Ed Lamb received a five-year contract, typical for previous coaches, while UNC extended volleyball coach Lyndsey Oates’ contract another year.\n“I am very appreciative of the Board of Trustees and President (Andy) Feinstein for the continued support of UNC Athletics,” UNC Athletic Director Darren Dunn said in a statement. “Coach Lamb and coach Oates are tremendous people who have had great coaching success and believe in building champions for life.”\nThe university hired Lamb in December to replace Ed McCaffrey, who went 6-16 overall and 4-12 in Big Sky play. Though he was hired in December 2019, he officially only coached two seasons due to COVID and his termination.\nLamb’s contract is similar to McCaffrey’s, in which he will receive a base salary and similar success incentives. Lamb’s contract officially runs from July 1, 2023, through Dec. 31, 2027. The university can extend the contract prior to its end date.\nMost notably, Lamb’s base salary starting in 2024 is set at $203,116, though he will only take a $50,000 salary in 2023.\nLamb, however, will receive a retention bonus of $153,0116 in January 2024. That would ultimately equal his base salary.\nThe Greeley Tribune asked if there was a particular reason for Lamb’s $50,000 salary in 2023, notably if it was due to the buyout of McCaffrey’s contract or to ensure a larger assistant salary pool. In response, the athletic department provided a statement:\n“The payment scale of the agreement between UNC and coach Lamb was structured at the request of coach Lamb,” the department said. “The overall base salary is nearly identical to the previous coach over the course of the entire agreement. Neither the coaching change nor the salary pool for the assistant coaches had any impact on the payment terms of coach Lamb’s agreement.”\nUNC allotted more than $675,000 for 12 football staff salaries, providing an average pay of $56,250.\nOver the last three seasons, the average salary for 10 assistant coaches — not other paid staff — was $43,329, according to the university salary reports.\nThe previous highest average salary for assistants was $45,582 in the 2019-20 academic year. That dipped to $43,635 in 2020-21 and then $40,770 in 2021-22.\nLamb’s contract includes a courtesy phone, vehicle when available and country club membership.\nThe Bears have not finished above .500 since the 2015 and 2016 seasons. After failing to turn things around under McCaffrey, the team hopes to finally find lasting success under Lamb. The new coach has publicly shared about his commitment to the program and community, hoping to give Greeley a program it’s wanted to see since transitioning to Division I.\nThe team starts its season at Abilene Christian on Aug. 31 and hosts the home opener against Incarnate Word on Sept. 9.\nOates’ contract will run until June 30, 2028, with UNC having the option to extend it. The university extended her contract in previous years due to her ongoing success.\nHer new contract provides another pay increase, as well, bumping her base salary from $118,033 to $135,000. This ties Oates for the third-highest-paid head coach, alongside women’s basketball coach Kristen Mattio. Lamb and men’s basketball coach Steve Smiley are the only two making more.\nThe longtime coach won her seventh Big Sky title in the fall and made a second-straight NCAA appearance. It was the third league title in four seasons, with the Bears appearing in all four finals matches.\nSince UNC officially joined the Big Sky in 2006, Oates has guided the team to nine league title matches and earned a spot in the conference tournament for 17 consecutive years. Both are conference records.\nSince joining the Big Sky in 2006, Oates has led the Bears to eight league title games and earned a spot in the conference tournament for 16 straight years. Those are both Big Sky records. UNC has been in the title game for the last three straight seasons.\nUnder Oates, junior setter Syd Cole received All-America Honorable Mention in the fall. The team also picked up multiple All-Big Sky regular season and All-Big Sky tournament distinctions.\nThe volleyball salary pool also increased. Last season, Oates received $130,776 to pay her assistants and staff. UNC increased the amount to $160,000.\nBoth coaches expressed appreciation to the university administration and athletic department for their support.\n“We are positioned to win more Big Sky championships and advance in the NCAA tournament. I really want to make that happen at UNC,” Oates said. “I’ve always felt appreciated at UNC, and I think they understand my loyalty and commitment to the Bears, as well.”\nFinancial incentives included in both contracts\nVolleyball\n- $5,000 for a Big Sky Tournament qualification\n- $5,000 for winning outright or sharing the Big Sky regular season title\n- $5,000 for winning the Big Sky Tournament\n- $10,000 for winning the first round of the NCAA Tournament\n- $7,000 for earning an NCAA Academic Performance Rate at or above 960\n- $4,000 for earning a fall GPA at or above 3.20.\n- $4,000 for earning a spring GPA at or above 3.20\nFootball\n- $5,000 for six wins in a regular season\n- $2,500 for each subsequent win\n- $10,000 for winning outright or sharing the Big Sky regular season Conference Championship\n- $10,000 for FCS Playoff appearance\n- $10,000 for winning Big Sky Coach of the Year\n- $25,000 for winning the FCS Championship\n- $5,000 for a 10% increase in average home paid attendance over previous season\n- $5,000 for a 20% increase in average home paid attendance over previous season\n- $7,500 for earning an NCAA Academic Performance Rate at or above 940 in year 1\n- $7,500 for earning an NCAA Academic Performance Rate at or above 950 in subsequent seasons\n- $2,500 for earning a fall GPA at or above 2.85\n- $2,500 for earning a spring GPA at or above 2.85",
