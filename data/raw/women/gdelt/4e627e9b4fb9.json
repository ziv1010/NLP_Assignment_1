But those obstacles were no match for the fire in their bellies.\nBuilt on guts and glory, India's Blue Tigresses have learnt to make more from less.\nToday, they stand shoulder to shoulder with some of the best teams in the region.\nEarning their golden ticket to the AFC Asian Cup — on merit for the first time — has got them, and the nation, dreaming.\n\"What we achieved with very limited resources is quite huge,\" India forward Manisha Kalyan said.\n\"Some players in the team come from conditions where they did not have a proper ground to train on.\n\"They've made their way up from those situations all because of hard work.\"\nVictories over Mongolia, Timor-Leste, Iraq and Thailand in the qualifiers ushered India into the Asian Cup, a 12-team championship set to be played in Australia from March 1 to 21.\nBeyond regional bragging rights, the tournament offers a coveted opportunity: a place at the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil.\nThree years ago, India's run at the Asian Cup on home soil ended in heartbreak when a COVID-19 outbreak forced the hosts to withdraw during the group stage.\nNow, with renewed hope, the players are hungrier than ever.\nWith limited international exposure, a short domestic league, and scarce resources, this team has proven its success comes despite the system, not because of it.\nWomen's football lacks funding, investment in India\nDespite outperforming the men on the global stage, India's women's team continues to operate with far fewer opportunities, resources, and investment.\n\"We have to fight for basic necessities sometimes,\" Kalyan said.\n\"We use GPS-tracking devices, but it's not all the time. The training equipment could be better, too.\n\"I feel we are still in the stage of learning things in this aspect, and I hope it improves.\"\nDisha Malhotra Julka, former assistant coach of India's under-17 women's team, calls the resourcing problem a \"chicken and egg situation\".\n\"Will the investors come first, or will the team win first?\" she asked.\n\"Investors probably feel the team needs to improve before they invest.\n\"Players and coaches also want the game to grow, but how will it, if the money doesn't come in?\"\nThe lack of support isn't limited to the federation or infrastructure alone.\nFans and the media also need to get behind their team, Kalyan argues.\n\"I don't think our team, or women's football, in general, received enough attention for our achievement despite the limited resources,\" the 23-year-old said.\n\"I was disappointed by that.\n\"Maybe in India, people don't watch football that much, and even less so when it comes to women's football. But I want to say: watch us, we're doing something good too.\"\nIndia 'realistic' chance of qualifying for World Cup\nA tough challenge awaits India at the Women's Asian Cup.\nDrawn in a difficult Group C, the team face Japan, Vietnam and Chinese Taipei — all ranked higher than India at 63, and boasting World Cup experience.\nBut head coach Crispin Chettri believes FIFA rankings overestimate the gap between teams, arguing India has a \"very realistic\" chance of reaching the quarterfinals, and with it, a shot at its first-ever World Cup qualification.\n\"I am sure we will qualify for the World Cup, and doing that will change the landscape of Indian football at large,\" Chettri said.\n\"If we do well at the Asian Cup and make it to Brazil for the World Cup, [the achievement] would have the same effect as the 1983 men's cricket World Cup.\"\nIn 1983, India won its first-ever world cricket title, immortalising Kapil Dev's team and igniting a passion for the sport that swept across the nation.\nWomen footballers outperforming Indian men\nIndia's Asian Cup qualification and World Cup ambition come at a time when the men's game is mired in uncertainty.\nIndia's top-flight league, the Indian Super League, has been put on hold as the All India Football Federation (AIFF) struggles to sell the league's commercial rights.\nThe AIFF has cited stalled negotiations for a contract renewal with its commercial partners as the reason for postponing the league.\nThe postponement has, in turn, forced some clubs to suspend teams or withhold player salaries.\nTo make matters worse, the men's team failed to qualify for the 24-team AFC Asian Cup in 2027.\nThe women's team's progress offers fans a reason for optimism.\n\"Men's and women's football are completely different and can't be compared, but I see more commitment in women players,\" Chettri said.\n\"When I hear people say that the men's team is not doing well because of the lack of a league, I think that's an excuse.\n\"Did women's football in India ever have a proper league? No. But they are still performing their best because sometimes playing for the badge is more important.\"\nIndeed, the women's league in India lacks the depth and structure that leagues abroad do.\nThe 2024-25 Indian Women's League (IWL) featured eight teams and ran for three months.\nBy comparison, Australia's A-League women's competition has 11 teams and the regular season runs for five months.\n\"If we have a longer competition, our girls will improve, and this will directly impact the national team because the leagues are where the talent is spotted,\" Malhotra Julka, who runs an academy called Foot and Ball, said.\n\"There's only so much high-pressure simulation you can do in training, but it's real match experience that truly counts.\"\nIndian Women's League expansion, more game time needed\nLooking forward, head coach Chettri believes expanding the IWL to a 12-team league will benefit the future of the women's game, offering more players the chance to be called up to the national side.\nKalyan agrees, arguing that more game time will boost the players' confidence.\nShe relocated to Greece to pursue her footballing career and has represented PAOK FC and Apollon Ladies of Cyprus.\n\"Indian players play a maximum of 30 matches [for club and country] in a year, while those in Europe play a match every week against tough opponents,\" she said.\n\"That teaches them to handle pressure well.\n\"The hunger of Indian players needs to be channelled in the right way.\"\nWith the Asian Cup quickly approaching, coach Chettri is focusing on building a core group of 30 players, including youngsters.\nRecent friendly defeats to Nepal and Iran may have upset some fans, but the coach says he has a long-term view.\n\"I have to try a few youngsters as backups for the tournament,\" he explained.\n\"We need to have a core group and a supply line. Hence, it's essential to give younger players exposure at the highest level, as I did recently.\n\"The next two months will be challenging for fans because we might lose some games. But it's part of the process to qualify for the World Cup.\n\"Just bear with me, and I will definitely deliver the results in March.\"\nManasi Pathak is a freelance sports journalist whose reporting has taken her to major global events, including the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
