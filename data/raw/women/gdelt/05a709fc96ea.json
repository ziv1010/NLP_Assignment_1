  "body_text": "The Prince of Wales' message comes after his wife announced on March 22 that she had been diagnosed with cancer.\nPrince William has posted his first message since his wife, Kate Middleton, announced her cancer diagnosis.\nThe Prince of Wales took to Instagram on Wednesday to thank soccer star Rachel Daly following an incredible career in international soccer. Earlier in the day, Daly shockingly announced she would retire from international competition and in response, William, who is President-Designate of the Football Association, reposted Daly's message along with a few sweet words dedicated to the athlete.\n\"Thank you for so many unforgettable performances with @lionesses, @racheldaly3,\" William wrote. \"Plenty more goals for Villa now! W.\"\nVilla, William's favorite soccer team, is in reference to Daly's current team, Aston Villa F.C. of the elite Premiere League. Daly, 32, was a versatile star who played numerous positions for England's national team. Daly led England to the Euro Cup championship in 2022 as well as a finals appearance against Spain in last year's Women's World Cup. Spain won, 1-0.\nThe tribute to Daly marks William's first post since the Princess of Wales announced on March 22 that she had been diagnosed with cancer. While she did not disclose the type of cancer, Kate shared that she had been undergoing \"preventative chemotherapy\" and was \"in the early stages of that treatment.\"\nRoyal expert Katie Nicholl spoke to ET in London last month after news of the princess' health broke, and shared that Kate is leaning on her parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, during this difficult time.\n\"She has a really tight group of friends and, particularly in Norfolk, really close friends there. But I think the real anchors in her life are her parents,\" Nicholl said, adding, \"and her brother, James... and her sister, Pippa.\"\n\"While you certainly don't see them photographed together very often, they are very much there in the background,\" she added. \"They are absolutely fundamental.\"\nAfter Kate's diagnosis was revealed, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson shared that King Charles III, who himself is dealing with his own cancer diagnosis, is \"so proud of Catherine for her courage in speaking as she did.\"\nFollowing their time in the hospital together, Charles has \"remained in the closest contact with his beloved daughter-in-law throughout the past weeks,\" and both royals \"will continue to offer their love and support to the whole family through this difficult time.\"\nRELATED CONTENT:",
