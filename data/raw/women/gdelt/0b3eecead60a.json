  "body_text": "Airtel, TNM opt out of FAM Awards\nFootball Association of Malawi (FAM) has harmonised football awards for all competitions, but major stakeholders, notably Super League sponsors TNM plc and thier Top 8 counterparts Airtel Malawi Limited are not part of the initiative.\nThe inaugural harmonised awards, to be held on February 21 2025 at Sunbird Mount Soche in Blantyre, will award outstanding players, coaches, referees in both men’s and women’s in all competitions held in the 2024 season.\nFAM will also recognise exceptional performance in both men’s and women’s national teams.\nCastel Challenge Cup sponsors Castel Malawi Limited and FDH Bank plc who sponsor FDH Cup are part of the initiative.\nFAM competitions and communications director Gomezgani Zakazaka in an interview on Thursday confirmed that the mobile network service operators will hold separate awards for Airtel Top 8 and TNM Super League.\nHe said: “Our wish is to have one football awards event. We lobbied all stakeholders to come on board. FDH Bank and Castel Malawi Limited agreed to do so. However, in the inaugural event we will not have TNM and Airtel. This is not possible due to some contractual issues.\n“TNM and Airtel will hold their separate awards as under their contractual agreements with FAM. But it’s a process and we are hopeful that in future, we will all have one FAM Football Awards as a family.”\nOn his part, Castel Malawi head of corporate marketing and communications Lavern Chitakata said their coming on board highlights a commitment to supporting football development.\nShe said: “Castel Malawi sees these awards as an investment in Malawian football to help in talent development, professionalism, and competitiveness.”\nFDH Financial Holdings Limited senior marketing manager Ronald Chimchere said this emphasizes their dedication to ensuring the success of the awards.\n“As FDH Bank Cup sponsor, our goal is to see the inaugural sports awards succeed and we will work with FAM to ensure the athletes are celebrated in the right way.\n“The awards will be bigger and better with combined effort. This will provide a massive platform to celebrate the deserving ,” he said.\nTNM brands and communication manager Limbani Nsapato confirmed they will hold their usual TNM Super League awards, but refused to comment on why they are not part of the harmonised event organised by FAM.\nOn her part, Airtel Malawi head of brand communications Norah Chavula Chirwa asked for a questionnaire which she had not responded to at press time.\nFootball analyst Patrick Zgambo said it is difficult to have an event involving the two rival mobile service providers.\nHe said: “Sponsors are territorial and don’t like being in the same room with a competitor. They want to have the full stage or they opt out. They are justified.”\nBut another analyst Charles Nyirenda felt both can enjoy more brand visibility in a joint event.\nHe said: “Actually, a harmonised football awards brings more visibility than a separate event.\n“FAM’s initiative is a move toward international standards and all sponsors ought to embrace it.”",
