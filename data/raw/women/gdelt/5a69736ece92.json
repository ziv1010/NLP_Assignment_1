The big picture: Yelp searches for Chinese restaurants spike every December. Last year, Christmas Day searches were 99% higher than any other day in the month, the platform told Axios. It's not just Yelp. Google search interest for \"Chinese food\" has peaked on Christmas every year since the data became available (in 2004). Zoom in: A lack of restaurants open on Christmas has fueled the trend over the years, and the cuisine is a holiday favorite among many Jewish families. Rabbi... -\nThree simple fixes would radically improve the ‘border’ situation—but Democrats don’t care\nWe don’t have a border. The media constantly tell the public that the illegal immigration problem is a complex issue that’s extremely hard to solve, but that is not true. The border was significantly more controlled under President Trump, before Joe Biden reversed his successful policies. There are three main things that would greatly reduce the problem: 1) Enforce existing laws. 2) Make people who seek asylum remain in Mexico. If we did that, Mexico would suddenly enforce their southern border, instead of allowing illegals from all over the world to stroll into the U.S. The nation couldn’t afford to... -\nPoll: Donald Trump Leads Joe Biden Among Independents\nFormer President Donald Trump is leading President Joe Biden among independents, the latest survey from the Economist/YouGov found. The survey asked respondents who they would support in a 2024 presidential matchup between Trump and Biden. Overall, the two are tied with 43 percent support each, even among registered voters. However, Trump takes the edge among independents, leading his likely 2024 opponent by six points, or 38 percent to Biden’s 32 percent. Six percent of independents remain unsure. As is consistent with a previous survey, more independents, 38 percent to Biden’s 26 percent, believe Trump is more likely to win the... -\nDeeper look: CEFC, the Chinese energy firm at the center of the Biden impeachment inquiry\nLesser known than Burisma, the now-defunct company was once a Global Fortune 500 energy and finance conglomerate energy conglomerate with Chinese Communist Party connections, and a long history of helping to implement China's plans to become a dominant economic superpower. They are now at the center of the Biden impeachment inquiry. Who were they? Hunter Biden’s extensive financial dealings with the now-defunct Chinese energy conglomerate CEFC China Energy (CEFC) have become one of the central focuses of the House Republicans’ impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. According to House investigators, one area of concern is the bank transfers he received... -\nWhich 2028 Presidential Wannabe Had the Best Year?\nDonald Trump’s road to victory in the 2016 presidential election began in March 2011, when he first publicly questioned the origin of Barack Obama’s birth. He soon became the leading voice of the racist “birther” conspiracy theory, forging an unbreakable bond with a large portion of the Republican base that would later propel him to the presidency. Then-Illinois state Senator Barack Obama may not have known it at the time, but his 2002 speech at a Chicago rally opposing an invasion of Iraq set his course to the presidency. Six years later, Obama won his party’s nomination over more experienced... -\nTaylor Swift compared to Yoko Ono as Chiefs lose again amid Travis Kelce romance\nA whole locker room of men to choose from yet they still blame the woman in the bleachers. The Kansas City Chiefs are facing criticism after losing five of their last eight games, yet instead of focusing on the players on the field, several NFL fans — and even commentators — have shifted their focus to Travis Kelce’s girlfriend Taylor Swift. Following the team’s tough loss to the Las Vegas Raiders on Monday, many angry fans took to Twitter to voice their frustration, comparing the 12-time Grammy winner to Yoko Ono, who was famously blamed for breaking up the Beatles... -\nFederal Judge Sides With Osage Nation, Orders Removal Of 84 Wind Turbines\nThe Osage Nation won a massive ruling in Tulsa federal court on Wednesday that requires Enel to dismantle a 150-megawatt wind project it built in Osage County despite the tribe’s repeated objections. The tribe’s fight against Rome-based Enel began in 2011 and is the longest-running legal battle over wind energy in American history. As reported by Curtis Killman in the Tulsa World on Thursday, the ruling grants the United States, the Osage Nation, and Osage Minerals Council permanent injunctive relief via “ejectment of the wind turbine farm for continuing trespass.” The decision by U.S. Court of International Trade Judge Jennifer... -\nWhy scientists are making transparent wood\nStronger than plastic and tougher than glass, the resin-filled material is being exploited for smartphone screens, insulated windows, and more. CREDIT: WILEY‐VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO. KGAA, WEINHEIM / CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 Thirty years ago, a botanist in Germany had a simple wish: to see the inner workings of woody plants without dissecting them. By bleaching away the pigments in plant cells, Siegfried Fink managed to create transparent wood, and he published his technique in a niche wood technology journal. The 1992 paper remained the last word on see-through wood for more than a decade, until a researcher named Lars... -\nDingell: Trump Is Contributing to Division, ‘Violence Is Becoming Normalized’\nRepresentative Debbie Dingell (D-MI) said Tuesday on CNN’s “News Central” that former President Donald Trump’s Christmas message shows how he is contributing to division in the county to the point that “violence is becoming normalized.” Anchor Sara Sidner said, “I want to ask you about some new information we’ve just been saying the FBI is now involved because of threats to those Colorado judges who ruled that Donald Trump cannot be on the ballot. I’d like to get your thoughts because I know in your state several of your state leadership has faced threats. And you yourself, I think, have... -\nHoney Badger fights off 3 leopards!

Roughly 1 million fewer young men are in college compared to 0.2 million fewer young women in the past decade, Pew senior researcher Richard Fry wrote, citing new data from the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to 18-to-24-year-olds’ college enrollment data. “As a result, men make up 44 percent of young college students today, down from 47 percent in 2011…” he wrote. “This shift is driven entirely by... -\nFlorida State University initiates legal challenge against Atlantic Coast Conference\nFlorida State University (FSU) filed a lawsuit against the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) on Friday, alleging mismanagement of media rights and imposing excessive exit fees.The lawsuit specifically challenges the ACC’s Grant of Rights provision and associated exit penalties, which total more than $500 million.FSU posits that these conditions, which also require forfeiture of media rights through 2036 for leaving the conference, are restrictive and potentially breach contractual obligations.The university’s decision to pursue legal action follows its exclusion from the College Football Playoffs despite an undefeated season.FSU additionally raises objections to the ACC’s strategy of expanding its membership by adding The... -\nIncredible Video Shows Israel Completely Annihilating Hamas Weapons Smuggler With Gargantuan Airstrike\nIsrael ain’t playing no games! Hassan Atrash, who is a weapons smuggler for Hamas, was absolutely blown to smithereens in a gargantuan airstrike that was operated by Israel, according to the New York post, which cites the Israel Defense Forces. Taking place in the Gaza city of Rafah, an Israeli fighter jet completely annihilated the terrorist, according to a Sunday announcement from the IDF, according to the New York Post. The fatal (and glorious) strike happened Friday. The incredible footage shows a camera tracking Atrash from the sky prior to a fighter jet coming in and rocking the scumbag. Israel‘s... -\nBeavers invade Arizona neighborhoods\nDec. 26 (UPI) -- Residents in the Phoenix area have noticed an increase in sightings of some unusual guests in their neighborhoods: beavers. The Southwest Wildlife Conservation Center in Scottsdale said the most recent beaver sighting was reported in the Arcadia neighborhood of Phoenix, and rescuers arrived to find the animal gnawing on a tree. \"It had almost gnawed through half of that tree by the time I got there,\" Kim Carr, animal care manager at the conservation center, told the Arizona Republic. \"It was completely unfazed by the crowd that was forming around it.\" The rescue group said the... -\nMuslim girl (backed by family) tells Rabbi Shmuley 'go kill yourself' in Times Square (Frankenstein -Palestine riots)\nA Muslim girl who claimed to be eleven-years-old told American Orthodox Rabbi Shmuley Boteach to \"kill himself\" in a video that has gone viral on social media. The incident occurred on Christmas Eve in Times Square in New York City, as anti-Israel activists attempted to 'cancel Christmas' in midtown. The girl approached Rabbi Boteach and told him that if he had a problem with 'Free Palestine,' \"go kill yourself.\" The girl's mother supported her daughter's antisemitism when Rabbi Boteach said that he would report the incident to the police, and the girl declared that she was \"not sorry\" for calling... -\nLindsey Graham Points to Hillary Clinton Feeling ‘She Was Cheated’ to Defend Trump’s 2020 Election Denials | Video\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham spent his Christmas Eve defending Donald Trump’s continued claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Speaking with Pierre Thomas on ABC’s “This Week” Sunday, Graham was asked if Trump’s election denial is the best standard to set for future generations. The senator replied, “Well, you know, Hillary Clinton had the same view that she was cheated.” “He’s not the first politician to claim to have been denied a fair election,” Graham added. “I accept the election results of 2020,” he continued. “I’m worried about 2024. If President Trump puts a vision out improving security... -\nDo You Still Have CHRIST, The Day After CHRISTmas?\nBeloved, sadly the day after Christmas is probably one of the worst days of the year for many people. It's back to the reality of this crazy life, the grind of it and the uncertainties that follow. The question to all on the day after Christmas is; Do you still have a BIBLICAL CHRIST; the day after CHRISTmas? The horrific tragedy is that many do not and will go back serving a Jesus made in their own image (Matt. 7:21-23). As believers in Jesus, that should not be the case for us since we have a wonderful ETERNAL relationship with... -\nNew Mexico Sheriff Investigating Whether Gun Control Group’s Firearm Dismantling Event Broke Law\nA New Mexico sheriff is investigating a group of gun control advocates over concerns that their efforts to buy back and destroy firearms were unlawful. San Juan County Sheriff Shane Ferrari announced in a Dec. 17 Facebook post that his office would investigate the group New Mexicans to Prevent Gun Violence (NMPGV) over a recent gun buyback event. The sheriff said the buyback event may have violated a state gun control law that prohibits firearms transfers without a background check. NMPGV initially planned a gun buyback event with the city of Farmington in the Farmington Police Department parking lot on... -\nA Lesson In How Anti-Gunners Ignore Inconvenient Facts\nGun control advocates like to pretend that the facts are on their side. Of course, we also know that the research they like to push has…let’s just say it has problems. The truth of the matter is that there is a tendency among the anti-Second Amendment types to simply ignore anything inconvenient. When the polls say that the public no longer supports infringements on our right to keep and bear arms, they simply cite older polls that tell them what they wanted to hear in the first place, just to name one example. But I came across another example. It...\nBrowse by Forum\nGet Connected! Join Free Republic Today!\nAlready a Member?
