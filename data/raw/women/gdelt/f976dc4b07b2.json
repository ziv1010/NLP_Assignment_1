I’ll [perform a sex act] on u that’s not cheating”.\nThe latest claim is understood to predate the ex-England player’s success with The One Show by several years. Married dad-of-four and Match of the Day pundit Jenas, 41, was sacked by the BBC in August for sending “inappropriate messages” to two female colleagues.\nHe has since faced similar allegations from other women. Last week it was claimed he bombarded a woman working at the World Cup in Qatar two years ago with unwanted messages asking ‘You want my boy now?’.\nThe latest accuser says she had just started shifts for BT Sport when he was a rising star as a football pundit. A spokesman for Jenas said: “Jermaine denies that these messages were unsolicited and it is disappointing that it has taken seven years for these accusations to come to light. Jermaine has already apologised for his past actions and is currently taking time to focus on his family.”\nJenas was abruptly sacked in August by the BBC - where he also worked on flagship show Match of the Day - for sending \"inappropriate messages\" to two female colleagues, something he later admitted left him feeling ashamed.\nThe star has since said that he has a “self-destructive streak” with his relationships and is receiving therapy.\nUpon his sacking from the BBC, Jenas told his former female colleagues he was “genuinely sorry” for sending inappropriate messages, issuing an apology after being told not to contact the two women due to a “legal process”.\nBut again he insisted the messages were “between two consenting adults” and that his behaviour was not illegal.\nJenas has said that he had to have conversations with his children after being sacked while he was on a family holiday to Marbella.\nHe has hit out at the corporation for his dismissal, saying: “The handling of the situation wasn't great. It was quick — and hell. I don't think there was a game plan for when they were going to announce they'd fired me. I think different departments were being told different things. I think it's shocking.”",
