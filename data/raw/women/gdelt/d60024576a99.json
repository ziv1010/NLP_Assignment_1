Besides, bilateral cooperation in politics-diplomacy, security-defence will also expand within the newly-established comprehensive strategic partnership, he said.\nMeanwhile, collaboration in traditional areas such as education-training, labour and tourism will continue to be strengthened. Australia has provided a large number of scholarships to Vietnamese students and officials, he noted, advising Vietnam to strengthen partnership with Australia in this field to enhance its human resources quality.\nDr. Bich asserted that other areas included in the joint statement announcing the Vietnam-Australia comprehensive strategic partnership such as economic cooperation, knowledge building and people-to-people connection, especially human resources training, energy and technology collaboration, are areas of Australia’s strength and Vietnam’s interest. In her opinion, cooperation with Australia will significantly contribute to Vietnam's economic development, clean energy transition and digital economy expansion.\nDr. Hiep said that the elevation of ties between Vietnam and Australia will also create favourable conditions for the growth of the ASEAN-Australia ties in the time to come. Vietnam and Australia should increase exchange and coordination to effectively resolve regional issues of mutual concern in ASEAN-led forums, including the East Sea issue and matters related to the Mekong River, supply chains, climate change response, and non-traditional security issues such as maritime security and epidemics.\nSharing Dr. Hiep’s opinions, Dr. Bich said that Vietnam has played a rising role in ASEAN.

The area will have the same policies, rules and standards, and apply the highest preferential mechanisms and policies.\nTo prepare for the project, Quang Tri is mobilising and attracting investment to develop transport infrastructure connecting the delta area to Lao Bao International Border Gate, including the 56-km Cam Lo – Lao Bao expressway whose investment is estimated at nearly 14 trillion VND (568 million USD).\nIn the future, the province will also consider building the Dong Ha - Lao Bao railway to be linked with the Densavan - Savannakhet railway of Laos, thereby forming a railway on the East West Economic Corridor (EWEC).\nTo complete the project, in mid-March, Quang Tri and Savannakhet provinces will jointly organise an international conference at the Lao Bao - Densavan International Border Gate to conduct field surveys with the participation of scientists, managers, leaders of ministries and sectors of the two countries, added Dong./.\nTra Vinh cooperates with Korean partners in various areas\nDepartments and Tra Vinh University in the Mekong Delta province of Tra Vinh signed cooperation agreements with partners from the Republic of Korea (RoK) in various fields on March 11.\nAt the signing ceremony held by the provincial People’s Committee, the Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology (KICT), the province’s Department of Information and Communications, and Tra Vinh University signed a 5-year cooperation agreement on smart urban area development and smart transportation systems.
