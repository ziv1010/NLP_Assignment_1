  "body_text": "LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) — Kansas football coach Lance Leipold signed an amended contract that increased his overall compensation to more than $40 million through the 2029 season. The contract does not extend the previous deal, but it does feature a substantial bump in salary from the $5 million Leipold made last season, when he led the Jayhawks to a 9-4 record and a victory in the Guaranteed Rate Bowl. Leipold was linked to several openings this offseason, including Washington, but ultimately decided to stay at Kansas, where school officials have begun to invest heavily in the Jayhawks’ football program. That includes a new football stadium under construction.\nUNDATED (AP) — Recent incidents in college basketball have underscored the potential dangers that come from jubilant fans storming the court after the game comes to an end. Finding a solution is proving to be a challenge. Duke center Kyle Filipowski and Iowa star Caitlin Clark both got caught in scary incidents recently. The incidents have prompted a renewed scrutiny on protecting visiting teams. Duke coach Jon Scheyer has called on immediate measures by the Atlantic Coast Conference to prevent court storming. Stopping such often-impromptu celebrations is easier said than done, especially with most student sections so close to the court.\nUNDATED (AP) — College Football Playoff officials are considering a 14-team model that would guarantee multiple automatic bids for each of the four power conferences, starting in 2026. Two people with direct knowledge of the discussions told The Associated Press the format being discussed would guarantee three playoff spots each for the Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, two for the Atlantic Coast Conference and Big 12 and one for the highest-ranked team from the Group of Five leagues. The two people spoke on condition of anonymity the CFP management committee's talks were not being made public.\nMANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) — Addy Brown scored 24 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and Iowa State held off No. 15 Kansas State in the fourth quarter for an 82-76 win to tighten the Big 12 Conference standings with one game left. Brown, a freshman from Derby, Kansas, had 11 points in the fourth quarter, including three free throws in the last minute, and finished 9 of 13 from the field to help the Cyclones become the first team this season to shoot 50% against the Wildcats. Freshman Audi Crooks had 14 points and seven rebounds for Iowa State. Ayoka Lee had 20 points and eight rebounds for Kansas State, which had its 17-game home winning streak snapped. The Wildcats allow just 56.3 points a game, on 35% shooting, 25.8% from 3-point range. The Cyclone made 5 of 15 behind the arc and 33 of 66 overall.\nAMES, Iowa (AP) — Demarion Watson hit all seven of his field goal attempts for 15 points and also had nine rebounds to lead No. 8 Iowa State to a 58-45 win over Oklahoma. Curtis Jones added 11 points as the Cyclones won their 17th straight home game and for the sixth time in their last seven games. Rivaldo Soares had nine points to lead the Sooners, who have now lost three of their last four. It was the last scheduled meeting between the teams as Oklahoma heads to the SEC next year.\nSTILLWATER, Okla. (AP) — Darius Johnson scored 17 points, Jaylin Sellers scored 10 of his 12 points in the second half, and UCF beat Oklahoma State 77-71 for its second Big 12 road win in eight attempts this season. UCF (15-12, 6-9), coming off a 75-61 win over No. 23 Texas Tech on Saturday, won back-to-back conference games for the first time this season. Johnson sank a jumper early in the second half to give UCF its first lead of the game at 43-42. Ibrahima Diallo added a dunk on UCF’s next possession for a 7-0 start to the second half. Oklahoma State guard Quion Williams had a layup attempt roll off and C.J. Walker grabbed the defensive rebound before making 1 of 2 free throws with 35.8 seconds left for a 71-67 lead.\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Caitlin Clark has another career record on her astounding resume: the most points by any major college women’s player to ever take the court. Iowa’s superstar guard scored 33 points to lead the sixth-ranked Hawkeyes in a romp at Minnesota and move one point past Lynette Woodard on the all-time list with 3,650 points. Clark buried her eighth 3-pointer of the game with 4:17 left to pass Woodard. She also set the NCAA single-season record for 3-pointers in the process to reach 156 in 2023-24.\nTOKYO (AP) — Baseball star Shohei Ohtani has announced on social media he is married. He's written on Instagram in Japanese, “The season is approaching but I would like to announce to everyone that I have gotten married.” He says his new wife is a “Japanese woman” without identifying her. He says he will reveal more in an interview on Friday. He's asked media to refrain from “conducting unauthorized interviews.” The two-way star joined the Los Angeles Dodgers in December on a $700 million, 10-year contract. The 29-year-old Ohtani is Japan’s biggest celebrity, and there has always been curiosity around his personal life, which he has always kept very private. His focus, and his image, has always been 100%-baseball focused — free of scandals or tabloid news.\nWEDNESDAY SCORES\nTOP-25 COLLEGE BASKETBALL\nFinal (4)Tennessee 92 (11)Auburn 84\nFinal (5)Marquette 91 Providence 69\nFinal (6)Arizona 85 Arizona St. 67\nFinal (8)Iowa St. 58 Oklahoma 45\nFinal (10)Duke 84 Louisville 59\nFinal (12)Creighton 85 Seton Hall 64\nFinal (13)Illinois 105 Minnesota 97\nFinal (14)Alabama 103 Mississippi 88\nFinal (18)South Carolina 70 Texas A&M 68\nFinal (24)Florida 83 Missouri 74\nNATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION\nFinal Dallas 136 Toronto 125\nFinal Indiana 123 New Orleans 114\nFinal Minnesota 110 Memphis 101\nFinal 2OT Chicago 132 Cleveland 123\nFinal Denver 117 Sacramento 96\nFinal L.A.
