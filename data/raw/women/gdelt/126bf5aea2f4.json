  "body_text": "Opening the general debate of the eightieth session of the General Assembly, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres urged leaders to choose between “a world of raw power — or a world of laws”.\nHe warned the Organization’s 193 Member States that the planet has “entered an age of reckless disruption and relentless human suffering”, recalling that the UN’s creation eight decades ago was a conscious choice of cooperation over chaos, law over lawlessness, peace over conflict.\nAgainst this backdrop, Presidents and Prime Ministers on the first day of the high-level week diverged on key issues ranging from the role of the UN in a conflict-ridden world to migration, energy, climate change and the future of multilateralism.\nOn the matter of peace and security, Mr. Guterres pointed to Sudan, where civilians are “slaughtered, starved and silenced”, calling for an end to external support fuelling the war. On Ukraine, he praised recent diplomatic efforts and urged “a full ceasefire and a just, lasting peace”.\nOn Gaza, he condemned Hamas’ 7 October 2023 attacks and hostage-taking, but emphasized that “nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people and the systematic destruction of Gaza”. He demanded full implementation of International Court of Justice measures, a permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages, humanitarian access and renewed commitment to the two-State solution as “the only viable answer to sustainable Middle East peace”.\nTech Governance, Climate Action and Conflict Resolution: ‘Tests of Multilateral Will’\nTurning to the climate, he said: “We need stepped-up action and ambition especially through strengthened national climate plans”. He also called on the Group of 20(G20) to lead and urged a road map to mobilize $1.3 trillion annually for developing countries by 2035.\nTechnology, he continued, presents both promise and peril. “Technology must be our servant not our master,” he declared, welcoming the Assembly’s decision to create an Independent International Scientific Panel on Artificial Intelligence. Warning against unregulated artificial intelligence (AI), he urged leaders to see technological governance, climate action and conflict resolution as interconnected tests of multilateral will.\nMr. Guterres also spotlighted global spending priorities, noting the “indefensible” reality that “for every dollar invested to build peace, the world spends $750 on weapons of war”. He called on Member States to “choose to invest in a United Nations that adapts, innovates and is empowered to deliver for people everywhere”, framing this session as a pivotal moment to equip the UN to deliver peace, development, and human rights.\nCynics Must Not Be Allowed to Weaponize Failures\nAnnalena Baerbock (Germany), President of the General Assembly, reinforced this message, declaring, “this is not an ordinary year”. She urged the UN to “do better and not let cynics weaponize these failures” by claiming the institution is outdated or irrelevant. The problem, she argued, is not the Charter but political will: “It is not the Charter which fails, nor the UN as an institution. The Charter is only as strong as Member States’ willingness to uphold it.”\nShe reminded delegates that, without the UN, the world would be far worse off, citing the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) education of 26 million children and the World Food Programme’s (WFP) assistance to nearly 125 million people.\nStressing that “in this globalized, digitalized world, we work together — or we suffer alone”, she introduced the theme of the session: “Better Together: 80 Years and More for Peace, Development and Human Rights”. Living up to that vision requires renovation of the house of diplomacy itself.\n“Even the house of dialogue and diplomacy needs a renovation,” she said, pressing for UN80 reforms, a fit-for-purpose institution and accelerated progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Highlighting the upcoming selection of the next Secretary-General, she noted that “there has never been a woman chosen”, calling this not only a matter of representation but of the UN’s credibility.\nAmid Calls for Reform, Contrasting Perspectives on UN Impact\nThe Assembly then heard from an array of world leaders, including United States President Donald J. Trump, who delivered sharp criticism of the UN, but commended himself for ending several conflicts. “In the period of seven months, I ended seven un-endable — they said they were un-endable — wars,” he said. He criticized the United Nations for offering little help: “What is the purpose of the United Nations,” he asked the 193-member Assembly. The UN seems to write very strongly worded letters, but “empty words don’t solve war”, he said.\nHe strayed away from the UN stance on a number of key issues, calling green energy policies a “scam”, and dismissing the carbon footprint as “a hoax”, as well as accusing the UN of spending “$372 million in cash to support 624,000 migrants to journey into the United States to infiltrate our southern border”. “The UN is supposed to stop invasions, not promote them,” he said.\nOther Presidents offered contrasting perspectives, citing the UN’s impact in their countries. The Republic of Korea’s leader, Lee Jae Myung, hailed the United Nations for its central role in his country’s modern history, declaring: “If someone asks what the UN has achieved, I would confidently reply: ‘Look at the 80-year history of the Republic of Korea.’”\nPortugal’s President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa stressed that “not G1, not G2, not G3, not G1 plus one or two” can replace the universal system of the UN”, pointing to Ukraine and the Middle East as crises where reliance on a few powerful States had failed to secure ceasefires. “We waited and waited for the intervention of the most powerful in the world,” he said, asking: “Did you have a ceasefire?” President of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula Da Silva linked the “multilateralism crisis” to the “weakening of democracy”, warning of anti-democratic forces “trying to subjugate institutions and stifle freedoms”.\nGaza Crisis Marks ‘Lowest Point’ of Humanity, Demands Resolution\nMany leaders addressed the “catastrophic situation” in Gaza. Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto highlighted its role as a major peacekeeping contributor and pledged to continue supporting UN missions. He pointed to record rice production and exports to countries in need, including Palestine. “With a strong UN, we can build a world where the weak do not suffer what they must, but live the justice they deserve,” he said.\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Türkiye condemned the violence as “genocide” ongoing “for over 700 days”, noting that more than 65,000 people had been killed, including 20,000 children, and stressing that “for the last 23 months, a child has been murdered by Israel in Gaza every hour”. He described collapsed healthcare, starvation, and children undergoing amputations without anaesthesia as “the lowest point of humanity”, warning that silence makes others “accomplice to this barbarity”.\nJordan’s King Abdullah II bin al Hussein said that Israelis have not been able to live in security because military action cannot bring them safety. No where is that more evident than in Gaza. Voicing concern for the Israeli Government’s provocative calls for a “Greater Israel”, he stressed that such plans can only be achieved through violating the territorial integrity of the country’s neighbours. “The international community must stop entertaining the illusion that this Government is a willing partner for peace,” he said, recalling Israel’s “flagrant violations” of sovereignty of Lebanon, Iran, Syria, Tunisia, and most recently Qatar.\n“They visit our country and plot to attack it. They negotiate with delegations and plot to assassinate the members of the negotiation,” said Qatar’s Amir Tamim bin Hamad al Thani, recalling that Doha, on 9 September, had suffered attacks which targeted the negotiating delegation of Hamas in a residential neighbourhood. Israel desires to impose its will on its Arab neighbours, and everyone who opposes its will is either antisemitic or a terrorist, despite that Israel's allies realize this fact and reject it.\nRhetoric of War Gaining Ground, While International Law Is Treated as Suggestion Rather Than a Rule\nFélix-Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo, President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, said that the rhetoric of war is gaining ground in Gaza, Ukraine, Yemen, Myanmar and Syria, as well as his own country, where, over three decades, war has become a “predatory exercise” and a “silent genocide”. The illegal exploitation of natural resources is a major cause of conflict, he said, calling upon the UN to ensure the strict enforcement of the peace agreement between his country and Rwanda. “Otherwise, the blood of innocents will continue to flow,” he warned.\nInternational law is being treated as a suggestion rather than a rule, Karol Nawrocki, President of Poland, said, highlighting the way the world has changed since the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine. Moscow speaks of the “root causes of the conflict”, but these are primarily ideological, as it views other nations as colonial property and justifies invasion as a historical correction. He drew attention to the violation of Poland’s borders by Russian Federation drones on the night of 9 September. Holding the Russian Federation accountable should be a common duty, he said.\nGitanas Nausėda, President of Lithuania, also called for accountability for Moscow’s war crimes, including mass killings and the deportation and indoctrination of children. His country is the co-founder of the Register of Damage for Ukraine. With other eligible States’ support, the Russian Federation’s frozen assets will be used to help Ukraine defend itself and rebuild, he said. He asked: “If one UN member is attacked with impunity year after year by a permanent member of the Security Council, what does that mean for the rest of us?”\nCalls for Security Council Reform, Woman Secretary-General\nInstead of working for peace, some of the five permanent Council members “work in their own interests instead”, Slovenia’s President Nataša Pirc Musar emphasized. She was among the many speakers today who called for urgent reform of that body. The Assembly must request an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on whether any permanent Council member can claim a legitimate veto right over international norms. She also noted that only 13 per cent of leaders of multilateral organizations have been women, and the UN has never had a woman as Secretary-General. “Let us make history.” By the end of this session, there should be a Madam Secretary-General-elect, she stressed.\nSouth Africa would support the nomination of a female Secretary-General, Cyril Matamela Ramaphosa, its President affirmed. He, too, stressed that there is an immediate need for Security Council reform through text-based negotiations, as it is unacceptable that Africa, with 1.4 billion people, and South America are not represented in that organ. “This is unjust, this is unacceptable and this must end.”\nIt is time to remedy the fact that the Organization, in its 80-year history, has not been led by a woman as Secretary-General, Gabriel Boric Font, President of Chile, said, as he officially nominated Michelle Bachelet for that post. He pointed out that it is Latin America’s turn to fill the post and Ms. Bachelet — a two-time President of Chile — is a former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Having a woman at the helm of the UN would send a clear signal that nowhere is closed off to women. Ms. Bachelet can build bridges between East and West, as well as North and South, with her proven ability to make decisions and act, he said. Under her leadership the United Nations can restore its credibility and sense of purpose to become a place of hope for the world.\n__________\nBelow are full summaries of the speakers in today’s general debate\nUnited Nations Secretary-General António Guterres\nOpening the general debate of the eightieth session of the General Assembly, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres recalled that the creation of the Organization was a conscious decision for cooperation over chaos, law over lawlessness, peace over conflict. Warning that the world has “entered in an age of reckless disruption and relentless human suffering”, he challenged world leaders to choose a future: “A world of raw power — or a world of laws. A world that is a scramble for self-interest — or a world where nations come together.”\nOutlining “five critical choices”, he urged Member States to choose peace rooted in international law. “Impunity is the mother of chaos — and it has spawned some of the most atrocious conflicts of our times,” he warned. In Sudan, civilians are being slaughtered, starved and silenced, he said, underscoring the importance of ending the external support that is fuelling the bloodshed. Commending recent diplomatic efforts by the United States and other countries to end the war in Ukraine, he called for a full ceasefire and a just, lasting peace. “In Gaza, the horrors are approaching a third monstrous year,” he observed, citing “a scale of death and destruction beyond any other conflict” in his years as Secretary-General. He reiterated his condemnation of the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023 and the taking of hostages, while underscoring that “nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people and the systematic destruction of Gaza”. He called for the full and immediate implementation of the International Court of Justice measures, a permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages and humanitarian access. “And we must not relent in the only viable answer to sustainable Middle East peace: a two-State solution,” he stated.\nStressing that “human rights are not an ornament of peace — they are its bedrock”, he said they require everyday battle and political will. The fuel to achieve them through the shared road map of the Sustainable Development Goals needs financing to fuel it, but aid cuts are wreaking havoc. “To choose dignity, we must choose financial justice and solidarity,” he said, calling for reform of the international financial architecture. On climate change, Mr. Guterres warned that “the window is closing” to limit temperature rise to 1.5°C by the end of this century. “We need stepped-up action and ambition — especially through strengthened national climate plans,” he said, stressing that the Group of 20 (G20) — the biggest emitters — must lead. He called for scaled-up climate finance, including a credible road map to mobilize $1.3 trillion annually for developing countries by 2035, doubling adaptation finance to $40 billion this year, and full capitalization of the Loss and Damage Fund. Addressing the impact of technology, he said: “Technology must be our servant — not our master.” Welcoming the Assembly’s decision to establish an Independent International Scientific Panel on Artificial Intelligence and an annual Global Dialogue on AI Governance, he cautioned against unregulated use of artificial intelligence (AI): “No company should be above the law. No machine should decide who lives or dies.”\nTo meet all these goals, Mr. Guterres said, the international community must choose to strengthen the United Nations for the twenty-first century. Describing as “indefensible” the fact that for every dollar invested to build peace, the world spends 750 dollars on weapons of war, he emphasized: “In this moment of crisis, the United Nations has never been more essential.” “Together, let us choose to invest in a United Nations that adapts, innovates and is empowered to deliver for people everywhere,” he said. Concluding, the Secretary-General urged Member States to act decisively: “In a world of many choices, there is one choice we must never make: the choice to give up. We must never give up. For peace. For dignity. For justice. For humanity.”\nAnnalena Baerbock (Germany), President of the General Assembly\nAnnalena Baerbock (Germany), President of the General Assembly, underscored current challenges amid the United Nations’ eightieth anniversary. “This is not an ordinary year,” she said, highlighting the plight of people in crisis zones such as Gaza, Ukraine, Haiti and the Democratic Republic of Congo. She called for the UN to do better and “not let cynics weaponize these failures” by saying that the institution is outdated or irrelevant. She asked whether, when the principles of the UN Charter are ignored, it is the UN that has failed. “It is not the Charter which fails,” nor the UN as an institution, she said. “The Charter is only as strong as Member States’ willingness to uphold it,” and to hold its violators accountable. Imagine how much worse off the world would be without the UN, she emphasized, noting that the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) educates 26 million children and the World Food Programme (WFP) helps nearly 125 million people.\nThis session is about finding the resolve to be better together. The institution was born “in a world on fire” and since then has been “a compass pointing towards peace, humanity and justice.” It’s story is not one of easy victories, but of falling and rising, of pulling each other back up and trying harder. Today, the United Nations gathers to prove that it — and every nation represented within it — can summon strength and unity first shown in San Francisco 80 years ago. The founders showed that leadership is not about imposing one’s will, but rather, lifting others up — acting from a sense of altruism, mutual benefit and even self-interest. Helping others makes one’s own country stronger — as seen in response to the global pandemic, climate crisis, the development of international aviation safety regulations and efforts to ensure AI does not go unchecked. “In this globalized, digitalized world, we work together — or we suffer alone.”\nShe introduced the theme of this session, “Better Together: 80 Years and More for Peace, Development and Human Rights”. Living up to that theme will not be easy, but the General Assembly was made to confront the hardest topics and resolve differences. “But, even the house of dialogue and diplomacy needs a renovation,” she stressed, underlining that the UN80 initiative and wider reform process are necessities. She emphasized that it is a make-or-break moment. The General Assembly must deliver an agile, cost-effective and fit-for-purpose institution, with reform in every capital, delivering on the Pact for the Future and accelerating the Sustainable Development Goals, without which there can be no lasting peace. She highlighted the upcoming selection of the next Secretary-General, of which there has never been a woman chosen. It is not only an issue of representation but also of the credibility of the UN, she said.\nBrazil: Luiz Inácio Lula Da Silva, President\nLuiz Inácio Lula Da Silva, President of Brazil, highlighted the link between the “multilateralism crisis and the weakening of democracy,” observing that “throughout the world, anti-democratic forces are trying to subjugate institutions and stifle freedoms”. They worship violence, praise ignorance, act as physical and digital militias, and restrict the press”. Brazil has and will continue to defend its hard-won democracy from unilateral measures targeting its judiciary and economy, he stressed. A former Head of State was convicted of attacking democracy the first time in 525 years of Brazilian history. The right to defend himself in court was upheld — something that would be denied under a dictatorship. In doing so, Brazil sent a message to “aspiring autocrats” and their supporters: “Our democracy and sovereignty are non-negotiable.” Further, sound democracies reduce inequality and guarantee the most basic rights of food, safety, housing, education and health.\n“Poverty is as much an enemy of democracy as extremism,” he continued, highlighting that Brazil has been taken off the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Hunger Map in 2025 — though, globally, 2.3 billion people face food insecurity. “The only war of which everyone can emerge victorious is the one we wage against hunger and poverty,” he said, calling for a change in the international community’s priorities to focus on reducing arms spending, increasing development aid, providing debt relief for the poorest nations and setting a minimum global tax — “so that the super-rich pay more taxes than workers”. Democracy also protects family and childhood. In that vein, he voiced concern that digital platforms have been used to sow intolerance, misogyny, xenophobia and misinformation. Regulating the internet does not mean restricting the freedom of expression — it ensures that what is “illegal in the real world is treated that way in the virtual environment”. Objections to regulation cover up crimes such as human trafficking and paedophilia, he said, recalling that “the Brazilian Parliament was right to rush to address this issue” in recent legislation.\nTurning to Latin America and the Caribbean, he voiced concern over growing polarization and instability in the region. Comparing crime to terrorism is “worrying”, he added, condemning the use of lethal force in situations that are not armed conflict as “executing people without trial”. Such interventions cause more damage than intended. “The path to dialogue must not be closed in Venezuela. Haiti has the right to a violence-free future. And it is unacceptable that Cuba is listed as a country that sponsors terrorism,” he underlined. However, “no situation is more emblematic of the disproportionate and illegal use of force than the one occurring in Palestine”. Condemning the Hamas terror attacks, he said “nothing justifies the ongoing genocide in Gaza”. International humanitarian law and the myth of Western exceptionalism are buried under the rubble there. The survival of the Palestinian people requires an independent State.\n“Bombs and nuclear weapons will not protect us from of the climate crisis,” he said. 2024 was the hottest year on record, he continued, noting that the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Belem will be a moment “for world leaders to prove the seriousness of their commitment to the planet”. For its part, Brazil has committed to reduce its emissions by between 59 and 67 per cent in all economic sectors. His country has also reduced deforestation by half in the Amazon in the past two years. He stressed that confrontation is not inevitable, calling for “leaders […] who understand that the international order is not a ‘zero-sum game’”. In an increasingly multipolar world, peace requires multilateralism, he concluded.\nUnited States: Donald J. Trump, President\nUnited States President Donald J. Trump underscored what he described as historic economic and foreign policy achievements, contrasting his record with that of the Joseph R. Biden Administration. He said that, during “four years of President Biden, we had less than $1 trillion of new investment coming into the United States,” while “in just less than eight months under [his] presidency, much more than $17 trillion is being invested into the United States”. He also declared: “My Administration has implemented the largest tax cuts and the largest regulation cuts in the history of the country.”\nImmigration was a centrepiece of his remarks. “Our message is very simple: If you come illegally into the United States, you’re going to jail or you’re going back to where you came from, or perhaps even worse — you know what that means,” he said. He denounced former President Biden’s policies for failing to protect children: “Joe Biden’s policies lost nearly 300,000 children who were trafficked into the United States; under the Biden watch, many of whom have been raped, exploited and abused. Nobody talks about it — the mainstream media doesn’t talk about this,” he told the Assembly\nMr. Trump also pointed to his record on trade and conflict resolution. “In the period of seven months, I ended seven un-endable — they said they were un-endable — wars,” he said. He criticized the United Nations for offering little help: “What is the purpose of the United Nations,” he asked the 193-member Assembly. The UN seems to write very strongly worded letters, but “empty words don’t solve war”, he said. While some suggested he should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, Mr. Trump said: “The real prize will be to save millions of lives.”\nOn Iran, Mr. Trump said that the “world’s number-one sponsor of terror cannot even be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon”. He added that “today, many of Iran’s military commanders — in fact I can say almost all of them — are no longer with us”. What the United States has done, no other country has the ability to do. He claimed that with Iran’s enrichment capabilities “completely demolished”, his Administration had also brokered an end to the 12-day war.\nHe urged immediate action in Gaza. “Release the hostages now — just release the hostages now,” he said. “We have to negotiate peace, get the hostages back — all 20 back — and 38 dead bodies back.” He warned against unilateral recognition of a Palestinian State, saying it would amount to “a reward to Hamas for its horrible atrocities”.\nOn Ukraine, Mr. Trump said he “always thought that would be the easiest” war to end because of his relationship with Russian Federation President Vladimir V. Putin. Instead, he said, the conflict has dragged on for three years, “killing 5,000 to 7,000 young people a week”. He accused North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries of hypocrisy: “They are buying oil and gas from Russia when they are fighting Russia,” he said. His proposed solution was tariffs: If Russia does not end the war, the United States will impose very strict tariffs which would end the war very quickly, but the Europeans have to adopt them, as well, he said.\nThe United Nations came under repeated criticism during President Trump’s speech. Mr. Trump recalled his past bid to rebuild UN Headquarters: “Many years ago, I bid to rebuild the United Nations for $500 million, but they decided to go into another direction which produced a much more inferior complex.” Instead, he said, “they spent between $2 billion and $4 billion, and did not even get the marble floors I promised them”. On migration, he said that, in 2024, the United Nations spent “$372 million in cash to support 624,000 migrants to journey into the United States to infiltrate our southern border”. He also added: “The UN is supposed to stop invasions, not promote them.”\nMr. Trump also attacked climate policy and renewable energy. “Windmills are pathetic,” he said, calling the carbon footprint “a hoax”. He argued: “If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail.” Citing Germany’s struggles, he warned that “energy and open immigration is destroying Europe”. He pointed to China’s emissions: “China now produces more CO2 than all the other developed nations in the world,” he said.\nClosing on a call for national sovereignty, Mr. Trump said: “America belongs to the American people, and I encourage all countries to take a stance in the defence of their own people.\nIndonesia: Prabowo Subianto, President\nRecalling the words of the United States Declaration of Independence that inspired democratic movements across continents and gave birth to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the UN in 1948 — \"All men are created equal\" — Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto said it was the creed that opened the way to unprecedented global prosperity and dignity. Yet the world continues to face grave challenges and uncertainties. “Human folly, fueled by fear, racism, hatred, oppression, and apartheid, threatens our common future,” he stressed. He recalled that for centuries, Indonesians had lived under colonial domination and oppression, “treated less than dogs in our own homeland”, denied justice and equal opportunity. “In our struggle for independence, in our fight to overcome hunger, disease and poverty, the UN stood with Indonesia and gave us vital assistance,” he emphasized. Indeed, decisions by the Security Council and the Assembly had given Indonesia international legitimacy, opened doors, and supported its early development through UNICEF, FAO, World Health Organization (WHO) and many other UN institutions.\nAcknowledging that the world is driven by conflict, injustice, and deepening uncertainty, he urged the international community not to give up. “We must draw closer, not drift apart,” he stressed. “The UN was born from the ashes of the Second World War that claimed scores of millions of lives; it was created to secure peace, security, justice, and freedom for all.” He reiterated Indonesia’s commitment to internationalism, multilateralism, and “to every effort that strengthens this great institution”. He said that today, Indonesia is nearer than ever before to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals of ending extreme poverty and hunger — “because 78 years ago this chamber chose to listen to and uphold social and economic justice”.\nAs the world’s largest island State, “we testify before you that we are already experiencing the direct consequences of climate change, particularly the threat of rising sea levels”, he said, confirming Indonesia’s aims to achieve net zero emission by 2060, reforest more than 12 million hectares of degraded land, reduce forest degradation and empower local communities with quality green jobs for the future. “Indonesia is shifting decisively from fossil fuel-based development towards renewable-based development.” Starting next year, most of Indonesia’s additional power generation capacity will come from renewables.\nTurning to the “catastrophic situation” in Gaza, he recalled that Indonesia is one of the largest contributors to UN peacekeeping forces and pledged to continue to serve where peace needs guardians. “We are ready to deploy 20,000 or even more of our sons and daughters to help secure peace in Gaza or elsewhere – in Ukraine, Sudan or Libya,” he stressed. This year, his country recorded the highest rice production and grain reserves in its history. It is now self‑sufficient in rice and exports rice to other nations in need, including to Palestine. “With a strong UN, we can build a world where the weak do not “suffer what they must, but live the justice they deserve”, he continued, expressing hope that world leaders will show “great statesmanship, great wisdom, restraint and humility”. Reiterating Indonesia’s complete support for the two-State solution, he called for both Palestine and Israel to be free and independent, safe and secure from threats and terrorism.\nTürkiye: Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President\nRecep Tayyip Erdoğan, President of Türkiye, voiced regret at the absence of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at a time when Palestine is being recognized by an increasing number of countries. “I call on all the other countries who have not done so yet to recognize the State of Palestine as soon as possible,” he said. President Erdoğan warned that grave events unfolding worldwide, particularly in Gaza, were casting “a shadow” over the UN Charter’s opening article: to maintain international peace and security. “Right before our very eyes genocide has been going on for over 700 days now and as we speak, Israel is currently massacring civilians in Gaza,” he said. Over 65,000 people have been killed, including over 20,000 children, he observed, adding: “For the last 23 months, a child has been murdered by Israel in Gaza every hour. Yes, every hour.”\nPainting a grim picture of conditions in Gaza marked by starvation, the collapse of healthcare infrastructure, destruction of schools and hospitals, targeting of journalists and humanitarian workers, with children undergoing amputations without anaesthesia, he stated: “This represents the lowest point of humanity. Human history has not witnessed such bloodshed within the last century”. He said “there is no war in Gaza,” as one cannot talk about the presence of two sides, when one side is represented by a regular army with the most modern weapons and the other is represented by innocent civilians and children. “This is not fight against terrorism. This is an occupation, deportation, exile, genocide and life destruction,” he asserted. Noting that Israel is not limiting itself to Gaza and the West Bank, but also launching attacks on Syria, Iran, Yemen and Lebanon, he underscored: “The attack on Qatar has also shown that the Israeli leadership is now completely out of control.” He said “we cannot continue with this madness anymore,” calling for an immediate ceasefire, unimpeded humanitarian access and accountability under international law. “Everyone who is keeping silent is an accomplice to this barbarity,” he emphasized. He urged world leaders to have the courage to fulfil their humanitarian duty towards Gaza “where children are raising children”.\nTurning to regional issues, President Erdoğan voiced support for a political resolution in Syria, welcoming the “8 December revolution” as a step towards “a unified Syria with no forms of terrorism”. He expressed hope that the nuclear issue with Iran would be resolved through diplomacy as soon as possible, adding: “It should not be forgotten that our region cannot tolerate yet another crisis.” Stressing the importance of Iraq’s stability for regional well-being, he also underlined Türkiye’s role in facilitating dialogue between Russia and Ukraine under the Istanbul process, noting: “Do not forget there is no winner of war and no losers of a just peace.” He welcomed steps towards peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia, commended progress under the Ankara process and reiterated his call for international recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, declaring: “There are two separate States and two separate peoples on the island of Cyprus. […] The international community must put an end to the unfair and inhumane isolation that the Turkish Cypriots have been subjected to for half a century now.”\nReaffirming support for the Secretary-General’s UN80 Initiative, he concluded with a call for reform of the Security Council: “We will continue to say the world is bigger than five until a system is established where the righteous are powerful, not the powerful are righteous. Our duty is not to abandon the system, but rather to repair it and to make it work again. Without a doubt, a more just and fairer world is possible. Türkiye will patiently continue its fight for the construction of a more just world.”\nPeru: Dina Ercilia Boluarte Zegarra, President\nDina Ercilia Boluarte Zegarra, President of Peru, underlined that totalitarianism is renewing itself and remains a serious global threat. This “cynical narrative” is reinforced by intervention in the internal affairs of countries “supporting and spreading falsehoods to destroy democracy and eliminate freedom”. All ideologies of hate — class, racial, religious, nationalist, ethnic and gender, among others — are causes of the worst crimes in human history. “Ideologies of hatred build narratives as absolute truths that instrumentalize people and nations.” Peru rejects the two principal narratives of hate in the world — class and religious hatred — which are the root causes of wars and inhumane violence. She said the UN represents a historic milestone of the twentieth century, but in this century “we must be more vigilant” and uphold the duty to prevent the world from plunging into new genocides and violence.\nHighlighting global challenges such as invasions, wars, international criminal networks, drug trafficking, illegal mining and slavery, she said these are times “that recall the darkest chapters of our modern history”. Her country “is convinced that the world does not need a less UN, but more and a better UN”, a UN that is in tune with the times in which ideologies of hatred that continue to cause so much damage to humanity “have taken refuge in lies, in misinformation, and have penetrated democratic societies”. As a founding member, Peru is committed to an open multilateral system based on international law and the principles of the Charter. She urged Member States to fulfil their duty to help find solutions to common problems, as her country is striving to do. Interconnectedness among societies and economies means that crises can only be resolved through international cooperation.\nReforms must restore the representativeness and effectiveness of the UN, she continued. Otherwise, the international community risks losing one of its most precious instruments for world stability. Peru supports the UN80 Initiative and emphasizes the need to refocus the Organization on its fundamental functions, bringing it closer to people’s needs while making it more efficient. The initiative should strengthen multilateralism and enable the UN to be better prepared for achieving its essential goals. For these reforms to bear fruit, they must be complemented by a transformation in UN governance. She said her administration, at home, is working to strengthen security and improve human capital, as well as enhance health and education, modernize infrastructure, stop corruption and guarantee free and impartial elections. Peru is facing attacks against its democratic institutions and the rule of law, including from transnational organized terrorist crime that destroys the social fabric. It also contends with climate change, which is destroying its Amazon rainforest.\nBut, she added, these problems are global, not solely national. “This is why we need the United Nations to once again be a forum for dialogue and cooperation.” She called for the next Secretary-General to come from Latin America, given the region’s commitment to the Charter and for better representation. The General Assembly must reflect a reaffirmation of Member States’ commitment to collective action that revitalizes the UN as a tool for peace, global unity and development. She urged nations to “stand firm in the truth” and oppose narratives that try to conceal it, pervert it or openly lie in order to hide agendas that do not correspond to the times. “For this reason, it is essential that we strengthen truth against narratives that are based on hatred, the repeated lie that seeks to impose itself and only leads to destruction,” she concluded.\nJordan: Abdullah II bin Al Hussein, King\nAbdullah II bin Al Hussein, King of Jordan said: “Another year. Another UN General Assembly, and another occasion when I stand before you to address the same issue: the Middle East”. Questioning “the utility of words” considering the magnitude of the crisis, he recalled that although 80 years ago the world vowed “‘Never again’, for almost as long, Palestinians have been living through cruel cycle of ‘yet again’”. They are bombed indiscriminately, killed, displaced and denied their basic humanity “yet again”. How long before a resolution to this conflict — one that safeguards the rights of all sides — is found, he asked. Though not the only conflict in the world, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is unique as it is “the longest-standing conflict in the world, an illegal occupation of a helpless population by a self-declared ‘democratic nation’ and a flagrant violation of UN resolutions, international law and human rights convention”.\nSuch failures should have been met with outrage — especially from major democracies, he stressed. Instead, they have only been met with “decades of inertia”. The conflict has been on the UN agenda throughout its 80 years of existence. “How long will we be satisfied with condemnation after condemnation without concrete action?” he continued. Neither interim agreements nor temporary stopgaps have delivered results. Moreover, many of these processes could be seen as distractions “as Israel grabbed more land, expanded illegal settlements, demolished homes and displaced entire neighbourhoods”. Throughout, Israelis have not been able to live in security because military action cannot bring them safety. No where is that more evident than in Gaza, where more than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, starvation is widespread and the rubble of hospitals, schools, mosques and churches stretches for miles, he said. “Never in our modern history has the lens of international media been obstructed like this — from capturing the reality on the ground”.\nVoicing concern for the current Israeli Government’s provocative calls for a ‘Greater Israel’, he stressed that such plans can only be achieved through violating the territorial integrity of the country’s neighbours. “The international community must stop entertaining the illusion that this Government is a willing partner for peace,” he said, recalling Israel’s “flagrant violations” of sovereignty of Lebanon, Iran, Syria, Tunisia, and — most recently — Qatar. He called on the international community to hold all nations to the same standards and to recognise that statehood is not a reward, but an indisputable right. For its part, Jordan serves as the main base for the international humanitarian response in Gaza in line with his country’s heritage of compassion and generosity to people in need. A glimmer of hope exists as more nations support a permanent ceasefire in Gaza — ensuring the release of all hostages, unhindered humanitarian aid and support for the Palestinian people to rebuild.\n“Repeated wars are teaching generations of Israelis and Palestinians that their only recourse is the gun,” he continued, stressing that “security will only come when Palestine and Israel begin to co-exist side by side”. The two-State solution, in line with UN resolutions, with a viable, independent Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital, living alongside a secure Israel, has been a goal promoted by the Arab Peace Initiative for almost 25 years. “The world’s conscience” is stirring with the courage of ordinary people. Raising their voices as one, they declare “it has been too long” he said, urging that “the United Nations must echo that call […] and it must act on that call until peace is a reality.”\nRepublic of Korea: Lee Jae Myung, President\nThe Republic of Korea’s President opened his address by linking its national story to the achievements of the United Nations, underscoring how international solidarity shaped its survival and success. “If someone asks what the UN has achieved, I would confidently reply, ‘Look at the 80-year history of the Republic of Korea,’” he said. Emerging from colonial rule in 1945 and devastated by the Korean War, the Republic of Korea rebuilt itself with the UN’s support, benefiting from humanitarian aid, education and vaccination programmes that set the foundations for stability. The President also recalled, “Whenever the Republic of Korea revived the hopes of lives as precious as the weight of the universe amidst horrific wars and disasters, the UN flag fluttered at the centre of that intense solidarity.” Today, the Republic of Korea positions itself as both proof of the UN’s value and as a “beacon of light for global citizens”, intent on sharing its lessons of resilience with the wider world.\nHe stressed that the UN’s mission is far from complete. Global peace remains precarious, with armed conflicts and humanitarian crises persisting in every region. “The answer lies in the wisdom of the pioneers who founded the United Nations,” he said, adding: “There is only one way: more democracy.” With 280 million people facing extreme hunger and wars continuing in Ukraine and the Middle East, the need for revitalized multilateralism is urgent. The President welcomed the UN80 initiative as an effort to modernize the Organization, while also calling for institutional reform. For one, “the UN Security Council must increase the number of seats of non-permanent members, reflecting changes in the international environment”, he went on to say. As a current Council member, Seoul pledged to ensure that the body can respond “proactively to threats to international peace and security”.\nThe Korean Peninsula remains one of the gravest challenges for peace and security, he said, emphasizing that the Republic of Korea “respects the North’s current system” and “will not pursue unification by absorption” or engage in hostile acts. As a gesture of goodwill, the Republic of Korea suspended leaflet launches and broadcasts towards the North. Yet lasting peace requires more than restraint. “The most certain peace is a State where there is no need to fight,” he declared. While acknowledging that “denuclearization cannot be achieved in the short term”, he urged pragmatic steps, beginning with a stop to the sophistication of nuclear and missile capabilities, progressing to reduction and ultimately achieving dismantlement. “It is crucial for both the ROK and the DPRK, as well as the international community, to work together to establish peace on the Korean Peninsula,” he said, stressing that “lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula would present new hope and possibility to humanity suffering from conflict”.\nHe said, “Peace is not merely the absence of armed conflict, but the realization of a community where differences are respected and people coexist.” The Republic of Korea is committed to leading by example — transforming from an aid recipient into a donor nation, championing sustainable energy transitions, spearheading AI governance and promoting cultural exchange. “Though a difficult journey is expected, humanity has been able to grow and come this far by not giving up on challenges, even in the face of adversity,” he said.\nQatar: Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Amir\nQatar’s Amir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani said the United Nations was founded 80 years ago on universal principles shaped by the lessons of two world wars. “If we allow violations to continue, it means allowing the rule of the jungle where perpetrators and violators enjoy benefits just because they can,” he stressed. He called for restoring collective security based on the UN Charter, recalling that Doha on 9 September had suffered a treacherous attack which targeted the negotiating delegation of Hamas in a residential neighbourhood that includes schools and diplomatic missions. Having classified this heinous act as State terrorism, he denounced political assassinations and efforts that undermine any diplomatic efforts aimed at ending the genocide against the people in Gaza. “It is also an attempt to kill politicians who are members of a delegation that engages in negotiations with Israel while they were studying an American proposal,” he underscored.\nHe said, “Qatari mediation has in fact achieved, in cooperation with Egypt and the USA, the release of hostages.” The last agreement was negated by Israel unilaterally, preventing the ability to reach a permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages, the withdrawal of the occupying forces from the Gaza Strip or ensuring humanitarian access and the release of Palestinian prisoners. “They visit our country and plot to attack it. They negotiate with delegations and plot to assassinate the members of the negotiation,” he emphasized, adding that the Israeli leader wants to continue war and believes in what is called Greater Israel. “He believes that war is an opportunity to expand settlements and to change the status quo in the holy sites, in Al-Quds al-Sharif,” he continued. Israel desires to impose its will on its Arab neighbours, and everyone who opposes its will is either anti-Semitic or a terrorist, despite that Israel's allies realize this fact and reject it. “We will continue our efforts in cooperation and partnership with Egypt and the United States of America,” he pledged, appreciating the States that have recognized the State of Palestine and urging more States to recognize it.\nHe recalled that Qatar has continued its diplomatic efforts to contribute to the settlement of other crises, such as in Ukraine and wars in Africa, including the signing of a declaration of principles in Doha between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Congo River Alliance in March. “Our efforts support the leadership of the United States to achieve a peace agreement in the east of the country,” he stated. Speaking about Syria, he expressed hope for a path to achieve the aspirations of the Syrian people towards stability, development and the rule of law. Qatar will not spare an effort to provide the necessary support to its brothers and sisters in Syria who “will reject external interference, especially the Israeli attempts to divide Syria”. He said the Middle East has witnessed positive developments, citing the election of the President and appointment of the Prime Minister in Lebanon, and pledging support for Lebanon’s Government, people, institutions and army. Turning to Sudan, he called on all parties to prioritize the national interest and to engage in a comprehensive dialogue that leads to a permanent peace and preserves the unity, territorial integrity and independence of the country.\nSuriname: Jennifer Geerlings-Simons, President\nJennifer Geerlings-Simons, the President of Suriname, highlighted the UN’s achievements, for instance, in ending colonial rule, advancing human rights and working to establish a balanced world order. Yet, she admitted that it has also been unsuccessful in avoiding conflicts, wars and violations of human rights. She expressed heightened concern regarding the situation for people in Haiti, whom the Security Council recently heard are enduring a perfect storm of suffering. Suriname strongly believes conflicts should primarily be resolved through dialogue. She raised the question of what must be done differently over the next 80 years. The UN will only be successful if all nations “without exception, adhere to the resolutions it adopts”, stressing that “we can only keep the peace if we stop allowing that the votes of all the countries of the world can be nullified by one veto.”\nMember States must remind themselves that the world in which the UN was established no longer exists. Therefore, they must recommit to the principles and objectives of the Charter and recognize that all people of the world should have opportunities for a dignified life. The Council should be expanded to include all nations that exert major influence. Their exclusion will only increase the risk of conflict and obstruct beneficial cooperation that is needed for humanity to prosper. Her country endorses the inclusion of, amongst others, Brazil, India, African representation and a non—permanent rotating seat for small island developing States,, and low-lying coastal countries. The UN must be “a genuine unity of nations”, if it wants to play a crucial role in creating a prosperous future for humanity, she said, stressing: “We have no choice but to genuinely unite. All of us.”\nWhile developing offshore oil and gas for energy security, Suriname is also advancing its transition to renewable energy. “We know climate change is a fact.” It has achieved results in disease prevention, including this year being the first in the Amazon region to be declared malaria-free, by WHO. Her country’s example shows that it too can make a valuable contribution in combating infectious diseases. Turning to reparations for slavery, she acknowledged the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Ten Point Plan for Reparatory Justice, underscoring that “slavery was a crime, is a crime, against humanity.” Despite the Paris Agreement, the climate crisis is worse than was feared. “Our countries have least contributed to climate change, but are hit the hardest by its effects, directly impacting the livelihoods and economic growth of our peoples,” she said. The international community must urgently address the climate impacts facing small island developing States and countries with low-lying coastal areas.\nHer country is covered by rainforest and is one of the three carbon-negative countries on Earth. Each year it captures more carbon than it emits, “and we want to keep it that way”, she said. Protection and conservation of the forest, via sustainable foresting and Indigenous and Tribal communities’ stewardship, has been a priority. “We are proud of the way we did it, but pride alone does not pay the bills.” Forests are threatened by the potential development of gold, diamonds and bauxite. Suriname aims to maintain 90 per cent forest coverage but cannot do it alone. The world’s largest emitters must share in this responsibility, with “action, justice and finance”. She called for predictable climate finance for high-forested, low-deforestation countries; fair recognition of real carbon removals; and direct support for the communities who live in and protect these forests. Suriname endorses the initiative of the presidency of the thirtieth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP30) to launch the Tropical Forest Forever Facility.\nLithuania: Gitanas Nausėda, President\nGitanas Nausėda, President of Lithuania, noted that while the United Nations was never perfect, “it was the best international order we ever had”. Voicing concern over the slow erosion of the international order, he recalled that this is not the first time it has happened. The events of 1938 are a striking parallel — when the world chose appeasement over diplomacy and deterrence, producing the Munich Pact. The agreement emboldened the Nazi regime to expand but also provided a path for Soviet expansion through the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which would carve Europe into spheres of influence, leaving Lithuania and other Baltic States illegally occupied or annexed. “In 1938, it was Czechoslovakia that was abandoned. Today, we cannot abandon Ukraine alone,” he emphasized.\nWith the war in Ukraine well into its fourth year, the international community must do more to stop the aggressor. “If one UN member is attacked with impunity year after year by a permanent member of the Security Council, what does that mean for the rest of us?” he asked. The Russian Federation’s war against Ukraine, starting with Moscow’s illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014, has sparked energy, migration and food security crises worldwide. In Ukraine, the targeting of civilian infrastructure and deportation of children are pervasive — calculated efforts to erase Ukraine’s identity in open defiance of the UN Charter. “Lithuania will never recognize Russia’s illegal occupation and annexation of Ukrainian lands. Ukraine’s borders are not up for negotiation, and attempts to redraw them by force are unacceptable,” he stressed, recalling that the Russian Federation also continues to occupy two regions in Georgia, is destabilizing Moldova and uses proxies to spread instability in the Sahel.\nThose countries enabling the Russian Federation’s war against Ukraine violate international law, he said, urging the international community to maintain strong support — political, military, humanitarian and economic — for Ukraine. For its part, Lithuania has already provided 1 billion Euros in assistance. He also called on the international community to cease buying Russian energy resources to stop its war machine. “This is a country that understands only the language of force. Ukraine’s ability to deter aggression will be the decisive factor in the future,” he said, calling for accountability for Moscow’s war crimes, including mass killings and the deportation and indoctrination of children. His country also supports the Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression under the Council of Europe, he said, pressing all States to lend their support to it. “Accountability must have real consequences — legal, political and financial,” he said, noting that Lithuania is the co-founder of the Register of Damage for Ukraine. With other eligible States’ support, the Russian Federation’s frozen assets will be used to help Ukraine defend itself and rebuild.\nTurning to the situation in the Middle East, he said Lithuania has joined the international call for the immediate implementation of the Gaza ceasefire with the entry of humanitarian aid into the Strip. The unconditional release of all Israeli hostages remains a crucial step, he said, adding that there is no alternative but to revitalize a process towards a two-State solution. Amid uncertainty, “either we will repeat the mistakes of history, or we will find the resolve to defend the core principles of the United Nations”, he said. The United Nations must return to its founding purpose — “to prevent the scourge of war, to protect human dignity and to uphold the rights of nations large and small”. “Together, we must ensure that no permanent seat on the Security Council grants any State permanent impunity,” he concluded.\nPortugal: Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, President\nPortugal’s President paid tribute to United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, emphasizing his “humanism, devotion to international law and the reforms he has championed since 2017, now including UN80 and the Pact for the Future”. He described these efforts as “a testament to his work and his legacy”, adding that it is a source of pride to have a Portuguese citizen serving as Secretary-General, embodying “the Portuguese ethos in international relations”. Turning to the broader state of global governance, he warned that the United Nations faces an “existential moment”, stressing that “without change, without renewal, the United Nations will be marginalized, and we could be left to the law of force.” The choice, he underscored, is stark: either strengthen multilateralism or resign the world to fragmentation.\nHe argued that no alternative framework - “not G1, not G2, not G3, not G1 plus one or two” - could replace the universal system of the United Nations. “No absence of multilateralism will avoid the need of multilateralism,” he said, reminding delegates that the world is and will remain multipolar. He pointed to Ukraine and the Middle East as examples of crises where reliance on a few powerful States had failed to secure ceasefires. “We waited and waited for the intervention of the most powerful in the world. Did you have a ceasefire,” he asked. By contrast, he highlighted the recognition of the State of Palestine by a growing number of Member States as a sign of collective international will. “This means we need the United Nations. We need multilateralism. We need dialogue between countries from every continent,” he declared. He stressed that international law must underpin reform efforts, noting that “a world driven by rules is a safer and more predictable and equitable world”.\nOutlining priorities for reform, the President identified “three pillars: prevention, partnership and protection”. He emphasized the need for preventive action before conflict, not just afterwards, citing mediation, preventive diplomacy, and the active involvement of the Secretary-General and the Peacebuilding Commission. He warned against allowing “distraction and institutional collapse”, instead urging investment in peacebuilding that tackles the root causes of violence and promotes resilient societies. Development, he argued, is essential: “Peacebuilding without development, preventive action without development, does not work.” The President urged renewed focus on implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and reforming the international financial architecture, while harnessing emerging technologies - digital tools, space, and artificial intelligence - as “forces for peace, not tools for domination”. Bridging the digital and technological divides is central to building resilient, equitable societies.\nFinally, the President underlined Portugal’s commitment to climate action and ocean protection. “We can talk about combating climate change, but we must first and foremost admit that there is this change,” he said. Portugal has already designated 27 per cent of its marine surface as protected, moving towards the 30 per cent target set for 2030. He affirmed that ocean conservation, climate action, and sustainable development remain core priorities for his country’s diplomacy. With “great pride”, he said, Portugal will continue to press for international solutions that protect the planet and ensure that the United Nations remains a central, effective forum for collective action.\nUruguay: Yamandú Orsi, President\nYamandú Orsi, President of Uruguay, said it is now common practice in his country for a president to travel to neighbouring countries accompanied by his predecessors from other political parties. “I come from a country whose president can walk among the people without bodyguards, and can enjoy a football match in the stands of a stadium like any other supporter,” he stressed. Though his country is not a paradise and faces new challenges related to child poverty, public security and social inequality, the historical strength of its institutions and political system has allowed Uruguay to continue to stand out in the region for its high level of human development and income distribution policies.\nHe went on to say that Uruguay is recognized worldwide for its commitment to peace and for being a hospitable land for migrants from all latitudes. “According to the 2025 Global Peace Index, in 2023 there were 59 inter-State conflicts, this is the highest number since the end of the Second World War,” he noted. “In 2024, global military expenditure rose by almost 10 per cent in real terms when compared to 2023, this represents the largest annual increase since the end of the Cold War,” he said, adding that this expenditure of $2.7 trillion led to new forms of cruelty and death that wars now bear.\n“In our time, technological progress has unleashed more perverse means of waging war, including the use of military practices aimed at sowing fear, terror and death among the civilian population,” he warned. Condemning all forms of terrorism, he stressed that the main objective of current wars seems to be the systematic practice of extermination. “No State that claims to be democratic and to live under the rule of international law can, even under the legitimate right to defend itself against terrorism, exercise barbarity against any civilian population, least of all against especially vulnerable and defenseless persons,” he said. Supporting the principle of a two-State solution in the Middle East, he said his government takes reports produced by the international community concerning the Palestinian territories seriously, urging for the immediate suspension of military operations.\nHe also said that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the Assembly 77 years ago, stands as a revolutionary manifesto for the times we are living through, beginning with its first article. His country’s entire political system is proud to decisively contribute to global tasks, such as maintaining international peace and security, supporting disarmament, food security, global health and addressing climate change. “In the last 35 years and without interruption, Uruguay has deployed battalions to various United Nations peacekeeping operations,” he noted. His State has become the leading country in Latin America, and the second per capita worldwide, in contributing to these missions, and Uruguayan troops have become specialized in the most emblematic function of peace operations — the protection of civilians in armed conflicts. He added that, in 1907, his country took a firm stance at the Hague Conference on arbitration, seeing it as an essential and obligatory mechanism for resolving conflicts between States. “Just a few years later, in 1921, Uruguay was the first State in the world to accept the jurisdiction of the Permanent Court of International Justice, the predecessor of the International Court of Justice.” Uruguay is in an excellent position to offer itself to the world as a host for negotiations and promoter of networks of dialogue and mediation, he concluded.\nSlovenia: Nataša Pirc Musar, President\nSlovenia’s President, Nataša Pirc Musar, emphasized that, following the Second World War and Cold War, there were hopes for and beliefs in lasting peace, security, and cooperation, as enshrined in the UN Charter. Sadly, that vision has not materialized. “In fact, the situation has worsened.” That is because the Security Council “is failing to meet the expectations of the world — if it ever has”.\nInstead of working for peace, some of the five permanent Council members “work in their own interests instead”. The promise of the Sustainable Development Goals is also faltering, as millions of people are pushed further from the most basic services. International law appears to “stand at the precipice of irrelevance”. The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide risks becoming a relic and International Criminal Court prosecutors face intimidation. Countries are withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and UN agencies, diminishing multilateralism.\nShe questioned how to explain these trends to children, whether to tell them the mighty may kill with impunity because they can. She advocated for making a stronger UN by establishing a permanent advocacy network to give the Pact for the Future unconditional, sustained political support. She proposed the creation of a Global Forum for the Future, which would be a movement of nations working for multilateralism to drive the Pact of the Future’s implementation forward at every level. She said there must be reform of the Security Council, which should not be a body standing above international law to defend some interests at the expense of others. The Assembly must request an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on whether any permanent Council member can claim a legitimate veto right over such norms.\nThe gap in gender equity must be confronted, Ms. Musar said. Only 13 per cent of leaders of multilateral organizations have been women, and the UN has never had a woman as Secretary-General. “Let us make history!” By the end of this session, there should be a Madam Secretary-General-elect, she stressed. Yet, not only gender representation but actual gender equity must also be achieved. It benefits entire societies and requires systematic change. A gender perspective must be in every strand of international organisations’ policymaking, a result of the effective participation of women and girls. The UN can only succeed as a community if we accept that “there is no future for humanity without a fundamental change”. The mandate of the Global Forum for the Future would be to push towards such a change that would inspire hundreds of millions of people.\nGovernments, artists, influencers and visionaries, using science, technology and global connectivity, can join to defend humanity, creating an irresistible voice demanding real action by all Governments on the Pact for the Future, she added They can hold to account those behind wars, genocidal policies, and crimes against humanity. This requires inclusive and fearless leadership. “We must not surrender to a world where power alone prevails.” If leaders can offer nothing but terror, conflict, pollution, fear, inequalities, and war, then “we are complicit in crimes against our civilisation and our planet.” She called for efforts to reject arrogance, hatred, and wilful blindness of inequality and injustice, wars of aggression, crimes against humanity, and genocide — “because they tear us apart, for generations”. “We should do the right thing. We did not stop the Holocaust, we did not stop the genocide in Rwanda, we did not stop the genocide in Srebrenica. We must stop the genocide in Gaza. There are no excuses anymore. None.”\nKazakhstan: Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, President\nKassym-Jomart Tokayev, President of Kazakhstan, highlighted a “crisis of trust” in multilateral institutions, decrying that “serious violations of international law have become a new normality”. The international community must empower the United Nations to act. In that vein, a comprehensive reform of the Organization and Security Council is necessary. Council reform must include the representation of major powers from Asia, Africa and Latin America, he said, adding that voices of “responsible Middle East Powers” must also be amplified in the organ. Without action, “the UN is doomed to forever mitigate consequences while root causes forever proliferate,” he said, also suggesting that the UN Charter be reviewed in reforming the Organisation.\nVoicing alarm that arms control treaties are collapsing, he noted that global military spending reached a record of 2.7 trillion dollars in 2024, while the cost of violence inflicted came to almost 20 trillion dollars. To that end, he called on nations to relaunch a high-level dialogue among nuclear powers. Getting rid of the “militant mentality” can be measured by how much countries invest in peace, he said. For its part, Kazakhstan is ready to host a new dialogue on nuclear disarmament and will advance its proposal to establish an International Agency for Biological Safety and Security. Turning to the Ukrainian crisis, he voiced concern that it continues to undermine international security, adding that bilateral and international efforts should be carried out with flexibility to meet the long-term interests of both States. Similarly, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza cannot be ignored. The normalization of relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia under the mediation of the United States “shows that entrenched conflicts can be settled through diplomacy and common sense”, he emphasized.\nHe added that: “Current geopolitical tensions sometimes tempt some leaders to claim that a clash of civilizations is inevitable. Yet, these divisions are not fact or fate. They are political choices.” Moreover, statements made by political leaders that manipulate religion and identity for political gain damage trust and goodwill. Turning to his country’s economy, he said Kazakhstan’s location in the centre of Eurasia positions it to play a role as a logistics hub, handling 80 per cent of all land transit between Asia and Europe. His country is investing billions of dollars in its transit infrastructure, including the Belt and Road initiative and the Trans-Caspian Corridor. However, climate change is a major threat in his region. Recalling 2024 was the hottest year on record, he stressed that Central Asia is warming at twice the global rate. The melting of the glaciers in the Alatau mountains multiplies threats to food and water security for millions.\nAnd while his country succeeded in preserving the Northern part of the Aral Sea, the Caspian Sea is now rapidly shrinking, he noted. Calling on the international community to take urgent steps to preserve the Caspian’s water resources, he said his country will host a Regional Ecological Summit in Astana in April 2026 to advance such an agenda. Nonetheless, Kazakhstan’s energy strategy is based on oil, gas, coal, uranium and critical minerals. “Climate change and the green agenda cannot be accepted by all countries that have huge deposits like coal, which nowadays can be cleaned up by advanced technologies,” he said, adding that Kazakhstan has committed to decarbonize in 35 years. Noting that his country will continue cooperating with all international partners to diversify its economy to increase resilience, he added that Kazakhstan will also continue to serve as a bridge builder, to choose “peace over war”.\nSouth Africa: Cyril Matamela Ramaphosa, President\nCyril Matamela Ramaphosa, President of South Africa, said that, now more than ever, Member States are called upon to uphold the values of the UN Charter, enhance solidarity between nations and safeguard the institutions that enable multilateralism. He welcomed the strong partnership between the African Union and the United Nations, adding that South Africa’s presidency of the Group of 20 marks the first time that entity will convene a summit on the African continent — “the cradle of humanity” — with a focus on disaster resilience, debt sustainability for low-income countries, energy transition financing and harnessing critical minerals for inclusive growth and sustainable development.\nAfrica is a continent “irreversibly on the rise,” yet many of the Sustainable Development Goals remain elusive due to a lack of financial resources, he said, emphasizing that many developing countries spend more on debt servicing than on health or education. Trade is one of the most important instruments for mobilizing domestic resources for development, yet it now is being used as a weapon against several countries, he said, insisting that the economic embargo against Cuba must be lifted “and we want it lifted sooner rather than later”.\nWith global military expenditure at historic highs, “we must act decisively to silence all the guns everywhere to realize the goals of sustainable development and global peace — and I do believe that this is an objective that is possible to reach,” he said. Yet the UN’s relevance is being wilfully undermined by a growing reliance on unilateral military action, he said, citing the situations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan and elsewhere. Turning to the Middle East, he said Member States have a responsibility to ensure and protect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. “There is a growing consensus that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza,” he said, adding that South Africa is insisting that the International Court of Justice make a ruling that genocide is indeed being committed in Gaza “and that it must stop”.\nOn other issues, he said that insufficient progress is being made on nuclear disarmament, despite the adoption of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. That instrument’s first review conference, chaired by South Africa, will take place next year. He added that South Africa would support the nomination of a female Secretary-General, stressing also that there is an immediate need for Security Council reform through text-based negotiations, as it is unacceptable that Africa, with 1.4 billion people, and South America are not represented in that organ. “This is unjust, this is unacceptable and this must end.” Citing the UN80 initiative, he said that structural changes must be implemented across the UN system in the face of reduced funding to build an Organization that can effectively fulfil its mandates and uphold international law. He went on to say: “We must reaffirm that freedom is indivisible and that the denial of the rights of one person diminishes the freedom of all of us.”\nUzbekistan: Shavkat Mirziyoyev, President\nShavkat Mirziyoyev, President of Uzbekistan, said his country’s priority goal is “to fundamentally transform the lives of each and every family and citizen in our country”, adding that it is building a democratic, social and secular “new Uzbekistan in full alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals”.\nHis country has managed to reduce its poverty rate from 35 per cent to 6.6 per cent in recent years through the transformation of the education and science sector, establishment of innovative industries and modernization of green energy and transport infrastructure, among others. Preschool education coverage has increased from 27 per cent to 78 per cent, while higher education rates have risen from 9 per cent to 42 per cent. The country is also investing in advanced healthcare and is aiming to “strengthen the role of women in social, political and business life”, he said, advocating for holding the Asian Women's Forum regularly in his region, turning it into a permanent platform. ”By 2030, we intend to join the ranks of upper-middle income countries,” he emphasized.\nTurning to his region, he said: “The era of closed borders, unresolved disputes and conflicts is in the past.” In recent years, the volume of mutual trade, investments and transportation of goods in the region has increased fivefold, and its countries are implementing “joint investment funds, cross-border trade and industrial cooperation zones”. The Consultative Meetings of the Heads of State of Central Asia have become an effective mechanism for deepening regional integration, he said, adding: “I can confidently affirm that, as of now, we are at the beginning stage of forming a New Central Asia.”\nTo deepen such cooperation, he proposed several projects, such as holding an international forum under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) dedicated to the economic development of Central Asian States. Another proposal is to establish a regional hub for green technologies in industry. Also stressing the need to support “the aspirations of the Afghan people for a peaceful and stable life”, he said it is crucial “to prevent this country's isolation” and proposed adopting a UN resolution on the development of transport and energy corridors of international significance through its territory. Highlighting the vulnerability of the global transport system and the impact on landlocked developing countries, he said it is important “to ensure the security of international transit corridors and to establish efficient logistics networks”.\nTurning to climate change, he highlighted the consequences of the Aral Sea desiccation. His country is working to restore that ecosystem, he said, noting that “salt-tolerant desert plants have been planted on 2 million hectares of the dried seabed”. By 2030, there will be green cover on 80 per cent of this area, he said, adding: “The water crisis is a serious threat to sustainable development.” Another adverse consequence of climate change is the intensifying trend of climate migration, he said, advocating for the adoption of a global pact for a broad international partnership on this issue.\nHe also proposed the creation of an international mechanism to facilitate “the gratis exchange of practical solutions and models of artificial intelligence in healthcare, education and culture”. In addition, he put forward a proposal to establish a World Youth Movement for Peace and locate its headquarters in his country, adding that in the coming months his country will open a Centre of Islamic Civilization.\nMongolia: Khurelsukh Ukhnaa, President\nKhurelsukh Ukhnaa, President of Mongolia, said the United Nations has “illuminated the path of humanity, serving as a steadfast beacon of hope and trust for nations to maintain peaceful co-existence and share a prosperous future”. He noted that the theme for the eightieth Assembly session challenges the international community to not only assess and reflect the Organization’s achievements and challenges since its founding but strengthen its work in accordance with the UN Charter and the principles of international law. Highlighting his country’s efforts towards the maintenance of global peace and security, he noted his government’s active collaboration with the United Nations in peacekeeping operations, and advancing proposals in the areas of socioeconomic development, environment, and climate change. For the past 23 years, “Mongolia has deployed more than 23,000 peacekeepers to 16 United Nations peacekeeping missions and consistently ranked among the top 20 troop- and police-contributing countries out of more than 120 Member States”, he said.\nHe further announced that, as the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Security Council’s resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security approaches, his country has, by steadily increasing the deployment of female military personnel, reached 14 per cent in its women peacekeepers’ proportion in 2025. “Mongolia will continue to extend its unwavering support to the United Nations in its efforts to maintain international peace and security, and remains committed to contributing to peacekeeping operations,” he said. Turning to the Sustainable Development Goals, he pointed out that his government has implemented the goals to 66.7 per cent, placing it fourteenth on the United Nations multilateralism index, and further expressed pleasure that the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Seville, agreed to increase developing country engagement as well as take comprehensive actions to reform the current international financial architecture.\nHe urged landlocked developing countries to align their national development plans with the Awaza Programme of Action, while mobilizing all available resources to strengthen regional integration and cooperation. He therefore urged the international community, including financial institutions and development partners to provide concrete support and cooperation for such countries. Spotlighting Mother Earth as the “one and only home”, he warned that mankind’s careless behaviour towards the environment “is sending a distress call, like a patient in critical condition”. And the failure to act to preserve the environment will cause Mother Earth to “inevitably find her own way to survive with or without us”. His country is therefore willing to share its cultural heritage and traditional knowledge with the international community “as a valuable contribution to building resilience and enhancing adaptation to climate change”. He called on countries to implement integrated management of land and water resources in a coordinated manner and place special emphasis on preventing water scarcity.\nDesiring to preserve and safeguard cultural heritage and traditions associated with horses as well as their role in man’s livelihood, he announced his country’s proposal to designate 11 July as World Horse Day, a resolution which was adopted during the Plenary Meeting of the seventy-ninth session of the General Assembly on 3 June. On gender equality, he noted that Mongolia has prioritized increasing women’s participation in decision-making, with women now occupying a quarter of positions in parliament. The country is now ranked fifth place in the Asia-Pacific region and sixty-fifth globally, according to the Global Gender Gap Report 2025 by the World Economic Forum, improving by 20 places from the previous year. “We are confident that ensuring gender equality in senior leadership positions within the United Nations will undoubtedly have a positive impact on fostering more transparent, balanced, and inclusive decision-making processes,” he said.\nTurkmenistan: Serdar Berdimuhamedov, President\nSerdar Berdimuhamedov, President of Turkmenistan, said that, as a permanently neutral State that aims to cooperate with the UN to ensure international peace and security, Turkmenistan is taking practical steps to foster an atmosphere of cooperation, mutual understanding and respectful dialogue. This is the prime condition to ensure stable and sustainable development at the global and regional levels. “We are convinced that one of the most effective mechanisms for promoting and achieving these goals today is the practical application of the principles of neutrality,” he said. In this regard, Turkmenistan has initiated the inclusion of a separate agenda on “Neutrality for Peace and Security,” in the eightieth session. The Government will also propose a draft resolution on “The Role and Importance of the Policy of Neutrality in Maintaining and Strengthening International Peace, Security, and the Process of Sustainable Development”.\nAs the Assembly has proclaimed this year the International Year of Peace and Trust, Turkmenistan will host a high-level international forum dedicated to the Year of Peace and Trust, he said. To bring States’ approaches closer together on global development trends, the Government is also initiating a World Summit on the Issues of a Culture of Peace and Trust. A key objective is developing a Global Code of International Trust to lay down a universal basis for building relations between States using the principles of respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and cooperation. “We view the issues of ensuring universal peace and mutual understanding as inseparable from the civilizational aspects of modern development,” he said. Central Asia, which has played an objective role as a civilizational bridge between East and West for centuries, is “today called upon to revive its historical mission — to become a space for dialogue, cooperation and convergence of values and worldviews”, he said.\nTo consolidate the international community’s efforts to develop transport corridors that are sustainable and ensure access for all countries, Turkmenistan will submit a draft resolution to proclaim the 2026-2035 period the United Nations Decade for Sustainable Transport. It will also submit a draft resolution on “The Key Role of Reliable and Stable Energy Connectivity in Ensuring Sustainable Development.” Another priority of development is digital transformation. “We are convinced that this process must be balanced, reflect the realities and legitimate interests of all States, including the developing world, and be free from politicization and bias,” he said. Turkmenistan will propose an initiative to establish a World Platform on Digital Integration. This will be based on the principles of equality, trust and inadmissibility of using information and communication technologies to the detriment of peace, security and sustainable development.\nDuring this session, Turkmenistan will continue its work on environmental and climates issues, such as promoting the Caspian Environmental Initiative proposed at the Assembly’s seventy-eighth session, he said. Turkmenistan always measures and correlates all its international steps, initiatives and long-term goals with the United Nations Charter. Cooperation with the UN is a strategic priority. “We say this with the conviction that the UN is the only international organization endowed with universal legitimacy,” he said. “In this capacity, it must remain the guarantor of peace and development, the framework of security and resilience of the global architecture.” On behalf of all the country’s people, he thanked the Member States and international community for the December 1995 decision to recognize the country’s permanent neutrality, confirmed by two subsequent Assembly resolutions. “Turkmenistan will always remember the trust placed in it and will firmly and impeccably follow its international obligations,” he said.\nChile: Gabriel Boric Font, President\nGabriel Boric Font, President of Chile, describing history as “the continuation of a utopian voyage”, said that world leaders have the power to say “enough” if fundamental values cannot be invoked. Diversity of opinion must be respected, “but at the same time, I face the fact that people lie — and what is more outrageous is that they know they are lying”. To say there is no such thing as global warming is not an opinion, but a lie, he said, adding that the Holocaust cannot be denied, nor can it be said that vaccines cause autism.\nLies and silence will bring the peoples of the world to the abyss, he continued, noting that the United Nations was founded to ensure a real dialogue between people with different visions of the world. Recalling a meeting earlier this year of several South American leaders on ways to defend democracy, he said that it is not enough to simply point out what is wrong to the world. Rather, fresh ideas must be proposed and championed.\nDescribing Chile as a tricontinental country with inextricable ties to the ocean, he recalled that it was the first State in the Americas, and the second in the world, to ratify the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction, also known as the BBNJ Treaty. He reiterated Chile’s offer to host that instrument’s Secretariat in Valparaiso, adding that Antarctica’s natural resources must not be exploited without appropriate preservation measures.\nHe went on to officially nominate Michelle Bachelet as the next Secretary-General of the United Nations. Never in its eighty-year history has the Organization had a woman as Secretary-General, and that is something that needs to be remedied, he said, adding that it is also Latin America’s turn to fill the post. Having a woman at the helm of the UN would send a clear signal that nowhere is closed off to women, he said, emphasizing that Mrs. Bachelet — a two-time President of Chile and former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights — can build bridges between East and West as well as North and South with her proven ability to make decisions and act. Under her leadership, the United Nations can restore its credibility and sense of purpose to become a place of hope for the world, he said.\nTajikistan: Emomali Rahmon, President\nEmomali Rahmon, President of Tajikistan, said his country’s National Development Strategy 2030 is fully aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, but “unfortunately, developing countries, particularly those mountainous and landlocked, face multiple challenges and difficulties in achieving these goals.” Despite significant attempts in this field, the amount of funding for sustainable development offered by the international community continues to be insufficient, he said, calling for the allocation of additional funds and a review of approaches to the international financial system.\nStressing the need for effective and fair reforms of international financial instruments, he said that “many developing and least developed countries remain vulnerable to the impacts of economic and financial crises, poverty, infectious diseases, including COVID-19, natural disasters and food insecurity.” It is vital to implement effective financial support measures, including debt relief, he said, adding: “Now is the high time to seriously consider this important item.”\nTajikistan, with 93 per cent of its land covered by mountains, is deeply concerned about climate change, he said, adding that changes in the hydrological cycle, a series of floods and droughts, and severe dust storms over the past decades have had a direct impact on its water and energy resources and food security. “The impacts of climate change and rising temperatures have led to the accelerated melting of glaciers and the deterioration of marine and ocean ecosystems.” The High-Level International Conference on Glaciers’ Preservation this summer in Dushanbe brought the international community together to intensely deliberate on issues related to the cryosphere. “Of Tajikistan's 14,000 glaciers, which are one of the region's main sources of drinking water, more than 1,300 have completely melted, and the rate of melting is accelerating.” Therefore, his country plays a proactive role in water diplomacy.\nEmphasizing the need for strict adherence to international law, he proposed that the General Assembly consider proclaiming an International Year of Legal Literacy. The rapid adoption of digital technologies and effective use of artificial intelligence can noticeably contribute to development, he said, highlighting the Assembly resolution, adopted in July — proposed by his country — regarding the role of artificial intelligence in creating new opportunities for sustainable development in Central Asia. The establishment of a Regional Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Dushanbe would undoubtedly facilitate an implementation of joint initiatives and projects among Central Asian countries in the field of artificial intelligence. “Cybersecurity must be an important component of collective security,” he said, calling for the “expansion of international cooperation on global security within the framework of the Dushanbe Counter-Terrorism Process”.\nReaffirming support for ensuring peace, stability and socio-economic development in neighboring Afghanistan, he called on the international community to provide human assistance, especially for regions affected by drought and severe earthquakes in that country.\nAlso voicing support for comprehensive reform of the United Nations system within the framework of the \"UN80 Initiative\", \"UN 2.0”, and the Secretary-General's \"Vision for a Modernized United Nations\", he welcomed the \"Pact for the Future\" as an important collective initiative. Reiterating the need to strengthen the key coordinating role of the United Nations, he said: “Only with trust, cooperation and unwavering determination we can build a just, peaceful, and sustainable future for all humanity.”\nLebanon: Joseph Aoun, President\nJoseph Aoun, President of Lebanon, said: “I stand before you today talking about peace, development and human rights, while some of my fellow citizens face death on a daily basis, parts of my country remain under occupation and my homeland and my people live in persistent uncertainty.” His country's journey and lessons from his region demonstrate that there can be no development without peace, no growth within chaos and no prosperity amid conflicts, he said. But there can be no peace without justice, he said, adding that human rights is an essential component of peace.\nAmidst the global clash over religious identities, “Lebanon stands out as a nation where Christians and Muslims coexist under a constitution that guarantees equitable representation to both communities,” he said. Citing the late Pope John Paul II who observed that “Lebanon is more than a country, it is a message of freedom and plurality for the East and the West,” he said that in a region where people kill and get killed over their religious beliefs, his country stands out as a unique and irreplaceable model — “a model that allowed me, as an Arab Lebanese, to serve as the only Christian Head of State from East Asia to the coasts of Europe”.\nThere is a human obligation to preserve Lebanon “because if this model of coexistence falls, where else around the world can we replicate this experience” he asked. Many of the causes of the war on Lebanon aim to dismantle its unique model and perpetuate the idea of an Orient mired in perpetual ethnic rivalries. Therefore, the international community must take a firm stand to liberate all of his country’s territory and secure the exclusive sovereignty of its State. In that regard, he recalled the declaration of 27 November 2024 — adopted with the support of the United States, France and the United Nations — which espouses the will of the Lebanese people.\nHe also highlighted the exceptional character of the Lebanese diaspora, whose members visit home each year in an amount equivalent to one-third of the country's residents. Turning to his country's programme of financial and economic recovery, he pointed to its efforts to restructure the banking sector, modernize the administration and fight corruption. Legislative and institutional reforms have been launched to enhance the independence of regulatory bodies and the judiciary. The country is dedicated to investing in quality education, especially in the knowledge economy.\nAt the same time, Lebanon is shouldering numerous burdens, such as persistent instability along its southern border. Calling for “the immediate cessation of Israeli aggression, the full withdrawal of occupying forces from all Lebanese territory and the release of our hostages, that we shall not forget nor leave behind”, he called for the comprehensive implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). This will be achieved with the help of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), working in coordination with the Lebanese army. Also stressing the “moral human and political obligation” to put an immediate end to the devastation in Gaza, he stressed the need to revive a new political track, based on the principle of the two-State solution.\nAlso stressing the importance of the dignified and safe return of Syrian citizens in his country, as well as the restoration of the special relations between Lebanon and Syria, he said the UN and Syrian authorities must address this “unprecedented displacement situation”. Through direct negotiations and with the support of Saudi Arabia, Lebanon aims to reach comprehensive agreements with Syria on a range of issues.\nHighlighting the importance of reconstructing his country following the Israeli aggression, he said it is necessary to rebuild infrastructure in the Lebanese border towns and rebuild bulldozed homes and villages. “Lebanon does not seek special privileges or favours,” he said, calling on the international community to act with responsibility and fairness. “For the sake of peace in our region and for the good of humanity”, the international community must stand with his country.\n“Do not forsake Lebanon,” he appealed.\nFrance: Emmanuel Macron, President\nEmmanuel Macron, President of France, said that, after eighty years of serving peace, development and human rights, “we need to take stock of our progress and ensure that we keep pace with today’s world.” As questions arise about the promise, benefits and utility of the United Nations, we must “not kid ourselves” that this eightieth anniversary is a fact to just accept, he said, adding that international, national and state conflicts are proliferating, as are criminal and terrorist activities, while the Geneva conventions are deliberately trampled upon “as if war was just about terror, revenge and victory”. He observed that while “alarm bells are ringing out loud”, hope is not extinguished, as a lack of hope did not prevent the Syrian Arab Republic from freeing itself from war. In the same vein, Ukraine is staying the course, and peace is possible in the Great Lakes regions. “The world’s complexities are not a reason to throw in the towel on our principles and ambitions,” he said.\nHe further asserted that the United Nations cannot be replaced, expressing regret that its harshest critics are the same persons who want to change the rule of the game to exert domination, not wanting the common good to prevail. “We don’t want to see ‘might is right’ prevail” or the “selfishness of some people win the day”, he said, urging respectful relations between peers to achieve peace, address climate change, have a successful digital transformation and fight against military proliferation. “It is for this reason that, 80 years later, our priority is to really find the crux of effective multilateralism,” he stressed. There is therefore a need to consolidate existing rules and institutions that guarantee collective authority and effectiveness as well as a respect for international humanitarian law. He urged nations to support the International Criminal Court in its fight against impunity and implementation of the orders of the International Court of Justice, adding: “The force of law is our best chance in stopping the rule of ‘might is right’ from prevailing.”\nFurther, he underscored the imperative for Ukraine to resist the Russian Federation and regain its territory, wealth, children and future, stressing that the Russian aggression is not Europe’s problem but one “which plagues us all”. He therefore welcomed the proposal by the United States’ President to gradually weaken Moscow’s economy. Turning to the New York Declaration of 22 September, which was signed by 142 countries, calling for the release of hostages, the stabilization of Gaza, the demilitarization and dismantling of Hamas and the reciprocal recognition of two States between Israel and Palestine, he urged States that have not done so to act likewise. He expressed pleasure about his country’s work with the United Nations, the United States and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), opining that “Lebanon will breathe easier when Hizbullah is weak”. He therefore announced the holding of a support conference for the reconstruction of that country and expressed support for a similar conference by Saudi Arabia to support the Lebanese Armed Forces.\nHe went on to state, “Syria must recover its unity and its sovereignty,” adding that his country is striving to ensure that it respects all components of its civil society. As for the region’s peace and the nuclear programme of Iran, he said that after opening its doors to the International Atomic Energy Agency to conduct inspections, Tehran must go back to the path of peace or face sanctions. He also called for a mobilization to address the humanitarian situation in Sudan and uphold the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, adding: “We cannot forget any of these conflicts. We have no right at any time to lose heart.”\nKyrgyzstan: Sadyr Zhaparov, President\nSadyr Zhaparov, President of Kyrgyzstan, said he was speaking from the rostrum not only as a head of State, but as an ordinary citizen of his country, expressing his true opinion and thoughts on international events. “I have decided to speak openly and directly about the problems that trouble the hearts of millions of people,” he said. Around the world, new armed conflicts and wars are breaking out and millions of people are losing their homes and forced to leave their native lands. “Who suffers the most? First of all - ordinary people,” he said, adding that the world community applies double standards by prioritizing conflicts as \"this is more important, and that is less important\", as it accounts for its selfish geopolitical interests. Kyrgyzstan is suffering from the consequences of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, as unilateral sanctions negatively impact a country working to independently strengthen its economy.\nHe said he views unjustified sanctions as interference in the country’s internal affairs and pressure that hinders the development of its emerging economy. The sanctions imposed on Kyrgyzstan are based on false information spread by certain non-governmental organizations and dishonest people. His Government is ready to accept independent international audits to thoroughly check the activities of Kyrgyz banks. In 2024, the United Kingdom, which imposed sanctions against two Kyrgyz banks, carried out $2.2 billion in trade with the Russian Federation. “You demand to us not to cooperate with Russia, but you yourself are actively developing trade and economic ties with it,” he said. “We have far deeper economic relations with Russia than you do. Therefore, in economic terms, we cannot refuse to cooperate with Russia.” His primary duty as President is to ensure the security of the country’s citizens and improve their economic situation. “We oppose the politicization of economic cooperation and trade.”\nStressing the need to strengthen the work of UN peacekeeping, he said Kyrgyzstan has shown its sincere desire to strengthen world peace and security by sending its peacekeepers on UN missions. “The contribution of a State should not be determined by its size, but by the depth of its commitment and sincere desire for peace and solidarity,” he said, adding that his Government supports strengthening international treaties, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. “We must educate the young generation to perceive a world without nuclear weapons!” The International Day for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Awareness, initiated by Kyrgyzstan and supported by UN Member States, is an excellent platform to implement this concept. Kyrgyzstan is one of the initiators and a depository of the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia and this year it decided to sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\nTurning to multilateralism, he said the Organization “was born from the horrors of war, but is alive thanks to the belief in cooperation, dialogue and respect.” Preserving the multilateral system as a shield against anarchy and unilateral decisions is more important than ever and the Organization needs change to respond to contemporary challenges and threats. “It is also time to improve and reform the work of the UN Security Council,” he said, as its 15 members decide the fate of all States. Yet more than 60 Member States, including Kyrgyzstan, have never been elected to the Council, while some countries have been elected five or six times. To draw attention to the problems of small States, Kyrgyzstan has put forward its candidacy for a non-permanent Council membership for 2027-2028. “Every State should have the opportunity to become a member of the Security Council and contribute to maintaining peace and security in the world,” he said, asking Member States for their support.\nColombia: Gustavo Petro Urrego, President\nGustavo Petro Urego, President of Colombia, noting that this is his fourth and last Assembly statement in that post, recalled that in his first address before that body, he announced that there would likely be conflicts in Ukraine and Palestine, and suggested a peace conference. “However, those with large bombs and budgets are not seated here,” he said. Four years later, the horrific situation in Palestine did not lead him to believe that the same thing could happen in the Colombian Caribbean area, where 17 unarmed young people were killed by missiles in the open seas under the pretext of stopping drug trafficking, he said, stressing: “Perhaps a Global Stone Age has descended on mankind.” Decrying the expulsion of millions of migrants, the killing of 70,000 people in Gaza, and a lack of action against the climate crisis, he stressed: “All are linked and have the same cause: migration is an excuse for a rich, white racist society that believes it is a superior race, not realizing its leaders are leading it to an abyss, along with all of humanity.”\nHighlighting his Government’s achievements on drug trafficking, including the largest amount of cocaine seized in the country between 2023-2024, and 700 drug traffickers extradited to the United States and European Union, he said his policies, which involve substituting coca crops rather than forcing peasants to use poison to eradicate them, are more effective, unlike the violent war against drugs, which is a failure. Referring to the attack on the unarmed youths, some of whom were Colombian, he said, “Anti-drug policy is not meant to stop cocaine coming to the United States, but to dominate the people of the South as a whole.” Despite his achievements, he had been “decertified” by [United States] President Donald J. Trump, he said, “without human right, or divine right, or a sensible reason”, because his Government wanted to force tens of thousands of peasants to carry out its foreign policy, which is influenced by mafia groups in Colombia.\n“I myself denounced these politicians, paramilitaries and drug traffickers, naming them by their names in Congress when I was a senator,” he went on. “They wanted to kill me because of that. They didn’t want me to become President.” His decertification was the result of the influence of such groups, who did not want another progressive President to be elected, he said, adding: “I confiscated the highest amount of cocaine in the history of the country, and I have been decertified.” During his term, his Government stopped the increase in the rate of expansion of coca crops, dropping it to 3 per cent from former President [Iván] Duque [Márquez], when it was 43 per cent, he said, noting that the latter’s campaign was financed by a drug trafficker. “Instead, they decertify me,” he said. While the real drug traffickers live in New York or Miami, the poor young people in speed boats were trying to escape poverty, he said, condemning the killings and calling for criminal cases to be raised against United States officials, “including the utmost official, President Trump”.\nUnderscoring that his country’s policy is “not an anti-drug policy but an anti-drug trafficker policy”, he highlighted other achievements by his Government, including the lowest unemployment rate in its history, the development of agriculture by 10 per cent, and industry by 5 per cent. Turning to Gaza, he said: “Trump is an accomplice to genocide. This forum is a mute witness to a genocide.” The UN must uphold the decisions of the International Court of Justice; it should stop the genocide by a General Assembly vote; and it should establish a peacekeeping force to protect Palestinians. “Instead of Blue Helmets, who lack training, we need a powerful army of countries who do not accept genocide,” he stressed, adding: “We’ve had enough words; to use the slogan of [Venezuelan statesman and soldier Simón] Bolívar, “Freedom or death.”\nPoland: Karol Nawrocki, President\nKarol Nawrocki, President of Poland, said that the world has changed since the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine. “We were awakened from a blissful dream in which we strived for international peace and respect for international law. This dream no longer exists.” Borders have ceased to be untouchable and international law — “the compass of world order” — is treated as a suggestion rather than a rule. He described the Polish people’s solidarity with the Ukrainian nation, opening their hearts and homes to one million Ukrainian refugees while also providing Ukraine with military and diplomatic support.\n“We are at a turning point in history,” with the principle of sovereignty increasingly trampled upon, he said. Decisions taken today will have consequences for decades to come, and for the community of democratic nations, and those striving to be democratic, this is the last moment to take concrete action. In that regard, he emphasized that the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine is a test of the principles on which the UN is founded. Moscow speaks of the “root causes of the conflict”, but these are primarily ideological, as it views other nations as colonial property and justifies invasion as a historical correction, he said.\nThe violation of Poland’s borders by Russian drones on the night of 9 September was not a coincidence, he said, asserting that Poland will always respond to such acts. Noting that Poland is strengthening ties with its Bucharest Nine partners, he declared: “We do not consent to Moscow’s ruthless acts of provocation against us and other European countries.” Lasting peace cannot be built by rewarding aggression, he said, asserting that when Moscow says peace, it really means surrender. Holding the Russian Federation accountable should be a common duty, he said, underscoring Poland’s support for the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court and its endorsement of the idea of a special ad hoc tribunal to try the perpetrators of aggression. “If we want to build a community of democratic States … then we must agree that war must not pay off economically to any aggressor,” he said.\nTurning to other global challenges, he said that in the Middle East, Israel has the right to self-defence following the brutal attacks staged by Hamas in October 2023, but its actions must comply with international law and international humanitarian law. Poland supports the two-State solution and calls on the UN to take action to improve the situation. With no history as a colonial power, Poland is a reliable and trustworthy partner for Asian and African countries. He agreed with President Trump that Europe has fallen deep into “ideological madness” as seen by its migration and environmental policies and the purchase of cheap Russian gas. Describing Christians as one of the most persecuted groups in the world, he said that the human rights of all individuals, from conception to natural death, must be defended, and noted Poland’s candidacy for a seat in the Human Rights Council for the 2029-2031 period.\nMozambique: Daniel Francisco Chapo, President\nDaniel Francisco Chapo, President of Mozambique, highlighting the historic opinion of the International Court of Justice, issued on 23 July 2025, which unequivocally reaffirmed that States have binding legal obligations to protect the climate and the environment from greenhouse gas emissions, said: “This is a milestone of universal significance for countries such as Mozambique.” His country is among those that bear no historical responsibility for the climate crisis but are the hardest hit by its consequences, such as droughts, cyclones and floods. The World Court’s decision is “a call to climate justice, it's a call to global solidarity”, he said.\nThe environmental crisis is compounded by technological challenges, he pointed out. Artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies offer extraordinary opportunities but also serious risks of exclusion, social manipulation and even militarization. “As long as we do not fully understand how these models work, we cannot entrust them with critical tasks,” he stressed, advocating for “a technological and climate diplomacy” capable of regulating risk and democratizing benefits through genuine sharing of technology. Science and technology must not become factors of exclusion but rather instruments of climate justice and inclusive development. Africa can and must play an active role in defining international standards, determining research priorities and ensuring that technology innovation is always at the service of humanity, he said.\nMozambique, as an African country, has distinguished itself in promoting democracy on the continent, he said. It has been working tirelessly to facilitate a robust democratic system and holding regular and transparent elections that reflect the will of its people. “Indeed, our presence in this podium is the result of a free and transparent process,” he said. Highlighting his country’s historic commitment to dialogue and building bridges, he said this is crucial for lasting peace achieved after decades of conflict. Drawing attention to a public consultation his Government launched on 10 September, he said it will ensure that all sectors of society, regardless of their origin or economic position, will have their concerns considered. This process will not only strengthen democracy in his country but ensure that its development reflects the aspirations of all Mozambicans without exception.\n“We are proud of the progress we have made so far and we reaffirm our commitment to continue advancing as an example of democracy in Africa and of peaceful coexistence in the African continent and in the world,” he said, noting that during Mozambique’s term as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, that organ issued a presidential statement on the role of Africa in global affairs. Mozambique also contributed to the historic Council resolution 1719 (2023), which paved the way for predictable and sustainable financing for the African Union’s peace support operations. His country will keep advocating for a stronger African voice, with two permanent seats on the Security Council and greater decision-making powers in international financial institutions.\nCalling for a new global financial architecture capable of alleviating debt, mobilizing financial resources for sustainable development and climate action as well as correcting historical asymmetries, he said that without inclusive multilateralism, the United Nations “can become an assembly of shareholders dominated by the richest”. International solidarity is not an act of charity, it is an act of unity amongst allies, he reminded the Assembly, calling on the international community to “renew our spirit of solidarity”.\nViet Nam: Luong Cuong, President\nLuong Cuong, President of Viet Nam, said that, despite a multitude of challenges, the United Nations, for the past 80 years, has stood as the embodiment of humanity’s aspirations and collective commitment to peace, cooperation and development, undergirded by universal values of human rights, equality, democracy and social progress. While multilateral cooperation has helped prevent wars, build friendships, foster peace and cooperation, reduce poverty and curb diseases, “we find ourselves in a profoundly changing world, facing unprecedented acute challenges,” with local wars, conflicts, arms races, and the use or threat of force in international relations escalating at an alarming rate, he said. And because nontraditional security challenges exert heavy tolls on all countries and communities, global governance, trading and economic systems are becoming fragmented and volatile. “This is precisely the time to stand united and together promote the irreplaceable role of multilateralism and a rules-based international order, with the UN at its heart,” he stressed.\nHaving endured immense pain and losses from wars, his country treasures peace more than most, as the intertwining of the spirit of amity, compassion and altruism with Viet Nam’s national identity “forms the bedrock for us to overcome previous sufferings, mend old wounds, shelve the past, and look towards the future” for better relations with other countries, he said. Stressing that honouring “the value of peace and driving robust transformation for a sustainable future” is his country’s message for Member States, he noted that the role and primacy of international law as the cornerstone for peace and equal relations among nations must be reaffirmed. He therefore commended peace agreements between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as between Armenia and Azerbaijan. He urged the nurturing and practice of a culture of peace through trust building, dialogue and respect for differences.\nWelcoming the 22 September recognition of the State of Palestine by some countries, he called on the international community to act to end the Palestinian humanitarian crisis and on the United States to lift its embargoes against Cuba, delisting it from the state sponsors of terrorism. He underscored the need for “vigorous reforms” to better adapt to the times and respond to the world’s needs. “Viet Nam welcomes and supports efforts to reform the UN, including the UN80 initiative to build a UN 2.0 that is leaner, more coherent, effective and efficient,” he said. Further, he spotlighted two mutually reinforcing drivers that are critical to “a sweeping revolution” — the need to build sustainable development models based on digital transformation and the green transition. To maximize this “dual transformation”, countries must formulate relevant master plans, invest strongly in R&D (research and development), train high-quality human resources, and develop green technology infrastructure”, he noted.\nBecause the digital era carries in its wake an unprecedented speed, scope and depth of societal transformation alongside rising levels of poverty, unemployment and inequality, it is important to ensure a human-centred process prioritizing the eradication of poverty, provision of full and decent employment as well as social justice and inclusion. That is why his country hopes the Second World Summit for Social Development in November will deliver important outcomes and add momentum to implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, he said, adding that Viet Nam has met the Millennium Development Goals ahead of schedule. It strives to fulfil international commitments on its journey to becoming a modern, industrialized, and upper-middle-income developing country by 2030, and a developed, high-income nation by 2045.\nAngola: Joao Manuel Goncalves Lourenço, President\nJoão Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço, President of Angola, speaking also as Chairperson of the African Union, said uncertain conditions in today’s world invite Member States to “reflect on the profound meaning” of the Assembly President’s call to renew multilateralism and support the Secretary-General’s Initiative80 road map. World powers that previously played a crucial role in liberating Europe and Europeans from the clutches of Nazism and fascism and liberating Africa and Africans from South Africa’s apartheid regime, cannot act differently ”by attacking other countries, invading and annexing foreign territories, or even financing and organizing upheavals that can lead to the overthrow of legitimate Governments, as we currently witness on our own continent,” he said. “With such a dangerous precedent, no regional, continental, or global institution will henceforth have the moral authority to call to order any State to reason when it breaches principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and international law.”\nAfricans, as countries colonized for centuries, understand better than anyone the importance of peace, as they face daily struggles for food, drinking water, health, education and other essential goods. Knowing the harmful impact of insecurity and instability on development objectives, Angola has worked to resolve conflicts in the Sahel region, Sudan and the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. This latter conflict and many others are largely the consequence of Member States’ passivity “in the face of invasions of third-party territories and interference in the internal order of sovereign countries”. In the Middle East, the systematic non-compliance with relevant Security Council resolutions on the creation of the State of Palestine has perpetrated a conflict that worsens daily and seems far from resolution. The failure to guarantee the Palestinian Authority President’s presence at the Assembly “sends a highly negative signal”, as it encourages the genocide to continue with impunity.\nHe called for the unconditional lifting of the unjust and prolonged embargo against Cuba, which has gravely impacted the country’s economy and its people. Cuba, which played an important role in African peoples’ struggle to end the apartheid regime in South Africa, “cannot arbitrarily and unilaterally be considered a State sponsor of terrorism in light of the relevant United Nations resolutions”, he said. Actions by a small group of countries, incompatible with minimally acceptable global coexistence standards, lie at the origin of the unilateral sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe and Venezuela. They produce “no other result than the suffering of their populations”, he said. The Organization’s authority, whose foundations lie in the United Nations Charter and international law, must urgently be restored, “without narratives that highlight a logic of double standards”.\nIn its current form, the United Nations is the only organization with the capacity to act on behalf of all countries seeking a global consensus for peace and “with the legitimacy to call to order Member States that distort its founding principles through their conduct in the international arena”, he said. He supported Council reform, in line with the African common position enshrined in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, adopted twenty years ago. That proposal calls for two permanent seats and five non-permanent seats for Africa in an enlarged Council — one that is more representative and aligned with contemporary geopolitical reality. “Without this essential step, whose delay is increasingly unjustifiable, we cannot ensure the implementation of the Pact for the Future adopted last year, which recognized the urgent need to endow the United Nations with a more democratic and balanced Security Council,” he added. The Pact is a major opportunity to revitalize multilateralism and make it a broad-based platform to discuss sensitive contemporary issues, including financing for development and the climate challenge.\nLiberia: Joseph Nyuma Boakai, President\nJoseph Nyuma Boakai, President of Liberia, welcomed the election of his country as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the 2026-2027 term, marking its first full tenure on the Council, eighty years after the country signed the Charter [of the United Nations]. “While the nameplate during this two-year term will read ‘Liberia’, the seat, however, belongs to Africa,” he said, noting that its contributions to discussions and decisions are shaped by our hard-earned experiences in conflict resolution, as well as our successes in peacebuilding, democratic reform, political transition and governance. His delegation also plans to advocate for the continent’s fair representation on the Council, which can only be achieved through permanent representation as a key part of the organ’s reform agenda.\nAgainst the backdrop of wars, displacement, climate change — “challenges that no country can solve alone” — his country feels morally obligated to call for a renewal, rather than reversal of multilateralism. “Wars in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa remind us that peace is often fragile and must be constantly defended,” he said, voicing support for all credible mediation efforts aimed at resolving the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Liberia stands behind the common African position for the realization of the two-state solution. “We call on the international community to act together and decisively to protect civilians, hold perpetrators of atrocities accountable and strengthen mediation efforts,” he added.\nHe went on to highlight his country’s three peaceful and orderly democratic transitions since 2003, making it safer and more secure after more than thirty years of unrest, instability and destruction. On climate change, which is “not a distant threat but a present reality” to his country, with rising seas eroding its coasts and storms and heavy rains devastating communities and exacerbating food insecurity, he enumerated efforts to address it, including coastal defense projects, climate information systems for early warning systems, carbon market policies, and advancing a blue economy strategy. “But our efforts alone are not enough,” he emphasized, calling for urgent implementation of the Paris Agreement, full capitalization of the Loss and Damage Fund, and greater global investment in adaptation and mitigation. “Above all, we call for Climate Justice — those who contribute the least to this crisis should not be forced to suffer the most,” he said.\nAs well, he emphasized the need for urgent reforms to the international financial architecture to ensure fair representation, a new approach to debt servicing, and financing that supports sustainable development, given that too many developing nations spend more on debt servicing than on health or education. Turning to other measures by his country, he touched on efforts to improve governance, including through accountability and anti-corruption measures, such as asset declarations, as well as national reconciliation, by honouring the memory of victims, supporting initiatives for memorialization, and upholding commitment to justice and the rule of law. He also renewed his country’s request for international support and assistance in establishing a War and Economic Crimes Court, “which will further the Liberian people’s aspiration for national healing and reconciliation through justice”.\nDemocratic Republic of Congo: Félix-Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo, President\nFélix-Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo, President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, looked forward to his country’s turn as a non-permanent member of the Security Council in 2026-2027. “Our participation will be constructive and holistic,” with a focus on peace, security and conflict prevention and resolution. Citing the Common African Position on Security Council reform, he said Africa must hold two permanent and two non-permanent seats, with the former enjoying the same rights and obligations as the current permanent members. Africa can no longer remain in the sidelines when decisions are taken for international peace and security, he said.\nThe illegal exploitation of natural resources is a major cause of conflict, he said, urging the international community to support the independent commission of inquiry into massacres perpetrated in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. As the planet warms, marginalization grows and conflicts multiply, while international law is often flouted. “The rhetoric of war is gaining ground and we are seeing the return of old demons,” he said, pointing to the conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine, Yemen, Myanmar and Syria as well as the Democratic Republic of the Congo where, over three decades, war has become a “predatory exercise” and a “silent genocide”.\nHe commended the leadership of President Trump for paving the way to dialogue leading to the signing in Washington, D.C., of a peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. The withdrawal of Rwandan troops and an end to support for M23 are non-negotiable conditions for real peace. He called upon the UN to ensure the strict enforcement of that agreement; “otherwise, the blood of innocents will continue to flow”. Among other steps, he appealed to the General Assembly to recognize the Congolese genocide and to the United Nations to impose sanctions on perpetrators of economic crimes and genocide in the east of the country.\nHe went on to emphasize the threat to regional stability posed by terrorists and extremist groups and called on the UN to implement a variety of steps, including intelligence-sharing, combatting propaganda and extending support to victims and communities. The Paris Agreement on climate change remains crucial, he added, describing efforts his country is making to stop and reverse deforestation. The Democratic Republic of the Congo also supports the initiative to make ecocide a crime. He also emphasized financial challenges in Africa, calling for urgent reform of the international financial architecture so that developing countries can access concessional financing.\nIraq: Abdullatif Jamal Rashid, President\nAbdullatif Jamal Rashid, President of Iraq, thanked the United Nations for its role in supporting and defending the democratic system in his country, adding that Iraq has gained its rightful place in the international community and with its neighbours, as it chairs the current session of the Arab league and Group of 77 and China. It also plays effective roles in several international organizations, he said, adding: “We stand ready to play the part of the intersection between East and West.” Holding the seventh iteration of local and parliamentary elections in coming weeks, he said Iraq has “become a beacon of hope”, courtesy of the great sacrifice by the Iraqi people, with their resolve to ensure coexistence and respect for pluralism. He expressed his country’s support for the UN80 initiative, standing ready to discuss the potential hosting of United Nations regional and international headquarters in Iraq to show commitment to international cooperation and “to play our part in strengthening the UN”.\nHighlighting his Government’s victory over the threat of terrorism, he looked forward “to wiping out the last vestige of […] barbaric terrorist attacks”, being reliant on “the unity of our people and the establishment of development plans to heal the wounds of the past and pave the way for a promising future”. Noting that, even though terrorism takes on various slogans and manifestations, it is but one scourge and should therefore be countered comprehensively without distinction. Thus, the international community should implement all relevant Security Council resolutions and hold accountable funders of terrorism and those who allow transfer of terrorists. He committed to return displaced persons to their homes, particularly through reconstructing liberated areas and reassuring all components of the community, especially the victims that “this will no longer be repeated”.\nAlso, the country’s diversity will be protected so that “our citizens will remain in our country on the land of their fathers and forefathers”, he said. He further spotlighted the imperatives of pursuing sustainable socioeconomic investments by diversifying the economy and strengthening investments in capacities to pave the way for a reduction in reliance on oil, urging the international community to strike fruitful partnerships and support the recovery of stolen funds. With the first census held in many years revealing a population of 46 million and an annual growth of 1 million, Iraq is faced with both opportunities and challenges, he noted, calling for international support for his Government’s plans to provide development and address rising employment needs.\nTurning to climate change, he underscored the imperative of committing to the principle of common but differentiated responsibility, particularly in the sharing and management of the basins of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers with Türkiye and Iran, including Syria. He further called for a just end to the Palestinian situation, welcoming the international recognition of the State of Palestine. He also called for a Middle East free of nuclear weapons and underscored the territorial integrity of Syria, urging that government to respect pluralism and religious freedoms for all its components. He rejected the illicit use of its airspace in military operations between warring parties in the region and underscored full support for the peace process in Türkiye, as well as the decision by the Kurdistan Workers Party to lay down their arms. “We are not calling for sympathy, but rather partnership – a partnership to heal our land, to secure our rivers, to safeguard our security, to empower our youth and to ensure the unity of our region, instead of division,” he said.\nNauru: David W.R. Adeang M.P, President\nDavid W.R. Adeang M.P, President of Nauru, said that, as the world faces unprecedented challenges to peace and security, Nauru stands firmly against war and conflict, believing that dialogue and diplomacy must always prevail over division. “The principles enshrined in the UN Charter — peace, human rights and international cooperation — remain our guiding light,” he said. “Nauru may not have military might, but we have moral authority earned through our commitment to peaceful coexistence and multilateral solutions.” Small island developing States face a fundamental challenge — breaking cycles of dependency that constrain their growth and threaten economic sovereignty. “Nauru’s strategy is simple: Invest in our people — they are our greatest asset and the foundation of our future,” he said. “Education, healthcare and opportunity keep our communities strong, our youth engaged and our nation moving forward.” This principle guides every partnership and initiative, including its relationships with Australia and China.\nFor small island nations like Nauru, vulnerability goes far beyond income. “It’s the daily reality of disrupted supply chains, narrow economic choices, geographic isolation and the outsized impacts of crises we cannot control,” he said. Noting that conventional measures of Nauru’s national income suggest it has surpassed certain thresholds, he said income alone fails to capture the country’s fragility, such as its isolation, climate pressures and economic shocks. He commended the UN for advancing the Multidimensional Vulnerability Index, which reflects the country’s experience that vulnerability also includes exposure to shocks and capacity to respond. This week’s first Biennial Summit provides an opportunity to strengthen collaboration between the UN and multilateral institutions. Such collaboration should establish the Index as the benchmark for determining eligibility for development support, concessional finance and technical assistance.\nTurning to climate change, he said the United Nations has recognized what is self-evident to Nauru: “Climate change is not just an environmental crisis, it is a direct threat to our peace, our security and the very survival of our nation.” The International Court of Justice has issued an Advisory Opinion of profound moral and political significance, echoing the urgent warnings of the Pacific region. As COP30 approaches, small island developing States still face unacceptable barriers to climate finance. “Concrete climate action cannot be postponed any longer,” he said, adding that Nauru has placed hope in its Higher Ground Initiative, which would build climate-resilient communities on elevated land, powered by renewable energy and sustainable water systems. In addition, the Pacific Resilience Facility aims to deliver much-needed financing directly to Pacific communities on the front lines of climate change. By pooling resources and investing in local adaptation, the Facility is a new model for building lasting resilience.\nRegarding the International Seabed Authority, he said the criticisms Nauru has faced for its decisions within the Authority miss the point. The true focus should be ensuring the Authority fulfils its mandate to the common heritage of humankind. As a small island developing State and a sponsoring State for deep seabed mineral exploration, Nauru has invested significantly, through its sponsored entity, to access minerals essential to shift away from fossil fuels and advance the common heritage of humankind. Advocating consistently for robust regulations that balance responsible mineral recovery with effective environmental protection, Nauru invoked the two-year rule in good faith. It expected the multilateral system to fulfil its treaty obligations in the same spirit. “Yet, negotiations remain polarized, and the timely adoption of the regulations appears increasingly elusive,” he said. Nauru welcomes all nations’ growing recognition of seabed minerals’ importance, including United States President Trump’s recent decision to advance seabed mineral exploration and development. For Nauru, seabed minerals are more than economic diversification — “they are a pathway to resilience and a chance to contribute to global solutions”.\nJapan: Shigeru Ishiba, Prime Minister\n“We must ask whether the current United Nations is really fulfilling the role it was originally expected to play,” said the Prime Minister of Japan, Shigeru Ishiba. He pointed out that, while responsibility for the UN’s most important function — to maintain international peace and security — rests with the Security Council, “in many critical cases, the Council was unable to take the necessary decisions due to the veto power granted to the permanent members”. Highlighting “innovative mechanisms” to address this issue, including the Assembly resolution, “Uniting for Peace”, passed in 1950 to empower it to take action, and the requirement since 2022 that a permanent member of the Council who exercises the veto is requested to speak at the Assembly, he said, “Despite these efforts, the Security Council is still not functioning effectively,” adding: “Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is the most obvious example.”\nStating that the situation “shakes the very foundation of the international order”, with Council resolutions vetoed and not adopted, and Moscow’s aggression against Kyiv continuing, he said, “The veto was an unavoidable safety valve designed to prevent direct conflict between the major powers. However, the inherent limitations of the UN are clear.” In this context, he underscored the need to decisively implement Council reform, making it more representative without losing its effectiveness. Turning to the situation in Palestine, which has reached an alarming juncture undermining the foundation of the two-State solution, he condemned and called for the immediate cessation of the expansion of Israeli ground operations in Gaza, which further aggravate the dire humanitarian crisis there. “I feel strongly indignant by the statements made by senior Israeli government officials that appear to categorically reject the very notion of Palestinian state-building,” he said, adding: “For our country, the question is not whether to recognize a Palestinian state, but when.”\nTurning to the issue of nuclear weapons, with a permanent member of the Security Council “openly making nuclear threats”, he voiced concern that the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons may be lowered. Addressing calls for his country to join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapon, “as the only country to have suffered atomic bombings”, he stated that to maintain a world without nuclear war and realize a world without nuclear weapons, the Non-Proliferation Treaty is “the most effective and realistic framework” to this end. “The nuclear catastrophe our nation has experienced must never be repeated,” he said, quoting from a short Japanese poem by Shinoe Shoda, inscribed on “the Monument of the A bombed Teachers and Students of National Elementary Schools” near the epicentre of the atomic bombing in Hiroshima, which describes the grief of a teacher who was unable to protect her students from the blazing fire.\n“It is North Korea that is now challenging these efforts towards a world without nuclear weapons head-on,” he continued, urging full implementation of the numerous Council resolutions aimed at the complete denuclearization of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Also citing the issue of Japanese citizens abducted by Pyongyang, he renewed his call for dialogue, and resolving outstanding issues, in line with the Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration.\nMorocco: Aziz Akhannouch, Head of Government\nAziz Akhannouch, Head of Government of Morocco, said that globalism is facing unprecedented challenges in an era of reshuffling priorities and international dynamics. Geopolitical changes must therefore be addressed in the right way. Quoting King Mohammed VI, he said that everyone must work together to build a new global model. For the United Nations, its main task remains the same, but its tools and working methods need to be reviewed, he said, emphasizing that Morocco has always called for a multilateralism that is committed to the sovereign equality of States and respect for their territorial integrity.\nTurning to the situation in the Middle East, he called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and a return to negotiations to put a final end to the war. Humanitarian assistance must enter Gaza without conditions or restrictions, he said, emphasizing also the vital role of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and the need to implement a clear and comprehensive road map for reconstruction. The two-State solution cannot be delayed or marginalized, he said, emphasizing also the need for a defined timeframe leading to a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital and Gaza an integral part of its territory, he said.\nMorocco is committed to protecting the Aqsa Mosque compound and other holy sites, he said, adding that it also stands in solidarity with Qatar, Syria and Lebanon in the face of attacks by Israel, he said. In the same vein, peaceful solutions must be adopted to overcome disputes in Libya, Yemen, Sudan and Somalia through dialogue and consensus, with full respect for national sovereignty and territorial unity. Africa is at a crossroads, he added, quoting King Mohammed as saying that the continent must turn its challenges into opportunities, value its strength and built its future with ambition. For a long time, Africa was the prisoner of a stereotype; today it is a space for innovation, he said.\nTurning a blind eye to AI means wasting economic opportunity, but AI must be used responsibly, he said. By co-hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2030 alongside Portugal and Spain, Morocco is reaffirming its ability to take on great projects that will show “the real beautiful face of Africa” to the world. On the question of Western Sahara, he called the autonomy initiative the only realistic solution and one that enjoys growing international support. “It is high time to turn the page on this conflict” in a way that fully respects Morocco’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, he said, adding that the Sahara “is a land full of opportunity”.\nFollow our live coverage of the General Assembly here .",
