  "body_text": "I’ve been to friendly places before, where people are kind and the tradition of hospitality is so beautiful it breaks your heart. But I’ve never experienced anything like Algeria.\nWe stood on the side of the road looking out on the hills and bridges of Constantine when two women drove by. The driver rolled down her window, honked and yelled, “Welcome!”\nWe walked along the water next to the port of Algiers and two men leaned over the railing above us and shouted, “Welcome to Algeria!”\nThe sidewalks were full as we wandered through downtown. On all sides were shops with apartments in the stories above — tall double doors opening onto balconies like the rooms of Paris or New Orleans. As people passed, the occasional voice would say, “Enjoy your visit.”\nIt’s a hard country to visit. To get a visa, you must send in a long list of documents in addition to your actual passport. You need a letter of invitation from a tour company, spelling out your itinerary. And then you wait. And the Algerian consulates in New York and Washington, D.C., wait for the Ministry of Tourism to send over your name.\nThere are two Algerian consulates in the United States, and where you apply for a visa depends on the state you live in. My friends and I in South Carolina, who applied for visa at the D.C. consulate, got them quickly. As the weeks passed with no reply for my friends who applied through the New York consulate, I sat in horror that I had put us all in this situation. Days away from departure, we talked about what would happen if we had to cancel the trip.\nIn one last Hail Mary, Earl flew up to New York and spent the day in the consulate lobby until he had our passports and visas in hand.\nIt was difficult to get here. But now that we are here, it is easy. In fact, once you’ve made it in, Algeria is the easiest country for travel in Africa, as long as you avoid the disputed territories on the borders of Libya and Morocco.\nIt’s a wealthy country, with immense oil and gas reserves. The roads and infrastructure are great. The food is good. The people are welcoming and no one hassles.\nAlgerians love to chat as much as anyone in the American South. So if you speak Arabic, Tamazight or French, settle in. If you don’t, prepare to try.\nWe arrived days before the annual Nov. 1 celebration, marking the first day of the seven-year, bloody revolution that won Algeria its independence. National flags hung by the dozens over the narrow streets and were placed on every lamppost. Military ships anchored in the Bay of Algiers and covered seating was set up looking out toward the water.\nThere was a lot of security at our hotel because Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was staying there for a meeting with the Algerian prime minister. Maduro was on his way home from the BRICS Summit in Russia, a meeting of 36 countries where leaders discussed, without a solution, ideas for de-dollarization.\nKeep walking\nThe best way to see Algiers is on foot. The city is built on a hill that folds down and circles the bay. Our driver took us to the top of the city, to the entrance of the Kasbah, and we walked down the famous ancient stairs toward the Mediterranean Sea.\nA small news item from a 1959 report describes the French intention to demolish the Kasbah and replace it with modern apartments. The French authorities called it a breeding ground for disease and a refuge for the lawless. The four-paragraph article described how, just 18 months earlier, the Kasbah was sealed off by barbed wire as “French paratroopers waged a campaign against cells of nationalist insurgent bombthrowers and gunmen.”\nIn fact, it was here in the Kasbah that Algerians used their knowledge of the tiny alleys and the tight maze of buildings to beat the French. The war lasted so long and the French tactics were so brutal that international opinion turned against them, including the United States.\nThere’s a street in Constantine, Algeria, still named for John F. Kennedy in memory of the then-senator’s 1957 speech calling for the United States to recognize Algeria’s independence.\nWe stopped for mint tea on the Kasbah steps, sitting with our knees up on small stools that leaned down the hill.\nWe had three police escorts that walked with us through the Kasbah. They hung back and waited as we drank our tea.\nNext to us were the empty rooms of a roofless, crumbled building. All the buildings are connected, one wall serving two buildings. On the wall was a mural with the year 1921 — the year the MC Alger football club was formed. Kittens wander over, hoping for affection more than food.\nThe Kasbah of Algiers is a UNESCO World Heritage site, but the neighborhood has been a victim of years of war and neglect. According to a Smithsonian article, of the 1,200 traditional Ottoman-era buildings, just 680 are considered in good condition. In a generation, some preservationists worry, it is possible the entire quarter could be uninhabitable.\nWe walked into a house with a wood shop on the first floor and access granted for the rooftop view in exchange for a donation. On the wall are framed newspaper clippings and photos from people who fought during the revolution, many who died by French guillotine.\nWe continued our walk down the stairs, the sea in view between the buildings. Elaborately carved marble doorways, running red from iron oxidation. The rooftops of mosques that have been churches and synagogues and then mosques again. Laundry hung to dry from windows floors above.\nThe stairs continued until we were spit out near the port.\nInstead of calling our driver, we kept walking. We continued through shiny French-built neighborhoods full of shopping, then took the Algiers Metro, which opened in 2011, to the spectacular Hamma Botanical Garden, where part of the 1932 movie \"Tarzan\" was shot. From there, we took a cable car to the top of a hill to see the Memorial of the Martyr and its no-photos-allowed museum about the Algerian fight for independence.\nThe sun set as we looked out over the city from the height of the memorial and we were hungry from walking.\nI was told the food would not be good. I was told this is a harsh culture and that would appear in the food. I was told to bring comfort food to eat on the side, between the meals, so life would not feel so harsh.\nSo I was surprised when I took that first bite of soft couscous, with almonds, caramelized onions and roasted chicken.\nI was surprised as I ate fresh dates that are so translucent you can see the seeds when you hold them up to the light.\nWe ordered lamb, and the restaurant owner was so excited for us to have our first taste that he reached over and started cutting it off the bone, like a father for a child.\nThe roads were lined with truckbeds piled high with freshly harvested pomegranates and we ordered fresh-squeezed juice.\nThe unfamiliar\nIt takes two hours and 15 minutes to fly from Algiers to Djanet, Algeria, a tiny town in the Sahara Desert. By the time we landed, late at night, we had covered roughly the same distance from Miami to Boston. Algeria is a vast country, the largest in Africa and about a quarter of the size of the United States.\nMost of it is desert.\nI first learned about Algeria as a teenager, reading the work of Isabelle Eberhardt, who wrote passionately about her travels among the people of the desert. Her descriptions never left my imagination and eventually drew me here.\nIn Algiers, as we sipped tea in the Kasbah, one of our group asked why I wanted them all to come. What was I hoping to experience? What did I hope to show them?\nThe Sahara, I said. The desert.\nLook at any map of Africa and you see the Sahara spread across the entire north of the continent. We breathe in its dust, even at home in Charleston. It sits in our sunsets and sunrises. It is the constant reminder that we live on a shared planet.\nThe sand and the culture bleed among the pencil-drawn boundaries of maps.\nWe were there to meet and learn about the Tuareg, a semi-nomadic people who live in Algeria, Libya, Mali and Niger.\nWe stepped off the plane into a small airport where the arrival gate, baggage claim belt and passport office are in the same room. Towering men in indigo robes, white turbans and sandals milled under the fluorescent lights. Days before, I was warned that someone would take our passports and disappear behind a door. I was promised they would return.\nThe change in worlds from Algiers to Djanet was so intense, we were all disoriented and I was glad to be able to tell everyone not to worry about the sudden disappearance of our passports.\nThe baggage belt started moving and a small yellow bag with the words “MAIL” stamped on the side emerged, along with backpacks and suitcases for the few adventurous travelers. Most of the tourists to this region are Algerian, but it has also become popular among Eastern Europeans, especially travelers from Poland.\nWe collected our bags and followed the drivers we would get to know over the coming days into the parking lot to our 4x4 Toyota Land Cruisers.\nWe drove out into the darkness toward the Tasili n’Ajjer National Park, where the only light at night would be from our campfire and the stars.\nThree cups of tea\nTo the Tuaregs, the foam on the top of the tea is the key to a good cup. It shows that time was spent on the making of it. The foam is a sign of respect for the guest. It is a sign of patience. It is created by lifting one small pot of strong brewed tea high into the air and pouring it into another small pot. This is done again and again until a froth builds up.\nIt makes the tea stronger, the pouring back and forth.\nThe first cup is for “men who smoke cigarettes,” I was told. It has the astringent bite of undiluted green tea.\nThe second cup is still strong but a little weaker and sweet, and that can be enjoyed by everyone.\nThe third cup is weak and sweet, more water than tea.\nOut in the Sahara Desert of Algeria, every cup was a ritual. Some of it was universal, the art of making tea seen all over the world. Some of it was only of this place. You can learn so much by drinking tea.\nA group of lifelong friends, we had traveled together to Algeria for a trip of a lifetime. We flew more than two hours from Algiers, deep into the desert to the town of Djanet, not far from the Libya border. Tuareg drivers met us at the airport and we headed into the desert for days of tent camping and visiting cave drawings left there thousands of years ago.\nFor our first cup of tea, we sat on the ground.\nA small fire was built in the sand. The Tuareg are tea connoisseurs. The men we traveled with liked green tea from China and were constantly on the hunt in the markets for a seller with the best tea. Some sellers build up their customer base with the best tea and then try to cut it with lesser tea to maximize profits. But they are found out quickly and everyone goes in search of another seller.\nAs the water boiled, the men leaned on their elbows and talked. We drank tea throughout the day, always in this slow, relaxed way.\nThis tea was in the heat of the afternoon, under the shade of an Acacia tree. We would drink and then put mats on the ground for a nap, waiting for the heat of the day to break.\nSome of my favorite memories of the Sahara Desert are from looking up into the branches of the tree, enjoying the movement of the leaves in the breeze.\nIt takes two pots to make Tuareg tea as the water, the tea leaves and the sugar are added between the pots, heated again and poured back and forth.\nThe cups and the pots and the tea were kept in a handmade leather bag, with the patina of lots of use. I found myself admiring the bag and the carefulness of putting away glass teacups, and later, when I saw a group of Tuareg women selling leather bags on the ground near their camp, I searched out a bag as close to the tea bag as I could find. Mine was still covered in fur, made from the body of a small gazelle.\nWe sat on the ground, sipping our tea together. When we were done, the teapot was emptied and put away, and the wet green leaves of the tea extinguished the charred sticks from the small fire.\nStars of the Sahara\nWe were in the Sahara Desert, in the southeast corner of Algeria, not far from the Libyan border. We were on our backs, looking up at the stars.\nThe universe is expanding in all directions, spreading out its finite edges or letting out its infinite belly. Scientists don’t know which. The smartest minds, this year, poring over new data from the James Webb telescope, admitted that we might have misunderstood the universe. The math continues.\nThe longer we lied there, looking up, the more stars became visible. Gas and dust and light. The spiral arms of the Milky Way. Ourselves, orbiting our sun, one yellow dwarf star in one arm of one galaxy in a billion galaxies.\nOn the ground, the cooling sands of the desert against our backs, we were nine friends. Most of us were 50 years old, give or take some years, experiencing what we called “mid-life clarity.”\nAs we looked at the glow of our galaxy, we talked about our lives; what we had become and what we wanted to be. We have known each other since our early 20s. We raised each other into adulthood. Staying up late into the night in those first years, trying to answer the big questions; then scattering to disparate parts of the country in pursuit of careers and purpose, love and meaning. We try to visit every couple years and resurrect those big questions to see if anyone is closer to finding the answers.\nOur Tuareg guides, drivers and cooks sat around a small fire at our feet, leaning prone on their elbows and looking into the flames while they talked.\nOur conversations, in two different languages, didn’t interrupt each other.\nI confessed something to our group, saying it to them and to the stars overhead. They listened to every word. We had all night to talk and there was no reason to rush each other. When I was done with my confession and my question, they took turns offering advice. By the time each had spoken, I felt lighter and the weight of the thing that I had been carrying was gone.\nThen someone else confessed and we listened.\nThere’s something about talking into the stars, not looking at each other, that allows honesty. We asked questions and offered advice and laughed out of catharsis.\nThe Tuareg men added another piece of wood to the fire.\nAncient messages\nAmong the eroded sandstone cliffs and wind-whipped spires of the Tassili n’Ajjer National Park are caves and overhangs with the drawings and messages of travelers as far back as 12,000 years. UNESCO calls this the most important grouping of prehistoric cave art in the world, with 15,000 drawings and engravings telling the story of animal migration, hunting grounds, water supply and human movement.\nArcheology is usually sorting through garbage dumps, eroded walls and charred remnants of cooking fires for a hint at lives we cannot see. It’s something else entirely to see art. This is the legacy of someone trying to share knowledge, beauty and perception with someone else. This is history, told first-hand.\nThe drawings are everywhere. There are no signs or plaques to tell us how to think about it; no ropes or partitions separating us from the art. I looked closely at the drawings of cattle and giraffes, long-gone long-legged men and women walking among them. The drawings and engravings are not static, covering thousands of years, recording the changing climate, culture and animal life.\nIt’s been years, but not quite a generation, since most of the nomads moved into town. They were suffering out here as the climate changed and they could no longer feed their goats. The desert is full of camel skeletons from the prolonged drought.\nThe government offered them housing in the town of Djanet, and even though they would rather live in the desert, under the stars, the people packed up and moved. The nomads settled. The herders kept a small number of animals in town, or none at all, and started looking toward new ways.\nFresh baked bread\nThe desert is quiet, except for the flies, and the sound of wind that gathers itself and rushes by in bursts.\nWhen we visited, the Sahara was covered in a fine sprinkling of grass that gave the landscape a light green glow. The grass grew up from the sand thanks to the seven rains that fell since June. I was given that number by several people, as they marveled. It is unusual, the rain. It made the canyons flood as the surprised ground couldn’t hold it all.\nOur driver let a little air out of the tires as the sand became deeper. He moved the steering wheel back and forth slowly, just a bit, instead of driving straight on to maximize traction. We drove across sand as unmarked as fresh fallen snow.\nWe rolled down the windows and turned up the music, the trance-like, repetitive guitar and drums of the Tuareg band Tinariwen.\nWhen we reached our camp, we climbed to the top of a dune to watch the sun set over the rolling sea of shadows and edges, the brown turned to red and the crests of the dunes shined yellow to gold.\nWith what was left of the light, we pitched our tents in the bellies of the dunes and slid down the sand to the campfire.\nOne of the men took a stick and moved the small Acacia-wood fire to the side, exposing a bowl of hot ground beneath. Above the coals, he kneaded dough — wheat flour, salt and water — and shaped it into a thick, flat round.\nHe placed the dough into the hot sand and covered it with more sand and coals.\nIt was a new moon, so the darkness of the night was complete. The only light was from our small fire and the coals the man spread over the bread.\nWhile we drank a pot of tea, under the coals, the bread rose and formed a crust. The man took a stick and drew a circle in the sand and slowly revealed the bread, fully cooked. He dusted off the crust and used a little water to wash away the remaining sand.\nAs the stars gathered overhead, we sat around the fire and tore pieces off the freshly baked bread. It was warm in my hand, bubbly and soft like sourdough and not a grain of sand in it.\nI was tasting the place, the warm earth. I was tasting bread that has been made this way for thousands of years, by traders moving across the desert from city to city, leaving ochre messages on cave walls.\nLet them talk\nThe sun rose on the dunes and started to warm the inside of my tent. Through the open flap of the door, I could see the rose-colored morning reflected in the undulating sand.\nAnd I could hear voices. Three of the men in our group of friends rose early and climbed to the top of the highest dune, cups of coffee in hand, to watch the sunrise. As they looked into the distance, they began to talk about their lives. Children, spouses, jobs, the past, the future.\nAmong the three, they were longtime friends of mine, but were new to each other. I could not make out their words, but I recognized the confiding tone.\nA lot has been written lately about the crisis of male loneliness and how difficult it is for men to form close friendships after a certain age. I was afraid that if I unzipped the tent it would break the spell, and I wanted to give them the chance to talk.\nThere’s something different about this trip. The endless sand and sandstone of the Sahara, the lazy afternoons under the Acacia trees and long nights under the stars, that made us all open to each other. We spent the days talking. Cleansing our minds of private, haunting thoughts and leaving those things behind us as we walked.\nWe emerged from the desert, lighter and closer and ready for the next wave of life joys and challenges.\nOn the last day, we were ready for hot showers and soft beds and decided to forego an offer to see the roundabout road sign that points to Libya in one direction and Niger in the other. It’s a popular photo op.\nWhen we returned to Djanet, the disorientation of days ago was gone. It felt familiar.\nA long line was gathering outside a bakery, mostly men and teenage boys sent out to buy baguettes for the evening and morning meals.\nLuggage was being loaded into the Toyotas for our trip to the airport, but I wasn’t ready to leave.\nI asked my friend John Marston to take a walk, to take advantage of the last few minutes we had here.\nWe walked to the end of the sand-covered road to a tea stand, where a man was selling hard-boiled eggs, bread, wrapped triangles of Laughing Cow cheese and tea. We ordered two cups of tea, and he lifted the tea pot high above our glasses to get some foam on the top.\nWe leaned against the wall next to the tea stand and sipped our strong tea, warm in our hands. The tea seller walked across the road to get us stools so we could stay a while.\nBut just as we settled in, the Toyota pulled up to the curb. The window rolled down and we knew the slowness of the desert was behind us.",
