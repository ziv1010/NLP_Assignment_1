The full list of this year's McCormick Unsung Heroes nominees can be found here. McCormick is proud to recognize each of these student-athletes.\nDuring the ceremony, keynote speaker Kyle Hamilton, Safety for the Baltimore Ravens, engaged in an on-stage question-and-answer conversation, which was moderated by emcee Scott Garceau, sports radio personality and broadcaster, and featured questions from student-athletes in attendance. In his comments, Hamilton spoke about how he was once an Unsung Hero as well. In his high school career, Hamilton recounted being under six feet, which was undersized for his position in football and led him to contemplate quitting the team. Later, after growing several inches, he was offered a football scholarship to play at the University of Notre Dame, which led him back to the game he loved.\nMs. White, a member of the women's basketball team at Patapsco High School, worked hard to lead the team in rebounds and assists, which she knew would affect her team's overall success, despite always being told that she was an undersized Center. When a fellow student and member of the school's lacrosse team was being bullied, Ms. White took her fellow student under her wing and look out for her on and off the field, a sport she wasn't involved in. She is the true definition of an Unsung Hero.\nMr. Are, a member of the men's football team at Owings Mills High School, regularly volunteers to tutor freshmen students to help ensure their eligibility and good grades, despite adapting to a new country just a few years back. Mr. Are also spent an entire offseason practicing at the Center position, which he preferred, but selflessly volunteered to switch positions at the beginning of the season when a transfer proved to be a better fit, all to do what was in the team's best interest. He is an Unsung Hero who exemplifies unselfish play.\nFour other students were recognized with additional scholarships at this year's Unsung Heroes event. Jadah Reid from Western High School and Bernard Bolden IV from Lansdowne High School were awarded $7,500 scholarships, while Brooke Frederick from Mount de Sales Academy and Maurice Ghee from Loyola Blakefield High School both received $5,000 scholarships.
