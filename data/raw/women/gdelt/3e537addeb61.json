Every winter we think it can’t get much worse, but every winter it gets a little bit worse,” adding the health service was headed for “disaster” if flu levels continued to rise.\nWith the health service to receive over half of Stormont’s budget at £8.4bn, Mr Nesbitt said this was still not enough to balance the books and predicted a “deeply concerning” £400m shortfall caused by rising demand for services, pay and National Insurance costs.\nNurses spoke of the shocking conditions in hospital corridors, with one commenting: “I go home feeling like a terrible person.”\nA Palestinian doctor working in Belfast shared his hope that “15 months of genocide” in Gaza would end, while resident doctors ended months of strikes by accepting a 4% pay increase.\nFrom Nigeria to Coleraine, Dr Christian Oko also told the Irish News about how Irish missionaries inspired his career in medicine.\nFebruary - New children’s hospital in Belfast greenlit, at £450m over budget\nNew figures in February showed ‘a stampede for private healthcare’ in Northern Ireland, with around 6,000 patients going private for procedures like cataracts and hip replacements in 2024 - a figure that has trebled in five years.\nRetired Co Derry GP, JP McCormack, said it was “disgraceful” that patients were being forced to use their life savings to avoid “dangerous waiting lists” and warned of a lack of aftercare.\nResearch from Queen’s University showed that young adults who had childhood cancers were being denied mortgages in their 30s, with calls for a right for their diagnosis to be forgotten to avoid lifelong financial discrimination.\nThe Health Minister said extending a Westminster Bill to Northern Ireland to curb smoking and vaping was “an opportunity to save lives,” while MLAs who supported a ban on puberty blockers were told they were not welcome at pride parades in Derry and the north coast.\nA new children’s hospital in Belfast was finally greenlit at a cost of £671m. First supposed to open in 2020 at a cost of £223m, the price had shot up by nearly £450m.\nThere was also criticism that the Irish construction firm behind “the most expensive children’s hospital in the world” in Dublin had been awarded the contract along with another company.\nCharities helping vulnerable people said they were “facing a cliff edge” after the Department of Health’s core grant funding scheme was cut in half from £3.6m to £1.8m.\nIn contrast, a £215m commitment to tackle waiting lists in the Executive’s Programme for Government was described as “a welcome surprise” by Mike Nesbitt.\nMarch -Belfast woman’s ‘extreme guilt’ over being wrongly prescribed unsafe pregnancy medication\nBelfast woman Susan Jamison (59) told the Irish News of the “extreme guilt” she felt after being prescribed unsafe medication during pregnancy, which caused her children to be born with disabilities.\nAlong with thousands of other families, she was wrongly told that sodium valproate was safe and described how a decades-long wait for compensation has added to her family’s suffering.\nFigures obtained by the Irish News revealed that over 60 patients died in the care of mental health inpatient units in Northern Ireland over the last decade.\nWhile a significant number were believed to be due to suicide, the figures also showed deaths related to other health issues.\nApril - Irish firm pulls out of contract to build new Children’s Hospital in Belfast\nStormont’s new budget for 2025/26 promised “to do things differently” with £215m to tackle hospital waiting lists and a boost for childcare.\nJust weeks after being jointly awarded the contract to build the new £671m Children’s Hospital in Belfast was announced, BAM Ireland announced they were no longer taking part for commercial reasons.\nQuestions had been raised about their work on the National Children’s Hospital in Dublin, where costs had ballooned to €2.24bn.\nHealth chiefs admitted they still did not know the cause of potentially deadly bacteria in the water system of a long-delayed maternity hospital in Belfast, with MLAs questioning the Belfast Trust’s ability to manage major projects.\nNorthern Ireland’s annual medicine costs reached an all-time high of £875m, an increase of £280m in a decade, caused by the needs of an ageing population and effective but “highly expensive” new medicines.\nMay - Belfast Trust under pressure as heart surgeon bullying scandal revealed\nBelfast Trust was shaken by claims of bullying among heart surgeons at the Royal Victoria Hospital, with an independent report stating that staff feared violence would break out among senior colleagues, that the tensions were putting patients at risk and some surgeons were even working from home.\nMike Nesbitt said the revelations “brought shame on our health service” and the “toxic culture” was unlikely to be an isolated incident across Northern Ireland hospitals.\nMeanwhile, new figures highlighted that health workers in Northern Ireland suffered 90,000 physical attacks in the last decade - the equivalent of 25 attacks every single day.\nA fear of having children taken away was said to be stopping mothers in Northern Ireland accessing mental health support, while a shortage of 400 foster carers was also highlighted.\nDescribing the joys and pressures of foster care, one family told the Irish News: “No child asks to be born into these circumstances… all they’re looking for is a chance.\"\nEnniskillen woman Hazel Gray told the UK Covid Inquiry of her trauma at not being able to be with her parents George and Violet Little when they died, saying it was like they “disappeared”.\nThe head of the Northlands addiction treatment centre in Derry slammed a decision to cut £60,000 of Department of Health funding, saying that after 50 years of helping addict they should not have to “rattle a bucket every year” as drug and alcohol deaths increase.\nAs GPs voted overwhelmingly to reject a funding offer from the Department, Mike Nesbitt also revealed that a GP’s curiosity over a heart condition may have saved his life.\nHealth Minister Mike Nesbitt has credited a GP's \"professional curiosity\" with potentially saving his life by identifying a serious heart condition he was unaware of.\n— The Irish News (@irish_news) May 19, 2025\nSpeaking about his personal experience, the minister said that Northern Ireland's health service will never… pic.twitter.com/RK6FFeOnZr\nIn an interview with the Irish News, the new Commissioner for Older People Siobhan Casey spoke about growing up as the youngest of 11 siblings and Northern Ireland’s “broken” social care system.\nNewtownabbey GP, Dr Tracey Cruickshanks, told the Irish News that Mike Nesbitt was treating GPs like the “enemy” over his decision to impose a rejected contract offer, and the abuse being directed at her receptionists from patients having to call over 100 times to get an appointment.\n'Mike Nesbitt spoke in Stormont as if we are the problem. We are the potential solution, if they would just see that and stop treating us like the enemy.'\n— The Irish News (@irish_news) May 22, 2025\nDr. Tracey Cruickshanks said GPs are demoralised as Health Minister Mike Nesbitt forced through a rejected GP contract,… pic.twitter.com/s0bnktyD3n\nAppearing before the UK Covid Inquiry, First Minister Michelle O’Neill downplayed the impact of her controversial attendance at the funeral of veteran republican Bobby Storey in June 2020, stating there was no evidence this caused a drop in Covid rules compliance.\nDespite struggles over a projected £600m budget deficit, Mike Nesbitt announced that a further 26 emergency consultants would be hired in 2025 - paid for by a £30m reduced spend on locum doctors.\nJune - New £10m cross-border health fund\nA new £10m cross-border health scheme was announced, allowing patients on waiting lists for more than two years to claim back money for private operations in the Republic.\nIntended for procedures like hip and knee operations, this would later be extended to all European countries.\nPart of multiple efforts to reduce waiting lists, there was some criticism from the BMA’s Dr Alan Stout who said it would favour those with the ability to pay upfront.\n'It will favour those that can pay. And the second weakness which there's a significant amount of uncertainty about is the aftercare for patients'\n— The Irish News (@irish_news) June 4, 2025\nBelfast GP and Chair of BMA's Northern Ireland council Dr Alan Stout described Stormont's new £10m cross-border health fund as… pic.twitter.com/e51q9iryN9\nAn open letter from Co Derry GP John Diamond said that “disrespect” from the health minister was creating a push towards a private system, while west Belfast GP Michael McKenna told the Irish News that he hadn’t been able to take annual leave in five years.\nTHE BMA also accused the Department of Health of failing to protect its workforce through years of poor management, citing the GP dispute as well duty of candour proposals that could potentially criminalise health workers.\nThe front page of today’s Irish News. pic.twitter.com/Z6yk3wI8LZ\n— The Irish News (@irish_news) June 26, 2025\nCancer patients in Northern Ireland were said to be facing a “ticking time bomb” for diagnosis and treatment over a chronic shortage of doctors.\nBelfast Trust spent £30m on security in the last five years, nearly triple the cost of all other health trusts combined, with the Trust putting this down to the higher population in the city.\nThe Trust was also placed under the highest-possible level of intervention from the Department in June as the fallout from the allegations of bullying in the cardiac unit continued.\nThe frontpage of today’s Irish News pic.twitter.com/QE6fgK3mRe\n— The Irish News (@irish_news) June 20, 2025\nIt emerged that nearly 5,000 NI patients had been referred to long Covid clinics since the pandemic.\nNorth Belfast barber Jay Miller spoke about his miraculous recovery after a seizure left him in a coma for three weeks, while the former First Minister and DUP leader Peter Robinson also praised “the remarkable courage and tenacity” of his wife Iris as she battles cancer.\nA Newry midwife was struck off over social media posts claiming that vaccinations “attacked babies” while in their mother’s womb, while international health workers were left “frightened and vulnerable” after racist rioting in Ballymena spread across Northern Ireland.\nThere was further criticism of an “absolutely absurd” arson campaign in west Belfast, with calls to tackle misinformation about the health risks of 5G masts.\nMeanwhile, Northern Ireland’s Nurse of the Year Kelly Forbes told the Irish News about improving the mental health of stoic farmers and fishermen in rural Kilkeel.\nJuly - Anger at Eleventh night bonfire beside hospital power supply\nThere was outrage as a Belfast bonfire appeared on a site with asbestos and next to an electrical substation that supplied both the Royal Victoria and Belfast City Hospitals.\nPolice declared it a major incident, but ultimately said it was too much of a security risk to step in and remove the material.\nThe chair of the Belfast Trust, Ciaran Mulgrew, was sacked on the orders of the health minister. Mr Mulgrew would later claim he was being made a scapegoat over the bullying allegations involving heart surgeons.\nAn Omagh athlete who lost the ability to walk as a child credited art therapy for helping him to recover and complete a 14-hour Ironman, while a Co Down father with motor neuron disease spoke of the “agony” of being denied lifesaving treatment over staff shortages.\nThe Western Trust was criticised over a “shambolic” consultation, as a public meeting on the contested future of the South West Acute Hospital was called off, with the health minister urging the trust to “restore confidence” from the public.\nOver 1,400 looked-after children were reported missing since 2020, with the children’s commissioner telling the Irish News he was “profoundly concerned” due to the risk of criminal or sexual exploitation.\nSenior surgeon, Professor Mark Taylor, was appointed in a new dedicated role to tackle Northern Ireland’s waiting lists and called them a “national shame.”\nAt the same time, the row between the health minister and GPs in Northern Ireland deepened as they announced they were taking “collective action” over their contracts.\nAugust - Cancer deaths up 11% in a decade\nA total of 45,000 people died from cancer in Northern Ireland between 2013-22, a rise of 11%, and representing 10 times the number of lives lost during the Troubles.\nWhile much of this is due to an ageing population, the risk of dying from the disease also fell dramatically thanks to medical advances.\nFormer senator Máiríá Cahill told the Irish News about enduring a 49-hour wait in the Royal Victoria Hospital’s A&E Department, adding: “When a surgeon says to you ‘this is Northern Ireland, I am not a politician,’ you know you have a problem.”\nIn a platform piece for the Irish News, Dr Tom Black condemned the state of Northern Ireland’s health service, saying “we wouldn’t accept it for our pets” and “no one has a plan to fix it.”\nMeanwhile, black market weight loss jabs being sold on social media pages like Instagram were putting people in hospital but with few prosecutions.\nSeptember - The surgeon with the saw\nSeptember began with an announcement that £215m of funding dedicated to reduce waiting lists was having an effect, with nearly 60,000 extra treatments, assessments and diagnostic tests.\nWith an estimated 500,000 people still on waiting lists, the health minister called it “early steps” but proof that “investment can change lives.”\nGiven the urgency, the new waiting list tsar put all subtlety aside when he appeared onstage with a rusty saw to to cut the “colossal” backlog down to size.\nSpeaking to the Irish News afterwards, Professor Mark Taylor said it was time to get tough on waiting list patients failing to show up for appointments with a “two strikes and you’re out” policy.\n“That’s really harsh and not where we want to be.
