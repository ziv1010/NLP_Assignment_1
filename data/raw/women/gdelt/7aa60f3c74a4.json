  "body_text": "Vera Pauw is the manager who led the Republic of Ireland women’s national team to their first World Cup this summer — which makes it no surprise the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) came close to extending her time in charge.\nBut during the team’s final camp preparing for the World Cup and following the release of The Athletic’s investigation into Pauw’s conduct during her time in charge of National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) team Houston Dash in 2018, contract renewal discussions were placed on hold. Pauw has now left her post after a review of the World Cup campaign led by FAI director of football Marc Canham.\nAdvertisement\nPauw denies the allegations in The Athletic report, which included that she “created a culture of fear” and would comment on her players’ weight and appearance. The claims had first been made in an extensive report by the NWSL and its players’ union, published last December, into abuse and misconduct across the top domestic league in the United States.\nThe Dutch coach, whose contract was not renewed before it expired on September 1, gave an interview to Irish broadcaster RTE to present her side of the story. In doing so, she levelled several claims at the FAI.\nCanham has been in the role for a year but had not yet spoken to the media. On Thursday at FAI headquarters in the Abbotstown district of Dublin, he appeared alongside FAI chief executive Jonathan Hill to address the situation. Hill read through a prepared statement.\n“We wish Vera Pauw well and thank her for all she has done,” Hill said, before taking questions from the media. “We recognise and acknowledge her considerable achievements with this team. There was absolutely no interference in the technical affairs of this team, we did not present a formal contract offer pre the World Cup, we did conduct a full and thorough review of the campaign, the outcome of which was not predetermined.”\nHow did the FAI reach its decision?\nThe FAI completed an internal review of their team’s Women’s World Cup campaign soon after returning home from the tournament in Australia and New Zealand, where they exited at the group stage having taken one point from the three games against Australia, Canada and Nigeria. It was led by Canham, who conducted one-on-one interviews with over 30 members of staff — including players and wider personnel.\n“The ultimate decision reached was one based on a range of things, not any one in particular but all evidence based upon the review process,” Hill said.\nAdvertisement\nThe chief executive was unwilling to put a number on the exact number of players who were interviewed but told The Athletic: “It was a good section of players. It was ones who were available and wanted to talk to us.” Hill also said Pauw was spoken to twice at length during the process, with Canham later saying she was the first person they consulted.\nThe findings were presented to the FAI board at a meeting on August 29. Both Canham and Hill made a recommendation to the board members not to renew Pauw’s contract.\n“My recommendation and that of Marc’s and the board was not to offer a new contract and that a fresh approach was needed to take the team forward and to align with our long-term vision,” said Hill.\nAfter hours of deliberating, the decision to part ways with 60-year-old Pauw was agreed upon.\n“The outcome of this review was not predetermined, as has been suggested, nor was it designed in any way to be a critical review of the manager herself,” Hill said. “It was simply about reflecting on the World Cup campaign in its entirety and establishing what is best for this team and for women’s and girls’ football going forward.”\nWhen asked by The Athletic whether he thought the players might have felt more comfortable if this process had been conducted by an independent third party, Canham said: “I’ve been around the camp since I joined in August last year. I’ve had positive relations with all of the staff and players. We’ve had positive feedback from players and staff around our presence in the camp.\n“It was an internal review, it wasn’t anything other than that. It was absolutely appropriate, with my responsibilities as director of football across men’s and women’s football, to conduct that review.”\nHave Ireland’s players spoken about Pauw publicly?\nThe content of the interviews which took place during the review period will remain confidential.\nAs for what players said during the summer, there is not too much to go on.\nAdvertisement\nAhead of a pre-World Cup warm-up game against France in Dublin, team captain Katie McCabe sat alongside Pauw for a press conference which ultimately centred on the re-emergence of allegations against the manager following The Athletic’s report. McCabe called it an unwanted distraction to the team’s preparations.\nThere has been little to nothing said from a players’ perspective since their tournament concluded with a goalless draw against Nigeria in Brisbane on July 31.\nMeanwhile, Pauw has claimed players had been instructed not to discuss her future during the World Cup. Hill and Canham both denied the players had been given such a briefing.\n“All players to a degree, and Vera, and people in this sporting sphere, are briefed by the likes of (communications director) Gareth (Maher), who works closely with the women’s team. I think the players just felt, genuinely, what was happening in relation to the review was the FAI’s decision,” Hill said. “They knew Marc was running the review and they wanted to concentrate on the tournament.”\nHill was then asked whether the players are free to express their opinions.\n“We will not curtail anybody who wants to talk about a specific topic,” he said.\nWhy did the FAI change its mind on offering Pauw a new contract?\n“In relation to contract negotiations, it’s important to stress that at no point was a contract offer ever presented to Vera or to Vera Pauw’s representative or put in front of the FAI board for consideration,” Hill said.\n“It is correct to say that the FAI and myself had been open to exploring a potential contract extension with Vera. Although to be clear, in both December of last year and in January of this year it was mutually agreed between myself and Vera the focus should be solely on World Cup preparation and not on contract discussions.\nAdvertisement\n“In March, however, Vera indicated that she was happy to start discussions on a new contract if the FAI was, following which, initial informal conversations were had with Vera and thereafter with her representative, Ciaran Medlar. Those informal conversations did not progress to the point where a formal offer was presented either to Vera or Ciaran Medlar.”\nBefore the World Cup kicked off on July 20, those talks were paused.\n“The team was fully in camp and it was an intense period of pre-tournament preparation,” Hill said. “Around this time, certain things happened which did have an impact on those preparations which of course were not ideal, including the resurfacing of the NWSL allegations through The Athletic article.\n“As such, we believe that it was not appropriate to offer a new contract at this point, to double down on concentrating on the tournament immediately ahead of us all and to assess everything after the tournament.”\nHill went on to say: “It was clear from discussions with Vera that she was not going to change her fundamental approach (to coaching). Marc has a strong vision, which I support, for our women’s and men’s teams at all levels. It is based on a clear and consistent approach in terms of how we play, how we train, how we support our teams, and the type of management and environment we need to deliver on this. This is the long-term vision and where we want to get to.”\nThe Republic of Ireland, he said, decided to “go in a different direction.”\nWhat about the FAI review led to Pauw’s exit, and what was its response to the NWSL report?\n“There are some high-level themes in relation to football matters in particular, which emerge from the (FAI) reports, including training methods, and the style and nature of sessions and approaches to fitness and conditioning,” Hill said.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s important to stress that we’re not here to criticise the manager’s approach in any of these areas. Vera believed her approach to core areas such as these was absolutely the right one, and indeed one she has adhered to across her entire career. And we’re not doubting that conviction, nor indeed her beliefs. But we do feel it is important to recognise that in professional football as in the world of sport, there are always disagreements, and at times subsequent tension around style and preparation.\n“The manager had her views and believed in her approach. A number of players, and indeed Marc, simply had a different position.”\nAsked whether the FAI was happy with its response to the NWSL report’s emergence and its support for Pauw at that time, Hill said: “(FAI chairman) Roy (Barrett) in particular spoke to Vera in relation to the report that was published and we had a very clear view on the report and the review and the way it had been conducted.\n“I said earlier in relation to all of the allegations, I think two pages of a 160-page document that were related to Vera were anonymised and unsubstantiated. I think Roy in particular felt the process that led to that report and the way in which Vera was interviewed et cetera was very unfair on Vera. We took the view at that point that we were supportive of Vera.”\nPauw claimed “FAI management” had asked her if she had been vetted by the Garda (the Irish police).\nHill said: “She was Garda vetted, and all staff and all coaches within the FAI are Garda vetted. I’m slightly confused about that in relation to where it came from.”\nHe denied Pauw had been asked the question on behalf of the FAI but said there may have been some confusion regarding an email that was sent to her.\nWho will replace Pauw as head coach?\nEileen Gleeson, director of women’s and girls’ football at the FAI, is currently in charge of the national team for the upcoming Nations League games against Northern Ireland in Dublin next Saturday and away to Hungary three days later.\nAdvertisement\nIt is intended she will step down at the end of her run as interim head coach. Canham is hoping their “global search” will be concluded when the Nations League run of games ends with the reverse fixture away to Northern Ireland on December 5.\nThe process to find a permanent replacement for Pauw has been ongoing since her departure. The FAI has been consulting with external parties to ensure the search ends with the candidate who most suits their “clear vision” being selected, but Canham said the FAI will take charge of the decision.\n(Top photo: Bradley Kanaris/Getty Images)",
