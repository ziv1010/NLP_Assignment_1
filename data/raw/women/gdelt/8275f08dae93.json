  "body_text": "Alessia Russo has a pretty good idea about which manicure to have later. “A lot of the girls are getting red. I’m not being superstitious but,” she pauses, holding out her nails. “I never normally get red.”\nIt’s late morning on a sunny Wednesday in May and the genteel folk of Harpenden are pottering around the town’s leafy high street like it’s a Sunday afternoon. Arsenal manager Renée Slegers has given the team the day off “for pampering” so Russo, thrilled, suggests meeting up at one of her favourite coffee spots ahead of a few treatments she has booked in. It’s a cute Italian place with a little deli next door, and the weather is warm enough for a) us to risk sitting outside and b) Russo to dress down in a black Adidas tank top and stonewashed Levi’s.\nAs her oatmilk latte arrives she quickly checks her phone. “Sorry, my brother [Luca] and his wife are about to have a baby,” she says, leaning in to show me a photo of her older sibling horizontal on a maternity ward bed. “So it’s a big week in my family.”\nHer part of that big week is in three days’ time, where Russo will be gunning to be on the right side of another bit of history in the Women’s Champions League final. Having expertly led the line in Europe with seven goals, Arsenal are one step away from repeating a feat only the club’s own 2007 quadruple-winning team achieved. A world-class Barcelona side, winners of three of the past four finals, stand in their way.\n“A lot of us have been talking about whether this is the biggest game of our careers,” she says. “I've been fortunate enough to be part of a Euros final [she came on in the 56th minute of that historic 2-1 victory over Germany at Wembley in 2022] and part of a World Cup final [she was substituted at halftime in the 1-0 defeat to Spain in 2023], but this one does feel extra special.”\nYesterday, Vic Akers, the manager who led Arsenal to win the quadruple, Alex Scott, Lianne Sanderson and Rachel Yankee all came in for lunch at training. “They know what it takes to get there,” says Russo. “We wanted to win more [trophies this season] but we've got the opportunity to win the biggest prize of all in club football, so it feels very exciting.”\nOn a personal level, the stakes for Russo are higher than ever. In 2022, her Puskas-nominated back-heel in the Euros semi-final against Sweden somewhat inflated her involvement; super-sub status shot her to fame but in reality she went into the tournament not even knowing if she’d be in the squad.\nThen, in 2023, Russo’s transfer from Manchester United to Arsenal made her one of the most expensive female footballers on the planet. This season she’s proven that worth by bagging the WSL Golden Boot (sharing it with Manchester City’s Khadija Shaw), scoring 12 goals to help Arsenal finish second below an unbeaten Chelsea.\nToday she is England’s – and Arsenal’s – starting number nine. The expectation is for her to be scoring goals consistently, and in big games. That’s something that has taken a bit of getting used to. “I don't necessarily feel pressure but you have to be very confident and self aware that if a chance comes, you're going to score it. I've spoken to a lot of players and they're like, ‘You're the number nine, this is what you need to demand.’”\nFormer England and Manchester United teammate Mary Earps knows better than most the upward trajectory Russo is on, and the challenges that come with it. “Sport is such a competitive world. It can be very dog-eat-dog, so it's rare to find someone as genuine and kind-hearted as she is in the world in general, but it's even rarer in football,” Earps tells me, via voice note. “She's one of the best strikers in the world right now and that will continue to be the case. She deserves all the plaudits she's getting – the levels she's hitting now are phenomenal, but I know she's capable of even higher levels of greatness.”\nEarps echoes what Slegers said of her star striker in May: “There are still things she wants to do better, so that's the exciting part with Alessia. She's on such a high level already and has the mindset and potential to become even better.”\nA couple of tables away, two dogs are squaring up to each other à la Hugh Grant and Colin Firth in Bridget Jones’s Diary. A cavapoo is yapping at a black Portuguese Water Dog. Peak English apologies ensue from the two owners, both mortified for disturbing the peace. Russo watches on in full blush heart emoji mode.\n“I really want a dog but Mum and Dad won't let me. Sounds like I'm about 12,” she laughs, post-commotion. “I just don't have enough time to commit to one, so I know I’d need their help.”\nOver the years, her parents’ support has extended well beyond prospective doggy daycare. Mother Carol is Russo’s rock (“Definitely the most caring, affectionate, special person ever, she has instilled in me a lot of how I am as a person”) and she refers to her father, Mario, as both her biggest fan and the person who taught her 90 per cent of her football values.\nMario was a police officer for 30 years, and she remembers his working hours were notoriously crazy when she was younger. “No matter whether he’d been up at stupid o'clock, he’d always come home and drive me to training, be it Charlton or Chelsea, three or four times a week, no complaints,” she says, her gratitude palpable. “I used to have dinner in the car and do a lot of my homework on the M25.”\nMario’s car service isn’t the only thing Russo’s dad blessed her with growing up; she’s inherited his striker's instinct: he remains the record goalscorer for non-league Metropolitan Police FC. “He won't ever let me forget that,” she smiles, rolling her eyes. Her description of his playing style sounds as familiar as it is formative: “He was a proper workhorse and used to create things on his own and score as much as he could by just getting on the end of things.”\nAs Russo’s passion for football grew, Saturday afternoons spent watching Charlton Women became more frequent. “There weren't many people there, but Dad made a special effort to take me to women's games because he knew I wanted to be there, and I could see myself being in that role later in life.” Then there was the women’s final at the London 2012 Olympic Games. “That sticks out to me because seeing the girls playing in such a big game at a stadium like Wembley spurred me on.”\nAnother chunk of Russo’s footballing values can be attributed to her brothers, Luca and Giorgio. “Playing in the garden, most of the time I got shoved in goal and had balls booted at me. They called it toughening me up,” she says. There is no one in the world Russo is more competitive with (“Brothers get under your skin more than anyone; you want to beat them so much!”), so perhaps we have them to thank for the tenacity and strength she shows for Arsenal and the Lionesses.\nRusso played the majority of her youth football at Chelsea’s academy and reckons the exposure to the first team aged 16 (“I saw Millie Bright and Fran Kirby training at the highest level”) was when she knew that there was a chance it could turn into a job if she worked hard enough. As the prospect of a career in football started to feel like a possibility, Russo made a decision that would shape her future: travelling to the US for college at the University of North Carolina.\n“I felt like I needed to mature and grow up and learn different things,” says Russo of her stint at North Carolina Tar Heels. “Luca was out there and I could see how elite sports was over there and the amazing facilities. I just threw myself into it, and never really looked back.”\nIn North Carolina, her roommate was Lotte Wubben-Moy – now her Arsenal and Lionesses teammate. “I was more fun and laidback, and Lotte was definitely the big sister, she kept me on the straight and narrow,” says Russo. “We were pretty much inseparable.”\nAt the time, USA were the dominant force in women’s football so anything Russo picked up from her time Stateside felt significant. “They were definitely very self aware and self confident,” she remembers. “It wasn't arrogance, it was more like, I've worked hard and deserve this.”\nThe next time we speak, Russo is in the Lionesses camp, about to jump on the bus to Wembley for England’s Nations League game against Portugal. “Best weekend ever!” she beams down the phone, looking over her shoulder to see if any of her teammates are listening in.\nWhat colour nails did you go for in the end? “Haha, just pink,” she says, “I was manifesting a baby girl and I also wanted to keep to my usual.”\nSince our cafe meet, a fair bit has happened. Arsenal won the Champions League. An afterparty in Porto ensued, followed by an unforgettable victory parade in N5 (we’ve all seen the Katie McCabe videos). Oh, and Russo’s niece – a girl – arrived the day before the final, on 23 May.\n“23 is a massive number in our family. I wear 23 for Arsenal [Russo loves Michael Jordan] and Mum and Dad got married on 23 July, so when baby Rosa was born on the 23rd, I just thought, This is meant to be, the stars have aligned and we’re going to win,” she says, still unsure whether she’s actually processed that achievement. “After we got off the flight home, I went back to mine, walked through the door and just sat down for a while. I thought, Wow, what have we done? It’s a trophy I've always dreamed about winning, and now I have.”\nIn the second minute of stoppage time, with the Gunners within touching distance of an historic victory thanks to a goal from Stina Blackstenius in the 74th minute, Russo, who had been a nuisance to Barcelona’s defence all match and led the line valiantly in the Porto heat, looked over to the dugout to see her number was up. No 23 off, making way for No 3, her former roommate, Wubben-Moy.\nLeaving the pitch to rapturous applause, Russo and Wubben-Moy smiled and shared the kind of full circle moment a documentary could be based around. “Knowing how much Arsenal means to Lotte and how much of a part she's played in getting this club back where it belongs, that was really nice,” says Russo. “I’ve gone through my biggest highs and biggest lows with her because we've been friends for so long, so to share that moment with her was special.”\nAnother famous No 23, David Beckham, was among those to send DMs of good luck and congratulations. “There were lots of really cool messages that the girls got, which just shows how far this game reached, and how aware people were of it,” she says. One text she always looks out for is from her dad, who messages her, without fail, before every match. He sends the crest of the team his daughter is playing against with a few things to focus on in the game and an inspirational quote or video.\nAmid all the post-match celebrations, it makes seeing Russo’s winners’ medal draped around Mario’s neck in her Instagram post all the more fitting. “My two top priorities in life are family and football, so to have them there to celebrate was so, so special. They came on the pitch then we had a big party. To get to enjoy that high with them makes it even better,” she says. “Coming from the family I've come from definitely makes me want to have my own family one day.”\nHaving added a Champions League medal to her Football Writers Association Player of the Year gong, if Russo has a good Euro 2025 for England, surely she’s in the running for the Ballon d’Or too? “There's no greater feeling than winning trophies as a team. If that means individual ones come along the way, then great,” she says.\nIndeed, now attention quickly turns to England and Euro 2025. “I always love coming into camp, the focus switches,” she says. The squad is in great spirits despite the media’s best efforts to suggest otherwise. When we speak, the news of Earps’ retirement has just broken and all Russo has is love and respect for a player she describes as a best friend. “Mary taught me so much about the passion that it takes to play for England.”\nThe passion is driven by Russo’s desire to add to their Euro 2022 win. “We're all very excited to get going again,” she adds. “Hopefully we can go out and make history.”\nApart from goals – she’s scored 22 in 50 appearances for England under Sarina Wiegman – I ask Russo what else she feels she brings to the squad. “Monopoly deal!” she says. “And I’m probably the one that's positive, so if anyone needs a chat, I'm always there.”\nEarps agrees: “When you're going through a tough moment, she's really able to see the positives in life and helps you frame things and get perspective in a really Alessia Russo way.”\nEuro 2025 in Switzerland will be the third tournament in a row where besties Russo and Ella Toone have been selected together. Toone has needed Russo’s positivity more than ever this season after the passing of her father last September. “Seeing Tooney go through something like that was just heartbreaking,” says Russo. “She's handled herself with so much class and professionalism and how she has still played and performed is just incredible to see.”\nThe pair’s podcast, The Tooney and Russo Show with Vick Hope, was “something we had always wanted to do ever since we were 13 or 14”, and the second series goes a long way to show the kind of bonds that exist in the England set-up going into a major tournament. “Me and Less go way beyond football, I think of her as a sister,” Toone says. “She was the first person I rang [when my father passed away] and she drove straight up from London to Manchester. That just goes to show what type of friendship we have.”\nBack in Harpenden, as we wait for the bill, two twentysomething women walk past, less noisy than the Portuguese Water Dog… until one of them cries out uncontrollably, “Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry but could I get a photo? You’re such an inspiration to me!”\nRusso says “of course”, and jumps up to graciously greet the stranger like someone she went to school with. Sitting back down, she checks her phone again. Still no baby news, but her manicure and hair appointments are fast approaching.\n“One of my passions is keeping girls in sport. I'm trying to do as much as I can for that, she says. “I feel I have a responsibility to play well, to keep things moving for women's football, to keep making things better for the next generation.”\nThe fan in me decides a good way of showing Russo the level of fandom she’s stirring up in young girls is to whip out my nine-year-old daughter’s WSL 2024/25 sticker book. She is thrilled to see the Arsenal squad is nearly complete (all bar Emily Fox) and is equally chuffed to hear she is the reason my daughter plays up front and wears No 23.\n“My dad keeps everything – programmes, shirts, boots, and he collects the stickers too so I’ll ask him if he has any spare Emily Fox ones when I speak to him later,” says Russo. I say she would love that, and tell her how my daughter and I will be making a little Swiss adventure out of the Lionesses’ first Euro 2025 game against France in early July.\nShe’s buzzed to hear it. As she heads off, she leaves by sharing her favourite father/daughter-ism. “Whenever we say goodbye,” she pauses, “Dad always says ‘See you at the far post’. It’s our little thing.”\nStyling by Itunu Oke\nMake-up by Elaine Lynskey\nTailoring by Faye Oakenfull\nManicure by Sabrina Gayle\nHair by Yui Ozaki\nSet design by Kiara Gourlay",
