  "body_text": "A second half equalizer helped the Barton Community College women's soccer team salvage a 1-1 draw Saturday evening against Garden City Community College at Broncbuster Stadium.\nWith the result, the Cougars sit fifth in the conference standings with 13 points at 4-5-1 and 7-6-1 overall, while the Broncbusters remain a point ahead in fourth at 4-4-2 in league play and 9-4-3 on the season. Barton steps out of conference play Tuesday for a 7:00 p.m. road matchup against the Tabor College junior varsity squad, before returning to league action Wednesday against Dodge City Community College.\nGarden City opened the scoring late in the first half, converting a 26-yard free kick that slipped through the gloves of the Barton netminder to carry a 1-0 lead into halftime.\nThe Cougars drew even 11 minutes into second half action when Saki Takaki's corner kick into heavy traffic deflected off a Broncbuster defender and into the net for an own goal.\nDespite having the 25-mile-per-hour wind at its back in the second half, Barton was unable to find the go-ahead strike. Sara Aguirre led the Cougar attack with three shots, two on target, while Leonie Chambe collected two saves in the opening half before Leonie Kerle patrolled the pipes over the final 45 minutes without facing a shot on frame as both teams finished with three shots on frame.\nBARTON SCORING SUMMARY\n55:54: Own Goal",
