It is an amazing opportunity.”\nUnfortunately for Shauna and her husband, they will be unable to join Hannah at Wembley on that date as they had a holiday booked from over a year ago.\nWhile they sit glued to the television watching their daughter walk out at ‘the home of football’ with the 10-time League Cup champions, Hannah’s auntie Sinead Ward will be sitting in the stands with her wife Gillian Costgrove as they accompany her to London.\nShauna said: “Sinead has been a big influence on Hannah’s life because she played football too. Sinead is a big Liverpool supporter and has played for a number of local teams over the years and even had a stint at Northern Ireland Ladies.\n“We are happy that someone with such a big influence on Hannah’s life is taking her to this Liverpool match.”\nFootball is a major part of Hannah’s life, particularly Liverpool, as her room is covered in memorabilia, and she is a regular at Derry City matches for both the men’s and women’s teams.\nThe 11-year-old has experienced much success with her Maiden City side, winning a number of trophies in her short four-year career, but the right-sided player is determined to emulate the career of her aunt and has a record-breaking footballer in her family she can look to as evidence she could potentially one day not only lead Liverpool out as a mascot but maybe as a player once she is a senior player; her great uncle is Brendan Bradley, the current leading scorer in the League of Ireland history, scoring 235 goals and holding the Finn Harps record of 181 goals for the club.\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nSubscribe or register today to discover more from DonegalLive.ie\nBuy the e-paper of the Donegal Democrat, Donegal People's Press, Donegal Post and Inish Times here for instant access to Donegal's premier news titles.\nKeep up with the latest news from Donegal with our daily newsletter featuring the most important stories of the day delivered to your inbox every evening at 5pm.",
