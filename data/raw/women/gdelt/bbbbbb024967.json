I’m just here to liveblog this pro wrestling show for these folks.\nThe Demand make their entrance for our opener and Ricochet has some things he wants to say.\nHe starts out with “Fly Eagles Fly” and teases the locals about their football team and says the only good thing to come out of Massachusetts is his beautiful wife, and he needs to clear the air. A few weeks ago he was talking to Tony Khan and he was surprised Ariel Helwani didn’t ask TK about Montel Vontavious Porter.\nHe says MVP is getting old and has demential and misspoke the name of the AEW National Championship, of which he is going to be the first champion. He steamrolls “Shut the fuck up!” chants and says once he’s champion the fans are going to give him the respect he deserves and he’ll be flying high with his homies GOA and nobody can stop him from fulfilling his quest for gold.\nFinally Bobby Lashley gets sick of hearing him talk… AND HE CHUCKS RICOCHET CLEAN OVER THE ROPES AND INTO THE GATES OF AGONY! Around the way, Bob lands the Pounce and then lays out Bishop Kaun and puts Toa Liona over the timekeeper’s barricade to the delight of MVP!\nBobby Lashley vs. Ricochet\nWinner gets to enter the Casino Gauntlet Match at Full Gear first.\nFinally starting inside, Ricochet mounts a comeback, Jumbo knee and a pair of kicks, standing shooting star press, diving moonsault, only two! Charging in with Spirit Gun, Lashley counters and chokeslams him hard! Off the ropes…\nBobby Lashley wins by pinfall with the spear, earning the #1 spot in the AEW National Championship Casino Gauntlet Match at Full Gear.\nSamoa Joe and Katsuyori Shibata are backstage.\nJoe cuts a promo on Hangman Page saying his only solace is that Page’s whole world of comfort is going to get very different very fast, because he is guilty of crimes and transgressions against the Opps, and his punishment starts tonight in the form of Shibata. Deadly by design, violent by intention, and firmly intent on bringing Hanger to justice for what he did to “Powerhouse” Will Hobbs.\nRenee Paquette interviews the Young Bucks backstage.\nBefore they can speak, Don Callis rolls up to tell her to leave them alone and tells the Bucks to show everyone why they’re the best tag team on the planet and they’ll answer questions after.\nJosh Alexander & Young Bucks (Matt & Nick Jackson) vs. SkyFlight (Dante Martin, Darius Martin, & Scorpio Sky)\nDante and Matt to start, feeling out, duck under, both men go for dropkicks and kip up to stalemate!

They still hesitate and he says AEW is dangerous and he’d hate to see what happened to Kenny Omega happen to them. Speak of the devil…\nEnter Kenny Omega, chair in hand.\nHe wallops Rocky Romero and Mark Davis and slides into the ring to brawl with Josh Alexander while the Bucks huddle in the corner.

And just like at Blood and Guts, the history books are gonna say that Mox tapped out!\nBrodido cut a promo on FTR.\nThey’ve proven that they’re one of the greatest tag teams in wrestling but they haven’t been able to prove that they can beat them, and they’re gonna keep the tag titles, because Brodido never stops fighting.\nWe see Mercedes Mone walking backstage in a lovely fur coat and gold sequined minidress, carrying two of her titles, and we go to break.\nBack from commercial, Kenny Omega is backstage with Jurassic Express.\nOmega says that they say money can’t buy family or friendship, but Don Callis and the Young Bucks proved that wrong, and he’s mad at Josh Alexander for hurting Kota Ibushi and Michael Nakazawa, and he tells Don to count his money because his time is coming, and until then, goodbye and goodnight, bang.\nAlex Windsor & Riho vs. Timeless Love Bombs (Mina Shirakawa & Toni Storm) (AEW Women’s World Tag Team Championship Tournament First Round Match)\nShirakawa and Riho to start, Mina blasts her with a dropkick for one!

He’s also excited to see how Briscoe thrives under a real family.\nMark tells him not to talk to him about family, because every time he steps in the ring he fights for his family and with his road family the Conglomeration, and he has no intentions of leaving that behind.

Kyle thanks Okada for not agreeing to no physicality and Kazuchika says he was happy to help.\nAnd we go to break.\nBack from commercial we get a PAC video package.\nHe says he’s been doing a lot of soul-searching and thinks he deserves Darby Allin an apology for promising him a broken neck and sending him to the burn ward instead, but maybe he did both, because nobody’s seen Allin since. At Blood and Guts maybe he took things too far, but if Darby still has that backbone, he wants him to answer the question.\nHe’s challenging him to a legitimate contest, no weapons, no cattle prod, no taser, no flamethrower, because stripped of his bells and whistles, there’s no way someone like Allin can compete with a legitimate athlete like him.\nSamoa Joe makes his entrance to join the commentary team.\nHanger attacks Shibata during his entrance!

He might be surrounded by thousands of crazy fans and sitting at the desk with commentary, Samoa is now alone. When he walks into the steel cage at Full Gear, he wants Joe to remember that he doesn’t have Will Hobbs because he send him to the hospital and he doesn’t have Shibata because he just sent him to [REDACTED], and most importantly he wants him to remember what happened the last time Page was locked in a steel cage with a man.\nBecause if he has to, he will do it again.\nWe get a promo from FTR.\nStokely Hathaway asks Brodido if anything they’ve done will hold up in nine years, and Cash Wheeler tells them to enjoy tonight, there’s no shenanigans, they’re not gonna attack Dick “the Dragon” Steamboat or anybody’s grandma.
