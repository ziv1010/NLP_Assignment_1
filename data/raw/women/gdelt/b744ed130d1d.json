  "body_text": "SYDNEY – Someone could pen a wonderful book and movie script about the Spain’s Cinderella soccer team, and their ability to overcome challenges, support and setbacks, and still be crowned as FIFA’s Women’s World Cup champion.\nSpain’s senior women’s soccer team defied the odds against them and flew from Sydney, Australia with a FIFA trophy on the main deck of their charter.\nIn June, makers and pundits alike did not have them winning the tournament. The ‘experts’ predicted England, Germany and the United States as the favorites to walk away with some combinations of first, second and third-places. Sweden, France and Netherlands, were considered the best teams to go deep in the international contest.\nThose top six organizations are better financed and sponsored, have deeper talent pools and training facilities over Spain’s national program.\nThe Spaniards arrived to the tournament ranking sixth in the FIFA women’s table. Their formidable opponent in the Women’s World Cup final of the nearly month-long tournament, England, two positions above them.\nIn addition, Spain did not bring 15 of their most talented and experienced players. They remained on the sidelines spectators who were boycotting trainings, friendlies and competitive play because of the team’s head coach, Jorge Vilda’s behavior towards them, and select teammates on this roster. And a subset of players were experiencing anxiety and grief from family related hardship.\nDespite these hurdles, La Rojas overcame it all and ultimately stood tall as victors of the 2023 Women’s World Cup Soccer Tournament.\nAfter the final whistle blew, the entire team, from the Queen of Spain to the team’s ball boys and girls gleefully savored their moment when they collectively raised their trophy before an impassioned 74,876 spectators in Stadium Australia. Up tempo music roared, gold foil confetti rained and a fire and laser light show worthy of a Las Vegas New Year’s Eve celebration entertained the standing-up audience, and millions watching around the globe. The grand celebration was on.\nIn a shoulder-to-shoulder match made for sitting on the edge of a futon, the underdog Spaniards defeated England’s mighty Three Lionesses, 1- 0. There was no need for extended periods and dramatic penalty kicks. The dramatic result is now the FIFA books.\nIt was the crafty work of their two-way, left-back and young captain Olga Carmona who scored the lone goal that propelled the team to undisputed victory.\nDespite the passing of her ill father and best friend’s mother, plus dealing with an uneasy relationship with the team’s head coach, Carmona held up and led her team in the most watched game in women’s football history.\nCarmona jettisoned from her defensive position into the final third of the field. Teresa Abelleira delivered a first-class cross-pass to Mariona Caldentey. She dribbled, then pushed the ball to the high-flying Carmona.\nWith the ball at her swift feet, she went on full thrust attack, ultimately blasting a shot that cruised just past the left hand of England’s stoic goalkeeper, Mary Earps.\nWith the crowd feeling part stunned and part celebratory, England was feeling pressured. In turn, they responded by both pushing players up and playing with nothing less than a do-or-die mentality, all in in hopes of matching the Spain’s goal.\nHard tackles, bumps and head knockers complete with grunts, plus a back pocket of yellow cards followed, and so, all the way through stoppage time.\nEngland’s all-out defensive effort kept Spain from scoring a second goal the second half. England’s defender Alex Greenwood poaches the ball from winger Eva Maria Navaro well inside the 18-yard box.\nUltimately, Spain’s collapsed defensive unit and their impressive keeper held off the relentless Lionesses to penetrate into the 18-yard box and find the back of the net.\nSpain could have made it to 2-nil on a VAR reviewed play that ended up favoring them. England’s Keira Walsh was caught red handed and the Spaniards were extended a penalty kick for a handball.\nThe ensuing kick by Mariona Caldentey, was brilliantly stopped by Earps, who dove to her left and suppressed the incoming salvo.\nThe emotional loss was England’s second defeat in 39-matches since their head coach, Sarina Wiegman, took charge.\nHer name has come up as a possible candidate for the open U.S. Women’s head coaching position.\nSpain’s head coach expressing a conservative smile after Olga Carmona scored in the first half of the match.\nFor Vilda, the win made him the second male coach to win a Women’s World Cup. The Euros, Olympics and now the World Cup can be added to his impressive resume.\n“What we did, it’s difficult to achieve,” he said. “I’m very proud of this team, we have shown we know how to play, that we know how to suffer, we have believed and we are world champions.”\nJubilant players celebrated their crowning achievement by themselves while the coaching staff was off to the side. A handful of players did acknowledged their head coach and tossed him in the air.\nPost-match, Captain Carmona expressed her the the bittersweet reality of the win and the loss of the father. She learned about the latter immediately after the game concluded. Her family elected to hold back the devastating news until the match finished.\n“Yesterday was the best and the worst day of my life,” Carmona said.\nStylish Queen Letizia of Spain and her daughter soaked up the glorious win. Both congratulated each and every player from England on the stage.\nThe Queen and her royal entourage must be very proud of her country’s women’s football program. Spain is the first program to hold the u17, u20, and senior women’s world titles at the same time.\nThese results are goals for the U.S. Women’s program to aspire to achieve.\nFollowing the morning, the team flew to Madrid and were welcomed by thousands of delirious supporters. A parade was hosted by government dignitaries, including the King and Queen of Spain, and a storybook ending it is.\nEngland’s Prince William, chose not to fly to Australia and participate in the championship match as a viewer and supporter. The future King is the President of the FA.\nSpeaking at a closing media conference ahead FIFA President Gianni Infantino, shared his viewpoints about the disparity between payouts before women and men during the Women’s World Cup final.\n“I say to all the women – and you know I have four daughters, so I have a few at home – I say to all the women that you have the power to change,” said Infantino. “Pick the right battles, pick the right fights. You have the power to change.”\nHe then went of to elaborate, “You have the power to convince us, men, what we have to do and what we don’t have to do. You do it, just do it. With me, with FIFA, you will find open doors. Just push the doors, they are open. He concluded with both hope and optimism for all, “And, do it also at national level in every country, at continental level, in every confederation. Just keep pushing, keep the momentum [going], keep dreaming, and let’s really go for full equality.”\nPhoto Credit: John Babiak.\nThank you for reading Burgundy Wave.
