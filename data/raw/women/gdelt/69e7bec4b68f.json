  "body_text": "Sports pundit Laura Woods and Love Island’s Adam Collard are set to become parents for the first time.\nLaura, 37, and Adam, 28, announced their happy news this weekend with a photo of her pregnancy scan, with their shared pooch peeking out behind.\n‘Hey, baby 💕’, the caption read simply.\nWhile the pair would typically be quickly inundated with congratulatory messages from their combined fans, Laura disabled comments on her announcement post.\nIt didn’t take long for the photo to garner thousands of likes, though, and Adam reposted it on his Instagram Story, which boasts one million followers.\nLaura and Adam went public with their romance in October.\nInitially, the lovebirds kept their romance low-key, rarely sharing photos together online.\nIn recent months, they’ve offered a further glimpse inside their relationship via social media, leaving sweet comments on one another’s posts and sharing content from romantic getaways.\nEarlier this month, Adam shared some black-and-white snaps of their time together to mark Laura’s birthday.\nHe captioned the post: ‘Happy birthday you rockstar x.’\nOpening up about their relationship, Adam previously told The Mirror about Laura being the woman to steal his heart.\nThe two-time Love Island Lothario said last year: ‘It’s going great, you know.\n‘She’s amazing and we are having a lot of fun. It feels like I’m living the dream.’\nIn the past, Adam has dated a string of women who are in the public eye, including Kate Moss’s younger sister, Lottie.\nHowever, the fitness influencer – who appeared on Love Island in 2018 and 2022 – seems to have finally settled.\nSpeaking on the Getting Lippy Gossip Show last year, he revealed his relationship with Laura began a few months after their first meeting.\n‘I’d followed her on Instagram because I’d seen a Lionesses game or something like that and then I DMed her because she put, like, a funny meme on her Story,’ he shared.\n‘The funny part of the story is, for a football fan as well, I actually didn’t know who she was.\n‘Well, I knew who she was as in I recognised and knew her face, but I didn’t know that was Laura Woods in terms of her.\n‘So I went in for a podcast… [and] she walked past me and the girl that was chaperoning us through was like, “That’s Laura Woods” and I was like [shrugs] but she had her back turned to us, she was, like, miles behind us.’\nAdam said ‘months and months’ went by before he tried shooting his shot.\nAs he prepares to become a dad, Adam spoke before about his intentions of marrying Laura and starting a family with the TNT Sports host.\nMore Trending\n‘I’m protective, whether it’s Laura, or my family, my friends. I want to get married. I want to have kids as well. I’ve always thought, what type of person will I be? How can I protect my kids?’\nOn what kind of father he will be, he mused: ‘Obviously, I’ve never had a kid, but I don’t think I’ll be plastering it all over [social media]. I want them to have a fair fight and a chance not to be judged straight away.\n‘As long as my really close circle knows exactly who I am, I don’t care. I think you have to take everything with a pinch of salt.’\nDeals of the Day\n-\nThe Traitors is over – but Claudia Winkleman’s shoes are everywhere\n-\nCraving sun, city streets or theme parks holdays?
