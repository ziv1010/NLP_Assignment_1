The website said former Texas Tech star Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs was one of the people Sorsby called to break the news.He had a stellar season for the Bearcats this season, throwing for 2,800 yards and 27 touchdowns while being intercepted five times. Sorsby also rushed for nine scores.\nSorsby has three seasons of starting experience, one for Indiana in 2023 and two with Cincinnati.\nOverall, Sorsby has passed for 7,208 career yards and 60 touchdowns against 18 interceptions. He has 1,305 yards and 22 touchdowns on the ground.\nTexas Tech spent a lot of money on transfers last offseason and it paid off with a program-record 12 wins. The Red Raiders were the No. 4 seed in the College Football Playoff but were blanked in their lone playoff game, a 23-0 loss to No. 5 Oregon.\nQuarterback Behren Morton completed 18 of 32 passes for 137 yards and two interceptions and Texas Tech had just 215 yards.\nAlso, Sorsby is the boyfriend of Texas Tech women's volleyball player Gretchen Sigman, who transferred from Cincinnati to Texas Tech in mid-December.\nLSU reportedly will host Arizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt on a visit Monday. Leavitt was interested in Texas Tech and visited Kentucky over the weekend.\n--Field Level Media\nShares\nShare\nTweet\nShare\nFlip\nEmail\nGet a daily dose of Texas Guardian news through our daily email, its complimentary and keeps you fully up to date with world and business news as well.\nPublish news of your business, community or sports group, personnel appointments, major event and more by submitting a news release to Texas Guardian.\nMore InformationSINGAPORE: A late-year surge in manufacturing and technology demand powered Singapore's economy to its strongest annual expansion in...\nWASHINGTON, D.C: President Donald Trump made a lot of tariff threats and trade promises.
