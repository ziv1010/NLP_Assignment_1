  "body_text": "Collingwood is pleased to announce its AFLW Captain Brianna Davey and Vice-Captain Ruby Schleicher have today both signed fresh deals with the Club.\nBoth players have penned three-year deals and are set to remain Magpies until at least the end of 2026.\nDavey first stepped into a leadership role with the Pies in 2020 as Vice-Captain before being elevated to Co-Captain in 2021. The star midfielder went on to have a breakout 2021 season being awarded both the AFLW and Club’s Best & Fairest Awards, AFL Player’s Association’s Most Valuable Player and named Captain of the All-Australian side.\nAppointed as the program’s sole Captain in 2023, the 27-year-old made her return from a second ACL injury to average 20 disposals, 14 contested positions and eight tackles that season. Davey’s impressive efforts on field saw her awarded with the Club’s Runner Up Best & Fairest Award last season.\nA foundation player with Collingwood’s AFLW program, Ruby Schleicher was presented with her first formal leadership opportunity in 2019 as a Vice-Captain.\nSchleicher’s 2021 season was a standout with the 26-year-old leading the league in intercept possessions (90) to earn her first All-Australian selection and to be named Runner Up for the Club’s Best and Fairest Award that same year. The defender continued to impress in season 2022 where she was presented with her second All-Australian blazer.\nAfter sustaining a knee injury in late in the 2023 AFLW season, Schleicher is set to return in 2024 as a key pillar in defence.\nCollingwood’s General Manager of Women’s Football Jess Burger is pleased to have secured the two leaders.\n“We’re pleased to announce the recommitment from Bri and Ruby a further three seasons,” Burger said.\n“Both players have been integral leaders within our program and across the industry over the past eight seasons. The re-signings of Bri & Ruby demonstrate an ongoing confidence in their own development and growth with the Club, as well as their continued belief in the direction of the program.\n“Bri and Ruby’s signatures today join 20 of our AFLW players who are on multi-year deals which allows us to drive and develop elite standards both on and off the field this coming season and into the future.",
