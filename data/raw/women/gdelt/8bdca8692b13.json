  "body_text": "Locked up in July: One punch killer, 'devious' child sex pervert and 'brazen' dealer among 38 jailed\nMckenzie Dicicco, Raymond Coleman and Jack Ford are among those jailed at Teesside's courts in July\nJuly has seen a one-punch killer, paedophiles and a 'brazen' drug dealer jailed at Teesside's courts.\nMckenzie Dicicco launched a \"cowardly\" one-punch attack after a \"nonsensical argument\" at Burger King at York station following a boozy day out. He hit James Hitchcock from behind and he suffered a fatal head injury, sadly passing away in hospital three days later.\n'Devious' child sex pervert Raymond Coleman who's been committing vile crimes for over 50 YEARS was also locked up again - this time for making indecent images of children.\nHere's the names, faces and stories behind the 38 criminals who have been locked up in July in Teesside and the surrounding area:\nJanette Price\nA pensioner plunged a kitchen knife into a woman's liver after a long-running row over property and booze. Janette Price was embroiled in a long running and acrimonious dispute with a couple who lived next door to her on Lincoln Road in Redcar .\nOn the morning of July 23, last year, the couple called the police and 69-year-old Price was warned to leave her neighbour alone. Hours later, she took a kitchen knife with her and after knocking on her neighbour's door, she lunged at her female victim.\nPrice stabbed her neighbour in her abdomen, and the knife penetrated the woman's liver. The second stab wound damaged the victim's hand.\nAs police arrived, Price was sitting on the floor of her neighbour's doorway - delaying the paramedic's access to the victim. She refused to drop the knife and officers tasered her.\nAs she was led away, Price said: \"I know I did wrong. They've tortured me. I only went round to say I had got a solicitor. I took the knife because she always runs off. I didn't take it to stab her.\"\nJolyon Perks told Teesside Crown Court that the housing association which manages the properties on Lincoln Road, had received complaints \"about the upkeep of Ms Price's property and about her drinking\". \"She made counter complaints,\" he added.\nPrice pleaded guilty to wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and the possession of a bladed article. Her defence barrister, Victoria Lamballe, told the court that there was \"considerable animosity between the neighbours\" and the upset was exacerbated for Price \"by the fact that she lives alone and because of her declining mental state.\"\nJudge Jonathan Carroll jailed Price for 32-months.\nLuke David Wilson\nA rapist has been jailed for almost six years after a prolonged attack on a woman following a night out in Whitby. Luke David Wilson admitted rape just before his trial was due to start at York Crown Court on Tuesday, July 1.\nThe 31-year-old also admitted sexual assault by penetration on the woman. Wilson, of Rosedale Close, Whitby, carried out a prolonged and sexual attack on the victim despite her repeated shouts of \"no\".\nNorth Yorkshire Police said she had only consented to a cuddle following a night out in the town in 2023. When interviewed by detectives, Wilson stated they had consensual sex.\nIn a victim personal statement, which was read out during the sentencing hearing, the woman said: \"I contemplated suicide more than once and I went to my GP for help. I didn’t know where to go, or what to do, and I felt like a burden to everyone around me.\n\"I went from being a trusting, outgoing and independent person to being a shell of myself and I was just going through the motions of day-to-day life.\n“I can no longer trust men, whether that be in a relationship or family members, and I have found myself resentful towards males. I got into a relationship a long time after what happened, and it was awful. I realised that I couldn’t sleep anymore as I didn’t feel safe, so I ended the relationship, and I think that I will be alone for the rest of my life. The thought of even trying to give my trust to anyone makes me feel sick.”\nWilson was jailed for five years and 10 months. He has also been placed on the Register of Sex Offenders for the rest of his life.\nDemi Belcher\nA thieving drug addict chased a woman and repeatedly hacked at her with an axe in broad daylight. Demi Belcher ran at her victim and hit her in the back with the axe, causing the woman to fall to the ground on a Hartlepool street on May 22, 2023.\nThe 32-year-old stood over the terrified woman on Wynyard Road and repeatedly hacked at her. The woman put her arms up to protect herself, as Belcher aimed for her head.\nThe victim's boyfriend got hold of Belcher and took the axe - he kicked and punched her - but Belcher got up and grabbed the axe back. She chased the female victim again, before the boyfriend intervened for a second time.\nBelcher then smashed up the woman's Audi A7 with the axe. She grabbed a new pair of trainers, which were in a box on the back seat, and fled.\nBelcher, of Worcester Gardens in Hartlepool, pleaded guilty to wounding; having a bladed article; criminal damage and theft. She also admitted seven further shop thefts, fraud and obstructing a constable - relating to a separate incident.\nBelcher has a long criminal record - predominantly for shop theft. Her partner Michael Hutchinson, of Bruce Crescent in Hartlepool, admitted one count of criminal damage to the Audi.\nIn mitigation, Stephen Constantine told the court that Belcher was addicted to drugs at the time, but that she is now \"clean\" in prison and she receives a monthly injection, which replaces Methadone. \"She doesn't want to live like this,\" Mr Constantine said, \"she wants to stay off the drugs. She has consulted with the chaplaincy in Low Newton prison.\"\nBelcher sobbed as Judge Francis Laird jailed her for 33-months. Her partner Hutchinson, was handed a nine-month prison term for criminal damage.\nStephen Carr\nA man has been jailed for attacking his wife with a bow and arrows and stabbing her six times in an attack at their home. Stephen Carr, 57, was found guilty of attempted murder at their home.\nHis wife pleaded for her life and was stabbed while she made a 999 call to North Yorkshire Police.\nCCTV from inside Carr's own home captured the attack on 8 September 2024 and helped to secure his conviction. Carr violently attacked his wife first with a compound bow and then with a kitchen knife and told her: “You are dying tonight.”\nAfter pursuing her round the family home with a bow and arrow, he followed her into their bedroom and took a kitchen knife before stabbing her six times in her back. He then retreated to his garden shed, where he was later discovered by police.\nHe sent a WhatsApp message to his wife after the brutal assault in which he said: “I’m glad I didn’t do what I wanted to do. I did say you were pushing me to far [sic]. My bag [sic] sorry.”\nThe victim had managed to quickly close a door when met with her husband drawing his bow, which he then fired at the door with his wife standing behind it. Fearing a continuation of an attack, the victim managed to get a number of arrows and break them to prevent him using them on her.\nShe tried to evade her husband by fleeing to the bedroom at their home and taking cover. She hid under the duvet where Carr fired three shots with unbroken arrows that he managed to find.\nAt this point, the victim had managed to use her phone to call 999. Carr took a kitchen knife and stabbed her six times in her back while she laid in a foetal position on the floor. The victim screamed to the police call taker, telling them what had happened and asking for urgent help.\nCarr pleaded guilty to the alternative offence of causing grievous bodily harm but denied attempted murder. At his trial which concluded at Leeds Crown Court on Monday, June 2, 2025, Carr did eventually give evidence about his recollection of events, where he told the court he followed his wife around the house drawing the bow to scare her into leaving him alone, as he stated she was controlling him.\nHe suggested that this was a build-up of pressure of working full time, his caring responsibilities for his elderly mother and his dependence on alcohol. He said he never intended to kill his wife and that if he wanted to kill her with the bow, his skills as an archer would allow him to do so.\nWhen asked about the repeated use of a knife causing six significant stab wounds to her back, Carr suggested he had “blacked out”. The jury found Carr guilty of attempted murder and he was sentenced at Leeds Crown Court to 17 years in prison.\nFrank Park and James McStravick\nA burgling duo were so drunk when they smashed their way into a Darlington home they were \"falling over.\" Frank Park, 26, and James McStravick, 28, broke into a house on the corner of Victoria Road and Bedford Street, shortly before 5am on January 26.\nThe homeowner was woken up by a loud bang and he thought he heard someone shout: \"Open up!.\" As he called 999, he heard a loud smash and he fled his home in his underwear through the back door.\nWhile outside in the garden, the terrified man could see the two men inside. The police arrived and Park and McStravick fled.\nCCTV footage showed that McStravick had come armed with a spanner. He was carrying a balaclava. Park was drinking from a bottle of wine he was carrying.\nInside the home, the police found blood in the kitchen and living room. One of the duo had taken a knife out of the block in the kitchen and left it near the bathroom upstairs. Cupboards and drawers had been opened.\nThe TV had been pulled over and the computer was on the floor. A games controller was stolen.\nPolice found Park and McStravick nearby - McStravick was holding the controller. He had injured his hand whilst breaking in through the front door.\nPark, of White Heart Crescent, and McStravick, of Victoria Road, both pleaded guilty to burglary.\nThe judge activated one-year of the suspended sentence Park was given for his previous town centre attack and handed him a total jail term of three-years. McStravick was handed a two-year sentence.\nMark Bullen\nA paedophile has been hauled back to court after breaking his strict licence conditions. Mark Bullen, 38, was handed a suspended prison sentence last year after he was caught with thousands of videos showing young children being sexually abused.\nBullen had searched for the illegal material online and in a message to another online user, he said he was interested in \"young sex vids.\" He asked for \"samples\" and exchanged phone numbers with the other man.\nBullen was caught with almost 3,500 graphic videos and images showing children from the ages of one to ten, being sexually abused. In addition to the suspended prison sentence, Judge Chris Smith made Bullen the subject of a 10-year sexual harm prevention order.\nBut this month, Teesside Crown Court heard that he breached the order within months. Bullen's offender manager, DC Benjamin Lincoln-Taylor, made a routine visit to check up on his online use, on April 23. Bullen had deleted a file from an app he had downloaded - breaching the terms of the order.\nThe paedophile is banned from deleting any of his files or internet history. A forensic IT check revealed he had deleted a file downloaded from the Wondershare site.\nHe was also using an app that prosecutor Dan Wilberforce said \"connects to random users by video.\" Mr Wilberforce said that when the police tested the app, \"it immediately connected with a naked woman performing a sex act.\"\nBullen, of Virginia Gardens in Acklam, Middlesbrough, admitted breaching his sexual harm prevention order and the suspended sentence order. Judge Paul Reid handed Bullen a 21-week prison term.\nAzem Ahmed\nThe owner of a shop which sold counterfeit and illegal cigarettes to children has been jailed. Azem Ahmed, 28, of Vicarage Avenue, Stockton, and business owner (from August 2020) of The Norton Shop on Norton Road, was sentenced to two and half years in prison at Teesside Crown Court.\nHe previously pleaded guilty to nine charges and was convicted of a further 11 charges in connection with the sale and possession for sale of counterfeit and illicit tobacco, contrary to the Trade Marks Act 1994 and the Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products Regulations 2015.\nThe court heard that Stockton Council's Trading Standards team began an investigation in January 2019 when a tobacco brand representative contacted them with concerns after making a test purchase at the shop. In January 2019 Trading Standards officers visited the shop to make an undercover purchase, where they were sold a packet of 20 illicit cigarettes.\nThis packet of cigarettes had no identification numbers and was not in plain standardised packaging as required by The Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products Regulations 2015 nor did it include the required health warnings.\nOfficers searched the premises during a visit in February 2019 where they found illicit tobacco and cigarettes stashed in a holdall behind the shop counter. And a further test purchase was made in July 2019 revealing that sales of illicit cigarettes were still taking place from the premises.\nTeesside Magistrates' Court granted a closure order of the shop in August 2019 but when it reopened three months later the Council's officers began to receive complaints of sales of counterfeit and illegal cigarettes and vapes to children. As well as reports of sales made to children, the court heard how a packet of cigarettes could be bought from the shop for £5, well below the average cost.\nFurther investigations and searches by the council's officers revealed illicit tobacco and cigarettes stashed in the shop as well as in the bedroom, wardrobes, kitchen and yard of a neighbouring flat and hidden in a custom-made roof compartment.\nDespite several warnings, Mr Ahmed repeatedly continued to sell illicit cigarettes, vapes and tobacco products at The Norton Shop which led to magistrates granting a second closure order of the shop and a closure order of the neighbouring flat in January 2022. A third closure order of the shop was granted in December 2023.\nCurtis Smith\nA pervert who had sexual communications with a child has been locked up. Curtis Smith, who was sentenced for the original offences in 2021, was back before Teesside Crown Court after admitting five counts of breaching his sexual harm prevention order.\nThe court heard Smith, 25, of no fixed abode, had not only failed to notify police he was using certain social media platforms he was also using aliases on platforms including Snapchat, TikTok and Instagram without notifying officers what those aliases were.\nJudge Advocate Thomas Mitchell said the defendant was placed on seven year order for having sexual communication with a child and officers uncovered the breaches when they visited his home. He said: \"If you use an alias, you tell police what that alias is. This was a deliberate breach by you.\"\nJudge Mitchell said it wasn't just one breach, it was several using different platforms. However, he added: \"There is no evidence of you having communicated with children.\"\nBut, he said he was talking to females on the sites. The judge said that he felt Smith does potentially pose a risk to the public and ordered him to serve 15 months in prison.\nJack Ford\nA Teesside drug dealer who rented an Airbnb to supply class A drugs has been jailed for almost 13 years. Jack Ford made the Airbnb booking himself and provided his own personal details knowing that he would be using the property to store, package, and weigh three different types of drugs ready for onward supply.\nThe 32-year-old was detained by police inside a property on Grassington Road in Grove Hill, Middlesbrough. A search of the house led to 842g of cocaine, with a street value of approximately £84,000 and a wholesale value of between £38,000 to £42,000, being found inside cupboards in the kitchen.\nFurther searches in the bedroom recovered three packages of heroin. Following testing, one of the class A drug packages weighed 1,070g and had an estimated street value of £21,000, the second was 104g and worth approximately £2,080 and the third contained 292g of heroin believed to be worth £5,840.\nCannabis was also recovered inside the property along with £10,000 in cash, a money counting machine and digital scales. The 32-year-old had been wanted by detectives from Cleveland Police ’s Homicide and Major Enquiry Team (HMET).\nThe discovery came following reports of concern for an individual at a property where threats had been made in relation to drugs. Following the report to police, which was made on Wednesday, October 30, last year, detectives conducted various enquiries that identified Ford and utilised specialist methods to establish his location.\nVarious attempts were made to arrest him and on Thursday, November 7 he was arrested inside the Airbnb on suspicion of conspiracy to supply cannabis, possession with intent to supply heroin and possession with intent to supply cocaine. After being questioned in police custody, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) authorised Ford to be charged.\nFord, of St Paul’s Road in Newport, Middlesbrough, pleaded guilty to all the offences at an earlier hearing and appeared at Teesside Crown Court to be sentenced by Judge Mitchell to 12 years and nine months. He was also sentenced to two years and six months for violent disorder in Middlesbrough that will run concurrently.\nSharon Wyvill\nA stalker breached a restraining order and told her ex partner she would 'torture' him and his future partners if he 'got with anyone else'. Sharon Wyvill's ex partner found her sitting on his sofa inside his home crying and shouting that he had cheated on her - despite her being slapped with a restraining order at Teesside Magistrates' Court a month earlier.\nHer first conviction came after she stalked the man over a 10-day period which saw her smash his living room window with her fist before throwing glass at him and climbing into his house. Now, the 45-year-old has been locked up after admitting two counts of harassment by breaching a restraining order after conviction and being found guilty of a third count of the same charge.\nSaba Shan, prosecuting, said: \"[The victim] was in a relationship with the defendant for 14 months until November last year.\" On Christmas Eve, 2024, Wyvil was handed a suspended prison sentence for stalking involving fear of violence and an 18-month restraining order was made preventing her from contacting her victim or entering the Middlesbrough street he lives on.\nBut just a month later, her victim arrived home to see her sitting on his doorstep on her phone. Ms Shan said: \"She had not seen [the victim] at that point so he decided to go back around the block again in the hope she would have left.\"\nWhen he returned she was no longer outside the property so he headed inside and took a shower. When he came out 15 minutes later he found the defendant sat on his living room sofa.\nTeesside Crown Court heard she had a phone in her hand and was crying and started shouting at him accusing him of cheating. Her ex partner told her she shouldn't be in his house and got her to leave and locked the door.\nShe spent the next 10 minutes repeatedly knocking on the door asking to come in but the victim went to bed. The next day Wyvill returned and was knocking on his door. She was shouting: \"I love you, why are you doing this to me?\"\nHe told her to go away and she said: \"I'm never going to leave you alone. If you get with anyone else I'm going to torture them and you.\"\nThe man called the police and she was arrested and charged. Six weeks later, an emergency call was made from the defendant's phone - while she was on court bail. The call recorded the victim saying \"go away\" and the defendant crying in the background.\nJudge Advocate Thomas Mitchell jailed Wyvill, of Highmead Walk, Middlesbrough, to 40 weeks in prison. He also activated the 12-week suspended sentence order.\nTiyron Ophield\nA burglar caught red handed in his victim’s car before threatening to burn it out has been jailed. Tiyron Ophield was caught in the vehicle on the victim’s driveway in Peterlee in the early hours of April 23.\nThe alarmed owner dragged the 20-year-old from the car and a scuffle ensued, leaving the victim with a finger injury that required surgery. Ophield made off, leaving behind a bag for life filled with items stolen from other addresses that same night.\nThe police were called and an officer was speaking with the victim when Ophield returned to the scene. Police said he was chased down whilst trying to get away over a wall and subsequently injured two officers and the victim’s wife.\nOphield, of Hartlepool, also tried to escape when he was taken to hospital for minor injuries he sustained. He was subsequently charged with nine offences including burglary, assault, assault on an emergency worker, threatening to damage or destroy property, handling stolen goods and escaping from lawful custody.\nAt Durham Crown Court, Ophield was sentenced to two years and six months in prison.\nMahmoud Al-Omer\nA husband punched and strangled his wife after she asked him to turn the internet on. Mahmoud Al-Omer \"flew into a rage” over the request and set upon the woman leaving her “terrified”.\nThe 29-year-old told her that he would ‘take her to the other land’, which a Teesside Crown Court judge said was a threat to kill. Al-Omer was described as a “danger to the public” as he was sentenced at Teesside Crown Court for intentional strangulation and common assault.\nThe Middlesbrough court heard that police were called to Al-Omer’s home address just after 10pm on June 28, last year. They found the defendant outside saying that his wife had locked him out.\nHowever, when officers gained entry they found her in a “distressed state” and children were present. In a statement, the woman said she’d asked Al-Omer to turn on the internet so she could contact family and friends abroad.\nBut he refused her request and “flew into a rage”. The woman told how he “punched and strangled her” on three occasions.\nThe Middlesbrough court heard that the woman struggled to breathe and she believed he had threatened to kill her. Tom Bennett, mitigating, outlined that Al-Omer is a man of previous good character and he arrived in the UK after fleeing to escape conflict in Syria.\nJudge Advocate Thomas Mitchell said: “When a man strangles a woman he literally takes her life in his hands. To do it three times to your wife is deplorable.”\nThe judge ruled that he believed Al-Omer, of Craven Street, Middlesbrough, was a “danger to the public” and sentenced him to 19 months in prison.\nRaymond Coleman\nA 'devious' child sex pervert who's been committing vile crimes for over 50 YEARS has been locked up again - this time for making indecent images of children. Teesside Crown Court hear how 'remorseless' and 'devious' Raymond Coleman, previously jailed for attempted rape, has been committing sexual offences for the past five decades.\nNow, aged 73, the paedophile pensioner has been hauled before the courts again charged with two counts of making indecent images of children. Gurjot Kour, prosecuting, said: \"Due to the defendant's previous conviction, he is deemed as a high risk sex offender.\"\nDuring a police visit, Coleman handed over a mobile phone with very little activity on it. A search of his house was then carried out and a blue Samsung was discovered under his pillow in his bedroom.\nThere were a number of internet searches linking to child sex abuse and a thorough scan of his phone revealed two class A indecent videos and one class B indecent video. He has 12 previous convictions for 22 offences dating between 1968 and 2015 - including indecent assault of a child under 16, attempted rape, two counts of indecently assaulting a child under 14 and in 2015 he was handed a nine-year extended sentence for two counts of facilitating the commission of a child sex offence.\nTeesside Live previously reported how Coleman, then a regular punter in Middlesbrough’s red light district, boasted that another vice girl had supplied him with a child before. Another prostitute, who had gone with him to his home by taxi, was so sickened by his request that she reported him immediately to police.\nOn Thursday, July 10, the court heard how the class A videos were 15 seconds and 11 seconds long while the class B video was 23 seconds long. The children in the videos are estimated to be aged between four and 10.\nTom Bennett, mitigating, said Coleman, of Raithwaite Close, Guisborough, is of poor mental and physical health and outlined that these offences are not an escalation in his offending. Coleman was jailed for 10 months and made subject to a lifelong sexual harm prevention order.\nJordan Fish\nA danger driving dad “could have killed someone” in a police chase which saw him reach speeds of 80mph. Jordan Fish was banned from the roads in April but just under three weeks later got behind the wheel.\nThe 25-year-old was recognised by a police officer as he waited in traffic in Darlington. As the officer pulled alongside him and shouted: “Stay where you are Jordan,” he fled in the Mercedes vehicle.\nHowever, Teesside Crown Court heard that Fish feels “unsafe walking alone” due to being stabbed in a “targeted” attack. Fish, who works for a plumbing and gas company, admitted dangerous driving, driving whilst disqualified and driving with no insurance in Darlington on April 23.\nRachel Butt, prosecuting, outlined that on April 3, Fish was handed a suspended sentence for careless driving, disqualified driving and drug driving. However, 20 days later he was caught behind the wheel at around 4.30pm.\nWhen the police officer told Fish to stay where he was, the dad, and dad-to-be, sped off head on towards oncoming traffic and a police chase ensued. The Middlesbrough court heard that Fish reached speeds of 80mph in a 40mph zone.\nThe officer can be heard on his radio saying that he was going to abort the chase due to the “high risks” involved but Fish crashed into a member of the public’s car. However, the collision didn’t stop the danger driver as he drove away from the scene and his car later located on Wallington Drive.\nHowever, when police arrived he wasn't in the vehicle and CCTV captured him running away from the scene. Fish was eventually tracked down and arrested on May 12 while he was a passenger in a different vehicle.\nJudge Mitchell activated Fish’s 24 week suspended sentence and jailed him for 14 months for dangerous driving. Fish, of Heatherburn Court, Newton Aycliffe, was disqualified from driving for four years and six months and must also complete an extended retest before he gets behind the wheel again.\nDavid Wilkinson\nA predator who treated his young victim as a \"piece of meat\" has been sentenced to 19 years imprisonment for historic sexual offences. David Wilkinson subjected the child to appalling sexual abuse and rape.\nThe 55-year-old would groom the child by giving them alcohol, buying gifts and taking them on outings. This abuse plunged the victim into severe mental health struggles later in life.\nThe now-adult shared that their life had 'spiralled' out of control post-abuse, expressing a lifelong feeling of weakness and \"deep anger\" due to Wilkinson's actions. Defending, Nicholas Lumley KC pointed out that this would mark Wilkinson's \"first experience of any custody of any kind\" which could make his time in custody \"more difficult\".\nWilkinson, of Wood Grove, Newcastle, was handed a 20-year extended sentence for his crimes, with the first 19 years to be spent behind bars.\nAndrew Vickers\nA father said he feared his own son would kill him during an 'ugly' attack in the aftermath of another brutal assault where he repeatedly beat his victim with a mallet. Andrew Vickers has been handed an extended prison term of 10 years and three months following the attacks.\nOne of the 29-year-old's victims was left with \"horrifying\" injuries after he repeatedly beat him with a mallet. Teesside Crown Court heard Vickers was, in part, motivated by revenge. His victim was at his van when the defendant approached him and began attacking him with a mallet - dealing \"eight to 10 forceful blows\" to his head and upper body.\nPaul Newcombe, prosecuting, said there was an element of revenge to the incident as the victim is alleged to have accused him of stealing the complainant's mother's car. The man suffered a skull fracture, extensive facial bruising, a haematoma of the brain, an open head wound and the court heard he required at least two surgeries.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the attack, Vickers went to his parents' home and attacked his own father. Describing the day of the attack he said: \"The front door swung open aggressively, stood there was Andrew full of rage and hell.\" Vickers pushed his father and he stumbled 10ft backwards and he hit his head. He said he believed he was unconscious for a few seconds.\nVickers was above him and punched, stamped on and kicked him during the short attack. His dad said: \"I really thought he was going to kill me... I have never felt so frightened of him before.\"\nHe said his wife was trying to pull Vickers off him but she was unable to. The father suffered bruising to his chest and lacerations to his face.\nJonathan Walker, mitigating, said the \"extremely ugly incident\" with Vickers' father lasted less than five seconds according to CCTV.\nVickers, of Bridport Close, Stockton, was jailed for seven years and three months after admitting grievous bodily harm with intent, possession of an offensive weapon and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.\nRoyston Henderson\nA paedophile has started a 27-year prison sentence, after being found guilty of a string of child sex offences. Royston Henderson, 53, from Ormesby, sexually abused a child and tried to rape them. The victim reported the abuse to the police years later.\nHenderson denied the offences, but he was convicted by a jury on May 2, after standing trial at Teesside Crown Court. He was found guilty of five counts of sexually assaulting a child and attempted rape.\nHe was cleared of five other counts of raping a woman. Judge Aisha Wadoodi jailed Henderson, of Simonside Walk in Middlesbrough, for 27-years.\nStephen Woodward\nA man who used the £1million he made from an illegal streaming operation to live the high life has been jailed for more than three years. Stephen Woodward used his ill-gotten gains to buy designer clothes, jet off on holidays and drive around in a Jaguar F-Type V8 coupe worth £91,000.\nCity of London Police said the 36-year-old sold illegal access to copyrighted content through the websites IPTV Hosting, Helix Hosting and Black and White TV. IPTV Hosting provided illegal access to more than 4,500 channels including Sky Sports and BT Sports to end users and resellers for a fee.\nAn investigation found that subscriptions were paid for via card payments, 13 PayPal accounts owned by Stephen and peer-to-peer payment services such as Circle. He would then exchange the money into cryptocurrency, convert it back to flat currency and then deposit it across 23 bank accounts, police said.\nStephen's brother Christopher Woodward, 34, also received £126,000 derived from the sales of the illegal streaming websites. Following an investigation by the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit (PIPCU) at City of London Police, the brothers were sentenced at York Crown Court on July 11.\nStephen, of Thirsk, North Yorkshire, was sentenced to three years and one month in prison after he pleaded guilty at the same court on February 21, 2025 to distributing articles infringing copyright and four money laundering offences. Christopher, also of Thirsk, was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, and must also complete 240 hours of unpaid work.\nHe pleaded guilty at the same court on the same date to money laundering. Investigators also secured an all-assets restraint order against a total of £1.1 million held by Stephen. A further £144,121 worth of cash, which was seized from Stephen during the investigation, was also frozen.\nThese funds, in addition to jewellery seized by officers from Stephen's address, will now be subject to confiscation proceedings.\nAaron Pearson\nA police officer was left with \"anxious thoughts\" about starting a family after a thug violently kicked him between the legs while trying to evade arrest. Aaron Pearson initially ran off after being approached by Cleveland Police officers on Stockton's Lawson Street on June 24, 2022.\nHe and co-accused Zoe Swainston both proceeded to attack officers, who had been called to reports of a BMW being driven erratically. Pearson gave a false name to an officer before kicking him in the testicles with such force he was left in pain for about 20 minutes.\nSwainston tried to punch an officer in the face while hurling obscenities. Teesside Crown Court heard Swainston had been released some weeks ago but had been recalled to prison. Pearson was still in prison for the armed gang attack for which he had received more than three years jail time.\nOutlining the details of the assaults on police officers, prosecutor Sophie Johnston said, on arriving at Lawson Street, the PC saw the BMW parked on the side of the road and two other officers were already in attendance. \"He saw the defendants get out of the vehicle and instructed Mr Pearson to stay where he was,\" said Ms Johnstone.\nPearson, who was on bail at the time of the offence, ran off but was eventually detained and handcuffed. \"He appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol and gave a false name when asked,\" said Ms Johnstone.\n\"When Mr Pearson was arrested, the PC was stood in front of him. Mr Pearson kicked him in his testicles with force causing pain which lasted for around 20 minutes.\"\nThe court heard another PC tried to detain Swainston to search her and she became aggressive and told the officer to \"f**k off\". There was a struggle and Swainston tried to strike the officer in the face but the officer swerved out of the way and was instead struck on his chest.\n\"She used various obscenities and was handcuffed but managed to slip from one of the cuffs and appeared to try to assault the officers again and that resulted in her being detained on the floor,\" said Ms Johnstone. Swainston carried out the attack while being the subject of a suspended sentence order for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.\nBoth aged 33, Pearson, of no fixed abode, and Swainston, of Durham Road in Thorpe Thewles, pleaded guilty to assaulting a police officer. The judge gave Pearson a three-month prison sentence which will be added to his current jail stretch while Swainston was jailed for 21 days.\nLee Dooley\nA man stalked a woman over several months by repeatedly calling her and showing up at her home and workplace. Lee Dooley, 38, from Middlesbrough, began stalking the victim towards the end of 2024 as his behaviour towards her continued to escalate.\nHe made threatening calls to the victim, her family and friends and threatened to smash her windows, even showing up outside the victim’s home. During one terrifying incident, Dooley entered her house and sexually assaulted her.\nThe victim bravely reported what had happened to police in June 2025 and an investigation was launched. Dooley was arrested and charged with stalking with fear of violence and sexual assault and he appeared at Teesside Magistrates’ Court where he pleaded guilty to the charges.\nHe appeared at Teesside Crown Court on Tuesday, July 15, where he was sentenced to 28 months in prison. Dooley was also made subject to a 15-year restraining order and placed on the Sex Offender's register for 10 years.\nMartin Wilson\nA serial burglar removed the anti-theft pedal and drove away in a Land Rover Defender from outside its owner's Darlington home. Martin Wilson, 38, also smashed his way into a Jet petrol station on Carmel Road South - and left with £3,000 worth of vapes, cigarettes and chocolate.\nNext he broke into The Croft Hotel on Northallerton Road and pushed past the night manager, to get away with a Galaxy tablet and alcohol. Wilson's latest crime spree has resulted in another prison sentence.\nTeesside Crown Court heard that on June 30, last year, at 4.30am, Wilson and two other males arrived at Coniscliffe Road in Darlington, on mountain bikes. They broke into the Land Rover - but when they discovered the vehicle had been fitted with an anti-theft pedal lock - the men disappeared.\nThey returned a while later with various tools and took the pedal lock off. The men hot-wired the car and drove off. The Land Rover was found abandoned in Redcar the next day. Over £1,600 of damage had been done to the SUV.\nWilson was arrested days later, and granted bail while police investigated. On October 28, Wilson was captured arriving at Clearance Bargains in Darlington, on a moped, with another man. They tried to tried to smash the external window covers off the shop, but left when they couldn't get in.\nOn May 6, Wilson smashed his way into the Jet Garage on Carmel Road South. He emptied the cash till of £100; and took £200 from the safe. He walked out with an additional £3,000 worth of vapes, cigarettes and chocolate.\nA few hours later, Wilson was accosted by the night manager at The Croft Hotel, as he poured alcohol into a drinks caddy. He had forced the hotel door open with a chisel and after pushing past the member of staff, he ran out into the night with a Galaxy tablet; the caddy full of alcohol and the staff tips jar.\nWilson, of no fixed address in Darlington, pleaded guilty to the two burglaries; attempted burglary; and the theft of a vehicle. He has a long criminal history which includes four burglaries; and 167 separate thefts. Judge Francis Laird jailed Wilson for 19 months.\nAnthony Douglas and Neil Willis\nA pair who raped a girl in the 1980s and abused others have been caged for almost 30 years. The female victim was raped and sexually assaulted by Neil Willis and Anthony Douglas.\nThey also sexually abused a boy, while Willis also assaulted two other young children. The two rapists were living in Peterlee, north of Hartlepool, at the time of the abuse, with Willis, formerly known as Neil Blenkinsop, aged between 14 and 17, and Douglas aged 19 to 20.\nPolice said their offending came to light when one of the victims - now an adult - told police what happened to him in 2019, police said. An investigation was launched by Durham Constabulary, which led to three further abuse survivors coming forward and disclosing that they too had been abused. The pair were charged with a string of sexual offences.\nWillis, aged 57, of Kenilworth Road, Ealing, London, admitted some charges and was found guilty of others, including rape, indecent assault, a serious sexual assault, and gross indecency with a child following a two-and-a-half-week trial at Newcastle Crown Court earlier this year.\nDouglas, of Sheriff Street, Hartlepool, denied all offences, but the 58-year-old was found guilty of several counts of rape, indecent assault, and gross indecency with a child. The pair appeared at Newcastle Crown Court on Monday, July 14, for sentencing; Willis was jailed for 13 years, while Douglas was jailed for 16 years with a one-year extended licence.\nMckenzie Dicicco\nA Teesside footballer who killed another non-League player in a \"cowardly\" one-punch attack after a \"nonsensical argument\" at a railway station has been jailed. Mckenzie Dicicco, 22, hit married father-of-one James Hitchcock from behind while he was eating at Burger King at York station after a day out with friends.\nMr Hitchcock, 32, who was a goalkeeper for Barton Town FC, in North Lincolnshire, suffered a fatal head injury and died in hospital three days later. On Wednesday Dicicco, who has played at Thornaby, Northallerton and Pickering football clubs, was jailed for six years and eight months after pleading guilty to manslaughter.\nLeeds Crown Court heard the two men did not know each other until their paths crossed at York station on December 15, last year. Mr Hitchcock, who had a six-month-old son, had travelled from his home in Cottingham in East Yorkshire for a day out with a group of friends, while Dicicco had come from Middlesbrough with his girlfriend and two friends.\nThe court heard Dicicco became drunk during the day, and at one point was thrown out of a pop-up bar in York Museum Gardens. Paul Greaney KC, prosecuting, said Dicicco, of Dibdale Gardens, Middlesbrough, was waiting for his train home, eating some food he brought from the station's Sainsbury's shop, when Mr Hitchcock and his friends walked past and Mr Hitchcock appeared to point in the general direction of the defendant's group.\nMr Greaney said: \"That gesture is difficult to interpret and not explained in the evidence but does not appear to be aggressive. This immediately grabbed the defendant's attention.\" The court heard words were exchanged between Mr Hitchcock's group and Dicicco, who \"squared up to them\" and resisted efforts to calm him down.\nMr Greaney said Mr Hitchcock could be seen on CCTV approaching the defendant \"with palms open, not offering any violence\", ultimately going into Sainsbury's with his friends and waiting there until the coast was clear and the defendant had gone to his platform.\nThe court heard Dicicco attempted to go back and was clearly agitated, spotting Mr Hitchcock at Burger King before his girlfriend pulled him away. Mr Greaney said Dicicco's train was delayed from 8.36pm to 8.43pm, and so he \"knew he had a 10-minute window of time\" when he left the platform and walked back towards the concourse.\nThe defendant later claimed he wanted to go to the toilet and buy water for the journey, and had not decided to confront Mr Hitchcock until he saw him, but prosecutors rejected that account, saying he had already bought water and had just relieved himself next to a fully functioning vending machine that had water in it.\nThe court heard Dicicco walked directly to Burger King, rotated his right hand as if to loosen his wrist and \"delivered a forceful punch\" with his right fist to the right of Mr Hitchcock's head. In a victim personal statement read in court, Mr Hitchcock's wife April Hitchcock said her husband \"was robbed of the opportunity to defend himself\".\nShe said: \"James was the type of person who would light up a room with his warming presence, enthusiasm and infectious laugh.\"\nGareth Dobie\nA crack drug dealer had more than £150,000 credited to his bank account in various deposits over the course of a year. Gareth Dobie, 45, also received universal credit and carer's allowance into his Halifax account, as he spent his time selling crack cocaine and cocaine. He was caught after police, acting on intelligence, raided a Hartlepool home.\nDobie was at the house on Oval Grange when it was searched earlier this year. He had £300 in his jacket pocket; and there were small plastic sealed bags containing cocaine in the home. His mobile phone showed text messages customers had sent Dobie, asking to buy crack cocaine and pay him later.\nPolice drug experts found that the plastic bags containing .6 gram deals of cocaine hydrochloride would have sold for £50 each. Further investigations into Dobie's bank account revealed a total of £150,000 had been paid in between March 2024 and March of this year.\nDobie, of Inch Grove, Owton Manor, Hartlepool, later pleaded guilty to two counts of supplying class A drugs and acquiring criminal property. He has previous convictions for selling cannabis; and for the possession of crack cocaine.\nIn mitigation Kate Barnes told the court that Dobie suffers from depression and anxiety and that he began taking drugs to \"alleviate his symptoms.\" Ms Barnes said that the initial outlay for purchasing drugs \"is large and Mr Dobie had £2,000 left in his account - not withstanding the sums that had passed through it.\"\nJudge Thomas Moran told Dobie that he had been \"a busy back street dealer\" and locked him up for five years. A proceeds of crime application was approved, to confiscate the illegal profits from his drug dealing business.\nRonald Barnbrook\nA convicted sex offender took photos of children around a swimming pool in Tenerife. Ronald Barnbrook, 73, flew to the island in November last year, without letting the police know about his last minute holiday.\nThe paedophile lives under a court order which means he must let the police know at least seven days before he travels anywhere. Barnbrook was made subject to a sexual harm prevention order over eight years ago, when he was sentenced for sexually abusing children. He served three years in prison.\nThe parents of the children on holiday had no idea what Barnbrook had done. The pensioner's sick photos were only found after Border Force officers notified the police that he had boarded the flight out of Newcastle Airport, headed for Tenerife last year.\nPolice turned up at Barnbrook's Middlesbrough home earlier this year. When they asked to see his phone, there was a stored photo of a young girl in a bikini.\nThe phone was seized and police found 28 more pictures - some of naked children and others showing little girls in swimwear around the pool. Teesside Crown Court has heard that the \"candid\" pensioner admitted to his probation officer that he performed sex acts over photos of children.\nMitigating, Nigel Soppitt told the court that Barnbrook \"admits he has this repugnant and unhealthy compulsion\" and that he has kept to the terms of his court order for the last eight years. Barnbrook, of Park Road South in central Middlesbrough, was jailed for 22 months.\nPaul Swales\nA starving homeless man walked into Middlesbrough's Pizza Hut and helped himself to a pizza from the oven. Paul Swales, 38, told a started employee: \"Stay f****** there! Don't f****** move or I'll f****** stab you!.\"\nThe member of staff couldn't see a knife, but later said that Swales was holding the hot pizza with two hands and he wasn't sure if there was a knife in his pocket. Swales ran out of the restaurant on May 4 with his pizza, and he was later identified from CCTV footage.\nTeesside Crown Court has heard that when he was arrested the next day, he said: \"What? For nicking a f****** pizza when you're starving? I've got no credit, why do you think I'm nicking pizzas?\"\nJudge Nathan Adams jailed Swales, now of Longcroft Walk in Brambles Farm, Middlesbrough, for 22 months.\nSteven Munslow\nA Hartlepool drug dealer has been locked up after he was caught with 36 bags of crack cocaine, packaged for sale. Steven Munslow was caught when his Hartlepool home was raided by police.\nThe 49-year-old told officers to, \"f*** off\" as they searched through his belongings on April 27. Teesside Crown Court has heard that other drug users were in the house smoking crack, when the police arrived. The police uncovered 36 small bags, each containing 0.2 grams of crack cocaine.\nThe bags would have sold for £740 in total. Munslow later pleaded guilty to the possession of a class A drug, with intent to supply, at Teesside Magistrates' Court. He has previous convictions for possessing cannabis and heroin; and for burglary. He said that he had started taking crack cocaine \"to cope\" after his mother passed away.\nHe then began selling the drug to friends and to other users, in order to raise cash to fund his own habit. Munslow, of Rugby Street in Hartlepool, was jailed for two-years.\nKai Beattie\nA drug-fuelled danger driver who led police on three high speed chases across Teesside has been locked up. Kai Beattie, who the judge said has \"amassed a record of previous convictions which any well known criminal would have been proud to have achieved at his age\", admitted a string of driving offences between February and April 2025.\nThe 18-year-old led police on three pursuits through Hartlepool and Redcar. One of which the judge said: \"It was little short of a miracle no one else was injured least of all you given the circumstances of the offences.\"\nChris Morrison, prosecuting, outlined at Teesside Crown Court the details of the offence which span four dates - one in January and three in April. On January 15, officers spotted a vehicle which was believed to be recently stolen.\nWhile being followed the vehicle made off and mounted kerbs in a residential area to avoid buses blocking the road during the incident shortly before 12pm. Beattie was travelling at high speeds and caused other road users to stop but no collision occurred.\nMr Morrison said: \"The car blocked itself in due to the traffic and tried to do a U turn and found it could go no further.\" Beattie tried to make off on foot but was apprehended shortly after.\nBeattie, who was 17 at the time, was over the limit for drugs and had 800mg of benzoylecgonine, a breakdown product of cocaine, in his system. The legal limit is 50mg per litre of blood.\nOn April 4, Beattie was found with three small bags of cocaine in his trouser pocket when he was stopped by police in Redcar. Two days later, he was spotted driving a motorcycle dangerously in Corporation Road, Redcar, at around 7.40pm by a plain clothes patrol officer.\nMr Morrison said: \"He drove towards oncoming traffic and was riding onto the footpath causing members of the public to have to move out of the way.\" At the time he had a passenger on the bike, who he dropped off. He then started to do \"wheelies\". He was pursued and rode off and was spotted by another police vehicle, he drove onto the footpath and over a grassed area to avoid police.\nHe was doing \"wheelies in the middle of the road\" and a \"car had to brake to avoid a collision\". He was pursued by a police vehicle but the chase was abandoned so not to endanger the general public.\nIn the early hours of April 17, Beattie led police on a 24 minute chase - which saw the teenager brought to a stop after the vehicle hit a stinger and was boxed in by police officers, who drove into the vehicle forcing it into a 180 degree spin.\nHe topped speeds of 70mph in a 30mph residential zone. At one stage, in what Mr Morrison described as a \"race track phenomenon\", the pursuing vehicle was travelling at 108mph and was \"barely keeping up with it\".\n\"It is little short of a miracle that the roads were so clear for this very protracted course of action,\" he said. Beattie went the wrong way around roundabouts and drove into the path of an oncoming vehicle although no collision occurred.\nBeattie, whose eyes were glazed and speech slurred, had to be pulled through the drivers window to be arrested and was found with ammonia. Beattie, of Foxrush Close, Middlesbrough, was jailed for 15 months. He was also banned from driving for three years and seven months.\nBradley Hall\nBradley Hall is beginning a stretch of over four years behind bars following a sentencing at Teesside Crown Court. The 27-year-old was convicted of a number of child sex offences including child rape, causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and child sex assault.\nHall was sentenced for a total of 12 charges at Teesside Crown Court. He was jailed for four years and six months for his crimes. Hall, from Darlington, was also given an indefinite Sexual Harm Prevention Order.\nNicola Leonard\nA career criminal was caught when she was captured on CCTV in a garage, wearing another woman's clothes and using a stolen credit card. Nicola Leonard, 43, was dressed in the clothes of a woman whose Saltburn home was burgled hours earlier.\nLeonard walked into a garage in Marske and used banks cards belonging to a second woman who was dog-sitting in the burgled home, on April 14. Teesside Crown Court has heard that the second victim realised her purse was missing from her handbag, and when she checked her banking app, she saw her card was being used at Marske services and at Lord Street Store in Redcar.\nJenny Haigh, prosecuting, said that Marske service station sent the victim a CCTV image of the woman who had used her bank cards. When her friend returned home to Bath Street, she looked at the photo and saw that the woman in the picture - Nicola Leonard - was dressed in her green puffa jacket and other clothes.\nThe homeowner realised she had been burgled whilst her friend was there asleep. The homeowner's jewellery - including an 18-carat gold necklace and some pearls - were gone. Her 75-year-old friend was heartbroken when she discovered a gold ring was missing from her handbag.\nShe said that she had put the ring, which had a triple black opal stone, in her bag because she planned to give it to her granddaughter the next day. The woman said that she had bought the precious stone in Australia 40 years earlier, for £800, and that she \"wanted to see her granddaughter enjoy her inheritance whilst I am alive.\"\nThe woman said her ring is now worth £20,000 and that her insurance company wouldn't pay out for it \"because of the nature of the break-in\" at her friend's home where she was dog-sitting. Leonard denied being responsible for the burglary but she later admitted using the two bank cards in the frauds; and to handling stolen goods.\nJudge Timothy Stead jailed Leonard, of Bolckow Road in Grangetown, Middlesbrough, for 32-months.\nDavid Fergus\nA controlling and violent partner turned up outside the window of an A&E department after breaking his girlfriend's jaw. David Fergus, 39, punched his long-term partner in the face in November last year, after she refused to hand over more money.\nAs she waited to be treated at James Cook university Hospital, in Middlesbrough, he knocked on the window and asked her to come outside. He demanded more cash and took his partner's phone to transfer funds to his own account.\nEleven months earlier, Fergus, previously known as David Young, punched his girlfriend repeatedly in the arm when she refused to give him money. Teesside Crown Court heard he turned violent in the last four years of the couple's 11-year relationship.\nHis former partner described him as \"paranoid and aggressive\" after he started abusing drugs. She said she was left \"mentally exhausted\" when he came into her room late at night asking for money; and that he asked her relatives for cash at her mother's funeral.\nFergus, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm; grievous bodily harm; making a threat to kill; coercive control; and criminal damage. Fergus was jailed for 51 months.\nLiam Blackburn\nLiam Blackburn took offense at being asked to pay £3.70 upfront for his taxi journey in Thorntree and said it should only be £3.50. His anger spiralled and he hurled abuse at the driver before firing a BB gun at his taxi - which saw one window shatter as the dad tried to escape.\nYears later, the 22-year-old wielded a machete at the Sporting Lodge Inns Hotel, in Low Lane, Stainton, in September 2024. This was weeks before his fingerprints were found on a loaded and ready to fire shotgun found upon his arrest.\nSam Faulks, prosecuting, said, in February 2022, Blackburn got into a taxi and was asked by the driver to pay up front, in line with the firm's policy. He began arguing it should be £3.50 - 20p below the fare requested by the victim.\nHe handed him £10 but as he tried to sort his change Blackburn told the driver to drive, said Mr Faulks. \"He called him a c*** and threatened to smash him in\".\nBlackburn got out of the car, leaving the door open, so the driver got out to close it. He was then \"racially abused by a number of women in the street\" before Blackburn appeared with a \"small black glock type handgun\" and began firing it at the taxi.\nIt was an air weapon handgun but Teesside Crown Court heard that as the victim drove away one of the windows shattered. The passenger side window had a \"clear hole in it\".\nWhile on police bail, on September 29, 2024, Blackburn and another person arrived at the rear of the Sporting Lodge Inn Hotel, in Stainton, in a taxi. Blackburn emerged with a large machete and they went into the rear of the bar area.\n\"He reappeared followed by the assailant who was carrying a bag. People in the bar would not engage with police,\" Mr Faulks said. But Blackburn was identified by an officer from CCTV footage.\n\"On October 24, he was at his father's address in Stockton. Armed police officers attended to arrest him,\" said Mr Faulks. Officers found a bag in the garden which had inside a sawn off shotgun which was \"loaded and ready to fire\".\nAnalysis showed Blackburn's fingerprints were among those on the gun and he was charged with conspiracy to possess a firearm - prohibited weapon.\nBlackburn was jailed for five years and was made subject to a criminal behaviour order upon his release. This will prevent him from associating with named individuals and attending \"well known hotbeds of drug dealing and weapon offences\".\nRoss Bradbury\nTeesside Crown Court was told that despite earning around £3,000-a-month, Ross Bradbury was a drug addict and started selling cocaine to fund his habit, making around £2,000 a month. The 37-year-old was arrested after police went to his Eaglescliffe home and found a tub of cocaine and a phone with contacts and messages for his drug dealing.\nBradbury, appeared before the court to be sentenced after previously admitting a charge of supplying cocaine between June 2023 and August 2024 and possession of criminal property in the sum of £27,173.12. The prosecuting barrister told the court that in August, last year, police went to the home of Bradbury and he told them to 'search the kitchen cupboards'. They said: \"He told them he did not deal drugs and it was just for his friends.\"\nHowever, the officers found 40.8g of cocaine, which had a street value of between £2,050 and £4,100. They also found the phone which had a number of people getting drugs from the defendant.\nThe prosecutor said they checked his bank history and found his salary of around £3,000, but also a number of cash deposits which equalled out at around £2,000 a month.\nThe defending barrister said Bradbury, whose address was given as Nairn Close, Darlington, had been suffering from a depressive disorder before getting involved with drugs. Judge Sherwin sentenced Bradbury to 30 months in prison.\nHamed Kianipanah\nA rapist has been jailed after 'grooming and controlling' his victim. A jury found Hamed Kianipanah, 36, guilty of raping the woman following a trial at Teesside Crown Court.\nKianipanah was sent to prison for nine years plus an additional three years on license for raping a woman at an address in Richmondshire in 2022. Following a trial at Teesside Crown Court, Kianipanah was found guilty on June 5 of having unconsented sex with the victim.\nThe jury heard evidence that Kianipanah had groomed and controlled the woman around the time of the rape. However, she found the courage to make a report to North Yorkshire Police in 2023. This sparked a two-year investigation led by Temporary Detective Sergeant Quita Readman from Hambleton and Richmondshire CID.\nLisa Lithgo and Janette Dowson\nTwo women who were overheard concocting their story on a 999 call after a 24-year-old man was stabbed to death in a Hartlepool bungalow have been jailed. Lisa Lithgo, 38, and Janette Dowson, 58, have been locked up for two years and 18 months respectively after admitting conspiring to pervert the course of justice. It follows the murder of Kieran Wood, on May 22, 2023.\nTeesside Crown Court heard how suspect Paul Foster took his own life before he could be arrested over Mr Wood's death. The 24-year-old victim, from Horden, was working as a drugs runner and was making a delivery to an address on Spurn Walk, in the Burbank area of Hartlepool, following a request from Lithgo.\nTeesside Crown Court heard Mr Foster had \"no intention of paying for the drugs\" and Mr Wood had been \"set up to be robbed\". Mr Wood died in the house after he was brutally attacked - he suffered nine sab wounds to his chest, legs and arm.\nThe court heard previously how at 2.47pm, almost an hour before Mr Wood arrived at the bungalow, Mr Foster had called 999, and said: \"I've got my ex torturing me, right. I'm going to shoot her, right. I'm going to peg her ears. The biggest mistake Raoul Moat made was shooting himself.\"\nThree days earlier, Mr Foster had been released from prison and had called his probation officer on May 22, to cancel his appointment, saying that he had split up from his partner. Instead he went to the bungalow, where Janette Dowson lived with Kenneth Dowson, who has since died, and Lisa Lithgo.\nDr Christopher Wood, prosecuting, told the court at a hearing in June that Lithgo arranged to buy £300 of cocaine from a dealer known as \"Turkish\". Dr Wood said the deal was a set up by Mr Foster - who intended on robbing and attacking whoever arrived with the drugs.\nMr Wood was stabbed to death and the court heard how Lithgo hugged and kissed Mr Foster before he fled the scene. Mr Dowson called 999 but \"he and the two [women] were completely unaware that the phone line remained open.\"\nLithgo, of Wilson Street, Hartlepool, was jailed for two years and Dowson, of Grange Road, Hartlepool, was jailed for 18 months.\nDaniel Scott\nA man has been jailed for more than eight years after a jury found him guilty of attempted rape and three sex assaults.\nDaniel Scott will remain on the sex offender's register for the rest of his life. The 40-year-old had denied the charges but was found guilty by a jury at Teesside Crown Court.\nOn Monday, July 28, Scott, of Cranwell Grove, Thornaby, appeared at the court for sentencing. He was sentenced to a total of eight and a half years behind bars and a restraining order was made indefinitely.",
