  "body_text": "IN mid-April 2021, the Electoral Management Board for Scotland announced that applications for postal votes had closed and that provisional figures from Scotland’s Electoral Registration Officers showed that 1,010,638 voters were registered to vote by post at the Scottish Parliament election on May 6, 2021.\nThis accounted for nearly one-quarter of the electorate (23.8%) and was the highest number ever registered for a postal vote in Scotland.\nAt a recent council by-election the turnout was 22%. Given the number of voters who are still able to vote by post has probably not reduced by a significant factor, this would imply that even many postal voters chose to put the postal voting papers sent to them in the bin rather than make use of them.\nA very substantial percentage of the rest of the electorate simply could not be bothered to leave their homes to cast their vote in the traditional manner.\nAs we approach the May election, the Scottish Information Commissioner is challenging John Swinney’s Scottish Government in court to release files related to the investigation into Nicola Sturgeon because the Government has failed to obey the Information Commissioner’s ruling to publish it.\nIronically, at the same time Mr Swinney is calling for transparency on the thorny subject of Labour’s Lord Mandelson.\nI rather suspect this form of political tit-for-tat is going a long way to suppressing the inclination of the average voter to cast a vote and encouraging them to at least consider the possibility of voting Reform.\nMore than half of the Scottish electorate is female and I fear many of them might be puzzled by the SNP’s controversial policy of housing dangerous men in women’s prisons and the Government’s lack of support for Ash Regan’s prostitution bill.\nThe hundreds of thousands on NHS waiting lists must be viewing the current hospital infection controversy with some degree of alarm.\nIn the short time left until early May, is it too much to hope that the SNP might switch to a positive election campaign message? We need a message that sets out an attractive, bigger, bolder vision of an independent Scotland with plausible explanations of, at the very least, the questions of currency, pensions and the economy.\nThe SNP’s recent theme of “100 days to get rid of Starmer” will certainly not set the proverbial heather on fire – especially if Mr Starmer is gone long before the 100 days are up.\nOpinion polls currently show the SNP leading the pack, with the Unionist vote split between Reform, Tory, LibDems and Labour, but opinion polls do not tend to reflect those demoralised with politics in general and the SNP leadership in particular.\nThe problem for the SNP is that a continuation of their current lacklustre, negative, defensive campaign will lead to a proportionally lower turnout of SNP supporters.\nJohn Baird\nTUESDAY was a significant day in the House of Commons, significant because child poverty was on the agenda and in particular the Labour Government’s U-turn on removing the two-child limit on benefits, as it received its second reading.\nRemoving the cap is a significant move in tackling child poverty and inequality. Welcomed as this move is, however, the Labour Government could and should be going much further.\nThe Conservatives’ contribution to the debate in the Commons was shameful, as their position was to oppose the abolition of the cap. Shame on them.\nBut returning to the Labour Government’s lack of action, when are they introducing a “child payment” for all children throughout the UK, similar to that which has been in place in Scotland since 2021? And what about the roll-out of the baby box in all parts of the UK?\nThose moves are positive, despite the Scottish Government having limited welfare powers. Welfare is largely reserved to Westminster but Scotland, with the limited devolved welfare powers it has, has introduced legislation that has seen it become the only part of the UK where child poverty is reducing. Full welfare powers need to be devolved urgently, so much more can be done for upcoming generations.\nCatriona C Clark\nP DAVIDSON (Letters, Feb 5) makes valid points in arguing for reform of Council Tax but comes to the wrong conclusion that “a local income tax is the best answer”.\nAs with many issues facing the SNP within the confines of the current UK governmental structure, matters are not as straightforward as they would appear to be to the general public (and even some independence supporters).\nUnder the current UK fiscal framework, which governs devolved funding, any transfer of tax-raising powers from Westminster to Holyrood is accompanied by an adjustment to the “block grant” (return of a portion of Scotland’s taxes). This in effect means the Scottish Government and councils would not gain much-needed funds from an increase in revenue from a local income tax over income from Council Tax as currently raised.\nUnless the UK Treasury and the UK Government can be persuaded otherwise (which appears unlikely given the evident hostility of the Labour Party to progressing devolution in Scotland) then an alternative must be sought, presumably through some form of land value tax, which I understand the Scottish Government is working to introduce, albeit seemingly more slowly than many would wish.\nOf course Council Tax reform would be hastened if Scotland were independent.\nStan Grodynski\nLongniddry, East Lothian\nI HOPE Jim Todd of Cumbernauld (Letters, Feb 5) is happy with today’s football coverage and The National’s one-and-a-half pages plus a 3/4 back page is sufficient. I do hope that Hibs and Dundee United supporters aren’t too upset by only having a half page but they, unlike the Old Firm, are probably used to it.\nPress coverage for the so-called lesser teams is limited to the occasions when they have the audacity to beat the so-called big teams as was shown in St Mirren’s victories in the League Cup Final and against league leaders, Hearts, this week.\nKate Armstrong\nGlenfarg",
