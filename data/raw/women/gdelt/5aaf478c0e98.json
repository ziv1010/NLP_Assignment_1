The comedian and actor is tasked with teaching England’s men and women’s players about fuelling, prepping, and recovering like champions.\nWhitehall has teamed up with M&S Food as part of the Football Association’s The Greater Game initiative, which aims to inspire 12-16-year-olds to improve their health and wellbeing. Whitehall has handed out advice to Lionesses Grace Clinton, Mary Earps, and Alessia Russo, as well as Three Lions stars Jordan Pickford, Declan Rice and Ollie Watkins.\nThe comedian offered tips on sports science, recovery techniques and meal plans and showed that everyone can eat better by learning from professional athletes. Whitehall’s new role comes in response to research carried out by M&S Food, which showed that many parents are unsure how to fuel their football-playing children.\nSeven in 10 parents said that crisps were the favoured pre-match option, while yoghurt pouches and smoothies were also popular. At half time, one in 20 (5%) provide their kids with energy drinks and high energy snack balls (80%).\nHowever, natural sugars in the form of fruit still seems to be the favoured half time boost for 93% of children. Post-match, cereal bars (87%) and smoothies (86%) came out as some of the most common choices with one in 12 (8%) giving their children chocolate and more energy packed drinks (7%).\nDespite being aware of the importance of healthy eating, many parents still struggle to get enough fruit and vegetables into their children’s diets. 41% of parents admitted they find it difficult to incorporate the recommended amount, while 68% said they would be more likely to choose products containing ‘hidden’ fruit and vegetables to make healthy eating easier.\nTo help young players fuel like the pros, M&S and The FA have developed three easy-to-follow eating approaches based on training intensity. Before a match or intense session, players follow a 3-1-1 structure — three portions of carbs, one protein, and one veg — to maximise energy stores. After a game, it shifts to 2-2-2, balancing carbs, protein and veg to aid muscle recovery and reduce inflammation. On lighter or rest days, the 3-2-1 mix prioritises fruit and veg to support immunity and overall wellness.\n“By looking at how professional footballers fuel themselves, we can see just how important nutrition is to energy, performance and recovery,” explains Sophia Linn, lead M&S nutritionist who is working with the FA on the Eat Well, Play Well project. \"Footballers adjust their diet based on activity. Before a match, they increase their intake of carbohydrates to boost energy levels, while post-match, the focus shifts to protein for muscle repair and recovery. On rest days, they prioritize micronutrients from fruit and veg. The key takeaway? Rather than a rigid diet, it's about adapting your diet to fuel your body for whatever you're doing. From the pitch to the playground, we can learn a thing or two from our national heroes… and perhaps something from Jack Whitehall too. Maybe.\"\nDr Christopher Rosimus, the England FA’s performance and nutrition lead added: \"What young players eat before and after a match plays a crucial role in their energy levels, focus, and recovery. With ‘Food Formations,’ we’re introducing a simple, structured approach to nutrition that helps players fuel their bodies effectively throughout the week.\n\"By periodising nutrition and adapting food intake based on training intensity and recovery needs, we ensure players get the right balance of carbohydrates, protein, and essential nutrients at the right time. This system makes it easier for young athletes and their families to optimise performance, whether it’s for match day, training, or rest and recovery.\"\n“As I cast my eye over the England teams’ nutrition when I visited St George’s Park —for a brief moment—I did my best to revolutionise healthy eating and nutrition,” said Whitehall.\n“And, surprisingly, I actually picked up a few useful tricks along the way. Understanding how elite athletes fuel their bodies—whether it’s loading up on the right carbs before a game or using protein to help recovery has definitely made me rethink my own approach to food and training. Even the ice bath wasn’t as bad as I expected… eventually. Food Formations’ is a brilliant way to make nutrition simple, not just for pro players but for parents and kids too.”",
