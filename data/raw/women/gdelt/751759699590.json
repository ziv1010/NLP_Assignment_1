This Joshua Harmon play follows Sherri Rosen-Mason, the head of the admissions department at a New England prep school, as she fights to diversify the student body. Alongside her husband, the school’s headmaster, they’ve largely succeeded in bringing a stodgy institution into the 21st century. But when the Ivy League college of his choice passes over their only son for a less qualified minority student, personal ambition collides with progressive values, with convulsive results.\n”Admissions” received the 2018 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play and the 2018 Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding New Off-Broadway Play. “Admissions” was featured on Gulf Coast Life; listen/read here. This week’s performances are Wednesday, Jan. 22 at 7:30 p.m.; Thursday, Jan. 23 at 7:30 p.m.; Friday, Jan. 24 at 7:30 p.m.; Saturday, Jan. 25 at 3 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.; and Sunday’s closing 3 p.m. matinee.

But when his carefully laid plan goes awry, everyone gets caught in a twisted web of blackmail, passion, and revenge. A fresh take on the edge-of-your-seat mystery that inspired Alfred Hitchcock’s masterpiece, this suspense-filled story proves that a stunning thriller never goes out of style.

Troy now works as a garbage man in 1957 Pittsburgh. Excluded from the major leagues in his prime, Troy has grown increasingly bitter, and his anger and frustration take a toll on his wife, Rose, and his son, Cory, who now wants his own chance to play football professionally. In August Wilson's hands, Troy rises to the level of an epic hero. Deemed a \"generational play,\" it mirrors the classic struggle of status quo, tradition and age, versus change, innovation, and youth.

His sister June returns home to help her family and finds that her father has disappeared, her mother is refusing to leave her bedroom, and her sister Audre is doing everything in her power to control public perceptions of Amiri’s death.

This 1920s whodunit has everything you never wanted in a show—an unconscious leading lady, a corpse that can’t play dead, and actors who trip over everything (including their lines).
