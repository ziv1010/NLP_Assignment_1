  "body_text": "THE suspect accused of assassinating Donald Trump ally Charlie Kirk was a star student who secured an elite scholarship years before his arrest.\nEerie video shows high-achiever Tyler Robinson, 22, reading out a letter of acceptance for a university presidential scholarship while his mother applauds, years before he took a political turn.\nIn 2021, the southern Utah native attended Utah State University in Logan, approximately two hours from Salt Lake City, for one semester, the school confirmed.\nBefore he moved to campus, his mom posted a video of the teenager reading his award letter for the Utah State’s resident presidential scholarship, which covers all tuition and fees and is only offered to top applicants.\nThe teen appeared to be at home and was dressed in a plain maroon T-shirt and jeans as he said, “Congratulations, you have been selected to receive the resident presidential scholarship from Utah State University.”\nThe letter stated that the scholarship’s value was approximately $32,000 and would apply to all four years of school.\nread more on this case\nRobinson’s excited mother screamed out, “Woo!” after the teen read the note, and he joined her in celebration.\nAccording to the university’s website, students applying for the 2025-26 school year must have a minimum 3.75 high school GPA and a 33 on the ACT or 1450 on the SAT to earn the top-tier scholarship.\nWhat we know so far:\n- Suspected assassin Tyler Robinson has been taken into custody after a sweeping manhunt\n- He was turned in after he confessed to his dad\n- Chilling footage shows the suspect fleeing after the shooting\n- Pictures and video released by the FBI show a person of interest wearing a black long-sleeved shirt and sunglasses\n- The student speaking to Kirk as he died broke his silence\n- Charlie Kirk’s body was taken back to his hometown in Arizona\n- Kirk’s widow, Erika, was seen for the first time since his death\n- Two people previously taken into custody were released, including an elderly man hauled from the scene in handcuffs\n- The FBI offered a $100,000 reward for information\n- Utah’s governor said officials will seek the death penalty for the shooter\n- Trump posthumously awarded Kirk the Medal of Freedom\nMost read in The US Sun\nRobinson only attended Utah State for one semester before abruptly dropping out and moving back home with his parents.\nThe eerie video comes as Robinson’s grandmother described her grandson as a shy and “wonderful child” who never “could be violent.”\nSHOOTING HORROR\nKirk, 31, was killed on Wednesday afternoon as he hosted an outdoor Q&A at Utah Valley University in Orem with his multi-million dollar nonprofit Turning Point USA.\nThe influential activist brought a massive crowd to the event, where he debated with students and shared his conservative takes on current events and policy issues.\nRobinson was arrested on Thursday night in his hometown St. George, about 250 miles away from the shooting scene, after a family friend reported him to the cops.\nOn Friday, Utah Governor Spencer Cox said the suspect allegedly plotted the assassination extensively online and wrote hateful messages on bullets found in the believed murder weapon.\nFour cartridges were uncovered in the hunting rifle that was found in a wooded area near a gravel-filled rooftop where the shooter is believed to have taken aim at Kirk.\nOne bullet casing read, “Oh, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao Ciao Ciao,” which are lyrics to a popular Italian anti-fascist song sung during World War II.\nAnother said, “Hey fascist! Catch!”\nGRANDMOTHER’S CHILLING DENIAL\nRobinson’s grandmother Debbie Robinson was left horrified by the news of her grandson’s arrest, as she insisted he could never be capable of such violence.\n“I don’t think he ever shot a gun, to tell you the truth,” she told the Daily Mail – despite social media pictures appearing to show the suspect posing with firearms.\n“He doesn’t hunt, he’s never liked anything like that. I know he doesn’t own any guns.\n“There’s just no way he could have been that good of a shot.”\nWriting found on Tyler Robinson's ammunition\nUtah Governor Spencer Cox read out a list of messages that were found engraved on suspect Tyler Robinson's bullet casings. The words seem to reference online gaming culture and antifascist ideology. Below are some of the inscriptions that have been revealed and their possible meanings:\n- “‘Hey fascist! Catch!’ followed by up arrow, right arrow, and three down arrow symbols” – controller button instructions to release a bomb in the video game Helldivers.\n- “Bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao” – lyrics from an Italian song used as a rally cry for anti-fascist resistance fighters during WWII.\n- “If you read this you are gay LMAO” – LMAO stands for laughing my ass off.\n- “Notices bulges OWO what’s this?” – an internet meme used by gamers referencing furries and animated videos.\nThe cartridges were found next to the gun that officials say was used to kill Charlie Kirk.\nDebbie said Robinson grew up in a staunchly Republican family, and that his parents were both devout Trump supporters.\nThe young man rarely talked politics with her and wasn’t known to struggle with mental health issues, she said.\n“He’s a wonderful child,” the heartbroken grandmother said.\n“There is no way that he could have done anything like this […] He has never, ever gotten in trouble in his life. He’s just a very shy, good kid.”\nONLINE ‘PLOT’\nCox said that a Discord user associated with the name Tyler chatted with online pals about the shooting plot, including potential drop-off points for the rifle.\nIn one message sent after the shooting, the user told a friend that he had changed his clothes and was evading cops.\nFamily members said that Robinson had gotten more political in recent months.\nOne relative who had dinner with him before Wednesday said that he mentioned Kirk by name and discussed disagreeing with his viewpoints.\nOther posts on Robinson’s mom’s Facebook depict the suspect as a happy teenager who enjoyed spending time with family and hunting.\nIn one now-disturbing picture, he appeared to be holding up a massive gun at a show.\nAnd in another post in 2017, Cox wore a Halloween costume that made him look like he was sitting on Trump’s shoulders.\nCharlie Kirk's rise to hero of the youth MAGA movement\nCHARLIE Kirk transformed conservative youth activism from a marginal movement into a powerful force before his assassination on a college campus at 31.\nKirk was an American conservative political activist, author, and media personality who rose to prominence as the co-founder of Turning Point USA (TPUSA).\nHe launched the organization in 2012 when he was just 18 years old, with the goal of promoting conservative principles to high school and college students and became a significant figure in American politics by building a massive grassroots network, framing himself as a “culture warrior.”\nThe rise of Turning Point USA\nTurning Point USA’s mission was to counter what Kirk and his allies saw as liberal dominance on American college campuses.\nIt quickly grew to prominence through his use of provocative activism and viral social media campaigns.\nThey created watchlists of professors pushing leftist propaganda and organized events to debate students on controversial topics.\nThe strategy helped them gain a significant following and financial backing from wealthy conservative donors.\nKirk’s ability to connect with a new generation of conservatives was one of his most notable impacts.\nHe cultivated a style of political engagement that was heavily reliant on social media, podcasts, and confrontational public appearances.\nHis organization’s events, such as the annual Student Action Summit, drew thousands of young attendees and featured prominent conservative speakers, creating a new kind of political ecosystem for young people who felt alienated from traditional conservative groups.\nA key ally of Donald Trump\nKirk also became a staunch supporter and ally of President Donald Trump.\nHe was the youngest speaker at the 2016 Republican National Convention and served as an aide to Donald Trump Jr. during the presidential campaign.\nThis relationship solidified his position within the Republican Party’s “MAGA” (Make America Great Again) wing, and his organization became an integral part of Trump’s political apparatus.\nThrough his popular podcast, “The Charlie Kirk Show,” and his frequent appearances on conservative media, Kirk was a powerful voice in the pro-Trump movement.\nHe often framed political issues as a “spiritual battle” between good and evil and championed a pugnacious, populist form of conservatism.\nHis influence was so significant that after Trump’s 2024 victory, Kirk was credited with helping to mobilize younger voters for the campaign.\nInfluence on culture and social issues\nBeyond traditional politics, Kirk’s influence extended deeply into social and cultural issues.\nHe was a vocal opponent of “woke” ideology, particularly in education and media.\nHe promoted traditional values, often encouraging young women to prioritize becoming homemakers and mothers over professional careers.\nKirk also openly criticized programs related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).\nHe was also a major proponent of Christian nationalism, arguing that there is no true separation of church and state in the United States.\nThe Turning Point Empire\nKirk’s activism led to the expansion of the Turning Point brand into a larger political and media empire.\nHe launched Turning Point Action, a political advocacy group focused on voter mobilization, and Turning Point Faith, aimed at engaging evangelical Christian communities in conservative politics.\nThese affiliated organizations allowed him to broaden his reach and influence beyond college campuses, into a more mainstream political force.\nTRUMP’S FURY\nTrump fumed over left-wing extremists and blamed them for political violence when he was asked about Kirk’s shooting.\n“We have radical left lunatics out there and we just have to beat the hell out of them,” he said in an interview with Fox and Friends on Friday.\nTrump said that he and his supporters are encouraging “nonviolence” and hope that Republicans will dominate in the next round of elections.\nWhen he was asked about the political schism in the US, Trump said, “The radicals on the right oftentimes are radical because they don’t want to see crime.\n“The radicals on the left are the problem, and they’re vicious and they’re horrible and they’re politically savvy.”\nKirk is survived by his wife Erika and their two young children.\nAfter speaking with the widowed mom, Trump said that she is “absolutely devastated.”\nTimeline of Charlie Kirk shooting\nConservative commentator Charlie Kirk was fatally shot in the neck while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday, September
