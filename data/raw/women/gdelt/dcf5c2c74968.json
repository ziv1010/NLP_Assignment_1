We're just a very happy team.\"\nHaving played in countries where English is not the main language has built up the capacities of both Quezada and Cowart to overcome language barriers, while adapting quickly to different football cultures.\n\"Since we've travelled a lot and we've been on different teams, we're used to adjusting, but having a really good culture, coach and staff, and players around us has been so helpful,\" Cowart said.\nReviving her professional career\nFor Western United's Sawicki, she had already let go of her football career before being offered to play for the national team again.\nAfter her stint in Sweden's second division club Elitettan, the 30-year-old midfielder sustained a chronic knee injury, which coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing her to retire from the sport.\nSawicki was already working as a general manager at a soccer training facility and a health and wellness facility without football in her mind, but she was surprised to receive a call from the Filipinas to join their training camp in 2022.\n\"For most people, you get invited to the national team because you're doing well with your club,\" Sawicki said.\n\"I wasn't doing anything at all, but the national team had reached out to me asking if I wanted to come to the next camp. It was a bit of a shock because I wasn't playing professionally anymore.\n\"I just decided to go for it, see how I do, and from there, I just stuck with it and then eventually came back into the professional club environment.\"\nBut in order to prime herself to her best shape before the World Cup, Sawicki knew that she needed to get back into club football.\nBorn and raised in Canada, Sawicki's home country didn't have a professional league either. This led her to take an interest in playing in the A-League Women.\nBy fate, Western United manager Torcaso was looking for a defensive midfielder and reached out to Stajcic, who then recommended Sawicki to join the club.\n\"The timing of that conversation worked out because it came ahead of our AFF championships, in the Philippines,\" Sawicki said.\n\"Mark had the opportunity to watch me play for that whole tournament spell, as well as my past footage, and I guess he felt that I was good enough and offered me a contract from that.\"\nSince joining Western United in August 2022, the Filipino-Canadian has had a positive experience with the team and was named club captain in her debut season.\nNot only has she developed close relationships with her teammates, but the competitiveness of the league gave her a sneak peek to the World Cup.\n\"There are lots of international footballers in the league, so in terms of competition and level of play, I consider it very enjoyable and very competitive, and it was a great platform to prepare me to make the World Cup roster,\" she said.\nRiding on the World Cup fever\nPlaying in a league away from their home countries, the Filipinas have continued to attract the support of the diaspora.\nQuezada shared that she continues to see Filipino fans in Perth waving the flag at their games, and the Filipino community dropped by the airport to welcome the Philippines team playing in the second round of Olympic qualifiers in the city.\nDue to high demand, Football Australia had to move the venue of the recent Filipinas game against the Matildas to Perth Stadium, which attracted a sellout crowd of nearly 60,000 fans.\nWith the presence of the Filipinas in the ALW, they hope to inspire the next generation of Filipino footballers so more of them can make it to the world's top-level competitions as the game grows.\n\"We can help the younger generation in the Philippines get that same support in professional sports. Hopefully, they see us and what we're doing to know that it's possible for them as well,\" Quezada said.\n\"I think that also goes hand in hand with growing the game of football.\"\nBeatrice Go is a freelance journalist and researcher from the Philippines.
