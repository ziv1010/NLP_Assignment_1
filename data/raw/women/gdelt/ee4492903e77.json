This time around, it's Travis Scott’s turn.\nThis marks the sixth time Barcelona has swapped out its usual Spotify sponsor to promote one of the musical artists featured on the streaming service. Previous featured artists include ROSALÍA, KAROL G, Coldplay, Drake, and even The Rolling Stones.\n2025 has been a year of strong kits with the upcoming women's Euros kits featuring some gems, whilst the Ajax 125th anniversary kit was also a standout. Yet, this simple tweak to the already lovely kit will no doubt stand out when we look back on the season, especially if Barça FC wins the match.\nThe kit will be worn during the match on the 11th May, which could decide the title. Barcelona are only four points ahead of its bitter rivals, so a loss here could swing the pendulum in Real Madrid's favour during the title race with only four matches of the season left to be played.\nBarcelona have surprised many this year with its title charge under new manager Hansi Flick, and a win here would all but seal the Catalan side as the champions of La Liga.\nA Catalan collection\nWhat makes this collab stand out when compared to previous limited shirt sponsors is the launch of a capsule collection to accompany the one-off shirt. The collection features a jacket, hoodies, Tees, a scarf, a football and a cap.\nThe shirt with the new sponsor is already available on the Barcelona website, while Travis Scott's new collection is set to launch on the artist's website on May 9th.\nGet exclusive shortlists, celebrity interviews and the best deals on the products you care about, straight to your inbox.\n- For more football collabs, check out the leaked Sambas coming from Adidas soon.\nMain image credit via FC Barcelona\nMorgan got his start in writing by talking about his passion for gaming.
