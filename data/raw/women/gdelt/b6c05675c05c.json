  "body_text": "“We’ve never won a penalty shootout as a team,” admitted Emma Hayes.\nIn that context, knocking out the Champions League holders Lyon in the quarter-finals on a historic night at Stamford Bridge is not a bad time to break your duck.\nGoalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger was one of the heroes of the shootout, saving two Lyon penalties. She wheeled away, shimmying her shoulders, mouth agape before sliding to her knees and beating her chest.\nAdvertisement\nRewind to August last year and Berger had just found out that her thyroid cancer, first diagnosed in 2017 when she was playing for Birmingham City, had returned.\n“The celebration was pure elation,” Karen Bardsley, former England and Manchester City No 1, tells The Athletic. “It was an expression of everything she has gone through, the ups and downs.\n“A ‘Fuck you’ to the rest of the world — the people that don’t recognise her. Maybe it’s like a chip on the shoulder moment, ‘Yeah, I deserve this’.”\nWe’ll get to the shootout soon enough but Berger, who joined Chelsea in 2019, was instrumental to their success from the outset of last night’s second leg.\nIn the opening minutes of the first half, Hayes beckoned Berger over to the touchline to communicate instructions: don’t play out from the back, hit it long to Sam Kerr. “She delivered the game plan,” said Hayes. “That gave her confidence.”\nHayes has shuffled her goalkeepers this season, opting at times to start Sweden international Zecira Musovic. Her German team-mate’s distribution, however, is superior.\n“It is unreal,” says Bardsley. “Did you see some of the sidies (side volleys)? She was so good, I was geeking out on that.”\nIn extra time, Berger used this technique to quickly release Johanna Kaneryd down the right wing.\n“She was outside the frame of the goal,” says Bardsley. “That’s a fair distance, but to keep a nice, flat trajectory and do it through bodies… The ability not only to execute the skill but to see the pass is remarkable. She had one save at the beginning that wasn’t tidy, but everything else was routine. Her presence was good, she came to claim crosses, dominated the area, was brave when she needed to be… just resolute.”\nAlthough Lyon had dominated the game, winning 2-1 on the night, when the whistle blew to take the tie to penalties the momentum had shifted.\nAdvertisement\n“Berger thrives in big moments,” said Hayes. “She’s done that her entire career. She’s probably the best penalty-saving goalkeeper I’ve ever worked with, so I felt really confident going into the penalty shootout, even if I didn’t look it. Every day (in training), everyone always hates going up against her. I felt this was her moment after everything she has gone through.“\nBerger stood with her hands behind her back as she waited for Lyon’s takers to hit their penalties, exuding a sense of calm.\n“It’s a great technique — one we’re not used to seeing,” says Bardsley. “Usually keepers try to be big. It must be disconcerting for a striker to see someone that’s not looking very interested. But to me, that screams preparedness.\n“She will have gone into that game, looked at all the penalties. She is pragmatic and smart. You start to bring everything you’ve prepared to the forefront of your mind.”\nIt was 3-2 to Chelsea on penalties when up stepped Lyon and France captain Wendie Renard.\n“Renard’s approach was really straight,” says Bardsley. “The only thing the penalty taker can do with a long, straight approach is to go across their body, but it’s almost impossible to generate that much power with a straight approach. She gave it away.\n“As a goalkeeper, you can only deal with what’s in front of you. You’re hedging your bets, waiting for the right moment. Is there a trigger? Does she open up her hips, or close them? What are her eyes doing? Renard was probably just hoping Berger would guess the wrong way. The most important thing is being decisive and backing yourself. When you hesitate, there’s no chance.”\nBerger read Renard like a book.\nBERGER SAVES RENARD'S PENALTY! 🧤 pic.twitter.com/FjFZVnMxfz\n— DAZN Football (@DAZNFootball) March 30, 2023\nLauren James then missed her penalty and Berger didn’t get a strong enough hand to Sara Dabritz’s spot-kick. Chelsea’s fifth was sweetly converted by Jess Carter, Berger’s partner, and then USWNT international Lindsey Horan took a deep breath, knowing she had to score.\nAdvertisement\n“Berger didn’t feint to go a different way,” says Bardsley. “She just took one step, pushed and then everything was in full extension, heading in the same direction: hands, shoulders, feet.\nBERGER SAVES HORAN'S PENALTY AND CHELSEA MOVE ON TO THE SEMI-FINALS OF THE #UWCL! 💙 pic.twitter.com/rMBdjvTHA7\n— DAZN Football (@DAZNFootball) March 30, 2023\n“If I have to take something away from the save, it was at the perfect height for a keeper. If it’s too low, it’s hard to get down quickly. If it’s too high, it’s out of reach. The height was perfect but she still had to get there.\n“She just committed one way. There was no hesitation. If you hesitate, you can’t take that step. You can’t build up momentum in that short space of time.”\nChelsea goalkeeping coach Stuart Searle, who has worked with the women’s team for over 10 years, is highly-rated and known for his use of innovative techniques to improve hand-eye coordination and reaction times; whether it’s light sensors, ball machines or obstacles placed in front of the goal to produce unpredictable bounces, he pushes their goalkeepers to new heights.\nFinally getting to use @HECOstix and robopong machine together as part of our active recovery session from this morning.

The mother hen of the team, a player who has taken the talented youngster James under her wing, Mjelde is not one for the limelight. But, with the last kick of the game, all eyes were on her.\nAnd Mjelde hit an absolute rocket. What’s more impressive is that, moments later, she composed herself to do it again, scoring the first penalty of the shootout.\n“Maren Mjelde’s blood is blue,” added Hayes. “She is a Chelsea legend, as much as Ann-Katrin is. She hasn’t always played a starring role this season. She has been instrumental in our success over the years and it’s fitting that she, along with Ann-Katrin, are the big heroes of the night.”\n(Top photo: Harriet Lander – Chelsea FC/Chelsea FC via Getty Images)",
