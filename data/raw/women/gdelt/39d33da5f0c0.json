Here’s what you need to know about the new policies and game day experience.\nFans at Camp Randall can purchase beer, wine and seltzers starting Aug. 30. Here’s what you need to know about the new policies and game day experience.\nStarting with the football home opener on Friday, Aug. 30, Wisconsin Athletics will begin selling alcoholic beverages in the general seating areas at Camp Randall Stadium.\nThis includes beer, wine, and pre-packaged alcoholic products such as hard seltzers. Alcohol sales will also commence at the UW Field House, which hosts the Badger women’s volleyball and men’s wrestling teams.\nFans at Camp Randall will be limited to buying two drinks at a time. The University of Wisconsin Police will increase its on-site presence, and a text line will be available for any issues. IDs for those appearing under 40 will be scanned.\nThe University of Wisconsin Police Department will increase its on-site presence, and fans will have access to a text line to report any issues.\nThe ID policy at Camp Randall and the Field House will match that of the Kohl Center and LaBahn: Anyone appearing under 40 will need to show an ID verified by an electronic scanner.\nThis move makes UW–Madison the 16th Big Ten school to offer alcohol in its football stadium's general seating.\n“The option to purchase alcohol is common at collegiate athletic venues all over the country, and we’re glad that we can now offer it as part of the fan experience at Camp Randall,” Chancellor Jennifer L. Mnookin said. \"We were pleased with how well alcohol sales went during the basketball and hockey seasons at the Kohl Center and LaBahn Arena last season, and we expect much of the same at Camp Randall this fall.”\nA portion of the revenue from alcohol sales will support existing and future campus-led efforts to promote student wellness and responsible behavior around alcohol use.\nThis includes offering alcohol-free programming for students and supporting students experiencing challenges related to high-risk behaviors.",
