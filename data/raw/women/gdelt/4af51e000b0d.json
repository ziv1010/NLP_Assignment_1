He beat Coronation Street's Simon Gregson and The Saturdays' Frankie Bridge to the crown. Shortly after his castle stint, Danny returned to Emmerdale briefly as Aaron Dingle, where he went back to the Dales to make up with his sister Liv.\nAlthough Aaron promised his family he was back for good, it was too good to be true as the character made a dramatic exit as part of the soap's 50th anniversary storyline. As Danny discussed his brief return to the soap, he revealed his busy schedule wouldn't allow him to be in the Dales for long, but is open to coming back.\nHe told Leeds Live: \"I’ve got a few things on at the end of the year - including a pantomime and other stuff. Then I’ve got a job, so it is just not the right time. But I’m not one of those actors who says 'that’s it now, I’ve shelved it'.\"\nGiovanna Fletcher (Series 20, 2020)\nGiovanna was the first celeb to be crowned Queen of the Castle.

Upon being crowned queen, Jac broke down and vowed that she would be seen as a 'doormat' no more and became the first winner to cancel all interviews.\nShe and Dan hit back at the naysayers, sharing a cute holiday snap and assuring fans that the 'past is in the past'. She wrote: \"We have gone through a very long journey, to be where we are today. Happy. Anyone that thinks differently, don’t Comment negative comments unless you want to be blocked.\"\nShe continued: \"You do not know the ins and outs of what we have both been through, to get to a good place now. I am proud to be with my husband, stand strong and keep our family together. I will not let stupid comments pull me back to the past and dampen my sparkle!! I’m past it and you all need to be in order to follow me. Thanks!! Obvs love all you positive ppl that just get life!!️ thanking you!\"\nThe couple went on to buy a swanky £1.2 million mansion in Essex, where they now live with their two daughters Ella, eight, and Mia, five. Jacqueline now regularly collaborates with fast fashion brand In The Style to create collections and is due to reprise her role in EastEnders as Lauren Branning.\nJacqueline recently revealed her visit to Walford will not be a flying one. \"I haven’t actually come on at all and spoken about the fact I am going back to EastEnders. How wild is that?\" she told her 3.6 million fans on Instagram. \"I haven’t spoken about it at all.

From the get go he was a favourite among his fellow campmates and viewers at home, with everyone instantly warming to his down-to-earth nature and humour.\nHe talked frequently about his wife of 54 years, Sandra, and their blissfully happy relationship they'd began when they were just 17. They recently sold their Sandbanks four-storey mansion in the lavish Millionaire’s Row to build to Sandra's 'dream home' nearby. Harry and Sandra recently released a joint book, When Harry Met Sandra, which explores their more than 50 year-long romance.\nGeorgia 'Toff' Toffolo (Series 17, 2017)\nGeorgia came into the public eye though E4 reality series Made in Chelsea where she was used to living the high life. Despite her privately educated background and Conservative political views, Toff was a down to earth campmate and popular among her fellow celebrities and fans, too.\nShe beat Iain Lee and Jamie Lomas to the title and couldn't have been more shocked. She's also starred in Celebs Go Dating and landed herself a presenting slot on This Morning. Toff's used the dosh from winning wisely and has bought two holiday homes in Devon, where she was brought up.\nThe MIC star has recently started dating BrewDog businessman James Watt – revealing she met the millionaire after a mutual friend set them up on a blind date over the summer not long after she split with fraudster ex George Cottrell. She has since gone Instagram official with him and has admitted she hopes their romance will last.\n\"I would love him to be ‘The One’, but hey, so far, so good,\" Toff confessed to the Daily Mail. \"I don’t know. It is still very early days, but we’re really happy. I think I knew [how strong their connection was] from the second date. I mean it was just classic James and I.
