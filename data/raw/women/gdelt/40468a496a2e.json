  "body_text": "British return as Challenger of Record\nPublished on October 20th, 2024\nby Tom Cary, Telegraph UK\nNot only is the America’s Cup the oldest competition in international sport, it is also one of the most idiosyncratic.\nSo it was that, as New Zealand crossed the finish line in Barcelona, to seal an ultimately comprehensive 7-2 victory over Ben Ainslie’s Ineos Britannia and lift the Auld Mug for the third time in a row, an official letter was being passed by Bertie Bickett, chairman of the Royal Yacht Squadron, under whose flag Ineos Britannia race, to his opposite number in the New Zealand Royal Yacht Squadron, challenging the Kiwis to another match.\nThe challenge was accepted and Ineos are, as a consequence, official Challenger of Record for the 38th America’s Cup. The race for the next Cup has already started.\n‘A football score’\nThere will be those who will look at the final scoreline here and laugh at that statement, imagining this to be some sort of drubbing, as if it was a football score. Who will consider the millions spent as money down the drain. The truth is, the America’s Cup match is a two-horse race. And in a two-horse race, the fastest horse usually wins. New Zealand were definitely the faster horse.\nThe America’s Cup is so hard to win precisely because it is not fair. The odds are always stacked in favour of the defender. They set the rules, they decide the class of boat, they decide the venue, the challengers. They even run the event itself. That is why only four countries have ever won it in 173 years.\nThat is why the New York Yacht Club retained it for the first 130-odd years of the Cup’s existence.\nUltimately, Ineos were unable to upset the odds. New Zealand, who were able to spend two months longer designing their boat as they knew they were already in the final, who tested out different foils during the challenger series before deciding on their final package, who spent three weeks making refinements to their boat while assessing the opposition in the knockout rounds, were just too good. As Ainslie was happy to admit. – Full report\nViewing details – Race information – Results – Weather forecast\nFollowing the publication of the AC37 Protocol and AC75 Class Rule on November 17, 2021, the AC75 Class Rule and AC Technical Regulations were finalized on March 17, 2022.
