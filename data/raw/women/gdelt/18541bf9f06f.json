  "body_text": "Is LeBron James catching an early glimpse at empty nest syndrome?\nAfter defeating the Utah Jazz alongside the Los Angeles Lakers on Nov. 18, the four-time NBA champion admitted that his relationship with his son-turned-teammate Bronny James has taken on a new form since the 21-year-old began living on his own.\n“He’s not a resident anymore, so we don’t talk as much,” LeBron said in a post-game interview while playfully crossing his arms and pouting, as seen on X (formerly Twitter). “He has his own place. But he’s great.”\nFortunately for the basketball legend—who shares Bronny as well as son Bryce, 18, and daughter Zhuri, 11, with wife Savannah James—playing alongside his firstborn has allowed them to develop a unique new bond.\n“It’s been great to see and to watch [his growth],” LeBron continued. “And he’s still young. He turned 21 not too long ago. He’s still learning and getting better with each and every rep.”\nWhile LeBron and Bronny’s professional pairing makes them the first father and son to play together in the NBA, the elder James has faced questions about his plans to eventually retire from the league. However, he recently declared he’s not operating on anyone’s timeline besides his own.\n“I know I'm on the other side of the hump, for sure,” LeBron emphasized during an appearance on 360 With Speedy in September. “Come on now, I'm not about to play another 23 years, that's for damn sure, and I'm not about to play another 10. I'm definitely gearing up to where the end is, [but] I'm not there yet.”\nLater that month, he also confirmed he’s “not waiting” for Bryce—who currently plays on the University of Arizona’s college basketball team—to go pro before stepping away from the game.\n“I don't know what his timeline is,” LeBron said during a Lakers press conference in September. “He's his own young man now. He's down in Tucson. We'll see what happens this year, next year—but he has his own timeline.”\nBronny and Bryce aren’t the only budding athletes with big shoes to fill.
