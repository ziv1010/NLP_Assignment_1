  "body_text": "Blake Martinez wired a six-figure sum to a man in Japan he’d never met, then waited.\nThe cash was crammed into duffel bags, delivered by train and dropped on a doorstep. The package was shipped stateside via FedEx two-day air.\nBut once it landed, it went nowhere.\nFor days. For weeks. And with each unanswered call, with every unreturned text, Martinez’s anxiety ballooned. He started to fear it was lost — worse yet, stolen. He’d fire off dozens of messages before going to bed some nights, desperate for updates, and would doze off with the same question wedged in his mind.\nWhere’s it at?\nHe’d wake up at 5 a.m. wondering the same thing, feverishly checking his phone.\n“I kept thinking, Holy sh–, what did I do?”\nAdvertisement\nFinally, it turned up: a 2.5 x 3.5 piece of ultrathin cardboard worth more than half a million dollars.\nTwo weeks later, Martinez slumped in his seat aboard the Raiders’ team bus after piling up a team-best 11 tackles in a loss to the Jaguars. He was in his seventh NFL season, two years removed from signing a $30 million contract, five from tying for the league lead in tackles. He was just 28, about the age most NFL players hit their prime.\nBut he was on his third team in four years. He’d lost most of his 2021 season to a torn ACL, and the Giants, the team that handed him that $30 million contract in March 2020, made a surprise move 10 months after the injury, cutting him days before the season opener. Martinez landed on the Raiders’ practice squad, then climbed his way back on the field.\nThe game against the Jaguars, in early November, proved he could still play. Congratulatory texts were lighting up his phone — “Still got it!” one friend wrote — but football was the last thing on his mind. Martinez smiled as he read through the messages, convinced that as one chapter was closing, another was beginning.\nHe’d played his last game in the NFL. He was quitting football to sell Pokémon cards.\nYeah, at first, his teammates thought it was weird.\n“Blake, what’s all this Pokémon stuff you’ve been posting about?” Saquon Barkley asked him one day in the Giants’ locker room.\nSame with Sterling Shepard. Same with Leonard Williams.\n“Isn’t that stuff for kids?” they wanted to know.\nMartinez knew it was coming. So he’d start by telling them how much money he was making.\n“I just did a $50,000 box break and made $108,000.”\nHe’d watch their eyes light up. More questions would follow.\n“You made what?”\n“And what’s a box break?”\nPokémon — roughly translated from “pocket monsters” — centers on collecting creatures via the brand’s video game and collectibles empire. In 1998, it exploded into a worldwide sensation and is currently listed as the highest-grossing media franchise in the world.\nAdvertisement\nIn recent years, Pokémon cards have skyrocketed in value. Two decades after landing in the United States, some have become increasingly scarce — and in turn, ridiculously expensive. Especially the ones in excellent condition.\nThose who can get their hands on them? They have an opportunity to make a killing.\nAnd to think: Martinez used to buy packs at the Circle K down the street from his childhood home for as little as 99 cents. As a kid in Tucson, Ariz., he’d take the $5 he earned cleaning his room or taking out the trash and add to his collection. He’d stash them in his binder, hundreds upon hundreds of cards, every character he could get his hands on: Pikachu, Charmander, Snorlax, you name it.\nThen he grew up. Life moved on. The binder stayed in his parents’ storage shed — or at least that’s what he thought.\nMartinez hated football at first, but the former defensive end fell hard for the sport in high school after dropping 60 pounds and finding a home on the field at linebacker. He loved quarterbacking the defense, sniffing out the play before the snap, then upending it. Before his senior season, he spliced together his own highlight tape and shipped it off to every school he was interested in. Oregon called. Then Stanford. Two weeks later, he had offers from both.\nHe chose Stanford but didn’t start until his junior year. The NFL wasn’t on his radar until he piled up 10 tackles in an early-season game, after which he was swarmed by a dozen agents as he exited the locker room.\n“That’s when I was like, ‘Wow, OK, I need to take this seriously.'”\nSo he did. As a senior, he became one of the best defenders in the country, a third-team All-American and Butkus Award semifinalist. Four months later, after earning his degree in Management, Science and Engineering, he was a Green Bay Packer, picked in the fourth round of the 2016 draft. He started as a rookie, then didn’t miss a game for four years, epitomizing the bruising, pulsating aggression the inside linebacker spot required.\nAdvertisement\nOnce, during a game, the stitches in his nose burst open, leaving blood spilling out all over his facemask and jersey, even on some opponents. Martinez retreated to the locker room, had his nose stitched back up and returned.\nBy 2020 he’d signed with the Giants, and during the early days of the pandemic, stumbled across a headline about Pokémon cards that stopped him cold. Martinez called his mom, convinced he had a gold mine sitting idle in their storage shed back in Tucson.\n“Do you still have my Pokémon binder?” he asked.\n“Sorry, Blake, we gave those away…”\n“I was like, ‘Oh no, there goes $100,000 right there!'” he remembers thinking.\nThen he decided it was time to dive back in.\nProblem was, he didn’t have a clue what he was doing.\nMartinez started buying into online “breaks” — live streams in which the seller opens a customer’s newly-purchased pack of cards, revealing their value in real time — and got hooked. But he wasn’t making much money, and a thought kept running through his mind: It’d be way more exciting to rip these packs open myself.\n“My life motto has always sort of been: If you can do it, I can probably do it better,” Martinez says.\nSo he jumped on eBay one night and bought $40,000 worth of Pokémon cards. Then he went to Instagram, typed “Pokémon” in the search bar and messaged every collector he could find. “Like 500 different people,” Martinez remembers, laughing. “Anyone who’d message me back, I’d just ask them, ‘Hey, I have this box break coming up, would you wanna buy some of these?”\nAt first, he was met with resistance. At times, heavy resistance. Diehard collectors were skeptical. Who was this NFL player creeping into the hobby? Did he actually know what he was doing? Or was he just here to make a quick buck?\n“Some of them were like, ‘Dude, if you’re going to do this, you gotta know your sh–,'” he remembers.\nAdvertisement\nMartinez poured more and more money in, kept trying to host his own streams, and kept getting nowhere. But everything changed when a friend pointed him in the direction of Whatnot, a shopping platform that specializes in collectibles, from sports memorabilia to comic books to sneakers to, yes, Pokémon cards.\nLast year alone, nearly $1 billion in sports cards were sold through the site, and it’s become the preferred destination for athletes and entertainers dabbling in that space. In May, Saints running back Jamaal Williams hosted a live stream with the voice actor from his favorite anime, “Naruto,” and last summer, rapper Post Malone streamed a one-on-one match of “Magic: The Gathering,” losing $100,000 to a fan in the process.\nWith a wider audience, and with more reps, Martinez ditched the cheat sheet he kept by his side at first — a lengthy list of every Pokémon character and their card’s corresponding value — and embraced the performative aspect that makes the breaks so thrilling, leaning into the anticipation of the reveal and allowing his rekindled love for Pokémon cards to spill out.\nEach box, which contains 36 separate packs, includes a handful of lucrative cards. Some can be very lucrative. The fewer revealed early, the more the anticipation builds, and Martinez has grown into a master at building suspense.\nHis first stream on Whatnot? It was the one he kept mentioning to his teammates in the Giants’ locker room. It netted him $108,000 in profit.\n“The more people I connected with, the knowledge just kept growing and growing and growing, and the real ones started to respect me,” Martinez says. “Finally, it was sort of like, ‘Hey, Blake’s one of us now.'”\nLast July, with training camp just weeks away, he started his own company, Blake’s Breaks, and it took off immediately. Martinez has since hired nearly 20 full-time staffers, and collectively, they host 16 hours of live streams per day, establishing themselves as one of the biggest Pokémon channels on Whatnot. Martinez hosts two or three live streams a week himself.\nAdvertisement\nHe said revenues for Blake’s Breaks recently climbed past the $11.5 million mark — in less than a year.\n“He’s an incredible talent building a million-dollar business,” says Craig Jones, the general manager for trading card games at Whatnot. “Blake brings the same level of hype he had sacking a quarterback when he pulls a Charizard from a pack.”\nLast August, Martinez received a tip about an ultrarare card that was for sale in Japan. Was he interested? He knew wrestler and YouTuber Logan Paul had recently purchased a similar card — the famed Pikachu Illustrator from 1998, albeit with a perfect 10 grade — for $5 million. Martinez mulled his options, then decided it was worth the risk.\nHe got in touch with what he calls “a middle man,” whom he’d vetted but never met in person, and wired him a six-figure payment. The cash was emptied into duffel bags and delivered to the card’s owner, who then shipped it across the Pacific.\nSeveral anxiety-inducing weeks later, Martinez sent the Pikachu Illustrator card to an auctioneer to be graded — the final, crucial step before it could hit the market. It came back nearly pristine. The centering, corners and edging earned a 9.5 out of 10; the surface a 9. It was one of the rarest and most valuable Pokémon cards on the planet, one of only 41 believed to be in existence.\nMartinez auctioned it off. Thirteen bids poured in over 15 days, pushing the price higher, and higher, and higher. It eventually sold for $672,000.\n“And that wasn’t the last one,” he says now. “Just a few weeks ago, I sold a second for $570,000.”\nMarisa Snee was a bored 16-year-old binging “Pawn Stars” during the pandemic when she realized the Pokémon cards she had in her parents’ basement might be worth something. After she watched a Charizard sell for several hundred dollars on the show, she bolted downstairs and dug up the same card. Within a week, she netted $300 for it. She used the profit to buy another one in better condition and sold it for $1,000.\n“This is easy,” she told herself.\nA year later, Snee turned $40,000 worth of cards into a six-figure profit.\nAdvertisement\nThese days, she might be the busiest college sophomore in the country. After buying hundreds of cards off her, Martinez recruited her to work for him at Blake’s Breaks, where she’s now a content creator and the head of social media and onboarding.\nIn between her streaming schedule — she sometimes hosts for up to eight hours a day — she’s a forward for the University of Richmond women’s soccer team, and in what little free time she has left, runs graphic design and video editing businesses on the side. Naturally, the absurd amounts of money she makes off selling Pokémon cards garners the most questions.\n“You do what?” her head coach, Adam Denton, asked her after finding out about her side gig.\nLike Martinez’s incredulous teammates in the Giants’ locker room, most can’t wrap their minds around the money these cards pull in. Part of it is the scarcity: the most valuable Pokémon cards were printed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and since so many kids played with them back then — roughing up the surface and edges — very few are still in pristine shape.\n“Once you get into it,” Snee says, “it’s hard to stop.”\nIt was enough for Martinez to walk away from football at 28. After that 11-tackle game against the Jaguars last November, he was more convinced than ever: his heart wasn’t in it anymore. His knee was healthy. He could still play.\nBut there was something about this new challenge he couldn’t shake.\nFour days later, he retired.\n“I just asked myself, do I want to keep starting over from ground zero with football, and keep destroying my body, or do I want to start over from ground zero here, and do something I can actually sustain for a long time?\n“I loved football. But what I found out was I loved building and running my own team even more.”\nHe misses that feeling he’d get on Sundays, just before kickoff. He misses being in the locker room with his teammates. But Martinez is so busy these days he doesn’t have much time to look back. Some former teammates have reached out, the same ones who were puzzled by his hobby at first. Plenty of ex-NFL players struggle to find their path when football stops.\nMartinez dove right in.\nAdvertisement\n“They’ll just tell me, ‘You followed your dreams, man. That’s awesome. That takes some serious guts.'”\nSure, but his ambition was never the problem. Like Blake Martinez always told himself: if they can do it, I can probably do it better.\n(Illustration: Ray Orr / The Athletic; photos courtesy of Blake Martinez, Cooper Neill / Getty Images)",
