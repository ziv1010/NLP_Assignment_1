The integrity of our journalism is paramount, and we take this incident seriously.\n“While initial reviews pointed to an internal lapse, we are also investigating the possibility of a security breach or identity theft through hacking, which may have contributed to this disturbing development.\n“As a public institution, we cannot rule out such cyber threats and are taking appropriate steps to enhance the security of our digital platforms.\n“It is important to clarify that while internal editorial processes are being reviewed and strengthened, we are not placing sole responsibility on any individual staff member, including the sports reporter initially associated with the story.\n“Rather, this episode underscores the need for comprehensive institutional safeguards to prevent such occurrences in the future.”",
