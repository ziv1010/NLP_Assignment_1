Tiger Style finished 11th place at the NCAA Wrestling Championships in Kansas City, but it could have been better if the team was at full strength. Gymnastics finished the year just 0.25 points from returning to the NCAA Championships for the second time in three years and finished the season ranked 11th. After being picked to finish 11th in the SEC, there’s no doubt that Mizzou Softball exceeded expectations, but falling one win short of their first WCWS appearance since 2011 stings for such an enjoyable group.\nElsewhere in the non-revenue sports, women’s volleyball surprisingly made the NCAA Tournament under first-year head coach Dawn Sullivan, and men’s golf made the NCAA Tournament for a third consecutive season — setting a program record.\nAfter uncompetitive seasons in women’s basketball and baseball, how will Robin Pingeton perform under pressure where she is more than likely on the hot seat — and will we see an improvement in year two of the Kerrick Jackson era?\nWill football replicate their success from last season in an upcoming year with College Football Playoff expectations under Eli Drinkwitz? And after an 0-19 conference season in men’s hoops, will Dennis Gates bounce back in a big way with a highly rated transfer and recruiting class coming in?\nThere are some questions to be answered, but there’s plenty to look forward to for Mizzou Athletics in the 2024-2025 season as the Laird Veatch era truly gets going. It all starts up again in August.\nFor now, enjoy our offseason coverage and content on Rock M Nation.\nYesterday at Rock M and Rock M+\n“It feels certain the Tigers will be back at this stage soon.”\nA WCWS berth is the next step in Larissa Anderson’s tenure.\n“I don’t know what’s left to be said that hasn’t already been said this season to be honest, so I’ll leave you with this, and thank you from the bottom of my heart for following along this journey with me. It’s been an honor to cover this team and share their stories with you.”\nThis was an incredibly fun team to follow, and Karen’s coverage all season was top notch. (Editor’s note: thanks, Sammy)\n“What It All Means: The one position group that really needed one more guy got it. A defense that’s breaking in a new coordinator got a guy who already knows the book. And a Sun Belt standout gets the chance to shine on the highest stage possible in college. That’s a win for everybody!”\nKhalil Jacobs provides some much-needed depth at the linebacker position, and his familiarity with Corey Batoon doesn’t hurt, either.\nOf note: Mizzou plays Arkansas twice next season and Florida once (on the road in Gainesville).\n- (** RockMNation has affiliate partnerships.
