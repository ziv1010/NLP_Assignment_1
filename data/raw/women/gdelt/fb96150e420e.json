This is admittedly a bit strange and it is the result of him being on the San Francisco 49ers roster to start the 2015 season, being traded to the Denver Broncos that November, and Denver ultimately winning Super Bowl 50 in the 49ers’ home building.\nThese types of quirks are what I love so much about the NFL and the path that its players take. Vernon Davis has taken a path all over the place since he was playing regularly on Sundays, one that even took him to MTV’s The Challenge at one point, and these days it has taken him to a partnership with Smirnoff.\nHe and I spoke about it all this week. You can watch our conversation below.\nIn its fifth season as the Official Vodka Sponsor of the NFL, Smirnoff is remixing its We Do Game Days celebration with exclusive drops and fan experiences to fuel a new era of sports fandom beyond the field. Here’s what that looks like…\n- Exclusive game-day merch drops from style icon and NFL licensee Aleali May, alongside other game-day designers Kayla Jones and Gavin Mathieu\n- Behind-the-scenes access and content starring WAG superstar Claire Kittle and longtime brand partner, NFL legend Vernon Davis\n- Partnerships with DraftKings and Team Whistle, including integration into Kittle’s all new digital series Wife’d Up, Mic’d Up – first episode can be found HERE with the second dropping on Thursday, 11/20\nAhead of the first merchandise drop in early December, fans (21+) can sign up for alerts for the moment these drops go live. Fans can sign up for reminders HERE.\n- Early December: Kayla Jones — a WAG, founder and designer of Women With Ballz will kick things off with a bold, boundary-pushing purse that’s part football, part handbag.\n- Jan. 12: Gavin Mathieu — founder, creative director, and designer of Supervsn joins the roster with football-inspired hoodie like no other.\n- Jan. 21: Aleali May — renowned designer and creative director, caps off the capsule with two pieces commissioned by Smirnoff: a sleek long sleeve top and a one-of-one custom varsity gameday jacket.\nIt was interesting to learn about what football and things related to it look like for Vernon these days. He told me that he is a huge Stefon Diggs fan, they are both from the Maryland area, and that has led to him rooting for the New England Patriots.\nWhen I asked Vernon who will be at Super Bowl LX this season, the first in San Francisco since the one Vernon won with the Broncos, he whittled things down to four teams:\n- New England Patriots\n- Denver Broncos\n- San Francisco 49ers\n- Tampa Bay Buccaneers\nHe didn’t specify that those four teams would make the conference championship games, but wouldn’t that be something?",
