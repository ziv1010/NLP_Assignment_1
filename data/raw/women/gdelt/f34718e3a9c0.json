You start scrolling through Netflix to find something to watch…and an hour later, you’re still scrolling. With a seemingly endless list of options, that kind of decision fatigue should come as no surprise—though that doesn’t make it any less frustrating when all you want to do is put something on and turn off your brain for a bit.\nSo, we’ve done the work for you and narrowed down your options if you’re in the mood for a perfectly cheesy, soothingly predictable romantic comedy. Next time you’re desperate to settle on something—anything—look no further than this list of the best rom-coms currently streaming on Netflix.\n'Alex Strangelove' (2018)\nThis 2018 coming-of-age film is an especially refreshing take on the rom-com genre. It follows a teenager, fittingly named Alex Truelove (played by Daniel Doheny), who’s just beginning to explore his sexuality, perfectly capturing all the sweetly earnest moments and awkward missteps that come with the process.\n'Always Be My Maybe' (2019)\nOne of Netflix’s very best, Always Be My Maybe stars Ali Wong and Randall Park as childhood sweethearts who reconnect as adults, 15 years and two very different career paths later. You definitely shouldn’t miss this one, even if just to witness Keanu Reeves’ scene-stealing appearance playing himself.\n'Anyone But You' (2023)\nThis 2023 blockbuster that marked the rom-com resurgence stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney as two New Yorkers who are sworn enemies after a great date led to disaster. Months later at a destination wedding in Sydney, Australia, they enter a fake dating pact that reignites their very real chemistry.\nGet exclusive access to fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.\n'Choose Love' (2023)\nIf you’ve ever felt certain you could write a better rom-com than the one you’re watching, Choose Love is for you. It’s one of Netflix’s interactive offerings, and it lets you make choices throughout the story, resulting in a variety of endings for Laura Marano’s Cami—who might end up dating or even marrying any of three potential suitors, or none at all, depending on how you direct her life.\n'Falling for Christmas' (2022)\nWe’d be remiss not to include Lindsay Lohan’s long-awaited return to the big screen on this list. It’s a perfectly corny Hallmark-style Christmas movie, in which LiLo plays a rich hotel heiress named Sierra Belmont who develops temporary amnesia after a ski accident and is reluctantly taken in by Chord Overstreet’s Jake, a widower, single dad, and local inn owner, whose livelihood is currently at risk due to the Belmont family business. It sounds like a recipe for either disaster—or cheesy holiday-tinged love.\n'The Half of It' (2020)\nThe Half of It is another entry in Netflix’s canon of sweetly sensitive depictions of teenagers learning to embrace their queer identities. It tells the story of Leah Lewis’ Ellie, who’s hired by popular football player Paul (Daniel Diemer) to write love letters that’ll help him woo Alexxis Lemire’s Aster—which gets a lot more complicated when Ellie starts developing feelings for Aster in the process.\n'Happiness for Beginners' (2023)\nCall it Wild Lite. In Happiness for Beginners, Ellie Kemper plays a pessimistic divorcée who signs up for a beginner survivalist course on the Appalachian Trail. Her solo soul-searching trip soon gets a bit less solo when Jake (Luke Grimes), a friend of her brother’s, shows up on the trip, too, and sparks reluctantly start flying.\n'Hit Man' (2024)\nThe second Glen Powell flick on this list is a genre-bending crime comedy based on a real-life fake hitman. Gary Johnson (Powell) is a college professor who lures potential criminals in for police stings, until he meets and eventually falls in love with one of his marks, played by Adria Arjona.\n'Holidate' (2020)\nThis movie inspires more questions than answers: How did they get their Chicago geography so wrong? Why do the main characters spend so much time in malls? But if you can suspend your disbelief for 104 minutes, you’ll thoroughly enjoy Holidate. The silly comedy stars Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey as a pair who agree to be each other’s dates to every holiday event for a full year.\n'Hot Frosty' (2024)\nJust when you think you've seen every kind of Christmas rom-com out there, Hot Frosty surprises you. Lacey Chabert is a small-town diner owner who learns to love again when she falls for...an anatomically correct snowman (played by Dustin Milligan) that has magically come to life.\n'How Do You Know' (2010)\nSome of Reese Witherspoon’s most entertaining roles are characters who have to choose between two very different men. There’s '00s classics like Legally Blonde and Sweet Home Alabama, and this one, in which she’s stuck in a love triangle with Owen Wilson’s Matty, a professional baseball player who’s insensitive to her feelings and continues to see other women even after she moves into his apartment, and Paul Rudd’s George, a businessman who’s much kinder than Matty but may be heading to prison for corporate malfeasance.\n'Ibiza' (2018)\nPart buddy comedy, part rom-com, this 2018 film is pure fun. It stars Gillian Jacobs as Harper, who travels to Spain on a work trip—bringing along her two best friends (played by Phoebe Robinson and Vanessa Bayer), of course—and promptly goes rogue from her work duties, taking an impulse trip to Ibiza to track down famous DJ Leo West (Richard Madden), who she met on her first night in Barcelona. Sounds like a productive business trip to me!\n'The Incredible Jessica James' (2017)\nThey say misery loves company, and that’s essentially the plot of this rom-com. Jessica Williams and Chris O’Dowd play Jessica and Boone, who are set up on a blind date after having each recently gone through a bad breakup—and spend most of their subsequent dates commiserating about said breakups.\n'The Lovebirds' (2020)\nIf you’re ever in need of spicing up a stale relationship, just take a page out of this movie’s book: Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani are on the verge of a breakup when they witness a murder and get roped into a larger criminal plot as they attempt to avoid blame for the killing—resulting in a hilarious series of events that ultimately bring the duo closer together. Sounds simple enough!\n'Love Again' (2023)\nThe plot of this 2023 rom-com is a bit unconventional: Priyanka Chopra plays Mira, who, still in mourning over the death of her beloved boyfriend, begins texting his old phone number without knowing that the messages are going to Sam Heughan’s Rob's work phone. Rob quickly becomes determined to track down this mystery woman, but the film's plot only gets weirder when Celine Dion, playing a fictionalized version of herself, pops up to help guide Rob through the search. You’ll have to see it to believe it.\n'Love and Leashes' (2022)\nThis Korean romance movie gives a hilarious and sweet look into a BDSM relationship. After a mix-up at work, stoic Ji-woo (Seohyun) discovers that her obedient co-worker Ji-hoo (Lee Jun-young) has particular sexual tastes. She agrees to enter a dominant-submissive relationship with him, and as she learns more about being a dom, the pair get closer.\n'Love, Guaranteed' (2020)\nDating apps don’t always work, and that’s especially true for Damon Wayans’s Nick, who’s gone on nearly 1,000 dates through a dating website that guarantees to help its users find love. He decides to sue the website (the natural next step) but in a potentially lawsuit-ruining twist, soon begins falling for the lawyer (Rachael Leigh Cook) who’s taken his case.\n'Love Hard' (2021)\nA catfish’s unmasking is usually the end of the story, but in this case, Josh (Jimmy O. Yang) gets a second chance after promising to help set up Nina Dobrev’s Natalie with the guy whose pictures he’d used to reel her in. A tangly, lie-filled scheme ensues, during which both Josh and Natalie—surprise, surprise—discover their true selves have a lot more in common than they’d thought.\n'No Hard Feelings' (2023)\nIf you like your rom-coms on the unconventional, raunchier side, this R-rated comedy stars Jennifer Lawrence as a 32-year-old bartender who strikes up a sweet friendship with a Princeton-bound teenager. How they met: His parents hired her on Craigslist to take their son's virginity before he sets off for college.\n'Notting Hill' (1999)\nThank goodness: Netflix has added the story of a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her to its streaming library. While on a press tour in London, a world-famous actress (played by Julia Roberts) falls for an average bookshop owner (Hugh Grant). It's a '90s classic and one of the best rom-coms of all time, led by two genre heavy weights. What more could you want?\n'The Perfect Find' (2023)\nBased on the romance novel by Tia Williams, The Perfect Find shakes up the standard rom-com. For one, it stars Gabrielle Union as 40-year-old Jenna, who, after her 10-year relationship ends, strikes up a relationship with a man 15 years younger than her, played by Keith Powers. For another, it puts a whole new spin on the concept of happily-ever-after, as the film’s ending highlights several different forms of love, beyond just the romantic type.\n'Set It Up' (2018)\nThis may very well be the best of Netflix’s original rom-coms, with Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell playing two overworked assistants who team up to get their workaholic bosses to fall in love, in hopes of reducing their own workloads. No idea what’ll happen after all that time spent scheming together!\n'To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before' (2018)\nAn adaptation of Jenny Han’s YA book series, this 2018 Netflix original was an instant hit, followed by two sequels and a spinoff series about the main character Lara Jean’s younger sister Kitty. It all began with TATBILB, in which Lara Jean (Lana Condor) and her “former” crush Peter (Noah Centineo) agree to pretend to date to make Peter’s ex-girlfriend jealous and help Lara Jean avoid her current crush, Josh, who also happens to be Lara Jean's older sister’s ex. The start of any great love story!\n'Wedding Season' (2022)\nSimilar to Holidate, Wedding Season sees two unlucky-in-love people, played by Pallavi Sharda and Suraj Sharma, who agree to be each other’s dates to all of the weddings they’ve been invited to for a summer, after meeting on a dating site that their meddling parents each signed them up for. Wonder what’ll happen as they keep spending so much time together!\n'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani' (2013)\nThis 2013 Bollywood hit follows Deepika Padukone’s Naina, a doctor, and Ranbir Kapoor’s Bunny, a globe-trotting journalist, whose seemingly incompatible lifestyles stop them from following their hearts and being together. It’s a classic will-they, won’t-they tale—but, in true Bollywood fashion, made all the more exciting by multiple musical numbers.\nAndrea Park is a freelance writer for Marie Claire, where she writes mainly about pop culture, drawing on her lifelong obsessions with consuming every book, movie, and TV show she can get her hands on.
