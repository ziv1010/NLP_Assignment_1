However a variety of barriers are often responsible for holding them back.\nA poll of 2,000 adults indicated that 46% of women are keen to take up physical activity but say something is hindering them. Barriers often preventing them from participating in sport include the cost of participation, lack of access to suitable spaces, and equipment designed for men.\nRead more: Keely Hodgkinson says 'they are awful' in live BBC interview admission\nRead more: Alessia Russo calls for change as report lays bare the barriers to girls sport\nOther obstacles include confidence, low energy and not having anyone to do it with.It also emerged 38% are in a vicious cycle of not feeling fit enough to join a sports team - but aren't getting fitter, because they’re not doing it.\nMeanwhile, those polled are more likely to experience dehydration-related symptoms such as dizziness or a lack of motivation.\nThe research was commissioned by Liquid I.V. which found although 75% recognised that staying hydrated helps improve their performance, a lack of knowledge often affects their focus and drive.\nFormer England midfielder Jill Scott, who has teamed up with the powdered hydration brand for the brand-new Hot Seat Series, said: “I know first-hand how important it is to stay motivated and hydrated, and having the right support can make all the difference.\n“If you’re playing in a big group match or going for a quick run, when you’re working up a sweat, you’re not just losing water – you’re losing essential electrolytes that keep your muscles and mind performing at their best.”\nThe study found that when women do exercise, their typical session lasts less time than a man – with 30% of men working for more than 60 minutes, but only 21% of women doing the same.\nWomen also cited Jessica Ennis as the most inspirational person to get people to try new sports (19%). While men were more likely to select footballers Harry Kane or Marcus Rashford.\nJill Scott added: “Replacing both water and electrolytes, helped me to stay sharp, recover faster, and give my all every time I stepped on the pitch.\n“Even now, staying hydrated is something I make a priority every day.”",
