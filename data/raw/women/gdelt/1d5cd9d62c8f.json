  "body_text": "Youcef El Barhdadi, inclusion football officer at the Oxfordshire Football Association, marks Refugee Week by highlighting its work with Oxford United in the Community\nOne of the Football Association’s key policies is that our beautiful game must be accessible to everyone, regardless of a person’s age, gender, sexuality, nationality or physical ability.\nPrior to the launch of Oxford Phoenix – the city’s only dedicated refugee football squad - in June 2021, opportunities for refugees and asylum seekers living locally to integrate into their new communities through football were non-existent.\nREAD MORE: Hundreds sign petition to save swimming pool\nFast-forward three years, and the landscape of Oxford’s refugee football community has changed significantly.\nIn partnership with Oxford United in the Community, Refugee Resource and Asylum Welcome, the club has gone from strength to strength.\nIt has helped city-based refugees and asylum seekers in need of respite to develop new skills, make friends and positively contribute to the local community.\nWe’ve played fixtures against local schools and clubs, held twice-weekly training sessions and even linked up with the British Red Cross to provide an Oxford United matchday experience at the Kassam Stadium.\nTo date, our focus has centred around enhancing players’ skills on the pitch while supporting their development off it.\nWith our squad growing from single digits to over 40 members today, broadening our refugee football operation has been identified as the next progression step.\nWe’re not content standing still and have plans in place to upscale our impact even further this year.\nWe want to engage female players, have plans to run a Refugee World Cup and work with women and children via our Mum’s Play setup in Witney, which breaks down barriers mums and their children might face regarding formalised football participation.\nAnother ambition is to enter Oxford Phoenix into an 11-a-side Oxfordshire’s men’s league for the first time. Still to this day, a number of our players cannot speak fluent English – although it’s a language they’re rapidly learning.\nREAD MORE: Entrance to train station car park is to close\nTo take Oxford Phoenix from a start-up club funded by the hard work and commitment of three local charities to entering a regional football league would be a huge achievement.\nWe’re already fortunate to be backed by Turpin Miller Solicitors who have helped provide a new first-team kit, and we’re now on the search for other key partners to help fund additional expenses such as pitch hire, match fees and travel.\nThe squad experienced a taste of league football for the first time only last week when playing their first Oxford Charity League match, which they won 5-2.\nOur thanks to Curtis Campbell, Matthew Lister and Jacari who made our entry this summer possible.\nSupporting refugees and asylum seekers to become the best version of themselves during times of great uncertainty is a real passion of mine.\nMy father was a refugee, and a living example of the positive impact those who are granted asylum can have on their new community.\nRefugee Week provides an opportunity to celebrate the contributions, creativity and resilience of refugees and asylum seekers.\nIn Oxfordshire, Oxford Phoenix is a real-life example of how by working together positive outcomes can be achieved in even the most devastating circumstances.\nHere’s hoping by Refugee Week 2025, we can proudly reflect on a fourth year of growth, new opportunities and lifetime experiences.\nYoucef El Barhdadi, inclusion football officer at the Oxfordshire Football Association\nHelp support trusted local news\nSign up for a digital subscription now: oxfordmail.co.uk/subscribe\nAs a digital subscriber you will get:\n- Unlimited access to the Oxford Mail website\n- Advert-light access\n- Reader rewards\n- Full access to our app\nAbout the author\nAndy is the Trade and Tourism reporter for the Oxford Mail and you can sign up to his newsletters for free here.\nHe joined the team more than 20 years ago and he covers community news across Oxfordshire.\nHis Trade and Tourism newsletter is released every Saturday morning.\nYou can also read his weekly Traffic and Transport newsletter.",
