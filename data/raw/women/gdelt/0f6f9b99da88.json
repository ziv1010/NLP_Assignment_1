  "body_text": "Lionesses' Mary Earps receives 'huge amount of kindness' after coming out as gay\nFormer England goalkeeper Mary Earps has been inundated with messages of support from her Lionesses teammates after revealing for the first time that she is in a same-sex relationship\nFormer England goalkeeper Mary Earps has been met with an \"overwhelming show of love and support\" from her Lionesses colleagues, sporting figures, and supporters worldwide following her decision to speak openly about her mental health battles and publicly confirm she is in a same-sex relationship for the first time.\nThe Lionesses star revealed she is loved up with girlfriend Kitty as she spoke of her same-sex relationship for the first time. She detailed her romance in her forthcoming autobiography, All In, which will be published on 6 November.\nIn the book, the England goalkeeper opened up about her personal life and decision to share her story publicly after years of keeping it private.\nMary admitted she wanted to speak honestly about who she is and hoped her openness will inspire others to live authentically. The sports star told her friends and teammates about her decision and revealed she has received an outpouring of support.\nEngland teammates Ella Toone and Lucy Bronze have both publicly backed the football legend, whilst messages of solidarity have flooded in from throughout the women's game and wider sporting world.\nThe goalkeeping icon is also due to feature on her mate Peter Crouch's podcast next week to talk about her new memoir, All In, which candidly examines her life and career both on and off the field.\nMary's manager, Tina Taylor, said:. \"Mary's received an overwhelming show of love and support from people across the game and from fans all over the world. There's been a huge amount of kindness and encouragement sent her way, and we're so grateful for that.\n\"She's always sought to keep her private life very private, but felt it would be inauthentic not to talk about this in her book. The positive reaction has been incredible to see.\" Sarah Garrett MBE, founder of the British LGBT Awards, also commended Mary, calling her an \"inspirational role model\".\n\"Her decision to talk about being in a same-sex relationship will help huge numbers of young people who may be struggling with their sexuality. I hope she realises that she's changing young people's lives by being her true self - and that being LGBTQ+ should never be a barrier to success.\"\nGerard Bowers-McIntyre, Chair of LGBTQ+ charity Sahir, said: \"Mary's decision to share the details of her coming out story and same-sex relationship with the world marks a massive milestone for the sporting profession.Mary has already written her name in the history books of women's football, but this truth and honesty is a more poignant and inspiring moment for the future generation.\"\nIn a statement the Nottingham-born footballer said: “I’ve always tried to keep my personal life separate from my professional one, but it would have felt inauthentic not to include something so important to me in this book. I’m in a really happy relationship.\n\"The people closest to me have always known, and I feel ready and happy to share that with everyone else now.” Goalkeeper Mary currently plays for Paris Saint-Germain, having previously starred for Manchester United .\nShe was part of the historic Lionesses squad that won the UEFA Women’s Euro 2022 and was awarded an MBE earlier this year for her services to football.\nHer book, All In, offers an honest and powerful account of her journey - from the highs of international success to personal struggles with mental health and finding confidence in her identity both on and off the pitch.\nSpeaking ahead of the book's release, Mary said: \"This book is me, unfiltered. I hope it resonates with anyone who's ever been told they're not enough and inspires the next generation to be unapologetically themselves.\"\nLike this story?
