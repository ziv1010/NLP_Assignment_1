  "body_text": "Former Hawkeye Headed To The Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame\nA small-town Iowa boy with dreams of playing in the NFL will soon become a member of the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.\nIt is one thing to dream of playing football in the NFL. It is another to accomplish that goal, especially coming from small-town Iowa. Aaron Kampman went to high school at Aplington-Parkersburg and went on to play under both Hayden Fry and Kirk Ferentz at the University of Iowa. Packers.com reports that Kampman will be inducted into the prestigious Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in August of 2024. Not bad for a fifth-round draft pick!\nAs Packers.com points out, Kampman wasn't even on the depth chart early on during his career in Green Bay. But through sheer determination and hard work, Kampman not only turned himself into a starting defensive end for the Packers, he turned into an All-Pro defensive player in the NFL. Kampman told members of the media that the drive and work ethic he learned at a young age in Iowa played a huge part in his success.\nThe work ethic there was instilled in me at a young age. That was something that exemplified itself all the way through my career, and I wanted to be the best.\nKampman's career in Green Bay started slowly. He tallied just seven sacks during his first three years in the league. But a change in coaching allowed Kampman's career to take off. Packers.com reports that Kampman had 15 and a half sacks in 2006, and 12 more in 2007. His 2006 tally remains the third-highest in Packers history. His 113 tackles that same year are still a franchise record for a defensive end.\nA knee injury ended his season early in 2009, and that would end up being Kampman's final year in Green Bay. He finished his NFL career with two injury-filled seasons in Jacksonville. Packers.com reports that Kampman will be joined in the Packers HOF by another defensive star, linebacker Clay Matthews. Matthews played 11 years for Green Bay, tallied 91.5 sacks, and led the defense that won the Super Bowl following the 2010 season.\nCongratulations Aaron Kampman on your induction into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame!\nUniversity of Iowa ANF Wall of Honor Members\nGallery Credit: HawkeyeSports.com/Getty Images\nBest Photos From A Magical Weekend at Carver-Hawkeye Arena\nGallery Credit: Getty Images/Hawkeyesports.com",
