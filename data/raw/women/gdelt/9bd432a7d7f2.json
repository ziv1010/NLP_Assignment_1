Through their consistent efforts this team had become the top team with an almost unblemished season (one loss only),'' he said.\nWildcats Jaguars 13s, coached by Adam Johnson, also had a comfortable win against Hallidays Point 3-1. This team also only lost one game this year and on grand final day showed their attacking power to go to a 3-0 lead before conceding late when the game was over.\nWildcats Jaguars 16s, coached by Graeme Budden, were the most improved team in their age group. They went down to Hallidays Point 1-0 in the grand final. This was after losing to the same team in penalties in the major semi final two weeks before.\nThe team showed great determination, with an own goal unfortunately being the difference.\nWallace said that overall it has been a great year for the club.\n\"The improvement we have shown over the past five years has been enormous,'' he said.\n\"In my 17 years with the club, there has never been a time we have been in four grand finals in one year. Our plans are working.\"",
