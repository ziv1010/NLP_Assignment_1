The area is still very dangerous to move around, particularly the flash flooding and the volume of water over the roads. Can I please ask, if you don't have to be on the roads, don't. Stay safely in your homes unless you have to evacuate.\"\nThe Bureau of Metereology has maintained severe weather warnings for Port Douglas, Daintree Village, Wujal Wujal, Cooktown and Hopevale - but no longer for Cairns.\n—\nThe World Health Organisation has said in a social media post it is \"appalled\" at what it calls the effective destruction of Kamal Adwan hospital in Gaza City, as Gaza's health system continues to be targeted by Israeli defence forces.\nThe Palestinian Authority has called for an urgent probe into reports people - including wounded patients - were crushed and buried alive by Israeli bulldozers in the hospital's courtyard.\nMeanwhile, health officials say at least one child has been killed by an Israeli tank shell inside the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, in Gaza's south.\nDoctor Ahmed Alfar says a shell hit the ceiling and damaged the room while medical staff were doing a ward round visiting children.\n\"It caused a crisis in the room: one female was martyred and some others were severely injured. We heard screaming as they ran to the reception. This is the maternity ward (of the hospital). They were safe here, all females accompanying their children. All of a sudden they woke up to the shocking sound of shelling.\"\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society also reports Israeli forces have blocked ambulances' access to Tulkarm in the West bank, leading to the death of one injured person.\nThe WHO says only one hospital is partially functioning in northern Gaza, along with three that are \"minimally-functional\", compared to 24 before the conflict.\n—\nNew Zealand's new prime minister Chris Luxon has announced his first official overseas visit will be to Sydney to meet Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese.\nThe day-trip on Wednesday will include talks, a private lunch, and a joint press conference.\nMr Albanese last visited Wellington to meet with then-prime minister Chris Hipkins during the FIFA Women's World Cup, which the two nations co-hosted.\n—\nIn football,\nThe Matildas' final Olympic qualifier is set to be held in Melbourne, in front of an expected sell-out crowd of 50,000 people.\nFootball Australia has confirmed Australia's women's team will face off against Uzbekistan at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne on 28 February, four days after the teams play in Uzbekistan.\nThe match will determine which team will be one of Asia's two representatives at the Paris Olympics next year.\nVictorian Premier Jacinta Allan says she is thrilled the government has partnered with the women's soccer stars.\n\"We saw how over the course of this year the Matildas have captured the hearts and minds of all of us, with their fantastic skills on the football field and of course the way they have... they are great role models off the pitch. This is going to be a big game - a really really big game, not just for the Matildas, but also too we expect the fans will absolutely pack out Marvel Stadium, as we saw earlier this year.\"\nAustralia were comfortable 10-0 winners when they last faced Uzbekistan in 2007, and are heavy favourites to progress to their third consecutive Olympics.",
