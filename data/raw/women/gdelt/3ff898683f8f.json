  "body_text": "Group A: New Zealand (FIFA world ranking: 22), Norway (12), Switzerland (21), Philippines (53)\nWhile some World Cup host nations would simply be thrilled with automatic qualification, New Zealand will undoubtedly be a bit more ambitious with their aims. They are used to competing at this level — 2023 will be their fifth consecutive appearance in the tournament and sixth overall since it began in 1991.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, New Zealand are yet to advance beyond the group stage, or even win a match, at the finals — and, if their start to 2023 is any indication, playing on home soil will need to play an outsized part in their quest for such advancement. To that end, unsurprisingly, their group games are all happening in New Zealand rather than in co-host Australia.\nSince losing all three matches in the previous World Cup four years ago, New Zealand have undergone an evolution.\nLong-time mainstay Abby Erceg retired (again, having done so once in 2017) from international football in January at age 33, although a trio of similarly veteran members (Ali Riley, Betsy Hassett and Annalie Longo, who all made their debuts between 2006 and 2008) are all involved, while Ria Percival tries to make up for over a year of lost action due to an ACL knee injury. Percival made the squad but whether she gets cleared to actually play or not, a balanced Group A may be difficult to advance from for a side who have won just once in their last 11 matches (losing eight of them).\nAny group with a host nation in it is bound to be interesting. By virtue of them being the seeded team, tournaments in which a non-elite national team serve as hosts result in a more balanced and less top-heavy quartet. That is great news for Norway, whose FIFA ranking of 12th is the best of these four sides. Fortunately for New Zealand, whose ranking would have placed them near the top of Pot Three for this tournament if hosts didn’t jump the queue, their most recent win (on September 6, 2022) came over the Philippines, who are in this group and making their Women’s World Cup debut.\nSwitzerland complete the set and are narrow favourites to advance with Norway ahead of New Zealand, although they didn’t qualify for the World Cup in 2019 and failed to advance from their group in last summer’s European Championship.\nAdvertisement\nFixtures in full\n- 20 July : New Zealand v Norway (08:00 BST, 03:00 ET).\nWatch on BBC in UK, FOX and Telemundo in U.S. - 21 July: Philippines v Switzerland (06:00 BST, 01:00 ET).\nWatch on ITV in UK, FS1 and Universo in U.S. - 25 July: New Zealand v Philippines (06:30 BST, 01:30 ET).\nWatch on ITV in UK, FS1 and Universo in U.S. - 25 July: Switzerland v Norway (09:00 BST, 04:00 ET).\nWatch on ITV in UK, FS1 and Telemundo in U.S. - 30 July: Norway v Philippines (08:00 BST, 03:00 ET).\nWatch on BBC in UK, FS1 and Universo in U.S. - 30 July: Switzerland v New Zealand (08:00 BST, 03:00 ET).\nWatch on BBC in UK, FOX and Telemundo in U.S.\nThe favourites are…\nNorway, by some margin. Last summer’s Euros brought disappointment despite winning their group opener against Northern Ireland 4-1. An 8-0 thrashing by eventual champions England in match two was too much of a mental hurdle to overcome in the four days before the group finale and they were knocked out with a 1-0 loss to Austria. Their form has been up and down since, but a 2-0 win away to the Netherlands in November reminded the world that Norway have genuine quality. They managed draws with France and Sweden earlier this year as well.\nThere’s plenty of talent beyond their headliner (more on her in a second), including Chelsea duo Maren Mjelde and Guro Reiten, Manchester City’s Julie Blakstad and Frida Maanum of Arsenal. Tricky winger Caroline Graham Hansen had a knee injury scare in April but came back swiftly to start Barcelona’s Champions League final win last month.\nIf they live up to expectations as the group’s frontrunners, Norway could be tough opponents in the knockouts.\nThe standout match is likely to be…\nA potential losers-go-out affair on the group’s third matchday between Switzerland and New Zealand. As stated, the Swiss have the narrow edge in the FIFA rankings but have drawn five and lost two since securing qualification by squeezing past Wales in one of October’s three UEFA play-off finals. Although their defence and midfield are built around the Arsenal duo Noelle Maritz and Lia Walti, whether or not they advance for a second time in their two World Cups (having done so in 2015) will hinge on a steady stable of attackers. Ramona Bachmann and Ana Maria Crnogorcevic feature regularly for Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona respectively, while Fabienne Humm of FC Zurich has been a mainstay for a decade and Aston Villa’s Alisha Lehmann provides a capable pressing option from the bench.\nIf those two sides are neck-and-neck after two games, it could give the home faithful in Dunedin a chance to nudge their team closer to a long-awaited knockout phase appearance.\nAdvertisement\nThe group’s galactico\nFor all the other quality players listed in Norway’s section of this article, none comes close to overshadowing their star. Ada Hegerberg is among the best in any group in this year’s tournament, the first-ever Ballon d’Or Feminin winner (in 2018) and the Women’s Champions League’s record goalscorer with 59. Now 27, Hegerberg spent five years away from the national team from 2017 following a dispute with the Norwegian federation over its treatment of women’s football — two years after she first broke out with three goals at the 2015 World Cup.\nNow back in the fold, her form will go a long way towards determining how far Norway get. She shook off an injury scare in an April friendly against Sweden to score two goals and add an assist in 122 league minutes of action in Lyon’s final three games of the season and should be good to go by the time Group A starts. A clinical finisher who can find space expertly, Hegerberg’s return to the World Cup stage could extend into at least the tournament’s last eight if all goes to plan.\nThis could be a breakout tournament for…\nAll eyes were on Julie Blakstad in January 2022 when she made a headline-grabbing move to Manchester City. By then, she was already a goalscoring senior international for Norway after rising up the ranks from third-division Ottestad to Toppserien sides FL Fart and Rosenberg. It turned out she needed additional development time, spending much of 2023 on loan with BK Hacken in Sweden. A left-winger for her club but often used at left-back for Norway, she proved to be a strong two-way wide defender in the 2022 European Championship. Wherever she gets her minutes in this World Cup, it will be a great chance to show her readiness for a more regular role with City.\nA story to look out for\nFor the first time, the Philippines will participate in a Women’s World Cup, qualifying by reaching the semi-finals of the 2022 Asian Cup. It was not an entirely smooth tournament, as they were beaten 4-0 by Australia and advanced to the semis via a penalty shootout win over Chinese Taipei.\nA couple of the players in their squad play for American colleges: forward Isabella Flanigan (West Virginia) and goalkeeper Kaiya Jota (Stanford), while defender Maya Alcantara (Georgetown) is one of the named reserves. Another two also play in the U.S.: defender Alicia Barker (formerly of the University of Illinois) plays for Seattle-based amateur club Pacific Northwest SC, while 16-year-old Isabella Pasion, another of the reserves, is at high school near Dallas, Texas.\nYou might not know this but…\nNorway are one of four nations to win this tournament — alongside the United States (four times), Germany (twice) and Japan — having done so in Sweden in 1995 by a staggering aggregate scoreline of 23 goals to one across their six matches. That side’s star midfielder, Hege Riise, took over as Norway Women’s head coach following last summer’s Euros. Riise still holds the national record with 188 caps.\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Eamonn Dalton)",
