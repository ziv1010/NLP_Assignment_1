  "body_text": "Lioness Lucy Bronze hailed as 'one of the greatest people' to come out of Northumberland town\nThe experienced full-back was recently awarded the Freedom of Northumberland\nPraise has been heaped on Northumberland-born England star Lucy Bronze after her key role in the Lioness's defence of the Women's European Championships. Bronze, who was born in Berwick and schooled in Alnwick, played every game at the tournament and scored a vital goal in the quarter finals as well as the decisive penalty in the same game's shoot-out.\nThe 33-year-old Chelsea right-back was recently awarded the Freedom of Northumberland after winning the tournament in 2022. After the victory against Spain on Sunday, Bronze revealed she had played the entire tournament while suffering from a broken tibia.\nIt's no surprise that key figures from across the county were keen to speak of their pride in one of the county's most famous names.\nCouncil leader Glen Sanderson said: \"It was an enormous pleasure to meet and spend time with Lucy when she came to County Hall for her Freedom award. Underneath the friendly and calm exterior lies the heart of a real lioness as she proved again yesterday.\n\"She is a unique player with skills and determination and a perfect role model.\"\nNorth Northumberland MP David Smith added: \"I'm absolutely over the moon for the Lionesses - they have shown courage and grit throughout the Euros and rightly deserve their back-to-back win.\n\"I think it's extra special for everyone in Northumberland to see local lass Lucy Bronze on the pitch, and we are all in awe of her carrying on with a broken leg. For me, watching these incredible women celebrate their win with such joy is a wonderful, memorable moment for sporting history.”\nCabinet member for education at the council, Guy Renner-Thompson, attended school with Lucy as a youngster.\nHe said: \"It was great to watch Lucy and the Lionesses win the match. She is an inspiration to children and young people across Northumberland.\n\"She has also been a big help in securing funding for football clubs in North Northumberland. She is always willing to try and help.\"\nCoun Martin Swinbank, who represents the Alnwick Hotspur ward, said: \"The match was great. They have done absolutely fantastically well.\n\"Lucy Bronze is absolutely amazing and it's really good for the town and for the county. Two time Euros winners - what more can you say?\"\nCoun Gordon Castle, who represents the adjoining Alnwick Castle ward, added: \"I'm not a football person, I've never followed football - but this was something else.\n\"I felt it was my patriotic duty to watch and it was really something. I was quite excited!\n\"You could argue that Spain were technically the better side, but that English never-say-die spirit carried us through. Lucy was really put through the mill, but what a woman, what a player.\n\"Alnwick is proud of her. She is one of the greatest people to come out of the town.\"",
