  "body_text": "(WASHINGTON) — Fresh off a newly minted Democratic ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are set to go on tour, hitting several battleground states in five days — alongside them and mirroring their schedule state by state is Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance.\nOn Monday, Harris introduced Walz to a fired-up crowd in Philadelphia; Vance was also in Pennsylvania on Monday. The candidates will campaign next in Wisconsin and Michigan.\nHere’s how the news is developing:\nBiden explains decision to drop out of 2024 race\nIn his first sit-down interview since stepping down from the 2024 race, President Joe Biden explained his historic decision.\n“Look, polls we had showed that it was a neck-and-neck race, would have been down to the wire. But what happened was a number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in their races,” Biden said earlier this week in an interview with CBS News that aired on Sunday.\nHe also pointed to the fact that he always saw himself as a transitional figure, and he said that beating Donald Trump was “the most important thing” for him.\n“Number two, when I ran the first time, I thought of myself as being a transition president. I can’t even say how old I am, it’s hard for me to get out of my mouth. And, but things got moving so quickly, it didn’t happen. And the combination was that I thought it was a critical issue for me still, it’s not a joke, maintaining this democracy. But I thought it was important because although it’s a great honor being president, I think I have an obligation to the country to do the most important thing, and that is we must, we must, we must defeat Trump,” Biden said.\n“It’s a danger — he is genuine danger to American security,” Biden said. “Look, we’re at an inflection point in world history of the decisions we make in the last three, four years, the next three, four years determine what the next six decades look like, and democracy is the key.”\n-ABC News’ Michelle Stoddart\nHarris says Israel has ‘important responsibility to avoid civilian casualties’\nVice President Kamala Harris spoke to reporters Saturday evening before boarding a flight from Phoenix to Las Vegas for a campaign event and discussed the latest incidents in the Israel-Gaza conflict.\nShe was asked about the Israeli Defense Forces strike on Al-Tabeen School in Gaza City, and said there are “far too many civilians who have been killed.”\n“Israel has a right to go after the terrorists that are Hamas. But as I have said many, many times, they also have, I believe, an important responsibility to avoid civilian casualties,” Harris said.\nWhen asked about the possibility the administration might set arms limitations on Israel, the vice president said it was important to have that a hostage deal and a cease-fire.\n“And I can’t stress that strongly enough, it needs to get done. The deal needs to get done, and it needs to get done now,” she said.\n-ABC News’ Frtiz Farrow, Gabriella Abdul-Hakim and Will McDuffie\nTrump campaign claims it was hacked by ‘foreign sources’\nFormer President Donald Trump’s campaign is claiming it was hacked by “foreign sources” with the intent to interfere in the upcoming election.\nThe Trump campaign statement cited a report published by Microsoft on Friday, which said, “In June 2024, Mint Sandstorm—a group run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) intelligence unit—sent a spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign from a compromised email account of a former senior advisor. The phishing email contained a fake forward with a hyperlink that directs traffic through an actor-controlled domain before redirecting to the listed domain.”\nMicrosoft does not identify the presidential campaign in its report. Microsoft has also not responded to ABC’s request for more information.\nOutside of the Trump campaign statement, ABC News has not confirmed the campaign was hacked by foreign sources with the intent to interfere in the election.\nHarris, Walz stop at Phoenix office before rally\nVice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz dropped by the North Phoenix coordinated campaign office on Friday to meet with volunteers making signs.\n“Aw, Momala,” Harris said reading a sign that made mention of her step kids’ nickname for her.\nThe vice president laughed when she saw on person’s “Coconut > Orange” sign.\n“We just wanted to stop by to say thanks, guys,” she said.\nThe duo took a selfie in front of a large “Kamala and Coach” sign at the end.\nThey then invited those in attendance to join them in the motorcade to the rally.\nOn the tarmac, a reporter asked Walz if he had spoken with Sen. JD Vance. He did not answer.\n-ABC News’ Gabriella Abdul-Hakim, Fritz Farrow and Will McDuffie\nTrump’s plane diverted after mechanical issue\nFormer President Donald Trump’s plane was diverted Friday making a landing in Billings, Montana, due to a mechanical issue, an airport spokesperson and sources told ABC News.\nTrump was en route to a campaign event at Brick Breeden Fieldhouse in Bozeman, Montana, scheduled for later in the night.\nThe situation was not an emergency, sources close to the former president told ABC News.\nThe sources and airport spokesperson say Trump continued to Bozeman on a smaller private jet.\n-ABC News’ John Santucci, Katherine Faulders, Luke Barr and Clara Mcmichael\n‘I could never vote for Kamala Harris as president’: Mike Pence\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence reiterated Friday that he would not vote for his successor despite not supporting former President Donald Trump.\n“Let me go on the record here at the gathering: I could never vote for Kamala Harris as president of the United States, or Tim Walz, as her running mate. Period,” Pence said during an on-camera interview with conservative radio host Erick Erickson.\nPence defended his decision to not support Trump, citing several issues including “marginalizing the right-to-life in our party, as we saw on the national platform.”\n“I cannot endorse President Trump’s continuing assertion that I should have set aside my oath to support and defend the Constitution and acted in a way that would have overturned the election in January of 2021,” Pence added.\nThe former vice president did say he was grateful that Trump was not seriously hurt during the attempted assassination during a rally in Pennsylvania last month.\n“Karen and I, we were in a plane, we had just landed, and I had got a text from someone watching it in real time. It took my breath away,” he said, referring to his wife. “I truly admired the way the president stood up and raised his fist and walked off that stage.”\n-ABC News’ Brittany Shepherd\nHarris and Walz head to Southwest; Trump to Montana; Biden, Harris to hold joint event in Maryland next week\nPresident Biden and Vice President Harris will hold a joint event in Maryland on Thursday, Aug. 15, according to the White House.\nThey will discuss “the progress they are making to lower costs for the American people,” the White House said.\nMeanwhile, ahead of visits this weekend to Arizona and Nevada, the Harris campaign is touting what it called its “historic ground game advantage” in the two battleground states.\nIn a memo, the campaign also notes the elevated importance in Arizona and Nevada of reproductive freedom, as abortion-related ballot measures will be in place in each state this fall.\n“Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz’s momentum across the battlegrounds is real and will be on full display in Arizona and Nevada, where we’ve built massive coordinated campaigns as Trump has almost no presence whatsoever,” the memo read. “Our campaign will continue our work to reach the diverse voters who power our victories in the Southwest, highlighting the stakes of the race for reproductive rights and the Vice President’s leadership to secure the border.”\nFormer President Donald Trump is set to hold a campaign rally in Bozeman, Montana, on Friday.\nBiden, Harris to hold joint event in Maryland on Thursday as Harris and Walz head to Southwest\nPresident Biden and Vice President Harris will hold a joint event in Maryland on Thursday, Aug. 15, according to the White House.\nThey will discuss “the progress they are making to lower costs for the American people,” the White House said.\nMeanwhile, ahead of visits this weekend to Arizona and Nevada, the Harris campaign is touting what it called its “historic ground game advantage” in the two states.\nIn a memo, the campaign also notes the elevated importance in Arizona and Nevada of reproductive freedom, as abortion-related ballot measures will be in place in each state this fall.\n“Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz’s momentum across the battlegrounds is real and will be on full display in Arizona and Nevada, where we’ve built massive coordinated campaigns as Trump has almost no presence whatsoever,” the memo read. “Our campaign will continue our work to reach the diverse voters who power our victories in the Southwest, highlighting the stakes of the race for reproductive rights and the Vice President’s leadership to secure the border.”\nHarris will not agree to Fox News debate with Trump, campaign official says\nVice President Kamala Harris will not be joining former President Donald Trump on Fox News’ debate stage on Sept. 4, a Harris campaign official told ABC News.\nThe official said Harris agreeing to future debates is contingent on Trump showing up and “keeping his word” to the Sept. 10 debate, hosted by ABC News.\nHarris’ campaign is willing to have conversations about future debates, but they must be scheduled after Sept. 10, according to the official.\nHarris and Walz court union members at United Auto Workers campaign stop\nVice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz gave remarks at a local United Auto Workers office in Wayne, Michigan, on Thursday, championing “the collective.”\nWalz praised Harris’ leadership, saying, “She stands on the side of the American people and the American worker. She’s the one who took on the predators, the fraudsters, the transnational gangs.”\n“And she’s the one that stands up against the billionaires and the corporate greed — it’s who Kamala Harris is,” he added.\nHarris took the stage largely repeating her newly tested stump speech, letting the audience know her campaign is for everyone.\n“We believe in the collective,” Harris said. “We’re not falling for these folks who are trying to divide us trying to separate us, trying to pull us apart. That’s not where the strength lies.”\nShe ended her remarks by reminding the crowd of how many days were left until voting day and how much hard work was left to win the election.\n“We’ve got 89 days to get this done. You know, the one thing about all of us is we like hard work. Hard work is good work,” she said.\nBiden says he’s confident in VP Harris debating Trump\nPresident Joe Biden said that he has confidence in Vice President Kamala Harris in her upcoming debate with former President Donald Trump.\nSpeaking to reporters on the tarmac of Joint Base Andrews Thursday, Biden assured he was undoubting of Harris while also making a dig at Trump.\n“Yes, I am,” Biden said of his confidence in Harris.\n“As long as he keeps talking,” he added of Trump.\nOn Thursday, Trump agreed to join Harris on the debate stage hosted by ABC News on Sept. 10.\n‘I hope he shows up’: Harris reaffirms ABC News debate\nVice President Kamala Harris commented Thursday evening about former President Donald Trump’s announcement that he would debate her on ABC News next month.\n“Well I’m glad that he finally agreed to a debate on September 10th. I’m looking forward to it and I hope he shows up,” she said.\nWhen asked if she is open to more debates, she said, “I am happy to have that conversation, after … September 10th.”\nHarris responds to GOP criticism of Walz’s military service\nVice President Kamala Harris has addressed criticism from Sen. JD Vance on her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, and his military record.\nSpeaking with reporters in Detroit, Michigan, Harris said, “Listen, I praise anyone who has presented themselves to serve our country. And I think that we all should.”\nHarris’ comments come after Vance, the running mate of former President Donald Trump, accused Walz of “stolen valor,” saying he lied about his military service when he never saw active combat.\nThe Harris-Walz campaign issued a statement Wednesday saying that “in his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American’s service to this country — in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It’s the American way.”\nVP contenders’ incomes, finances examined\nThe major party vice presidential nominees — Democrat Gov. Tim Walz and Republican Sen JD Vance — sharply disagree on a range of issues, but the differences in their personal finances are just as stark.\nWalz, a former teacher and member of the U.S. House of Representatives, earns about $127,000 in salary per year, retains no stock holdings and relies on a pension account as his primary asset, financial disclosures show.\nVance, a former venture capitalist, brought in roughly $221,000 in 2022 from salary and book royalties, as well as hundreds of thousands in investment income, a U.S. Senate financial disclosure showed. He also held significant wealth in brokerage accounts and dozens of business investments, according to the financial disclosure.\nTrump says he has agreed to offer from ABC News to debate Harris\nFormer President Donald Trump said he has agreed to an offer from ABC News to debate Vice President Kamala Harris on Sept. 10.\nHe said so during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago Club on Thursday.\nTrump previously said he had been willing to go toe-to-toe with President Joe Biden and agreed to ABC News’ first invitation in May.\nHowever, after Biden dropped out of the race last month and Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee, Trump had been noncommittal about whether or not he would debate Harris.\nHarris has accused Trump of “running scared” and trying to back out of the debate.\n-ABC News’ Katherine Faulders and John Santucci\nHarris, Walz to meet with UAW in Michigan\nHarris and Walz will attend a campaign event with United Auto Workers members in Wayne, Michigan, which represents Ford’s Michigan Assembly Plant Thursday afternoon, the campaign said.\nUpon arrival, they will be greeted by President Shawn Fain and UAW board members, according to the campaign, before they deliver brief remarks.\nThe union endorsed Harris for president on July 31 after it had previously endorsed Biden.\nThis stop is their only campaign stop before heading to Phoenix, Arizona, for a rally on Friday.\n-ABC News’ Gabriella Abdul-Hakim, Fritz Farrow and Will McDuffie\nHouse Democratic armed service veterans defend Walz’ record\nReps. Jason Crow, D-Colo., Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., and Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., who are all veterans, defended Gov. Tim Walz Thursday following attacks on his service by Sen. JD Vance and other Republicans.\nCrow said the attacks coming from Republicans are “old and tired.”\n“They have no options but to try to do one of the worst things you can do in America, that is to attack a veteran for their service,” he said adding, “We’re not going to put up with it.”\nAuchincloss said the Trump and Vance ticket doesn’t represent the values of veterans.\n“I thank JD Vance for his service, but his political career and his political positions are antithetical to the values of veterans, and Donald Trump has a long track record of disparaging veterans,” he said.\nSherrill said the Harris-Walz ticket is “fantastic” and one that “veterans can get behind, because we know they will continue to fight to support our veterans with legislation like the PACT Act.”\nThursday marked the second anniversary of the PACT Act, which provides health care and benefits for millions of veterans injured by exposure to toxins.\n-ABC News’ Lauren Peller\nTrump announces Mar-a-Lago news conference on Thursday afternoon\nFormer President Donald Trump announced via social media that he would hold a “general news conference” slated for Thursday afternoon.\nThe announcement comes as Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are campaigning in Michigan amid a battleground state blitz.\nTrump’s last outing on the campaign trail was in Georgia on Saturday, although he has done media interviews this week.\nRepublican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance — also campaigning in battleground states this week — has been critical of Harris for not talking to the media since becoming the Democratic nominee. During his battleground state visits, he’s taken several questions from the press, attempting to draw contrast with Harris.\nTrump also mentioned Harris’ lack of media appearances, suggesting it’s because “she is unable to answer questions.”\n-ABC News’ Kelsey Walsh\nHarris leads Trump among likely voters nationally: Poll\nA poll from Marquette University Law School of voters nationally found Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump among likely voters in a 2024 general election head-to-head matchup.\nAmong two-way registered voters, Harris leads Trump by four points, 52% to 48%. Yet among two-way likely voters, the vice president leads the former president by six points, 53% to 47%.\nThe poll, taken from July 24 to Aug. 1, has a margin of error of +/-4.1 percentage points among registered voters; and +/-4.7 percentage points among likely voters.\nThe poll was taken entirely after the assassination attempt on Trump and President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the race, and entirely before Harris announced her running mate.\nUncommitted leaders say they brought up arms embargo to Harris in Michigan\nUncommitted leaders say they spoke quickly with Vice President Kamala Harris before her rally in Detroit, Michigan, on Wednesday after they reached out to her team to meet, they told ABC News.\nLayla Elabed, the sister of Rep. Rashida Tlaib, and Abbas Alawieh, an Uncommitted delegate, say they were in the welcoming line for Harris and Gov. Tim Walz where they communicated to Harris that they wanted to support her but that voters wanted her to consider an arms embargo.\nAccording to the group, the two asked to meet with her about the arms embargo request, and they said she indicated she was open to it and introduced the two leaders to her staff.\nAccording to a campaign official, during the “brief” interaction, Harris “reaffirmed” that the campaign will continue to “engage with those communities.”\n“Since October 7, the Vice President has prioritized engaging with Arab, Muslim, and Palestinian community members and others regarding the war in Gaza. In this brief engagement, she reaffirmed that her campaign will continue to engage with those communities,” read a statement from the campaign.\n“The Vice President has been clear: she will always work to ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups. The Vice President is focused on securing the ceasefire and hostage deal currently on the table. As she has said, it is time for this war to end in a way where: Israel is secure, hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinian civilians ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, freedom, and self-determination,” the statement concluded.\nHarris has noticeably tried to thread the needle on the war in Gaza in an attempt to bridge divides within the party over the Israel-Hamas war. However, she has been aligned with President Joe Biden in vowing unwavering support for Israel and stressing that the way Israel carries out its war against Hamas matters specifically in regards that to civilian safety.\nPro-Palestinian protesters were present at the Harris-Walz rally on Wednesday, a fairly normal citing at her events. They chanted “Kamala, Kamala you can’t Hide, we won’t vote for genocide.” The crowd booed and drowned out the protesters with chants of “Kamala.”\nShe quipped her usual line “I’m here because we believe in democracy. Everyone’s voice matters, but I am speaking now. I am speaking now,” but added a more blunt reply: “You know what, if you want Donald Trump to win then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.”\nMembers of the Uncommitted movement have indicated to ABC News that Harris’ language regarding Gaza in the coming months is crucial to gaining their support, something they’ve said they would not have been able to give to President Biden.\nAt the end of their Zoom call earlier, before meeting Harris, the leaders acknowledged that former President Donald Trump was actively attacking Palestinians and that they’re “movement will be mobilizing to make sure that … our community understands how dangerous Donald Trump is.”\nAlawieh expressed the belief that Harris will “do the right thing” and unite their party around “a more humane Gaza policy.”\nThe New York Times was first to report on the interaction.\n-ABC News’ Gabriella Abdul-Hakim\n‘I’m speaking’: Kamala Harris responds to cease-fire protesters during Detroit rally\nVice President Kamala Harris flew into an airport hangar with 15,000 spectators on Wednesday, where she continued a campaign blitz with her newly-minted running mate, Gov. Tim Walz.\nThe Detroit, Michigan event, in the critical battleground state, was a massive event with frequent applause and roars from the energetic crowd, with one notable interruption.\nDuring her remarks, Harris was met with a small group of pro-Palestinian protesters; however, the crowd tried to drown out the noise, chanting, “Kamala!”\nHarris grew increasingly animated, speaking louder with her prepared remarks — at the time focused on Project 2025 — before addressing the persistent protesters directly saying, “Everyone’s voice matters. But I am speaking now. I am speaking now.”\n“If you want Donald Trump to win, say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking,” Harris continued.\nHarris made headlines when she used the same phrase to shut down then Vice President Mike Pence when the two debated in 2020 and he interrupted her.\nHarris, who wrapped the day’s rally following a lengthy slate of prominent Michiganders, acknowledged the importance of the battleground state ahead of November.\n“So, it is so good to be back in Michigan. Listen, I am clear, the path to the White House runs right through this state. And with your help, we will win in November. We will win,” Harris said.\n-ABC News’ Kelsey Walsh\nBiden says he’s ‘not confident’ there would be a peaceful transfer of power if Trump loses\nPresident Joe Biden said in an interview with CBS News that he’s “not confident” there would be a peaceful transition of power after the election if former President Donald Trump loses.\n“Are you confident that there will be a peaceful transfer of power in 2025?” Robert Costa asked the president.\n“If Trump loses, I’m not confident at all,” Biden said in a roughly 30-second clip of the interview released Wednesday by the network.\nThe full sit-down interview is slated to air Sunday.\n-ABC News’ Michelle Stoddart\n‘I know bullies,’ Walz says as he, Harris tout campaign in Wisconsin rally\nAt their second joint rally since becoming a ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Wednesday ripped former President Donald Trump and sought to project a positive vision for their potential administration.\n“Understand in this fight, as Tim Walz likes to point out, we are joyful warriors,” Harris told the crowd in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\nWalz contrasted the approach with that of former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance, saying that as a former teacher, he understands “bullies.”\n“What I am is a teacher, I observe things. So, I want to tell you what I observed and you’ve observed … about these guys when you see them, that it’s a very clear thing. Yes, they are creepy and weird as hell. You see it,” he said. “This is not normal. This is not normal behavior. Nobody’s asking for this crazy stuff.”\nWalz, who joined the Army Reserve as a teenager, knocked Trump for having “no understanding of service.”\n“I’ll tell you what, Donald Trump, he sees the world differently than we see it. He has no understanding of service because he’s too busy servicing himself again and again and again,” he said. “This guy weakens our country to strengthen his own hands.”\n-ABC News’ Will McDuffie, Gabriella Abdul-Hakim, Fritz Farrow and Isabella Murray\nHarris HQ posts TikTok after Vance’s plane, Air Force Two on same tarmac\nThe Harris-Walz campaign posted a video on its TikTok account responding to earlier in the day when Sen. JD Vance’s plane and Air Force Two were on the same tarmac in Wisconsin.\nThe post used sound from the show “Dance Moms” where instructor and choreographer Abby Lee Miller says, “I just want to sit back and relax and enjoy my evening. When all of a sudden, I hear this agitating, grating voice.”\nThe video shows the vice president stepping off Air Force Two with Gov. Tim Walz while shaking hands and speaking with local children before panning to Vance’s plane as it pulled up on the tarmac.\n-ABC News Gabriella Abdul-Hakim, Fritz Farrow and Will McDuffie\nTrump previously told Walz he was ‘very happy’ with his handling of George Floyd protests\nIn the hours after Vice President Kamala Harris announced Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, allies of former President Donald Trump rushed to denigrate the Minnesota Democrat, seizing on criticism of his handling of the riots in the wake of George Floyd’s murder in May 2020.\nBut at the time, Trump expressed support for Walz’s handling of the protests, according to a recording of a phone call obtained by ABC News — telling a group of governors that Walz “dominated,” and praising his leadership as an example for other states to follow.\n“I know Gov. Walz is on the phone, and we spoke, and I fully agree with the way he handled it the last couple of days,” Trump told a group of governors on June 1, 2020, according to a recording of the call, in which he also called Walz an “excellent guy.”\n“I was very happy with the last couple of days, Tim,” Trump continued. “You called up big numbers and the big numbers knocked them out so fast it was like bowling pins.”\nTrump also suggested on the call that it was his encouragement that sparked Walz to call in the National Guard: “I said, you got to use the National Guard in big numbers,” Trump said. A spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign said Wednesday that was untrue.\nKaroline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, said Trump lauded Walz only after the governor heeded his advice to enlist support from the National Guard.\n-ABC News’ Lucien Bruggeman and Katherine Faulders\nHarris, Vance planes on same tarmac at same time in Wisconsin\nA rare moment took place Wednesday when the respective planes flying Vice President Kamala Harris and Sen. JD Vance to separate campaign events in Wisconsin were on the same tarmac.\nVance took the opportunity to rib the Harris-Walz campaign when he walked over to Air Force Two to “check out” what he called his “future plane.”\nVance said he saw Harris’ car, but he didn’t see her because her windows were tinted.\n-ABC News’ Hannah Demissie\nHarris, Trump tied among Wisconsin voters, poll finds\nA poll from Marquette University Law School published Wednesday of voters in Wisconsin found that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are closely matched among registered voters in a 2024 general election head-to-head matchup.\nAmong registered voters, Trump and Harris were split 50% to 49%, respectively, and among likely voters, they were split 49% to 50%, according to the poll.\nThe poll shows virtually no change from the split between President Joe Biden and Trump in a Marquette poll that was conducted in June.\nWhen a few third-party candidates are added in, Harris and Trump are still about even among registered voters, with Harris netting 45%, Trump netting 43% and independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. getting 8%, the poll found.\nThe survey was conducted between July 24 to Aug. 1. It has a margin of error of +/- 4.6 percentage points among registered Wisconsin voters and +/- 4.8 percentage points among likely Wisconsin voters.\n-ABC News’ Oren Oppenheim\nWalz greeted with ‘Let’s go coach’ chants as he visits campaign HQ\nGov. Tim Walz visited the campaign’s Wilmington headquarters Wednesday morning to a cheering crowd.\n“I wanted to say thank you myself to the people who have put everything into helping us win. Holy smokes, this team,” he said in a post on X.\nSeveral volunteers and staffers were outside holding signs and shook the governor’s hand as he greeted them, according to a video of the visit on his X account.\nThe crowd engaged in a chant of “Let’s go coach,” referencing Walz’s time as a high school football coach.\n“It’s Friday night lights,” Walz responded.\n-ABC News’ Will McDuffie, Gabriella Abdul-Hakim Isabella Murray and Fritz Farrow\nWalz greeted with ‘Let’s go coach’ chants as he visits campaign HQ\nGov. Tim Walz visited the campaign’s Wilmington headquarters Wednesday morning to a cheering crowd.\n“I wanted to say thank you myself to the people who have put everything into helping us win. Holy smokes, this team,” he said in a post on X.\nSeveral volunteers and staffers were outside holding signs and shook the governor’s hand as he greeted them, according to a video of the visit on his X account.\nThe crowd engaged in a chant of “Let’s go coach,” referencing Walz’s time as a high school football coach.\n“It’s Friday night lights,” Walz responded.\n-ABC News’ Will McDuffie, Gabriella Abdul-Hakim Isabella Murray and Fritz Farrow\nHarris-Walz campaign boasts ‘explosion of volunteer interest’\nThe Harris-Walz campaign issued a memo on Wednesday touting its ground game in battleground states, specifically Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\nThe memo boasted of a “formidable door-knocking operation” in Wisconsin with more than 160 full-time coordinated staffers on the ground, an “explosion of volunteer interest” in Michigan, with more than 9,000 new volunteer sign-ups, and “unprecedented enthusiasm” in Pennsylvania, citing Tuesday’s rally in Philadelphia that the campaign claims brought in more than 14,000 people.\nThe campaign said it has more than 600 coordinated staff members on the ground in those three states and plans to add 150 more in the first two weeks of August.\n-ABC News’ Will McDuffie, Gabriella Abdul-Hakim and Fritz Farrow\nHarris-Walz campaign says it raised $36M in 24 hours since VP announcement\nIn the first 24 hours since Vice President Kamala Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, the Harris-Walz campaign has raised $36 million, according to a campaign official.\n-ABC News’ Gabriella Abdul-Hakim\n22 Democratic governors, including Shapiro and Beshear, praise Harris’ selection of Walz as VP\nTwenty-two Democratic governors are lauding the fact that their colleague, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, has joined the 2024 Democratic ticket.\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, they stressed as a group of leaders — which includes some they said were “elected in very challenging races in battleground and red states” — that they were “thrilled” with Harris’ selection.\nThe joint statement was notably signed by Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who themselves were on the shortlist of potential Harris vice presidential picks. All three had submitted materials to the Democratic nominee’s vetting team, though only Shapiro had traveled to Washington, D.C., on Sunday for an in-person interview with Harris.\n“As America’s Democratic governors, we represent a broad and diverse set of 23 states that make up more than half the U.S. population. Many of us were elected in very challenging races in battleground and red states. We make tough decisions as state executives every day, and know what it takes to win. We couldn’t be more thrilled that Vice President Kamala Harris has selected Governor Tim Walz as her running mate, and will do everything in our power to ensure their success this November,” the statement, first shared with ABC News, reads.\n“Overall, there’s no doubt the Harris-Walz ticket is the perfect one-two punch to knock out the GOP’s dangerous agenda and failure to deliver for the American people,” the statement continues.\nOther governors who signed on to the letter include California’s Gavin Newsom, Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, Colorado’s Jared Polis, Maryland’s Wes Moore and North Carolina’s Roy Cooper.\nVance targets Harris’ ‘policy choices’ during Michigan stop\nGOP vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance delivered remarks following a briefing with the Shelby Township, Michigan, Police Department on Wednesday, where he went after Vice President Kamala Harris on her “policy choices.”\nVance’s remarks at the event focused on supporting law enforcement and combating undocumented immigration.\n“We’ve got to throw Kamala Harris out of office, not give her a promotion, and that’s what our law enforcement needs,” he said.\nWhen asked by reporters about how a Trump administration would actually deport undocumented immigrants (Trump has repeatedly vowed to deport millions of migrants), Vance gave no real plan on how that would happen but stated: “We are going to deport people now.”\nVance also took aim at his Democratic VP opponent, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a retired National Guardsman, questioning his military service while providing no facts to back up his claim. Vance also called out Walz for his comment during Tuesday’s rally in Philadelphia, where the governor called out the senator’s Ivy League education and support from tech billionaires.\n“And if he wants to criticize me for getting an Ivy League education, I’m proud of the fact that my mama supported me, that I was able to make something of myself,” Vance said.\nVance was again asked his thoughts about Trump falsely questioning Harris’ racial identity. Vance said he viewed Trump’s attack on the vice president as her being “a chameleon.”\n“I think he was observing the basic foundational reality that Kamala Harris pretends to be something different depending on which audience she’s speaking to,” the senator said.\n-ABC News’ Hannah Demissie\nTrump says he ‘could not be more thrilled’ about Walz as Harris’ VP pick\nFormer President Donald Trump said he “couldn’t believe” Vice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, adding he “could not be more thrilled,” when he called into Fox and Friends Wednesday morning.\n“I would say my reaction is, I can’t believe it.
