  "body_text": "Even before kick-off tomorrow there has been drama at the Women’s World Cup – Ireland’s star midfielder Denise O’Sullivan was injured in warm-up game against Columbia last Friday.\nHowever, the good news from the Irish camp is that despite initial fears that the injury might put her out of the games, the 29-year-old will start for the Republic of Ireland against Australia in the tournament opener at the Olympic stadium in Sydney.\nFor viewers tuning in to watch the women’s national team for the first time – and maybe even women’s football – Karen Duggan came into the studio to give In the News the low down on the Irish team, its star players and strengths, the challenges of the group and how the controversy around manager Vera Pauw impacted the team before they left for the southern hemisphere and the tournament favourites.\nDuggan, who has played for the national team, and in her Irish Times column analyses the game, is ideally placed to give an insider view. Presented by Bernice Harrison. Produced by Suzanne Brennan.",
