  "body_text": "Voting is already underway in the preliminary election for mayor of Boston, as three challengers take on incumbent Mayor Michelle Wu, a progressive seeking a second term at the helm of the city.\nAs the incumbent, Wu is considered the front-runner in the race, and polls show her leading by a wide margin. Her challengers are Robert Cappucci, a retired Boston police officer and perennial candidate; Domingos DaRosa, a longtime community activist and former Pop Warner football coach; and Josh Kraft, a nonprofit leader and the son of billionaire Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Learn more about all four candidates below.\nYou can check early voting locations here, and check your Election Day polling place here.\nRobert Cappucci\nAge: 80\nNeighborhood: East Boston\nKey Issues: Ending the Boston Trust Act, closing methadone clinics, no affordable housing or other benefits for undocumented immigrants\nFavorite place in Boston: The Dunkin’ Donuts on One Harbor St. in the Seaport\nFavorite Boston food: Legal Seafoods\nRobert Cappucci, 80, is a perennial political candidate and lifelong resident of East Boston. He’s run for office at least 13 times, between many unsuccessful bids for Boston mayor, Boston City Council, the Massachusetts House, and Congress. Cappucci successfully won election to the Boston School Committee in 1987, and was reelected to the position in 1989. His time in the post was cut short when then-Mayor Ray Flynn moved to transition the city’s elected school committee to a body with only mayoral appointees in 1991. He has not held elected office since.\nAdvertisement\nCappucci was born in a Cambridge hospital and raised in East Boston in a family comprising his parents and five children, he told the Globe. Cappucci’s father, Enrico Cappucci, represented East Boston in the Massachusetts House from 1937 to 1948. He graduated from Boston State College, which was absorbed into UMass Boston, with a degree in political science in 1968. He then enlisted in the Navy, served on active duty for two years, and was in the reserves for several more years, according to the National Personnel Records Center.\nCappucci spent roughly 10 years employed with the East Boston Community Development Corporation, working on housing and development issues, he said. He also worked as a Boston police officer for 13 years. In that time he earned a master’s degree in criminal justice from Anna Maria College. Cappucci retired in 2010 from the force, after a lifetime of being a “workaholic,” he told the Globe.\nCappucci is running as a Democrat, and said he is more concerned with economic and job issues over social issues. But Cappucci espouses conservative positions on many topics that he said are key priorities for him. He emphasized that as mayor he would end all so-called sanctuary city policies — a politicized term that immigration critics, most often on the right, frequently use to refer to municipalities that limit local officials’ cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts. He opposes Boston’s local ordinance known as the Trust Act, which only allows local officials to comply with federal immigration authorities’ requests to detain people for possible deportation if the person is also wanted for a serious crime.\nHe told the Globe he would move to close all methadone clinics, where people struggling with opioid addiction receive treatment and assistance reducing withdrawal symptoms. He also opposes Mayor Michelle Wu’s project to redevelop Franklin Park’s White Stadium for Boston Public Schools students in partnership with a professional women’s soccer team. He said he would move to ensure that no undocumented immigrants are able to access affordable housing programs or other social benefits, and would not allow any new homeless shelters in the city.\nAdvertisement\n“I have a platform that I think reflects the voters, and so the voters will decide, you know, do they want to keep the status quo,” Cappucci told the Globe. “I believe there are people out there, hopefully the majority, will give me an opportunity.”\nHe emphasized that he supports “law and order,” “peace through justice,” and assistance for veterans, seniors, and people with disabilities. Cappucci describes himself as a “lifelong bachelor” and practicing Catholic. He lives alone.\nDomingos DaRosa\nAge: 48\nNeighborhood: Hyde Park\nKey Issues: Boston Public Schools, public safety, and the economy/displacement\nFavorite place in Boston: On the field at Clifford Park, coaching football\nFavorite Boston food: Clam chowder\nWhether it’s gun violence in the city’s Cape Verdean community or needles strewn on athletic fields located near Mass. and Cass, Domingos DaRosa is known for his outspokenness — a reputation earned by not pulling punches when it comes to criticizing the city’s powers-that-be, including the mayor’s City Hall administration and Boston police.\nThe 48-year-old Hyde Park community activist has made his name in city political circles as a thorn-in-the-side of those in power. Now, for the fourth time, he is seeking public office.\nHis previous three attempts — all campaigns for an at-large City Council post — were unsuccessful. This time around, he’s running for the top job in municipal government: the mayoralty.\nAnd while City Hall observers characterize his current campaign as a long-shot bid for the fifth-floor City Hall corner office, DaRosa projects optimism.\n“Folks are tired of the same old politics,” he said.\nHis candidacy, he said, stands in contrast with those of front-runners Michelle Wu, the incumbent, and Josh Kraft, a nonprofit leader who has publicly jousted with the mayor for months. He gives voters another option: a product of Boston Public Schools, a renter, and someone who has been a victim of the city’s gun violence.\nAdvertisement\n“I’m a survivor of Boston,” he told the Globe recently over the phone.\nDaRosa said humanity is missing from city politics. People don’t treat each other well and the city is being sold to “the highest bidder,” he said.\n“We talk a good game, but we don’t deliver,” he said.\nFor too many Bostonians, the city is becoming unlivable, thanks to the rampaging housing and cost-of-living crises, he said.\nFailure to fix quality-of-life problems, such as mold, at public housing units over the years, has led to systemic and pricey overhauls of such developments, he said. Government should do a better job when it comes to maintaining such properties, he said.\nDaRosa said the city should simply be building more public housing. He said he would favor capping rental increases year-to-year.\n“We’ve lost so many of our neighbors because of the policies that are coming out of this administration,” said DaRosa. “We can’t continue to allow those families to be displaced because of those policies. It’s not an equitable city for all communities.”\nCentral to his campaign is the notion that Boston is simply not working for too many people.\nBoston Public Schools, he said, is a failing system. Too many students in the district won’t be able to get into prestigious local colleges because their schooling is lacking, he said.\nHe said he understands the plight of immigrants because he is one. He was 10 months old when he came to the US from Cape Verde. At the time, he said, he was undocumented. It’s important for the city to educate immigrants on their rights and what the law entails, including what is and is not covered under a city ordinance that spells out how and when police officers should interact with federal immigration authorities.\nAdvertisement\nRegarding White Stadium, he is against the city’s current plan, saying the structure should have never been demolished. He said he favors the plan put forward by the Franklin Park Defenders. The $64 million alternative proposal calls for a roughly 5,000-seat facility, compared to the 11,000-seat stadium of the current project. It would have fewer amenities — such as no professional-grade media and medical rooms or a beer garden.\nPublic safety is another major issued for DaRosa, who works in property maintenance. DaRosa has experienced street violence firsthand: a bullet grazed his leg outside his mother’s house in Dorchester in 2018. Two other men, including DaRosa’s brother, were shot in the incident.\nWhile homicides are at historically low levels in the city, DaRosa said that even one murder is too many.\nMass. and Cass, the epicenter of the city’s homelessness and opioid epidemics near Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard, also continues to be top of mind for DaRosa. In recent years, DaRosa has objected to the preponderance of dirty needles at Roxbury’s Clifford Park, located down the street from Mass. and Cass.\nThe conditions were so bad at one point Boston Bengals Pop Warner football program, which used the field for practice, merged with another team so that they could move their practice location.\nOpen drug-dealing and use on the streets of Boston, as well as quality of life issues on Mass. and Cass including public lewd acts, continue to be a problem, he said.\nAdditionally, not enough city jobs are going toward city residents, said DaRosa. He noted the income gap between Black and white households locally remains stubbornly large. And while the city has laws on the books requiring construction sites to meet certain diversity and residency quotas, projects have historically failed to meet such standards, he said.\nAdvertisement\nJosh Kraft\nAge: 58\nNeighborhood: North End\nKey issues: Housing, schools, Mass. and Cass\nFavorite place in Boston: Rose Kennedy Greenway, particularly where the mural is, near South Station\nFavorite Boston food: Pino’s Pizza in Brighton, because the college kids in the area breathe so much culture into our city\nJosh Kraft is best known for two things: his decades as a nonprofit leader in the city, and his privileged background as the third son of billionaire Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Josh Kraft has never had an operational role in the family business, though he did for years lead the family’s philanthropic efforts as head of the New England Patriots Foundation. A graduate of Williams College and the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Kraft worked for more than three decades at the Boys and Girls Club of Boston, including 12 years as its leader. His interest in nonprofit work started young; loved ones say he followed closely in the footsteps of his mother, Myra Kraft, who was beloved for her philanthropy work.\nKraft, 58, grew up in the nearby suburbs in Chestnut Hill and has lived most of his life just outside city limits. He moved in October 2023 to Boston, where he now lives on the waterfront in the North End with his partner, Michelle Perez Vichot. He has two grown daughters from a past marriage.\nKraft is a political newcomer; this is his first run for office. He’s involved himself in past races, however, as a political donor to Democrats — including Michelle Wu in 2021 — as well as Republicans, donations that his staff said were motivated by his support for Israel. Kraft is registered as a Democrat, though over the years he has voted in some GOP primaries.\nAs a candidate, Kraft has fought to define himself as his own person, distinguishing himself from his father, who has at times been a close friend and supporter of President Trump. The younger Kraft says he has never supported or voted for Trump and believes the president is unfit for office. Still, Kraft has benefited from his wealthy background and his family’s connections; he has put millions of dollars into his own campaign and received donations from associates of his father’s, including NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.\nKraft has focused his campaign largely on housing, which polling shows is the top issue for most Boston voters.\n“I’m running for mayor because Boston has become the most expensive city in America to raise a family,” Kraft said in a recent ad. “As mayor, I’ll listen — not lecture.”\nKraft says as mayor he would prioritize building more homes; he has blamed some Wu administration policies for blocking or delaying construction. He and Wu are split on a number of policies, including the idea of a real estate transfer tax, which would impose a small fee on high-dollar real estate sales to support housing efforts. Wu supports it, Kraft opposes it. They’re also divided on the issue of rent control, which Wu has championed as a signature issue for years. Kraft has proposed an alternate, opt-in form of the policy that would offer landlords tax breaks if they agree to cap annual rent increases. Wu has rejected that plan as “fake rent control.”\nOne of the candidates’ sharpest divides is over White Stadium, a decades-old facility that Wu is rebuilding into a home for BPS athletes as well as a professional women’s soccer team. Kraft argues the city should not be pouring tens of millions of taxpayer dollars into a project that will also benefit private interests. He has called Wu’s handling of the renovation a “catastrophic failure,” particularly because the mayor has not shared a recent cost estimate for the pricey project.\nOn immigration, Kraft, like Wu, supports the Boston Trust Act. Kraft has also called for the city to provide more support for individuals returning from incarceration. On transportation, Kraft has said he would immediately pause the construction of city bike lanes, and called for an audit of existing ones. His plan for Boston Public Schools would add more seats in coveted exam schools, change the district’s leadership structure, and transition from a fully appointed School Committee to a partially elected body.\nMichelle Wu\nAge: 40\nNeighborhood: Roslindale\nKey Issues: Community safety, housing affordability, education and youth opportunities\nFavorite place in Boston: Franklin Park\nFavorite Boston food: Roxbury Russet apples\nMichelle Wu is the mayor of Boston and a groundbreaking politician in the city’s history, as the first woman, person of color, and mother to be elected to City Hall’s top job. Wu has served as the city’s chief executive since she won the open mayoral race in 2021, after then-Mayor Martin J. Walsh left the role to serve as former president Joe Biden’s secretary of labor.\nWu, 40, was born in Chicago to Taiwanese immigrant parents, and is the oldest of four children. She attended Harvard College and worked as a consultant before moving back to Illinois to care for her two young sisters and her mother, who was struggling with mental illness. Wu often credits her experience opening and running a tea shop in Chicago — specifically, having to navigate the cumbersome city permitting process — as her inspiration for getting involved in local government. Wu later moved back to Boston with her mother and youngest sister to attend Harvard Law School, where she met her longtime mentor, US Senator Elizabeth Warren.\nShe worked in then-Mayor Thomas M. Menino’s administration, then on Warren’s first Senate campaign in 2012, before winning election to the Boston City Council as an at-large member in 2013. During her eight years on the council, she earned a reputation as an effective, policy-oriented workhorse and spearheaded several notable policy changes, including implementing a parental leave policy for municipal employees, and regulations on short term rentals such as Airbnbs.\nAs a first-time mayoral candidate in 2021, Wu ran an unapologetically progressive campaign, championing rent control, free public transit, and a municipal “Green New Deal,” among other issues. Now that she’s an incumbent running for a second term, some say she has evolved, focusing on a more pragmatic version of her earlier vision. Whereas she once supported reducing funding for BPD, Wu this year accepted the endorsement of the city’s largest police union, and touts the city’s low violent crime rates as one of her top accomplishments from her first four years as mayor.\nIn making her case for reelection, Wu also points to her expansion of pre-K and child-care seats, guaranteeing paid summer jobs for Boston Public Schools students, and efforts to increase the city’s affordable housing stock and promote home ownership opportunities for low-income families. Wu often says her goal is to “make Boston a home for everyone,” emphasizing her personal stake in the city’s future as a Boston Public Schools parent. Wu lives in Roslindale with her husband, Conor Pewarski, their three children — 10-year-old Blaise, 8-year-old Cass, and 7-month-old Mira — and Wu’s mother.\nShe’s also faced criticism and controversy over her administration’s implementation of bike lanes across the city, and her plan to redevelop Franklin Park’s White Stadium for Boston Public Schools students in partnership with a new professional women’s soccer team.\nIn recent months, she’s gained national attention over her fierce defense of the city’s diverse communities and immigrant-friendly public safety policies in the face of the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts. From Capitol Hill, to City Hall plaza, and the set of “The Daily Show,” Wu has defied pressure and threats from the Trump administration to roll back the city’s ordinance that limit local officials’ cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts.\nThe resulting spotlight has earned her a reputation of being an example of successful Democratic leadership in the resistance to Trump’s White House.\n“At a time when this federal administration is already causing so much fear and harm in our communities, these threats are serious and consequential, but our same communities have told me loud and clear that silence in the face of oppression is not an option,” Wu proclaimed at an August press conference.\n“The Trump administration seeks to divide, isolate, and intimidate cities and make Americans fearful of one another,” she continued. “But Boston is proof of something far more powerful than lies and intimidation; that safety and community come from loving your neighbor as yourself.”\nNiki Griswold can be reached at niki.griswold@globe.com.
