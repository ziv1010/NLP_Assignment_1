She hugged Girma and then pointed at the blue on the defender's shirt while laughing.\nChelsea teammate Lucy Bronze then joined the duo and hugged them both before Bright whispered something in Girma's ear.\nChelsea fans react to Girma interaction\nEvery time this video comes on my timeline I lock in like a baby watching cocomelon pic.twitter.com/2yXgUDIS64December 2, 2024\nGirma, 24, currently plays for National Women's Soccer League team San Diego Wave and the club is the only one she has played for in her senior career.\nThe US star, who won the Olympic gold medal at the Paris Games, is a centre-back which is a position Chelsea recently suffered an injury in.\nKadeisha Buchanan has been sidelined for a number of months after rupturing her ACL and so the Blues are in the market for a defender.\nThe club itself have not confirmed or hinted about Girma's arrival but fans went wild on social media after Girma's encounter with Bright.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nOne wrote: \"Girma X Bright at CB Wowwww. Sonia Bringggggg.\"\nAnother posted: \"Millie Bright told her this the blue that u will wear with Chelsea.\"\nAnd a third added: \"Chelsea girls talking with Girma and pointing at the blue on her shirt after last nights match, I’m taking it as confirmation. Sonia sign her and make her Chels please (I’m so delusional but I’m manifesting).\"\nIf Chelsea do sign Girma it would be another landmark addition to the Women's Super League champions. In FourFourTwo's view it would be one of the Blues' best signings with Girma's signature one a lot of clubs would want.\nGirma is one of the best defenders in the world and has more than proved her skills despite only playing in senior football for three seasons.\nAmong her achievements was being the first defender to ever be named US player of the year.\nHer prowess would only embolden an impressive Chelsea team this campaign.\nThe Blues are yet to lose a game, they sit top of the WSL table and are already through to the Women's Champions League knockout stage with two games to spare.\nSarah joined the FourFourTwo team in September 2024 in a freelance role.
