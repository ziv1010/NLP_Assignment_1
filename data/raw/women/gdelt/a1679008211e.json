Sign up here.\nThe Athletic crew battled long flights, sprinted through short layovers and has had lots of fun with time zone calculations. All this to say, we’ve made it to the future and it looks bright. I’m Emily Olsen, here with Meg Linehan and Steph Yang — welcome to Full Time!\nAdvertisement\nDown Under Download\nMeet our team\nThe U.S. women’s national team has settled into camp in Auckland, New Zealand.\n“We are pretty much fully acclimated,” USWNT midfielder Kristie Mewis told the media Monday. “We are in a good mental and physical spot. The time difference was huge but we’ve done it a million times.”\nWe here at The Athletic have done it a bit less. All the same, we are excited to share our team on the ground and around the world:\n- All about the USWNT? You can follow Meg Linehan, Steph Yang, Jeff Rueter and Kim McCauley every step of the way\n- For England, it’s mainly Charlotte Harpur, Chloe Morgan, Katie Whyatt, Jacob Whitehead and Michael Cox\n- For Spain, it’s Laia Cervelló Herrero\nWe are also excited to introduce our guest columnists: USWNT midfielder Sam Mewis, former Tottenham defender Jenna Schillaci, Wrexham’s Paul Mullin, Arsenal and Netherlands forward Vivianne Miedema and former Liverpool, Everton and Brighton player Fern Whelan.\nHere’s a taste of preview content the team has put together:\n- The Radar: 50 players to know\nGroup guides: Who’s in the group of death?\nAll 32 World Cup home kits rated\nThe story behind the U.S.’s celeb-packed intro video\nCelebrities may not be just like us, but they do know that when you get an opportunity to announce a member of the U.S.’s World Cup team, you say yes.\nThe USWNT’s roster was revealed in style with the likes of Megan Thee Stallion, Blake Lively, John Cena and many more in a video released by U.S. Soccer. So how did they do it? Well, they called in a talent agency led by Mary-Hollis Beighley.“I think the names speak for themselves in the sense that these kinds of high-profile stars don’t do anything that they don’t want to do,” Beighley pointed out. “Everybody really was jumping at the opportunity to do it.”\nBut how did they decide which celebrities would introduce which players? Steph has the full story.\nMeg, meanwhile, has mixed feelings about another recent video…\nMeg’s Corner\nSophia Smith’s killer smile\nNike’s World Cup campaigns have long been appointment viewing, and this year is somehow both no different, and very different. The company has done something I’ve not seen them, or anyone really, do across an entire campaign — feature the players’ individual personalities on and off the field and get it right. (That old school Mia Hamm and Michael Jordan spot of one-upmanship is great but not really about Mia.)\nAdvertisement\nSophia Smith’s video is stellar — specific and weird and so, so good. As I wrote in The Radar, don’t be surprised if Smith shows out at the 2023 World Cup — she’s an elite finisher who can kill you with a smile and a shrug. And well… just watch.\nAnother top-class video in the series is Megan Rapinoe’s. The 2019 Ballon d’Or winner doesn’t actually feature in-person, rather she’s depicted as a motorcycle-riding, pink-haired superhero in the style of your favorite ‘80’s cartoon complete with a theme song that will get stuck in your head. (Can we please talk about the cartoon Sue Bird cameo?)\nAnd it’s not just USWNT players, Debinha’s security cam antics as she lives that Joga Bonito life while doing her shopping is perfectly saucy. Watch here. With this being Marta’s last World Cup, Debinha has officially found her own spotlight.\nBrazil forward @Debinha7 lives and breathes joga bonito, on and off the pitch.\nNot convinced?\nLet’s roll that security footage.#JustDoIt #NikeFC pic.twitter.com/tBP7VLQiSw— Nike Football (@nikefootball) July 13, 2023\nOne big issue, though: Nike’s U.S. website sells Brazil jerseys, but they don’t offer any customization options to put player names and numbers on the back. How can that be? Do they not like money?\nWorld Cup Vibe Check\nSo what’s the vibe in USWNT camp?\nAiming for an unprecedented three-peat, surely the atmosphere within the U.S.’s training base is getting tense, right? Let’s take a look…\nOK, maybe not. Even with a lot of younger players and new faces, this is a group that seems self-assured and up to the challenge. Sometimes it helps to be a little goofy when you have an intense month ahead. (Sorry to Crystal Dunn, who got absolutely nailed by the sprinkler on her way out to training, much to the suppressed delight of her teammates watching it happen.)\nAdvertisement\nFun Time World Cup Trivia\nTest your knowledge\nThe World Cup is exciting, stressful, and heartbreaking. But also fun. And what’s more fun than trivia?\nToday’s question: With the expansion to 32 teams, which eight teams will be making their FIFA Women’s World Cup debuts in Australia and New Zealand?\nCheck back tomorrow for the answer!\nFull Time First Looks\nPart of the Qatar World Cup’s legacy was decided in a Zurich courtroom, six months after the tournament’s conclusion. So what lessons can the 2023 Women’s World Cup learn from Qatar?\nThe tournament hasn’t even begun yet and Australia is already drawing record crowds (for a warm-up match!). Steph Yang was there.\nCanada’s Julia Grosso could be a key player for them in this tournament\nNigeria is involved in a three-way power struggle days before the Women’s World Cup\nChristen Press shared some heartbreaking news: She’ll need another surgery. Her post is well worth reading.\n(Photo by Richard Heathcote/Getty Images)",
