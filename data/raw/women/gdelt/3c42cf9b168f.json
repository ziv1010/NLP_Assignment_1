This was not an easy game and I am glad we managed to score and secure this result,” Chombo said.\nShe further revealed that her technical team had carefully studied South Sudan’s style of play in preparation for the match which helped the team approach the game strategically.\n“We knew what to expect from South Sudan, so we went into the match with a clear plan. Now we must stay focused because the second leg on Friday is equally important,” she added.\nMalawi will need at least a draw to progress while South Sudan will have to win by a margin of three goals to overturn the deficit on second leg.\nThis victory gives Malawi a significant boost in their quest to qualify for the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup, a tournament the country has never reached before.",
