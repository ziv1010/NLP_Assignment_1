Spain is the fifth winner in nine editions of the Women's World Cup and joins Germany as the only two nations to win both the men's and women's tournament.\nSpain's men's team won in 2010. Spain played in the final in only its third appearance in the women's tournament.\n___\nSpain has won its first Women's World Cup championship with a 1-0 victory over England.\nThe win for Spain in just its third World Cup appearance prevented the Lionesses — the reigning European champions — from bringing the trophy back to England for the first time since 1966. England's men's team won the nation's only World Cup that year.\nSpain won on a goal from Olga Carmona in the 29th minute. The left back scored in back-to-back World Cup games for Spain, which has a tournament-best 18 goals in this World Cup, and became just the seventh player in tournament history to score in both the semifinals and the final.\nSpain, which had a near mutiny last year when 15 players quit the national team, was the more aggressive team in the final and pressed the entire game.\nMore in Sports\nBarcelona fans tear into several players amid Atlético disaster\nThe England loss was the first this tournament for coach Sarina Wiegman, who was hired in late 2021 as the team’s first non-British manager. It was also Wiegman's second consecutive loss in the finale.\nShe is the only coach in the history of the tournament to take two nations to the final; Wiegman was coach of the Netherlands when the Dutch lost 2-0 to the United States in 2019.\nThe finale guaranteed a first-time Women's World Cup winner as neither Spain or England had ever hoisted the trophy.\n____\nSpain teenage star Salma Paralluelo was given a yellow card following a collision with England defender Alex Greenwood late in the second half.\nThe two collided and Greenwood appeared to be knocked in the head by a high knee from Paralluelo to her head. The knock drew blood and a lengthy stoppage as England brought a clean uniform onto the field for Greenwood to change into.\nShe resumed the game with a huge white bandage wrapped around her head.\nSpain leads 1-0 with a first-half goal.\n___\nEngland goalkeeper Mary Earps stopped Spain from taking a commanding lead in the Women's World Cup final when she saved a Jenni Hermoso penalty kick.\nHermoso's attempt in the 69th minute came after Keira Walsh was called for a handball violation. The penalty was called after a VAR review.\nSpain holds a 1-0 lead after Olga Carmona scored in the 29th minute.\n___\nEngland has picked up its play in the second half of the Women's World Cup final while trailing 1-0 to Spain.\nThe improved offense has been a reprieve for England goalkeeper Mary Earps, who has been tested throughout and was forced to make another huge save early in the second half.\nAitanna Bonmatti fired a strike from outside the area in the 51st minute. The ball was slightly deflected and Earps had to adjust to steer the ball away from the corner of the net.\nIt started a flurry of action as two minutes later, Lauren Hemp cut down the left flank and passed the ball to Lauren James, but James misplaced her pass and gifted Spain a throw-in.\nIn the next minute, Chloe Kelly had an excellent cross from the right wing to Hemp at the back post. Hemp fired her shot narrowly past the Spanish net. Kelly and James were second-half substitutions.\nHemp was given a yellow card moments later for a late tackle on Salma Paralluelo.\n___\nEngland playmaker Lauren James was substituted into the Women's World Cup final at the start of the second half with Spain leading 1-0.\nJames was on the bench for the start following her two-game suspension for stomping on a Nigeria player in the round of 16. James came into the game along with Chloe Kelly in what appeared to be a four-back set for England.\nSpain made no substitutions.\n____\nSpain took a 1-0 lead over England into the break of the Women's World Cup final on Sunday.\nSpain went up 1-0 in the 29th minute with a firm strike from Olga Carmona. The left back has scored in back-to-back World Cup games for Spain, which has a tournament-best 18 goals in this World Cup.\nSpain has scored first in four of its World Cup matches.\nEngland playmaker Lauren James was on the bench for the first half following her two-game suspension for stomping on a Nigeria player in the round of 16.\nAlthough both teams had early scoring chances, Spain was the first-half aggressor.\nLa Roja has dominated possession and Aitanna Bonmatti whipped in a free kick in the 36th minute that England captain Millie Bright swiped clear. But it gave Irene Paredes an opportunity the defender couldn't convert with her strike.\nTeenage super-sub Salma Paralluelo, in the starting lineup for the first time this tournament, then nearly scored right at the half but her shot was inches wide of the goal.\n___\nThe Women's World Cup final between England and Spain has started in what statistically should be a close match.\nSpain through the tournament has created almost twice as many scoring chances per game (24) than England (14). But the Lionesses are considered a more clinical team.\nEngland coach Sarina Wiegman is undefeated in this tournament with six wins to reach the final. Wiegman, who was hired in late 2021 as the team’s first non-British manager, is back in her second consecutive finale.\nShe's the only coach in the history of the tournament to take two nations to the final. Wiegman was coach of the Netherlands when the Dutch lost 2-0 to the United States in 2019.\nBut, England has scored fewer goals than Spain in this World Cup on its way to the championship game. Spain has scored 17 goals, to 13 for England. Conversely, Spain has conceded seven goals to England's three.\nEngland has three clean sheets in the tournament.\n___\nGareth Southgate, coach of England's men's soccer team, said he had “no advice” for women's counterpart Sarina Wiegman ahead of the Women's World Cup final against Spain.\n“You’re doing a brilliant job, so that’s the first thing, and of course there is no advice because you’ve done more than us already, and you know what is needed to win,” Southgate said in a nearly seven-minute star-studded video posted to the Lionesses' social media account ahead of Sunday's game.\nThe video featured multiple British celebrities wishing the team luck as England tries to win its first Women's World Cup title, and first World Cup for the nation since the men's team won in 1966.\n\"All that remains is to wish you the very best for the final, and we hope you can bring that trophy back. Good luck everybody,\" Southgate said.\nOther celebrities featured in the video included England men's captain Harry Kane, former Spice Girls Gerri Halliwell and Emma Bunton, alternative rock singer Yungblud and former Manchester United star Rio Ferdinand.\n“This is a moment, man. This is history in the making,” Ferdinand said. “You girls are close. I have every faith in you, so please, make me cry. Make me cry.\"\n___\nEngland retained the same starting lineup for the Women’s World Cup final as the Lionesses' used in their seminal victory, which meant playmaker Lauren James was on the bench Sunday against Spain.\nJames is returning from a two-game suspension for stomping on a Nigeria player in the round of 16. The 21-year-old James apologized to her teammates but was not available for England's wins over Colombia and Australia.\nThe Chelsea winger scored three goals and had three assists in the tournament prior to her red card.\nElla Toone, who started in place of James during her suspension, was the listed starter for England against Spain.\n___\nUEFA President Aleksander Čeferin was not in attendance for the Women’s World Cup final despite the championship match featuring two European teams.\nEngland and Spain were facing off for what will be the first Women's World Cup title for either team.\nUEFA instead was represented by Nadine Kessler, technical director of women’s soccer.\nČeferin was in Athens on Wednesday for the Super Cup final between Manchester City and Sevilla.

He is the president of England's Football Association. Both he and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have been criticized for not traveling to the game. Queen Letizia of Spain and her 16-year-old daughter are in Sydney to cheer on La Roja.\nIn a video posted on the Prince and Princess of Wales′ social media account, William wished the Lionesses luck alongside his daughter Princess Charlotte, who held a ball.\n“Lionesses, I want to send you a huge good luck for tomorrow. We’re sorry we can’t be there in person, but we’re so proud of everything you have achieved and the millions you’ve inspired here and around the world. So go out there tomorrow and really enjoy yourselves,” William said.\nPrincess Charlotte added: \"Good luck Lionesses.\"\n___\nTeenage super-sub Salma Paralluelo is in Spain's starting lineup for the Women’s World Cup championship game Sunday against England, while star Alexia Putellas returns to the bench.\nParalluelo scored the game-winning goal against the Netherlands in extra time of the quarterfinals, and the 19-year-old scored Spain's go-ahead goal in the semifinal victory over Sweden. The Barcelona forward provided a much-needed boost off the bench every time Spain coach Jorge Vilda called on her.\nPutellas has been recovering from a torn ACL suffered last year and has been used in various roles throughout the tournament. She started in the semifinal against Sweden.\nSpain announced its starting lineup on social media.\n___\nAP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/fifa-womens-world-cup",
