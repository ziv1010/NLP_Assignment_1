That will have an influence on us.\"\nBarcelona thrashed Wolfsburg 5-1 at Camp Nou last season in the semi-final first leg, but the Germans earned a 2-0 home win in the second.\n\"You also see that in most of the return legs, it isn't quite the same and they're not so extremely superior and because of that, I see our chance,\" added Popp.\nBarcelona players know their opponents well, with Graham Hansen, who netted in both semi-finals games against Chelsea, Fridolina Rolfo and Ingrid Engen playing for Wolfsburg before moving to Spain.\nEngen, who started Wolfsburg's 2020 final defeat by Lyon as well as the Catalans' own loss last year, hopes it's third time lucky for her.\n\"I remember thinking after both finals I am sure I will lift this trophy, it has made the dream even bigger,\" Engen told international media in an interview.\n\"I haven't been talking to (my former team-mates) before this game, you don't want to do that when it's getting closer… but it's going to be special to meet them.\"\n© 2023 AFP",
