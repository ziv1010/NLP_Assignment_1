  "body_text": "JETS legend Jason Hoffman is confident that an annual clash between the A-League club and Northern NSW All-Stars can be a highlight of the football calendar.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nAll-Stars men's co-coach Peter McGuinness would like to see the representative program expand further.\nA crowd of more 2500 watched the Jets take on the best of the local competition in men's and women's games at Darling Street Oval on Saturday.\nThe Jets were victorious in both, winning 4-0 in the men's and 6-2 in the women's.\nThe locals were ultra-competitive in both games.\n\"The idea of the games is to drive a stronger connection between the different tiers of the football pyramid in the region,\" said Hoffman, who is now the Jets' head of commercial.\n\"We will learn a lot from the event on Saturday, and hopefully, year on year, it will become bigger.\n\"This was year one to get the ball rolling; see what works and what doesn't work.\n\"What it does is put local players in front of our coaches.\n\"The women's team has always had a strong local representation.\n\"With the men, this season in particular, coach Mark Milligan has given local players opportunities.\n\"These games are important to help identify players who may not have followed the traditional path.\"\nThe timing of the All-Star event will be the key element\n\"The idea is to plan the event early enough to ensure it works for all parties,\" Hoffman said.\n\"Northern will have coaches and sessions available for those players who aren't in the finals and need to stay fit.\n\"From our side of things, we have to liaise with the men's and women's coaches regarding what is the best fit for their preseason preparations.\"\nThe All-Stars men's side went to the break at nil-all with a young Jets outfit, which McGuinness said was further proof of the talent in the NPL.\n\"The Jets are getting closer to their season. They are training every day and are very fit,\" McGuinness said. \"I think the game showed there is a lot of talent in Newcastle and given the right environment , I think there are more players here who could play at a higher level.\n\"The first half, in particular, was really good.\n\"We were very competitive, created a few more chances and, with better execution, we could have scored.\n\"Chris Hatfield was excellent. I was realy impressed with his attitude at training and how he trained. Braedyn Crowley was really good, Jack Simmons was good, Jarred Baker... there were a number of them who were really good.\n\"Our legs give way a little bit at the end.\n\"Daniel McFarlane is a terrific player, but he hadn't played for five weeks.\"\nThe All-Stars, which drew players from nine clubs, had three training sessions to prepare.\n\"It was a bit of a pilot run, bringing back the rep team,\" McGuinness said. \"I think Northern BSW did a pretty good job bringing it together.\n\"I love to see the program expand. Add one or two more games Players selected could be told a bit earlier. There are some things we could improve on for sure. It has lots of merit.\"\nRose blossoms as Jets work overtime to topple gallant All-Stars\nLACHIE Rose had made a slow start to the preseason for the Newcastle Jets, but the energiser bunny striker appears cherry ripe for the Australian Cup final.\nRose came off the bench to score a double as the Jets overpowered the Northern NSW All-Stars 4-0 at Darling Street Oval on Saturday.\nNew coach Mark Milligan has taken his time with Rose, who had a breakout season in 2024-25 with eight goals.\nAgain, he came off the bench, but boy, did he make an impact.\nThe All-Stars had given as good as they got in an absorbing first half.\nThe injection of Rose at the break turned the match. He put pressure on the All-Stars' back four and made run after run.\nAfter Oscar Fryer broke the deadlock in the 49th minute, Rose converted from the penalty spot in the 55th minute.\nTen minutes later, Rose used his pace to get in behind and then chipped the keeper.\nXavier Bertoncello, who was introduced alongside Rose at half-time, scored the goal of the match in the 80th minute.\nHe skipped back on the inside and then hit a stinging shot inside the left post.\nIt was a high-quality, entertaining game played in front of 2500.\nThe All-Stars were impressive, especially in the first half.\nThe Jets take on Heidelberg in the Australia Cup final at Lakeside Stadium on October 4.\nOn Saturday, Mark Milligan went with a youth outfit, with skipper Kosta Grozos the only player over the age of 23.\nAnd they were forced to work hard by an All-Star side that got the balance right between attack and defence.\nThe Jets dominated possession, but for all their endeavour, they didn't create any clear-cut chances in an even opening 45 minutes.\nEli Adams had the best chance, but his shot lacked enough venom to beat Lewis Alvarez.\nAdams limped off with a leg injury in the 30th minute and was replaced by Lucas Scicluna.\nOscar Fryer should have put the Jets ahead in the 40th minute when left unmarked on the left edge of the box, but he pulled his shot wide off the right post.\nChris Hatfield and Braedyn Crowley were a constant threat for the All-Stars, while James Cresnar and Jack Simmons were strong in midfield.\nMilligan introduced Rose and Bertoncello at the break.\nAll of a sudden the A-League side was on the front foot.\nIn the 49th minute, they went ahead courtesy of Fryer.\nScicluna drove down the left and crossed toward the penalty spot, and Fryer beat two defenders to he ball and rifled a shot past replacement keeper Ben Conway.\nThe Jets continued to push hard and made it 2-0 in the 55th minute.\nAgain, Fryer burst into the box and was brought down by Xander Woweries.\nRose made no mistake from the spot, sending Conway the wrong way.\nThe Jets were on top and they made it 3-0 in the 65th through Rose. Released by Scicluna, Rose took a touch and then chippeed Conway.\nMeanwhile, Jets winger India Breier could not have made a better first impression on new coach Stephen Hoyle, bagging a first-half hat-trick in a 6-0 win over Northern NSW All-Stars women.\nHoyle, who officially starts on Wednesday, has taken the reins from Ryan Campbell and has been overhauling the roster ahead of preseason training this week.\nBreier pressed her claims. She slotted home from close range after the All-Stars failed to clear a corner in the 20th minute.\nShe added a second three minutes later, collecting a Cassidy Davis through ball and sliding a low shot past the keeper.\nThe third came just before half-time, side-footing a Lauren Allan cross into the corner.\nTeenager Alexis Collins took the limelight in the second half, with a well-taken brace.\nShe ran onto an inch-perfect pass in behind by Davis in the 55th minute and then beat the keeper one-on-one in the 62nd minute.\nMakayla Clinton completed the scoring in the 72nd minute with a stinging left-foot shot from the edge of the box.\nThe All-Stars never stopped trying and were rewarded in the 83rd minute with a well-taken goal by Jemma House.\nDavis and Emma Dundas were also strong for the Jets.\nSophie Nenadovic, Ani Jansen and Jemma House were the All-Stars' best.\nBYRNE TRADED BAREFOOT BOWLS AND BEERS FOR SGOT AT JETS\nDAN Byrne had planned to be in Mudgee on an end-of-season trip after a triumphant season with Kahibah FC.\nA round of golf. Maybe some barefoot bowls. A few beers, no doubt. The perfect way to celebrate a season in which the Rams won promotion to the NPL.\nInstead, Byrne will be lining up for the Northern NSW All-Stars against the Newcastle Jets at Darling Street Oval on Saturday (5pm).\nWhat's more, the winger couldn't be happier.\n\"It's an exciting opportunity, too good to miss,\" Byrne said. \"The Kahibah boys have told me they will be tuning in to BarTV to watch the game. I'm not sure what activity they have on the cards for Saturday evening. Our captain, Robbie Turnbull, is organising everything and has kept most things secret. We didn't find out we were going to Mudgee until last week.\"\nByrne is likely to start on the bench in an attacking All-Stars side spearheaded by Braedyn Crowley, Chris Hatfield, Daniel McFarlane, Drew Patterson and Jarred Baker.\nThe 20-year-old joined Kahibah from Lambton Jaffas at the start of the 2024 season.\nHe scored 18 goals to collect the Northern League One Young Player of the Year in his maiden season and was instrumental in Kahibah's climb to the top in the recently completed campaign.\n\"I told Mat Moncrieff (football operations manager) when I joined Kahibah last year that I didn't just want to kick the ball around,\" Byrne said. \"I wanted to make something of it and make sure the team got promoted in the next couple of years. We went and did it. Everyone is so keen for next year. All the boys are excited to be in the NPL.\"\nFor now, Byrne's focus is on the Jets and representing Northern NSW.\n\"Everyone is expecting the Jets to win, but we are not going to be a pushover,\" Byrne said. \"It's been great training with the All-Stars side and seeing how the other players, like Braedyn Crowley, go about it.\n\"It would be unreal to make the next step. It's definitely not past me, but I've accepted the fact that it might not happen.\"\nByrne is the only player selected from the Northern League One competition.\nNPL premiers Broadmeadow Magic have the largest representation with five players.\nThe squad had just three training sessions to prepare.\n\"The more often these representative programs are done, the better players can prepare,\" co-coach Peter McGuinness said. \"If it is a permanent fixture on the calendar, the players know it is coming.\n\"We want to be very competitive and for players to show what they have got.\n\"Some have been through the Jets academy or at the Mariners, and others haven't.\n\"It's an opportunity for them to put their hand up and say: 'here we are, have a look at us'.\n\"Obviously, it is going to be a very big test. The Jets are only a few weeks away from the start of the season.\n\"It is difficult for us with only three training sessions. We gave them a couple of things last night regarding how we want to set up defensively. In the two sessions before that, we looked at what we want to do with the ball. They are smart footballers. They understand.\"\nThe Jets meet Heidelberg in the final of the Australia Cup in a fortnight, and coach Mark Milligan is using the hit-out against the All-Stars as a selection trial.\n\"I don't care who we are playing; we have to be at our best,\" Milligan said. \"That is the team we want to be every time we step onto the pitch.\n\"This is another test. I'm sure the players will face things that they haven't faced before. It is a chance for them to learn and overcome those things.\n\"We have a Cup game soon. I am nowhere near set on a team for the Cup final. It is a good opportunity for a lot of them to show me that they should be starting.\"\nThe men's game will be preceded by the NNSW All-Stars women's side taking on the Jets at 3pm.\nThe Jets women don't start training until next week, but it is an early chance to impress new coach Stephen Hoyle.\nNNSW men: Aden Gage Raftery, Ben Conway (GK), Braedyn Crowley, Dan Byrne, Daniel McFarlane, Drew Patterson, Ian Matthews, Jack Simmons, James Cresnar, Jarred Baker, Chris Hatfield, Lewis Alvarez (GK), Reece McManus, Riley Taylor, Tom Beecham, Tyler Harrison, Will Ingram, Xander Woweries.
