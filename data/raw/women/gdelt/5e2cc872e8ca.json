  "body_text": "In an interview with Siena play-by-play man Robert Lee last week, MAAC commissioner Travis Tellitocci hinted that the conference is considering changing its name.\nThe MAAC is considering changing its name, so we asked the people to rename it\nThe people delivered.\n“In what way do we separate ourselves from the other 32 conferences,” Tellitocci said. “A lot of that has to do with branding and marketing. One thing that we’re looking at right now is just the name of the MAAC. It’s a little confusing, we’re the MAAC with two-A’s, the MAAC that doesn’t play football.”\nSo we asked the people what they would rename the MAAC if it were up to them.\nThe people delivered.\nThe most common “serious answer” was simply “Metro” or some form of that. That way, the league can stay as the “MAAC” but change the branding to something that is less likely to be confused with another Division I league.\nI attempted to come up with good options for the league, and the only other one that came to mind was “Corridor Collegiate Conference” or “CCC” in reference to the northeast corridor part of the country that most of the league is settled within.\nThe MAAC Men’s and Women’s Basketball Championships take place in Atlantic City, NJ in less than two weeks.",
