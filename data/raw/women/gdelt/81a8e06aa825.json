  "body_text": "Saturday’s briefing: Tuchel has ‘no problem’ leaving out Bellingham\nEngland boss Thomas Tuchel says he has “no problem” with Jude Bellingham after leaving the Real Madrid star out of his squad for next week’s friendly against Wales and the World Cup qualifier in Latvia.\nAnge Postecoglou retains the support of Nottingham Forest’s board after the club’s fans turned on him following their midweek Europa League defeat and Manchester City winger Savinho has signed a two-year contract extension.\nAntoine Semenyo struck two late goals for Bournemouth as they beat Fulham 3-1 at home to climb second in the Premier League table.\nThomas Tuchel has ‘no problem’ with Jude Bellingham\nThomas Tuchel insisted there was “no problem” between him and Jude Bellingham but warned nobody was guaranteed a place in the England squad after taking the bold decision to omit the Real Madrid star.\nThe 22-year-old missed September’s camp after undergoing shoulder surgery and, despite since playing four club matches, there was no place in the 24-man squad announced for October’s double-header.\nRejuvenated Phil Foden and Jack Grealish were also overlooked for the upcoming Wembley friendly against Wales and World Cup qualifier in Latvia as Tuchel followed up his decision to snub now injured Trent Alexander-Arnold last time around.\n“He is a very special player and for special players there can always be special rules,” England boss Tuchel said. “I get this. But for this camp, we decided that we stick with our straightforward decision to invite the same team.\n“That applies also then for Jude. He deserves always to be in camp. He wanted to be called up. We had a phone call. There was no issue from that side, he just lacks rhythm. He hasn’t finished one complete match.”\nAntoine Semenyo bags brace in Bournemouth fightback\nAntoine Semenyo’s double and a stunning strike from Justin Kluivert saw Bournemouth soar to second in the Premier League courtesy of 3-1 comeback win over Fulham at a rain-soaked Vitality Stadium.\nAndoni Iraola’s Cherries looked set to suffer a first top-flight defeat since the opening day of the season after the Cottagers soaked up the pressure to edge in front through Ryan Sessegnon.\nBut Semenyo produced a moment of magic to level in the 78th minute before substitute Kluivert further lit up a soggy south-coast encounter by lashing in from distance.\nSemenyo sealed victory deep into added time by clinically finishing a counter-attack led by Ben Gannon-Doak as the Cherries stretched their unbeaten run to six top-flight games to leave them a point behind leaders Liverpool.\nAnge Postecoglou retains Forest board’s support\nAnge Postecoglou retains the immediate support of the Nottingham Forest board but amid reports that he needs a quick upturn in results starting with Sunday’s clash at Newcastle.\nPostecoglou, who took over as Forest boss on September 9, has failed to win any of his first six games in charge, with the latest defeat coming on Thursday night in the Europa League when they were beaten 3-2 at home by Danish side Midtjylland.\nIt did not take Forest fans long to turn on their new boss and chants of “you’re getting sacked in the morning” were aimed the way of the Forest dugout where Postecoglou stood with his hands on his head.\nIn a press conference earlier on Friday, Postecoglou said: “It’s a valid assumption in modern football that there’s always a manager under pressure. That’s just part and parcel of what we do and I just don’t think that way.\n“Put it this way, I knew I was getting sacked at Tottenham about three or four months before I did but it didn’t stop me winning something.”\nSavinho agrees two-year extension with Manchester City\nWe're pleased to announce Savinho has extended his contract at City until 2031! ✍️ pic.twitter.com/2tebDUUARA\n— Manchester City (@ManCity) October 3, 2025\nBrazil winger Savinho has committed his future to Manchester City by signing a two-year contract extension that runs until 2031 with the option of a further 12 months.\nThe 21-year-old was a transfer target for Tottenham in the summer after his first season with City saw him score three goals and provide 13 assists in 48 appearances, but he now looks to be staying at the Etihad Stadium for many years to come.\n“I am incredibly proud to be able to sign this new contract with City,” Savinho said. “It’s a very special feeling to know that Pep (Guardiola) and the club have placed such faith in me. It really means a lot to me and my family.”\nRuben Amorim: Don’t blame my playing system\nRuben Amorim accepts Manchester United “cannot run away” from the bad results they have suffered at the start of the season, but insists the system he plays is not to blame.\nUnited are 14th after six games with two wins and a draw to their name, and head into Saturday’s match at home to Sunderland with Amorim again under pressure after a 3-1 loss to Brentford last weekend.\n“You cannot run away from from the results,” he said at his pre-match press conference on Friday.\n“We have to look at the games we lost. Did we lose against Arsenal because of the system? When you look at the game against (Manchester) City, was the first thing that you think when the game starts, (about) the system? I think you don’t think about the system in that moment.”\nWhat’s on today\nThis weekend's Premier League action 🍿\nWhich match are you most excited for? 👀 pic.twitter.com/0gZMGrBsaq\n— Premier League (@premierleague) October 3, 2025\nLiverpool will look to put back-to-back defeats behind them in the evening Premier League kick-off at Chelsea, which follows three other top-flight fixtures.\nFirst up is Leeds against Tottenham at Elland Road (12.30pm) before Arsenal face London rivals West Ham at the Emirates Stadium and Manchester United take on Sunderland at Old Trafford (both 3pm).\nThere are three William Hill Premiership matches, including Hearts versus Hibernian in the Edinburgh derby (5.45pm), and a full programme of English Football League fixtures.\nIn the Women’s Super League, Manchester City’s home game against Arsenal (12.00pm) is the top flight’s only game.",
