  "body_text": "EA FC 24 gameplay preview: HyperMotion V puts title in a different league to FIFA 23\nWe were able to get some hands-on time with EA FC 24 months before the official release, and this is what we thought of the new game\nLosing the FIFA name was always going to be a tough obstacle for EA Sports to overcome, but if the current state of EA FC 24 is anything to go by, the future is bright for the new football game franchise.\nDespite the new name, football fans all have their reasons to be pessimistic about EA FC 24, considering the last few FIFA titles released by EA Sports. The game lacked substantial changes year-on-year, albeit with a few fancy presentation features added on top, so with EA having the ability to almost start the franchise from scratch, expectations are sky high.\nWould the first instalment of the EA Sports FC era be the same game with a new name, or is this really the start of something new, something to get fans excited and let loose from the shackles after an underwhelming few years? Well, after getting hands-on with EA FC 24 at the launch event in Amsterdam last week, the new game has everything that made FIFA 23 a success, whilst new features and updates both on and off the pitch offer a new appeal that's been missing for years.\nEA FC 24 gameplay preview – No FIFA, no problem\nEvery year, EA gets fans excited in the build-up to a FIFA release with a bunch of trailers and deep dives, though bar FIFA 23, which saw the introduction of AcceleRATE that really gave the game a new feel, each game felt a bit flat gameplay wise, with each title always feeling quite similar to the previous one.\nBut in the Alpha version of EA FC 24 I played during EA's official reveal event in Amsterdam, the gameplay did feel different, and personally, it felt more reflective of a real game of football. The gameplay itself felt quite slow in comparison to FIFA 23, although the caveat to this is that this is me comparing EA FC 24 to the current state of Ultimate Team, where most players you face possess a pace rating of over 90.\nWhat impressed me the most about EA FC 24 is the new HyperMotion V technology. For the first time, EA has used new technology using volumetric data from more than 180 professional men’s and women’s football matches to influence player movements in-game.\nHyperMotion V has helped introduce a bunch of new features into the game such as precision passing, effort dribble touch and what I felt was the biggest change, responsive shooting. All of the new additions were noticeable in the gameplay and all played a big part in the improved feel, but the increased responsiveness when I aimed for goal was the pick of the bunch.\nMy players would now shoot when I wanted them to shoot, and with HyperMotion V, a whole new variety of shooting techniques were on show. AcceleRATE 2.0 saw four new running styles introduced on top of lengthy, controlled and explosive, whilst AI Mimic allows AI to replicate how players move in EA FC 24 to give players realistic run styles.\nThe prime example in which I noticed HyperMotion V in full effect was with EA FC 24 cover star, Erling Haaland. Manchester City were one of just four teams available for us to use, and Haaland feels extremely overpowered.\nIt almost feels as if the new features introduced have been made with Haaland in mind. The striker was quicker, stronger and more deadly in front of goal than anyone else, a bit how former cover star Kylian Mbappe felt in FIFA 23. Coincidence?\nEA has received a bit of a flack over the last few years regarding its gameplay, but what they did get right was the presentation and cut-scene animations, and that remains in EA FC 24. We used the Champions League mode to play the new game, and the new cut-scenes in the in-game menus from pitch side to the tunnel really added a new level of authenticity to the game.\nAnother factor I loved was the animation that played out after a foul was made. If a free-kick was won in a dangerous position, you would see the game from the referee's perspective, with players crowding the official with appeals as he sprays the markings on the floor.\nA feature that received, well, a mixed reception, was new on-screen graphics that popped onto the screen when the ball went out of play. Possession graphics covering the pitch whilst a throw-in was being taken or 3D shot graphics when a goal kick was being taken. I personally liked it, but many others didn't.\nOne new factor which I felt was pretty anonymous in the game however was PlayStyles. Replacing the traits system from FIFA 23, PlayStyles are supposedly meant to hand players certain advantages over others, though I never noticed any of these PlayStyles making much of a difference in game.\nUltimate Team always does well for EA. With the introduction of women's players, UT Evolutions and a host of other new features, Ultimate Team will be the biggest game mode once again. It's the gameplay that has often let EA down in the past, which in my opinion, should be the number one priority for the game. But, if this early version of EA FC 24 is close for the final game that is released, EA has got the fundamentals spot on, and I'm excited to see what the future holds for EA FC 24.\nThe EA FC 24 release date has officially been confirmed for September 29, 2023 with the standard edition of the game to be released worldwide on all platforms on this date. EA FC 24 will be released on platforms including PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC and Nintendo Switch, with pre-orders available now.",
