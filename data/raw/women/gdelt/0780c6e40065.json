With the federal government’s fiscal year ending on September 30, the next few months are sure to be a busy time for federal procurement and, inevitably, bid protests. Protests related to federal government procurements have strict and short deadlines that carry harsh consequences if they are not met. The following discussion examines the protest deadlines for the various venues in which government contractors often find themselves. In this alert, we summarize the deadlines for small business procurement programs associated with the Small Business Administration (SBA) and for merit-based protests related to the issuance of a government solicitation or the award of a contract.\nFor procurements that are set aside under SBA’s programs, there are three key determinations that are often the subject of protests: size of the awardee, status of the awardee, and the North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code that is applied to a particular solicitation. Protests based on the handling of the procurement process itself, such as challenging the terms of the solicitation or the award of a contract, can be made by filing a protest with the relevant procuring agency, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. However, each venue carries its own procedural rules and jurisdictional restrictions. When considering a protest in any forum, it is important to review the regulations directly to evaluate the pertinent deadlines applicable to each type of procurement. Protest deadlines expire very quickly. An aggrieved contractor will lose its right to challenge various aspects of a procurement if it does not act fast. The following tables provide a quick reference identifying which regulations that contractors should review to evaluate their protest deadlines in different forums.\nSize Protests Under SBA’s Regulations:\nNAICS Code Appeals Under SBA’s Regulations:\nStatus Protests Under SBA’s Regulations:\nMerit-based Protests: Agency-level, GAO, and COFC\nSome jurisdictional limitations apply to certain bid protest forums for merit-based protests. For example, with very limited exceptions, task order protests may only be brought at the GAO, and only if they exceed the required jurisdictional minimums. FAR 16.505(a). However, outside of the jurisdictional requirements that are not fully addressed in this alert, contractors can file a protest challenging the merits of the procurement process in three separate forums: (1) the procurement agency; (2) the GAO; or (3) the Court of Federal Claims. It is important to understand the jurisdictional deadlines pertaining to each of these forums so that contractors can act fast in the event of an adverse award decision.\nThe protest regulations for the various protest forums are specific and they vary depending on the type of procurement and kind of protest. For government contractors, being aware of the tight deadlines associated with the type of protest and understanding the nuances of them is critical. Whenever a contractor is considering any type of procurement protest, it should quickly speak with a trusted bid protest lawyer to evaluate the relevant deadlines in light of that contractor’s particular concern.\n1 While contracting officers, the VA, and the SBA may also file size or status protests in various instances, this alert focuses only on the deadlines for non-government parties (i.e., government contractors).\n2 An offeror excluded from the competitive range or otherwise excluded from the competition before the award under a FAR Part 15 procurement must request a debriefing within 3 days after notice of exclusion to obtain a required pre-award debriefing. FAR 15.505(a)(1). If it is not timely requested, the debriefing is not required. If the debrief is timely requested, then the protest must be filed within 10 days after when the debriefing was held. 4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(2).",
