In pursuit of these objectives, a new product has been created: TOP BARÇA, aimed at meeting the needs of users who want a different kind of experience to the on-demand content on Barça One.\nTOP BARÇA is a continuous broadcasting channel that offers a selection of the best content generated by the club, covering both regular sports activities (delayed broadcasts of men's and women's football, Barça Atlètic, youth teams, highlights of other sports, etc.) as well as exclusive series and documentaries produced by Barça Studios. It also features the full historical archive of matches, goals and highlights of our teams and legends.\nBesides offering the club’s content to even more fans around the world, TOP BARÇA is also generating a new revenue stream through advertising: the FAST (Free Ad-Supported Streaming Television) model of free, open-access channels that include commercial breaks.\nTOP BARÇA is set to be one of the leading FAST channels in its category. It will be available worldwide in both English and Spanish on major audiovisual platforms such as Rakuten TV (already available in Europe and soon in Japan), Orange TV (initially only in Spain), VIX (in the United States), VIDAA (worldwide), DAZN (Europe), and others that will be progressively added.\nWith this new product, Barça Studios and FC Barcelona are once again at the forefront of current broadcasting trends, further complementing the content that is already available to Barça fans around the world. The BARÇA ONE streaming platform, also free and available in Catalan, Spanish, and English, was launched in April.\n- label.aria.viber Viber\n- label.aria.whatsapp WhatsApp\n- label.aria.twitter Twitter\n- label.aria.facebook Facebook\n- label.aria.messenger Messenger\n- label.aria.link label.aria.tick Copy link",
