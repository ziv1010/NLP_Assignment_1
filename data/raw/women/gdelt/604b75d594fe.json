It's all happening on the occasion of the Women's Champions League Final between Barça and Olympique Lyon at San Mamés in Bilbao. This Saturday 25 May, Barça One will be broadcasting ten hours of non-stop live content that can all be streamed for free.\nIt all starts at 10am with Barça Live in three languages (English, Spanish and Catalan) presented by Llorenç Tarrés, Pol Martínez and Robert van Eeckhout. We'll have all the latest news about the big day and live connections with the Fan Meeting Point in Bilbao, where there will be all kinds of concerts, games and competitions going on. Mireia German will be presenting in Catalan and Spanish and we'll have Pablo Woolls to do the English.\nFrom 5pm, we'll be switching to our live match coverage from Roger Mateu and Begoña Villarrubia in Catalan, Marc Brau and Àngels Prieto in Spanish, and Robert van Eeckhout and his team in English. The programme will continue through the game and into the post-match comments and analysis.\nThus, Barça One will be delivering every part of the Bilbao experience to fans around the world for free on such a special day for the team and for women's football in general, with Barça hoping to win the coveted Champions League for the third time.\nAnd there's more because Barça One can add to the women's football marathon with its “Historic season for the women's team” tab containing some of the biggest highlights from another marvellous year for Jonatan Giráldez and his players, including the spectacular comeback against Chelsea in the semifinals and the stunning victory in the final of the Copa de la Reina.\n- label.aria.viber Viber\n- label.aria.whatsapp WhatsApp\n- label.aria.twitter Twitter\n- label.aria.facebook Facebook\n- label.aria.messenger Messenger\n- label.aria.link label.aria.tick Copy link",
