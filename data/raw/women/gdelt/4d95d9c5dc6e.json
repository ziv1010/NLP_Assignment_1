With their vast platforms and captive audience, they have the power to shine a light on important issues far beyond the field and spark public debate – and one woman who has long been leading the charge is women's football legend and BBC pundit, Alex Scott.\nThe 36-year-old sports commentator and ex-player made headlines last year during the Qatar World Cup, when she defied the controversial FA decision to ban players from wearing the OneLove armband in support of the LGBTQ+ community.\n'Wearing the armband wasn't something I planned or even thought out,' she explains to ELLE UK. 'I woke up to headlines about it being banned, and I just felt so sad. We were supposed to be there selling football and being inclusive and letting everyone feel like a part of this huge moment. But that day, we weren't.'\nRead Next\nIn a split second before going on-screen, she grabbed the armband – and the rest is history. 'I'm still processing the enormity of it and how it affected so many people in different ways,' says Scott. 'I was in Qatar for the month, so all I received was the hate side of it – that I'd disrespected people and their culture and religion. But really, it was about love. I was sad for everyone that felt discriminated against and didn't feel they could be there – and that was me showing my solidarity. It was a way of saying \"I'm so sorry, but I'm with you.\"'\nDespite the backlash she received – so 'heavy' that she 'disappeared for a while' afterward the World Cup ended – Scott is adamant that she would do it all over again. 'Do I regret it? Oh my gosh, no way,' she says. 'Keep throwing the hate at me, keep throwing everything at me, because it's about the bigger picture. It's about trying to take forward steps instead of ten steps back.'\nThis defiant, brave and forward-facing approach has in many ways been the key to Scott's success – both on and off the pitch. Following a successful career as a professional player for the likes of Arsenal and the England squad, Scott broke into the male-dominated world of punditry through sheer determination and hard work.\n'I decided if I was going to try and be a pundit, I was going to do it properly,' she explains. 'I did a media degree and tonnes of work placements at different organisations. People weren't expecting or wanting to see a female in that field, but I was just like \"why not?\" Women go to football matches, we love sport, we sit on our sofas and watch it... It shouldn't be a big deal.'\nUnsurprisingly, stereotyping and misconceptions were rife from the outset – but she didn't let them get to her. 'It actually makes me laugh when I think of the headlines back then, people saying I was so well researched and so well prepped and they were surprised,' she recalls. 'I was like: \"Wait, is that not my job to be?\" I'm being given the opportunity to do a job, so I am obviously going to do it to the best ability that I can. And that means work and research and lots of preparation to sit in that chair.'\nThe same goes for often being the only woman in the room. 'I had to stop even thinking about that,' explains Scott. 'It's not helpful to concentrate on those kinds of things, because then your mind gets consumed. Instead, I focused on: \"I'm here, so I'm going to show my personality.\" I want the people at home to really see me for who I am and connect with me, and often that's through what I'm wearing.'\nRefusing to 'stay in her lane', Scott makes sure to have fun with her fashion both on- and off-screen, from going all-out with glamorous looks for award ceremonies, to partnering with brands that make up her 'polished and put-together' day-to-day aesthetic. Most recently, she became an ambassador for Pandora – a 'natural fit', she says, both because of its support of last year's World Cup, and the fact that she has worn their jewellery since she was a child.\n'I feel like we're finally at a stage now where people don't put as many stereotypes on women in sport,' she says. 'You can love dressing up, you can love jewellery, and it's about having the confidence to express that, show off your style and celebrate your uniqueness.'\nThe increased representation of women in sport in recent years has helped make this possible. Scott becoming the BBC's first female pundit to cover a World Cup in 2018 was a watershed moment. 'There being a female pundit doesn't make headlines anymore,' she says, happily. 'There are so many who have come through the door since then, and that makes me so proud. All those haters can keep on hating, because look at the change that we've made within the space of just a few years.'\nAnd it can only get better from here. Earlier this month on International Women's Day, the UK government announced a £600 million package to create equal sporting access for girls at school, after the women's England squad penned an open letter demanding change. 'An announcement that will change women's football in England forever,' read a Tweet by the Lionesses immediately afterwards.\n'It's opening the door, giving more opportunities to women in those male-dominated spaces, and normalising it across society,' says Scott of the news. 'Now, the young boys in the playground are seeing girls playing football at school, watching the Lionesses on TV, wearing their shirts, and seeing it as normal. That's how it should be. It's about changing the thought process of the next generation, so there is no prejudice towards any women across any industry.'\nBut how to keep up the momentum? 'By watching, supporting and celebrating all your sports stars,' says Scott. 'Having them on the front of magazines, being the faces of big brands... Celebrating them in every avenue, not just in their sport – and really showing off their personality. That's how we'll really get lasting change.'\nClementina Jackson is Acting Site Fashion Editor at ELLE UK, working across news and features, trends, e-commerce and SEO.
