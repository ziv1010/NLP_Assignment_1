  "body_text": "Ian Wright has criticised Emma Hayes after the Chelsea Women’s manager accused Jonas Eidevall of ‘male aggression’, claiming she could have ‘finished’ the Arsenal boss had her altercation with her counterpart not been filmed.\nThe Football Association have confirmed that Hayes will face no action for pushing Eidevall, but the incident has divided fans and proved a hot topic of conversation in the wake of Sunday’s bad-tempered League Cup final.\nHayes’ coming together with Eidevall followed an earlier clash on the touchline involving Chelsea midfielder Erin Cuthbert, who had been tossed a spare ball to ensure a quick throw-in was taken.\nDiscussing the moment after Arsenal’s 1-0 victory, Eidevall revealed that the heated situation arose as a result of the two teams disagreeing over whether or not there should be a multi-ball system in place when the ball went out of play at Molineux.\nHayes felt Eidevall should have been shown a red card – rather than a just a yellow – for his behaviour and the Chelsea manager escalated the situation further by accusing the Swede of ‘male aggression’ at an extraordinary post-match press conference.\n‘I’ve been in women’s football a long time and I don’t think we should tolerate male aggression like we did today,’ Hayes said.\n‘He [Eidevall] received a yellow card but perhaps should have been more.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

I’ve never been booked in 12 years of my career.’\nEidevall went on to claim that Hayes’ comments were ‘very irresponsible’, arguing that her version of events was some way from the truth.\n‘I think that’s a very irresponsible way of labelling the behaviour that I have,’ the Arsenal boss said.\n‘I don’t feel comfortable with that label, I don’t think it’s the truth to do that, so I think it’s very irresponsible to do that.’\nLegendary ex-Arsenal striker Wright gave his thoughts on the incident on the latest episode of The Overlap, seemingly agreeing with Eidevall’s suggestion that Hayes’ choice of words was irresponsible.\n‘When you talk about the clips, when you look at the clips, to use those words, “male aggression”, and I don’t know what was said with Erin Cuthbert when she went over to him, if he’s said anything, I don’t know,’ Wright said.\n‘But she totally negated everything by pushing him afterwards.\n‘Listen, she doesn’t lose. She’s not used to losing. Last season she lost, now twice in that competition against Arsenal, but I thought that she would have gone in the dressing room afterwards and thought: “You know something, I was out of order”.\n‘She went in and doubled down on it and came out and said that. It’s really tough.\n‘I can totally understand how she’s feeling, she’s not used to losing. But to come out like that, that could have finished him. If we don’t see those clips and we can see that, that can finish him.’\nBack in November, Manchester City manager Gareth Taylor accused Eidevall of ‘bullying’ a fourth official during the side’s 2-1 defeat to Arsenal in the Women’s Super League.\nAnd while Wright concedes Eidevall does get ‘very animated’ on the touchline, he believes the 41-year-old has ‘calmed down’ this season.\n‘When you look at Jonas sometimes, he’s very animated. I feel like he’s calmed down,’ Wright added.\n‘He has calmed down and it’s very hard because Gareth Taylor, again, using those words “bullying”, using those words in the women’s game.\n‘She’s [Hayes] saying “male aggression”, it’s not good. It’s not good.’\nThe Overlap's discussion over Hayes and Eidevall's clash in full\nJill Scott\n‘Last minute of the game, they said, “Shall we use a multi-ball system or a one-ball system, and at the end, with one minute to go, she’s asking for a ball to be thrown on.\nSo Jonas is like, “You said…”, and it’s the last minute of the game and then her and Cuthbert said something to him.\nBut he is very loud on the side of pitch. I think he’s calmed down this season, but I just don’t think she should have used the [term] “male” because she was like: “It’s male aggression”.’\nRoy Keane\n‘What about the shoving?’\nRio Ferdinand\n‘She shoved him, though?’\nJill Scott\n‘Yeah, but she was seeing him on the side of the pitch. But I didn’t think she had to say “male”.’\nRoy Keane\n‘What if he shoved her?’\nJill Scott\n‘Exactly.’\nIan Wright\n‘When you talk about the clips, when you look at the clips, to use those words, “male aggression”, and I don’t know what was said with Erin Cuthbert when she went over to him, if he’s said anything, I don’t know.\n‘But she totally negated everything by pushing him afterwards.\n‘Listen, she doesn’t lose. She’s not used to losing.

It’s really tough.\n‘I can totally understand how she’s feeling, she’s not used to losing. But to come out like that, that could have finished him.\n‘If we don’t see those clips and we can see that, that can finish him.\n‘[The clips] told a story but we don’t know what was said. This is the one thing, [Maybe] we find out that he said something aggressive.’\nJill Scott\n‘I don’t know if it’s been building up because of how he is on the side. I know a few managers have done post-match interviews…\n‘But I don’t know, I’ve never been used to having a manager that is like that. I always liked when I played and our manager would sit there, calm, because he was like, “Our work’s been done, just go out and…”.’\nIan Wright\n‘When you look at Jonas sometimes, he’s very animated. I feel like he’s calmed down.\n‘He has calmed down and it’s very hard because Gareth Taylor, again, using those words “bullying”, using those words in the women’s game.\n‘She’s saying “male aggression”, it’s not good. It’s not good.’\nFormer England international Sue Smith refused to condemn Hayes’ shove on Eidevall and played down the significance of the clash between the two ‘very passionate’ managers with a fraught history.\n‘I think you’ve got two very emotional managers. They both clearly want to win every football match they plan in,’ Smith said while reflecting on the incident on Sky Sports.\n‘I obviously watched the game, I see the incident with Jonas Eidevall and one team wanted the multi-ball system, one didn’t.\n‘And then that changed when Chelsea went a goal down, you can see the frustrations there.\nMore Trending\n‘He’s a goal up, he wants to win the game. I didn’t really see any of that, I then saw the altercation when they both came together and Emma Hayes was clearly frustrated, gave him a bit of a shove as she walked past.\n‘So I just think it’s two managers who are very passionate about their football team, Emma Hayes really disappointed they didn’t win the game and it just boiled over.\n‘There has been tension between the two ever since Jonas came into the league, he did the knee slide, Emma didn’t really like that.\n‘So there has been a few little things between the two of them and tensions just boiled over, I didn’t really see that much.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Three reasons why Cole Palmer is the Premier League signing of the season\nMORE: Enzo Fernandez explains Chelsea struggles and makes prediction for next season\nMORE: ‘Fantastic!’ – Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta reacts to Chelsea’s epic win over Manchester United",
