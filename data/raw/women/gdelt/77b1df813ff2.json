  "body_text": "2023 FIFA Women's World Cup: How to watch, schedule and betting favorites\nThe United States will be playing for an unprecedented three-peat at the Women's World Cup this summer. It won't be easy for the world's No. 1 team.\nCo-hosted by Australia and New Zealand, the quadrennial tournament for international soccer's most coveted trophy kicks off July 20 and features an expanded field of 32 teams, up from 24. There are 64 total matches during the tournament.\nThat means more competition for the two-time defending World Cup champion U.S., which won the 2015 event in Canada and the 2019 tournament in France. The Americans have won four titles overall, most of any nation.\nHow to watch the FIFA Women's World Cup\nFox holds the English-language media rights in the United States for the Women's World Cup. Telemundo holds the Spanish-language rights.\nFox will broadcast a record 29 matches over the air on its main network and the rest of the games will be aired on FS1. All matches will be streamed on the Fox app.\nWhat's the schedule?\nThe 32 teams are divided into eight groups of four teams each. Each team plays a three-game, round-robin group stage, running from July 20 to Aug. 3.\nThe top finishers advance to the round of 16 from Aug. 5-8. The quarterfinals are set for Aug. 11-12 and the two semifinal matches will be played Aug. 15-16. A third-place game is set for Aug. 19 in Brisbane ahead of the final.\nThe final will air at 6 a.m. ET on Aug. 20 in the United States.\nThe broadcast schedule is complicated by the time difference. The United States is playing in Group E with Vietnam, the Netherlands and Portugal. The opening match is against Vietnam on July 22 in Auckland, which, because of the time difference, will air in the U.S. on July 21 at 9 p.m. ET.\nA rematch of the 2019 final against the Netherlands is set for July 27 in Wellington, airing at 9 p.m. ET on July 26 in the U.S. The last group game against Portugal is set for Aug. 1, airing at 3 a.m. ET that same day.\nFILE - Spain's players celebrate with the trophy after winning the FIFA U-17 womens football World Cup 2022 final match against Colombia at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai on Oct. 30, 2022.

England is next at +340, followed by Spain at +650.\nThere's also a big group of teams the oddsmakers say have little chance of lifting the trophy, including Jamaica, Vietnam, Argentina, Zambia, Nigeria, Costa Rica, Morocco, Philippines, South Africa, Haiti and Panama. All are at +43,000 — but if one of those happens to emerge as a Cinderella winner, the payoff would be sweet.",
