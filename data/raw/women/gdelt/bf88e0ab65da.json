  "body_text": "When the Women’s Super League season begins on Friday evening, be on the lookout for those who have not made the headlines — yet.\nConsidering this summer has seen four WSL managerial changes, two world-record signings, and a major tournament, the up-and-coming players have not been at the top of the agenda.\nAdvertisement\nBut ignore them at your peril. The Athletic have picked out 10 youngsters who are new to the WSL or set to play a significant part for the first time, who you should look out for this season.\nIman Beney — Manchester City\nBeney’s mother always imagined her daughter as a dancer. A skier. A professional at capoeira (an Afro-Brazilian martial art). The Switzerland forward’s instincts were rhythm and poise. Those early visions of her daughter’s future changed when Brazil legend Marta descended upon the Swiss village of Chatel-Saint-Denis in 2012 for Brazil’s Matchworld Women’s Cup match against Colombia. Six-year-old Beney, and her mum, were entranced.\nHoning her craft and strength with boys until age 15, Beney joined Young Boys Frauen, scoring 14 goals in 40 appearances as she won the Swiss Super League title before joining Manchester City this summer.\nIf you caught a glimpse of the 19-year-old at this summer’s Euros, her dance instincts were evident as she swivelled through defences, helping Switzerland to a historic quarter-final. Hailed for her ability on the ball, her intelligence off it and her hunger to develop, Beney could be box office.\nNelly Las — Leicester City\n“Be the next Lucy Bronze.” Nelly Las didn’t stutter when she declared her dream to The Athletic last year. Her coaches agree that her dream is more than achievable.\nLas has been training for it since 11 years old, deadlifting at a local gym and begging her mum Paula to drive her to multiple training sessions a day, including with Alessia Russo’s shooting coach Scott Chickelday.\nThe sacrifices are evident six years on. Las, who can play as a right-winger or right-back, made her senior debut last October, followed by her WSL debut, first senior goal, call-ups to England’s under-19s and her first professional contract in July.\nLas’ first-team appearances last season came via drip-fed minutes. With Leicester’s limited summer recruitment and the departure of head coach Amandine Miquel, she’s expected to be given more responsibility this season.\nAdvertisement\nRion Ishikawa — Everton\n“The tiny one” was how Rion Ishikawa was christened by her two older sisters. The same moniker has not manifested on the grass at Everton’s training ground. There, the 22-year-old is lovingly referred to as the team’s “Japanese wall”.\nSince moving to Liverpool in July from Japanese club Urawa Red Diamonds, Ishikawa, who was part of the Japan team that won the 2025 SheBelieves Cup, has established herself as Everton’s greatest physical presence on the pitch, according to sources speaking anonymously to protect relationships.\nHer aerial prowess, ability to mark strikers and timing in challenges are second to none, foundations learned during her time in the JFA Academy Fukushima between 12 and 18 years old.\nThere is little worry she will adapt quickly to the WSL’s physicality as much as her new surroundings. Known for her singing and gregariousness, Ishikawa is as much a presence on the pitch as off it.\nTeyah Goldie —London City Lionesses\nGoldie knows the sensation of fighting against fate. In a little over a year, the former Arsenal centre-back suffered two anterior cruciate ligaments: first her right knee in March 2022, one month after being named Player of the Month while on loan with Watford; then her left knee at the start of summer 2023.\nThe setbacks were cruel for a player who made her senior debut for Arsenal aged 16 and was tipped to be one of England’s next best defenders. The promise of Goldie playing regularly in the WSL this season with newly-promoted London City Lionesses is emotional and gripping.\nGoldie, 21, is a classy, intelligent centre-back, as was evident during her successful loan spell with London City last season. But the club’s decision to pursue a permanent deal — she had interest elsewhere — was as much down to her ability on the pitch as her mentality in the face of adversity off it.\nAdvertisement\nMaya Hijikata — Aston Villa\nThey call it the “Hijikata Dance” in Japan, the calling card of Hijikata when she finds the back of the net and wheels away in celebration. The 21-year-old Japan striker points at her elbow (Hiji in Japanese), then shoulders (kata), as fans cheer.\nThe Hijikata Dance is coming to a WSL game near you after she joined Villa from Japanese club Nippon TV Tokyo Verdy Beleza. “One for the future” was Villa’s director of football Marisa Ewers’ description, but this does a disservice to what she can offer now.\nHijikata is considered one of the country’s most fluid and mature young strikers, having honed her trade as the only girl in an all-boys team until the age of 12. While the WSL represents a steep step up, the expectation is Hijikata will gradually share the No 9 responsibility alongside 33-year-old Rachel Daly.\nVeerle Buurman — Chelsea\nThere is nowhere to hide as a centre-back. The dual demands of physicality and footballing intelligence make it one of the most challenging positions to step into as a youngster — so it is a good job that Buurman has been perfectly prepared.\nChelsea signed Buurman last summer but immediately loaned her back to PSV, a move that paid dividends for her development. The 19-year-old was a constant in PSV’s back line as they secured the best defensive record in the Eredivisie and started two of the Netherlands’ three matches at the Euros.\nBuurman is not the dancing, sparkling, flair player who typically pops up on these lists — she is a composed, confident, and physical defender who will provide valuable rotation and options as Sonia Bompastor’s side compete on multiple fronts. For Chelsea, that is even more valuable.\nKirsty Maclean — Liverpool\nWhen Maclean graduated from the academy into the senior set-up at Rangers, there was a problem: to distinguish between her and forward Kirsty Howat, one of them needed a nickname. Midfielder Maclean became ‘Ini’ to her team-mates, after Spanish great Iniesta.\nAdvertisement\nThe 20-year-old is from the Scottish town of Barrhead rather than Fuentealbilla, but watching Maclean play it’s clear where the nickname comes from.\nThe Scottish international is an excellent creator, deeper-lying but forward-thinking, and comfortable in tight spaces with fantastic passing vision.\nMaclean arrives at Liverpool with more than 100 appearances for Rangers and a growing CV with Scotland, having risen through the youth teams to make her senior debut in 2023.\nWe are delighted to announce the signing of Scotland international midfielder @KirstyMaclean_ ✍️\n— Liverpool FC Women (@LiverpoolFCW) July 14, 2025\nCreating rather than goalscoring will be her role, but Maclean has a fantastic long-range finish in her locker that fans — but mostly opponents — will want to watch out for.\nKatie Reid — Arsenal\nIn the clips from Arsenal’s Champions League celebrations, it would have been easy to miss England captain Leah Williamson hoisting the trophy with a young, grinning redhead.\nReid had not played a minute of the final against Barcelona, but Williamson dragging her to the front was laden with narrative. The 18-year-old is emerging as a partner, even a future replacement, for her at the heart of defence.\nQuietly, Reid and Arsenal have been plotting her path to the first team. The academy graduate spent time on loan at Watford in 2023-24 but the club keeping her in north London last term indicated her increasing importance in their plans.\nHer 13 senior appearances last term, including first starts in the Champions League and WSL, repaid their faith. She enters the new season with a new squad number, a Champions League winners’ medal, and the chance to break through in earnest.\nCarla Camacho — Brighton & Hove Albion\nWhen Camacho sees a shot, her eyes light up. The Spaniard does not care if she is facing a tight angle or a defender on her back. Nor whether it is a header, a volley, or a tap-in. She just wants to score.\nAdvertisement\nThe forward, 20, has joined Brighton from Real Madrid, where she made her senior debut in 2023. Her journey has not been straightforward: after superb youth tournament wins with Spain — she was a joint winner of the Golden Boot in the 2022 under-17 Euros — her progress was halted by an anterior cruciate ligament tear in 2023. Last season, she struggled for minutes and goals in Madrid.\nShe will be determined not to become a tale of promise unfulfilled. Brighton head coach Dario Vidosic admits she will need time to settle — but her poacher’s eye for goal and smart box movement are fertile ground for a lethal striker to grow.\nJade Rose — Manchester City\nKeeping Sam Kerr quiet for a whole game gave a glimpse of Jade Rose’s quality.\nIn 2022, Rose, then 19 years old, stole the show in Canada’s 2-1 victory over Australia, keeping Kerr quiet and strutting her playmaking abilities by creating Adriana Leon’s winner.\nIt was the performance of a centre-back ready to force her way onto the biggest stage, and by joining Manchester City from Harvard University she has done just that.\nRose has always sought to push herself to the next level. At 12, she joined Toronto Power FC’s boys academy to improve the pace of her game; at 16, at her first national team camps, she was spending downtime at the hotel reviewing footage with coaching staff.\nStepping into a City team looking to return to the WSL top three will come with pressure — but she is no stranger to that.\n(Top photo: Buurman and Beney have signed for Chelsea and City; Getty Images)",
