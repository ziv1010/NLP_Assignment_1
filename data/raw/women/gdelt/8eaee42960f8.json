  "body_text": "Aitana Bonmatí conquered soccer once more in 2024. For a consecutive year, Barcelona midfielder won the Ballon d'Or as the best female player on Earth. Her skill and influence throughout the season were celebrated to the fullest on a night in Paris. Just in case anyone had any doubt about Aitana's skill, the numbers and the accolades speak for themselves: 49 games, 23 goals, and 17 assists to go along with the raft of major titles that underlined her impact on women's soccer.\nFollow Playing for 90 on X (Twitter).\nIf there is one thing that defines Aitana, it's because she's consistent. For an athlete to be named the best player in the world two years running is not a trivial matter, and Aitana makes it crystal clear that her success goes way beyond technique. In her words of acceptance, \"You can't win this alone.\" With much humility, Aitana showed her gratitude to a united team, putting importance on those supporting her both on and off the field.\nGolden Season at Barcelona\nAitana Bonmatí was the heartbeat of Barca's women during the 2023/24 season after the Catalan team had dominated Europe once more. The Catalan team had won the Champions League, Spanish League, Copa del Rey, and Spanish Super Cup-a thing a few clubs manage to pull off in a year. Aitana was the brains further up the pitch and the energy at midfield, one who usually dictated the pace of the game, always with pinpoint passes, finding the space and finishing with precision when needed.\nIt goes without saying: 49 games and an astonishing average close to one goal every two games by a midfielder. To top it all off, her 17 assists were fuel for an unstoppable Barcelona. Her decision-making and game sense made them a true machine for winning matches. It is not an exaggeration to say that without Aitana, Barça would not have achieved as much in such a short period of time.\nAitana's Influence on the Spanish National Team\nBut Aitana's brilliance is not contained in Barcelona. Performances with the Spanish national team are worth clapping, too. She made a decisive impact in the Nations League as she chalked seven goals and an assist in 16 matches. Aitana proved that she is not just a club player, but she carries her impact over to the national team as she helped Spain reach some amazing results.\nIn the Olympic Games in Paris, that Spanish squad finished fourth after losing to Brazil in the semifinals. But Aitana didn't fail and stayed firm with her decision. For many, she had been the most outstanding figure in Spain's campaign, taking them to levels of competitiveness that received accolades all over the world.\nBallon d'Or and New Era in Women's Soccer\nThis victory of Aitana for the Ballon d'Or 2024 has a meaning so much more than personal merit; it is yet another example of women's soccer, which day after day wins more and more space, consideration, and respect. Certainly, this is the sixth edition proposed by France Football, and to see a player like Aitana win the trophy for two years in a row reinforces the quality and commitment that exist around this sport.\nSince Ada Hegerberg of Norway won the first edition in 2018, followed by Megan Rapinoe and Alexia Putellas, the Ballon d'Or proved women's soccer is full of incredible players who all brought something different to the pitch. Classy in her game and dominant on the pitch, Aitana sets the seal on this tradition, raises the bar, and inspires new generations.",
