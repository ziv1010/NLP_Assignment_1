Sven Goran-Eriksson used no fewer than 22 players that night – but where are they all now?\nAhead of tonight's clash at Wembley, FourFourTwo takes a look...\nEngland vs Australia 2003's squads: How they all fared…\nFirst half\nDavid James\nEngland's number one at Euro 2004 and the 2010 World Cup, David James won 53 caps for the Three Lions.\nHe retired in 2014 and was declared bankrupt the same year, before going into punditry and appearing on Strictly Come Dancing, among other ventures.\nGary Neville\nA mainstay of the England team during the late 90s and early 00s, Gary Neville represented his country at five major tournaments.\nThese days, he's one of the main pundits and co-commentators on Sky Sports, and is never shy of giving his opinion – more often than not on his old club, Manchester United – as well as co-owning Salford City.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nRio Ferdinand\nLike Neville, Rio Ferdinand has gone from Manchester United and England defensive star to prominent football media figure.\nFerdinand earned 81 caps during a 14-year international career, scoring at the 2002 World Cup.\nSol Campbell\nSol Campbell formed a robust centre-back partnership with Ferdinand under Sven-Goran Eriksson, also finding the net at the 2002 World Cup.\nAfter hanging up his boots, he managed Macclesfield Town and Southend United, as well as setting up the Kids Goes Live charity to allow underprivileged children to attend major sporting events.\nAshley Cole\nArguably his nation's greatest left-back of all-time, Ashley Cole belongs to a select group of players to have won more than 100 England caps.\nThe Arsenal and Chelsea legend later went into coaching, serving under England U21 boss Lee Carsley and Frank Lampard during his time as Everton manager.\nDavid Beckham\nEngland's inspirational captain from 2000 to 2006, David Beckham finished his international career with 115 caps – the second-most of any Three Lions outfield player.\nHe's been pretty busy in retirement, co-owning Inter Miami and Salford City – and his Netflix documentary series has just landed, too.\nFrank Lampard\nAnother member of England's 100+ cap club, Frank Lampard has had the most prominent managerial career of this Three Lions crop.\nThat's not to say he's been particularly successful in the dugout, though: he's been sacked by both Chelsea and, most recently, Everton.\nPaul Scholes\nWith Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard also on the scene at the same time, Paul Scholes didn't have the England career he perhaps should have.\nNow a regular pundit as well as co-owning Salford City with Neville, Beckham et al, the Manchester United icon had a brief spell in charge of Oldham Athletic in 2019.\nKieron Dyer\nKieron Dyer's start against Australia was one of 33 England caps for the former Newcastle and West Ham midfielder.\nAfter retiring, he took on several coaching roles with boyhood club Ipswich Town, eventually overseeing their U23 team.\nJames Beattie\nProlific in front of goal for Southampton in the early 00s, there was a time when it looked like James Beattie would go on to have a decent career – but he ultimately won just five caps, failing to score.\nSince hanging up his boots, he's held a number of coaching roles, most recently as an assistant at Wigan Athletic.\nMichael Owen\nOne of England's all-time leading scorers with 40 goals, Michael Owen found the net at four major tournaments.\nAnother to have gone into the punditry game since calling time on his playing career, the Liverpool legend appeared on The Masked Singer as a stack of doughnuts in 2022 (as you do...).\nSecond half\nPaul Robinson\nDavid James' half-time replacement between the sticks, the Australia friendly saw Paul Robinson make his England debut.\nThe ex-Leeds and Tottenham goalkeeper would go on to win 41 caps for the Three Lions, retiring from playing in 2017.\nDanny Mills\nDanny Mills only played for England 19 times – but five of those were at the 2002 World Cup, where he was ever present at right-back in the absence of the injured Gary Neville.\nThese days, the former Leeds and Manchester City defender is a regular on talkSPORT.\nWes Brown\nPerhaps unfortunate to have come through at the same time as elite centre-backs such as Ferdinand and Campbell, Wes Brown never represented England at a major tournament (although he did make Eriksson's 2002 World Cup squad).\nHe retired from football in 2018, ending his career with Indian Super League outfit Kerala Blasters.\nLedley King\nOne of the finest English defenders of the early 21st century, Ledley King defied a chronic knee issue to represent his country 21 times – and make over 300 appearances for Tottenham.\nHe is now a club ambassador at Spurs, where he briefly worked as a coach under Jose Mourinho.\nPaul Konchesky\nAnother debutant against Australia, Paul Konchesky went on to win only one further England cap.\nIn recent years, the former Charlton Athletic and Liverpool left-back has held coaching positions with West Ham's academy and women's team.\nOwen Hargreaves\nInjuries prevented England from getting as much as they ought to have done out of one of the most talent midfielders of his generation in Owen Hargreaves.\nThe former Manchester United, Manchester City and Bayern Munich earned 42 Three Lions caps – appearing at three major tournaments – and is now a pundit.\nDanny Murphy\nThe Australia friendly saw Danny Murphy earn the sixth of nine England caps, eight of which came in friendlies.\nNow a regular in the Match of the Day studio, the former Liverpool and Fulham midfielder retired from playing in 2013.\nJermaine Jenas\nAnother debutant against Australia, Jermaine Jenas earned 21 caps for England in all, scoring his only international goal in Fabio Capello's first match in charge – a friendly with Switzerland in 2008.\nNowadays, Jenas can be found presenting The One Show, as well as European football coverage on TNT Sports.\nDarius Vassell\nUnfortunately best remembered for having his penalty saved by a gloveless Ricardo in England's Euro 2004 quarter-final exit to Portugal, Darius Vassell carved out a solid Three Lions career overall.\nThat was the last of his 22 caps, in which he scored six goals; he retired from football in 2012.\nFrancis Jeffers\nFrancis Jeffers belongs to a niche category in the history of the England national team: one cap, one goal (a header from Jenas' cross).\nAn Arsenal player at the time, Jeffers turned out for 11 clubs in all, hanging up his boots in 2013; he's now coaching in Saudi Arabia.\nWayne Rooney\nIt was a night to forget for England, but the Australia friendly is where it all began for a certain Wayne Rooney.\nAfter 53 goals in 120 caps (the latter still a record for an outfield player), Manchester United's record scorer retired from international duty in 2018 – and from football altogether in 2021, going on to manage Derby County and D.C. United.\nThe streaker\nNo idea.\nRead more\nManchester United could make a big January move for a frustrated Bayern Munich star.\nMeanwhile, Mauricio Pochettino says Chelsea are already working on winter signings.\nTom Hancock started freelancing for FourFourTwo in April 2019 and has also written for the Premier League and Opta Analyst, among others. He supports Wycombe Wanderers and has a soft spot for Wealdstone. A self-confessed statto, he has been known to watch football with a spreadsheet (or several) open...",
