Another major international winter sports event held in China after the 2022 Winter Olympics, the eight-day AWG attracted more than 1,200 athletes from 34 countries and regions, showcasing China's continuous progress in winter sports.\nThis file photo taken on Feb. 7, 2025 shows the cauldron is lit during the opening ceremony of the 9th Asian Winter Games in Harbin, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.

In April, humanoid robots and human runners took to the same half-marathon course in Beijing. This was followed by China's first-ever multi-sport games for embodied intelligent robots in the eastern city of Wuxi, and the inaugural World Humanoid Robot Games in Beijing in August that featured 280 teams from 16 countries and regions.\nThis file photo taken on Aug. 15, 2025 shows humanoid robots combating during a kickboxing match at the 2025 World Humanoid Robot Games in Beijing, capital of China. (Xinhua/Ju Huanzong)\n-- The Su Super League, a grassroots football competition in east China's Jiangsu Province, captivated the nation, fueling a broader sports consumption boom. Its 85 matches attracted 2.43 million total spectators - an average of 28,600 per game - and its livestream drew two billion views. Along with premier events like the China Open and the WTT China Smash, it spurred significant growth across culture, tourism, and retail.\nTo harness this momentum, China issued guidelines in September to unlock the sports economy's full potential. The plan targets a domestic sports industry worth over seven trillion yuan (about 997.9 billion U.S. dollars) by 2030 by nurturing world-class sports companies and events.\nThis file photo taken on June 29, 2025 shows people watching the 2025 Jiangsu Football City League live match on a giant screen inside a shopping mall in Nantong, east China's Jiangsu Province.
