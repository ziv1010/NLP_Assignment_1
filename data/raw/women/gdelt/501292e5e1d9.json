  "body_text": "Cheng severs ties with Filipinas\nMANILA, Philippines — Businessman Jefferson Cheng, a key piece of the recent success of the Philippine women’s football team program, has stepped down as team manager of the Filipinas.\nCheng, the Filipinas’ chief backer and manager in their rise from minnows to a FIFA Women’s World Cup competitor, cited differences in priorities and goals with unnamed parties, presumably the current Philippine Football Federation leadership, as primary reason.\n“For several months, we tried our best to make things work, under new and very different circumstances. Unfortunately, the situation is not workable,” Cheng said in a statement yesterday.\n“Our priorities and goals do not align, and the PWNT (Filipinas) organization that we worked hard to develop in the past years is incompatible with current methods,” he added.\nUnder Cheng’s management, the Filipinas made history after history on the international stage.\nThe Pinay booters, boosted by the entry of topnotch recruits and regular high-level training camps and tournaments overseas, reached the semis of the 2022 AFC Women’s Asian Cup in India, which served as their ticket to the following year’s Women’s World Cup.\n“I want to thank all of you for the support and kindness that you have shown me. It is through you that our efforts have not gone unnoticed and I am grateful to have shared some of the best football experiences with all of you,” said Cheng.\n- Latest\n- Trending",
