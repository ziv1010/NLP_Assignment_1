And can I do it?\nI talked to lots of people about it and the conclusion I came to was that I wanted to and needed to do it.\nSomething that has always stood me in good stead in my career is the value I place on people and the importance of taking people on a journey with you.\nIt has always been crystal clear to me that business, like life, is all about people.\nNo matter what the business, the organisational structure or its geography, your people are your biggest asset – and I’d like to think that I’m good with people.\nSo, with blank whiteboards and an empty diary, I began learning about the business of running a football club and the people that were key to helping me with that.\nI was curious, inquisitive, I asked good questions, I asked daft questions, I drank lots of tea and coffee and quickly realised two things.\nFirstly, just how big this organisation is, not only with its Pride Park operation and functions but with a training ground with first team and Category 1 academy.\nThe second, and equally important realisation, was just how lucky we are to have so many talented and dedicated staff within the business across both sites. With that knowledge, I knew I would be OK.\nWhat stands out most to me is the commitment of those staff across the business.\nSo many people continued to go above and beyond despite the scars of administration still being visible.\nI made it a priority to be present, accessible, and honest – even when the message was difficult.\nI wanted to lead, support, nurture and empower and that became my everyday purpose.\nThere have been massive ups (retaining Championship status on the last day of last season being the biggest) along with hosting three huge games: The Women’s League Cup Final, England U21s vs Andorra and the Lionesses homecoming fixture against Australia.\nTo be a part of those games and bring international football back to Pride Park was amazing.\nAll of that though is offset by a year of operational challenge.\nSome may say that football is a sexy business, I’m not sure I would agree!\nWho knew that sewage pumps are both vital to a matchday operation and expensive to replace, or that keeping circa 30,000 people safe on matchday was so complex.\nI oversaw my first ever full pitch renovation, I knew nothing about stitch pitches or what an agronomist was, but I figured it out.\nWhile there have been some hiccups along the way, I take great pride in how I have contributed to solving problems, making progress and bringing people together.\nI worked with a professional coach/mentor back in 2023 and the biggest learning I took from those six months – and there was a lot – was the value I placed on my time.\nTime is our most valuable commodity, and we all know that we only have a finite amount, so in placing a greater value on my time, I was able to be more focused and productive at work and just as importantly, able to maximise the time I had at home.\nSo, while there were lots of things going on at work, it was important to make sure that I continued to focus on my life outside of football.\nWith busier schedules and greater responsibility, I naturally had less time at home, but I worked incredibly hard to be “present” whenever I was.\nI would hope that Sarah, my wife, and my two boys Jack and Noah would attest to this, and while the phone doesn’t get locked away and there are still calls and emails to take (when business critical) we have had a brilliant year making great memories and loving time together as a family.\nBefore I became COO and moved over, I had a lot of people say to me, whatever you do, don’t change, be yourself.\nI wasn’t quite sure what they meant at the time, but I think I figured it out.\nMy core values, beliefs and behaviours are embedded within me.\nI’m not caring and empathetic because I have worked in the charity sector for so long, they are characteristics that are part of my DNA.\nI love laughing and having a good time, I want to be surrounded by good people, I want to be successful and take just as much pride from others around me excelling.\nIt’s who I am and what I do, and a year into this new journey I can honestly say I haven’t changed one bit.\nMore importantly, I continue to try to be the best version of myself at work and at home and never ever forget the value of my time!\nMy first year as chief operating officer at Derby County has been demanding, absorbing, and challenging, but I have loved every minute.\nIt has tested my judgement, my resilience and my skills more than any role before it.\nDespite the challenges, it is a privilege to work for this great club, and I am blessed to be in the position that I am.\nI don’t know what the future holds, but what I do know is that I am going to be present and enjoy the journey!\nUp the Rams!\nWritten by: Ian Perry\nSponsors\nON AIR\nSEARCH\nCATEGORIES\nRECENT POSTS\n100 factory jobs as Italian giant invests in Erewash\nHuge hole fears at Assembly Rooms site as bizarre 40-minute talks held\nMobile coverage map shows most reliable network providers in Derbyshire\nMaking it Official: Ceremony marks new home for city Registration Services\nCat dads are the UK’s most eligible bachelors, Valentine expert claims\nOffice: 0115 888 0968\nStudio: 0115 930 3450\nErewash Sound, The Media Centre, 37 Vernon Street, Ilkeston, DE7 8PD\n© Copyright 2026 Erewash Sound CIC.
