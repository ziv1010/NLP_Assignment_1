(KOLN) - Nebraska Volleyball Coach Dani Busboom Kelly received a Big Red welcome Thursday during a celebration at the Bob Devaney Sports Center.\n“This has been a homecoming fit for a queen,” Busboom Kelly said, addressing a crowd of about 2,000 people at 2 p.m. on a weekday. “Nebraska always does it bigger and better.”\nBusboom Kelly, who played for the Huskers before launching her coaching career, expressed gratitude to many people, but she gave a special thanks to former coach John Cook.\nNebraska Athletic Director Troy Dannen presented Busboom Kelly, her husband, former Husker football player Lane Kelly, and their son, Boone, with jerseys. The family also received a onesie, as Busboom Kelly is expecting another boy.\nDannen noted the overwhelming support for the event, joking that while Adams, Nebraska, has a population of 604, there were 700 RSVPs for the celebration. “If you’re gonna pick a day to rob the bank in Adams, Nebraska, today is the day,” he joked.\nBusboom Kelly grew up in Cortland and attended Freeman Schools in Adams.\nDannen noted Busboom Kelly is the fourth female athlete alum to serve as a head coach at Nebraska, following Amy Williams (women’s basketball), Heather Brink (women’s gymnastics), and Rhonda Revelle (softball).\nWhen asked about her expectations for Nebraska Volleyball, DBK responded, “To be in the hunt, win the Big Ten, be in Final Fours, winning national championships. But leave here loving the sport of volleyball, dying to play pro or coach or give back, have this feeling that they’re not burnt out. Have an amazing experience and usually that leads to success.”\nClick here to subscribe to our 10/11 NOW daily digest and breaking news alerts delivered straight to your email inbox.\nCopyright 2025 KOLN.
