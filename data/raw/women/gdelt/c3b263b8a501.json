At this stage of the competition, the overarching takeaway is one of unpredictability; everyone can beat anyone.\nNew Zealand opened their campaign with a victory over Norway but then lost to the Philippines. A draw against Switzerland was not enough to see the Ferns through as Norway held off a squad mutiny long enough to rattle six unanswered goals past New Zealand's conquerors, the Philippines.\nFellow co-hosts Australia will be at the epicentre of Monday's action as Group B comes to a close after the conclusion of Spain and Japan's Group C. Here's everything you need to know about another mouth-watering set of fixtures.\nCosta Rica vs Zambia - Group C\n- Location: Hamilton, New Zealand\n- Stadium: Waikato Stadium\n- Date: Monday 31 July\n- Kick-off Time: 08:00 BST / 03:00 EST / 00:00 PST\n- Referee: Bouchra Karboubi (MAR)\nThere may be nothing at stake for two sides already eliminated after two defeats to Spain and Japan but the meeting between Costa Rica and Zambia is underpinned by an intriguing culture clash.\nCosta Rica famously don't have an army. The nation's all-time leading goalscorer Raquel 'Rocky' Rodriguez explained: \"We always say that the soccer field is like our battlefield, for lack of a better term.\" Zambia, by contrast, not only boast armed forces but have six players in the squad that play for the two most prominent military clubs in the country: Red Arrows and Green Buffaloes.\nHowever, this battle for pride may be shot shy as neither nation has scored during the tournament. In fact, the pair have combined to force Japan and Spain's goalkeepers into just four saves.\nHow to watch on TV\nJapan vs Spain - Group C\n- Location: Wellington, New Zealand\n- Stadium: Wellington Regional Stadium\n- Date: Monday 31 July\n- Kick-off Time: 08:00 BST / 03:00 EST / 00:00 PST\n- Referee: Katja Koroleva (USA)\nOnly five nations have won their first two matches this year and the duo of Japan and Spain are the only perfect pair that share the same group. Monday morning's encounter is a straight shootout to decide the order of the top two spots in Group C.\nSpain would finish above Japan in the event of a draw given their superior goal difference - both sides are yet to concede but La Roja have scored eight goals to Japan's seven.\nThe team that claims top spot will face Norway in the round of 16 while the runners-up meet Switzerland.\nHow to watch on TV\nREAD MORE ON THE WOMEN'S WORLD CUP IN AUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND\nCanada vs Australia - Group B\n- Location: Melbourne, Australia\n- Stadium: Melbourne Rectangular Stadium\n- Date: Monday 31 July\n- Kick-off Time: 11:00 BST / 06:00 EST / 03:00 PST\n- Referee: Stephanie Frappart (FRA)\nAfter the draw for Group B, it seemed to only be a question of which order Canada and Australia would fill the top two spots - yet, Nigeria have created the distinct possibility that either the Olympic champions or co-hosts miss out on the knockout rounds.\nCanada lie second in Group B, below Nigeria, on four points. Australia are one place and point further back. A draw would send Canada through regardless of any other results but Australia would need a favour from the Republic of Ireland if they don't pick up maximum points. Defeat is a killer blow for the Matildas.\nStar striker Sam Kerr has declared herself fit after missing Australia's first two matches with a calf injury. Yet, it remains to be seen how many minutes Kerr can play in a match which her teammate Ellie Carpenter described as 'do-or-die'.\nHow to watch on TV\nRepublic of Ireland vs Nigeria - Group B\n- Location: Brisbane, Australia\n- Stadium: Brisbane Stadium\n- Date: Monday 31 July\n- Kick-off Time: 11:00 BST / 06:00 EST / 03:00 PST\n- Referee: Katia Itzel Garcia (MEX)\nRepublic of Ireland manager Vera Pauw agreed with reporters that asked if she warranted more clarity over her future. With a contract that expires at the end of the tournament, Pauw certainly won't hurt her job prospects if she can guide her eliminated team to their first win at a Women's World Cup.\nNigeria are playing for much more than just pride. The Super Falcons stunned co-hosts Australia with a deserved 3-2 victory in their second game, taking them top of Group B on four points. Nigeria just need a draw to guarantee a spot in the round of 16 for the second World Cup on the spin.\nHow to watch on TV\nLISTEN NOW TO 90MIN FOOTBALL'S CLIMATE CONVERSATION PODCAST\nFormer Italy international Arianna Criscione, Dulwich Hamlet's Brittany Saylor and Football for Future founder Elliot Arthur-Worsop join Katie Cross to have football's climate conversation about the Women's World Cup and tournament football's carbon footprint.
