Many of them are saying: 'Sell us - because in four years you have clearly misunderstood what we are all about.'\"\nThat fury stems from the sacking of club legend Daniele de Rossi just four games into this season and a poor start to the campaign sees the club lie 12th in Serie A, just two points above the relegation zone.\nAccording to Forbes, external, chairman Dan Friedkin is worth £6.15bn but the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR) mean splashing the cash with a marquee signing will not be feasible, as Saudi-backed Newcastle United have found out.\nEverton's net debt rose to £330.6m in their latest accounts, and having fallen foul of financial rules which led to deductions totalling eight points last season, any spending will need to be invested wisely.\nUpon completion of the deal on Thursday, incoming Everton chairman Friedkin said in an open letter to supporters: \"Whilst we are new to the club, we fully understand the vital role Everton plays in local culture, history, and the lives of Evertonians here and around the world.\"\nThe new executive chairman Marc Watts added: \"As stewards of Everton, we look forward to showing our commitment to the club through actions, not words.\n\"Our long-term vision is to harness the passion of fans and great qualities of the club to realise Everton's full potential.\"\nDyche's future\nManager Sean Dyche was appointed in January 2023 following the sacking of Frank Lampard with the remit of maintaining the club's ever-present record in the Premier League.\nSurvival was pulled off by the skin of their teeth courtesy of Abdoulaye Doucoure's second-half winner against Bournemouth on the final day of that season, finishing one place and two points above the drop zone.\nThe 53-year-old ex-Burnley boss was rightly given plaudits for last season's achievements when the team were deducted eight points and he steered them to 15th place, a comfortable 14 points above the relegation zone after a strong finish.\nEverton may have been expected to push on this term but instead find themselves in another scrap to stay up, currently in 16th place, just three points above the bottom three, with fans growing tired of the style of football which is seen as being insipid and one-dimensional. Only bottom club Southampton have scored fewer than the Toffees' 14 Premier League goals.\nDyche is out of contract at the end of the season, so the Friedkin Group needs to decide whether it offers him new terms or appoints someone new.\nAt Roma, it has demonstrated it is not shy of making managerial changes.\nThe group is on its fourth manager in 2024 following the sackings of the popular Jose Mourinho and ex-captain De Rossi, with his replacement Ivan Juric lasting only 12 games before veteran Claudio Ranieri was called out of retirement.\nFriedkin Group completes Everton takeover\n- Published19 December 2024\nMoshiri's Everton years: 'Chaos, crisis, dysfunction, mutiny'\n- Published19 December 2024\nStrict spending constraints\nNew ownership could see an overhaul of the club next summer, with eight players out of contract, according to Transfermarkt., external\nThe future of Dominic Calvert-Lewin is the most significant one in question, with the striker yet to extend his contract, though club sources have told BBC Sport they remain hopeful of coming to an agreement.\nClub captain Seamus Coleman, Abdoulaye Doucoure, Idrissa Gueye and Ashley Young are other first-team players approaching the final few months of their deals.\nDirector of football Kevin Thelwell's contract expires in the summer too so it remains to be seen whether he is offered a new deal, while changes at boardroom level will include the appointment of a new chief executive.\nSince the start of the 2022-23 season, when Thelwell oversaw his first transfer window, Everton have implemented considerable cost-cutting measures to balance the books and are the only Premier League side during that period with a positive net spend of £80m.\nAt the other end of the scale, Sunday's opponents Chelsea have the biggest negative net spend of about £652m during that same timeframe.\nEverton signed a total of 21 players - with significant fees paid only for players aged 25 or under - and either sold or released 26 players, particularly those who were older and high-earning.\nThe largest transfer outlay was on Amadou Onana for £33m from Lille in 2022 and the Belgium midfielder went on to join Aston Villa in the summer for £50m.\nBecause of the PSR position, the strict spending constraints mean Everton have had to utilise the free transfer market and the four loan recruits in the summer were the most of any top-flight club.\nThe deals of Armando Broja, Jesper Lindstrom, Orel Mangala and Jack Harrison come to an end in June too, with no guarantees of those players being signed permanently.\nThe women's team\nLack of finances and an inability to help an ongoing injury crisis has also left Everton in a precarious position in the Women's Super League for the past two seasons.\nBut the takeover could spark a rebuild as manager Brian Sorensen hopes to add depth to his squad in the January transfer window.\nSources close to Everton say the club have a list of targets they hope to act upon with the takeover complete.\nAmong them is a potential £100,000 bid for Arsenal midfielder Kathrine Kuhl, who enjoyed a successful loan spell at Everton between January and May 2024.\nPlayers and staff are expected to meet with representatives from the Friedkin Group to discuss ambitions for the women's team.\nThere are already plans for both the men's and the women's first teams to visit the new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock in the new year.\nOccasional WSL matches are also expected to be held there once the move is complete, as has happened at Goodison Park.",
