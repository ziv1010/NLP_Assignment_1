  "body_text": "Semi-back from strep hell just in time for weekend two of the football season.\nFriday afternoon Cardinal news and notes\nTwenty-four hours until fans of all ages are back inside L&N Stadium.\nLove kids.\n—Spread Check: Louisville by 30.\n—Louisville has jumped from No. 31 to No. 18 in Bill Connelly’s S&P Rankings.\n—Attention U of L alums/fans looking to make the trip to Notre Dame: The U of L alumni association has two chapters — Chicago and Indianapolis — taking bus trips to the game. They are “traveling tailgates,” so there will be music, games, and giveaways during the ride. Fans are encouraged to bring their own drinks/snacks (only rule - no glass). The cost is $50 per seat.\nThe groups will be parking the buses at the LaSalle Council Boy Scout Office. The CEO there (John Cary) is a U of L alum and former Student Body President.\nMore information on both trips can be found at the links below.\nChicago: http://UofLAlumni.org/2024-ChicagoND\nIndianapolis: http://UofLAlumni.org/2024-IndyND\nFor the Indy trip, they do have some people driving in from Louisville or Cincinnati and taking the bus the rest of the way, so that’s an option.\nFor Chicago, if anyone is making a Chicago weekend of it, they are putting together a group outing to the Reds at Cubs game on Friday afternoon at 1:20pm: http://UofLAlumni.org/2024-ChicagoCubsgame\n—Despite some not so great results in week one, Jacksonville State is sticking with a two quarterback offense in week two.\n—The best part of Lamar Jackson feature in GQ (which is worth a full read) is him essentially referring to Miami as “an ass school.”\nStill, despite his one-of-one abilities, superstardom has never been a seamless fit for Jackson. Petrino says Jackson loathed certain aspects of the college recruiting process so much that he ultimately committed to Louisville without even visiting. By the way, if you’re questioning how a prospect like Jackson wound up in Kentucky, rather than his hometown University of Miami, the interest, Lamar felt, was not mutual. “Miami was my favorite school,” he says. But the team’s coach seemed uninterested in local talent, to Jackson’s unending frustration. “We’re the ones who made Miami what it was! When they started recruiting everyone else, they was sorry as hell. All the talent, all the real athletes, they were from here. Man, I’m not going there to be ass. That was my favorite school, but I don’t want to be at an ass school.”\nWhile the old guard still prefers quarterbacks to be more war general and less laid-back jokester, Jackson thrives with a loose, unburdened mindset. The more stone-faced and tense everyone around him is, the less he feels like himself. Perhaps his most dominant game in college was the time he put up five touchdowns to topple a Florida State team that had won 53 of its last 59 games. Before that game, Jackson tells me, he was prancing around the locker room wearing an offensive lineman’s cleats. Bullshitting, in his words, and not in the way quarterbacks usually do. The problem with so many modern athletes, he thinks, is simple. “Everybody’s so serious! When you’re too serious, I feel like you’re scared. I’m like, ‘Let’s get it. They can’t fuck with me.’”\n“I don’t wan to be at an ass school.”\nPut that on a shirt before Oct. 19.\n—The Athletic’s Chris Vannini has Louisville at No. 32 in his weekly ranking of all 134 FBS teams.\n—Cardinal Authority looks at the opening week of the NFL for former Cards in the league.\n—Future Cardinal Antonio Harris wants to be the latest Male High Bulldog to go on to star at U of L.

He did just that in week one.\nRedman brought in his lone catch of the day in the endzone for a 21-yard score near two Governors defenders. The Cardinals tight end spoke to the accuracy of the pass from quarterback Tyler Shough which put him in prime position to secure the touchdown grab.\n“It was something we practiced for weeks on end coming into fall camp,” Redman noted. “If you look at the catch, it was good. If you look at the pass, it was better. If the pass was two inches higher or lower, it wouldn’t have happened. Shout out to the whole team for that play.”\nRedman attributed his success to being able to face the Cardinals tough defense in practice. Louisville’s defensive effort held Austin Peay to 108 yards of total offense on Saturday.\n“I personally go against Ashton Gillotte, Ramon (Puryear), Adonijah (Green), and all of those defensive line guys in practice. It shows what the defense can do with seven sacks and 14 TFLs. When I saw that after the game, it surprised me a little, but I knew those guys were capable of that.
