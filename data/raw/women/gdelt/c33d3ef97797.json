I spent the whole game telling her how to do her job! Her response was, If you think its that easy, give it a go. Thats how it happened and 10 years later here I am.\nWho is Sam Allison?\nThe 42-year-old enjoyed a successful playing career before turning his attention to refereeing.\nHaving started his journey with Swindon Town, Allison moved on to Bristol City, AFC Bournemouth and Exeter City, even making a handful of appearances for England schoolboys and representing Great Britain.\nAllison had a dual career as a match official and a firefighter, before turning his attention to officiating on a full-time basis after the introduction of the Elite Referee Development Plan.\nFollowing his promotion in 2020, he became the third black referee to officiate in the EFL, following in the footsteps of Rennie and Trevor Parkes. He has taken charge of over 100 matches in the EFL.\nSpeaking in March, he said: I love football so much; its in my blood and its innate. Id do anything to be involved in the game. Unfortunately, I didnt reach the pinnacles as a football player but hopefully one day I can do it as a referee.\nSams first taste of Premier League action came in October 2022, when he was fourth official in the fixture between Brighton & Hove Albion and Chelsea.\nHe was promoted to officiate in the Championship for the 2023/24 season.\n( Press Release Image: https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/315489/315489-1.jpg )\nWebWireID315489\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.
