There were like three women on the flight.\n\"Even when we were doing the safety demo, they were starting to do small chants about football.\n\"We pulled the trolley out to do the service and as soon as the seatbelt signs went off, they all came to the back to try to go to the toilet. I was thinking 'this is going to be a nightmare'.\nREAD MORE: Every 100 yards of territory 'costs Russia lives of 2,000 men,' says NATOAs the flight wore on she became aware of chants, about her, beginning to rumble among the fans.\n\"I looked up and they were all looking at me. I was thinking 'why are they all looking at me while they're chanting?'.\n\"There was one older lady sat in the middle of the plane and she said, 'oh I bet you want to curl up into a ball, don't you?'.\"\nThen shockingly, the older lady got involved too, belting out a rendition of “we love you Chloe”.\nAs the rowdy crowd moved through its repertoire they sang: \"'she serves to the left, she serves to the right, Chloe makes the other flight attendant look like sh*te\".\n\"I just wanted to climb inside the rubbish bag,\" she said.\n“They all took their shoes off and I could hear them chanting 'shoes off if you love Chloe'.\n\"They were just having a good laugh, excited for the football and going on holiday.\"\nChants got louder as the flight went on – and the fans got more boozed up.\n\"When they were leaving, a few were even joking 'come in the toilet with us,'” she added.\n\"They were all trying to leave through the back and ask for my Instagram, I kept telling them I don't have it. They were saying 'I'll never forget you'.”\nBut despite some calling out the group, she says she didn’t mind.\n\"It made my day go faster, it was fun.”\n\"I've only worked there [at RyanAir] for three months, but when I spoke to everyone they said it's never been like that before apart from maybe in the summer when people are off to a party place like Ibiza.\n\"They were all harmless. A few made a few comments or tried to grab me as I was walking down but I just said 'don't do that'. Other than that they were all funny.\n\"Even when they said 'get your t*ts out' and 'Chloe's got a nice arse', it didn't really bother me at all.\n\"If there was any trouble we could have got the police on arrival, but we didn't need that.\"\nThe Daily Star has contacted RyanAir for comment.\nFor the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletter by clicking here.\nREAD NEXT:",
