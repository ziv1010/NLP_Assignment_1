Partnership Objectives\nWhat are the main objectives of the EU-CAF partnership and its importance for development in Africa?\nThe partnership between the EU and CAF is based on a shared passion: culture, sport, and in particular football. It allows us to speak directly to people across Africa about the concrete opportunities that the EU–Africa partnership brings into their daily lives.\nAfrica is the youngest continent in the world. Millions of young people are finishing school and looking for their first real chance to gain skills, find a job, and build a future at home. Our objective is to help ensure that these opportunities exist.\nFootball reaches young people exactly where decisions about their future are being shaped, in schools, communities, and neighbourhoods. That is the purpose of this partnership: to use football as a platform to talk about education, skills, and real prospects.\nThis is what our Global Gateway strategy is about. We invest in infrastructure, energy, digital connectivity, schools, training programmes, and local businesses. We deliberately link these investments with skills development, education, and local value creation.\nIn Cameroon, for example, through our I’ve Got the Power campaign, we told the story of a young, talented footballer, Larissa. It showed something very concrete: when communities have electricity, young people can study longer, train better, and access work and opportunity. Infrastructure only matters if it changes lives.\n2. Contribution of the European Union\nWhat are the concrete contributions of the EU in this partnership, and which sectors benefit the most?\nOur contribution goes beyond the Africa Cup of Nations for men and women. The partnership focuses on where impact is strongest and most lasting, especially among young people.\nA central element is the CAF African Schools Championship. It reaches children directly through schools and combines football with education, life skills and safeguarding. Nearly one million girls and boys have already participated, and our shared objective is to expand the programme to up to 33,000 schools across Africa.\nThe Championship is designed to keep children in school and to link sport with learning. Prize money is reinvested locally in school infrastructure, such as renovating classrooms or building libraries.\nThe main sectors that benefit from the partnership are education, youth skills development and inclusion. University football and women’s football are particularly important.\n3. Global Gateway in Cameroon\nWhat ongoing projects are there in Cameroon as part of the Global Gateway initiative, and what impacts do they have on the local population?\nThrough Global Gateway, the Team Europe has mobilised over €120 billion in public and private investment across Africa since 2021. In Cameroon, this translates into concrete projects in energy, transport and connectivity.\nOne key project is the Nachtigal hydropower plant. With a capacity of 420 megawatts, it significantly increases access to reliable electricity while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. For people on the ground, this means better conditions for schools, health centres and businesses.\nTransport is another priority. Last year, we inaugurated the Logone Bridge in northern Cameroon. For local communities, it has already reduced travel times and improved access to markets, schools and health services, while making movement across the river safer.\nWe are also investing in other strategic transport links, including the bridge over the Ntem River and the rehabilitation of the Belabo–Ngaoundéré railway line.\nIn cities like Yaoundé and Douala, Global Gateway supports clean public transport and sustainable mobility plans.\n4. EU–Cameroon Cooperation\nWhat are the main areas of cooperation between the European Union and Cameroon today, and which domains are prioritised?\nOur cooperation is long term and focuses on political stability, economic opportunity and development that preserves natural resources. For the period 2021–2027, the European Union has allocated €244 million in grants to Cameroon, complemented by regional and multinational EU programmes.\nThe priority areas are clear: energy, transport infrastructure and support for the private sector. Particular attention is given to the three northern regions of Cameroon, where climate pressure, insecurity and economic vulnerability are highest.\n5. Opportunities for Youth and Entrepreneurs\nWhat opportunities does the EU–Cameroon partnership offer to young people and entrepreneurs, especially Cameroonian ones?\nThe EU–Cameroon partnership focuses on creating concrete opportunities for young people and entrepreneurs.\nWe support training, skills development, access to finance and job creation.\nA current example is the Women Entrepreneurship for Africa programme. Through an ongoing call for proposals, innovative women-led businesses in Cameroon are being selected, particularly in the environmental sector. The programme supports them through incubation, mentoring and business development.\n6. Stability and Security\nCan the EU–CAF partnership contribute to stability and security in Africa? If yes, how?\nYes, because stability and security are built on sustainable development.\nThrough football, we support education, inclusion and safe environments for young people. Programmes linked to schools, safeguarding and life skills help keep children in education and promote equal opportunities for girls and boys.\nThis strengthens social cohesion and reduces vulnerability, especially in communities facing economic pressure or instability.\n7. Flagship Projects\nWhich two flagship projects best illustrate the concrete impact of the partnership for you?\nIt would be those two projects that I mentioned previously: the Nachtigal hydropower plant and the Logone Bridge.\nThe first is the Nachtigal Hydropower Plant. With a capacity of 420 megawatts, it is transforming access to electricity in Cameroon. It is expected to provide nearly 30 percent of Cameroon’s electricity demand.\nThe second is the Logone Bridge, which we inaugurated last year in northern Cameroon. For local communities, its impact is immediate and very practical.\n8. Long-term Vision\nWhat is your vision for the EU–CAF partnership in the coming years, and how do you plan to address continental challenges?\nMy vision is very simple: to make this partnership useful and concrete for young people.\nThat is why the EU–CAF partnership matters so much. Football is already part of everyday life across Africa. It reaches young people in cities and villages, across borders and backgrounds.\nFor me, the objective is to link the partnership with the Confédération Africaine du Football even more closely with our wider partnership with Africa as a whole.\n9. Message to the Public\nWhat message would you like to convey to African citizens, entrepreneurs and institutions about the EU’s commitment to Africa?\nAs Commissioner for International Partnerships, I have visited Africa multiple times. And I see first-hand the talent, energy, resources and ambition that Africa has.\nThe key objective must be to translate these strengths into local value, jobs and new businesses. Our position is straightforward: development only works if it is built with Africans and for Africans.\nThe European Union’s engagement in Africa is based on one fundamental principle: nothing is done without African partners.\nAnd this is work we can only do together, as equal partners, shaping opportunities that last.",
