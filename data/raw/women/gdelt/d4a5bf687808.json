  "body_text": "The Portland Thorns struggled mightily in a 3-1 loss at the Orlando Pride last week. Now wrapping up a two-game trip, the Thorns aim to get back on track with a match at the struggling Chicago Red Stars.\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive has Three Points to watch for Portland (5-2-4, 19 points) vs. Chicago (3-7-1, 10 points):\n1. THE INJURY BUG\nPortland will be without Becky Sauerbrunn for the near future as she experienced a setback with her foot injury and will miss the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup with the U.S. women’s national team. Sauerbrunn returned for a stint against OL Reign on June 3, but she is back on the injury report.\nWhile Thorns coach Mike Norris framed the injury as a “day by day thing” hours before the news broke, it appears to be more serious as a source confirmed to The Oregonian/OregonLive that they saw Sauerbrunn in a walking boot and on crutches last week. In the near term, Emily Menges — set to make her 150th NWSL appearance on Sunday — will fill in next to Kelli Hubly along the Thorns’ back line.\n2. IN DEEP TROUBLE\nChicago has won just two matches in the regular season since April 15, both one-goal victories over fellow cellar-dwellers Angel City and Orlando. The Red Stars have four shutout losses in that stretch, including 4-0 to the Thorns when they visited Portland on May 21.\nPortland just needs to play its typical brand of relentless, attacking soccer on Sunday, and a similar result should play out.\n3. SMITH WANTS MORE\nAfter a seven-match goalless streak, Sophia Smith has scored a goal in two consecutive for the Thorns. That has her at six goals on the season, tied for second in the NWSL with Ashley Hatch and Lynn Williams, trailing only North Carolina forward Kerolin with seven.\nNot only does Smith want to pile up more goals to maintain strong form heading into the World Cup for the U.S., but she also has a chance to climb atop that Golden Boot race ahead of her departure. She has two games left (including Sunday) with the Thorns before she heads to Australia and New Zealand with the USWNT, and if she can leave leading the NWSL in both goals and assists (her five is tops in the league heading into this weekend), she will put herself in a strong position to repeat as MVP.\nPortland vs. Chicago kicks off at 3 p.m. PT on Sunday, with a live broadcast on Fox 12 Plus and streaming on Paramount+.\n-- Ryan Clarke, rclarke@oregonian.com, Twitter: @RyanTClarke",
