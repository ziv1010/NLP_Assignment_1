We are incredibly excited for this partnership with the Netherlands and aim to provide one of the best base camp experiences in the world.”\nOranje will be making its 12th FIFA World Cup appearance this summer. The team is currently ranked No. 7 in the FIFA Men's World Rankings.\n“In addition, we considered other sporting requirements that are important for high‑quality training and accommodation: the quality of the pitches and facilities, location and travel distances,\" Koeman said in a press release. \"I visited the site myself, and for the region where we will play our group matches, Kansas City is the best option. Its location is also favorable. All of this contributes to being able to fully focus on football.”\n“For every major tournament, we aim to support the team in every possible way, including with the base camp,” said KNVB Director of Professional Football Marianne van Leeuwen. “That requires a careful process in which we assessed multiple locations based on sporting, logistical and operational criteria. The choice of Kansas City as our base camp fits that aim: a professionally organized environment that enables the team to prepare for the matches in the best possible way. It is an added bonus that we will also play our final group match in Kansas City, giving us the opportunity to conclude the group stage there together with our Oranje fans.”\nInformation on fan opportunities and the Netherlands' training schedule in Riverside will be released in the coming weeks.",
