After Serbia led 1-0, Jannik Sinner saved three consecutive Novak Djokovic match points that would have sent Serbia to the final.\nWith today’s victory, Italy have become the 11th nation to win multiple Davis Cup titles, and the first nation to do so since Croatia won their second title in 2018.\nBoth Italy’s men’s and women’s teams reached the final of the World Cup of Tennis, with Tathiana Garbin’s team falling just short to Canada in the Billie Jean King Cup by Gainbridge final in Seville on 12 November.\nThis is the second consecutive year that a nation has had both their men’s and women’s teams fighting in the final to become world champions, after Australia’s men’s and women’s teams reached the final of the World Cup of Tennis in 2022.\nFilippo Volandri said: “All the guys here and the guys that are not here right now gave us a lot of things. That’s why we really won this trophy. I always say we had a lot of emergencies, but being close, playing as a family, we overcome these kind of things, and yeah, we did it.”\nJannik Sinner said: “This is something different, something really special, because you don’t play for yourself but you play for the whole team. I think every one of us, we were really excited to be part of this. I gave 100%, all what I had, and I think the whole team, they all pushed each other, and this is the key why we are standing here with this trophy.”\nMatteo Arnaldi said: “I cannot explain what I’m feeling right now. I didn’t play my best tennis, but I think the result is what matters. At the end, I played well in the important moments, and I think it was important for us, for the team, to win my match, so I’m really happy, and I hope I helped the team.”\nBoth the 2023 Davis Cup Finals and Junior Finals took place in Andalucia as part of a wider agreement between the ITF and the Region of Andalucia, which also saw the Billie Jean King Cup by Gainbridge Finals take place in Seville (7-12 November).
