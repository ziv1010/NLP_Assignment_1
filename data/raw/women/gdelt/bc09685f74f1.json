The next ball was then drawn and its position determined by the coefficients of both teams drawn.\n- If the coefficient of the ball drawn was higher than the team provisionally allocated to the semi-final tie of Group 9, the second ball drawn was allocated to the final and the team that had been provisionally allocated was confirmed in the semi-final. If the coefficient of the ball drawn was lower than the team provisionally allocated to the semi-final, the second team drawn was allocated to the semi-final and the team that had been provisionally allocated was confirmed in the semi-final.\n- The same process applied to all three-team groups.\n- The 19 unseeded teams in Pot 2 were drawn into away team positions of the groups in numerical order, starting with Group 1 and completing the draw with Group 11, as follows:\n- The first ball drawn allocated to semi-final 1 in Group 1\n- The second ball drawn allocated to semi-final 2 in Group 1\n- The third ball drawn allocated to semi-final 1 in Group 2\n- The fourth ball drawn allocated to semi-final 2 in Group 2\n- The same process applied until all four-team groups are complete.\n- Continuing the draw with the three-team groups, the next ball drawn was allocated to the semi-final tie of Group 9, then the next ball to Group 10, and the last ball drawn finally allocated to the semi-final tie of Group 11.\n- In the league path, the teams were divided into two pots: seeded and unseeded.\n- The eight seeded teams in Pot 1 were drawn into home team positions of the semi-finals of the groups in numerical order, starting with Group 1 and completing the draw with Group 4, by the same method as the champions path.\n- The eight unseeded teams in Pot 2 were drawn into away team positions of the semi-finals of the groups in numerical order, starting with Group 1 and completing the draw with Group 4, by the same method as the champions path.\n- Based on the UEFA Executive Committee decisions valid at the time of the draw, clubs from the following nations could not be drawn into the same group: Kosovo / Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo / Serbia, Ukraine / Belarus.\n- The following draw condition applied: If a prohibited clash occured or could occur, the team drawn would be placed in the same position of the first available group in numerical order. Should prohibited clashes have been possible when drawing the last groups, the teams would be drawn and assigned to the groups.\nSeeding pots\nChampions path:\nPot 1: seeded\nSKN St. Pölten Frauen (AUT) coefficient 30.050\nGlasgow City FC (SCO) 29.100\nWFC BIIK-Shymkent (KAZ) 25.700\nSL Benfica (POR) 22.800\nFC Zürich (SUI) 22.250\nAFC Ajax (NED) 18.400\nKFF Vllaznia (ALB) 16.800\nŽFK Spartak Subotica (SRB) 16.800\nRSC Anderlecht (BEL) 14.400\nSFK 2000 Sarajevo (BIH) 13.800\nHB Køge (DEN) 12.150\nFC Vorskla (UKR) 12.000\nApollon Ladies FC (CYP) 11.800\nFC Gintra (LTU) 11.400\nValur (ISL) 10.200\nFerencvárosI TC (HUN) 9.900\nAS FC Universitatea Olimpia Cluj (ROU) 9.600\nNŠ Mura (SVN) 9.000\nFC Dinamo-BSUPC (BLR) 7.200\nFK Breznica (MNE) 7.200\nSK Brann (NOR) 7.100\nA.C.
