His death was ruled a suicide.\nPrevious document releases have shed light on Epstein's ties to top business executives such as Microsoft's Bill Gates, celebrities such as filmmaker Woody Allen, academics and politicians, including Trump and former president Bill Clinton.\nIn a draft email among the documents published on Friday, Epstein said Gates had engaged in extramarital affairs, a claim the Gates Foundation denied in a statement to The New York Times.\n\"These claims -- from a proven, disgruntled liar -- are absolutely absurd and completely false,\" it said.\nIn other emails, Epstein connected Steve Tisch, 76, producer of the movies \"Forrest Gump\" and \"Risky Business\" and the co-owner of the New York Giants football team, with multiple women.\nIn one exchange with Tisch, Epstein describes a woman as \"russian, and rarely tells the full truth, but fun.\"\n- Conspiracy theories -\nTrump's right-wing base has long been obsessed by the Epstein saga and conspiracy theories that the financier oversaw a sex trafficking ring for the world's elite.\nOnly one person -- Epstein's former girlfriend Maxwell -- has ever been charged in connection with his crimes, and Blanche appeared to play down expectations that the latest files would lead to further prosecutions.\nTrump and Clinton both figure prominently in the records published so far but neither has been accused of wrongdoing.\nA Republican-led House panel voted recently to launch contempt of Congress proceedings against Bill and Hillary Clinton over their refusal to testify before its probe into Epstein.\nTrump, who used to move in the same social circles as Epstein in Florida and New York, fought for months to prevent release of the vast trove of documents about the disgraced financier.\nBut a rebellion inside his Republican Party forced him to sign off on a law mandating release of all the documents.\nTrump has given varying accounts of why he eventually fell out with Epstein. He has criticized the file dumps, expressing concern that people who \"innocently met\" Epstein over the years risked having their reputations smeared.\nThe Epstein Files Transparency Act called for all of the documents held by the Justice Department to be published by December 19.\nBlanche said Friday's release \"marks the end of a very comprehensive document identification and review process to ensure transparency to the American people.\"\nHe blamed the delay on the need to painstakingly carry out redactions that protected the identities of Epstein's more than 1,000 alleged victims.",
