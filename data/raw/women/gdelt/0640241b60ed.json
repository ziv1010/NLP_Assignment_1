  "body_text": "Top-tier football clubs are a great avenue for brands seeking a high visual engagement of their marque or products, with sponsorships and collaborations securing that visibility. Carmakers are no exception, with the likes of Chevrolet, Opel and Jeep just a few of those who have gone that route.\nThe latest to do so is BYD, with the Chinese automaker having inked a multi-year partnership with Manchester City – which is currently placed second behind Arsenal in the Premier League – to become the club’s official automotive partner, covering both men’s and women’s first teams.\nBesides supplying BYD and Denza vehicles to the club for its use, BYD will also be responsible for vehicle charging and energy-storage batteries at City Football Academy. One of the company’s vehicles will also lead City’s official men’s first team bus into the stadium for Premier League and domestic-cup home fixtures.\nOn the branding front, the BYD logo will now feature on the training kit sleeve of the men’s first team and, from next season, the women’s first team. Additionally, BYD will have presence across the Etihad Stadium with LED advertising as well as the brand’s logo on the headrests of the dug-out area.\n“Manchester City stands for excellence, innovation and the courage to push beyond limits, values that are deeply rooted in BYD’s DNA. This partnership is about more than football or mobility; it is about inspiring people around the world through technology that excites, connects and drives a more sustainable future. When innovation meets passion, the impact is truly global,” said BYD executive VP Stella Li.\nThe new partnership is the latest step in BYD’s strategy to establish a presence in international football to enhance awareness of its brand, cars and other technology products. The automaker has a similar automotive partnership with Inter Milan in place, and it was also the official partner and official e-mobility partner for UEFA Euro 2024 as well as the 2025 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.\nLooking to sell your car?
