Fubo is a sports-centric streaming service that offers access to every March Madness game airing on network and cable TV, plus your local TV affiliates, hundreds of cable TV channels and 1,000 hours of cloud DVR storage. Another great reason to love Fubo is its lookback feature, which lets you watch sporting events up to 72 hours after they air live.\nStart watching NCAA basketball on Fubo and get access to network-aired NFL, NBA and MLB games by starting a three-day free trial of Fubo. You can begin watching immediately on your TV, phone, tablet or computer. Fubo starts at $80/month for the Pro tier, which includes 200 channels, but the streamer is currently offering the first month for $60.\nNote: Because Fubo doesn't carry TruTV, TBS or TNT, you won't be able to watch every game of the tournament with a FuboTV subscription. If you want one streaming platform to watch the entire tournament, you'll need a subscription to Hulu + Live TV.\nWhat you'll get with Fubo Pro Tier:\n- There are no contracts with Fubo -- you can cancel at any time.\n- The Pro tier includes 200 channels, so there's something for everyone to watch.\n- Fubo includes most of the channels you'll need to watch live college and pro sports, including CBS.\n- In addition to March Madness, Fubo offers NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, MLS and international soccer games.\n- All Fubo tiers come with 1,000 hours of cloud-based DVR recording.\n- Stream on your TV, phone and mobile devices.\nSave $40 on Sling TV: The most cost-effective way to stream March Madness 2024\nIf you don't have cable TV that includes TNT, TBS and ESPN, one of the most cost-effective ways to stream March Madness game this year is through a subscription to Sling TV. The streamer offers access to your local network affiliate's live feed (excluding CBS) and also includes the NFL Network and ESPN with its Orange tier plan. Also worth noting: Sling TV comes with 50 hours of cloud-based DVR recording space included, perfect for recording all the season's top NFL matchups.\nThe Orange tier is normally $40 per month, but right now Sling TV is offering a pair of offers for new subscribers. You can choose to take $10 off your first month of service on any tier or save $40 when you prepay $120 for four months of the Sling TV Orange tier.\nNote: Because some men's March Madness 2024 will be broadcast on CBS, you won't be able to watch all the men's March Madness 2024 games with a Sling TV subscription. If you're looking to stream the men's tournament, we suggest a subscription to one of the other platforms featured here.\nTop features of Sling TV Orange tier:\n- There are 32 channels to watch in total, including ESPN, TNT and TBS. (where available).\n- You get access to most local NFL games and nationally broadcast games next season at the lowest price.\n- All subscription tiers include 50 hours of cloud-based DVR storage.\nESPN+: How to watch the women's Final Four\nESPN+ is ESPN's subscription streaming platform. It offers exclusive live events, original studio shows and top-tier series that aren't accessible on the ESPN networks. To watch the women's Final Four, simply sign into the ESPN app. You'll watch college basketball at no extra charge. You can stream ESPN+ through the ESPN app on your favorite mobile device and ESPN.com. It's also available as an app through major smart TV streaming platforms and gaming consoles such as the PS5.\nKeep in mind there are some blackouts prohibiting you from watching certain in-market games with ESPN+, even if they're nationally televised. If you're looking to avoid those blackouts, we suggest subscribing to the Hulu + Live TV/ESPN+ bundle featured above.\nIt is important to note that ESPN+ does not include access to the ESPN network. It is a separate sports-centric service, with separate sports programming.\nAn ESPN+ subscription costs $10.99 per month, or save 15% when you pay annually ($110). ESPN+ is also currently offering a cost-saving bundle. Get ESPN+ (with ads), Disney+ (with ads) and Hulu (with ads) for $14.99 per month.\nWatch March Madness games live with a digital HDTV antenna\nYou can also watch today's game on TV with an affordable indoor antenna, which pulls in local over-the-air HDTV channels such as CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox, PBS, Univision and more. Here's the kicker: There's no monthly charge.\nFor anyone living in a partially blocked-off area (those near mountains or first-floor apartments), a digital TV antenna may not pick up a good signal -- or any signal at all. But for many homes, a digital TV antenna provides a seriously inexpensive way to watch March Madness without paying a cable company. Indoor TV antennas can also provide some much-needed TV backup if a storm knocks out your cable.\nThis amplified digital antenna with a 50-mile range can receive hundreds of HDTV channels, including ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, Fox and Univision and can filter out cellular and FM signals. It delivers a high-quality picture in 1080p HDTV and top-tier sound.\nWhen was Selection Sunday?\nThe day when the tournament's brackets and seeds are released is known as Selection Sunday.
