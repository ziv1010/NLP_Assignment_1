  "body_text": "They narrowly missed the top four in the past few seasons, and were one team last year's finalists would have been happy not to play.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nBut, if Friday night's performance is anything to go by, New Lambton appear assured of a finals finish this campaign.\nWhile their men's NPL side is languishingly in last position and in the relegation zone, New Lambton's women's team were boosted last week by the additions of Newcastle Jets trio Cassidy Davis, Lauren Allan and Libby Copus-Brown.\nThey joined the Jets' all-time leading scorer Tara Andrews, who has scored 19 goals in nine matches this season, and all four wreaked havoc in a 6-0 win over Adamstown in one of only two NPL games to go ahead over the weekend.\nAll six men's matches were postponed, leaving defending champions and premiers Broadmeadow now with five fixtures to catch up and a hectic schedule looming, while two women's matches were played on the synthetic surface at Lake Macquarie Regional Football Facility (LMRFF).\nAllan struck in the third minute on Friday night, assisted by Andrews. Copus-Brown made it 2-0 early in the second half. Allan assisted Caitlin Pickett's goal in the 59th minute. Andrews produced a spectacular left-footed strike from range in the 59th minute before combining with Davis for the latter to score in the 87th minute.\nDavis and Allan produced a slick combination to put Andrews on goal in the 90th minute. The twice-capped Matilda's shot was parried away by Rosebud keeper Olivia Sneddon but Copus-Brown finished the scraps with a back-post tap-in.\nThe win elevated fourth-placed New Lambton to 13 points, four behind third-placed Newcastle Olympic (17 points) and seven clear of midweek opponents Lake Macquarie (six points) at their season midpoint.\nLake Macquarie drew 2-2 with a new-look Broadmeadow at LMRFF on Saturday night. All four goals came from set pieces.\nMagic are last on four points as they eye sixth-placed Adamstown (five points) at Magic Park on Wednesday night.\nTori Johnson, who left Adamstown for Magic, scored off a corner to give Broadmeadow a 1-0 lead against Lakes in the 33rd minute.\nBrooke Summers equalised at the back post from a Lake Macquarie corner in the 51st minute then teammate Kimberly Trappett (70th minute) made it 2-1 in a near replica effort.\nUnited States signing Alexis Andrews, who was hampered by a knee injury in the early part of this season, then finished Johnson's long-range free kick in the 76th minute.\nMagic's mid-season signings - Japanese goalkeeper Ayano Kurosawa and American defender Brooke Bonner - made their first appearances on Saturday night.\nAndrews, Kurosawa and Bonner have all plied their trade in the US college system.\n\"It was good to get the girls in. I thought they were positions that we needed to strengthen,\" Magic NPLW coach Jason Konjarski said on Sunday.\n\"But, on that, our two young goalkeepers are 18 and 17, so I want them to learn off Ayano as much as possible because she is a very good goalkeeper.\n\"She's very agile, gets to the top corner. Seeing her at training, my assistant and I said, 'We've got something good here'.\n\"A strong goalkeeper wins you games, or keeps you in games, and I think she did last night.\n\"Brooke was good when she came on. She showed that she's very positive and a very strong defender and Goose [Alexis Andrews] did her job up front.\n\"Obviously, getting them back in now, we have to build that continuity within everyone.\"\nJets fringe player Milan Hammond made her first appearance for Lake Macquarie. The NPLW newcomers have also signed Jets forward Lara Gooch, who has been injured since the end of the A-League season.\nLake Macquarie play New Lambton at LMRFF on Wednesday night.\nMeanwhile, Magic men are scheduled to play Valentine at Croudace Bay on Tuesday night in one of their five catch-ups.",
