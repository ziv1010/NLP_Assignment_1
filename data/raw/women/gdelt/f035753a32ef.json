It’s the first deal of its kind in the Women’s Super League and marks another major step in challenging the stigma around menstruation in sport.\nWest Ham were one of the first clubs to switch from traditional white shorts to more period-friendly colours – and this new partnership builds on that mission to foster inclusion and body confidence among young athletes.\nModibodi's goal is to support the one in two girls who avoid sport during their period, giving them the confidence to stay in the game. As part of the collaboration, a limited-edition co-branded collection will launch later this season, blending West Ham’s iconic claret and blue with Modibodi’s pioneering leak-proof tech – all designed with player input.\nSpeaking on the partnership, Rebecca Rowley, West Ham’s Head of Partnerships, said: “From the initial conversations with Modibodi, we have been truly inspired by their commitment to creating positive change and removing restraints that have long held back women and girls in sport.”\nModibodi Executive Director, Kerry Cusack, commented: “Partnering with West Ham United women’s team allows us to stand together and say: your body is not a barrier. Together, we’re inspiring a future where every girl can play with confidence, courage and pride – every single day of the month.”\nThis partnership isn’t just symbolic – it’s practical, visible progress. By putting period-proof tech directly on the kit, West Ham and Modibodi are helping to dismantle the barriers that have long limited participation for women and girls in sport.",
