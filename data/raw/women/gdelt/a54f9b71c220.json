Around US$5.58 billion was spent in Europe alone where English clubs dominated, spending more than US$1.6 billion on transfer fees in the mid-year window.\nEngland’s spending has fallen by 15.5 per cent from US$2 billion last year, a more prudent approach after concerns over potential sanctions for failing to comply with the top-flight Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules (PSR).\nSpending by the top clubs in Saudi Arabia has also fallen by 50.74 per cent, from US$875 million last year to US$431 million this term. The Saudi League’s transfer registrations close in October.\nEngland also leads in the number of incoming transfers, with 526, followed by clubs from Brazil and Portugal.\nSpending on international transfer fees in women’s professional football was US$6.8 million during the mid-year window, more than double from last year.
