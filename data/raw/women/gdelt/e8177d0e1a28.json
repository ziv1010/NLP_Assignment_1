  "body_text": "'A problem at the Odd Corner': 20 years later, clerk Greg Peters' slaying remains a mystery\nFor two decades, Terry Buehl has wondered what would have happened if he had worked at the Odd Corner on the night before Thanksgiving in 2003.\nWould his friend and co-worker Greg Peters still be alive?\nBuehl normally worked with Peters on Wednesdays at the head shop near the University of Akron campus. But that night, the store manager asked Buehl to instead watch his dogs while he was on vacation.\nSo, Peters was by himself when a man wearing a bandana and carrying a gun came in the store about 8 p.m. — presumably to rob the store, which sold smoking supplies and memorabilia. However, the masked man took nothing before shooting the 50-year-old Peters and running away.\n“I should have been there,” said Buehl, who, unlike Peters, carried a gun when he worked. “That haunts me.”\nBuehl has called Akron detectives every Thanksgiving for the past 20 years to see if they have any new leads on who shot and killed his friend. The answer each time has been, “Not yet.”\nLike Buehl, Akron detectives haven’t forgotten about this case that struck many because it happened at an unlikely spot to an unlikely victim, whom many described as an “old hippie.” A reward poster for Peters’ case still hangs in the sixth-floor lobby of the detective bureau.\n“Sex, drugs and rock 'n roll, I think, was probably his main ambition in life,” detective Jim Pasheilich said of Peters. “Nobody's ever said anything bad about him.”\nWorking at the Odd Corner was Peters’ dream job\nPeters grew up in Akron but was born in Moundsville, West Virginia, while his parents were visiting relatives.\nHe graduated from Garfield High School in 1971 and studied graphic arts. He attended a technical trade school for printing and worked as a printer for Akron General Medical Center and the Summit County Department of Human Services.\nBut working at the Odd Corner, where he once shopped, was Peters' dream job. He worked there for seven years.\nThe Odd Corner was part of the retail district on East Exchange Street just off the UA campus. Some students frequented the store, but most customers were repeat customers, including some like Peters and Buehl who were aging hippies with long hair.\nMore in U.S.\nBesides smoking items, the Odd Corner sold trinkets, posters, figurines and other unique things that couldn’t be found elsewhere. Buehl said it was “like a coffee shop without the coffee.”\n“Everybody knew everybody in there by name,” Buehl said during a recent interview at this Akron home that is decorated with music posters like those sold at the Odd Corner. “It was, ‘Hey Terry. ‘Hey Greg.’ ‘Hey John.’”\nPeters lived near the store, so he could walk to work because he didn’t own a car, having given his away to someone who helped him with work on his house. He dressed in blue jeans, beads, moccasins and American Indian garb. He didn’t use credit cards and had only recently opened a checking account.\n“He was laid back and very happy-go-lucky,” John Kruger, the Odd Corner manager, told the Beacon Journal in December 2003. “He still preached peace and love and considered everyone his brother.”\nPeters didn’t have any children but loved them. He was a father figure to his friends’ children, cousins and one nephew. He enjoyed volunteering for events like the Special Olympics.\n“He was very easygoing, affectionate and enjoyed taking care of people,” Rene Keene, Peters’ sister, said in 2003. “He was a good listener and always had a big shoulder to cry on.”\nKeene, who lived in North Carolina, said she warned her brother to be careful at work because there was money and a cash register. He told her not to worry, especially because the store hadn’t had any major trouble during its 30 years in business.\n“I’ll be alright,” he told her. “Only good people come in here.”\nPeters is shot on the night before Thanksgiving\nThat wasn’t true on the night of Nov. 26, 2003, the eve of Thanksgiving.\nTwo teenage males were browsing in the Odd Corner when they saw a man walk into the back door of the store holding a gun. They ran out the front door.\nA man standing at a bus stop saw the teens run from the store, then heard a gunshot, according to an incident report.\nAnother man working at McDonald's told police he saw two males jump into a vehicle and leave after officers had arrived at the store, according to the report.\nPolice found Peters shot behind the counter. Paramedics rushed him to Akron City Hospital, where he was pronounced dead from a shot to the chest that exited through his side.\nNone of the witnesses were able to give the police a detailed description of the shooter besides that he wore a bandana or mask over his face.\nThe store had a video camera, but it wasn’t recording.\nBuehl said he’ll never forget getting the call about the shooting.\nHis wife answered the phone.\n“Oh my God!” she told him. “We’ve got a problem at the Odd Corner.”\nThe couple headed to the store from Kent and spoke with police.\n“As soon as they were done talking to us, we went to the hospital, but he was expired by then,” Buehl said of Peters.\nOdd Corner community rallies after shooting\nIn the days following the shooting, the Odd Corner community rallied to try to help find Peters’ killer.\nHarry Jackson, the store’s owner, offered a $20,000 reward.\nGreg Peters Reward Flyer by Dan Kadar\nBuehl printed 100 reward posters that he and others hung around town.\n“We had them all over Akron – campus, everywhere,” Buehl recalled. “We had quite a few people helping out to do that.”\nThe reward and the posters netted no leads.\nOdd Corner is moved, then later closes\nThe years passed and Buehl continued to check in with detectives at Thanksgiving to see if they’d made any progress.\nKeene also checked in with police a few times a year.\n“It’s devastating,” Keene told the Beacon Journal in 2013 on the 10-year anniversary of her brother’s slaying. “I’m mad. I’m sad. I’m pissed because I know somebody knows something.”\nMore: Ten years and no arrest in Odd Corner slaying\nKeene said 10 years with no answers was difficult.\n“I don’t know how I’ve had the strength to get through this,” she said. “It’s unexplainable — like a broken heart.”\nPasheilich, though, said detectives didn’t have much to go on, with no DNA evidence, fingerprints or video from the store or other nearby businesses.\nThe Odd Corner was torn down in 2008 to make room for the new UA football stadium. The store opened in another location on Exchange Street but has since closed.\nAsked what he thinks prompted the shooting, Pasheilich said, “Your guess is as good as mine.”\n“It could have been a robbery,” he said. “It could have been somebody’s mad at him for whatever reason.”\nBuehl, a semi-retired carpenter who continued working part-time at the Odd Corner a few years after Peters’ murder, has his own theory. He thinks Peters knew the man who shot him. He said Peters threw an ashtray at the shooter and the man then shot him.\n“Why would you throw an ashtray?” Buehl asked. “Somebody’s probably like, ‘Go on. Get outta here. You know. You’re kidding me.’”\nBuehl thinks the shooter likely was motivated by money, either the store’s or Peters’ own.\nMore: Who killed Javan and Markus Rogers? Akron brothers’ murders remain unsolved after 21 years\nLike with other cold cases, Pasheilich said, cracking this one would take someone who knew something coming forward.\n“I never say ‘never’ but it’s slim,” he said.\nPasheilich said it’s possible the shooter hasn’t survived the past 20 years.\n“I'd have to think that people that do that kind of stuff normally don’t have a long lifespan, whether it's from some violent ending for themselves, or some overdose or something else they’re into,” he said.\nRegardless, Buehl, 67, plans to keep making his annual Thanksgiving call to detectives. And, he hopes, one day he’ll get a different answer.\nStephanie Warsmith can be reached at swarsmith@thebeaconjournal.com or 330-996-3705.
