  "body_text": "The interim manager bounce continues for the Liverpool FC Women, as they were able to hold Arsenal Women to a 1-0 scoreline on Sunday’s Adobe Women’s FA Cup match. They sent the Gunners home and ensured a spot in the semi-finals, where they’ll face Chelsea Women.\nAmber Whiteley: “We Deserve To Be In The Hat For The Semi-Finals”\nWhiteley couldn’t hide her joy after Liverpool beat Arsenal in the FA Cup.\n“I don’t know if I’ve got the words to be honest. I’m just so proud of everyone today. I thought we were so well organised,” manager Amber Whiteley said following the match.\n“The work rate was absolutely incredible, and we limited their chances and put them under pressure in front of their own goal. I think we deserve to be in the hat for the semi-finals.”\nThe only goal of the match came from a second half own goal that had bounced off the post, hitting the Arsenal goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar, and then bouncing across the line. While it seemed like a work of luck, it’s a little bit of luck that the Reds are sure to enjoy after a hard past few months. Even Whiteley agrees that their hard work was rewarded in the end.\n“We wanted to make it difficult for them to play centrally. I thought the shape was brilliant from start to finish. We forced them to the outside and I thought we controlled the centre of the pitch really well and we got our reward from it,” Whiteley continued.\n“I didn’t realise it had gone in at first. I was a little bit delayed. But we spoke about that at half-time. We had good opportunities in front of goal. There were some good passages of play in the final third in the first half, but we needed to really believe it that we could get those opportunities and convert them. I’m so pleased for Sophie to get that goal.”\nWhiteley is no stranger to taking over a squad on short notice, after she also stepped in when Vicky Jepson left the club in 2021, and is just happy that her plans have been successful even with the shortened preparation time.\n“The girls have been absolutely brilliant. Everyone has - the staff and the players. The response has been brilliant,” Whiteley added.\n“We hope that the fans will come out on Friday at Anfield and get behind us again because we want to keep producing football like that. It’s what we can be proud of, and the fans can be proud of too.\n“I’m just so pleased for everyone today. They’ve put in so much work over the last couple of weeks. Obviously there’s been a big change. We’ve changed the system, and they’ve had to take on a lot of information in a short space of time. The way they have implemented it on the pitch last week and today against a top side - they’ve been outstanding.”\nThe Women next host Manchester United at Anfield on Friday March 14, before they face Chelsea in the semi-finals of the FA Cup.",
