  "body_text": "Curling is always one of the most popular sports at the Winter Olympics for UK viewers.\nThis is, in part, due to Great Britain’s success in the sport with six Olympic medals – three of them golds – collected over the years.\nThat tally includes the gold medal won by the women’s team four years ago in Beijing with skipper Eve Muirhead guiding the side to victory over Japan in the final.\nThere will be no gold medal for Bruce Mouat and Jennifer Dodds in the mixed doubles at the Milano Cortina Games, though, with the British pair competing in today’s bronze medal match having been beaten by Sweden in Monday’s semi-final.\nThose tuning in to see if Bruce and Dodds can beat hosts Italy to the bronze may well have several questions about how the sport works, from how many ends there are and why they sweep the ice, to what the hammer and power play rules do.\nNot entirely sure how curling works? Let us explain.\nHow many ends are there?\nMen’s and women’s matches are contested over ten ends.\nEach team has eight stones, with two stones thrown by each of the four team members.\nIn mixed doubles – where teams consist of just one male and female player – matches consist of eight ends.\nFive stones are thrown by each team, with one stone placed on the ice sheet by each side before the end begins.\nHow does the scoring work?\nA point is awarded to the team which has a stone closest to the centre of the house once all of the stones have been thrown.\nIf a team has two stones closest to the middle of the house they will score two points – and so on.\nThe team with the most points at the end of the match wins.\nWhat happens if the scores are level at the end?\nIf the scores are tied, an extra round is played to determine the winner.\nHow does the competition work?\nTen teams take part in each of the men’s, women’s and mixed doubles competitions.\nEach nation plays one another in the Round Robin stage, with only the top four teams progressing to the semi-finals.\nThe winners of the semi-finals will advance to the final, whilst the losers will head to the bronze medal match instead.\nWhat are the different roles?\nMen’s and women’s teams consist of four roles; Lead, Second, Third and Skip.\nThe Lead throws the first two stones and is usually responsible for sweeping their teammate’s stones.\nThe Second is tasked with throwing the third and fourth stones, as well as joining the Lead with sweeping the ice.\nThe Third throws the fifth and sixth stones and serves as the deputy.\nThe Skip is the team’s captain and the responsibility of throwing the final two stones lies with them.\nWhy do they sweep the ice?\nCurling players sweep the ice in order to control the speed and direction of the stones as they slide their way down to the house.\nThe brushing of the ice creates heat which produces a thin layer of water, which reduces friction and consequently allows the stone to travel further.\nFrantic brushing of the ice may be an indication the team are not happy with the force by which the stone was thrown.\nBrushing essentially gives curlers greater precision as to where their stones finally end up on the ice sheet.\nWhat is the power play rule?\nThe rule only applies in mixed doubles where one stone from each team is placed on the ice before the end begins.\nThe team with the power play can position their ‘in-house’ stone on the tee line.\nWhat is the hammer and how do you get to keep it?\nThe team with the hammer throws the final stone of each end.\nThis makes it easier for a team to score points as they are able to react to all of the stones which are in play before them.\nIf the team with the hammer scores at least a point at that end, the hammer is then passed to the opposing team, and so on.\nHowever, if a team with the hammer fails to score a point at their end, they retain the hammer for the next end.\nThis sometimes results in the team with the hammer turning down the option of scoring a single point when they have it, instead opting to retain the hammer for the next end in the hope of scoring more than one point.\nIf an extra end is required in men’s and women’s matches, the team that did not score points in the final round has the hammer.\nIf the final round is blanked, with no score for either team, then the hammer is retained by the same team.\nIn mixed doubles, if the end is blanked, the hammer is given to the other team.\nThe opponent’s guard stone is then placed to the side of the sheet in line with the ‘in-house’ stone, which opens up the scoring opportunities for the team with the power play.\nOnly the team with the hammer can use the power play and it cannot be used in extra ends. One power play is available to each team per match.\nWhat is a ‘time out’ and how many are each team allowed?\nEach team is allocated one 60-second ‘time out’ in a match.\nMore Trending\nThis pauses the game and allows the players to confer with each other over strategy.\nIn some instances, the coach will also come down to the playing area to discuss tactics with the players.\nIf the game goes to an extra end, each team is awarded an additional time out.\nMORE: Journalists to strike after commentator’s bizarre Winter Olympics opening ceremony gaffes\nMORE: There’s a problem with the Winter Olympics medals that means they keep breaking\nMORE: Lindsey Vonn airlifted off slopes after ‘high risk’ Winter Olympics gamble ends in horrific crash",
