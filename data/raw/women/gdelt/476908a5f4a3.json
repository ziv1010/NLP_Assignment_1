This isn’t very nice.”\nThere is no suggestion of wrongdoing on Lord Alli’s part, and The Telegraph has repeatedly contacted him for comment.\n05:46 PM BST\nThat’s all for today...\nThank you for joining our coverage of the second day of Labour’s annual party conference.\nWe will be back early tomorrow morning to bring you the latest from Liverpool.\n05:40 PM BST\nReform membership numbers grow by 5000 since party conference last week\nReform UK’s membership has grown by more than 5,000 since its own annual conference last week, the party has said.\nNigel Farage’s insurgent Right-of-centre outfit had 30,000 members at the start of the year, but this has now passed 85,000 following its gathering in Birmingham last weekend.\nIt is just shy of the 90,000 that Tory peer Lord Hannan has claimed the Conservatives have.\nZia Yusuf, the Reform chairman, said: “It’s clear Reform has all the momentum in British politics, coming off the back of our biggest and most successful conference yet we are once again showing that we are the real opposition.\n“Whilst Labour and the Tories are infighting and losing members, we are setting up national infrastructure at pace and building a campaign winning machine.\n“Reform UK are speaking up for the silent majority and they are joining our movement in droves.”\n05:31 PM BST\nTwo thirds say accepting football match and concert tickets is unacceptable - poll\nTwo thirds of people think it is unacceptable for MPs to accept tickets to concert and football matches as gifts from donors or companies, a new poll has revealed.\nMore than four in ten people said that the practice was “completely unacceptable”, and 20 per cent believed it was “somewhat unacceptable”, according to YouGov.\nIt comes after Rachel Reeves’ defending the acceptance of such gifts on BBC Radio 4 this morning, saying that she does not “begrudge ministers or indeed shadow ministers going to a football match or going to a pop concert.”\nMore than 60 per cent of people believed that wealthy people made donations to individual MPs and candidates because they are trying to “gain influence” over them, rather than just because they support the politician and the party.\n05:19 PM BST\nYour verdict: Readers’ reactions to Ed Miliband’s conference speech\n05:09 PM BST\nReeves hopes there will be no more industrial action ‘going forward’ in NHS\nThe Chancellor has said that she hopes there will “not be industrial action going forward” in the NHS, despite nurses voting to reject the Government’s pay offer.\nNurses voted to reject the 5.5 per cent pay award, the Royal College of Nursing announced just as Rachel Reeves delivered her speech at party conference.\nSpeaking at a business event this afternoon, Ms Reeves said: “We accepted the recommendations of the independent pay review bodies… that was important to bring to an end the industrial disputes.\n“It was the right decision, in the national interest, also to address recruitment and retention challenges.\n“You may have seen the nurses have voted today against the settlement… but my understanding is that is advisory and I very much hope there will not be industrial action going forward in our health service.”\n04:56 PM BST\nLord Alli ‘uneasy’ with media attention\nSerena Barker-Singh, the Sky journalist who tracked down Lord Alli, said: “He didn’t ask not to ask him about the donations, but he seemed uneasy by the media attention.”\n04:18 PM BST\n‘Cover up’ illegal sewage dumping and face jail\nWater bosses who “cover up” illegal sewage dumping will face jail, Steve Reed has said.\nHe told Labour’s conference: “We will ban the multimillion pound bonuses water bosses paid themselves for overseeing repeated illegal sewage dumping.\n“Bosses who cover up what’s going on will face personal criminal charges – including jail time.\n“And we’ll power up the regulator with more staff and give them the teeth they need to prosecute the polluters - and it will be paid for by the polluters themselves.”\n04:13 PM BST\nWinter fuel rebel ‘disappointed’ by vote delay\nRachael Maskell, a prominent Labour critic of the winter fuel raid, has said it is “disappointing” that a crunch vote on the policy at the party’s annual conference has been delayed, writes Amy Gibbons.\nA motion from trade unions opposing the cut – which will see 10 million pensioners lose their allowance of up to £300 – was expected to be debated on Monday afternoon.\nThis was considered the most likely slot for the vote because it would tie in with a plenary on “growth for higher living standards”.\nHowever, union sources claimed on Monday morning that it had been delayed until Wednesday – after speeches from Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, and Sir Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister.\nMs Maskell told The Telegraph the vote should have taken place on Monday as “business should follow order”, and described the delay as “disappointing”.\n04:02 PM BST\nLord Alli: Don’t ask me about donations row - it isn’t nice\nThe Labour peer at the centre of a sleaze row has told a journalist not to ask him about donations, saying “this isn’t nice”.\nLord Alli, Sir Keir Starmer’s biggest donor, has donated tens of thousands of pounds in clothing to the Prime Minister and Lady Starmer, his wife.\nHe was also granted a rare Downing Street security pass, prompting a “passes for glasses” row.\nLord Alli was spotted at Labour’s annual conference in Liverpool, which has been overshadowed by the revelation, by Sky journalist Serena Barker-Singh.\nWhen Ms Barker-Singh trie to ask him about the donations, he replied: “Please don’t. This isn’t very nice.”\nThere is no suggestion of wrongdoing on Lord Alli’s part, and The Telegraph has repeatedly contacted him for comment.\n03:54 PM BST\nEd Miliband channels his inner Nigel Farage\nEd Miliband adapted the Brexit campaign’s “take back control” slogan as he pledged to overhaul the British energy sector.\n“In words that will sound familiar, we can, we must, we will take back control of our energy policy.”\n03:53 PM BST\nMiliband: Labour has won the argument on climate policy\nEd Miliband said Labour had “won the argument” on green policies.\n“At the election there was an argument about our country’s future.\n“The Tories and their friends on the right said we should turn away from climate action and clean energy. We said no, and we won the argument.\n“And I’ll tell you why. Because the British people know our mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower is the way to put energy policy back in the serve of working people.\n“Social justice, economic justice, climate justice. That’s the mission of this Labour Government.”\n03:52 PM BST\nMiliband: British people have the right to benefit from our natural resources\nEd Miliband, the Energy Secretary, told Labour conference: “We believe the British people have the right to own and benefit from our natural resources and friends, we’re making it happen.\n“Great British Energy, demanded by this conference, at the heart of our manifesto, overwhelmingly backed by the public, now being delivered by your Labour government. That’s the difference a Labour government makes!\n“And friends, my message today is we’ve only just started. Of course the country faces hard times. There is no doubt the Tories have left Britain in a complete mess.\n“Hear me when I say this, tough times don’t mean we lower our sights, we raise them.”\n03:35 PM BST\nGordon Rayner’s analysis of the Rachel Reeves speech\n03:28 PM BST\nWelsh First Minister: We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity\nEluned Morgan, the Welsh First Minister, has said it is time to “give hope” to people across the whole of Britain.\n“With Welsh Labour Governments in Cardiff and Westminster, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a fairer, greener and more prosperous future for everyone.\n“Let’s seize this moment, let’s work tirelessly to deliver the change that people deserve. Let’s give hope not just to Wales but for Britain, to all who believe in the power of progressive politics to transform lives.”\n03:04 PM BST\nLabour can ‘finish the job’ and oust SNP, says Sarwar\nAnas Sarwar has said Labour can “finish the job” by winning the Scottish general election in 2026.\n“The truth is that the story of Labour’s revival is only half written. You see, conference, for lots of you there was only one incompetent government you had to get rid of. But in Scotland we were stuck with two.\n“So at the general election we got rid of one incompetent government, and in 2026 at the general election we finish the job and we get rid of the other one.”\n02:59 PM BST\nAnas Sarwar: We delivered a political earthquake in Scotland\nAnas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, received a standing ovation as he started to speak.\n“What a year it has been. In the 12 months since we last met, we no longer have a Tory government, we now have the fewest Tory MPs in modern political history, we have the SNP beaten in Scotland and we now have a UK Labour Government that has started the journey for change,” Mr Sarwar said.\n“We have, crucially, for the first time in 14 years a Labour Prime Minister. A Prime Minister that understands Scotland, cares about Scotland and is determined to deliver for Scotland. And for the first time ever, we have a female Chancellor in Rachel Reeves who made a fantastic speech earlier today and made clear there will be no return to austerity with a Labour Government.\n“And in Scotland we delivered a political earthquake, with a record swing to Scottish Labour. Our share of the vote went up 16 per cent, meaning we now have not one Scottish Labour MP, we now have 37 Scottish Labour MPs putting Scotland at the heart of a Labour Government.”\n02:49 PM BST\nEDF chief executive: Electricity could be free some parts of the week\nBritain’s expansion of green energy could mean electricity becomes free for some parts of the week, according to the chief executive of EDF Renewables, writes Jonathan Leake\nSundays are the most likely day, he suggested, because demand for electricity is usually lowest when many businesses are closed.\nSpeaking at the Labour party conference, Matthieu Hue said that the surging role and capacity of renewables like wind and solar in the UK’s electricity system meant supply would sometimes exceed demand, driving down prices.\n“Demand is not the same every hour of the day, or every day of the week.There are a number of companies, including EDF, who believe that electricity will be free [at some times] - perhaps on a Sunday.”\n“This will also be made possible through the installation of smart meters which let people see what energy they are consuming.”\nThe pledge is reminiscent of the similar promise once often made about nuclear energy - that it would one day produce so much energy that electricity would be “too cheap to meter”. In reality, nuclear power has proven to be one of the most expensive ways of producing electricity.\n02:45 PM BST\nLabour ‘ripping up the very roots of Thatcherism’\nLouise Haigh has said Labour is “ripping up the very roots of Thatcherism” now it is in power, writes Nick Gutteridge.\nMs Haigh, the Transport Secretary, said: “Because of what we achieved together, we are not just cleaning up the mess of the last 14 years, we are ripping up the very roots of Thatcherism that have undermined and run down our transport system for decades.\n“Privatisation of our transport is not pragmatism. It hasn’t spurred innovation. It hasn’t made things better. It belongs to a past that failed.”\n02:37 PM BST\n‘Get on with it’, says Labour MP in nuclear power push\nA Labour MP representing West Cumbria has urged ministers to “get on with it” and commit to building more nuclear power plants, writes Matt Oliver amid doubts that they will stick with plans first announced by the Conservatives.\nJosh MacAllister, MP for Whitehaven and Workington, said nuclear energy was essential to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and would create skilled, long-lasting jobs.\nHe was speaking at a Labour conference panel after The Telegraph revealed a target announced under Boris Johnson for 24 gigawatts of nuclear capacity is being reviewed under Ed Miliband, the Energy Secretary.\nMr MacAllister said: “Where are the next four or five gigawatt-scale reactors going to come from in the next 20 years? Let’s pick the sites. Let’s pick the tech. Let’s get on with it. Let’s give confidence to investors to crowd in behind that.\n“You know, we could debate for years which reactor design will be best, but let’s pick and stick and then get the benefits of scale.”\nAsked where they should be built, he said: “My community supports it because it creates really good quality, skilled jobs and economic pride. The most popular thing I could do is stand in the middle of Whitehaven and say, ‘We’ve got you a new nuclear reactor’.”\nLord Hunt, the nuclear minister, was also on the panel and stressed the Government’s support for nuclear power, saying: “Does nuclear have a role to play in our future energy structure? The answer to that is yes.”\n02:28 PM BST\nLabour need to be in power for at least ‘40 years’ to transform working life, trade union official says\nA trade union official has said Labour needs to be in power for “40 to 50” years to truly transform working life, Lucy Burton writes.\nSpeaking to a packed room at a fringe event taking place at Labour conference, Gloria Mills said: “We must remain in power for the next 40, 50 years if we’re going to transform this country. Some people think power is a dirty word. It’s not. It’s how you use power – for too long there has been an imbalance of power.”\nMs Mills added that the “era of rogue employers is over” and said “we must have free, unfettered access to every workplace in this country”.\nDuring the fringe discussion, a group of Unite members stood outside in the rain chanting “Keir Starmer hear us say, tax the rich and make them pay”.\nPaul Nowak, the head of the TUC, said Britain is suffering from “an epidemic of low-paid, insecure employment.”\nThe workers rights plans, which include ending the practice of ‘fire and rehire’ and introducing ‘day one’ workers rights, is a major talking point at today’s conference as the government closes in on publishing its employments bill next month.\n02:03 PM BST\n‘Nobody can take this Government seriously’, James Cleverly says\nResponding to Rachel Reeves’ speech, James Cleverly said: “Nobody can take this Chancellor or this Government seriously.\n“Their priorities are all wrong. They talk about taking tough decisions, but capitulate in union negotiations.\n“They will tax more and more to spend more and more.\n“Labour aren’t taking the tough decisions, they’re making the wrong decisions.\n“We can all see that they cannot be trusted with the public finances, or the economy.”\n01:56 PM BST\nLabour told it ‘can go to hell’ over decision to cut winter fuel payment\nLabour was told it “can go to hell” by union activists over Rachel Reeves’ decision to cut the winter fuel payment for millions, Ruby Hinchliffe writes.\nMembers of Unite gathered at the Albert Dock in Liverpool, despite the pouring rain, to protest against the Chancellor’s controversial policy.\nAudrey White of the Liverpool Pensions Association, and a Unite activist, told the crowd: “These aren’t privileges, these aren’t things they should be able to take away.\n“These pensioners have worked all their lives.\n“I stood there yesterday, and as they [attendees] were walking into the conference, I said 4,000 pensioners – their own figures – are going to die. They smirked at me.\n“One of them, when I shouted this, turned round and said ‘good’. The people on the gate were horrified.\n“They can all go to hell if they go through with this policy.”\n01:43 PM BST\nLift two child benefit cap to help kids lead ‘richer lives’\nMore unenthusiastic reaction to the Chancellor’s speech has appeared.\nBecca Lyon, the head of UK child poverty at Save the Children, said: “If the Chancellor is serious about helping working class kids from ordinary backgrounds lead richer lives, then they need to remove barriers like scrapping the two-child limit to Universal Credit.\n“Doing this would lift 360,000 children out of poverty, and many families subject to this are in work – they are part of the working Britain the Chancellor speaks of. Currently the odds are unfairly stacked against these children.\n“Rolling out breakfast clubs from April is a good first step, but much more must be done, starting with meaningful targets to reduce child poverty as part of an ambitious strategy.”\n01:20 PM BST\n‘Growth on its own won’t reduce poverty’\nReaction has been pouring in to Rachel Reeves’s speech just now.\nAlfie Stirling, director and chief economist of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “Families who have been struggling to put food on the table and pay their energy bills are not sharing the Chancellor’s optimism today. They want to know when change begins for them.\n“Her talk of tough decisions has created a fear of what is to come in the Budget, and a dread that this winter will be as bad, if not worse, than the last. The Chancellor promised an end to austerity, but didn’t signal how she would support families already struggling to make ends meet.\n“Across the UK, families can’t wait for economic growth before they feel their situation improve. By failing to repair the foundations, like housing, welfare and public services, that underpin people’s lives the government also risks failing on its own terms to deliver a resilient economy.\n“As we have shown today, growth on its own won’t reduce poverty. For the economy to thrive we need to unlock the talent and potential of the millions of people currently trapped in poverty and insecurity. The Budget next month must make tackling economic insecurity - across, incomes, housing and care, as well as work - a top priority of the Government’s mission for growth.”\n01:10 PM BST\n‘Concerted campaign to whip up fear’ over Rayner reforms\nJustin Madders, the minister for employment rights, has said there is a “concerted campaign in the media to whip up fear” over Labour’s New Deal for Working people, writes Eir Nolsøe.\nSpeaking at a fringe event at Labour Conference alongside union bosses, Mr Madders said some of the headlines in the media on it were “laughable”.\nHe said: “We know it’s a popular policy.”\nIt comes despite business groups expressing concerns about some of the reforms.\n01:09 PM BST\nWhat you made of Rachel Reeves’s speech\n01:06 PM BST\nSign up to the Telegraph Politics Newsletter\nLet me be your guide to the important decisions facing MPs and the biggest stories in Westminster, delivered to your inbox for free every weekday.\nSign up to The Telegraph Politics Newsletter to read updates from the corridors of power, must-read opinion from our columnists, amusing cartoons and a standout quote in your inbox, every weekday.\nYou can register to receive the newsletter for free here\n12:56 PM BST\nOne in eight young Britons ‘not doing anything’\nOne in eight young Britons are “not doing anything”, according to the employment minister, who warned that lockdown had driven a “rapid” increase in youth worklessness, writes Szu Ping Chan.\nAlison McGovern admitted that many young people had been left disillusioned by “politician bull——“, as she hinted Labour would pour more money into mental health and transport services to enable people to get to work.\nMs McGovern said it was “a disaster” and “completely unacceptable” that millions of young people were being left on the scrap heap.\nSpeaking at a fringe event at the Labour Party conference, Ms McGovern said the number of people not in employment, education or training (NEET) had jumped sharply since the pandemic.\n“If you look at the growth recently of young people who are not doing anything - I think we should say it how it is - which is people are being left on the scrap heap. They’re not doing anything in a way that is completely unacceptable and will have a very damaging effect on the future.\n“And if you look at those levels, they’ve increased rapidly since the pandemic, and that is not acceptable. That’s about one in eight young people now not doing anything.”\nOfficial figures show half a million young adults are now out of work, with many suffering from the impact of lost and disrupted education since the pandemic.\n12:45 PM BST\nRachel Reeves concludes her speech\nRachel Reeves concluded: “We changed our party. Let us change our country. This is our moment, our chance to show that politics can make a difference, that Britain’s best days lie ahead.\n“Our families, our communities, our country need not look on while the future is built somewhere else...\n“That is a Britain we’re building, that is the Britain I believe in. Together, let’s go and build it.”\n12:41 PM BST\nClimate Resistance group: We were behind speech disruption\nA campaign group called The Climate Resistance has claimed responsibility for the protest which disrupted Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ conference speech.\nSam Simons, a spokesman for the group said: “Labour promised us change - instead we’re getting more of the same. The same pandering to the fossil fuel industry; the same arms licences that are fuelling a genocide in Gaza, and the same austerity that sees the poorest hit hardest.\n”It’s time for Labour to start putting the needs of people before the interests of profit. That means immediately stopping arms licences to Israel, blocking new oil and gas, and standing up for the communities already being devastated by the climate crisis.”\n12:39 PM BST\nBreaking: Reeves’s pay rise rejected by nurses\nIt is not the news Rachel Reeves will want to come off stage to when her speech finishes.\nNurses have rejected the Government’s pay award of a 5.5 per cent rise, the Royal College of Nursing has announced.\n12:38 PM BST\nReeves: We’re building a better Britain\nRachel Reeves received a standing ovation as she said: “This Labour Government will make work pay.\n“That is the Britain we’re building, that is the Britain I believe in.”\nMs Reeves said she was proud to deliver the first “meaningful” pay rise for public sector workers in years.\n“If the Conservative Party want a fight about who can be trusted with Britain’s public services for those who use them, then I say bring it on. Public services that we can be proud of once again with a Labour Government. That is the Britain that we’re building, that is the Britain that I believe in.”\n12:34 PM BST\nReeves: We will create and share wealth across Britain\nRachel Reeves continued: “You will see in your town or your city is a sight that we have not seen often enough in our country.\n“Shovels in the ground, cranes in the sky, the sounds and the sight of the future, arriving. We will make that a reality.\n“Wealth created and wealth shared in every part of Britain, that is the Britain we’re building, that is the Britain I believe in.”\n12:33 PM BST\nWatch: Moment pro-Palestinian heckler was removed from Reeves speech\n12:32 PM BST\nReeves announces new industrial strategy\nRachel Reeves says that along with Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary, she will publish a new industrial strategy next month.\n12:31 PM BST\nChancellor defends winter fuel cuts\n“We cancelled road and rail projects promised by the Conservatives which they did not budget for.\n“And I made the choice to means test the winter fuel payment so that it’s only targeted to those most in need.\n“I know that not everyone in this hall or in the country will agree with every decision that I make. I will not duck those decisions for political expediency, not for personal advantage.”\n12:26 PM BST\nReeves: My optimism for Britain burns brighter than ever\nRachel Reeves told Labour’s conference: “I believe in a better Britain, a Britain of opportunity, fairness and enterprise.\n“I know that country has sometimes felt far off in recent years as our growth, our productivity and family finances all behind.\n“But it doesn’t have to be that way. The British capacity for inventiveness, enterprise, often hard work, has not gone away.\n“Believe me when I say, my optimism for Britain turns brighter than ever. My ambition knows no limits, because I can deceases if we make the right choices now... Growth is the challenge and investment is the solution.”\n12:24 PM BST\nRachel Reeves defends private school raid as ‘the Britain I believe in’\n“We said we would not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, National Insurance or VAT.\n“And we will cap corporation tax at its current level for the duration of this Parliament .\n“Conference, as promised, we will extend the energy profit levy on oil and gas producers to invest in homegrown energy here in Britain.\n“We will end the non-dom tax loopholes, and we will crack down on tax avoidance and tax evasion. That is the difference our Labour Government will make.”\nMs Reeves said her party’s private school VAT raid “is the fair choice, the responsible choice, the Labour choice to support the 94 per cent of our children in our state schools.\n“That is the Britain we’re building. That is the Britain that I believe in.”\n12:23 PM BST\nReeves: There will be no return to austerity in Budget\nRachel Reeves said: “Next month I will deliver the first Budget of this Labour government.\n“And because I know how much damage has been done in those 14 years, let me say one thing straight up. There will be no return to austerity.\n“Yes, we must deal with the Tory legacy, and that means tough decisions, but I won’t let that dim our ambition for Britain.\n“So real ambition, a budget to fix the foundations, a budget to deliver the change that we promised a budget to rebuild, Britain, and my budget will keep our manifesto commitment. Every choice we make will be within a framework of economic and fiscal stability, you’d expect nothing less.”\n12:19 PM BST\nPictured: Protester is escorted out of Rachel Reeves’s speech\n12:18 PM BST\nRachel Reeves: Tories promised solutions they knew could never be paid for\n“They promised solutions that they knew could never be paid for roads that would never be built.\n“Public transport that would never arrive, hospitals that would never treat a single patient.\n“They showed no regarding people, and they did not care about the consequences.\n“It was made clear to me that failure to act swiftly could undermine the UK’s fiscal position with implications of public debt, mortgages and prices, and so I took action to make the in year savings necessary.”\n12:16 PM BST\nI am impatient for change but it will be tough, says Reeves\nRachel Reeves resolved to show an “iron discipline” as Chancellor.\n“Now I know that you are impatient for change. I am too.\n“But conference, because of that legacy left by the Conservatives, the road ahead is steeper and harder than expected.\n“You don’t need to take my word for it. Figures released only on Friday showed another month of record borrowing, debt at 100% of GDP, that is the inheritance they left in black and white.”\n12:15 PM BST\nReeves mocks ‘clash of the titans’ Tory leadership race\nRachel Reeves mocked the Tory leadership contest, sarcastically calling it a “clash of the titans”.\n“Never forget what the Conservatives did years ago today...

Yes, most of all, I’m here because of the efforts of those who went before me, trailblazing women.\n“Jenny Lee, Barbara Castle, our friend and our inspiration. Harriet Harman. And I’m here because of thousands of women, many of you in the hall today, broke down barriers and defeated low expectations to pave the way for the rest of us.\n“I am a Labour Chancellor because of that collective endeavour. I am the first woman Chancellor because of that collective endeavour.\n“And that collective endeavour does not stop here. It falls to me and to our generation of Labour women to follow in the footsteps of those who went before us, to write the work of all women back into our economic story.\n“To show our daughters and our granddaughters that they need place no ceiling on their ambitions. That is the Britain we’re building. That is the Britain I believe in.”\n12:07 PM BST\nRachel Reeves: I have fulfilled my promise of becoming first female Chancellor\n“In this hall one year ago I stated my intention that the next time I addressed you, I would do so as the first ever female Chancellor of the Exchequer. Today, conference, you can consider that’s a promise fulfilled.\n“800 years, the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer has existed, every one a man. On July 5 we made history.\n“Every woman watching this will know no matter how high you climb, how hard you work, how qualified you are, there will always be moments when you are reminded some people still do not believe women can get the job done.\n“Millions of women in our party, in our trade unions and in every walk of life, beat back those doubts.”\n12:05 PM BST\nReeves: I’m ready to deliver on NHS and housing\nRachel Reeves is given a rapturous reception by Labour delegates after an introductory video.\n“Conference, thank you. This time last year, I stood on this stage and I made a commitment.

He will also take photos for Ms Rayner’s department, the Ministry of Housing.\nJohn Glen, the shadow paymaster general, said: “This is just the latest in a long line of Labour ministers saying one thing and then doing another.\n“Labour’s promise to cut the size of the government spin bill was nothing more than empty words, they’d rather spend taxpayers’ money on their own vanity projects than on keeping pensioners warm this winter.\n“After scrapping Conservative plans to slim down civil service headcount, Labour should stop pretending that their decision to cut the winter fuel allowance was anything other than a political choice.”\n11:05 AM BST\nRosie Duffield criticises Cabinet over free Taylor Swift tickets\nRosie Duffield, the backbench Labour MP, has criticised top Labour figures including Sir Keir Starmer and Bridget Phillipson, the Education Secretary, who accepted free tickets to Taylor Swift.\nMs Duffield said: “I had Taylor tickets during her last visit to the UK, paid for myself obviously.\n“We earn more than most people so why on Earth should we all take free tickets while others save up and queue?”\n11:03 AM BST\nComing up\nRachel Reeves, the Chancellor, is set to speak in just under an hour as she gives her keynote speech at Labour conference.\nOther speakers after Ms Reeves will include Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour Leader, Eluned Morgan, the Labour First Minister of Wales, and Ed Miliband, the Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary.\n10:50 AM BST\nAnalysis: Winter fuel vote boos a sign of the strain to come\nIt was a lot of drama for not long after 9am on a Monday morning.\nA vote on a winter fuel allowance motion being pushed back to Wednesday, the final day of Labour’s annual conference when a lot of people will have gone home, went down like a lead balloon with the unions.\nThe vote had been expected to take place on the conference floor today, prompting boos and jeers when the change was announced.\nIt is a reflection of just how strongly many in Labour feel about Rachel Reeves’s decision to strip around 10 million pensioners of their winter fuel payments.\nOnly one Labour MP, Jon Trickett, voted to cancel the policy when Parliament had its say earlier this month. But the fact dozens more abstained, and that tensions are running high in parts of the Labour membership, points to tricky times ahead for Ms Reeves and Sir Keir Starmer.\n10:33 AM BST\nNeville’s on the ball\n10:29 AM BST\nTories: Reeves must take responsibility\nRachel Reeves must “take responsibility” for her economic choices, the Tories have said.\nGareth Davies, the shadow exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said: “Today, the Chancellor will again use her discredited narrative on her economic inheritance to avoid taking responsibility for the choices she has made.\n“She has spent billions on inflation busting public sector pay rises for trade union backers paid for by snatching £300 from pensioners at the same time accepting thousands of pounds in free clothes and luxury holidays whilst telling families to tighten their belts.\n“She must take responsibility for the political choices she is making, now and at her first Budget.

And the problems that the Tories have left are much worse than we thought.\n“As Defence Secretary I know this myself. Ships without enough sailors to crew them, military housing with no running water, defence plans with billion pound black holes. And yet and despite everything the Tories did, the total commitment of civilian staff, industry workers, service personnel to defend this nation remains undiminished. And so I say to them on behalf of us all, we’re proud of your professionalism, we’re proud of your dedication, we thank you for everything that you do.”\n09:52 AM BST\nJohn Healey: Labour is the party of defence\nJohn Healey, the Defence Secretary, said Labour was elected “to deliver for the people and we will”.\n“Ours is a party with deep roots defending this country, the party that established Nato and the nuclear deterrent, the party of the working men and women who built the warships, who made the missiles, who served on the frontline to protect us all,” he said in his conference speech.\n“At this historic election we had a record number of people who have served in the frontline forces elected as Labour MPs.

It made a big difference to me. It was never something that I planned to continue in government as Chancellor.\n“And that’s not something I’ll be doing, but I was grateful for that support and politicians and political campaigns do rely on donations. But I do get people’s concerns about it and it’s why I think it’s so important that politicians are always transparent and declare things that they get support with.\n“I don’t begrudge people going to watch a football match or going to a concert, but I think it is so important that things are done transparently, and that now in government we hold ourselves to the highest possible standards.”\n09:25 AM BST\nLabour is either shameless or stupid – close inspection at party conference suggests both\nSome people would say that after the last week of headlines, to begin Labour’s conference with a video about the evils of cronyism in the Tory party would suggest that they’re either shameless or stupid, writes Madeline Grant.\nAs somebody who is there on the ground, I can absolutely assure you that close inspection suggests they are both.\n“Oink, oink, oink” went the Cabinet around the TV channels as the conference began in Liverpool.\nThis little piggy went to New York, this little piggy got new glasses, this little piggy cried “change change change” all the way home. Alas, Sir Keir had weightier things to do than attend the customary BBC interview and risk an interrogation about his free gift addiction: another measurement of his ample bottom for some tailor-made trousers perhaps?

We work well into the evening, not just me and my political team, but civil servants. And we came in on a Saturday and a Sunday.\n“We did that in the office, not on Zoom, because I do think there is real value in bringing people together and sharing ideas. You’re challenging each other.”\nChallenged on why Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary, had warned against “presenteeism”, Ms Reeves replied: “Well, I think that there is certainly a case for flexible working.... I think that if someone has got, you know, a school play of their kid or sports day, or they’ve got an elderly parent, they’ve got to take to a doctor’s appointment, I am all for being flexible and making sure that people can be able to balance work and family life.\n“But I do think that productivity gains are more likely to happen when you have that sharing of ideas and bringing people together, and I lead by example on that in my department, and I think that it’s, it’s ripping dividends.”\n08:00 AM BST\nReeves: Labour conference will vote on winter fuel cuts if it wants to\nRachel Reeves was asked about a delay to a Labour conference vote on stripping around 10 million pensioners of the winter fuel allowance.\nShe told LBC: “I don’t know the situation about when votes take place, but if delegates want a vote on this they will get a vote on this.\n“I don’t know the timing, but we’ve already had a vote in Parliament where it was overwhelmingly passed.\n“This isn’t the decision that I wanted to make. It wasn’t a decision that I expected to make, but given the state of the public finances I inherited I think it was right to restrict the winter fuel payment to the poorest pensioners and to make sure that all of the pensioners, entitled to it are getting it.”\n07:53 AM BST\nReeves: I want to lead most pro-growth Treasury ever\nRachel Reeves declared she wanted to lead the most “pro-growth” Treasury ever.\nShe told Sky News: “Bringing that stability, as well as the reform, the creation of the National Wealth Fund, the reforms of our planning system, unlocking investment from pensions to help start up and scale up businesses...\n“This is all part of our agenda to be the most pro-growth Government that this country has ever seen, because there is immense potential, huge potential, in our creative industries, in our professional services, in tech industries, low-carbon technologies.\n“I want those jobs here in Britain, there’s a global race on for these jobs, but if we can make the changes, which I’m determined to bring about.”\n07:53 AM BST\nLabour delays potentially humiliating winter fuel vote\nLabour has delayed a potentially humiliating vote on its winter fuel raid until the final day of its annual conference, writes our Political Correspondent Amy Gibbons.\nA motion urging the Government to reverse the decision to scrap the payments for millions of pensioners had been expected to be put to the floor this afternoon.\nBut The Telegraph understands it will now take place on Wednesday, typically the quietest day of the conference when business is winding down.\nThe vote has been forced by trade unions, who are piling pressure on the Prime Minister to restore the universal benefit.\nUnion sources had expected it to take place today. However, Labour decided it should be held on Wednesday instead. It is understood the unions are planning to protest the decision, with the aim of moving the vote back to today.\nUnite, one of Labour’s biggest donor unions, lashed out at the decision to delay the vote, describing the party as “tin eared”. It would be an embarrassment for Downing Street if the motion passed, meaning the conference had officially opposed the winter fuel cut.\n07:51 AM BST\nGood morning\nDominic Penna here, The Telegraph’s Political Correspondent, guiding you through the second day of Labour’s annual party conference here in Liverpool.\nRachel Reeves, the Chancellor, is seeking to strike an optimistic note about the long-term future of the economy during her broadcast media round as she prepares to make a keynote speech at midday.",
