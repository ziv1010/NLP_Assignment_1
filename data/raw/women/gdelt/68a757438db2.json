There is more gender equity among officials, with 42% of referees being female, ranging from 57% in Tier 1 leagues to 25% in Tiers 2 and 3.\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino said the report helps clubs, leagues and stakeholders gain a better understanding of the factors that drive success.\n\"The strides made in recent years have been remarkable, but there is still more work to be done to unlock its full potential,\" he said.\nSurveys for \"Setting the Pace\" were sent to 135 leagues and 1,518 clubs, with a total of 677 clubs in 90 leagues responding.\nFIFA tiers were determined by factors such as whether the league had a club licensing system, the number of a league's players who featured in the 2023 Women's World Cup and a member association's total budget for women's football among others.",
