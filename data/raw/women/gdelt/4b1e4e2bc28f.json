Which explains a recent OU women’s basketball practice, when the Sooners’ 6-foot-1 coach, almost 20 years after her Iowa playing days, was on the court not with a whistle, but with a mission.\nBaranczyk demonstrated help defense by banging against her post players. Ripping the ball out of their hands. Firing one-handed passes at cutting players.\nBaranczyk even does a little trash-talking.\n“I honestly do it, one, because I still can, and I just want to be with them,” Baranczyk said of her on-court commitment to her players.\nThe Friday ScissorTales introduce you to Scott Draper, the Big 12’s new vice president for football, and consider an OU-LSU rivalry.\nMore:Tramel: Tanner Groves reminds us that even in defeat, you can find joy in basketball\nBut we start with OU women’s basketball. The Sooners face Texas Christian on Friday afternoon in the Big 12 Tournament quarterfinals at Municipal Auditorium, and the second-year OU coach has her Sooners as a No. 2 seed.\nBaranczyk continues to stamp her program, and she does so with as much showing as telling.\n“I think she does it because I don’t think anybody else is going to make us work as hard as she does,” senior Ana Llanusa said. “So when she steps on the court, we have to work 10 times harder, because she competes probably more than anybody else out there.”\nBaranczyk, then Jennie Lillis, was a star at Iowa. She scored 1,762 career points. Baranczyk knows how to coach and still knows how to play.\n“There’s time and place,” Baranczyk said. “I want them to get better, I want them to get tougher, I want them to do all these great things. So I’m definitely a me-too person.\n“But sometimes it’s just about getting competitive. And sometimes, you forget when you’re on the sideline, and you’re just kind of coaching, and you’re doing some things, that sometimes they maybe forget it’s about just competing and having fun and playing.”\nBaranczyk remembers back in 2017, when her Drake team played at Kansas State in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. On the practice floor the day before the game, Baranczyk was her usually involved self despite being “very pregnant.”\nMore:Lloyd Noble Center locker room project won't slow push for new OU basketball arena\n“I know our team was like, ‘what?’” Baranczyk said. “I don’t know. I guess I’m just wired different. I think they like it though.”\nBaranczyk reminded that her practice involvement came in the halfcourt. With sneakers that weren’t even tied.\nBut she said there are tangible advantages to a coach so physically involved in practices.\n“Sometimes, in our timeouts for example, we want it to be a conversation, because what I see is not what they’re feeling,” Baranczyk said. “But sometimes what they feel is not what we’re seeing. So the reality lies in the middle, so it is a conversation.\n“So sometimes, I just like to jump in and be able to feel it again, to remember that.\nSometimes showing things is a little bit easier.”\nIn games, like Friday against TCU, Baranczyk has to instruct her players by telling. But on the practice court, sometimes it’s best to show.\nMore:Madi Williams' status up in the air, but OU is 'extremely hungry' to win Big 12 Tournament\nMailbag: More SEC rivalry talk\nSoutheastern Conference rivalries is an evergreen subject with OU fans.\nTodd: “Thinking about OU's SEC scheduling. Can we assume UT-Texas A&M will be back on for Thanksgiving (rivalry) weekend? If so, it seems like OU and LSU will be the only schools not paired to play a rival that weekend. Do you think that indicates OU-LSU as one of the three fixed opponents? Besides UT, which school do you see becoming a true rivalry series for OU? After losing Nebraska and OSU, OU is in need of establishing rivals.”\nTramel: No, I don’t OU-Louisiana State as an annual rival. But it’s an interesting concept. Let’s see. Who doesn’t have a Thanksgiving weekend rival?\nAlabama-Auburn. Ole Miss-Mississippi State. Florida, Georgia, Kentucky and South Carolina play in-state non-conference showdowns. A&M-Texas. Tennessee-Vanderbilt. That leaves OU, Louisiana State, Arkansas and Missouri.\nArkansas-LSU was a Thanksgiving rivalry for awhile, but it’s been replaced by Arkansas-Missouri.\nSo Todd’s reasoning makes perfect sense. I just don’t think LSU is going to be an OU annual opponent. LSU seems almost surely to be pitted with A&M and Alabama.\nBut who knows? Maybe the SEC will give in to Nick Saban’s request and replace LSU with Florida as Bama’s annual opponent. That would leave OU and LSU together, and they could play Thanksgiving weekend.\nOf course, what would be ideal is if Arkansas-Missouri played on Thanksgiving weekend, and OU and OSU scheduled the Bedlam Series. But that seems a no-go.\nMore:How Reggie Pearson's unlikely college football journey led him to OU football\nScott Draper knows the AAC schools\nScott Draper is new to Big 12 football, as the conference’s vice president for the gridiron sport.\nCome July 1, Central Florida, Houston and Cincinnati will be new to the Big 12, as the conference’s newest members.\nBut Draper and those three schools will not be new to each other. Draper was the American Conference’s primary football administrator from 2014-22, and those three schools come in from the American, joining with Brigham Young to create a 14-member Big 12.\nSo while the rest of the Big 12 – players, coaches, administrators, fans, media – must learn about the new schools, Draper has a big head start.\n“Three of those guys I know very well,” Draper said this week in Kansas City, where he’s attending the Big 12 Tournament. “That onboarding of those programs into our league has been ongoing.\n“They’ve played football at the highest level; all three of ‘em have competed in the CFP (College Football Playoff) world, in a host (major) bowl.”\nCincinnati made the 2021 playoff. Central Florida played in back-to-back major bowls (2017, 2018). Houston played in a major bowl in 2015. Those American teams combined to go 2-2 in those games.\n“Competing at the highest level is not foreign to them,” Draper said. “That’s why they’re here.\n“Of course, BYU, their program speaks for itself, what they’ve done over the years. And what they’ve done the last few years, with how hard they’ve competed and the seasons that they’ve had.”\nMore:Tramel: Did Oklahoma State do enough to make March Madness? Cowboys will need some grace\nDraper spent 19 years working in the Michigan athletic department, starting as a football video coordinator and finishing as director of football operations. Draper played football at Eastern Michigan.\nDraper was a Michigan man – the 2004 season Rose Bowl still haunts him; Texas beat the Wolverines 38-37, and he’s got the photo memory of the game-winning field goal going through the hands of Michigan’s Ernest Shazor, who nearly blocked the kick.\nNow, Draper says, he tells coaches his perspective has changed.\n“My background is on campus,” Draper said. But he joined the American Conference “and really just liked being a part of more than just one team. I used to have one coach and one team to pull for and help. Now I’ve got 12, 14, 10, whatever the numbers are these days.\n“Really enjoyed being a part of something more than just one.”\nDraper’s job is five-fold:\nOversee football officiating; build and retain relationships with ESPN and Fox as they build out the football schedule; work with the Big 12’s bowl games; work with the NCAA, including serving on boards like the football rules committee; and building competitive balance within the conference and maintaining relationships with the schools and coaches.\n“Be their advocate,” Draper said. “I tell the coaches all the time that my job is to be your advocate.”\nDraper said he’s enjoyed working with rookie commissioner Brett Yormark.\n“To be around a commissioner who comes from a non-traditional space, and learn from him, which I’m learning every day, all those things have been more than I ever thought I could get in the 5-6 months I’ve been here,” Draper said. “I’ve loved every minute of it.”\nAnd he’s got familiar faces as he adjusts to the Big 12.\n“I think their step into our league, my job is to make sure operationally we’re on the same page, which we will be,” Draper said. “But as they step on the field, they’re ready to go. That’s going to make our league great next year.”\nMore:Tramel's ScissorTales: Oklahoma State coach Jacie Hoyt's basketball dream began in Kansas City\nBig 12's Brett Yormark lauds basketball\nBrett Yormark is deal-making, high-rolling New Yorker. But the new Big 12 commissioner also is presenting himself as a man of the people.\nThe media this year was moved from its traditional courtside seating to the hockey pressbox, at the top of T-Mobile Center. Some have complained, but Yormark explained it was simple economics – the Big 12 is expected to reap $1.5 million in extra revenue for its premium seating, with more to come next season.\nAnd Yormark spent part of the OSU-Texas game Thursday night sitting in the very same hockey pressbox with the scribes.\nThen Friday morning, before tipoff of the OSU-West Virginia women’s game at Municipal Auditorium, there sat Yormark on press row, ready to take in the game.\nYormark is bullish on Big 12 basketball.\n“As the rookie commissioner, having just experienced my first basketball season, it’s been great,” Yormark said. “Nothing short of spectacular. On the men’s side, probably unprecedented.”\nYormark is into national perceptions. And he likes what is being said about Big 12 basketball.\n“You think about the strength of this conference and the national narrative,” Yormark said. “I made my way throughout the conference, attending both men’s and women’s games. The level of fandom and passion for this conference is unrivaled.\n“Ratings are up nine percent plus across the season on ESPN. I think they do an incredible job creating the right narrative for us nationally.”\nYormark said he also attended a variety of women’s games.\n“Very deep, lot of parity,” Yormark said. “Excited for them to be joining us here (T-Mobile Center) next year. Making this into a two-week moment for the conference. I’ll be spending quite a bit of time over at the Auditorium later this week. I think we’re setting ourselves up very nicely for the NCAA Tournament.”\nFootball butters the Big 12 bread. But Yormark said he wants to expand basketball’s brand. He’s doing his part.\nMore:Tramel: How Brett Yormark's TV deal is already paying off for Big 12 Conference\nThe List: Conference tournament hosts\nThe SEC got the jump on basketball tournaments. The SEC staged a post-season tournament from 1933-53. The Atlantic Coast began its tournament with the advent of the league in 1954. The Big Six started a holiday tournament in 1946, which was joined by a post-season tournament in 1977.\nThe Big East Tournament arrived in 1983, the Big Ten Tournament in 1998 and the Pac-12 Tournament in 2002 (for good, after staging a tournament 1987-90).\nSo the Big 12 and its predecessors don’t have the corner on tournament history. But Kansas City has the corner as the top conference-tournament host in basketball history.\nHere are the cities that have hosted the most conference tournaments:\n1. Kansas City 74: KC has hosted 74 conference tournaments – 43 postseason tournaments, plus 31 holiday tournaments.\n2. Las Vegas 59: Depends on how you count it. Vegas never hosted a conference tournament until 2007, when the Mountain West arrived. But the West Coast Conference came in 2009, the Western Athletic Conference in 2011, the Pac-12 in 2013 and the Big West in 2021. And none have left.\n3. New York 44: Give the Big Apple credit for diversity. Madison Square Garden has hosted 41 straight Big East Tournaments – every year since the league started – but also the 2018 Big Ten Tournament. And Brooklyn has twice hosted the ACC Tournament.\n4. St. Louis 34: Arch Madness has become an NCAA staple – St. Louis has hosted the Missouri Valley Tournament every year since 1991. And St. Louis hosted one SEC Tournament.\n5. Greensboro 28: No site is as entwined with the ACC Tournament as Greensboro, which first hosted in 1967.\n6. Atlanta 19: Give the ATL credit for diversity, too. Atlanta has hosted 13 SEC Tournaments and six ACC Tournaments, most recently in 2012.\n7. Los Angeles 13: LA’s Staples Center has hosted 11 Pac-12 Tournaments, while the Great Western Forum in Inglewood and UCLA’s Pauley Pavilion each hosted one.\n7. Indianapolis 13: Indy and Chicago traditionally have alternated the Big Ten Tournament, but Indianapolis has a 13-11 lead.\n9. Raleigh 13: The first 13 ACC Tournaments were staged at North Carolina State’s Reynolds Coliseum, 1954-66, but the conference hasn’t been back to Raleigh since.\n9. Nashville 13: Music City has hosted 13 SEC Tournaments, tying Atlanta for the most.\n9. Charlotte 13: That’s pretty good. Three North Carolina cities – Greensboro, Raleigh and Charlotte – have combined to host 54 ACC Tournaments.\nBerry Tramel: Berry can be reached at 405-760-8080 or at btramel@oklahoman.com.
