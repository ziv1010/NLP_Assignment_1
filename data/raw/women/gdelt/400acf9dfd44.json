A rough meditation between the first bounce and the final siren\nA small band of long-suffering nominated fathers drove around our little district on rainy Saturday mornings through autumn and winter, picking up kids wearing footy jumpers and carrying a variety of home-sewed carryalls that could be called, loosely, training bags.\nIt was game day for the under-12s in a town up the road.\nWe crowded into Holdens and Falcons, chattering about our chances and comparing scabbed knees from last week’s outing.\nWe were what was called “enthusiastic”, meaning lacking in the talent department, and we didn’t trouble our young hearts too much with hopes of a premiership.\nBut it was Saturday morning and in the swampy centre of undrained grounds there awaited glorious mud to be rolled in, the better for camouflaging our fumbles with the ball when the pressure was on.\nThere was the eager sound of car horns should a goal be kicked and the occasional encouraging bellow or dismayed cursing from one of the nominated fathers.\nAfterwards, with most of the mud scrubbed off in lukewarm showers and all of us changed into fresh clothes packed by our mums in those hand-sewn training bags, we’d ferret around in our pockets for a couple of bob with which to treat ourselves to a hot pie with sauce at the bakery.\nThe trip home involved self-conscious analysis of marks taken and condemnation of the filthy play of opponents, the nominated father puffing a Craven A, his window wound up lest fresh air interfere with his smoking pleasure.\nFooty.\nIt’s a magical word for those of us raised in Victoria.\nYes, yes: also in South Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and Western Australia, if we are to be accurate and equitable.\nAnd these days, in parts of Queensland, NSW and the ACT, too, though you wouldn’t want to mention it loudly around those whose body types don’t include a neck and who imagine rugby league is the only game played north of the Murray.\nBut my mates and I weren’t raised in any of those places, so fairness can take a place in the queue behind parochialism on a weekend like this.\nThe footy’s back.\nIt’s best here to ignore the existence of rugby union, imported from the Great Public Schools system of England, and the endless hot debate about football being the proper name for soccer.\nFooty means Australian Rules football for those of us who rolled around as under-12s in Victoria’s winter mud and rewarded ourselves with a restorative pie and sauce afterwards.\nTruth to tell, lacking both the physical aptitude and the desire to train when alternative pleasures beckoned, I never advanced much from the under-12s and the roughhouse of kick-to-kick in the schoolyard.\nBut footy never lost its ability to weave a spell over autumn and winter weekends, even if it meant standing on the sidelines and cheering on a local or school team, or sprawled in front of a TV, offering impolite advice to the screen.\nThese thoughts occurred over the last few days while chatting with Pat Dodson, now a splendidly bewhiskered senator, who a long time ago was the captain of our country school’s First XVIII.\nWe yarned about a few of the names we remembered, footy stripping away the years, and I was visited by the image of a stab pass from the young Dodson, whistling like a missile and with the power to strip the wind clean out of the poor sod required to receive it.\nDodson’s team, and a few that followed, were all but unbeatable. Lou Richards once came down from the smoke accompanied by a photographer and produced a double-page spread in the old Sun News-Pictorial that referred to our school as “the football factory”.\nIt wasn’t far wrong, for in the late 1960s it was populated by a Cranage, an early Rioli, a Grinter, the Delahuntys and a bit later, a Billy Picken, to name a few who went on to thrill millions and create footy dynasties.\nOn Friday this week, the ability of footy to transport memories across a lifetime was further confirmed when I accompanied a few old boys to a St Patrick’s Day lunch.\nAmong the gathering was the priest who long ago coached those school teams, a big bloke named Paul Castley. We called him Mad Dog, for we feared his temperament while admiring the furious tenacity of spirit that turned the First XVIII into a winning machine.\nHe is an erudite, gentler man of good humour in his late 80s these days, but it remains difficult not to think of him raging up and down wintry boundaries all those decades ago, roaring commands that thrilled those of us barracking, for it was the sound of another approaching victory, which was as much ours on the sidelines as that of the players.\nAnd there, perhaps, lies the magic of footy, which happily these days includes women.\nIt transfixes those of us who watch, binding us to our champions, drawing us into a sort of rough meditation that sets aside all that bothers us outside the two-and-a-half hours between the first bounce and the final siren.\nNo thought of mortgage or inflation may intrude, no threat imagined or real from across the sea, no bluster from a demanding boss.\nIt is just footy.\nAnd perhaps a hot pie with sauce. For the memories.",
