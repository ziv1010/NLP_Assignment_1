That report was released in December.\nRiley, who did not respond to request for comment from WRAL, was one of four former coaches banned. Former Chicago coach Rory Dames, former Louisville coach Christy Holly and former Washington coach Richie Burke were also banned. Allegations against each were outlined in the NWSL report. Other individuals were suspended. Six clubs were fined, with the Chicago Red Stars facing the largest fine at $1.5 million.\nThe penalties were based on a tiered system, according to the league, which took into account severity of the alleged misconduct, whether people knew or should have known, the frequency of the alleged misconduct, evidence of retaliation and how recently the alleged misconduct took place.\nRiley was fired in 2021 by the Courage.\n\"Over the last 16 months, we have fully cooperated and collaborated with the NWSL, the Joint Investigative Team and the Yates investigative team, and we are appreciative of the thoroughness of those processes,\" the Courage said in a Friday evening statement that was not attributed to any individual. \"We stand firmly with the league, the NWSL Players Association and fellow clubs in holding player safety and well-being as our top priority. While we still have much work ahead of us, we have made significant strides as an organization and are committed to making the necessary investments in our club and continuing the positive work for the future of our players, club, and league.\"\nTwo major investigations into alleged actions in the NWSL — the results of one released in October and another in December — implicated Riley. Former players called him \"a predator.\" Others detailed \"systemic abuse\" and alleged sexual coercion by Riley, who one player said created a \"culture of fear.\"\nAfter the first investigation, conducted by former U.S. Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, was released in October, Riley told WRAL News that he was \"not ready\" to talk and that the report was \"not much of an independent investigation.\"\nTwo Courage players had made complaints about Riley even before a published report in The Athletic in August 2021, according to the NWSL report. The complaints were focused on comment Riley made about players' weights. Courage player Kaleigh Kurtz alleged sexual harassment by Riley in the report as well.\nRiley became Courage's first coach in 2017 when it relocated from western New York. He led the club to three consecutive regular-season titles in 2017, 2018 and 2019, and back-to-back playoff championships in 2018 and 2019. The Courage lost in the final in 2017.\nRiley alleged misconduct dated back to his time as Portland's coach. The Courage were not \"provided a copy of the rport that led the Thorns to fire Riley and ... received only limited details from the Thorns, U.S. Soccer and the NWSL about Riley's misconduct in 2015,\" according to the Joint Investigative report released in December.\nRiley did not participate in the investigation, according to the report.\nAs a result of the actions stemming from the most recent investigation, the Courage must hire a sporting staff, including coaches and a general manager, that is distinct from the men's team, with which the Courage shares ownership. Courage staff must report directly to ownership. Steve Malik is the team's chairman and primary owner.\nCapitol Broadcasting, which owns WRAL, is a minority owner in the franchise.",
