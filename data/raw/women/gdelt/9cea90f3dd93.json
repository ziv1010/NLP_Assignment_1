  "body_text": "Whatever happened on the field at Sunday’s Super Bowl, it was clear that some of the real excitement of the game was generated by the wives and girlfriends of San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs players, with Kristin Juszczyk, Taylor Swift, Brittany Mahomes and others bringing a dazzling display of fashion and enthusiasm for their teams.\nThis select group of women — or WAGs, as the gossip media likes to call them — definitely seemed eager to win accolades for offering up the best and most uniquely glamorous and spirited style statement of the day.\nOf course, the bulk of everyone’s attention went to Swift — her outfit, how she confidently strode into Allegiant Stadium with her celebrity pals Blake Lively and Ice Spice. And how, after the Chiefs’ 25-22 win over the 49ers in overtime, she planted a long kiss on the lips of her boyfriend, Chiefs’ tight end Travis Kelce. TMZ reported that the celebratory kiss between the pop mega-star and her NFL boyfriend lingered a bit, was “seen round the world” and signaled that the two truly are in love and enjoying another high-profile moment in their “fairy tale” romance.\nSwift, arguably the most famous woman on the planet, had flown all the way from her Eras tour in Tokyo to Las Vegas to attend the Super Bowl and cheer on Kelce. She also spared no expense in pulling together an outfit for the event, at an estimated cost of more than $50,000, Page Six reported. The billionaire singer-songwriter donned a $720 crocheted black corset top, crystal-embellished $695 jeans and a more affordable ($160) bright red jacket, with the number “60” emblazoned to the back — a nod to the Chiefs’ first year of play, Page Six said.\nBut perhaps more eye-catching than even Swift’s signature red lipstick were her accessories, notably her bling in the form of a $4,250 “87” necklace, in honor of Kelce, a $7,500 tennis choker and a $3,210 ruby ring, Page Six also reported. Moreover, she also carried a bejeweled football clutch, which featured the “87” digits. The purse was said to be a surprise gift from NBA great Shaquille O’Neal, who also attended Sunday’s big game, Page Six said.\nBut it also could be said that the most sartorially spirited of the day’s wives and girlfriends wasn’t Swift but Kristin Juszczyk, the wife of 49ers tight end Kyle Juszczyk, who showed pride in her husband’s team by donning another of her fun, sports-themed designs.\nThe burgeoning fashion designer — who created the viral red Chiefs puffer coat that Taylor Swift wore to a game last month — sported a bespoke jacket that featured repurposed old jerseys that her husband purportedly once wore in high school, at Harvard and through his journey into the NFL, Page Six also reported.\n“It’s an honor and a privilege to be able to wear your story @juicecheck44. From high school to now there’s only ever been one goal! LETS GET IT,” Kristin Juszczyk captioned an Instagram Story reel, showing off her jacket, which also featured nods to her husband’s time on the Baltimore Ravens before he joined the 49ers.\nThe NFL’s official account also declared Kristin’s look the “best one yet,” according to Page Six.\nIncidentally, Kristin also created the jacket that Kyle wore when arriving at Allegiant Stadium Sunday, during the “Tunnel Fashion” walk that has become NFL players’ version of an awards-show red carpet. Kyle’s varsity-style jacket featured nods to his 49ers teammates, including quarterback Brock Purdy, as well as Deebo Samuels, George Kittle and other players, all of whom signed the piece.\nIt was a memorable day for Kristin in other ways. She celebrated her 30th birthday Sunday and her game-day designs recently won her an NFL licensing deal that allows her to use the league’s logos in her clothing.\nIn the run-up to the Super Bowl, Kristin designed a special Super Bowl LVIII puffer vest, which recently ended up in the possession of Gwen Stefani and Kelly Clarkson, among others, according to her Instagram page. Kristin’s design for the shiny silver Super Bowl vest also sold for $75,000 at auction to raise money for the National Breast Cancer Foundation.\nSpeaking of Brittany Mahomes, the wife of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes — and the newest Sports Illustrated swimsuit star — turned up at Allegiant Stadium, pushing a stroller for one of her two young children and rocking a sexy red, vinyl-looking tank top and slacks. Brittany also wore a fluffy, faux-white-fur-looking jacket, which itself was evocative of the “Mob Wife” aesthetic that is so fashionable today.\nAnother notable fashionista during this past NFL season was Claire Kittle, who showed herself on Instagram story Sunday attending a Super Bowl party the night before the game and holding up a sewing-machine-shaped 40th birthday cake to honor Kristin Juszczyk and her DIY approach to making unique clothing.\nFor Sunday’s game, Claire Kittle went for a metallic look, donning silver slacks, jacket and a bikini top. Claire Kittle also joined Brittany Mahomes and Olivia Culpo, the fiancee of 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, in wearing personalized versions of diamond number necklaces that were designed by Simon G Jewelry and which pay homage to their significant others, Page Six also reported.\nThis story has been updated.",
