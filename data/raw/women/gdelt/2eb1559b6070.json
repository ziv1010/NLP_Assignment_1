She had fallen out of love with football after a brief spell at Bayern Munich but credits former Red Devils boss Casey Stoney for helping her find that love again.\n“Casey was the one that got me back into football and got me enjoying it because I wasn’t playing when she called me to come and join the United team,” the 28-year-old explained in an interview with United’s official matchday programme for the West Ham game.\n“She had to give me some harsh words to make my mentality shift because I think for a while I wasn’t really connected. But I’ll always thank her for that.”\nIn the same interview, Galton added that it was initially ‘difficult’ for her when current boss Marc Skinner took over because she was asked to do things ‘different’ to what she was used to before. However, she also credits United's manager for now ‘getting the best out of me’.\nGalton is a firm fan favourite among the loyal United supporters and has a reputation of turning up for the big moments. Already this season she has scored at Old Trafford, the Etihad Stadium and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. And while she couldn't add to that personal tally at Old Trafford for the second time on Saturday, winning the ball back directly led to the crucial second goal.\nThe player told 90min earlier this year that it is her ambition to play Champions League football with United, stepping out onto the pitch to the sound of the competition anthem.\nFollowing the Old Trafford win United remain in a strong position to finish in the WSL top three and get that place European place for the first time. With games against Arsenal and Manchester City to come at home over the final six fixtures, their destiney is absolutely in their own hands.\nFor more from Jamie Spencer, follow him on Twitter!",
