  "body_text": "Ampem Darkoa Ladies have once again achieved a remarkable feat by clinching the domestic double for the second consecutive year.\nIn the finals of the Women’s FA Cup, they triumphed over Police Ladies with a 3-1 victory after extra time, securing their second title of the season.\nThe match started off with a goalless first half, but Police Ladies surprised Ampem Darkoa Ladies by taking the lead through Mary Berko in the 60th minute. Despite the setback, the champions persevered, and with only ten minutes remaining in regulation time, striker Ophelia Amponsah netted a crucial equalizer to force the game into extra time.\nThe first 15 minutes of extra time mirrored the goalless pattern of the initial half. However, Ampem Darkoa Ladies showcased their dominance in women’s football when Mary Amponsah scored just two minutes into the second half of extra time. She continued her outstanding performance by securing her brace only sixty seconds later, extending Ampem Darkoa’s lead to two goals and effectively sealing the victory.\nWith this remarkable achievement, Ampem Darkoa Ladies have now secured back-to-back domestic doubles, an extraordinary feat that solidifies their position as a force to be reckoned with in Ghanaian women’s football.\nAs a result of their success, they will have the honor of representing Ghana in the upcoming WAFU Zone B Women’s Champions League.",
