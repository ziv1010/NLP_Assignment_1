  "body_text": "Ballon d’Or 2024: Rodri, Bonmati triumph as Real Madrid boycott ceremony\nRM's decision to withdraw came after reports surfaced that Vinicius was unlikely to receive the prestigious accolade\nIn a night filled with drama and accolades, Manchester City midfielder Rodri was crowned the winner of the 2024 Ballon d’Or, while Aitana Bonmati secured the Ballon d'Or Feminin for the second consecutive year.\nThe ceremony in Paris saw Real Madrid's notable absence as the club boycotted the event over the perceived snub of their star player, Vinicius Junior, who was widely considered a frontrunner for the award.\nReal Madrid's decision to withdraw came after reports surfaced that Vinicius was unlikely to receive the prestigious accolade, prompting the club to cancel a pre-arranged private jet for the ceremony.\nThis boycott saw key figures including coach Carlo Ancelotti, star player Jude Bellingham, and club president Florentino Perez abstain from attending, leaving their prestigious men’s club of the year award unclaimed.\nRodri’s achievement marks a significant moment in football history, as he becomes the first Premier League player to win the award since Cristiano Ronaldo in 2008.\nHis stellar performance for Manchester City, including being named Euro 2024's player of the tournament, helped pave his path to this honour.\nAitana Bonmati's second win highlighted a successful evening for Barcelona, complemented by Lamine Yamal’s victory in the Kopa Trophy.\nIn a unique twist, both Harry Kane and Kylian Mbappe shared the Gerd Muller Trophy after scoring an impressive 52 goals each, while Emi Martinez received the Yashin Award for best goalkeeper.\nEmma Hayes, having led Chelsea to their fifth consecutive Women’s Super League title and the US women's team to Olympic gold, was celebrated as the best women’s coach.\nIn a heartfelt video message, she expressed her pride and honour in receiving the inaugural coaching award.\nDespite the absence of Real Madrid representatives, the night was also noteworthy for Jude Bellingham, who finished third in the voting, becoming the first Englishman in the top three since Gerrard and Lampard in 2005.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
