  "body_text": "Nigeria’s Super Eagles have slipped to 45th in the latest FIFA men’s world rankings released yesterday, dropping one place from their previous position and losing their spot among Africa’s top five teams.\nThe slump follows a series of lacklustre performances. The home-based squad endured a poor outing at the African Nations Championship (CHAN), suffering defeats to Sudan and Senegal before salvaging a win against Congo. Meanwhile, the main team laboured in World Cup qualifiers — edging Rwanda in Uyo and later being held to a draw by South Africa.\nThis marks a second consecutive fall, with the Eagles with a total point of 1483.86 previously sliding from 43rd to 44th in August following poor international outings.\nAcross Africa, several teams recorded progress. Morocco continues to lead the continent, ranking 11th in the world after winning eight of their last nine matches. Senegal, Egypt, Algeria, and Côte d’Ivoire follow, with Ivory Coast overtaking Nigeria for fifth place.\nThe Super Eagles, silver medallists at AFCON 2024, now trail behind these five nations in the continental standings. On the global stage, Spain rose to the top for the first time since 2014, replacing Argentina, who dropped to third. France moved up to second. Slovakia emerged as the biggest climber, surging 10 places to 42nd, while Zimbabwe suffered the steepest fall, dropping nine places to 125th.\nIn women’s football, Spain overtook the United States to claim the world’s number-one ranking. Nigeria’s Super Falcons retained their 36th position globally with 1,630.83 points, buoyed by victories over Morocco, South Africa, Zambia, Botswana, and Tunisia at the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations.\nOverall, more than 200 international matches were played since the previous FIFA/Coca-Cola rankings update, leading to significant shifts in the global standings. The next men’s ranking will be published on 23 October 2025, while the women’s ranking is scheduled for 11 December 2025.\nUPDATE NEWS:\nNigerians can now invest ₦2.5 million on premium domains and profit about ₦17-₦25 million.
