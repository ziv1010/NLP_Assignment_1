They are as follows:\nNo. 21 — Cocoa Beach\n\"Perched on Florida’s Space Coast, about an hour east of Orlando and about 90 minutes south of Daytona Beach on the Atlantic Ocean, Cocoa Beach is not only one of the Sunshine State’s most iconic beaches, but one of its most family-friendly destinations, too. Tourism began in the area in the mid-1920s by way of a bus tour to the beach, and by the late-1930s just 49 people lived in the coastal town. Fast-forward nearly a century and the city’s population has grown to 12,000, with more than 2.5 million annual visitors.\nThe draw? Aside from being the closest beach to Orlando, there are 6 miles of beaches; a chance to visit galaxies far, far away; plenty of arts and culture to enjoy; natural landscapes to explore on foot or by water; and some of the best surfing on the eastern seaboard. In fact, Cocoa Beach is considered the “Surf Capital of the East Coast.” The Space Coast also enjoys several natural phenomena, like sea turtle nesting (May to October), bird migrations (September to February) and bioluminescence in the intracoastal waterways (May to October).\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Why Go To Cocoa Beach\"\nNo. 20 — Everglades National Park\n“Florida is almost as famous for its alligators as it is for its beaches and theme parks, and one of the best places to see them is in Everglades National Park. As the largest subtropical wilderness in the country, the park is the world’s only environment where alligators and crocodiles coexist.\nIt’s also home to rare species like manatees and panthers. The Everglades offers several hiking trails and guided tours for navigating its vast 1.5 million acres. Be sure to visit between November and April (the park’s dry season) to enjoy lower temperatures, fewer mosquitos and increased chances of spotting wildlife.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Best Places to Visit in Florida for 2025\"\nNo. 19 — Fort Lauderdale\n\"To the citizens of Fort Lauderdale, their home offers quintessential Florida – beaches, palm trees, shopping and relaxation – without the see-and-be-seen attitude of the state’s other beachside cities. You can judge if they’re right, but certainly expect a different atmosphere than their close rival Miami Beach.\nFort Lauderdale’s wide stretches of white sand surpass those of its southern neighbor and, to some, are the best shores statewide. And when you consider its fantastic scenery, great dining options and range of things to do, Fort Lauderdale is also somewhat affordable compared to similar vacation spots. The “Venice of America,” nicknamed for its 165 miles of waterways and canals, is slowly but surely climbing the ranks of top beach destinations to the cheer of its residents.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Why Go To Fort Lauderdale\"\nNo. 18 — Tampa\n\"Tampa is having a moment. Not only is the city ranked as one of U.S. News & World Report’s Best Places to Live, it’s coming out of the shadows of its Floridian siblings and shining in the spotlight. Whether traveling with family, friends, for work, or on your own, there are plenty of ways to enjoy your time in Tampa. Free-fall into fun at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay or peek into the undersea world at The Florida Aquarium. There’s lots of history here, too. For example, Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders stopped here on their way to Cuba during the Spanish-American War. You’ll also find a few choice museums, including the Tampa Museum of Art and the Tampa Bay History Center.\nThen there are the sports. This is the home of the NFL’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the NHL’s Tampa Bay Lightning and the new Tampa Bay Sun FC women’s pro soccer team (kicking off in summer 2024). It’s the namesake city of the MLB’s Tampa Bay Rays team, and the spring training home base for several other major league teams. When you’ve exhausted all that Tampa has to offer, you can drive just 25 miles south to St. Petersburg for more art and some sophisticated dining, or west to Clearwater for its gorgeous sugar sand beach.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Why Go To Tampa\"\nNo. 17 — Marco Island\n\"The largest of Southwest Florida’s Ten Thousand Islands, Marco Island is a haven for water sports like boating, fishing and kayaking. Its sunny skies and white sand beaches invite visitors to sunbathe, swim and search for seashells.\nThose who want a break from the sand can learn about the island’s ties to the ancient Calusa Native Americans at the Marco Island Historical Museum or look for manatees, sea turtles and other wild animals in Ten Thousand Islands National Wildlife Refuge.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Best Places to Visit in Florida for 2025\"\nNo. 16 — Key Largo\n\"In Key Largo, relaxation is the name of the game. The closest of the Keys to mainland Florida, this laid-back haven is a swift departure from the party atmosphere of Key West. Here, vacationers seeking some rest and recuperation can spend their days picnicking on the beach, admiring resident manatees from the docks of their rental homes or taking a slow canal cruise on the African Queen.\nOutdoorsy types will be equally happy here, as the expansive, activity-filled wetlands of Everglades National Park are just a short drive away. Even closer is John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, where travelers can snorkel and scuba dive among a diverse underwater ecosystem. In fact, as the self-proclaimed “Dive Capital of the World,” Key Largo offers a number of intricate sites that attract divers year-round. But no matter how you choose to spend your days, it would be a shame not to end them with as many fresh lobster dinners and killer Key Largo sunsets as possible.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Why Go To Key Largo\"\nNo. 15 — St. Petersburg\n\"Holding the Guinness World Record for the most consecutive days of sunshine, St. Petersburg is appropriately nicknamed “The Sunshine City.” The city provides visitors with a unique blend of traditional beach getaway and urban flavor. The white, sandy beaches offer views of spectacular sunsets and the 137 parks invite travelers to enjoy a host of activities, including hiking, camping and kayaking. An ongoing creative renaissance also promises an extensive cultural experience, whether it’s through the world-class Dalí Museum or the Museum of Fine Arts.\nAnd every year, more than 1,000 events are held in the city – everything from St. Anthony’s Triathlon to Florida’s largest Pride celebration. With all that it has to offer, the sunshine-infused city is a popular destination for visitors all ages: families will love the relaxing outdoors and teeming wildlife, and the younger set will find plenty to do downtown, including the lively nightlife.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Why Go To St. Petersburg, FL\"\nNo. 14 — Clearwater Beach\n\"Clearwater Beach sits on a long, thin island off of Florida’s west coast within 25 miles of both St. Petersburg and Tampa. Though a trip to the town from the mainland takes just a few minutes, you’ll feel worlds away from the big-city atmosphere you’re leaving behind. This laid-back area is known for its beautiful coastline – U.S. News ranks Clearwater Beach as one of Florida’s best beaches – but you’ll also find a number of other attractions worth checking out.\nWhen you’re not at the beach paddle-boarding, riding Jet Skis or parasailing, among other water sports activities, take some time to enjoy Clearwater Beach’s historical theaters, parks, shopping districts and casual beachfront restaurants. You’ll also want to visit the Clearwater Marine Aquarium to see the attraction’s famous dolphin resident. If you love sports, no trip would be complete without watching the Philadelphia Phillies play at Spectrum Field during MLB’s spring training season.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Why Go To Clearwater Beach\"\nNo. 13 — Delray Beach\n\"Situated between Boca Raton and West Palm Beach on Florida’s southeast coast, Delray Beach lures travelers with its nearly 3 miles of pristine Atlantic Ocean shoreline. But this vibrant coastal city offers more than just top-notch surf and sand. At Wakodahatchee Wetlands, travelers can observe more than 175 species of birds in their natural habitat.\nMeanwhile, those looking for cultural enrichment will find it at the Pineapple Grove Arts District and the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens. But the crown jewel of Delray Beach is Atlantic Avenue, a bustling strip packed with restaurants, boutiques, cafes, art galleries and bars.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Best Places to Visit in Florida for 2025\"\nNo. 12 — Miami Beach\n\"Miami Beach is where a mix of cultures, residents and travelers mingle. A wide variety of people – including Instagram models, amateur architecture critics, distinguished seniors and sun-seeking families – enjoy the renowned shores of “the Beach,” as locals call it. North Beach is where you’ll find the kid-friendliest beaches, the tranquil greenspace of North Shore Oceanside Park, and the most affordable restaurants and hotels. Less than 10 miles away on the mainland are the galleries, museums and theaters of Greater Miami.\nAnd then there’s South Beach. This popular southernmost neighborhood proves that Miami Beach is more like two cities – a family-friendly vacation when the sun is shining and a super-chic metropolis come nightfall. If want to keep up with the Joneses, you’ll have to exercise your credit card at the high-end stores, indulge at the cutting-edge fusion restaurants, dance at the energetic nightclubs and relax poolside at the art deco-style hotels. But the rich and famous aren’t the only ones who will enjoy their time here. More laid-back travelers can relax along the sands of Lummus Park, learn a little more about architecture on an art deco tour or even try their hand at fishing off of the South Pointe Pier. Another must-do? Window-shopping and strolling along the Lincoln Road Mall. And you can’t leave Miami Beach without bottomless brunch or chowing down on tasty small plates and enjoying cocktails at a rooftop bar.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Why Go To Miami Beach\"\nNo. 11 — Destin\n“Nicknamed the “World’s Luckiest Fishing Village,” Destin has grown into one of the most popular vacation spots on the Florida Panhandle. Founded in the 1850s, Destin used to be a sleepy fishing town until a bridge connected the skinny peninsula with Florida’s mainland and Eglin Air Force Base opened in the mid-1930s. With a baseline population of 13,000 residents (which inflates to 25,000-plus during the summer), this town retains an intimate, friendly atmosphere. Midwestern and Southern families flock to Destin’s beaches each summer for the city’s trademark bright white sands, made up of pure Appalachian quartz.\nThis unique sand not only stays cool in the summer heat, but also gives the water its emerald tint as the sunlight bounces off the grains. Golfers traverse seaside bunkers, while kids splash in the water parks. More adventurous visitors snorkel and scuba dive off the coast or charter a boat to try their luck at deep sea fishing. After all, casting a line is an integral part of this peninsular paradise.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Why Go To Destin\"\nNo. 10 — Sanibel Island\n\"This secluded Fort Myers offshoot is considered even more low-key, quiet and quaint than its Gulf Coast neighbor, and that’s saying a lot. Casual is the order of the day on Sanibel Island; a shabby chic vibe permeates the Periwinkle Way galleries, restaurants and shops; seashells cover every sandy and linoleum surface. In fact, the abundant seashells have become this island’s (and its smaller sister, Captiva‘s) claim to fame. You’ll find plenty of beachcombers practicing the “Sanibel Stoop” – what locals call shelling – on any lengthy stretch of sand. Plan on joining them for at least one afternoon of your stay; that is, if the mood strikes you. The residents of laid-back Sanibel wouldn’t have it any other way.\nNote that Sanibel Island sustained significant damage in September 2022 as a result of Hurricane Ian. Though the island is still recovering and lodging is limited as of February 2024, many of its main beaches and a handful of local businesses and restaurants have reopened. For the most up-to-date information regarding the island’s recovery, visit the Sanibel & Captiva Islands Chamber of Commerce website.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Why Go To Sanibel Island\"\nNo. 9 — Dry Tortugas National Park\n\"Sitting about 70 miles off the coast of Key West, Dry Tortugas National Park is known for its premier snorkeling and wildlife-viewing opportunities. Home to nearly 300 species of birds, five types of sea turtles and about 30 species of coral, this remote seven-island park in the Gulf of Mexico is a popular Florida day trip destination for nature lovers.\nPlus, travelers can go on a self-guided tour of the 19th-century coastal fortress Fort Jefferson, located on Garden Key. Keep in mind, Dry Tortugas National Park can only be reached by boat or seaplane, and an entrance fee is required.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Best Places to Visit in Florida for 2025\"\nNo. 8 — Orlando\n\"There’s no other city in the United States – the world, even – that celebrates the spirit of childhood quite like Orlando, Florida. The feeling that you get when you catch the light off EPCOT’s Spaceship Earth (found in Walt Disney World Resort, of course); or from your first sip of Butterbeer in Hogsmeade or Diagon Alley (located inside Universal Orlando Resort); or when you witness the soaring heights of Shamu’s aerobatics (during the Orca Encounter water show at SeaWorld Orlando) – all prove that being a kid is about your state of mind, not age.\nThe notion that only young ones will enjoy this city’s charms is just that – a notion. In reality, Orlando has a little of this and a little of that to appeal to all ages and there’s more to do here than visit theme parks. The subtropical climate is great for golfing and the downtown city landscape is too attractive not to explore.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Why Go To Orlando\"\nNo. 7 — Key West\n\"Known for warm beaches and eccentric residents with a live-in-the-moment philosophy, Key West offers a relaxed yet unexpected seaside adventure. Do as the residents (known as Conchs) do and see where that free spirit might take you (possibly on a guided tour or a snorkeling trip). Perhaps you’ll end up at a Duval Street bar, in a Mallory Square shop or even touring Ernest Hemingway’s old home.\nKey West once threatened to go rogue (in 1982 with a mock secessionist movement to create “The Conch Republic”), so this is definitely the place to throw a firm itinerary out the window. Take a stroll, sip a margarita, spy a six-toed cat and set your own pace. While hurricanes have impacted the area in recent years, Key West remains open for business as a bustling vacation destination, with charming bed-and-breakfasts and plenty of outdoor pursuits to keep you busy.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Why Go To Key West\"\nNo. 6 — Amelia Island\n\"Pristine Appalachian quartz sand beaches surrounded by rolling dunes, live oak-lined streets draped with Spanish moss and a charming historic downtown are just several reasons to visit Amelia Island. The 13-mile-long, 2-mile-wide barrier island, situated approximately 35 miles northeast of Jacksonville, is Florida’s northernmost barrier island on the Atlantic Coast – and the southernmost in the Sea Island chain, which extends from South Carolina to Florida.\nThe island’s long and colorful history, which spans more than 4,000 years – and eight flags of dominion – dates back to the native Timucuan tribes living in southern Georgia and northern Florida and the European explorers who came to conquer the island, including the French, the Spanish and the British. There’s an extensive maritime and military history, and a rich African American heritage, with the founder of American Beach and Florida’s first Black millionaire, Abraham Lincoln (A.L.) Lewis. Known as The Isle of Eight Flags, Amelia Island also has legendary tales of Gilded Age robber barons, such as the Carnegies and the Rockefellers, who frequented the Palace Saloon (Florida’s oldest continuously operating drinking establishment) and pirates like Blackbeard, who sought refuge here. For spine-tingling thrills and chills, there are plenty of those too, with spooky encounters at one of the oldest cemeteries in Florida, Bosque Bello Cemetery, and some of the island’s historic sites and bed-and-breakfast establishments and inns.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Why Go To Amelia Island\"\nNo. 5 — Naples\n“Named after the coastal Italian city, Naples, Florida, is known for its laid-back ambiance, understated luxury, world-class golf – and pickleball. Though Florida’s version doesn’t have the history, sights or artwork of its Italian namesake, its extravagance mimics that of European watering holes along the Mediterranean. Instead of archaeological treasures and classical art, you’ll find high-end restaurants and first-class hotels.\nWith gently lapping waves on the white-sand beaches of southwest Florida’s Gulf Coast, America’s Napoli qualifies as one of the most relaxing and romantic beach destinations in the States. That said, party animals will probably want to seek other options, because Naples doesn’t have many of the distractions (oops, we mean attractions) they are looking for. Relaxation is the name of the game here, with ample opportunities to explore the natural wonders that make this part of Florida a top destination for ecotourism.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Why Go To Naples\"\nNo. 4 — St. Augustine\n\"No matter where you go in St. Augustine, odds are you’ll stand face to face with American history. Founded by the Spaniards in 1565, this town in northeastern Florida is the oldest continuously occupied European settlement in the U.S. Alongside narrow cobblestone streets and colonial architecture, you’ll find Romanesque Revival-style buildings, many of which were designed by railroad and oil tycoon Henry Flagler, who played a key role in developing St. Augustine and the rest of Florida’s east coast. With so much history, it should come as no surprise that St. Augustine also has a penchant for the paranormal: Many of the town’s top attractions, which are believed to be haunted by Spanish settlers and original inhabitants, tout nighttime ghost tours.\nThough the main draw here is the abundance of landmarks that date back to the Spanish occupation, the Ancient City also offers various boutiques, eateries, bed-and-breakfasts, live music venues and art galleries. Travelers with children should check out the St. Augustine Pirate & Treasure Museum and the St. Augustine Wild Reserve. Art enthusiasts will appreciate the Lightner Museum's eclectic collection, while shopaholics cannot pass up a chance to peruse the boutiques on St. George Street. And once you’re ready to relax, grab your gear and head to the beach. As with many coastal Florida towns, St. Augustine offers prime access to the Atlantic Ocean and year-round sunshine.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Why Go To St. Augustine\"\nNo. 3 — Anna Maria Island\n\"This tranquil barrier island roughly 35 miles south of St. Petersburg is the perfect place to recharge your batteries. Kick back on gorgeous white sand shorelines like Bean Point and Coquina Beach, and don snorkeling gear to swim among Anna Maria’s ample colorful fish.\nYou can also get out on the water on a dolphin-watching tour or fishing charter. After soaking up some sun, go shopping and grab a bite to eat along Pine Avenue, the island’s historic main street.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Best Places to Visit in Florida in 2025\"\nNo. 2 — Islamorada\n\"Made up of six islands in the Florida Keys – Plantation Key, Windley Key, Indian Key, Lignumvitae Key and Upper and Lower Matecumbe Keys – Islamorada boasts tranquil parks, colorful coral reefs and art galleries.\nThanks to its position between Florida Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, this laid-back coastal village is a renowned sport fishing destination, bringing in species like sailfish, marlin, mahi-mahi, tuna and tarpon. But if you don’t feel like casting a line, you can check out the History of Diving Museum or put a dent in your wallet at the shops in Rain Barrel Village.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Best Places to Visit in Florida in 2025\"\nNo. 1 — Siesta Key\n“Located on the Gulf Coast of Florida, just south of Sarasota and less than 70 miles south of Tampa, Siesta Key is a respite from the hurried world. This beach town is the perfect place to slow down and relax, to take your time to unwind and soak up the Florida sunshine. Best known for its dazzling white, powder soft sand beaches that are consistently ranked among the best in the U.S., and indeed the world, Siesta Key is a must-visit for beachgoers.\nEven in the heat of the summer, the sand stays cool because of its composition: 99% pure quartz. Aside from the long stretch of wide beaches, Siesta Key enjoys myriad dining options and plenty of outdoor activities, and is within close proximity to all of the arts and culture for which nearby Sarasota is known.\"\nU.S. News & World Report, \"Why Go To Siesta Key\"",
