  "body_text": "Approaching the anniversary of his return to the club this weekend, David Moyes feels “the year has looked like progression” and eyes a European return.\nMoyes, who had previously managed the Toffees for over a decade between 2002 and 2013, made his return to the club to replace Sean Dyche last January. Everton were just one point above the relegation zone back then and in dire need of change after the turbulence of recent seasons. They had collected just 17 points from their first 19 matches, but under Moyes, the club went on to finish a comfortable 13th after collecting 31 points in the remainder of the campaign.\nSince then, they’ve moved to their new waterfront home and are currently in 12th place, six points away from the top four. It’s been a difficult week for the club following a 4-2 loss against Brentford and a disappointing 1-1 draw with basement side Wolves, both at home.\nThe game against Wolves saw Michael Keane and Jack Grealish sent off, with the former decision still drawing the ire of the Everton boss, who called it “embarrassing” in the pre-match press conference before beginning their FA Cup campaign against Sunderland.\nHowever, the Everton boss remains optimistic about progress, despite struggling for form and missing several key players lately.\n“I hope that the year has looked like a progression,” says Moyes. “From avoiding relegation, moving to the stadium, winning big games. We started this season really well. We have been able to move into the middle batch at the moment. My dream is that we can be close enough at the end to challenge for a European spot.”\n“Look, it’s been a brilliant, brilliant year for me, you’ve got to say, I love the year coming back. I was anxious at the start because I was wondering: ‘How is this going to go?’\n“We actually lost 1-0 to Aston Villa in the opening game and I’m saying, my goodness, we’ve got to go, but I think since then it’s been great. I think the support personally I’ve had from the support with me coming back has been so good.\n“It’s helped me, but I think also I’ve come back with probably a bit more experience, but also with the knowledge that I’ve still got an idea what Everton was. I don’t think it was what I left, or what we left, and I kept getting told by different people, 'it’s not the same Everton and you’re not coming back to the same football club'.\n“So, my hope was to try and get it back on the road of the old Everton and maybe this year you would say we’re getting back onto the road where we need to be.\nSince Moyes returned for his second spell, only eight teams have won more Premier League points than the Blues. They had climbed to fifth in the league standings following the win over Nottingham Forest on December 6, their fourth win in five games.\nHowever, there have been several setbacks since. Everton have lost Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall to injury and are without Iliman Ndiaye and Idrissa Gana Gueye, who have left for AFCON. Since then, they’ve won only against Forest at City Ground and have drawn with Burnley and Wolves while losing to Chelsea, Arsenal and Brentford.\nMoyes, however, appreciates the support of the club’s fans, who have stuck by their team through thick and thin, especially after the topsy-turvy campaigns during the late stage of the Farhad Moshiri era.\n“If ever I’d had seen it, it would be West Ham, where we win a European trophy, and we finish in sixth, seventh, and a year where we finished 14th, and that would be it. So, supporters, I’m saying, is you’ve got to be careful where you go and what do you think is going to happen.\n“You support your club when they’re at the bottom. They’ve got amazing support, I remember when I wasn’t here, I was watching Everton and the support they had against Crystal Palace when they had to stay up, in games like that.\n“So, you support the team whatever position you’re in. But also you’ve got to remember if you’re looking for things too quick, it’s just not the business now where everything’s going to go absolutely great.\n“We’ve had some brilliant results. Our away results probably in the last 12 months have been amazing.\n“So, the away support are probably seeing even better than some of the home support. So, I generally think that football is a little bit like that at the moment, you can lose a couple of games and it can change very quickly.\n“But I’ve got to say, it’s been great coming back and it’s been terrific, the reception I’ve had. I think basically, the people in the know would say, we’re getting the club back in shape, getting it going, and in the main, done a pretty good job.”\nReader Comments (32)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Sort out an ageing defence, find a goalscorer and generally get more quality in the squad to get us challenging for Europe consistently.\nIf we qualify for Europe this season, with this squad, I'd say it would be overachieving.\nHe has got to be harassing the board for transfer funds, the Premier League is wide open and a couple of players could make all the difference between a mid to lower league finish or getting into Europe.\n7 Posted 09/01/2026 at 18:24:43\nLook where we were before Moyes came back, be careful what you wish for, look at where West Ham are... Says it all.\n8 Posted 09/01/2026 at 18:34:27\n9 Posted 09/01/2026 at 19:29:45\nJust seen on Sky that we had signed a right back… then realised it's the women's team!\n10 Posted 09/01/2026 at 21:02:23\n11 Posted 09/01/2026 at 22:05:17\nYes, I know, it's been days. No, I'm not letting it go. We were at home, to the worst team in the league.\nO'Brien is a good central defender. He's a rotten full-back, with limited ability and pace, and he kills the right-hand side every time he's played in that position.\nWe've zero fucking chance of progression as long as Everton fail to do the bare fucking minimum, of buying and/or utilising players for the full-back positions.\nThat performance and result was worse than the bruising defeats against Newcastle, Spurs and Brentford, and much harder to forgive. And it all came from the team selection and the gutless, flaccid performances spawned from it.\n12 Posted 10/01/2026 at 01:04:18\nAt one stage, Potts was top of our list and look how well he did at West Ham. Sometimes it's not always the best manager who gets results at a club, but someone who fits.\nI think we should go back to a system where the manager would go to the Director of Football Operations and say \"I need the best you can find world wide to fit these positions: left-back, right-back, striker, etc. They have to be under 25 and have no history of long term injuries.\"\nI think Moyes has been unlucky as well, coming back when we have had close to the worst strikers ever at this club. Having watched a lot of games, the amount of opportunities our strikers have missed -- I'm talking of open goal misses and one-on-ones -- has become a joke to the point where we are now starting to feel sorry for them.\nWhy at times it helps to make us look ordinary, due to our midfield and defense always being under pressure. Our forwards pose no real goal threat, so the opponent's defenders are always streaming forward under no pressure.\nThe key is a striker who can score regularly; there has never been a better time with the World Cup looming. Players are not just going to be happy being at a top club, they are going to be wanting game time to try and get into their country's national team for the World Cup.\nThis has to be Everton's main priority, to get one of these forwards. Even in this current squad, if we had a half-decent striker, we would be in a European place.\n13 Posted 10/01/2026 at 02:03:28\nMoyes has done his job and stabilised the club, but now we need a forward-thinking manager brought in. Someone with some tactical nous and the ability to motivate the players.\nNot a dinosaur stuck in the 80s with his tactical plan and defence first tactics.\nLet's not forget too, a lot of the players still at West Ham are Moyes's purchases.\n14 Posted 10/01/2026 at 07:09:48\nThey've been through three managers since as they spiraled into the relegation zone. Would they go back in time and reverse that decision? You bet they would. In about two hot minutes.\nAnnika #13, I expect Moyes will be eventually replaced by a \"forward-thinking manager\" but only when we have the players on board to move the club forward. We are nowhere near that standard now.\nUnless the wheels truly come off sometime next season, which I do not expect, I believe he will serve out his contract and keep delivering the stability his bosses currently crave.\n15 Posted 10/01/2026 at 09:02:35\nIf we buy wisely in the summer window, we may be able to achieve a European place. Only time will tell.\n16 Posted 10/01/2026 at 09:27:58\nI would still love to see a right-back come in in this window though. On loan if necessary.\n17 Posted 10/01/2026 at 09:38:46\nHe is an exception rather than rule, and highlights that finding top quality is a real challenge. Chelsea, Man Utd are in the market, Man City, Tottenham, Newcastle perhaps will be sooner or later. If I was Man Utd, I'd be in for him. He's a bit of an odd fish, but I think he is a better bet than Glasnser.\nBased on the clear pecking order of clubs, it highlights the odds are against Everton finding an Emery type to take us to the promised land.\nWe aren't a magical pull, and we are all chasing the same quality. That's the reality of elite competitive sport.\n18 Posted 10/01/2026 at 10:07:50\nIf O'Brien is a rotten right-back, which I agree with, how can he possibly be a good centre-back?\nI have my doubts about that; a good footballer would play a lot better than O'Brien does at full-back. Time will tell how good he is when or if he plays consistently in his preferred position.\n19 Posted 10/01/2026 at 10:08:38\nSo, until we get a right -back and a striker, there is not much we can do... just hope we get through January with no more injuries. Come On You Blues!!!\n20 Posted 10/01/2026 at 10:54:26\nAs I stated earlier, many of the players still at West Ham were brought in by Moyes.\nCheck out the West Ham fan sites and see what they think of Moyes. Not that supporters choose the manager. But he walked out because he refused to operate with a Director of Football.\nThe West Ham board, as bad as they are, would never choose to take him back.\nWhat you call 'stability', I call 'lack of ambition'. Because, no matter who we sign, Moyes will not change.\n21 Posted 10/01/2026 at 10:58:25\nWest Ham recorded their worst ever goals conceded in the Premier League. So yes, of course, they would want him back.\n22 Posted 10/01/2026 at 11:15:43\nWest Ham have done well since he left, haven't they!\n23 Posted 10/01/2026 at 11:16:28\nI just hope this doesn't catch on for any domestic cups or we really will be in financial trouble. Priorities, eh.\n24 Posted 10/01/2026 at 11:33:55\nI agree this just shows what a decent manager he is getting a far better tune out of them than any of his illustrious replacements.\n25 Posted 10/01/2026 at 11:39:08\n\"My dream is that we can be close enough at the end to challenge for a European spot.\"\nDreaming is not enough for a club with any level of ambition, the fans have more ambition than this manager. The current squad is only mid table quality, at best.\nWe are seeing some better games when we have a full squad, but the \"glass ceiling\" tag seems justified. Would David Moyes do better with a better squad? Probably, but I suspect we would still be seeing the same set up, the same predictable tactics, and the the same fan frustration.\nHoping for a cup win, Wrexham did Wales proud last night, COYB\n26 Posted 10/01/2026 at 12:24:33\nMaybe surprise us with some January signings. But I can't see it.\nEven if we did qualify for Europe, the squad needs some real beefing up. Not more of the same with the usual paper thin squad.\n27 Posted 10/01/2026 at 12:36:07\nI know some will say \"Ask West Ham fans what they think\", but bad running of a club like the Hammers doesn't mean we have to make the same mistakes.\nPersonally, I'd rip out any remnant of the Moyes era -- yes ex players that I love like Baines and Coleman -- and completely start with a new strategy.\nDon't just go, \"Let's bring in Glasner because he's doing well,\" but rather, \"If we bring in Glasner, what does he need to succeed?\"\nBecause my guess is he (and I'm only using him as an example) doesn't need the historic interference of David Moyes and his people. It's quite possible this is why Man Utd keep failing, because everything was there to work for Fergie.\nWhilst TFG might have brought stability, it feels like the same stability that Kenwright brought. People correctly criticise Moshiri but, whilst he didn't have a clue how to run a football club, he showed ambition and adventure. He was hampered badly by PSR and his own lack of patience with managers. (Or perhaps weakness against fan pressure?)\nHaving Moyes as manager is not ambitious, it is arguably the exact opposite because you know you can't win anything.\nSo I hope there is a genuine long-term plan, we have the next manager lined up but it'll take some time to get him because the club is putting in the structure to support them.\nEverything we see though suggests the structure is there to support Moyes, not the next manager.\n28 Posted 10/01/2026 at 15:24:21\nTo get into Europe, it meanings attacking, scoring goals, and beating teams bottom of the league at home (which you now failed to do twice).\nNot to mention so many home spankings.\n29 Posted 10/01/2026 at 17:24:37\nHe talks about 'the old Everton\" but he has no idea what it is.\nWhen I think fondly of \"the old Everton\" I have in mind a trophy-winning team for whom 2nd place was not good enough. Let's get to that and stop harping on about mediocrity.\n30 Posted 10/01/2026 at 20:59:28\nBoring cunt... I always hated Moyes!\nHe'll never change his boring \"play it safe\" ways!!\n31 Posted 16/01/2026 at 08:36:03\n32 Posted 16/01/2026 at 10:18:52\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
