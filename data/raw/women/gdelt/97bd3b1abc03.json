  "body_text": "What shape are Lionesses in for 2025?\n- Published\nIt is another significant year for England as they look to defend their European title in Switzerland in July - so what shape are they in?\nAs well as Euro 2025, Sarina Wiegman's side must navigate a tough Women's Nations League campaign.\nWith plenty to play for, BBC Sport takes a look at how the Lionesses ended 2024 and what is encouraging heading into the new year.\nEuro 2025 group games - BBC TV schedule confirmed\n- Published20 December 2024\nHow to watch and follow 2024-25 WSL season on the BBC\n- Published26 December 2024\nWhat to look out for in the WSL transfer window\n- Published1 January 2025\nPatchy form and growing pressure\nWiegman's first year in charge could not have gone any better with England wrapping up the Euro 2022 title.\nA first Finalissima trophy followed, before her side navigated injuries to reach the Women's World Cup final in 2023.\nExpectations were high and pressure increased last year as a result but England's form left much to be desired.\nHaving failed to qualify for the Olympic Games, the Lionesses stumbled through Euro 2025 qualification with unconvincing performances against Sweden and France.\nA period of experimentation followed as Wiegman switched formations and rotated her players, which meant results were patchy.\nMidfielder Georgia Stanway admitted they had \"things to work on\" following their defeat by Germany in October, but they were not panicking.\n\"As a whole, I don't think we need to be disappointed too much,\" she said. \"We have a long process to be right for the Euros.\n\"This is a step in the direction - whether it's a good one or a bad one. It's a way that we can learn.\"\nThe Lionesses ended the year with seven wins in 12 matches, but there were improvements in their goalless draw with Olympic champions, the United States.\nWiegman and her players are under pressure to deliver this year, having ended 2024 with more questions than answers.\nA lengthy injury list\nA major factor in England's inconsistency is a growing number of injuries in the squad.\nAs they plan the defence of their European crown, Wiegman must prepare without several key players at the start of 2025.\nManchester City defender Alex Greenwood underwent knee surgery in December and is likely to be out for several months, while club team-mate Lauren Hemp missed the last two international matches of the year having undergone similar treatment.\nAsked about losing forward Hemp, who has created the most chances and picked up the most assists in the WSL this season, Wiegman said: \"She was in such a good place and was playing so well, so it's of course disappointing.\n\"On the other hand, I would say it's better that if something happens, it's now rather than in the spring and she can be back to her level again.\"\nChelsea forward Lauren James has not played for England since last April, Manchester United midfielder Ella Toone picked up a calf injury in November and Brighton's Fran Kirby had the same issue in December.\nThe good news, however, is that Chelsea full-back Niamh Charles has returned from a dislocated shoulder and captain Leah Williamson is starting to find her feet again after returning from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee injury.\nFuture is bright as talent comes through\nDespite the unconvincing performances in 2024 and injury concerns, there is a strong pathway of talent coming through for England.\nWiegman will have been encouraged by the performances of several youngsters who took their chance in recent friendlies.\nManchester United's Grace Clinton shone in the December victory over Switzerland, while Manchester City's Jess Park did well in the game before that against the USA.\nFormer England striker Ian Wright was among those calling for Clinton, 21, to push for a place at Euro 2025, adding: \"Grace is more than ready for this level. I would like to see her play more.\"\nThere were also debuts for Jess Naz, Laura Blindkilde Brown and Ruby Mace, who all progressed from England's Under-23s in 2024.\nDefender Maya le Tissier played a key role in Manchester United keeping seven clean sheets in the WSL and has improved her position within the England ranks.\nMeanwhile, Chelsea forward Aggie Beever-Jones continues to progress at club level and is a useful option, despite struggling for game time under Wiegman.\nThey have to 'believe in themselves' at Euro 2025\nDespite criticism of the Lionesses last year, there is still plenty of optimism as they build up to Euro 2025.\nEngland have reached back-to-back major tournament finals under Wiegman and are ranked fourth in the world.\nThey have been drawn in a tough group with France, the Netherlands and Wales - but have beaten the two higher-ranked sides within the last 12 months.\n\"The group is tough. The women's game is developing so quickly so I don't think there are easy things any more,\" said Wiegman after the Euros draw in December.\n\"We just have to be ready. Straight away, you have to be at the top level when you go into the tournament and that will make us really sharp.\"\nThey will face stiff competition to succeed from world champions Spain - who they will face in the Women's Nations League - while record European winners Germany beat the Lionesses at Wembley in October.\nBut England have shown when they are fit and firing, they are one of the best teams in the world and will fancy their chances in Switzerland.\n\"If anything they should recognise that they are the ones to be feared,\" said former England defender Anita Asante.\n\"They are the holders, they have done it, they know what it takes to do it. [They need to] go out there and believe in themselves.\"",
