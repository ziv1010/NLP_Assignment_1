  "body_text": "BBC pay 2024-2025: The full list of star salaries\nThe BBC has published the salaries of its highest-paid stars as part of its annual report.\nEx-Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker, who departed in May after apologising for reposting a social media post about Zionism that included an illustration considered antisemitic, was again the corporation's top earner in the region of £1,350,000 - £1,354,999 - the same amount as the previous year.\nHe is followed by former Radio 2 breakfast host Zoe Ball, who also left her BBC Radio 2 breakfast show in December - three quarters of the way through the financial year meaning her salary is lower than last year - but having already earned approximately £515,000 - £519,999. In May, she began hosting a Saturday show on the same station.\nMatch of the Day pundit Alan Shearer, in third place, took home £440,000 - £444,999, while in fourth, Radio 1 presenter Greg James received £425,000 - £429,999. Joint fifth on the list are Question Time host Fiona Bruce and the Today programme's Nick Robinson who both earned £410,000 - £414,999. The wages of all four increased year-on-year.\nSome famous BBC faces such as Rylan Clark, Claudia Winkleman, David Mitchell and Rob Brydon don't make the list as the BBC does not have to disclose the salaries of stars who are paid through production companies like BBC Studios , which is classed as a commercial entity.\nHere are the list of presenters who earned more than £178,000, according to the BBC's accounts.\nThe ▼, ▲ and ➤ icons show whether their salary has moved up, down or remained the same. A ★ icon represents a presenter making a new appearance or re-entry onto the list.\n➤ Gary Lineker - £1,350,000 - £1,354,999\nMatch of the Day, Premier League, FA Cup, Sports Personality of the Year\n2023/2024: £1,350,000-£1,354,999\n2022/2023: £1,350,000-£1,354,999\n2021/2022: £1,350,000-£1,354,999\n▼Zoe Ball - £515,000 - £519,999\nRadio 2's Zoe Ball Breakfast Show\n2023/2024: £950,000-£954,999\n2022/2023: £980,000-£984,999\n2021/2022: £980,000-£984,999\n▲Alan Shearer - £440,000 - £444,999\nMatch of the Day: Premier League, FA Cup\n2023/2024: £380,000-£384,999\n2022/2023: £445,000-£449,999\n2021/2022: £450,000-£454,999\n▲Greg James - £425,000 - £429,999\nRadio 1 Breakfast Show\n2023/2024: £415,000-£419,999\n2022/2023: £395,000- £399,999\n2021/2022: £390,000-£394,999\n▲Fiona Bruce - £410,000 - £414,999\nQuestion Time and presenting on BBC One\n2023/2024: £405,000 - £409,000\n2022/2023: £395,000-£399,999\n2021/2022: £410,000-£414,999\n▲Nick Robinson - £410,000 - £414,999\nRadio 4's Today programme, Radio 4's Political Thinking podcast\n2023/2024: £345,000 - £349,000\n2022/2023: £275,000 - £279,999\n2021/2022: £270,000-£274,999\n➤Stephen Nolan - £405,000 - £409,999\nThe Nolan Show on Radio Ulster, Nolan Live on BBC One (Northern Ireland), The Stephen Nolan Show on 5 Live\n2023/2024: £405,000-£409,999\n2022/2023: £400,000-£404,999\n2021/2022: £415,000-£419,999\n▲Laura Kuenssberg - £395,000 - £399,999\nSunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Newcast podcast and UK General Election coverage\n2023/2024: £325,000 - £329,999\n2022/2023: £305,000 - £309,999\n2021/2022: £260,000-£264,999\n▲Vernon Kay - £390,000 - £394,999\nRadio 2 mid-morning show, Radio 2's Dance Sounds of the 90s\n2023/2024: £320,000 - £324,999\n▲Justin Webb - £365,000 - £369,999\nRadio 4's Today programme, Americast podcast\n2023/2024: £320,000 – 324,999\n2022/2023: £280,000 - £284,999\n2021/2022: £255,000-£259,999\n▲Scott Mills - £355,000 - £359,999\nRadio 2 early afternoon show and now breakfast show, plus Pop Top 10 on BBC Sounds and other appearances.\n2023/2024: £315,000 - £319,999\n2022/2023: £300,000 - £304,999\n2021/2022: £400,000-£404,999\n▲Naga Munchetty - £355,000 - £359,999\nBBC Breakfast, Radio 5 Live's Naga Munchetty Programme, UK general election\n2023/2024: £345,000 - £349,999\n2022/2023: £335,000 - £339,999\n2021/2022: £365,000-£369,999\n▲Sophie Raworth - £350,000 - £354,999\nBBC News at Six, BBC News at Ten.
