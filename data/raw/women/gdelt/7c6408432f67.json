  "body_text": "The Athletic reported last week that investors are interested in purchasing a minority stake in Chelsea Women and the club’s co-owners Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital are prepared to consider proposals.\nChelsea value their seven-time Women’s Super League champions, who added a seventh WSL title under departing manager Emma Hayes on Saturday, on equal footing with Angel City.\nAdvertisement\nThis year, the National Women’s Super League (NWSL) franchise based in Los Angeles was valued at $180million (£143m) by sports business website Sportico. It has been interpreted that Chelsea could target an investment that would value their women’s side at $200m.\nBut is that an accurate valuation? And how much would clubs such as Arsenal, Liverpool or Manchester United be worth in comparison?\n“In terms of any potential Chelsea sale, that asking price does appear high,” says football finance expert Kieran Maguire.\n“All the clubs in WSL are losing money so, under normal circumstances, you don’t tend to be looking at a wide suite of investors or necessarily high prices.”\nThe WSL is moving in a positive direction, but clubs are still chasing profitability. In the Deloitte Football Money League (DFML) report – which ranked the revenues generated by women’s clubs in Europe for the financial year covering the 2022-23 season – seven of the 15 richest women’s clubs in Europe are from the WSL.\nOne important thing to note is Deloitte’s ranking was focused on clubs in European leagues including England, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Portugal, and for teams who made information available. The revenue of clubs in countries such as Australia, Japan, Norway, Sweden and the United States was not handed over to Deloitte. Clubs from these countries might have made the top 15 had the information been available.\nBarcelona came out on top with Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea all making the top six.\nRevenues at European women’s clubs are on the up, with the average revenue generated by the top 15 clubs in 2022-23 standing at €4.3million (£3.7m; $4.7m). This was a 65 per cent increase in the average revenues of these clubs in 2021-22 (€2.6m).\nThe DFML said women’s football globally will generate €500m in 2024, which shows the position of growth and direction the game continues to move in. Interestingly, the revenue generated by Chelsea as a football club and announced for the 2022-23 season in turnover was £512.5m. This acted as a guiding figure when Chelsea were sold two years ago.\nAdvertisement\n“One of the most common ways to value a club is to take the total revenue generated by the club and then look to see how other clubs have been sold in terms of the multiple of revenue. For example, when Chelsea were sold to Todd Boehly (and Clearlake Capital in May 2022), they had a revenue of £500million. They were sold for £2.5billion so the multiplier there was five. With Manchester United, it was probably closer to seven when Sir Jim Ratcliffe made his investment.”\nThe bulk of Chelsea Women’s €4million revenue for the 2022-23 season comprised of broadcast revenue (€1.9m), half of which is attributed to them reaching the Champions League semi-finals. The club also held three Champions League matches at Stamford Bridge and had more than 38,000 fans turn up for their 3-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur in November 2022, helping money made from matchdays add up to a third of their total revenue (€1.3m). Their commercial takings stood at €800,000, a figure that could rise after the club struck deals with dairy brand Lindahls and car manufacturer Skoda over the past nine months.\nMaguire explains: “Looking at Chelsea Women, their most recent revenue was just under £9million so if the asking price is $200million, you’re looking at a revenue multiplier of around 22. That is very unusual for a mature business but it could be argued that Chelsea are in the position of a start-up. It’s the environment where people try to measure the club’s value on what they think the revenues might be in five years.\n“If Chelsea’s asking price is deemed to be realistic — and we only find that out if there’s a willing buyer — it indicates the club is anticipating those revenues of £9million being as high as £50million by the time we get to the end of the decade. That would be a sign of substantial growth.”\nMore on Emma Hayes, the incoming USWNT head coach…\n- A serial winner and a coach with unfinished business in the U.S.\n- Self-preservation, poetry and a manager under the microscope like never before\n- Dear Emma… with love, your sisters\nRevenues will increase by playing at Stamford Bridge more often, continuing to attract major commercial deals as a single entity and reaching the latter stages of the Champions League. The money generated by Arsenal Women, for example, rose by 138 per cent year-on-year. A lot of this is down to the success and turnout of games they hosted at the Emirates.\nAdvertisement\nOf the €5.3million in total revenue, Arsenal made €3.1million in revenues associated with matchdays in 2022-23. Following the off-field success of the 2023-24 season, they will play the majority of their home fixtures at the Emirates next season.\nWhat about other WSL clubs and their worth? As mentioned, seven of the 15 clubs in the DFML report are from the WSL yet there is a huge disparity between those at the top and those at the bottom.\nThe combined revenue (€7.3m) of the five women’s clubs ranked from 11th to 15th in the DFML, which includes Liverpool, Everton and West Ham United, is just over half of Barcelona’s total revenue.\n“Arsenal have been breaking attendance records, so we could see a repeat of the rapid financial growth in the men’s game (if other clubs seek or are open to similar investment opportunities). But you wouldn’t expect a 20-times revenue multiplier for the women’s teams at Bristol City or Brighton teams because their fanbases don’t really have the same upward trajectory.”\nDan Plumley is a senior lecturer in sport finance at Sheffield Hallam University and says we are a few years off being able to work out “robust valuations” for WSL clubs.\n“Even given the expansion of the game, it’s difficult to get exact figures on what teams are worth,” Plumley says. “With any business, there’s always assumption based in the valuation.\n“Some women’s teams don’t provide full financial data yet, but if you want to value a club, you’re looking at revenue, at assets in terms of stadiums and facilities they own, you’re looking at the equity in the club that is linked to the owners, and then you’re looking at all things relating to the fanbase and the potential to generate future revenue.\n“With some women’s teams, we don’t know the full financial data so it’s tricky to put an exact figure on them.”\nAdvertisement\nWill our valuations be more accurate in five years? And what could WSL clubs be worth then given the rate of growth?\n“The values will grow and that will allow us to do some deeper valuation techniques and put some hard numbers behind them,” Plumley says.\n“At the moment, that $200m Chelsea figure is high, but that goes back to the point about it being really difficult to measure.”\nJennifer Haskel is an expert in sports business and works for Deloitte. She agrees it is difficult to put a direct number on it. One of Deloitte’s predictions when aggregating global data was that we would see an English club with a valuation of more than $100million — not as high as Sportico’s figure for Angel City, but significant nonetheless.\n“That will hold true with some clubs across the WSL,” Haskel says. “When you benchmark it to some of the expansion fees across different leagues in North America, a $100m mark is feasible. I don’t think that’s setting the bar too high.\n“We’ll start to see more of that number and, hopefully, watch it climb as we learn how the process works when it comes to investing in that kind of joint entity (a team affiliated with a men’s team).”\nOne key factor will be NewCo, which will independently run the professional women’s game in England next season. The WSL and second-tier Women’s Championship had been run by the FA since they took their existing formats in 2010 and 2014 but from 2024-25, will be led by NewCo, which is expected to place a renewed focus on the commercialisation of the WSL.\n“It’s going to continue to grow past that $100million mark,” Haskel continues. “With the implementation of NewCo this summer, we’ll start to understand how much more revenue will be generated centrally, and how much more distribution will come from central revenue on broadcast and commercial deals.\nAdvertisement\n“How NewCo implements its strategy for the next couple of years will be an important factor. If we start seeing $100million valuations, that number could climb in the next five years.”\nPlumley says the growth of the game in England and future valuations will be led by commercial, broadcasting and matchday revenue success in the next few years. And just as Chelsea are using Angel City as a financial guiding light, the WSL can use the NWSL similarly.\n“The success of the U.S. is linked to the broadcasting deal being six times higher than the WSL one,” he says. “That is also linked to the leveraging, the profile and the celebrity influencers, as well as the investment proposition for different people to get involved in a sport that has real potential.\n“We’ll probably see further investment (in WSL clubs) — but crucially, that will be tied to future revenue growth.”\nIn April, Sky Sports and the BBC extended their broadcast deals with the WSL by a further season. The two UK broadcasters last signed a three-year contract with the WSL before the 2021-22 season, which was due to conclude at the end of the 2023-24 season.\nSky will show up to 44 WSL matches in 2023-24 and the BBC has the rights to 22 games — the same numbers as the previous agreement, which The Athletic reported was worth an estimated £7million per year. This is the first broadcast rights deal since NewCo was formed. In January, NewCo chief executive Nikki Doucet confirmed the format of the WSL and Women’s Championship will remain the same.\n“The past three years have been exciting for the women’s game — each broadcaster’s coverage of the WSL has helped take the game to another level and open it up to new audiences, and we’re looking forward to seeing that continue and momentum build as we move into a standalone entity,” Doucet said in April. She says there is now a focus on the next phase of development and growth for the elite women’s game in England that could see it become the global leader for women’s football.\nAdvertisement\n“If more money comes into the sport through TV deals and commercial partnerships, that then gets passed on to the clubs and raises the valuation of the club and their finances. It will also raise the appeal to investors.\n“Nobody would argue that women’s football is not an attractive investment proposition.”\n(Top photo: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images)",
