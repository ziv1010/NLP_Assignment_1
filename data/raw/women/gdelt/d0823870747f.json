  "body_text": "Artist Eleanor Tomlinson sends Lionesses signed prints of her work honouring their amazing football achievements\nAll members of the England women’s national football squad who reached the World Cup 2023 final have been included in the gesture\nEast Yorkshire artist Eleanor Tomlinson, whose Queen and Paddington sketch went viral after the late Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations, felt she “had to do something” to mark the achievements of the England women’s national football team in the World Cup 2023.\nAlthough she admits to not knowing a lot about the sport herself, Eleanor said she felt compelled to capture the spirit of the Lionesses, who reached the final of the World Cup last month but were beaten by Spain. With her trusty watercolours to hand – Eleanor does not go anywhere without them – and too early to check into a hotel room in Northern Ireland where she was attending a friend’s wedding at the time, Eleanor set to as the final kicked off on Sunday, August 20.\nShe was outside in the hotel gardens, watching the match unfold on her phone, as Eleanor, based near South Cave, began creating the artwork. It shows the 11-woman squad, their reflections being 11 actual lionesses, with the wording: “A lioness does not need to roar to keep the crowd in awe …”\nRead more:\n- East Yorkshire artist described as 'new Beatrix Potter' as she opens first permanent gallery at London's O2\n- Lioness legend backs campaign that helps more girls kick football in urban spaces\nThis week, Eleanor packed up a bundle of the first signed limited edition prints that have been made from the watercolour and that were always in reserve for each of the Lionesses – and their manager Sarina Wiegman – before other customers could get their hands on one. She tweeted: “After a few emails we can finally send the first bundle of signed limited edition prints we’d reserved for each member of #TheLionesses team, including their manager. A little momento hopefully of a very successful and inspiring summer.”\nEleanor said: “The amount of discussions I had with so many friends, customers and family about the team and how they had done an amazing job unifying everyone, I thought, was something that needed to be marked.\n“I felt at that point, even if they don’t win, they have done so much more for everybody, uniting them, capturing the imaginations of so many.” Eleanor spent a few hours concentrating on the details she needed, including the kit, players’ features and their boot colours, before posting an image of the painting which, she said, was “really popular”. “There were requests to do a print, which I said I would do, but the first ones were going to be sent to the team and the manager.\n“I needed to find out the best way to get them there, as they must receive so much fan post. There were about 25 in the parcel that was sent yesterday, which I think will cover everybody; I decided they could argue among themselves who gets print number one.”\nEleanor, whose springboard for her career in art was designing a Christmas card for the local charity, Osprey, 12 years ago, has been busy of late creating her new Christmas collection – appropriately titled The Twelve Years of Christmas – and she has some new ideas and collaborations in the pipeline. One of the pieces she has revealed is a charity fundraising piece to support Elodie's Wish, this Christmas.\nThe appeal is to help a little East Yorkshire girl, Elodie, who was born with a severe brain injury. With the help of Eleanor’s “A Yorkshire Nativity”, 15 per cent from card and print sales will be donated to Elodie’s Wish, and 100 per cent raised from the original artwork sale will be donated too.",
