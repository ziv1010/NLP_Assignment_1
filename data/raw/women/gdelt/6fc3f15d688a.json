Here's everything you need to know about the former footballer\nThe countdown is almost complete as Strictly Come Dancing prepares to make its grand return for its 23rd series this weekend.\nFifteen fresh celebrities are ready to step into the iconic ballroom for their debut, where they'll be matched with their professional dancing partners.\nThis year's cast includes EastEnders actress Balvinder Sopal, Lorraine star Ross King, Gladiators favourite Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and Neighbours legend Stefan Dennis.\nThe fourteenth famous face to be announced as part of the series was Lioness legend Karen Carney.\nOn joining Strictly, Karen said in a statement: \"It really is a dream come true to be a part of this year's Strictly Come Dancing line up. I'm such a huge fan of the show and I can't believe I'm finally getting the chance to take part. I'm so excited to meet everyone and get dancing.\"\nAhead of the new series kicking off tomorrow (Saturday, September 20), here's everything you need to know about Karen, reports Coventry Live.\nHow old is Karen Carney?\nKaren is 38 years old, and is from Birmingham. She was born in Hall Green and attended St Ambrose Barlow Catholic Primary School and St. Peter's RC Secondary School in Solihull.\nWhen asked about her Midlands roots back in 2019, she said: \"I'm from Birmingham. My mum works at Sainsbury's, my dad is a fire-fighter. We keep it real. We know who we are. I don't need a Bentley, I don't need a Rolex.\"\nKaren graduated with a Bachelor of Science Degree from Loughborough University in Sports and Exercise Science, with a specialisation in Physiology and Sports Psychology.\nWhat is Karen Carney best known for?\nKaren is a former footballer who played for Chelsea, Arsenal, Birmingham City and England, and is now the lead female pundit for both men's and women's football, across TNT Sport and ITV.\nWith 144 caps, Karen is England's third most-capped player, competing at four World Cups, four European Championships and the London Olympics, before retiring in 2019.\nShe has since secured a name for herself as a trailblazer in the advancement of women in sport. In 2022, Karen began leading a landmark government review with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, into the 'Future of Women's Football' in the UK, which was successfully backed by the government in 2023.\nKaren made history at the men's World Cup in 2022 as part of the first all-female line-up to analyse a men's football game. She has since led the ITV coverage of the men's Euros, as well as the Lionesses' historic Euros wins in 2022 and 2025.\nThe star was awarded an MBE in 2017, and an OBE in 2024, for services to association football.\nThat's not all, as Karen also co-hosts the Long Story Short podcast with fellow England alumni and best friend Jill Scott, which is a hilarious and nostalgic deep dive into the stories of their friendship through their football years and beyond.\nDoes Karen Carney have dance experience?\nKaren has said that she did \"a little bit of hip-hop\" as a youngster, but her only dance experience was in nightclubs, where she did breakdancing.\n\"I think the breakdancing was when we used to go out on nights out with the team and I was forced into dancing-off with other people in the nightclub,\" she recently told the BBC.\n\"I've definitely never done Latin or ballroom or any of the dances that we're going to do, so it's certainly a new challenge for me but I'm up for it, it's so much fun.\"\nKaren also explained that she doesn't see the show as a competition, but instead looks at her co-stars as her \"teammates\".\nShe added: \"Everyone's got their own journey. None of us are pro dancers, we're all feeling and facing the same challenges and [we've] just got to be there for each other.\"\nStrictly Come Dancing returns to BBC One at 6.40pm on Saturday, September 20",
