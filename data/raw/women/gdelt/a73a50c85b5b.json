  "body_text": "The Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) final at the Olympic Stadium in Rabat on Saturday is a chance at redemption for both the Super Falcons of Nigeria and the Atlas Lionesses of Morocco.\nFor the host nation, it is an opportunity to improve on their second-place finish at the last edition, where they lost to South Africa in the final.\nFor Nigeria, however, it presents the chance to clinch the 10th continental title or ‘Mission X’ and inflict revenge on a Morocco side that defeated them on penalties in the semi-final of the previous edition of the competition.\nThe Super Falcons, and indeed Nigerian fans, have not forgotten the loss that halted the country’s title defence in front of a hostile home crowd at the 2022 WAFCON.\nAdvertisement\nThere were complaints of Moroccan fans distracting Nigerian players with lasers throughout the match and during the penalty shootout. The referee also handed Nigeria two red cards in a game that was marked by intense tension.\nWith these in mind, it is set to be a grudge final in which Morocco seeks to announce itself as a force in women’s football on the continent, while Nigeria seeks to assert its dominance.\nWHAT HAS CHANGED IN THE NIGERIAN TEAM SINCE WAFCON 2022 SEMI-FINAL?\nAdvertisement\nRandy Waldrum made way for Justin Madugu, who has brought about a gradual shift in the team’s mentality. While Waldrum mostly positioned the Falcons as underdogs, Madugu has taken a quiet approach as he rebuilds the team game by game.\nThe Falcons’ squad at the ongoing WAFCON includes 14 new faces compared to the 2022 roster, placing less emphasis on individual qualities and more on the team as a whole, a machine working together.\nThe squad is younger and stronger, with one more player from the local league. Madugu has achieved a compelling blend of youthful exuberance with experience, utilising Asisat Oshoala and Francisca Ordega more on the bench.\nHe has also prioritised selecting players who fit into the game plan regardless of public outcry, and all these have contributed to the Falcons’ march into the WAFCON final.\nAdvertisement\nHOW HAVE THE MOROCCANS PERFORMED AT CURRENT WAFCON?\nThe Atlas Lionesses have been unconvincing in their run to the WAFCON final.\nThey conceded the opening goal in their first two matches of the group stage and needed a late goal to salvage a 2-2 draw against a Zambia side Nigeria walloped 5-0.\nThey also conceded twice against a DR Congo team that finished WAFCON without any points, boasting only those two goals as evidence of their participation.\nAdvertisement\nThe quarter-final victory over Mali was their best game, and Ghana’s profligacy was the primary reason that the Atlas Lionesses escaped the semi-final on penalties.\nHowever, they have Jorge Vilda, a coach who won the Women’s World Cup with Spain, and his tactics have helped Morocco dominate midfield.\nAdvertisement\nAlso, with Ghizlane Chebbak, the striker who is the joint-top goalscorer in the tournament with four goals, they still pose a major threat when given the opportunity.\nHOW CAN NIGERIA WIN THE FINAL?\nAdvertisement\nThe Super Falcons have been the best side in the tournament and are deservedly in the final. However, a repeat of the team’s poor midfield display against South Africa in the semi-final could derail “Mission X” because it is an area where Morocco is most solid.\nBut a defence that has conceded just once from penalty, and none from open play, is capable of stopping Morocco, especially if Osinachi Ohale puts the horrendous semi-final performance behind her.\nAdvertisement\nElsewhere, Rasheedat Ajibade, captain and arguably the player of the tournament, has been the perfect leader. The former Atletico Madrid forward has been involved in the majority of Falcons’ attacking play at the tournament, and she has relished her role as the link between the lines, sprinting with the ball, making key passes and providing assists. The team should play to her strengths to get the ball past Morocco’s midfield and create goalscoring opportunities for the combative forwards who have been a nightmare for defenders with their constant movement.\nMadugu-led tactical masterclass saw the Falcons dismantle Zambia in the quarter-final for the team’s best match of the tournament. Zambia’s poor marking from deep crosses and free kicks was exploited efficiently, and it is hoped that he can exploit Morocco’s shaky defence and error-prone goalkeeper to silence the expected capacity home crowd to complete Mission X.\nWHAT ACHIEVING MISSION X MEANS FOR FALCONS’ CONTINENTAL LEGACY?\nNigeria has an enviable WAFCON record that no nation can match in decades, and completing ‘Mission X’ would serve as a reminder that the Falcons remain the benchmark for any African nation seeking to build its female football team.\nNigeria has not failed to win the WAFCON in consecutive tournaments, and a defeat to Morocco would demystify the Falcons’ chokehold on female football in Africa. Everything is on the line for the Super Falcons, and only victory can secure the legacy.",
