Just be brave, play our football.\n\"Football is a funny sport. You can be the best team and lose so we were always more focused on just having a positive performance. When you do that, you get rewards and the ladies got that today. I'm really pleased for them.\"\nEarlier on Saturday in Manchester, Geyse, Leah Galton and Grace Clinton scored as Hammers, who only won three matches last season, made a worrying start.\nOnly one team is relegated, and newly-promoted Crystal Palace are the favourites to go down, but West Ham are at risk.\nDefending champions Chelsea began with a 1-0 win over Aston Villa on Friday - with the injured Matildas skipper Sam Kerr in the crowd.\nOn Sunday their biggest rivals, Arsenal and Manchester City, meet at the Emirates with five Australian internationals likely to feature - Caitlin Foord, Steph Catley, Kyra Cooney-Cross (all Arsenal) Mary Fowler and Alanna Kennedy (City).\nAustralian Associated Press",
