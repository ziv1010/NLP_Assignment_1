Mounting evidence of deep-state corruption and cover-ups demands an answer.The Federalist’s blockbuster exclusive on Tuesday revealed U.S. Attorney David Weiss was spoonfed The New York Times’ false narrative that the Pittsburgh U.S. attorney had pushed the Delaware office to investigate Rudy Giuliani’s claims of Biden family corruption. That revelation adds new texture to the IRS whistleblowers’ earlier testimony. More importantly, it suggests a select few DOJ and FBI agents buried the FD-1023 sent to Delaware for further investigation — a report memorializing a “highly credible” FBI confidential human source’s claims that Burisma paid $5... -\nOver half of Americans believe they've interacted and communicated with a deceased loved one: study\nOver half of Americans claim to have communicated with deceased relatives either in dreams or other means — and the “moderately” religious are the most likely people group to say they've had such a supernatural encounter.

Weiner, a disgraced former Democrat congressman and New York City mayoral candidate, was jailed for “sexting” with a 15-year-old girl from North Carolina. In September 2016, claims were published that Weiner had engaged in sexting with an underage girl. Devices owned by Weiner were seized as part of an investigation into this incident. The report prompted a criminal investigation and Weiner’s laptop was seized. Emails that were pertinent to the... -\nTo Christian leaders: We are not celebrities\nWithout question, one of the hardest jobs is being a Christian leader, especially a pastor. Close friends leave you, others betray you, social media slams you, the world hates you, and demonic forces rally against you and your marriage. This is why thousands exit the ministry each year.We are also often stretched financially, relationally, emotionally, and physically all while living in a fishbowl for the world to see. Pastors’ wives feel it as well and they are often the unsung heroes in this battle.Popularity won’t fix the problem To deal with the stress of ministry, we sometimes believe that popularity... -\nGermany: Migrants Skirt Local Polygamy Laws, Import Second Wives\nTolerance™ and Diversity™, among other things, require that Western governments subvert their own laws — which of course still apply to locals — in order to accommodate the polygamy that is practiced rampantly throughout the Islamic world.Via Remix News (emphasis added):Afghan nationals who worked with the German army during the military operation in the country have had requests to bring their second wives and children to Germany approved, a move that is posing complex legal problems.Afghan employees of the Bundeswehr were granted visas to reside in Germany following the military withdrawal from Afghanistan, and family reunification laws enabled the employees... -\nThe mayor of Tijuana needs a history lesson: A stunt with a piece of the Berlin Wall shows stunning ignorance of history.\nWho remembers the Berlin Wall and why it went up? Who remembers that East German guards shot men and women trying to jump the fence? I remember. Unfortunately, the mayor of Tijuana, Mexico played the wall card and chose the wrong wall to talk about.This is the story:Tijuana's mayor took a jab at US migrant policies by recently installing a 3-ton gray concrete slab of the Berlin Wall just feet from America's latest stretch of border wall.\"May this be a lesson to build a society that knocks down walls and builds bridges,\" reads the inscription on the Cold War relic... -\nHarris on Trump charges: ‘I believe that people should be held accountable under the law’\nVice President Harris on Wednesday said people should be held accountable for efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election when questioned on the charges against former President Trump. “Let the evidence, the facts, take it where it may,” Harris said in an interview with The Associated Press in Jakarta, Indonesia. “I spent the majority of my career as a prosecutor,” she added. “I believe that people should be held accountable under the law. And when they break the law, there should be accountability.” Harris was interviewed while representing the U.S. at a summit of the Association of Southeast... -\nOklahoma State Rep Demands Investigation Into ATF Swat Raid on Constituent’s Home\nOklahoma state Rep. Justin Humphrey (R-Lane) sent a letter to the Oklahoma Attorney General, the Sheriff of Pushmataha County, Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt and “All Oklahoma judicial authorities and other law enforcement entities,” requesting an investigation into ATF’s SWAT team raid at the home of his constituent, Russell Fincher. According to a press release, Humphrey said he was contacted by Fincher after a dozen ATF SWAT team members bearing “automatic weapons” raided Fincher’s home, handcuffed him on his porch in front of his 13-year-old son and coerced him into relinquishing his Federal Firearm License. “If this report is true, and... -\nColorado's Shedeur Sanders Received Three-Word Message From Tom Brady After Upsetting TCU\nThe entire football world watched Shedeur Sanders and the Colorado Buffaloes upset the Horned Frogs of TCU last Saturday afternoon. Even the GOAT, Tom Brady, tuned in. Brady was so impressed with the Buffaloes' victory that he personally reached out to Shedeur, Deion's son and Colorado's starting quarterback.

Don’t Let Them\nPetty Covid Tyrants Want To Bring Back Masks And Lockdowns. Don’t Let ThemThe new mask mandates will not be about science or data or public health. They’ll be about the raw exercise of power, nothing more.A day after First Lady Jill Biden tested positive for Covid with mild symptoms, the White House announced that President Joe Biden will once again be wearing a mask indoors and will only remove it “when sufficiently distanced from others.”The news comes as health officials in major urban centers, including New York City and Los Angeles, are urging Americans to wear masks again, citing a... -\nDemocrats have to dump Joe Biden as their 2024 nominee — prez, policies wildly unpopular with the people\nThe calendar says summer is ending, vacations are over and it’s time to get back to work. If you’re a Democrat, it’s also time to get serious about dumping Joe Biden as your 2024 nominee. It’s been eons since the president has enjoyed even decent poll numbers, but amid a glut of bad ones, last week’s Wall Street Journal survey stands out. With only minor exceptions, it shows Biden and his policies, especially on inflation and the economy, are wildly unpopular and that the vast majority of all registered voters do not want him to seek re-election. Instead, they want... -\nProposed J.D. Vance Bill Will Ban Federal Mask Mandates\nSen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) said Tuesday he will introduce legislation dubbed the “Freedom to Breathe Act” which will effectively ban federal mask mandates. The act would prohibit President Joe Biden and federal agencies from implementing face mask requirements requiring submission from public transit passengers or students in schools. “The bill, if passed into law, would prevent the reimposition of federal mask mandates in the United States — particularly in public schools and on airplanes and public transportation systems. It would only apply through the end of 2024. -\nBidenomics 101 (Hand To Mouth): 61% Of Americans Living Paycheck To Paycheck With Unsustainable Debt Levels, Up 19.4% Under Biden (50,000 U.S. Stores Likely To Close By End Of 2027)\nBidenomics is forcing Americans to live hand to mouth. Or as Lou Chrisite sang, “Lightning Strikes …. Americans” leaving them worse off under Bidenomics. The cost of living has been soaring, and our standard of living has been steadily going down. Coping with inflation is tough for American households where consumer debt is up 19.$ under Biden while the free-spending Federal government’s public debt is up only 16.5%. As a result, over 60 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck at this point, and debt levels are rising to unprecedented levels. Now, 78% of consumers earning less than $50,000... -\nWednesday War Room, 10-noon & 5-7pmET\nPM 4Liberty, if you want On/Off this listhttps://pluto.tv/live-tv/americas-voicehttps://americasvoice.news/Tune in via Roku/AppleTV/AmazonFire with the America’s Voice App https://americasvoice.appLIVE STREAM all Bannon shows & find past episodes here: https://rumble.com/c/BannonsWarRoom | https://americasvoice.news/playlists/the-war-room/ -\nClass required to wear masks after COVID outbreak in Montgomery Co. school\nStudents and staff in one class at a public school in Montgomery County, Maryland, are being told that they must wear masks for the next 10 days after three “or more” people tested positive for COVID-19.

Bush is shot down during World War II\nWhile off the Japanese island of Chichijima on this day in history on Sept. 2, 1944, then-future President George H.W. Bush was the only survivor after his aircraft was shot down by enemy fire, according to the National WWII Museum in New Orleans, Louisiana. At the time, Lt.

Bush’s squadron was conducting a bombing mission when it encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire, according... -\nWOW: Editor OUTS Biden in d***ing thread for 'Mosaic Plagiarism' in article he submitted on civil rights\nJust. Wow. We've heard so much about Joe Biden's plagiarism during his time in law school, but seeing it in a thread from someone who personally witnessed it? All sorts of WOW. Check this out. My first assignment as a junior editor at the Harvard Journal on Legislation (1999-2000) was to cite check an article submitted by one Sen. Joseph R. Biden. I was shocked by the plagiarism I discovered. 🧵 https://t.co/0CSqJBZR7E — Roger Severino (@RogerSeverino_) September 4, 2023 Shocked by the plagiarism he found. Oh keep going, it gets better. Worse?

But he'll do so without directly naming Donald Trump in what's being called a \"major\" speech at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College. Campaign advisers told reporters on a preview call Tuesday that the speech was not directed at one candidate in particular, such as Trump or biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, whom Pence has recently hammered over a slate of... -\n‘Nightmare Scenario’: Kayleigh McEnany Says ‘Biden Is Angry’ Over 2024 Election, Won’t ‘Leave On His Own’\nFormer Trump administration press secretary Kayleigh McEnany argued on “Jesse Watters Primetime” that President Joe Biden is not well-perceived by the public which could stunt his 2024 election chances. McEnany claimed that Biden’s “nightmare scenario” was revealed in a recent Wall Street Journal poll which poured cold water on his reelection hopes. McEnany said that 40% of the poll’s respondents claim they would “definitely” vote for Trump if he is the nominee, while only 39% say the same about Biden. Although the polling numbers place the likely nominees in a dead heat, McEnany argues that Trump’s base will be more...\nBrowse by Forum\nGet Connected! Join Free Republic Today!\nAlready a Member?
