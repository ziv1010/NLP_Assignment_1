  "body_text": "AN ERA ENDS: Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has died aged 100, after a titanic and at times divisive diplomatic career that gave him a hand in policies on Vietnam, Israel, Chile, China and the Soviet Union. POLITICO’s David Cohen has written an obituary here.\nGood Thursday morning. This is Dan Bloom.\nDRIVING THE DAY\nBACK ON TELLY: Let’s hope Matt Hancock has swapped his diet of sheep’s vagina for a hearty Weetabix. The former health secretary starts two days of evidence at 10 a.m. as — like a TV cop drama — the COVID Inquiry moves into its blockbuster final weeks before Christmas.\nThe context: We’ve already heard oodles from Hancock, be it his hagiographic “Pandemic Diaries” … the 100,000 texts handed by its author to the Telegraph … his evidence to a previous stage of the inquiry … questions about his affair on I’m a Celebrity … or being knocked about on Celebrity SAS. Doubtless some will roll eyes at the attention on a whipless backbencher. But his crucial role in 2020, and the lightning rod he has become for officials, combine to make this a big moment.\n**A message from Mastercard: Small businesses deserve access to resources which match their ambition. Mastercard’s Strive UK programme has helped over a million businesses access the tools, support, and insights they need to thrive. Find out more about how Strive UK is enabling British entrepreneurs to succeed in today’s digital economy.**\nWHIPPING BOY: Hancock must now answer the Murder on the Orient Express-style procession of senior figures who’ve done him in. Greatest hits include Dominic Cummings calling him a “proven liar” … Helen MacNamara saying he’d say things in meetings that “we’d discover [weren’t] in fact the case” … Patrick Vallance saying he had a “habit” of saying things “without evidence to back them up” … Mark Sedwill texting that he needed removing to “save lives and protect the NHS” … Simon Case name-checking him in the government’s “weak team” … Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham saying Hancock knew Tier 3 restrictions wouldn’t work when he imposed them … Simon Stevens saying he wanted to decide “who should live and who should die” … and Chris Wormald saying he “overpromised” (but not that he lied). Thanks to Playbook’s Noah Keate for the round-up.\nOh, and ask Hancock about: His May 2020 comment that “right from the start, we’ve tried to throw a protective ring around our care homes.” The inquiry heard on Wednesday that medical chief Jenny Harries emailed a health department official two months earlier saying: “I believe the reality will be that we will need to discharge Covid-19 positive patients into residential care settings.” Email here.\nOn the other hand: Former NHS chief Simon Stevens said “I don’t think I’ve seen evidence” Hancock was untruthful … Cabinet colleague Michael Gove expressed his “high opinion” … and Dominic Cummings claimed ex-PM Boris Johnson wanted Hancock in place as a “sacrifice for the inquiry.” Which sounds prescient.\nWhat Hancock might use in defense: Perhaps he’ll point to the fact Stevens and Wormald, who are much less harsh, worked more closely with him than his critics in No. 10. Or he might repeat the various things his “allies” have briefed to newspapers, like arguing he’s “brazenly” being made No. 10’s scapegoat (the Times) or saying he called for a COBRA meeting in late January 2020 (the Observer).\nLook out too … for anything about contact from bra tycoon Michelle Mone, after some dogged Guardian reporting and Hancock’s claims about her email in his book.\nCOMING ATTRACTIONS: The inquiry will publish next week’s timetable just before 10 a.m. and it’s a biggie — Boris Johnson is expected to give evidence next Wednesday and Thursday, as the Mirror’s John Stevens reported. Playbook hears Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is penciled in for Monday 11 December, though we’ll only find out for sure in a week.\nHousekeeping note: Questions today will be dominated by Counsel to the Inquiry Hugo Keith, as other groups come at the end. Hancock’s witness statement should be published on Friday night.\nFurther reading: Statements totalling 294 pages from witnesses Dominic Raab, Jenny Harries and Sajid Javid are all now online — there must be some big lines in there somewhere.\nGREEN COP\nWHEELS UP: Rishi Sunak is expected to fly tonight to Dubai, where the COP28 U.N. climate summit is getting underway. Many of the 70,000 delegates from nearly 200 countries have already arrived, my colleague Charlie Cooper emails to say, and nations are poised to seal a deal on a “loss and damage” fund on the first day.\nBut first: The leaders’ summit is only on Friday, so the PM is on a visit in Surrey and recording a pool clip mid-morning, before returning to No. 10 for unspecified meetings and calls. He’ll switch on the Downing Street Christmas lights with his wife Akshata Murty in the early evening.\nADVANCE PARTY: Foreign Secretary David Cameron is arriving at COP today from an OSCE summit in North Macedonia, where he decided not to meet Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Also flying in today is climate activist and *checks notes* king, Charles III.\nTwo amigos: Chaz and Cam will meet clean tech entrepreneurs, students and female leaders on the risks of climate change to women and girls, before the king — whose big speech is on Friday morning — schmoozes UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan at an evening reception.\nWhat a plane: There’s plenty of backlash to the fact Cameron, Charles and Sunak are all coming in separate jets. No. 10 rebuffed criticism, telling hacks “we are not anti-flying” but will invest in making it less dirty. Climate campaigners are spitting tacks, via the Independent.\nYep, that’s the line: Food Minister Mark Spencer told LBC’s Andrew Marr: “I accept the sort of hypocrisy, if you like, in global leaders flying to one location to solve this challenge. But of course, we do need those global leaders to get together to cooperate.”\nNot another one! Transport Secretary Mark Harper, who took a world-first “sustainable aviation fuel” flight to New York this week, is meeting Lime, Uber and self-driving car firms in San Francisco today … before coming home on a distinctly non-SAF flight and then jetting to COP next week.\nCOP A LOAD OF THIS: My colleague Suzanne Lynch has fired up an essential Global Playbook from COP28 to keep you briefed on the summit. She says attendees include Hillary Clinton, Bill Gates, Stella McCartney, Emmanuel Macron, Narendra Modi and Pedro Sánchez … but the leaders of the U.S., China, Russia, Canada and Australia are all giving it a miss, as is Pope Francis, due to health reasons.\nPOLICY ROW IN A NUTSHELL: Your author is old enough to remember ex-COP President Alok Sharma literally crying after “phasing out” fossil fuels was weakened to “phasing down” coal in 2021. The debate about language is back at COP28, says Charlie, this time relating to *all* fossil fuels. The U.K.’s formal position is — like the EU — to back a “phase out of unabated fossil fuels” (ie. fossil fuels where there’s no carbon capture canceling them out).\nBut but but … Three weeks ago, Net-Zero Minister Graham Stuart muddied the waters by telling MPs “we should focus on phasing down, phasing out — whatever it does, as long as it translates into real action.” Will the formal position hold up in the negotiating room?\nEXCUSES IN EARLY: COP President Sultan al-Jaber came out fighting against reports that the UAE plans to use its role to push fossil fuel deals. He told a press conference: “These allegations are false, not true, incorrect, and are not accurate.” Someone tell this guy what tautology is.\nTIME TO ‘STEP UP’: Mark Carney, the U.N. special envoy for climate finance and action, has thrown down the gauntlet ahead of the summit. Speaking on this week’s Power Play podcast, Carney says: “What we’ll be looking for at COP is who steps up amongst the oil and gas companies and commits to not doing something in the distant future, but doing something over the next few years.” He tells POLITICO’s Anne McElvoy, “We’ll start to judge who’s performing and who isn’t.” Listen here.\nAS FOR LABOUR: Leader Keir Starmer is setting off to COP this morning (on a commercial flight) and will have meetings on Friday and Saturday alongside frontbenchers David Lammy and Ed Miliband.\nDON’T TELL ATTENBOROUGH: Weak Whitehall coordination has affected the delivery of the government’s £500 million “Blue Planet” fund, an Independent Commission for Aid Impact review found … and the Guardian splashes on a study that found air pollution from using fossil fuels accounts for 5.1 million global avoidable deaths per year.\nGOOD TIMING: Stats on the number of energy efficiency upgrades to social housing and wider domestic homes, solar panels, smart meters, and the boiler upgrade scheme are all out at 9.30 a.m.\nSUELLA’S (ATTEMPTED) REVENGE\nLAST NIGHT AT THE SPECTATOR: MPs, SpAds, hacks and power-hungry Labour aides enjoying their first time filled a five-star hotel ballroom in Holborn for Tory bible the Spectator’s annual awards. Over beef Wellington and Pol Roger champagne, they witnessed (not for the first time) a fun-sized distillation of the warring egos of the Conservative Party.\nWhat everyone was talking about: Disrupter of the Year Suella Braverman could not suppress her grin as she walked on to I Predict a Riot. The sacked home secretary said she’d won the title over the Supreme Court, the ECHR … and “for disrupting my plans to cut the numbers and deliver a manifesto pledge — the prime minister.”\nThe only problem … was her drive-by landed worse than a wet thud, with audible suckings of breath and not one laugh. “That’s her leadership hopes gone in 2 mins,” one of her many detractors texted Playbook gleefully. Said another: “I would say she bombed but you have to take off first.” One attendee called it as “avant-garde” … another described it using only wincing noises … and a Cabinet minister said simply: “Pathetic. Pathetic.”\nThe upside: It’s proof she’s not part of the Establishment.\nDispensing the jokes … was Sajid Javid, who peaked with a barb about David Cameron’s lucrative private work overseas: “I still remember the first words you said to me when I walked into your office — Nǐ hǎo!”\nTop gong: The titular Parliamentarian of the Year went to Harriet Harman, who said she wanted to stand down years ago before “Jeremy Corbyn turned the Labour Party into what James Cleverly said,” (a sh*thole). Lobby hacks giggled at her solemn description of the Trappist silence she and the privileges committee kept during their Partygate probe.\nMore jokes: Politician to Watch Wes Streeting assured left-wingers he won’t sell the NHS — er, because “after 13 years of Conservative government, no one’s actually prepared to buy it” … Rising Star and Sunak ultra Claire Coutinho said “Rishi just wanted someone to make him look taller” … and Comeback of the Year David Cameron complained via video link that the Lords is too crowded: “Which idiot put so many Lib Dems in here?”\nAlways ready to serve: Survivor of the Year was Michael Green, swiftly corrected on-screen to his alter ego Grant Shapps. “Oh, he’s prepared a speech,” yawned one guest loudly. He gave it anyway. Full winners and speeches here and spotted list below.\nTHE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM … was the looming UAE-backed bid for the hosting mag and fellow Tory outlet the Telegraph. Spectator Editor Fraser Nelson walked on to the music from Lawrence of Arabia and joked next year the title may be so rich it can “afford Boris Johnson as a guest of honor.”\nRow rumbles on: Today’s Spectator takes a giant swipe at Investment Minister Dominic Johnson’s relaxed attitude to the deal (in a POLITICO interview) and says it should be rejected without “cast-iron assurance” of editorial freedom. The Mail (whose owner has a rival bid) gives a big write-up to 18 Tory MPs’ letter raising concerns. There was still no word overnight on whether Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer will intervene; if she does, it could come with little warning as an oral statement to parliament.\nPICK HIM INSTEAD? The i’s Arj Singh reports mischievous speculation on whether Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick, who’s leaned into right-wing rhetoric, will run for leader. “He’s had a hair cut, he’s lost some weight, people are wondering what he’s up to,” says one MP. The Times has a similar big read on how Jenrick’s “star has risen” on the right.\nTODAY IN WESTMINSTER\nMUSICAL CHAIRS! Former Health Secretary Steve Barclay last year gutted his ninth floor office — scene of the Matt Hancock snog — to create “a flexible co-working space” with a “coffee breakout zone.” He prioritized the fifth floor as a “control center” and moved to the first, with ministers working open-plan alongside other staff. But Playbook hears his successor Victoria Atkins has now … drumroll … moved back to the ninth floor after all.\nReminder: A previous round of refurbishment — revealed by a Labour PQ and meeting minutes — cost up to £140,000. Silver lining: A DHSC official stresses there’s no building work this time …\nSPEEDY DING-DONG: MPs will vote on all stages of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s sped-up National Insurance cut this afternoon after four hours’ debate. Hunt has a Times op-ed saying Labour is “fundamentally dishonest” to back the cut at the same time as its £28 billion green plan … while Labour retorts: “The chancellor is either being dishonest, economically illiterate or both.”\nTESTING PATIENCE: British diplomats fear Rwanda’s support for its migration deal wearing thin as deportation flights fail to get off the ground, says the Times splash.\nThis won’t help: At the same time, EU officials have privately contacted their U.K. counterparts urging Britain not to backtrack on the ECHR or U.N. Refugee Convention, Bloomberg reports.\nMeanwhile, in legal migration: A plan by then-Health Secretary Steve Barclay to ban foreign care workers bringing dependents to the U.K. was blocked by other departments, reports the Telegraph’s Charles Hymas.\nBAD NEWS? NHS stats are out at 9.30 a.m. on the number of doctors and nurses, GP appointments and sickness absences.\nGOOD NEWS! The FT has picked up on updated ONS figures “quietly released in a spreadsheet last month” that show U.K. unemployment fell to 3.5 percent in spring — matching a low seen just once since the 1970s.\nSTAT DUMP THURSDAY: Annual figures on the number of apprenticeships and affordable housing supply are out at 9.30 a.m. — plus more regular data on statutory homelessness and bus fares.\nBETTER TOGETHER: Liam Conlon, who happens to be the son of Labour Chief of Staff Sue Gray, was selected on Wednesday night as candidate for Beckenham and Penge by eight votes. The long-time activist edged out Melanie Ward, an ex-colleague of David Miliband who heads Medical Aid for Palestinians. Selections-watcher Michael Crick has tallies here and claims Conlon clinched it through postals and online.\nGRANTED: A task force of seven ships will mount patrols from next month between the English Channel and the Baltic Sea to protect undersea cables, the MOD announces today. The BBC has more details.\nWHAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO TALK ABOUT: Eleven tech firms including Amazon, Google and YouTube will sign an Online Fraud Charter aimed at tackling scams and fake ads — via PA.\nBREJOIN? Reaction to EU bigwig Ursula von der Leyen’s Brexit reversal hope at the POLITICO 28 awards makes a big hit, with the Telegraph and Yorkshire Post putting it on page one. The Sun’s leader warns ominously that between this and “David Stronger In Cameron,” “just wait until Nigel Farage hears about this when he gets out of the jungle …”\nGIVE HIM PINTS OF WINE: After a long delay, champagne and wine will be sold in pints within months — according to what appears to be a ministerial write-round obtained by the Sun’s Harry Cole and Ryan Sabey. It says a consultation is “imminent.” Brexiteer Churchill fans rejoice!\nIN THE RED FIELD: Shadow Environment Secretary Steve Reed will today say he’d get pylons built quicker for farmers needing grid access (via the Guardian) and admits “we became too detached” from their concerns. A Labour spokesman says of his 11.45 a.m. speech to the Country Land and Business Association Conference: “Our road to a majority runs through these seats. This is us parking our tanks on Tory fields.”\nIN THE BLUE FIELD: Environment Secretary Steve Barclay — who’s promising to back farmers in a speech at the same conference this morning — says it’s “hypocritical political opportunism” as Labour will “concrete over their green belt to make space for urban sprawl.”\nBIDEN’S SECRET WEAPON: After crashing Britain, will Liz Truss save the world? The ex-PM’s trip to persuade U.S. Republicans to support Ukraine is backed by U.K. officials, who believe she can speak more directly than the government, write my colleagues Eleni Courea and Esther Webber. Truss’s group has more meetings today — here’s their family holiday snap from Capitol Hill.\nRUH-ROH: The Data Protection and Digital Information Bill passed its final Commons stages on Wednesday night, despite a warning it could let the government snoop on pensioners’ bank accounts (via PA). Tory MP David Davis isn’t happy.\nA&E IN A&E: The Mirror splashes on its own look at CQC reports into A&Es, saying 107 out of 197 “failed to meet basic standards.”\nDROPPED THE BALL: Policing Minister Chris Philp did not declare football tickets believed to be worth over £6,000 because of an “administrative oversight,” reports the Times’ Aubrey Allegretti.\nMILLSTONE: The i splashes on a story by Hugo Gye casting doubt on the long-term future of the pensions triple lock — which the OECD said is harming the nation’s finances.\nIF BORIS CAN DO IT: The Telegraph has an op-ed by Indian PM Narendra Modi beating the drum for his nation’s role as G20 chair.\nSW1 EVENTS: Reform hosts a roundtable with 2019 Tory manifesto co-author Rachel Wolf at 9.45 a.m. … and the Institute for Government hosts a discussion on improving public service productivity including senior Treasury official Cat Little at 6 p.m.\nHOUSE OF COMMONS: Sits from 9.30 a.m. with business and trade questions … Commons leader Penny Mordaunt’s business statement … and the second reading and remaining stages of the National Insurance Contributions (Reduction In Rates) Bill. Labour MP Mohammad Yasin has the adjournment debate on conditions at HM Prison Bedford.\nWESTMINSTER HALL: Debates from 1.30 p.m. on topics including the work of the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (led by Tory MP Maria Miller) … and pupils with allergies in schools (led by DUP MP Jim Shannon).\nOn Committee corridor: Transport Minister Huw Merriman and HS2 Executive Chair Jon Thompson give a progress update to the Transport Committee (2.30 p.m.)\nHOUSE OF LORDS: Sits from 11 a.m. with the introduction of unaffiliated peer Sue Carr followed by oral questions on battery and hydrogen powered aircraft and leasehold reform … then the main business is a debate on the 75th anniversary of the NHS, a short debate on removing free prescriptions for benefit claimants who refuse to look for work and a debate on early years education.\n**POLITICO Pro Financial Services UK is coming in early 2024!

The task — In Too Deep — required unscrewing bolts with a spanner underwater. Though unfazed by various sea creatures, it proved too much, forcing Farage to utter the show’s title.\nLicking wounds: Farage was glum on his return, saying he felt “quite a heavy sense of failure” and he’d “let the camp down.” Bushtucker trial partner Nick Pickard off Hollyoaks won six stars for campers nonetheless …\nOnce more with feeling: Farage’s remaining time on screen was used to continue debating cultural appropriation with YouTuber Nella Rose and complaining about the camp’s cleanliness with maître d’ Fred Sirieix.\nVideo evidence: After an apparent spoiler by Farage’s allies to the Express, Byline Times has now published a 2021 Cameo video branded “racist” and “homophobic” by its recipient. Farage’s team told the Express “he would not have made” the video-to-order if he’d known the script had an “obscure offensive word.”\nBEYOND THE M25\nCOME IN FROM THE COLD: Councils around the country have activated their cold weather plans for homeless people, including London’s City Hall, Liverpool and East Suffolk. Glasgow is expected to declare a housing emergency as the number of homeless refugees doubles — the Guardian has more.\nBLAME ROBIN HOOD: Nottingham City Council will hold a meeting of all councilors within three weeks after declaring itself effectively bankrupt — via the Telegraph. Sky’s Jennifer Scott has a helpful explainer on why it’s the seventh bankrupt council since 2018.\nBUILD BRIDGES: Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen and his Labour opponent Chris McEwan have both pledged to save Middlesbrough’s Tees Transporter Bridge, closed since 2019 — via TeesideLive.\nBREAKING UP THE UNION: Two unnamed SNP politicians had an extramarital affair said to have continued during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite lockdown rules — the Scottish Daily Express has the exclusive.\nUS VS. INDIA: U.S. federal prosecutors accused an unnamed Indian government official of orchestrating a plot to kill a Sikh activist in New York — the story splashes the FT.\nISRAEL-HAMAS LATEST: Israel and Hamas agreed to extend the cease-fire in Gaza in a last-minute agreement that came just as the truce was due to expire. The pause in fighting will be extended for a day, according to Reuters. A second British warship is on its way to the Gulf from Gibraltar (more via the BBC) as 16 more hostages in Gaza were freed, and Israel freed another 30 Palestinian prisoners (BBC).\n**A message from Mastercard: Small businesses are the backbone of the economy.
