Another historic moment. Thank you, Gooners.”\nArsenal held the previous WSL attendance record, with 59,042 fans present when they beat champions and London rivals Chelsea in December.\nSaturday’s match also broke the corresponding record, already held by Arsenal, for a women’s club game in England of 60,063 that watched the Gunners’ European Champions League tie against German club Wolfsburg at the Emirates last season.\nThe win on Saturday left them third in the table, three points behind both leaders Chelsea and second-placed Manchester City.",
