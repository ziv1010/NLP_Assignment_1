  "body_text": "Why time is right for resilient 'Mini Messi' Kirby to end England career\n- Published\nFran Kirby's international career epitomised what resilience, combined with serious talent, can accomplish.\nDespite countless setbacks on and off the pitch, Kirby enjoyed a successful 11-year England career- picking up 77 caps and a European Championship winner‘s medal along the way.\nThe 31-year-old midfielder announced her decision to retire from international football an hour after England's defeat by Spain on Tuesday, and just days after goalkeeper Mary Earps had done the same.\nBut while Earps' retirement stunned England supporters, with many questioning the timing and the potential disruption it would cause, Kirby's announcement made more sense.\nEarps had fallen down the pecking order but was set to be number two to Hannah Hampton at Euro 2025 - which kicks off in four weeks - but Kirby had been told by manager Sarina Wiegman she was not going to make the squad.\nThat ultimately made Kirby's decision an easy one. She had done all she could and her time was up.\nWhat led to the decision?\nKirby's talent has never been questioned.\nShe will go down as one of England's greatest servants and one of the most unique players we have ever seen in the women's game.\nHad it not been for a series of lengthy injuries and illnessess, Kirby would undoubtedly have made a century of international appearances.\nKnee and ankle issues began in 2017, then two years later she needed treatment for pericarditis - an inflammation of the fluid-filled sac around the heart - which was potentially career-ending.\nShe took time out as she struggled with fatigue in the build-up to Euro 2022, while another knee injury, that required surgery, forced her to miss the 2023 World Cup.\nMinor issues became more frequent after that. Having missed February's Nations League games, she was called up to the squad for the double-header against Belgium in April, only to have to sit out the first game.\nHer fitness concerns no doubt played a part in Wiegman's decision not to take her to Switzerland and Kirby knew that was her last opportunity to play in another major tournament.\nThey had \"honest conversations\" last month and when the reality became clear, Kirby's decision was made.\n\"She's an amazing player and an incredible person too. She did everything to make the squad,\" said Wiegman.\n\"She has always, when she was in [camp], been ready to play and to perform, helping others and doing whatever I asked her to do.\n\"There is a time, I guess, you stop. She has to get used to that. I am really proud of her and grateful I got to work with her.\"\n'Mini Messi' who 'lit up the stage'\nKirby is a generational talent who has played a major role in the growth of women's football in England, as well as the success of the national team.\nShe became the first player from WSL 2 to be called up to England's senior squad in 2014 and impressed at the World Cup a year later, earning the nickname ’Mini Messi‘ from former boss Mark Sampson.\nPlaying as both an attacking midfielder and a wide forward, Kirby has entertained with trickery, creativity and unpredictability.\nHer experience shone through in 2022 as she started all six games during England's success, complementing the youthful talent breaking through.\n\"I love working with her. Her touch, her positioning, her vision, her game-understanding and her connections,\" said Wiegman.\n\"She has had an incredible career and it is still going on in the Women's Super League. I am really proud of her and grateful I got to work with her.\"\nKirby's ability to turn a game on its head and produce a moment of magic is what led to her nickname.\nFormer England manager Phil Neville said after a friendly win over Brazil in 2018 that he would \"take my number 10 over Brazil's\" when comparing Kirby's impact on the game to six-time World Player of the Year Marta's.\nAnd while she has been on the fringes of the England squad in recent times, she could always be relied upon to do the job being asked of her.\n\"I remember 10 years ago she got the nickname and rightly so, because she just lit up the stage in an England shirt,\" said defender Lucy Bronze.\n\"I think all the players who now play for England probably dreamed of playing with Fran Kirby one day. She was that good.\"\n'She can hold her head up high'\nKirby's achievements with England are carved in history - she was a key part of the squad that won the Lionesses first major trophy.\nBut it is how she has dealt with personal tragedy and setbacks that makes her success even more admirable.\nWiegman's glowing pride at Kirby's career was clear to see on Tuesday and Bronze said it was \"unbelievable\" what the former Chelsea midfielder had overcome.\n\"She has had lots of ups and downs but she can hold her head up really high for what she has achieved,\" England's record goalscorer Ellen White told the Women's Football Weekly podcast.\n\"I just thank her for what she has done for England and football. I have incredible memories.\"\nKirby quit football as a teenager after suffering from depression following the death of her mother when she was just 14.\nShe spoke about her grief in 2019, external in a piece for the Players Tribune, weeks before she helped England reach the World Cup semi-final.\nThe University of Winchester acknowledged her work raising awareness of mental health by rewarding her an honourary degree later that year.\nSerious illness followed and she had further doubts about her career, but bounced back again for Euro 2022.\nLast year, she spoke out about body image issues in the women's game and the impact of social media abuse.\nAnd even after her latest knee injury, she left Chelsea following a nine-year stint to join Brighton and ended the season as the club's player of the year.\n\"Just remember you can,\" were the words Kirby used in her statement to announce her retirement, a fitting last reminder of her resilience.",
