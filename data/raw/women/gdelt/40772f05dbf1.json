something the companies behind them reject.\nIn 2024, the MoD scrapped a planned Fortnite collaboration called Operation: Belong but insisted it wasn't being used to recruit people.\nCampaign group ForcesWatch, which raises concerns about the ethics of recruitment, tells Newsbeat \"armed forces are increasingly occupying an important leisure space for teenagers, for their own purposes\".\nThe group says online activity is \"largely unregulated and invisible to those not directly involved\", and argues it's impossible for parents to \"understand the extent to which their kids are being targeted by online military marketing\".\nOfficial figures from last year show 92.2% of armed forces recruits were aged between 18 to 29.\nSpeaking to Newsbeat at the MoD's London offices last month, Defence Minister Louise Sandher-Jones said recruitment was \"always going to target the youngest demographics\".\nShe said the MoD needed to ensure it reached young people via platforms that were popular with the age group.\n\"If they're on Twitch, then that's the kind of conversations that we need to be having,\" she said.\n\"This isn't just about going on to do something that looks cool.\n\"We recognise how important these skills are to defence, so it's definitely about targeting these skills.\"\nThe armed forces are embracing video games in other ways too.\nEsports was officially recognised as a military sport in 2024, allowing personnel to choose it over physical sports like rugby and football as a free-time pursuit.\nRAF Air Specialist Roman Davies plays Rocket League - a popular online multiplayer game - for the RAF Stormshadows team at esports tournaments.\nHe tells Newsbeat friends back home have become more interested in signing up to the armed forces when he tells them about his gaming experiences.\nAt work, he says gaming is a \"fantastic morale booster\" and one that has wider benefit to those in the military.\n\"You've got to be quick, you've got to be on it,\" he says.\n\"Especially competing at a young age as well, the pressure starts rising.\n\"Why not be able to transfer that into a military role as well?\"\nRoman says the fast decisions and performing under pressure developed as a gamer can also help to prepare you for real-life scenarios.\nIt's been seen in Ukraine, where the country's army has developed games to train soldiers.\n\"That's all being used with gaming controllers,\" Roman says.\n\"It's all being done miles away from where the actual front line is.\n\"Technology is advancing.\n\"We cannot stick to the old ways of how we do things.\"",
