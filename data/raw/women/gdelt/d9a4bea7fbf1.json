  "body_text": "Emily van Egmond has played 147 games for the Matildas and is one of Australia's all-time greats, but will the Dudley Redhead United Football Club junior get another shot at the ultimate goal of winning a World Cup or Olympics?\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nThe Matildas' hopes of securing their first ever medal at a major tournament came crashing down on Thursday morning in Marseille, France after a 2-1 loss to the United States.\nThe heart-breaking result left Australia third in Group B and making their earliest exit at an Olympics since debuting at the 2000 Games in Sydney.\nVan Egmond, playing in her third Olympics, was deployed off the bench in the 59th minute with Australia trailing 1-0 but the versatile Newcastle Jets product could not help turn around the Matildas' fortunes.\nThe San Diego Wave star overcame a debilitating back injury last year to feature at a fourth World Cup, but at 31 may not get the chance to pursue an elusive medal at another major tournament.\nAustralia lost the bronze-medal match at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago and were defeated in the third-place play-off at last year's World Cup in Sydney.\nThey are their best results at a major tournament and expectations were high for a medal in Paris.\n\"It may be the last time a core group of us are to play at an Olympic Games together,\" van Egmond told the Newcastle Herald leading into the Paris Olympics.\n\"You never know what can happen in football. Every tournament, every time you get the chance to represent your country, you treat it like it is your last.\n\"We came so close last time. I know the group is really determined to get something out of it this time.\"\nInstead, the Matildas mainstay will leave empty-handed again.\nBut veteran striker Michelle Heyman defied the odds and the age barrier to play in Paris at 36 so another major tournament is not out of the question for van Egmond, who is equally effective in an attacking or defensive role and was one of Australia's best at last year's World Cup.\nOnce the dust settles, the disappointment in Paris is sure to fuel the fire for some kind of redemption.\nNo one would want it to end like that.\nAdamstown Rosebud junior Clare Wheeler, 26, is still early in her Matildas career and in establishing herself as a key player to the team's future.\nThe Newcastle Jet turned Everton midfielder was part of coach Tony Gustavsson's World Cup squad last year without being used but featured off the bench in all three games in Paris.\nWheeler, who now has 24 caps for her country, is part of the next generation of Matildas coming through and will only continue to evolve playing in England's Women's Super League.\nShe continues to add layers to her game, proving a combative deep-lying midfielder with a killer pass as well as an opportunistic left-back, her role in the second half against the US.\n\"You can tell we're all devastated,\" Clare Wheeler said post-match on Thursday morning.\n\"It's going to be one of those games we wish we could have again ... we're sorry we couldn't get the job done today.\"",
