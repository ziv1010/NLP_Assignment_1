  "body_text": "Coming out of the international break, Emma Hayes and the Chelsea Women return to Bescot Stadium to take Aston Villa in the Women’s FA Cup semifinals.\nThis is the part of the season in which Emma Hayes-led teams kick it into high gear. Every match until the end of the campaign has some sort of meeting. The final international break within the English football calendar is behind us. Prior to a massive week of preparation for a meeting with Barcelona in the UEFA Women’s Champions League at Stamford Bridge, the Chelsea Women meet back up with Aston Villa at Bescot Stadium but this time with a trip to Wembley up for grabs.\nIt is going to be the second straight game the Blues travel to the midlands to take on Carla Ward’s side. While the fixture in the Women’s Super League was controlled completely by the west London outfit, a matchup in the FA Cup brings new challenges. There is much more on the line. During the last two FA Cup campaigns, the Villains failed to win a game, losing in the fourth round to Manchester City in 2021, and the Blues the following year 3-1 on their home ground.\nFor the west London side, it is the ninth time in the last 10 seasons in which it has reached the semifinals of the competition. Hayes’ side will be looking to secure its third straight Women’s FA Cup. Villa will be seeking to do only what Man City has been able to do to the Blues over the last five campaigns, end their FA Cup journey in the semifinals. For a team that has exceeded expectations in 2022/23, this is an opportunity to put themselves just one win away from its first-even major trophy in women’s football.",
