  "body_text": "The program organized by the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor celebrated the 75th anniversary of President Ho Chi Minh's appeal for a patriotic emulation movement.\nProfessor Dr. Le Van Quang, Director of K Hospital, one of the honorees, said, “We've been applying oral thyroid technology since 2018, and have only recently rolled it out more widely. We've held a lot of classes to transfer this internationally recognized technology.\"\n\"With this model, we perform thyroid surgery by robot. The new robotic surgery technique is only done by the US and South Korea. No one in Southeast Asia has done it. We have performed six surgeries and been awarded by an European Association.”\nThe Vietnamese women's football team and their coaches also won Vietnam Glory Awards this year.\nStriker Huynh Nhu said, “Playing in the women's world football final was a dream come true for me, my teammates, and Vietnamese women's football fans. This was also an opportunity to promote the country and people of Vietnam to international friends.”\nThe Vietnam Glory Awards have been held annually by the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor and Lao Dong (Labor) newspaper since 2004.",
