  "body_text": "The Oregon men's basketball team improved to 11-1 overall with a win over former Pac-12 rival, the Stanford Cardinal. The Ducks secured the 15-point victory behind a 13-point performance by Kwame Evans Jr. coming off the bench.\nAlongside Evans, sophomore guard Jackson Shelstad contributed 10 points in the 76-61 win over the Cardinal.\nThe Ducks have secured just one conference win when they defeated the USC Trojans earlier this month in Los Angeles. Just a few days later, Oregon lost to UCLA by just two points when a Bruin heaved up a miracle shot to give the Ducks their first and only loss of the year.\nThe Oregon Ducks have known that they were headed to the Rose Bowl for weeks now after securing their Big Ten title over the Penn State Nittany Lions.\nHowever, the Ducks' opponent in their first College Football Playoff game of the season was unknown until Saturday night. The Ohio State Buckeyes hosted the Tennessee Volunteers in Columbus for their first-round matchup and walked away with a resounding victory to punch their ticket to the Rose Bowl Game.\nNow, the Buckeyes and the Ducks will get the rematch that Ohio State has been vying for ever since Oregon defeated them in their regular season game earlier this year. Oregon and Ohio State are scheduled to kick off at 2 p.m. PT on Jan. 1, 2025.\nMore Oregon sports news:\nThe Oregon women's basketball team improved to 9-3 overall after back-to-back wins over the Air Force Falcons and the UC Irvine Anteaters.\nWith two of their losses coming to non-conference opponents and one coming to the then-No. 6 USC Trojans, the Ducks currently sit at 10th in the Big Ten – ahead of Penn State, Washington, Rutgers, Northwestern, and Purdue.\nThe Oregon football team received a noteworthy commitment from the winter transfer portal when veteran defensive lineman Bear Alexander chose to spend his future with the Ducks over programs like Penn State.\nAlexander began his collegiate career with the Georgia Bulldogs but transferred to USC ahead of the 2024 season. Now, Alexander has found his third school in the Oregon Ducks and hopefully, this landing spot will stick.",
