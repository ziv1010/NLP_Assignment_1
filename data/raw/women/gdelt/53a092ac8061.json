  "body_text": "Chelsea duo receive England awards\nChelsea defender Lucy Bronze has been voted 2025 England Player of the Year by supporters, while Blues team-mate Aggie Beever-Jones has received the top goalscorer award after her impressive performances for the Lionesses.\nIt has been another historic year for the Lionesses, who retained their crown as European champions by winning this summers competition in Switzerland.\nBronze played a pivotal role in that success, scoring against Sweden in the quarter-finals and converting the decisive spot-kick in the penalty shootout that followed. She also played 106 minutes in the final against Spain, which England won on penalties to lift the trophy once again.\nThe 33-year-old made 16 appearances for the Lionesses throughout the 2024/25 campaign and was voted by supporters as Player of the Year ahead of Chloe Kelly and Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton, who finished in second and third, respectively.\nI wasnt expecting it, but its always nice to get recognition, especially from England fans. I adore playing for England and I have put my heart and soul into every game over the last 12 years.\nIn that respect, its a huge honour and especially after such a crazy year with the Euros. Im very proud.\nFor me, 2015 was a real starting point as an England player; 2019, I feel like thats when I was hitting my peak as an individual, but this year has been something that I couldnt have imagined.\nThe way we won the Euros, the noise around it and womens football in general this year has been out of this world.\nMeanwhile, Beever-Jones has been recognised for her impressive first year in the Lionesses squad. The Chelsea Academy graduate only made her England debut in July 2024 and has scored six goals in ten appearances. She was also part of the squad that triumphed at the Euros.\nBeever-Jones first England goal came in a 5-0 victory over Belgium in the Nations League in April 2025. The 22-year-old followed that by scoring a 33-minute hat-trick on her first England start, which came against Portugal at Wembley.\nShe remains just one of two players, alongside Beth Mead, to have netted an international hat-trick at the national stadium.\nOn receiving the award, Beever-Jones said: Its definitely been a year to remember in terms of Chelsea and England.\nTo come away with the top goalscorer is something that didnt even occur to me or had in my thoughts, so its a nice little surprise to end a great year.\nI look back to the hat-trick at Wembley and its definitely something that sticks out for me. My mum and dad used to take me to Cobham every day for training and on the A3 theres one part where you can see the Wembley arch and theyd always say, Just keep going and maybe one day, youll play there.\nIt was my first start at Wembley and a hat-trick in 33 minutes, which is a number that means a lot to me at Chelsea, everything just fell into place and it was definitely a nice takeaway from 2024/25.\nCongratulations, Lucy and Aggie!\nChelsea Women vs London City LionessesYou can see Aggie, Lucy and the rest of the Chelsea Women side at Stamford Bridge next month, as we host London City Lionesses in our newest capital city derby!\nTickets remain on sale but with less than two weeks to go before the game, youll have to move quickly!\nClick here to secure your seat\n( Press Release Image: https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/345644/345644-1.png )\nWebWireID345644\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.
