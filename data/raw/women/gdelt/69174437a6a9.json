  "body_text": "Canberra United players have adopted a Ted Lasso-style approach to their bid to make a return to the finals, vowing to bury on-field and off-field frustrations to stay in the play-off hunt.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nCanberra officials are considering a last-minute appeal to overturn the Australian Professional Leagues' decision to enforce a 2-0 loss for their game against Sydney FC despite the game being stopped in the 54th minute.\nThe controversial ruling prompted Canberra chief executive Samantha Farrow to call on the league to change its protocols given its reasoning was based on a precedent set 15 years ago.\nFarrow is weighing up the time, costs and energy required to reverse the decision and have the game played again in the coming weeks as the team focuses on its bid to make the finals.\nRescheduling the match would give Canberra a boost given the team is sitting on the cusp of the top six and needs every point to smash a play-off hoodoo. United has made the finals just once in the past six seasons.\nCoach Antoni Jagarinec said he was surprised by the APL's ruling, but said it wouldn't let it be a distraction for his players.\n\"From a football purist, I want every football point made on the park,\" Jagarinec said.\n\"The reality is for 25 minutes we weren't in the match, at the 54th minute mark when the game was done it was 2-0.\n\"But in the last two or three weeks in the A-League in men's and women's, there's been seven or 10 goals scored in the 90th plus minute.\n\"So to say the match was a fair result at 2-0 with 36 minutes plus extra time to go ... in my opinion, that's probably not fair to say that.\n\"The club is working on things in the background, but we can only control what we do on the pitch.\"\nGoalkeeper Sally James said the players had already moved on thanks to having memories like goldfish, which is the same mentality as fictional coach Ted Lasso in the hit series.\n\"You just have to be a goldfish, forget everything and just take one game at a time,\" James said.\n\"[There's] not too much that I really have to say about [the Sydney result]. I'm just gonna let the club deal with that.\n\"... Finals are always something at the back of your mind but you don't want to think about it too much. In reality, the most important thing is to focus on each game. You can't play the table, you have to play the game.\"\nUnited plays Newcastle on the road this week before back-to-back home games against Perth on February 1 and the Central Coast on February 8.\nJagarinec will give Michelle Heyman until the last minute to be ready for the Newcastle trip, revealing the superstar striker had been suffering migraines.\n\"They're random, she gets them quite often, and when she gets them, they're bad,\" Jagarinec said.\n\"She has pushed through them to play before, but last weekend it was my choice [for her not to play].\"\nFUTURE UNCERTAIN, BUT UNITED PAYS HISTORY TO HERITAGE ROUND\nThe clash against the Central Coast will double as the club's first heritage round event, with a massive celebration locked in to pay tribute to the club's history.\nThe club will honour its foundation players and officials, as well as hosting a Capital Football Hall of Fame induction. The old W-League Champions trophy will be displayed to cap off the Forever Green round.\nIt comes as the club continues to face an uncertain future. Capital Football committed to running Canberra United for this season after getting a $200,000 rescue package from the ACT government, but it's unclear if the organisation will continue to operate the team next year.\nThe team's on-field performance has improved and record crowds are packing into McKellar Park, and it's believed there are some investors keen to explore the chance to own the franchise.\nIn the meantime, Farrow said it was an important mark of respect to the club's history to host the heritage round.\n\"We're proud of our club's heritage and the impact we've had on the growth of women's football in Australia,\" Farrow said.\nMORE CANBERRA SPORT\n\"This round is a great way to share that history with our loyal supporters and inspire the next generation of players and fans.\n\"Whilst the Club's future is uncertain, heritage round is about recognising the incredible women who have helped shape the game and the community that continues to support them.\nWe hope that by celebrating the history of Canberra United, we can inspire the next generation of footballers to dream big, work hard, and become the next stars of the A-League, and fans of Canberra United.\"",
