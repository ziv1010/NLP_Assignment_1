And not for the women either.\nThe Ballon d’Or winners last year were both from Spain: Manchester City midfielder Rodri and Barcelona playmaker Aitana Bonmatí. She also won the previous year.\nThe new categories for women will recognise the best young player, best goalkeeper and top scorer for club/national team.\nNominations for the 2025 awards will be announced in August, UEFA said.\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",
