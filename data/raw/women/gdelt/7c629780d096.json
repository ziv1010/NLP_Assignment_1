  "body_text": "New Washington Spirit forward, Gift Monday, is confident that her move to the National Women’s Soccer League will impact her national team career in the Super Falcons, PUNCH Sports Extra reports.\nMonday Spirit from Spanish women’s topflight side Tenerife on a three-year deal in March, ending her three-year stint in Spain.\nThe 23-year-old has hit the ground running for her new club, scoring two goals in four games – a continuation of her form with Tenerife, where she had scored 10 league goals plus three assists in 19 matches.\nDespite establishing herself as one of the best players in Spain, Monday believes she has signed up for a new challenge which will improve her game for the Super Falcons as well.\n“This move will definitely impact my game with the Super Falcons. Playing in such a competitive environment helps you grow mentally and physically,” she said in an interview with Sports Boom.\nThe former NWFL top scorer also set new targets for herself in the NWSL.\n“My positioning and finishing. I improved a bit in Spain, but I know I can do better. I’m still growing, and I need to perfect those parts of my game.\n“My personal goal this season is to understand the league—understand the game, my teammates, and make them understand my kind of football too,” she said. “It’s all about building that understanding.”\nSpirit are currently sixth in the 14-team league with 12 points, having won four of their seven matches so far, and the Nigerian striker wants to help the club reach their target as well.\n“I want to bring my talent and use my quality to help the team, especially in attack,” she said.\n“I came thinking the NWSL was a very physical game, so I brought that physicality with me. But for now, I haven’t fully seen that side—maybe I’m still new and need time to experience more.”\n“My teammates and coaching staff have been incredible. On the pitch, they’re always available—whether it’s extra training or treatment,” she continued.\n“Off the pitch, too, I have teammates nearby who I can call if I need anything. It’s been a big help.”\nTheir next game is a trip to the Chicago Stars on Saturday.",
