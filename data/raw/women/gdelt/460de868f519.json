The Terps have leaned on him heavily through the opening four games — his 134 passing attempts are one off the conference lead — and the freshman has repaid the faith of the coaching staff with interest.\nAgainst Wisconsin, Washington went 18-of-34 for 265 yards and two touchdowns through the air — while adding another score on his feet — to bring himself to 1,038 passing yards, the most by a power conference true freshman since Jayden Daniels in 2019.\nOn the defensive end, Daniel Wingate was recognized as the Big Ten’s Defensive Player of the Week for the first time. Wingate has 39 total tackles through four games, the most of any Big Ten player, and is perhaps the most important cog in Maryland’s much-improved defense.\nOn Saturday, Wingate logged 11 total tackles, the most of any player, while also recording a sack and a tackle for loss.\nIn other news\nMaryland men’s soccer hits the road to face Penn State Tuesday.
