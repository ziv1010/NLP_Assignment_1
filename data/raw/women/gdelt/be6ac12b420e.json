Following its successful run in Switzerland, the exhibition will travel to Science World in Vancouver in May 2026.\nDuring the final week of the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup, the FIFA Museum curated The Legacy Tunnel in New York, offering fans an evocative journey through the new era of global club football at Michelob Ultra’s Pitchside Club.\nMeanwhile, in Rabat, Morocco, the pop-up exhibition Rising Stars: The FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup Legends celebrated the champions and emerging talents who have helped define the women’s game.\nAs another milestone, the FIFA Museum marked FIFA’s 120th anniversary with a commemorative exhibition in Asunción, Paraguay, during the 75th FIFA Congress.\nThe FIFA Museum’s new presenter-led video talk format The Away Game was also launched in 2025, connecting football and culture through inspiring panel discussions with legends such as Jürgen Klinsmann and Carli Lloyd, and has already surpassed 1.3 million views on YouTube.\n“2025 was another significant year for the FIFA Museum, as we took a big step forward in our internationalization and global business development,” said Marco Fazzone, Managing Director of the FIFA Museum. “We want to share the magic of football with fans everywhere in the world, and it’s wonderful to see that last year we did so more than ever before. Now, as we approach the FIFA Museum’s 10th anniversary in the year of the FIFA World Cup 2026 in the USA, Mexico and Canada, excitement is building. We look forward to connecting with many more football fans through our various exhibitions and events around the tournament.”\nThe museum opened on 28 February 2016, during a ceremony presided by the then newly elected President of FIFA, Gianni Infantino.",
