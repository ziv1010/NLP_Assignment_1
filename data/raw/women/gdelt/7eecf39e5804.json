  "body_text": "Mary Earps almost quit professional football\nMary Earps might not get the same level of attention of big goal scorers like Alessia Russo and Chloe Kelly, but she’s an essential part of the Lionesses' success as the squad's number one goal keeper.\nLike any sportsperson trying to make it to the top of their game, it hasn't been all plain sailing for Mary. She has earned international caps as part of England's U17, U19 and U23 teams - as well as overcome self-doubt and disappointment.\nHere's everything you need to know about her career so far...\nWhen did Mary Earps start playing for England?\nMary Earps' senior team debut didn’t come until June 2017 when she eventually got to join the England squad in Switzerland. She was named in a major tournament squad for a second time when the Lionesses competed in the FIFA Women’s World Cup in France 2019.\nWith so much talent floating around in the squad, Mary was fourth choice goalie, and had to compete for the number one spot against the more experienced players Karen Bardsley and Carly Telford, as well as Ellie Roebuck.\nIn November 2019 she was one of the starting eleven against Germany, taking to the pitch in front of 77,768 fans - but she then had to wait almost two years before being called up to the international squad again.\nDuring this lull, she considered quitting football altogether, and has thanked her family for 'picking her up off the kitchen floor' as she struggled with thoughts that her footballing dream was over. Thankfully she stuck it out, as when Sarina Wiegman took over as England manager, Mary's life career suddenly took a sharp upwards turn.\nShe told the BBC: 'To be honest I never thought I would get back to [being #1 goalkeeper]. I didn't think I would be in a squad for a major tournament again, let alone playing a final against Germany at Wembley.\n'I can vividly remember the days of feeling really down. I got to a point where I felt I had sort of reached my limits. I had given football a good go, but wasn't quite good enough. I had responsibilities, I had a mortgage and it wasn't adding up. Eventually I decided to give it just a couple more years.\n'Then Sarina came in, in the September (2021) and life changed just like that. I felt that she really understood where I came from and had real empathy for me as a human being. That is not something I've experienced a lot in football.\n'I like her directness, her honesty and I can't really express how much she has changed my career really. This whole year has just changed everything.\n'When Sarina came in and picked me for the squad, I just thought I’d go, do my best and have no expectations. The way it all went… I could never have written it in a million years.'\nHow did Mary Earps become a goal keeper?\nSpeaking to GQ Magazine, Mary revealed that she was playing football in the garden with her dad and brother when she decided she wanted to be a pro-footballer. She joined a local team, and her supportive parents ferried her to matches and training.\n'I was playing a local Saturday match and saved a penalty. Goalkeeping is a very individual position. I never wanted to do anything else.'\nShe added that she has a 'very intense' work ethic. 'I’m very ambitious about wanting to push myself to reach my absolute maximum potential and change the landscape of female goalkeeping. You know, just small goals.'\nHow tall is Mary Earps?\nMary Earps is 5ft 8, or 173cm tall.\nWhat league clubs has she played for?\nBorn in Nottingham, Mary spent her early years playing at her hometown club of Nottingham Forest. She then moved to Bristol City, Doncaster Rovers and Reading, before testing out the European waters by joining the German team, Wolfsburg.\nNow, the 30-year-old plays for Manchester United and has become the first goalkeeper in Women's Super League history to register 50 clean sheets. She really is on fire.\nPlus, when it comes to England, Mary Earps has another 20 clean sheets in her 29 appearances to add to the list.\nWhat is the biggest achievement in Mary Earps’ career?\nWhile she’s had to work hard to secure her spot as England’s number one goalie, this has only helped her earn her place in the history books too.\nIn 2022, Mary made the top three shortlist for FIFA’s Goalkeeper of the Year award, becoming the first English (male or female!) keeper to make the top three of any globally recognised award since David Seaman in 1996. What a queen.\nWhat job did Mary Earps do before football?\nThe United goalie is a smart cookie on the pitch as well as off the pitch. For her undergraduate degree, Mary attended Loughborough University and studied Information Management and Business Studies.\nLooking for another fun piece of trivia? We’ve got you covered – she actually has a bus named after her in her little hometown of West Bridgford.\nIs Mary Earps on social media?\nMary Earps is the TikTok queen of the Lioness squad with a following of over 665,800. She frequently joins in on the latest TikTok trends, does challenges with her teammates, and shows some behind the scenes video clips of what life is like on the team.\nMore in Sports\nYou can also catch up with her life on Instagram (@1maryearps).\nYou Might Also Like",
