(WBFF) — The Maryland state flag – a symbol of pride, identity, and fierce loyalty for many residents – has become the subject of renewed political scrutiny in Annapolis after Gov. Wes Moore described it as a “contradiction” and his administration declined to say whether those remarks signal support for legislative change.\nThe comments, made during a podcast appearance last week, prompted questions from lawmakers in both parties and exposed uncertainty among state leaders about whether Maryland’s iconic flag – unchanged for more than a century – could once again become a political flashpoint.\nState archives show the Maryland General Assembly formally adopted the flag on March 9, 1904, making the red, white, black, and gold banner the state’s official emblem for nearly 122 years. Its design combines the heraldic banners of the Calvert and Crossland families and is widely displayed across Maryland, flying from homes and storefronts, stitched onto clothing, and worn with pride.\nThat pride was on display Friday afternoon outside the State House.\n“It means pride. It definitely shows how much we care about our state,” said Kim, an Annapolis resident who asked that her last name not be published and was wearing a Maryland flag scarf at the time. “I wear it proudly. I love to see it flying high.”\nLawmakers echoed that sentiment.\n“The Maryland flag? It’s one of the most unique flags out there,” said Del. Chris Tomlinson, R-Carroll and Frederick Counties. “I go to different conferences with state legislators, and they always bring it up that Marylanders – they – we love our flag.”\nMoore: ‘Our flag is a contradiction’\nThe symbolism of the flag took on new political weight last week when Moore discussed it during an appearance on The Press Box podcast while speaking broadly about mid-decade redistricting.\nThe governor also touched on his time playing college football, his legislative priorities for the General Assembly session, and the possibility of a future presidential run.\n“And do I understand kind of the history of this country? Absolutely – like you can't look at the history of Maryland,” Moore said. “I mean, literally, you look at our flag. Our flag is a contradiction because our flag is literally a Confederate symbol mixed with a Union symbol.\"\n\"Like Maryland is the northernmost southern state in this country. The bloodiest battles of the Civil War were fought in the state of Maryland, and despite that, I stand here as the governor of that same state.”\nGovernor’s office won’t clarify\nWhen pressed on Tuesday whether Moore’s remarks signaled support for changing the flag, the governor’s office did not provide a direct answer.\nAmmar Moussa, Moore’s press secretary since September and a former spokesperson for Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, opened his response by saying, “I’m not sure how you’ve missed the Governor saying this at least a half dozen times over the last 10 months” before sharing a statement from David Turner, Moore’s communications director and senior advisor.\n\"Maryland's flag is undoubtedly the best flag in the country,” Turner said. “It also symbolizes the state's complicated history. As you know, the Crossland arms were adopted by the Confederacy, and the Calvert arms were adopted by the Union. The Governor often uses that history to provide audiences unfamiliar with the legacy of the state a way to understand it quickly. There's not more to it than that unless someone is willfully ignoring the facts, which happens from time to time in politics.”\nThe lack of clarity prompted questions from lawmakers in both parties.\nHe said that the Maryland flag is a contradiction? What did he mean by that? I’m not even sure,” said Del. Mark Fisher, R-Calvert County.\nTomlinson said he had not been aware of the governor’s previous remarks.\n“I’m going to be really disappointed if we are going to start pursuing that, changing the flag. I think a lot of people are going to be disappointed, but then again, we got rid of our Maryland song, the state song. We’ve never replaced it with anything,” Tomlinson said.\nFisher suggested the governor’s remarks overlook historical context – namely that the flag was intended to symbolize reunification after deep divisions.\n“I think that’s interesting because the state of Maryland was a line state,” Fisher said. “Part of the state went for the North, part of the state went to the South.”\nHouse speaker dodges questions on Maryland flag\nSpotlight on Maryland also asked House Speaker Joseline Pena-Melnyk, D-Anne Arundel and Prince George’s Counties, about Moore’s comments during a Tuesday news conference focused on mid-decade redistricting – the same topic that prompted the governor’s remarks. Democrats described the legislation as a response to what they called political redlining.\n“I am going to speak to the bill,” Pena-Melnyk said. “I don’t know why that came up. I know that the bill that we have here, that we passed yesterday, is really important. It’s important for many reasons.”\n“It’s important because I feel very strongly that we are living under a dictatorship, that we are losing our rights. There a lot of civil rights violations, where people like me are being racially profiled,” Pena-Melnyk added.\nPressed again for clarity, the speaker declined to directly answer whether she believes the flag should change.\nI’m not going to speculate,” Pena-Melnyk said. “I feel for us to keep our democracy, to protect Marylanders, this is a right bill to pass, and that’s what I want to focus on, the fact that over 25,000 people in Maryland lost their jobs”\nDespite repeated attempts to redirect the discussion to the flag, Pena-Melnyk did not say whether she believes the Maryland flag should change.\nQuestions were also sent to Senate President Bill Ferguson, D-Baltimore City, but were neither acknowledged nor answered.\n‘Perfectly obtuse’\nThe debate comes as Mississippi, Utah, Minnesota, and Georgia have changed their flags in recent years, citing Confederate symbolism or a desire for more inclusive representation. Each change followed intense political debate, and in some cases, public referenda.\nIn Maryland, discussion about changing the flag briefly surfaced in 2020 but stalled without legislative action.\nSpotlight on Maryland asked the governor’s office why it would not directly answer where Moore stands on the flag’s future. Moussa was pressed on whether “insults” and not “answer[ing] the question” were part of “the governor’s new media strategy.”\nMoussa was also asked about unrelated remarks he previously made to women journalists, calling them “perfectly obtuse” and “idiotic.”\n“I answered the question and called out the fact that your reporters seem to be unable to do the bare minimum of research,” Moussa wrote, referring to the governor’s previous comments on the flag. “That’s it.”\nAnd rest assured, there are plenty of male reporters that I think are obtuse,” he added.\nMaryland flag’s future\nRepublican lawmakers said they believe Moore’s remarks are aimed more at a national audience than Maryland residents.\n“If the Democrats are looking to replace the Maryland flag or remove it because they think there is some kind of racial component, that’s just ridiculous,” Tomlinson said. “I hope we’re not doing that.”\nFisher went further.\nHere we are moving forward, and the Democrats control every aspect and every lever of power in the state, and they’re still whining,” Fisher said. “They’re still whining. What are they whining about? They’re still in charge! You know what, they can’t govern. The grid is going down. People can’t afford to pay their taxes. They can’t afford to register their cars. The governor is offering payment plans for that.\n“Stop whining, governor, and grow up,” Fisher added.\nFor residents like Kim, the debate touches something deeply personal.\n“I know there is some controversy behind it because of some of the colors and the meanings of some of the pieces,” Kim said. “But it is part of our history, and it is an important piece of our history.”\nDo you have a tip related to this story?
