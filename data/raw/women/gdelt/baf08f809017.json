The pair were pictured smiling at the Stadium Australia on August 20.\nYet the official record issued through the Foreign Office says \"no\" when asked if he'd taken a family member or friend. It comes days after he was forced to admit a similar \"mistake\" when The Mirror reported Mrs Cleverly was also at the Wimbledon men's singles final a month earlier.\nIf you can't see the poll, click here\nIt is a fresh blow to the Tory leadership contender, who last week told party members: \"We win back voters by being honest, by being professional, by being conservative.\" A spokesman for Mr Cleverly confirmed that a second error had been made in relation to the World Cup final and the Foreign Office has been asked to correct it.\nThe Shadow Home Secretary is among the frontrunners to take over from Rishi Sunak as Conservative Party leader. Tory MPs will narrow the four candidates - also including Robert Jenrick, Kemi Badenoch and Tom Tugendhat - down to two on Thursday.\nREAD MORE: DWP's two-child benefit limit sends 10,000 kids into poverty since Labour won electionThe Mirror can reveal that Mr and Mrs Cleverly travelled to Australia to watch the historic game, where they were guests of world football body FIFA. Mrs Cleverly donned a red England scarf as she made her way into the stadium alongside her husband.\nUnfortunately the Lionesses were beaten 1-0 by Spain. As Mr Cleverly was there in his capacity as a Government minister, a Tory loophole means he didn't have to reveal the cost of the hospitality.\nLabour has vowed to abolish this rule, which was brought in under David Cameron in 2015. When ministers accept hospitality, cleared through officials, they are required to say whether a spouse, family member or friend joined them.\nThe Foreign Office document says 'no' to this question for both sporting events. But pictures show him sitting side-by-side with Mrs Cleverly watching the Wimbledon final between Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic on July 16 last year.\nThe then-Foreign Secretary also had lunch in the President's Suite as a guest of the Lawn Tennis Association. Just one month later he and Mrs Cleverly were at the Women's World Cup final Down Under.\nWhile he was at the stadium Mr Cleverly met foreign officials and dignitaries including Queen Letizia of Spain. His office said the Foreign Office had been contacted to correct the error. A spokesman for the Shadow Home Secretary said: \"James has always been fully transparent with any gifts and hospitality received. In this case there was a mistake in the declaration and we have contacted the FCDO to ask them to rectify it.\"\nSources say officials would have been aware of Mrs Cleverly's presence because of security protocols. It is understood the Tory frontbencher lays the blame with unnamed officials.\nThe ministerial hospitality record was published on March 12 and had not been corrected before The Mirror spotted the discrepancy. It comes amid a backlash over rules that mean ministers can avoid declaring the cost of hospitality and gifts. Other freebies declared by Mr Cleverly through Government departments include tickets to a Six Nations rugby match, a film premiere and a dinner celebrating a new art exhibition.\nWhen he was Foreign Secretary Mr Cleverly accepted the Wimbledon tickets and the World Cup final tickets, as well as a film premiere ticket from Warner Bros in February 2023. His office declined to say which film Mr Cleverly watched, but Warner Bros releases around that time included Magic Mike's Last Dance, Mummies, Creed III and Shazam! Fury of the Gods.\nAfter becoming Home Secretary in November 2023 he was gifted a pair of tickets by Sky for a Six Nations match between England and Wales in February this year. In the same month, he and a guest enjoyed a private dinner to mark the opening of the John Singer Sargent and Fashion exhibition at Tate Britain.\nHospitality offered via Government departments is received and cleared by officials, and can't be declared by an MP's Parliamentary office.\nREAD MORE: Join our Mirror politics WhatsApp group to get the latest updates from Westminster",
