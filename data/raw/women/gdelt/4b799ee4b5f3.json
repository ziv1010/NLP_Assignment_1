  "body_text": "EXCLUSIVE: Hopes Prince William's Saudi visit will bring luck to city 'cursed by spirits'\nThe Prince of Wales is heading to Saudi Arabia for a historic royal tour, with the visit pledged to be a \"sign of good fortune\" for both countries\nSaudi Arabia ruler Mohammed bin Salman is hoping Prince William brings luck to an ancient city once considered to be cursed by evil spirits.\nThe Prince of Wales will this week visit the Kingdom at the request of the British government in what is billed as his most diplomatically sensitive trip in years. William will meet the controversial Saudi ruler and is expected to be honoured during his visit as a mark of respect between the two nations.\nSaudi sources say there has been six months preparation to welcome the future king to the Middle East nation, and hoping the visit is “a sign of good fortune for both nations”.\nWilliam will visit the capital Riyadh and the desert oasis AlUla - an ancient site once thought to be cursed by evil spirits. The Saudi ruler is ploughing millions into regeneration and education programmes, in the hope of turning it into a world class tourist destination.\nSources in the country told of the “immense honour and excitement” of Prince William's visit, which “will place AlUla on the global map”. One source added: \"AlUla has a rich and vibrant history and the visit by the Prince of Wales is an important moment for our nation.\"\nFor decades, Saudi Arabia’s ancient desert region of AlUla, spanning millennia of human history, was closed off to most outsiders. Due to conservative Islamic religious beliefs, the region was considered to house djinn, the Arabic term for evil spirits, stemming from its pre-Islamic historic ruins of civilizations such as the Nabateans whose prominent tombs feature in UNESCO world heritage sites like Hegra, also known as Mada’in Saleh.\nSaudi Arabia has begun promoting its pre-Islamic heritage, transforming its rich ancient history found in AlUla via an ambitious cultural program under the Royal Commission for AlUla. The commission was crested to preserve and develop the 2,000-year-old archaeological and historical site of AlUla into a thriving cultural hub for archaeology, art, design and tourism.\n“AlUla’s cultural landscape is evolving at an incredible pace, with each season bringing new experiences that bridge past and future,” says Hamad Alhomiedan, the Director of Arts & Creative Industries for the Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU). “The upcoming AlUla Arts Festival (until Feb 14) will be our most diverse yet.” He added: “AlUla’s growth as a cultural capital is rooted in the distinct qualities that make it unique.\"\nWilliam’s three day visit, from Monday to Wednesday, will also focus on energy transition and young people, two areas the kingdom is promoting heavily as it attempts to diversify its oil-dependent economy. The visit has been billed as one of the most politically sensitive overseas trips of William’s public life this week as he travels to Saudi Arabia at the request of the UK Government.\nCentral to the trip will be talks with Mohammed bin Salman, widely known as MBS. The crown prince is credited with pushing economic reforms but remains internationally divisive. While reforms have allowed women to drive and increased participation in public life, significant legal and social limits remain.\nUS intelligence report concluded he approved the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul — an allegation he denies and Saudi Arabia rejects. Whether William raises such issues privately is unlikely to be disclosed. Kensington Palace does not comment on confidential conversations.\nIn recent years Saudi Arabia has staged major sporting and cultural events, including Formula One races, international film festivals and high-profile entertainment shows. The country will also host the men’s football World Cup in 2034. Officials argue this signals modernisation and openness. However, critics say it is “sportswashing” — using global events to distract from repression.\nHuman rights organisations including Amnesty International have raised concerns over restrictions on free speech, criminalisation of same-sex relationships and harsh penalties for dissent. However, the prince will be briefed extensively by the Foreign Office and the British Embassy before any meetings.\nGovernment insiders describe William as a key diplomatic asset, with one source saying the monarchy acts as a “secret weapon”, able to open doors politicians sometimes cannot. This so-called soft power has long been part of the Royal Family ’s overseas role, aimed at building strategic relationships.\nEnergy cooperation and investment are expected to dominate talks, particularly as Britain seeks new partners during the global shift away from fossil fuels. The visit also reflects longstanding links between the two royal families. King Charles III has travelled to Saudi Arabia numerous times over the decades and is said to maintain warm relations with senior figures there. William is now expected to assume a more prominent global role as he prepares for future kingship.",
