We had outside coaches, both in football and hurling in 2025, which is a considerable drain on the meagre resources of the club. It would be fantastic if we had home grown coaches, and that must be the model to strive for, in partnership with the ethos of the GAA, and an area, that will receive a greater spotlight in 2026.\nPlayers and our facilities have been and will continue to be at the forefront of our club’s philosophy. On the club’s behalf, I sincerely thank everyone, including over 50 coaches, for their dedication and commitment to growing our club’s GAA footprint.\nWe were honoured to have a host of players involved at Avondhu this year in both hurling and indeed, in the captain of Avondhu, Liam Cronin, in hurling. Liam also had Jamie Magner with him, on the Avondhu Senior hurling team, and we had a fine knowledgeable selector with the bunch, in Tommy Cremin.\nLast year (2024) was always going to be a tough year to live up to, especially with the exodus abroad to broaden horizons and careers for so many of our experienced players, but we did welcome some back including the 2 Foxes up the road from me. We are glad to hear a lot of our emigrants continue to play with their temporary clubs, in Vancouver and Sydney and elsewhere – hard to avoid the jealousy when approving some of these transfers.\nFootball: Killavullen started the season with some tough league encounters, missing some of their playmakers from last year. Killavullen started strong in the championship with a convincing victory over Deel Rovers but unfortunately finished the season losing to Charleville in round 3. Thanks to selectors Dan O Sullivan, Ed O Connor, Willie Fox and Conor O Sullivan for all the work they put in. The club wishes to express its gratitude to Colman Sheehan for bringing the footballers from strength to strength. We went to the semi final of the football championship and on another day, if the ball had bounced our way, we might have been contesting the final, of the Junior A Grade. Still, this team, Avondhu champions in 2023, has a lot of potential that can still be realised. The demands of being a dual club demands focus. With the club being so successful of late, firstly in football in 2023 and hurling in 2024 there’s hope that with continued focus we could we could win back some silverware again.\nHurling: Following on from the historic year last year, with several players having emigrated, Killavullen still managed to power through the Division 7 County Hurling League to make it to the final in July. They lost out to Diarmaid Ó Mathunas after a valiant battle on the day. It was fantastic to have the team travel the length and breadth of the county representing the village. We did win promotion to Division 6 county league though, which is a stand-out achievement.\nNo silverware this year in Avondhu competitions, but the hurlers played some brilliant games throughout the year, with huge support to all of the game, and we were cruelly beaten in the championship semifinal, when a cold first half was to prove to be our nemesis, going under to a well drilled, and focused Dromina team. Injuries to key players at pivotal moments in the year did not help our situation either, but the team is capable of wresting back the Sean O Brien cup again, if maintaining focus. Well done to the lads, Niall Hanrahan, Barry Murphy, Sean Murphy, Dan Hanrahan and Pat Heffernan.\nWe as a club are proud that we are able to enter second team competitions every year and this year was no different. Our junior B footballers put in valiant displays throughout the year. Thanks to Ian Roche, Greg Fennel, Brian Fitzpatrick, Kevin Lillis and the football management for their help with this. We were close to success with the Div 3 league campaign , and Junior B football championship and the management deserves praise for their perseverance.\nOur Division 4 hurling team, won through to the league final, and lost out narrowly to Ballyhooly. Our junior C hurlers put in a good performance again this year. In early November they beat Ballyhooly to get into the semi-final and were close to reaching the final. Unfortunately, Charleville managed to seal an injury time win last weekend after a very tight game. Thanks especially to John Brennan, Barry Murphy and Tim O Neill for all the work they put in taking charge of this team.\nLadies Club: The year 2025 represented an outstanding period of development and achievement for Killavullen Ladies Gaelic Football Club. Across all age groups, our Killavullen female players demonstrated exemplary commitment, teamwork, and sporting excellence. Killavullen Ladies club extend their sincere appreciation to all coaches, management, and volunteers whose continued dedication has been instrumental in the club’s progress.\nIn the community, in Killavullen, we were particularly proud to have several players selected for the U13 and U15 North Cork Development Squads, reflecting the growing strength and talent within our underage structures.\nOn the field of play, the club recorded significant competitive success. Their Minor team captured the League title, the U21s emerged as group winners, and our Junior team progressed to the County Championship Quarter-Finals.\nThese achievements are a testament to the sustained hard work and development of all involved.\nKillavullen Ladies GAA Club were pleased to appoint sixteen Female Liaison Officers, fulfilling an important requirement within the women’s game, and the recruiting of those, proves that people will step forward, when asked. Killavullen GAA also extend their congratulations to Mary Magner on her successful completion of the Munster Leading Ladies in GAA programme.\nOff the field, the Gaelic for Mothers and Others group coordinated several highly successful events, including the Family Funday and the Ladies Fashion Event, both of which contributed positively to club development and fundraising.\nKillavullen Ladies club can certainly look forward to 2026 with confidence and continued collaboration\nJuvenile Club: A great year in the juvenile division of our club this year, with healthy numbers and great enjoyment been had by all. Congratulations to the U14 age cohort on their North Cork league final victories, in both codes. Championship success eluded them, but they gave great accounts of themselves in Semi-final, against Whitechurch in Rebel Óg East, and in the football final against Dromtariffe. Also, the number of training sessions, blitzes and games attended to by the younger age groups is testament to the hard work that is been orchestrated by Dave McCarthy as Chairperson, of this committee. On any given night, the playing areas in Killavullen are extremely busy, and in a year when “independent Clubs, came under the spotlight, isn’t it great and proud to say that we stand alone. That may be a challenge into the future, as the population declines as and changing demographics nationality.\nCúl Camp was a fantastic success, organised by Ella, Catherine and Dave as principles, but with an army of coaches and volunteers,–with Sean McDonnell from Mallow as the guest of honour. Sean, well related, in Killavullen was very popular with all.\nWith all persons pulling in the same direction, the juvenile committee can be proud of their endeavours and if you measure success by participation rates, Killavullen Club is in great health. It is brilliant to see the number of juveniles wearing the club jerseys, and supporting the adult teams in their competitions, and hopefully, the adult players continue to reciprocate their support to the juvenile teams.\nCamogie: It is great to see that a Camogie club kicked off in Killavullen during the calendar year, and in Michael O Farrell, they have got a real leader and go-getter in terms of organising. Whilst only up to the U12 cohort at the moment, this will be expanded as the girls train and play their way up in 2025. New club, new coaches, new enthusiasm is only to be applauded.\nLotto - There was no winner of the GAA lotto on Tuesday night 9th December in the draw which took place in the Community Centre.
