There were three tiers of sponsorship for the 2025 tournament, with 11 brands signed as official 'UEFA Women's Football' sponsors, a category set up in 2018 covering both the UEFA Women's Euro and UEFA Women's Champions League. A further five brands specifically sponsored Euro 2025 and looked to capitalize on the interest of national teams.
