  "body_text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio — Top MLB prospect Jackson Holliday caused a stir when he asked Baltimore to wear No. 7 this week in his major league debut. The number had been unofficially retired by the club after Cal Ripken Sr. last wore it. How would Holliday’s request have gone over if he played for the Yankees and wanted to wear Mickey Mantle’s No. 7 or Boston wearing Ted Williams’ No. 9?\nOn Friday’s podcast, Paul Hoynes and Joe Noga talked about when a prospect asking to wear a retired number is OK and when something like that would not fly. Could you imagine anybody asking to wear No. 19 in Cleveland?\nThey also preview the upcoming Yankees series and look at the latest Shohei Ohtani news.\nListen and read along with an AI-generated transcript of the podcast below.\nMore Guardians coverage\nRead the automated transcript of today’s podcast below. Because it’s a computer-generated transcript, it may contain errors and misspellings.\nJoe Noga (00:15):\nWelcome to the Cleveland Baseball Talk podcast. I’m Joe Noga, joined by Paul Hoynes Hoey The Guardians are set to open a three game weekend series against the New York Yankees Battle of First Place teams from the American League Central and the American League East. Hopefully they get the games in particularly tonight’s game looking kind of dicey right now weather wise, but the Yankees come to town. It’s always a different feel for a series expecting good crowds for the series and a really good competition. Both teams coming in, swinging the bats pretty well and among the league leaders in most pitching categories.\nPaul Hoynes (00:56):\nYeah, Joe, the two hottest teams in baseball are with two teams with the best records in baseball. Yankees have won seven of the last 10. Cleveland’s won seven of their last 10, and it’s always a fun series, especially in Cleveland. The Yankees bring out the Cleveland fans that are Yankee fans and Yankee fans always travel well too, so I bet it’s fun. It’ll be fun at the ballpark this weekend if the rain holds off.\nJoe Noga (01:27):\nCleveland fans that are Yankee fans aren’t Cleveland fans. Those are Yankee fans. Those are Clevelanders who don’t really know who they are. That’s just awful and that’s the other thing is if there’s 25,000 people in the stands, I bet you 15,000 of ‘em are Yankee fans, so it’s going to be weird. I remember back, I believe it was one of maybe the second series of the year they were playing Arizona on the road. The Yankees were, and I saw a photo, it was a shot from the third base dugout up the first base line as a Yankee hitter, had pulled the ball to right field and for a home run and was running up the first base line and all the arms were up and people were cheering up the whole first section of that side of the ballpark and the caption just said, this is a shot of the away team in Arizona’s Park, and it was a Yankee hitter and he was getting more cheers.\n(02:27):\nIt looked like he was playing at home basically, and he had hit a home run. So that’s what they bring. They bring those kind of the same fans who were fans of the Dallas Cowboys and I don’t know, Yukon Women’s basketball. The teams that win every year, those are change their loyalties pretty quickly. So that’s who you’re going to run into at the ballpark this weekend and just another reason for me to hate on the Yankees as I always do, but this time it is legitimate. I mean they seem to be putting it together this year. It starts with the top of that lineup. Obviously Aaron Judge is always a killer, but John Carlos Stanton too is a guy who’s swinging the bat. Well,\nPaul Hoynes (03:19):\nYeah, he has Homer now officially Joe against all 30 teams. I think Wednesday he homer against Miami, his old ball club that made him 30 for 30, I guess only. There’s only 15 active players that have done that, and one of ‘em is our old buddy Carlos Santana. So when Santana starts swinging, I mean when Gian Carlos Stanton starts swinging the bat, well, I mean he scares guys. He scares me. He’d scare me if I was a pitcher because he looks locked in right now\nJoe Noga (03:59):\nAnd it’ll be our first chance to get to see Juan Soto in a Yankees uniform. Their big acquisition in the off season, and obviously he’s a guy that transforms the top of that lineup as well. Guardian’s pitchers are going to have their work cut out for them.\nPaul Hoynes (04:15):\nYeah, no doubt about it. Then they’ve got Anthony Volpe up at the top of that lineup. He’s hitting 3 72. Soto, like you said, is hitting 360. Aaron Judge, not off to the greatest start, but he’s got two home runs, six rbis. He’s only hitting 1 78, but he’s always dangerous as well.\nJoe Noga (04:39):\nYeah. Still a guy who sees red every time he sees a Cleveland uniform out there dating back to the beginning of his career. So as far as a day off before the series starts helps Cleveland’s bullpen. It was weary, it was worn out after six, I’m sorry, three straight games at home coming into this. That’s got to be helpful, especially against a Yankees lineup that has a little length to it, and now you’re talking about guys like Carlos Carrasco, Tristan McKenzie have not really gone deep into games yet. This season it could be a problem if you get to Sunday and everybody in that guardian’s bullpen is worn out,\nPaul Hoynes (05:33):\nThey have got to do a better job with the rotation, Joe. They’ve got to get deeper into the games. We’re not telling, that’s not a state secret for sure, but they’ve got to do a better job with that. I think Carrasco has reached the fifth inning once Tristan has gotten into the fifth inning once, I believe there would be tone setters if they could go deep into the game,\nJoe Noga (06:01):\nAnd that’s sort of what you need you got to rely on with your more veteran guys because Tanner Bibe and Logan Allen thus far have shown those, some of those sophomore growing pains, I guess both guys are pitching like young starters who are still trying to get their footing under them, both in their most recent starts giving up five run leads in these games that they pitched at Progressive Fields. So just something to keep an eye on is their ability to get deeper into games and as the series goes on, we will follow that. The Yankees come to town, obviously always sort of a big, I don’t want to say moneymaker, but this is a date that the organization kind of circles and says, Hey, we are expecting big crowds and it’s a weekend series at home. Always a good thing to get the Yankees on the schedule for that when the weather doesn’t cooperate. It’s kind of frustrating, I guess, for the organization.\nPaul Hoynes (07:12):\nYeah, it’s too bad. I think this is the second year in a row that the Yankees have come in early in April for their only visit to Cleveland. The weather is always iffy in April and Cleveland. Well, it’s really anywhere on the East coast and Midwest, so I’m sure the schedule makers in the Cleveland’s executive offices would like to see this in June or July, not in mid-April, but it is what it is. You got to play the games as the schedule tells you to play.\nJoe Noga (07:47):\nYeah, and they do try to balance out the schedule in terms of how many weekend home series you get, how many weekend road series you get and which teams come through at which times, but it never fails. The teams that the Yankees, the big market teams feel are small potatoes and they saved those weekend home series for days when they know it’s going to be 45 and rainy, whereas they’re at home during July and August and you got to go out there and never a fun trip. And then they go right, they go right from playing the Yankees at home in the rain to an 11:00 AM game on Patriots Day in Boston, which is just a nightmare. Logistically, I don’t feel bad for, for JJ the travel secretary because it’s got to be no fun trying to get to Boston and navigate with the marathon and everything coming around on Monday.\nPaul Hoynes (08:51):\nYeah, that’s going to be an interesting game, Joe. What 11 Oh fives first pitch. Those games usually go fast too, so it’ll be over. You might be able to see the end of the marathon by last pitch.\nJoe Noga (09:08):\nYeah, I’m sure security’s going to be really a pleasant thing to get around that day, so looking forward to my first ever trip to Fenway Park as we go forward. Alright, want to remind our listeners, you can sign up for Guardian Subtext to get updates about the team and how we’re doing here. Go to cleveland.com/subtext. It’s 3 9 9 a month or send a text message to 2 1 6 2 0 8 4 3 4 6 to sign up there. We’d love to hear back from you and get your thoughts on some of these developments. In terms of housekeeping news and notes, one thing we didn’t get a chance to mention or go deeply into West Parsons, I guess they traded for a Toronto reliever on Wednesday. They acquired him in exchange for international bonus pool money, $250,000 in international bonus pool money that’s going to Toronto that in exchange for a right-hander, west Parsons who has experienced pitching the last two seasons in Korea, six foot five hard thrower according to Stephen Vote. They’re again able to add pieces and add depth and guys who hopefully you never have to see a West Parsons up with the organization or with the major league club, but if injuries happen or if somebody needs to go, then West Parsons might get a shot here to help out the ball club.\nPaul Hoynes (10:49):\nYeah, no doubt about it. They have been stockpiling reinforcement slash arms, I guess you’d call ‘em for the last month or so, especially after they started the season with six or seven pitchers on the IL and then you lose Shane Bieber. We still don’t know when Gavin Williams is coming back, so you’re going to need help in the rotation and the bullpen and that bullpen has been worked pretty hard, so I think they’re trying to stockpile as much security as they can and West Parsons kind of falls into that category.\nJoe Noga (11:31):\nYeah, you bring up Gavin Williams, you mentioned him starting to get nervous that we haven’t heard anything or haven’t heard about him and his progression, at least in his return at the beginning of the week, I sort of took it as no news is good news, but now as we’re getting towards the end of the week and we still haven’t heard anything about Gavin Williams, I’m starting to get nervous about no news being something they’re not telling us.\nPaul Hoynes (11:58):\nI don’t know Joe. I mean he has to go back out to spring training. He is back out in spring training. He was traveling with the team on that first road trip. I think he went everywhere except maybe Minnesota and he was throwing bullpens, he was playing catch, so he was moving in the right direction. I don’t think they would’ve sent him back to a good year if he wasn’t ready to resume spring training two for him. It’s going to be a while. I would think we won’t see him until sometime in May if everything goes well\nJoe Noga (12:34):\nAnd they haven’t started their extended spring games or anything like that yet. I believe they were just about to get started with extended spring out there and eventually that turns into the Arizona complex leagues. So you’re just looking for spots where he can get into games once he does start throwing live and competitive situations. So who knows when. We’ll definitely be asking if we get a chance to talk to Steven Vogue today about just an update on Gavin’s progress. Usually we get a general injury update from about all those guys, so we’ll hear about that later on today.\n(13:16):\nBig news in baseball yesterday that was sort of broke was the Shhe Otani case interpreter has been accused of basically embezzling or stealing millions from him in gambling to cover gambling debts. The federal investigation was released yesterday and it turns out that everybody who was assuming that this was just a cover job for Otani, I guess is eating their words today because Meca was basically, the investigation shows that it was all him and he had stolen up to what, more than $16 million. And it really looks like this was one guy who orchestrated this whole situation to cover all these gambling debts with a bookmaker and he’s facing some serious federal prison time.\nPaul Hoynes (14:24):\nYeah, Joe, it’s amazing what one trusted friend can do to another friend, and this was a case of that this was a guy that was impersonating ani to banks, impersonating Ani to his agent. I mean, it is really, the roots on this scandal really go deep and they all point to O isn’t the first player to be built, but by an unscrupulous agent or friends or anything like that. You read about it all the time, but it’s just shocking really. I mean, this is a guy that, he was his friend, he was his buddy. He didn’t go anywhere without this guy and here he’s behind his back balking them for every penny he could get his hands on.\nJoe Noga (15:23):\nThe sheer numbers that were being tossed around in some of these stories about MHA are just baffling. He had run up debts of $183 million. He was placing bets just a daily, constantly and winning money, but also losing more than he had won. And just the sheer amount of money that was being talked about here, it just makes you wonder how one guy couldn’t notice that somebody was stealing $16 million from him. But then you factor in the fact that this guy’s the gatekeeper. He’s the guy who interprets four Shhe Tani and he knows both languages. Tani only knows one and it was pretty easy for him to just tell agents and people doesn’t want you to worry about this account or anything like that. So again, it’s just staggering to see the numbers and the sheer amount of money that was done that was moved around or right under o’s nose\nPaul Hoynes (16:38):\nAnd it happens to what? Rock stars, it happens to entertainers, it happens to athletes. It just shows you that if you get to that class, if you dedicate your life and reach that level of athleticism or success in any field, you better have good people around you, people that you can trust or this could happen to you.\nJoe Noga (17:03):\nWell, when I make my first billion hoey, you’ll be the first one that you won’t have anything to worry about. I won’t let anybody talk me out of it or steer me in wrong direction. So I remember I said that when I make that first billion, Hey, the last thing I wanted to talk about today, and it was something that we were talking about before we started recording here. The totally shifting gears away from stealing money and all that kind of stuff. The Baltimore Oreos called up their top prospect, the top prospect in baseball in Jackson Holiday. Jackson Holiday wears number seven and nobody for the Orioles had worn number seven since Cal Ripkin Sr. Who played, who managed with the club and obviously was the father of Cal and Billy Ripkin, and it was just a legend there in Baltimore and the number had not yet been retired or had not been retired, but just out of respect, no one had worn number seven for the Orioles and Jackson Holiday. That’s his number. That’s what he’s worn his when he plays baseball. They asked the Ripkin family if it would be okay for Jackson Holiday to wear the number. Ripkin’s gave permission and basically their blessing and said, Cal Ripkin tweeted, he thinks it’s great that Jackson holiday’s wearing number seven and that’s the number he is wearing. What do you think about guys wearing retired numbers or asking permission to wear retired numbers as far as for different teams?\n(19:00):\nWhen I thought about it, when I heard about it, I thought back to Ohio State’s football. Andy Katzenmoyer was a highly recruited linebacker and one of the things that got him to Ohio State was he asked if he could wear Archie Griffiths number 45 and Archie Griffith had to come out and give permission for him to wear it, and it was a big to-do. People were kind of upset about it to see a linebacker running around with Archie Griffith’s number on, but if that’s what got the top line backing recruit to Ohio State, I guess that’s what you got to do as far as in baseball wearing that wouldn’t fly in New York or in Boston asking to wear a retired number in one of those legends.\nPaul Hoynes (19:47):\nYeah. I wonder if somebody asked to wear DiMaggio’s number, a 20-year-old Yankee prospect that got called up, would he want to wear number five? You’d have to move heaven and earth to do that. There’d be a revolt in New York. So yeah, I give the Ripkin family credit and Cal Senior was kind of the guy that I think would not stand on ceremony there. I think he’d like to see his number back in play, but I don’t think they’re going to put Junior’s Number is not going to Ripkin Jr. His number is not going to be Unretired.\nJoe Noga (20:31):\nYeah, I think it’s number eight. If Jackson Holiday wanted number eight, that would be maybe a little bit of a different conversation. Well, like you said, the example that you gave, what if Jackson Holiday, who wears number seven played for the, do you think Mickey Mantle, what kind of a revolt would Yankee fans have if Jackson Holiday insisted on wearing number seven? I can’t imagine that ever happening. You’d have to do something like what Tito did with, instead of word seven, you wore 17, and then if somebody came along and wanted to wear 17, you’d just change the 17 to a 77 because it was easy to do. It’s one little squiggle on your shower shoes or something like that. I thought that was a good way to get around it. Some guys really don’t care about the numbers. They care less what their jersey number is, but it’s important to some people and it’s important to fans, especially the numbers of these legends. That’s who it’s important to.\nPaul Hoynes (21:38):\nYeah, that’s the thing, Joe, I thought when Jim to left Cleveland, Tony Amato kind of unofficially retired his number, but Jason Jambi came along and he wore Tommy’s number. Then when Tommy came back for the second time, his second tour, he GBI gave the number to Tony and it was unofficially retired. And then of course now it’s been officially retired now that Tony’s in the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. But that’s like some rookie pitcher coming up and asking to wear 19. If you’re a Cleveland guardian, I mean, come on, the kid has to have some sense of history that there’s a lot of baseball that came before him and there’s going to be a lot of baseball that came after him. So you got to kind of pick your spots with that. I think,\nJoe Noga (22:35):\nYeah, I could just picture feller pointing up to the wall, Hey, you see that number on the wall kid? That’s number 19 and that’s where it’s staying. That’s the kind of thing that you kind of imagine with that. But yeah, the GBI thing was interesting because that was before Tommy went into the Hall of Fame and when a player in the Guardians franchise goes into the Hall of Fame, that number gets retired. That’s sort of their deal there. So I don’t know, I just found it interesting. The other example is in Cleveland at least, the Cavaliers had Larry N’s number retired. He wore number 22 and it was already in the rafters when Larry N’s son came to Cleveland and wanted to wear number 22. And pretty easy to get dad’s permission to wear that number. And it’s also, that’s kind of a neat situation where you’ve got a Nance wearing N’S number. That’s interesting. I believe Pete Nance is with the team now, and I wonder if he had any inkling about wanting to wear that 22, but kind of a different thing when the bloodline is the same.\nPaul Hoynes (23:54):\nYeah, definitely. And I just think, Joe, when I see different players wearing different numbers, you see there’s been, after Albert Bell left the club and different players would wear number eight. It just didn’t seem right to me. Or you see somebody wearing number seven, Kenny Lofton’s old number you picture, it just doesn’t jive. But that’s just a fan in me. That’s just me. But I’m sure other people feel the same way. You identify with numbers, you identify, especially in baseball, to me, you identify with numbers.\nJoe Noga (24:33):\nI think the example that pops out the most in my head with that is Joe Montana when he went and continued his playing career in Kansas City. I think he played the last two years of his career in Kansas City, he had worn number 16 for the Niners for his entire 13 years in San Francisco, and he worn number 19 with Kansas City. And I just thought it was so weird to look out there and see Joe Montana wearing number 19. But like you said, any of those nineties, mid nineties Cleveland baseball teams players that number 24 is Manny Ramirez. Well, Tristan McKenzie wears number 24 now. Tristan McKenzie and Manny Ramirez look nothing alike. And it’s just that went Manny Ramirez, Grady size more Tristan McKenzie in my mind with 24. So just hard to track those numbers. I guess that’d be a good question to ask. Maybe our subtext subscribers, which guardian’s number looks kind of goofy on somebody other than a player that you would think of, I guess. But yeah, certainly number seven, number eight, number nine, number 24. I guess if you’re Jose Ramirez, you’ve kind of wrestled the number 11 away from Paul Sorento,\nPaul Hoynes (26:01):\nRight? Paul Sorrento. And I think Toro wore number 11 too.\nJoe Noga (26:06):\nWell now, now you’re going way back. You’re going to lose some fans that way.\nPaul Hoynes (26:10):\nBut Joe, the number that really sticks out to me as 17 when Brian Sipe wore it, and now you see some, I think there’s been some Cleveland quarterbacks that have wore 17 since\nJoe Noga (26:22):\nThompson Robinson is wearing it now. Yeah,\nPaul Hoynes (26:24):\nYeah. Okay. And that just does not register with me. If I’m C 17, I’m thinking the cardiac kids and he’s throwing the 82 Ozzy Newsom, let’s go.\nJoe Noga (26:37):\nWell, it’s so hard with numbers in the NFL because they have different rules about who can wear what numbers in the NFL, what positions wear different numbers. I mean, in baseball you could have a shortstop wearing number 76, and that happens in spring training a lot, but usually by the time they get to get to the big leagues and get into the regular season, those big double digit numbers come down and they change and they get into a more comfortable number. The one I thought was really weird who didn’t change his number was Steven Kwan. He wears 38. I mean, who wears number 38? Why is that number significant? So we could get into a deeper discussion about numerology and all that. But that’ll be for another podcast. This one’s coming to a close Zi. We’re going to try and stay dry tonight at the ballpark, and hopefully we’ll be talking to you again on Tuesday because there will be an early game Monday. We’ll check in again early next week on the Cleveland Baseball Talk podcast and we’ll talk to you then. Good deal, Joe.\nGot a question you want answered on the podcast?
