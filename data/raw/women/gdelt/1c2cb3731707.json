  "body_text": "3 best WSL managers: October 2024 - ranked\n- The WSL table is taking shape after October’s fixtures\n- Manchester City sit top with Chelsea and Manchester United close behind\n- Brighton’s Dario Vidosic secured the Manager of the Month award\nAnother busy month of WSL action has come to a close and it’s been an exciting start to the 2024/25 campaign.\nThe table is already starting to take shape after a first full month of games, and Manchester City currently lead the way at the summit. They have, however, played a game more than their rivals, and both Chelsea and Manchester United are hot on their heels.\nAt the opposite end of the standings, West Ham, Everton and Aston Villa are still awaiting their first wins of the season. Each have just two points from five games, although the Hammers sit bottom on goal difference.\nAs attention shifts to November’s run of fixtures, 90min have ranked the top three managers from last month…\n3. Sonia Bompastor\nSonia Bompastor has settled into life at Chelsea in impressive fashion. They are the only team in the WSL this season yet to drop any points, and October included a tough away trip against Arsenal at the Emirates.\nOf course, the manager inherited an outstanding, title-winning squad left by Emma Hayes, and she was able to invest heavily over the summer. But, it is all coming together on the pitch, and Chelsea look just as unstoppable as they always have done.\n2. Gareth Taylor\nThis could have been a tricky month for Manchester City as they fell behind in their games against Liverpool and Aston Villa, and would have in the game against West Ham if not for an incorrect offside call. But, testament to the team’s resilience, they were able to claw their way back and win all three of their matches in October.\nTaylor’s side have played a game more than their rivals, but they sit at the top of the table and are yet to suffer defeat. Given the setbacks against tough opposition, the City boss deserves immense credit for the team’s ability to respond to adversity.\n1. Dario Vidosic\nIt is Dario Vidosic’s second month of management in the WSL, and he has already claimed the Manager of the Month accolade. He was a strong contender for September’s award following Brighton’s bright start to the season, and the Seagulls have continued to go from strength to strength.\nBrighton secured seven points from a possible nine last month with two victories and a draw. They beat Aston Villa and Crystal Palace, and managed a 1-1 draw against Manchester United at home before the international break.\nThe south coast club now sit fourth in the league standings, level on points with United, who have played a game more. They are just three points off current leaders Manchester City.",
