She wanted to impress and to train. It was a fantastic week.\n\"At the end of the camp we were playing in a game. I remember getting the ball in the middle of the field and getting wiped out in a tackle.\n\"I thought it was my brother Shaun [but], as I looked up, there was Lucy looking down at me as if to say 'come on, get up'.\n\"From a young age, she had it. One of her middle names is Tough. She's very tenacious and resilient.\"\n'Best in the world'\nJobson, who runs the Trident Soccer group with his brother, recalled how the pair helped Bronze get involved with training camps in the United States before she moved there aged 17 having won a scholarship with the University of North Carolina.\nShe later went on to play for Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City, Lyon and Barcelona and is currently with Chelsea, having won five Champions League trophies, nine league titles and six domestic cups.\nJobson said he was proud seeing Bronze score England's first goal against Sweden in their quarter-final comeback on Thursday before finding the net again in the penalty shoot-out.\n\"That game the other night was wonderful. It was great to see how much Lucy drove that team forward.\n\"It was eye of the tiger stuff out of Rocky. She galvanised the team.\n\"You can see from the moment the referee blows the whistle she wants to keep driving them forward.\n\"For me, she's the best female footballer in the world.\"\nFollow BBC North East on X, external, Facebook, external, Nextdoor and Instagram, external.\nGet in touch\nDo you have a story suggestion for BBC Tyne?\nRelated topics\n- Published2 July 2025",
