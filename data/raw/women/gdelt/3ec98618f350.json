Gymnastics started their season on the right foot, the indoor track season is upon us, and women’s basketball is thriving in the heart of SEC play. We’ve got plenty to cover from the weekend.\nWhat else is steeping in today’s Brew?\n- Sitting down with Anthony Black\n- Gymbacks come out swinging\n- And much, much more!\nAs Arkansas men’s basketball celebrates their 100th season in program history, we’re putting together Razorback super-teams from across the decades to decide the greatest Starting 5 of all time.\nEvery day, you’ll have a chance to vote on who your pick would be with the winner moving on to the next round until we crown a champion.\nToday’s matchup?\nTEAM 1: Dusty Hannahs, Oliver Miller, Ronnie Brewer Jr., Martin Terry, and J.D. Notae\nTEAM 2: Daniel Gafford, Derek Hood, Lee Mayberry, Jaylen Barford, and Ron Brewer\nGrowth is ingrained in Anthony Black’s story. In high school, his height progressively increased all the way to the nearly 6’8″ stature he possesses now. But his game on the court has progressed rapidly in such a short time with the Razorbacks. Oh, and that hair has taken a handful of years to grow as well.\nBo Mattingly sits down with Black to tell his story, and how his freshman season is going in the first Hog Pod of 2023.\n> FLOORED THE COMPETITION. The Arkansas gymnastics team outscored Nebraska on vault, bars, and floor on their way to a victory in Lincoln to kickoff their season. It’s their second straight season-opening win.\n- Graduate transfer Norah Flatley took home the bars title with a score of 9.900 and a share of vault, on which she scored a 9.850.\n- Redshirt freshman Cami Weaver split the vault title with Flatley. It was Weaver’s first appearance on vault since she sustained a season-ending injury in her collegiate debut on the event.\n- Freshmen Frankie Price and Lauren Williams both earned a third of the three-way tie for first place in the floor with scores of 9.875. Not too shabby for their debuts on the floor!\nRead up on how each section went for the victorious Gymbacks here.\n> ATTACKING PRESENCE. Arkansas men’s basketball saw freshman guard Anthony Black put together his best game of the new year over the weekend.\nBlack scored 23 points in an aggressive offensive showing. How else do you get to shoot 16 free throws? Black made 13 from the charity stripe, the most he’s netted this season, in his third 20-point game of the season and first since the Maui Invitational. He also grabbed seven rebounds in the Hogs’ 72-59 loss to Auburn.\n> OFFENSIVELY NICE. Arkansas’ offense had another fantastic season under offensive coordinator Kendall Briles.\nThe Razorbacks had their second-best seasons in total offensive yardage and yards per game with Briles calling plays, and Briles will return for his fourth season at the position next year and third with KJ Jefferson as his quarterback. Check out how 2022 stacked up to other great years in Razorback football history here, via the team’s Twitter account.\n> CONTINUED DOMINATION. Another winning streak is well underway for the Arkansas women’s basketball team. The Hogs took care of business on the road to defeat Missouri, 77-55, to win their third-straight contest and notch their best start to SEC play in 17 years. The win was also their eighth-straight over the Tigers.\nSaylor Poffenbarger led the Razorbacks with a career-high 24 points on Sunday, while Erynn Barnum got herself a nice double-double with 21 points and 11 rebounds.\nNow 16-3 and 3-1 in the SEC, Arkansas will have a week off before their next game against Vanderbilt on January 16th.\nTalking it out. An off shooting night hurt the Hog basketball team on the road at Auburn. Z is here to talk about what happened, and what’s next. And we’re bringing you a preview of a brand-new documentary on 100 Seasons of Arkansas Basketball in today’s episode.\nDid someone send you the Razorback Brew?
