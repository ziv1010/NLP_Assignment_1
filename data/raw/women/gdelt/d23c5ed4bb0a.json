This high-standard audience is shaping trends and spending power, but advertisers risk missing a critical window to build trust and benefit financially before competitors step. A new Eskimi study highlights this gap, ranking South Africa in second place among the analysed countries running the most Gen Z-focused ad campaigns.\nGen Z is wealthier at this stage of life than any generation before it, according to a recent NielsenIQ and World Data Lab report. They already represent over 17 percent of global spending, amounting to USD 57.6 trillion, a figure projected to exceed USD 67 trillion by 2030. This estimate would make Gen Z the world’s wealthiest generation with the highest purchasing power.\n“Gen Z is the first generation to grow up entirely online, fluent in social media, e-commerce, and digital platforms from an early age. They move seamlessly between apps, content, and shopping channels, and expect brands to match their speed and creativity. Brands that delay learning about this audience may struggle to maintain relevance and, ultimately, revenue growth,” says Cornelis Ouwehand, Eskimi’s regional director for Africa.\nTo understand which advertisers are already testing strategies for Gen Z and preparing for this new generation of consumers, Eskimi analysed over 81.000 display ad campaigns worldwide, including campaigns in South Africa. Below are the key takeaways from the study:\n• South Africa stands out as one step ahead of most countries in its Gen Z-focused online advertising efforts. It secured the second position among the researched countries for the scope of campaigns targeting Gen Z. Greece ranks first and Serbia – third.\n• In South Africa, FMCG brands lead the way, making up 85 percent of all Gen Z-targeted campaigns, followed by the fashion industry (8 percent), and pharmaceuticals sector (5 percent).\n• Worldwide, the mix of industries targeting Gen Z also shows a clear lead from FMCG brands at 51%, followed by education at 11% and technology at 5% of the analysed campaigns.\nPeople moves\nSimon Robinson returns full-time to lead Mediatech Africa 2026\nMediatech Africa has confirmed that co-owner Simon Robinson has returned full-time as Exhibition Director, effective 1 September 2025, to steer the show’s comeback edition, 1–3 July 2026 at Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit & International Convention Centre, Johannesburg.\nRobinson launched Mediatech in 2001 at the Sandton Convention Centre and has guided its growth into Africa’s cornerstone event for professional AV, broadcast, production, staging, lighting, and display technology. During the show’s six-year hiatus, he kept close to the market—project-managing large-scale productions and events, and serving as Business Development Manager at one of SA’s big AV distributor’s.\n“Stepping out of the organiser role for a season let me see the industry from other angles,” says Robinson. “Running projects on the ground and spending time in distribution gave me a better feel for the pressures and timelines our exhibitors and buyers face. That perspective will help shape how we deliver 2026.”\nReflecting on the event’s pause, Robinson says: “We kept Mediatech off the calendar until the industry could support a show that meets our visitors’ expectations. Mediatech isn’t your average B2B expo and we weren’t going to bring it back half-baked.”\nKagiso Media Radio welcomes new faces to its growing editorial team\nKagiso Media Radio (KMR) is expanding its editorial department by adding standout talent to its Time Out South Africa team.\nKMR has put together a team of content specialists, editors, writers, and social media experts to showcase the best of South Africa’s unique culture and cuisine.\nAnthea Carstens, general manager of Kagiso Media Radio Publishing and Time Out South Africa, says attracting the right talent is a key part of KMR’s growth strategy.\n“This new team will be instrumental in driving our mission to deliver the best experience for our audiences, while also supporting KMR’s commitment to excellence and impactful and purposeful storytelling. Talent is the heartbeat of our brand and investing in the right people for Time Out South Africa is key to our growth and relevance.”\nTime Out South Africa content director, Andrew Hallett, says compelling content is rooted in experience and the ability of talented writers to take the audience on a journey.\nSelene Brophy, City Editor, Cape Town: Brophy has been crafting stories for over a decade. Before joining Time Out South Africa, the journalist and editor led editorial and strategy for various travel and tourism clients.\nLiesl Bartlett: City Editor, Johannesburg: Bartlett’s background is rooted in journalism, content creation, and digital media strategy.\nPoelano Malema: Senior City Writer: With over 15 years of experience in the media industry, Malema understands what makes a good story.\nIshani Chetty: Social Media Manager: Chetty is a University of Cape Town graduate with nearly nine years of journalism experience under her belt.\nAmy Fraser: Content Coordinator: Fraser’s previous experience includes working as a content writer and producer for various broadcasting brands.\nLePub Johannesburg strengthens strategic leadership with Kurt Jossie appointment\nLePub Johannesburg has appointed Kurt Jossie as head of strategy, reinforcing the agency’s commitment to delivering culturally resonant, insight-led creativity that drives impact across South Africa and beyond.\nJossie brings a wealth of strategic experience, having shaped brand narratives for some of the country’s most iconic names. His appointment marks a pivotal step in LePub’s evolution – deepening its strategic capabilities and sharpening the role of data and cultural intelligence in the creative process.\nLePub Johannesburg is on a mission to become the most dynamic and desirable agency in the country, powered by a vibrant, eclectic mix of talent and united by a belief in creativity’s ability to inspire, influence, and drive meaningful change.\n“Kurt brings a rare blend of analytical sharpness and creative empathy,” says Greg Pfuhl, MD at LePub Johannesburg. “His ability to decode cultural signals and turn them into actionable strategy will be key as we continue to build ideas that live in culture and move markets.”\nDoctoral student’s triumph at national FameLab competition a first for SU\nLuther Chipembere, a doctoral student in Agricultural Economics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) at Stellenbosch University (SU), achieved a remarkable feat when he was recently crowned the FameLab South Africa 2025 champion. With this accomplishment, Chipembere became the first SU participant to win this prestigious award. He was announced the winner at an event in Pretoria hosted by the South African Agency for Science and Technology Advancement & Jive Media Africa.\nConsidered to be one of the biggest science communication and public speaking competitions in the world, FameLab, which is also a development initiative, creates a platform for young emerging scientists to speak to public audiences about their work.\nChipembere, who is also an administrator at the African Doctoral Academy at the Centre for Capacity Development in Africa at SU International, said becoming the national FameLab champion is both humbling and affirming. “It shows that research can matter to people beyond the walls of research institutions and that ideas about food and technology have value in society. For me, it is encouragement to keep connecting science with the people it is meant to serve.”\nChipembere’s doctoral study applies AI and strategic foresight to global challenges, including food insecurity, generating insights that inform policy and practice.\nBusiness moves\nDisney+ to add live ESPN linear channels in SA from 2 October 2025\nDisney+ has announced that, from 02 October 2025, the ESPN Africa linear channels will be available to South African customers at no extra cost.

The four journalists, veteran reporters who have worked for AFP for a long time, explain the extreme difficulty of working in a war-ravaged territory, where they must also protect their families.\nIn the spring of 2024, all AFP reporters working in the territory were evacuated along with their families. Since then, the Agency has relied on Palestinian freelancers who stayed on the ground, and who continue to document the reality of war in a territory that has been off-limits to the international press since the conflict started.\nInside Gaza will be screened on September 28 at the DIG Festival in Modena (Italy), dedicated to documentary and investigative journalism, followed by the Bayeux Calvados-Normandy War Correspondents’ Award on October 9.\nThis Franco-Belgian co-production brings together Arte France, RTBF, and FACTSTORY, with the participation of AFP, the support of RTS, and in partnership with Reporters Without Borders (RSF).\nWomen’s Leadership Summit coming to Sandton to empower female entrepreneurs for business success\nThe Woman of Stature Foundation is inviting female entrepreneurs to attend the Professional Collective Leadership Summit 2025 on Thursday, 2 October 2025 at Hotel Sky in Sandton.\nThis one-day event will give entrepreneurs the practical tools, skills and inspiration to grow successful and sustainable businesses.\nWhat you can expect:\n- A dynamic keynote address by award-winning speaker and 5 x best-selling author Nikki Bush – renowned for helping leaders uncover human potential\n- Powerful panel discussions\n- Interactive workshops\n- Expert advisory sessions equipping women with practical skills for business growth\n- Motivational talks from professionals and industry leaders\n- Loads of lucky draws to win prizes for you and your business\nDate: Thursday, 2 October 2025\nTime: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM\nVenue: Hotel Sky, Sandton, Johannesburg\nTickets: R900 – book online here: https://paystack.com/buy/evolveher-summit-2oct25",
