DIRECTORS' REPORT\nThe directors submit their report and the audited Financial Statements and related notes for Flutter Entertainment plc for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nThese consolidated financial statements and entity financial statements of the Company (collectively, the \"Financial Statements\") for the year ended 31 December 2024 are prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU) and meet the reporting requirements pursuant to Irish company law. In addition to the Financial Statements contained in this report, we also prepare separate consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\"). The Form 10-K (under U.S. GAAP) is a separate document, a copy of which may be obtained from the Company's website at https://www.flutter.com.\nGeneral\nFlutter Entertainment plc (the \"Company\"), together with its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the \"Group\"), is a global sports betting and gaming group, whose operational headquarters are at 300 Park Avenue S, New York, NY 10010, United States of America. The Company's registered office is Belfield Office Park, Beech Hill Road, Clonskeagh, Dublin 4, D04 V972, Ireland.\nThe Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in Ireland and currently maintains a primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") under the symbol FLUT and a listing in the equity shares (international commercial companies secondary listing) category on the London Stock Exchange (the \"LSE\") under the symbol FLTR. The Financial Statements comprise the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings and the entity financial statements of the Company, and were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 11 March 2025.\nAs of 30 June 2024, we determined that we no longer qualify as a foreign private issuer, as defined under the Exchange Act. As a result, effective as of 1 January 2025, we were no longer eligible to use the rules designed for foreign private issuers and are now considered a U.S. domestic issuer. As such, we are required to comply with the same ongoing regulatory requirements as a U.S. registered company with a primary listing on the NYSE.\nThe Company is no longer within the scope of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018, following the relocation of the Company's primary listing from the LSE to the NYSE. Due to the Company's listing in the equity shares (international commercial companies secondary listing) category on the LSE, it will, however, remain within the scope of the UK Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") applicable to issuers with a listing on this segment of the LSE. Certain disclosures on sustainability will be made in the Sustainability Report to be published by the Company in or around 24 April 2025, a copy of which will also be filed with the FCA and available on our website at www.flutter.com/investors/results-reports-and-presentations.\nPrincipal Activities and Future Developments\nBusiness Overview\nFlutter is the world's leading online sports betting and iGaming operator based on revenue. Our ambition is to change our industry for the better and deliver long-term growth while also achieving a positive, sustainable future for all our stakeholders. We are well-placed to do so through the global competitive advantages of the Flutter Edge, which provides our brands with access to group-wide benefits to stay ahead of the competition, while maintaining a clear vision for sustainability through our Positive Impact Plan.\nThe Group consists of a diverse portfolio of leading recreational brands and products with a broad international reach. We operate some of the world's most distinctive online sports betting and iGaming brands which offer our principal product categories of sportsbook, iGaming and other products (exchange betting, pari-mutuel wagering and daily fantasy sports (\"DFS\")).\nThese products are offered by FanDuel (sportsbook, iGaming and other products in our United States (\"U.S.\") division), Sky Betting & Gaming (sportsbook and iGaming products), Sportsbet (sportsbook products), PokerStars (iGaming products), Paddy Power (sportsbook and iGaming products), Sisal (sportsbook and iGaming products ), tombola (iGaming products), Betfair (sportsbook, iGaming and other products), TVG (other products), Junglee Games (iGaming and other products) and Adjarabet (iGaming products). In January 2024, we acquired a 51% controlling stake in MaxBet, a leading omni-channel sports betting and gaming operator in Serbia, which offers sportsbook and iGaming products and is included in our International division from that date.\nIn September 2024, we announced two strategic acquisitions. First, the acquisition of a 56% interest in NSX Group, a leading Brazilian operator of the Betnacional brand for cash consideration of approximately $320 million (Brazilian Real 1,981 million). The transaction is subject to customary completion accounts adjustments with a redemption mechanism in the form of call and put options which allows us to acquire the remaining interest in year five and year ten following the completion date. Second, the acquisition of 100% of Snaitech S.p.A., one of Italy's leading omni-channel operators for a cash consideration of US$2.4 billion (€2.3 billion) subject to completion accounts adjustments. We expect these acquisitions to be completed in 2025 subject to customary closing conditions. We believe that both acquisitions fully align with our strategy to invest in leadership positions in international markets and will expand our reach in the attractive markets of Brazil and Italy.\nWe are the industry leader by size with 13.9 million Average Monthly Players (\"AMPs\") and US$14,057 million of revenue globally for fiscal 2024. AMPs refers to the average over the applicable reporting period of the total number of players who have placed and/or wagered a stake and/or contributed to rake (i.e., the commission we take for operating or hosting a game) or tournament fees during the month. This measure does not include individuals who have only used new player or player retention incentives, and this measure is for online players only and excludes retail player activity.\nWe operate a divisional management and operating structure across our geographic markets. Each division has an empowered management team responsible for maintaining the momentum and growth in its respective geographic markets. For fiscal 2024, our divisions were: (i) U.S., (ii) UK and Ireland (\"UKI\"), (iii) International and (iv) Australia, which aligned with our four reportable segments. In the first quarter of 2025, the Company updated its internal reporting, including the information provided to the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") to assess segment performance and allocate resources, and, as a result, will update its reportable segments for the fiscal year 2025. Following these changes, the Company will have two reportable segments: U.S. and International, (which will include what was formerly our UKI, International and Australia segments). This change in reportable segments further aligns the Group with the growth of the US segment.\nOpportunity for long-term growth through our financial growth engine\nWe believe that we are well-positioned to capitalise on the future long-term growth of the markets we operate in, through our financial growth engine. This is built on:\n-\nSustainable revenue growth: We seek to expand the Group's player base and grow player value through product innovation and efficient player incentive spend. We believe that there are significant revenue growth opportunities for both our U.S. and ex-U.S. businesses. As more U.S. states have legalised sports betting and iGaming, our U.S. business has grown revenue by 32%, from US$4,395 million in fiscal 2023 to US$5,789 million in fiscal 2024. Excluding the U.S. business, we have grown revenue by 11%, from US$7,426 million in fiscal 2023 to US$8,268 million in fiscal 2024, and we believe that our International \"Consolidate and Invest\" markets, which include Italy, Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Spain, Serbia, Morocco, Brazil and India, provide the platform for continued high levels of future growth.\n- Significant cashflow generation: Although acquisitions have resulted in increased long-term debt in recent years, we believe that sustained revenue growth and margin benefits will combine with low levels of capital intensity due to the scalable nature of our technology platforms, and positive working capital from our growing business, will permit us to reduce our leverage ratio and generate significant cash flow over time and unlock capital allocation opportunities for the Group. As of the end of fiscal 2024 and 2023, we had total long-term debt of US$6,734 million and US$7,064 million, respectively.\n- Disciplined capital allocation: We aim to create long-term value through disciplined capital allocation, including:\n- Disciplined organic investment: We believe that our player acquisition cost, lifetime value and player relationship management models and algorithms provide a disciplined evaluation framework enabling high returns from our investment in player growth and retention.\n-\nValue creative M&A: We have clear criteria for acquiring bolt-on, \"local-hero\" brands, with podium (i.e. top-three) positions in high-growth markets. These local heroes are then complemented in the post-acquisition period by the benefits of the Flutter Edge. Our acquisitions of FanDuel, Adjarabet, Junglee Games, tombola, Sisal, and MaxBet are examples of this strategy. We believe that there remains significant further M&A potential to add market-leading businesses in regulated markets where the Group does not currently have a presence.\n-\nReturns to shareholders: We expect that the Group's projected cash generation will permit us to return to shareholders capital that cannot be effectively deployed in organic investment or value creative M&A. We have recently announced a share repurchase program through which we expect to return up to $5 billion to shareholders over the next few years.\nWe had a net loss per share of US$(1.3) and US$(5.6) for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively.\nThe combination of margin benefits, cashflow generation and disciplined capital allocation is expected to drive earnings per share growth and long-term value creation.\nKey Operational Metrics\nAMPs is defined as the average over the applicable reporting period of the total number of players who have placed and/or wagered a stake and/or contributed to rake or tournament fees during the month. This measure does not include individuals who have only used new player or player retention incentives, and this measure is for online players only and excludes retail player activity.\nWe present AMPs for each of our product categories, for each of our divisions and for the consolidated Group as a whole as we believe this provides useful information for assessing underlying trends. At the product category level, a player is generally counted as one AMP for each product category they use. In circumstances where a player uses multiple product categories within one brand, we are generally able to identify that it is the same player who is using multiple product categories and therefore count this player as only one AMP at each of the division and Group levels while also counting this player as one AMP for each separate product category that the player is using. For example, a player who uses FanDuel Sportsbook in the sportsbook product category and FanDuel Casino in the iGaming product category, in each case within the U.S. division, would appropriately count as one AMP for each of the sportsbook product category and the iGaming product category but only as one AMP for the U.S. division and one AMP for the Group as a whole. As a result, the sum of the AMPs presented at the product category level in each of our U.S., UKI and International divisions, where we offer multiple product categories (and in contrast to our Australia division, where we only offer our sportsbook product category), is greater than the total AMPs presented at the division level. For example, we reported within our U.S. division for fiscal 2024, AMPs of 3.1 million for our sportsbook product category, AMPs of 0.8 million for our iGaming product category and AMPs of 0.5 million for our other product category, while reporting AMPs for our U.S. division of 3.8 million (which figure is lower than the sum of 4.4 million that would be calculated by adding AMPs presented at the product category levels). Because the AMPs we present for the consolidated Group as a whole simply represent the sum of the AMPs we present for each of our four divisions, the sum of the AMPs we present for each of our product categories at the Group level will also exceed the total AMPs we present for the consolidated Group as a whole.\nNotwithstanding the methodology described in the immediately preceding paragraph, our AMPs information is based on player data collected by each of our brands, which generally each employ their own unique data platform, and reflects a level of duplication that arises from individuals who use multiple brands. More specifically, we are generally unable to identify when the same individual player is using multiple brands and therefore count this player multiple times. For example, a player who uses Sky Betting & Gaming Sportsbook in the sportsbook product category and Paddy Power Casino in the iGaming product category, in each case within the UKI division, would appropriately count as one AMP for each of the sportsbook product category and the iGaming product category; however, this player would also count as two AMPs (rather than one AMP) for the UKI division and two AMPs (rather than one AMP) for the Group as a whole. In addition, a player who uses Sky Betting & Gaming Sportsbook in the sportsbook product category and Paddy Power Sportsbook in the sportsbook product category, in each case within the UKI division, would count as two AMPs (rather than one AMP) for the sportsbook product category, two AMPs (rather than one AMP) for the UKI division and two AMPs (rather than one AMP) for the Group as a whole. We are unable to quantify the level of duplication that arises as a result of these circumstances, but do not believe it to be material and note that it arises primarily in our UKI division, where we offer multiple successful brands within multiple product categories, but where we believe that most players tend to utilize only one brand given each brand has its own separate registration system and player platform.\nIn addition to the duplication that arises when the same individual player is using multiple brands as described in the immediately preceding paragraph, we do not eliminate from the AMPs information presented for the Group as a whole duplication of individual players who use our product offerings in multiple divisions during the reported period. For example, a player who uses Betfair Casino in the iGaming product category within the UKI division and PokerStars Sports in the sportsbook product category within the International division would appropriately count as one AMP for each of the iGaming product category and the sportsbook product category and would appropriately count as one AMP for each of the UKI division and the International division;\nas a result, this player would count as two AMPs (rather than one AMP) for the Group as a whole. We are unable to quantify the level of duplication that arises as a result of these circumstances, but do not believe it to be material and note that players must demonstrate residency within the geography covered by a division to sign up for an account, and accordingly such duplication could only arise in the circumstance of an individual player having multiple residences across different divisions.\nWe do not believe that the existence of player duplication as described in the previous two paragraphs undercuts the meaningfulness of the AMPs data that we present for assessing underlying trends in our business, and our management uses this AMPs data for this purpose.\nStakes represent the total amount our players wagered in sportsbook and is a key volume indicator for our sportsbook products. The variability of sporting outcomes can result in an impact to sportsbook revenue that may obscure underlying trends in the sportsbook business relating to growth in amounts wagered and, accordingly, staking data can provide additional useful information. We do not utilize staking information to track performance of our iGaming products. Because our iGaming business is not subject to the same variability in outcomes, management is able to assess trends in our iGaming business by analyzing AMPs and revenue changes, without the need to collect or analyze stakes and believes that collecting and analyzing stakes data in our iGaming business would not provide meaningful incremental information regarding trends in such business that is not already provided by collecting and analyzing our iGaming AMPs and revenue data.\nSportsbook net revenue margin is defined as sportsbook revenue as a percentage of the amount staked. This is a key indicator for measuring the combined impact of our overall margin on sportsbook products and levels of bonusing.\nOur Products\nOur principal products include sportsbook, iGaming and other products, such as exchange betting, pari-mutuel wagering and DFS. For fiscal 2024, 56% of our revenue was derived from sportsbook, 40% of our revenue was derived from iGaming, and 4% of our revenue was derived from other products, while 91% of our revenue at the Group level was generated from our online businesses. Our online operations are complemented by 1,150 retail shops, mainly in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy and Serbia. In each market, we typically offer sports betting, iGaming, or both, depending on the regulatory conditions of that market.\nSportsbook\nOur sportsbook offerings, such as FanDuel, Sportsbet or Sky Betting & Gaming, involve a customer placing a bet (wager) on various types of sporting events at fixed odds determined by us. Bets are made in advance of the sporting event that will determine the outcome of the wager. In the event the specified outcome occurs, the customer wins the bet and is paid out based upon the odds assigned at the time of the bet. We generate revenue by setting odds in a manner that includes a theoretical spread to be earned on each contest less winnings paid and expenses associated with promotional activity.\nIn addition to this revenue, revenue from our real-money games (i.e., games in which real money is wagered on the outcome of the game) includes revenue earned on the processing of real-money deposits and cash-out options (which gives the customers the option to exit the game and to obtain an early return from their bet), in specific currencies, which is sometimes referred to as conversion margins.\niGaming\nWe offer our customers peer-to-business (\"P2B\") iGaming products, peer-to-peer (\"P2P\") iGaming products and lottery products.\nOur P2B iGaming products involve customers betting against the house. Our iGaming products allow customers to bet on a range of games of chance such as online casino, bingo and machine gaming terminals. We provide a combination of third-party content and proprietary games, reflecting a shift to in-house developed products in order to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Our iGaming offerings typically include the full suite of games available in land-based casinos, such as blackjack, roulette and slot machines. We generate revenue through the gross bets placed less payouts on winning bets, which is also referred to as \"hold.\"\nOur P2P iGaming products include poker and rummy. As P2P operators, we are generally not exposed to the risks of game play or the outcome of the game, as we typically take a rake or commission from the game play. For P2P games, player liquidity, or the number or volume of players with an operator, is critical to the success of the game, with a greater number of players supporting a wider range and greater volume of games and larger tournaments, increasing the quality of the offering to the consumer. As a result, larger scale poker or\nrummy operations will benefit from superior player liquidity in their systems, which, in turn, improves their offering to customers, creating a positive feedback loop.\nWe also offer our customers lottery products through our Sisal brand under fixed term licenses known as lottery concessions in various jurisdictions. For example, SuperEnalotto, Win for Life, VinciCasa, Eurojackpot, and SiVincTutto operate in Italy, Sisal Sans operates in Turkey and Sisal Loterie Maroc operates in Morocco. Our lottery products involve customers purchasing a ticket where they have the potential to win a prize and where the winning outcome is drawn at random. Sisal receives a commission in respect of the lottery services provided under the concession agreement.\nOther\nWe include within other product revenue our P2P sports betting products, which involve customers playing/ betting against each other and not against the house, where we make a commission on the bets. Our sports betting P2P products include the Betfair betting exchanges, DFS offered by FanDuel and Junglee Games and horse racing wagering offered under the TVG brand. We also offer business-to-business pricing and risk management services, where we earn revenues from providing these services to other businesses in our sector.\nOur Geographic Divisions\nAs at 31 December 2024, we offered our products in over 100 countries and had 13.9 million AMPs globally. For fiscal 2024, our U.S. division constituted 41% of our revenue, our UKI division constituted 26% of our revenue, our International division constituted 23% of our revenue and our Australian division constituted 10% of our revenue. As mentioned above, in the first quarter of 2025, the Company updated its internal reporting, including the information provided to the CODM to assess segment performance and allocate resources, and, as a result, will update its reportable segments for the fiscal year 2025. Following these changes, the Company will have two reportable segments: U.S. and International (which will include what was our UKI, International and Australia segments).\nUnited States\nOur U.S. division offers sports betting, casino, DFS and horse racing wagering products to players across various states in the United States, mainly online but with sports betting services also provided through a small number of retail outlets, and certain online products in the province of Ontario in Canada.\nThe U.S. division is our fastest growing and our largest division, constituting US$5,789 million (or 41%) of our revenue for fiscal 2024. For the year ended 31 December 2024, we had an approximately 44% share of the online sports betting market in the states where FanDuel sportsbook was live and an approximately 25% share of the iGaming market in states where FanDuel casino was live.\nFor fiscal 2024, the U.S. division consisted of: the FanDuel and TVG brands. As at 31 December 2024, our FanDuel online sportsbook was available in 23 states, our FanDuel online casino was available in 5 states, our FanDuel paid DFS offering was available in 44 states, our FanDuel or TVG online horse racing wagering product was available in 32 states and our FanDuel free-to-play products were available in all 50 states.\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, we offer sports betting (sportsbook), iGaming products (games, casino, bingo and poker) and other products (exchange betting) through our Sky Betting & Gaming, Paddy Power, Betfair and tombola brands. Although our UKI brands mostly operate online, this division also includes our 563 Paddy Power betting shops in the United Kingdom and Ireland as at 31 December 2024. Our UKI division constituted US$3,597 million (or 26%) of our revenue for fiscal 2024.\nInternational\nOur International division operates in over 100 global markets and offers sports betting, casino, poker, rummy and lottery, mainly online.\nSisal, the leading iGaming operator in Italy, is the largest brand in the International division following its acquisition in August 2022. The International division also includes PokerStars, Betfair International, Adjarabet, Junglee Games and most recently MaxBet.\nIn January 2024, we acquired an initial 51% controlling stake in MaxBet, a leading omni-channel sports betting and gaming operator in Serbia for a cash consideration of US$143 million (€131 million). The share purchase agreement includes call and put options to acquire the remaining 49% stake in 2029. We plan to continue to diversify internationally and take our online offering into regulated markets with a strong gambling culture and\na competitive tax framework under which we believe we have the ability to offer a broad betting and iGaming product range.\nIn addition, effective 1 January 2024, subsequent to our decision to close the sports betting platform FOX Bet, we reorganized how the PokerStars (U.S.) business is managed which resulted in a change in operating segment composition. From 1 January 2024, PokerStars (U.S.) is included in the International segment as opposed to the U.S. segment.\nOur International division constituted US$3,275 million (or 23%) of our revenue for fiscal 2024.\nAustralia\nIn Australia, we offer online sports betting products through our Sportsbet brand, which operates exclusively in Australia and offers a wide range of betting products and experiences across local and global horse racing, sports, entertainment and major events. Our Australia division constituted US$1,396 million (or 10%) of our revenue for fiscal 2024.\nSeasonality\nOur product offerings are subject to a largely predictable degree of seasonality, although the seasonality of each of these products does differ, thereby reducing the effect on an aggregate basis. In particular, a majority of our current U.S. sports betting and DFS revenue is and will continue to be generated from bets placed on, or contests relating to, the NFL, the NBA, MLB and the NCAA, each of which has its own respective off-seasons, which may cause decreases in our future revenues during such periods. The schedule of significant sporting events that do not occur annually, such as the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA European Football Championship and/or marquee boxing matches, affect the volumes of bets collected over the course of that period. Our sportsbook revenue is driven by a combination of the timing of sporting and other events and the results of our operations are derived from those events. While our iGaming revenue also benefits from activity around sporting events, it is less dependent on the sporting calendar. The overall effect of any individual sporting event is small due to the number of sporting events that take place in any given year and the diversity of our revenue source.\nMarketing\nOur ability to effectively acquire, engage and retain customers on our platform is critical to our operational and financial success. We believe that the combination of our brands with our data science and marketing analytics capabilities provide us with a strong competitive advantage in our industry. We utilize a variety of marketing channels, including paid external advertising through traditional and digital media, compelling new player and event-driven promotions and paid affiliate programs. We use proprietary models and software tools to track the efficacy of these marketing campaigns in real-time, giving us the ability to constantly evaluate and optimize our marketing strategies as necessary. Over time, our growth has also enabled our marketing efforts to benefit from economies of scale.\nWe also rely on successful cross-promotion across our product offerings and consequently have developed ways to minimize friction between our offerings. For example, our FanDuel Sportsbook app features an embedded iGaming offering in states where iGaming is permissible so players can play a subset of casino games without leaving the sportsbook app. Aside from traditional marketing channels, we also enter into select media, sports and entertainment partnerships that support and accelerate our long-term strategic initiatives. Where possible, we will enter into exclusive relationships to further align interests. We have also historically partnered with athletes and celebrities that share our values in order to promote our brand.
