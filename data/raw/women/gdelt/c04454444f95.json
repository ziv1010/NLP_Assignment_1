They are comfortably top of the table and are seven points clear of Sunday’s opponent in second.\nA victory for Chelsea would act as another significant statement in this season’s title race as the Blues look to make it six league titles in a row. As things stand, they are well on course to do so, while their form in the Champions League has also been extremely promising.\nHere is 90min's guide to the biggest game in the WSL this weekend…\nWhat time does Chelsea vs Arsenal kick-off?\n- Location: London, England\n- Stadium: Stamford Bridge\n- Date: Sunday 26 January\n- Kick-off time: 12:30 GMT / 7:30 ET / 4:30 PT\nChelsea vs Arsenal H2H record\n- Chelsea: 21 wins\n- Arsenal: 15 wins\n- Draws: 7\nCurrent form (all competitions)\nHow to watch Chelsea vs Arsenal on TV - UK & US\nChelsea team news\nChelsea remain without long-term absentees Sophie Ingle, Kadeisha Buchanan and Aniek Nouwen all recently suffered ACL injuries and will miss the remainder of the season. Sam Kerr and Mia Fishel sustained the same injury roughly 12 months ago, but are unlikely to return for this weekend’s game, with February or March a more realistic target.\nYoung defender Maelys Mpome was injured back in December but returned to the squad for the last WSL outing against West Ham. Wieke Kaptein and Lucy Bronze were both absent, however.\nChelsea predicted lineup vs Arsenal\nChelsea predicted lineup vs Arsenal (4-2-3-1): Hampton; Bronze, Bjorn, Bright, Charles; Cuthbert, Nusken; Kaneryd, Macario, Baltimore; Ramirez\nArsenal team news\nVictoria Pelova has been sidelined since the summer with an ACL injury, while Amanda Ilestedt is gearing up for a return following the birth of her first child. Renee Slegers confirmed this week that the pair have joined up with the team in training, but their exact return dates are still unknown.\nStina Blackstenius was absent last week against Crystal Palace due to illness, but is back in training this week. Lina Hurtig also missed their last WSL game and is participating in some of team training.\nArsenal predicted lineup vs Chelsea\nArsenal predicted lineup vs Chelsea (3-4-2-1): Van Domselaar; Fox, Williamson, Catley; Maanum, Little, Cooney-Cross, McCabe; Mead, Caldentey; Russo\nChelsea vs Arsenal score prediction\nAs is often the case between these two teams, it will no doubt be a tight and fiercely-contested game. The result will have significant implications on the title race as a victory for Arsenal will put them within four points of their rivals.\nChelsea, on the other hand, will be determined to extend their cushion at the top of the standings and their form has arguably been unwavering this season. Bompastor’s side are showing no signs of slowing down, so it is difficult to see anything other than a Chelsea win, especially at Stamford Bridge.",
