The FA’s 2020–2024 strategy clearly lays out its focus on home shores over the next few years. Under the vision ‘Unite the game, inspire the nation’, it has developed two separate objective channels: ‘change the game’ and ‘serve the game’.\nGame changer objectives\n- Win a major tournament\n- Serve two million+ people through a transformed digital platform\n- Ensure equal opportunities for every girl\n- Delivery of 5,000 quality pitches\n- A game free from discrimination\n- Maximise the appeal and revenue of the FA cups and Women’s Super League\nServe objectives\n\"Our vision remains to bring all parts of the game even closer together and leave a nation inspired. We have a unique ability to unite all parts of society.\"\n- Trusted, progressive regulation and administration\n- Safe and inclusive football pathways and environment\n- Personalised and connected learning experiences\n- Maximum investment into the game\n- Diverse, high-performing workforce and inclusive culture\n- World-class venues and events\n- Strong reputation and clear brand identity\n- Technology enabled and insight driven\nUsing its people and culture as the catalyst, The FA has already made great strides on its mission to rebuild itself into a world-class organisation: from doubling participation in the women's and girls’ game to registering more than 1 million grassroots players online – a material step into the digital age.\nThe new strategy aims to build on those strong foundations and its six game changer objectives reflect The FA’s purpose. To make the largest possible impact in the years ahead, there is a conviction to change the fabric of the game and tackle long-term issues, and while these are are unlikely to be solved within four years, working collaboratively with clarity can help make a tangible step in the right direction.\nWith major milestones on the near horizon – including 150 years of England teams and the FA Cup, ten years of St. George’s Park and 100 years of Wembley – the world’s first football association is ready to remind its nation of the sport’s remarkable power as a force for good.\nUEFA support\nAs is the case across Europe, the pandemic has had and continues to have an enormous financial impact in England, with significant revenue streams lost across broadcasting, sponsorship, events and hospitality. UEFA's HatTrick programme helped to fund the ongoing operational costs of Wembley Stadium and also contributed to upgrades to the famous ground that ensured it met UEFA EURO 2020 criteria and requirements.\nIn addition, HatTrick contributed to the pitch maintenance at England's UEFA EURO 2020 team base camp, the national training centre in Burton-upon-Trent, St George’s Park.\nUEFA Foundation for Children in England\nSet up in 2015, the UEFA Foundation uses football as a vehicle to help improve children’s lives by supporting hundreds of campaigns and projects across Europe and around the world.\nFinding My Potential\nThe project focuses on developing the skills of young people through the medium of football to improve their chances of success when moving into the job market. The city of Liverpool has a youth unemployment rate of 10.8% and the objectives of Finding My Potential include both developing employability and leadership in those aged 14-21, while also helping inactive 8-12 year-olds get involved in sport, improving their health and well-being.\nTeam-building sessions, conflict resolution, training courses on the CARE (creativity, aspiration, resilience, empathy) model of leadership, nurture groups and several related qualifications and certificates are all part of the project's mix of activities.\nBy achieving a coaching and officiating qualification, followed by valuable work experience in a supportive environment, it is hoped young people will not only develop their confidence but also gain access to employment opportunities in their local community.\nTimeline\nAssociation history\nNational team history\nChair\nDebbie Hewitt\nNationality: British\nDate of birth: 31 August 1963\nAssociation chair since: 2022\nCEO\nMark Bullingham\nNationality: British\nDate of birth: 2 November 1974\nAssociation CEO since: 2019",
