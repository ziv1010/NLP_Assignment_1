And who will own TNT Sports?\"\nBT Group still hold 50% at present. But it is working on a deal to sell its remaining share to Warner Bros Discovery. That, at least, would make a future sale more straightforward.\nIn that scenario, one possibility would be that TNT Sports is bought by or merged into another company as part of any takeover process.\nAnd this is where the Netflix intrigue comes to the fore.\nWarner Bros favours Netflix offer over $108bn Paramount bid\n- Published18 December 2025\n'A nightmare' - The battle over Warner Bros is turning Hollywood upside down\n- Published14 December 2025\nNetflix and Paramount are battling for Warner Bros. Who is likely to win?\n- Published3 days ago\nWhy the Netflix deal could be seismic for sport\nThe next couple of years will change the TV landscape in the UK.\nITV is in \"preliminary\" discussions to sell its broadcasting business to Sky for £1.6bn.\nFierce competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+ has left ITV and Sky needing to react.\nWill they also find themselves competing with Netflix in the sports market?\nAll the indications would suggest that may well be the case, although there is scepticism of just how much ambition its executives hold here.\nNetflix has previously dipped its toe in, with 'entertainment' boxing fights such as Mike Tyson v Jake Paul.\nIt was said to be in the running for the Champions League rights won by Paramount.\nNetflix has secured the rights to the 2027 and 2031 Women's World Cups in the USA - the first time the company had bought the rights to a sports competition in full.\nFifa president Gianni Infantino hailed Netflix as \"a marquee brand and Fifa's new long-term partner\".\nThat was underlined on Wednesday when Fifa announced it had partnered with Netflix to produce the video game for the 2026 World Cup.\nNetflix also signed up Gary Lineker's The Rest is Football podcast for next year's men's World Cup.\nA set round of Premier League matches, like Amazon Prime used to have, would be more in keeping with the Netflix business model. Up until now at least.\nPaolo Pescatore, tech media and telco analyst for PP Foresight, believes TNT Sports could provide \"fast-track access\" into the competitive sports rights arena in the UK.\n\"Entertainment has served a purpose for Netflix up until now, but they realise the whole notion of live programming drives viewers to tune in to that moment,\" he said.\nHowever Godard suggested: \"If TNT Sports UK is part of it, they [Netflix] haven't thought very much about it yet.\"\nWarner Bros Discovery is in the process of splitting the company into two parts.\nNetflix recently agreed to buy the streaming and studios parts of the business, which TNT Sports in the UK is part of.\nHowever, TNT Sports' US business is not in the deal, creating uncertainty about Netflix's intentions.\nThe press release to announce the Netflix deal made no mention of TNT Sports. All the talk was of TV behemoth HBO and the cinematic arm.\nWhen BBC Sport spoke to Warner Bros Discovery, it would make no comment on the future of TNT Sports or confirm its role in the deal.\nHow does Paramount fit into this?\nParamount Skydance has tried to muscle in by making a higher offer direct to Warner Bros Discovery shareholders.\nThe takeover would be more straightforward because the offer is for the whole of the business.\nBut on Wednesday Warner Bros Discovery told its shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance's $108.4bn (£80.8bn) bid.\nParamount appears the more obvious bedfellow for TNT Sports.\nIt has already shown clear intent in the sports rights market, including football and UFC, and has Champions League rights in the US under its CBS brand. From 2027 it will own the competition in the UK, too.\nPescatore says \"there's been an open chequebook\" at Paramount, which paid a premium for Champions League rights at more than £1bn across four years.\nThat kind of ambition would grab the attention of rights holders.\nWhat would it mean for fans?\nSky Sports, TNT Sports, Premier Sports, Disney+ and DAZN are already players in the UK subscription market.\nFrom 2027, add in Paramount for the Champions League - unless there are mergers before then.\nBidding will open on the next cycle of Premier League rights in the UK in 2027.\nThe 2025-29 deal was worth £6.7bn. Will there be a new, ambitious player?\nGodard says \"nobody has the economics\" to challenge Sky Sports at present.\n\"I'm sure the Premier League would hope that the new layout of ownership will increase the appetite,\" Godard said.\nThe Premier League rights in the US, held by NBC, expire in 2028. This could provide an early indication of the intentions of Netflix and Paramount.\nPescatore suggests interest from Disney+ cannot be ruled out.\nDisney+ already has the rights to the Women's Champions League across the whole of Europe and the Saturday night La Liga game in the UK.\nOr could something completely different be the future?\nOne suggestion is the Premier League could choose to launch its own direct-to-consumer channel, dubbed \"Premflix\", to distribute some of the games itself.\nWhat is clear is that viewers can expect more changes to how they watch sport.\nRelated topics\n- Published17 October 2025\n- Published16 August 2025",
