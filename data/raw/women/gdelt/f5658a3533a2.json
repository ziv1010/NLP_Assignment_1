  "body_text": "Earlier today (Friday), two of Chelsea’s longer-serving squad members confirmed their departures from the club at the end of the current campaign, with Zećira Mušović joining Sophie Ingle in bidding farewell to the Blues on the final weekend of the WSL season.\nSophie Ingle, Zećira Mušović to leave Chelsea FC Women at the end of the season\nFarewells\nThough they have not played much of late, both have played big parts in our successes in recent seasons. Ingle has been out since the summer when she tore an ACL in a preseason match while Mušović had made just six appearances, most of them in the Champions League group stage, before announcing her pregnancy in February. It sounds like she will be committing herself fully to that new “challenge”.\n“I have grown immensely in this environment as a goalkeeper and a person. It is safe to say these years [at Chelsea] have maybe been the ones with the most impact on my personal growth, and it is all thanks to the people around me. The players. The staff. The supporters. And everyone in between.\n“As most of you already know, I am growing another human inside of me. It is a chapter I am ready to embrace thanks to you all. Another challenge I am ready to face.”\n-Zećira Mušović; source: Chelsea FC\nMušović, 28, joined Chelsea in the 2020-21 winter transfer window and would go on to make 51 appearances for the club in those 4.5 years — though many of us might remember her best for that absolutely ridiculous performance she put in for Sweden against the USWNT at the 2023 World Cup.\nIngle, 33, first joined Chelsea back in 2012, though only briefly, leaving after just a couple seasons. She would return in 2018 and quickly become an important part of the squad, setting career highs for appearances (33) and goals (5) in 2022-23. At the start of the next season, she would become the all-time leader for appearances in the Women’s Super League (with Ingle sidelined, that was broken by Jordan Nobbs earlier this season). She leaves with eleven trophies in those six years.\nThe veteran midfielder isn’t ready to hang up her boots just yet however, targeting the Euros this summer with Wales and then “hopefully [...] find a team [and] get back playing and enjoying football after such a long injury.”\nThanks for everything, Sophie and Z!",
