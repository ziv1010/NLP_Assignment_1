  "body_text": "EA FC 25 Career Mode new features – women's football, youth academy overhaul, and playable Icons\nCareer Mode fans are in for a treat in EA FC 25, with some big changes finally being made to the fan-favourite game mode\nEA FC 25 will see the biggest changes made to Career Mode in years, with many new features being added in both Manager and Player Career Mode.\nA game mode that has seemingly been ignored by EA Sports in recent times, Career Mode is something of a sleeping giant. Over the last few years, minimal changes have been made to Career Mode when a new game is released, and it's then left alone for the remainder of the game cycle, leaving its passionate fan base with little to work with.\nThere's so much potential in Career Mode that is left untouched, but in EA FC 25 Career Mode, it seems the game mode is finally getting the attention it deserves. The first EA FC 25 announcements are starting to be made, with Jude Bellingham confirmed as the EA FC 25 cover star.\nDetails regarding Ultimate Team have also been revealed, but EA FC 25 Career Mode is getting more major updates than EA's money-maker, and it's extremely exciting.\nREAD MORE: I played EA FC 25 early and it has nice new features – but copy and paste gameplay is a big concernREAD MORE: EA FC 25 Ultimate Edition cover revealed with Jude Bellingham and new Ultimate Team IconEA FC 25 Career Mode: big changes made, and for the better\nFor the first time in a long time, big changes are being made to Career Mode, but they are all meaningful, rather than a few random additions that don't make much of a difference. And, attention is being paid to both Manager and Player Career Mode in EA FC 25, giving fans of both modes something to look forward to.\nEA FC 25 Live Start Points\nFor the first time, EA is introducing a way to play Career Mode based on the real-life season, meaning the game mode will be updated regularly throughout the 2024/25 season. EA FC 25 Live Start Points will update weekly with up-to-date results, fixtures, and standings, with players able to jump into the real-life campaign from whatever point they like.\nFor example, say that somehow, Celta Vigo are top of La Liga at the end of December. Well, you can jump into the game and take control of the Spanish side with all results and fixtures up to date to try and lead them to glory. This works across both Manager Career and Player Career.\nThe leagues and cup competitions supported in this mode are the Premier League, Champions League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, Women's Champions League, Coppa Italia, FA Cup, and many more. Just a little flex of EA's unrivalled authenticity. Live Start Points won't feature in EA FC 25 at launch, with EA wanting the real-life season to develop before making this mode available.\nPlayer Career with Icons\nEA has taken a step away from authenticity and more into the world of fantasy with its latest Career Mode addition, with a handful of Icons now available to use in Player Career Mode. From launch, Andrea Pirlo, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Kelly Smith, and Thierry Henry will be available to use, while players who pre-order the Ultimate Edition will be able to use Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, and David Beckham as well. This is a really fun addition that I can't wait to try!\nWomen's football is finally here\nAfter being added to Ultimate Team in EA FC 24, women's players are now available to use in Career Mode. Playable in both Manager and Player mode, control teams or players from the Women's Super League, NWSL, D1 Arkemma, Liga F, and the Frauen-Bundesliga, while also being able to compete in the Women's Champions League.\nTo adapt to the women's game, there will also be different financial tasks in women's Career Mode, such as negotiating shorter contracts, dealing with tighter budgets, battling for players in a smaller player pool, and much more. Although it's the same game, it offers a different type of Career Mode challenge, which could prove pretty exciting.\nFC IQ - tactics galore\nOut of all the game modes in EA FC 25, FC IQ will probably work best in Manager Career Mode. FC IQ has completely changed how tactics work in EA FC 25, with two new factors, Player Roles and Team Tactics, being added to the game.\nYou can create your own tactical set-up or use the tactics of a manager already in the game, and hiring coaches seems to be way more beneficial in FC 25 Career Mode thanks to FC IQ. For example, Manchester City will set up in the tiki-taka style, with Erling Haaland playing with the false nine Player Role.\nBut, Haaland's most familiar Player Role isn't false nine, meaning he won't perform as well in this system. In FC 25, hiring coaches who know tiki-taka will make Haaland familiar with the false nine role, improving how he plays in the squad and how well your team will perform.\nRevamped youth academy\nEA has listened to community feedback following EA FC 24, and the youth scouting network has been improved massively, with over 90 new countries available to send scouts to, taking the total number of countries available for scouting to a whopping 160. You can now select up to four positions and three focus roles to look for when sending a scout away, helping improve the player pool of young talents you get your scout report back.\nAnd, for the first time, your youth academy will be playable in Career Mode, meaning you can now play and develop your young talents without sending them on loan or using them in your first team. Using the new Rush game mode, you can use your youth players in a 5v5 game in youth tournaments every two months, either with their current overall rating or with their potential rating.\nYes, that's right. If you're youth prospects have potential ratings of 91 overall, you can play with them at that rating to get a feel of how they could play if they fulfilled their potential. If you win the tournaments, the development rate will increase quicker than usual. A pretty cool feature if you ask me!\nEA has also improved the accuracy of young players' appearances, meaning no more 15-year-olds with beards and receding hairlines.\nPlayer Origins - what's your story?\nNot only are you able to customise your player looks-wise more than ever in EA FC 25 thanks to EA Cranium, but you can now choose your player's background story in Player Career Mode, helping shape your origin story and how your player acts in-game.\nThere are multiple origin stories to choose from in EA FC 25, with each one deciding your personality and also positively and negatively impacting certain stats. Are you the child of a former footballing legend with all the pressure on your shoulders, or have you worked your way up from nothing, playing on the streets, to finally get your shot at success?\nHere We Go! New social media feature\nThe social media feature in Career Mode has been updated, with the social bar taking more of an Instagram-like approach, with official accounts even making comments for you to look at. And, just like in real life, EA has signed transfer guru Fabrizio Romano to the game, with some transfer news set to break in the social media bar from the man himself, joined by his trademark 'Here We Go'.\nSome more news outlets are expected to also be involved when the game is released, helping add to the authenticity.\nMore improvement to Customisation\nTo try and make simulation gameplay more realistic, players can customise the likes of weather effects in-game and how much of an impact they can have. For example, windy conditions will impact the ball trajectory, while rainy conditions will see players slip more often, and even make your defensive keep a tighter shape to avoid any errors in the wet.\nAI Behavior is also being added into EA FC 25 Career Mode, meaning the AI will adapt to certain tactical set-ups differently to offer more of a challenge. For example, if you play a low block against Liverpool's usual tactics, the Liverpool AI may opt to change formation, act more aggressively, or take more shots from outside the box. If you play the same team 10 times, you'll likely be up against a new challenge 10 times.\nMatch introductions have also been added back to the game, the morale meter has been overhauled, new tactical vision press conference systems will be introduced, and there will be a new UI, helping cut down on menu surfing and putting all your managerial tasks in one place to make sure you don't fall behind.",
