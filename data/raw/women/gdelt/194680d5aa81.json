I think the British people will still show more sense on Thursday, still draw back from the brink.”\nMr Johnson warned of a Labour majority “pregnant with horrors” hours after the latest poll suggested that though the Tories have narrowed the gap on Labour slightly to 19 points, Sir Keir’s party is heading for a vast majority in the Commons. Another new poll suggested the Tories would win just 64 seats.\nSuella Braverman has declared the election battle “over”, saying the fight to save the Conservatives from extinction must now begin.\nMr Johnson’s appearance came after The Telegraph revealed how the Tory campaign was turning to the former prime minister in the final weeks to play an increased role to win over Conservative waverers.\nHe was cheered by the audience as he said Labour would make the UK “nothing but the punk of Brussels” by reintroducing free movement and copying EU laws.\nSir Keir, he said, was a “disciple” of Jeremy Corbyn. “At the very moment when this country has beaten Covid and beaten post-Covid inflation, at the very moment when we should be encouraging enterprise, and growth, and putting money back into people’s pockets – Westminster is about to lurch in diametrically the wrong direction,” he said.\nHe went on: “Five years ago you helped to send Jeremy Corbyn and his then disciple Keir Starmer into orbit – and we got Brexit done…and is it not the height of insanity, if these polls are right, we are about to give Labour a supermajority which they will use to make us nothing but the punk of Brussels – taking EU law, but with no say in how it is made, paying into Brussels budgets again.\n“You watch – scrapping the Rwanda scheme just as it is on the verge of coming into force, just as it is being imitated by governments across the world, just as it is actually beginning to act as a deterrent and bringing back uncontrolled free movement as the price of Starmer’s deal with the EU. Does this country really want to give Starmer that kind of mandate?”\nTaking aim at Reform UK and its leader Nigel Farage, he warned people against voting for parties that “turn out to be full of Kremlin crawlers who actually make excuses for Putin’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine”.\n“They say Putin’s a good operator, runs a tight ship,” he said. “And if that’s what they mean by a man who shoots journalists and poisons his opponents and murders thousands of innocent Ukrainian civilians – I say shame on them.\n“They can achieve nothing in this election except to usher in the most Left-wing Labour government since the war, with a huge majority, and we must not let it happen. Don’t let the Putinistas deliver the Corbynistas.”\nMr Sunak thanked his former boss as he followed him on stage, saying: “I’ve got to thank Boris for being here, thank him for his support. Isn’t it great?”\nHe added that “Boris is right to say now is the time for all Conservatives to come together”, saying: “Just think, it was just the other day when Keir Starmer was saying that Jeremy Corbyn would have been a better Prime Minister than Boris. That is shameful!”\nMr Johnson’s intervention came as Mrs Braverman said the party needed to rediscover its “soul” and move back to the Right if it is to reconnect with voters.\nWriting for The Telegraph, she warned failure to change course would “allow Starmer a clear run at destroying our country for good”.\nShe also highlighted the threat of Reform UK, saying that the Tories were “haemorrhaging votes” to Nigel Farage’s party after moving too close to the centre.\nHer comments coincided with a new opinion poll by Redfield and Wilton that showed the gap to Labour slightly narrowing, and a drop in support for Reform. However, Sir Keir’s party is still leading the Tories by 19 points, leaving it on course for a comfortable majority on Thursday.\nMrs Braverman, a fierce critic of Mr Sunak who resigned from his Cabinet over his stance on illegal migration, has been touted as a future leadership contender if the Conservatives are consigned to opposition.\nMeanwhile, in an interview with The Telegraph, Mel Stride, the Work and Pensions Secretary, said Labour would also repeat the mistakes of the Blair era and send the benefits bill “spiralling out of control”.\nJoin the conversation in the comments section.\n11:00 PM BST\nThat’s all for tonight\nThank you for following our live coverage of the general election campaign.

Don’t let the Putinistas deliver the Corbynistas.”\n10:19 PM BST\nGove denies that Johnson ‘upstaged’ Sunak\nMichael Gove has denied that Boris Johnson “upstaged” Rishi Sunak with his election speech.\nAsked by The Sun after the speech if the Prime Minister had been “upstaged”, Mr Gove said: “No, I think it was a great team effort.”\n10:13 PM BST\nLib Dems attack ‘insult’ of Johnson speech\nThe Liberal Democrats have attacked Boris Johnson’s Conservative election rally speech as an “insult”.\nDaisy Cooper, the party’s deputy leader, said: “This is an insult to everyone who made heartbreaking sacrifices during the pandemic.\n“Rishi Sunak has reached a desperate new low, turning to a man who discredited the office of Prime Minister and lied to the country time after time.\n“It is time to boot out this tired and sleaze-ridden Conservative Party, and elect Liberal Democrat MPs who will stand up for their communities.”\n10:06 PM BST\nDo not surrender to Labour, Sunak says as he closes speech\nRishi Sunak has closed his speech by urging voters not to “surrender to Labour”.\n“As we come to the end of this election, our message is clear, it is only our Conservative Party that can deliver the financial security that families need with tax cuts, it is only our Conservative Party that shares people’s values of hard work, of aspiration, of opportunity, of security,” Mr Sunak said.\n“It is only our Conservative Party that will stand up for everyone. So I say this again, do not surrender to Labour.\n“Let’s get out there and fight for every vote. Let’s fight for our values. Let’s fight for our vision of Britain.”\n10:02 PM BST\nSunak attacks Labour on national security and gender ideology\nRishi Sunak has attacked Labour on national security, energy policy and gender ideology.\n“The person who would be our deputy prime minister, our Foreign Secretary, the people who would deputise for him [Sir Keir Starmer] on national security don’t even believe in our nuclear deterrent,” Mr Sunak said.\n“When it comes to our energy security, they will be in hock to ideological environmental extremists, making us more reliant on foreign energy and saddling people with thousands of pounds of bills.\n“And when it comes to protecting our women and girls spaces and services, they will not do that because, unlike us Conservatives, they simply do not understand that sex means biological sex.”\n10:00 PM BST\nTories rescued Britain from ‘Labour’s bankruptcy’\nRishi Sunak has turned to praise Lord Cameron’s record in office.\n“There’s been a lot of talk about our collective record over the past 14 years in this campaign,” Mr Sunak said. “I will tell you this: in 2010 starting with David’s leadership, we rescued this country from Labour’s bankruptcy.\n“Under David’s leadership, we took that awful inheritance, and what have we delivered? As you heard from Michael, the third fastest growth in the G7, 800 jobs a day created, restored our financial security and public finances so we could support the country through Covid, through the energy bill crisis.\n“We’ve halved crime. We’ve made sure that our school children under Michael’s reforms are the best educated in the Western world. We introduced the triple lock for pensioners.”\n09:57 PM BST\nPictured: Lord Cameron arrives at speech\n09:56 PM BST\nElection result is not a foregone conclusion, says Sunak\nThe result of the election is not a “foregone conclusion”, Rishi Sunak has said.\n“It seems lots of people are saying that the result of this election is a foregone conclusion,” he said.\n“But I know that it is just 130,000 people switching their vote, giving us their support is what it will take to deny Labour that super majority they want.\n“Every single vote matters, and that is why I know you are tired. I know you have worked hard, but we have got to give it one more push.”\n09:55 PM BST\nSunak thanks Johnson: ‘Isn’t it great to have our Conservative family united?’\nRishi Sunak has thanked Boris Johnson for introducing him at a central London campaign rally.\nThe Prime Minister said: “Isn’t it great to have our Conservative family united, my friends?\n“Just think, it was just the other day when Keir Starmer was saying that Jeremy Corbyn would have been a better Prime Minister than Boris. That is shameful!”\nHe added: “Can you imagine what that would have meant for Ukraine, what would have meant for our country’s security, our defence, the damage it would have done to our economy in both 2017 and 2019?\n“Keir Starmer put his personal ambition ahead of our country’s national interest, and that is just one of the many reasons that over the next 48 hours, we must do everything we can to stop him getting into No 10.”\n09:52 PM BST\nLabour will bring ‘mandatory wokery’, says Johnson\nLabour will bring in “mandatory wokery”, Boris Johnson has said.\n“If you actually want higher taxes next week, if you feel you’ve got a few £1,000 to spare, then vote Labour on Thursday.\n“If you want uncontrolled immigration and mandatory wokery, kowtowing to Brussels again, then go right ahead, make my day, vote for Starmer.\n“But if you want to protect our democracy and our economy and keep this country strong abroad by spending 2.5 per cent of our GDP on defence , which Labour still refuses to commit to, then you know what to do.”\n09:50 PM BST\nStarmer to turn Britain into ‘punk of Brussels’\nBoris Johnson has said Sir Keir Starmer will turn Britain into the “punk of Brussels”.\nSpeaking in central London, Mr Johnson said: “Is it not, therefore, the height of insanity, if these polls are right, that we are about to give Labour a super majority, which they will use to make us nothing but the punk of Brussels, taking EU law by dictation with no say on how that law is made?”\nHe added: “And yet, Labour are so cocky that they’re barely, they’re barely, they’re so complacent, they’re so slug, they’re barely concealing their agenda anymore.\n“And we can see what it is: racking up taxes on pensions, on property, persecuting private enterprise, attacking private education and private healthcare, with all the pointless extra burden that will place on the taxpayer.\n“And all the time, poor old Starmer is so terrified of disobeying Left-wing dogma that he’s reluctant to explain the difference between a man and a woman. And he just, he just sits there with his mouth opening and shouting like a stunned mullet.”\n09:46 PM BST\nJohnson: My differences with Sunak ‘utterly trivial’ compared to risk of Starmer\nBoris Johnson has said his differences with Rishi Sunak are “utterly trivial” compared to the risk of Sir Keir Starmer becoming Prime Minister.\n“If you’re slightly surprised to see me, if you’re slightly surprised, I’m really, absolutely clear that I was glad when Rishi asked me to help,” Mr Johnson said.\n“Of course, I couldn’t say no, and I’m here for one reason and one reason only, which is the same reason as all of you, all of us are here. We’re here because we love our country.\n“Whatever our differences, they are utterly trivial by comparison with the disaster we may face if the so called opinion polls are right.”\n09:44 PM BST\nWatch: Conservative rally\nLIVE: STOP THE SUPERMAJORITY https://t.co/UKFFVUdCQH\n— Conservatives (@Conservatives) July 2, 2024\n09:42 PM BST\nStarmer is a ‘jellyfish’, says Gove\nSir Keir Starmer is a “jellyfish”, Michael Gove has said.\n“He’s a man who twice, twice, argued that Jeremy Corbyn should be our prime minister,” he said.\n“This Corbyn-hugging, tax-raising, referendum-denying, flip-flopping apology for a leader should never be allowed anywhere near No 10.”\n09:39 PM BST\nGove lists Tory achievements\nMichael Gove has listed the Conservatives’ achievements in Government since 2010.\n“We reformed welfare to make work pay,” he told a central London rally. “We cut crime. We built more than two million homes. We had the best Olympics ever. We were the greenest government ever.\n“We took millions out of tax. We got Brexit done. We rolled out with furlough, the best programme for the vulnerable during Covid. We had the fastest vaccine rollout anywhere in the world. We were the first country out of lockdown.\n“We stood shoulder to shoulder with Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine. We stood up for freedom. We stood up for liberty. We stood up for democracy.

We don’t know where it will lie within that range but that does look like the range within which it’s likely to lie.\n“Any figure within that range would represent the worst Conservative result in its history.”\n08:34 PM BST\nLabour inheritance tax policy will ‘redistribute’ family money, leaked recording reveals\nLabour is considering an inheritance tax raid to “redistribute” wealth if it gets into power, a leaked recording of a shadow frontbencher suggests.\nDarren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, told a public meeting he expected the “political consensus” to be that inheritance tax (IHT) should be used to address “intergenerational inequality”.\nIt comes at the end of an election campaign in which tax has been the key battleground, with the Tories claiming households will pay more than £2,000 extra under Labour.\nLabour has consistently refused to rule out increases to inheritance tax, capital gains tax or council tax, having said the party will not put up income tax, VAT or National Insurance if it gets into power.\nRead the full story from Associate Editor Gordon Rayner here.\n08:10 PM BST\nTories to slump to record low in Wales, poll predicts\nThe Conservatives will slump to a record low vote share in Wales at the general election, a poll has suggested.\nThe survey of 3,439 adults by Barn Cymru was conducted between June 19 and 30.\nIt predicted that the Tories will win just 16 per cent of the vote in Wales on Thursday, lower than in 1997 when it won no MPs in the country.\nIt would be equal to Reform UK, who are also on 16 per cent, and the Tories’ worst election performance in Wales since 1918.\nThe poll put Labour on 40 per cent, the Tories and Reform on 16 each, Plaid Cymru on 14, the Lib Dems on seven and the Green Party on five.\n07:50 PM BST\nScots Labour leader rejects SNP pact to oust Ross\nThe leader of Scottish Labour has rejected a call by the SNP’s Stephen Flynn to back his party’s candidate in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East to oust Douglas Ross.\nMr Sarwar said the constituency’s voters should still vote Labour despite the party’s candidate.

It’s not about any of our individual aspirations. It’s about campaigning for a Conservative government come Friday and to win as many seats as we possibly can as a party.”\n07:06 PM BST\nTories to win just 64 seats, MRP poll predicts\nThe Conservatives will win just 64 seats at the general election, a new MRP poll has predicted.\nThe survey of 34,558 voters by Survation gave Labour a majority of 159.\nSir Keir Starmer’s party was predicted to win 484 seats – a larger return than Sir Tony Blair’s 418 in 1997.\nThe Tories were forecast to only narrowly become Britain’s official opposition with 64 MPs, just three more than the Liberal Democrats on 61.\nSurvation also predicted that Reform MPs will be returned in just seven seats despite the party winning more votes nationwide than any other except Labour and the Conservatives.\n06:57 PM BST\nFarage sympathises with Greens over candidate issues\nNigel Farage has sympathised with the Green Party for having candidates exposed as making anti-Semitic and anti-Israel comments.\nSpeaking to Channel 5, the Reform UK leader said his party was a “start-up party” and that offensive remarks made by more than a dozen candidates were “teething problems”.\n“I think we and the Greens suffer from it yes, because I think for us and the Greens fielding over 600 candidates was a very, very difficult thing to do with a snap election,” he said.\n06:43 PM BST\nI do not want to join the Tories, Farage says\nNigel Farage has said he does not want to join the Conservatives.\nThe Reform UK leader told Channel 5 that the party was “not the sort of club I want to join” when asked if he would join in the future.\nHe added: “The problem with the Westminster journalistic pack is they think being elected only matters inside that chamber in Westminster.\n“As I rather proved I think back in 1999 – when three of us got elected to the European Parliament and built a mass movement across the country on an issue that was unfashionable – however many of us get elected to that Parliament, yes, we’ll be there, but more importantly, we’ll build a mass movement across the country.”\n06:37 PM BST\nZahawi defends Starmer over 6pm Friday finish\nNadhim Zahawi has defended Sir Keir Starmer for saying he would want to finish work at 6pm on Fridays if he became Prime Minister.\n“As a father of three children, and the youngest being 11 years old, I actually admire a politician who says, ‘Actually, I will take time to spend with my family’,” the former Chancellor told Al Arabiya English.\n“I think it’s an unfair criticism of Keir Starmer. He’s been leader of the opposition. Like most of us in politics will work all hours for their constituency and then if they are fortunate enough to be appointed to Government and hold high office.\n“So I think it’s an unfair criticism.

There are much bigger election issues.\n“It is perfectly normal for people to seek a work-life balance of some sort. If there is a serious point within all this is, it is really hard to do that if you are the prime minister or any other senior minister.\n“If I had said as foreign secretary, the four and a half years that I was doing that job, ‘Friday at 6 o’clock I am not going to do anything’ or any day after 6 o’clock, that would soon have been shattered. That wouldn’t have lasted a week.”\nAsked if things were better today than they were then in terms of work-life balance for senior politicians, Lord Hague said: “No, they are probably worse actually than then because now you have social media, you have to have a very quick response to anything that happens in the world… and also we are living in a more dangerous world.”\n09:32 AM BST\nStarmer: Trans women don’t have the right to use women-only lavatories\nSir Keir Starmer has said transgender women do not have a right to access female-only spaces, amid confusion over Labour’s stance on which lavatories trans people should use.\nThe Labour leader said biological males who have legally transitioned should not enter areas designated for women, insisting those spaces “need to be protected”.\nHis comments came after two of his frontbenchers refused to say whether someone with a penis should be allowed to use women’s lavatories.\nYou can read the full story here.\n09:14 AM BST\nTories attack Labour on small boats issue\nIllegal migrants are waiting for a Starmer supermajority.\nVote Conservative to stop this. pic.twitter.com/a397xLHdIj— Conservatives (@Conservatives) July 2, 2024\n09:03 AM BST\nFailing on NHS waiting lists my worst moment, suggests Sunak\nRishi Sunak suggested his worst moment as Prime Minister had been his failure to deliver on his pledge to bring down NHS waiting lists.\nAsked for his “worst moment” as premier, Mr Sunak told BBC Breakfast: “This is a difficult job, of course it’s a difficult job and when I can’t make as much progress as I would like on the things that matter to me and matter to the country of course that’s disappointing.\n“On the NHS waiting list, for example, particularly coming from an NHS family as I do, I was just at a pharmacy yesterday talking about growing up in my mum’s pharmacy working with her and helping her and working to support her patients, so that has been disappointing not to have been able to make more progress on NHS waiting lists in spite of record funding we’re putting in, but we are now making progress.”\n08:51 AM BST\nSunak denies he got Tory election campaign wrong\nRishi Sunak rejected the suggestion that he had got the Conservative Party’s general election campaign wrong.\nHe told BBC Breakfast: “No. Actually, everywhere I have been going people are waking up to the dangers of what a Labour government would mean for them particularly when it comes to taxes.”\nAsked why the polls had not moved since the start of the campaign, with Labour consistently around 20 points ahead, he said: “My job is to focus on the substance.\n“It is to explain to people that if I am fortunate enough to continue as their Prime Minister, what will I do for them?

What I would say is that lots of people, if they look at the press, they might think the election is a foregone conclusion.\n“Actually, it’s a relatively small amount of voters across the country – about 130,000 people have been estimated – who can make the difference in this election.”\nAsked by presenter Nick Ferrari whether those voters could bring about a Tory victory, she said: “There’s quite a lot of seats that are very, very marginal, Nick.

I don’t think that is a fair summary of what’s going on this morning, actually.\n“I think Labour’s setting out its vision and the Conservative Party is slinging mud and attacking this nonsensical idea of a super-majority, because they can’t defend their own record.\n“They will just lie about Labour and they will lie about Labour’s plans.

That is going to be difficult but we’ve got a serious plan to make sure we get there.”\n08:02 AM BST\nTice: Need for ‘complete realignment of the Right of politics’\nRichard Tice said “there has to be a complete realignment of the Right of politics” and the Tories should not be “rewarded” for their “failure” on July 4.\nThe Reform UK chairman told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “Labour is going to win this election but the Tories’ desperation, creating a culture of fear, people are just sick of it.\n“You cannot reward failure, people want a new approach, a common sense approach, that is what we stand for and that is why we are going to surprise everybody on the upside with millions and millions of votes on Friday morning.”\n07:48 AM BST\nRichard Tice and Nick Robinson clash during BBC interview\nRichard Tice and Nick Robinson clashed at the start of a BBC interview as the Reform UK chairman accused the presenter of repeating “absolute nonsense” about the party.\nMr Robinson set up the interview with Mr Tice on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme by saying that Nigel Farage’s hopes of leading a “revolt” could be “dashed if voters are turned off by the violently extreme views of an ever-growing number of Reform UK’s candidates”.\nMr Tice said: “Let me tell you, on the doors where I am campaigning support is absolutely rock solid like we have never known before.\n“People are not buying into this absolute nonsense being perpetrated.”\n07:44 AM BST\nMinisters ‘urgently’ investigating postal vote ballot delays\nThe postal affairs minister is “urgently” investigating delays to postal ballots being delivered, Maria Caulfield has said.\nKevin Hollinrake has criticised Royal Mail for failing to deliver some ballots in time for the general election.\nMs Caulfield, a health minister, told Sky News this morning: “Kevin is taking this very seriously. He’s in direct contact with the Royal Mail.\n“It doesn’t seem to be an issue in my constituency, but I know a number of colleagues where people haven’t received their postal votes and are worried about that.\n“Kevin is investigating this urgently. I know there’s extra resources going into this to try and do a sweep of all the sorting offices and make sure they’re out there.\n“If people have only just received their postal vote, they can take it to their polling station on election day and it will still be counted.”\n07:30 AM BST\nSNP accuses Labour and Tories of ‘conspiracy of silence’ on cuts\nStephen Flynn, the SNP’s leader in Westminster, accused the Tories and Labour of a “conspiracy of silence on £18 billion of cuts that are coming down the line”.\nHe told BBC Breakfast this morning: “We need to reject that austerity, we need to see a return to the European single market, we need to see increased migration to boost our public services and of course our business sector.”\nMr Flynn said voters on July 4 should “vote for what it is that they believe in”.\nEconomic experts have accused both the main parties of not being clear about how they would handle the public finances in the future amid concerns they will have no choice but to choose between tax rises, more borrowing or cuts to services.\n07:26 AM BST\nPictured: Lord Cameron campaigns alongside Alex Chalk in Cheltenham\n07:16 AM BST\nBig Labour majority would be ‘better for the country’, claims Starmer\nSir Keir Starmer argued winning a big majority would be “better for the country”, as the Tories continue to urge voters to proceed with caution on July 4 and not hand Labour a “blank cheque”.\nWith just two days to go until polling day, Rishi Sunak has repeated the warning that Labour could achieve a “supermajority”, allowing the party to raise taxes, which he claimed is in its DNA.\nBut in an interview with The Times, Sir Keir said he needed a “strong mandate” to reform the planning system and improve the economy.\nAsked if he was saying the bigger a majority, the better, he told the newspaper: “Better for the country.

He hasn’t even got to bother about his own backbenchers.\n“He can pretty much do what he likes based on the technocratic advice he might be getting from the civil service.\n“And that could become quite quickly, quite divorced from the demos, from the public and what they want to see.”\n06:34 AM BST\nEx-minister: July 4 was ‘big gamble’ for Sunak and it hasn’t paid off\nRishi Sunak’s “big gamble” of triggering an early general election on July 4 has not paid off, a former Tory Cabinet minister has suggested.\nGeorge Eustice, the ex-environment secretary who is not standing at the election, told GB News: “I think for this [election] it’s been particularly difficult for the Conservative Party, because they’ve gone into it on the ropes, 20 points behind in the polls, having already spent two years trying to change those fortunes and get some momentum behind the party, without success.\n“[The Conservatives were] taking a big gamble that an election would shake things up and close the gap and there isn’t much evidence of that happening to date.\n“So I think it’s very difficult for the party to fight this election, but all they can do is get in the saddle every day, ride into battle and keep fighting.”\n06:30 AM BST\nSunak starts penultimate day of campaign with 4.30am warehouse visit\nRishi Sunak started campaigning at a crisp 4:30 this morning with a visit to an Ocado warehouse, writes Genevieve Holl-Allen.\nThe Prime Minister was given a tour of the site in Luton, Bedfordshire, and tried his hand at packing orders, which included picking out smoked salmon and avocado for a customer.\nHe later met with eight members of staff, and asked them: “How do you feel when you see your own shopping then?”\nWith several stops scheduled for the penultimate day of campaigning, Mr Sunak showed no signs of slowing down.",
