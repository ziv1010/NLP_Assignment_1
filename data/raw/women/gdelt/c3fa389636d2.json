There are lots of males who have done a very good job in the women's game, but if the balance is better that will also inspire other women to start coaching.\"\nEngland goals search\nEngland have been coping without key attacking threats.\nBeth Mead, top scorer at the Euros last year, was ruled out of the England squad after rupturing her anterior cruciate ligament.\nAnd Lauren James, who led the way with three goals and three assists for England at this World Cup, is completing a two-game ban for a stamp during the Nigeria last-16 clash.\nAfter England drew a blank against Nigeria - winning only penalties - the goals did flow again in the 2-1 quarterfinal win against Colombia from Lauren Hemp and Alessia Russo.\nSam Kerr's fitness\nWhat is more surprising?\nAustralia reaching the semifinals? Or progressing mostly without Sam Kerr?\nThe star striker was nursing a calf injury at the start of the tournament - missing the entire group stage before managing 65 minutes across the last two matches as a substitute.\nAustralia manager Tony Gustavsson said: \"The way she pushed through was fantastic and impressive, both from a mental and physical aspect. She recovered well, she trained today so she's available.\"\nKerr has already scored against England once this year - netting in the 2-0 win that ended their 30-game unbeaten start under Wiegman in April. But England haven't been beaten since then -- with five successive wins at the World Cup.\nRead more:\nEngland goalkeeper hits out at Nike over shirt row\nAs heavyweights crash out, cautious Lionesses prepare to face Nigeria\nWiegman turning over every stone to find a path to World Cup glory\nEngland's investment\nEngland is the destination of choice for Matildas to play.\nIt's a sign of the strength of English football that 10 members of Wednesday's opposing squad are signed up to Women's Super League clubs - including Kerr at Chelsea and fellow forward Caitlin Foord at Arsenal.\nThe professionalism of the WSL is what attracted Australia goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold to West Ham.\nAnd Matildas boss Gustavsson believes the FA's investment in women's football - outweighing theirs - gives the Lionesses the edge in their semifinal showdown.\nStadium history\nStadium Australia in Sydney brings back fond memories of one of England's greatest sporting achievements.\nBut Lionesses captain Millie Bright was too young to remember Jonny Wilkinson securing Rugby World Cup glory in 2003 at the expense of Australia.\nThe venue's iconic moment for Australians on the world stage came in 2000 during the Sydney Olympics.\nCarrying the weight of the nation on her shoulders, Cathy Freeman was the first Olympian to light the cauldron and win gold at the same Games.\nNever before had an Aboriginal person from Australia won individual gold\nIt was an iconic moment - surging to victory in the 400 metres in front of more than 112,000 spectators before displaying the red, yellow and black Aboriginal flag and the Australian flag on the victory lap.",
