  "body_text": "According to the World Economic Forum, it will take five generations for women to live in a world where there is full gender parity.\nOn March 8, we globally celebrated International Women’s Day.\nThis year's theme, #accelerate action focuses firmly on the importance of taking swift, decisive steps to achieve gender equality.\nA day that highlights that we must continue to raise awareness to keep pushing women’s equality to the fore.\nWhilst it is a day to celebrate women’s achievements and accomplishments to society, there is still a need for an urgency to break down the barriers and biases that women face every day, especially in both their personal and professional lives.\nSo, together, let's accelerate action to speed up the rate of progress worldwide.\nIn celebration, our national federation asked members to share the advice they’d give their younger selves.\nFrom being braver, being bolder, being kind, taking risks, trusting yourself, being ambitious, and not letting fear paralyse you.\nI know there are a few things I would have shared with my younger self.\nMany members joined in the fun, sending in tips and hard life lessons.\nHere in Norfolk, WI, members joined together for coffee and a chat and created displays of orange flowers to show concern for violence against women.\nI had a very busy day on Saturday celebrating a special birthday, not mine.\nI spent most of my day alongside two young women who are juggling all that comes with raising a young family and everyday life.\nI don’t envy them; I think at their age I actually had it a lot easier; the demands of everyday life were less hectic.\nThey both have very happy home/life balances, it was good to hear these two young women have equal parity within the home, which gives them the autonomy to make their own decisions and choices in life without barriers.\nWhilst at primary school in the early 60s, I developed a love of sport.\nFirst it was stoolball, and then rounders. I also developed a love of cricket and football.\nI was hooked. I got to kick about with the boys at playtime; I even played a match with them.\nIn the third year, I nailed it.\nMy teacher, Mr. Jago, called out, “Frankie, we need you to come and play in the school cricket match; you will be the bowler!”.\nI remember it as if it was yesterday; I was so proud. But when I reached senior school, I realised I was never going to play either of those two sports going forward.\nInstead, I turned my attention to tennis, lacrosse, and hockey.\nWe even had a girls basketball team, playing some pretty rough matches, but no football, no mixed teams; I had never considered that football was a boy’s only club.\nI can still remember to this day the feeling of rejection. I had no idea at that time the FA banned women from playing football between 1921 and 1971 and stated, “The game of football is quite unsuitable for females and should not be encouraged.”.\nWomen’s football had been suppressed, but there was a resurgence when the 1966 World Cup heroes became idols for both girls and boys.\nThis resurgence didn’t reach my school, so we stood on the sidelines cheering the boys on.\nI became less interested in both cricket and football; it was the first time in my life that I questioned the unfairness; when I did speak up, I was met with the same answer: it's not for girls.\nTennis became my main sport, where at least I was equal to my mixed doubles partner.\nTwo generations on, and my granddaughter plays for a girls team, she attends football training and plays matches on a Saturday.\nRecently, she was awarded player of the match by her own team; the opposition team also named her player of the match, and she scored a hat trick. You can guess; I was very proud.",
