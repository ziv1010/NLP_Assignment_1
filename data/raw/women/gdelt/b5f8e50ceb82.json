The Eagles beat Newcastle Olympic 2-1 in extra-time on Tuesday night at Darling Street Oval.\n\"They were just too good for us,\" Bolch said of Maitland's cup loss.\n\"They were very good on the night, but I thought it was probably one of our worst games of the year. But there's no excuses.\n\"Weston away this week and Magic away next week, so it's a tough period of the year, but you've got to beat those teams if you want to be there at the end of the year.\"\nMaitland should be full strength except for the absence of Sean Pratt, who is suspended for a second game on card accumulation.\nThe midfielder returned to play on Wednesday night but will sit out a second NPL match because he also had a red card early in the season.\nIn other signing news on Friday, Adamstown announced Weston assistant Daniel Dawkins as their new head coach for 2024.\nRosebud began a search for a replacement after Dave Rosewarne told the club he would be stepping aside following three years at the helm.\nOn Saturday, Adamstown (10th, 11 points) welcome Charlestown (1st, 34pts) at 2.30pm.

From 3.30pm, Edgeworth (5th, 25pts) host Lake Macquarie (12th, 4pts).\nMeanwhile, Northern NSW Football announced on Friday that their grand finals would return to club venues, while the men's and women's NPL deciders would be held on different days.\nLast year, NNSWF for the first time held the first-grade men's and women's NPL games as a double-header, on a Sunday at No.2 Sportsground.

We know they will do a fantastic job.\n\"Finals football is always an exciting time and a celebration of football and I'd encourage everyone to get out and support our players and clubs.\"\nMORE IN SPORT:\n- Jets veteran Jason Hoffman re-signs, waiting to learn new coach\n- Knights ironman Tyson Frizell expected to back up against Panthers\n- Greater Hunter Coast get additional team in NSW Women's Premier Cricket\n- Olympic boss Joel Griffiths outed five games for terrorist slur\n- Nikolai Topor-Stanley signs with Lambton Jaffas in NPL\nTo see more stories and read today's paper download the Newcastle Herald news app here.",
