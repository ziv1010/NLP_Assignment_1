The motivation I suppose is a bit of anger these free market clowns think they can do government stuff better than governments.\nIf they have not instantly died as a result of hull failure, and have had to wait days for their eventual demise having become stuck in some way, the only person I feel for is the young lad.\nNB: If you want a picture of how a National/ACT government would operate, see the fortunes of Oceangate Titan…\n-\n\" If you want a picture of how a National/ACT government would operate\"\nYou have some evidence for this rather wild accusation do you?\n-\n-\nI assume you mean Scotland where the female leader resigned suddenly and unexpectedly and a few weeks later she and her husband were arrested?\nWe certainly haven't had any arrests here yet, although the handling of the PGF looks a bit fishy.\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAmazing shit-hole we live in when owning shares in infrastructure is seen as corrupt, but owning crumbling, damp, unhealthy tenancies is a massive win.\n-\n-\nSo true Muttonbird.\n-\nThere is that….\n-\n-\nI want Dairy Owners to be held accountable for their part in the 5000 or so excess deaths we have in Aotearoa caused by the sale of cigarettes.\nhttps://twitter.com/Waeherebro/status/1671615191061258246\nWell said.\n-\n100%\n-\nGrowing up in a Dairy, the tobacco companies lied to my family about the dangers of cigarettes too.\n-\nYes. Conducted scientific tests then lied to everyone.\n-\n-\nI wonder if former tobacco industry lobbyists like Chris bishop and Todd barclay…shift at all uneasily in their seats over that peddling of what they could not have not known was death in a white cylinder…?\n-\n-\nHmm…\n-\nWelcome to the anthropocene era.\nBy pumping water out of the ground and moving it elsewhere, humans have shifted such a large mass of water that the Earth tilted nearly 80 centimeters (31.5 inches) east between 1993 and 2010 alone, according to a new study published on June 15 in Geophysical Research Letters, AGU’s journal for short-format, high-impact research with implications spanning the Earth and space sciences.\n-\nThat would be ironic…if we created our own spin off the axis…\nEven vibrations would likely be catastrophic…\nI was looking for something new to worry about..\n-\n- Comments are now closed",
