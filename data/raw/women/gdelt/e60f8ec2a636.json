The competition’s official name will be Mundial de Clubes FIFA and will feature clubs from each of the six confederations.\nThe Council unanimously confirmed the club ranking methodology to be used as part of the key principles of access, which were approved at the Council’s meeting in March 2023 (https://apo-opa.co/3RIp93g).\nWith the objective of ensuring the highest quality possible based on sporting criteria over the most recent four seasons, starting from the group stage of the confederation’s relevant premier club competition, and incentivising the result of every game in the respective tournament, the following methodology for the new standard ranking was approved:\n3 points for a win\n1 point for a draw\n3 points for progress to each stage of the competition\nIn the case of European clubs, given that three full seasons and a full group stage of the fourth season of the UEFA Champions League have already been completed, and since UEFA has an existing club coefficient system, the current pre-existing methodology principles for the purpose of calculating the UEFA club coefficient in relation to matches in the UEFA Champions League only will be exceptionally applied to determine the ranking of European clubs for the FIFA Club World Cup 2025™.\nThe approved methodology for the ranking of European teams is therefore as follows:\n2 points for a win\n1 point for a draw\n4 points for qualification for the group stage\n5 points for qualification for the round of 16\n1 point for progress to each stage of the competition thereafter\nBased on the approved principles of access and the results of the respective continental club competitions, the following clubs are already set to take part:\nAFRICA – 4 teams\nVia champions pathway (CAF Champions League) – 3 teams\n2020/21 and 2022-23: Al Ahly SC (EGY)\n2021/22: Wydad AC (MAR)\n2023/24: TBC\nVia ranking pathway – 1 team\nTBC\nASIA – 4 teams\nVia champions pathway (AFC Champions League) – 3 teams\n2021: Al Hilal SFC (KSA)\n2022: Urawa Red Diamonds (JPN)\n2023/24: TBC\nVia ranking pathway – 1 team\nTBC\nEUROPE – 12 teams\nVia champions pathway (UEFA Champions League) – 4 teams\n2020/21: Chelsea FC (ENG)\n2021/22: Real Madrid CF (ESP)\n2022/23: Manchester City FC (ENG)\n2023/24: TBC\nVia ranking pathway – 8 teams\nFC Bayern München (GER)\nParis Saint-Germain FC (FRA)\nFC Internazionale (ITA)\nFC Porto (POR)\nSL Benfica (POR)\n10.

These dates have been set to ensure that the scheduling of the tournament is harmoniously aligned with the International Match Calendar to allow sufficient time between the tournament final and the start of the season in many domestic leagues globally, and considering that a minimum of three days of rest between matches should be guaranteed in order to safeguard player welfare.\nTournament format\nThe format of the competition was confirmed as follows:\nA group stage composed of eight groups of four teams per group playing in a single-game round-robin format\nThe top two teams per group progressing to the round of 16\nA direct single-match knockout stage from the round of 16 to the final\nNo third-place play-off\nThe competition will therefore follow the same format as the FIFA World Cup 2022™ and the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023™, with the exception that there will be no play-off for third place.\n“Clubs play a fundamental role in world football, and the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 will be a major milestone in providing clubs from all confederations with a fitting stage on which to shine at the highest level of the game,” said FIFA President Gianni Infantino.\n“This will be an open competition based on sporting merit that will play a key role as part of our efforts to make football truly global.”\nFIFA Intercontinental Cup to be played annually from 2024\nFollowing the Council’s approval in March 2023 (https://apo-opa.co/3tkTefW) of an annual FIFA club competition as of 2024, featuring all confederation premier club competition champions and concluding with a final at a neutral venue between the UEFA Champions League winners and the winners of an intercontinental play-off between clubs from the other confederations, it was agreed that the official name of the competition will be the Coupe Intercontinentale de la FIFA.\nTo strengthen continental sporting rivalries and create a prestigious yearly title for all stages of the competition, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup will comprise the following stages:\nStage A: This stage of the competition will have two rounds. In the first round, on an alternating basis, the winners of the AFC Champions League or the winners of the CAF Champions League will play in their home stadium against the winners of the OFC Champions League. The winners of this round will go on to play either the winners of the AFC Champions League or the winners of the CAF Champions League in the final round. The first edition will see the identity of the AFC or CAF team in the first round determined by a draw and the hosting rights for the first round and the final round split between the relevant AFC and CAF teams accordingly, so each team will play one match in their home stadium. The hosting rights for the first round and the final round will alternate each year thereafter.\nStage B: The winners of the Concacaf Champions Cup will play the winners of the CONMEBOL Libertadores over a single leg in the home stadium of one of the clubs, with the hosts of the first edition to be determined by a draw and the hosting rights alternating each year thereafter.\nPlay-off: The winners of both previous stages will play each other in the days before the final, at the same neutral venue hosting the final.\nFinal: The winners of the play-off will play the winners of the UEFA Champions League at a neutral venue, with the winners being crowned as champions for that year.\nFor the inaugural edition of the competition in 2024, the following dates were confirmed:\nThe first stages will be scheduled by FIFA in consultation with the clubs and the confederations\nThe play-off will take place on 14 December 2024 in a neutral location\nThe final will take place on 18 December 2024 in the same neutral location\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of FIFA.\nNote to editors:\nA video statement from the FIFA President is available via the following link: https://apo-opa.co/3tlLr1o\nContact for African media:\nAfricanMedia@fifa.org\nLatest Stories\n-\n‘I wanted to be an architect but ended up as a nurse’ – Diana Hamilton reveals\n48 minutes -\nFrom wards to worship: Diana Hamilton reveals how nursing school shaped her destiny\n1 hour -\nMahama demands binding deadlines for African reparations\n2 hours -\nThis is not the time to settle political scores – Bawumia to government\n3 hours -\n5 definitive Valentine’s Day gifts to win your lover’s heart in Ghana\n3 hours -\n37% of SHS students exposed to drugs – Opare-Addo\n3 hours -\nNLC secures court injunction against striking tertiary unions\n4 hours -\nOSP says it remains guided by law after INTERPOL deletes Ofori-Atta’s Red Notice\n4 hours -\nWaiting in the Ring: life inside Bukom’s halted boxing scene\n4 hours -\nRed Notice cancellation: OSP official fires back at Ofori-Atta’s lawyers\n5 hours -\nOfori-Atta saga: Red Notice ends after arrest – OSP official clarifies\n5 hours -\nAAG raises alarm over billboard demolitions, calls for presidential intervention\n6 hours -\nHealth Minister to chair probe into ‘No Bed Syndrome’ death; promises system overhaul\n6 hours -\nPrime Insight to tackle ‘galamsey tax’ debate, cocoa reforms and Ayawaso East fallout this Saturday\n6 hours -\nCocoa crisis, galamsey complicity and election credibility to dominate this Saturday’s Newsfile\n7 hours",
