The fire - which quickly made national news - continued throughout the night and into the morning, by which time it was under control.\nThe following day the reality of the fire was realised when it was revealed that firefighters Martyn Sadler, 38, and Jennie Logan, 30, died while tackling the blaze.\nDave Chester, a 57-year-old father-of-two, who worked at the site, also died.\nHome Office statistics showed it was only the fourth incident in which a firefighter had died whilst tackling a blaze in England in the past 15 years.\nTwo other firefighters suffered serious injuries in the incident and were discharged from hospital in June.\nThe impact of the tragedy could be felt across the county, with Oxford City Council lowering the flag above the Town Hall to half-mast to mourn the losses on May 16.\nThe tragedy also rocked the country, with heartfelt tributes pouring in from the nation.\nPrime minister Sir Keir Starmer and leader of the Conservatives Kemi Badenoch were among national leaders who all shared heartfelt messages.\nMP for Bicester and Woodstock, Calum Miller, left the House of Commons early on May 16 to support those on the ground.\nFlowers and letters were left at the Bicester Motion site entrance, Bicester Fire Station and Garth Park, as the community mourned the lives lost.\nHolding back tears, Chief Fire Officer for Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue, Rob MacDougall, paid an emotional tribute to the Mr Sadler and Ms Logan at a press conference.\nThe Bicester community continued to pull together in the months after the fire, with a number of fundraising and memorial events being held.\nAs of November, Bicester Rugby Football Union Club has raised more than £57,000 for the Fire Fighters Charity in memory of Ms Logan and Mr Sadler, who were members of the club, with Ms Logan on the Bicester Vixens women's team.\nREAD MORE: Bicester Rugby Club raises over £46k in memory of firefighters\nIn June, the inquests into the three deaths were opened at Oxford Coroner's Court.\nDennis Murray, assistant chief constable at Thames Valley Police, had previously said: \"Our initial investigations suggest that all three sustained injuries in line with those typically caused by the collapse of part of a structure.\"\nREAD MORE: Inquests into three Bicester Motion fire deaths opened\nOn the morning of June 14, thousands of people gathered on as a funeral procession to honour Ms Logan as her funeral procession passed through Bicester.\nMs Logan’s coffin, draped in the Union flag, was carried atop an aerial ladder platform fire engine through the streets of Bicester.\nOn July 31, thousands of people lined the streets again, this time for Mr Sadler's funeral procession.\nChris Wilson, ex-station manager of Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service, was among the crowd and told this newspaper that Mr Sadler was 'always outstanding'.\nMr Chester's funeral, held on July 8, was private at the request of his family.\nIn July it was announced that Hangar 79 would be 'sensitively demolished', starting on August 6.\nThe Hangar was Grade II listed, having been built in 1926-27 to house aircraft at RAF Bicester, which was the original use of the site.\nThis followed the excessive damage it received from the fire and discussions with both Historic England and Cherwell District Council.\nOn November 15 - the six-month anniversary of the tragedy - Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue said the families and colleagues affected continue to have support from the service and families liaison officers from Thames Valley Police.\nREAD MORE: Fire service 'will always honour' lives lost in Bicester blaze\nA spokesperson for the fire service added: \"As a service, we will always honour Jennie, Martyn and Dave with immense gratitude for everything they contributed to the fire and rescue service and their communities.\"\nOn the same day, a spokesperson for Thames Valley Police said: “We are conducting a thorough investigation, alongside the Health and Safety Executive, into the circumstances that led to the tragic deaths and serious injuries at Bicester Motion in May, exactly six months ago.\n“We and the Health and Safety Executive remain committed to meticulously gathering and reviewing all available evidence to reassure the coroner, the injured parties and the families of those who sadly lost their lives, that all legal and procedural matters have been considered in respect of any coronial or criminal processes.”\nThe police force declined to comment on the timescale of the investigation or the cause of the fire, which is still unknown.\nA date for the full inquests into the three deaths has not yet been set, but it is understood that a substantive pre-inquest review hearing will take place in 2026.",
