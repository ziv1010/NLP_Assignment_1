News in November that Zach's season \"is a bit of a throwback.\"\"This season is a lot more about the romance and the love, and maybe a little bit less about the drama,\" explained Jesse, who starred on Season 5 of The Bachelor back in 2004.\nJesse also said on the \"Bachelor Happy Hour\" podcast in early January that Zach \"really shines\" throughout his season.\n\"I really think he comes through,\" Jesse teased. \"He has a beautiful story, and I'm really excited for people to see it.\"\nZach \"cries a lot\" during The Bachelor and it's \"the most emotional show\"\n\"This is easily the most emotional show that I've hosted in the franchise to date,\" Jesse told E!

He's very, very intentional. This is easily the most emotional show that I've hosted in the franchise.\"\nJesse said Zach's season is \"emotionally charged\" because the bachelorettes really want to end up with Zach.\n\"It's a [totally] different vibe than I've [ever] had hosting any of the other shows,\" the host noted.\nRELATED LINK: 'THE BACHELORETTE' COUPLES NOW: WHOM DID 'THE BACHELORETTE' STARS AND THEIR BACHELOR PICKS ULTIMATELY END UP WITH?!

That woman was Christina.\nChristina received the first one-on-one date of the season -- and a rose -- despite her antics, but her tendency to drink too much allegedly continued.\nThe women therefore targeted Christina as a problem early on.\nRELATED LINK: 'THE BACHELOR' COUPLES NOW: WHO DID 'THE BACHELOR' STARS AND THEIR BACHELORETTE PICKS ACTUALLY END UP MARRYING? (PHOTOS)\nCat, Kimberly and Victoria get cut at The Bachelor season's second Rose Ceremony\nThe following women were selected for a group date with Zach during the first round of dates: Bailey Brown, Brianna Thorbourne, Brooklyn Willie, Cat Wong, Davia Bunch, Genevie Mayo, Katherine \"Kat\" Izzo, Kylee Russell, and Mercedes Northup.The Bachelor alums Victoria Fuller, Courtney Robertson, and Tahzjuan Hawkins served as judges of the group date, which was hosted by Latto, the rapper who sings \"Big Energy.\"\nBrianna was awarded the \"winner\" for having the \"big bitch energy\" by Latto.\nThe second group date during Week 1 featured Alyssa \"Aly\" Jacobs, Ariel Frenkel, Anastasia Keramidas, Charity Lawson, Gabriella \"Gabi\" Elnicki, Greer Blitzer, Kaitlyn \"Kaity\" Biggar, Jessica \"Jess\" Girod, Kimberly Gutierrez, and Victoria Jameson.\nThe audience cheered for Zach to kiss Aly during the date but he refused, probably because he didn't want to upset the other women.\nAt the second Rose Ceremony of the season, Zach narrowed down his pool of bachelorettes from 20 to 17 women.\nZach eliminated Cat, Kimberly, and Victoria J. during the Rose Ceremony.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBrianna quits after tiring of Christina's mean-girl behavior\nAfter the second Rose Ceremony, a group of women participated in a tackle-football game at Moorpark College announced by Jesse Palmer and Hannah Storm.The Blue Team was comprised of Ariel Frenkel, Bailey Brown, Brooklyn Willie, Charity Lawson, Christina Mandrell, Katherine \"Kat\" Izzo, and Kylee Russell.\nThe Yellow Team was made up of Anastasia Keramidas, Brianna Thorbourne, Davia Bunch, Gabriella \"Gabi\" Elnicki, Genevie Mayo, Greer Blitzer, Jessica \"Jess\" Girod, and Mercedes Northup.\nAccording to Carbone, Brianna self-eliminated before the Rose Ceremony because she felt bullied.\nChristina was allegedly the ring leader of the behavior that led to Brianna quitting.\n\"Christina was the one who I guess was sort of the instigator, telling Brianna that the First Impression Rose she got was from America (at the live ATFR), was not from Zach,\" Carbone reported in his blog.\n\"It all escalated at the pool party and this is when Brianna ends up quitting.\"\nZach then tires of Christina and sends her home at the third Rose Ceremony\nPrior to the third Rose Ceremony, Zach enjoyed a one-on-one date with Kaitlyn \"Kaity\" Biggar, part of which took place at the Museum of Natural History. Kaity received a rose from Zach by the end of the date.Zach also took Alyssa \"Aly\" Jacobs on a solo date and the pair went skydiving into the Babcock Winery & Vineyards in Santa Barbara, CA. Aly also earned herself a rose on the date.\nZach canceled the cocktail party preceding the third Rose Ceremony in favor of a pool party earlier in the day.\nIn addition to Brianna Thorbourne quitting, Zach sent Bailey Brown home before the Rose Ceremony because they didn't have a connection.\nZach then ousted one more bachelorette at the third Rose Ceremony of the season: Christina Mandrell.\nADVERTISEMENT\nChristina's elimination left Zach with fourteen bachelorettes still in the running for his final rose.\nAnother bachelorette quits in the Bahamas before Zach narrows the women to his Final 11 bachelorettes\nAccording to Carbone, Zach and his fourteen remaining bachelorettes then left the Los Angeles area and flew to the Bahamas for The Bachelor season's third round of dates.Prior to Rose Ceremony No. 4, Katherine \"Kat\" Izzo accompanies Zach on a one-on-one date.\nZach also enjoyed a group date with Alyssa \"Aly\" Jacobs, Ariel Frenkel, Anastasia Keramidas, Charity Lawson, Davia Bunch, Gabriella \"Gabi\" Elnicki, Genevie Mayo, Greer Blitzer, Jessica \"Jess\" Girod, Kaitlyn \"Kaity\" Biggar, Kylee Russell, and Mercedes Northup.\nThe other bachelorette who received a one-on-one date with Zach that week in the Bahamas was Brooklyn Willie.\nCarbone heard that Anastasia self-eliminated before the Rose Ceremony due to a close friend suddenly passing away.\nAt the Rose Ceremony, Zach went from 14 bachelorettes to only 11 women by denying roses to Davia and Genevie.\nBrooklyn emerges as The Bachelor season's new \"villain\" after Christina's exit\nAfter Christina Mandrell was sent packing, Brooklyn Willie reportedly emerged as The Bachelor season's new \"villain.\"Carbone heard that Brooklyn was a pot-stirrer and happened to be in the middle of a lot of the drama.\n\"But from all I've been told, [Brooklyn] just liked to instigate things that seemingly would keep her on TV,\" Carbone reported in his blog.\nSomething \"unplanned\" that \"changes the landscape\" of \"the rest of the season\" happens in London\nAfter their time in the Bahamas, Zach and his 11 remaining The Bachelor bachelorettes reportedly flew to London, England for their fourth round of dates. However, Carbone is admittedly a little confused about what went down in London.ADVERTISEMENT\n\"There is something that happens in London that kinda changes the landscape of the show,\" Carbone reported in his blog.\n\"Problem is, I don't know any details behind it. If I did, I'd tell you. All I can pass on is what I was told. I was told this is something production had zero control over and they were scrambling to figure out what to do.\"\nCarbone heard that what went down wasn't bad, but it was unplanned and \"had a significant impact on the production of the show.\"\nGabi was therefore the only bachelorette who got to go on a date with Zach out of the eleven women that were left in London at that point.\nAt the fifth Rose Ceremony of the season, Carbone believes Zach ousted two women.\nMercedes Northup, who got food poisoning, was one of them and got eliminated in London.\nCarbone knows that eleven women went to London and only seven women remained after two Rose Ceremonies -- one in London and one at their next destination.\nAlyssa \"Aly\" Jacobs and Kylee Russell also were eliminated at some point, but Carbone isn't sure if they were sent packing in London or their next stop.\nAriel and Charity get one-on-one dates in Estonia\nTallinn, Estonia is where Zach and his remaining bachelorettes reportedly traveled to after London.Charity Lawson received the first one-on-one date, Zach enjoyed a group date, and then Ariel Frenkel accompanied the Bachelor on the second solo date of the week.\nAt the sixth Rose Ceremony in Estonia, Carbone believes Zach went from nine bachelorettes to only seven women.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever, as previously mentioned, Carbone is unsure whether Alyssa \"Aly\" Jacobs and Kylee Russell were sent home while Zach and his bachelorettes were in London or Estonia.\n\"Whatever it is that happens in London and sets the tone for the rest of the season, that's apparently the reason why [I'm] trying to figure out who gets sent home in Estonia,\" Carbone explained.\nThe spoiler blogger added, \"It's nothing like someone leaves and returns. I was told it WASN'T that but it's something the show hasn't dealt with before and didn't see coming.\"\nBrooklyn gets sent home on a one-on-one date in Hungary\nZach went on two one-on-one dates in Budapest, Hungary with Kaitlyn \"Kaity\" Biggar and Brooklyn Willie.However, Zach reportedly denied Brooklyn a rose on their solo date.\nCarbone isn't sure whether there was a formal Rose Ceremony in Hungary. It's possible that Zach just determined his Final 4 bachelorettes by handing out roses on his dates instead.\nThe other two women ousted by Zach in Hungary were Katherine \"Kat\" Izzo and Greer Blitzer.\nZach's Final 4 bachelorettes are Ariel, Charity, Gabi and Kaity\nAt the seventh Rose Ceremony, which took place in Hungary, Zach went from seven bachelorettes to only four women.Zach's Final 4 bachelorettes were Ariel Frenkel, Charity Lawson, Gabriella \"Gabi\" Elnicki, and Kaitlyn \"Kaity\" Biggar.\nGabi was caught reading Game of Roses' How to Win the Bachelor book during her stay at the mansion, so it's likely Gabi's intentions were questioned at some point in the process.\nAriel, Gabi and Kaity are Zach's Final 3 bachelorettes\nZach picked his Final 3 bachelorettes after the women's round of hometown dates.ADVERTISEMENT\nZach proceeded to fly to Columbus, GA, to meet Charity Lawson's family on November 4, followed by Kaitlyn \"Kaity\" Biggar's hometown date in Austin, TX, on November 6.\nAt the eighth Rose Ceremony of the season, Zach eliminated Charity.\nZach's Final 3 bachelorettes as a result were Ariel, Gabi and Kaity.\nReality Steve isn't sure who Zach's Final 2 and winner are yet\nAfter completing his round of hometown dates, Zach enjoyed his overnight Fantasy Suite dates in Krabi, Thailand.It's unclear whether he went into a Fantasy Suite with Ariel Frenkel, Gabriella \"Gabi\" Elnicki, or Kaitlyn \"Kaity\" Biggar.\nCarbone has yet to discover Zach's Final 2 women as well as the winner of The Bachelor's 27th season.\nBut Jesse Palmer told Us Weekly in November that he is \"10,000 percent\" certain Zach will have a happy ending.\n\"I can't wait for people to see his journey,\" Jesse teased.\nRELATED LINK: 'THE BACHELOR' STAR ZACH SHALLCROSS' BACHELORETTES ANNOUNCED -- MEET ZACH'S WOMEN!
