The\nresult of this research does not constitute investment advice or an\ninvitation to conclude certain stock exchange transactions.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nClassification of NuWays AG to Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co KGaA\nCompany Name: Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co KGaA\nISIN: DE0005493092\nReason for the research: Update\nRecommendation: BUY\nfrom: 18.08.2025\nTarget price: EUR 5.20\nTarget price on sight of: 12 months\nLast rating change:\nAnalyst: Philipp Sennewald\nFY24/25 ahead on sales but behind on the bottom-line / Chg.\nOn Friday, BVB released preliminary FY24/25 figures, showing further\ntop-line growth against a strong comparable base as well as FCF\nimprovements, while profitability came in slightly weaker than expected. In\ndetail:\nFY24/25p sales increased 3.3% yoy to EUR 526m (eNuW: EUR 517m; eCons: EUR 511m),\nwhich was especially driven by TV Marketing sales of EUR 227m (+10.3% yoy;\neNuW: EUR 215m) which benefitted from the FIFA CWC that was held in June/July\n(c. 75% of corresponding sales attributable to FY24/25). Besides this, sales\nwere largely in line with match operations sales up 5.0% to EUR 55.2m,\nAdvertising up 4.8% to EUR 154m, Merchandising down 16.4% to EUR 40.0m and\nConference, catering & others down 10.7% to EUR 50m. The reason for the\ndecline in Merchandising and CC&O lies mainly in the tough comparable base\ngiven the UEFA Euros in summer 2024 and BVB reaching the UCL final last\nyear.\nFY24/25p EBITDA declined by 22.9% yoy to EUR 116m (eNuW: EUR 121m; eCons: EUR\n118m), implying a 22.0% margin (FY23/24: 29.5%). While the CWC should have\nmade up for not reaching the UCL final again, the main factor for the\ndecline lies in the transfer result, which was pushed the year before by the\nEUR 103m of Jude Bellingham to Real Madrid. Overall, net transfer income\ndeclined 61.3% to EUR 37.8m as a result.\nOn the contrary, FY24/25p FCF improved significantly to EUR 21.5 (eNuW: EUR\n20.9m), up from EUR -4.4m the year before. FCF generation was predominantly\ndriven by positive WC swings, as oustanding receivables in connection with\nplayer transfers were collected as well as normalizing CapEx (investments in\nnew catering facilities and training ground for women team last year).\nWhat to expect for FY25/26: Let's start with the sporting perspective, which\nis laying the foundation for the financial success of a football club. As in\nthe previous seasons, we expect BVB to finish the Bundesliga inside the\nTop-4, thus securing qualification for the 2026/27 UCL season, reach the\nround of 16 in the UCL as well as the quarterfinals in the national cup. On\nthis basis, sales are seen to decline by 3.3% to EUR 509m given that the\nmajority of CWC prize money was recorded in FY24/25 as well as the fact,\nthat BVB did reach the UCL quarterfinal last season. Despite that we expect\nan EBITDA improvement by 17% to EUR 136m (26.7% margin) on the back of\nrecovering net transfer income, as the already sealed transfer of Jamie\nGittens to Chelsea alone had a bottom-line effect of EUR 37-42m, according to\nthe company. Two further player transfers for a total gross value of EUR 13m\nas well as the expectation of additional transfers lead us to our estimate\nof EUR 60m net transfer income in FY25/26e. The company is expected to publish\na guidance for FY25/26 with the release of the annual report on 26th\nSeptember.\nOn this basis as well as the continuous undemanding valuation of 3.1x\nEV/EBITDA FY25/26e, we confirm our BUY recommendation an maintain our EUR 5.20\nPT based on DCF.\nYou can download the research here:\nhttps://eqs-cockpit.com/c/fncls.ssp?u=bad229336174ddc482674dda31d3e01c\nFor additional information visit our website:\nhttps://www.nuways-ag.com/research-feed\nContact for questions:\nNuWays AG - Equity Research\nWeb: www.nuways-ag.com\nEmail: research@nuways-ag.com\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/nuwaysag\nAdresse: Mittelweg 16-17, 20148 Hamburg, Germany\n++++++++++\nDiese Meldung ist keine Anlageberatung oder Aufforderung zum Abschluss\nbestimmter Börsengeschäfte.\nOffenlegung möglicher Interessenskonflikte nach § 85 WpHG beim oben\nanalysierten Unternehmen befinden sich in der vollständigen Analyse.\n++++++++++\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe EQS Distribution Services include Regulatory Announcements,\nFinancial/Corporate News and Press Releases.\nArchive at www.eqs-news.com\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2184858 18.08.2025 CET/CEST\n°",
