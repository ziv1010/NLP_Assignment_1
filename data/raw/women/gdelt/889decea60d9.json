Also, the ESPYS will also honor inspiring and courageous athletes with the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage, the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance and the Pat Tillman Award for Service.\nHere are the top moments and award winners for the 2023 ESPY Awards:\nBest team\nThe Kansas City Chiefs were named the best team as they took home their third Lombardi Trophy, and second in four years, after defeating the Eagles 38-35 in Super Bowl 57. They finished with a 17-3 record, the most total wins in franchise history for one season, and had seven Pro Bowlers. The Chiefs also won their seventh straight AFC West title, the longest streak in franchise history. This is the Chiefs' first ESPY Award victory for best team.\nPatrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Isiah Pacheco and Chris Jones accepted the award, and it wouldn't be a proper celebration without Kelce singing \"Fight For Your Right.\"\nBest play\nIn one of the most thrilling regular-season games of the NFL season, the Minnesota Vikings trailed the Buffalo Bills late in the fourth quarter and needed to convert a long fourth down to keep the game alive. Kirk Cousins threw a pass to top target Justin Jefferson that seemed certain to be an interception. Instead, Jefferson used one hand to secure the ball to make the best catch of the NFL season, and it was a big moment in an eventual Vikings win.\nUSWNT given Arthur Ashe Award for Courage\nThe Arthur Ashe Award for Courage was given to the USWNT for its years-long fight for equal pay with the men's side; they finally got a deal done in May 2022.\nWhile the team is currently preparing for the 2023 World Cup, several former players took the stage to accept the award and thanked every single person to ever play for the team for always fighting for equal treatment.\nAngel Reese named breakthrough athlete, says another national championship is on the way\nThe \"Bayou Barbie\" is the breakthrough athlete of the year.\nAngel Reese averaged a career-high 23 points a game and won a national championship in her first season with the LSU Tigers after transferring from Maryland.

This is the first ESPY Award victory for Reese.\nShe said \"another natty\" is coming for her and the Tigers.\nCarmelo Anthony honored by 'Banana Boat Crew'\nThe members of the \"Banana Boat Crew\" − LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Paul − paid their respects to their fellow member, Carmelo Anthony, for his NBA career and what he's accomplished off the court.\nH.E.R. delivers tribute to Jimmy V Award\nGrammy-award winning artist H.E.R. gave a powerful performance in honor of the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance, showcasing her strong vocal range while some of the past Jimmy V Award winners' speeches played in the background, including Craig Sager's and Stuart Scott's.\n'James Gang' salutes their king, LeBron James says he isn't retiring\nThe \"James Gang\" was on-hand to celebrate LeBron James for becoming the NBA's all-time leading scorer, as Savannah, Bronny, Bryce and Zhuri introduced the Los Angeles Lakers star as their king. Zhuri even had to stop her mom from cussing.\nJames thanked his family for all the sacrifices they made for him to have such a dominant career, but the highlight of his speech was him announcing that he isn't done playing in the NBA after he pondered the thought at the end of the Lakers' season.\n“The day I can’t give the game everything on the floor is the day I’ll be done. Lucky for you guys, that day is not today,\" he said.\nJimmy V Award for Perseverance given to Liam Hendriks\nThe three-time MLB All-Star announced in January he would begin treatment for non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, and four months later, made his return after he was in remission.\nHe told USA TODAY Sports prior to the ESPYS he was \"very honored\" to be given the award and hopes his award raises awareness for cancer research.
