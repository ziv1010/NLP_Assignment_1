It was Marco Verratti's turnover in his own box this time that created the chance, and Bayern made sure to punish their opponents.\nSerge Gnabry sealed the win with his goal in the 89th minute, finishing off a blistering counter-attack.\nBayern advance to the last eight for the fourth straight season, while PSG are eliminated at this stage for the second year in a row.\nNagelsmann: 'We deserved to win'\nJulian Nagelsmann has spoken to the media following the win: \"In the first half, we didn't do what we had talked about before very well. There was too much space.\n\"But we defended better in the second half and were dangerous on the ball. In the end, we deserved to win.\n\"If we show maximum hunger with emotion and we couple that with our quality, then we can achieve anything.\"\nGaltier: Bayern's first goal was 'ridiculous'\nChristophe Galtier had more to say following the loss: \"We did not manage to score when we were on top of things.\n\"Then we concede a ridiculous goal. What made the difference is the fact we missed some key players in both legs. It's a big disappointment but we have to swallow it.\"\nGaltier on his future at PSG\nChristophe Galtier has spoken about his future at PSG: “It’s really too early to talk about it. It depends on the management and my president. There’s a disappointment.\n“The club had a lot of hopes for this competition. I stay focused on the end of the season”.\nDonnarumma: 'We are angry'\nGianluigi Donnarumma has spoken to Sky Sports: “We are disappointed, we are angry. It’s very disappointing to go out of the Champions League.\n“I have no regrets or doubts on my choice to join Paris Saint-Germain. Never had doubts.\"\nOn whether he's happy that his former club AC Milan have advanced: \"Yes, but I’m so proud to be at PSG.\"\nMusiala: 'We can win this tournament'\nJamal Musiala has spoken to BT Sport: \"I think we showed intensity throughout the whole game. We started the second half strongly.\n\"We didn't let them have time on the ball in the final third. Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, we know what they're capable of. We controlled the game better. Overall it was a good game for us.\n\"We went through some tactical things to change up a bit (at half-time). We had to up our intensity. When we do that we're very difficult to beat.\n\"(De Ligt's goal-line clearance) brought us to life. Those little moments are key.\n\"We all have the mentality we can win this tournament. We just have to take it game by game.\"\nOn Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting: \"It's very fun to play with him. He's a goal threat and has the presence in the box we need. He's an amazing player. He has the quality we need up front. He's a good friend as well. He's a good guy.\"\nA word for Musiala\nJamal Musiala was everywhere tonight, completing eight dribbles in this match.\nSince dribbles have been tracked starting in 2003-04, no Bayern Munich player has ever completed more in a Champions League knockout stage game.\nDefence the difference\nBayern Munich have now kept seven clean sheets in eight Champions League matches this season. Remarkably, the lone side to score against them has been Viktoria Plzen, who did so in a 4-2 win for Bayern in the Czech Republic.\nPSG, meanwhile, failed to keep a single clean sheet across their eight matches this season, the first time they've done so in this competition.\nFortress Allianz Arena\nBayern Munich have now won 16 of their past 18 Champions League home games (D1 L1).\nPSG did account for the sole loss during that time, in the 2021 quarter-finals, but they couldn't repeat that feat today.\nThe first leg was crucial\nBayern Munich have now advanced 21 of 23 times they won the first leg of a Champions League knockout tie.\nThe two exceptions came against Real Madrid in 2002 and against Inter Milan in 2011.\nPSG, on the other hand, have only advanced once in six times they lost the first leg of a UCL knockout tie - against Borussia Dortmund in 2020.\nPSG can't get over the hump\nIn stark contrast to Bayern's regular spot in the final eight, this is the fifth time in the last seven seasons that PSG have been eliminated at this stage.\nThat's at least two more times than any other side during that period.\nOld hat\nBayern Munich have qualified for the Champions League quarter-finals for the 21st time.\nNo other club has reached the final eight as many times.\nVideo of Gnabry's clinching goal - US readers\nOur American readers can check out the replay of the final goal here:\nVideo of Gnabry's clinching goal - UK readers\nOur British readers can check out the replay of the final goal here:\nPSG fall short yet again\nParis Saint-Germain have been knocked out of the Champions League once again.\nMatt Woosnam has looked back at some of PSG's previous failures in the competition, cataloguing five additional times they fell short.\nCheck out his report below.\nHalf of the last eight is set\nWe now know four of the eight teams that will comprise the Champions League quarterfinals:\n- Chelsea\n- Benfica\n- Bayern Munich\n- AC Milan\nThey'll be joined by four of these eight teams:\n- Manchester City and RB Leipzig are tied 1-1\n- Real Madrid lead Liverpool 5-2\n- Napoli lead Eintracht Frankfurt 2-0\n- Inter Milan lead Porto 1-0\nAC Milan advance, Tottenham eliminated\nAC Milan vs Tottenham in London has finished 0-0, meaning the Italian side have progressed to the quarter-finals 1-0 on aggregate.\nJoy and dejection\nThe final images at the Allianz Arena tell their own story. Jubilant scenes in the Bayern end, a team united and they celebrate what became a comfortable victory.\nMeanwhile, Mbappe vanishes from the field immediately, followed by Messi. In the end, just no more than five or six players, led by Marquinhos, head over to acknowledge the travelling PSG support.\nThere’s no denying that the Vitinha chance and the injuries to PSG defenders played a part, but Bayern had so much more to their game in the end, including on the substitutes bench. Their class showed through, and they progress as deserved winners.\n(All photos by Getty Images)\nFT: Bayern are through!\nIt's all over in Munich! PSG's quest for the ultimate trophy drags on.\nCould that be Lionel Messi's final Champions League appearance?\nBayern's defence has been vital\n90+4' Bayern Munich 2-0 Paris Saint-Germain\n(Bayern lead 3-0 on aggregate)\nMoments before the goal, Bayern pulled off two vital challenges.\nUpamecano provided the first to halt Hakimi, and then Davies pulled off a fabulous tackle to stop Mbappe when certain to score.\nPrevented a nervy ending.\nTeam Stats\nFCB\nPSG\nGame Details",
