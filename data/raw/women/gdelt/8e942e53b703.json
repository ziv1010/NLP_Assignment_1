So goes the oft-cited Winston Churchill quote. In recent years Britain has come under increased scrutiny on the freedom of its press. Last year the World Press Freedom Index ranked the UK 26th in the world, highlighting “worrying legislative proposals, the approval of Julian Assange’s extradition to the United States, and the treatment of journalists covering protests”. A lack of pluralism in the media landscape is also often raised as a concern. But recently another perceived threat cropped up in the form of a potential buyout of the Daily Telegraph titles by a consortium backed by the UAE. The commotion over the proposal has now led to the decision to ban foreign governments from owning UK newspapers and magazines. Baroness Stowell, a former Conservative cabinet minister, said upholding the right of the press to hold “those of us in Parliament” to account “is what has prevented any UK Government from owning or controlling the press. It’s surely inconceivable then that we would sanction a foreign government state power to what no UK Government ever has nor would ever do.” What happened, what does it mean (and what has George Osborne got to do with it?). We’ll take a look after the headlines.\nToday’s news, and why it matters\nMetropolitan Police officers being investigated for misconduct could be allowed to continue to work without restrictions and remain eligible for promotion, a leaked memo from Sir Mark Rowley reveals.

A professor of international law and human rights, Neve Gordon, told i the change in definition amounted to assessing groups by their “beliefs, not their actions”.\nPenny Mordaunt emerging as Tory leadership contender to stop right-wing takeover.

Redbird IMI, an investment fund majority-owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, vice president of the United Arab Emirates and owner of Manchester City Football Club, had proposed a £1.2bn deal to takeover the Daily Telegraph and the Spectator. RedBird IMI had pledged to maintain editorial freedoms at The Telegraph, with an advisory board to rule on disputes between journalists and the owners in the UAE. Other bidders for the titles included hedge-fund tycoon and GB News owner Paul Marshall, and Daily Mail owner DMGT. But pressure on the Government to stop the UAE-backed takeover ramped up, and Sunak’s administration faced a possible defeat in the House of Lords from peers who wanted to see action. Conservative peer Baroness Fleet, a former editor of the London Evening Standard, said: “I know that anyone who buys a newspaper wants to influence society, politicians and Government. All proprietors interfere”. She added: “I go even further and say that one of the reasons perhaps why a foreign government would want to buy an important newspaper such as the Telegraph would be to promote an anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian point of view.” Staff on the titles had expressed deep concern too. Veteran editor and broadcaster Andrew Neil, who is also chairman of the Spectator, had previously called the deal “absurd”. He said: “We are a democracy; our publications are part of the democratic process. How could we be owned by an undemocratic government?” Fraser Nelson, editor of the Spectator, also warned that preserving a free press “means keeping governments and publications apart”. Yesterday the Government indicated it would amend legislation to stop overseas state ownership, influence or control of newspapers and periodical magazines.\n- What is the ban? The Government has said it will bring forward an amendment to the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill that would block such deals. Speaking in the Lords, media minister Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay said: “The Government is committed to bringing forward an amendment to this Bill at third reading which prevents foreign state ownership of newspapers. We will amend the media merger regime explicitly to rule out newspaper and periodical news magazine mergers involving ownership, influence or control by foreign states.” The government will publish full details of its legislation next Tuesday. It could apply to the Telegraph Media Group takeover if the law was passed swiftly, Lord Parkinson suggested. Read more here.\n- What was George Osborne’s role? The former Chancellor is a partner at Robey Warshaw, the investment fund hired by RedBird IMI to help secure the Telegraph deal. But with the deal now apparently “dead” insiders have spoken out. “George Osborne has failed to make this work,” one told i. “He was brought on by RedBird to land this deal precisely because he is thought to be able to manage Tories and he knows the media business.” Andrew Neil told i: “We need to put a little shrine up to [CNN boss Jeff] Zucker and George Osborne whose totally cack-handed handling of this takeover attempt has given us greater protection from foreign governments than we’ve ever had before. What Osborne has done is quite a remarkable achievement; there was a coalition against the deal stretching from Lee Anderson to [Green MP] Caroline Lucas. I take my hat off to him. I know that wasn’t his intention but no one has created a coalition this wide since we fought the Nazis.” Read the full story here.\nAround the world\nThe movement of a pilot’s seat on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner may have been behind the aircraft’s sudden nosedive during a flight that caused the injury of at least 50 passengers, according to an aviation publication.
