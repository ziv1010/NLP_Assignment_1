Despite bold pledges of reform and support, the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) has once again come under fire - this time for failing to pay the national Under-17 and Under-20 women's teams for their recent participation in regional and international tournaments.\nThe young footballers, who represented the country in last month's COSAFA U-17 Girls Championship and the FIFA U-20 World Cup Qualifiers, are still waiting for camping allowances, participation fees, and tournament bonuses. The U-17 side exited the COSAFA tournament in the semi-finals, while the U-20 team was knocked out by Rwanda in a tightly contested two-legged qualifier.\nZIFA's silence on the matter has only deepened the players' sense of betrayal.\n\"It's frustrating that we spend weeks in camp and compete for the country, only to come back with nothing,\" said one player, speaking anonymously. \"Some of us are supporting families, others are still in school and needed that money to clear school debts. It's disheartening.\"\nThe situation has triggered widespread outrage within the local football fraternity. Club officials say ZIFA's recurring failures to honour basic commitments are a direct attack on the future of women's football.\n\"We've lost all faith in ZIFA,\" said one club representative. \"We're now considering not releasing players for national duty. This has been going on for too long - even with the new executive in charge, nothing has changed.\"\nThe latest incident adds to a growing list of grievances, dating back years. In 2019, the Mighty Warriors and U-20 players were reportedly handed just US$15 after returning from the COSAFA tournament. In 2016, the senior team made history by qualifying for the Olympic Games in Brazil, only to return home unpaid. To date, many of those players say they have never received their dues.\nTravel arrangements for the teams have also long been a point of concern, with players on multiple occasions forced to use public transport and endure uncomfortable, at times unsafe, conditions.\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\nResponding to TellZim News, ZIFA CEO Yvonne Manwa said she would comment on the issue but cited a hectic schedule due to election nominations and an upcoming international fixture.\nMeanwhile, ZIFA president Nqobile Magwizi, who took office with a promise to prioritise women's football, has insisted that structural reforms are underway.\n\"We are working on a robust framework to address these issues. It's taken us three months, but we want to get it right,\" Magwizi said last month on ZTN's The Couch. \"Women's football can be one of our success stories - we just need the right support system.\"\nMagwizi added that the association is in talks with foreign football bodies to learn from their models. A visit to South Africa, where the SAFA directly runs the women's league, was cited as a potential template for Zimbabwe.\n\"We need to sit down and decide what model works best for Zimbabwe. We're also consulting local stakeholders and expect to have a more sustainable structure within five months.\"\nDespite the reassurances, no tangible improvements have materialised, and frustration continues to grow. For many players, hope is fading fast.\n\"How long must we wait?\" asked one affected footballer. \"It feels like every tournament ends in disappointment. We keep hearing about plans, but nothing ever happens.\"\nThe cries from Zimbabwe's young female footballers are not just about unpaid allowances - they are about dignity, respect, and the right to be treated fairly while representing their country. As the wait for reform drags on, the real question remains:\nWill there ever be meaningful change for women's football in Zimbabwe - or will promises continue to fall on deaf ears?\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\nThe young footballers, who represented the country in last month's COSAFA U-17 Girls Championship and the FIFA U-20 World Cup Qualifiers, are still waiting for camping allowances, participation fees, and tournament bonuses.
