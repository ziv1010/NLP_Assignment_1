It is... -\nUkraine to receive $800M in US support for 2026-2027\nOn Sunday, December 7, US lawmakers unveiled the final text of the defense policy bill, which includes record funding for national security as well as aid for Ukraine, according to Reuters, Fox News, and AOL.Media reports state that the bill allocates $901 billion for military spending for fiscal year 2026-$8 billion more than what President Donald Trump requested in May of this year.The legislation also assists Ukraine.“The legislation reauthorizes the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative at $400 million per year for fiscal years 2026 and 2027,” Fox News reports.Additionally, the US Congress will require more frequent reporting on allied contributions to... -\nWith emotion, judge accepts diversion request for UCSC student charged in 2024 pro-Palestine encampment raid\nSuperior Court Judge Mandy Tovar surprised herself, and a Santa Cruz courtroom, when she became emotional Thursday as she explained her decision to grant diversion to a UC Santa Cruz student protester who faces charges of remaining at a riot and resisting an officer. -\nVideo shows Oklahoma troopers dodging tires, commercial vehicle driver hauling unsecured load handed over to ICE\nThe Oklahoma Highway Patrol (OHP) shared dash cam video from a recent incident involving an unsecured load of tires hauled by a commercial vehicle driver identified by troopers as a citizen of Kyrgyzstan.

The Arc4-class Buran attempted four times since December 2 to push south into Ob Bay, alternately following closely behind two nuclear icebreakers, 50 Let Pobedy and Arktika, working to open a path through the ice. Two nearby Arc7 LNG carriers in service of neighboring Yamal LNG project were also... -\nThe Genius That's STILL Standing With Ukraine\nA real funny take on Ukraine.

President Donald Trump branded one foe who did so “deceitful and potentially criminal.” He called another “CROOKED” on Truth Social and pushed the attorney general to take action. But years earlier, Trump did the very thing he’s accusing his enemies of, records show. In 1993, Trump signed a mortgage for a “Bermuda style” home in Palm Beach, Florida, pledging that it would be his principal residence. Just seven weeks later, he got another mortgage for a seven-bedroom, marble-floored neighboring... -\nDick's Sporting Good Theft Suspects [Sheriff Grady Judd]\nSheriff Grady Judd Press Conference Eight teens from PA here in Polk to compete in football tournament arrested for felony retail theft at Posner Park Media Contact: Juliana Rivera, PIO The Polk County Sheriff’s Office has arrested eight teenagers who were caught in the act of conspiring to steal more than $2,000 worth of merchandise from Dick’s Sporting Goods in Posner Plaza, Davenport.

Discovery \"could be a problem\" because of the amount of market share the resulting company would have. The value of the deal balloons to more than $82 billion when debt is accounted for.

There were many reasons why. Biden’s Green New Deal policies drove up the cost of fuel, feed, and fertilizer. His “eat soy” range war against ranchers restricted access to grazing lands. His drunken-sailor spending fueled historic food-price inflation. But all of these drivers were amplified — and exploited — by extreme market concentration in the beef industry. The Big Beef Four — Cargill, JBS (Brazil), Tyson Foods, and National Beef — control 80 to 85 percent of U.S.... -\nData centers for AI could nearly triple San Jose’s energy use.

He's one of the most disgusting people I have ever had the displeasure of sitting across a table from. He called me a conspiracy theorist in front...\nBrowse by Forum\nGet Connected!
