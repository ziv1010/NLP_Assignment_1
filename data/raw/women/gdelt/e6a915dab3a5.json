The series follows Korean-American rapper-singer Jessi, the South Korean boy group CRAVITY, and the multinational girl group BLACKSWAN, exploring the highs and lows of their lives while confronting the grueling work it takes to be a K-pop icon. The series is executive produced by Todd Lubin, Jack Turner, Jay Peterson, Bradley Cramp, Chris Kasick, Eric Yujin Kim, Sue Kim, and Elise Chung. Ahead of its premiere, K-Pop Idols was hailed as a surprisingly raw and honest look at the world of K-pop. While the K-pop industry has a reputation for demanding nothing but perfection from its stars, the show puts just as much focus on the dark sides of the industry as it does on the glitz. Featuring some of the industry’s biggest stars narrating deeply personal stories, the show is a must-watch for K-pop fans but also an eye-opener for audiences who may not be that familiar with the intimate details of this global phenomenon.\n‘Drops of God’ (2023 - Present)\nRotten Tomatoes: 100% | IMDb: 8.0/10\n- Release Date\n- 2023 - 2022\n- Network\n- Apple TV\n- Directors\n- Oded Ruskin\n- Writers\n- Quoc Dang Tran, Alice Vial\nCast\n-\nFleur GeffrierCamille Léger\n-\nTomohisa YamashitaIssei Tomine\n-\nTom WozniczkaThomas Chassangre\n-\nStanley WeberAlexandre Léger\n- Creator(s)\n- Quoc Dang Tran\nBased on the manga series of the same name, Drops of God follows Camille (Fleur Geffrier), the daughter of enology icon Alexandre Léger (Stanley Weber). After her father’s death, Camille learns that she received the most impressive wine collection in the world in his will and must now battle with her father’s protege, Issei Tomine (Tomohisa Yamashita), for what she believes is rightfully hers. So beloved it has received the acclaimed 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, Drops of God has taken an already superb source material and perfectly translated it for the screen. Bolstered by a talented cast working with delightfully detailed scripts, Drops of God is the sort of series that always leaves you desperate for more — and will almost certainly age like a fine wine. - Jake Hodges\n‘Bad Monkey’ (2024 - Present)\nRotten Tomatoes: 100%\nBased on the novel of the same name by Carl Hiaasen, Bad Monkey is an investigative series created by Bill Lawrence, the television creator-producer best known for shows like Scrubs and Cougar Town. The show follows a former Miami PD detective, Andrew Yancy, who now works as a health inspector in South Florida. When a severed arm is discovered by a tourist, Yancy sets out on an investigation that sends him into a world of greed and corruption full of eccentric people and unexpected risks, all while navigating his personal struggles. Vince Vaughn returns to television leading the cast of Bad Monkey as the troubled ex-cop Andrew Yancy, appearing alongside the likes of Michelle Monaghan, Jodie Turner-Smith, Meredith Hagner, Rob Delaney, and Natalie Martinez. Essentially a new take on classic cop shows, Bad Monkey is a quirky and darkly funny story about a washed-up detective struggling to find himself and prove his worth, anchored by Vaughn’s performance as the eccentric lead.\n‘Women in Blue’ (2024 - Present)\nRotten Tomatoes: 100% | IMDb: 6.6/10\nWomen in Blue\n- Genre\n- Crime, Drama\n- Debut Date\n- July 31, 2024\n- Studio\n- Apple TV+\n- Language\n- Spanish\n- Number of Seasons\n- 1\nApple TV’s exciting slate of 2024 dramas continues with Women in Blue, also titled Las Azules. The series follows four women intent on breaking patriarchal norms in Mexico as they become the country’s first female police force. However, their passion soon turns to anger, as it is revealed that their employment was made as a publicity stunt instead of a heartfelt move forward. A timely series with its finger on the pulse, Women in Blue showcases the cynical side of modern representation. Featuring top performances and a story that will resonate with many who watch it, Women in Blue is well worth your time and is yet another top addition to Apple TV’s brilliant catalog. - Jake Hodges\n‘Time Bandits’ (2024 - Present)\nRotten Tomatoes: 79% | IMDb: 5.9/10\nTime Bandits\n- Genre\n- Fantasy, Adventure, Comedy\n- Debut Date\n- July 24, 2024\nBased on Terry Gilliam’s 1981 film of the same name, Time Bandits is a fantasy adventure series created by Jemaine Clement, Iain Morris, and Taika Waititi. Like the movie, the new 10-episode series follows a young history nerd on a comedic journey through time and space alongside a ragtag group of thieves. The show features an ensemble cast that includes Clement, Waititi, Lisa Kudrow, Kal-El Tuck, Charlyne Yi, and more. Taika Waititi also directed some episodes and co-wrote the first two with co-creators Jemaine Clement and Iain Morris. The original 1981 film is an acclaimed classic, so expectations for Apple TV+’s Time Bandits series have been high ever since it was first announced in 2018. With the promise of adventure, fantasy, and time-travel hijinks, the show promises to be an exciting watch for both fans of the original movie and a new generation of viewers. However, it’s worth noting that the show’s production has also been marred by controversy.\n‘Lady in the Lake’ (2024)\nRotten Tomatoes: 71% | IMDb: 5.9/10\n- Release Date\n- 2024 - 2024-00-00\n- Writers\n- Laura Lippman\nCast\n-\nMoses Ingram\n-\nY'lan Noel\n-\nMikey Madison\n- Creator(s)\nApple TV’s run of excellent big-budget dramas continues with Lady in the Lake, a limited series starring Natalie Portman. Portman plays housewife Maddie Schwartz in 1960s Baltimore as her intrigue in an unsolved murder sets her on the path to becoming an investigative journalist. This stylish, sophisticated series makes for another in the line of monthly eye-catching releases from Apple TV in the wake of the likes of Dark Matter and Presumed Innocent. Lady in the Lake features a stellar ensemble cast but catches attention thanks to the inclusion of Portman. Enticing and thought-provoking, Lady in the Lake is a wonderful addition to Apple TV’s current slate of shows. - Jake Hodges\n'Sunny' (2024 - Present)\nRotten Tomatoes: 91% | IMDb: 6.9/10\nSunny\n- Genre\n- Comedy, Drama\n- Debut Date\n- July 10, 2024\n- Number of Seasons\n- 1\nThe life of an American woman living in Kyoto, Japan, is upended when her husband and son disappear in a mysterious plane crash. As consolation, she's given Sunny, one of a new class of domestic robots made by her husband's electronics company.\nBased on Colin O'Sullivan’s novel The Dark Manual, Sunny is a 10-episode dark comedy mystery series created by Katie Robbins. The series stars Rashida Jones as Suzie Sakamoto, a woman living in Kyoto whose husband and son vanish in a plane crash. Suzie believed her husband worked with refrigerators, but when his company gifts her an exuberant domestic robot that he built, she starts to question what other secrets he may have been hiding. The series also stars Hidetoshi Nishijima, Joanna Sotomura, annie the clumsy, You, Judy Ongg, and Jun Kunimura. Ahead of its release, Sunny received great reviews from critics, with praise for its cinematography, its timely take on AI, and Rashida Jones’s layered performance in the lead. The show is part paranoid thriller and part contemplation on grief, with plenty of snarky humor thrown into the mix.\n'WondLa' (2024 - Present)\nRotten Tomatoes: 50% | IMDb: 7.3/10\n- Release Date\n- 2024 - 2025-00-00\n- Network\n- Apple TV+\n- Directors\n- Lawrence Gong, Andrew L. Schmidt\nCast\n-\nJeanine MasonEva (voice)\n-\nTeri HatcherMuthr (voice)\n-\nD. C. DouglasOmnipod (voice)\n-\nGary Anthony WilliamsRovender / Roshon (voice)\nThis family-friendly animated series follows Eva (Jeanine Mason), a young girl with enormous spirit and drive who has been raised by a robot caretaker inside a bunker. On the day of her 16th birthday, Eva’s bunker is attacked, leaving her to fend for herself on the strange alien-hosting planet of Orbona. For those who want eye-catching animated fun without a subscription to Disney+, this is the show for you. Bursting with vibrant visuals and a story ready to warm the hearts of all generations, WondLa is somewhat of a gem hidden in Apple TV’s extensive catalog. - Jake Hodges\n'Land of Women' (2024)\nRotten Tomatoes: 75% | IMDb: 5.9/10\nLand of Women\n- Genre\n- Comedy, Drama, Thriller\n- Debut Date\n- June 26, 2024\nBased on Sandra Barneda’s bestselling novel, Land of Women follows Eva Longoria’s Gala, whose life is suddenly flipped upside down when her husband’s financial misdealings start catching up with them. With her partner having fled, Gala, her daughter, and her mother must escape themselves, settling on the peaceful Spanish countryside — although how long they can last without their secrets being exposed is another matter. Fast-paced in moments but pensive in others, Land of Women takes the time to indulge in the gorgeous vineyards it is set in, remarkably turning a furious crime comedy into a beautiful travelog of sorts. Longoria is a delight in the lead role, using her expertise in comedy to create a rounded central character that can move from tears to laughter in mere moments. Land of Women is a wonderful addition to Apple TV’s catalog. - Jake Hodges\n'Camp Snoopy' (2024 - Present)\nIMDb: 7.5/10\nCamp Snoopy\n- Genre\n- Animated, Family\n- Debut Date\n- June 14, 2024\nOne of the world’s most famous dogs, Snoopy (Terry McGurrin), is back with another animated adventure. After discovering that their Scouts troop might be at risk of dissolving, Snoopy and the team set off on a fun journey to earn all their badges, often crossing paths with Charlie Brown (Etienne Kellici) as he kicks back at Camp Spring Lake. It might be simply impossible to dislike Snoopy. This series feels like a touch of the old and a pinch of the new, managing to capture the same essence that Snoopy has always been known for, bolstered by an updated narrative and aesthetic feel. For fans of Snoopy and non-fans alike, this is well worth a watch. - Jake Hodges\n'Presumed Innocent' (2023)\nRotten Tomatoes: 83% | IMDb: 7.6/10\n- Release Date\n- 2024 - 2023\n- Directors\n- Greg Yaitanes, Anne Sewitsky\n- Writers\n- David E. Kelley\nCast\n-\nJake Gyllenhaal\nBased on Scott Turow’s 1987 novel of the same name, Presumed Innocent follows Jake Gyllenhaal’s renowned prosecutor, Rusty, whose legacy at the Chicago Prosecuting Attorney’s Office makes him one of the most admired in the state. However, said legacy — and the entire office’s — are brought into disrepute when a particularly horrific murder case has Rusty as the prime suspect. Reimagined by the brilliant David E. Kelly, this series oozes the palpable tension that radiates from the pages of the novel, with Gyllenhaal proving yet again that his acting chops are impeccable. Thrilling from minute one, Presumed Innocent becomes the next in a long line of big-budget Apple TV series, with the streamer proving to be right up there as one of the best. - Jake Hodges\n'Monarch: Legacy of Monsters' (2023 - Present)\nRotten Tomatoes: 89% | IMDb: 7.0/10\n- Release Date\n- November 16, 2023\n- Network\n- Apple TV\n- Showrunner\n- Chris Black, Matt Fraction\n- Directors\n- Julian Holmes, Matt Shakman, Mairzee Almas, Andy Goddard, Hiromi Kamata\n- Writers\n- Al Letson, Karl Taro Greenfeld, Chris Black, Mariko Tamaki, Amanda Overton, Andrew Colville, Matt Fraction, Milla Bell-Hart\n- Franchise(s)\n- Monsterverse, Godzilla, King Kong\nCast\n-\nAnna SawaiCate Randa\n-\nMay Hewitt\nThis blend of sci-fi and action based on the Godzilla franchise follows half-siblings Cate (Anna Sawai) and Kentaro Randa (Ren Watabe), who decide to investigate their father’s involvement with an organization monitoring giant monsters known as Monarch. The series also follows the early development of the organization over 50 years prior. A pulse-racing action adventure that never sacrifices character development for extravagant set-pieces, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters is enormous fun. Bringing together both Kurt and Wyatt Russell (although they never share any scenes), the show features an outstanding ensemble that perfectly captures the magnitude of the story, both in the past and present. A rollercoaster ride fit for the big screen, fans should feel lucky that this one was made for the small one. - Jake Hodges\n'Awkward' (2011 - 2016)\nRotten Tomatoes: 78% | IMDb: 7.5/10\nAwkward\n- Genre\n- Comedy, Drama, Romance\n- Debut Date\n- July 19, 2011\n- Number of Seasons\n- 5\nCreated by Lauren Iungerich, Awkward follows 15-year-old Jenna Hamilton (Ashley Rickards), at the precipice of adulthood, who finds herself feeling both invisible and unpopular among her peers. However, when an unfortunate accident is mistaken for a suicide attempt, Jenna becomes suddenly popular, leading to a moral dilemma for the ages. By condensing all of the worries and troubles of a teenage mind into a ball of comedic triumph, Awkward becomes the flagship show for disenfranchised teens dreaming of a way out. By proving that popularity doesn’t equal happiness, Awkward manages to both entertain and inform with the possibility of actually changing a young life for the better. Brilliantly funny and often raunchy, Awkward is one of MTV’s best offerings of the 2010s. - Jake Hodges\n'The Big Cigar' (2024)\nRotten Tomatoes: 72% | IMDb: 5.5/10\n- Release Date\n- 2024 - 2024-00-00\n- Showrunner\n- Janine Sherman Barrois\n- Directors\n- Damon Thomas, Don Cheadle\n- Writers\n- Jim Hecht, Joshuah Bearman, Janine Sherman Barrois, Laurence Andries, Ameer Hasan, Gwendolyn M. Parker, Valerie Woods\nCast\n-\nPJ Byrne\n- Creator(s)\n- Janine Sherman Barrois\nDeveloped by Jim Hecht, The Big Cigar is a biographical drama thriller miniseries that recounts how Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton escaped to Cuba with the help of a Hollywood producer and a fake movie. The miniseries is based on Joshuah Bearman’s 2012 Playboy article of the same name and stars André Holland as Newton, appearing alongside Alessandro Nivola, Tiffany Boone, P. J. Byrne, and Marc Menchaca. While critical reception of The Big Cigar has been somewhat mixed, the show has received praise for Holland’s performance as Huey P. Newton, which is powerful and compelling. The series isn’t nearly as wild as it sounds, putting the focus firmly on real politics and real people rather than the larger-than-life fake movie that saved Newton from the FBI. And while it does fall somewhat short of its potential, The Big Cigar presents an interesting take on a famous political figure, looking for the human being behind the legend.\n'Masters of the Air' (2024)\nRotten Tomatoes: 86% | IMDb: 7.8/10\n- Release Date\n- 2024 - 2024-00-00\n- Directors\n- Cary Joji Fukunaga, Dee Rees, Anna Boden, Ryan Fleck, Timothy Van Patten\n- Writers\n- John Shiban, John Orloff\nCast\n-\nAustin Butler\nAn American war drama miniseries created by John Shiban and John Orloff, Apple TV+’s Masters of the Air is based on Donald L. Miller’s 2007 book of the same name and is executive produced by Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, and Gary Goetzman. The nine-episode series follows the story of a World War II bomber crew in eastern England and serves as a companion piece to the iconic shows Band of Brothers and The Pacific. The show boasts an ensemble cast that includes the likes of Austin Butler, Callum Turner, Anthony Boyle, and Barry Keoghan. Masters of the Air has received largely favorable reviews from critics, with great praise for its well-written characters and near-perfect production. While the series’ visual effects have been criticized, the human drama and storytelling more than make up for those flaws. While based on a true story, the series is a work of historical fiction that’s rooted in real facts but aims to fly higher, and the result is a thoroughly entertaining WWII drama.\n'Dark Matter' (2024)\nRotten Tomatoes: 69% | IMDb: 7.7/10\n- Release Date\n- May 7, 2024\n- Network\n- Apple TV+\n- Directors\n- Jakob Verbruggen, Alik Sakharov, Roxann Dawson, Logan George\n- Writers\n- Blake Crouch\nCast\n-\nDaniela Dessen\n-\nJason Dessen / Jason2\nDark Matter is a sci-fi series created by Blake Crouch that’s based on his 2016 novel of the same name. This eight-episode show follows a physicist who finds himself transported to a parallel version of his life and must find a way back to his own world. The series stars Joel Edgerton, Jennifer Connelly, Alice Braga, and more. The series has been positively received by critics, who have hailed it as a pleasingly twisty sci-fi thriller and a decent adaptation of Crouch’s novel. The series is anchored by Joel Edgerton’s performance as the varied versions of the protagonist, sharing great onscreen chemistry with both Jennifer Connelly and Alice Braga. Though its premise is hardly a fresh one, the show’s focus on regrets and the lives we could have lived is what makes it such an intriguing series.\n'The Completely Made-Up Adventure of Dick Turpin' (2024 - Present)\nRotten Tomatoes: 80% | IMDb: 7.0/10\n- Release Date\n- 2024 - 2025-00-00\n- Directors\n- Ben Palmer, George Kane\n- Writers\n- Claire Downes, Ian Jarvis, Stuart Lane, Jon Brittain, Richard Naylor\nCast\n-\nNoel Fielding\n-\nDuayne Boachie\n- Creator(s)\n- Claire Downes, Ian Jarvis, Stuart Lane\nThough he may not be quite as popular today as he used to be, Dick Turpin is a legendary British highwayman whose exploits have been romanticized in a number of Robin Hood-style stories. Was he really as dashing and charming as the stories make him out to be? Probably not, and that’s the key concept of The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin. A fictional take on Turpin’s life starring Noel Fielding as the title character, the series follows Turpin’s journey to becoming England’s greatest highwayman while staying one step ahead of the law (and other, better criminals). A hilarious work of historical comedy, The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin has received largely favorable reviews from critics. The series shows the famous highwayman as little more than a petty thief with dreams of making it big, with Fielding playing the ironic hero to perfection. The show is an absurdly funny watch, comparable to other great historical comedies like the Blackadder series and the 1993 Mel Brooks movie Robin Hood: Men in Tights.\n'Franklin' (2024)\nRotten Tomatoes: 55% | IMDb: 7.0/10\n- Release Date\n- 2024 - 2024-00-00\n- Directors\n- Tim Van Patten\n- Writers\n- Kirk Ellis, Howard Korder\nCast\n-\nNoah Jupe\n-\nThibault de Montalembert\nA biographical drama miniseries about Benjamin Franklin, Apple TV+’s Franklin stars Michael Douglas as the Founding Father. Based on a 2005 book by Stacy Schiff, the show follows the eight-year period when Franklin was in France trying to convince King Louis XVI to support the United States in the American Revolutionary War. Directed by Tim Van Patten and written by Kirk Ellis and Howard Korder, the show’s cast also includes Noah Jupe, Daniel Mays, Ludivine Sagnier, and Eddie Marsan, among others. Franklin premiered on April 12, 2024, and has received generally favorable reviews from critics. While the show’s plot and narrative are on the dry side, Michael Douglas’s performance in the lead role is what gives this period drama its spark. With an engaging combination of cunningness and humor, Douglas’ take on Benjamin Franklin is one you won’t easily forget.\n'Sugar' (2024 - Present)\nRotten Tomatoes: 81% | IMDb: 8.0/10\n- Release Date\n- April 4, 2024\n- Network\n- Apple TV\n- Showrunner\n- Mark Protosevich, Sam Catlin\n- Directors\n- Fernando Meirelles, Adam Arkin\n- Writers\n- Mark Protosevich, Donald Joh, Sam Catlin, David Rosen\nCast\n-\nColin FarrellJohn Sugar\n-\nMatthew ArkinRabbi\n-\nMiguel SandovalThomas Kinzie\n-\nScott LawrenceDr. Vickers\n- Creator(s)\n- Mark Protosevich\nAn off-beat noir drama with a fascinating lead, Sugar is a mystery series created by Mark Protosevich that stars Colin Farrell as an LA private detective. The show’s star-studded cast also features the likes of Kirby Howell-Baptiste, Amy Ryan, and Nate Corddry. The eight-episode series follows John Sugar (Farrell), a private detective, as he investigates the disappearance of a Hollywood producer's granddaughter. Critical reception to Sugar has been largely positive, and Farrell, in particular, is amazing as a Humphrey Bogart-esque private eye who unearths unexpected secrets and wrestles personal demons like the best of them. Farrell’s cool, understated performance is the main reason to watch the series, but the plot and narrative are quite enjoyable as well, especially if you’re a fan of pulpy detective fiction. The show is very much a take on classic noir, and while it’s not without flaws, Sugar is a welcome treat for fans of the genre. It’s a combination of Alfred Hitchcock and Dashiell Hammet with a modern sensibility — and it just might be your new favorite detective show.\n'Manhunt' (2024 - Present)\nRotten Tomatoes: 87% | IMDb: 7.2/10\n- Release Date\n- 2024 - 2024-00-00\n- Showrunner\n- Monica Beletsky\n- Directors\n- John Dahl, Carl Franklin\n- Writers\n- Monica Beletsky\n- Creator(s)\n- Monica Beletsky\nCreated by Monica Beletsky, Manhunt is a historical drama miniseries following the hunt for John Wilkes Booth after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Adapted from James L. Swanson's book Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase for Lincoln's Killer, the show stars Tobias Menzies, Lovie Simone, Patton Oswalt, and more, with Anthony Boyle as Booth and Hamish Linklater as Lincoln. Part history lesson and part conspiracy thriller, Manhunt is a dramatized and fictional look at a landmark moment in American history. The series has gained positive reviews from critics for its powerful performances and for how it makes its historical subject matter relevant to modern times. It’s a surprisingly thrilling show with great production value, including great costumes, a talented ensemble cast, and a deeply layered political narrative. The most important thing about Manhunt, however, is the way it educates audiences about an important chapter in history through an entertaining lens.\n'Palm Royale' (2024 - Present)\nRotten Tomatoes: 53% | IMDb: 6.6/10\nPalm Beach high society in the late 60s is a very exclusive scene, and Maxine Simmons (Kristen Wiig) hopes to join their ranks — no matter what it takes. Created by Abe Sylvia and based on Juliet McDaniel’s 2018 novel Mr. & Mrs. American Pie, Palm Royale is a 10-episode dramedy miniseries that follows Maxine’s story, with the likes of Ricky Martin, Laura Dern, and Allison Janney starring alongside Wiig. The series premiered its first three episodes on Apple TV+ on March 20, with the rest following weekly. And while the critical response to Palm Royale has been rather mixed, the responses from the audience have been largely positive. The biggest highlight of the miniseries is its visual style and production. Simply put, it’s wonderful to look at, showcasing Palm Beach as a veritable paradise. The performances of its star-studded cast are also a major draw. Wiig is phenomenal as the ambitious Maxine, utterly capturing the audience’s attention. Though the narrative can be bumpy (especially at the beginning), the sheer beauty of the series, combined with its cast of fabulous and hilarious characters, makes Palm Royale a thoroughly engaging watch.\n'Constellation' (2024 - Present)\nRotten Tomatoes: 75% | IMDb: 7.1/10\n- Release Date\n- 2024 - 2024-00-00\n- Showrunner\n- Peter Harness\n- Directors\n- Michelle Maclaren\n- Writers\n- Peter Harness\nCreated by writer Peter Harness, Constellation is a captivating science-fiction thriller starring Noomi Rapace (It Happened to Monday) alongside Jonathan Banks (Better Call Saul). Rapace navigates the mysterious series, playing a distraught astronaut who must return home to Earth after an unexpected disaster leaves her desperate for answers. Through an eerie premise peppered with suspense, Constellation unravels a gripping quest for truth by intersecting the human brain with the enigma of space travel and the universe at large.\nRosie Coleman and Davina Coleman hold their own opposite Rapace, providing an uneasy vibe throughout the haunting series. Featuring grounded performances in an untethered world, Harness allows his action-packed thrills to mesmerize in an undeniably creepy atmosphere, only begging for more to be revealed. - Yael Tygiel\n'The New Look' (2024 - Present)\nRotten Tomatoes: 58% | IMDb: 6.9/10\n- Release Date\n- 2024 - 2024-00-00\n- Directors\n- Helen Shaver, Todd A. Kessler, Julia Ducournau, Jeremy Podeswa\n- Writers\n- Todd A. Kessler\nThe New Look covers the rise of now-iconic fashion designer Christian Dior as he goes head-to-head in the cutthroat industry against Coco Chanel. A period piece, the show is set during World War II, adding to the tension and conflict within the show’s storylines as Dior attempts to introduce the world to modern fashion. Created by Todd A. Kassler (Damages), the show premiered on February 13th, 2024.\nThe New Look stars Ben Mendelson (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) as Christian Dior, Juliette Binoche (The English Patient) as Coco Chanel, alongside David Kammenos (Supersex), Maisie Williams (Game of Thrones), Joseph Olivennes (Versailles), and John Malkovich (Being John Malkovich). Audiences have enjoyed the show’s look and high-quality production value, as well as the cast’s terrific acting.\n'Calls' (2021 - Present)\nRotten Tomatoes: 95% | IMDb: 7.7/10\n- Release Date\n- 2021 - 2021-00-00\nCast\n-\nNika Futterman\n-\nMatt Lauria\nA groundbreaking series unfolds entirely through phone calls, voicemails, and abstract visuals, revealing a mysterious and disturbing sequence of events affecting several individuals. Each episode explores different characters' experiences as they face eerie and often catastrophic phenomena, leading to a chilling realization about their interconnected fates.\nMany horror writers and directors have harped on the importance of the viewer's imagination, believing that what the audience can think up will always be scarier than anything that can be shown on screen. Apple TV+'s Calls takes this to the extreme, as it consists of nine twelve-minute-long episodes where visuals are minimal and audio is everything. The viewer is eavesdropping on all sorts of calls, from ones involving plane crashes to murder to weird bodily occurrences.\nThe show premiered in 2021 and was praised for its voice actors, a cast composed of very well-known names in entertainment. With appearances by Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Recreation), Rosario Dawson (Rent), Joey King (The Act), Edi Patterson (The Righteous Gemstones), Judy Greer (Thirteen Going on Thirty), Ben Schwartz (The Afterparty), and Karen Gillan (Guardians of the Galaxy), it's almost as fun to figure out whose voice is whose as it is to figure out the mystery of each episode. - Emily Cappello\n'Prehistoric Planet' (2022 - 2023)\nRotten Tomatoes: 90% | IMDb: 8.5/10\nTravel back 66 million years to when majestic dinosaurs and extraordinary creatures roamed the lands, seas, and skies.\nYou know it's going to be amazing quality if Jon Favreau (The Mandalorian) is involved, and Prehistoric Planet is no exception. The Apple TV+ show time travels back 66 million years and takes its audience to the time of dinosaurs. Directed by Andrew Jones and Adam Valdez, the show premiered in 2022 and ran for two seasons.\nEach episode of Prehistoric Planet tackles a different area of the world where dinosaurs thrived, from deserts to swamps to the badlands. Viewers are taken on an immersive tour through the world and shown incredibly lifelike representations of what these places would have looked like when dinosaurs still lived. And where there's an epic show about the planet, there's an epic score. Prehistoric Planet was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Music Composition\" by Kara Talve (The Planets), Anze Rozman (Beckham), and Hans Zimmer (Pirates of the Caribbean). While it only ran for two seasons, it was critically acclaimed for its state-of-the-art visuals and \"immersive narration\" by David Attenborough (Blue Planet II). - Emily Cappello\n'The Reluctant Traveler with Eugene Levy' (2023 - Present)\nRotten Tomatoes: 87% | IMDb: 7.5/10\nIf Eugene Levy is in it, it's already iconic. That is the case with The Reluctant Traveler with Eugene Levy, an Apple TV+ documentary series that takes viewers around the world to some of the most unbelievable hotels. While in each location, Levy also explores the culture, the food, and the people of the area, all while delivering his classic Levy deadpan sass. Other than those he meets in his travels, Levy largely holds the show on his own, which is a feat few could do without boring their audience; however, Levy proves once again why he is one of the best as he travels through the show with ease.\nProduced by Lucy Evans (Visionaries) and Laura Senior (Doctor Who: The Monthly Adventures), the show premiered in 2023 and visited Finland, Costa Rica, Venice, Utah, Maldives, South Africa, Lisbon, and Tokyo in its first season, with Levy refereeing a sumo match in the season finale.
