  "body_text": "LOS ANGELES — The work in progress continues progressing for Angel City Football Club.\nEntering the game with a modest three-game unbeaten streak, ACFC made it four thanks to a 77th-minute header from Maiara Niehues in a 2-1 victory over Northern California rival Bay FC in front of 14,971 on Monday night at BMO Stadium.\nNiehues’ attempt just eluded the outstretched arm of Bay FC goalkeeper Jordan Silkowitz for the winning goal\nThe win was the first for Angel City in four league meetings against Bay FC.\n“It’s a win at home. That’s (what) we’re always work(ing for),” Angel City forward Riley Tiernan said. “We’ve had two intense weeks and it showed on the field.”\nAngel City (6-7-5) moves to 23 points and into ninth place in the 14-team NWSL, just outside of playoff position. Last year’s team finished the 26-game regular season with 24 points.\n“The game was going both ways. We had some great moments and they also had some chances,” Angel City defender Sarah Gorden said. “Leading 2-1 late, the fans always carry us through. It was so hard to be away (on the road). This league is so physically demanding, and the energy that they (the fans) bring changes games for us.”\nAngel City took a 1-0 lead in the 11th minute on Tiernan’s eighth goal of the season.\nRiley Tiernan's 8th goal of her rookie season was a beauty with the left foot 👏 pic.twitter.com/fO68aKZVbI\n— National Women’s Soccer League (@NWSL) September 2, 2025\nRachel Hill scored the equalizer for Bay FC (4-9-5, 17 points) in the 37th minute as Rachel Hill knocked home her own rebound to make it 1-1. It was the first goal allowed in the last three games by Angel City goalkeeper Hannah Seabert.\nIf there was a cloud hanging over the proceedings, it was the news about the accelerated progress in talks of a potential move by Chelsea FC to sign Alyssa Thompson.\nAccording to Tom Garry of the Guardian, “talks are progressing.” Thompson, who currently has six goals this season, the most in her brief career, missed Monday’s game with what was listed on the availability report as an “excused absence.” Garry initially reported Chelsea’s interest last Thursday.\nThe move, which would certainly be a big blow to the Angel City fans, could bring in a large transfer fee for the club. The current record world transfer fee in women’s soccer is the $1.5 million that the Orlando Pride paid Tigres (Liga MX) for Lizbeth Ovalle last month. Naomi Girma’s move from San Diego Wave to Chelsea netted $1.1 million, still the highest outgoing fee for an NWSL club.\nIf last week’s game against Orlando was her last game in an Angel City uniform, she left on a high note, scoring the game-winning goal. In a little less than three years, she has scored 15 goals with 11 assists.\nWhen asked if he had anything to update about the situation, Angel City coach Alex Straus said, “not much.”\n“We lost three other international players and we got better,” he said. “I think this group, the way they work and how you can grow together, I’m so proud of them today. It’s not been easy with all of these things … speculation. But anybody, if it’s me … none of us is bigger than the club. We focus on that, what is our value together? And if somebody leaves at some point, somebody has left a couple of weeks ago, I think it does something to a group. It’s not easy, but it’s how you manage it. If I’m being honest, the last couple of days, it’s been difficult. It’s been hard for me in my position when things change.”\nThe transfer deadline for the WSL is Thursday.\nAngel City’s next game is Sunday at eighth-place Gotham FC (6-6-6, 24 points), followed by another road game on Sept. 13 against 10th-place North Carolina (5-7-6, 21 points). The next home game is Sept. 18 against the second-place Washington Spirit (9-4-5, 32 points).\nMaiara Niehues with a beauty for her first NWSL goal 👏 pic.twitter.com/WIjTJDwqKA\n— National Women’s Soccer League (@NWSL) September 2, 2025",
