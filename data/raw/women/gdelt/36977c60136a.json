  "body_text": "Rooney: CU Buffs 3 extra points (Aug. 18, 2025)\nBuffZone writer Pat Rooney discusses three topics regarding CU Buffs athletics with the football opener inching closer.\nShouldering the load\nThis certainly isn’t an original point. Or one CU football fans haven’t heard over and over before. But the Buffs will only go as far as the offensive line takes them.\nThis season, though, that may hold more true than ever.\nThe biggest question mark ahead of each of Colorado’s first two seasons under head coach Deion Sanders might very well have been the offensive line. Those lines never really put the questions to rest. It’s easy to say in retrospect that it didn’t matter last year, when the Buffs delivered a nine-win season to their long-starved fans thanks mostly to the marquee individual skills of Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter, quarterback Shedeur Sanders, and an array of NFL-caliber receivers. Still, what might the team’s ceiling have been with even a decent offensive line?\nThere are no surefire future NFL draft picks — at least not yet — ready to save the day, week after week, this fall. The Buffs have to run the ball, particularly if it indeed is Liberty transfer Kaidon Salter who takes over at quarterback. Salter and a still-talented group of receivers are quite capable of making plays through the air, but not if the Buffs are constantly playing behind the count in terms of down and distance.\nLed by Shedeur last year, the Buffs ranked sixth in the nation in average passing yards and tied for 31st in scoring, but ranked just 64th nationally in third-down conversions. That could be attributed to how often CU faced third-and-long thanks to sacks, penalties and a lack of a running game.\nJordan Seaton is a stud at left tackle, but he can’t block everybody. Staying ahead of the chains will be critical this season.\nOpening showdown\nIt’s folly to put the hopes and dreams of a season on one game. But hey, let’s do it anyway.\nThe Buffs might face a sort of swing game right out of the gate with the opening battle against Georgia Tech.\nThe rest of CU’s nonconference schedule is favorable with home dates against Delaware and Wyoming. Delaware was a premier FCS-level program before making the transition to FBS this year, but those teams shouldn’t come into Folsom Field and win. Wyoming generally is considered a lower-tier team in the Mountain West heading into the season. In between those dates, the Buffs visit Houston for the conference opener in what might be the most favorable matchup on CU’s entire Big 12 schedule.\nOf course, the Big 12 taught us last year what looks tough (or not) on paper in August might not mean anything in October. Still, Georgia Tech defeated Miami and took Georgia to a ridiculous eight overtimes within a three-week span late last season. Tech is considered by many to be a dark horse candidate in the ACC.\nBack-to-back bowl games haven’t happened for CU in exactly 20 years, since the Buffs went to the 2004 Houston Bowl (the program’s last bowl win, a 33-28 decision against UTEP) and the 2005 Champs Sports Bowl. Losing the opener won’t ruin anything. But grab a win against Georgia Tech and set the stage for a 4-0 start, and the Buffs will be well on their way toward another bowl date.\nKicking off\nThe CU women’s soccer team kicked off the 2025-26 athletic calendar with a pair of opening week matches at home, playing to a 1-1 draw against No. 12 Michigan State before toppling Air Force 4-1 on Sunday.\nThe Buffs’ defense has given up too many shots so far — 35 total and 13 on goal in the two games — but the early concern for CU might simply be the team’s health. Standout midfielder Ava Priest played limited minutes off the bench in the opener and didn’t play at all against Air Force. Also against Air Force defender Kenzi Gillispie, a graduate transfer and previously a four-starter at Kansas State, exited with an apparent knee injury.\nIt was a missed opportunity against the Spartans, but certainly not a crushing one. CU will have another strong RPI opportunity at Wisconsin on Sept. 7, and then plenty more during Big 12 play. The Buffs haven’t reached three consecutive NCAA Tournaments since a run of three berths in a row ended in 2008. This year’s squad has the talent to repeat that feat if the Buffs can be fully healthy by the time Big 12 play arrives.",
