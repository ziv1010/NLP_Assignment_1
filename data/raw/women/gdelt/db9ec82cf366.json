  "body_text": "Thursday’s transfer deadline has come and gone in women’s professional football, and the window has now slammed shut without an official word about the signing of Keira Walsh.\nChelsea FC Women ‘confident’ Keira Walsh deal got done in time — report\nJust before the deadline?\nChelsea were the talk of rumor-town the last couple days, coming seemingly out of nowhere to snag the England international midfielder from Barcelona, where her contract was set to expire at the end of the season. Reportedly, we had the 27-year-old booked in for a medical on Thursday, which she was expected to attend in person despite some initial reluctance from Barca to let her go.\nBut reports, such as from The Guardian, late on Thursday night have assured us that the medical and the transfer has gone through without a hitch, with Chelsea “confident” that all paperwork has been submitted “in time” (i.e. before 11pm GMT) for the €550k transfer — or half the world record that we just set with the transfer of Naomi Girma.\nLet’s hope these reports are true!",
