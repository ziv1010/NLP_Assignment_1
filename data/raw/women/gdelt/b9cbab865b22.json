  "body_text": "September 17th, 2013\n$6 trillion in new national debt under Obama after he promised to decrease the deficit.\nObamacare A massive and incredibly convoluted bill which exponentially increases the federal governments control over our personal lives which neither Obama nor a single Democrat even read before passing, and which will likely bankrupt the nation.\nIn both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, the Obama campaign purposely disabled the credit card verification system for its Web site donations, allowing anyone from any foreign country to donate with no limit and no proof of identity; in both elections it was demonstrated that people overseas and people with obviously false identities were able to donate to Obama campaign, in direct violation of several laws. To this day it is not known what percentage of Obamas campaign funds are illegally obtained, since there is no documentation.\nBillions of taxpayer dollars gambled on green companies like Solyndra, NextEra, Ener1, Solar Trust and many others all of which went bankrupt.\nAn intentional refusal to enforce federal immigration laws.\nUnemployment at or above 8% for almost his entire term in office (which was actually closer to 15% actual unemployment).\nOperation Fast & Furious a government-sponsored illegal gun-running scheme designed to purposely go awry so as to induce public outcry for gun control.\nSpent 20 years listening to a racist anti-American pastor (Rev. Jeremiah Wright), whom Obama described as a mentor. On March 18, 2008, Obama gave a speech in which he said I could no more disown Jeremiah Wright than I could disown my own grandmother and [Wright's church, Trinity United] embodies the black community in its entirety. Now Obama tries to pretend that Jeremiah Wright doesnt exist, and that his extremist anti-white philosophy didnt influence Obamas worldview.\nIncreased the percentage of Americans dependent on food stamps to unprecedented levels (now over 15% of the nations population).\nMilitarily intervened in Libya in 2011 without the Congressional approval required by the War Powers Act technically an impeachable offense.\nBefore he entered politics, Obama worked as a lawyer suing banks in landmark cases, forcing them to give home loans to unqualified minority borrowers a practice now understood as one of the primary initial causes of the eventual housing bubble and market collapse.\nHanded out over 1,200 waivers to politically connected donors exempting them from the onerous requirements of Obamacare.\nGreatly expanding the number of unaccountable czars, which essentially amounts to unilaterally adding new federal departments with no congressional oversight leading to a true bureaucracy in the original sense (rule by unelected bureaucrats).\nUsing taxpayer dollars to bail out the private pension funds of autoworkers unions at GM & Chrysler.\nIllegally ending the welfare-to-work requirements passed by Congress.\nDoling out $800 billion in stimulus cash for shovel-ready jobs that didnt exist the money just evaporated with no measurable economic benefit.\nAlienating and isolating Israel, our strongest ally in the Middle East.\nApologizing to Islamists and terrorists for offending them.\nUnder Obamas watch, for the first time in history Americas credit rating was downgraded, due to his poor economic policies.\nStopped American oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, allowing other nations with worse environmental records to drill instead thereby managing to both weaken our economy and damage the environment simultaneously.\nProposed in 2008 to intentionally bankrupt the coal industry and now lies to voters and workers in coal-producing regions about his true intent.\nPretends to be concerned about skyrocketing energy prices, when in fact he vowed to increase them on purpose (so as to make alternative energy schemes more competitive.)\nIn a primary debate against Hillary Clinton in 2008, Obama said he would never force people to buy health insurance, since those without it couldnt afford to buy it. Less than two years later, he rammed through Obamacare, which does indeed force people to buy health insurance.\nDuring the 2008 campaign, Obama repeatedly promised that if he was elected No family making less than $250,000 will see any form of tax increase. This promise was broken over and over again once he was elected.\nIn 2008 Obama vowed if elected to increase security along the U.S.-Mexican border and then in 2010 stopped construction of a virtual fence on the border and re-routed money earmarked for border security to other projects.\nCash for Clunkers, which doled out taxpayer money to anyone who wanted to replace their old cars, but which mostly only ended up subsidizing the puchase of foreign-made cars by people who could have afforded them on their own anyway; meanwhile, the traded-in cars were all destroyed, creating a shortage and thereby increasing the cost of used cars, hurting the pocketbooks of poor people.\nViolated the U.S. Constitution by authorizing assassinations and drone strikes to kill American citizens abroad without due process.\nWas caught on a hot mike promising the President of Russia that he would cave in to their demands for a weaker missile shield after he was re-elected and no longer had to keep up the pretense that he sought to defend America.\nAppointed Van Jones, a former avowed communist who supported a 9/11 Truth petition, to be Green Jobs Czar.\nAppointed Anita Dunn, who said Chairman Mao was her favorite philosopher, to be White House Communications Director.\nAppointed John Holdren, who perviously entertained the notion of forced mass sterilzation to stop overpopulation, to be Science Czar.\nAppointed Steven Chu, who openly advocated an artificial increase in gasoline prices to $10/gallon (and similar increases in other energy prices) to be Secretary of Energy.\nAppointed Kevin Jennings, who led a group that promoted X-rated sex-positive textbooks for 13-year-olds, instructed teenagers at a conference how to perform fisting (anal penetration by fists), who refused to report instances of statutory rape, and who expressed admiration for a member of NAMBLA, to be Americas Safe Schools Czar.\nWhen states voted to enforce the federal immigration laws which the federal government refused to enforced, Obama sued to stop them.\nBlocked continued construction of the Keystone Pipeline, thereby intentionally reducing energy resources for the US and forcing Canada to sell more of its oil to China.\nRepeatedly changed his position on gay marriage over the years, depending on what was politically expedient at the moment and which intended audience he was addressing.\nBefore he was president, Obama staunchly opposed raising the national debt limit but once elected, he insisted that it be raised.\nWhen giving a 2009 speech in France that he must have assumed Americans would never hear, he described the United States as arrogant and dismissive (while also criticizing Europe elsewhere in the speech).\nWhen states tried to stop election fraud with voter ID laws, Obama sued to prevent them from doing so.\nInstructed Attorney General Eric Holder to stonewall any investigation into the voter intimidation case against the New Black Panthers.\nPromised in 2008 that once elected he would officially recognize the Armenian Genocide; but to this date he has still failed to do so, caving in to threats and pressure from Turkey.\nVowed to end the influence of lobbyists in Washington, but under Obamas watch their influence has only increased.\nWhen he was first running for President, Obama promised, I will not sign any non-emergency bill without giving the American public an opportunity to review and comment on the White House website for five days. Needless to say, he has broken that promise with almost every bill he has signed since.\nAided and abetted the Arab Spring which deposed existing secular governments across North Africa, leading to a regional power vacuum which was filled by Al Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood, and other hardline Islamists.\nRefused to provide assistance or support the the earlier secular Iranian democracy uprising, allowing them to be crushed by the Islamic fundamentalist Iranian regime.\nIn his first months in office, Obama bowed to the king of Saudi Arabia, the president of China, the Emperor of Japan, and President of Mexico, among others.\nOrdered NASA to make one of its top priorities not space exploration or scientific research but Muslim outreach.\nUsed Obamacare as a pretext to greatly increase the size and power of the IRS (which was given 16,000 new agents and additional mandates to penalize taxpayers for noncompliance).\nUsed the IRS to harass conservative businesses.\nIn the GM bailout, he illegally shortchanged investors who according to bankruptcy laws were first in line to be recompensed; instead, he gave their share to the unions.\nShut down oil drilling in the US, but then turned around and lent $2 billion to Brazil to support their government-controlled oil-drilling effort and then promised the US would become one of Brazils biggest oil customers.\nSued Boeing in an effort to control where businesses could locate, kowtow to the unions, and block the creation of 1,000 jobs in South Carolina, a right-to-work (i.e. no forced unionization) state.\nAdopted a longstanding Socialist political slogan, Forward!, as his 2012 campaign motto.\nSent insulting form letters to the familes of dead SEALs.\nNeither disavowed nor distanced himself from anti-Romney campaign ads which threatened or implied violence against Republicans.\nShortly after the recent eruption of anti-American violence in North Africa, Obama went to Las Vegas to do his debate preparation in a hotel with a romanticized North Africa theme.\nSaid in an interview that the Muslim call to prayer was one of the prettiest sounds on earth at sunset.\nUnion boss and far-left activist Andy Stern has visitied Obama in the White House at least 53 times, at last count greater access than any other private citizen.\nHosted at the White House many Islamist members of groups associated with Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood, etc.\nSponsored performances by and attended fundraisers with radical rappers like Michael Franti and Common, both of whose lyrics have in some cases been anti-police, anti-white, and anti-America.\nHired Timothy Geithner, who is documented as cheating on his own personal taxes, to be Secretary of the Treasury.\nTold Joe the Plumber Wurzelbacher that it was good to spread the wealth around.\nTold small business owners nationwide in a 2012 speech that you didnt build that implying that they should not claim credit for their own success, since taxpayers (i.e. themselves and other business owners) had funded the national infrastructure.\nInsulted the British people by rudely returning to them a bust of Churchill which previously had been a ceremonial gift on display at the White House; when later confronted on this inexplicable action, he lied about it.\nCanceled plans to complete a missile defense shield in Poland, a move which was highly praised by Russia the very nation whose missile threat would have been neutralized if the shield had been completed.\nBy loudly publicizing (for personal political gain) the identity of exact SEAL teams who had killed Osama bin Laden, Obama made them a target for reprisals by Islamists; a short time later 22 SEALS were shot down and killed in Afghanistan, their worst loss of life ever.\nEstablished an extra-Constitutional top secret kill list of people (including Americans) Obama claims the right to kill on sight, and then bragged about it publicly.\nSet up a special email account, Flag@Whitehouse.gov, to which Americans were supposed to inform the government of anyone they heard spreading disinformation about Obamas health care overhaul. (This was the first of three different spy on your friends and neighbors programs.)\nAttack Watch was Obamas second Big Brother attempt, a Web site on which you would report attacks on Obamas proposals and ideology; it was quickly shut down due to outrage and mockery.\nFinally, Obama set up the Truth Team program which encouraged citizens to report to the government any friends or relatives they hear repeating lies about Obama. The Truth Team site still exists.\nTwisted the arms of defense contractors to not issue layoff notices in early November, so as to avoid causing bad news for Obama right before the election even though federal law (the WARN Act) requires such notices.\nAfter the attacks on American interests in North Africa on September 11, 2012, Obama gave a speech to the U.N. and declared The future must not belong to those who slander The Prophet of Islam transferring the blame from the attackers onto the makers of a film trailer that supposedly offended the Islamists.\nRepeatedly snubbed and got into public tiffs with Benjamin Netanyahu, who as the leader of Israel is supposed to be Obamas closest colleague in international affairs.\nOn May 19, 2011, Obama told Israel they must return to the 1967 borders as a pre-condition for continuing talks with the Palestinians even though the status of the borders was the main issue the talks were supposed to address.\nEncouraged politically biased hiring practices in the Justice Department.\nSoon after taking office, Obama rescinded the Mexico City Policy, which previously had banned NGOs which are supported by American taxpayer funds from using those funds to perform abortions in foreign countries.\nAttempted to force returning veterans to pay huge increases for their health coverage as a way to generate more funding for his Obamacare provisions.\nIn June of 2011, he anointed his own underage daughters as senior staff members so that their vacation to Africa would be paid for with taxpayer money.\nInterviews with high school classmates revealed that Obama was a heavy and frequent user of marijuana in his teenage years (not to mention his self-admitted cocaine use in college).\nPlayed over 100 rounds of golf during his first three years in office, meaning that he was on the links close to 10% of the days he has been president.\nVoted to allow post-birth abortions (i.e. facilitating the deaths of babies who survive late-term abortions) not just once but three times in a row as an Illinois state senator.\nThe pastor whom Obama selected to give the national benediction at his 2009 inauguration recently declared that all white people are going to Hell.\nSided with Hugo Chavez and the Castro regime regarding the Honduran Constitutional Crisis of 2009, the first time ever that the U.S. formed a political alliance with socialist governments in Latin America.\nObama Administration OKed the nomination of Chas Freeman to chair the National Intelligence Council (which coordinates intelligence reports from all government agencies), despite the fact that he was openly hostile to Israel and strongly favored Arabist goals. (He later withdrew under pressure.)\nChinese pianist Lang Lang played an offensively anti-American song at a 2011 White House dinner where Obama hosted Chinese president Hu Jintao, to the delight and amazement of the communist Chinese visitors, while Obama just sat there and smiled (the songs Chinese lyrics describe Americans as warmongering jackals).\nThere was a great deal of (still unverified) suspicion that the company LightSquared received favorable treatment from the Obama administration for approval of its broadband technology which interfered with the GPS system; an Air Force general claimed he was pressured by the Obama administration to downplay his criticism of LightSquareds technology in sworn testimony.\nObamas Department of Energy awarded $529 million to Fisker Automotive to build their Karma hybrid electric cars even though they are manufactured in Finland, cost over $100,000 each, and tend to explode.\nWhen Inspector General Gerald Walpin discovered during a 2009 investigation that one of Obamas political allies (the mayor of Sacramento) was misusing government funds for personal gain, Obama unceremoniously fired Walpin even though rooting out fraud was the job description of the Inspector General.\nMore than once Obama made so-called recess appointments when the Senate was not actually in recess, which directly violates Constitutional rules about how appointments must be made; in each case it was his way of getting his political allies into certain key positions without them being vetted or approved by the Senate, as required.\nAfter Nidal Malik Hasan massacred 13 people at Fort Hood while shouting Allahu Akbar so as to become a martyr for Islam, the Obama administration refused to classify his action as terrorism and instead deemed it merely workplace violence.\nDespite the fact that the Falkland Islands have been part of Great Britain since 1833 and that Great Britain is supposed to be our strongest ally, Obama essentially sided with Argentina in its new claim on the Falklands, not only by adopting the Argentine position that their status is open to negotiation, but even by (attempting to) refer to the islands by their Spanish name (Malvinas).\nConvened the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (a.k.a. the Simpson-Bowles commission) in order to address a major economic crisis and then summarily dismissed and ignored their recommendations.\nCriticized the Supreme Courts legal reasoning (about the Citizens United decision) during a State of the Union address, which many considered a dangerous precedent as it appeared to place political pressure on the court, violating the Constitutions separation of powers; but his bullying seems to have later paid off, when the Supreme Court apparently altered its Obamacare decision so as to not ruffle any political feathers.\nOn April 27, 2009, Obamas staff (possibly at his direction) ordered Air Force One to make an unnecessary very low flight over part of Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty, which many residents mistakenly assumed must be a second 9/11 attack in progress; turned out that it was just a stunt to get a photo op of Obamas plane next to the Statue of Liberty.\nObama somehow managed to insert mentions of himself into the official biographies of earlier presidents on the White House Web site even presidents from the 19th century. After public outcry, the narcissistic Obama mentions were quietly removed without comment.\nIntentionally misquotes the Declaration of Independence in speeches, often leaving out the words by their Creator in the famous passage are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, which Obama instead has recited as are endowed with certain unalienable rights.\nIn June of 2009, Obamas Solicitor General (and now Supreme Court Justice) Elena Kagan filed a legal brief to prevent the families of 9/11 victims from appealing their lawsuits against the Saudi royal family for financing the 9/11 attacks.\nThe 2009 National Christmas Tree in the White House was decorated with ornaments depicting Chairman Mao, a drag queen, and a picture of Mount Rushmore that included Obamas own head next to George Washingtons.\nCompelled Catholic and other religious organizations to provide health plans with free contraception, even though such requirements violate their rights of religious freedom and conscience.\nIt was revealed only after Obama became president that during the 1990s he was a leading member of the New Party, a socialist-aligned far-left radical group in Chicago.\nLied about his close associations with former Weather Underground terrorist Bill Ayers; pretended the two barely knew each other, when multiple sources document they were friends and close colleagues for years.\nWhen Obama was inaugurated as President on January 20, 2009, he at first flubbed the oath of office, so he had to re-take it behind closed doors for his inauguration to be valid. He did so, but during this second, true inauguration in private, he purposely failed to place his hand on a Bible, as is traditional the first president ever to not swear the oath of office on the Bible.\nObamas own author bio in his literary agents catalog and on their Web site stated for 17 consecutive years that he was born in Kenya; this claim remained intact despite other portions of the bio being altered and updated repeatedly. It was only in 2007 after he decided to run for the presidency that the born in Kenya claim was taken down. The original info must necessarily have come from Obama himself; some theorize he likely falsely claimed foreign birth in order to gain admission or scholarships in college, and never bothered to fix his lie.\nAfter winning the 2008 election but before being sworn in, Obama bombastically concocted the official-seeming Office of the President-Elect as if it was some kind of real government department; in fact, it was just a self-congratulatory title he made up to look important before he actually became president.\nObama administration came up with the bizarre euphemism man-caused disasters to describe acts of terrorism because he wants to downplay terrorism as a significant political issue.\nFor three years in a row his official budget proposals to Congress received exactly zero votes not even a single vote from Democrats.\nRelied on an Islamic fundamentalist militia group called The Martyrs of the February the 17th Revolution Brigade to provide security at the American mission in Benghazi and they not only failed to prevent the attack but perhaps even joined in on it.\nDuring the debate over Obamacare in 2009, Obama bluntly stated that doctors like to perform amputations rather than practice preventive medicine for no other reason than that they make a greater profit from amputations. The American College of Surgeons demanded an apology, which never arrived.\nSince 2008 the Los Angeles Times has been in possession of a videotape showing Obama honoring and praising anti-Western anti-Israel academic Edward Said, but they have steadfastly refused to release it to this day, for no discernible reason other than their belief it would damage Obamas reputation.\nWhen the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe recently held a conference on human rights, Obama sent an American representative Salam al-Marayati, a Truther who blamed Israel for the 9/11 attacks and who also praises Hezbollah and Hamas. To the nations of Europe, al-Marayati spoke for all Americans on the topic of human rights.\nObamas Department of Homeland Security specifically warned that Americans who are dedicated to a\nsingle issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration are potential terrorists, as are libertarian-minded voters who favor of state or local authority over centralized power. These rightwing extremists (who hold political beliefs shared by a majority of Americans) are deemed a greater threat to the nation than actual revolutionaries or jihadists.\nWhile campaigning in 2008 Obama declared that it was unpatriotic that Bush had increased the national debt at a rate of half a trillion dollars per year; but under Obama the rate of national debt increase has accelerated to almost three times the Bush rate ($6 trillion in new debt in under four years) yet Obama has never apologized nor declared himself unpatriotic.\nFor decades, every president has attended a daily intelligence briefing which updates him on critical world events each morning. Obama has skipped 60% of his daily intelligence briefings, including the ones leading up to the attack in Benghazi.\nhttp://investmentwatchblog.com/the-c...-and-blunders/",
