They are revered and in the spotlight because they are on stamps, calendars and even quoted in political speeches. But what about the other unsung Black history heroes that have opened doors, fought for freedoms and even invented techniques used in healthcare today?\nAll of the pioneers should be celebrated and mentioned, so we're shining a light on 30 Black Americans who have flown under the radar and deserve to be celebrated for their bravery, accomplishments and contributions to the Civil Rights Movement, the arts, politics, technology and much more.\nHeroes like Ella Baker, Claudette Colvin, Gordon Parks and Bayard Rustin are celebrated in this list as they've paved the way for many of today's innovators to shine in the present.\nRelated: The Significance of Black History Month and Why It Is Celebrated in February\n30 Black Americans To Celebrate During Black History Month, Juneteenth and Beyond\n1.

When the bus driver ordered her to get up, she refused, saying she had paid her fare and it was her constitutional right. She was arrested. Colvin said to NPR, \"All I remember is that I was not going to walk off the bus voluntarily,\" Colvin says. Colvin later became the main witness in the federal lawsuit Browder v. Gayle, which ended segregation on public transportation in Alabama.\nRelated: Black History Facts\n2.

The success of the paper made Abbott one of the first African American self-made millionaires.\nRelated: Black Booksellers Recommend 25 Books To Read During Black History Month\n3.

The march brought more than 200,000 peaceful protestors of varying races and religions together to hear King’s \"I Have a Dream\" speech. As a gay man who had controversial ties to communism, he was considered too much of a liability to be on the front lines of the movement, so he worked in the background.

His most popular piece, \"Revelations,\" is an ode to the Southern Black Church.
