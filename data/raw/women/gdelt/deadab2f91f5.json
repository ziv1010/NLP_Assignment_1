According to the New York Times, the IEA has demanded the release of the last Afghan prisoner held at Guantanamo Bay in exchange for freeing two American detainees in Afghanistan.\nLatest News\nFormer Pakistani diplomats urge dialogue with Afghanistan\nFormer Pakistani diplomats, speaking at a roundtable discussion in Islamabad, underscored the importance of sustained dialogue with Afghanistan to address bilateral differences.\nThe discussion, organized on Friday by the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad, highlighted that the current situation in Afghanistan has direct consequences for regional security and stability.
