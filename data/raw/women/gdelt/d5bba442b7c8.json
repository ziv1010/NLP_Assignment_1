Faced with elite opposition at the upcoming 2023 Women’s World Cup, Trang’s composure on the ball will also be key to the country retaining possession and easing pressure.\"\nAccording to FIFA website, midfielder Nguyen Thi Thanh Nha, 21, is at the forefront of an exciting young generation of Vietnamese players. Her direct running and trickery frequently puts opposition defences on the back foot. The talented youngster is set to go to the World Cup on a high after scoring in the gold-medal match during the SEA Games in May.\nThanh Nha’s versatility also makes her a valuable asset for coach Duc Chung. The midfielder is equally comfortable operating from either flank or in a central role.\nThe website praised striker Huynh Nhu as a fast, skillful, and a clinical finisher. The forward is the pioneer for Vietnamese football, providing the team’s main attacking threat, it said.\n\"Nhu is her country’s all-time record goal scorer and has netted at a rate of almost a goal per game at international level, whilst last year saw her become the first female Vietnamese player to join a professional European club\", it wrote.\nThe 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup will take place in Australia and New Zealand from July 20 to August 20.\nVietnam will play in Group E against defending champions USA on July 22, Portugal on July 27, and the Netherlands on August 1.\nDai Nam",
