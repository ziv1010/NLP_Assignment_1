The club will instead receive only £80m for the seasons in which they do not qualify for the Champions League.\n90min Man Utd WhatsApp channel\nLooking to keep up to date with everything happening at Old Trafford?

This never occurred in the time of the original deal, so United were never penalised.\nOn the flip side, United can earn up to £4.4m in bonuses with victory in the Premier League, FA Cup, Women's Super League or a UEFA competition.\nUnited face an uphill task if they are to qualify for the 2024/25 Champions League. Though the Premier League stands to gain an extra fifth spot for next year's tournament, Erik ten Hag's side are still lagging behind in sixth. They currently sit six points behind fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur, who have a game in hand on the Red Devils, while they are a further two points adrift of Aston Villa in fourth.",
