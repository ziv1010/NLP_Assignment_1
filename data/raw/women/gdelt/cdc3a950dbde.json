Check out our guides to the best TV shows available on Netflix, AppleTV, Hulu, Peacock, and HBO Max, plus the best movies on Netflix, Peacock, AppleTV, HBO Max, and Tubi.\nSpace Jam (1996)\nDirector(s): Joe Pytka\nCast: Michael Jordan, Billy West, Wayne KnightGenre: Comedy, Sports\nRating: PG\nRuntime: 1hr 27m\nRotten Tomatoes: 43% (Critics), 63% (Audience)\nMichael Jordan + Looney Tunes is certainly a bold formula for a movie, but thanks to a goofy premise and some truly excellent animation, Space Jam works. It’s got Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and the rest of the gang playing high-stakes basketball against a team of aliens with the stolen powers of some of ‘96’s greatest players. It’s got comedy adults and kids can enjoy. And it’s got a great soundtrack.\nFor the nostalgia alone, it’s a streaming slam dunk.\nLittle Miss Sunshine (2006)\nDirector: Jonathan Dayton\nCast: Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette\nGenre: Comedy/Drama\nRating: R\nRuntime: 1hr 42m\nRotten Tomatoes: 91% (Critics), 91% (Audience)\nAn indie film that scored big with audiences, Little Miss Sunshine is an ensemble film about the Hoover family and their road trip to help their daughter (Abigail Breslin) win a children’s beauty pageant. Featuring an all-star cast including Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, and Paul Dano, the film deftly balances comedy and drama.\nIt’s chock-full of heart, with a great soundtrack to boot. If you want a movie that makes you laugh even as it tugs on your heart strings, Little Miss Sunshine is the ideal choice.\nAnora (2024)\nDirector: Sean Baker\nCast: Mikey Madison, Mark Eydelshteyn, Yura Borisov\nGenre: Comedy, Drama, Romance\nRating: R\nRuntime: 2hr 19m\nRotten Tomatoes: 94% (Critics), 84% (Audience)\nIf you hadn’t heard about Anora before the Academy Awards this year, you’ve probably heard of it now. That’s because director Sean Baker (who also wrote, edited, and produced the film) is the first person since Walt Disney to take home four trophies in one night at the Oscars. Anora stars Mikey Madison (who also won an Oscar for her performance) as a sex worker who falls for the son of billionaire Russian oligarchs and gets caught up in a whirlwind, life-or-death chase through New York.\nThat premise sounds like it could be heavy, but in Baker’s hands—and thanks to a totally committed cast—the film is surprisingly pretty funny. It’s all fun and games until it’s not, but this is one Cinderella story you won’t soon forget.\nThe Shallows (2016)\nDirector(s): Jaume Collet-Serra\nCast: Blake Lively, Oscar Jaenada, Brett CullenGenre: Thriller\nRating: PG-13\nRuntime: 1hr 27m\nRotten Tomatoes: 79% (Critics), 59% (Audience)\nIt’s hard to make a shark movie without being compared to Jaws. Even so, The Shallows brings some new ideas to the table. In it, Blake Lively plays a surfer who gets stranded on a rock hundreds of feet from shore after a shark attack. Across its hour-and-a-half runtime, this lean thriller mines plenty of tension from this simple setup, anchored in large part by a great performance from Lively.\nIf you can get the Jaws theme song out of the back of your mind as you watch it, you’re bound to have a blast.\nThe Order (2024)\nDirector: Justin Kurzel\nCast: Jude Law, Nicholas Hoult, Tye Sheridan\nGenre: Drama, Mystery, Thriller\nRating: R\nRuntime: 1hr 56m\nRotten Tomatoes: 92% (Critics), 89% (Audience)\nSet in the Pacific Northwest, The Order is a crime thriller centered around a series of bank robberies that happened in broad daylight. In the movie, Jude Law plays FBI agent Terry Husk who investigates these robberies and discovers that they’re connected to the work of a white supremacist domestic terror group in the process.\nBased on a true story, The Order is a suspenseful crime drama with two excellent lead performances from Law and Nicholas Hout. While it’s firmly rooted in decades-old history, some of the parallels to modern-day happenings can’t help but surface while watching the film in 2025. Even if it might hit too close to home for some, that resonance gives the film some added immediacy, especially when combined with its tense plotting.\nA Real Pain (2024)\nDirector: Jesse Eisenberg\nCast: Kieran Culkin, Jesse Eisenberg, Jakub Gasowski\nGenre: Drama, Comedy\nRating: R\nRuntime: 1hr 29m\nRotten Tomatoes: 96% (Critics), 81% (Audience)\nThe Social Network’s Jesse Eisenberg does more than act. In A Real Pain, he co-stars alongside Kieran Culkin in a film he also wrote and directed—and he does it all really well. A Real Pain is about two cousins who trek to Poland together in order to honor their grandmother. The two’s odd couple chemistry makes this would-be road trip movie totally fun, even as Eisenberg has deeper thematic questions on his mind, too.\nAs David, Eisenberg is great in the film. And whether or not you think Kieran Culkin is playing a version of himself or not, movies like A Real Pain and shows like Succession prove that he’s a helluva lot of fun to watch.\nAlien: Romulus (2024)\nDirector(s): Fede Álvarez\nCast: Cailee Spaeny, David Jonsson, Archie Renau\nGenre: Sci-Fi/Horror\nRating: R\nRuntime: 1hr 59m\nRotten Tomatoes: 80% (Critics), 85% (Audience)\nWhether or not you’re a fan of the original Alien movies (and let’s be honest, what sci-fi fan isn’t?), Alien: Romulus has a lot to offer as both a science-fiction parable as well as a creature-based horror thriller. Starring a game cast including Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson, Romulus is set after the events in the original film, and follows a space crew who have their own encounter with the series’s terrifying Xenomorphs.\nDirector Fede Álvarez does a nice job balancing moments with high fan appeal alongside his own original takes on the chest bursting body horror that make the series so iconic in the first place. Even as the seventh entry in the series, Romulus feels fresh and frightening.\nImmaculate (2024)\nDirector: Michael Mohan\nCast: Sydney Sweeney, Álvaro Morte, Simona Tabasco\nGenre: Horror\nRating: R\nRuntime: 1hr 29m\nRotten Tomatoes: 71% (Critics), 58% (Audience)\nIn this religious horror flick, Sydney Sweeney stars as a devout American nun who travels to a convent in Italy. What first seems idyllic quickly devolves into a nightmare as Sweeney’s character learns that not all is right at this convent.\nCombining body horror and a surprising, mostly shocking ending, the film is solid horror fare. Thanks to its star, it’s all the more watchable.\nThe 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005)\nDirector(s): Judd Apatow\nCast: Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul RuddGenre: Romance, Comedy\nRating: R\nRuntime: 1hr 56m\nRotten Tomatoes: 85% (Critics), 84% (Audience)\nWith The Office turning twenty years old this year, it’s hard to remember a time when Steve Carell wasn’t a household name. The 40-Year-Old Virgin, his breakout role, shows that Carell had it all along, in a movie that tasks him with playing a hilariously naive middle-aged virgin. In the movie, his coworkers work to get him laid, but the raunchy comedy still has room for plenty of heart, too.\nAt the end of the day, it’s Judd Apatow’s balanced direction of Carell and a stellar cast that make this a comedy that still holds up in 2025.\nDrumline (2002)\nDirector(s): Charles Stone III\nCast: Nick Cannon, Zoe Saldaña, Orlando Jones Genre: Comedy, Drama, Music\nRating: PG-13\nRuntime: 1hr 58m\nRotten Tomatoes: 81% (Critics), 70% (Audience)\nIn Drumline, what starts as a comedic premise about a Harlem street drummer and competition marching bands actually becomes a coming-of-age film that’s both fun and fresh. A music movie that feels like a sports film, director Charles Stone III makes the high-stakes world of collegiate band competitions exhilarating to experience.\nFilled with great drumming and equally-great performances (including a standout turn from a young Zoe Saldaña), Drumline is as inspirational as it is energetic.\nDie Hard (1988)\nDirector: John McTiernan\nCast: Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia\nGenre: Action\nRating: R\nRuntime: 2hr 11m\nRotten Tomatoes: 94% (Critics), 94% (Audience)\nIn this iconic 80s action movie, Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a New York cop who must save his estranged wife from a terrorist takeover during their holiday party. With Alan Rickman perfectly cast as villain Hans Gruber, the skyscraper everyone is trapped in becomes a veritable playground for McClane as he climbs elevator shafts and shimmies through air ducts on a mission to save the hostages and put a stop to the takeover.\nForget the debates about whether or not this constitutes a Christmas movie. What matters is that the movie still delivers more than 30 years after its release. (And, for the record, it’s definitely a Christmas movie).\nO'Dessa (2025)\nDirector: Geremy Jasper\nCast: Sadie Sink, Kelvin Harrison, Jr., Murray Bartlett\nGenre: Musical\nRating: PG-13\nRuntime: 1hr 46m\nRotten Tomatoes: 41% (Critics), 63% (Audience)\nOriginal movie musicals have been staging a slow but certain comeback, and this rock musical fronted by Stranger Things’s Sadie Sink showcases why. In it, Sink plays a farm girl who meets the love of her life in a faraway city where she must ultimately test fate if she wants to save his life. While the premise sounds like it could be cliche, Sink’s performance and the music that propel the story forward make up for any familiar undertones the plot may have.\nNot only can Sadie Sink sing, but this is one post-apocalyptic rock opera that’s as bizarre to behold as it is a blast. If someone pitched you a Mad Max musical, you’d probably laugh, but somehow O’Dessa proves that the idea has legs.\nNo One Will Save You (2023)\nDirector: Brian Duffield\nCast: Kaitlyn Dever, Elizabeth Kaluev, Zack Duhame\nGenre: Horror/Mystery/Thriller\nRating: PG-13\nRuntime: 1hr 33m\nRotten Tomatoes: 83% (Critics), 56% (Audience)\nIn this horror-sci-fi-thriller, Kaitlyn Dever plays anxious homebody Brynn, who must survive an extraterrestrial home invasion. No One Will Save You showcases writer/director Brian Duffield’s penchant for high-concept thrills to great effect, and it’s a shame that this movie didn’t have a wider release as it would have been a blast to watch in a crowded theater.\nOne thing the film proves (even on a laptop or home TV) is how Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart, Short Term 12) can command any screen she’s on — even without much dialogue.\nThe Woman King (2022)\nDirector: Gina Prince-Bythewood\nCast: Viola Davis, Thuso Mbedu, Lashana Lynch\nGenre: Action/Drama/History\nRating: PG-13\nRuntime: 2hr 15m\nRotten Tomatoes: 94% (Critics), 99% (Audience)\nThe Woman King is inspired by the true story of the Agojie, an all-female group of warriors who were responsible for protecting Dahomey, the 1800s African Kingdom. In this historical action movie, Viola Davis plays General Nanisca, who is training the next wave of warriors.\nIf you’re looking for a great action movie with some truly badass sequences, The Woman King is a great option — and it’s super fun to see Viola Davis in a role like this. Just wait til she stops a bullet with her sword.\nMemes & Nightmares (2025)\nDirector: Matt Mitchener, Charles Todd\nCast: Josiah Johnson, Jamel Johnson, Jalen Rose, The Kid Mero\nGenre: Satire\nRating: TV-MA\nRuntime: 1h 21m\nRotten Tomatoes: n/a\nThis satirical film explores the world of NBA Twitter through the eyes of social-media personality Josiah Johnson (King Josiah) and his co-star Jamel Johnson. The buddy-cop mystery uncovers the culture of memes, viral moments, and digital fandom that have turned basketball into a 24/7 phenomenon. Filled with humor, unforgettable stories, and internet chaos, the film offers a unique look at how social media has reshaped the NBA experience—perfect for fans, meme lovers, and anyone immersed in online culture.\nPacific Rim (2013)\nDirector: Guillermo del Toro\nCast: Charlie Hunnam, Rinko Kikuchi, Idris Elba\nGenre: Sci-Fi/Action\nRating: PG-13\nRuntime: 2hr 11m\nRotten Tomatoes: 72% (Critics), 77% (Audience)\nDo you like anime? Do you want to watch giant robots beat up on kaiju (giant monsters)? In Guillermo del Toro’s Pacific Rim, you get all that and more. It’s as fun as it sounds, especially in the hands of a stylistic pro like Guillermo del Toro.\nSure, there’s a plot to Pacific Rim about some unlikely heroes who have to be brought into the fray to battle the monsters emerging from the ocean, but at the end of the day, you’re there for the robots, and Pacific Rim delivers. The entire movie is big, bold, and badass.\nThe Amateur (2025)\nDirector: James Hawes\nCast: Rami Malek, Rachel Brosnahan, Laurence Fishburne\nGenre: Action, Thriller\nRating: PG-13\nRuntime: 2hr 2m\nRotten Tomatoes: 61% (Critics), 88% (Audience)\nIn this action thriller, Rami Malek plays, Charlie Heller, a CIA decoder who’s thrust into a quest for revenge when his wife is killed be terrorists. It’s all very John Wick, except that in The Amateur Heller’s smarts play just as much of a role in taking down his enemies. If you know Malek from movies like Bohemian Rhapsody or Oppenheimer, he might seem like an unlikely action star. However, The Amateur shows that in the right circumstances, he can go full-on Jason Bourne.\nQuiz Lady (2023)\nDirector: Jessica Yu\nCast: Awkwafina, Sandra Oh, Jason Schwartzman\nGenre: Comedy\nRating: R\nRuntime: 1hr 39m\nRotten Tomatoes: 82% (Critics), 79% (Audience)\nWhen a gameshow obsessee named Anne (Awkwafina) has to team up with her mess of a sister (Sandra Oh) to help with their mother’s gambling debt, hilarity ensues. Quiz Lady succeeds in large part thanks to the chemistry of its leads. Awkwafina is excellent — as is the rest of the cast, which includes Sandra Oh and Jason Schwartzman, as well as a great performance from Will Ferrell.\nThe writing is fun, there are some nice slapstick moments, and there’s even a great message about sisterhood at the movie’s heart.\nSausage Party (2016)\nDirector: Greg Tiernan, Conrad Vernon\nCast: Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill\nGenre: Comedy, Animated\nRating: R\nRuntime: 1hr 29m\nRotten Tomatoes: 82% (Critics), 50% (Audience)\nIn this raunchy animated comedy, the happy life of Frank the sausage (Rogen) and his supermarket pals is upended when he realizes that, after being purchased, he will be eaten. Featuring a game cast of voice actors including Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, and Nick Kroll, this is an adult animated comedy that wants you to know it’s adult for pretty much every second of its hour-and-a-half runtime.\nThe film actually has some interesting depth underneath its sophomoric gags and profanity. That being said, amidst all of the anthropomorphic sexualizations of food, you may never look at your food the same way again.\nNapoleon Dynamite (2004)\nDirector: Jared Hess\nCast: Jon Hede, Efren Ramirez, Tina Majorino\nGenre: Comedy\nRating: PG\nRuntime: 1hr 36m\nRotten Tomatoes: 72% (Critics), 74% (Audience)\nNapoleon Dynamite is the sort of movie you either love or hate. Weird, droll, and immediately quotable, it tells the story of an alienated teen named Napoleon who endeavors to help his friend win the class presidency. With its opening credits styled on plates of food, llamas, tater tots, and cringe, rural characters, the film is a bizarrely endearing story that you can’t help but be charmed by.\nThis offbeat comedy became a cult classic for a reason, and experiencing it again will remind you just how much it affected popular culture at the time. Vote for Pedro and stream it today!\nLonglegs (2024)\nDirector: Osgood Perkins\nCast: Dan Kagan, Brian Kavanaugh-Jones, Nicolas Cage\nGenre: Horror, Thriller\nRating: R\nRuntime: 1hr 41m\nRotten Tomatoes: 85% (Critics), 61% (Audience)\nEvery year, we have some genuinely terrifying horror films, and 2024 offered plenty of them. From Smile 2 to The Substance, it was a great year by any measure, and, even then, Longlegs is still up there with some of the best of the decade. In this horror/thriller from director Osgood Perkins, an FBI director in the 1990s tracks down a serial killer with a penchant for the occult. If you loved The Silence of the Lambs, you’ll find plenty of thrills and chills in this movie. And then there’s Nicolas Cage in one of his most go-for-broke performances yet.\nI, Robot (2004)\nDirector: Alex Proyas\nCast: Will Smith, Bridget Moynahan, Alan Tudyk\nGenre: Sci-Fi/Action\nRating: PG-13\nRuntime: 1hr 55m\nRotten Tomatoes: 57% (Critics), 70% (Audience)\nA summer blockbuster with substance, I, Robot is a fun rewatch at a time where AI is now a major part of public discourse in the technosphere. Starring Will Smith as a detective in the year 2035 investigating an alleged suicide in a robot-filled future, this is a film that despite it’s action movie trappings still has a message to deliver its audience.\nLoosely inspired by the short stories by Isaac Asimov, the film is a lot of fun, with Alan Tudyk giving an impressive performance as a humanoid robot named Sonny. Almost two decades after its initial release, much of the film’s world-building and design still hold up.\nSlotherhouse (2023)\nDirector: Matthew Goodhue\nCast: Lisa Ambalavanar, Sydney Craven, Andrew Horton\nGenre: Comedy/Horror\nRating: PG-13\nRuntime: 1hr 33m\nRotten Tomatoes: 61% (Critics), 70% (Audience)\nThere are two types of people in this world: people who love the sound of a murderous sloth getting its own movie, and those who don’t. If you’re one of the former, I’ve got good news for you: Slotherhouse is streaming on Hulu.\nIn Matthew Goodhue’s campy horror comedy, senior Emily Young adopts a pet sloth in order to win the vote of her sorority and become sorority president. The only problem? The sloth starts killing people. Sometimes in movies, what you see is what you get. In the case of Slotherhouse, it’s anything but slow.\nSleeping Dogs (2024)\nDirector: Adam Cooper\nCast: Russell Crowe, Karen Gillan, Marton Csokas\nGenre: Thriller/Crime/Drama\nRating: R\nRuntime: 1hr 51m\nRotten Tomatoes: 42% (Critics), 82% (Audience)\nIn this thriller, Russell Crowe plays a detective with memory problems racing to remember a decades-old case with high-stakes repercussions as the man convicted of the crime is on death row. If it sounds like Memento, it’s because it is a bit like Memento — but it’s nevertheless an entertaining mystery worth two hours of your time.\nFeaturing solid visuals and a great performance by Russell Crowe, there’s a lot to like about Sleeping Dogs, even if it lives in the shadow of one of Christopher Nolan’s greatest works.\nA Nice Indian Boy (2025)\nDirector: Roshan Sethi\nCast: Karan Soni, Jonathan Groff, Sunita Mani\nGenre: Romance, Comedy\nRating: NR\nRuntime: 1hr 39m\nRotten Tomatoes: 96% (Critics), 97% (Audience)\nIf you’re looking for a queer rom-com that’s as authentic as it is charming, do yourself a favor and check out A Nice Indian Boy. Anchored by some truly wonderful performances by Karan Soni and Jonathan Groff, this sweet film tells the story of a soft-spoken doctor whose Indian family has accepted his sexuality without ever having to confront it in practice. That all changes when he meets Jay, a white man with Indian adoptive parents. What follows is a film that’s both a winning romantic comedy and a story about intergenerational acceptance.\nAs an antidote to decades of heteronormative romantic comedies, it’s a welcome breath of fresh air.\nA Man Called Otto (2022)\nDirector: Marc Forster\nCast: Tom Hanks, Mariana Treviño, Mack Bayda\nGenre: Drama/Comedy\nRating: PG-13\nRuntime: 2hr 6m\nRotten Tomatoes: 70% (Critics), 97% (Audience)\nTom Hanks might be considered America’s dad, but just because you’re America’s dad doesn’t mean that you’re always sunshine and rainbows. In A Man Called Otto, Hanks stars as widdower Otto Anderson — America’s grumpiest man — who forges an unlikely friendship with Marisol, a pregant woman played by Mariana Treviño.\nThe film’s characterizations are its greatest strengths, as both actors really bring a lot of empathy to their respective characters. Fair warning, though: the ending may just make you bawl your eyes out.\nBefore the Devil Knows You’re Dead (2007)\nDirector: Sidney Lumet\nCast: Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei\nGenre: Crime/Drama/Thriller\nRating: R\nRuntime: 1hr 56m\nRotten Tomatoes: 89% (Critics), 72% (Audience)\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke are two of the best actors of the last few decades, and in Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead, that fact is on full display across the film’s 2-hour runtime. In this crime thriller, Hoffman and Hawke play brothers who plan to rob their family’s jewelry store in a simple heist that goes horribly wrong.\nDirected by Sidney Lumet, the film is a total thrill to experience. The narrative unravels out of order, keeping you on the edge of your seat even up to its bleak, tragic ending. By the time the credits roll, you’ll be reminded that Lumet, too, is one of film’s often unsung GOATs.\nMean Girls (2004)\nDirector(s): Mark Waters\nCast: Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Tina FeyGenre: Comedy\nRating: PG-13\nRuntime: 1hr 37m\nRotten Tomatoes: 84% (Critics), 66% (Audience)\nWhen Cady Heron (played by Lindsay Lohan) and her scientist parents move to Illinois from Africa, she finds herself face-to-face with all the highs and lows that make public school different from homeschooling. Written by Tina Fey, Mean Girls is one teen comedy that, despite being released in the mid 2000s, still holds up surprisingly well. From its infamous Burn Book to iconic lines like “Stop trying to make fetch happen” and “Get in, loser, we’re going shopping!” the film is just as funny today as it was when it was first released.\nWhile 2024’s musical adaptation is fun, too, do yourself a favor and stick to the classic.\nOddity (2024)\nDirector: Damian McCarthy\nCast: Gwilym Lee, Carolyn Bracken, Tadhg Murphy\nGenre: Horror, Thriller, Mystery\nRating: R\nRuntime: 1hr 38m\nRotten Tomatoes: 96% (Critics), 78% (Audience)\nWe truly are in a golden age of horror, and Hulu has some of the best titles out there for fans of the genre. Oddity takes familiar horror tropes (ghosts, murder, cursed objects) and does something totally new and exciting with these elements, making it one of the most fun horror flicks in years.\nIt’s not worth spoiling too much of the plot in recommending the film, so we’ll just leave you with these questions… Do you like murder mysteries? Do you like ghost stories? Do you like jump scares (real jump scares)? If the answer to any of these is “Yes,” Oddity is the film for you.\nBlackberry (2023)\nDirector: Matt Johnson\nCast: Jay Baruchel, Glenn Howerton, Matt Johnson\nGenre: Drama, Comedy, Biopic\nRating: R\nRuntime: 1hr 59m\nRotten Tomatoes: 97% (Critics), 94% (Audience)\nRemember BlackBerry? There was a time when they were the de facto phone of choice. Want to know what went wrong? Check out 2023’s BlackBerry, which charts the rise and fall of the BlackBerry device in the face of the iPhone and a shifting technological landscape. Featuring great performances by Jay Baruchel, Glenn Howerton, and Matt Johnson, BlackBerry is an acerbic, tense, and fascinating comedy-drama.\nNot since The Social Network has there been a film about technology this compelling. Sorry, Jobs and Steve Jobs.\nBoss Level (2021)\nDirector: Joe Carnahan\nCast: Frank Grillo, Naomi Watts, Mel Gibson\nGenre: Action/Sci-Fi/Thriller\nRating: R\nRuntime: 1hr 40m\nRotten Tomatoes: 74% (Critics), 77% (Audience)\nWith its time loops and special agents, Boss Level belongs to a fun lineage of films ranging from Edge of Tomorrow to Source Code. In it, Frank Grillo plays Roy Pulver, a character trapped to relive his death again and again Groundhog Day-style unless he can find and stop the ones responsible for his murder.\nThe end result is a movie that isn’t the most original idea for a film (as the previous, reference-heavy paragraph gives away), but that doesn’t take away from its charm. Grillo gives a solid performance that allows viewers to empathize with his character, and director Joe Carnahan goes hard on the video game-inspired action sequences. In other words, it’s hella fun.\nThe Last Showgirl (2024)\nDirector: Gia Coppola\nCast: Pamela Anderson, Dave Bautista, John Clofine, Brenda Song\nGenre: Drama\nRating: R\nRuntime: 1hr 29m\nRotten Tomatoes: 83% (Critics), 72% (Audience)\nThere have been a few movies recently that have dug into the harsh realities of aging in the entertainment business, with The Substance making big waves thanks to its gross-out body horror. On the other end of the spectrum is The Last Showgirl, a drama about the thirty-year end of a long-running show. Starring Pamela Anderson, this Vegas-set film is a wistful as it is hard-hitting.\nWhile the entire cast does great work in this moving film, Anderson is the one who really delivers. It’s a role that shows the actor still has it more than twenty years after Baywatch — and is much more than the pop-culture punch line she’d become.\nPresence (2024)\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh\nCast: Lucy Liu, Julia Fox, Chris Sullivan\nGenre: Horror, Mystery\nRating: R\nRuntime: 1hr 25m\nRotten Tomatoes: 87% (Critics), 52% (Audience)\nOne thing that’s so exciting about the horror genre is how ripe for innovation it is. And in many ways, Presence feels as revelatory as watershed horror films like Paranormal Activity or The Blair Witch Project. In this film, led by Lucy Liu, a family moves into a home and becomes concerned that the building may be haunted.\nThat’s a super simple premise, but thanks to the voyeuristic way that the camera behaves, it’s as if the viewer is the ghost at the heart of the film. This makes for a slow burn that is as artful and smart as it is wholly creepy.\nLooking for more streaming recommendations?
