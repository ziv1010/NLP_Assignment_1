  "body_text": "InterviewShanice van de Sanden on team spirit, Tottenham and why life is good\nShanice van de Sanden has shared the collective desire within the Liverpool FC Women squad to get back to winnings ways against Tottenham Hotspur at Prenton Park.\nDespite back-to-back defeats by title contenders Manchester City and Arsenal, the spirit in Matt Beard’s side remains high.\nThe Reds have enjoyed a positive season so far and are currently in fifth spot in the Barclays Women’s Super League, just three points away from the top four.\nAhead of Sunday’s 2pm GMT kick-off versus Spurs, read on as Van de Sanden speaks to Liverpoolfc.com about this weekend’s game, team spirit and why she is feeling good and free from injury…\nOn why back-to-back defeats in the WSL will not define the season…\nWe need to be positive. There are lots of positives to take from the Arsenal game. Yes, we lost 2-0, but the first half wasn’t too bad, to be honest, and we were very compact. Obviously we didn’t have many chances in the game but it will come in these next couple of games. I think it’s going to be a good game against Tottenham and we can’t wait to play that game.\nOn fine lines in games and a fantastic strike from Vivianne Miedema changing the last match in Arsenal’s favour…\nThey have very good players but you need to be switched on every single second I think. If you switch off for maybe a few seconds then the ball is in the back of your net. We have analysed it in our team meetings and we have talked about it but now we need to focus on Tottenham, which is our next game. In football you move forward very quickly so that’s a positive thing.\nOn being back on home turf again this weekend and the win over Tottenham last season with Emma Koivisto’s spectacular goal…\nI won’t forget that one! It’s always lovely to play in front of our own fans. There is something about playing in front of our own fans at our home stadium so I am very, very positive heading into Sunday’s game.\nOn the big difference the support of the fans can make to the team at Prenton Park…\nA big, big difference. I’ve seen it in my whole career, your own supporters give you that extra energy and power and I know our fans will give us that on Sunday.\nOn being on the same number of points as Tottenham...\nI think Tottenham are doing very well as well. They signed some new players so we need to be focused and it’s a big game for both of us so we are really looking forward to it.\nOn the confidence in the camp remaining high with a good week of training at the AXA Melwood Training Centre…\nI love to be positive to my teammates and I love to help them. It’s just something extra I can give to my teammates. We all have to be positive, look at the great weather today, look at the season overall how it’s going for us.\nI know we have had a few frustrating results in our last two games against two big teams but we need to keep our heads up, we are still improving as a team and I think there is loads of improvement to come from us. We will see that in the future but now our focus is Sunday.\nYou have to accept cookies in order to view this content on our site.\nWatch on YouTubeOn the potential of this young team…\nWe are improving 100 per cent. You see the difference from last season to now, we are so much better, so we need to keep moving forward and keep progressing and keep training well as well.\nOn how she is feeling on a personal level on the pitch…\nI’m feeling really good. Hopefully I can score some goals and get some assists for the team but I’m feeling good. I’m happy to be fit and help this team and hopefully I can bring some more because I want to score goals and get some assists for this team.\nOn life being good off the pitch as well with the recent birth of her child…\nLife is good. When I get home I’m happy and when I’m on the pitch I’m happy so life is very good.",
