The show was renewed for season 5 before the debut of season 4's fourth episode (h/t Variety)\nSo, whether you're a new Wrexham fan or a diehard supporter, here's everything you need to know about \"Welcome to Wrexham\" season 4, including where to watch it, trailers, and what celebrity cameos could be coming this season.\n'Welcome to Wrexham' season 4 release date\nWelcome to Wrexham season 4 premiered on FX on May 15. It debuted on Hulu and Disney Plus the following day.\nA post shared by Wrexham AFC (@wrexham_afc)\nA photo posted by on\nWhere to watch 'Welcome to Wrexham' season 4\nWelcome to Wrexham season 4 is airing on FX in the U.S. If you want to watch live, you'll want to snag one of our top cable alternatives.\nFor those who prefer to use one of the best streaming services, you'll be streaming episodes the next day on Hulu in the U.S. If you live in the U.K. or most everywhere else, it'll be on Disney Plus the day after it airs on FX.\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\nCanadians will likely need to use Apple TV Plus, which will set you back $12.99 CAD a month. This was the documentary's streaming service of choice in Canada for season 3, but we have yet to confirm it for season 4.\nWatch \"Welcome to Wrexham\" season 4 on Sling\nSling gives you a lot of TV channels at an affordable price. Sling Blue starts at $46/month and streams your local ABC, FOX and NBC channels (availability varies by market) as well as FX, which means it's what you want to watch \"Welcome to Wrexham.\" For sports fans, Sling Orange has ESPN and also starts at just $46. You can combine both plans for as little as $61 and right now, you can even get your first month 50% off.\nOutside the U.S., you won't be able to watch the episodes on FX unless you have a virtual private network (VPN) that you can use to access your cable or cable alternative that has FX as an available channel.\nWe've tested many different VPN services and our favorite is NordVPN; it offers superb speeds, excellent customer service and a no-questions-asked 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try it out first to see if it's right for you. But you've got other VPN options too, so check out our full list of the best VPN services.\n'Welcome to Wrexham' season 4 trailer\nWe finally have our first trailer for \"Welcome to Wrexham\" season 4!\nWe obviously don't get a ton spoiled in this trailer, but we do get two key themes for the season to come.\nFirst, it's all about the quest for a third promotion in three years, which is an almost impossible task.\nSecond, it's also all about beating Tom Brady, who seeing what Rob and Ryan have done at Wrexham, decided to buy (part) of a football team as well: Birmingham FC.\n'Welcome to Wrexham' season 4 cast\nAs a documentary, the cast for \"Welcome to Wrexham\" depends on real-life events, who consents to be interviewed, etc.\nBut after three seasons, you can assume that Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney will return for season 4. Humphrey Ker, Wrexham A.F.C. executive director, will also almost certainly make an appearance, as will Shaun Harvey, the fourth member of the Wrexham board of directors.\nIn terms of the first team, expect Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson to make several NSFW appearances, as well as fan favorites Paul Mullin and Ollie Palmer.\nOther first-team stars such as Elliot Lee, James McClean and others will also likely make an appearance, though which players get the most air time is something that will only be determined once season 4 is filmed.\nAs always, you can be sure the show will continue to feature people from the town of Wrexham, members of the team and the team's local (and global!) community of supporters.\nHere are the people I can essentially guarantee you will appear in \"Welcome to Wrexham\" season 4:\n- Rob McElhenney, Wrexham A.F.C. co-owner and famous TV star\n- Ryan Reynolds, Wrexham A.F.C. co-owner and famous Deadpool\n- Humphrey Ker, Wrexham A.F.C. executive director and Rob McElhenney’s colleague\n- Shaun Harvey, Wrexham A.F.C. advisor to the board\n- Phil Parkinson, Wrexham A.F.C. manager\n- Paul Mullin, Wrexham A.F.C. player\n- Ollie Palmer, Wrexham A.F.C. player\n- Steven Fletcher, Wrexham A.F.C. player\n- Mark Howard, Wrexham A.F.C. player\n- Elliot Lee, Wrexham A.F.C. player\n- Lewis Brunt, Wrexham A.F.C. player\nHowever, football is a game that always brings change to the locker room, and some new faces could appear in the show.\nFormer Manchester United midfielder Matty James has joined the team, as has former Reading forward Sam Smith, who joined the club on a record transfer according to ESPN. They're also joined by former England striker Jay Rodríguez.\nThat's left some key players/cast members potentially on the outs. Mullin and Palmer have both largely been relegated to the sidelines as the League One season has gone on. It will be interesting to see how the documentary handles this transition.\n'Welcome to Wrexham' seasons 1-3 recap\nIf you're looking to stay completely spoiler-free for \"Welcome to Wrexham\" season 4, turn around now. After here, anything that happened in the first three seasons is on the table. I'll keep things brief though. The show's first three seasons are great, and you're going to enjoy watching them more than reading any description I'll provide.\nSpoilers for 'Welcome to Wrexham' seasons 1-3 ahead\nSeason 1, starts with Ryan and Rob buying Wrexham, a relatively storied football club in Wales. The town and the club have fallen on hard times, so the Hollywood duo has the hard work of restoring the club and town, along with the club's aged stadium. That means they need to get promoted from the National League to the EFL League Two.\nUnfortunately, the club comes up just short on multiple fronts. They first lost the FA Trophy final 1-0 to Bromley at a packed Wembley Stadium, then lost the promotion playoff semifinal to Grimsby Town 4-5 in extra time.\nIn season 2, Wrexham remain in the National League but get off to an incredible start. But their hot start is matched by rival Notts County, putting promotion hopes in jeopardy.\nHowever, Wrexham finally get their Hollywood ending in season 2. First, they beat Notts County in a thrilling 3-2 win at the Racecourse Ground (Wrexham's home stadium) and then won the National League championship in the penultimate game of the season with a 3-1 win at home against Boreham Wood. The season ends with Wrexham celebrating promotion back into the English Football League — a massive achievement.\nSeason 3 had even higher stakes than the previous two seasons if that even feels possible. With Wrexham now in the EFL League Two and the documentary a huge success, shining a light on the small Welsh town for the world to see, Ryan and Rob need to keep pushing up the football league pyramid if they want to bring in money to improve the stadium and give the town a team to be proud of.\nThings get off to a rocky start, but Wrexham finally find their form, winning five games in a row to end the season. That's good enough for automatic promotion into the EFL League One, despite finishing second in League Two behind Stockport County.\nAside from these major competitions, Wrexham A.F.C. also participate in other domestic tournaments, most notably the F.A. Cup. In seasons 2 and 3, the FA Cup gets particular focus, though in both seasons the team's FA Cup run ends in heartbreak. There's also a Wrexham women's team that gets particular focus in seasons 2 and 3 as the team wins the Adran North League and earns promotion to the Adran Premier League.\nWhile football is a major focus of the series, it's not the only focus. Each season brings insight into members of the Wrexham community, and it's often these more emotional episodes that end up being the most memorable in a given season. There's also regular drama around actually funding the team, building the stadium and all the otherwise behind-the-scenes aspects of running a football club.\n'Welcome to Wrexham' season 4 possible storylines and celebrity cameos\nEven if you've seen the first three seasons of \"Welcome to Wrexham,\" you may want to stop reading here.\nI'm about to talk about what could happen in season 4, and since this is a documentary, everything I'm about to discuss has actually happened.\nSo while it's still speculation because these events may not make it into an episode, this is definitely spoiler territory. If you want to know just what happened in the two-episode premiere, check out my review of the first two episodes of \"Welcome to Wrexham season 4.\nPossible spoilers for \"Welcome to Wrexham\" season 4 ahead\nThe following speculation is as of 5/15/2025, before the premiere of season 4. It has not been updated to reflect what actually made it into the documentary.\nSo far, the only thing we know for sure that will make it into season 4, is a lovely golf outing iin Cheshire with Wrexham players Steven Feltcher, Mark Howard, Elliot Lee and Lewis Brunt.\nFletcher took to his golf-focused Instagram account on April 15 to share a behind-the-scenes look at the foursome on the golf course.\n\"Doing some filming for the @wrexham_afc documentary on @disneyplus,\" Fletcher posted, essentially confirming that at least these Wrexham players will make it into season 4.\nA post shared by Steven Fletcher Golf (@s.f_golf)\nA photo posted by on\nNow, let's move on to the stuff that might make it into season 4.\nAs of this writing, the 2024-2025 EFL League One season is almost at the end, and Wrexham will again be celebrating.\nWith one game left in the season, the Red Dragons secured promotion to the EFL Championship with a 3-0 win over Charlton Athletic. They are now the first team ever to secure promotion to the Championsip with three consecutive promotions.\nWhile it was an incredible season, sadly, they won't take home the League One title. That honor belongs to Tom Brady-owned Birmingham City, whose dominant form allowed them to secure silverware with several games left in the season.\nDespite Wrexham losing to Birmingham in their first meeting this season, that match is almost guaranteed to make an appearance in season 4 (it's been confirmed via the season 4 trailer). Especially since the Wrexham faithful had some choice words for the seven-time Super Bowl-winning former quarterback.\nThese two sides drew in their rematch in January 2025, but nearly had a shot at a Wembley reunion in the EFL Trophy Final. Unfortunately, Wrexham lost to Peterborough on penalties, ending any shot at a third showdown this year.\nTrying to get promoted yet again isn't without costs, though. Reynolds and McElhenney posted a cheeky advertisement on X (Twitter), putting all Wrexham jerseys on sale for a limited time. This brief ad may make a cameo in the documentary.\nSave money on Wrexham kits, and save @VancityReynolds from @RMcElhenney's 3am phone calls🔴⚪ #WxmAFC pic.twitter.com/QNTQUS0Ld5March 1, 2025\nMoving on to other games that could get some screentime, this summer featured a club-friendly from July between Wrexham and Reynold's hometown Vancouver Whitecaps. Reynolds even attended this match in Wrexham's North American summer tour, so it'd be shocking if it didn't get at least a bit of coverage.\nWrexham's March 15, 2025, match against Wycombe Wanderers will also likely get some coverage. It was a big win in the race for promotion to the EFL Championship, but also had a shocking moment where a spectator went down with a medical incident, causing a 50-minute stoppage in play.\nWrexham's April 18 game against Bristol City may also get some airtime, as Rob McElhenney was in attendance (h/t The Mirror).\nThat game ended in an agonizing draw, but thankfully, Wrexham made up for it when they beat Blackpool a few days later, with McElhenney joining the Wrexham faithful in the away end.\nOne game later, McElhenney and Reynolds were in attendance at the Racecourse Ground to see Wrexham secure promotion to the EFL Championship with a 3-0 home win against Charlton. That will definitely make it into season 4.\nIt will be interesting to see if there is any discussion of European football in season 4. Recent reports suggest Wrexham and three other Welsh clubs that play in the English football pyramid are looking to join the Welsh League Cup to try and earn a spot in the UEFA Europa Conference League as a domestic cup winner.\nThat move is not without controversy.\nOn the one hand, having these Welsh clubs in Europe could raise the profile of Welsh football. On the other hand, these clubs have chosen to play in England and are generally superior to their Welsh Cymru Premier League counterparts. They don't make it into European competitions as an English team because they frankly typically aren't good enough to win the English domestic cups or finish in the top quarter of the table of the English Premier League.\nBut against Welsh competition, they'd likely take a spot that had otherwise gone to clubs that need the domestic cup qualifying spot to even have a chance at football on European nights.\nFor his part, Cymru Premier all-time lead goal scorer Marc Lloyd Willians thinks these clubs need to stay in English football when it comes to qualifying for Europe. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, he said that the clubs decided to play in England and should have to qualify for Europe via England's allotted spots. “For me, you can’t be having your cake and eating it. They have made their decision and I would be against them coming in.”\nAs of this writing, The Guardian has reported that the English Football Association has blocked a proposal for Wrexham, Cardiff, Swansea and Newport to join the Welsh League Cup.\nYou may have noticed one member of the Deadpool Corps was far deadlier than the rest. WELSHPOOL. @PMullin7 @Wrexham_AFC #DeadpoolAndWolverine ❤️💛 pic.twitter.com/NY06jmEgwAJuly 29, 2024\nWhether or not they play in Europe, the Wrexham players are winning off and on the pitch. For starters, the show won several awards in that time, taking home three 2024 Emmys from six nominations.\nTeam superstar Paul Mullin is known for scoring goals, but this summer he scored a cameo in \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" as Welshpool, one of Deadpool's many variants. He later donned the Deadpool mask again this year, throwing it on to celebrate a goal against Salford City in the Football League Trophy group stage.\nSadly, Rob McElhenney's cameo from the Ryan Reynolds film was cut, something that will definitely be a point of contention in season 4 at some point.\nRyan Reynolds wants to come home with you! #AdoptARyan in honor of @vancityreynolds bday! #bringlovehome pic.twitter.com/RgMo5sibWkOctober 23, 2024\nRob may have already gotten his revenge this year though. As a birthday present for Ryan, he started an \"Adopt A Ryan\" program for people to adopt a variety of pets ... all named Ryan Reynolds (h/t The Leader).\nRegardless, it was only Paul Mullin who scored the big-time cameo, and he isn't the only Wrexham player celebrating a win.\nLast year, Wrexham brought in Arsenal backup goalkeeper Arthur Okonkwo on loan to shore up their defense. He was excellent, and a big reason the club were promoted to League One. Now, having ended his Arsenal contract, Okonkwo is back in Wrexham for good, having reportedly even turned down offers from more prominent clubs (h/t Goal).\nHe's not the only big-name player brought in either. On October 26, it was revealed that Wrexham had signed a duo of former Premier League players: Matty James and Jon Dadi Bodvarsson (h/t Goal).\nUnfortunately, one \"Welcome to Wrexham\" veteran's season will come to a sad ending. Midfielder Andy Cannon ruptured his ACL in a match against Mansfield Town on February 23. That injury is a gutting one, as it puts an end to his season.\nWhile we want to raise as much as possible for @WrexhamMiners, we also want to see @thehumphreyker run. pic.twitter.com/Syrzjfy9njSeptember 12, 2024\n\"Welcome to Wrexham\" season 4 might also serve as a backdoor pilot for a couple of new documentaries. In a Twitter (X) post, the team shared that Reynolds and McElhenney roped in Humphrey Ker to run a marathon for charity. They've already promised to film Ker running the marathon, so it's now just a matter of how much screentime the writer-turned-football executive gets as he runs 26.2 miles.\nReynolds and McElhenney are also working on another soccer documentary, \"Necaxa,\" set to arrive in Summer 2025 (h/t Variety). The pair bought a minority stake in the Mexican soccer club and are already working on a bilingual documentary with fellow Hollywood star Eva Longoria. Expect it to be mentioned at least once, given that Longoria attended Wrexham's home opener against Wycombe Wanderers in August.\nBut that's not the only football club these two bought since season 3. In January 2025 they were part of a group that purchased a controlling stake of the Colombian soccer team La Equidad (h/t The Athletic). At this time, it doesn't seem like there's a documentary in the works about that football team ... yet.\nThey aren't the only ones interested in buying into international football either. Season 4 could highlight Wrexham's new partnership with virtual reality giant Meta (h/t The Mirror U.S.). Or it could highlight Wrexham's new minority owners, the wealthy Allyn family from upstate New York (The Hollywood Reporter). It will almost certainly highlight that Reynolds and McElhenney now own Wrexham Lager.\nEverybody at Wrexham AFC is extremely saddened to learn of the passing of life-long supporter Arthur Massey, aged 100. All our thoughts are with Arthur’s family and friends at this time. Forever a Wrexham supporter. https://t.co/hMFxnrsekDAugust 9, 2024\nSome other storylines could get airtime in season 4 too. Reynolds and McElhenney have delt with a surprisingly controversial training ground project (h/t Wales Online) and Reynolds and Mullin helped make a dream come true for a young Wrexham fan dealing with a deadly disease (h/t Essentially Sports).\nOf course, there have been plenty of celebrity sightings too. In addition to Eva Longoria, Channing Tatum, Billie Joe Armstrong and Brandon Sklenar have all attended a match at the Racecourse Ground. And Danny Devioto joined McElhenney and fellow \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" co-stars Kaitlin Olson, Charlie Day and Glenn Howerton at the Cosm immersive reality venue to take in Wrexham's stunning win against Barnsley (h/t Wales Online).\nFinally, expect the show to once again pay tribute to superfan Arthur Massey, who passed away on August 9 at the age of 100. The World War II veteran was beloved by the club, its supporters and viewers of \"Welcome to Wrexham,\" so a tribute of some sort in season 4 would be fitting.\nMalcolm has been with Tom's Guide since 2022, and has been covering the latest in streaming shows and movies since 2023. He's not one to shy away from a hot take, including that \"John Wick\" is one of the four greatest films ever made.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name.",
