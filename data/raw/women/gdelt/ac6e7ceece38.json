It's that funny time of year when all sorts of names come out.\n\"But I think people who know the way this club works know that we will not be spending £2 million on a 31-year-old, for example.\"\nThe one-time MK Dons man may ultimately move on a free transfer with Blackburn keen to remove his salary from their wage bill.\nMeanwhile, one of this morning’s tabloids claims Sunderland manager Martin O’Neill has rebuffed an attempt by Town to take ex-Blue Titus Bramble on loan for the remainder of the season in January.\nBramble was suspended by the Black Cats between September and November due to his ongoing legal issues but returned to the fold under Steve Bruce and then the first team under O’Neill.\nElsewhere, on-loan striker Ronan Murray says he’s itching to make his first start for loan club Swindon having so far made only three sub appearances for the Robins, who he is with for a month: “Injuries or anything could happen and you just hope you take your chance when you get in, and hopefully I’ll do that.\n“It’s about trying to get in the first 11 and getting on the pitch, because I can’t really do anything on the bench.\n“It’s hard in training when you’re doing little drills as it’s not a game, so I just want to get on the pitch really.”\nAnd finally, ex-Town keeper Shane Supple says he’s still happy with his 2009 decision to quit soccer to return to Gaelic football: “I've no regrets, even if there could have been a possibility of going over [to Euro 2012] if I had stayed with it.”\nPhoto: Action Images via Reuters\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\nLoans and freebies on the cards for the rest of the season,me thinks.\nBuild around him\nHow come we are one of the well funded teams in the Championship, yet we haven't got two proper centre backs? Our best players are loans and are leaving. We can't give any of our squad away for cash. We can't sign anyone of promise and talent under 30 that isn't any good and wants to play for Ipswich.\nIn future years we look back and think why didn't we achieve anything while we had that amount of financial support. It's a shambles and a bl**dy disgrace.\nPJ you are a chancer and the weakest link.\nDon worry Mr Rodgers, Mr Clegg would!\nWhy am I not surprised with the news 'that we are still to make move for Andrews' ? - what I fear is happening, or more likely has already happened, is AGAIN we drag our feet whilst others do a deal.\nWhat about the 18 contracts that are out at the end of the season ? - looks very much like a repeat of last season all over again. Why ? - surely even the biggest idiot should have learned from the previous debacle.\nHow can any sane minded person have any confidence when this Club is ran in such an non professional way - wherever you look it's around us in terms of no direction.\nFollowers are criticised for being 'negative' - where is there ANY 'positiveness' from the so called 'big 3'.\nThe policy now seems to be 'wait until tomorrow and see what happens' Great !!\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
