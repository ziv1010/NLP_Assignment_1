He retired from football in 2014 having captained Sydney FC for four seasons, won two Premierships and one Championship.\nPost retirement, McFlynn stayed at Sydney FC as part of the football department. In 2016 he was appointed General Manager of Football and oversaw one of the club's most successful periods on the pitch, winning two A-League Championships, an Australian Cup and negotiated the club's highest ever player transfer fee.\nHe departed Sydney FC in 2019 ending fourteen successful years as a player and GM of Football at the club.\nPrior to joining AKL Football 24, McFlynn acted as a FIFA licensed player and coach agent based in Perth.
