  "body_text": "University of Fort Hare head to Limpopo this week believing they can secure a win on the road after giving the second-placed team in the Hollywoodbets Super League a proper scare on Saturday.\nWhile the 1-2 home defeat to Copperbelt may not have earned them any points on the log, it again proved that they can go toe-to-toe with the best in the land.\nThe fact that Fort Hare “won” the second half 1-0, thanks to a goal in added time by substitute Siziphiwe Gwazela, will give them further cause for optimism ahead of their trip up north.\nThere they will face an embattled First Touch on Thursday. The home side is currently bottom of the table after losing their first three games, including a 0-7 walloping at the hands of UWC and a heavy 1-4 defeat to UJ.\nThough UFH understand that a wounded side should never be underestimated, they will look to return to Alice with a full complement of points.\nVictory in Limpopo will take them to six league points from four games and, if other results go their way, see them shoot up the log from their current 11th position.\nSinayo Kupiso, who has taken the captain’s armband in only her second season with the Eastern Cape club, said her team played very well over the weekend although they could have made more of their opportunities.\n“The game was ours but we did not use our chances.”\nThey were not disappointed, however, as they realised they had come up against an opponent in red-hot form.\nKupiso reserved special praise for Amanda November, Gxumisa Afrika and Gwazela for playing their hearts out for the badge.\nCopperbelt were every bit as tough as their reputation suggested, she said.\n“When we had the ball, they were very aggressive, very physical. But they have prepared us for what is to come [in this tournament].”\nFollowing their most recent loss she reminded her teammates that it was still very early in the season and that there was no reason to drop their heads. They cannot discount the fact that they are rookies in the country’s toughest league and on a steep learning curve.\nKupiso said success against First Touch could not be taken for granted despite their run of poor form.\nThis is a team that has been in the Super League since its inception and the weight of that experience must not be taken lightly.\nShe did believe that Fort Hare would “come out on top” and said her teammates remained “very positive”.\nBy her own admission, Kupiso was “shocked” when she was approached to lead the side this year. She only transferred from Butterworth’s Thunderbirds in June last season.\nBut, having played in the Super League before and knowing how to manage the pressures associated with elite-level football, she felt she was making a difference in the side.\n“I’m enjoying the role even though it is a bit challenging.”\nKick-off is at 3pm.",
