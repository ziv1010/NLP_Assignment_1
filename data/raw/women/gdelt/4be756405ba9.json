The team had just returned from Lisbon after defeating Barcelona 1-0 in Saturday’s UEFA Women’s Champions League final. Wearing shirts that read “Champions 25,” the players—some sporting sunglasses despite the overcast sky—were introduced individually on stage to roaring cheers.\nIn south London, Crystal Palace fans lined the streets as a team bus wound its way to Selhurst Park. Around 20,000 people turned out to celebrate the club’s FA Cup victory—Palace's first major trophy in its 119-year history—after their 1-0 win over Manchester City on May 17.\nUp Next",
