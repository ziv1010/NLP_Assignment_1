  "body_text": "Vanuatu’s ABM Galaxy FC has announced the return of Batram Suri as head coach for the Port Vila Vodafone Super League, which kicks off on Friday.\nSuri is no stranger to the club, having previously guided Galaxy to the quarterfinals of the 2020 OFC Champions League before the competition was cut short due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\nSpeaking to Star Sports, the former Solomon Islands women’s national team head coach said the opportunity came at the perfect time, just weeks after his departure from the Solomon Islands Football Federation (SIFF).\n“First, I’d like to thank God for His goodness and love for me. Secondly, massive thanks to SIFF President Donald Marahare, Technical Director Moses Toata, CEO Leonard Paia, and the rest of the staff for the past three years. Though I faced challenges, I remained humble in handling and managing them,” Suri said.\nThe appointment came at the right time after he received his termination letter from SIFF.\n“God is good all the time. I was happy and proud that another opportunity came for me to continue working in football, which I love as both my job and my passion.”\nSuri also expressed gratitude to Galaxy FC’s management for trusting him to take up the role.\nHaving previously played in Vanuatu for Amical FC in 2010 and coached former champions Ifira Blackbird FC, the 53-year-old is well-versed with football in Port Vila.\n“There’s not much difference in the style of football between Vanuatu and back home in the Solomons. Vanuatu tends to be more physical and focused on kick-and-run football, while back home it’s more about a slow build-up. But nowadays, even in the Solomons, we’re starting to play more long balls,” he noted.\nWith Galaxy already qualified for the 2026 OFC Champions League, Suri said his future with the club beyond this season would depend on their performance.\n“My contract is set to last until next year’s Champions League, but it will depend entirely on our results in the league. I have to prove myself again this season,” he said.\n“Our immediate goal is to win the Port Vila Super League this season and also aim for next year’s Champions League title for our boss, Andrew Leong, who has done so much for the club and football here in Vanuatu.”\nThe club also welcomes back key forward Alwin Hou, who recently helped the Solomon Islands national futsal team secure their seventh OFC Futsal Men’s Cup title last month.\n“On behalf of everyone at the club, we warmly welcome Batram Suri as the Head Coach of the club.\n“Batram is not new to Galaxy FC family as he has held this role in 2020. He led the club to book a quarter final spot during the OFC Champions League in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.\n“However, the competition was cut short and we could not continue due to the COVID-19 global outbreak.\n“Welcome Mr Suri to Galaxy FC family.\n“We also also welcome back Alvin Hou who returns from 2025 OFC Men’s Futsal Cup.\n“Welcome back champ!” the statement from club concluded.\nGalaxy FC will open their Super League campaign this Saturday against North Efate United.\nBy TIMOTHY INIFIRI JNR\nSolomon Star, Honiara\nPhoto caption: Batram and Hou being welcomed by Galaxy FC officials upon their arrival.
