She is set to replaced by Scott Mills (left)\nEarlier this month it was announced the BBC's highest paid star, Gary Lineker , was leaving Match of the Day - despite reportedly offering to take a £350,000 pay cut\nHuw Edwards is another of the BBC's top earners for 2024, but he will not be returning to our TV screens after being convicted for possessing indecent images of children\nThese moves suggest Radio 1 breakfast host Greg James could be set to become the BBC's highest paid star on £419,999 - although Ball's replacement Scott Mills is likely to enjoy a substantial bump to his current salary of £319,999.\nJames moved up the list earlier this year to become the fourth highest paid star at the BBC, up from seventh in 2023, with his pay jumping from up to £399,999.\nThe 38-year-old came to prominence after taking over the Radio 1 drivetime slot from Mills in 2012.\nHe went on to host Radio 1 Breakfast after switching shows with Nick Grimshaw in 2018.\nHe has also hosted a number of TV shows for the corporation including Sun, Sex and Holiday Madness and Unzipped, both on BBC Three.\nJames is followed on the BBC's talent pay figures for 2024 by Question Time and BBC News presenter Fiona Bruce and Radio 5 Live presenter Stephen Nolan who are in joint fifth position and earn up to £409,999 apiece.\nDesert Island Discs and 6 Music host Lauren Laverne, who was paid up to £399,999, is in sixth and is one of four women in the top ten.\nAlan Shearer, without a major international football tournament on in 2023, saw his pay drop from up to £449,999 to as much as £384,999, putting him seventh on the list.\nRadio 1 breakfast host Greg James could be set to become the BBC's highest paid star on £419,999\nBBC Director General Tim Davie was the highest paid executive, but his pay did not rise this year\nIn joint ninth, with BBC Radio 4's Today programme presenter Nick Robinson, was BBC Breakfast host Naga Munchetty, whose pay went up slightly to £349,999.\nThe salary figures also show that most of the presenters listed had posted pay rises between 2023 and 2024, with BBC News presenter Reeta Chakrabarti getting a huge increase in the region of £55,000 to up to £274,999.\nBall's pay deal had been the focus of anger from licence fee payers - in 2020, it was revealed that she was earning £1.36million, and the resulting outcry led her to take a voluntary £380,000 pay cut.\nThe BBC said at the time that she felt it was inappropriate to earn so much in the middle of the pandemic.\nHer exit from the Radio 2 breakfast show is now being seen as an opportunity to reset BBC salaries.\nAn insider said: 'The reality is that the market has changed, and the BBC has changed, and that will be reflected in the deals we do.'\nSources say that BBC bosses have recently become determined that the days of high six- and even seven-figure presenter salaries at the BBC should come to an end.\nSo when £950,000-a-year Zoe - currently their best paid radio star - floated that she was thinking of moving on, they made minimal efforts to persuade her to stay.\nIn the latest BBC pay rankings BBC Breakfast host Naga Munchetty was joint ninth, after her annual earnings from the corporation went up slightly to £349,999\nThat position in the pay scale was shared by the BBC's former political editor Nick Robinson who is now one of the main presenters of Radio 4's Today programme\nBBC News presenter Reeta Chakrabarti was given an increase in the region of £55,000 to up to £274,999, according to the latest annual figures\nCurrently Mills, 51, who has hosted a number of different slots on the network and regularly stood in for his pal this year while she was off on compassionate leave, earns a comparably modest £315,000 each year.\nA BBC source told MailOnline: 'Scott will get a bump in his salary for taking on the breakfast gig, that's the flagship role and it's very demanding so he deserves it – but it won't take him anywhere close to the money Zoe has been getting.\n'The truth is, even though she is very well liked by the management and a real BBC stalwart, any opportunity to save some serious money has to be snatched at these days. This could save something close to half a million quid every year.\n'Despite having previously taken a pay cut Zoe's money had come under renewed scrutiny lately because it's right up towards the top of the published salaries list – next to the likes of Gary Lineker who is leaving too.\n'She would have been the corporation's biggest salary if she had outstayed him.\n'When Scott starts his money will be hundreds of thousands of pounds less per year than Zoe's was, so they're pretty pleased that next time they have to report their presenter pay it will look a lot less excessive.'\nDespite the high pay for its biggest names, the corporation revealed last month plans to cut a number of shows as part of a savings drive.\nThis includes long-running interview show HARDtalk, whose presenter Stephen Sackur branded the move 'depressing news for the BBC'.\nScott Mills and Zoe Ball were pictured embracing after leaving Wogan House in central London on Tuesday as the BBC announced he would be replacing her on the Radio 2 breakfast show\nLauren Laverne, soon to return to presenting Desert Island Discs on BBC Radio 4, was paid up to £399,999 - putting her in sixth place in the pay table and as one of four women in the top ten\nThe move also means UK radio audiences, including those on Radio 2 and Radio 5 Live, will now get overnight news bulletins from the BBC World Service, while radio station Asian Network will also lose its own 'bespoke' news service.\nNews bosses are planning to close 185 roles and open 55 new ones, which is a net reduction of 130 posts.\nThere are expected to be a further 50 posts going in the BBC's separate media operations division, of which 25 are linked to the news cuts. This includes people like camera operators.\nThe job losses are part of an expected broader 500 roles going across the BBC, announced earlier this year.\nIn a letter to staff in October, chief executive of BBC News and Current Affairs, Deborah Turness, said it was a 'tough day' and there had been 'difficult decisions', adding it had to 'operate within our budgets'.\nShe said the cuts would 'help meet the BBC's savings and reinvestment challenge'.\nMs Turness revealed proposals to deliver a saving of £24 million in the news division adding this was 'four per cent of our current budget'.\nShe added that she was 'sorry to say that post closures are unavoidable'.\nHARDtalk host Stephen Sackur said the news that the programme had been cancelled was 'disappointing'\nThe corporation revealed last month it was cutting a number of shows as part of a savings drive, with chief executive of BBC News and Current Affairs, Deborah Turness (pictured), saying it was a 'tough day'\nThe National Union of Journalists said it was concerned that 'important domestic stories' will be lost in the overnight radio news bulletins.\nIt added the UK-based bulletins had been part of BBC radio for over 40 years and were 'now being scrapped' for a 'minimal saving'.\nIt comes after the BBC director-general Tim Davie announced in March this year the requirement to find a further £200 million in savings.\nThis is despite the BBC having set out a £500million annual 'savings and reinvestment plan' in May 2022.\nA further shake up to the BBC's presenting line up also came earlier this month, when Lineker was axed from Match of the Day.\nIt followed claims from one insider that the new boss of BBC Sport views the former England footballer's salary as 'excessive' and believes his name no longer carries as much weight as it once did.\nThe former footballer is not close to his new boss Alex Kay-Jelski, who appeared determined to replace him after starting his Head of Sport job in April.\n'He's fronted Match of the Day for over 25 years, so the show is due a change, and Kay-Jelski is the man ruthless enough to trigger one,' the source said last month.\nAlex Kay-Jelski was appointed as the director of BBC Sport in April this year had been determined to replace Lineker\nLineker (pictured in 2023) was 'open' to staying at MOTD and is believed to have offered to take a £350,000-a-year pay cut from his £1.35million salary to stay but was turned down\n'There's a feeling within Match of the Day a new era is ready to kick in and Lineker will be the biggest casualty.'\nIndeed, Lineker was 'open' to staying at MOTD and is believed to have offered to take a £350,000-a-year pay cut from his £1.35million salary to stay but was turned down, according to BBC culture and media editor Katie Razzall.\nAccording to insiders, Kay-Jelski was equally tough in negotiations with Lineker over the renewal of his current contract, which expires at the end of the football season.\nIt is understood that Kay-Jelski was irritated by Lineker's often outspoken comments on his non-BBC podcast that he hosts alongside MOTD colleagues Alan Shearer and Micah Richards, which is produced by his own lucrative company Goalhanger.\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured",
