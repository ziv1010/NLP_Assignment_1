  "body_text": "What Happened?\nShares of media, broadcasting, and digital services company E.W. Scripps (NASDAQ: SSP) jumped 5.7% in the morning session after its Scripps Sports division formed an exclusive broadcast partnership with Major League Volleyball (MLV) to bring the league's 2026 championship to its ION network. The deal included live broadcasts of MLV's two semifinal matches and the championship match in May 2026. This partnership added another league to Scripps Sports' growing portfolio of women's sports, which already featured the WNBA and the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). The move was aimed at strengthening ION's programming with live sports content designed to attract dedicated and advertiser-friendly viewers.\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $2.15, up 1.8% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy E.W. Scripps? Access our full analysis report here.\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\nE.W. Scripps’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 79 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago when the stock dropped 3.6% on the news that markets became increasingly wary of high valuations following a significant AI-driven rally.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq fell approximately 1.4% as a wave of caution swept through the market. A key example of this trend is Palantir Technologies, which saw its shares drop around 7% despite reporting record quarterly results that surpassed analyst estimates and raising its full-year revenue outlook. This seemingly contradictory movement highlighted a broader sentiment shift. Investors appeared to be engaging in profit-taking, concerned that the recent surge in AI-related stocks had led to stretched valuations. This broader market caution affected high-growth technology companies that had previously surged on AI optimism but faced increased scrutiny, signaling a potential cooling-off period for the sector. Adding serious weight to this caution, leadership at both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley highlighted the possibility of a correction in the equity markets over the next couple of years. Despite the euphoria driven by AI optimism and the promise of future rate cuts, these banks viewed this cooling-off period not as a disaster, but as a necessary and healthy feature of a long-term bull market.\nE.W. Scripps is down 14.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $2.15 per share, it is trading 48.3% below its 52-week high of $4.15 from July 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of E.W. Scripps’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $189.55.\nDo you want to know what moves the business you care about?
