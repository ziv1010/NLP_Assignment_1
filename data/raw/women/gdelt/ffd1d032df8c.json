She first received the ball over the top and set up James’ opener, before chasing down another and set up Toone to score.\nIt looked as if she had finally got her goal when she nodded home in the second half, but once more an offside in the build-up saw it ruled out by VAR.\nA hat-trick of assists will have proven just reward in this match, but no doubt she will be chasing that first tournament goal against Wales despite already putting the ball in the net twice.\nNo signs of missing Earps\nHannah Hampton was a pivotal influence, with her ability on the ball crucial in England’s attacking efforts.\nThough tested little defensively, her distribution worked to brilliant effect as she earned a pre-assist by pinging the ball out to Alessia Russo, who in turn supplied Lauren James’ for the opener.\nIt is a clear strength of the Chelsea goalkeeper, who Wiegman announced was ahead of Mary Earps in the pecking order earlier in the year.\nIn the first half, Hampton often positioned herself high between the two centre-backs as if to create a back five and help keep position.\nAfter her display today, it is abundantly clear exactly how Wiegman wants to use the ball-playing attributes of her goalkeeper and why Hampton was the first-choice pick.\nWomen’s football continues to grow\nWhile the tournament is not on our doorsteps in the same way it was in 2022, the Netherlands-England match provided yet another milestone for women’s football.\nWith a full round of group games still to go, the 22,600 here helped set new record for the highest combined attendance across a Women’s EURO group stage.\nThat attendance stands at 287,438 with Switzerland opting to host all their group stage matches at major grounds.\nIt is another reminder, if at all needed, that women’s football is continuing its rapid rise with audiences across Europe and beyond continuing to flock to games in their numbers.\nWith it being impossible to walk more than 100m without seeing an advert relating to Euro 2025 in Zurich, in Switzerland there is no doubt that everyone watches women’s sport.",
