(PHOTO / AFP)\nThere are reminders around the city of Miami of Lionel Messi's impending arrival: A mural of the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner painted with pink and black Inter Miami colors in the artsy Wynwood neighborhood. Another painting of the soccer star at the entrance of a local Argentinian restaurant. No 10 Argentina jerseys sprinkled throughout the city.\nMessi, who turned 36 this month, announced on June 7 that he was joining Inter Miami in a move that stunned the soccer world and will bring one of the sport's biggest names to the United States and Miami, where enthusiasm for the sport has been growing.\nMessi, who spent the past two years with Paris Saint-Germain, is still finalizing paperwork with his new club. He is expected to make his Inter Miami debut on July 21 at home against Cruz Azul in the Leagues Cup.\nThe move is hoped to provide a huge boost to attendance and interest in Major League Soccer ahead of the 2026 World Cup, part of which will be hosted in the US, as well as for Inter Miami, a club led by another global soccer icon, David Beckham, that is looking to garner the same popularity as other sports franchises in South Florida.\nLionel Messi (first left) of Argentina competes during an international football invitational between Argentina and Australia in Beijing, capital of China, June 15, 2023.

And a part of constructing a platform to make sure we sell out every stadium is to make sure our top men's professional league, the MLS, is also selling out all of our stadiums.\"\nALSO READ: 'I'm going to Miami': Messi confirms move to MLS\nLionel Messi's move is hoped to provide a huge boost to attendance and interest in Major League Soccer ahead of the 2026 World Cup, part of which will be hosted in the US, as well as for Inter Miami, a club led by another global soccer icon, David Beckham, that is looking to garner the same popularity as other sports franchises in South Florida\nThe league is already getting there. Ticket prices for Inter Miami matches have skyrocketed since Messi's announcement and teams are already selling additional tickets to future matches against the club.\nAccording to data provided by Vivid Seats, a ticket marketplace, the average listed price for Inter Miami's match against Cruz Azul jumped from $126 on June 6 (one day before Messi's announcement) to $2,151 on June 20 — a 1,607 percent increase.\nSite traffic, the company said, increased by 27,037 percent from June 6 to 7.\nOn SeatGeek, another ticket exchange site, the average ticket to watch an Inter Miami match was $34 on June 6. On June 7, it was $178, according to data provided by the company.\n\"Messi is one of the greatest athletes of all time, and he is attracting huge demand for the chance to see him play in Miami and across the US,\" said Chris Leyden, SeatGeek's director of growth marketing. \"He joins the likes of LeBron (James) and (Tom) Brady when it comes to having such an immediate and dramatic effect on ticket demand after moving teams. Messi's situation is particularly unique in that a lot of US fans have a chance to see him live for the first time ever.\"\nALSO READ: Messi will increase MLS popularity, says Neymar\nThis handout picture provided by the Saudi Tourism Authority on May 1, 2023, shows Argentina's forward Lionel Messi (center), his wife Antonela Roccuzzo (first left) and their children visiting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Returning to Barcelona, a storied franchise where he spent most of his career, was also an option, but Messi said when he announced his decision that he wanted to go to the United States to \"live football in another way\".\nAccording to data provided by Vivid Seats, a ticket marketplace, the average listed price for Inter Miami's match against Cruz Azul jumped from $126 on June 6 (one day before Messi's announcement) to $2,151 on June 20 — a 1,607 percent increase\nIn more than 17 years of representing Argentina, Messi has scored 102 goals against 38 different national team opponents. One of the greatest scorers in the sport's history, Messi scored twice in last year's World Cup final against France, a match that Argentina won on penalties to give Messi the one major accomplishment that had been missing from his resume.\n\"This is going to stimulate everything about soccer in this country,\" Dorrance said of the move.\nMessi will join a struggling club that is last in the Eastern Conference with a 5-13 record. Inter Miami recently fired its coach, Phil Neville, after 2 1/2 seasons.\nMessi will have another Barcelona star at his side in Miami. Barcelona captain and former teammate Sergio Busquets will join the team this summer, as it recently confirmed via social media.\nREAD MORE: Barcelona wish Messi good luck in 'league with fewer demands'\nAhead of his arrival, Inter Miami is increasing capacity at DRV PNK Stadium by roughly 3,000 seats in the next four weeks by filling in the corners, raising capacity to about 22,000.\nAgencies via Xinhua\nALSO READ\nMore\nWinter Games: Jilek makes progress for Czech skaters, Klaebo equals gold record\nMilan-Cortina day 6: Sun earns China's first medal of short track speed skating\nArsenal miss chance to go six points clear with draw at Brentford\nAtletico hit Barcelona for four to take giant step toward Copa del Rey final\nItaly's Olympic venue a pacesetter for Chinese resorts\nEarning her wings\nMilan-Cortina day 5: Ning earns China's first skating medal\nReal Madrid reaches agreement with UEFA to officially end Super League project\nFOCUS\nColumnists\nCOMPANY\nDownload Our App\nCopyright 1995 - 2026.
