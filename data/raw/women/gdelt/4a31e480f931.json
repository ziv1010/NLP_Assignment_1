Neither Sen. Jon Ossoff nor Sen. Raphael Warnock is up for reelection this year — the former will run again in 2026 and the latter in 2028.\nGeorgia's U.S. senators worked on introducing legislation to expand tax credits for American-based entertainment productions, secure funding for several areas throughout rural Georgia, help remove lead pipes from drinking water systems, and introduce legislation to upgrade technical colleges to improve job training in Georgia.\nDooley enters race\nWith Ossoff's Senate seat up in 2026, former Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley announced on Aug. 4 that he would run as a Republican for U.S. Senate.\nWhile Dooley has not held an elective position, he says he will run as a political outsider while bringing \"good, old-fashioned Georgia common sense,\" per his campaign video. He also says he will \"work with President Trump, fight for you, and always put Georgia first.\"\nHe has received the support of Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who earlier this year decided not to run for the seat himself.\nDooley, a Georgia native from Athens, is the son of former University of Georgia football coach Vince Dooley and practiced law in Atlanta before he began coaching.\nEntertainment industries\nOn Aug. 1, Warnock and Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) introduced bipartisan legislation to extend and expand tax credits for American-based film, television, and live theater productions.\nAccording to a press release, the Creative Relief and Expensing for Audio and Television Enterprises (CREATE) Act \"would support the film, TV, and music recording industries by extending a tax provision that allows these businesses to deduct expenses incurred in the United States more quickly than they would otherwise be able to.\"\nThe legislation would help increase the likelihood of keeping production in the United States.\n\"From productions like The Color Purple, to The Hunger Games, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Georgia has become a national leader in the arts and entertainment industry,\" Warnock said in a statement. \"Our continued investments in incentivizing domestic production for film, television, and music benefit our culture and our economy. That is why I am proud to help lead this bipartisan legislation to support domestic entertainment productions that will continue creating good-paying jobs and unleash economic opportunity.\"\nDefense projects\nOn Aug. 1, the U.S. Senate passed Ossoff's bipartisan bill to provide about $556 million in funding to Georgia military construction projects, which Warnock also helped pass.\nThe funding is for defense projects for Georgia's military communities under the military construction and veterans affairs appropriations bill.\nPer a press release, the legislation \"includes a $30 million increase over the president's request for oversight and maintenance of privatized military housing,\" and will provide funding to the U.S Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\"From my leadership position on the Military Construction Subcommittee, I ensured this bill delivers the most military construction funding for Georgia in 15 years,\" Ossoff said in a statement. \"I was able to pass this bill through the Senate to upgrade military and veterans' facilities nationwide with strong bipartisan support. I call on the U.S. House to pass this bill without delay and get it to the President's desk.\"\n\"Georgia is a military state with 1 in 10 Georgia connected to our Armed Forces, so it was a top priority for me to secure the necessary federal funding to ensure our service members, their families, and base communities have the support they need to continue defending our freedoms with dignity and ensure our nation's military readiness,\" Warnock said in a statement.\nThe U.S. House has to pass the legislation before the president can sign it into law.\nBlack-owned businesses\nOn Aug. 4, Ossoff launched an inquiry with the U.S. Department of Commerce, urging the department to reverse the cancellation of a $3 million Capital Readiness Grant from the Urban League of Greater Atlanta.\nThe senator noted that the cancellation of the grant poses a risk to Atlanta's Black-owned businesses.\nAccording to a press release, the Urban League of Atlanta got the grant in 2023 \"to provide early support and technical assistance for Atlanta's Black entrepreneurs to help create jobs and continue to grow Georgia's economy.\"\nThe grant was cancelled in April of this year following an executive order that called for the dismantling of the Minority Business Development Agency.\n\"I strongly urge the Commerce Department to immediately review and reinstate the Urban League of Greater Atlanta's Capital Readiness grant,\" Ossoff wrote. \"Continued failure to do so punishes job creators, hinders Georgia's economic growth, and denies critical services from being delivered to my constituents.\"\nForestry industry\nOn Aug. 4, Warnock and Sens. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Jim Justice (R-W.Va.), and Steve Daines (R-Mont.) introduced bipartisan legislation to help expand forest product research.\nAccording to a press release, the Forest Bioeconomy Act would also build new markets \"formally establishing an Office of Technology Transfer at the United States Forest Service (USFS) and authorizing $5 million in appropriations.\"\nThe expansion of product research could help create new jobs in rural Georgia.\n\"Georgia's forestry industry is vital to our state's economy, and I'm proud to work with my colleagues to find a bipartisan solution to invest in the future success of this sector,\" Warnock said in a statement.\nRural funding\nOn Aug. 4, Warnock announced that he helped secure funding for public health and safety projects in rural areas throughout Georgia under the agriculture and rural development appropriations bill.\nAccording to a press release, \"several of the projects receiving direct federal investments were championed by both Senators Warnock and Jon Ossoff.\"\n\"As a senator for all Georgians, I am committed to delivering federal investments that improve the health and well-being of our state's rural communities,\" Warnock said in a statement. \"These investments in public health and public safety will go a long way in ensuring our rural communities have the resources needed to deliver for Georgians in every corner of the state.\"\nThe bill also includes $8.2 billion for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and $1.7 billion for rural housing assistance.\nVeterans small businesses\nOn Aug. 5, Ossoff and Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) announced they introduced bipartisan legislation to support small businesses owned by veterans.\nThe Small Business Administration has a program that gives a certain number of federal contracts to service-disabled veterans' small businesses.\nAccording to a press release, the Service-Disabled Veteran Opportunities in Small Business Act \"would require the SBA to issue guidance for the extension of contracts to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans more effectively.\"\nThe legislation would also require the SBA to issue a report to Congress with a list of each federal agency that failed to meet contracting goals and provide training to those agencies that failed to meet goals.\n\"Service-disabled veterans have made huge sacrifices in our national defense,\" Ossoff said in a statement. \"That’s why Senator Kennedy and I are introducing this bipartisan bill to support small businesses run by service-disabled veterans in Georgia and nationwide.\"\nSchool bus manufacturing\nOn Aug. 5, Ossoff again urged the Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright via letter to continue its commitment to Blue Bird school bus manufacturing in Middle Georgia.\nAccording to a press release, the senator is asking Wright \"to follow through on Federal grant funding to upgrade Blue Bird Corporation's manufacturing facility and bring jobs to Fort Valley, Georgia.\"\n\"The Federal investment that was promised to Blue Bird would allow it to expand its manufacturing facilities and meet growing market demand for electric school buses,\" Ossoff wrote to Wright. \"Blue Bird has yet to hear from DOE on the status of this grant, raising concerns that the department will renege on its commitment to the people of Middle Georgia.\"\nOssoff notes in the letter that Wright testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee that Blue Bird would get an answer on the frozen funds' status this summer.\nLead pipes\nOn Aug. 6, the Senate Appropriations Committee passed an amendment Ossoff recently introduced to remove lead pipes from drinking water systems, as part of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies funding bill.\nAccording to a press release, the amendment would \"increase funding by nearly 50% for the Reducing Lead in Drinking Water grant program in the Senate's draft appropriations bill, which helps reduce lead in drinking water by giving Federal resources to States and local communities for the removal of lead pipes and water treatment infrastructure improvements in schools and child-care facilities.\"\n\"Every Georgian deserves clean, healthy drinking water,\" Ossoff said in a statement. \"There's no worse nightmare for any family than not having access to clean water. That's why I brought Republicans and Democrats together to pass my amendment that will help communities in Georgia and across the nation remove dangerous lead pipes from homes, schools, and child care facilities.\"\nThe U.S. Senate floor will hear the amendment and vote to pass it.\nJob training\nOn August 7, Ossoff announced he introduced legislation to upgrade technical colleges to help Georgians get job training.\nAccording to a press release, the Skilled Workforce Act \"would direct the Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, to establish a new program that awards a competitive tax credit for workforce training projects.\"\nThe legislation would \"incentivize\" companies to invest in physical infrastructure and equipment at not only technical colleges, but also high schools and career academies for workforce development needs.\n\"Technical colleges, community colleges, and skills training are the foundation for Georgia's middle class,\" Ossoff said in a statement. \"That’s why I’m introducing this bill to encourage private businesses to invest in workforce development and hire Georgians.\"\nSecondary Content\nBottom Content\nDonate\nSupport Quality Journalism\nGPB is committed to bringing you comprehensive news coverage from Georgia, across the country and around the world.
