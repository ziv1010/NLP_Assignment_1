The initiative includes limited-edition packaging, a new anthem film, and fan-driven content shared across FIFA and Budweiser’s social channels.\n“Whether it’s being in a local pub at match kickoff or being in a packed stadium cheering the return of a champion club, Budweiser will be there to ensure every moment of this FIFA Club World Cup feels like an epic celebration in the making,” said Richard Oppy, global president, Premium Company at AB InBev.\nThe red crates that first appeared after the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar have returned, and will once again be used to distribute free beer* in the hometown of the winning club. This year, a one-of-a-kind gold container will also be delivered – though its contents will remain under wraps until celebration day.\nPartner Content\nTo accompany the launch, Budweiser has released a new 60-second film, “ThunderBud”, set to AC/DC’s “Thunderstruck”. The spot shows the opening of a Budweiser can triggering a stadium-wide celebration.\nBudweiser will also promote “Celebration of the Match” content – a FIFA-produced series spotlighting standout moments from each match. Fans will be able to vote for their favourite moments online, with Budweiser amplifying the results via social media.\nIn retail, Budweiser and Budweiser Zero are being released in new FIFA Club World Cup 2025-themed packaging. The designs feature gold accents and an updated crest. Budweiser Zero will retain its existing visual identity, now with a white base to highlight its alcohol-free positioning.\nBudweiser first launched “Bring Home The Bud” during the 2022 FIFA World Cup and reintroduced it for the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup. The platform has since become a recurring element in the brand’s football marketing strategy.\nFurther details on this year’s “Bring Home The Bud” rollout will be shared during the tournament.\nRelated news",
