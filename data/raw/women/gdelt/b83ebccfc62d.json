Chelsea embodies the precision, strategic thinking, and excellence that define our approach to trading. The activations we delivered from the Gala in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to training ground access and the Player of the Year Awards partnership have created unforgettable experiences for TMGM clients and Chelsea fans across the Asia-Pacific region. We're excited to build on this foundation in year three.\"\nDan McEwan, Chelsea Football Club's Partnerships Director, commented: “We are pleased to continue our partnership with TMGM.

Nicknamed the Blues, the club lifted the Champions League for the first time in 2012 and domestically has also won the Premier League five times, the FA Cup eight times, the Football League Cup five times, the UEFA Europa League twice, the UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup twice, the UEFA Super Cup twice, and the Football League Championship once, in 1955.\nThe 2021 Champions League and Super Cup triumphs ensured Chelsea became the first club to win four major UEFA club competitions twice, following our earlier successes in those two competitions as well as the Europa League and Cup Winners’ Cup. Having added the UEFA Conference League in 2025 when Real Betis were beaten in the final, the Blues are the only club to have won all the current UEFA club competitions.\nThe Chelsea Women’s team has enjoyed a huge amount of success and in 2025 won the FA Women’s Super League for a sixth consecutive year and the eighth time overall. The Women’s FA Cup has been won on six occasions. We have also captured the FA Women's League Cup three times, as well as reaching the UEFA Women's Champions League final in 2021. In the 2020/21 and 2024/25 seasons, a domestic treble of trophies was secured.\nIn addition to possessing some of the world’s most recognisable players, Chelsea has also invested in our future with a state-of-the-art Academy and training centre in Cobham, Surrey. Since the Academy building’s opening in 2008, the club has won seven FA Youth Cups, back-to-back UEFA Youth League titles in 2015 and 2016, and the U23 and U18 Premier League national championships most recently in 2019/20 and 2017/18, respectively.\nThe Chelsea Foundation boasts one of the most extensive community initiatives in sports, helping to improve the lives of children and young people worldwide.",
