  "body_text": "A home owned by top WWE couple Seth Rollins and Becky Lynch was reportedly burglarized shortly after they both appeared on the live broadcast of RAW Monday (July 7) night, TMZ Sports reports.\nThe couple's Playa Del Rey, California, home was reportedly hit at around 3:00 a.m. local time, hours after their respective appearances at the Amica Mutual Pavilion in Providence, Rhode Island, police sources told the website. No individuals were present inside the home at the time of the break-in.\nThe suspect(s) reportedly gained access through the home's rear slider and took cash, according to law enforcement sources. Rollins reportedly made the 911 call to report the burglary.\nNo arrests have been made in relation to the incident and an investigation is ongoing. Rollins opened Monday night's episode of RAW with an in-ring segment alongside his faction comprised of Bron Breakker, Bronson Reed and WWE Hall of Famer Paul Heyman and defeated Penta in the main event match before being attacked by LA Knight prior to the show going off the air.\nLynch, the WWE Women's Intercontinental champion, appeared in a segment opposite Bayley and Lyra Valkyria ahead of their title match at Sunday's (July 13) all-women's premium live event Evolution, which resulted in physicality as Valkyria hit her Nightwing finisher on both of her upcoming opponents.\nRollins and Lynch began dating in January 2019 and publicly announced their relationship on the night of WrestleMania 35, which saw him defeat Brock Lesnar for the WWE Universal title in the event's opening match and Lynch defeat Ronda Rousey and Charlotte Flair to win the RAW and SmackDown's Women's championships in the first ever women's main event on WWE's biggest annual show. The couple welcomed their daughter, Roux, in December 2020 and were married in June 2021.\nThe reported incident is similar to past ones targeting Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce, as well as Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, around the time of their respective Monday Night Football games last year.",
