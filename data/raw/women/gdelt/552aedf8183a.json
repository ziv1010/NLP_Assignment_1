  "body_text": "- The Around the Grounds column is a weekly look at all that's happening around the western region and beyond. This week, the birth of a new club, a comeback victory, a special round of fixtures, and more.\nThe region's best soccer players will be offered the opportunity to remain at home, while they continue to hone their ability, after the establishment of a new club.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nCentral West FC was officially launched in early July, a new club that will represent the region in its name from 2026, superseding Western NSW Football as the region's leading soccer program.\nThis comes after a Football NSW restructure that will see the folding of the Association Youth League, the competition Western had been competing in.\nCentral West FC will now compete in Boys Youth League (BYL) 3, which is currently known as NPL, which currently consists of clubs and not association teams.\nPresident Troy Kearney said the new club will be a great opportunity for the region's emerging talent.\n\"Kids that have always gone to Sydney to get opportunities, to play in big teams and get seen by top coaches and have all these facilities available to them,\" he said.\n\"Now with this new competition, there's actually no need for them to travel to Sydney to play for certain clubs anymore. Kids from Orange and Bathurst can stay here and play for this team.\"\nCentral West FC's license will be for two years and will include under 13s, 14s, 15s, 16s and 18s.\nIt won't include any senior teams.\nThe region hasn't been represented by a senior team in the NSW state leagues after the demise of the old Western NSW FC at the end of 2021.\nKearney said there is a possibility of a senior team in 2028.\n\"We've put an inquiry into the seniors team,\" he said.\n\"The license we're getting is a two-year license and they [Football NSW] said depending on how we go over those first two years, they'll look to introduce seniors after that.\n\"It's something we really want to work towards. Our under 18s are undefeated this year, but unfortunately, I think seven of our under 18s will age out, which means they've got nowhere to go. So we have actually asked the question: 'How do we get a senior team going?'\n\"They've said if you give us two good years in the BYL and be competitive, get great coaches, get good framework and move forward in that, they'll look at actually allowing us to have a senior's license.\"\nThe club's colours and jerseys are yet to be finalised, but Kearney said they will be lodged with Football NSW soon.\nPush for reduced rates shot down\nA proposal to give local teams and clubs discounted access to an elite training facility at Mudgee has been voted down.\nCr Rod Pryor pushed for discount of at least 50 per cent for local users hiring the facility at a recent Mid-Western Council meeting, but his motion was shot down.\nThe Team Training Village is located next to the Glen Willow sporting complex and has been tipped to host the NSW State of Origin side, the NSW Waratahs, and Olympic athletes as well as elite sporting schools.\nCr Pryor argued the facility was built using public funds, including council contributions and federal grants awarded in the community's name, and that locals should not have to pay full price to access it.\n\"People sitting around the table - and in the community - I think would agree that if you were to spend money to build something, it seems pretty unfair to actually be expected to pay to use it,\" Cr Pryor said.\nThe facility can accommodate up to 96 guests across 32 rooms and features a gym, cold-water recovery pools, meeting spaces, a commercial kitchen, a games room, a prayer room, and outdoor barbecue and firepit areas.\nAlthough open to community, school, sporting and corporate groups, council staff note that discounted pricing for local users was not part of the original business model.\nIn a report to councillors, it advised that financial modelling would be needed to assess how reduced fees could affect the facility's income and the council's capacity to fund other services.\nThe report also noted the facility was not intended to compete with existing local operators such as gyms, recovery centres or conference venues.\nReturning with a win\nNick Hyde is back in the saddle and back in the winner's circle.\nGiven his height, Hyde battled with his weight during his initial stint as a jockey and took a break from the racing game shortly after riding his first winner, Cheap Charlie, at Nowra in July of 2021.\nOriginally from Dubbo, the 26-year-old has now returned with a fresh approach and is apprenticed to Gulgong trainer Brett Thompson.\nHe had his first race back in the saddle last month, and on Saturday, July 19, he scored the first victory since returning.\nHyde rode outsider Proofreader to victory for Thompson in the opening event at Coonabarabran.\nHyde produced a smart ride to and fired with debutant Proofreader ($14) from near last along the rails to win the Imperial Hotel Maiden Handicap (900m) from Winning Winnie ($7.50) and Dendina ($12).\nIronically, Winning Winnie is trained by Hyde's father, Dubbo-based trainer Darren Hyde.\nThe trainer got his win a little later in the meeting to complete a memorable day for the Hyde family.\nNick Heywood rode $20 chance Adelsun to victory for trainer Darrem in the Imperial Hotel Super Star Staff Benchmark 58 Handicap (1200m).\nBattle for top spot heats up\nBathurst St Pat's have moved into top spot in the Central West Premier League Hockey women's competition.\nThe competition celebrated Indigenous Round at Orange on Saturday, July 19, and St Pat's and Orange United showed their quality when winning both matches they played.\nSt Pat's downed Bathurst City 7-4 and then downed Orange CYMS 3-0 to move ahead of the Lithgow Panthers on the ladder.\nLithgow, however, now has a game in hand after only playing once at Orange. The Panthers downed Parkes 3-1 in their match.\nOrange United defeated Parkes (2-1) and Bathurst Souths (3-0) to remain third on the ladder.\nOrange CYMS beat Bathurst Souths 3-2 in the other fixture on Saturday.\nTo mark Indigenous round, teams wore specially-designed kits while the umpire's outfits were also emblazoned with artwork by Kirsten Fitzpatrick.\nThe men's competition had a bye but will return this coming Saturday, July 26, for the penultimate round.\nParkes United is unbeaten and eight points clear at the top with a game in hand in the men's competition.",
