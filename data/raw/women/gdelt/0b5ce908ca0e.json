  "body_text": "—Back from vacation, and the biggest piece of news I missed was that the U of L men’s basketball team will play a pair of exhibition games next month in the Bahamas.\nMonday afternoon Cardinal news and notes\nBethany Marie is geeked for the return of news and notes.\n“I’m excited for our team to participate in the Baha Mar Hoops Summer League in just a few weeks,” said Kelsey. “We’ve brought so many new pieces to our program and the practice and playing time this trip will allow us is invaluable to our team. It will be a vital time for us on the court, but it will also give us plenty of opportunities to gel off the court as well. I hope by taking this trip, we have a real advantage when it comes time to start practicing in the fall.”\nLouisville will play against international competition as part of the 2024 Baha Mar Hoops Summer League managed by veteran sports marketing firm bdG Sports. The Cardinals will arrive Sunday, July 28 at the Baha Mar Convention, Arts & Entertainment Center onsite at the Baha Mar resort in Nassau, Bahamas. UofL will play two games before returning home to the United States on Friday, August 2.\nThe international opponents for the two games have yet to be determined.\nRecent coaches have had different mindsets when it comes to using the exhibition tours, which programs are allowed to do once every four years. Rick Pitino loved it, Chris Mack didn’t, and I’m not sure Kenny Payne was even aware it was a rule.\nFor us, obviously, getting an early glimpse at this year’s team is wonderful. For Pat Kelsey, I think it can be even more beneficial.\nThe primary reason is fairly obvious: He has 11 new scholarship players (two are redshirting) and limited time to figure out the best way for all those parts to fit together. Seeing them in actual game scenarios should be a significant early aid in that process. Plus, going on a foreign trip smack in the middle of the preseason should help with the team-building that also needs to occur at an accelerated rate.\nThen there’s also Louisville’s ability to create NIL opportunities for its foreign-born players who, by rule, can not make money off NIL in the States.
