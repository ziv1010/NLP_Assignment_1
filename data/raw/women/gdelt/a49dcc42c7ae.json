  "body_text": "Manchester United have launched another round of redundancies at the club just days after the Europa League final defeat with 200 staff set be axed.\nStaff across a number areas including scouting and sports science in addition to non-footballing departments have been told on Friday whether they will be kept or let go, the Telegraph reports.\nIt comes at a time where morale at Old Trafford is at an all-time low following Wednesday’s defeat in Bilbao to Tottenham. The Premier League comes to an end with United currently sat in 16th place following their worst season since 1973-74 – a campaign which ended in relegation from the top flight.\nThis week’s defeat in Spain also ensured United failed to qualify for next season’s Champions League, a setback, coupled with their woeful league form, that is expected to cost the club in the excess of £150m in prize money, gate receipts and broadcast revenue.\nSir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS completed their minority takeover in February 2024, embarking on a series of unpopular cost-cutting measures with 250 jobs around the club cut last summer.\nRatcliffe and Avi Glazer were both present at San Mames on Wednesday night, heavily booed at a viewing party back in Manchester which was reportedly attending by hundreds of staff and their families.\nIn February, chief executive Omar Berrada unveiled plans for more cuts as part of the ‘transformational plan’ to return the club to profitability. United have recorded losses in the last five consecutive years dating back to 2019.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

This cannot continue.\n‘Our two main priorities as a club are delivering success on the pitch for our fans and improving our facilities. We cannot invest in these objectives if we are continuously losing money.’\nIn a March interview with Gary Neville, Ratcliffe claimed United would have ‘gone bust by Christmas’ if it wasn’t for stringent measures put in place.\nMore Trending\nAmong the other cuts made around the club, free lunches will no longer be provided at Old Trafford, a measure thought to be saving around £1million a year.\nAmong the most high-profile decisions was ending Sir Alex Ferguson’s ambassadorial role at the club, saving United £2million a year.\nFerguson retired in 2013 after 26 years at the helm and still regularly attends United games in the director’s box. He is set to remain on as an non-executive director but his ambassadorial role will officially end after the final game of the season on Sunday.\nIn the wake of Wednesday’s defeat to Tottenham, head coach Ruben Amorim offered to step down and leave the club ‘without compensation’. United however are still backing the Portuguese coach.\nMORE: Pep Guardiola provides update on Man City future after threatening to quit\nMORE: Arsenal told £9m Premier League flop could fix their striker problem\nMORE: Former Man Utd star Brandon Williams avoids prison after crashing car at almost 100mph",
