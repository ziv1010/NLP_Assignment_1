  "body_text": "Alex Greenwood will warm up for England’s game against Sweden tonight wearing a shirt with her name spelled in British Sign Language.\nThe Lionesses have been given special warm-up tops which use the BSL fingerspelling alphabet rather than a standard A-Z. It’s part of EE’s new campaign, 'Support. It’s In Your Hands', which is aimed to keep the UK’s 87,000 British Sign Language users in the Deaf community involved in the football conversation.\nManchester City star Alex, 30, told Women’s Health that she was honoured to be part of the initiative, for a very personal reason.\nWhat to Read Next\n‘My mum has struggles with her hearing and I’ve grown up with her wearing hearing aids, she said.’She’s definitely found certain things difficult where she’s had to lip read people. Coming to games can be difficult for her as well. My mum isn’t at the stage where she needs to use and learn BSL, she’s picked up bits as she’s gone along, but she might have to use it in the future.’\nAs part of EE’s campaign, Alex and other international footballers - including former WH cover star Mary Earps and Ella Toone- spent time learning BSL with a group of people who are deaf. She found it ‘really hard but it was such an eye opener.’\nAlex added: ‘It was one of the most incredible experiences I’ve ever had in my entire life. I think it’s so important that BSL is available for everyone to learn. Everyone should be able to feel included in a conversation without it being awkward. I walked away from that experience thinking we should all do that stuff more. It made me think of things differently.\n‘I definitely believe that BSL should be taught on the curriculum in schools. My nephew is in high school at the moment, and if my mum, his nan, ever has to use BSL then he would know how to communicate with her using it.’\nAlex told WH that she’s always happy to have awkward conversations, especially if the final aim is lasting, positive change. ‘I am a big believer in speaking about things and having uncomfortable conversations, about going out of my comfort zone and learning things,’ she said. ‘But it’s important to make sure that the opportunities to learn things are available as well.’\nFor more information on how to learn BSL and sign your support, visit eelearnsmart.co.uk\nMore Lionesses...\n- The Lionesses model England's new kit - which they helped design\n- Watch Ella Toone's My Body My Story\n- Meet the inspiring women from the world of football who paved the way for the Lionesses\nEmma Gritt is the Multiplatform Director of Women's Health UK.
