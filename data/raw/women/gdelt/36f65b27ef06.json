Her strike in the 63rd minute helped Barcelona to their 2-0 victory over Lyon as they retained their status as European champions for another year.\nThe Best FIFA Women's Player award has been distributed since 2016 and has been won by seven different players, including Bonmati. Prior to her first triumph in 2023, Barcelona teammate Alexia Putellas had claimed the prize twice on the spin.\nThere were 16 nominees in total for the accolade and Bonmati fought off competition from a number of her club and international teammates.\nCaroline Graham Hansen, Keira Walsh, Ona Batlle and Salma Paralluelo are among the current Barcelona players who were nominated, while Chelsea's Lucy Bronze and Arsenal's Mariona Caldentey both represented the Catalan giants in 2023/24 before summer exits.",
