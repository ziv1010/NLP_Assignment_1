  "body_text": "No matter what the outcome will be from Friday night’s match between the United States and Vietnam, the athletes competing in the 2023 Women’s FIFA World Cup are already winners.\nHosted by Australia and New Zealand, the tournament kicked off July 20 and runs through Aug. 20. The U.S., led by holdovers Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan and featuring Emily Sonnett (who played at UVA) and Emily Fox (who is from Ashburn and plays for NWSL’s North Carolina Courage), is favored to win a record third consecutive title. The Americans are the only four-time World Cup winners, claiming titles in 1991, 1999, 2015 and 2019.\nEqually impressive is what these women have done off the field as they’ve rallied to get equal and fair treatment for themselves and their teammates around the world.\nThe march to equality for women’s sports has been slow and fractured. While audiences for women’s sports, especially soccer, tennis and basketball, have climbed steadily over the years, the treatment and compensation has not kept pace.\nA combined 1.12 billion viewers tuned into official broadcast coverage of the Women’s World Cup France 2019 across all platforms — a record audience for the competition, according to FIFA, soccer’s governing body.\nFIFA Women’s World Cup 2023 CEO David Beeche forecasts 2 billion viewers will watch this summer’s tournament — a 90% increase in eyeballs compared to the 2019 tournament.\nYet, the average salary for female players was $14,000 a year, according to a 2022 FIFA report.\nLast year, a group of players across the globe asked FIFA to increase the overall prize money, guarantee that a percentage of the money would go directly to the players themselves and improve tournament accommodations for female players.\nIn response, FIFA raised the prize pool for the 2023 women’s tournament by 300% to $150 million, and agreed to guarantee pay to players directly, which is significant for many of the athletes, who in some cases don’t have club teams that pay salaries, are semi-pros or even amateurs.\nEvery player will earn at least $30,000, with the amount increasing the further that teams progress in the tournament. The 23 players on the title-winning squad will each get $270,000.\n“We still have a ways to go, but having them direct the payments to players is huge — it’s a life-changing thing for many of these players entering the tournament,” U.S. forward Alex Morgan told the Associated Press. “Coming away with each player making $30,000 is huge because usually that money goes to federations and those players don’t see any, or much of that money.”\nNot only that, the conditions the players will experience on the ground in Australia and New Zealand — such as travel and accommodations — are now equitable to those provided to the men.\n“It means a lot to every player stepping into that tournament because it really means that the women’s game has finally taken the steps that we’ve been fighting for,” U.S. defender Crystal Dunn said. “When we step onto the field, yes, we are opponents, but at the end of the day we’re all fighting for this game to grow, and for everybody.”\nWhile the Women’s World Cup prize money is now three times the 2019 figure and 10 times more than in 2015, it is still considerably lower than the $440 million in total prize money awarded at the men’s World Cup in Qatar last year.\nEarlier this year, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that the ultimate goal is equity between the men’s and women’s games by the 2026 Men’s World Cup and the 2027 women’s edition.\nThat goal is righteous and long overdue. The United States has been a leader in this fight and we should all cheer these athletes on — in their quest for equality and an unprecedented consecutive third World Cup title.",
