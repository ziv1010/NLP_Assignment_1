They beat Chelsea in the 2021 final in Gothenburg to earn their maiden Champions League trophy.\nThis season, shorn of injured two-time Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas until recently, the Catalans lost only one game in Europe, a group phase match at Bayern Munich.\nDetermined to succeed\nDuring Lyon's era of success, Barcelona watched carefully, investing in facilities and bringing through young players primed to play for the first team, including key midfielder Aitana Bonmati.\nThey have supplemented that with star signings, including Keira Walsh from Manchester City for a world-record women's transfer fee last summer, of 400,000 euros ($427,000).\n\"It's one of the main reasons why I came, and just the ambition of the club in general,\" Walsh told reporters.\n\"If you look at how many finals they have been in in recent years it is incredible. To be in another one now shows how much the club values women's football and where they are trying to take it.\"\nThe England international midfielder said one key difference at Barcelona was the urgency for success.\n\"It was the wanting to win, the wanting to be in the Champions League final,\" she continued.\n\"Previously I didn't experience that as much, it was 'next season will be better, next season we'll do it again,' whereas here, it's 'we want to do it now'.\n\"(They are) pushing the women's team to be to be where they should be and really grow women's football and investing, and trying to make this the best team possible.\"\nDespite Barcelona's determination, Walsh admitted it was difficult -- but not impossible -- for her club to match Lyon's incredible run because of improvements across the game.\n\"The other teams are also great, Wolfsburg, Lyon, I think women's football is just growing so much,\" she added.\n\"Now that I think it would be difficult for any team to go on a run like that now, but I never say never.\n\"It's a top club here and that's the ambition they have -- to do something like that. So yeah, why not?\"\n© 2023 AFP",
