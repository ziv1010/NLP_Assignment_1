At the start it was a bit daunting but as the game went on we were thriving off it and it’ll be amazing to get that again for this game on Sunday.”\nThe 24-year-old says she expects Norwich to come to Suffolk looking for revenge: “Whenever we play Norwich they always want to beat us, it’s a derby game, it is what it is. We’ve just got to keep playing our game, do what we do and smash them again.”\nEntry is free for Town season ticket holders but otherwise is £3 for adults, £1 for concessions and free for under-16s.\nITFC Women’s midfielder Blue Wilson will be among those appearing on Saturday’s Life’s a Pitch on BBC Radio Suffolk.\nPhoto: Action Images via Reuters\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\nGreat game girls another enjoyable afternoon at the seaside and Mrs Budgieplucker is becoming a football convert as well\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
