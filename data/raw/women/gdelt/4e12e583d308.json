  "body_text": "The Chelsea defender also underwent a minor knee surgery, following her decision to withdraw from the European Championship squad the previous day.\nThe 31-year-old England Lionesses defender, who won Euro 2022, pulled out of Euro 2025, stating she was unable to 'give 100 per cent mentally or physically'.\n\"This is one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make, but after careful thought and discussions with my team, I have decided to withdraw from selection for the England squad ahead of Euro 2025,\" Bright's emotional statement on social media read.\n\"Football has given me so much, and representing my country has always been my greatest honour. My pride and ego tells me to go but I think the team and the fans deserve more.\n\"Right now I'm not able to give 100% mentally or physically.\n\"As much as I want to be out there running through brick walls for England and fighting alongside my team-mates, stepping back is the right thing for my health, my future in the game and most importantly the team.\n\"It wouldn't be fair for me to take the place and opportunity away from another player who is ready and able to give everything for the badge and country.\n\"I'll be supporting the team with everything I've got, and hoping this incredible group of players will do the nation proud.\n\"Thank you to my team-mates, coaches, and, most importantly, the fans for your unwavering support, it means the world to me.\"\nAccording to 'The Sun', she has split from her fiancé Levi Crew after coming quite close to a fitness instructor, who also left his wife and is currently living at Chelsea captain Millie’s luxury house.\nBright, a key figure in England’s backline, met the trainer in 2024 after starting to work out at a gym in Redhill, Surrey.\nBright, who made 36 appearances in all competitions in the 2024-25 season, helped Chelsea win the domestic treble of Women's Super League, FA Cup and League Cup.\nBright, who led England in 88 games, was the captain of the team when they lost to Spain in the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup final.",
