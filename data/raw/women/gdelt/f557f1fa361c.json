She also faces competition from Arsenal’s Mariona Caldentey and Alessia Russo.\nShekiera Martinez (West Ham United), Mary Fowler (Manchester City), Kiko Seike (Brighton) and Olivia Smith (Liverpool) are also in the mix for the award.\nLe Tissier spoke of her delight at United qualifying for the Champions League with a 2-2 draw with Manchester City at the weekend.\nAfter the match she claimed, “we’re so together, honestly – I feel like we’re unbreakable at times”.\nThe 23 year old will be looking to lift her first trophy as captain when the Red Devils travel to Wembley on Sunday 18th May to face Chelsea in the final of the FA Cup.\nFeatured image Jan Kruger via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
