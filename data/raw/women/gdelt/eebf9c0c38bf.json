  "body_text": "Dwyane Wade Q&A: LeBron James, Chris Bosh, Pat Riley, Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat, Utah Jazz\nNBA Hall of Fame guard Dwyane Wade was one of the best playmakers on the court during his career, and now he’s looking to make a new game-changing play in retirement.\nWade collaborated with RealTruck to create a customized one-of-a-kind “Champions Edition” 2017 Ford F-250 Super Duty to be auctioned at Barrett-Jackson in Palm Beach, Florida, on April 25th to benefit Social Change Fund United.\nBefore the auction, Wade discussed how Social Change Fund United came together with Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul, what project SCFU is working on, his thoughts on the Utah Jazz, if he’d ever transition to the front office, if he’d consider a minority stake in his hometown Chicago Bulls, LeBron James’ longevity, how their Miami Heat trio with Chris Bosh compares to other superteams around Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Larry Bird, the divorce between Pat Riley and Jimmy Butler, and more with HoopsHype.\nHow did your Social Change Fund United come together?\nDwyane Wade: CP (Chris Paul), Melo (Carmelo Anthony), and myself were all talking about what we had done at the ESPYs and the call to action that we said to our fellow athletes when we stood on that stage a few years ago. We started talking about that and what we were all going to do. We were all doing things in our individual lives, but what were we going to do as a collective power? How could we bring it together to create something that could be impactful and something that other athletes want to be a part of?\nWe created Social Change Fund United in response to the racial injustice that was going on across our country. It was the perfect time for us throughout that pandemic time when so much injustice was going on that we said we had to do something. We had a lot of companies out there saying what they were going to do and the money they were going to give. We wanted to be one of those funds that would be able to say we have the answers over here and places that this money could go with the things we’re focused on to help these communities where money is poor.\nWas there a particular event that spurred Social Change Fund United?\nDW: I think the George Floyd moment is probably one of the most sustainable moments in all of our minds. I think around that time, it was a time when everyone was collectively trying to come together, and that’s what we did. We collectively came together to try to maximize our resources. We all have our own charities and foundations. This was something that we wanted to do collectively and build this space for other athletes as well to be able to be a part of.\nIt was simple from there. How do we react? How will we be prepared? How do we help once we come out of this? One of the things that’s very important to Melo (Carmelo Anthony) is when people are coming out of the jail system. What opportunities are there for them? What can they do? What can we do to be in a place to provide some resources for them? We all have things that we’re passionate about, and to have this fund to help and support those things is a pretty cool thing for us.\nNow you’re collaborating with RealTruck to auction off a truck for money towards the Social Change Fund United. Are there any features on the truck you enjoy the most?\nDW: The reason we decided to do this is because it’s another way and opportunity to help bring awareness and support from others who may not know about it for the Social Change Fund United. We have our goals, things that we need, and funds that we have to raise to support entrepreneurs. That’s something we’re really into: innovation and, most importantly, under-resourced communities. For us, it was very important to get outside of the natural basketball arena and move it to other arenas. We’re thankful to RealTruck for coming in and helping us customize something that will be cool for a fan who loves the game of basketball and followed my career.\nIt’s going to have a lot of graphics from my career and a lot of cool things inside. One of the coolest things I geeked out about is the signature light. When you look up, you see all the stars at the top. My signature is up there when the lights are flashing. It’s a cool customization about my journey and my gold medal. You’ll see that on the wheels. You'll see things about our championships. Everyone loves something customized, especially if it’s a one-of-one. Hopefully, it’s something that will draw a lot of money that can go right to Social Change Fund United.\nWith all the proceeds from the sale of the RealTruck going towards your Social Change Fund United, what projects will you use the money towards for SCFU?\nDW: With Social Change Fund United, we focus on economic empowerment and sustainability for other resources in communities. We have a team out there finding these programs, groups, and individuals who can use our assistance. I think it’s very important for us to understand that we’d love to be in a position where we support students who are working to build their entrepreneurial skills. How do we step up and be in that space?\nWe’re business leaders, and we want to be in a place where we’re helping the next generation of business leaders and providing funds for small businesses. We have many different programs we work with, and relationships like RealTruck and so many others help us reach our goal of providing more opportunities to more individuals who are in need.\nIs there anything else about the event with RealTruck coming up or other Social Change Fund United projects you have in the works that you want readers to know about?\nDW: Since we’re talking about RealTruck, it’s cool to be able to customize a championship edition of this truck. I think what’s cool about it outside of all the customizations that I talked about are the other things where we tried to sweeten it for everybody where I’m giving away bottles of wine, signing shoes, I’m signing jerseys, we’re giving tickets to events that Carmelo, CP, and myself do. We’re trying to make sure that we show everyone that we’re all into this, and this money is going to help so many individuals. If it’s one dollar or a couple hundred grand, so many individuals are going to be able to reach their dreams and goals by giving them hope and putting them in spaces for opportunities. That’s what this is about. Social Change Fund United is a vehicle that we’re using to be able to provide these opportunities.\nI also have some NBA questions for you. As a part governor of the Utah Jazz, what are your thoughts on their season, and would you ever consider taking a more active role in Utah's management?\nDW: When I decided to come into this, I came in as an investor. I didn’t come into this trying to have a job in the NBA in a management position (laughs). I’m learning and building a relationship with Utah. I’m on the investor side of my life. It’s not something that’s a part of my future (management). It’s something that Ryan (Smith) and I talked about early on. What roles did we want to play in this? Neither one of us wanted to play a management role. He wanted to play the governor, and I wanted to play the investor role.\nGetting a chance to understand and know the vision of the team, I think it’s having success because we’re in a reload of losing Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, and coach Quin (Snyder). We brought in a new coach in Will Hardy, Danny Ainge, and Ryan as a new governor. Everything is new, and you have to have patience. You have to be patient in your rebuild. I think that’s what the Jazz have been doing while trying to build a culture and put together an organization that practices a championship mindset from the top and eventually trickles down to the players.\nIt’s a slow burn. It’s a slow build. But you’ve got to be in this for the long haul. You don’t just walk into this and win championships and be successful. I think we’re all seeing that together. We’ve got a great leader in Ryan, a great leader in Danny, and a great leader in Will.\nI don’t have to do much. I just put my two cents in here and there where I feel like it’s needed. I’m also in a space where I get to learn anytime I want to about the game and so much about the business. It’s been an unbelievable relationship and partnership for me.\nSince you talked more about being in an investor phase of your life, you also invest in the Chicago Sky, so considering that would you also consider a minority stake in the Chicago Bulls if the opportunity was ever presented to you?\nDW: I appreciate you said that. I don’t know. I never thought I’d have a minority stake in the Utah Jazz. That wasn’t something that was on my to-do list when I retired from the game of basketball. When it comes to the Chicago Sky, it was a really cool opportunity the year before the reemergence of the WNBA. I got in early as an investor in the league and to support our women by showing up to games. We all want to see this game grow. I took it a step further because I’m in this space where I got an opportunity to invest in a team that I was there from where I was born in Chicago.\nI’m on the advisory board when I decide to call in and when you’re at this level of investing. It’s a good place for me to be because it’s all an opportunity for me. I don’t go to school anymore. I’m not in class. I’m learning about business through sports. It’s a great opportunity for me to do that.\nAre you surprised by LeBron James' longevity at 40 years old?\nDW: I think we all are. It’s no secret all of us are amazed. We haven’t seen an athlete in basketball do this. We watched Tom Brady still be dominant in football when he reached 40, but it’s not something we’ve seen in basketball at this level. We’ve seen people play into their 40s or 20th year in the league, but we haven’t seen this level of dominance where some nights you watch him, and you don’t see a dropoff at all. There are some nights you watch him, and he looks like the same guy you watched in 2003 on occasion. It’s impressive. It’s strengthened his personal case for the conversation of one of the greatest to ever play the game of basketball because his career is unique to just him. It’s not like anyone else’s. That’s why the conversation is so heavy.\nI’m surprised because you wouldn’t think a guy who’s athletic is going to still be this athletic and not go through athletic things like surgeries or a lot of major injuries. I think most importantly, besides his body, which has been incredible for him, he’s one of the sharpest minds I’ve ever been around. He’s able to continue to show how great his mind is. I want to enjoy it for however long he’s going to play the game of basketball. I want to be a fan and sit there and enjoy each opportunity that I can because one day, he won’t be dribbling a basketball, and we’re going to miss the greatness of him like we miss the greatness of Michael Jordan, like the greatness of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, like the greatness of Bill Russell, and so on. I’m just trying to appreciate this man’s greatness, and I think everybody needs to.\nDo you feel responsible for the \"superteam\" trend after you got LeBron James and Chris Bosh to join you in Miami?\nDW: Not responsible for a superteam. Maybe responsible for players getting together and making a decision. I don’t know what was done that preceded us. We definitely watched Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, and Dennis Rodman. We definitely watched Magic Johnson play with many great Hall of Fame players. We watched Larry Bird, Robert Parish, Kevin McHale, and so forth. We’ve seen it before.\nI think we did it in the time of social media and in a time that normally, from what it looked like from afar, organizations were the ones making the trades and the moves to bring these superteams together. We did it at a time when it was controversial because it was players deciding to do it in the middle of their primes. You see guys getting together a little older sometimes.\nYou feel responsible for players understanding their power. Even though I’m on this side of it now, I still love to see players understand their power. How you utilize it is on you when it comes to good or bad, but at least you understand it. I didn’t understand that we had any power when I first came in. The organizations usually did all the things, and you just hope for the best. We kind of changed that a little bit in this generation, but I can’t say we were the first ones to do that.\nI don’t feel responsible for superteams. The league has had that throughout.\nYou have a lot of strong ties to the Miami Heat and Pat Riley, and you’re also a friend of Jimmy Butler. What did you think of how the Jimmy Butler situation ended in Miami?\nDW: I didn’t like it. I think I was very open about that on my Timeout show. I was very open about me not liking the stain that it continues to put on my organization. It’s no secret about it. But also, I don’t point any fingers and say this person or that person is in the wrong. I don’t know. I wasn't there. I’m not invested and involved like that. I have the statue out front. I am the person who was chosen to be the guy in a sense when it comes to this organization. I’m always going to support and always be a phone call away for the conversations that need to be had for the organization for a player and give them what I can about information when it comes to how to handle things. But ultimately, they’re going to do what they want to do. It was a bad stain on our organization, but we move on.\nI think Jimmy is happy where he is. I think Miami is happy in the post-Jimmy era from the standpoint that six years is over, and it was great. Now, they can move forward with their future. Unfortunately, it needed to happen. I wish the divorce could’ve been better.\nYou can follow Michael Scotto (@MikeAScotto) on X, formerly known as Twitter.",
