  "body_text": "Good morning. Ministers for disabled people are the opposite of buses: there were 11 in the UK in 13 years before 7 December, and then, suddenly, there wasn’t one at all.\nThe previous incumbent, Tom Pursglove, had been moved on to deal with reducing legal migration, a job the government considers more important than the circumstances of the UK’s 16 million disabled people; Rishi Sunak either didn’t think he needed to be replaced, or forgot about it. Only after the story gained traction at the end of last week was a new minister finally appointed – at a more junior level than her predecessor.\nAll of this is shocking, but not that surprising to anyone who has followed disability rights in the UK since 2010. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Frances Ryan, a Guardian columnist and author of Crippled: Austerity and the Demonization of Disabled People, about the abandoned portfolio, the government’s record on disability, and what the new minister, Mims Davies, needs to do differently. Here are the headlines.\nFive big stories\n-\nIsrael-Gaza war | Airstrikes in the Gaza Strip have killed at least 100 people over the last 24 hours, as Israel’s leadership faces growing international pressure for a ceasefire and calls at home to resume hostage negotiations after the Israeli army shot and killed three men kidnapped by Hamas.\n-\nUK news | The former Conservative peer Michelle Mone has admitted that she lied to the media about her involvement with a company that made millions in profits from UK government PPE deals. Mone said that she “wasn’t trying to pull the wool over anyone’s eyes” when she lied about her involvement in PPE Medpro, uncovered by the Guardian. Read an explainer on the story.\n-\nWomen’s health | A “gamechanging” drug that prevents hot flushes and could benefit hundreds of thousands of women has been approved for use in the UK. The green light for Veoza, also known as fezolinetant, comes after the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, authorised it for use in America in May.\n-\nImmigration and asylum | Multinational families threatened with division or exile by tough new income thresholds for living together in the UK are planning legal action to overturn the “cruel and inhumane” policy. A support group for families that may be split up by the new rules has instructed lawyers to explore a challenge to the scheme.\n-\nSchools | Teachers in England will not be made to automatically “out” pupils who come to them with questions over gender identity, despite a push from Conservative rightwingers for a blanket approach, government guidance due to be published this week will say.\nIn depth: ‘They are only interested in disabled people as far as they can push them into work’\nThe government might have thought it had solved its staffing problem with the appointment of Mims Davies, but nobody else who was paying attention did. Instead of being devoted to her brief, Davies will be doing the job alongside her old role on social mobility, and is less senior than Pursglove, who was a minister of state: instead, she is at the most junior governmental rank, of parliamentary under secretary of state. Disabled people, in short, have been demoted.\nThe prime minister’s official spokesman said that the government is continuing to show “strong support for disabled people and for disabled issues”. Frances Ryan is unconvinced. “The government have created jobs covering Brexit, Levelling Up, and now an extra immigration minister because they wanted to signal to the electorate that these issues matter. So what are they saying about disability? I think the message is very clear.”\nWhy the minister matters\nMinisterial churn has been a constant problem across the government over the last 13 years, and particularly over the term of the chaotic 2019 parliament, during which three prime ministers have executed myriad reshuffles in the hope of solving their immediate political problems. The disability brief is a particularly severe case. The seniority of the role has gone up and down six times since 2010; the average time in post is 414 days.\nThis matters in any department. In 2020, the Institute for Government published a paper which argued in vain that “constant change undermines good government” because ministers “lack the expertise they need to do their jobs effectively and are unable to see policies through to results”.\nThe disability portfolio has additional problems. There is also a sense that many of the responsibilities that it might be expected to cover on behalf of a quarter of the population are instead divided among other departments, leaving the specific role largely focused on managing benefits. Instead of advocating for disabled people and thinking about what they need in the round, the job appears to be about policing them.\n“When government works well, a dedicated minister who knows the brief is ideal,” Frances said. Given the degree of churn and the government’s wider record, she added, “I don’t think anyone believes having a dedicated minister would actually help improve the lives of disabled people. But not having one does tell voters very clearly what the government’s priorities are.”\nWho the minister should be\nAnother striking feature of the appointment of Davies is that she is yet another person to take the job who doesn’t have a disability herself. Davies noted that her father had a head injury for 25 years, that the subject was “a passion”, and that she “gets it”. It is not a prerequisite for effective governance for the minister to have direct individual experience of their portfolio’s impact; on the other hand, it is hard to imagine a man successfully defending his appointment as minister for women by pointing out that his mother was one.\n“Disabled people are the largest minority in the country,” Frances said. “When people aren’t physically represented, their interests are a lot less likely to be advocated for. Whereas if you’ve had direct experience of applying for disability benefits or social care or waiting on NHS long term care, you’re in a much better position as a politician to understand and fight for these issues.”\nThis is as much a problem with the available pool as with the specific selection of Davies: as well as being the largest minority in the UK, Frances points out, disabled people are also the most unrepresented in parliament. “There’s barely a handful of MPs with disclosed disabilities,” she said – only five were elected in 2019, and just two of them were Conservative. Depending on the definition of disability you use, the representative figure would be between 65 and 130.\n“That’s insulting but it’s also damaging for society. We wouldn’t accept male MPs running a reproductive health committee anymore. Why should solely non-disabled politicians speak for the disabled community?”\nThe government’s record\nAll of this might be easier to take for disabled people if it wasn’t set against a policy backdrop that many view as fundamentally hostile to their rights. Under austerity, Frances said, disabled people have been particularly severely affected because “we’re more likely to rely on multiple parts of the state: from social security to the NHS to local councils for social care and emergency welfare. When tens of billions of pounds were pulled from multiple areas of the safety net over a decade, as a result, many disabled people had life as they knew it pulled away.”\nSet that alongside the experience of the pandemic, when, a barrister for four national disabled people’s organisations told the Covid inquiry last week, “in fundamental ways disabled people were left without protection”. One of Mims Davies’ predecessors, Justin Tomlinson, was asked whether there was a cross-government plan for disabled people in place. No, he told the inquiry: “It’s included in all of the wider government actions.”\nAgain, barrister Danny Friedman KC said, the problem was with the ministerial brief, which did not have the seniority or focus to do the job properly: “Justin Tomlinson was not a lead minister for disabled people, he was in effect a minister for disability benefits who did some front-of-house meetings with disabled groups.”\nWhat the new minister needs to do to change the tone\nMims Davies has a job on her hands to persuade disabled people that she will be an effective advocate for their interests, or a fair judge of where the state’s resources are most needed.\nShe is working against a backdrop of longstanding rhetorical hostility: for years, the government has made hay from casting people with long term health conditions as potential “shirkers”. “It has been a relentless 13 years for many people in this country and they are now poorer, sicker, and less secure for it,” Frances said.\nIn 2012 George Osborne made a speech about shift workers who see “the closed blinds of their next door neighbour sleeping off a life on benefits”. This year, the government has tightened up the way the work capability assessment operates, which the IFS says will cost some people previously judged unable to work almost £400 a month. Rishi Sunak made the policy a feature of his speech to Conservative conference, saying that the status quo is “not fair on taxpayers who have to pick up the bill”. It’s less than a month since chief secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott said people with disabilities have a “duty” to “work and contribute” and added: “if you don’t do this, we will look at sanctions”.\nDavies has been appointed as minister for “disabled people, health and work” – and that last word might be a clue as to how the role is seen within government. Given the changes to the work capability assessment, “the government have made very clear they are only interested in disabled people as far as they can push them into the labour market,” Frances said. “If the Conservatives want to rebuild some trust with disabled voters, they should start talking about disabled people like they’re human beings and not economic units or drains on the public purse. I can’t say that is too much to ask.”\nWhat else we’ve been reading\n-\nVictoria Clarke tells Tim Jonze about life with Shane MacGowan, who could be both romantic, and also mean; his lifestyle “simultaneously thrilling and terrifying”. While he was undoubtedly a creative genius, she says, “We were living very much on the edge of some kind of actual destruction.” Clare Longrigg, acting editor, Newsletters\n-\nIn Gaza, writes Nesrine Malik, the horrors of death and displacement are accompanied by the erasure of culture, academia, and history. It is, she writes, a process of “voiding the architecture of belonging … so that, no matter how many Gazans survive, there is, over time, less and less to bind them together into a valid whole”.

Kate Muir burns through the myths and gives us the science about how costly ineffective treatment could be improved for millions. Clare\n-\nZoe Williams’ interview with Toby Jones for Saturday magazine captures a sometimes underrated talent who is also unbelievably likable. “For people who have worked with him, the top line is always that he’s a genius,” she writes. “But the first thing you notice when you meet him is that he’s incredibly nice.” Archie\n-\nThe government promised to ban infamous “no fault” evictions but they are still being used to turn tenants out. Chaminda Jayanetti spent the day in county court with the duty solicitor, to witness the legal maze tenants must navigate to hold on to their homes. Clare\nSport\nFootball | A defiant Manchester United side became the first team to stop Liverpool winning at Anfield this season as they held out out for a 0-0 draw. Jonathan Liew wrote that “United basically gave up on pressing after about half an hour and simply dug themselves a trench”. Meanwhile, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus led Arsenal to a 2-0 win over Brighton at the Emirates, and a late winner from Ollie Watkins sealed a 2-1 comeback for Aston Villa at Brentford.\nRugby union | Harlequins were hammered 47-19 by Toulouse in the Champions Cup, led by a ruthless Antoine Dupont and second row Emmanuel Meafou, who was named man of the match. Meanwhile, Exeter pulled off a remarkable turnaround victory against Munster, coming back from 24-13 down to win 32-24, and Leicester withstood late pressure to seal a battling 27-24 victory at Stade Français.\nFootball | Tom Lockyer remained in hospital undergoing tests and scans on Sunday following the Luton Town captain’s on-field collapse during Saturday’s Premier League match with Bournemouth. Lockyer, who suffered a cardiac arrest, was said by the club to be “awaiting the results before the next steps for his recovery are determined”.\nThe front pages\nOn the Guardian front page the headline is “Mone admits lying to media over links to firm in PPE deals scandal”. The story covers the former Conservative peer’s admission on the BBC with a picture from the interview. It’s also on the i’s front page, which says “‘I lied about Covid deal but have done nothing wrong’”. The Telegraph has “Israel risks breaking law with its ‘killing rage’, says Wallace”, headlining on comments from the former defence secretary, Ben Wallace. The Financial Times covers Ukraine with “IMF warns Ukraine economy in peril if allies do not speed up extra funding”. The Times says “3,000 ward admissions a day linked to obesity”. The paper says admissions have doubled in six years according to NHS figures.\nThe Mirror has “Reindeer horror” on its front page as it says a company has sparked fury by selling reindeer-shooting hunts. In the Daily Mail it’s “Esther wages war on woke” as the cabinet minister Esther McVey writes in the paper that she will fight against money being spent on equality consultants. And in the Sun it’s “Farage shock at drugs raid” as the paper alleges the parents of his daughter’s boyfriend were arrested.\nToday in Focus\nThe Barclays and the battle for the Telegraph\nThe Barclay family may still legally own the newspaper titles, but politicians alongside some of the world’s richest men are contesting who will control them in the future.
