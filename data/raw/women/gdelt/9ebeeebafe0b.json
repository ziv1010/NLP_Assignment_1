(KCTV) - The Kansas City Current signed Alabama’s all-time leading scorer to a 3-year contract.\nThe team announced on Friday, Dec. 26, that Gianna Paul, a 2-time United Soccer Coaches All-American, will join the Current through the 2028 season with a club option for 2029.\nClub leaders said Paul is expected to report to Kansas City ahead of preseason training.\nRecord-Breaking College Carrer\nAccording to the Current, Paul left Alabama as the program’s all-time leader with 40 goals and 94 points during her 4-year career. She ranked 5th nationally among active Division I players in career goals and 8th in career points at the end of the 2025 season.\nThe New York native also set Alabama records with 279 shots and 115 shots on target, the team said. She totaled 9 game-winning goals, 5 of which came in 2023, to lead the Southeastern Conference.\nAs a senior, the Current indicated that Paul led the team with 12 goals and 31 points, breaking the school’s 20-year-old career goals record. She also topped the roster with 12 goals and 25 points in 2024, and 9 goals and 17 points in 2023.\nThe Current noted that her 8 goals as a freshman in 2022 tied for 10th nationally among 1st year\nHistoric Accolades\nClub leaders indicated that Paul became the first player in Alabama history to earn 2-time All-American honors, receiving United Soccer Coaches Fourth Team All-American selections in both 2024 and 2025.\nPaul was named SEC Freshman of the Year in 2022 and earned All-SEC First Team honors for 3 straight years. Paul is the first player in school history to be a 5-time All-SEC honoree and collected 4 Player of the Week awards in her career.\nAccording to the Club, Paul also landed on the U.S. Soccer Coaches All-Southeast Region First Team in2023 and 2024 before she earned second-team recognition as a senior.\nTeam Success\nThe Current said Paul helped lead the Crimson Tide to NCAA Tournament berths in 3 of her 4 seasons, including the program’s first trip to the College Cup in 2022 as a No. 1 overall seed.\nAlabama won the 2022 SEC regular season title with an undefeated 10-0 conference record and finished as SEC Tournament runner-up that year, club leaders indicated.\nThe forward was also called up to U.S. Youth National Team training camps at the Under-19/U-18 level ahead of the 2023 Concacaf Women’s U-20 Championship.\nWhat They’re Saying\n“Gianna is a dynamic forward who is skilled technically and tactically,” said general manager Ryan Dell. “She had a remarkable collegiate career at Alabama, where she rewrote the record book, and we’re confident she’ll use that experience as a springboard to a successful pro career. She has progressed each season and we know she will continue to develop with our world-class technical staff. We couldn’t be happier to have Gianna in Kansas City for the next three years.”\nPaul expressed excitement about joining the Current: “Since I was a little girl, I had always dreamed about playing professional soccer,” said Paul. “To say that that is my current reality will never feel short of surreal. I feel honored, blessed and overwhelmingly humbled to be accepted with warm arms and enthusiasm into such an incredible program, such as Kansas City. The love they have for the sport of women’s football can be felt across the world and to be a small part of that history means everything to me.”\nShe also thanked her mother for her sacrifices.\n“Additionally, my mother’s decade worth of sacrifices has made me into the woman and player I am today. Quite literally, none of this would be possible with her,” Paul concluded. “I’m grateful for the journey and ready for this next chapter with the Kansas City Current—let’s get to work!”\nRoster Moves\nThe Current announced earlier in December that goalkeeper Tyler McCamey, defender Regan Steigleder and forward Alex Pfeiffer will not return to the team in 2026.\nLooking Ahead\nThe signing follows a disappointing end to the 2025 season. The top-seeded Kansas City Current suffered a stunning 2-1 overtime loss to No. 8 seed Gotham FC in the NWSL Quarterfinals at CPKC Stadium.\nThe Current finished the season with 21 wins, 2 draws and 3 losses across 26 matches.\nPaul’s addition signals the team’s commitment to reloading for another championship run in 2026.\nCopyright 2025 KCTV.
