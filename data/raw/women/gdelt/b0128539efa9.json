Each group's vote counted for 25%.\nReal Madrid were already in Qatar for Wednesday's Fifa Intercontinental Cup final against Mexican side Pachuca at Lusail Stadium.\nLatest Stories\n-\n‘Behind The Lens with Queen Liz’ explores the true meaning of Valentine’s Day, Love, Lust or Legacy?\n6 seconds -\n‘I wanted to be an architect but ended up as a nurse’ – Diana Hamilton reveals\n50 minutes -\nFrom wards to worship: Diana Hamilton reveals how nursing school shaped her destiny\n1 hour -\nMahama demands binding deadlines for African reparations\n2 hours -\nThis is not the time to settle political scores – Bawumia to government\n3 hours -\n5 definitive Valentine’s Day gifts to win your lover’s heart in Ghana\n3 hours -\n37% of SHS students exposed to drugs – Opare-Addo\n3 hours -\nNLC secures court injunction against striking tertiary unions\n4 hours -\nOSP says it remains guided by law after INTERPOL deletes Ofori-Atta’s Red Notice\n4 hours -\nWaiting in the Ring: life inside Bukom’s halted boxing scene\n4 hours -\nRed Notice cancellation: OSP official fires back at Ofori-Atta’s lawyers\n5 hours -\nOfori-Atta saga: Red Notice ends after arrest – OSP official clarifies\n5 hours -\nAAG raises alarm over billboard demolitions, calls for presidential intervention\n6 hours -\nHealth Minister to chair probe into ‘No Bed Syndrome’ death; promises system overhaul\n6 hours -\nPrime Insight to tackle ‘galamsey tax’ debate, cocoa reforms and Ayawaso East fallout this Saturday\n6 hours",
