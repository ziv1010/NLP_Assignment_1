  "body_text": "In FY 2025, the EEOC entered a period of sweeping change that reshaped its priorities and approach.Following the inauguration of President Donald Trump for his second term, the new administration took aseries of swift actions that had a significant impact on EEOC leadership and enforcement. First, PresidentTrump elevated Commissioner Andrea R. Lucas to Acting Chair, a standard exercise of executive prerogative.Next, he terminated EEOC General Counsel Karla Gilbride, following precedent set by President Biden,who had terminated the previous EEOC General Counsel, a Trump nominee, shortly after taking office.\nThen in an action without precedent, President Trump fired two Democratic Commissioners, CharlotteBurrows and Jocelyn Samuels. Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which created the EEOC,Commissioners serve for fixed five-year terms, and there is no provision to remove a Commissioner “forcause.” The unprecedented firings ended a Democratic majority that was poised to continue until atleast mid-2026 and left the Commission with only two members—Acting Chair Lucas and DemocraticCommissioner Kalpana Kotagal.With only two Commissioners for most of 2025, the EEOC lacked a quorum, limiting its authority to act infurtherance of its statutory duties and to pursue the priorities set by the Trump Administration and ActingChair Lucas. For example, without a quorum, the Acting Chair may revoke or revise technical assistancedocuments 1 issued under the authority of prior Chairs, but cannot rescind formal guidance previouslyissued with majority approval from a validly constituted quorum of Commissioners, such as the EEOC’sEnforcement Guidance on Harassment in the Workplace 2 or Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) rules.3Similarly, during 2025 litigation was curtailed without a quorum but not halted. The rules in place throughout2025 required the Commission itself to authorize the initiation of certain new lawsuits, while the EEOCGeneral Counsel was responsible for “conducting” EEOC litigation. Since the termination of General CounselGilbride, the EEOC’s General Counsel role has been filled on a temporary basis pursuant to the FederalVacancies Reform Act. Regular litigation and investigations are conducted by EEOC career staff, who continuethe day-to-day activity of the agency unless and until further action is taken.Under a delegation of litigation authority adopted in January 2021 and in effect until January 2026, somecategories of litigation required approval by a majority of Commissioners while others were left to thediscretion of the General Counsel.4 Under this framework, Commissioners were required to vote to approvethe following categories of litigation: recommendations for the Commission to file an amicus brief; casesalleging systemic discrimination or “pattern-or-practice” discrimination; cases requiring major expenditureof agency resources; cases taking positions contrary to Circuit precedent; and cases presenting novelor unsettled legal issues likely to generate public controversy. All other litigation could be brought by theGeneral Counsel without prior approval.The absence of a quorum for most of 2025 is reflected in the EEOC’s litigation: just 93 lawsuits were filed inFY 2025 (a record low), and the vast majority of them (about 75%) were filed on behalf of just one individualand without seeking to change the law.1 U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, EEOC Guidance, https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc-guidance.2 U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Enforcement Guidance on Harassment in the Workplace, https://web.archive.org/web/20260120031142/https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-harassment-workplace.

On July31, 2025, the Senate confirmed then-Acting Chair Lucas to an additional term as Commissioner throughJuly 1, 2030. On November 6, 2025, Lucas was designated Chair. Lucas has repeatedly articulated hercontinued alignment with the Trump Administration’s priorities. On October 7, 2025, the Senate confirmedBrittany Panuccio as the third Commissioner of the EEOC, restoring the EEOC’s quorum and establishinga Republican majority. On November 19, 2025, President Trump submitted to the Senate his nominee forGeneral Counsel at the EEOC, naming M. Carter Crow, a management-side lawyer currently working as theGlobal Head of Employment and Labor for law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. With these personnel changes,we can expect to see the EEOC’s rule-making, investigation, and litigation priorities to stay centered aroundthe Trump administration’s stated goals, which include ending DEI practices, favoring workers of Americannational origin, prioritizing accommodation of religious beliefs and opposing harassment based on religion,and particularly antisemitism, and defending a binary view of sex and related rights.Indeed, some noteworthy changes already have begun. On January 14, 2026, in its first public meeting ofthe Commission after the quorum was restored, Chair Lucas and Commissioner Panuccio voted to rescindvoting procedures enacted in the final weeks of the Biden Administration, giving the Chair sole authorityto set the agenda and dates for public meetings and to decide what issues will be voted on without a publicmeeting. On January 22, 2026, the Commission met again. During this meeting, the litigation delegationrules were changed by a 2-1 vote. Under the new rules, approval by a majority of Commissioners is requiredfor substantially all litigation. The Commission also voted to rescind the 2024 Enforcement Guidance onHarassment in the Workplace, with the document removed from the agency’s website before the end ofthe day.B. EEOC Recent Staffing Challenges and Budgetary ConstraintsTitle VII confers on the EEOC’s Chair the sole responsibility “for the administrative operations of theCommission.” 5 The Chair is responsible for hiring members of the career Senior Executive Service, andevaluating and managing the EEOC’s cadre of Senior Executives. In other words, the Chair is directlyresponsible for hiring and evaluating the performance of the 15 District Directors across the country, aswell as other Senior Executives in the agency. Moreover, the Chair’s responsibility for the “administrativeoperations” of the EEOC includes the ability, exercised through the EEOC’s Chief Operating Officer, toallocate the EEOC’s budget to its various programs and operational efforts. While the Commission as awhole must vote on certain appropriations, the Chair has broad authority in making adjustments—bothlarge and small—to how the Commission spends its money.Chair Lucas and her staff are responsible for advocating before Congress for changes to the EEOC’s budget,and the Chair is also responsible for deciding exactly how the EEOC spends additional money appropriatedby Congress. During the early years of the Biden Administration, the EEOC sought and received significantbudget increases, which it invested in hiring front-line enforcement and litigation personnel. In more recentyears, budget pressures have left the EEOC with less to work with.In FY 2023, the EEOC received $455 million in funding. For the following year, the EEOC sought a 5.7%increase, but Congress declined the request and held the EEOC’s budget at the previous year’s amount.This put the EEOC in a bind, as President Biden had earlier issued an executive order that granted federalemployees a 5.2% pay raise, and pay and benefits already were the agency’s largest expense (74% of theEEOC’s budget). The mandated pay increase still had to be covered despite that the agency budget allocationremained flat, leading Chair Burrows to implement multiple fiscal austerity measures, including reducedhiring and cuts to various programs like reduced travel and training, and narrowly avoiding a furlough.The fiscal constraints continued into FY 2025. The EEOC again requested a budget increase, this time to$488 million, and Congress once again declined the request and held the EEOC’s budget at the same levelas FY 2023.5 See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-43 | EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION ©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLPUnder Chair Lucas, this trend changed, though perhaps not in the way expected. For FY 2026, theCommission actually scaled back its budget request to $435 million. This reduced number signals thatthe Commission will look to slash programs and headcount under President Trump’s secondadministration and new EEOC leadership.C. EEOC ProfilesKalpana Kotagal(Commissioner, Democrat)Kalpana Kotagal joined the EEOC on August 9, 2023, and her term expiresJuly 1, 2027.

The EEOClacked the quorum needed to change these documents in FY 2025. However, as discussed further, howthese priorities are interpreted, and the vigor of enforcement efforts has changed significantly.1 Eliminating Barriers InRecruitment and Hiring 4 Advancing Equal Payfor All Workers2 Protecting VulnerableWorkers and Persons fromUnderserved Communities 5 Preserving Access to theLegal System3 Addressing Selected Emergingand Developing Issues 6 Preventing and RemedyingSystemic HarassmentA. EEOC’s FY 2026 Cornerstone Documents1. BackgroundThe EEOC identifies its enforcement priorities in its Strategic Enforcement Plan (“SEP”). Along withthe SEP, the EEOC also outlines its enforcement strategies through its Strategic Plan.6 Despite thesimilarity in their titles, these plan documents serve two distinct purposes. The SEP lays out theCommission’s specific priorities by highlighting certain areas of law or groups of workers that it willaim to address over the next four years. The Strategic Plan describes how the EEOC will achieve itsstrategic mission, including executing on the priorities contained in the SEP. In the words of theEEOC, the Strategic Plan “establishes a framework for achieving the EEOC’s mission to ‘prevent andremedy unlawful employment discrimination and advance equal employment opportunity for all.’” The EEOC unveiled its first SEP more than a decade ago in December 2012, stating that the plan“established substantive area priorities and set forth strategies to integrate all components ofEEOC’s private, public, and federal sector enforcement to have a sustainable impact in advancing equalopportunity and freedom from discrimination in the workplace.” According to the EEOC “the purposeof the [SEP] is to focus and coordinate the EEOC’s programs to have a sustainable impact in reducingand deterring discriminatory practices in the workplace.” The Commission’s six major enforcementpriorities have remained relatively consistent across multiple iterations of the SEP. But the EEOC canand has changed how it interprets those priorities over the life of those documents. Moreover, theSEP does not fully constrain the agency in terms of what it actually enforces. The EEOC is not legallybound to strictly enforce the priorities set forth in its SEP, and the EEOC can still pursue cases thatit deems important outside of these priorities. These realities have often led to shifts in how theEEOC approaches litigation and the topics and issues it chooses to enforce in the federal courts.6 See Christopher DeGroff, James Nasiri, and Rachel See, EEOC Adopts 2022-2026 Strategic Plan With an Emphasis on Large-Scale Litigation,Improving Internal EEOC Processes, Workplace Class Action Blog (Aug. 23, 2023), https://www.workplaceclassaction.com/2023/08/eeoc-adopts2022-2026-strategic-plan-with-an-emphasis-on-large-scale-litigation-improving-internal-eeoc-processes/.©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLP EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION | 6The EEOC released its current SEP on September 21, 2023, when the agency was still under Democraticleadership, to cover fiscal years 2024-2028.7 It may only be revised or withdrawn by a majority vote ofthe Commission operating with a quorum, a fact that is pointedly highlighted at the top the webpagethat hosts the information since soon after the Trump administration began.8 While the documenthas not been formally changed, how the enforcement priorities are construed has changed in notableways. Moreover, now that the EEOC’s quorum has been restored under the Republican leadership ofChair Lucas, the agency is positioned to formally modify the 2024-2028 SEP, and likely will do so toreflect the new GOP majority’s strategic priorities. Indeed, when the current SEP was issued, thenCommissioner Lucas voted against it.9 She further made a point to note as Acting Chair that she couldnot unilaterally remove or modify documents such as the SEP based on her authority in that capacity.10The new quorum may change the existing SEP’s focus areas in significant ways to align with the actualenforcement trends, such as by shifting away from protecting certain groups such as immigrantworkers and toward addressing alleged employment practices that favor non-American workers overAmerican workers, potentially resulting in an updated version of the document that looks quite differentthan it does today.2. Particular FY 2026 Strategic Enforcement PrioritiesThe EEOC’s current SEP is focused on six different strategic enforcement priorities: (1) eliminatingbarriers in recruitment and hiring; (2) protecting vulnerable workers from underserved communities;(3) addressing selected emerging and developing issues; (4) advancing equal pay for all workers; (5)preserving access to the legal system; and (6) preventing and remedying systemic harassment.Importantly, these priorities are not mutually exclusive. The interpretation of those priorities haschanged under the Trump administration, sometimes in dramatic fashion.Eliminating Barriers In Recruitment and Hiring. The first strategic enforcement priority iseliminating barriers in recruitment and hiring. The EEOC’s focus within this priority has been toaddress recruiting and hiring practices that “discriminate on any basis unlawful under the statutesEEOC enforces, including sex, race, national origin, color, religion, age, and disability.” The EEOC hasspent a considerable amount of its enforcement budget litigating issues that it sees as barriers torecruitment and hiring. In recent years, there have been a number of judicial decisions involving theEEOC’s attempts to combat discrimination, including the use of pre-employment screening tests.The FY 2024-2028 SEP added far more detail about the types of hiring practices and policies to bescrutinized. For example, prior SEPs described the EEOC’s intention to prevent steering membersof protected groups into specific (often less desirable) jobs. The FY 2024-2028 SEP goes further toexplain that the EEOC also will be examining whether employers are segregating workers in jobs, orby job duties, based on membership in a protected group. Other areas of focus include examiningpractices that may limit access to work opportunities, such as advertising jobs in a manner thatexcludes or discourages some protected groups from applying, or denying training, internships, orapprenticeships; scrutinizing whether employers are denying opportunities to move from temporaryto permanent roles, including when permanent positions are available; and investigating whetheradverse impact results from the use of technology, AI, and machine learning used in job advertisements,recruiting, and hiring decisions.The EEOC has, historically, focused on recruiting and hiring in part because private plaintiffs’ counselhave been unwilling to champion large scale hiring cases due to cost and challenges identifying potentialvictims. In particular, the EEOC has scrutinized recruiting and hiring processes to determine whether7 U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Press Release: EEOC Releases Strategic Enforcement Plan (Sept. 21, 2023), https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-releases-strategic-enforcement-plan.8 U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Strategic Enforcement Plan Fiscal Years 2024 - 2028, https://www.eeoc.gov/strategicenforcement-plan-fiscal-years-2024-2028 (“This Strategic Enforcement Plan was approved by the Commission on September 18, 2023, by a 3-2 vote.Modification requires a vote of the Commission.”),9 U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Press Release: Removing Gender Ideology and Restoring the EEOC’s Role of Protecting Women inthe Workplace (Jan. 28, 2025), eeoc.gov/newsroom/removing-gender-ideology-and-restoring-eeocs-role-protecting-women-workplace.10 Id.7 | EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION ©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLPthey are carried out in a way that may result in discrimination against certain groups of individuals,often pursuant to a disparate impact theory of liability. This approach changed with the signingof Executive Order 14281, which directs all federal agencies to deprioritize enforcement of claimspredicated on a disparate impact theory of liability. Indeed, the Executive Order declares, “It is thepolicy of the United States to eliminate the use of disparate-impact liability in all contexts to themaximum degree possible,” in a dramatic shift away from a key theory the EEOC relied on historicallyto attack recruiting and hiring issues.11 In a May 20, 2025 press release, Chair Lucas stated that theEEOC will not pursue investigations or litigation that challenge neutral practices that have unequaloutcomes based on protected characteristics pursuant to EO 14281.12 This removes a significant toolfrom the EEOC’s arsenal.The EEOC has also in the SEP called out “continued underrepresentation” of women and workers ofcolor in certain industries, naming construction and manufacturing, high tech, STEM, and finance inparticular, and indicated its intent to monitor those benefiting from substantial federal investment.This approach by the agency also is likely to end, as it disclaims the notion that discrimination can bedetermined by looking at group outcomes.Protecting Vulnerable Workers from Underserved Communities. The second strategic enforcementpriority is aimed at combatting policies and practices that impact “particularly vulnerable workers.”For purposes of the SEP, the EEOC has traditionally viewed “vulnerable workers” as those who may beunaware of their rights under equal employment opportunity laws, or reluctant or unable to exercisethose rights. The EEOC’s FY 2024-2028 SEP, in a change from prior versions of the SEP, called out 11different categories of vulnerable workers:11 Exec. Order No. 14281, Restoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy, 90 FR 17537 (2025).12 Message from EEOC Acting Chair Lucas about Opening of 2024 EEO-1 Component Data Collection, (May 20, 2025), https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USEEOC/bulletins/3e1407f.13 EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas (X, Dec. 17, 2025), x.com/andrealucaseeoc/status/2001439099907961012?s=46; (LinkedIn, Dec. 17, 2025),https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrea-lucas-a5b27513_eeoc-eeo-dei-activity-7407229146071793664-xjBF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAF-8VABEzz0MbGPND0fxustjLgniQTy4BE;• immigrant and migrant workers;• individuals employed in low wage jobs and/ortheir first jobs, including teenage workers;• individuals with arrest or conviction records;• LGBTQI+ individuals;• Native Americans/Alaska Natives;• older workers;• people with developmental or intellectualdisabilities;• people with mental health relateddisabilities;• persons with limited literacy or Englishproficiency;• temporary workers; and• survivors of gender-based violence.Importantly, under the Trump administration, there has been a shift away from some of thesecategories, with the most notable examples being LGBTQI+ individuals and immigrant and migrantworkers. For example, the EEOC withdrew from pending litigation it had filed on behalf of individualswith claims based on gender identity, a topic that is discussed in more detail in Section A.9. Likewise,announcements and enforcement actions over the past year have instead decried discriminationagainst those of U.S. national origin where employers are said to favor foreign workers. Notably, onDecember 17, 2025, Chair Lucas posted a video on social media sites stating that white males whohave experienced discrimination at work based on their race or sex “may have a claim to recovermoney under federal civil rights laws” and inviting them to contact the agency “as soon as possible.”13These changes are discussed in more detail in Section C.©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLP EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION | 8Addressing Selected Emerging and Developing Issues. The third strategic priority addressesselected emerging and developing issues. As the name implies, the EEOC may adapt its focus withinthis priority on a year-to-year basis in accordance with developing case law and societal movements.Thus, this strategic priority is something of a “wild card.”As a government agency, the EEOC is responsible for monitoring trends and developments in the law,workplace practices, and labor force demographics. Not surprisingly, the emerging issues identified bythe agency have evolved over time. For example, the 2017 SEP identified five emerging and developingissues as strategic priorities: (1) qualification standards and inflexible leave policies that discriminateagainst individuals with disabilities; (2) accommodating pregnancy-related limitations under theAmericans with Disabilities Amendments Act and Pregnancy Discrimination Act; (3) protecting lesbian,gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBTQI+) individuals from discrimination based on sex; (4) clarifyingthe employment relationship and the application of workplace civil rights protections in light of theincreasing complexity of employment relationships and structures; and (5) addressing discriminatorypractices against those who are Muslim or Sikh, or persons of Arab, Middle Eastern or South Asiandescent, as well as persons perceived to be members of these groups, arising from backlash againstthem from tragic events in the United States and abroad.The FY 2024-2028 SEP moved away from some of the earlier categories and introduces some newemerging issues. For example, few issues had attracted as much of the EEOC’s attention in recentyears as its campaign to have LGBTQI+ discrimination recognized as a prohibited form of discriminationunder Title VII. That issue was answered by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2020 in the landmark decisionof Bostock v. Clayton County Georgia, which held that Title VII prohibits discrimination against gay ortransgender employees as a form of sex discrimination. Following that decision, the EEOC moved theissue off its list of emerging and developing issues, apparently believing it to have been fully embracedin the EEO universe. However, while that might have been the case then, the EEOC under now-ChairLucas has reversed course on these matters, including removing its interpretations applying Bostockto LGBTQ workers from its website.The SEP’s focus on protecting pregnant workers remains as an emerging issue. In FY 2025, the EEOCfiled numerous lawsuits asserting pregnancy-related violations. This emphasis on pregnancy-relatedissues aligns with public statements by Chair Lucas, who has placed an emphasis on enforcingprotections in this area. It is important to note, however, that the Commission under Chair Lucas’sleadership has narrowed the scope of pregnancy-related claims it is pursuing, focusing on claimsregarding pregnancy and childbirth rather than broader aspects of the female reproductive system.The EEOC’s actions in advancing this goal are addressed in more detail in Section B. Likewise, theSEP maintains its focus on “backlash” discrimination, premised on the idea that discrimination againstsome groups can arise as a backlash in response to local, national, or global events. The EEOCidentifies in the SEP some groups in particular, including Jews; Muslims; racial or ethnic groups; andLGBTQI+ individuals, but also notes that the groups at issue, and the practices they are subjectedto, can be0enforcement under this element of the SEP has largely been focused on combattingantisemitism. This is discussed in Section D.The final topic under this priority is “technology-related employment discrimination,” with the EEOC’sstated interest to be in employment decisions based on algorithmic decision-making, as well asautomated recruitment, selection, production, and performance management tools. The EEOC hasinstead deprioritized this issue over the past year, even removing earlier guidance documents on thetopic from its website.9 | EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION ©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLPAdvancing Equal Pay for All Workers. The fourth strategic priority is advancing enforcement of paydiscrimination laws, including the Equal Pay Act and Title VII. We cover the key focus areas relative tothis strategic priority in Part II(E).In the past, the EEOC’s primary focus has been combating discrimination in pay based on sex. TheFY 2024-2028 SEP revises this priority to make clearer that it intends to focus on pay discriminationbased on any protected category.The SEP departs from prior versions in two other notable ways. First, it includes a statement indicatingthat the EEOC will not depend on charges from members of the public, but will use its authority toinitiate directed investigations and Commissioner’s charges in order to facilitate enforcement. Second,the EEOC states its intent to challenge practices that it perceives may impede equal pay, or contributeto pay disparities, including secrecy policies, discouraging or prohibiting workers from sharing payinformation, and “reliance on past salary history or applicants’ salary expectations to set pay.”The partnership between the EEOC and the Department of Labor that was announced in 2023,provides the agency an additional source for information that could fuel investigations in this area.We cover the Memorandum of Understanding setting forth this partnership in Part II(A)(3).That said, the focus on equal pay appears at this time to be in name only, as enforcement actions areuncommon. In FY 2025, the EEOC did not file any complaints alleging violations of the Equal Pay Act.Preserving Access to the Legal System. The fifth strategic priority is preserving access to the legalsystem, and it is largely unchanged from the prior version on this topic. The focus within this priority ison policies or practices that discourage or prohibit individuals from exercising their rights, including anypolicies that deter or prohibit filing charges with the EEOC or cooperating freely in EEOC investigations,as well as, according to the EEOC, “overly broad waivers, releases, non-disclosure agreements, ornon-disparagement agreements,” failure to maintain applicant and employee data, and retaliatorypractices that dissuade employees from exercising their rights. This objective has historically beenreflected in the EEOC’s aggressive assertion of retaliation claims against employers allegedly obstructingemployees’ efforts to participate in EEOC proceedings or otherwise oppose discrimination. The EEOC’sEnforcement Guidance on Retaliation states that retaliation occurs when an employer takes a materiallyadverse action because an individual has engaged, or may engage, in protected activity that is infurtherance of Title VII, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with DisabilitiesAct, Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Equal Pay Act, or Title II of the Genetic InformationNondiscrimination Act. Retaliation claims premised on EEO-related activity are comprised of threeelements: (1) protected activity through “participation” in an EEO process or “opposition” todiscrimination; (2) materially adverse action taken by the employer; and (3) the requisite level of causalconnection between the protected activity and the materially adverse action.Of the 93 cases that were filed by the EEOC in FY 2025, 33 cases - or roughly 35% - involved retaliationallegations, signaling the EEOC’s continued interest in pursuing such claims and in turn, the interests ofemployees’ ability to pursue their rights under the anti-discrimination laws.In the past year, the EEOC has added a new course of action consistent with this section of the SEP:publishing guidance documents advising the public of their right to file certain types of charges. Forexample, in March 2025 the EEOC released a one page document titled “What To Do If You ExperienceDiscrimination Related to DEI at Work,” explaining what may constitute DEI-related discrimination, whocan be affected, and how to contact the EEOC to report such a claim.14 In November 2025, the EEOCreleased another one-page document titled “Discrimination Against American Workers Is Against TheLaw,” explaining different forms of potential discrimination against American workers and how to file acharge in the event of a violation.15 These topics are discussed further in Section C.2.14 https://www.eeoc.gov/what-do-if-you-experience-discrimination-related-dei-work.15 https://www.eeoc.gov/discrimination-against-american-workers-against-law.©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLP EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION | 10Preventing and Remedying Systemic Harassment. The sixth strategic priority is preventing andremedying systemic harassment, both in-person and online. This priority is directed at harassment,including sexual harassment and harassment based on sex, race, disability, age, national origin, religion,and color. This strategic priority will continue to focus on systemic cases. The EEOC views harassmentas an ongoing and serious issue in the U.S. workplace. The EEOC has had ample opportunity to shapethe law of sexual harassment through its litigation activities. Those cases often hinge on two issues:whether the alleged actions rise to the level of unlawful harassment, and whether an employer can beheld liable for harassment perpetrated by employees. In FY 2025, there was a total of 28 cases involvingharassment claims and 24 of those cases alleged sexual harassment. Additional information on thisstrategic priority and related case filings appears in Part II(G).Of note, the FY 2024-2028 SEP expressly calls out harassment based on pregnancy, gender identity, andsexual orientation. As noted above, while protections for pregnant workers has remained a priority underthis administration, issues related to gender identity and sexual orientation have been de‑prioritizedand in some instances abandoned entirely.Continued Reliance on Systemic Investigations and Litigation to Advance Strategic Goals. In theFY 2024-2028 SEP, the “Commission once again reaffirms its commitment to the agency’s systemicprogram.” The EEOC traditionally looks to its SEP priorities to decide what types of systemicinvestigations and cases to pursue. As discussed above, however, the EEOC’s actual enforcementtrends under the new administration have veered far from what is in the current written document,which itself is due for an overhaul now that the EEOC has a quorum. While FY 2025 was a quiet yearin terms of EEOC litigation, a close analysis of the EEOC’s strategic litigation decisions can helpemployers identify key compliance areas going forward. For instance, although the EEOC under theTrump administration is unlikely to pursue LGBTQI+-related litigation, the Commission remainsfocused on vigorously enforcing pregnancy and disability discrimination laws in the workplace.Lawsuits over workplace DEI programs are likely to be another priority.3. EEOC and Wage Hour Division Memorandum of UnderstandingOn September 13, 2023, the EEOC and the Department of Labor Wage Hour Division (WHD) enteredinto a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) enabling information sharing, joint investigations, training,and outreach.16 The MOU empowers the agencies’ field staff to coordinate efforts on both individualmatters and larger investigations.17The MOU’s information-sharing and other contemplated coordinated activity provisions cover a broadrange of activities, touching on all aspects of EEOC and WHD jurisdiction. For example, the MOU explicitlydescribes that each agency will make complaint referrals to the other, that the two will share complaintor investigative files, EEO-1 reports and FLSA records, and “statistical analyses or summaries,” and thatthe agencies “will explore ways to efficiently facilitate” the data sharing.Information sharing under the MOU is not limited to just top-level agency officials in Washington, DC;leadership from each agency’s District (or Regional) offices may request information without the needto first obtain approval from HQ in Washington, DC. Importantly, the EEOC District Directors andRegional Attorneys may also designate other EEOC employees to make the request. This means thatfront-line EEOC staff involved in enforcement and litigation can quickly assess a wide range of informationheld by WHD. It is also noteworthy that the MOU allows any EEOC Commissioner to directly requestinformation from WHD, without first channeling the request through EEOC career staff. This is significantbecause it enables EEOC Commissioners from different political parties than the Chair to obtaininformation directly from WHD.16 U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Memorandum of Understanding Between the U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Divisionand the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, https://www.eeoc.gov/memorandum-understanding-between-us-department-labor-wageand-hour-division-and-us-equal-employment.17 See Rachel See, Christopher DeGroff, and Andrew Scroggins, EEOC and DOL Join Forces - What the Alliance Means for Employers, Workplace ClassAction Blog (Sept. 18, 2023), https://www.workplaceclassaction.com/2023/09/eeoc-and-dol-join-forces-what-the-alliance-means-for-employers/.11 | EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION ©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLPSignificantly, the MOU specifically contemplates that the EEOC can share employer EEO-1 reports withthe WHD. This is notable because Title VII prohibits the EEOC from disclosing EEO report data to thepublic, but the MOU does not bind the WHD in the same way. Instead, the WHD agrees to “observe”Title VII’s confidentiality requirements.Employers can continue to expect the MOU to result in amplified information sharing between theEEOC and WHD when it comes to individual charges and investigations. (The MOU contains a high-levelframework for coordinated investigations involving the same employer.) The potential for data sharingto fuel broader systemic investigations should remain at the forefront of employers’ minds. The abilityto gather additional data through this partnership with the WHD adds a powerful tool to the EEOC’sinvestigative powers.4. Impact of Loper BrightIn its 2023-2024 term, the U.S. Supreme Court brought an end to 40 years of deference toadministrative agencies when it overturned Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,Inc., 468 U.S. 837 (1984).18, 19 In Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2273 (2024), theCourt held that “[c]ourts must exercise their independent judgment in deciding whether an agency hasacted within its statutory authority” rather than allowing the agency to fill statutory gaps, judging thatcourts, not agencies, are best situated to interpret ambiguous statutory provisions, even in areas ofagency expertise.In the wake of the Court’s decision, regulated entities have brought new challenges to longstandingrules that are premised on statutory ambiguity. Under Loper Bright, courts have significantly moreleeway to interpret statutes contrary to an agency’s interpretations, and courts can use this tocabin agency authority.However, while the Court’s decision was a marked change in how courts may review administrativeagencies’ exercise of their power going forward, all agency rules that were enforceable before LoperBright remained enforceable. Indeed, the Court observed that all decisions relying on Chevron touphold an agency’s action (1) remained good law and (2) were not subject to overruling simply becausethey relied on Chevron. The result is that, practically, nothing changes for people or entities subjectto such pre-existing administrative authority unless or until a new challenge is lodged and decided. Forexample, in Kramer v. Bessent, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York noted thatprior cases interpreting the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in light of the EEOC’s regulationsremained binding post-Loper Bright because Loper Bright was not meant to “call into question priorcases” deferring to agency interpretations of statutes.20Further, Loper Bright did not mark the end of the administrative state. Most notably, the decisionappeared to endorse the Court’s ruling in Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944), under whichcourts grant a modicum of deference to an agency’s statutory interpretation to the extent that ithas the power to persuade in light of the agency’s thoroughness, its consistency over time, and thesoundness of its reasoning.Additionally, Loper Bright did little to call into question Congress’s ability to expressly delegateauthority to agencies to promulgate regulations and relevant definitions, such as the delegations tothe EEOC under the ADA, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), and the GeneticInformation Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), as well as the recently passed Pregnant Workers FairnessAct (PWFA) and the Providing Urgent Maternal Protections for Nursing Mothers (“PUMP”) Act. Giventhis, when Congress has directly authorized an agency to exercise discretion about the meaning of astatute, Loper Bright suggests that there is less space for courts to disagree with that interpretation.18 See Rachel See, Jules A. Levenson, and Michael D. Berkheimer, The Chevron Doctrine is Dead. Long Live the Administrative State (June 28, 2024),https://www.seyfarth.com/news-insights/chevron-is-dead-long-live-the-administrative-state.html.19 All case-related information in this Report is strictly derived from court dockets and other publicly-available sources.20 Kramer v.

Ct. at 2273).©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLP EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION | 12For example, in Sutherland v. Peterson’s Oil Service, Inc., the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuitnoted the EEOC’s authority to issue regulations implementing the definitions of disability under theADA as a quintessential example of Congress “expressly delegat[ing] to an agency the authority togive meaning to a particular statutory term,” as the Court had explained in Loper Bright.21Elsewhere, the end of Chevron deference should not affect the way that federal courts are likely to viewthe EEOC’s Title VII guidance, as that guidance has only received Skidmore deference, and not Chevrondeference, since the Court’s ruling in General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125 (1976). For example, inBivens v. Zep, Inc., the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that for an employee to hold heremployer liable for non-employee harassment under Title VII, she must show that the employer intendedfor the harassment to occur.22 The court noted that its holding departed from the EEOC’s reading ofTitle VII, which deemed negligence enough to hold an employer directly liable for workplace harassmentcommitted by a non-employee.23 The court explained that the EEOC’s interpretative authority over TitleVII has limited reach, with the agency authorized to issue only procedural regulations setting forth thesteps for pursuing a claim under Title VII, not substantive ones interpreting the statutory rights ofparties.24 Relying on Loper Bright, the court continued that even if the EEOC had express authority tointerpret Title VII’s substantive provisions, courts would still be obliged to independently interpret thestatute.25 Finally, citing Skidmore as well as Loper Bright, the court noted that its respect for the EEOC’sinterpretation of Title VII extended only so far as the court found that reading persuasive, which it didnot in the case at bar.265. Recent EEOC Guidance on Vision and HearingOn January 24, 2023, the EEOC published guidance27 regarding hearing disabilities in the workplace.The guidance contained a series of question-and-answer documents addressing how the ADA applies tojob applicants and employees with hearing disabilities. In particular, the document explained: when anemployee may ask an applicant or employee questions about a hearing condition and how it should treatvoluntary disclosures; what types of reasonable accommodations applicants or employees with hearingdisabilities may need; how an employer should handle safety concerns about applicants and employeeswith hearing disabilities; and how an employer can ensure that no employee is harassed because of ahearing disability.In a similar vein, on July 26, 2023, the EEOC published updated guidance regarding individuals withvision disabilities in the workplace.28 This technical assistance document explained how the ADA appliesto job applicants and employees with disabilities. The document outlined when, according to the EEOC,an employer may ask an applicant or employee questions about their vision, how an employer shouldtreat voluntary disclosure about visual disabilities, and what types of reasonable accommodationsthose with visual disabilities may need in the workplace. The document also highlighted new technologiesfor reasonable accommodations, and described how using artificial intelligence and algorithms to makeemployment decisions can impact individuals with visual disabilities. Finally, the guidance also addressedhow an employer should handle safety concerns about applicants and employees with visual disabilities,and methods to prevent harassment and retaliation.21 Sutherland v. Peterson’s Oil Serv., Inc., 126 F.4th 728, 738 n.5 (1st Cir. 2025) (quoting Loper Bright Enters., 144 S. Ct. at 2263 (cleaned up)).22 Bivens v.

Instead of permitting the employee to use JAWS or providingother reasonable accommodations, the employer kept her on an unpaid, involuntary leave for almostfour years and then fired her after failing to facilitate her return to work.30 In another case, an employerwas alleged to have violated the ADA by failing to provide employees who are blind or have other visualimpairments with accommodations that would allow them to independently access their employeebenefits information and trainings. According to the EEOC, reasonable accommodations, including theimplementation of technological fixes such as JAWS scripting, or requiring that third-party vendorsprovide accessible benefits portals, would have effectively accommodated these employees by makingthe portals and trainings accessible to them.31The EEOC’s message: employers must provide reasonable accommodations to disabled applicants andemployees, not only during the interview process, but throughout the entire employment relationshipand with respect to all aspects of the employment relationship. The EEOC’s increased scrutiny onthese issues is likely to continue and employers should recognize that the EEOC will target decisions itbelieves are based on stereotypes.6. Focus Area: Hearing Impairment Issues in Recruiting and HiringRelatedly, while the EEOC’s disability-related lawsuits have concerned a broad range of disabilities,the Commission prioritized hearing-related disabilities in recent years. Specifically since publishing itsguidance regarding hearing disabilities in the workplace in January 2023, the Commission filed ninecases on behalf of hearing impaired employees in FY 2023 and seven in FY 2024.32In FY 2025, the Commission only filed two cases on behalf of individuals with hearing impairments,consistent with its decrease in overall filings. Like the cases filed in FYs 2023 and 2024, however, thecases filed by the EEOC in FY 2025 related to hiring and recruiting. For example, a staffing company inone case allegedly stopped recruiting an applicant after the recruiter learned the candidate was “hardof hearing” and required an accommodation for an interview.33 In another case, the employer allegedlyrefused to hire deaf individuals for a driver position, despite the ready availability of technologicalaccommodations and, in some instances, their previous experience as drivers for other companies.34Once again, these cases signal the EEOC’s message that it expects employers (and employmentagencies) to engage in the interactive process with applicants and employees, including during theinterview process, and ensure decisions regarding hiring and recruiting are not made based onstereotypes.7. Staffing Company IssuesIn the FY 2024-2028 SEP, staffing relationships are no longer an “emerging and developing” issue, asthey were in the previous SEP. Instead, the EEOC has expanded its efforts related to “vulnerable andunderserved workers”—those “who may be unaware of their rights under [EEO] laws, may be reluctantor unable to exercise their legally protected rights, or have historically been underserved by federal29 See Christopher J.

In one such case, a staffing agency allegedly failed to hire females or refer them for employment.According to the EEOC, one of the agency’s clients requested male laborers only for their facility, andthe agency complied with the client’s request. 36 In another case, a staffing agency and a business atwhich the agency placed temporary employees discharged individuals because of their pregnancies.378. Amicus Briefs and Other Noteworthy FilingsIn many years, the EEOC spends significant resources filing amicus briefs, particularly in courts ofappeals, to advance and shape the law. Before filing, an amicus brief first must be approved by amajority of Commissioners, but as described elsewhere in this book the EEOC lacked a quorum ofCommissioners for most of the prior year. As a consequence, the EEOC approved and filed AmicusBriefs in only 15 cases during FY 2025. The filings were made almost exclusively in federal appellatecourts, and in one instance with the United States Supreme Court.Though the filings were approved before the change in administration, they nonetheless provide insightsinto the enforcement priorities of the current leadership. As a Commissioner, Lucas voted against filingbriefs. that involved issues related to gender identity or expression, consistent with her assertionsthat sex is binary and immutable. These included cases that involved a gay woman alleging religiouslymotivated sex discrimination, a gender-nonconforming lesbian challenging a mandatory arbitrationagreement, and a transgender woman alleging sex discrimination over denial of health coverage forgender-affirming surgery. On the other hand, Lucas joined the other Commissioners to approve amicusbriefs in all other sex-based discrimination claims. Lucas also was aligned with the other Commissionersthat majority-group discrimination claims should not be subject to stricter evidentiary standards thanthose applied in minority-group discrimination claims.The following is a summary of the EEOC’s Amicus Brief filings in FY 2025. Now that the EEOC’s quorumhas been restored following the U.S. Senate’s confirmation of Brittany Panuccio’s nomination onOctober 7, 2025, and with a 2-1 Republican majority, we anticipate amicus group filings to increase.35 See U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Strategic Enforcement Plan FY 2024-2028, Strategic Enforcement Plan Fiscal Years 2024-2028 | U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (eeoc.gov).36 EEOC v.

Westar Foods, Inc., No. 23-1087 (8th Circuit)Unanimously Approved by the Commissioners.The EEOC argued that an employer acts “on the basis of disability” in violation of the ADA when itsdecision to discipline is based on assumptions or judgments about the nature, extent, or impact of theemployee’s disability, rather than on an individualized assessment of the employee’s actual capabilities.Additionally, the EEOC took the position that an employer’s “honest belief” that an employee violatedits policy does not automatically shield it from liability under the ADA.Smith v. P.A.M. Transport, Inc., No. 24-5549 (6th Circuit)Unanimously Approved by the Commissioners.Two African American truck drivers alleged that they were subjected to the repeated use of the slur“monkey ass” by their supervisors; were provided fewer trainings, given less time off, assigned lessdesirable job duties; and denied fair pay. The EEOC filed an Amicus Brief arguing that the lower courterred in granting summary judgment in favor of the employer because a reasonable jury could findthat supervisors repeatedly calling the Plaintiffs “monkey ass” both constituted race-basedharassment and was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms or conditions of theiremployment. The EEOC took the position that a discrete employment-related action, includingunfavorable work assignments, can contribute to a hostile work environment. Additionally, the EEOCargued that the district court erred in requiring the Plaintiffs to identify comparators who were“non‑African American” rather than “white,” arguing that “Black” and “White” may unquestionablybe used as racial categories in litigating Title VII discrimination and harassment claims.Doe v. Saber Healthcare Group, No. 24-2106 (3rd Circuit)Approved by: Commissioners Burrows, Kotagal, Samuels; Disapproved by: Commissioner Lucas.A gender nonconforming lesbian woman of color worked as a nursing assistant at a facility where shealleged she was subjected to reduced work hours, physical assault by a resident, and dismissive orhostile responses from staff when she reported the mistreatment. She claimed she was effectivelyterminated when her employer stopped scheduling her for shifts after she raised concerns about hertreatment. The EEOC advocated for affirming the district court’s decision that the Plaintiff’s claimsconstituted a “sexual harassment dispute” under the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault andSexual Harassment Act (EFASASHA), thereby invalidating a mandatory arbitration agreement thatwould have required the complaint to be heard by an arbitrator rather than in court.Pratt v. Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry, No 24-1901 (7th Circuit)Unanimously Approved by the Commissioners.An HR manager allegedly was terminated after reporting multiple instances of inappropriate anddiscriminatory behavior, including racist and sexist remarks by senior leaders. The EEOC argued thatthe lower court applied an incorrect legal standard by holding HR professionals to a higher bar and bymischaracterizing what constitutes protected opposition to a hostile work environment. The EEOCtook the position that managers and human resources employees are subject to the same standardfor assessing protected activity as other employees. The EEOC argued that the district court appliedan overly strict and incorrect standard for hostile work environment claims by requiring harassmentto be both severe and pervasive, demanding intent to harass, and failing to recognize that employeescan oppose harassment before it becomes fully actionable under Title VII.©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLP EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION | 16Hartson v. Compwest Insurance Co., No. 24-1651 (6th Circuit)Unanimously Approved by the Commissioners.An employee requested a medical exemption from the company’s mandatory COVID-19 vaccine policydue to severe allergic reactions to antibiotics and vaccines, supported by a physician’s note warning ofserious disability or death. The employee claimed that the company denied her an exemption withoutfurther inquiry and terminated her employment when she did not comply with the vaccination deadline.The EEOC advocated for reversal of the district court’s dismissal arguing that plaintiffs do not need toallege detailed facts about how their impairment affects major life activities, and that a plausible claimof disability suffices.Smith v. City of Union, OH Police Dep’t, No. 24-3489 (6th Circuit)Unanimously Approved by the Commissioners.A police officer was first terminated and then reinstated by an arbitrator, but the employer allegedlydelayed his return by requiring a psychological fitness-for-duty exam. During the delay, younger officerswere promoted or rehired. The Plaintiff alleged retaliation for filing an age discrimination complaint.The EEOC filed an Amicus Brief arguing that the lower court erred in granting summary judgment infavor of the Defendant. The EEOC took the position that forcing an employee to undergo a psychologicalfitness-for-duty examination may constitute a materially adverse action. It additionally argued that thelower court applied a stricter “would dissuade” standard instead of the correct “could well dissuade”or “might dissuade” standard required for retaliation claims.McMahon v. World Vision, Inc., No. 24-3259 (9th Circuit)Approved by: Commissioners Burrows, Kotagal, Samuels; Disapproved by: Commissioner Lucas.The employer offered the Plaintiff a job but allegedly rescinded it after learning she was in a same-sexmarriage, citing its religious standards of conduct requiring employees to adhere to “Biblically basedbehavior.” The EEOC advocated for affirming the district court’s ruling in favor of the Plaintiff arguingthat Defendant is not exempt under Title VII’s religious organization exemption, noting that no federalappellate court in the country permits religiously motivated sex discrimination. It further argued thatthe Plaintiff’s sex is not a bona fide occupational qualification for the customer service role to whichshe applied.Lange v. Houston County, GA, No. 22-13626-U (11th Circuit)Approved by: Commissioners Burrows, Kotagal, Samuels; Disapproved by: Commissioner Lucas.A transgender woman and longtime sheriff’s deputy claimed she was denied insurance coverage formedically necessary gender-affirming surgery due to exclusions in the county’s health plan. The districtcourt highlighted that the same procedures would be covered for other medical reasons (e.g., cancertreatment), but not for gender dysphoria. In a joint Amicus Brief with the Department of Justice, theEEOC urged that the lower court’s ruling be affirmed, arguing that the plan’s denial of care solely forgender transition purposes is facially discriminatory on the basis of sex.17 | EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION ©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLPBlaine v. Mystere Living & Healthcare, Inc., No. 24-3121 (10th Circuit)Unanimously Approved by the Commissioners.An occupational therapy assistant was terminated eleven days before her stated resignation datealthough she was paid through the full notice period. The employee alleged she was retaliated againstunder Title VII after reporting repeated sexual harassment by a coworker. The EEOC advocatedfor the reversal of the district court’s decision in favor of the employer by arguing that the districtcourt mistakenly used the stricter “significant change in employment status” standard—applicableto discrimination claims—instead of the proper “materially adverse” standard that the SupremeCourt set out in Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53 (2006), which asks whetherthe employer’s action might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting adiscrimination complaint.Key v. Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, LLC, No. 24-11126 (11th Circuit)Approved by: Commissioners Burrows, Kotagal, Samuels; Disapproved by: Commissioner Lucas.An African American woman hired to work at a plant alleged that she was removed from her positionafter being told her dreadlocks violated a grooming policy and after disclosing her pregnancy. She fileddiscrimination and retaliation claims, but the district court dismissed most of them. The EEOC tookthe position that the lower court improperly granted summary judgment. In its Amicus Brief, the EEOCargued that the Plaintiff plausibly alleged that banning dreadlocks disproportionately affects Blackindividuals, to support a disparate impact claim. It also argued that the Plaintiff provided sufficientevidence suggesting the dreadlocks ban was racially motivated, to support a disparate treatment claim.Khatabi v. Car Auto Holdings LLC, No. 24-12573 (11th Circuit)Unanimously Approved by the Commissioners.After the Plaintiff sued for constructive discharge and won, the employer invoked Title VII’s statutorydamages cap. The EEOC in its Amicus Brief argued that the Eleventh Circuit should reverse theremittitur because the employer waived that affirmative defense by failing to assert it in its answeror pretrial stipulation.Smith v. General Motors LLC, No. 24-10841 (5th Circuit)Unanimously Approved by the Commissioners.A forklift driver claimed that she suffered a head injury in August 2020 and was placed on long-termwork restrictions, but that the employer repeatedly assigned her tasks outside those restrictions andultimately terminated her employment in March 2022. The district court dismissed her ADA claims.The EEOC filed an Amicus Brief arguing that the district court relied on a definition of “substantiallylimited” to assess the Plaintiff’s disability allegations that the ADAAA expressly abrogated.©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLP EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION | 18Ames v. Ohio Dep’t of Youth Servs., No. 23-1039 (U.S. Supreme Court)Unanimously Approved by the Commissioners.A heterosexual woman alleged she was denied a promotion and later demoted because of her sexualorientation, in violation of Title VII. The district court and Sixth Circuit rejected her claim, holdingthat majority-group plaintiffs must show “background circumstances” suggesting the employerdiscriminates against the majority, in addition to the usual prima facie elements under the frameworkset forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). The EEOC filed an Amicus Briefurging the Supreme Court to reaffirm that all Title VII plaintiffs—majority or minority—are entitledto the same evidentiary rules and to eliminate the “background circumstances” requirement.Arnold v. United Air Lines, No. 24-2179 (7th Circuit)Unanimously Approved by the Commissioners.A 26-year employee alleged age discrimination and retaliation after being removed from a high-profileproject and placed on a performance improvement plan (PIP) following her complaint about losingthe project to a younger colleague. The district court granted summary judgment for the employer,finding these actions were not “adverse employment actions” and that the Plaintiff failed to showdiscriminatory or retaliatory intent. The EEOC filed an Amicus Brief arguing that the lower court erredby ignoring Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, 601 U.S. 346 (2024), which lowered the threshold to “someharm” for discrimination claims, making both the project removal and PIP potentially actionable. TheEEOC further argued that although Muldrow was a Title VII case, its holding is equally applicable tothe ADEA’s anti-discrimination provision based on the statutes’ common language.Mustafa v. Ford Motor Co., No. 24-1763 (6th Circuit)Unanimously Approved by the Commissioners.A Middle Eastern Muslim employee claimed that he began receiving negative reviews after beingtransferred to a new team despite praise from previous managers and other managers for temporaryprojects. After filing an internal complaint of discrimination, he allegedly was falsely accused oftimecard fraud and given another poor review despite meeting all deliverables. Following a six monthmedical leave, he was terminated. The EEOC filed an Amicus Brief arguing that the lower court erredin dismissing the Plaintiff’s retaliation claim because a false misconduct accusation in tandem with anegative performance review supported an inference of retaliatory motive.19 | EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION ©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLP9. EEOC Stepping Down from Several LawsuitsAn Executive Order titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring BiologicalTruth to the Federal Government,” published on January 20, 2025, stated that sex is a binary conceptlimited to “biologically male” and “biologically female.”38 On January 29, 2025, the Office of PersonnelManagement (OPM) directed all federal employees to take prompt actions to end all agency programsthat use taxpayer money to “promote or reflect gender ideology” as defined in the Executive Order.In response, the EEOC withdrew seven lawsuits it had initiated accusing businesses of discriminatingagainst transgender or nonbinary employees.In EEOC v. Sis-Bro Inc., a transgender employee alleged that a coworker exposed his genitals to her andtouched her breasts, addressed her by her birth-name, and repeatedly criticized her for receivinggender affirming care.

The case was dismissed in August 2025 after a stipulation of dismissal wasfiled by the parties.4510. Changes within the Federal SectorOn May 15, 2025, then Acting Chair Andrea Lucas announced key changes via two memoranda. The first,titled “Ending Unauthorized Monetary Sanctions Against Federal Agencies,” reversed a two-decade-longpractice by announcing that the EEOC will no longer impose monetary sanctions (e.g., attorney’s feesor costs) on federal agencies for noncompliance with EEOC administrative orders.46 This is in line withthe advice of the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), which states that monetarysanctions against federal agencies violate principles of sovereign immunity since such sanctions requirean explicit statutory waiver. The memorandum referenced Loper Bright to highlight two points. First,it is the courts, not the agencies, which define legal boundaries. And second, the OLC’s opinion isconsistent with the federal courts’ established jurisprudence on sovereign immunity. In lieu of monetarypenalties, the EEOC will use non-monetary remedies such as: resolving issues in favor of the opposingparty, drawing adverse evidentiary inferences, excluding evidence, and other tailored proceduralactions. The memo also implies that this new stance could serve as a possible cost-cutting measure forthe federal government, saying that using enforcement tools other than monetary sanctions “willfurther the EEOC’s mission of eliminating unlawful discrimination while responsibly stewarding the fundsentrusted to the federal government by Congress.”The second memo, titled “Restoring and Protecting the Presumption of Innocence in the EEO ComplaintProcess,” endorsed the Department of Defense’s decision to stop holding promotions in abeyance solelybecause an employee is the subject of a pending EEO complaint.47 In this memo, Lucas emphasized thatthe neutrality of the EEO process must exist for both the complainant and the accused, and that therecan be no presumption of guilt against those accused of discrimination without a substantive finding ofmisconduct based on credible evidence.45 Lucas v. Brik Enterprises Inc. et al., No. 2:24-cv-12817 (E.D. Mich.).46 U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Memorandum from EEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas on Ending Unauthorized Monetary SanctionsAgainst Federal Agencies, https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/2025-05/EEOC_Memo_-_Ending_Unauthorized_Monetary_Sanctions_Against_Federal_Agencies.pdf.47 U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Memorandum from EEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas on Restoring and Protecting the Presumptionof Innocence in the EEO Complaint Process, https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/2025-05/EEOC_Memo_-_Restoring_and_Protecting_the_Presumption_of_Innocence_in_the_EEO_Complaint_Process.pdf.21 | EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION ©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLPB. EEOC Focus on Pregnancy DiscriminationThe EEOC’s Strategic Enforcement Plan includes a focus on protecting workers affected by pregnancy,childbirth, or related medical conditions, including under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) and thePregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA), as well as pregnancy-related disabilities under the Americans withDisabilities Act (ADA).48 The agency has continued to focus on such claims under the Trump administration,though with a less expansive interpretation of who is covered by such laws.1. The Legal FrameworkThe PDA is an amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes discrimination basedon pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions a form of unlawful sex discrimination. Underthe PDA, employers must treat women affected by pregnancy or related conditions the same as otheremployees similar in their ability or inability to work, in all aspects of employment, including hiring,pay, promotions, training, and benefits. An employer cannot refuse to hire, fire, or take adverse actionagainst a woman because she is pregnant, was pregnant, or might become pregnant, nor can decisionsbe based on stereotypes or customer preferences. Further, under the PDA, pregnant employees mustbe allowed to work as long as they can perform their job, and if temporarily disabled due to pregnancy,they must receive the same leave and job protections as other temporarily disabled employees. ThePDA also prohibits singling out pregnancy-related conditions for special procedures and ensures equaltreatment in medical clearance, leave policies, and return-to-work rules.The PWFA requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations for an applicant’s or employee’sknown limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, unless doing sowould cause undue hardship. In general, a “reasonable accommodation” means a change to the workenvironment or how work is normally done, such as modified schedules, additional breaks, or temporaryreassignment. Employers must engage in an interactive process with the employee to identifyappropriate accommodations and cannot automatically deny requests or enforce rigid policies. Finally,the definition of “undue hardship” under the PWFA is the same as under the ADA and Title VII.2. Pregnancy-Related LawsuitsThe number of EEOC lawsuits alleging pregnancy-related claims has significantly increased. In FY 2025the EEOC filed 10 lawsuits under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act and/or the Pregnant Workers’Fairness Act - five in September 2025 alone, discussed below. This emphasis on pregnancy-relatedissues aligns with public statements by Chair Lucas, who has placed an emphasis on enforcingprotections in this areas. Notably, Lucas has rejected the broader interpretation offered in the FinalRule implementing the PWFA. In her view, the rule “fundamentally erred in conflating pregnancyand childbirth accommodation with accommodation of the female sex, that is, female biology andreproduction.” 49 Removing or revising the rule requires a vote by the Commission, which Lucas hasstated she will seek.In EEOC v. Comforts of Home Holdings LLC, Inver Grove Heights WP LLC d/b/a White Pine SeniorLiving, Inver Grove Heights WP II LLC, No. 0:25-cv-00059, filed in the District of Minnesota on January7, 2025, the EEOC alleged the employer discriminated against a pregnant employee by subjecting herto workplace harassment, discriminatory discharge, and retaliation, on the basis of pregnancy. InApril 2025, the parties filed a Joint Motion to Approve a Consent Decree. On May 13, 2025, the Courtgranted the Motion and entered the Consent Decree.48 See U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Strategic Enforcement Plan FY 2024-2028, Strategic Enforcement Plan Fiscal Years 2024-2028 | U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (eeoc.gov).49 See Position of Acting Chair Lucas Regarding the Commission’s Final Regulations Implementing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act,https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/position-acting-chair-lucas-regarding-commissions-final-regulations-implementing-pregnant©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLP EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION | 22In EEOC v. Support Center For Child Advocates, No. 2:25-cv-00310, filed in the Eastern District ofPennsylvania on January 17, 2025, the EEOC alleges that the employer denied an employee’s request—necessitated by her high-risk pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic—to be exempted fromthe employer’s policy requiring in-office attendance three days per week, while providing the sameaccommodation to a non-pregnant employee, which resulted in the employee’s constructive discharge.On October 16, 2025, after the parties’ third motion for entry of a Consent Decree was denied, theparties filed a Stipulation of Dismissal and Settlement Agreement, and the Court dismissed the lawsuitwith prejudice. (This case is also noteworthy for the fact that it resolved with a Stipulation of Dismissaland Settlement Agreement; not a Consent Decree.)In EEOC v. QSR Pita USA, Inc., Bubbamax, LLC, Paul Duerre, et al., No. 4:25-cv-04109, filed in theDistrict of South Dakota on June 23, 2025, the EEOC alleges the employer discriminated against itsemployee due to pregnancy and a related disability and denied reasonable accommodation, whichultimately lead to her termination. This case is in the early stages of litigation.In EEOC v. PT Administrative Services LLC, No. 1:25-cv-03615, filed in the Eastern District of New Yorkon June 30, 2025, the EEOC alleges that the employer unlawfully discriminated against its employeeby denying reasonable accommodations related to childbirth and lactation, firing her shortly aftergiving birth for requesting support, and refusing to rehire her despite her willingness to return withoutaccommodations. This case is in the early stages of litigation.In EEOC v. Smithfield Fresh Meats Corp., No. 7:25-cv-1410, filed in the Eastern District of North Carolinaon August 19, 2025, the EEOC alleges that the employer refused to accommodate an employee’spregnancy-related limitations, forced her to take leave unnecessarily, and discharged her. This case isin the early stages of litigation.In EEOC v. Roland Park SNF Operations, LLC, et al., No, 1:25-cv-02986, filed in the District of Marylandon September 10, 2025, the EEOC alleges a certified nursing assistant told her employer she wastemporarily restricted by her doctor from lifting patients due to risks in her pregnancy. In response,the employer, which maintained a policy of reserving light or modified duty for workers with on-the-jobinjuries only, refused to provide a reasonable accommodation for the employee as required by federallaw. Instead, the company terminated her, telling her to reapply for a position after her pregnancy. Thiscase is in the early stages of litigation.In EEOC v. Smoke BBQ LLC, No. 1:25-cv-00278, filed in the Southern District of Mississippi, orSeptember 15, 2025, the EEOC alleges that in November 2023, shortly after a server started workingat the restaurant, the server told her colleagues about her pregnancy. The next day, after the server’smanager heard about her pregnancy, the server was fired. This case is in the early stages of litigation.In EEOC v. Blue Island SLF, LLC, No. 1:25-cv-11111, filed in the Norther District of Illinois on September15, 2025, the EEOC alleges the employer, an assisted living facility in Blue Island, Illinois, terminated apregnant employee after she disclosed her pregnancy and related lifting restriction. This case is in theearly stages of litigation.In EEOC v. iPro Dental Laboratory, Inc., No. 0:25-cv-61904, filed in the Southern District of Florida onSeptember 23, 2025, the EEOC alleges that iPro Dental hired a woman in January 2023, describing heras “perfect,” for the position of office assistant at its Fort Lauderdale location. The company fired herjust days later after learning she was pregnant. Prior to her termination, the new employee had notbeen disciplined for her work performance. This case is in the early stages of litigation.23 | EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION ©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLP3. Subpoena Enforcement ActionIn FY 2025, the EEOC also filed its first PWFA subpoena enforcement action. In EEOC v. R&L CarriersShared Services, LLC, No. No. 1:25-cv-00528, filed in the Northern District of Illinois on January 16, 2025,the EEOC filed suit to enforce a subpoena the agency issued as part of an investigation into an allegedviolation of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The EEOC alleged that that employer discriminatedagainst the employee based on her sex, failed to reasonably accommodate her pregnancy-relatedrestrictions, and placed the employee on involuntary unpaid leave. Under the subpoena, EEOC soughtto collect information on employees who worked at the same location as the employee in question andon other drivers in Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, South Dakota and North Dakota who requestedaccommodations for pregnancy-related restrictions. After the EEOC filed the subpoena enforcementaction, the employer withdrew the objections to the subpoena and agreed to voluntarily produce therequested information The EEOC moved to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit on March 7, 2025.As noted above, the EEOC’s enforcement of pregnancy-related issues increased in FY 2025. TheCommission remains focused on vigorously enforcing pregnancy discrimination laws in the workplace.Employer’s should ensure they have thorough pregnancy-related discrimination and accommodationspolicies, including a strong practice for documenting the interactive process under the PWFAC. Changing Enforcement Priorities To Protect Workers Against DiscriminationThe EEOC enforces Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its prohibition on discrimination in theworkplace based on protected characteristics such as sex and race. Historically, these enforcementefforts focused on protecting minority populations that possessed or were perceived to have immutablecharacteristics and targeted for discrimination in the workplace as a result.Under the leadership of Chair Lucas, the EEOC has altered this enforcement framework by targetingemployers for discrimination for maintaining and supporting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)-relatedprograms that on their face were intended to support minority populations. Now, the EEOC may takeenforcement action against an employer initiative, policy, program, or practice if it unlawfully involvestaking an employment action motivated—in whole or in part—by race, sex, or another protectedcharacteristic. Indeed, as of January 2026, the landing page for EEOC.gov opens with a large banner stating“DEI Discrimination: What To Do If You Experience It,” with a prominent link to “Learn More” about DEIrelated discrimination that takes the reader to the aforementioned EEOC fact sheet “What to Do if youExperience Discrimination Related to DEI at Work.” 50To assist employers with this change, the EEOC provided technical assistance clarifying its position regardingcertain specific DEI practices such as having diverse interview slates that may require minimum representationof candidates from specific demographic groups in their interview pools, such as the National Football League’sRooney Rule requiring teams to interview at least one minority candidate for a head coach position. Anotherpractice highlighted by the EEOC as possible unlawful DEI-related discrimination are Employee ResourceGroups or employee affinity groups that may limit membership to certain protected groups.In early 2025, a number of the country’s largest law firms became the first well-publicized target of theEEOC’s reworked enforcement with respect to DEI-related discrimination. Soon after President Trumpissued Executive Order 13985, “Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved CommunitiesThrough the Federal Government,” 51 then-Acting Chair Lucas sent letters to 20 law firms to requestinformation about their DEI-related employment practices and later proclaimed, “The EEOC is preparedto root out discrimination anywhere it may rear its head, including in our nation’s elite law firms.”What is clear is that the Lucas-led EEOC rejects the concept of reverse discrimination; there is “onlydiscrimination.”50 https://www.eeoc.gov/what-do-if-you-experience-discrimination-related-dei-work51 Exec. Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities through the Federal Government,” 90 FR 7009 (2025).©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLP EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION | 241. Ames DecisionOn June 5, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision in Ames v. Ohio Department ofYouth Services, in which the Court held that “majority-group” plaintiffs are not subject to a heightenedburden when alleging discrimination. In Ames, the Court struck down the Sixth Circuit’s “backgroundcircumstances” requirement and reaffirming that Title VII’s protections apply equally to all individualsregardless of “majority” or “minority” status. The case arose after the heterosexual plaintiff claimedshe was passed over for promotion and later demoted in favor of two openly gay candidates. Lowercourts applied a heightened prima facie standard and granted summary judgment against the plaintiff,but the Supreme Court reversed, holding that the McDonnell Douglas framework applies uniformlyto all Title VII plaintiffs. Justice Jackson’s opinion emphasized the statute’s group-neutral language,while a concurrence by Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Gorsuch, warned that corporate diversityprograms and DEI initiatives can constitute actionable discrimination if they disadvantage “majoritygroup” employees.Following the decision, then-EEOC Acting Chair Lucas issued a statement celebrating the ruling asrestoring evenhanded application of Title VII. Lucas underscored that the EEOC has long maintained aneutral, group-blind enforcement posture and signaled that the decision removes any perceived shieldfor employers implementing DEI programs that result in race- or sex-based decision-making. The EEOCfiled an amicus brief in Ames and, earlier in 2025, issued joint guidance with the Department of Justiceon unlawful DEI practices, following information requests sent to major law firms.Looking ahead to 2026, employers should anticipate increased EEOC scrutiny of DEI-driven employmentpractices, particularly those that create quotas or preferential treatment, as well as heightenedenforcement around religious accommodation disputes involving pronoun usage, observance, andattire. With the agency poised to pursue systemic investigations, employers should proactively reviewdiversity programs for race and sex neutral language, document legitimate business justifications forinclusion efforts, and strengthen religious accommodation protocols. The Ames decision signals a newera of enforcement where DEI initiatives will face rigorous examination under Title VII’s group-neutralmandate, and employers that fail to adapt may face significant litigation risk.2. National Origin Discrimination To Protect American WorkersHistorically, the EEOC’s enforcement priorities focused on protecting vulnerable populations, suchas immigrant workers from discrimination. These efforts reflected a longstanding commitment toaddressing barriers faced by minority groups in the workplace.In a notable policy shift, the EEOC, under Chair Lucas, announced a new emphasis on unlawfulemployment practices that favor non-American workers over American workers.52 This changeaims to address national origin discrimination and anti-American bias.Recent enforcement actions illustrate the agency’s current priority to target practices thatdisadvantage American workers. In FY 2025, the agency filed only two national origin discriminationlawsuits, and both actions involved allegations of discrimination against American workers. Incontrast, the EEOC filed five national origin cases in FY 2024, none of which addressed antiAmerican bias.This year, the EEOC secured a $1.4 million settlement with LeoPalace Guam Corporation afterallegations that American nationals received less favorable wages and benefits compared to Japaneseemployees in similar roles.53 In the other national origin discrimination case, the EEOC asserted claims52 See EEOC Press Release, EEOC Acting Chair Vows to Protect American Workers from Anti-American Bias, https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeocacting-chair-vows-protect-american-workers-anti-american-bias53 See EEOC Press Release, LeoPalace Resort to Pay Over $1.4 Million in EEOC National Origin Discrimination Lawsuit, https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/leopalace-resort-pay-over-14-million-eeoc-national-origin-discrimination-lawsuit25 | EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION ©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLPof discrimination on behalf of Black, American workers, alleging that the employer gave preference inassignments and pay to non-Black, non-American workers authorized to work under H-2A (agriculturalwork) visas.54 These actions demonstrate the EEOC’s policy shift.To further this initiative, the EEOC published a fact sheet titled “Discrimination Against AmericanWorkers Is Against the Law” and updated its national origin discrimination resources.55 The guidancehighlights high-risk practices such as job postings stating “H-1B preferred,” disparate treatment inhiring or compensation, and retaliation against individuals opposing such discrimination. Importantly,the EEOC warns that employers cannot justify these practices based on client preferences, costconsiderations, or assumptions about work ethic.This shift in enforcement priorities will likely see implications for employers in industries withhistorically large immigrant workforces such as agriculture, construction, healthcare, hospitality,and food service.D. Religious DiscriminationUnder the leadership of Chair Andrea Lucas, the EEOC has made the elimination of religious discriminationa priority. The agency has taken a firm position against antisemitism and what it calls “Anti-Christian Bias”,focusing on the treatment of Jews and Christian across the nation. The EEOC has also taken steps to ensurethat employers follow the heightened Groff standard when evaluating accommodation requests, taking actionagainst employers who have not shown they would face substantially increased costs.In its August 22, 2025 publication “200 Days of EEOC Action to Protect Religious Freedom at Work” 56, theEEOC “reaffirmed its commitment to enforcing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibitsworkplace discrimination based on religion” and highlighted the following enforcement actions as examplesof the agency’s work in this area.• COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates: The EEOC focused enforcement on employers for not providing religiousaccommodations to pandemic era vaccine mandates. These efforts resulted in obtaining over $55million on behalf of workers, including a $1 million settlement with Mercyhealth and conciliationswith major employers such as Mayo Clinic and Silver Cross Hospital. Remedies included reinstatementoffers and mandatory Title VII training for HR personnel.• Broader Religious Accommodation Cases: The Commission reached settlements of claims involvingSabbath observance, religious dress, and prayer practices. Notable settlements include $850,000with The Venetian Resort for denial of religious accommodations and retaliation against employeesof various faiths as well as injunctive relief; $61,000 with The Teeth Doctors for terminating anemployee over a request to wear a scrub skirt for religious reasons; and $217,500 with Logic Staffingfor failure to hire a Muslim applicant who had asked for an accommodation to attend Friday prayer.EEOC litigation has increasingly targeted retaliatory practices and discriminatory terminations linkedto faith-based requests.Chair Lucas has prioritized enforcement against higher education institutions - in particular onthe campuses of universities and colleges - for compliance, investigations, and litigation to addressconcerns of religious bias and harassment.54 See EEOC Press Release, Seward and Son to Pay $150,000 in EEOC Race and National Origin Discrimination Lawsuit, https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/seward-and-son-pay-150000-eeoc-race-and-national-origin-discrimination-lawsuit55 See EEOC Fact Sheet, Discrimination Against American Workers Is Against the Law, https://www.eeoc.gov/discrimination-against-americanworkers-against-law56 https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/200-days-eeoc-action-protect-religious-freedom-work©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLP EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION | 26• Combating Antisemitism in Higher Education: Consistent with Chair Lucas’s March 2025 promise“to hold accountable universities and colleges which have created a hostile-work environment fortheir Jewish employees”57, the EEOC obtained a $21 million settlement with Columbia Universityafter claiming harassment based on religion and national origin. The agency continues to prioritizeaccountability for universities regarding antisemitism and religious bias.• Federal Workforce Protections: EEOC issued decisions reinforcing religious rights for federalemployees and participates in the Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias, established underExecutive Order 14202.Chair Lucas also emphasized the agency’s goal of restoring “evenhanded enforcement” of Title VII, ensuringemployees are not forced to choose between their faith and their livelihood. These actions reflect a broaderstrategy by the EEOC to uphold religious liberty and combat discrimination in both private and public sectors.In keeping with the EEOC’s stated goals, the agency has taken the following enforcement actions in 2025:• EEOC v. Crystal Ridge Ski Area, LLC d/b/a The Rock Snowpark, Case No. 25-cv-940 (E.D. Wis.):58On July 2, 2025, the EEOC filed a lawsuit alleging that The Rock Snowpark, a winter sports and eventsvenue in Franklin, Wisconsin, violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by terminating a liftoperations manager because of his religion. According to the complaint, the employee, a Christian,regularly posted Bible verses and faith-based messages on his personal social media account. Theseposts did not reference the workplace or coworkers. After his supervisor instructed him to refrainfrom posting such content, the employee stated he could continue sharing scripture. Three days later,he was fired for posting another Bible verse.The EEOC contends that the discharge constituted unlawful religious discrimination. The agency filedsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin after attempting conciliation. TheEEOC seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief to prevent future discrimination.• EEOC v. FCA US, LLC, Case No. 25-cv-11675 (E.D. Mich.):59 On July 7, 2025, the EEOC filed a lawsuitalleging that FCA US, LLC, an international automobile manufacturer, violated Title VII of the Civil RightsAct of 1964 by refusing to accommodate an employee’s religious observance and then terminatinghim. According to the complaint, FCA initially allowed the employee, who is Jewish, to avoid working onthe Sabbath. Two months later, FCA instituted mandatory Saturday work, conflicting with his religiousbeliefs. Instead of engaging in an interactive process, FCA disciplined the employee for attendanceviolations when he did not work on the Sabbath.The employee complained about discrimination, but FCA continued issuing violations. Three monthslater, FCA denied his request for two unpaid days off to observe Passover. When the employee choseto observe Passover rather than work, FCA disciplined him again and ultimately fired him. The EEOCalleges this conduct constitutes unlawful religious discrimination and retaliation.The EEOC filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan after unsuccessfulconciliation efforts. The agency seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief to preventfuture violations.57 https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-acting-chair-promises-hold-accountable-universities-and-colleges-antisemitism-campus58 https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-sues-rock-snowpark-religious-discrimination59 https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-charges-fca-firing-worker-practicing-his-faith27 | EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION ©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLP• EEOC v.

Minn.):65 On October 8, 2025, the EEOC filed alawsuit alleging that Mayo Clinic violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by failing toaccommodate employees’ religious objections to its COVID-19 vaccine mandate and terminatingthose who refused vaccination based on sincerely held beliefs.According to the EEOC, Mayo Clinic enforced a blanket policy denying religious exemptions and didnot engage in an interactive process with affected employees. The suit seeks monetary damagesand injunctive relief, including policy changes and training to ensure compliance with Title VII’saccommodation requirements.E. EEOC Focus on Equal Pay ProtectionsThe EEOC is the federal government’s most powerful agency for the enforcement of federal anti-discriminationlaws in the workplace. Authorized by Congress to wield broad investigative and subpoena powers for theprevention and remediation of unlawful employment practices, the EEOC’s enforcement mechanisms covera range of activities, from individual and systemic claims investigations, conciliation, litigation and monitoringcompliance, to serving as an agent for effecting broader policy change in employment sectors throughout thecountry. Each iteration of the EEOC’s Strategic Enforcement Plan has included a focus on advancing equal payfor all workers.66The number of EEOC lawsuits alleging equal pay violations has dropped significantly in recent years. This hasled to a decline in legal decisions relating to equal pay issues, at least those involving the EEOC as a party.Indeed, the EEOC filed only two Equal Pay Act (“EPA”) cases in federal court in 2024, and zero such casesin 2025.While the recent Trump EEOC has not focused on EPA claims thus far, it has sought to enforce paydiscrimination claims under Title VII. For example, in EEOC v. Seward and Son Planting Company, 4:25-cv155, the EEOC alleged that the defendant violated Title VII by subjecting a class of employees to disparatetreatment in their pay and terms and conditions of employment on the basis of their race (black) andnational origin (United States of America). On November 25, 2025, the EEOC announced that Seward andSon would pay $150,000 and implement policy changes by way of a three-year consent decree to settlethose claims.67 In another recent matter, EEOC v. TKO Construction Services, No. 23-cv-3010 JRT TNL,the defendant agreed to pay $300,000 to settle race and sex discrimination claims under Title VII,including claims that female and black employees received less pay than male and white employees.6864 https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/mercyhealth-pay-over-1-million-settle-eeoc-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-related-religious65 https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-sues-mayo-clinic-religious-discrimination66 See U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Strategic Enforcement Plan FY 2024-2028, Strategic Enforcement Plan Fiscal Years 2024-2028 | U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (eeoc.gov).67 See https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/seward-and-son-pay-150000-eeoc-race-and-national-origin-discrimination-lawsuit68 See https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/tko-construction-services-pay-300000-settle-eeoc-sex-race-and-age-discrimination-lawsuit29 | EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION ©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLPAs noted above, the EEOC’s enforcement of equal pay issues has dwindled in recent years, and has beenclose to non-existent this year. However, employers should be mindful of potential EEOC-driven litigationin this area, particularly if DEI metrics were a factor in compensation decisions, and, where appropriate,conduct a privileged audit of their pay practices to prevent potential liability.F. Preventing Discrimination In Recruiting and HiringOver the past decade, the EEOC has spent a considerable amount of its enforcement budget litigatingissues that it sees as barriers to recruitment and hiring. Much of its enforcement activity has historicallyfocused on combating hiring practices that could result in age discrimination. But recent years haveevidenced a broadening of that focus to claims ranging from sex discrimination, race discrimination, anddisability discrimination. Central to many of these enforcement efforts was the EEOC’s reliance ondisparate impact liability, a theory that allowed the agency to challenge ostensibly neutral hiring practices—such as pre-employment screening tests and technology-based selection tools—resulting in statisticallyunequal outcomes for certain groups of individuals. Until recently, the disparate impact theory proved tobe a powerful enforcement tool, enabling the EEOC to pursue large, systemic cases involving company‑widerecruiting and hiring practices.In 2026, employers should expect a retrenchment of the EEOC’s strategic efforts to develop and file litigationalleging discrimination in recruitment and hiring in light of Executive Order 14281, which directs all federalagencies to deprioritize enforcement of claims predicated on a disparate impact theory of liability.69 In a May20, 2025 press release, EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas stated that the EEOC will not pursue investigations orlitigation that challenge neutral practices that have unequal outcomes based on protected characteristicson account of the executive order.70 Chair Lucas’s statements reflect a clear and deliberate abandonment ofdisparate impact as a viable enforcement theory in the recruitment and hiring context.The EEOC’s retreat from disparate impact claims is likely to materially affect both the size and scope offuture hiring- and recruitment- related enforcement actions. Without the ability to rely primarily on statisticaldisparities, the agency faces increased difficulties in investigating and challenging facially-neutral technologybased and algorithmic decision-making processes in recruiting and hiring. Employers should expect the EEOCto narrow and shift its strategic efforts towards litigation involving recruiting and hiring practices that containan indicia of intentional discrimination—presented as pattern or practice claims—rather than litigationinvolving recruiting and hiring practices that have a disparate impact on a particular group.1. Artificial Intelligence and Technology in Recruiting and HiringUse of artificial intelligence has entered the mainstream, and the application of these tools in theworkplace has become increasingly common. Employers now routinely use artificial intelligence tostreamline hiring and recruiting.Prior versions of the SEP announced the EEOC’s focus on recruitment and hiring practices and policiesthat might give rise to discrimination against members of racial, ethnic, and religious groups, as well aswomen, older workers, and those with disabilities. In the current SEP, the EEOC added far more detailabout the types of hiring practices and policies that it intends to scrutinize, and specifically noted thatit is interested in employers’ use of artificial intelligence and automated systems in that regard. TheCommission has emphasized its intent to investigate whether members of a protected group might beharmed by automated systems used to target job advertisements to particular populations, recruitworkers, or aid in hiring decisions.69 Exec. Order No. 14281, Restoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy, 90 FR 17537 (2025).70 Message from EEOC Acting Chair Lucas about Opening of 2024 EEO-1 Component Data Collection, (May 20, 2025), https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USEEOC/bulletins/3e1407f.©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLP EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION | 30Specifically, in the SEP, the EEOC has committed to focusing on the use of technology, AI, and machinelearning in job advertisements, recruiting, and hiring decisions. The SEP emphasizes an employer’suse of all technology (not just “automated systems”) in hiring and recruitment as an area strategicfocus. However, as a practical matter, Executive Order 14281 creates difficulties in investigating andmitigating against technology usage that unintentionally results in unlawful discrimination. The ExecutiveOrder directs the EEOC to take all “appropriate action” to eliminate disparate impact claims from itsenforcement regime.71 This includes dismissing litigation, withdrawing amicus briefs, ending investigations,and modifying or halting conciliation agreements and consent decrees that advance disparate impacttheories. Common tech-based hiring tools, such as algorithmic screen and coding tests, deploy faciallyneutral policies that appear objective but can contain data points that disproportionately excludecertain groups - thus making those deployments unlawful. Yet, the EEOC cannot pursue these claimsand comply with the executive order.To that end, Chair Lucas explicitly stated that the EEOC will “fully and robustly comply” with theexecutive order.72 Following its pronouncement, the EEOC removed from its website several technicalassistance documents and fact sheets that discuss AI compliance with various federal civil rightsstatutes. For example, the EEOC removed a May 2023 technical assistance document that discussedAI compliance under Title VII and encouraged employers to assess AI tools for adverse impact onprotected categories, irrespective of intent. The EEOC also removed a May 2022 technical assistancedocument issued to ensure that AI tools did not violate the ADA. Similarly, the EEOC withdrew aDecember 2024 fact sheet discussing wearable technology in the workplace. The EEOC has alsoeliminated the roles of many in-house statisticians and labor economists, both of which are criticalin developing and litigating claims of unintentional discrimination resulting from the use of AI andtechnology in hiring and recruiting decisions.In addition, on September 15, 2025, the EEOC issued a memorandum directing EEOC field offices toadministratively close all investigations of charges alleging disparate impact discrimination by September30, 2025. Pursuant to that memorandum, the EEOC closed its investigation of charges alleging adisparate impact theory, only and issued a right to sue letter on those charges. On October 20, 2025, aprivate plaintiff sued the EEOC for closing the investigation of her charge pursuant to that memorandum.In Cross v. EEOC, a former Amazon delivery driver filed a Title VII and ADEA disparate-impact chargealleging Amazon’s strict delivery quotas effectively denied bathroom breaks, which disproportionatelyaffected female workers. The EEOC dismissed the plaintiff’s charge pursuant to the September 15, 2025memorandum. The plaintiff sued the EEOC under the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing the closurepolicy is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law because Title VII and the ADEA require investigativeand conciliatory processes for such claims. Although the lawsuit is in its infancy, it is unlikely that asingle-plaintiff case will alter the EEOC’s enforcement priorities - particularly when those prioritiesare mandated by an executive order. However, the Cross case highlights how EO 14281 and the EEOC’scorresponding enforcement priorities will affect discrimination litigation involving technology in hiringand recruiting.While the EEOC has, historically, focused on recruiting and hiring, the EEOC’s shift away from disparateimpact claims creates an opportunity for private litigants to challenge the plethora of electronic toolsavailable to assist employers to find talent in challenging labor markets. However, it is unclear whetherthe private plaintiff’s bar will fill the void resulting from the EEOC’s absence. In the past, private plaintiffscounsel have been unwilling to champion large scale hiring cases due to cost and challenges identifyingpotential “victims.” Without agency support, private litigants will be forced to shoulder the burden ofcostly factual investigations and data assessments to prepare claims for litigation.71 Exec. Order No. 14281, Restoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy, 90 FR 17537 (2025).72 Message from EEOC Acting Chair Lucas about Opening of 2024 EEO-1 Component Data Collection, (May 20, 2025), https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USEEOC/bulletins/3e1407f.31 | EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION ©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLPEven prior to Executive Order 14281, the EEOC had not initiated litigation of its own to challenge anemployer’s use of artificial intelligence in the workplace. However, the EEOC did step into the fray byfiling an amicus brief in support of claims by a private plaintiff in Mobley v. Workday.73 In Mobley, theplaintiff alleges that Workday engaged in a pattern or practice of discriminatory job screening thatdisproportionately disqualifies African-Americans, individuals over 40, and individuals with disabilitiesfrom securing employment in violation of Title VII, Section 1981, the ADEA, the ADA, and California statelaw. Specifically, plaintiff alleges that Workday’s AI and algorithms are more likely to deny job applicantswho are African-American, over 40, and have a disability, and plaintiff asserted that Workday acted asan employment agency, or, in the alternative, as an indirect employer or agent of the employer. Mobleyseeks class certification.The district court granted Workday’s motion to dismiss Mobley’s original complaint but grantedthe plaintiff leave to amend his complaint. Workday again moved to dismiss. On this second roundof briefing, the EEOC submitted an amicus brief taking a novel position in support of Mobley’s classaction theory that an AI vendor could be directly liable under Title VII, the ADA, or the ADEA foremployment discrimination caused by the use of the vendor’s AI. Among other things, the EEOC arguedthat by actively making automated decisions to reject or advance candidates before referring themto employers, Workday functions as an employment agency under the law. In its amicus submission,the EEOC drew an analogy to IRS rules stating that tax preparation software can be considered atax preparer if the software does more than just provide “mere mechanical assistance.” So too withalgorithmic tools that go beyond that threshold in the employment context, according to the EEOC.The district court subsequently issued a split decision that allowed the plaintiff’s agency theoryto proceed, as supported by the EEOC in its amicus brief.74 The Court’s opinion emphasized theimportance of the “agency” theory in addressing potential enforcement gaps in our anti-discriminationlaws. In this regard, the Court illustrated the potential gaps with a hypothetical scenario: a softwarevendor intentionally creates a tool that automatically screens out applicants from historically blackcolleges and universities, unbeknownst to the employers using the software. Without the agency theory,the Court opined, no party could be held liable for this intentional discrimination. By construing federalanti-discrimination laws broadly and adapting traditional legal concepts to the evolving relationshipbetween AI service providers and employers, the Court’s decision was based, in part, on the desire toavoid potential loopholes in liability. By allowing the plaintiff’s agency theory to proceed, as supportedby the EEOC in its amicus brief, the ruling opens the door for a significant expansion of liability for AIvendors in the hiring process, with potential far-reaching implications for both AI service providersand for employers using those tools.The district court recently granted plaintiff’s request to conditionally certify a collective action basedon age. In its decision to conditionally certify the collective, t the court gave more weight to what theplaintiff claims that Workday products do than the evidence Workday presented to establish whatits products do, in fact. The plaintiff claims that Workday products make “recommendations” aboutwhether or not a candidate should be hired. For the court, that was enough to overcome Workday’sexplanations that its customers are responsible for setting hiring criteria and making decisions abouttheir applicants.The court includes brief discussion of the specific AI tools at issue, including Candidate Skills Match(“CSM”), Hired Score, Fetch, and Spotlight; however, for a majority of the opinion, the court refersgenerally to Workday’s “AI recommendation system,” without defining the term or discussing the73 See Rachel See, Annette Tyman, and Samantha Brooks, EEOC Argues Vendors Using Artificial Intelligence Tools Are Subject to Title VII, the ADAand ADEA Under Novel Theories in Workday Litigation, Workplace Class Action Blog (Apr. 29, 2024), https://www.seyfarth.com/news-insights/legalupdate-eeoc-argues-vendors-using-artificial-intelligence-tools-are-subject-to-title-vii-the-ada-and-adea-under-novel-theories-in-workday-litigation.html.74 See Rachel See and Annette Tyman, Mobley v. Workday: Court Holds AI Service Providers Could Be Directly Liable for Employment DiscriminationUnder “Agent” Theory, Workplace Class Action Blog (Jul. 19, 2024), https://www.seyfarth.com/news-insights/mobley-v-workday-court-holds-aiservice-providers-could-be-directly-liable-for-employment-discrimination-under-agent-theory.html.©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLP EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION | 32actual features of the purportedly problematic AI tools. The case is moving into the discovery phase,which will provide Workday with an opportunity to flesh out the mechanisms of its AI tools and establishthat the companies deploying Workday control the deployment and use of the AI tools, not Workday.The district court has also outlined the process to be followed to provide notice to members of theputative collective. Plaintiffs intend to disseminate notice via Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, GoogleSearch & Display, and X. The court did not entertain Defendants objections to this approach in itstentative ruling. However, plaintiffs’ approach could draw large amounts of negative attention toWorkday’s AI tools and increase skepticism around the use of AI tools in the hiring process, generally.Employers, HR vendors and service providers, and AI developers should take note because even thoughthe allegations in the amended complaint may not reflect the reality of how most employers are usingAI in hiring, the court’s decision to conditionally certify the collective is likely to embolden plaintiffs topursue similar claims.Against this backdrop, employers should be mindful that any charge of intentional discriminationfiled with the EEOC that mentions the use of artificial intelligence - or any other technology in hiring- will not only qualify for priority handling, but is also likely to receive additional scrutiny from EEOCmanagement. Conversely, employers need not worry about the EEOC advancing disparate impactclaims that mention the use of technology in hiring. However, the EEOC’s shift in enforcement prioritiesdoes not insulate employers from disparate impact claims brought by private plaintiffs. Employersshould also be mindful of state and local employment laws that recognize disparate impact liability.2. Other Technology in Hiring and the Path Ahead on AIImportantly, the EEOC signaled that it is focusing on all uses of technology in recruitment and hiring,not just artificial intelligence. In August 2023, the EEOC entered into a settlement agreement withiTutorGroup, which many media reports and commenters characterized as the EEOC’s “first ever”case involving artificial intelligence discrimination in hiring.However, according to the EEOC’s complaint, the underlying hiring technology simply asked jobapplicants for their date of birth and was configured to automatically reject female applicants aged55 or older and male applicants aged 60 or older. To be clear, automatically rejecting older jobapplicants, when their birthdates are already known, does not require any sort of artificial intelligenceor machine learning.75That said, it is entirely fair to say that the EEOC’s iTutorGroup complaint and settlement, as well asthe way the commission has characterized the lawsuit and settlement, squarely falls within the broaderscope of the EEOC’s greater scrutiny of all sorts of technology in hiring, even technology that doesnot involve artificial intelligence. The EEOC’s commitment to enforcement in the area of AI and othertechnology in hiring serves as a strong reminder that employers should be prepared to defend theiruse of technology in hiring, whether or not it might fall into any particular legal definition of “artificialintelligence.”In response to EEOC charges alleging that the use of AI or other technology is discriminatory, employersshould be prepared to explain to EEOC investigators what AI or other technology they have been usingin hiring or sourcing processes, and produce evidence that their processes are free of unlawful disparateimpact against protected groups. Also, if employers have not already had conversations with their AIvendors or in-house developers about the likelihood of scrutiny of these processes in enforcement actionsor litigation, in certain circumstance it could be an opportune time to take a deeper look at how technologyis being used in their own organization. In addition to conducting documented bias audits, companiesshould ensure its training reminds employees that technology usage must comply with federal and state75 https://www.seyfarth.com/news-insights/eeocs-settlement-challenging-simple-algorithm-provides-warning-for-employers-using-artificialintelligence.html33 | EEOC-INITIATED LITIGATION: 2026 EDITION ©2026 Seyfarth Shaw LLPcivil rights law. It may also be wise to document AI usage internally to stave off accusations of intentionaldiscrimination and monitor AI usage for disparate impact, which remains a litigation risk from theprivate plaintiffs’ bar.3. Job AdvertisementsThe EEOC’s SEP accentuates the risks associated with unlawfully targeted job advertisements, oradvertisements that otherwise deter people from specific protected groups from applying. Keyconcerns include advertisements shown exclusively to certain age groups, genders, or racialdemographics, and the use of platforms that filter or prioritize candidates based on protectedtraits. Employers are held accountable for discriminatory outcomes, even when utilizing third-partyplatforms or automated systems, with liability potentially arising from the use of biased algorithmsor targeting tools. This focus includes both intentional exclusion and unintentional disparate impact.Although, the trend under the Trump Administration has been to move away from advancing adisparate impact theory.The EEOC’s emphasis in the SEP also includes job advertisements posted in traditional media that mightcontain discriminatory language, as well as issues involving algorithmic targeting of job advertisements.Additionally, there is a focus on restrictive application processes or systems that are inaccessible ormore challenging for individuals with disabilities or other protected groups.4. Job Segregation or Steering Based on Protected CharacteristicsJob segregation and steering issues have been a consistent focus in the SEP since 2017 and remain apriority in the 2024 - 2028 SEP. Charges and litigation in this category could involve practices suchas steering women away from certain positions, channeling workers onto certain shifts, or assigningworkers to certain positions based on a protected class. However, as with other hiring categories inthe SEP, there is also a technology angle, with the EEOC expressing potential heightened interest incharges involving technology that applies—with or without AI—allegedly discriminatory steering orsegregation, such as by suggesting jobs for which an applicant or employee is well-matched.In September 2024, the EEOC filed a lawsuit in federal court against Mile Hi Foods and its relatedcompanies, alleging sex, race, and national origin discrimination in hiring. The complaint claims thatsince at least 2015, Mile Hi Foods has discriminated against applicants who are female, Black, or ofAfghan heritage. The EEOC is currently in litigation and seeks to identify class members who may havebeen subjected to unlawful discrimination in hiring.76In September 2024, the EEOC sued a regional restaurant chain, alleging that it had a policy or practiceof intentionally failing to hire male applicants for front-of-house positions because of their sex.77According to the EEOC’s complaint, the policy or practice impacted hiring and resulted in segregationby sex in 19 restaurant locations.The EEOC also resolved several complaints involving allegations of segregation in 2024. In April 2024,the EEOC announced that it had settled a complaint that drivers were assigned different routes,given heavier dock work, and segregated based on race.78 In August 2024, the EEOC announced thatit had settled a complaint that included allegations the employer had segregated jobs based on sex.79In September 2024, the EEOC announced that it had reached a settlement to end litigation alleging thatan employer had used multiple secret phrases and techniques when requesting temporary employees76 See EEOC v.

In February2025, the EEOC filed a lawsuit against Leo Palace Resort, a hotel in Guam, alleging that the resortengaged in discriminatory practices by providing employees of non-Japanese origin with less favorablewages, benefits, and other terms of employment compared to their Japanese counterparts.81 TheEEOC announced that it had settled the complaint.82 In September 2025, the EEOC sued Seward andSon Planting Company, an agricultural employer, alleging that the employer discriminated by engagingin job segregation by favoring non-Black, non-American H-2A visa holders over Black, Americanfarmworkers.83 The case settled shortly after the EEOC filed the action.845. Focus Area: Shifts in Enforcement for Underrepresented GroupsWhile the SEP remains in place for now, the focus on protections for the expanded definition of“vulnerable groups” has shifted.85 The EEOC announced that it is returning to its “mission ofprotecting women from sexual harassment and sex-based discrimination in the workplace byrolling back the Biden administration’s gender identity agenda.” Although, the EEOC may beshifting its priorities on enforcement, the Supreme Court decision extending prohibitions onsex discrimination and harassment to lesbian, gay, and trans individuals remains.86The current SEP highlight the underrepresentation of women and workers of color in certain industriessuch as construction, manufacturing, finance, and high-tech/STEM. In line with the SEP, on September 11,2024, the EEOC issued a report entitled High Tech, Low Inclusion: Diversity in the High Tech Workforceand Sector 2014-2022, which analyzes “demographic disparities for workers in 56 science, technology,engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupations and the industries employing them.” 87 Although theEEOC’s press release announcing the report remains publicly available, the report itself has since beenremoved from the EEOC’s website. In this press release, the EEOC stated, “Given its findings, the reportrecommends that high tech companies proactively examine barriers limiting employment for women,older workers, Black workers, and Hispanic workers.” However, to be more in line with the TrumpAdministration’s priorities, the EEOC has clarified that affirmative Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion effortsmay be unlawful.88 The EEOC provides examples such as, limiting membership in workplace groups tocertain protected groups. Employers should allow employees of all backgrounds to have equal access tothese workplace groups.The EEOC also clarified that minority group or reverse discrimination is not allowed even if theemployer can demonstrate a “business necessity.” 89 However, employers may still raise a bona fidoccupational qualification as an affirmative defense to excuse hiring or classifying an individual based80 See U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Aaron Thomas Company to Pay $450,000 to Settle EEOC Race Discrimination Lawsuit (Sept.27, 2024), https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/aaron-thomas-company-pay-450000-settle-eeoc-race-discrimination-lawsuit.81 See EEOC v.
