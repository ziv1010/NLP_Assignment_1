  "body_text": "Newly crowned Africa Player of The Year Victor Osimhen has said the controversial Tik-Tok video which caused an uproar about his relationship with his club Napoli was a ‘stupid mistake’ from someone and not a bad treatment from the club.\nThe Napoli striker cleared the air after winning the 2023 CAF POTY award in Marrakech, Morocco. His award was Nigeria’s first since Nwankwo Kanu won it in 1999 just as Super Falcons forward Asisat Oshoala was crowned Women’s Player of The Year for a record-extending sixth time.\nOsimhen was the subject of mockery a few weeks ago after the club’s admin on TikTok released two controversial videos with one mocking the Super Eagles striker following his penalty miss against Bologna.\nThis led to criticisms of Napoli by Nigerian football fans who believed their star player was treated badly.\nDuring the post-event interview, Osimhen reiterated that the matter was handled very well by the club.\n“I want to correct an impression here, Napoli didn’t treat me badly,” Osimhen told journalists in Marrakech, Morocco.\n“It was a stupid mistake from an individual and I wasn’t happy about it. Aurelio De Laurentiis (Napoli President) took charge of the situation and stood with me. I spoke to the individual and he was remorseful. I am happy with that.”\nAfter helping Napoli win the Serie A last season for the first time in 33 years by scoring 26 goals, Osimhen has continued his fine form this season and despite being halted by an injury, he has scored six goals and one assist in 11 league appearances.\nBut the defending champions have slowed down this season, currently sixth in Serie A with 24 points after 15 matches but they will also look to advance to the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League.",
