  "body_text": "The TV commercial surfaces nearly every year during the men’s and women’s basketball NCAA Tournaments.\n“There are over 400,000 NCAA student-athletes,” a voiceover says, “and most of us will go pro in something other than sports.”\nThe ad, featuring a variety of sports and sponsored by the NCAA, reminds fans that only a small portion of college athletes — 2% — compete professionally in their sport. But college athletics, it says, teaches the discipline, character and determination needed to be successful in all areas of life.\nFormer star athletes Thomas Amabile and siblings Will and Jennifer Byrd are the embodiment of that theme. Athletics helped mold them for their profession as doctors.\n“College athletes must have the discipline to wake up at 6 a.m. and get to the gym before class,” said Will Byrd. “They have to have the discipline to go straight to practice right after class. They have to have the discipline to not go out the night before a big sporting event.\n“These are things that are taught along the way that are intangibles for life. And athletics is where you get your intangibles.”\nDr. Will Byrd always knew he wanted to go into medicine.\nAfter all, it was in his blood.\nHis great-great-grandfather was a country physician in North Carolina, while his grandfather ran a private practice in Norfolk and his grandmother was a registered nurse.\nHis father, Abbott, practiced orthopedic surgery for more than three decades at Atlantic Orthopaedic Specialists in Virginia Beach. His mother, Allison, was an internal medicine physician.\n“How many boys grow up and see what their dad does and want to follow?” he said. “For me, it was half that and half my love for science, then my love to be able to fix things and problem solve.”\nByrd was a star pole vaulter and decathlete at Norfolk Academy.\n“I used to like to say, ‘I was good at everything and great at nothing,’ ” said Byrd, who cleared 15 feet, 3 inches in the pole vault and competed at the prestigious Penn Relays in Philadelphia.\nByrd was an All-American vaulter and chose to attend Princeton, where he was named All-Ivy League in the decathlon and pole vault. He also was captain of the track team.\n“My athletic ability allowed me and helped to get into a very academically challenging school,” he said. “I had decent grades in high school. But my athletic ability allowed me to go to a school that I might not have otherwise had the opportunity to go to. For me it was a priority to use my athletic abilities to give me an opportunity to go to a good school to become a doctor.”\nSports helped form that determination and work ethic he would need in medical school.\n“The one thing I loved about track and field is there is no place to hide,” he said. “If you don’t show up to perform that day, everyone is going to see it. So, it’s like the hard work behind the scenes. And then the day of the meet — or the big test day at med school — that’s when it’s your time to shine.”\nHe earned his medical degree at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine in Richmond, his orthopedic residency at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and a fellowship in adult reconstruction surgery at the Southern Joint Replacement Institute in Nashville, Tennessee.\nHe is now an orthopedic surgeon at his father’s former practice, Atlantic Orthopaedic Specialists, and specializes in sports medicine and arthroscopic surgery.\nHe says his greatest thrill was having the chance to work with his father — and sister — at the practice before his father retired.\n“He hung on long enough for Jen and myself to come back and join his practice,” Byrd said. “It was cool. I think it was definitely something that he wanted, to work with his kids for a couple of years.”\n“It was great,” Abbott Byrd said. “Everyone wants to see their children succeed.”\nAbbott believes sports were a key in both his children becoming doctors.\n“I think the sports was more important than the book learning,” he said. “It teaches them teamwork, hard work, perseverance and how to be good losers. But I think the sports is extremely important, particularly in the surgical field, where it is a team. The surgeon has a big support system behind them with the anesthesiologists, nurses and the people in the recovery room. The surgeon is the captain of the team, but you got to have a team to do it. Sports is crucial.”\nWill Byrd, 39, met his wife Rachel in med school. She’s a dermatologist. They have two children, Claire and Jackson.\n“I love my job,” he said. “I’m so blessed to do what I do. I don’t think I could be a doctor if I couldn’t do exactly what I’m doing right now,” he said. “I just love fixing things. I love the hands-on nature of what I do. It’s so rewarding. I have a tailored skill that only a few people have. I have the ability to help a guy and change his life.”\nDr. Jennifer Byrd took a much different path into medicine.\nLike her younger brother, Jennifer also was a star athlete at Norfolk Academy, competing in soccer, field hockey and track and field. She was named The Virginian Pilot’s Female Athlete of the Year as a senior.\nShe also went to Princeton and competed in track and field and earned All-Ivy League honors and set a school record in the long jump that stood for more than 20 years. She also was team captain as a senior.\nUnlike her brother, Jennifer didn’t seek to become a doctor. She majored in economics, but really loved chemistry and science, thinking her track schedule made it difficult to fully get into medicine.\n“I didn’t feel like I had time to excel at both,” she said. “So, I went the economics route, because I was like, this will be versatile for anything.”\nAfter graduation, she worked in consulting in New York for a couple of years, but admittedly wasn’t passionate about it.\n“That’s when I said, ‘I want to do something. I want to help people. I want to have a skill or a talent.’ “\nSo she returned to Virginia and took a few prerequisite courses for the Medical College Admission Test and worked for Bon Secours while she applied for med school.\nShe earned her medical degree from the VCU School of Medicine and went on to complete her orthopedic surgery residency at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. She completed an additional year of fellowship training in orthopedic sports medicine for advanced training in arthroscopic surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, where she served as a team physician for two local colleges, the Cleveland Cavaliers and the then-Cleveland Indians.\n“I guess it came by kind of naturally,” she said. “The way we were raised was very hands on. Do it yourself, fix it, make it work. So very problem solving, mechanical brain. So certainly it was going to be surgery as opposed to medicine discipline. And then it was just orthopedics working with the athletes fractures. Just more of fixing things and putting things back together.”\nLearning that only 6% of practicing orthopedic surgeons are females also drove her.\n“I always loved beating the boys on the soccer field,” she said. “And when I ran track in high school, I did my workouts with the boys and it was fun beating them. So, there’s always that innate competition.”Byrd, 42, also now practices at Atlantic Orthopaedic Specialists and specializes in ACL and knee ligament reconstruction, meniscus repair, cartilage repair, rotator cuff repair and shoulder labral repair.\nShe admits there are long hours and unpredictable schedules. She said she couldn’t do it without the support of her husband, Tim Paice.They have three children — Charlotte, and twins Audrey and Henry.\nLike her brother, she loves what she does.\nThe best part?\n“Having a really good surgical outcome, like textbook where everything goes perfect and it looks absolutely beautiful,” she said. “Or taking something that’s an exploded disaster and making sense out of it, and putting it back together and seeing them get back to their passions.”\nShe also works with Norfolk Public Schools and also provides coverage for ODU women’s basketball home games and Norfolk Academy home football games.\n“It just makes us so proud of them and what they’ve accomplished,” Norfolk Academy athletic director Chad Byler said of Jennifer and Will. “They were such great athletes and just great people when they were here at Norfolk Academy as student-athletes. To see them go off to college and be successful at the next level, and then come back and give back to the community, it’s just amazing.”\nThomas Amabile has always wanted to work in the medical field.\nLike the Byrds, Amabile’s parents — Anthony and Mary — are in the medical field.\n“My dad is a doctor, so that was always kind of in the back of my mind,” he said. “And my mom is a registered dietician. So I’ve always been interested in health, whether that’s health in sports or health in nutrition, or just seeing what my dad did all the time.“\nAt Grassfield High in Chesapeake, Amabile was an all-state, all-region and all-district performer in cross country and track. He also was named the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame Scholar-Athlete of the Year and Chesapeake Sports Club Cross Country Runner of the Year.\nHe wanted to continue running at a high level, so he went to the University of Virginia, where he was twice on the ACC Academic Honor Roll. After two seasons, he transferred to George Mason University, and was a third-team All-American and All-Atlantic 10.\n“When I was at the Virginia, I was a lot more focused on athletics,” he said. “But I think what was really good for me was transferring. I started taking my future a lot more serious because I wasn’t going to be running the rest of my life. And I thought about what do I really want to do. That’s when I really figured out that I wanted to do medicine. I wasn’t sure what in medicine, but I know I wanted to do it.”\nAmabile, 28, is now in his third year at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk.\nWith an already demanding schedule, he got involved with Run Your City, which gives college students an opportunity to lead running practices and races for kids of all abilities.\n“We talk about positivity, we talk about goal setting, teamwork, sportsmanship overall well-being with the kids,” he said. “It’s awesome. It really brings balance to my life.”\nAfter med school, Amabile will do his residency.\nGrassfield cross country and track coach Mike Sauer said he always knew Amabile would be successful in whatever profession he chose, but knew being doctor was in his future.\n“When we talked about the future and his goals, he always wanted to be a physician,” he said.\nSo, he’s not surprised to hear Amabile is flourishing. He could see signs in high school.\n“I have some runners who want to take the challenge of taking rigorous classes, and that’s how Thomas was,” he said. “He was just willing to put in the work. Some people are willing to do that, and some just aren’t. Some say they want to be a doctor. And I’m just so happy that he’s actually made it happen for himself.”",
