  "body_text": "You cannot discuss 2000s Hip-Hop without recognizing 50 Cent and G-Unit, and anyone who would argue with this fact simply shouldn’t discuss music ever again.\nThe label and collective impacted radio stations, television shows, movie screens, video games, fashion, and even beverages. Not to mention, all of their feuds. Of course, Fif was at the helm, but he assembled a crew of gritty wordsmiths who also had a penchant for appealing to women and making hits.\nLet’s not waste time with this list and quickly get to brass tax: ranking G-Unit singles is a tall task. It’s not just because of the number of major records they put out, but deciding what songs are better than others, traveling back in time to remember their impact, finding a balanced way to factor in sales without letting that statistic completely drive the list, and being okay leaving certain songs on the cutting room floor. Thus, here we are, 36 ranked G-Unit singles that were put out by both individual acts and the collective as a whole.\nWhile we’re well aware that fans will never fully agree with any ranked list, we hope that you enjoy heading back to that era and appreciate the greatness that this crew brought to the game. Happy — or angry — reading, and we’ll see you at No. 1!\n-\n50 Cent Feat. Joe – “Big Rich Town” (2014)\nAlright, so “Big Rich Town” probably won’t mean much to you if you haven’t watched Power, but you probably still, somehow, know the song. It has staying power simply because of how long the show went on, how popular the show was, and the constant pop culture references made to the catchy theme song. It was also nice to see 50 Cent and Joe link up again, with Joe being one of G-Unit‘s favorite R&B voices to feature on their tracks. It would feel disrespectful to place this above anything else that will be on the list, but it is highly regarded by many, so it feels appropriate to include among the collective’s best tracks.\n-\n50 Cent Feat. Young Buck – “I’ll Whip Ya Head Boy” (2006)\n“I’ll Whip Ya Head Boy” was the least successful song from the Get Rich Or Die Tryin’ soundtrack, but still became a mantra for its infectious hook, so what do the numbers really mean, anyway? 50 Cent had a knack for conceiving a chorus that stuck with you, and this song is another piece of evidence. Young Buck and M.O.P, the latter of whom only appear on the remix, performed well, but admittedly this song’s longevity is driven by the refrain and its elaborate descriptions of their mindsets when considering robbing someone. It captures the essence of getting rich or dying trying.\n-\nOlivia Feat. Lloyd Banks – “Twist It” (2005)\nOlivia’s run in G-Unit was short-lived, but they put her to work and generated solid results. One under-sung gem in her time with the label was “Twist It” featuring Lloyd Banks. The beat is pretty bad listening to it now, and Banks’ verse wasn’t much to write home about, but Olivia makes it a worthwhile listen. She uses a fun, nursery rhyme flow in the bridge, too. Another record people likely forgot about, it had a moment on the various music video-themed shows on BET.\n-\nG-Unit Feat. Joe – “Wanna Get To Know You” (2003)\nG-Unit showed the world they could get into their love song bag early with 2003’s “Wanna Get To Know You” featuring Joe. It may not be the biggest or most memorable love song to come from the collective, or even to come from their debut album, Beg For Mercy (more on that later), but a smooth hook from Joe and three strong verses from 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, and Young Buck warrant this song’s placement on the list. In a time where R&B was on fire, they produced a record that even the toughest men couldn’t help but ride around to.\n-\nThe Game – “Put You On The Game” (2005)\nThe Game signing to G-Unit was like the Golden State Warriors signing Kevin Durant; the group was already rock solid, and adding the bubbling West Coast star yielded them an embarrassment of riches. His debut album The Documentary had five impactful singles, and while “Put You On The Game” wasn’t one of the biggest, it still made its mark. The record prompted the most aggressive chickenhead routine, but not at the expense of bare knuckled lyricism. The Game couldn’t miss a shot even if he tried at this time, and this song was further proof. It is one of the reasons why The Documentary is so lauded to this day, though some tracks stand above it.\n-\nG-Unit – “Poppin Them Thangs” (2003)\n“Poppin Them Thangs” was another single from G-Unit‘s debut album, Beg For Mercy. It was yet another example of the magic that 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, and Young Buck could make together over a beat with a nice bop and captivating piano keys. Add in their ruthless bars and palpable swagger, and there is no denying that they had another banger.\n-\nLloyd Banks – “I’m So Fly” (2004)\nSometimes, you have to claim your flyness for yourself. Lloyd Banks did just that on his 2004 single “I’m So Fly,” which certainly appealed to all who utilized that lingo in that era. The sonics matched the claim, as the record was just a bit faster than mid-tempo, and his delivery all through the song felt very firm. Being fly is all about letting it speak for itself, but he added in the proclamation to make it clear how he viewed himself.\n-\nG-Unit Feat. Young Buck – “I Like The Way She Do It” (2008)\nYoung Buck may have left G-Unit as of 2008, but the chemistry between him and his former comrades still existed, evident in “I Like The Way She Do It.” G-Unit was years into their run, but they knew one thing: keeping the women on their side would keep them afloat. The record was all about paying homage to the ladies and how well they did what they did. They have better, more popular examples, but “I Like The Way She Do It” was a 30-point game years into their career as a collective, when people may have doubted how much further it could go.\n-\n50 Cent – “Hustler’s Ambition” (2005)\n“Hustler’s Ambition” is so special. It is 50 Cent slightly shedding the bravado to wax on about his work ethic and not letting anyone get in his way, which was fitting as it was the lead single for the Get Rich Or Die Tryin’ movie soundtrack. While he had endlessly told his story before this song and movie, “Hustler’s Ambition” felt like his true mantra. It may not be his biggest hit or best song, but the way it embodies the 50 Cent character and Curtis Jackson the man makes it a must-listen for anyone getting introduced to him.\n-\nThe Game – “Dreams” (2005)\n“Dreams” by The Game was a powerful record, reflecting on his gunshot-induced coma and how it powered his journey to success. This single was far from a club banger or radio anthem — though it did secure quite a few spins — but it was the quintessential Game record due to how in-depth he got. It was less about lyrical exhibition and more about storytelling, and the Jerry Butler “No Money Down” sample likely plays on a loop in people’s heads to this day.\n-\nG-Unit Feat. Young Buck – “Rider Pt. 2” (2008)\nIt would be foolish to call “Rider Pt. 2” one of G-Unit‘s best hooks, but it is up there and certainly memorable. “I done told you, boy, I’m a soldier, boy/ I got no choice but to be a rider/ I approach you, boy, with the toaster, boy/ Hit you point blank range and fire,” 50 Cent spits with autotune altering his voice. Once again, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, and Young Buck brought their A-game and they showed they were as threatening as ever in 2008, even if the collective wasn’t at full power on paper.\n-\nThe Game – “Higher” (2005)\n“Higher” felt like a heat check single for The Game, as he already had two massive singles from his 2005 album The Documentary but still felt compelled to drop this record. One of the best parts was his prideful declaration of “Who the f**k y’all thought was comin’ after Young Buck?” It has an amazing beat, impeccable rapping, and an unavoidable bounce. The charts may not reflect it, but this song is canon for the Compton rapper.\n-\nTony Yayo Feat. G-Unit – “I Know You Don’t Love Me” (2005)\nAnother appreciable element of G-Unit was their awareness. Tony Yayo’s “I Know You Don’t Love Me,” featuring his label comrades was all about calling out the groupies who are all over them until another rapper is around. They were all about preserving the safety and success of their clique and made that clear over this record. Having 50 Cent handle the hook and Yayo, Lloyd Banks, and Young Buck rap individual verses was a cheat code. This may be another cult favorite, but the last word is the most important.\n-\nLloyd Banks Feat. Kanye West, Swizz Beatz, Ryan Leslie & Fabolous – “Start It Up” (2010)\n“Start It Up” still holds up well, but it was especially major in 2010. It was a unique posse cut as Lloyd Banks tapped Ye (formerly Kanye West) and Fabolous for verses, Swizz Beatz for the chorus and a small verse, and Ryan Leslie for a small bridge. This record didn’t reach crazy heights commercially, but it was a constant on the radio and likely soundtracked many football highlight videos at that time: specifically, linebackers making crazy tackles in between its chilling synths. The phrase “start it up” is so simple, yet so powerful. Not to mention, West had a few funny lines and probably the most memorable verse here. We can call “Start It Up” a cult favorite that a lot of you readers probably forgot about, and are now reflecting on when and where you first heard it.\n-\nG-Unit – “Smile” (2003)\n50 Cent is one of the best artist-turned-executives because he knew when to step back and let others shine. “Smile” was the ideal canvas for him to call Joe or Olivia and sing all over, but he allowed Lloyd Banks to be the main voice on this hood love song and only added sparse backup vocals. Banks took the baton and ran with it with a strong performance. Of course, they’ve got bigger and better “lover boy” songs in their arsenal, but Banks deserves his flowers for carrying this track.\n-\nLloyd Banks Feat. Juelz Santana – “Beamer, Benz or Bentley” (2010)\nG-Unit‘s prime was well over by 2010, but Lloyd Banks still put together a song that resonated alongside Juelz Santana with “Beamer, Benz, or Bentley.” It had a simple, catchy hook, both New York rappers delivered on their verses, and there was one line that was funnier than it was probably intended to be. “And she always ready to give me that Becky/ Last time it was so good I almost crashed my Bentley,” Santana rapped. They spent more time rapping about all of their other luxuries and pulling women than the actual cars, but nobody really took issue with it. Is it a classic song? Maybe.\n-\nYoung Buck – “Shorty Wanna Ride” (2004)\nYoung Buck excelled at making car-friendly music, which made “Shorty Wanna Ride” a fitting single from his debut album Straight Outta Cashville. The synths, drums, and hi-hats were very much of that 2004 era, as southern music continued to take over, but it all ages well listening back in 2025. His lovable southern drawl only added to the auditory experience. One can just picture someone flexing in a candy paint, woodgrain whip with this blaring. Add in a nice lady and you’ve lived up to what “Shorty Wanna Ride” wants you to.\n-\nLloyd Banks – “On Fire” (2004)\nLloyd Banks kept a banger on him, too! “On Fire” was a moment in 2004, and aptly named. He didn’t sacrifice his lyrical ability, but he was able to create an anthem that prompted people to chant “What you say?” in the hook and threaten fire alarms all across New York.\n-\nLloyd Banks Feat. Avant – “Karma” (2004)\nThere is a reason there are several quotes made about karma: it is real. Lloyd Banks and Avant displayed that on “Karma,” a beloved Hip-Hop/R&B collaboration in 2004. Avant was one of the go-to hook men at the time and complimented the MC perfectly as Banks took up the leading man-mantle and knocked it out of the park.\n-\n50 Cent – “Disco Inferno” (2004)\n50 Cent showed how much he respected the club and women’s fun on “Disco Inferno,” encourging women to freely shake what their mothers gave them and for men to not cause issues. This record was the launchpad for a string of hits that came from his 2005 album The Massacre, and may be an underrated lyrical performance in his catalog simply because of how party-focused the song was. That is how good the G-Unit leader was at making hits.\n-\n50 Cent – “Window Shopper” (2005)\n50 Cent‘s sh*t talking ability was top tier, and “Window Shopper” is one of the best examples. He spent essentially three minutes calling people out who tried to live a lifestyle that they could not maintain due to financial deficiencies. Because, yeah, who told you to put a G up at the dice game? It was equally down-putting as it was inspirational. What will you do to turn yourself from a dream buyer to an actual buyer? Not to mention, as said many times on this list, what a great beat!\n-\n50 Cent Feat. Mobb Deep – “Outta Control (Remix)” (2005)\nIf you thought G-Unit couldn’t get any stronger in the 2000s, they signed Mobb Deep and M.O.P. to show the true depth of their powers. The former joined 50 Cent on the “Outta Control (Remix),” which can only be described is audible water. The beat is incredibly smooth, and the trio turned in some of the coolest verses one could ever rap. Special shoutout goes to Havoc for demanding that he see IDs to ensure he was in the club with grown folk, and, of course, rest in peace to Prodigy.\n-\n50 Cent Feat. Olivia – “Best Friend (Remix)” (2006)\n50 Cent and Olivia might have started the commonly used, flirting question, “Your man don’t let you have friends?” with 2005’s “Best Friend.” Calling this dirty macking would be reductive, as the duo more so displayed the impenetrable type of love that makes one want to ensure that someone is theirs and theirs alone. Flipping Biz Markie’s “Just A Friend” track, they make sure the coast is clear and they can live their love to the fullest. Fif was far from a singer, but he held his own alongside G-Unit‘s short-term songstress. And with that came another timeless love song from the collective.\n-\nYoung Buck – “Get Buck” (2007)\nYoung Buck’s “Get Buck” will forever be remembered for the amazing vocal sample, triumphant production, and using part of his rap name to make a hit. Not to mention, he claimed he could “serve Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown,” which is commonly said in rap, but doesn’t make it any less crazy. The best part is that this was a solo track, in case anyone doubted his mettle to make hits away from 50 Cent and his G-Unit comrades. This record rattled car trunks in 2007 and still sounds good in 2025. The fact it falls so “low” on this list is just evidence of all G-Unit had to offer in and out of their prime.\n-\n50 Cent – “Just A Lil Bit” (2005)\n2005’s “Just A Lil Bit” was a lesson in moderation and gratitude. 50 Cent wasn’t asking whatever lady he was talking to for all of her, but just a dose of what she had to offer. He cleverly flipped the “lil bit” phrase to sometimes mean portions and other times to be a measurement of time in what was a great chorus. You add in the undeniable, layered production, and it is no surprise that this song took off the way it did. As a No. 3 single on the Billboard Hot 100, it is safe to say “Just A Lil Bit” achieved more than just a “lil bit” of success.\n-\n50 Cent – “I Get Money” (2007)\nThere actually isn’t much to say about “I Get Money.” It is the epitome of an anthem, a mantra, a motivational record, a flex, so on and so forth. There are endless quotables on this track and it was the most straightforward way to describe what 50 Cent was, and is, all about throughout his career. It oozed New York energy to the fullest and still rings off to this day.\n-\nG-Unit – “Stunt 101” (2003)\n“Stunt 101” was so good that one can imagine even the least swaggy person not being offended by them calling out those who aren’t fly and threatening to hurt them in the chorus. It was another rap clinic for 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, and Young Buck, coming from G-Unit‘s debut album Beg For Mercy. The beat may be the best part, as it is just slow enough to dance to calmly but immersive enough to blast at full volume with the windows open on a nice drive. That’s how you teach someone how to stunt.\n-\n50 Cent Feat. Olivia – “Candy Shop” (2005)\n“Candy Shop” is undoubtedly 50 Cent and Olivia’s best collaboration. Fif dug into his lovey-dovey bag previously, but this 2005 hit was him showing he could explicitly describe sex without getting too graphic. There was still some calmness to him, to not be too overbearing. Olivia plays a great sidekick here, assisting the hook and post-chorus. And those opening notes of the song? Masterful.\n-\n50 Cent – “Wanksta” (2002)\nOne of the most foolproof methods of hitmaking, when done right, is popularizing new lingo that sticks. 50 Cent hit the mark with 2002’s “Wanksta,” providing people a new way to call out someone who thinks they’re a “gangsta” yet is anything but. Nevermind the menacing production and the infections “Damn, homie, in high school you was the man homie,” call-and-response, right? Wrong. “Wanksta” was excellent and will always be known for setting the table for what was to come in 2003.\n-\nThe Game Feat. 50 Cent – “How We Do” (2004)\n50 Cent and The Game — what a duo.\n“How We Do” was musically excellent in all aspects. Can one recall how crazy it was to hear Fif say he put Lamborghini doors on an Escalade and then see it in the music video? These two presented themselves as titans and lived up to the hype with their collaborations. Though “How We Do” may not be the biggest or best, it was no slouch.\n-\n50 Cent – “P.I.M.P.” (2003)\nChallenge: Walk up to 10 people on the street, recite the line “I don’t know what you heard about me,” and count how many properly respond with “But a chick can’t get a dollar out of me.” If there is any hope for this world, then more than six people will be triggered to do so, proving that 50 Cent created a Pavlovian response with the chorus of his hit single “P.I.M.P.” Beyond that, the swagger he displayed over the beachy production and its variance from his other Get Rich Or Die Tryin’ singles further proved the force to be reckoned with that he was. This track is a classic in every sense.\n-\n50 Cent Feat. The Madd Rapper – “How To Rob” (1999)\n“How To Rob” is why charts could not be the sole driving force of this list. Long before 50 Cent was a Billboard chart-recognized hitmaker, he had the streets and music industry fearful of what he would become. This record showed his willingness to dip into the villain bag while maintaining his charm and humor, as he elaborately described the ways he would stick up all of the biggest names in music. It was ruthless and shocking, but so authentic to his nature. The Queens rapper has said whatever to whoever for his entire career, and it all began with this warning shot in 1999.\n-\nTony Yayo Feat. 50 Cent – “So Seductive” (2005)\n“So Seductive” is one of the most hard-hitting records about women making men horny that Hip-Hop has ever seen. Tony Yayo and 50 Cent weaved in and out of each other’s verses and tag-teamed the chorus with ease. Yayo shined on the track, and Fif played a great sidekick, yielding one of the best songs of 2005. When people discuss beats that made them make a mean face, “So Seductive” should be on that list.\n-\nThe Game Feat. 50 Cent – “Hate It Or Love It” (2005)\nThis may sound hyperbolic, but if aliens came down and wanted an introduction to Hip-Hop, one of the songs I’d suggest playing is “Hate It Or Love It.” There is everything one could want in a record here: great verses, memorable punchlines, a simple yet strong hook, and beautiful production. 50 Cent and The Game were a match made in heaven, and, unfortunately, their collaborative relationship couldn’t last longer. Nonetheless, the duo gave us a lot in a short period and “Hate It Or Love It” stands above all of the work they did together.\n-\n50 Cent – “In Da Club” (2003)\nSome people may debate if “In Da Club” is 50 Cent‘s best song, but I think its spot as his most important song ever is slightly less debatable. After all, the track made it up to the Super Bowl halftime stage in 2022 during a performance that was catered primarily to the West Coast. He created a new way to wish someone a happy birthday, took over radio stations, and gave the world a teaser of the type of hitmaker he would go on to be. That said, it is probably shocking to you all that this song falls at No. 2 on this list. It was No. 1 on the charts and in many people’s hearts, but for us, there’s just one song better.\n-\n50 Cent Feat. Nate Dogg – “21 Questions” (2003)\nWhat more is there to be said about “21 Questions”? It is one of the most timeless records to come out of the 2000s, displaying 50 Cent‘s palpably effortless ability to go pop without leaning into any of the assumed elements of the genre. The late Nate Dogg will live forever in the annals of Hip-Hop and R&B for his countless contributions, and part of his legend will be assisting the G-Unit leader in fluidly showing off the loverboy within. It partially feels like sacrilege to place this song above the monster that was “In Da Club,” but hard decisions have to be made sometimes. “21 Questions” is perfect in every way, and it is hard to imagine a time when this song doesn’t get played in various settings or referenced when discussing rappers who didn’t shy away from being vulnerable and endearing.",
