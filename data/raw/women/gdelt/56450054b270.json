The Kangaroos took a three goal lead into the half-time break.\nMt Eliza refused to go down without a fight, and kept hanging in there. Langwarrin proved too good though – the Kangaroos beat the Redlegs 9.9 (63) to 8.5 (53).\nA loss would have proved a near-fatal blow to the Kangaroo’s finals aspirations. The win leaves Langwarrin in sixth place, equal on points with Mt Eliza. The Redlegs enjoy a big percentage advantage with two rounds left to play.\nRosebud effectively confirmed their top place finish on Saturday with a comfortable win over Frankston YCW.\nThe Stonecats came into the contest at John Coburn Oval in second place, but they proved no match for the ladder leaders. Rosebud thumped Frankston YCW 4.12 (36) to 16.10 (106).\nMitchell White, Callum White, Lachlan Williams, Jackson McRae, and Reid Nanscawen were Rosebud’s best. White kicked five goals.\nEdithvale-Aspendale cemented its top five spot with a win over Pines at home on Saturday. Edi-Asp won 15.14 (104) to 12.11 (83).\nAround the grounds, Mornington beat Red Hill by 67 points at Alexandra Park, and Dromana beat Sorrento by 22 points at David MacFarlan Reserve.\nMEN’S DIV TWO\nSOMERVILLE picked up an upset win over Pearcedale to stay in the hunt for finals on Saturday.\nPearcedale have been among the better teams in Division Two this year. They hosted Somerville at Pearcedale Recreation Reserve in what would go on to be a close match.\nBoth sides kicked five goals each in a free-flowing first term. In the second, Somerville opened up a 13-point lead.\nPearcedale made a last push in the final term, but Somerville was able to hold on. Somerville won 12.5 (77) to 13.6 (84).\nKai Suparta, Joel Vincent, Lochie Fewster, Lachlan Gill-Renouf, and Zane Martin were Somerville’s best. The result leaves them in sixth place, behind Chelsea and Devon Meadows by percentage only with one game left to play. They face a tough task this weekend though against ladder leaders Frankston Bombers.\nChelsea and Devon Meadows faced off at Chelsea Recreation Reserve on Saturday. Devon Meadows emerged victorious by 10 points – 11.13 (79) to 13.11 (89).\nFrankston Bombers returned to their winning ways on Saturday. After falling to their first defeat of the season at the hands of Crib Point the week prior, they thumped Seaford by 90 points. Tyson Barry and Jai Block kicked six goals each.\nThirty-eight goals were kicked at RJ Rowley Reserve on Saturday afternoon as Rye hosted Tyabb.\nThe Yabbies surged out to an early lead with an eight-goals-to-two start, but momentum soon swung the other way. Rye kept fighting, and went on to grab the lead and hold on for an entertaining 21.11 (137) to 17.14 (116) win.\nEdward Greene booted nine majors for Rye to help his side get over the line.\nTo close out the round, Bonbeach and Crib Point each picked up 44-point wins over Karingal and Hastings respectively.\nWOMEN’S DIV ONE\nWARRAGUL Industrials are Grand Final bound.\nWarragul took on Karingal in the preliminary final at Bunguyan Reserve on Saturday afternoon. Karingal earned their place in the prelim by beating Frankston, while Warragul were looking to make amends after a qualifying final defeat to Mornington.\nKaringal only managed to score one goal for the afternoon against Warragul. The Industrials also struggled in front of goal, but they did enough to earn a 4.9 (33) to 1.2 (8) win.\nRemy Ferguson, Abbie Hoiberg-Cox, Shanae Hawker, Amy Boote, and Monai Porykali were Warragul’s best.\nMornington and Warragul will face each other in the Grand Final at Kinetic Stadium in Frankston this weekend.
