His deep connection to Kooyong makes him the perfect ambassador for the event.”\nCash said that Kooyong holds a special place in my heart, both as a club and as the home of so many incredible tennis moments. “Like millions of fans, I have great memories of watching and playing there. The Kooyong Classic has always been the perfect warm-up for the Australian Open—same courts, same balls, and that unmistakable Melbourne wind.”\n“It’s fantastic to see the event return next January, and I’m excited to be a part of it!”\nWith Cash on board as an ambassador, the tournament continues to strengthen its reputation as an essential stop on the global tennis circuit.\nEarlier this month, Kooyong Classic announced media partnerships with SBS and GRUP MEDIAPRO.\nASICS x Hockeyroos & Kookaburras\nThe Kookaburras and Hockeyroos are stepping into a new Olympic cycle with ASICS after Hockey Australia announced a three-and-a-half-year partnership extension with the apparel and footwear giant.\nASICS will remain the Official and Exclusive Footwear Partner of Hockey Australia and the Hockeyroos and Kookaburras until the end of 2028, continuing an enduring decade-long partnership.\nThe extension will ensure the Hockeyroos and Kookaburras have access to ASICS’ world-leading high-performance hockey footwear through an exciting period that includes seasons six to nine of the FIH Pro League, the 2026 World Cup in the Netherlands and Belgium and the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games.\nHockey Australia CEO David Pryles is delighted to continue the successful and longstanding partnership between two iconic sporting brands. “ASICS has been an integral part of our rich legacy on the world stage for many years.

I have people say to me they started banking with BOQ because of that partnership and here we are reconnecting strongly again.”",
