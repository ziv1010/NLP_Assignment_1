We’re sorry we can’t be there in person, but we’re so proud of everything you’ve achieved and the millions you’ve inspired here and around the world. So go out there tomorrow and really enjoy yourselves.\"\nPrincess Charlotte, holding a football as she sat next to her father on a bench, added: \"Good luck, Lionesses.\"\nDon't miss: Gemma Atkinson cringes in embarrassment as she admits to 'massive mum fail'\nDon't miss: Ashley Roberts goes braless as she dons risqué dress in very leggy display\nDon't miss: James May addresses being sacked from show as he blasts 'wokeness'\nFollowing England's 1-0 defeat on Sunday, William tweeted: \"Although it’s the result none of us wanted, @Lionesses you have done yourselves and this nation proud.\n\"Your spirit & drive have inspired so many people and paved the way for generations to come. Thank you for the footballing memories. Congratulations to Spain. W\"\nSome critics have suggested heir to the throne William, who is President of the FA, should have travelled to watch the clash against Spain and suggested it may have been different if the men’s team had played.\nSocial media users on Twitter appeared unimpressed, with one remarking “A letter? what a joke”, and another adding: “Big deal… he should be there.”\nFormer England goalkeeper Pauline Cope branded it a “shame” that William had not travelled to Australia, saying: “This should have been pencilled in his diary from day dot, after we won the Euros and qualified for the World Cup.”\nCulture Secretary Lucy Frazer, who travelled to Australia to watch the match with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, defended the royal, saying: “Prince William is, of course, the president of the FA and is a tremendous supporter of the sport.\n“I know that he’s disappointed that he isn’t able to be here today but he has sent a message of good luck to the Lionesses.\"",
