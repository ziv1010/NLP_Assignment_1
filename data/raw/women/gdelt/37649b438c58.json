The incident happened in the West Wing conference room early Monday morning, where witnesses said former President Joe Biden arrived bright-eyed and bushy-tailed to attend the staff meeting at the start of the new week. \"He was in a chipper mood and ready to get to work,\" one White House insider said. \"He was shaking everyone's hands and cracking jokes about the football games he watched yesterday like it was just another Monday morning.... -\nPer multiple law enforcement sources, within the last hour, Border Patrol agents near Fronton, TX were fired upon\nPer multiple law enforcement sources, within the last hour, Border Patrol agents near Fronton, TX were fired upon from MX by suspected cartel gunmen as a group of illegal aliens were being brought across the river.

Later, she adds, “I think there are incredible opportunities for women in journalism. But I think it would be a disservice to suggest, especially to young women who are entering the workforce, that they’re not going to encounter sexism and potentially harassment. It exists. It does. And it exists even for the most powerful women... -\nGod created people to love, not to hate:' Holocaust survivor addresses UN [Inspiring yet sad]\n\"My parents.. young couple deeply in love. Before father was taken to a labor camp, mother wanted to become pregnant. My father was against it. ‘You don’t bring a child into a world where sure death is waiting for them everywhere,’ he said.

In a January 24 interview with the Columbia Journalism Review, Krugman expressed his “rage” at his editors, which apparently began to balk at the extremism that plagued his columns (shocker). “I’ve always been very, very lightly edited on the column,” Krugman whined. “And that stopped being the case [in 2024]. The editing became extremely intrusive. It was very much toning down of my... -\nRev. Al Sharpton leads Costco ‘buy-cott’ in support of company’s controversial DEI commitment\nRev. Al Sharpton and about 100 of his followers descended on an East Harlem Costco Saturday in support of the company’s commitment to controversial diversity, equity and inclusion practices. “We’re supporting those who are not rolling back DEI,” Patrice Perry, crisis director for Sharpton’s nonprofit, the National Action Network, told The Post. “It’s very important to be here,” Perry added. The demonstration was in response to President Trump’s crackdown on DEI initiatives this week, which put federal employees working on such initiatives on paid leave and shuttered offices dedicated to it. Trump’s executive order called the practice “illegal discrimination” and... -\nAstronomy Picture of the Day - Pleiades over Half Dome\nExplanation: Stars come in bunches. The most famous bunch of stars on the sky is the Pleiades, a bright cluster that can be easily seen with the unaided eye. The Pleiades lies only about 450 light years away, formed about 100 million years ago, and will likely last about another 250 million years. Our Sun was likely born in a star cluster, but now, being about 4.5 billion years old, its stellar birth companions have long since dispersed. The Pleiades star cluster is pictured over Half Dome, a famous rock structure in Yosemite National Park in California, USA. The featured... -\nBeneficiaries under Social Security Fairness Act could be waiting ‘more than one year’ for adjusted payments, SSA says.\n(NEXSTAR) – Over 3.2 million Americans are now eligible for new benefits under the recently passed Social Security Fairness Act, but many of them could be waiting for over a year to see their payments. -\nPope Francis will not veto Trump's Vatican ambassador pick, officials say\nPope Francis is not expected to veto President Donald Trump's choice of a high-profile critic of his papacy as the next U.S. ambassador to the Holy See, according to two senior Vatican officials, despite misgivings about his stance on many issues. Brian Burch, who leads a right-wing advocacy group, has said the pope's pastoral agenda, such as being more welcoming of LGBTQ Catholics, was causing \"massive confusion\" for the world's 1.4 billion Catholics. Trump nominated Burch for the Vatican role in December. At the time, Austen Ivereigh, a papal advisor who co-authored a book with Francis in 2020, said the... -\nCold Case Task Force IDs 1985 Victim of Serial Killer Duo\nIn the mid-1980s, Leonard Lake and Charles Ng raped, tortured and murdered at least 11—possibly 25 or more—men, women and children at a remote cabin near Wilseyville, Calif.

But President Donald Trump’s Secretary of State is now directing officials at the Department of State to reverse the various policies that help illegal migration into the United States. “This department will no longer undertake any activities that facilitate or encourage it,” Secretary Marco Rubio said in a memo to the top officials in the department. The task is “the most consequential... -\nDespite Pardon, House Subcommittee Could Force Liz Cheney To Testify About Jan. 6\nFormer Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney would likely have to testify before a new U.S. House subcommittee that’s investigating the events that took place before and after Jan. 6, 2021, if she gets subpoenaed, which a subcommittee member has already said is likely to happen. Despite Cheney receiving a pardon from former President Joe Biden during his final hours in office, presidential pardons come with the caveat that they remove Fifth Amendment privileges for the recipient. The Fifth Amendment grants the constitutional right to not answer questions in a court of law. Many Republicans have criticized the work of the United... -\nWhy Ski Down A Mountain When You Can Fly Instead?\nFlying a plane down one of the most formidable ski slopes in the world is a very cool way to sell energy drinks.When most companies want to sell a few extra cans of soda, they hire a celeb and shoot an over the top Superbowl commercial.

Outlandish Red Bull films are nothing new... -\nTrump White House Press Room Changes Are Long Overdue\nA second Trump administration may revamp the White House briefing room, sidelining legacy media in favor of independent voices and shaking up the mainstream press's long-held dominance. There have been reports in recent weeks suggesting that there may be major changes coming to the White House press briefing room in a second Trump administration. The White House Correspondents’ Association (WHCA) generally creates the briefing room seating chart, which gives the front row to what most of us would call the “mainstream media,” such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, and network news channels, most of which, if not... -\nEconomic Black Hole: Here Are 25 Signs That the U.S. Economy Is Dying After 4 Years of “Bidenomics”\nThe damage caused by 4 years of “Bidenomics” has been so immense that it is difficult to put it into words. Everywhere we look, the U.S. economy is rapidly deteriorating all around us, and it would literally take a major miracle to turn things around at this point.
