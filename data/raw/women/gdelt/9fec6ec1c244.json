  "body_text": "- Aaron Rodgers is on the cusp of a high-profile trade to the New York Jets.\n- The 39-year-old, who was overlooked as a college player, spent his pro career with the Green Bay Packers.\n- He leads one of the most interesting and unconventional lifestyles off of the field.\nAaron Rodgers, one of the greatest passers in NFL history, is on the cusp of a high-profile move to the New York Jets.\nThough Rodgers was overlooked as a college athlete, he joined the Green Bay Packers in 2005 and, up until this month, spent his entire pro career in Wisconsin, becoming one of the best-known names in sports.\nBut he's more than an athlete, as he's associated himself with blue-chip brands, been romantically linked to numerous famous women, and has an underrated sense of humor.\nThere's been highs, lows, championships, and controversies.\nHis 18 seasons with Green Bay was highlighted by a Super Bowl win over the Pittsburgh Steelers at the Cowboys Stadium in Texas, in February 2011.\nRodgers enjoyed one of the best seasons of his career in 2010, leading the Packers' offense to thorough beatings over the Philadelphia Eagles, the Atlanta Falcons, and the Chicago Bears in the lead-up to Super Bowl XLV.\nIn the big game, Rodgers completed 24 of his 39 passes for 304 yards and three touchdowns to lead his team to a 31-25 win and deservedly earn the Super Bowl MVP.\nPerhaps, most importantly, that victory earned Rodgers a trip to Disney World. Look at that smile!\nAs has become custom, Rodgers could be heard bellowing: \"I'm going to Disney World!\" immediately after clinching the Super Bowl victory in Texas.\nFew people have ever looked happier and more at home standing next to Mickey Mouse, surrounded by ticker tape.\nRodgers is renowned for his Hail Mary passes down the field.\nRodgers has made the Hail Mary a near-signature move and few highlights encapsulate his ability for coming in clutch than the time Richard Rodgers II caught his 61-yarder with literally 0:00 on the clock to beat the Detroit Lions 27-23.\nThe NFL dubbed the move: \"The Miracle in Motown.\"\nHe earns approximately $68 million per season, from his salary and endorsements.\nAs a four-time NFL MVP, Rodgers has set numerous records including taking the fewest games (193) to reach 400 passing touchdowns.\nIt's little wonder that with so much on-field success, he's attracted endorsement deals with notable brands like State Farm, Adidas, Taylor Made, Bose, and Panini.\nThose commercial contracts add approximately $11 million to his bank account every year.\nHe once requested to be paid partly in Bitcoin.\nRodgers signed a four-year, $134 million contract with the Green Bay Packers in 2018 and said in 2021 that he believes in Bitcoin. He even said that part of his $33.5 million per year salary would be paid in that cryptocurrency.\nThe mean average for Bitcoin was around $47,000 in 2021, according to Bloomberg. After a market crash in 2022, the crypto has gained momentum in 2023 and has a current price of $26,500 at the time of writing.\nSource: Insider.\nIt seems to be as much about the fun as it is about the games for Rodgers, as he once skipped voluntary team workouts to gallivant around Hawaii with his girlfriend.\nRodgers passed on a voluntary off-season workout opportunity with the Packers in 2021 to instead travel to Hawaii with his then-fiancée, actress Shailene Woodley, and the actor Miles Teller and his wife, Keleigh.\nVideos on their social media channels showed them hiking, frequenting swimming holes, and singing Taylor Swift songs.\nI don't know about you, but that sounds to me like it beats a week in Wisconsin.\nSource: Insider.\nRodgers also had fun on 'Jeopardy!' as the game show nerd appeared on the show both as a contestant and a host.\nAs a host, Rodgers wrote a load of sticky notes to display on the podium. Some included simple reminders like: \"Stand up straight,\" and \"slow down.\"\nOthers, as Insider reported at the time, were weirder: \"Don't pick your butt/nose.\"\nSource: Insider.\nAs COVID rampaged its way through the world and shuttered sports in 2020, Rodgers became a vocal critic of vaccination and NFL policy, attracting backlash.\nEarly in the pandemic, as sports executives attempted to integrate health and safety measures that would allow their leagues to return, Rodgers called out what he called \"double standards\" and openly wondered if it was all based on science.\nDuring an appearance on \"The Pat McAfee Show,\" Rodgers said that he wasn't for a reduction in protocol per se, but said some rules seemed to conflict with one another.\n\"You can go to practice and hit each other and be in close contact, but you have to have Plexiglass between you and the guy next to you in the locker room,\" he said in 2020.\nA reporter asked Rodgers in 2021 if he had been vaccinated, and his answer — that he'd been \"immunized\" against COVID — caused an uproar many months later when it was revealed he had not been vaccinated.\nIn an interview on \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" Rodgers said his answer was designed to mislead the public and the media into thinking he'd had the vaccine when really he hadn't.\nHe said instead he had taken part in an \"immunization process through a holistic doctor.\"\nLater that year Rodgers said: \"I'm in the crosshairs of the woke mob right now.\"\nIn 2022, he even said he believed people were tuning into certain matches — like the Packers-49ers game — to specifically root against him because of his vaccination status.\nSources: Insider, The Pat McAfee Show, CBS Sports, Insider.\nAnother side of his personality is that he's an avid reader, and though he gives regular book recommendations, there's always one story he returns to.\n—Matt Schneidman (@mattschneidman) December 22, 2020\nHe's also a frequent golfer, even partnering up with Tour players like Bryson DeChambeau.\nRodgers and DeChambeau beat Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady with two holes to play in the 2021 installment of \"The Match,\" to win $200,000 for charity.\nRodgers has a handicap of 3, meaning if there was a course with a par 72, he'd aim to shoot three over par at 75 — a very good score.\nHe played somewhat regularly at Green Bay CC in Wisconsin but it is unclear which course near the Metlife Stadium he'll call home when he moves to the East Coast.\nSource: Golf.com.\nRodgers is romantically linked to Mallory Edens.\nMallory — the daughter of Wes Edens, a billionaire part-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks — is a model, writer, and activist.\nThe pair were even spotted at a Lakers-Bucks NBA game in December 2022.\nSource: People and New York Post.\nRodgers was previously engaged to Shailene Woodley, an actress.\nWoodley once quipped that, given the opportunity, she could not turn down a relationship with Rodgers because her dog would disown her, considering how good the quarterback would be at a game of \"fetch.\"\nThey reportedly called off their relationship around February 2022, after keeping news of their engagement relatively quiet throughout the pandemic. Rodgers is said to have proposed back then with a ring that could be worth $500,000.\nPrior to his relationship with Woodley, Rodgers was linked to fellow athlete Danica Patrick and actress Olivia Munn.\nHe has a somewhat complex relationship with his family.\nRodgers has a \"complicated\" relationship with his brother Jordan Rodgers, who won \"The Bachelorette\" show in 2017, family members said.\nAaron didn't even watch \"The Bachelorette,\" for example. \"I haven't seen the show to be honest with you, so it hasn't really affected me a whole lot,\" he told WISN.\nRodgers said he finds it \"inappropriate to talk publicly about some family matters\" but, regardless, wished him well \"in the competition.\"\nIn 2018, Jordan accused Aaron of failing to check in on their parents when they were being evacuated during the California wildfires that year.\nThen, in 2019, a report from Bleacher Report suggested that several former teammates described the superstar athlete as someone who was difficult to work with.\nSources: US Weekly, WISN, Insider, and Bleacher Report.\nRodgers likes to work on himself and is an advocate of yoga, meditation, and darkness retreats.\nRodgers once said on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" that meditation retreats and things like yoga have \"stimulated my mind and helped me get in a better, better, better headspace.\"\nHe says it all helps him \"have greater peace\" in his life.\nRodgers even suggested in 2021 that meditation helped keep him from retiring that season. And, interestingly, NFL Hall-of-Famer Troy Aikman used Rodgers as an example to show meditation can make better leaders.\nOn darkness retreats, Rodgers said everyone could probably benefit from turning their phones off and disconnecting from things like technology and social media every once in a while.\nHowever, he conceded that \"some people don't want to do a few days and nights in darkness.\"\nSources: The Pat McAfee Show, Insider, and Insider.\nRodgers experimented with ayahuasca and found greater self-love as a result.\nRodgers has experimented with ayahuasca — a plant-based psychedelic — and said it bolstered his mental health.\nIt helped \"see how to unconditionally love\" himself, he said.\n\"Ayahuasca and psilocybin actually really helped\" Rodgers overcome a prior fear of death, the quarterback added.\n\"I think when you've seen the other side it makes the idea of death more of a passage and less of an ending. More of kind of the next chapter of life,\" he said on \"The Pat McAfee show.\"\nSources: The Pat McAfee Show, and Sports Illustrated,\nAnother form of wellness that Rodgers practices is called panchakarma.\nDescribing panchakarma as a \"12-day cleanse,\" Rodgers said he adhered to a daily regiment that included a \"specific diet\" and \"treatments.\"\nHe said: \"You're not really doing anything else.\"\nThis, he said, allowed him to heal, re-center, and gain the spirituality he sought from the experience.\nPart of that cleanse included a diet of drinking warm ghee, which is clarified butter, in the mornings, and using herbal laxatives in the evenings.\nOther staples of the diet included rice, beans, vegetables, ginger, turmeric, and coriander.\nAbstaining from things like cold food, sugar, dairy, drugs, alcohol, and caffeine is mandatory.\nSources: Sports Illustrated and Insider.\nRodgers has one of the most interesting, if unconventional, lifestyles in football, and will likely take that with him once his trade to the New York Jets is confirmed.\nRodgers told \"The Pat McAfee Show\" Wednesday that he intends to play for the New York Jets in 2023.\nIt remains unclear, though, whether the Jets can work out the trade with the Packers.\nThe two franchises are at the negotiating table but, as the New York Post noted Friday, they are at different ends in what they believe the trade is worth.\nSources: The Pat McAfee Show, New York Post,",
