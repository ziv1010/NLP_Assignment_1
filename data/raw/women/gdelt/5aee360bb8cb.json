  "body_text": "JAN MOIR: My policeman dad hated thieves with a passion. Not like today's coppers, who write off £500,000 burglaries at a stroke\nLast month internet entrepreneur Paul Birch and his wife had £500,000 of goods stolen from their Surrey home.\nThe thieves were caught on camera, stuffing duffel bags with Rolex watches, diamond jewels and Hermes handbags as they ransacked the premises.\nTerrible, you might think – and you would be right. Yet, after the family dialled 999 to report the crime, police took 12 hours to turn up. Then the officer in charge took a two-week break over Christmas, returned to his desk and closed the case because there was 'not enough evidence' to pursue the housebreakers.\nOf course there wasn't. Even the dimmest, half-baked demi-crim knows to mask up and wear gloves when going equipped for theft and burglary, possibly also to arrive and depart in a stolen car.\nStill. Half a million nicked in stolen goods just gone, girl – and nobody seems to give a damn.\nMr Birch is obviously a very rich man and one can't help but wonder if this fact is somehow held against him in the world in which we now live. After all, this is a modern day Starmer-istan where initiative, success and enterprise are rewarded with punitive taxes and barely concealed contempt.\nCCTV footage of a masked thief in the garden of Bebo founder Paul Birch's Surrey home\nMr Birch and his wife Juliana, pictured, were horrified when they came home after celebrating their daughter’s 17th birthday last month to find their house ransacked\nThey had £500,000 of goods stolen, including Rolex watches\nPerhaps the cops console themselves that this is a 'victimless' crime, with any losses probably covered by insurance claims, so why bother?\nYet by its very nature, no crime is ever victimless. And surely, as a tax-paying, law-abiding citizen, Mr Birch and his family should expect and deserve better when the sanctity of their family home has been breached and defiled. Shouldn't we all?\nWhat do the police consider a crime these days? That is the question. Where is the level of their engagement?\nThey don't seem to care about domestic robbery, they are not bovvered about stolen phones, they are seemingly incapable of staunching the increase in knife crime, not much interested in mass shoplifting, common assault, drug offences or if someone has nicked your £1,600 lawn mower from your garden shed or your car from the driveway...\nWhat do they do all day? Perhaps they spend all their time whistling show tunes and enjoying cups of tea as they solve complicated and exciting international crimes on behalf of Interpol. Something is keeping them busy!\nMeanwhile, muggers and marauders roam unchecked on our streets, and if someone nicks your very own diamond earrings from your very own ear lobes, then just suck it up, sister. Or brother! No sexist stereotyping in this column, thank you very much.\nNot just because it is the kind of 'hate crime' that really can bring the police mob-handed to your door and result in an arrest, conviction and imprisonment – or social banishment at the very least.\nRegular readers, please stifle your yawns, but I always feel obligated to point out that I come from a police family. I'm not an officer with powers of arrest myself – God knows, I often wish I was – but neither am I entirely a civilian. I know most cops are honest, decent, hard-working and hard-pressed.\nMy own policeman father hated thieves with a passion and considered any robbery on his patch as a personal slight – a crime to be vigorously pursued, not something to be overlooked and filed away under 'unsolved'.\nHowever, things have changed. These days many officers are hampered by budget cuts which force them to prioritise crimes. Or feel trapped by protocols and political initiatives.\nNot to mention being terrified of doing the wrong thing – not least because of being constantly monitored by idiot citizen activists armed with phone cameras, filming their every move. That way if any officer makes a tiny, wrong move in a volatile and dangerous situation, then the dopes can post it on their social media accounts to get more clicks.\nHow I hate them, these agitators who have never had to make a difficult decision under pressure, or consider public safety and cope with violent criminality in a moment of crisis.\nHowever, I did permit myself a small laugh when a mummy of yummy lineage had her phone stolen in London this week and furiously took to social media to berate the Metropolitan Police for their lack of action. Clearly she expected this crime to be expedited to maximum threat level mega-crisis, with all southern seaports closed and flights in and out of Heathrow cancelled.\nUsing the Find My Phone app, Mrs Yum tracked her pilfered phone's progress from outside Brixton Tube station to North London and was appalled when the various Borough Command Units – along with British Transport Police – refused to do anything much. Or should we just be honest here and admit they refused to do 'anything'?\nThe crime was registered, the file was closed and I don't even blame the cops. No one is expecting battle-weary Met officers to spend time chasing down every nicked mobile phone in the capital. One is stolen in London every six minutes. But where do we – and they – draw the line?\nFor a great number of people, their mobile phone is the most expensive thing they own. Perhaps they have a right to feel aggrieved when it is ripped from their hands by thieves while the police just shrug and move on.\nBut I accept and understand the Met's position, too. However, it is no secret that small crimes seed into bigger crimes. Knife crime has surged across the country since the pandemic, driven by a 47 per cent rise in violent robberies and phone thefts. And, if knife crime is rising, so is the murder rate.\nOn both sides of the divide, in the abyss between the police and the public, expectations have to be managed by all. Reason must prevail.\nHowever, do any of us want to live in a society where a £500,000 crime appears to be dismissed in such a perfunctory fashion?\nIf that really is considered as small beer today, then we are all drinking in the last-chance saloon. And my dear old dad will be turning in his grave.\nDaughter of footballing great Kenny Dalglish, Kelly Cates attends the Legends of Football 2023 event at Grosvenor House\nWhere's the bloke? Kelly Cates and Gabby Logan have been announced as the new faces of BBC football, sharing Match Of The Day presenting duties alongside Mark Chapman.\nAll three are experienced broadcasters, but does it really take a trio of talent to replace Gary Lineker? Many of us cannot even understand the broadcasting obsession with punditry.\nIt's not just that these presenters are discussing a game they have never played professionally – more that real football fans are more knowledgeable and insightful in the first place.\nDon't they just fast-forward through any flimflam pitter-patter discussions to get to the real action anyway?\nWhat anything-goes Britain could learn from Sweden...\nJust before Christmas I had an NHS outpatient appointment at a London hospital.\nThe man in front of me could not speak English and used Google translate on his phone to talk to reception staff and medics. No one seemed surprised by this. If not commonplace, then it was certainly not unexpected.\nThe gentleman was well-dressed, focused, sure of his entitlements. Yes, throw me in jail, but it did cross my mind as to how and why he could access NHS services without being able to speak a word of English, or to have been in any way assimilated into British culture.\nHow does he fill in his tax returns? But to air such a thought these days is to be accused of racism and worse. That is one reason why the migrant standards introduced in Sweden are so interesting. The country has just unveiled tighter rules aimed at upholding its values.\nFrom now on, citizenship must be earned, Swedish society and values must be respected and language exams must be passed.\nIn measures aimed at some societies, equality between the sexes is non-negotiable.\n'If you don't accept that, then Sweden is not the country for you,' said a minister this week.\nWhy has it taken so long to establish this? It is a privilege to live in or become a citizen of another country, not a right.\nAnd no doubt those who disagree with these Swedish rules will arrive in anything-goes-Britain tomorrow if not sooner.\nStarmer's macho new look\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer looks casual in his T-shirt on a train bound for Kyiv\nBad enough that Foreign Secretary David Lammy pads around the world stage wearing a pair of trainers with his High-Street suits.\nNow we have Prime Minister Keir Starmer turning up in Kyiv in a butch 'Oi, oi, I'm In A War Zone' T-shirt.\nI don't know what kind of macho image Sir Keir is trying to present, but he looks like a children's TV announcer about to introduce an exciting new episode of SpongeBob SquarePants.\nIt's so embarrassing. Where is Gordon the Gopher when you need him?\nShow some compassion messieurs!\nA scammer duped Anne into thinking she was dating Brad Pitt and and sending £697,000 to pay for 'kidney cancer treatment'\nReally, my heart goes out to Anne, the 53-year-old interior designer from France scammed into believing she was in a year-long romantic relationship with Brad Pitt – and robbed of her £700,000 life savings as a result. Why do these silly women fall for it, you might ask – but please have a heart!\nFor who is more vulnerable than a lonely, middle-aged woman, perhaps already bruised by love and beaten down by crushed hopes, someone whose life hasn't quite worked out the way she wished? Women like Anne so much want to believe in love that they make themselves believe in the make believe – in this instance with catastrophic results.\nAnne was originally contacted by someone posing as Pitt's mother. 'She told me that her son needed someone like me,' Anne explained. Oh, God. You can see where this is going.\nThe scammers messaged her again several days later, this time posing as Brad himself. Soon the fix was in and 'Brad' was in hospital with kidney cancer, needing money for life-saving treatment because his bank accounts were frozen during divorce proceedings with ex-wife Angelina Jolie.\nAnne duly obliged with the cash.\nThe worst part of all is that after opening up about her ordeal in a French television documentary this week – in the hope that other women would not make the same mistake – Anne suffered so much harassment and online abuse that the television channel TF1 had to withdraw her interview.\nThis is a tragedy, a serious crime: the calculated violation and extortion of a vulnerable woman. Anne had just gone through a divorce and was suffering from severe depression. Yet this has not stopped her being roundly mocked on French social media sites and elsewhere – mostly by men.\nNow listen, messieurs. In the wake of the Gisele Pelicot case, I don't think French men are in any position to snicker at or mock any woman, no matter how misguided and risible her behaviour might seem. So show some respect and compassion, if you can find it in your corroded souls.\nIn other news, Brad Pitt is still going out with his partner Ines de Ramon, a voluptuous 'fine jewellery executive' almost exactly half his age.\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured",
