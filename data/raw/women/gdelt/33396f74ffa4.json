The company has its UK headquarters in Lovelace Road.\nBracknell resident Mark John launched a petition calling for those responsible to be brought to justice or for Fujitsu to leave the town altogether.\nThe Post Office Horizon scandal has been described as one of the most widespread miscarriages of justice in history, with 736 sub-postmasters prosecuted based on faulty information.\nThe Bracknell News spoke to Pam Stubbs, a former Berkshire sub-postmaster who spend her years fighting Post Office bosses for justice after her part in the Horizon scandal.\nRead more here\nSupporters rally for Ravi’s recovery\nTHOUSANDS of pounds was raised for a seven-year-old Bracknell boy who has been left with severe brain damage after suffering rare complications from an E.coli infection.\nDespite initial mild symptoms of a stomach bug, Rafi Amer, from Jennett’s Park, was rushed to hospital experiencing severe pain.
