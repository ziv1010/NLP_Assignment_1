A perk of working on the Best of Utah Body and Mind is learning about the top providers of care in our area. This year, we've even more to think about as we've increased the award categories to more than 150 (up from around 100 last year). This year, some 7,000 voters cast ballots for 3,500 businesses and individuals. In all, 45,000 votes were cast. We summarized the first-, second- and third-place winners in four sections: medical/dental, complementary/alternative, beauty and fitness. We also asked: \"What Did We Miss?\" and we've included those suggestions by voters as well.\nHave you observed any changes in the health and wellness fields since COVID? Some complain about long waits to see their doc or to get a call back from them. Others don't like the price hikes for procedures and items not covered by insurance.\nBut there are other trends as well. For example, it's no longer that unusual to see people masking up before they go into crowded stores or an airport terminal. They tend to be older folks like me trying to avoid catching the latest bug, COVID or otherwise. Or maybe we just don't want to give you the bug we have! Or maybe we don't like the way we look. (Thankfully, there are many pros in the upcoming Beauty section who can help with that.)\nBeyond masking, I'm noticing that vaccinations for many ailments are now being given by pharmacy techs—no doctor's appointment needed. And many vaccines are covered by insurance, so no payment is required. I guess that's good news for those who believe in vaccinating.\nMeanwhile, technology has marched on, hasn't it? Scheduling apps have nearly put medical receptionists out of a job. It is nice to make appointments online but not so nice if you need to ask a basic question about your visit.\nI also like being able to view my lab results and even see X-rays online as soon as they're available, often before my primary care doctor has seen them. My dentist now takes digital X-rays and can point to real-time issues. Even in the ER, they can now roll in a portable X-ray device to look at minor breaks and sprains (don't ask me how I know).\nIn terms of fitness, there's truly a gym and studio out there with your name on it. And so many are state of the art, offering strength and conditioning, yoga, climbing walls and cycling to music. No matter your age or condition, you're welcome to show up and feel the burn.\nAnd what about beauty? Can you see it morphing into wellness before your eyes? The menu of options to choose from these days is almost mind-boggling: CBD facials, chemical peels, fillers, dermaplaning, IV drips, vitamin and hormone shots and oxygen bars. Dentists and even physicians have caught on and are adding aesthetician and med-spa care to their services.\nAlas, most aesthetician/med-spa services are not covered by insurance, but wouldn't it be grand if they were? And gym memberships as well? They're all components of what make us look and feel healthy, and sadly, the costs are prohibitive for many. Oh well, there's always jogging around Liberty Park—and applying a honey and avocado facial when we get home!\nBy putting our health and well-being first, everything else in life becomes easier. Many thanks to those providers who make our best life possible, and congratulations to all the 2023 winners!\nJerre Wroble Body & Mind Editor\nBody & Mind contributors: Katharine Biele, Carolyn Campbell, Aimee L. Cook, Thomas Crone, Babs De Lay, Wes Long, Cat Palmer, Michael Saltas, Connor Sanders and Megan Wagstaff\nEditor's note: Not all awards have 2nd and 3rd place winners.\nMedical & Dental\nBest Addiction Recovery Odyssey House of Utah You should look at the graph showing Odyssey House's success rate compared to others. It's stunning. Let's talk drug addiction. The path to sobriety is long and hard. Some people don't make it, but for those who do—and there are many—their lives have been changed forever. One client says he is six years sober, he left mid-way and it was hard. \"I use everything I learned about my behavior and have changed my whole life around.

Actually, everyone should see a dermatologist for an annual checkup, especially if you have fair skin.

With eight health centers in Utah from Logan to St. George, Planned Parenthood provides essential sexual and reproductive health care services, including abortions up to 18 weeks—for now anyway. A temporary restraining order currently blocks the implementation of Utah's \"trigger law\" that would ban abortion in Utah. While that case is awaiting a decision, a new Utah law was passed in 2023 that bans abortion clinics. That law is also being challenged in court. Through it all, PPAU has fought the good fight to defend a woman's right to choose, believing as it does that sexual and reproductive health are basic human rights, and access to health care should be available to all.

As one of the world's most popular exercise programs, it was created by Joseph Pilates, who opened his first studio in New York in 1923, employing an apparatus called a \"Reformer.\" About 20 years ago, a Pilates instructor named Sebastien Lagree developed a complementary fitness program that uses a platform called a Megaformer—one that emphasizes circuit training and more intense cardio than Pilates, all while working several muscle groups at once—and, like Pilates, it's low impact. Readers voted Peak 45 as Best Pilates Studio but in reality, Peak 45 is an exciting evolution of Pilates. Opening their doors in Utah in 2017, they have three (soon to be four) locations in Utah. They welcome newcomers and will show you the ropes. The instructors are empowering, motivating, entertaining and kind—all while kicking your butt. You can try out an unlimited pass for $59.
