  "body_text": "With the NRLW season fast approaching, the Broncos will put their pre-season training to the test with a trial game against the Papua New Guinea Blossoming Orchids at Suncorp Stadium on Sunday, June 22.\nThe trial game will be played before the Round 16 NRL match at Suncorp Stadium against the Sharks.\nThe Broncos officially started their pre-season last month and have continued preparations over the past four-weeks, which included a training camp held at the Gold Coast.\nThe 30-player squad has a mix of youth – like Queensland Under 19 players Reegan Hicks and Shalom Sauaso - and experience, like 2023 Dally M Medallist Tamika Upton.\nThe trial game against the PNGRFL Blossoming Orchids is the final opportunity for the squad to play a match before the season starts on Saturday, July 5, against the Wests Tigers at Totally Workwear Stadium.\nHead of the Broncos NRLW Program Paul Dyer said it’s a chance to test the young players with some more experienced combinations.\n“There will be a few combination changes this year from last year’s team,” Dyer said.\n“We’ve got obviously players like Tamika Upton who will come into the side this year so there will be some different combinations out there.\n“It will give Coach Scotty [Prince] a chance to mix and mingle with those sides to come up with his best team to be ready to go for two weeks’ time.”\nThe trial game came about through a conversation with Queensland and PNG Coach Tahnee Norris, who was recently re-appointed the role ahead of the 2026 World Cup.\nThe side will have a combination of players from various competitions in PNG and some which are Australian based.\nDyer said he’s expecting a physical game.\n“They love competing, they'll try really, really hard and they'll certainly be aggressive,” Dyer said.\nTraditionally, Papua New Guinea sides are defensively very aggressive, they like to play the game tough, so the girls will be in for a contest.\nPaul Dyer\n“I'm not expecting our team to take them lightly by any means… they’ll need to get their preparation right and prepare like they're about to play a really good national team, and that's what it is.”\nUpton returned to the Club this season after spending the past three-years with the Newcastle Knights.\nShe was ruled out of the final State of Origin match due to injury, but Dyer said she is on track to play in the trial game.\n“The injury was a lot less significant than what we first thought,” Dyer said.\n“She trained at the camp and got through most of those sessions so we should have her back in full training and ready for that trial game.”\nKick-off for the match at Suncorp Stadium is 11:45am, before the NRL match starts at 2pm, with tickets available here.\n“We encourage all of our members and fans to come out early and get a little taste of women’s football,” Dyer said.\n“We know our Broncos fans have traditionally always got out and supported the girls… so we’d love to see as many as possible support the girls.”\nThe Broncos' NRLW season starts with a Round 1 match against the Wests Tigers at Totally Workwear Stadium on Saturday, July 5.\nMemberships for the upcoming season will be available here soon.",
