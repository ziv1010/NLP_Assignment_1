  "body_text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio — When Ohio State basketball star E.J. Liddell came forward with details of the social media abuse he endured after an NCAA tournament loss, it spotlighted some fans’ hostile reactions towards high-profile athletes.\nOhio later became one of the first states to prohibit prop bets — which could ride on the stats or accomplishments of a single player — for college sports. The NCAA is encouraging more stats to enact the same limits.\nThe NCAA recently used Signify Group’s Threat Matrix artificial intelligence service to study and respond to online abuse towards athletes. Last week, the NCAA sent out a news release detailing what it called the “mental health nightmare” of threats and other abuse towards athletes from bettors. Among the statistics shared:\nLatest Ohio State Buckeyes news\n- What Ohio State’s 2025 playoff path would have looked like under the Big Ten’s proposed 24-team format\n- How to watch Ohio State vs. Penn State Big Ten wrestling for free today\n- Where Ohio State football stands in recruitment of 4-star offensive tackle: Buckeye Breakfast\n- 6 pressing questions for Ohio State head coach Ryan Day: Buckeye Talk podcast\n- One in 3 high-profile athletes receive abusive messages from someone with a betting interest. The volume of abuse and threats increased during high-profile events.\n- During the Division I men’s and women’s basketball tournaments, over 54,000 posts and comments were flagged as potential abuse or threats for review by in-house human analysts. Of those, 4,000 were confirmed as abusive of threatening and reported to relevant social media platforms or law enforcement.\n- More than 540 betting-related abusive messages were directed at men’s and women’s basketball players including death threats.\n- Women’s basketball players received approximately three times as many threats as men’s players.\nThe NCAA said it has increased its education of student-athletes about both handling abusive threats and the risks of sports betting and problem gambling. It also launched the Draw the Line campaign at the start of March Madness.\nMoving on\nOhio State baseball lost its regular-season finale to Rutgers on Saturday, but for the first time sine 2019, that was not also the regular-season finale.\nThe Buckeyes had already clinched a spot in this week’s Big Ten Tournament in Omaha. As the No. 7 seed, OSU opens against No. 2 seed Nebraska at 2 p.m. Tuesday. The winner and loser play either No. 4 seed Purdue or No. 5 seed Indiana in the double-elimination format.\nPlay it back\nIf you want to relive Ohjo State football’s spring game from April 13, the program posted a video retrospective on its x.com page.\nKey dates\n- Chelsea vs. Manchester City soccer match at Ohio Stadium: 75 days, Aug. 3\n- 2024 opener vs. Akron: 103 days, Aug. 31\n- Ohio State at Oregon: 145 days, Oct. 12\n- Ohio State at Penn State: 166 days, Nov. 2\n- The Game 2024: 194 days, Nov. 30\nIf you or a loved one has questions and needs to talk to a professional about gambling, call the Ohio Problem Gambling Helpline at 1-800-589-9966 or the National Council on Program Gambling Helpline (NCPG) at 1-800-522-4700 or visit 1800gambler.net for more information. 21+ and present in Ohio.
