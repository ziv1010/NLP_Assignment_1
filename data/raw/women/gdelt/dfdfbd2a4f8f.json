Arsenal, currently ten points behind Chelsea at the top of the Women's Super League (WSL) table, now have only the Champions League as their remaining chance to secure silverware this season.\n\"It was very disappointing,\" Slegers acknowledged, speaking ahead of Friday's trip to Everton.\n\"Players were angry on Monday, and we want to do better as collective moving forward, but we can't impact that anymore, it's behind us. So now we want to look forward, and that's on Friday, a very important game against Everton in the league, and we know we're still active in Champions League.\n\"We have a big month coming up. We have two competitions where we're still active, and we want to push into everything and to go and get silverware, because it's very important for the club.\"\nSlegers mentioned how the disappointment of falling out of the FA Cup will work to motivate her side heading into the business-end of the 2024/25 season.\n\"You could see the response from the players, they were very disappointed and they want more. So I see that in a positive way, because I think those emotions and that frustration can lead to motivation. The girls are determined to show something better, and I am as well,\" she said.\n\"It's important for us in games to solve the problem that's in front of us, and we can all agree that we didn't succeed last Sunday. Then it's about what do we need to focus on and emphasise moving forward. We need to leave the emotions from last Sunday behind us and look at it more objectively and constructively.\"\nThe Gunners now travel to Walton Hall Park to face Everton in the WSL. The last meeting between the two sides was a closely contested match, ending in a 0-0 draw at Emirates Stadium.\nEverton have enjoyed improved form over recent weeks, winning three of their last four WSL games.\n\"They exchange between systems. What it looks like Brian is trying to do is to play them to the strength and adjust to the opposition. So I think that's a real strength of them and they've got it right now,\" Slegers analysed of the opposition.\n\"I think they shift well between an aggressive press. They recognise when they want to press as a team, but they're also very comfortable and disciplined when they defend their own goal and end up in a low block. So I think that's the strength of them, and I think we have to try and break that down on Friday.\"",
