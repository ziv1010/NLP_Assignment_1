Luis Rubiales never asked if I wanted a kiss before he kissed me. It was a moment that stained one of the happiest days of my life.”\nClaiming the pressure on her to tell the world Rubiales had kissed her on the lips in the excitement of the moment and it was not something that had bothered her started almost immediately. She said she was called off the team coach at the Sydney stadium where Spain won its first women’s World Cup by a press officer who showed her a statement she was supposed to have penned herself.\nShe told the court: “I skim-read it and knew I hadn’t written a word of it. It was a statement I had supposedly drafted myself and consented to being put out to fan the flames of the fuss that was being created by the kiss.\n“The statement said Luis Rubiales and I were good friends and the kiss happened in the effusiveness of the moment. I said I didn’t agree to it going out.”\nSaying Rubiales himself approached her during a stopover in Doha on the plane on the way back to Spain, where the former Spanish FA boss’s daughters Lucia and Ana were travelling, the footballer said he wanted her to assist him by doing a video with him because of all the social media reaction.\n“I told him I wasn’t going to do anything, that I wasn’t the one who had started things. He told me ‘Please, my two daughters are in the back of the plane crying’.\n“I repeated that I wasn’t going to do it and I remember him saying he had a girlfriend at that time and it hadn’t bothered her.”\nAlleging then-manager Jorge Vilda had approached her brother on the plane to try to put pressure on her to change her mind, she said: “I felt totally unprotected in what should have been a safe place for me, which was my team.\n“No one asked me if I needed anything. The only thing Luis Rubiales and his aides did was to try to protect their reputation.\n“From the first moment I reached Spain I had cameras after me 24 hours, people following me, people taking photos while I was having breakfast with my family. I had to leave Madrid with my family.\nAsked how many times she had been asked to put out a press release or statement supporting Rubiales, Ms Hermoso said: “Too many to count. The situation prevented me from enjoying being a World Champion.\"\nTwo of Rubiales' three daughters, the ones who were on the plane, are due to give evidence on his behalf next Monday.\nBarcelona striker Alexia Putellas, part of the women’s World Cup-winning team, will give evidence on Ms Hermoso’s behalf on Thursday. Other witnesses include the current Spain manager Luis de la Fuente.\nRubiales, who resigned from his post in 2023 and was charged last year after a long-running criminal investigation, has said of the daughters who could now come to his rescue in court: “They are very strong, stronger than me.\n“I consider myself to be a tough guy, but when it comes to my daughters it’s not normal.”\nThe 'Kissgate' trial is taking place without a jury and is due to finish on February 19. The judges' verdict is expected to be delivered at the end of this month at the earliest in writing and even if he is convicted and handed a prison sentence, Rubiales could delay his incarceration by appealing.\nIn any case, prison sentences of two years or less are normally suspended for first-time offenders.\nAs well as a prison sentence, public prosecutors also said in their pre-trial indictment they wanted Rubiales to pay Jenni Hermoso €100,000 in compensation if he is convicted.",
