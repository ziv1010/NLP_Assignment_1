The option year that was previously a standard in United contracts, already triggered.\nOf concern for fans as existing terms wind down and get ever closer to expiry is that each has turned down the offer of a new contract so far in the negotiations process.\nRusso rejected a new deal back in June shortly before Euro 2022. From her perspective, there was a logic as her value had soared within just a few weeks thanks to a starring role at the tournament that highlighted her quality on the biggest of stages and made her suddenly a huge marketing draw.\nThe 24-year-old has continued to underline her importance to United on the pitch this season and two world record bids from Arsenal were turned down on transfer deadline day in January. Even if Arsenal’s willingness to pay up to £500,000 showed Russo how much they value her, the fact that United rebuffed that amount also said plenty about what they think she is worth.\nBatlle was reported by The Athletic just this week to have turned down a new deal after first being offered terms in September. The suggestion is that United haven’t offered as much as a host of suitors – Barcelona, Chelsea, Arsenal, Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain – are willing to, nor as long.\nAlthough the lure of returning to former club Barcelona is often mentioned in conjunction with her future, Batlle is long thought to have been happy at United. She is a firm fan favourite and is arguably as or more important to the club at present than any other player.\nWhen confirming last month that ‘heavy’ negotiations have been ongoing with Batlle and Russo, Marc Skinner was adamant both are, “very happy with what we’re doing at Manchester United”, in terms of the ambition and progress of the club.\nSkinner has also been honest about the difficulties about such contract talks. With the rapid development and evolution in women’s football, the money coming into the game and the growing commercial value of players, it is extremely hard for both sides of the negotiating table to know what individuals are worth, either now and even in just six or 12 months’ time.\n“We’re entering a different realm of women’s football, so it become more difficult,” he said. “But we are working as hard as we can to retain the players and build on top of that.”\nWith United in the hunt for Champions League football but far from guaranteed it, plenty about next season is still unknown. Both Batlle and Russo are ambitious players who want to be competing at the very highest level and have clubs chasing them who can offer that more readily.\nIt may be that United need to get there first, which will also pump additional money into the club, to prove that their level matches those ambitions now. If they do, which they are on course to, it could be a much simpler process. Otherwise, there could be some hard decisions to make.\nIt ultimately suits the players to wait it out to see what is on offer at United next season – specifically with regard to Champions League football. Although talks will continue, the club may have to sweat until then, but their best chance of retaining their best players is getting over the line in the top three.\nMary Earps, nominated for Best FIFA Women’s Goalkeeper such was her 2022, is also out of contract in the summer and has spoken of her desire to play in the Champions League. Conversations have been had with Earps about a new deal, but with the club holding a 12-month option until 2024, the situation isn’t as critical. Of other important players also out of contract in June, Hannah Blundell, Hayley Ladd, Vilde Boe Risa and Martha Thomas all have untriggered options too.\nThe club recently secured a new two-year contract with Millie Turner, who was due to become a free agent this year. And while she was already on a long-term deal until 2025, this season has also seen Ella Toone commit her future to United for even longer – now to 2026.\nFor more from Jamie Spencer, follow him on Twitter!",
