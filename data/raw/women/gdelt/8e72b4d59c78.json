It only took a few minutes after the restart for Arsenal to make it 3-0, thanks to a beautiful low-volley from Beth Mead in the penalty area. The score finished 4-0 with Frida Maanum grabbing the last goal on 78 minutes.\nHead coach Jonas Eidevall made three changes to the team he played against Manchester City at the weekend, bringing in Alessia Russo upfront with Stina Blackstenius, and putting Mead out on the wing in place of Caitlin Foord.\nHow the game unfolded\nYou could certainly feel the tension in the air as the first whistle of the game was blown under the lights at Meadow Park. As if Arsenal didn’t have a hard enough task on their hands starting 1-0 down on aggregate, the pouring rain certainly made things even trickier.\nHowever, the north Londoners started strong and dominant, with Caldentey making the biggest impression down on the left-hand side. It was clear from the outset that Arsenal weren't going down without a fight and it wasn't long until they had something to celebrate. A power shot from Walti hit the back of the net in the 23rd minute, surprising herself as well as Hacken goalkeeper Jennifer Falk.\nTheir second came soon after with Caldentey finally catching some luck. Hacken remained on the back foot for the rest of the half, with a near miss from Russo who failed to execute the finish when she had the chance against Falk.\nAlthough there were a handful of moments Arsenal's Emily Fox, Laia Codina and Katie McCabe got caught short on Hacken's press, the visitors didn't convert their chances.\nAs the second half got underway, Mead took the score to 3-0 after just a few minutes with a low volley through the penalty area. It was from this moment that the Gunners could breathe a confident sigh of relief as their Champions League group stage spot was practically in the palm of their hand.\nThey continued to play some excellent football, with Russo, Blackstenius and Mead working well in tandem with one another upfront. Substitute Maanum sealed the deal in the 78th minute, ending the game in a 4-0 victory.\nIt wasn't perfect, but the Gunners certainly have a lot to be proud of from their performance, proving they most certainly have what it takes to be real contenders in the Champions League this year.\nArsenal player ratings (4-4-2)\nGK: Manuela Zinsberger - 8/10 - As always, a safe pair of hands who fended off any rare moments of threat.\nRB: Emily Fox - 6/10 - A few sloppy passes here and there, but worked well with Mead on the right.\nCB: Lotte Wubben-Moy - 8/10 - Excellent at both ends of the pitch. Defended well and created chances.\nCB: Laia Codina - 6/10 - Also lost possession a few times in dangerous spots, but otherwise a solid performance.\nLB: Katie McCabe - 7/10 - Was beaten a few times by Hacken's Tabitha Tindell, leaving her on the back foot.

Got a goal and remained threatening throughout.\nCM: Kim Little - 8/10 - As always, looked in control in the midfield battle.\nCM: Lia Walti - 9/10 - Great to see her back in red. Scored an absolute worldie for her troubles.\nLM: Mariona Caldentey - 9/10 - Impressed from the outset with runs down the wing and eventually got a goal which was fully deserved..\nST: Stina Blackstenius - 8/10 - Worked well in tandem with Russo, generating chances.\nST: Alessia Russo - 7/10 - A solid addition in the lineup, but did fail to convert a few strong chances on goal.\nSubstitutes\nSUB: Caitlin Foord (65' for Foord) - 6/10\nSUB: Frida Maanum (76' for Russo) - 9/10\nSUB: Kyra Cooney-Cross (76' for Walti) -7/10\nSUB: Laura Wienroither (90' for Fox) - N/A\nSUB: Rosa Kafaji (90' for Caldentey) - N/A\nUnused subs: Van Domselaar, Williams, Reid, Kuhl, Harbert, Godfrey, Lia\nManager\nJonas Eidevall - 8/10 - Arsenal came out fighting from the first whistle despite a huge amount of pressure.",
