I am delighted with the progress made.\n“The 16th placement can only mean the goal is within reach. I believe that with God’s grace, focus and hardwork, an African will be Ballon d ‘Or soon… Time to push, I am motivated.”\nOn being one of only two African women nominees, the other being 12th-placed Zambian Barbara Banda, Tabitha said: “It’s the first time we had two African women nominees, but we deserve more, Africa has got talent.”\nShe, however, acknowledged that the Scorchers’ failure to participate or qualify for major tournaments such as the Women’s World Cup, Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (Wafcon) and the Olympics, could remain a stumbling block on her aspirations.\nSaid Tabitha: “It is a fact that the national team’s participation in major tournaments is crucial for our rankings… And I am referring to all players and not just me.\n“So, I am confident that under the new FAM [Football Association of Malawi] administration, we will be assured of participation, leading to qualification. Let’s not lose hope.”\nDuring the gala event, Tabitha also delighted in rubbing shoulders with big-name stars such as England captain Harry Kane, Ivory Coast legend Didier Drogba and winners in men’s and women’s categories Rodri and Aitana Bonmati respectively.\n“It was an amazing experience to meet and interact with all of them, I will cherish the memories for the rest of my life and in everything, I thank God the Almighty,” she said.\nFootball pundit Felix Ngamanya Sapao also said the challenge for Tabitha to win the Ballon d ‘Or is Scorchers’ failure to particiapate or qualify for big tournaments.\nHe said: “The drawback is that our women’s national team either doesn’t participate or qualify in these major tournaments and yet that is one of the key factors that are taken into consideration.\n“If you look at Barbara, she did more for her country, Zambia, than at her club during the period under review. Among others, she helped them qualify for the World Cup, where she scored their lone goal.\n“She also inspired them to qualify for Wafcon and Olympics where she shone with a hat-trick…And even the winners, Rodri and Bonmati did exceptionally well for both club and country",
