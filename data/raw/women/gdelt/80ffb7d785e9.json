The pair of shutouts at Waipio Peninsula Soccer Stadium in Waipahu, Hawaii kept Baylor’s record spotless in the Outrigger Invitational.\nSophomore forward Callie Conrad scored both of the Bears’ goals in Hawaii, upping her career goals scored to four. Senior TCU transfer goalkeeper Azul Alverez played all 180 minutes during the trip and tallied 12 saves en route to adding two shutouts to her resume.\nThe green and gold will look to keep their hot streak rolling against Texas A&M. The Bears and Aggies landed a 1-1 tie in last year’s Battle of the Brazos in College Station.
