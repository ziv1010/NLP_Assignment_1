Like his predecessors in recent years, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made stopping the English Channel migrant crossings one of his top priorities. But his latest plans have drawn swift condemnation from the U.N.’s refugee agency and many rights groups, which call the policies unethical and unworkable.\nPressure is mounting on the BBC to resolve the crisis, with growing calls for its bosses to step down over allegations of political bias and suppressing free speech.\nThe controversy has impacted the BBC's sports programs, with dozens of sports presenters and reporters walking out of their jobs Saturday and Sunday in support of Lineker.\nA look at who Lineker is, the debate surrounding his comments and how it's affected the BBC:\nWHO IS LINEKER AND WHAT DID HE SAY?\nLineker, 62, is one of Britain’s most influential media figures and was paid 1.35 million pounds ($1.6 million) by the BBC last year.\nOne of England’s greatest strikers with 48 goals in 80 international appearances, he was a household name in Britain even before he became chief presenter of the soccer highlights show “Match of the Day” in 1999.\nIn a post Tuesday to his 8.7 million followers on Twitter, Lineker described the government’s new plan to detain and deport migrants arriving by boat as “an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s.”\nHOW DID THE BBC AND OTHERS REACT?\nThe BBC — which has prominently covered the Lineker controversy — said the presenter breached its social media guidelines and said he was to step back from presenting “Match of the Day.”\nWhile BBC news staff are barred from expressing political opinions, Linker is a freelancer who doesn’t work in news or current affairs. However, in guidelines updated in 2020, the BBC said presenters with a “significant public profile” had responsibility to avoid taking sides on party political issues or political controversies.\nThe government called Lineker’s Nazi comparison offensive and unacceptable, and some lawmakers said he should be fired.\nIn a BBC interview, the broadcaster's director-general Tim Davie flatly rejected a suggestion that Lineker was suspended due to pressure from the governing Conservative Party.\nMany who supported Lineker said he had a right to express his opinion online.\n“I cannot see why you would ask someone to step back for saying that,” said Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who is known for being outspoken about current affairs. “If I understand it right, it is a message, an opinion about human rights and that should be possible to say.”\nOthers say the corporation's impartiality rules seem muddled, pointing out that Lineker did not face discipline when he criticized the Qatar government's rights record during the World Cup last year.\n“It seems that they want to pick and choose when they want to be partial, criticizing others or criticizing other countries or other political parties or other religions seems to be okay,” former England soccer player John Barnes told Sky News.\nHOW HAS THE BBC BEEN AFFECTED?\nThe 100-year-old BBC is under scrutiny particularly because it is a public corporation — it is mostly funded by a license fee paid by all households with a television — and is expected to be independent.\nThe broadcaster’s neutrality came under recent scrutiny over revelations that its chairman, Richard Sharp — a Conservative Party donor — helped arrange a loan for then Prime Minister Boris Johnson in 2021, weeks before he was appointed to the BBC post on the government’s recommendation.\nMore immediately, the decision to suspend Lineker has triggered a mass walkout of BBC sports presenters and reporters in solidarity with their colleague.\nOn Saturday, several daytime soccer shows were pulled at the last minute and “Match of the Day,” regarded as something of a British institution since the 1960s, aired with no commentary and only featured shortened footage. Usually lasting around an hour and a half, Saturday’s “Match of the Day” only aired for 20 minutes.\nSunday’s coverage of the Women’s Super League aired without commentary from regular BBC presenters and “Match Of The Day 2” was also expected to run in a reduced format.\nDavie apologized for the disruption and said bosses are \"working very hard to resolve the situation and make sure that we get output back on air.”\n___\nAP Sports Writer Steve Douglas contributed to this report.\n___\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",
