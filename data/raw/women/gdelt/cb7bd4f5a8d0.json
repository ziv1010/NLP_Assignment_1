  "body_text": "The Missing Years: 2020-2025\nHere’s a timeline of the major events and key stories during our five-year hiatus.\nArtwork: Dosain\n31 Jan 2025, 23:33\n28 January 2025\nTourism minister sacked.\nIbrahim Faisal was abruptly dismissed for undisclosed reasons.\nSpeaker Abdul Raheem Abdulla decried his son’s sacking as unjustified and confirmed rumours of a rift with President Dr Mohamed Muizzu, fueling speculation about a split in the ruling party. But the parliamentary group leader denied media reports about Abdul Raheem’s imminent impeachment, and declared that “100%” of MPs in the pro-government supermajority were loyal to the president.\n3 January 2025\nMalé flooded after record rainfall.\nAfter the delayed onset of the northeast monsoon, 109.8 millimetres of rain from 3pm to 6pm set a record for a three-hour period.\nHousehold damage worth MVR 2.2 million (US$142,670) was the worst in the capital’s history. More than 740 homes, businesses, schools and warehouses sought help from the National Disaster Management Authority, which provided temporary shelter to 226 people. Eight other islands reported swell surges and flooding from torrential downpours.\n1 January 2025\nFree Trade Agreement with China comes into force.\nReversing course after the previous administration put implementation on hold, the government touted duty-free fisheries exports and a potential US$300 million boost to trade with China.\nBut the opposition warned that the country’s first bilateral trade deal will disproportionately benefit China and imperil Maldivian economic sovereignty.\nAn MoU was signed with the People’s Bank of China in September for \"promoting the settlement of current account transactions and direct investments in local currencies.”\n26 December 2024\nTourist arrivals reach a record two million for the year\nThe two millionth tourist was Astrid Dirnegger, an Austrian national who arrived on her third trip to the Maldives.\nChina was the top source market with 263,042 tourists as of 30 December, followed by Russia, UK, Germany and Italy. There were 172 resorts, 15 hotels, 929 guesthouses and 155 safari vessels in operation by the end of the year.\n21 December 2024\nUnder-fire HDC boss resigns over corruption scandal.\nPublic sentiment was especially inflamed as internal documents and forged registries leaked online concerned housing, the most sensitive and combustible issue in Maldivian society.\nCalls for accountability from ruling party lawmakers followed reports of factional strife within the government. As pressure mounted, Ibrahim Fazul Rasheed denied fraudulently awarding land plots to ineligible applicants of the former government’s housing scheme. He told the press it was a “coincidence” that the new landowners included his brother Mohamed Fazeel Rasheed, deputy managing director of the water company.\nThe brothers were placed under investigation along with several Housing Development Corporation and housing ministry officials, all of whom were barred from traveling overseas. A day after his resignation, police raided Fazul’s residence and seized MVR 1.4 million in cash.\n15 December 2024\nVaping ban takes effect.\nThe import of e-cigarettes, vaping devices and related products as well as their use, possession, manufacture, sale, advertising and free distribution were prohibited with hefty fines.\nIn November, the price of a pack of cigarettes went from MVR 100 to MVR 250 after the government hiked tobacco tariffs.\n14 December 2024\nNew Foreign Currency Act ratified with exchange controls.\nThe new law made it mandatory for tourist establishments and large corporations to convert a portion of foreign currency earnings into Maldivian Rufiyaa.\nFaced with a revolt from resort operators, the government offered the option of exchanging 20% of monthly foreign currency income instead of US$500 per tourist as proposed by the central bank.\n12 December 2024\nMassive fire destroys housing ministry office in Malé.\nShortly after it was reported around 6:30am, the fire completely engulfed the building - which also housed the construction ministry - and spread to the environment ministry and city council offices in the compound.\nIt took more than six hours to bring it under control. The cause and the extent of data loss remained unclear.\n20 November 2024\nConstitution amended with anti-defection clauses.\nAs the opposition and civil society cried foul, the amendments were pushed through in less than 24 hours.\nThe new provisions effectively empowered parties to enforce their whip with the threat of removal from office.\n7 October 2024\nPresident Muizzu secures financial lifeline on maiden visit to India.\nA US$ 400 million currency swap agreement “will be instrumental in addressing the foreign exchange issues we are currently facing,” President Dr Mohamed Muizzu said after official talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, lauding India as the “first responder” that has “stood by the Maldives during our times of need.”\nThe official visit came after efforts to repair strained ties in an apparent U-turn from an anti-India stance.\nThe Indian bailout shored up depleted foreign currency reserves after credit ratings agencies Fitch and Moody’s downgraded the Maldives to “junk” status over a high risk of default. Gross international reserves stood at $322 million at the end of September 2024, barely enough to cover imports for a month and far short of debt service needs of about $700 million in 2025 and over $1 billion in 2026.\n19 September 2024\nInternational bunkering inaugurated\nThe offshore bunkering and refuelling service was launched in Ihavandhippolhu in the northernmost atoll by the State Trading Organisation in partnership with Vitol.\nThe government hoped to carve out a small market from hundreds of cargo ships that pass through the busy 8-degree channel between the Maldives and India. But no foreign vessel refuelled in Ihavandhippolhu over the next two months.\n25 August 2024\nBank of Maldives reverses suspension of foreign transactions.\nThe national bank abruptly blocked international payments with debit cards linked to local currency accounts.\nAmid a public outcry and panic among Maldivians overseas, the government intervened and forced the bank to reverse the restrictions six hours later. The aborted move was part of a coup attempt in collusion with the opposition, Muizzu alleged.\n28 June 2024\nAusterity measures announced to avert debt crisis.\nMonths after Muizzu announced his intention to enact austerity measures, the government belatedly hiked tourism-related taxes but hesitated to cut spending that would directly affect the public.\nPhasing out blanket subsidies for fuel, electricity, food, and sanitation, all of which were to be replaced with targeted assistance to low-income households, was pushed back to 2025.\n23 June 2024\nState minister accused of using black magic against first couple.\nFathmath Shamnaz was detained for over three weeks for allegedly performing sorcery or black magic to seduce Muizzu.\n2 June 2024\nIsraeli tourist ban announced.\nNearly eight months after the attention-grabbing announcement that Muizzu had “resolved to impose a ban on Israeli passports,” the decision was yet to be enforced.\nA bill to bar entry to Israeli passport holders languished in a parliamentary committee for five months. Ruling party lawmakers then proposed a targeted ban on Israeli leaders as tourism associations warned of financial repercussions.\n10 May 2024\nIndia completes drawdown of military personnel.\nIndian soldiers stationed across the country to operate two helicopters and a Dornier aircraft for medical evacuations and search and rescue missions were replaced with civilian personnel.\nThe government celebrated their departure as the fulfilment of Muizzu’s main campaign pledge.\n9 May 2024\nCoastal development suspended amid mass coral bleaching.\nThe Environment Protection Agency ordered a temporary halt to dredging, reclamation, and sand pumping to minimise “further anthropogenic stress on our coral reefs.”\n2 May 2024\n‘Operation Kurangi’ cracks down on undocumented migrants.\nThe homeland security ministry collected the biometric data of more than 4,000 foreign nationals for regularisation and deported as many in the nationwide effort.\n21 April 2024\nPeople’s National Congress secures parliamentary supermajority.\nMuizzu’s PNC won 66 seats in the 93-member house in a landslide victory.\nFurther bolstered by nine independents who joined the ruling party and four seats won by coalition partners, the historic haul rose to a pro-government supermajority of 79 MPs, well above the two-thirds and three-quarters needed respectively to remove judges and pass constitutional amendments.\n2 April 2024\nSun settles Hilton arbitration payout.\nResort magnate Ahmed Siyam Mohamed’s Sun Travel completed payment of more than US$24 million to the American hotel chain.\nThe payout was owed as damages over the abrupt cancellation of a management agreement for the Irufushi resort in April 2013.\nIn August 2015, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre ruled in favour of Hilton. But the arbitral award remained unenforced for eight years as Sun filed legal challenges and appealed decisions.\nIn April 2023, death threats were made against Dhauru journalists over an article which suggested that political influence over the Maldivian judiciary was behind Sun’s success in stalling and deferring the payment. Both Dhauru journalist Ahmed Naaif and senior editor Ahmed ‘Hiriga’ Zahir “received multiple threats through phone calls and messages,” according to the Maldives Journalists Association.\nSiyam personally called Hiriga and demanded the removal of the article. The Sun resorts owner and MP for Dhaalu Meedhoo – who also owns media outlets under the Sun brand – allegedly told the veteran editor that it was “a final warning,” Dhauru reported. A complaint was lodged with the police over the threats, some of which warned of confrontations on the street and advised Naaif to leave the country within five days. Youth loyal to Siyam would not hesitate to “kill or die” for him, Naaif was warned.\nThe Sun Siyam company, which operates five high-end resorts in the country, also threatened to sue for defamation.\nThe threats pose “a grave concern for all journalists,” the International Federation of Journalists warned.\n18 March 2024\nEx-president Yameen’s conviction overturned.\nConcluding the stalled appeal, the High Court ordered a retrial after quashing his 11-year prison sentence on bribery and money laundering charges.\n22 February 2024\nChinese research vessels docks in Malé.\nXiang Yang Hong 03 visited for crew rotation and replenishments of stocks after clearance for a port call, according to the Maldives foreign ministry, which assured that the ship would not conduct any research.\nBut it departed after skirting Maldivian territorial waters for three months.\n21 January 2024\nFootball Association chief faces corruption trial.\nBassam Adeel Jaleel, the former president of the Football Association of Maldives, was accused of embezzling US$1.2 million entrusted by FIFA, world football’s governing body.\n13 January 2024\nOpposition candidate wins Malé mayoral race.\nAdam Azim, the former managing director of the Maldives Transport and Contracting Company, won the by-election amid a dismally low turnout of 32%.\n10 January 2024\nMuizzu meets Xi Jinping on state visit.\nMuizzu broke with tradition to make Beijing his first port of call instead of New Delhi.\nFollowing official talks, the two leaders presided over the exchange of 20 agreements. Details of the pacts were classified. The Chinese government pledged US$130 million in grant aid, most of which would go towards the redevelopment of Malé’s roads, Muizzu told the press upon his return.\n7 January 2024\nDeputy ministers suspended over derogatory remarks against Indian Prime Minister.\nThree deputy ministers mocked Narendra Modi as a \"clown,\" \"terrorist” and “puppet of Israel” on social media, triggering a diplomatic row and a costly tourism boycott campaign backed by Bollywood celebrities.\n“We may be small but that does not give you the license to bully us,” Muizzu declared in a thinly-veiled rebuke to India upon his return from China a few days later. Hitting back at the remarks, the Indian external affairs minister suggested that a bully would not have provided free vaccines or US$4.5 billion worth of aid.\n28 December 2023\n13 MDP MPs join PNC.\nThe defections scuttled the opposition’s efforts to impeach the new president.\nThe opposition lawmakers were offered US$200,000 to switch allegiances, the Washington Post reported in a December 2024 exposé on secret talks between MDP leaders and Indian agents to depose Muizzu.\n18 December 2023\nRasmalé reclamation inaugurated.\nThe new administration’s flagship project - to develop a zero carbon city and resolve the capital’s housing crisis - involves the reclamation of 1,153 hectares of land from the Fushidhiggaru lagoon south of Malé.\nIn a much-derided move, Muizzu pledged to connect the manmade island to Malé via an undersea tunnel.\nHis deadline for completing reclamation passed in August 2024 and the contract with the Sri Lankan developer was terminated.\n15 December 2023\nPorn sites blocked.\nAt the behest of the new administration, the Communications Authority blocked access to all pornographic websites for the first time in the Maldives.\n26 November 2023\nMuizzu travels to Turkiye on first overseas visit.\nAfter official talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and senior Turkish government officials, Muizzu attended the COP28 summit in Dubai.\nThe outcome of the Turkiye visit included the opening of a Maldives embassy in Istanbul and the controversial purchase of military drones from a Turkish company. In March, Muizzu inaugurated the military’s new Air Corps and introduced the unmanned aerial vehicles into service.\nMuizzu’s Turkiye trip came after a planned visit to Saudi Arabia was indefinitely postponed for undisclosed reasons.\n22 November 2023\nCharges dropped against Rilwan abduction suspects.\nThe Criminal Court dismissed terrorism charges raised over the abduction of journalist Ahmed Rilwan in August 2014 and the murder of blogger Yameen Rasheed in April 2017.\nIsmail Abdul Raheem, Ahmed Muaz and Ahmed Ismail, the alleged leader of the ‘Buru’ gang in Malé, were arrested in June 2022 following a breakthrough in investigations by the presidential commission on deaths and disappearances. But the prosecution’s evidence was deemed insufficient to proceed to trial. Following their release, Ismail Abdul Raheem was appointed to a senior post at the Housing Development Corporation. A group of civil society organisations called on the inquiry commission formed by the previous government to publicly disclose its findings.\n21 November 2023\nYameen falls out with Muizzu.\nHe was abandoned by almost the entire leadership and activist cadre of the PPM-PNC, most of whom were now ministers, political appointees and bosses of state-owned enterprises.\nIn early 2024, the People’s National Front was registered under his son Zain Abdulla’s name with Yameen as the main founder. On the eve of Eid, riot police cleared out the PNF leadership and founding members as they arrived for the party’s inaugural congress at Ghiyasuddin School despite the private school’s cancellation of the rental agreement. In the clashes that ensued, police used pepper spray to disperse protesters.\nSpeaking to the media the following day, Muizzu expressed regret and lamented the deployment of the heavy-handed Specialist Operations police “against my clear instructions.” He ordered an inquiry report by the end of the day. But the PNF dismissed his disavowal as “damage control.”\n17 November 2023\nMuizzu takes oath of office.\nChief Justice Muthasim Adnan administered the oath during a special sitting of parliament in Malé’s Republic Square.\nIn his inaugural address, Muizzu made ambitious pledges to develop new cities through land reclamation near Malé. The new cabinet, a mixture of politicians and technocrats, was sworn in on the following day.\nMuizzu, the eighth president of the Maldives, was born on 15 June 1978. A native of Haa Alif Vashafaru, he studied in Malé before moving abroad to pursue a degree in structural engineering followed by a masters and PhD in civil engineering in the UK. He earned his PhD from the University of Leeds. Muizzu and First Lady Sajidha Mohamed - a senior scientific officer at the Food and Drug Authority - have three children.\n16 November 2023\nCharges sought over Ponzi scheme.\nThe police sought charges against former MP Alhan Fahmy and his brothers over an alleged Ponzi scheme.\nThe Fahmy family-owned King’s Forex Trading was accused of illegally setting up an investment scheme and collecting funds with the promise of high returns from hundreds of people, many of whom lost their investment.\nThe online trading company was revealed to have collected MVR 98 million from 1,864 investors. But MVR 65 million was not paid back. Most of the money was used for cryptocurrency transactions and the rest was transferred to the personal bank accounts of the company’s shareholders, according to the police.\nIn January 2023, the police searched Alhan’s home and office and confiscated his phone. In May, the Civil Court ordered King’s Forex Trading to repay MVR 90,000 to an investor.\n13 November 2023\nEx-VP Adeeb released.\nFour days before leaving office, President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih pardoned Ahmed Adeeb and former MMPRC chief Abdulla Ziyath, both of whom were serving lengthy prison sentences under house arrest.\nTheir release followed Adeeb’s return in mid-September from medical leave in Singapore.\n13 November 2023\nNasheed resigns as speaker.\nFormer President Mohamed Nasheed accepted his fate more than five months after the MDP supermajority moved to oust their former leader.\nThe long-running impeachment saga paralysed parliament as the speaker and his allies from the MDP’s breakaway party thwarted no-confidence motions against Nasheed and Deputy Speaker Eva Abdulla.\nNasheed later announced “a respite from active politics” and relocated to Ghana to become secretary-general of the Climate Vulnerable Group.\n30 September 2023\nDr Muizzu wins presidency.\nThe 45-year-old Malé mayor handily defeated President Solih with 54% of the vote in a run-off.\nThe incumbent’s loss continued the losing streak of every sitting Maldives president failing to win re-election.\nOn the following day, Solih authorised former president Yameen’s transfer to house arrest. Upon his triumphant return, Yameen was greeted by President-elect Muizzu as throngs of jubilant supporters gathered outside the former president’s home in Malé.\nInternational media coverage of the election focused heavily on the geopolitical implications. The vote was “overshadowed by India and China,” the New York Times headline read, as Reuters suggested that the outcome could be decisive in their competition for influence. The AFP described the Maldives as located “in a strategically vital position in the middle of the Indian Ocean, astride one of the world's busiest east-west shipping lanes.”\n9 September 2023\nOpposition candidate leads presidential race.\nIn a crowded field with a record eight candidates, Muizzu emerged as the surprise frontrunner with 46% in the first round of voting.\nPresident Solih was the runner up with 39% of the vote as The Democrats candidate peeled off 7% from the MDP base. Reflecting the dominance of the two main parties, the other five candidates all finished under 3% of the vote.\nA second round was called since Muizzu fell short of the 50% majority required for an outright victory. Ahead of the run-off, resort magnate Ahmed Siyam Mohamed’s Maldives Development Alliance broke its coalition with the MDP and endorsed Muizzu. The Maldives National Party of former defence minister Mohamed Nazim also backed the opposition candidate. But Umar Naseer, Faris Maumoon and Jumhooree Party leader Qasim Ibrahim decided to stay neutral.\n13 August 2023\nList of land plot recipients published.\nAwarding free land exclusively to Malé natives for the first time in three decades sparked fierce debates on social media.\nCritics argued that the exclusion of migrants to the capital – more than 100,000 non-native residents of Malé from other islands forced to pay exorbitant rents – was unfair, discriminatory and unconstitutional. After decades of migration in search of employment, education and healthcare, 40% of the country’s population was crammed into the 2.2-square mile island of Malé.\nAddressing the criticism, Housing Minister Mohamed Aslam said the government wanted to ensure “breathing space” for native residents of Malé, many of whom live in slum-like conditions after the division of inherited land into smaller plots. State-owned land, reclaimed or otherwise, has always been awarded for free to native residents on other islands as well, he noted.\nUnder its signature housing scheme, the government planned to award 20,000 people 9,001 land plots from both Hulhumalé and new land to be reclaimed from the Gulhifalhu and Giraavaru lagoons. All adult residents of Malé who were never registered on any other island and who do not own 600 or more square feet were eligible to apply.\n10 August 2023\nPresidential election campaign marred by violence.\nThree people were arrested as opposition protesters clashed with riot police ahead of President Solih’s campaign visit to Gaaf Alif Villingili.\nThe arrests came after rocks were thrown at police officers as they pushed charging protesters back. Barricades were set up at the island’s harbour to block protesters from supporters gathered to greet the president.\nEchoing the opposition Progressive Party of Maldives’ condemnation of “disproportionate force” used against the Villingili protesters, The Democrats accused the president of “abusing his control over the police to harass and intimidate his political opposition” with Specialist Operations officers in riot gear deployed ahead of campaign trips. The new party condemned the alleged abuse of state resources, removal of opposition banners, and beatings in dispersing and locking down protesters. It noted the arrests of Kudahuvadhoo island council members, Ahmed Mauroof and Ismail Farish, for protesting during the president’s visit, the first of whom was arrested from inside his home while speaking with a megaphone.\nThe president’s spokeswoman blamed the main opposition PPM for the campaign unrest on islands, including the attempt to “forcefully enter the cordoned area” in Villingili and an arson attack on an MDP meeting hall in Madaveli.\n6 August 2023\nSupreme Court rejects Yameen's candidacy.\nThe apex court’s full bench decided that Yameen - who was serving an 11-year prison sentence - was ineligible to contest in September’s polls.\nThe constitution states that “if a presidential candidate has been convicted of a criminal offence and sentenced to a term of more than 12 months, three years must have elapsed since his release or pardon.” Yameen’s lawyers asked the court to interpret the provision as referring to a final judgment after the appeal process is exhausted. But the Election Commission’s lawyers and state attorneys argued that Maldivian law does not require finality of judgment for felony disenfranchisement.\n5 August 2023\nSwell waves sweep up drivers on Sinamalé bridge.\nA video of motorcyclists on the Hulhumalé highway swept up by swell waves went viral as unusually high surges caused tidal flooding near Malé’s surf point.\nSeveral drivers sustained injuries and the Sinamalé bridge was temporarily closed. The ring road was flooded as waves crashed over the seawall, washing up sand and rocks. According to the Met office, swell surges between six to eight feet hit the capital and other islands during peak tide “combined with local disturbances; wind, ocean current and increase in wave period.”\nIn a tweet that he later deleted, the Environment Protection Agency’s head blamed “irresponsible development” such as land reclamation without adaptation measures. “More frequent incidences expected at such areas where reclamation reached reef-crest,” he warned.\n3 August 2023\nMuizzu chosen as “backup candidate.”\nMalé Mayor Dr Mohamed Muizzu was chosen as a backup candidate if former president Yameen remained barred from contesting September’s presidential election.\nThe 48-member PNC senate narrowly chose Muizzu over Madduvari MP Adam Shareef Umar (25 votes to 23 votes). After the secret ballot, Muizzu told reporters that if elected his main priority would be Yameen’s release and declared loyalty to the jailed leader. Faresmaathoda MP Hussain Mohamed Latheef was announced as running mate.\nUncertainty lingered over Muizzu’s candidacy with the PPM-PNC leadership split over Yameen’s instruction to boycott the election. But ahead of the 7 August deadline for filing candidacy papers, the Progressive Congress Coalition’s joint senate voted against the boycott as a clear majority favoured fielding Muizzu.\nThe vote was taken after heated debate over a note from Yameen. The meeting was adjourned as arguments broke out and the police were called to restore order. The proposed boycott was rejected 67-45.\nMuizzu - who started his political career with the Islamist Adhaalath Party before switching to the Maldives Development Alliance and ending up in the Progressive Party of Maldives - served as housing minister during Yameen’s administration. The mayor’s candidacy was secured after months of reported infighting in the PPM-PNC between rival factions loyal to Muizzu and other leadership figures.\n31 July 2023\nMaldivians designated as terrorist financiers.\nThe United States designated 20 Maldivians as “key leaders and financial facilitators” of the terrorist groups Islamic State and al-Qaeda.\nMohamed Ameen, the alleged IS leader in the Maldives, was found guilty of terrorism and sentenced to 27 years in prison in late November 2023.\n5 July 2023\nRDC denies embezzlement of MVR 13 million.\nThe Road Development Corporation’s managing director and Chief Financial Officer were accused of illegally transferring money out of the company’s bank accounts.\nThe police were reportedly alerted by the central bank’s Financial Intelligence Unit. But the flagged money transfers involved petty cash sent to work sites, MD Moosa Ali Manik (Mookey) told Adhadhu. A year after a criminal investigation was launched, police raided Mookey and former CFO Yasir Hassan’s homes.\n4 June 2023\nAddu Gan airport expansion inaugurated.\nFinanced by a line of credit from India’s EXIM Bank, a US$17 million contract to develop a new passenger terminal along with a control tower, roads, cold storage and cargo facilities was awarded to India’s Renaatus company.\nOther projects carried out in the southernmost atoll with Indian loan assistance included the construction of 124 kilometres of roads and the reclamation of 190 hectares of land in addition to three new islands designated for tourism development.\nBefore the massive reclamation was launched, a group of local NGOs urged the government to reconsider the project, citing an environmental impact assessment of incalculable loss to marine ecosystems as sediment plumes generated by dredging could spread to 5km and stay inside the atoll for up to 90 days, “affecting the coral, reef and marine environment.”\nDredging sand from the atoll seabed as planned to reclaim 236.5 hectares and create artificial islands for resorts “will effectively destroy nature, biodiversity and the natural defences and resilience of the atoll,” one of the groups warned in a petition, calling on the authorities to “stop this ecocide and irreversible destruction of Addu Atoll,” which was declared a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 2020.\n1 June 2023\n27-year-old stabbed to death in Addu.\nAhmed Shuveyb from Maradhoo Feydhoo passed away while undergoing treatment for stab wounds in the neck.\nAccording to the police, Shuveyb was assaulted with a scissor by his brother, Hussain Mawaz, who turned himself in after a warrant was issued for his arrest. A video of the victim lying on the pavement emerged on social media.\n17 May 2023\nDozen MPs leave MDP to form The Democrats.\nA dozen MPs from Speaker Nasheed’s faction resigned and announced the formation of a new party called The Democrats.\nThe MDP has abandoned its core values and become a “den of thieves,” alleged Deputy Speaker Eva Abdulla, The exodus came with the renegade MPs functioning as a de facto opposition group since Nasheed’s loss in the MDP’s primary.\nThe rest of the 68-member parliamentary group remained loyal to President Solih.\n7 May 2023\nTravel ban imposed over K-Park apartment scam.\nHassan Mamdhuh, known as ‘Mandey,’ was arrested over the fraudulent sale of apartments from the K-Park Residence, a Korean-style 110-apartment complex under construction in Hulhumalé.\nMamdhuh, a minority shareholder of the developer Hanbo Company, was accused of taking large sums as payments from several buyers after forging the signature of managing director Shihu Jin, a Chinese national. Both Hanbo and HDC asked the police to investigate the alleged fraud.\nThe value of identified transactions was reported to exceed MVR 100 million. In some cases, the same apartment was sold to multiple buyers and discounted rates were offered to sell below market prices. Mamdhuh was later charged with multiple counts of theft, fraud, deception and money laundering.\nAt a press briefing in December 2023, the Prosecutor General’s office shared photographs of luxury items seized from Mamdhuh’s MVR 8 million penthouse apartment, including high-end handbags, perfume and jewelry.\n28 April 2023\nNew border drawn with Mauritius.\nThe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea delimited a new maritime boundary between the Maldives and the Chagos archipelago.\nThe court in Hamburg, Germany delineated a maritime border within the overlapping exclusive economic zones, which extends 200 nautical miles from the coast according to the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nMaldivians on social media lamented the purported loss of the country’s territory as opposition politicians alleged “treason.” A “secret” letter by the president that recognised Mauritius’s sovereignty over Chagos – a reversal of a decades-old stance – was blamed for the “loss of 44,000 square km” in the southern EEZ.\nSpeaker Mohamed Nasheed – who contends that the Maldives has a historical claim to Chagos – suggested that the Maldives should disregard the tribunal’s decision. The opposition coalition staged a ‘Chagos’ rally in Malé with leaders vowing to impeach and imprison President Solih, accusing his administration of selling Maldivian territorial waters.\nBut the attorney general’s office welcomed the tribunal’s judgment on “the most significant issue in dispute, namely the alleged entitlement of Mauritius to a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles” with a claim of an additional overlapping area of 22,298 square kilometres. The chamber decided unanimously that it was “not in a position to determine the entitlement of Mauritius to the continental shelf” or to delimit the alleged overlapping area.\n18 April 2023\nFee introduced for plastic shopping bags.\nThe rollout of the MVR 2 fee per plastic bag was bumpy as prices spiked overnight from MVR 25 to MVR 220 for a bundle of small bags.\nThere was an exemption for garbage disposal. But the government-owned Waste Management Corporation was unprepared to offer bin liners for sale for more than a week.\nThe fee followed the banned import, production and sale of several types of single-use plastics in December.\n15 April 2023\nMDP wins Guraidhoo by-election.\nIbrahim Shaaz, the ruling party’s candidate, won the vacant Guraidhoo parliament seat, a first victory for the MDP in a Kaafu atoll constituency.\nFormer Guraidhoo MP Ibrahim Riza, who represented the constituency for nearly three terms, passed away on 23 February after battling cancer.\n13 April 2023\nBribery charges withdrawn against Minister Mahloof.\nThe Prosecutor General’s office told the media that the evidence was insufficient to prove guilt.\nAhmed Mahloof, a former lawmaker, was accused of accepting a US$33,000 bribe from then-tourism minister Ahmed Adeeb to vote for the previous government’s special economic zones legislation in 2014. The youth and sports minister previously claimed he was a “sacrificial lamb” for a corruption scandal whose beneficiaries included sitting lawmakers and top government officials.\n7 April 2023\nWoman stabbed to death.\nNaeema Moosa, a 62-year-old widow who lived alone, was found dead in her home in Noonu Manadhoo.\nMore than a month later, three young men were arrested and charged with murder. According to the police, their suspicions of the victim practising sorcery was the motive for the killing.\n30 March 2023\nCensus results released.\nAccording to the provisional results of the 2022 census, a total of 515,122 people lived in the Maldives, including 382,751 Maldivians and 132,371 foreigners, about 41% of whom resided in the capital Malé, up from 39% in 2014.\nThe census report predicted that the Maldivian population would decline as the average fertility rate per woman (1.7) had dropped below the replacement level needed for growth. The fertility rate was down from 6.4 children per woman on average in the 1990s.\n28 January 2023\nSolih secures MDP ticket with primary victory.\nAfter a bitterly fought contest rife with unrestrained hostility between the campaign teams and an election day marred by brawls at several polling stations, President Solih was declared the winner with 61% of the vote against Speaker Nasheed, who refused to concede over alleged fraud and disenfranchisement.\nThe fraught polls marked the culmination of a long-feared MDP split over Solih and Nasheed’s rivalry.\nSince the first rumblings in the wake of MDP’s landslide victory in the 2019 parliamentary elections, the rift between the “childhood friends” played out with Nasheed expressing displeasure over government policies on the MDP’s internal messaging groups – which were promptly quoted in the media – followed by apparent reconciliation with Solih. The president acknowledged differences of opinion but maintained that the relationship remained intact.\nAs speaker, Nasheed repeatedly excoriated the failure to recover stolen funds or prosecute more than 250 beneficiaries of a historic corruption scandal, who included government ministers and lawmakers.\nIn 2020, Nasheed accused Economic Development Minister Fayyaz Ismail of corruption but failed to gather enough support within the MDP to remove him from the cabinet. Solih publicly backed his influential minister.\nAfter narrowly surviving an assassination attempt in May.2021, the former president sharply criticised Solih’s response to religious extremism as the government withdrew support for hate speech legislation. But in January 2022, he ruled out challenging the 60-year-old for the MDP’s presidential ticket and the pair campaigned together for the Komandoo by-election.\nBut growing animosity and infighting spilled over into the public in mid-2022 when MP Imthiyaz Fahmy and Minister Fayyaz ran for MDP chairman. The contest was widely seen as a showdown between rival factions loyal to Nasheed and Solih. Shouting matches erupted during a televised MDP council meeting where Nasheed’s loyalists were outnumbered 15 to 100. Fayyaz went on to sweep the leadership race in May 2022 with 58% of the vote.\nAt the closing of a tense three-day MDP congress in August 2022, Nasheed withdrew his proposal for a transition to a parliamentary system. Solih’s faction, which commanded a clear majority of the 1,000-plus delegates, celebrated Nasheed’s capitulation as effectively securing the MDP ticket without a damaging primary fight.\nBut by December 2022, it was clear that Nasheed was planning to launch his campaign. He visited MDP strongholds to push a public referendum on the system of government. At the ‘Ask Speaker ’forum hosted by parliament, Nasheed accused Solih of sidelining him after working closely together until mid-2019. The president then tried to consolidate power and build his own support base, he suggested.\n25 December 2022\nYameen jailed for 11 years\nThe 63-year-old opposition leader was found guilty of accepting a US$1 million bribe from former lawmaker Yoosuf Naeem for the no-bid lease of Vaavu Aarah.\nThe island was leased for resort development at a discounted acquisition fee of US$2 million.\nTaking note of the constitutional prohibition for a sitting president to engage in business dealings, Judge Ahmed Shakeel dismissed Yameen’s defence of having bought US dollars from Naeem in a legitimate currency exchange transaction.\n“The court does not see it as a coincidence that an account under Abdulla Yameen’s name was suddenly reactivated and money was deposited from an account under Yoosuf Naeem’s name,” the judge said, referring to the deposit of a US$1 million cheque less than a week after the resort lease agreement was signed in September 2015.\nNaeem, former MP for Vaavu Felidhoo, was found guilty of bribery and sentenced to three years, two months and 12 days in prison.\nThe money could not be considered a campaign contribution as there was no record in the then-ruling party’s finances, the judge concluded, citing the legal requirement for donor funds to be handled by the candidate’s agent.\nThe hearing was delayed for more than two hours as opposition supporters protested outside the courthouse. The Progressive Congress Coalition alleged Indian interference to bar the opposition leader from contesting in the 2023 election, accusing the government of “body-checking the trial judge at gun-point” to deliver a prepared verdict.\n16 November 2022\nParliament approves goods and services tax hikes.\nWith effect in January 2023, GST for the domestic sector rose from 6% to 8% and T-GST – which covers all goods and services provided by the tourism sector – rose from 12% to 16%.\nThe tax hike was voted through despite inflation warnings from the central bank and appeals for more notice from the tourism industry. The government insisted it was necessary to restore public finances to a sustainable footing, citing challenges posed by elevated fuel and food prices, and an unaffordable cost of borrowing.\nBoth the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank welcomed the tax hikes and recommended other revenue-raising measures to avert a looming debt crisis.\n10 November 2022\nTen killed in deadliest fire in Malé.\nEight Indians and two Bangladeshis died after the fire broke out in a ground floor garage and spread to cramped expatriate quarters upstairs.\nOn the top floors raised with wooden decks, 38 people lived in small rooms with a gas cylinder next to each bed. A single window was the only ventilation. The victims were trapped when the fire broke through.\nTwo minor fire incidents previously occurred at the garage. But the garage owner speculated that the fire must have started at the staircase as the repair shop had been closed at the time.\nAs the tragedy prompted renewed concern over the plight of migrant workers, a group of local NGOs condemned the “appalling” failure to combat human trafficking and to ensure equal rights and adequate housing.\nOn 9 January 2023, a fire at Malé’s auction shop - which sold scrap metal, wood and fibre - destroyed the labour quarters of the city’s council’s foreign employees. The 165 Bangladeshis and one Indian escaped unharmed.\n5 October 2022\nAudit uncovers theft of diesel fuel\nA special audit of the ports authority flagged the loss of MVR 28 million worth of diesel.\nAccording to the Maldives Ports Limited and Fuel Supply Maldives, employees of both state-owned companies covered up the theft of diesel from FSM bowsers with forged procurement documents and delivery notes.\n25 September 2022\nHanimaadhoo airport project awarded.\nA US$136 million contract to develop the airport in the northernmost atoll was signed with JMC Projects, an Indian company that submitted the winning bid.\nThe project, which was financed by a line of credit from the Indian EXIM Bank, was inaugurated by President Solih and visiting Indian External Affairs Minister Dr Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in January 2023.\nAhead of the launch, the tourism ministry announced plans to invite bids to develop three new resorts in the northernmost region, which “needs 8000 tourist beds in coming years for smooth functioning” of the Hanimaadhoo airport.\n5 September 2022\nMinibus service introduced in Malé.\nOperated by the Raajje Transport Link, the air-conditioned 20-seater buses cover the main thoroughfares on three routes.\nOn the following day, RTL officially launched its ferry service in Shaviyani atoll, covering the three northernmost atolls and completing the first phase of an MVR 800 million project to establish a nationwide ferry network with purpose-built speedboats.\n30 August 2022\nAmeenee Magu redevelopment begins.\nAmid corruption allegations by the city council, the 10-month, MVR 84 million project – which involved developing storm-drainage systems as well as wheelchair access and braille blocks for the disabled – was awarded to the Road Development Corporation in July.\nThe state-owned company faced criticism over the uprooting of trees and the slow pace of the work, which was completed months behind in schedule in early 2024.\n6 August 2022\nYoung woman’s dismembered body found in Malé apartment.\nShiaau Mohamed Saeed, a 22-year-old woman from Fuvahmulah, was found brutally murdered close to midnight.\nMaldives skating champion Ali Shaahil, 22, was arrested from the crime scene. He was under the influence of drugs at the time and the murder weapon was retrieved along with other evidence, the police revealed at a press briefing. He was reportedly taken into custody in a hazmat suit in order to preserve DNA evidence.\nThe ninth floor apartment of Henveiru Sheereenvilla was Shaahil’s residence. He did not have a criminal record.\nThe police declined to provide details about the gruesome murder to respect the wishes of the distraught family. The body was sent to India later in the week to conduct a postmortem.\n2 August 2022\nThilamalé bridge project launched.\nPresident Solih and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi jointly inaugurated the “Greater Malé Connectivity Project” at a launch ceremony in New Delhi.\nThe pair virtually initiated the ‘Pouring Of First Concrete’ in Malé’s industrial village.\nThe 6.7km Thilamalé bridge – funded with a US$400 million line of credit and US$100 million grant aid from India and contracted to India’s Afcons Infrastructure – would connect the capital with the nearby islands of Villimalé, Thilafushi, and Gulhifalhu, and facilitate the relocation of the Malé port.\nSix key agreements signed during the president’s third visit to India included a Letter of Intent on Buyer’s Credit funding approval of US$119 million for 2,000 social housing units in Hulhumalé in addition to the 4,000 India-funded flats under construction.\nThe completion date of the Thilamalé bridge was later extended to September 2026 after the contractor fell far behind schedule.\n18 July 2022\nEvidence Act ratified with source disclosure powers.\nThe International Federation of Journalists and its local affiliate, the Maldives Journalists Association, condemned provisions that allow courts to compel disclosure of sources.\nBut the government defended the landmark law and assured that it would “take no step that might harm or obstruct the freedom of the press.”\nThe constitution guarantees the right to protect sources of information but the new law introduced exceptions in cases involving acts of terrorism or offences related to national security.\nIn September 2022, the government proposed amendments to address concerns of journalists, seeking to more clearly specify the offences, determine factors that must be considered by a judge and limit the power to order disclosure to the High Court. The MJA welcomed the proposed changes but opposed the exception for offences related to national security, “as there is a possibility of misusing the term in the absence of a law defining national security offences in the Maldives.”\n13 July 2022\nFleeing Sri Lankan President arrives in Maldives\nGotabaya Rajapaksa’s surprise arrival on a pre-dawn flight sparked a fierce backlash as the Maldives government was accused of helping the disgraced leader escape justice.\n24 June 2022\nGay sex tape scandal breaks.\nVideo of Nazim Sattar, a lawyer and brother of former president Nasheed, engaged in homosexual relations with a young Bangladeshi man emerged online.\nOther sex tapes soon emerged of the same Bangladeshi man with former MP ‘Colonel’ Mohamed Nasheed and a police officer.\nAll three Maldivian men were arrested. Travel bans were imposed on at least 18 other local men identified from more videos. They included teachers, an imam, a soldier, a customs officer, a parliament employee, an official at the Centre for Quran and staff at various government ministries, many of whom were sacked or suspended.\nThe 25-year-old migrant worker, M. D. Alamgiri, who secretly filmed the liaisons, was sentenced to seven months in prison in late August. He was sentenced to an additional two years and nine months on 40 counts of producing pornography.\nNazim Sattar was sentenced to three months and 26 days under house arrest. The policeman was sentenced to one year and 28 days in prison. All three men were charged with “unlawful intercourse” under the 2014 penal code, which carries a lesser punishment for consensual same-sex relations than the sexual offences law, which prescribes a jail term of up to seven years.\nBefore they were posted online, the videos were used as blackmail to extort large sums of money, according to the police.\n21 June 2022\nProtesters storm Yoga Day event.\nA group of protesters disrupted an International Yoga Day event at the national stadium in Malé, chasing away participants and destroying property.\nThe British and Indian high commissioners as well as the UN resident coordinator were in attendance. The event was organised by the youth ministry in collaboration with the Indian High Commission. No one was hurt. Riot police used tear gas and pepper spray to disperse the crowd and arrested six of the protesters.\nThe incident occurred after religious scholars condemned yoga as forbidden by Islam and called on the government to cancel the annual event. Six more suspects, including two PPM council members and two clerics who spoke at the protest outside the stadium, were arrested a day later. The Islamic ministry suspended the preaching licenses of Sheikhs Fazloon Mohamed and Adam Nishan.\n11 March 2022\nFirst Maldivian family repatriated from Syrian refugee camp.\nThe 33-year-old woman and her four children were held in “administrative detention” for a risk assessment at the national reintegration centre.\nTwo children born overseas were registered as citizens after a DNA maternity test.\nNew rules were gazetted on 23 February 2022 for registering the birth of children born to Maldivians in war zones, allowing for citizenship and birth registration after a court decision. On the same day, the Family Court concluded the first case to establish legal parentage of children born in Syria..\nAccording to the police, 173 Maldivians were known to have joined terrorist organisations in Syria and Iraq as of December 2019, many of whom were killed in battle. Of 59 Maldivians left in Syria at the time, 91% were women and children. Lack of identification documents for children was the main obstacle to bringing back widows who wanted to return.\n6 February 2022\nMDP wins Komandoo by-election.\nMDP candidate Mohamed Rashid won the hotly-contested parliament seat with 49% of the vote.\nPPM candidate Moosa Fathuhy trailed with 40% as the candidate of the newly-formed Maldives National Party took 11%.\nThe result was incommensurate to the millions spent in an “abuse of state resources“, opposition leaders argued, referring to development projects hastily launched on the three islands in Shaviyani atoll. The PPM vice president also alleged the creation of 50 government jobs and payouts from state assets to coalition party leaders Qasim Ibrahim and Sheikh Imran Abdulla in exchange for throwing their support behind the MDP candidate.\n19 January 2022\nYameen Rasheed murder suspects convicted\nIsmail Haisham Rasheed and Ahmed Zihan Ismail were found guilty over the brutal murder of liberal blogger Yameen Rasheed and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n7 January 2022\nOpposition’s “India Out” protests escalate with arrests.\nNearly 30 people were arrested as police cracked down on daily protests outside the PPM office in Malé.\nThe ‘India Out’ campaign intensified after former president Yameen’s release from prison as he traveled to rally supporters and lead protests on several islands. The government is beholden to India after making a Faustian pact to win the 2018 election, he contended, warning that India was building a military presence and undermining the country’s independence, allegations dismissed as “misguided and unsubstantiated” by the MDP-led ruling coalition.\nThe campaign for the expulsion of Indian soldiers continued over the next two years. A protest march in June 2023 featured costumed performers wearing masks of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which the government strongly condemned as a “disrespectful act by the opposition” that “not only provoke hatred, but also promote hostility with the objective of tarnishing the country’s long-standing cordial ties with India.”\n4 January 2022\nCharges raised over Filipino nurse murder.\nCharges over the alleged murder of Mary Grace were pressed against her husband Marvin Vargas and his Maldivian lover Haleemath Lamha.\nBoth the victim and defendants worked as nurses at the Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital in the capital. Vargas was accused of assaulting and strangling his wife to death in the couple’s residence in Malé after midnight on 19 October 2021. The 24-year-old Maldivian woman was charged with aiding and abetting the murder.\nMary Grace’s death was reported by her husband as suicide by hanging. But suspicions prompted a police investigation and a postmortem determined that she died of head injuries.\n26 December 2021\nACC members resign ahead of impeachment vote\nThree members resigned from the Anti-Corruption Commission a day after parliament’s independent institutions committee recommended no-confidence votes over their failure to conclude graft cases.\nThe five-member watchdog blamed a lack of adequate time and resources. The outgoing commissioners – including the ACC’s president Mariyam Shiuna, vice president Fathmath Anoola, and member Aishath Abdulla – accused lawmakers of trying to influence their work and alleged “external and internal” efforts to derail investigations.\nThe other two members, Ibrahim Shakeel and Ali Ashraf, resigned earlier after the parliament’s oversight committee initiated the dismissal process. The resignations came amid growing frustration over the lack of progress in the investigation of the previous administration’s US$90 million resort lease corruption scandal.\n30 November 2021\nYameen’s conviction overturned.\nThe opposition leader was freed from house arrest after the Supreme Court overturned his bribery and money laundering conviction.\nThe prosecution failed to conclusively prove that US$1 million in his bank account came from stolen funds, a three-judge panel ruled.\n8 November 2021\nMinimum wage introduced.\nBased on research and consultation by an advisory board, monthly pay was set at MVR 4,500 for small businesses, MVR 7,000 for the civil service and medium-sized enterprises, and MVR 8,000 for large businesses such as resorts.\nMicro-enterprises - businesses that do not earn an annual profit of MVR 75,000 - were exempted.\n25 October 2021\nMNP registered.\nThe newly-formed Maldives National Party led by MPs Mohamed Nazim, Abdulla Riyaz and Ahmed Usham was officially registered.\nMNP leader Nazim, a retired colonel and former defence minister, declared willingness to work with other parties but ruled out cooperation with former president Yameen.\n14 October 2021\nDhagethi businessman murdered.\nThe body of 57-year-old Mahmood Abubakuru was found inside a well.\nShah Alom Mia, a Bangladeshi man known as Salim, was arrested two days later. He confessed in court to killing the victim during an attempted robbery.\n6 August 2021\nMDP MP Ali Riza charged with human trafficking.\nThe MP for Milandhoo faced charges over the alleged mistreatment and non-payment of salaries for 200 migrant workers employed by his RIX construction company to develop a resort.\nThe charges against Riza were dropped in June 2023 as the US State Department expressed concern over “corruption and official complicity in trafficking crimes.” The government failed to “proactively investigate trafficking crimes and did not identify any labour trafficking victims despite the prevalence of labour trafficking indicators among migrant workers” and “did not hold accountable government officials allegedly complicit in human trafficking crimes,” the annual trafficking in persons report noted.\n21 June 2021\nMurdered 13-year-old boy stuffed in suitcase.\nThe suitcase with the body was found in the Hulhumalé lagoon two days after he was reported missing.\nTwo acquaintances of the victim, Ibrahim Zihaan, 27, and a 17-year-old boy, were arrested on charges of murder and sexual abuse.\n8 June 2021\nForeign Minister elected UN President.\nAbdulla Shahid defeated former Afghan Foreign Minister Zalmai Rassoul 143-48 in a secret ballot.\n6 May 2021\nNasheed survives assassination attempt.\nFormer President Nasheed sustained life-threatening injuries after an improvised explosive device was remotely detonated as he walked to his car from his residence in Malé.\nThe 53-year-old speaker of parliament underwent surgery for over 16 hours to remove shrapnel and treat wounds to his head, chest, and abdomen.\nAdhuham Ahmed Rasheed, 26, who confessed to detonating the IED, was sentenced to 23 years in prison in December 2021. Two other suspects, Abdulla Ali Manik and Mohamed Thasleem, were arrested as the architects of the bomb plot. But they were charged with supporting a terrorist organisation with the former sentenced to five years in prison whilst his co-defendant was acquitted.\nThe Prosecutor General’s office decided not to raise charges against Ahmed Fathih over lack of evidence. The terrorism trials of Thahmeen Ahmed, Mujaz Ahmed, Ali Haisham, Mohamed Nazim, Ishaq and Fahmy Ali proceeded at a slow pace.\n10 April 2021\nMuizzu elected Malé mayor.\nThe former housing minister was elected as mayor of the capital, a stronghold of the MDP, which lost its majority on the city council for the first time.\nBut the ruling party fared better in the rest of the country.\n8 February 2021\n17-year-old killed in gang violence\nAhmed Udhayyu was stabbed to death during a fight between rival gangs in Gaaf Alif Maamendhoo.\nThree adults and a minor were charged over the first gang-related killing since 2019.\n1 February 2021\nNational vaccination programme begins.\nWith 100,000 doses donated by India, free vaccination was offered to all residents, including undocumented migrant workers.\nBy August, 85% of the adult population was fully inoculated.\nNovember 2020\nEx-tourism minister charged with sexual assault.\nAli Waheed was sacked after the alleged sexual abuse of several female staff surfaced in July 2020.\nAfter the trial started, the former MDP chairman and president of the Jumhooree Party went into exile in the UK when the judge authorised medical leave.\nThree years later, the charges were withdrawn after the victims and witnesses retracted their statements.\n5 October 2020\nEx-VP sentenced under plea bargain\nAhmed Adeeb, 38, was jailed for 20 years after pleading guilty under a plea deal.\nThe charges stemmed from a corruption scandal in which US$90 million was stolen during former president Yameen’s administration, the bulk of which was resort acquisition fees siphoned off through a private company.\n16 August 2020\nAudit uncovers graft in ventilator procurement\nA compliance audit flagged suspected foul play over US$2 million advance payments made to a Dubai company for 75 ventilators in April 2020.\nOnly 15 ventilators were delivered, of which five did not meet specifications. The Anti-Corruption Commission sought criminal charges against 11 officials, including former health minister Abdulla Ameen. But the Prosecutor General declined to press charges, citing the suspension of public finance rules for the pandemic emergency response.\n“The upfront payment of 90 per cent of the total value, the use of single source procurement procedures using false information, the absence of a performance and advance payments guarantee, and selecting a brand of ventilators that was not agreed by the Bid Committee in order to award the contract to Executors General Trading all show that an unfair advantage was given to a particular party,” Transparency Maldives observed, calling on the state to ensure accountability and recover lost funds.\n15 July 2020\nMaldives reopens borders.\nThe Maldives was an outlier as most countries kept their borders sealed at the height of the pandemic.\nTourists only needed a negative PCR test, an online health declaration and a hotel booking to enter without any requirement to quarantine. The government hoped to take advantage of resorts located on private islands.\nThe gamble paid off as tourist arrivals reached the modest target for 2020. Most major airlines followed the lead of Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad Airways to resume flights before the peak season in November. More than 94% of resorts were back in operation by the end of the year. By mid-2021, all border control staff and over 95% of resort workers were fully vaccinated. In October 2021, the Maldives welcomed the millionth tourist of the year as arrivals reached 70% of pre-pandemic levels.\nCNN hailed the country as “the biggest 2020 international tourism success story.” The destination has “pandemic travel down to a fine art,” the South China Morning Post reported. A Maldives-India air travel bubble established in August 2020 proved vital as India became the largest source market. Tourists from India, Russia and Eastern Europe helped offset both the low numbers from traditional Western European markets and the complete absence of Chinese tourists.\n30 April 2020\n83-year-old dies in first Covid-19 fatality.\nThe immunocompromised woman died en route to the hospital.\nThe death toll climbed to 48 by the end of the year. Despite the successful rollout of vaccines in early 2021, the country suffered the worst outbreak amid a third wave driven by a new variant. The highest death toll came in May 2021 and accounted for nearly half of all Covid-19 fatalities.\nThe public health emergency ended in March 2022 and the number of deaths stood at 316 in December 2023.\n15 April 2020\nMalé placed under lockdown.\nThe stay-at-home order for residents of the densely-packed capital came hours after the confirmation of community transmission.\nMovement in and out of the Greater Malé Region was banned. Public transport was suspended to the suburbs of Hulhumalé and Vilimalé. After several extensions, lockdown restrictions were gradually eased by mid-June. But a nightly curfew remained in place.\n27 March 2020\nMaldives closes borders for first time.\nThe impact on the tourism-dependent economy was devastating.\nGDP contracted by an unprecedented 33.5% - the third worst in the world in 2020 and far worse than the 13% drop after the Indian Ocean tsunami. More than half of those who sought income support were tourism workers who were either unemployed or put on no pay leave or reduced salaries.\nThe World Bank estimated a 10.5 % rise in the poverty rate.\n12 March 2020\nPublic health emergency declared.\nThe first person to test positive was an Italian tourist on 7 March 2020.\nThe emergency response came as more cases were detected from resort islands. Over the next week, government offices, schools and guesthouses were closed. Congregational prayers and travel from resorts to inhabited islands were banned. A 14-day mandatory quarantine was imposed for persons entering the country with resorts converted to quarantine centres.\n1 February 2020\nMaldives rejoins the Commonwealth\nFaced with the threat of suspension over political prisoners and the reversal of democratic gains, former president Yameen took the country out of the Commonwealth in October 2016, alleging “unfair and unjust” treatment.\nThe Maldives returned as the 54th member of the group a year after his successor took office. The new government also followed Saudi Arabia in restoring ties with Qatar (March 2021) and Iran (March 2023).",
