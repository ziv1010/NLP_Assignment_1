  "body_text": "Following on from the World Cup draw in Washington, D.C. earlier this month, FIFA will be hosting its annual Best Awards in Qatar on Tuesday.\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino, who handed U.S. President Donald Trump the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize at a memorable World Cup ceremony, will be in Doha for the event, where world football’s governing body announces its opinions on, among other categories, who were the best men’s and women’s players in 2025.\nAdvertisement\nReal Madrid and Brazil forward Vinicius Junior won the men’s award in 2024, with Barcelona and Spain midfielder Aitana Bonmati receiving the women’s version.\nFIFA says the gala dinner will be attended by 800 guests, including FIFA Council members, former players and other representatives from its many member associations worldwide.\nWhat are the FIFA Best awards?\nFIFA has been hosting its own awards ceremony for over three decades. Previously known as the FIFA World Player of the Year, the show switched to its current title in 2016.\nIt was established to recognise the finest players and coaches in the world game, based on their performances throughout a calendar year.\nThe first edition of the FIFA Best awards was for the year 2016 (the ceremony was in January 2017), with Cristiano Ronaldo, then at the peak of his powers playing for Real Madrid, finishing ahead of Lionel Messi in second and Antoine Griezmann in third for the men’s award. He also won the trophy for 2017, pipping Messi and Neymar in second and third, before Luka Modric beat Ronaldo and Mohamed Salah the following year.\nIn its current guise, Messi has won the men’s trophy three times (for 2019, 2022 and 2023), more than anyone else, with Ronaldo and Robert Lewandowski (2020 and 2021) each being honoured twice.\nIn recent years, the women’s award has been dominated by the Barcelona duo of Alexia Putellas, who won it consecutively for 2021 and 2022, and Bonmati, who has won the two most recent editions. Carli Lloyd, the former USWNT star, won the initial trophy for 2016.\nIs it like the Ballon d’Or?\nSimilar, but the FIFA awards are arguably not yet as prestigious, given the illustrious status and history of the Ballon d’Or.\nThe Ballon d’Or, which has been running since 1956, is an annual award that is presented by France Football, a French magazine, each autumn based on performances in the previous season. It used to be awarded only to European players but in 1995 became a global prize. George Weah was the first and so far only African player to win it that year.\nAdvertisement\nFIFA and the Ballon d’Or partnered between 2010 and 2015, with the award known as the FIFA Ballon d’Or in those years.\nParis Saint-Germain and France forward Ousmane Dembele won the most recent Ballon d’Or in September after the French side clinched their first Champions League title with a resounding 5-0 defeat of Italy’s Inter at the end of last season.\nAre there just the two awards?\nThe two headline trophies are the best men’s and women’s players, but there are many other categories.\nFor both men’s and women’s football, there is a coach of the year award, as well as a best goalkeeper prize. There will also be best men’s and women’s all-star teams named, plus the FIFA Puskas Award and FIFA Marta Award for the most impressive goals scored in men’s and women’s football in 2025.\nLast year’s winners included Real Madrid and Brazil forward Vinicius Jr, who won best men’s player, with Carlo Ancelotti, then his manager at Madrid, picked as best men’s coach. Emiliano Martinez, of Aston Villa and world champions Argentina, was crowned best men’s goalkeeper. Emma Hayes, now in charge of the USWNT, won best women’s coach for her successes with Chelsea, and the United States’ Alyssa Naeher was the choice as best women’s goalkeeper.\nWho has been nominated this time?\nAlthough FIFA has yet to announce its 2025 shortlists, the award nominees were revealed at the beginning of November.\nPSG duo Dembele and Achraf Hakimi, their Morocco international right-back, are up for the men’s award, alongside Bayern Munich and England striker Harry Kane, Real Madrid and France forward Kylian Mbappe, Chelsea and England midfielder Cole Palmer, Liverpool and Egypt’s prolific goalscorer Salah and, among several others, Barcelona and Spain’s winger Lamine Yamal.\nThe best men’s coach nominees include PSG’s Luis Enrique, Mikel Arteta of Arsenal, Barcelona’s Hansi Flick, Arne Slot of Liverpool and Chelsea’s Enzo Maresca.\nAdvertisement\nOn the women’s side, Barcelona and Spain pair Bonmati and Putellas are in contention again, along with Lucy Bronze (Chelsea and England), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes and USWNT), Lauren James (Chelsea and England), Temwa Chawinga (Kansas City Current and Malawi) and the Arsenal quartet of Mariona Caldentey (Spain), Alessia Russo, Leah Williamson and Chloe Kelly (all England).\nSarina Wiegman (England), Seb Hines (Orlando Pride), Sonia Bompastor (Chelsea), Jonatan Giraldez (Washington Spirit/OL) and Renee Slegers (Arsenal) have been nominated for best women’s coach.\nThose in contention for the Puskas and Marta awards for the best goals of the year in the men’s and women’s games include Declan Rice of Arsenal and, fittingly, Orlando Pride star Marta herself.\nWho decides who wins?\nThe winners in the best player, coach and goalkeeper categories have been decided through a weighted voting system involving the current managers/head coaches and captains of all the men’s and women’s national teams, media representatives and fans.\nThere is also a FIFA-appointed panel of experts who have a say in the various categories. FIFA does not announce who sat on this panel until after the results are revealed tomorrow.\nOnce the winners have been announced, FIFA then releases a list that details who the national-team coaches and captains voted for.\nWhen will the results be announced?\nWe will learn the winners of the various awards on Tuesday, from a gala dinner in Doha, Qatar.\nEvents will be streamed live on FIFA.com, the body’s official website, from 5pm UK time (12pm ET; 9am PST).\nWhy is it taking place in Qatar?\nJust as they were in 2024, this year’s awards are being held in Doha.\nThis coincides with the final of the FIFA Intercontinental Cup — the annual competition formerly known as the Club World Cup — between 2024-25 UEFA Champions League winners PSG and Brazilian side Flamengo, champions of this year’s Copa Libertadores tournament in South America, at Qatar’s Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium on Wednesday.\nThere is also a FIFA Council meeting in Doha on Wednesday, just over two months on from October’s get-together in Zurich, Switzerland.\nTuesday’s gala dinner and awards ceremony is being held at the Fairmont Katara Hall.",
