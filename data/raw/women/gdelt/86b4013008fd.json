  "body_text": "The fourth day of the inquest into the brutal murders of five people in Keyham in 2021 resumes today. Wednesday saw a harrowing day of witness statements and police CCTV footage was shown to the jury, setting out Jake Davison's movements on the day of his shooting rampage. The inquest also heard from several neighbours who witnessed the shocking incident. One told the jury that three-year-old Sophie Martyn and her dad were found cradling each other in their arms after they were shot.\nOn Thursday police released an image of the pump-action shotgun Davison used in the fatal rampage. It was also revealed how many shotgun certificates were held in Devon and Cornwall at the time of the shooting.\nSenior coroner Ian Arrow has previously said that the inquest will look at 10 key points. In addition Bridget Dolan, KC, a specialist barrister who has experience assisting with complex and controversial inquests - such as the deaths of soldiers at Deepcut Barracks, murders by Al Qaida terrorists and a death during police restraint - has been brought in to assist with the inquests of the five Keyham shooting victims. In this first inquest, Mr Arrow will be examining the deaths of Stephen Washington, aged 59; Kate Shepherd, aged 66; Maxine Davison, aged 51; Sophie Martyn, aged three; and her father, Lee Martyn, aged 43. Only once this inquest has concluded Mr Arrow will hold another inquest into the death of Jake Davison, aged 22.\nPartner agencies have set up a website, Plymouth Together, providing details on the support and help available, along with information on the Community Hub, fundraising and latest events in the area, as well as the action plan for the area's recovery.

If you need help or support, you can get advice here.\nInquest adjourns\nThe inquest has been adjourned for today and will resume again next Monday at 9am.\nTraining of firearms unit staff and evidence summary\nWhen asked about staff training, Supt Sherwood said: “There was training - just not a bespoke course.” She added: “That was the same for 43 forces.”\nDominic Adamson, counsel for families, summarised her evidence into key points and said: “Effectively there was no general command above you re as far as general firearms licensing concerned.\n“You to put it bluntly were spread too thin. You explained for three months you were unwell. There was no effective accountability or management of you of Michelle Moore [firearms licensing manager].\n“Overall the department was understaffed. There was a backlog of applications.”\nHe continued: “No evidence of dip sampling, no evidence of lessons learned of dip sampling, no accredited training, and no bespoke training created by Devon and Cornwall.”\nWhen stating case notes were not brought to her attention, Supt Sherwood replied: “No, some were but that would be on a case-by-case basis.”\n‘Lack of visibility' of super intendant staff claims\nA review of the unit in September 2021 found that with the exception of the unit's forearms licensing manager Michelle Moore, only one other person within the unit could name their current superintendent.\nIt was added the ‘lack of visibility’ was echoed by the unit’s deputy manager who said prior to the Keyham incident, he had not seen Supt Sherwood for two years since an award ceremony and had never spoken to her.\nSupt Sherwood said: “I think it came off the back of Covid and the majority of the team were working from home.”\nIt was noted she became the unit’s manager in 2019 - so had been in post by the time of the review for two years.\nWhen asked about the staff responses, she said: “It would be wrong of me to challenge that if that is their perception.”\nSeizing of weapons\nWhen asked about the seizing of weapons, Supt Sherwood said: “We do take weapons off people quite frequently.”\nWhen questioned by Mr Adamson whether it is a significant step, she added: “It is a necessary step.”\nGiven the scenario of someone who has committed a violent assault and taking the decision to return it, she said: “I would suggest it is even a more significant step.”\nShe added: “I would not return the weapon. I am trying to say it is a high-risk decision.”\nShe reminded the inquest she was never part decision-making chain for granting licenses.\nBacklog of firearms licence applications\nWhen asked how the department was coping with a large backlog of firearms licence applications, Dominic Anderson, counsel for the families said: “Is there a risk that if the focus is on the quantity of dealing with firearms licensing applications rather than quality that decisions will be rushed through or downgraded in ordered get through things quicker?\"\nSupt Sherwood said: “That pressure was never put on the department. That's for me to hold that tension… I never pushed that onto the department. I had absolute, and still do, trust and have confidence in Miss Moore [firearms licensing manager].”\nG7 impact\nSupt Sherwood told how the Chief Supt went off to plan the G7 summit and was ‘completely distracted'.She denied the G7 summit and world leaders' safety was more important than effective firearms safety in the region.\nUnit was 'understaffed'\nSupt Sherwood said: “I believe the unit was understaffed, particularly around Michelle Moore's role [fire arms licensing manager]. She did not have a deputy which is something I introduced in 2020.”\nSupt Sherwood, who was was in charge of overseeing the unit and had 532 staff, she said:\n“I was doing the job then that three superintendents now do… we had Covid period then G7.”\nWitness describes her role in the force\nSuperintendent Sherwood, in charge of overseeing the firearms unit, told how when Davison was granted his firearms license she was in a different role but was in her current role when his application was reviewed. She added she was never part of the decision-making chain for granting licenses.\n'We and others will learn from this'\nAddressing the families of the victims, she said it was ‘unimaginable what you have been through’,’ that she hoped in the next few weeks they would get the answers they seek and added: “We and others will learn from this.”\nInquest resumes\nThe next witness is superintendent Cara Sherwood of Devon and Cornwall Police.\nRecap of evidence heard this morning\nIt had been heard this morning that police were not given effective training on gun licence applications.\nIt was confirmed there was no specific training programme for firearms enquiry officers and no nationally accredited training.\nDominic Adamson, counsel for families, said: “The reality is such training was really through mentoring and looking at what other firearms enquiry officers were doing in other applications they were dealing with.”\nCh Supt Roy Linden confirmed there was an ‘absence of effective training’ as highlighted in the 2015 UK firearms licensing review. A national report in 2015 into the effectiveness of firearms licensing in UK predicted further tragedy unless action was taken to improve firearms licensing in the UK.\nSix years later Jake Davidson killed five people with a pump action shotgun on the streets on Keyham before then turning the gun on himself.\nCh Supt Linden said: “I am all too familiar with that paragraph sadly.”\nIt was also heard police should have obtained a medical opinion from Davison's GP before granting his shotgun licence.\nCh Supt Linden confirmed if it is not suppplied by a GP, chief officers police may reach own conclusions using their own ‘knowledge and experience’ and another alternative is seeking advice from a force medical officer or an approved practioneer.\nRegarding Home Office guidance he said: “One should be considered. The guidance does not say one has to be considered.”\nIt was also noted a ‘serious issue’ was identified when an independent audit committee called South West Audit Programme (SWAP) - an external body, without firearms expertise and not police officers - looked into administrative auditing following the merger of the two firearms units - Devon and Cornwall Police with Dorset Police - in 2018.\nOne of the reasons for the merger was said to save money.\nThe 2018/19 audit reviewed 30 firearms application licences and one of those looked at by SWAP identified problems with how the force’s ‘simple and effective’ risk matrix had been applied. The applicant was deemed to be ‘acceptable’ but according to the risk matrix as applied by the auditor, it should been ‘moderate’.\nInquest adjourns for lunch\nThe inquest will resume following a break for lunch. Ch Supt Roy Linden has now finished giving his evidence.\nWhen medical conditions are disclosed during a firearms application\nMr Fort, an advocate for the Home Office questioned what happens when a GP does not provide a response when a report is being sought over an applicant's medical condition.\nIt was confirmed under the heading of suitability, a person who has received treatment for certain illnesses or conditions such as depression or stress, in such cases accounts should be taken of the latest medical opinion.\nIn the case of Jake Davison, he did declare a relevant medical condition and according to the national firearms licencing model, it was not safe to proceed to a decision without relevant medical info.\nCh Supt Linden confirmed if it is not suppplied by a GP, chief officers police may reach own conclusions using their own ‘knowledge and experience’ and another alternative is seeking advice from a force medical officer or an approved practioneer.\nRegarding Home Office guidance he said: “One should be considered. The guidance does not say one has to be considered.”\nTraining of firearms enquiry officers\nIt was confirmed there was no specific training programme of firearms enquiry officers and no nationally accredited training.\nMr Adamson said: “The reality is such training was really through mentoring and looking at what other firearms enquiry officers were doing in other applications they were dealing with.”\nCh Supt Linden confirmed there was an ‘absence of effective training’ as highlighted in the 2015 UK firearms licensing review.\nPolicy questions over revoking weapons and explosives\nCh Supt Linden confirmed that the policy in existence for explosive and firearms unit was implemented in 2018.\nWithin that policy he was questioned about what happens when a firearms or shotgun licence holder is involved in a significant incident.\nMr Adamson said: “Any person within Devon and Cornwall Police force who comes into contact with someone with a certificate, either firearms or shotgun and is involved in an incident of violence or had mental health issues which are such they pose a risk should have firearms certificate and ammunition and explosive removed from them?”\nCh Supt Linden replied: “Yes, it’s really quite straightforward.”\nHe added: “All members of staff working in Devon and Cornwall should do what you have said and the firearm should be seized.”\nThe inquest has resumed\nFollowing questions surrounding the accuracy of the figures, the inquest has heard details of the number of new shotgun grants and renewal applications made from 2017 onwards should be disclosed at the hearing on Monday after they have been reviewed.\nCh Supt Linden said: “In preparation for the data provided for the inquest I sought information and asked the Firearms and Explosives Licencing Unit for data going back five years.”\nShort adjournment\nThe inquest has been adjourned for 20 minutes to find out the correct figures for the number of new shotgun grants and renewal applications made from 2017 onwards within Devon and Cornwall Police force.\nDamming national firearms review report in 2015 predicted future tragedy\nCh Supt Roy Linden of Devon and Cornwall Police is continuing to be questioned further about firearms licencing and the burden on Devon and Cornwall Police and the number of applications\nAn advocate questioning the officer, Dominic Adamson, counsel for the families, has referred to a national report in 2015 into the effectiveness of firearms licensing in UK. At the time the review was carried 2.8 per cent grant applications for shotguns were refused.\nThis report was critical of how firearms licensing was being delivered in the UK. It noted on too many occasions police were not following Home Office guidance, within many forces basic scrutiny was not in place and inconsistency was found to be a theme, including who was making decisions.\nThe report is said to have added forces were working outside Hone Office guidance and sometimes ‘inexcusably comprising public safety’. The report predicted further tragedy unless action was taken to improve firearms licensing in the UK.\nCh Supt Linden said: “I am all too familiar with that paragraph sadly.”\nImage of shotgun released\nAn image has been released showing the pump-action shotgun Jake Davison used to kill five people in Plymouth in 2021.\nDavison, 22, killed his mother Maxine, 51, after a row at their home in the Devon city on the evening of August 12.\nHe then shot dead Sophie Martyn, three, her father Lee, 43, Stephen Washington, 59, and Kate Shepherd, 66, in the Keyham area of the city.\nDavison, an apprentice crane operator, turned the black Weatherby pump-action shotgun on himself before armed police officers reached him.\nThe image has been released to highlight the similarities between Davison's weapon and tactical weapons which are issued to trained police officers, as well as the difference between Davison's weapon and a standard shotgun used for sport.\nIT issues\nChief Supt Linden explained there were a number of IT systems - STORM, UNIFI, NICHE, PNC.\nA 999 call gets put on STORM and has details of the address of every firearms licence holder. If it leads to a criminal investigation that leads to action it would go onto UNIFI, a records managing system (a local system and each of the 43 forces has its own version)\nUNIFI is currently transferring to NICHE ssystem and the Police National Computer has a database on convictions.\nThe National Firearms Licensing Management System is a national database of all firearm/shotgun holders.\nMs Dolan asked queried the amount of work involved and Chief Supt Linden noted that staff would have to cross-check the disparate systems. He noted that there was no interaction between the computer systems and thus the firearms licensing departments were not \"automatically informed\" if an incident had taken place.\nMs Dolan asked that, in effect, was it the case that if an alleged incident of violence occurred and it was learned they were a licence holder then the licensing department would have to be manually informed. Chief Supt Linden concurred, noting that the \"lack of an automated system\" was a risk to the force, and relied on an attending officer noting the incident, learning that the individual involved was a registered firearm or shotgun certificate holder, and then informing the licensing unit.\nHe also revealed that while there were a number of relevant courses, such as courses in domestic violence and safeguarding and risk identification, there was no particular package for licensing officers - and no national consolidated training package.\nAs such new licensing officers were reliant on \"on-the-job\" training. He said there was a \"reliance on mentoring and on-the-job mentoring\" to learn the processes needed to carry out the role of a firearms licensing officer.\nGP replies\nChief Supt Linden said that having no response or decline to provide information to repond from GPs was \"not a rare occurance\" before 2017 and before 2021.\nHe said this was a national issue discussed by the organisations involved and that Devon and Cornwall Police was \"not an isolated occurance.\" across the country.\nAsked if there was a policy in place on what to do if they happened (a GP declining to provide information) Chief Supt Liden said \"no, there was not\".\nMs Dolan queried if this was a case of the guidance not being realistic about what was happening at the coal face.\nDiscussion of the force's \"risk matrix\" for grant, renewal, review of certificate\nChief Supt Roy Linden explained that there was no national risk matrix and that D&C Police created their own - which has the likelihood of an event and the potential impact of the event on an x & y graph.\nHe agreed that a \"red risk\" on the matrix would need to be assessed by a firearms licensing manager (in Devon and Cornwall Michelle Moore) rather than a firearms licensing officer.\nWhile the default setting would be to refuse to grant an application if there was a previous assault against a person, there was an understanding that every case should be assessed on its own merits.\nAs for offences by certificate holders he explained that an offence does not automatically result in revocations - it was the detail of the incident which needed to be assessed.\nNumbers\nChief Supt Linden confirmed that Devon and Cornwall area has the highest number of shotgun and firearm certificates in the country. Not by per capita - just the largest in the UK.\nIn 2017, when Davison applied, the force had 30,588 shotgun certificates in total and 11,132 firearms certs in total - just above 40,000.\nNew shotgun licence applications in 2017 were 301 and renewals were 1,713.\nNew firearm licence applications in 2017 were 264 and 889 renewals.\nHe said the 3,000 new and renewals were \"roughly constant\" since then and this was \"an average year\".\nAugust 2021 was \"pretty much the same\".\nAsked if there were sufficient staff to deal with 3,000 new and renewals per year, he said the \"simple answer was no\"\nHe confirmed there was a backlog at that time and that backlog was not unique to Devon and Cornwall, and in conclusion that leads one to say there was not enough staff. Asked if that backlog still exists he said it did. Asked if it was the same size, he said \"no, they've probably increased\"\nHowever, he noted that the number of offences involving weapons was 6.9 offences per 100,000 in Devon and Cornwall while there were 9.6 offences per 100,000 nationally.\nAlliance with Dorset\nChief Supt Linden reveals that financial pressures saw Devon and Cornwall form an alliance with neighbour Dorset and in 2018 it was made formal. This resulted in the two firearms licensing departments becoming a single unit.\nHe explained the structure of the system with regard to firearms licensing. At the top is the Chief Constable, followed by the Assistant Chief Constable, then the Superintendent for Operations (Supt Cara Sherwood) then the firearms licensing manager (staff Michelle Moore) and the deputy head of firearms licensing (not filled at the time of the shooting) then the firearms licensing supervisor (staff Stephen Carder) and the alliance firearms inquiry officers (staff David Rees).\nHe noted that firearms licensing officers were police staff, not warranted officers.\nChief Supt Roy Linden of Devon and Cornwall Police\nHe addressed the family offering his condolences, saying his responsibilities go beyond this inquest to them and the community.\nHe said he would be \"candid\" in his responses to the inquest which would \"serve to drive improvements across Devon and Cornwall Police and nationally\"\nHe states he has been made silver commander which oversees a number of issues in co-ordinating the action needed in the wake of the Keyham shooting, the investigation, the delivery of policing to assist the community, the organisational learning, and responses by Devon and Cornwall Police.\nHe said this would include working from the Durham Peer review of 2021, the IOPC investigation, the standard debrief of the College of Policing from 2021 to 2022, the debrief by the Local Resilience Forum which tackles civil contingencies, the Domestic Homicide review which is still ongoing and \"any other learning from this incident\". He emphasises that all these reviews are independent of Devon and Cornwall Police\nFurther questions\nIn reply to Bridget Dolan KC, counsel to coroner, Supt Davis confirms that pump-action shotguns would be considered unsuitable for clay pigeon shooting as the action of pumping would interrupt the shooting process and thus were not as advantageous for accurate sport shooting as the classic over and under double barrel shotgun.\nStephen Brassington, for Dr Dawson (on of Jake's GPs) asked him that if there was medical evidence offered by the applicant which prompted the firearms licensing team's \"professional curiosity\" then it was part of the role to pursue \"further inquiries to seek clarity\" - Supt Davis agreed.\nDijen Basu KC for Warwickshire Police and NPCC lead for firearms asked about a 17-year-old with no licence going to private land with certificate holder. Supt Davis said they would be allowed to shoot.\nRegarding the seizure of firearms, shotguns and ammunition Supt Davis was asked what powers police had to seize them. Supt Davis said that they could seek voluntary surrender \"if we fear a breach of the peace a warrant under the Firearms Act\" could be used and officers could get a search warrant from the Magistrates Court.\nOr they could revoke the certificate and then go and seize the weapons. He added that there were \"lots of different options\".\nFiona Barton KC for Devon and Cornwall Police asked whether the pandemic itself may have affected the ability of firearms licensing officers to carry out a home visit.\nSupt Davis said that he was working in custody during the pandemic and it had a \"significant impact\" on custody \"and I can imagine it had a significant impact on licensing\"\nAdam Chaplin legal representative for David Rees, firearms inquiry officer at the time\nRegarding the shotgun and its use for clay pigeon shooting (which suggests this is the 'good reason' Davison had the shotgun although this has still not been explicitly stated in the inquest) Mr Chaplin asked Supt Davis a few questions which appeared to flummox the officer.\nSupt Davis revealed that he had been shooting for 36 years, ostensibly clay pigeon shooting.\nMr Chaplin noted that there were the more 'traditional' shotguns used, such as over and under the double barrel, as well as the side by side and others.\nSupt Davis said the \"vast majority [of clay pigeon shooters] use over and under, some use side by side\".\nAsked about the use of a pump action shotgun - which was wielded by Davison in the Keyham shooting - used in clay pigeon shooting Supt Davis replied said: \"I've seen pump action only once in 36 years and it stands out\".\nAsk if he knew of commercial providers who put on clay pigeon shooting events - such as stag dos - who specifically use pump-action shotguns, Supt Davis replied \"I've never seen that, no\".",
