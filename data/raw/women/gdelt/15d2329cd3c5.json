He later helped Prince William present the trophy to United, who beat their rivals Manchester City 2-1.\nPrince William, who is president of the Football Association, walked on to the pitch to cheers from the crowd ahead of the showdown and he shook hands with both teams.\nIt was a much needed victory for United's Dutch manager Erik ten Hag, who has overseen United's worst league season in 34 years. He is widely expected to lose his job despite the win.\nGeorge and his father are both passionate Aston Villa fans and have attended several matches at Villa Park in Birmingham this year. Their public appearance yesterday is likely to be one of only a handful made by the Royal Family after it postponed engagements which may appear to divert attention from the General Election campaign.\nThe ten-year-old looked glum and even yawned at one point as he sat next to his father, the Prince of Wales\nUnited's stellar performance as they beat rivals Manchester City seemed not to impress the young prince\nManchester United's former manager and legend Sir Alex Ferguson leapt out of his seat as the Reds scored their first goal in the FA Cup final yesterday... but Prince George was clearly not impressed\nPrince William and his eldest son George presented the FA Cup to winners Manchester United - with the ecstatic team then jumping for joy as they celebrated their 2-1 win over Manchester City.\nThe royal football fans looked smart in matching navy suits, white shirts and striped ties as they watched the dramatic clash in a packed Wembley Stadium.\nThe Prince of Wales awarded the runners-up medals to members of the City squad, with George smiling as he shook hands with manager Pep Guardiola.\nWilliam, who is the Football Association's president, then handed medals to the jubilant United team, including captain Bruno Fernandes and manager Erik Ten Hag.\nThe players proudly held up the trophy in front of the royals and cheered along with the roaring crowd as they took turns raising it into the air.\nThe father and son enjoyed the match alongside tens of thousands of fans from the Royal Box, and 10-year-old George looked animated as he experienced the highs and lows of the cup final.\nManchester United manager Erik ten Hag shakes hands with Prince George after winning the FA Cup as Britain's Prince William looks on\nPrince George shakes hands with Pep Guardiola, Manager of Manchester City\nPrince William grinned as he awarded Erik Ten Hag a medal before handing the trophy to his club\nThe players stood in front of Prince William and his eldest son George after they were each handed their medals\nThe Prince of Wales, who is the Football Association's president, handed the trophy to Man Utd\nThe pair chatted conspiratorially as they laughed together while they watched the start of the match\nManchester City star Phil Foden beamed alongside Erling Haaland - as he shook hands with the delighted Prince\nPrince George shared a sweet moment with his father as he smoothed back his styled hair and the heir to the throne whispered in his ear\nGeorge joined in cheering the Manchester United goals - as he wore a matching tie to his father in a mini-me ensemble\nGeorge looked on intently at the gripping game, as Manchester United struck ahead from City\nGeorge raised a hand to his face in a yawn at one point, as he joined the huge crowds for the final\nChatting in the front row of the box, the father-and-son duo laughed together as the game started. George shared a sweet moment with his father as he smoothed back his styled hair and William whispered in his ear\nBefore kick-off, the Prince of Wales walked onto the pitch to cheers from the crowd where the two teams were lined up.\nPhil Foden looked delighted as he shook hands with William as they waited anxiously for the game to begin.\nWhile Manchester City attacking midfielder gripped his hand and exchanged a few words he grinned hear to ear - with Erling Haaland smirking happily in the background as he saw his friend's excitement.\nBut Foden's delight was to be short lived - as United won 2-1 thanks to goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo despite a late strike from Jeremy Doku.\nPrince George could be seen on his feet and cheering in the stands as he celebrated the scores among elated fans.\nSitting alongside them in the box, Manchester United bosses Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Avram Glazer could be seen cheering wildly alongside legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson.\nThe 41-year-old's attendance at the showpiece game in North West London in front of 90,000 fans was confirmed by palace officials at 9.30am this morning.\nPrince George joined the crowds in the stands at the final - looking smart as he wore a matching tie, white shirt and navy suit to his father\nManchester United bosses Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Avram Glazer celebrate alongside legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson after Kobbie Mainoo of Manchester United scores a goal to make it 2-0, as William and George watched on\nThe Manchester side of the box look delighted as Kobbie Mainoo slotted home the team's second, as William and George watched on intently\nGeorge and William look on intently as they watch the thrilling game unfold at Wembley\nWilliam ended the line-up by chatting with Marcus Rashford - who he awarded with an MBE in 2021 in recognition of his campaign for free school meals\nThe Prince of Wales looks debonair as he appeared at the game before kickoff\nWilliam chatted with Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes before the game\nIt comes after the Royal Family revealed on Wednesday that it had postponed engagements 'which may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign' after Rishi Sunak called a surprise summer General Election for July 4.\nWilliam's previous FA Cup appearances have not all been so smooth - in 2022 he was booed by thousands of fans ahead of the match between Liverpool and Chelsea.\nFans gesticulated and made obscene hand gestures while the solemn Prince stood singing God Save the Queen.\nThe outburst by thousands of fans shocked the nation and was denounced across the political spectrum - with Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle saying: 'I utterly condemn any fans who booed Prince William at Wembley today.\nPrince William went diligently along the line as he wished each player luck before the game\nWilliam made his way along the Manchester United line, as he chatted with an animated Erik Ten Haag\nFernandes' teammates stood tall and watched on as their captain met the Prince\nManchester United manager Erik Ten Haag had an animated chat with William, after a difficult year at the club\nThe Prince of Wales walks on to the pitch ahead of the Emirates FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium\nWilliam shook hands with and chatted with Rashford, who he has repeatedly met in the past\nDefender Nathan Ake could barely contain himself as he grinned widely and leaned in to shake the Prince's hand\nThe Prince of Wales looked thrilled as he walked onto the pitch to the cheers of the crowd\nWilliam started as he chatted with England star and Manchester City captain Kyle Walker\nJohn Stones looked delighted as he shook hands and chatted briefly with the Prince before the game\nThe officials beamed as William thanked them ahead of the game's start\nThe jeers started during a rendition of the Christian hymn Abide With Me by the 60-strong B Positive Choir, whose members have sickle cell disease or who have close friends or family suffering from it.\nIt erupted again as Prince William was introduced to the crowd and began shaking the hands of the players. The booing and jeers reached their peak during the National Anthem.\nConnor O'Neill, football writer for the Liverpool Echo, said Liverpool fans 'are well known' for booing God Save The Queen at Wembley and claimed that the reasons date from the city's antipathy towards Margaret Thatcher's Tory government in the 1980s.\nFormer BBC Royal Correspondent Michael Cole described the booing as 'disgraceful and deplorable' and called for the Football Association to take action.\nHe also criticised BBC football commentators for failing to even mention the Liverpool fans' 'repulsive behaviour'.\nLast year - when the competition again came down to Man Utd and Man City - William shared a warm smile and a brief chat with Marcus Rashford before attention tuned to the pitch. He awarded the footballer with an MBE in 2021 in recognition of his campaign for free school meals.\nThe Prince's beloved Villa exited the FA Cup three months ago on February 7 after a 3-1 home defeat to Chelsea in a fourth round replay.\nBut last week William hailed Villa for qualifying to play Champions League football next season, praising their 'historic season' and 'amazing achievement'.\nPosting on his Kensington Royal X account, William wrote: 'We are Champions League!

I was looking around for clubs.\n'All my friends at school were either Man United fans or Chelsea fans and I didn't want to follow the run of the mill teams.\n'I wanted to have a team that was more mid-table that could give me more emotional rollercoaster moments. Aston Villa's always had a great history.'\nThe Prince said he has friends who support Villa and one of his first FA Cup games was against Bolton Wanderers in 2000, which Villa won but went on to lose to Chelsea in the final.\nHe added: 'It was fantastic, I sat with all the fans with my red beanie on, and I was sat with all the Brummie fans and had a great time.\n'It was the atmosphere, the camaraderie and I really felt that there was something I could connect with.'\nSpeaking in February 2020, William also said: 'People like Paul Merson were playing and I thought if people like him can play as well as he does, knowing the struggles he was under at the time... this is a club I can support.\n'I was also born in '82, the year we won the (European) Cup, so I feel the history and pedigree around Villa has always been quite close to me.'\nUnited endured a dismal season, finishing in their lowest-ever Premier League position\nINEOS chief and Red Devils part owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe (right) is believed to have already made the decision to sack Ten Hag regardless of the outcome of Saturday's FA Cup final at Wembley\nIn addition, the Prince often tweets about football and last month also posted a message congratulating the Lionesses' Rachel Daly on her retirement.\nEven before the match kicked off this afternoon the FA Cup final was wracked with controversy - as Erik ten Hag hit out at Manchester United fans for having 'no sense of reality' amid their 11-year title drought in an incendiary interview.\nThe embattled manager is believed to be heading for the exit at Old Trafford regardless of whether his side triumphs at Wembley on Saturday against their crosstown rivals after two season in charge at the Manchester club.\nTen Hag has been defiant in his stance that he remains in the plans of Man United's new minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS team since the petrochemicals billionaire took over the running of football operations in February.\nBut under the Dutchman, the club has faltered to its worst-ever Premier League finish in eighth, and European football next term is dependent on today's result.\nSpeaking to Dutch outlet VI, Ten Hag stressed that the club's aspirations were too high for the reality of its current straits.\n'Manchester United won the league for the last time in 2013, 11 years ago,' Ten Hag told journalist Freek Jansen. 'But still they expect us to win every game while competing at the top.\n'This club is not ready for that.\nThe M1 pictured at a standstill just hours before Man City and Man United play each other at Wembley in the FA Cup final\nOne fan posted this picture on social media showing football fans standing outside their car on the M1 as they try to work out what is going on\n'We were supposed to start building something and we made the first steps last year, but then you find out how big this club is and that nobody is ever satisfied.\n'Within the club people were satisfied, but outside the club there was noise by saying I won only the Carabao Cup, lost the FA Cup Final and came third.'\nAnd as fans make their way to Wembley to watch Manchester City take on Manchester United, with just hours before kick off many found themselves stuck in huge queues as families flocked to enjoy the hot weather.\nOne fan posted a picture on X of people standing outside their cars on the M1, writing the caption: 'Little warning to those heading down to Wembley on the M1. Been stuck at Leicester for 30 minutes. Looks like a major incident.\n'Nothing coming northbound, either. Huge queues.
