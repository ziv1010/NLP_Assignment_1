With that being said, we know it's difficult - but that's the ambition.\n\"This can fill us with belief as we can see it can result in a trophy with the way we work.\"\n'It feels better when you can give back'\nArsenal outwitted and outplayed Chelsea from the moment striker Stina Blackstenius coolly slotted in the crucial equaliser after 16 minutes to cancel out Sam Kerr's opener.\nThey pressed with intensity, created various goalscoring opportunities and forced Chelsea into tactical changes - none of which paid off.\nCaptain Kim Little ran the show in midfield, deservedly getting a goal and picking up the player-of-the-match award.\nIt was fitting that she would be the one to lift the trophy, having made her debut for the club in 2008 and played a role in Arsenal's glory years, including four of their previous five League Cup titles.\n\"When you thought she couldn't get any better, she puts on that performance,\" said Eidevall.\n\"I thought she was phenomenal. She played close to a perfect match. It is a trait of a great player to be able to have a performance like that when it matters the most.\"\nWilliams added: \"It's nice to see what it means to these players. It has been a long time for Arsenal and winners want to lift silverware.\n\"It looked like Arsenal wanted it more. They had more fire in their belly. Arsenal's players had an attitude out there and Kim Little in particular stood up.\"\nConstant reminders of Arsenal's poor record against Chelsea - and the Blues' dominance in domestic cup finals of late - underpinned the build-up to Sunday's final.\nEnding that run in a match of such significance felt a significant breakthrough for the Gunners. Victory prompted an outpouring of emotion at full-time. Players ran over to supporters to celebrate, and club legend Ian Wright later congratulated the team in the dressing room. Eidevall praised the \"connection\" within the club.\n\"For me it was nice to see the happiness from the staff, the players and to see a club legend like Ian Wright come down to the dressing room, to share that moment with him,\" he added.\n\"It shows that connection we have and I'm really happy we could share that moment again. I am lost for words talking about our fans and the atmosphere they provide. I think it's special.\n\"I can't take that for granted. It's special people who support our club so it feels even better when you can give that back.\"\n'There was complacency - they wanted it more'\nAfter beating Arsenal 2-0 seven days ago, Emma Hayes was understandably frustrated by her side's performance as they were second-best throughout.\n\"Arsenal showed hunger in everything they did and really went after it,\" said former Gunners defender Anita Asante.\n\"They have gone toe-to-toe with, if not dominated, a Chelsea side who have dominated this competition for so many years.\"\nIt was a second successive loss in the League Cup final for Chelsea, who were beaten by Manchester City in 2022, and Hayes said it was down to \"complacency\".\n\"The difference was a team that has won a lot and a team that hasn't. They won the duels and they were at a better intensity than us. The best team won, there's no doubt,\" she added.\n\"I'm disappointed with us - you can't concede three goals against a team that haven't won a lot, which they haven't domestically. But they wanted it more.\n\"You have to win your battles and we didn't do that. When you don't do those things sometimes you need a reality check.\n\"There was complacency - we won a lot and they haven't and they wanted it more than us.
