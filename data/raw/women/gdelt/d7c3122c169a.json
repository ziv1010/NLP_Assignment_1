But perhaps the most devastating of all these had to be John Calipari and Kentucky's humiliating loss to 14-seed Oakland in a game that gave rise to the latest star of March Madness: Jack Gohlke.\nNEWS: Oakland's Jack Gohlke dropped 32 points on 10 3-pointers en route to beating No. 3 seed Kentucky last night.\n— On3 NIL (@On3NIL) March 22, 2024\nHe's now released limited edition merchandise with The NIL Store. He will receive a share of the profit from sales.\nvia @PeteNakos_: https://t.co/pfob9WMNuf pic.twitter.com/5c1Mz95bWc\nThe result served as the latest letdown for the Wildcat basketball program across the last four postseasons. Following a 9-16 record in the 2020-21 campaign that saw Calipari's crew miss the NCAA Tournament altogether, UK suffered a devastating overtime loss to 15-seed St. Peter's the following season before bowing out to Kansas State in the second round of March Madness a year ago.\nAfter getting pantsed by Gohlke and Doug Ebert in two of the last three tournaments, some Kentucky fans are beginning to wonder if Calipari is still the right guy for the job.\nThe way this guy talks is all part of a character (\"awfulcoaching\" on TikTok / Youtube), but his breakdown of Kentucky's defensive woes is a must-watch. Most of what he talks about is 100% correct.\n— WT - Adou Enthusiast (@WildcatsTongue) March 22, 2024\nCoaching malpractice for a team to be this fundamentally unsound on March 21st. pic.twitter.com/BjRGz8mnfQ\nMeanwhile, national media members have seized at the chance to dump gasoline narratives on the flames of discontent in Lexington.\nBernie madoff said trust me. Ill take your life work and invest it to make you rich beyond your wildest dreams. All the while HE was turning that into his own get rich schemefolksthis is John calipari at Kentucky https://t.co/vlm76Veuw7\n— Joey (@JoeyMulinaro) March 22, 2024\nCalipari's buyout currently sits at $33 million, but will drop to $27 million after next season. Even so, UK's athletic director Mitch Barnhart certainly feels the heat to provide a decision on Coach Cal's future given the latest disaster for the Wildcats.\nHere is where the UK Basketball situation stands right now:\n— Matt Jones (@KySportsRadio) March 23, 2024\nThe decision is all in Barnharts hands. I get the sense that if he decides he wants to move on, the money will be there for reasons @Andy_Staples described in his video yesterday.\nThere is a sense of nervousness with\nKentucky fans in some circles have grown beyond angry and impatient, going as far as to capitalize on the ire surrounding Calipari to fuel their own business promotions.\nThe oldest bar in Lexington, Chevy Chase Inn, is now running a FireCal Shot promotion pic.twitter.com/EWZNAxJMA1\n— Grant Peters (@Real_GP) March 23, 2024\nKadyn Proctor Returns to Alabama After Scoring Some NIL Money From Iowa\nNick Saban's retirement in January triggered an exodus of talent from Tuscaloosa to the delight of Ohio State fans that welcomed Caleb Downs with open arms. Arguably, the second-biggest name to hit the portal from Alabama at the time was Kadyn Proctor. The offensive tackle out of Des Moines, Iowa left the Crimson Tide for the Hawkeyes in January after starting all 14 games for Saban's offensive line last season.\nHowever, in a somewhat stunning turn this past week, Proctor announced he would portal back to Alabama after barely two months and zero snaps played at Iowa.\nKadyn Proctor via his Instagram Story:\n— Hayes Fawcett (@Hayesfawcett3) March 19, 2024\nIm back.\nhttps://t.co/IDciRBZv5J pic.twitter.com/hXbvrWjq6g\nThe waffle of a move-back serves as a highly controversial one for many reasons. Proctor was once a long-time Hawkeye commit in high school before flipping to the Crimson Tide on National Signing Day during the end of his recruiting cycle. Iowa also self-reported a Level III rules violation concerning a Hawkeye staffer reaching out to Proctor during the past season, presumably to provide transparency on his own decision to return home.\nBut chief among these controversies must be the particulars surrounding NIL money Proctor received that he will bring with him back to Alabama. While Iowa's Swarm Collective claims Proctor did not get a dime of any money Hawkeye fans have provided, the group still stated Proctor already received 15% of the annual amount he was set to receive for work related to marketing on behalf of businesses.\nBrad Heinrichs, CEO of the Swarm collective, said on @KXnOMorningRush, Hawkeye fans out there who have given to the Swarm should rest easy. Kadyn Proctor hasnt gotten a dime of their money.\n— Keith Murphy (@MurphyKeith) March 20, 2024\nThe money that theyve given to the Swarm collective the student-athletes have to\nHawkeye fans have had a range of extreme reactions to now being spurned by Proctor a second time, but some may rest easier knowing his greatest athletic accomplishment at Iowa proved to be losing at intramural basketball.\nKadyn Proctors crowning athletic achievement at Iowa was losing to my intramural basketball team 68-63 https://t.co/Q02x2pL8dA pic.twitter.com/WTahE9QZ1W\n— Charlie Pattinson (@vikehawkcharlie) March 19, 2024\nKim Mulkey Threatens to Sue the Washington Post\nOn Friday afternoon during LSU women's basketball's first-round NCAA tournament game against Rice, speculation began swirling that head coach Kim Muley would soon be the subject of a critical article in the Washington Post.\nHearing some buzz about a big Washington Post story in the works on LSU women's hoops coach Kim Mulkey, potentially next week. Wagons being circled, etc.\n— Pat Forde (@ByPatForde) March 22, 2024\nYesterday, in a press conference between the Tigers' tournament appearances, Mulkey took the opportunity to preemptively strike back at any article attacking her character. She claims she has already prepared a legal team to sue the news outlet for defamation if the \"click machine\" publishes any false stories about her.\nKim Mulkey with a lengthy statement regarding a forthcoming article that the @washingtonpost is working on. #LSU pic.twitter.com/TH7qz1hFRi\n— Michael Cauble (@Cauble) March 23, 2024\nMulkey and the LSU Tigers will take on Middle Tennessee St. this afternoon in the school's quest to defend its national championship.\nICYMI\nOhio State Women's Hockey Will Play in a Third Straight National Title Game\nThe No. 1 overall seed Buckeye women's hockey team will face Wisconsin at 4 p.m. ET today on ESPNU in a rematch of last year's NCAA Championship. The Badgers won last year's title game by a 1-0 score, but Ohio State owns a 3-2 record against Wisconsin this season. OSU overcoming Clarkson on Friday set the program record for wins in a single season as the team's 34th victory.\nBuckeye Wrestler Jesse Mendez Wins an NCAA Title at 141 Lbs.\nSophomore Jesse Mendez won a national title for Ohio State wrestling yesterday in a clutch performance that included a takedown with only 10 seconds remaining to secure the championship at 141 pounds. Mendez defeated Penn State's Beau Bartlett after previously splitting the results of their matches earlier this season, which included a win for Mendez at the Big Ten Championship.\nThe Ohio State Pistol Team Earns Its Fourth Consecutive National Championship\nColumbus continues to have the straightest shooters on any campus across the country, as the Buckeye pistol team scored a fourth straight national championship yesterday and the program's ninth of the new millennium.
