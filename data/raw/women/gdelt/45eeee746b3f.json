  "body_text": "The FIFA Women’s Champions Cup took another major step toward its historic conclusion on Monday with the unveiling of the tournament’s new trophy, which will be lifted by the winners of FIFA’s first global women’s club competition.\nAccording to a post obtained from FIFA’s X handle on Monday, the reveal of the trophy took place in London and was shared with pupils from a school near Brentford Stadium, the venue that will host the semi-finals on Wednesday, 28 January.\nFormer England international and Arsenal legend Alex Scott led the unveiling alongside FIFA Chief Football Officer and two-time FIFA Women’s World Cup-winning coach Jill Ellis.\n“It was a pleasure to spend time with the children and witness their excitement as they saw the trophy up close. I can’t wait to see them in the stadium in just a few days,” said Ellis.\nEllis said the event underlined the importance of inspiring young people through football, describing the excitement of the children as they saw the trophy up close as a reminder of the game’s power to connect and motivate future generations.\nScott, who serves as an ambassador for the FIFA Women’s Champions Cup 2026™, hailed the tournament as a landmark moment for women’s club football, noting that it brings together champions from every continent to compete on a global stage. She added that the quality on display is expected to inspire young players and fans alike.\nThe children attending the event received official tournament merchandise, participated in a question-and-answer session with Ellis and Scott, and were allowed to interact with the trophy. They will also attend one of the semi-final matches later this week.\nAction on the pitch begins at Brentford Stadium with two semi-final matches on Wednesday. Concacaf champions Gotham FC of the United States will take on Brazil’s SC Corinthians, winners of the CONMEBOL Libertadores Femenina, before UEFA Women’s Champions League holders Arsenal Women FC face ASFAR of Morocco, the CAF Women’s Champions League winners.\nThe tournament will conclude on Sunday, February 1, at Arsenal Stadium, where both the third-place play-off and the final will be staged, culminating in the crowning of the first women’s intercontinental club champions.\nFIFA said the Women’s Champions Cup is intended to boost the global profile of women’s football, providing greater visibility for elite female players and helping drive the continued growth of the women’s game worldwide.",
