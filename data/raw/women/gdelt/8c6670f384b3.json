There's nothing to stop people putting in a plan for a new coal fire power station to be built except the market and common sense.\"\n窶能nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton has backed an Indigenous senator who claims colonisation had a \"positive impact\", urging Australians to listen to her rather than \"capital city views\".\nCoalition senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price is warning that the voice to parliament would divide the nation, using a National Press Club speech to say the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians was not caused by systemic racism.\nShe also rejected suggestions British colonisation had a negative impact on Indigenous people, resulting in intergenerational trauma.\n\"There is no ongoing negative impacts of colonisation. If we keep telling Aboriginal people they are victims, we are effectively removing their agency and then giving them the expectation that someone else is responsible for their lives.\"\nThe opposition leader praised her courage saying Senator Price's comments represented a broad range of views as she had grown up in Alice Springs.\n窶能nMinister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney has said that Senator Price's comments on the impact of colonisation are a \"betrayal\" to First Nations peoples.\nMinister Burney has said while out campaigning for the 'Yes' vote this morning that the Senator's comments are \"simply wrong\" and offensive to those affected by historic injustices like the Stolen Generation.\nMinister Burney says that a Voice to Parliament will seek to remedy the \"long and far-reaching effects\" of colonial policy for Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders.\n\"Things like life expectancy, things like educational outcomes, overcrowding, incarceration rates, they are the issues that the Voice will be dealing with, and it is so important to recognise the full story of Australia.\"\nAnd you can find comprehensive information about the referendum visiting the SBS Voice Referendum portal at www.sbs.com.au/voicereferendum.\n窶能nVictorians are the country's biggest consumers of the deadly \"super drug\" fentanyl as authorities warn of its potentially disastrous consequences.\nMelbourne has the highest level of heroin, ketamine and fentanyl consumption of any Australian capital city, the latest wastewater data from the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission shows.\nIn regional areas, Victoria tops the national list for heroin consumption and is second for fentanyl and oxycodone use.\nCrime Stoppers Victoria chief executive Stella Smith warned fentanyl and other harmful drugs had the potential to devastate the state.\nShe said just 2mg of fentanyl was enough for a deadly overdose and the drug contributed to the deaths of almost 110,000 people in the US last year.\n窶能nAnd in sport,\nKyra Cooney-Cross's impressive showing at the World Cup has earned the Matildas midfielder a dream move to Arsenal.\nThe English heavyweights announced they had signed the Australian on a two-year deal, with head coach Jonas Eidevall calling her \"one of the best young players in world football\".\nCooney-Cross, an A-League Women title-winner with Melbourne Victory, was super delighted to move from Swedish club Hammarby.\nThe move took place late yesterday on the final day of the transfer window.\nArsenal have reportedly paid $270,000 to sign the 21-year-old, a hefty sum in the women's game.\nCooney-Cross joins fellow Matildas stars Steph Catley and Caitlin Foord at the Gunners, who finished third in the Women's Super League last season.",
