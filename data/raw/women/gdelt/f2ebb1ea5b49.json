The injury time goal for Estonia came from a corner kick that was taken advantage of by Tamm to score. Control of possession became more balanced in the second half, with Estonia showing more purpose and generating several dangerous chances that could have led to a tie. For their part, Finland opted for a quick transition game from defense to attack, which allowed them to create some additional scoring opportunities.\nIn the end, the score ended 2-1 in favor of Finland.\n90+3' The match ends\n90'\n88' Changes in Estonia\n⬇️: Soomets and Hussar\n85'\n82'\n80'\n78'\n78'\n75' Changes in Finland\n⬇️: Peltota (🩹), Kallman and Antman\n71'\n68' Changes in Estonia\n⬇️: Tamm (🩹) , Poom and Pikk\n66'\n64' Changes in Finland\n⬇️: Lod and Soiri\n62' GOOOOOAL FROM ESTONIA ⚽\n60' Yellow card🟨\n59'\n58'\n57'\n56'\n53'\n53'\n50'\n49'\n48'\nChange in Estonia\n⬇️: Vetkal\nChange in Finland\n⬇️: Kairinen\n45' Second half begins\nAnalysis of the first part\nThe turning point came with the penalty in favor of Finland, which gave them the necessary impetus to get closer to the rival area and finally score the second goal.
