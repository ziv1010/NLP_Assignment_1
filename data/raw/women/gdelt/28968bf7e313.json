  "body_text": "good morning! Here’s your dad joke of the day (this will not be a daily thing!) brought to you by The Dad Joke Generator:\nThe Hoddle of Coffee: Tottenham Hotspur news and links for Monday, June 3\nA look at the month ahead\n“What do you call a pencil without lead?” ... “Pointless!” (Side note — do people use pencils anymore?)\n———\nThe season’s done and dusted for both the men and the women’s squads, which means we’ve got a pretty quiet month on our hands in regards to on-the-pitch action.\nOff the pitch is a different story, because the transfer window opens on June 14.\nWe’ve already got a handful of credible reports on the potential outgoings of Oliver Skipp and Emerson Royal, and a few less-so-credible rumours on the potential incoming of Georgiy Sudakov (who?).\nBut silly season is gonna kick into high gear soon, and I am here for it. I love getting my hopes up and then have reality far exceed em, unlike that one transfer window where they were sufficiently unmet.\nThere’s also this other strange deadline day on June 30, which I haven’t been paying too much attention to. Now I must, because it is June. Most of you know better than I do, but it seems to do with FFP. And this has lots of vultures circling around the Chelsea training room and overflow room.\nI’ve seen Nottingham Forest are also under some pressure to sell by the June 30 deadline to comply with PSR obligations (here’s an explainer from the Athletic on what PSR is).\nSo there you have it. Two dates to keep in mind in June - 14 and 30. Everything else involves international football.\nFitzie’s track of the day: ATFW You, by Charles Mingus\nAnd now for your links:\nAlasdair Gold on 10 Spurs wonderkids who can impress in the coming seasons\nJay Harris ($$) on what could come next for Mikey Moore\nFenerbahce confirm Jose Mourinho as head coach\nSix issues England must address before the 2024 Euros",
