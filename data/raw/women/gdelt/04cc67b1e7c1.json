  "body_text": "Women should soon be able to move into San Diego’s newest shelter, a renovated historical structure downtown that will eventually hold hundreds of people, during what is otherwise an uncertain time for homelessness services.\nOfficials plan to open 50 beds within the next two weeks at the revamped Rachel’s Promise program run by Catholic Charities. An additional 160 spots will hopefully be ready by Thanksgiving.\n“It’s a miracle this has happened,” Vino Pajanor, Catholic Charities’ CEO, said Thursday at a press conference inside the Rachel’s Promise Center for Women and Children.\nMany efforts to aid the region’s growing homeless population are on shakier ground. The federal government has frozen tens of millions of dollars worth of grants until local leaders agree to vague prohibitions against helping undocumented immigrants. A real estate developer is suing to stop the creation of a safe parking lot by the airport where homeless residents could sleep in their vehicles. And earlier in the week, Mayor Todd Gloria proposed pulling funding from a shelter in the Midway district that serves people with mental health diagnoses.\n“The future of the Rosecrans shelter” is “uncertain,” Gloria noted at Thursday’s press event. The mayor’s office has said a county plan to demolish a nearby building — part of an expansion to the San Diego County Psychiatric Hospital — would cut off the shelter’s utilities and bring too much noise and pollution to the area. “It’s a regrettable decision, but it’s one that the county still has time to choose to do the right thing,” Gloria added.\nSome county officials have shot back that the planned construction shouldn’t be a deal breaker and that new utilities could be built to keep the Rosecrans shelter open for several more years.\nNonetheless, Rachel’s Promise appears to be on track. Two rows of bunk beds already line part of the first floor, their mattresses covered in green comforters and pink pillows. Families will get more privacy, and one furnished room offered a sample of what’s to come: stuffed animals (octopus, monkey), picture books (“Off We Go To Mexico”) and a framed picture of flowers that was painted by the young daughter of one of the people in charge of the shelter.\nSingle women will move in first, most of whom should come from the current Rachel’s Promise facility, a 40-bed shelter in a different area of downtown that’s closing to make way for new development.\nLeaders said the local homeless population is increasingly made up of women.\nA program for vulnerable residents is a fitting addition to a century-old building. The front could be mistaken for a courthouse or temple, with rectangular columns holding up a triangular pediment, all of which marked the entrance to what was once called Eagles Hall. The Fraternal Order of Eagles, a charitable organization, began using the space in 1917 and members raised money for cancer research and handicapped young people, according to records kept by the U.S. Department of the Interior. The group was active during the Great Depression and supported early iterations of Little League Baseball and Pop Warner Football.\nWhile the words “Fraternal Order of Eagles” are no longer visible on the facade, the name of San Diego’s chapter (“Aerie No 244”) can still be seen just above the front door.\nA plaque outside marks part of the building as a national historic site.\nFederal records show that in the 1950s the structure was bought by the Rohr Aircraft Corporation, the first of several ownership changes. San Diego officials credited the current owners, Dene Oliver and Jim McMillan, with making the space available as well as donating furniture and equipment to the shelter. (Jim McMillan is not related to the McMillin family opposing the safe parking lot.)\nThe San Diego Housing Commission unanimously approved the project in February. One hundred and nine beds will be for single women while 101 spots are to be set aside for families with children. The first four months of the program should cost about $1.6 million, including some one-time expenses to launch the shelter, according to a press release. The annual price tag will be around $5.3 million.\nStaff writer Phillip Molnar contributed to this report.",
