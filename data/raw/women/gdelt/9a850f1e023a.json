This deal is hailed as a \"landmark moment for sports media rights\" by FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who praised Netflix for its strong commitment to growing women’s football. He further noted that the deal highlights the increasing value of the Women's World Cup globally.\n\"The FIFA Women’s World Cup Brazil 2027 is already taking shape and we can’t wait for the opening match on Thursday, 24 June 2027 – and all matches that lead to the final on Sunday, 25 July 2027,\" Infantino said. He also pointed out that the upcoming tournament will not only have a significant impact in South America but will help propel the women’s game to new heights worldwide. The 2027 tournament is expected to attract record participation and viewership, enhancing the visibility and importance of women’s football globally.\nThis groundbreaking partnership marks the first time that FIFA has struck such a significant media deal with a streaming platform for one of its major tournaments. The FIFA Women's World Cup has traditionally been broadcast on free-to-air public networks, but this deal with Netflix signals a shift in how major sporting events are being distributed to audiences, further emphasizing the growing importance of digital platforms in the sports industry.\nWith Netflix’s extensive global reach and its commitment to expanding its sports programming, this deal is expected to transform the landscape of women’s sports broadcasting, bringing the FIFA Women’s World Cup to a broader, more engaged audience than ever before.\nAlso Read: Netflix fined 4.75 million euro for GDPR violations by Dutch DPA",
