More are expected to follow in the coming days.\nOn Thursday, Huw Merriman, the rail minister, and Jo Churchill, the employment minister, confirmed that they would not seek re-election. They were joined by Sir Michael Ellis, a former frontbencher, James Grundy, who entered Parliament in 2019, and Dame Eleanor Laing, the deputy speaker.\nTwo former Tory MPs, Matt Hancock and Bob Stewart, who had already announced they were standing down at the election, also had the whip returned on Thursday, taking the total to 72.\nOther senior Tory figures who had already confirmed they were leaving Westminster include Theresa May, the former prime minister, and Sajid Javid, the former chancellor and health secretary.\nSome MPs had planned to stagger news of their resignations over the coming months ahead of an anticipated autumn election, but Mr Sunak’s surprise decision to trigger a summer poll forced their hand.\n08:40 PM BST\nThat is all for today\nThank you for following The Telegraph’s live coverage of the general election campaign.

I think the sense of panic that we saw yesterday, the badly prepared speech, might perhaps have prompted it a little bit.”\n07:57 PM BST\nSunak rules out coalition with Reform\nRishi Sunak has ruled out a coalition with Reform UK.\nAsked by LBC on a visit to the Port of Nigg in Scotland if he could rule out a coalition, the Prime Minister said: “Yes, of course I can rule that out.\n“I’m not really focused on personalities elsewhere, I’m focused on delivering for the country and we live in an uncertain time and that’s why the choice for the country, the question for the country should be: who can build on the economic stability that we’ve not brought to ensure a secure future for everyone, and that requires bold action, it requires a clear plan.\n“That’s what I bring to the table. For people who are focused on illegal migration, they will see a choice of a selection between Keir Starmer and me. It’s either one of the two of us who’s going to end up as Prime Minister after this election.”\n07:54 PM BST\nHancock ‘proud to leave Parliament as Tory’\nMatt Hancock has said he is “proud to leave Parliament as a Conservative MP” after having the whip restored.\nThe former health secretary was stripped of the Tory whip in 2022 after appearing on I’m a Celebrity...

People are furious with the main two parties, the lies. They are all the same. They are all variants of socialism: high tax, big state, mass immigration.\n“People don’t want that and that’s why this is an immigration election and that’s why we’re going to surprise everybody. We’re going to get millions of votes.”\n07:44 PM BST\nMore migration in last two years than previous 950 years, Tice claims\nThere has been more migration in the last two years than any point since 1066, Richard Tice has claimed.\nThe Reform UK leader was being questioned by Sky News’s Sophy Ridge about a campaign graphic showing immigration levels remaining constant from 1066 until 1997 and then increasing dramatically.\n“It’s not ridiculous at all,” he said when asked why he used it. “Because you’ve just confirmed it, since the Norman invasion for heaven’s sake.\n“And since then, literally in the last two years we have seen more people settle in the UK than over the last 950 years up until 2000.\n“And it puts it in context for people: the extent of the betrayal by the Tories, the extent of the lies and the deceit.”\n07:34 PM BST\nNo one voted for mass immigration, says Tice\nRichard Tice has said “no one voted for mass immigration”.\nThe Reform UK leader to Sky News: “No one voted for mass immigration and this is the reason why everyone is feeling poorer, worse off.\n“Because we’ve got no economic growth and everybody is feeling worse off.

But he opted to go to the country just a matter of weeks before he was legally obliged to do so. His timing could hardly be blamed for the Conservatives suffering their worst general election result since 1906.\nMr Sunak, in contrast, has called the election six months early.\nRead Sir John Curtice’s full analysis here\n05:31 PM BST\nPolice Scotland submit report on Peter Murrell to prosecutors\nPolice Scotland have submitted a report on former SNP chief executive Peter Murrell to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, Scotland’s public prosecution service.\nMr Murrell, husband of Nicola Sturgeon, was charged in connection with the embezzlement of funds from the party in April.\nThe development comes on the day John Swinney, the SNP leader, launched his election campaign.\nA Police Scotland spokesman said: “Police Scotland has today (Thursday, May 23, 2024) submitted a standard prosecution report to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in relation to a 59-year-old man who was charged on April 18, 2024, in connection with the embezzlement of funds from the Scottish National Party.\n“Investigations continue and we are unable to comment further.”\n05:27 PM BST\nLabour 17 points ahead in snap election poll\nLabour have a 17-point lead over the Conservatives, according a snap general election poll.\nThe More in Common poll, conducted on May 22 and 23, put Labour on 44 points, Conservatives on 27, Reform on 10, the Lib Dems on nine and the Greens on five.\nPollsters have a wide range of leads, with YouGov reporting a 25-point Labour lead earlier today.\nFirst @Moreincommon_ poll conducted entirely since the campaign was launched discussed on @TimesRadio with @JPonpolitics right now.

We’ve seen in the by-elections that we’ve won, and we won four amazing by-elections this parliament – we haven’t done that since the mid 1990s – what people worked out very quickly for themselves is who was the challenger to the Conservatives, and they made their own decisions.\n“I don’t believe it’s terribly democratic for parties to do pacts and deals and stand down.

If you want change you have to vote for it.\n“And if you vote Labour it is a vote to stop the chaos, it is a vote to turn the page and it is a vote to rebuild our country together.”\n09:51 AM BST\nStarmer asks voters for ‘opportunity to change our country’\nSir Keir Starmer said “change is hard” but “we’ve changed the Labour Party”.\n“All we ask now, humbly, is the opportunity to change our country and put it back in the service of working people,” he said.\nThe Labour leader said delivering economic stability would be one of his main priorities.\nHe said that “if you lose control of the economy, it is working people who pay the price”.\n09:48 AM BST\n‘Nothing will change’ if Tories win five more years in power, says Starmer\nSir Keir Starmer claimed “nothing will change” if the Tories win the general election as he said if the Tories lose the election they will leave office with an “absolutely unforgiveable” record.\nSpeaking at a rally in Gillingham, the Labour leader said: “For a government to leave after 14 years our country with living standards worse than when they started is absolutely unforgiveable.\n“And what is their plan, Rishi Sunak’s plan? £46 billion of unfunded tax cuts. They haven’t learned a thing and if they get five more years they will carry on in the same way, nothing will change.\n“So a vote for Labour is a vote to stop the chaos.”\n09:43 AM BST\nStarmer urges voters to ‘end the chaos’ at general election\nSir Keir Starmer said “voters now get to choose” as he launched Labour’s general election campaign.\nSpeaking at a rally in Gillingham, Sir Keir said: “At long last the election has been called.

With the best will in the world I probably won’t be your prime minister in 15 years’ time which is how long it takes to train one of these consultants.\n“Five years will do. But I made that decision because you are right because we haven’t done that before.”\n09:30 AM BST\nLabour will put up your taxes, claims Sunak\nRishi Sunak has claimed that Labour would hike taxes if Sir Keir Starmer wins the next election.\nSpeaking at a campaign event in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, Mr Sunak said: “Crucially, talk about pound in your pocket, your taxes are being cut. Because of what we’ve been able to do, an average person earning £35,000 is getting a £900 tax cut.\n“That’s what you get with the Conservatives, your taxes being cut so your hard work is rewarded, your family has financial security.\n“That is a contrast at this election because, as I said, the Labour Party are going to spend more money, and that is just going to put your taxes up.\n“There’s no other way to pay for it, they can pretend all they want. More spending equals more taxes, and I don’t want to see that happen.”\n09:24 AM BST\nScottish Tories will ‘take the fight to SNP’, says Douglas Ross\nDouglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said the party will “take the fight to the SNP”.\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme: “The Scottish Conservatives will take the fight to the SNP, beat the nationalists in crucial seats up and down Scotland and get the focus back on what people have been telling me on the doorsteps for months that they want their governments to be focused on.\n“It’s about improving our education system, investing in the NHS, it’s about growing our economy, creating good jobs, but they know that in crucial seats it’s going to be a very close fight between the Scottish Conservatives and the SNP.\n“If they back the Scottish Conservatives, their priorities will be at the forefront, if they back the nationalists it will be about independence.”\n09:22 AM BST\nMcFadden questions if Sunak would remain as PM if Tories win election\nLabour’s national campaign co-ordinator Pat McFadden questioned whether Rishi Sunak would remain as prime minister if the Conservatives were to win the election.\nPut to him while speaking to BBC Breakfast that Rishi Sunak’s comments about Sir Keir Starmer on Wednesday were a “very personal attack”, Mr McFadden said: “We think the Tories will throw everything at this election”.\nMr McFadden added: “They’ve had 14 years, all they’re offering is five more years of the same as what we’ve had in the last 14, more chaos.\n“I mean, if the Conservatives were to win, do we even know if Rishi Sunak would remain as prime minister, be subject to one of the bouts of leadership challenges that always takes them over? So we’re not surprised that they will throw personal attacks at Keir Starmer.”\n09:11 AM BST\nFarage says he will not stand as Reform candidate\nNigel Farage has announced he will not be standing at the general election.\nIn a statement posted on Twitter, the honorary president of Reform UK said he will “do my bit to help in the campaign, but it is not the right time for me to go any further than that”.\n— Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) May 23, 2024\n09:10 AM BST\nNo confidence letter rumours are ‘ridiculous’, says former minister\nTobias Ellwood labelled reports that Tory rebels had submitted letters of no confidence in Rishi Sunak to try to oust him before Parliament is dissolved as “ridiculous”.\nThe no confidence letter rumours were put to the former defence minister during an interview on Sky News and he said “how ridiculous is that”, adding: “If there’s one thing that will put the electorate off, it’s an absence of sense of purpose, an absence of drive, an absence of passion, an absence of unity.”\nThe senior Tory MP added: “Let’s go into this fight showing that we’re determined. If we go in there with any form of defeatist attitude, it will be felt by the electorate, and it will impact on whether we narrow in the polls, close in towards a hung parliament, lose well or lose badly, that is up to us, to all those people that are even considering putting in letters, I mean how daft is that.”\n09:06 AM BST\nStarmer ‘assuming he can waltz into No 10’, claims Sunak\nRishi Sunak claimed Sir Keir Starmer was “assuming that he can waltz into Downing Street”.\nThe Prime Minister told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “He doesn’t have the courage to tell the country what he is going to do on all the key issues that you and I have been talking about and he doesn’t have a plan.\n“He is assuming that he can waltz into Downing Street and take the British public for granted.”\n09:01 AM BST\nSNP manifesto is ‘well advanced’, says Swinney\nJohn Swinney, the SNP leader and First Minister of Scotland, said the general election announcement came as a surprise but it was welcome.\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme: “Obviously we expected there to be an election sometime during this year but I think all the signals were it was likely to be in the autumn.\n“But the fact that it’s going to be now, in the next six weeks, is welcome and it gives us the opportunity to take our message to the people of Scotland that Westminster government is giving us austerity, Brexit and the cost-of-living crisis and independence would give us the power to take our own decisions like re-joining the EU, ending austerity and supporting those in need and Scotland will only become independent if people vote SNP.”\nMr Swinney said all of the SNP’s candidates “are in place” and the party’s manifesto “is well advanced”.\n08:53 AM BST\nNo Rwanda flights before election an ‘utter humiliation’ for Sunak, say Lib Dems\nThe Liberal Democrats said Rishi Sunak conceding that Rwanda flights will not take off before the general election represented an “utter humiliation” for the Tory leader.\nAlistair Carmichael, the party’s home affairs spokesman, said: “This is an utter humiliation and admission of defeat from a Prime Minister who has thrown millions at his failing vanity project.\n“The Rwanda scheme has been an immoral and expensive disaster from day one. To think that the money already spent on this failing policy could have paid for nearly 7 million GP appointments instead just adds insult to injury.”\n08:51 AM BST\nSunak admits small boat numbers are up in 2024\nRishi Sunak admitted that small boat Channel crossings had increased in 2024.\nAsked if the number of arrivals was going up or coming down, the Prime Minister said there were “different ways to look at it”.\nHe told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the “last 12 months the numbers are down by about a third, the first few months of this year they are up, almost exclusively because of a new set of arrivals from Vietnam”.\nHe said he believed he had made “good progress” on tackling small boat crossings and he had a “clear plan” to make further progress.\n08:40 AM BST\nVoting Green is ‘not a wasted vote’, says party co-leader\nVoting for the Green Party is “not a wasted vote”, its co-leader Carla Denyer said this morning.\nMs Denyer said the Greens are aiming to stand in every seat across England and Wales for the first time.\nAsked on BBC Breakfast how she would counter the refrain from some politicians and some voters that supporting the Greens at a general election is a wasted vote, she said: “I would simply say it’s not a wasted vote if you vote for the party whose policies you agree with, that is how democracy works.”\nShe added the Green Party is “aiming to stand a full slate across England and Wales” and has already selected about 95 per cent of its candidates, but will be focusing its efforts on a “handful” of seats.\n08:36 AM BST\nSunak on announcing election in pouring rain: ‘It was a bit wet’\nRishi Sunak said it was “a bit wet” when he announced the general election in Downing Street yesterday but he insisted he did not regret delivering the statement outside No 10 in the pouring rain.\nThe Prime Minister told LBC: “I’m not going to deny that it was a bit wet. I’m not a fair-weather politician.\n“I believe very strongly in the traditions of our country. And when you’re making a statement of that magnitude as Prime Minister, I believe in just doing it in the traditional way, come rain and shine, in front of the steps of Downing Street.”\n08:34 AM BST\nElection decision causes uncertainty on passage of key pieces of legislation\nThe Prime Minister could not guarantee that infected blood victims would get compensation authorised or that Martyn’s Law and the Renters Reform Bill would be passed before Parliament is prorogued ahead of the general election.\nOn infected blood payments, Rishi Sunak told LBC radio: “It’s because it requires a conversation with parties across Parliament, that’s why. But I will do absolutely everything in my power to make sure that we do get that through.”\nIt was put to him that on Wednesday, just a few hours before he called the election, he told the mother of a Manchester Arena bombing victim that Martyn’s Law in her son’s name would be introduced before the summer recess.\nMr Sunak said: “Again, these are all conversations that need to be had with other parties across Parliament.\n“When Parliament dissolves, there are procedures in place to govern what can and cannot be passed…\n“You have a couple more days to get the last bits of legislation through. I can’t force those through on my own.”\n“It’s the same answer on all of these questions,” he said when challenged over whether the Renters Reform Bill would be completed by the end of the so-called wash-up period.\n08:21 AM BST\nFarage expected to attend Reform campaign launch amid announcement rumours\nNigel Farage is expected to attend Reform UK’s general election campaign launch amid speculation over whether he could announce a return to the political frontline.\nThe party’s honorary president said last night after Rishi Sunak announced the contest on July 4: “As for what I do, I’ll think about it overnight.”\nRichard Tice, the Reform leader, is due to hold a press conference at 11am to set out his election plans.\nThere has been speculation that Mr Farage could stand as a Reform candidate. Such a move would represent a significant headache for the Tories as Reform attempts to win over disillusioned Conservative voters.\nMr Farage told GB News last night that there was “no commitment either way from me at the moment”.\n'I will think about it overnight.'\nNigel Farage 'makes no commitment either way' on whether he will stand at the general election on the 4th of July. pic.twitter.com/0R24SZtZyD— GB News (@GBNEWS) May 22, 2024\n08:18 AM BST\nVoters will ‘get to know Starmer much better’ in coming weeks, says McFadden\nVoters will “get to know Keir Starmer much better” in the run up to the election, Labour’s national campaign coordinator has said.\nPat McFadden said the public will see a Labour leader “driven by a patriotic idea of public service”.\nHe told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “What people will see in the next six weeks is someone who is driven by a patriotic idea of public service. He’s got his sleeves rolled up, he’s published the first steps that he wants to enact in that event last week, and he’s ready to serve the British people.”\nHe added: “I think of course in a short campaign in the next six weeks where people are looking at politics more than they normally do, they will get to know Keir Starmer much better.”\n08:16 AM BST\nSunak concedes no Rwanda flights before election\nFlights carrying migrants to Rwanda will take off “after the election”, Rishi Sunak has conceded.\nThe Prime Minister told LBC: “If I’m elected, we will get the flights off.”\nPressed further on timing, he said: “No, after the election. The preparation work has already gone on.”\n08:02 AM BST\nLabour in ‘good shape’ in Scotland, insists Pat McFadden\nThe Labour Party is in “good shape” in Scotland, Pat McFadden said this morning.\nLabour’s national campaign co-ordinator said Scotland could play a key role in determining the outcome of the general election on July 4.\nHe told BBC Good Morning Scotland: “We are in good shape in Scotland. We assume nothing, but the really critical thing is that power of the vote in Scotland to send much more than a message, to actually be part of sending a Labour government to Westminster.”\nAsked whether the party would do any deals if there is a hung parliament, Mr McFadden said: “We are not doing any deals, the aim is for a majority, we know that that’s ambitious but we want to bring stability to the country and I believe that voters in Scotland have got a critical role to play in this.”\nAsked whether all the party’s candidates for Scottish seats were in place, he said: “We might have a few to select but if there’s anything like that to do we’ll do it in the next few days”.\n07:59 AM BST\nPictured: Sir Keir Starmer leaves his London home on first day of election campaign\n07:53 AM BST\nLabour election chief urges voters to ‘ignore the polls’\nPat McFadden, Labour’s national campaign co-ordinator, said people should “ignore the polls” and “assume nothing about the outcome” of the general election.\nPut to him on ITV’s Good Morning Britain that Labour is well ahead in the polls, which would make it Labour’s election to lose, the senior MP said: “Look, I would encourage people to ignore the polls because we start this election with not a single vote being cast, not a seat being won, or lost, and we assume nothing about the outcome.\n“And the basic choice will be, we can carry on with five more years of what we’ve already had for the past 14, or we can vote for change.”\n07:52 AM BST\nScottish Greens will stand at least 31 candidates at general election\nLorna Slater, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, said the party will stand at least 31 candidates, more than ever before in Scotland.\nShe told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme: “Having Scottish Greens in the room at every hustings, at every media event, means that the climate and nature emergencies get a look-in because without us there they tend to get forgotten altogether.”\nAsked whether there is a concern that Scottish Greens standing in a greater number of seats might split the independence vote, she said that is “kind of neither here nor there”.\nAsked whether any deals could be done in areas where it is very tight between the SNP and the Scottish Conservatives, for example, and whether the Scottish Greens might step out of the way, she said: “There has been no discussions of deals, there are no deals of that kind, we’ve already chosen our candidates.”\n07:51 AM BST\nSunak appears to admit Rwanda flights will not take off before election\nRishi Sunak has appeared to admit that the first Rwanda flights will not take off before the general election on July 4.\nHe said the first Rwanda flights “will go in July” if the Tories win the election and “we have already put the preparations in place for that”.\nHe told BBC Breakfast: “If I’m re-elected as Prime Minister on July 5, these flights will go, we will get our Rwanda scheme up and running.”\nThe Prime Minister said that if Sir Keir Starmer wins the election “we won’t have that programme, we won’t have that scheme, we won’t have a deterrent”.\nHe claimed that under Labour there would be “no change” on the small boats crisis.\n07:42 AM BST\nPM denies he called election to get ahead of bad economic and migrant data\nRishi Sunak denied that he had called the general election on July 4 to get ahead of potentially damaging economic and migration numbers.\nIt was suggested to the Prime Minister during an interview on BBC Breakfast that the “real reason” he had opted to go to the country earlier than many people anticipated was because inflation could rise later in the year and migration numbers could also get worse.\nHe replied: “No, no, that is not the real reason. When it comes to the economy, of course I know there is more work to do.”\nOn migration, Mr Sunak said that he had a “clear plan” to tackle small boats Channel crossings.\n07:34 AM BST\nSunak guarantees Rwanda flights will take off if he wins election\nRishi Sunak said the “penny is dropping” across Europe that his Rwanda plan is the right approach to tackling illegal migration as he guaranteed deportation flights will take off if he wins the general election.\nHe said the Rwanda plan “is going to work” and it showed that he was “prepared to do bold things for our country”.\nHe told GB News: “If you elect me, if I am Prime Minister on July 5, those flights will go off to Rwanda and we will begin to put in place the deterrent that we need to stop the boats because there is no way to stop this problem unless you can have a deterrent.”\n07:29 AM BST\nStarmer would make UK ‘soft touch of Europe’ on illegal migration, claims Sunak\nSir Keir Starmer would make the UK the “soft touch of Europe” on illegal migration and would do “absolutely nothing” to stop small boat Channel crossings, Rishi Sunak claimed this morning.\nThe Prime Minister said much of Europe was now backing his Rwanda migrant deportation plan and the “only person that doesn’t is Keir Starmer”.\nSpeaking to GB News, Mr Sunak said: “Everyone else is starting to agree with my approach which is bold. The one person that doesn’t is Keir Starmer.\n“That is a choice at this election. He thinks that we should just offer an amnesty to illegal migrants, to make us a soft touch of Europe, it would make us a magnet for thousands of migrants coming from everywhere.”\nHe added: “It is pretty clear that on this issue, not only does he not share the country’s values that it is a problem, he is going to do absolutely nothing about it.”\nSir Keir has said he would scrap the Rwanda plan. One of his six main election pledges is to set up a new Border Security Command with hundreds of new specialist investigators to tackle smuggling gangs.\n07:22 AM BST\nTime to ‘talk properly about the future’, says Sunak\nIt was suggested to Rishi Sunak that his decision to call the general election at a time when the Tories are 20 points behind Labour in the polls was something akin to the “Charge of the Light Brigade”.\nThe Tory leader said that “it is clear that the economy has turned a corner”, with inflation now “back to normal” and the economy is growing again.\nHe said it was now time to “talk properly about the future”.\nHe told GB News: “I am clear that it is only me, it is only the Conservative Party that has a record of bold action, that has got a clear plan and that is how we are going to deliver a secure future for the country.”\n07:18 AM BST\nSunak says he chose July 4 because ‘economic stability has been restored’\nRishi Sunak is starting his day by answering questions on GB News.\nAsked why he had chosen to hold the election on July 4, the Prime Minister said that “economic stability is now returning to the country” and it was “clear that we have turned a corner”.\nSpeaking in Derby, he said: “So now is the moment to look to the future and the world is clearly in a more uncertain place than it has been in decades and the question for the country is, the choice at this election is, who has got the boldest ideas, the clearest plan to provide a secure future for you and your family.\n“That is the choice at this election, now that the economic stability has been restored we can turn to that question and that is the conversation I look forward to having.”\n07:14 AM BST\nLib Dem manifesto not ready yet\nThe Liberal Democrats’ manifesto is “very advanced” but not yet ready, the party’s deputy leader has said.\nDaisy Cooper told LBC: “Our ideas are fairly advanced but, as you won’t be surprised to hear, given the announcement yesterday was a bit of a surprise, there’s a little bit of work to do to cross the Ts and dot the Is.”\nShe also said her party would be “focusing our resources” on areas “where we’re in the best position” to beat Tory MPs.\n“There are 80 seats around the country where Liberal Democrats are in second place to the Conservatives, and it’s in those areas where in order to beat the Conservative MP, people need to vote for the Liberal Democrats,” she said.\n07:11 AM BST\nLib Dems categorically rule out election pact with any other party\nThe Liberal Democrats have categorically ruled out making any general election deals with any of the other political parties.\nDaisy Cooper, the party’s deputy leader, said there would “absolutely not” be any pacts during the campaign which begins in earnest today.\nHowever, she swerved questions about whether the Lib Dems would be open to forming a government with Labour afterwards.\nMs Cooper told LBC: “There have never been any pacts and there won’t be any pacts because we don’t need any pacts.”\nOn whether the Lib Dems would hold government-forming talks with Labour if it comes short of a majority, she said: “I’m not going to think about anything that happens after 10pm on polling day.\n“We are completely focused on winning as many votes as possible and beating Conservative MPs right now.”\n07:10 AM BST\nSunak and Starmer to kick off general election campaigns\nThe leaders of the UK’s political parties will kick off their general election campaigns in earnest today after Rishi Sunak triggered the national contest on July 4.\nMr Sunak will do a mini broadcast round before embarking on a two-day whistlestop tour of all four UK nations.\nSir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, will head to the south east England in a sign he wants to make inroads in Tory areas.\nRichard Tice, the Reform UK leader, will hold a press conference in London setting out his party’s plans while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey is expected to visit one of his party’s target seats.",
