  "body_text": "Arsenal Football Club is in the early stages of considering expansion to its 60,000 seater Emirates Stadium in North London.\nThe Premier League football club’s co-chair Josh Kroenke told ESPN in an interview that “it would be premature to talk about any plans in depth, but the internal conversations are starting to occur about [the stadium]. It is not an easy renovation, but we see the possibilities of what’s there”.\nThe team moved into the stadium just off the Holloway Road in after its completion in 2006, upgrading from the historic 38,000 capacity Highbury Stadium. At the time, 60,000 seats made it one of the largest stadia in the country, but in the nearly two decades since Manchester United’s Old Trafford has expanded to 74,000 seats, local rival Tottenham Hotspur has constructed a brand new 62,850 capacity stadium, West Ham has moved into the 62,500 London stadium and Liverpool have expanded Anfield to 61,015.\nManchester City is currently upgrading its Etihad Stadium from 54,000 seats to 62,000 seats in a £300M job being undertaken by Sisk. Overseas, Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid have undertaken costly stadium expansions to increase capacities to 105,000 and 84,000 respectively. Manchester United is also now exploring the possibilities of constructing an entirely new 100,000 capacity stadium that could cost over £2bn.\nArsenal ownership group Kroenke Sports & Entertainment also owns the Los Angeles Rams NFL team and has recently completed the delivery of the 70,240 seat SoFi Stadium in the Californian city. This state-of-the-art stadium, designed by architects HKS and engineered by Waler P Moore, features a playing surface 30m below ground level, minimising the height of the tiers above street level. It hosted the 2022 Superbowl and will host football matches at both the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Olympics.\nEmirates Stadium was designed by Populous, with Buro Happold as structural engineer and Arcadis as consultant. It was constructed by Sir Robert McAlpine.\nIts structure is of a four-tiered bowl with polycarbonate roofing that is supported by four triangular welded tube steel trusses. The roof is held up by the stadium’s concrete cores which are connected by steel tripods.\nAs the roof is not significantly attached to the main bowl structure it is believed that it could be removed and replaced in order to provide space for more rows of seating at the top, either as a continuation of the upper tier or as a new fifth tier.\nPutting additional rows at the bottom of the current tiers has also been suggested as a possibility as there is significant space currently between the front row and the edge of the pitch. This may require the lowering of the playing surface, as seen at SoFi stadium.\nThe roof structure has already started to show its age, with fans getting soaked by sluices of water pouring off of it during heavy rainfall.\nAny increase in capacity to Emirates Stadium will likely require Arsenal to foot the bill for increasing capacity for local transport links. Constructing the stadium initially saw the club provide funds to improve Highbury & Islington and Finsbury Park stations, but further expansion could see money demanded by Islington Council and Transport for London for increasing capacities at Holloway Road underground station and Drayton Park railway station, which are currently shut on match days.\nThere is no doubt about the demand for tickets to see Arsenal. Recent increase in performance for the club on the pitch has seen the already extensive waiting list for a season ticket grow even longer, with some estimates believing there are close to 100,000 in line – an expected wait of 25 years.\nMeanwhile, Arsenal Women have in the last couple of years sold out the 60,000 capacity stadium on multiple occasions, with the club boasting most of the global largest attendances for the women’s game. As a result, Arsenal Women will be playing the majority of their home matches in the Emirates Stadium in the forthcoming season as the popularity of the sport continues to grow.\nLike what you've read?
