  "body_text": "The Women’s Super League season will open with Arsenal versus Manchester City, as both teams look to finally end Chelsea’s grip on the title. Now Emma Hayes has left Chelsea to coach the U.S. Women’s National Team, there is a sense that this is the best opportunity yet to dethrone the most successful team of the WSL era.\nAdvertisement\nArsenal and City made strong starts to the transfer window, indicating a desire to be well-prepared by the time of the season opener on September 22: Arsenal have signed Mariona Caldentey from Barcelona, while City moved quickly to secure Vivianne Miedema from Arsenal.\nFor Jonas Eidevall and Gareth Taylor, head coaches of Arsenal and Manchester City respectively, there is a question mark over how long they can justify being in their jobs without winning the league. Taylor can at least point to his second-place finish last season, missing out on the title on goal difference, but for Eidevall, two successive third-place finishes where his team have been well adrift of the title race means the pressure is on.\nGO DEEPER\nWSL 2024-25 fixtures: Arsenal host Man City on opening weekend\nThe mutual decision by club and player to not renew Miedema’s contract took some by surprise, but it has long been clear that the all-time WSL top goalscorer was not suited to the way Eidevall wanted to play. Speaking to Sam Mewis on The Women’s Game podcast, Miedema said: “From both sides, we realised that this isn’t the fit it was two years ago.”\nShe has always emphasised stylistic fit as a key factor in deciding where to play club football and Manchester City’s slower, more intricate style should gel better than Arsenal’s high-pressing, direct approach.\nMiedema’s shift to playing as a No 10 rather than as a striker looks set to continue at City given WSL Golden Boot winner Bunny Shaw is also at the club. It has been tricky to judge how well-suited she is to the role, with her minutes limited over the past two seasons having suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The way Shaw likes to drop into midfield certainly opens up space for City’s attacking midfielders, with Jill Roord flourishing in that exact role to score eight goals in the first half of last season.\nAdvertisement\nRoord is currently rehabilitating from her own ACL injury, but City will have to find a balance to their midfield when she returns. Roord and Miedema know each other well given they play together for the Netherlands on top of their spell at Arsenal, but to play them together in midfield would create a very top-heavy side. Taylor has tended to rely on a fairly set starting XI, but Miedema’s versatility to play as a striker or attacking midfielder will make City far less predictable, as well as offering additional depth.\nFor Arsenal, their Miedema replacement has similar positional question marks. Twenty-eight-year-old Caldentey predominantly played as a left-winger or striker in her decade at Barcelona, but it is possible Eidevall may use her as a No 10 given that is the position Miedema has vacated.\nIt is a role she is capable of playing having been used by manager Jonatan Giraldez as his ‘fourth midfielder’. Speaking ahead of the Champions League final, Giraldez said: “This season, we’ve prioritised the fourth midfielder as a central striker. Last season, the fourth midfielder was usually a winger.” In both cases, Caldentey fulfilled the role, either dropping when she was playing as the striker or inverting from the left.\nRegardless of where exactly she plays, the hope will be that Caldentey’s well-rounded skill set helps Arsenal unpick the low defensive blocks they struggled so much against last season. However, her success as part of Barcelona’s team was as much about her relationships with the players around her, developed over a number of years, as it was her own individual capabilities. How she will adapt to a new system with unfamiliar players is an open question, particularly given the Spanish national team is also full of Barcelona players.\nIt will be interesting to see whether the evolution of Arsenal and City’s attacks through these signings means they can genuinely overhaul Chelsea. Arsenal’s struggles in front of goal were well documented last year, but they actually finished with a higher expected goals figure than City (53 to 46.8). If Caldentey can help with some of their obvious tactical issues, it should prompt a much higher-scoring season. For City, meanwhile, Miedema’s firepower can ensure they do not have to rely on Bunny Shaw overperforming her own xG for another season. Shaw’s overperformance of 10 goals was the highest in the league.\nAdvertisement\nThe match at the Emirates will be an early glimpse at how successful this might be. Three points for either team would be a psychological boost, not to mention that City surely have revenge on their mind after Arsenal landed a knockout blow on their title hopes in the penultimate match of last season. On the other hand, Chelsea now know that one or both of their main rivals will have to drop points from the get-go.\nGO DEEPER\nThe inside story of Manchester City's WSL season\n(Top photo: Getty Images)",
