  "body_text": "PRINCETON – Capping off an unprecedented year of accomplishment, Rowan University Athletics was named the winner of the 2022-23 New Jersey Athletic Conference (NJAC) Cup, which recognizes overall success during the year of league competition. It is the Profs’ fifth Cup in the six years that it has been awarded, and the third consecutive. The award was announced at the NJAC’s annual Awards Brunch at the Hyatt Regency, which also honored all of the major award winners from the year (see list below).\nThe Profs earned points by garnering the regular-season titles in field hockey, volleyball, men’s basketball, baseball and softball, as well as winning the NJAC Championship meets in men’s cross country, men’s indoor track & field and men’s outdoor track & field.\nAlthough conference tournament titles do not factor into the scoring, Rowan still made NJAC history as it captured 10 championships, the most by any school in one year of competition. The total included five won in the Fall, which was the most for any Division III school in the nation during that season.\nThe Profs were NJAC champions in men’s cross country, field hockey, volleyball, women’s soccer, and men’s soccer, men’s basketball, women’s basketball, men’s indoor track & field and men’s outdoor track & field.\nRowan earned extra points with second-place regular-season finishes by women’s soccer, men’s swimming, women’s swimming and women’s lacrosse, while football garnered points as the top-finishing full-member team.\nRowan Athletics also captured the NJAC Cup in 2021-22, 2018-19, 2016-17 and the inaugural one in 2015-16. The Cup was not presented in 2019-20 or 2020-21 as they were incomplete seasons due to the pandemic.\nIn the year-long competition, each full-member institution is scored based on its finish in the final regular season standings or in the championship meet (for cross country, indoor track & field, and outdoor track & field) in each of the 21 sports that are sponsored by the conference. NJAC conference tournament results, NCAA postseason results, and ECAC postseason results are not factored into the scoring. The number of points awarded in each sport is determined by the number of conference participants in that sport. The total number of points earned by each school is divided by the total number of points possible based on a school’s sport sponsorship pattern to determine a percentage. The institution with the highest percentage at the end of the academic year is awarded the NJAC Cup.\nRowan’s Major NJAC Award Winners\nKristiina Castagnola, Field Hockey – Female Athlete of the Year; Justin Kelly, Men’s Cross Country – Runner of the Year; Shane Vostenak, Men’s Cross Country – Rookie of the Year; Dustin Dimit, Men’s Cross Country – Coach of the Year; Kristiina Castagola, Field Hockey –Midfielder of the Year; Tess Herman, Field Hockey – Rookie of the Year; Michelle Andre, Field Hockey – Coach of the Year; Emma DeMaise, Women’s Soccer – Defensive Player of the Year; Calista Burke, Women’s Soccer – Goalkeeper of the Year; Natalie Ogden, Volleyball – Player of the Year; Deana Jespersen, Volleyball – Joy Solomen Coach of the Year; Chad Yates, Men’s Soccer – Pat Baldiserra Midfielder of the Year; Demetrius Poles, Women’s Basketball – Coach of the Year; Ja’Zere Noel, Men’s Basketball – Pony Wilson Player of the Year; Ella Pennington, Women’s Swimming – Rookie of the Year; Amara Conte, Men’s Indoor Track & Field – Outstanding Track Athlete; Kwaku Nkrumah, Men’s Indoor Track & Field – Co-Rookie of the Year; Dustin Dimit, Men’s Indoor Track & Field – Coach of the Year; Jasmine Broadway, Women’s Indoor Track & Field – Outstanding Track Athlete; Rylee Lutz, Softball – Pitcher of the Year; Kim Wilson, Softball – Dr. June Walker Coach of the Year; Molly Green, Lacrosse – Midfielder of the Year; Mike Dickson, Baseball – Coach of the Year; Marquise Young, Men’s Outdoor Track & Field – Outstanding Track Athlete; Kwaku Nkrumah, Men’s Outdoor Track & Field – Rookie of the Year and Dustin Dimit, Men’s Outdoor Track & Field – Bill Fritz Coach of the Year.",
