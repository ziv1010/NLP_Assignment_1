Sometimes, she even gives us gloves personally … just to encourage us. She’s also a person who carries everybody along,” Nnadozie concluded.\nNnadozie, who has been Africa’s Best Goalkeeper for the past two years, was also named Goalkeeper of the Tournament for this summer’s Women Africa Cup of Nations finals in Morocco, where she played a key role in Nigeria’s 10th triumph.\nHer profile was massively boosted after the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.\nIn that tournament, Nnadozie produced one of the most memorable performances in Nigeria’s famous 3–2 victory over hosts Australia.\nFinishing fourth in the Yashin Trophy is a huge moment for Nnadozie and for African women’s football.\nAt just 24 and with goalkeeper known for their longevity, it would come as no surprise if in the nearest future Nnadozie is primed for the the Yashin Trophy.",
