To mark the event, a picture of the two men shaking hands was shared on the official Prince and Princess of Wales social media accounts along with a short message. But the post on X had to be quickly deleted and reposted to fix a major error.\nIn the first post on X, the message read: \"Great to meet new @england manager Thomas Tuchel for the first time today, and hear about plans for the team.\" However, when it was reposted, it instead said: \"Great to meet new @england men's manager Thomas Tuchel for the first time today, and hear about plans for the team.\"\nOf course, England also has a manager of the women's team the Lionesses - Sarina Wiegman - who William has also met several times in the past.\nIt is believed William's meeting with the new men's manager lasted over an hour, with Tuchel sharing his views on the team and his hopes for the future with the prince. A royal source said they also discussed the ongoing success of Aston Villa, William's favourite team, in their Champions League campaign.\nWilliam previously backed Tuchel as the Three Lions’ new boss after his appointment telling him: \"We’re all behind you!\" In a personal message posted by Kensington Palace’s social media, the prince wrote: “Exciting times for @England, with a generation of talented players and a new manager taking the reins. \"Thomas, wishing you the best of luck, we’re all behind you! W.\"\nTuchel, who is German, has been tasked with leading England to World Cup glory in the 2026 tournament. The Three Lions will face Albania, Latvia, Andorra and Serbia in the qualifiers. However, he is expecting a tough qualification campaign, with Albania first up at Wembley on March 21. Tuchel has insisted that reaching the World Cup will not be easy despite the lack of another top-level side in their group.\nTuchel's visit to Windsor Castle comes after the Prince of Wales sent a highly personal message to his predecessor Sir Gareth Southgate, who quit as England manager last July - just days after his side lost the Euro 2024 final to Spain.\nTaking to social media minutes after the news was announced, William said: \"Gareth, I want to thank you - not as the President of the @FA, but as an @England fan. Thank you for creating a team that stands shoulder to shoulder with the world 's finest in 2024.\"Thank you for showing humility, compassion, and true leadership under the most intense pressure and scrutiny.\n\"And thank you for being an all-round class act. You should be incredibly proud of what you’ve achieved. W.\" The Prince of Wales also shared a sweet photo of himself sharing a joke with Southgate during a previous visit to the England training ground.",
