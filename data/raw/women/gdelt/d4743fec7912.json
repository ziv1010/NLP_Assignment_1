It’s heartwarming to have seen the empathy towards their plight from so many of you.”\nBBC confirmed the star presenter will return to the coroporation and internal independent review into its social media guidelines will be launched.\nIt comes as BBC chairman Richard Sharp is facing growing calls to resign over the row which has sparked an unprecedented crisis at the corporation.\nKey Points\nGary Lineker set to return to BBC after tweets row\nBBC announces review into social media guidelines\nGary Lineker tweets about small boats crisis immediately after rejoining BBC\nBBC chairman Richard Sharp faces calls to quit over Gary Lineker meltdown\nDowning Street declines to say whether Rishi Sunak has confidence in Tim Davie\n13:50 , Thomas Kingsley\nA Downing Street spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister has confidence in Tim Davie following the Gary Lineker row, stressing that the choice of BBC director-general was a matter for the corporation.\n“The director-general is appointed by the BBC and it's a matter for them.”\nMore in Sports\n“I'm simply pointing to the fact that he's appointed by the BBC and it's a matter for them,” the spokesman said when pressed by reporters.\nAsked about the prime minister's position on the licence fee, the spokesman said: “We remain committed to the licence fee for the rest of the current charter. But we've been clear that the BBC's funding model faces major challenges due to changes in the way people consume media.\n“And it's necessary to look at ways to ensure long-term sustainability.”\nRichard Sharp’s position ‘increasingly untenable,’ Keir Starmer says\n13:35 , Thomas Kingsley\nSir Keir Starmer has described BBC chairman Richard Sharp's position as “increasingly untenable” over the Gary Lineker row.\nSpeaking to broadcasters ahead of news that the Match Of The Day presenter will return to the show, the Labour leader said: “I think Richard Sharp's position is increasingly untenable.\n“I think most people watching the complete mess of the last few days would say how on earth is he still in position and Gary Lineker has been taken off air?\n“This is a mess of the BBC's own making, they need to sort it out and sort it out fast.”\nLet’s recap: What did Gary Lineker actually say?\n13:20 , Thomas Kingsley\nOn Tuesday last week, Lineker wrote on Twitter about a video in which home secretary Suella Braverman unveiled plans to stop migrants crossing the Channel on small boats and said the UK is being “overwhelmed”.\nMs Braverman, who was previously chastised for comparing migrant crossings to an “invasion”, has been heavily criticised for her use of language around the matter.\n“Good heavens, this is beyond awful,” Lineker wrote in response to the video.\nThere is no huge influx. We take far fewer refugees than other major European countries. This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s, and I’m out of order?\n— Gary Lineker 💙💛 (@GaryLineker) March 7, 2023\nReplying to the sports broadcaster, another Twitter user described his comment as “out of order”, adding that it was “easy to pontificate when it doesn’t affect you”.\nLineker responded: “There is no huge influx. We take far fewer refugees than other major European countries.\n“This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s, and I’m out of order?”\nWhat are the BBC’s guidelines on impartiality and do they apply to Gary Lineker?\n13:05 , Thomas Kingsley\nThe BBC says it is “committed” to achieving due impartiality in all its output, describing it as “fundamental to our reputation, our values and the trust of audiences”.\nThe corporation’s guidelines state that impartiality must be “adequate and appropriate to the output, taking account of the subject and nature of the content, the likely audience expectation and any signposting that may influence that expectation”.\nIt adds that BBC output must always “scrutinise arguments, question consensus and hold power to account” with both consistency and due impartiality.\nRead the full story here\nHow much is Gary Lineker paid?\n12:50 , Thomas Kingsley\nIn 2022, Lineker topped the BBC’s highest earners list for the fifth year in a row, taking home £1.35m.\nThe year before, he was paid £1.36m, having taken a pay cut in 2020 from his previous £1.75m salary. Lineker has presented Match of the Day since 1999, making him the show’s longest running presenter.\nThe BBC’s second highest paid broadcaster last year was Zoe Ball at £980,000. Steve Wright – whose Radio 2 show came to an end in September after 24 years – followed at £450,000, the same amount as Lineker’s Match of the Day co-host Alan Shearer.\nRead the full story below:\nHow much is Gary Lineker paid?\n8 times the BBC didn’t punish presenters for sharing political views\n12:36 , Thomas Kingsley\nAfter questions were raised about whether Gary Lineker had broken BBC’s impartiality rules with his social media use, the corporation decided that he would not host Saturday’s edition (11 March) of Match of the Day.\nOn Monday (13 March), it was announced that Lineker would return for the forthcoming episode, after Saturday’s MOTD aired without commentary or analysis.\nThe choice to temporarily remove Lineker from his broadcasting duties has provoked some to look back on previous times when BBC-affiliated public figures expressed a personal view on politics, but did not receive punishment in the same way.\nRead the full story below by my colleague Nicole Vassell:\n8 times the BBC didn’t punish presenters for sharing political views\nDowning Street declined to give its backing to BBC chair Richard Sharp\n12:19 , Thomas Kingsley\nDowning Street declined to give its backing to under-fire BBC chairman Richard Sharp, who once again come under scrutiny amid the Gary Lineker row.\nRishi Sunak earlier declined to back Mr Sharp's character or integrity.\nA Downing Street spokesman said: “The prime minister said that the office for the commissioner for public appointments has announced a review of that competition process to approve the chairman of the BBC to ensure that the process was run in compliance with the rules.\n“We will await the outcome of that review and we will of course provide any assistance with that process but it is for that review to look into that.”\nBBC boss ‘respects the views’ of staff\n12:02 , Thomas Kingsley\nTim Davie has said he “respects the views” of staff at BBC Sport after presenters, pundits and commentators refused to appear on air during the weekend after Gary Lineker was told to step back from Match Of The Day.\nThe director-general of the corporation was asked if he was out of touch after reduced sports programming was shown instead, and he told BBC News: “(Sports presenters) were obviously put in a very difficult situation.\n“I think people across the BBC... are all very passionate about our standing as an impartial broadcaster, so important in this world, and this affair tells you how polarised debate has become.\n“I want to fight for a BBC where we can have proper calm debate (and) facilitate free speech.”\nWhen asked about Conservative Party pressure on the BBC, Mr Davie said it is “not how we work” at the corporation and the impartiality guidelines are “equally applied” to those who express left and right-wing views.\nHe added: “The audience numbers in terms of trust in the BBC... is in good order.”\n11:45 , Thomas Kingsley\nThe BBC Board said in a statement: “The Board welcomes the fact that the executive has reached an agreement following the disruption of the weekend.\n“Impartiality is a cornerstone of the BBC. We believe this is the right time to look at the clarity of the BBC's social media guidance and how it is applied.\n“We will support the executive in its continuing work to ensure the organisation delivers world-class, impartial content for all audiences.”\nGary Lineker refused to answer questions from reports as he left his home\n11:30 , Thomas Kingsley\nGary Lineker refused to answer questions from reporters as he left his home in Barnes, south-west London on Monday morning after his return to the BBC was announced.\nTaking his dog out for a walk, the Match Of The Day host told reporters: “I've already said what I'm going to say on Twitter.\n“If I say anything more now it just encourages people to doorstep me.”\nMr Lineker refused to respond when he was asked: “Do you stand by what you said?”, “Have you won?”, “Is this a victory for common sense?” and “Has Tim Davie apologised to you personally?”\nAs photographers took pictures, he said: “Right that's enough - you've got your pictures.”\nLabour welcomes return of Gary Lineker\n11:15 , Thomas Kingsley\nLabour has welcomed the announcement that Gary Lineker will return to Match Of The Day and called on the Government to examine how it can protect a “truly independent and impartial BBC.”\nShadow culture secretary Lucy Powell said: “This is welcome and we will all be pleased to see Gary Lineker and football coverage back on the BBC this weekend. A review of the BBC's social media guidelines is clearly needed.\n“But much bigger questions remain about the impartiality and independence of the BBC from government pressures.\n“The Tory government have long wanted to undermine the BBC. They appointed a BBC chair now subject to investigation over his personal links to the Conservative Party. The ongoing uncertainties around the future of the BBC are keeping it over a barrel and making it susceptible to political campaigns orchestrated by ministers, MPs and the right-wing press.\n“As well as a review of the BBC's social media guidelines, this saga should prompt the Government to examine how it protects and promotes a truly independent and impartial BBC.”\n11:00 , Thomas Kingsley\nFormer BBC TV and radio presenter Roger Bolton said the BBC's plan for a review into its social media guidance “in itself resolves nothing.”\nFollowing the confirmation Gary Lineker will return to his regular presenting duties on Match Of The Day, Mr Bolton, who hosts Roger Bolton's Beeb Watch podcast, said: “The review is necessary but its independence depends on who conducts it. Will it simply analyse the problem or give recommendations?\n“Is the BBC committed to accept any recommendations? It seems not.\n“The report will be given to the BBC Board to decide what further should be done. It is chaired by someone, Richard Sharp, who is not seen as impartial by many people and who has been missing in action over the last crucial days.\n“And has Gary Lineker agreed not to tweet on controversial issues while the review takes place? This is an important and necessary holding operation but in itself resolves nothing.”\n10:45 , Thomas Kingsley\nBBC director general Tim Davie said there have been “no easy answers” and he did the “right thing” after the corporation asked Gary Lineker to step away from Match Of The Day.\nDavie told BBC News: “I've always said we need to take proportionate action, and for some people...we've taken too severe action, others think we're being too lenient.\n“There's never been an easy solution but asking Gary to step back off air, I think, was a significant thing and now we look forward with this agreement, moving forward to resolve things and get back to business as usual.”\nOn whether he had reached an agreement on social media with Lineker after the presenter was announced to be coming back on air, Davie said the presenter will “abide by the editorial guidelines” until a review has taken place.\nHe added: “I think it was a very big moment in terms of us saying we have to take stock here, we have to take action, we did take action which we thought was proportionate and as the BBC we did the right thing, I did the right thing.”\nLineker will abide by social media guidelines while review is under way\n10:28 , Thomas Kingsley\nTim Davie said Mr Lineker had agreed to abide by the BBC's social media guidelines while a review is under way.\nGiven the consensus that those guidelines contain significant grey areas, it is unclear exactly what this will mean in practice - and, as mentioned a little earlier, it is being reported that he will be allowed to continue tweeting without restrictions.\nIn a statement earlier, the BBC confirmed it would launch an independent review of its guidance.\nSuspension does not compare to plight of refugees, Lineker says\n10:14 , Thomas Kingsley\nWith a final thought on his standing down from Match of the Day, Gary Lineker said his suspension does not compare to the hardship refugees face.\nHe said: “A final thought: however difficult the last few days have been, it simply doesn’t compare to having to flee your home from persecution or war to seek refuge in a land far away. It’s heartwarming to have seen the empathy towards their plight from so many of you.”\nA final thought: however difficult the last few days have been, it simply doesn’t compare to having to flee your home from persecution or war to seek refuge in a land far away.

I support this review and look forward to getting back on air.”\nLineker will be allowed to tweet ‘with no restrictions’ as part of agreement with BBC, according to reports\n09:56 , Thomas Kingsley\nAccording to the i newspaper, the terms of the deal mean Gary Lineker will be allowed to continue tweeting about politics with “no restrictions”.\nIf confirmed, this would represent a major climbdown from BBC leadership, following an outpouring of strong criticism over their actions since last week as well as boycotting from the biggest stars in their sports coverage.\nBREAKING: Gary Lineker set to return to BBC after tweets row\n09:42 , Thomas Kingsley\nGary Lineker is to return to presenting sport on the BBC after he was taken off air over his tweets criticising the government's migration policy, according to reports.\nSky News has reported that the corporation will apologise to the Match Of The Day presenter.\nBBC in a ‘muddle’ over impartiality, former director of news claims\n09:40 , Thomas Kingsley\nJames Harding, co-founder of Tortoise Media and former director of news at the BBC, said the corporation has got into a “muddle” over the issue of impartiality as he warned that the broadcaster cannot police the opinion of every contributor.\nHis comment came amid hopes of a resolution in the row with Gary Lineker.\n“I think it's part of a bigger muddle on impartiality,” he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the situation is “completely different” for staff outside news and current affairs.\n“Why do we care about impartiality? We care about making sure that a publicly funded broadcaster that delivers news and information that informs the country is impartial, but people can make up their own minds on political issues.\n“But you can't get to a world in which the BBC is policing the opinions of every writer, director, musician, sports personality, scientist, business entrepreneur.\n“Not only can you not actually do it, but the principle is wrong.\n“The principle is wrong because it will actually deter people from joining the BBC, it will diminish the BBC.\n“But, even more importantly, there are freedom of speech principles here. Those people have lives beyond the BBC and should be able to give voice to what they say.”\nGary Lineker’s son says his dad ‘shouldn’t need to apologise'\n09:19 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain\nGeorge Lineker posted a message of solidarity for his dad on Twitter on Sunday as he said he is “proud” of his “old man”.\nHe added: “Shouldn’t need to apologise for being a good person and standing by his word.

instead broadcasting only short highlight clips of the day’s matches.\nSunday 12 March 2023 12:49 , Katy Clifton\nGary Lineker said “I can’t say anything” to questions from reporters when he left his home in Barnes, south-west London, to walk his dog on Sunday morning.\nHe was asked “do you still want to work for the BBC?”, “have you spoken to Tim Davie overnight?”, “have you had discussions with BT or Sky?” and “is this the end of your presenting career?”, but provided no response.\nHe was dressed in blue jeans, a blue zipped jumper and walking boots, and left for a nearby park.\nWatch: Rachel Reeves says the BBC pulling Gary Lineker off the air was 'out of proportion'\nSunday 12 March 2023 12:35 , Emily Atkinson\n‘Cruelty without purpose’: Plan to detain children arriving on small boats sparks anger\nSunday 12 March 2023 12:20 , Emily Atkinson\nChildren who arrive in the UK on small boats will be detained in immigration centres under Rishi Sunak’s plan to tackle the crisis, it has emerged – sparking outrage among charities and concern among Tory MPs.\nA coalition of more than 350 charities, businesses and unions have condemned home secretary Suella Braverman’s Illegal Migration Bill, as the Archbishop of York said it “amounts to cruelty without purpose”.\nCampaigners have pointed out that the bill allows the detention of families with children, reversing a ban introduced by the David Cameron-led coalition government a decade ago.\nOur political correspondent Adam Forrest has more:\nPlan to detain children arriving on small boats denounced as ‘sickening’\nWhat we know of BBC disruption so far\nSunday 12 March 2023 12:05 , Emily Atkinson\nFollowing the heavily limited edition of Match of the Day on Saturday, it was announced this morning that both Match of the Day 2 and the coverage of the Women’s Super League match would follow a “much reduced” format today.\nSaturday’s episode of Match of the Day lasted “just 20 minutes” - with no presenter, pundits, commentary or interviews.\nYesterday’s disruption did not stop there, however, as both Football Focus and Final Score were pulled at the eleventh hour.\nBargain Hunt was broadcast in place of Football Focus on BBC One at noon on Saturday, while The Repair Shop was due to run instead of Final Score at 4.30pm.\nBBC Radio 5 Live was also impacted, with host Mark Chapman relinquishing the helm of both 5 Live Sport and Fighting Talk.\nPre-recorded content replaced the live broadcasts, with Kammy & Ben’s Proper Football Podcast aired during Fighting Talk’s slot followed by The Footballer’s Football Podcast which played on Radio 5 Live when 5 Live Sport would have aired.\nWhat did Gary Lineker tweet?\nSunday 12 March 2023 11:50 , Emily Atkinson\nThe BBC was sent into meltdown this weekend after presenters and pundits staged a mutiny in solidarity with Gary Lineker, who has been forced off air over a tweet about the government’s asylum crackdown.\nLineker, who has hosted Match of the Day for almost a quarter of a century, has been embroiled in a row over impartiality after comparing the language used to launch a new asylum policy with 1930s Germany.\nThe comparison saw Lineker suspended from the helm of the popular BBC show – prompting several fellow pundits, including Ian Wright, Alan Shearer, and Alex Scott, to announce they would not be taking part in solidarity with the former England striker.\nMore on this story here:\nTory MP hails ‘best MOTD in years’ after Lineker pulled from BBC show\nSunday 12 March 2023 11:38 , Emily Atkinson\nA Conservative MP hailed the “best Match of the Day episode in years” after Gary Lineker was pulled from the BBC show for criticising the government’s immigration policy.\nLineker was stood down from presenting BBC Sport’s flagship programme after a row with hierarchy over his comments on Twitter in which he compared the language used in the Tories’ new “stop the boats” policy with Germany in the 1930s.\nMatch of the Day went ahead in a reduced 20-minute highlights-only format without a studio presentation or post-match interviews after staff across a raft of the BBC’s sports coverage withdraw in solidarity with Lineker’s right to express his views.\nLawrence Ostlere has more:\nTory MP hails ‘best MOTD in years’ after Lineker pulled from BBC show\nBBC must maintain reputation for independence and impartiality, says Hunt\nSunday 12 March 2023 11:24 , Emily Atkinson\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt has said he feels the main focus on the Gary Lineker row should be for the BBC to maintain its “reputation for independence and impartiality”.\nThe Conservative MP noted he is one of the figures that is scrutinised by the broadcaster on the behalf of the public and so thinks “obviously it isn’t for me to say how the BBC does that, but it’s very important it does”.\nAppearing on BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Hunt said: “I don’t want to say anything other than making sure the BBC maintains its reputation for independence and impartiality is the outcome that matters most.\n“Now, I can disagree with Gary Lineker on small boats, as I do profoundly. But what really matters in all of this is that when you’re interviewing me, people know that you’re doing it on behalf of the public, and not with a political motive … that is the thing that needs to be protected.”\nWatch: BBC News presenter heckled by passerby on live TV shouting ‘bring back Gary Lineker’\nSunday 12 March 2023 10:43 , Emily Atkinson\nBBC star’s comparison to 1930s Germany ‘deeply inappropriate and tasteless’, says Tory MP\nSunday 12 March 2023 10:30 , Emily Atkinson\nConservative MP Simon Clarke said he disagrees “very profoundly” with what Gary Lineker said in the tweet that sparked the row.\nSpeaking on BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Clarke said: “I disagree very profoundly with what Gary Lineker said. I think the comparisons to 1930s as he’s made are deeply inappropriate and actually very tasteless.”\nAsked why it matters what a sports presenter says, the MP replied: “Mr Lineker has a huge reach and the reality is that he is obviously operating on a publicly-funded broadcaster, he is someone whose platform largely derives from his role at the BBC, he’s saying things which are partisan and I think which are also deeply unfair.”\n“Comparisons to the 1930s are deeply inappropriate and tasteless”\nFormer Levelling Up Secretary Simon Clarke says Gary Lineker’s comments on the government’s immigration policy were not appropriate for someone working for a public broadcaster #BBCLauraK https://t.co/1Hu7Ujx23i pic.twitter.com/RGZNEnPLhS— BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) March 12, 2023\nHe called the situation a “mess” and said the BBC needs to resolve “ambiguity” in its guidelines.\nMr Clarke continued: “I don’t like cancel culture of any kind, I don’t like to see people being taken off air.\n“I think there is a slight irony here and a slight hypocrisy because obviously I wonder how many of the same people calling for Gary Lineker to be restored were calling for Jeremy Clarkson a few weeks ago to be removed.”\nBBC chairman Richard Sharp faces calls to quit over Gary Lineker meltdown\nSunday 12 March 2023 10:12 , Emily Atkinson\nBBC chairman Richard Sharp is facing growing calls to resign amid the Gary Lineker impartiality row which has sparked an unprecedented crisis at the corporation.\nRoger Bolton, a former senior executive at the BBC, joined calls from opposition parties and senior media figures for Mr Sharp to quit.\nMr Bolton said the chairman was compromised by the investigation into whether he failed to properly share details of his involvement in facilitating an £800,000 loan for Boris Johnson when he was at No 10.\n“The BBC chairman now needs to resign,” he told GB News. “The very fact that he can’t speak out on the subject and defend the BBC and define impartiality, as the chairman of the BBC, means he can’t do his job. So, I’m afraid he should go.”\nMore on this from our political correspondent Adam Forrest here:\nBBC chairman Richard Sharp faces calls to quit over Gary Lineker meltdown\nBreaking: Match of the Day 2 and Women’s Super League match coverage to be ‘much reduced’\nSunday 12 March 2023 10:10 , Emily Atkinson\nBoth Match of the Day 2 and the coverage of the Women’s Super League match will follow a “much reduced” format today, according to a BBC editor.\nTweeting this morning, BBC Sports Editor Dan Roan, who gives an update on the channel’s schedules, said: “At this stage BBC expecting the planned Women’s Super League match between Chelsea and Manchester United this afternoon to be on BBC2, but with no pre-match presentation.\n“Expecting Match of the Day 2 to follow similar much-reduced format to Match of the Day last night.”\nAt this stage BBC expecting the planned WSL match between Chelsea and Manchester United this afternoon to be on BBC2, but with no pre-match presentation.\nExpecting MOTD2 to follow similar much-reduced format to MOTD last night. https://t.co/6NrwAcRnni— Dan Roan (@danroan) March 12, 2023\nGary Lineker’s tweets a ‘technical breach’ of guidelines, says former BBC director general\nSunday 12 March 2023 09:58 , Emily Atkinson\nMark Thompson, former BBC director general, said he believes Gary Lineker’s tweets constitute a “technical breach” of the impartiality guidelines “on the face of it.”\nHe said the row sparked by the sports presenter’s remarks was a “very unhappy accident” that was now “distracting from the actual issue of the men, women and children in those boats.”\nLabour accuses Tories of ‘putting pressure’ on BBC to take Gary Lineker off air\nSunday 12 March 2023 09:43 , Emily Atkinson\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has criticised Tory MPs for “putting pressure” on the BBC to take Gary Lineker off air.\nShe told Sky’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme: “I wouldn’t have used the language that Gary Lineker used. But do I think he should be taken off TV from doing commentary on the football? No, I don’t. And I think that was out of proportion.”\nShe said Tory MPs had nothing to say when BBC chairman Richard Sharp was found to have helped facilitate a loan for Boris Johnson.\nMs Reeves added: “The people who I think are at fault here are the Conservative MPs and ministers who lined up to criticise Gary Lineker, putting pressure on the BBC to take him off air.\n“That is the priority now of the Conservatives - some culture war, rather than the interests and the concerns of people in their day-to-day lives.

He didn’t broadcast it on the BBC, it was a tweet he did privately.”\nMr Dyke went on to say: “I think what the BBC did yesterday was mistaken. And I’ve over the years since I left the BBC never gone public criticising the leadership of the BBC and the decisions they take, because I know what a difficult job it is, and difficult decisions have to be taken.”\nBut, he said, the precedent at the corporation is that “news and current affairs employees are expected to be impartial and not the rest”.\nLetters to the editor: Gary Lineker should have the right to express his views\nSunday 12 March 2023 06:30 , Shweta Sharma\nRead our letters to the editor on the Gary Lineker controversy.\nLetters: Gary Lineker should have the right to express his views\nGary Lineker ‘will not back down on his word’, eldest son says\nSunday 12 March 2023 05:30 , Shweta Sharma\nGary Lineker‘s son has said he thinks the sports presenter will return to Match Of The Day - but that he would not “back down on his word”, according to reports.\nIn an interview with The Sunday Mirror, the former England player’s eldest son George claimed his father had been “a bit disappointed” by the BBC asking him to step back from hosting Saturday’s Match Of The Day (MOTD) after he compared the language used to launch a new Government asylum seeker policy with 1930s Germany in a tweet.\nHowever, he said Lineker had been “overwhelmed by the support” of fellow pundits who had withdrawn from various BBC sports shows in solidarity with him, particularly his MOTD co-presenters Ian Wright and Alan Shearer.\nGeorge Lineker told The Sunday Mirror: “Dad is a good man, a good human, and I’m proud of him for standing by his word.
