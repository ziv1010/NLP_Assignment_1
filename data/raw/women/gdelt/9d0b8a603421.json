There's a lot of good players coming and it's a pretty new squad.\n\"With the trial games that we've had, which I've seen first hand, I'm really impressed with the way Alicia has got them playing, so I think we'll definitely be competitive.\"\nMORE SPORT:\nChampionship-winning goalkeeper Danielle Bartels and defender Chloe Martin remain part of Azzurri's first-grade squad.\nNew recruits include Sienna Denholm from New Lambton plus experienced NPLW NSW players Rachel Perrins and Erica Di Sciascio.\nAzzurri's new-look side face their first test on Friday night against a stacked Maitland Magpies in the preseason Charity Shield at Jack McLaughlan Oval.\nMaitland, who were beaten 1-0 by Azzurri in last year's grand final, have lost South African international Marry Ntsweng to Adamstown but have added Elodie Dagg (Newcastle Olympic) and Marion Dunbabin (Adamstown) to their roster under new coach Ben Horgan.",
