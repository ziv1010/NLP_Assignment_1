  "body_text": "It’s time for the 2026 Tournament of Roses Parade — a New Year’s Day floral extravaganza like no other.\nFor live coverage, see: A ‘Magic’-al, but wet, day at the 137th parade\n“The Magic in Teamwork” is the theme, and parade fans can expect musical performances — starting with the Opening Spectacular, plus equestrian units, marching bands, dozens of floats (each adorned with tens of thousands of roses, carnations and other flowers plus natural elements) and more. Much more.\nWhat follows is a look at the floats, bands, equestrian units — each and every entry, in the order they’re expected to appear along the 5.5-mile parade route. (Note: The lineup is subject to change, even as late as the morning of the parade.)\n2026 Rose Parade Sound Car\n2026 Rose Parade Pace Car\nOpening Spectacular presented by Honda\nSinger/songwriter Bishop Briggs, backed by two dozen dancers, will perform her platinum-selling anthem “River” and a follow-up hit, “Champion,” as part of the Opening Spectacular.\n1. Honda\nThe Power of Teams\n(Artistic Entertainment Services)\nA Tournament of Roses partner for more than 60 years, and a presenting Rose Parade sponsor for more than a decade, this entry from American Honda is not part of the judging process. That said, when the company’s floats were being considered for awards, they earned 15 trophies between 1995 and 2010.\n- Dimensions: 16 feet (height), 18 feet (width), 55 feet (length)\n- Number of flowers: Not announced\nU.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber\nFlying in from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, the B-2 Spirit is a multirole bomber capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear munitions. When it was developed in the 1980s, and delivered by Northrop Grumman Corp. to the Air Force starting in 1993, it represented a dramatic leap forward in technology. To date, the largest military strike using B-2 bombers took place in June 2025, when the aircraft attacked nuclear sites in Iran.\nHow the bomber travels from Missouri to Pasadena — coordinating with air traffic control along the way — to perfectly time the start of the Rose Parade is an impressive feat. U.S. Air Force Col. Keith J. Butler, who grew up in the neighboring city of Arcadia, was at the center of it when piloted the bomber over the Rose Parade in 2018; he called the experience “a bucket list item” when he later talked to reporter Teresa Liu.\n2. United States Marine Corps Mounted Color Guard\nBarstow, Calif.\nBased at Marine Corps Logistics Base in the Mojave Desert near Barstow, this unit is the last remaining mounted color guard in the Marine Corps. The Marines will be riding palomino mustangs adopted through the Bureau of Land Management’s Adopt a Horse and Burro Program.\n- Marshal: Sgt. Maggie Hardy\n- Breeds: Mustang\n3. United States Marine Corps West Coast Composite Band\nCamp Pendleton, Calif.\nIncorporating elite musicians from three separate Southern California ensembles — the 1st Marine Division Band, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing Band and Marine Band San Diego — the Rose Parade is the only event where you’ll find all of them performing together on the same stage.\n- Band director: Gunnery Sgt. Craig Palmer, drum major\n4. Disney Celebrates America\nThe Walt Disney Company arrives with a vibrant salute to the nation’s 250th anniversary. Leading the procession is a Disneyland vehicle, decked in red, white, and blue flowers, and carrying Mickey Mouse and his friends. Marching alongside are U.S. military veterans who now work as Disney cast members.\n5. San Francisco Travel Association\nBelieve In San Francisco\n(Fiesta Productions Inc.)\nThe sights and sounds of the City by the Bay — cable cars, Pier 39, Golden Gate Bridge and more — come to life aboard this inaugural entry from the San Francisco Travel Association. 2026 promises to be a big year for the San Francisco area, which hosts Super Bowl LX on Feb. 8 and six FIFA World Cup matches in June and on July 1. Other headline activities include the Pokémon World Championships and the return of a new and improved “Bay Lights 360,” an installation by artist Leo Villareal that will illuminate a 1.8-mile stretch of the Bay Bridge.\nThe float will feature more than 100,000 individual blooms, including 15,000 fluorescent orange marigolds used to create the oversized California poppies encircling the float. Another 20,000 blue irises, hybrid delphiniums, and blue and white hydrangeas help create the waters of the San Francisco Bay. And, 25,000 red “Hearts” roses fill the roadway gardens on the Golden Gate Bridge.\nFun fact: San Francisco has been represented in the Rose Parade 30 times — 1917 was the first time, and the most recent was in 1978.\n- Dimensions: 24 feet (height), 18 feet (width), 55 feet (length)\n- Number of flowers: 100,000-plus\nRead more: 10 fun, creative and silly floats to look out for at the 2026 Rose Parade\n6. Lions International\nIn Harmony We Serve\n(Phoenix Decorating Company)\nFour lion characters — decorated with light tan, brown and gold fine-ground flax seed; manes of pampas grass; and wearing glasses of red fine-cut strawflower plus green fine-ground parsley flakes — row a canoe together in this entry from Lions International, which made its Rose Parade debut in 1948, and has been part of every procession since 1992.\nRepresenting Lions Clubs International and the Lions Clubs International Foundation, Lions International has 1.4 million members. “We improve health and well-being, strengthen communities and support those in need, locally and globally,” says the organization.\n- Dimensions: 16 feet, 6 inches (height), 18 feet (width), 35 feet (length)\n- Number of flowers: 16,000\n7. Homewood Patriot Band\nHomewood, Ala.\nAfter making their Rose Parade debut in 1984 — followed by subsequent appearances in 2003, 2009, 2014 and 2022 — this will be the Homewood Patriot Marching Band’s sixth New Year’s Day performance in Pasadena. They’ve also been regularly featured in the St. Patrick’s Day Festival in Dublin, Ireland (three times), and the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade (nine times).\n- Band director: Chris Cooper\n8. Pasadena Tournament of Roses President Mark Leavens\nMark Leavens, who has volunteered with the Tournament of Roses since 1995 and is now serving as the organization’s president, will be riding a 1967 Crown Firecoach with his family. It was built for the Pasadena Fire Department by the Crown Coach Company of Los Angeles, better known for their yellow Crown school buses.\nThe engine was built as a “triple combination,” meaning that it carried three different firefighting elements (water, a pump and fire hose). More specifically, it had a ladder, a 500-gallon water tank and it could pump 1,250 gallons of water per minute out of five hose outlets.\nFun fact: This same fire engine was seen in a 1975 episode of the TV series “Emergency!” when the fire department responded to a plane crashing into an apartment building. That episode, “The Mouse,” is available to stream on Peacock.\n9. San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance\nGiant Strides Together\n(Artistic Entertainment Services)\nIn a floral preview of Elephant Valley, which is opening March 5 at San Diego Zoo Safari Park, a towering African elephant, curling its trunk skyward, leads the way on this fifth Rose Parade entry from San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance.\nBesides the 40,000 flowers, there’s plenty of movement, too. The elephants’ trunks curl, ears flap and heads sway. Also look for four fully functioning waterfalls, engineered to circulate real water throughout the float.\nAfter winning the Animation Award in 2023, the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance has captured the Sweepstakes Award each of the past two years.\n- Dimensions: 21 feet (height), 18 feet (width), 57 feet (length)\n- Number of flowers: 40,000\n10. Cal Poly Universities\nJungle Jumpstart\n(Self-built)\nDesigned, constructed and decorated by students at Cal Poly Pomona and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, this float features rainforest animals working together to restore an old robot. It’s a visual representation of “The Magic in Teamwork” theme, and is the 77th year the two universities have worked together to produce a Rose Parade entry — a partnership that has produced 63 trophies (most recently the Leishman Public Spirit Award in 2025). As for the robot, its left arm lifts a macaw high into the air as the bird’s wings flap.\nOverall, 21,000 flowers were used along with other materials, including ground coffee beans, curly willow and walnut shells to recreate the look of soil, vines and fallen branches.\n- Dimensions: 25 feet (height), 18 feet (width), 53 feet (length)\n- Number of flowers: 21,000\n11. The Valley Hunt Club\nPasadena\nThe Valley Hunt Club — a hunting and fishing social club that came out of the 1880s Southern California land boom — is credited with starting what has become today’s Rose Parade on Jan. 1, 1890. That first procession featured a handful of horse-drawn carriages decorated with flowers and was viewed by about 250 spectators. The club’s current president and family will be traveling down Colorado Boulevard aboard another flower-decorated carriage, recalling that first procession, but this time will be cheered by hundreds of thousands people along the parade route and watched by millions of TV viewers around the globe.\n- Marshal: Art Leyendekker\n- Breeds: Friesian\n12. Kaiser Permanente\nA Better Idea for Health Care\n(Phoenix Decorating Company)\nHighlighting a team-based approach to health care — and also playing off the Rose Parade’s 2026 theme, “The Magic in Teamwork” — this entry boasts nearly 75,000 flowers including white fluffy gypsophila; light lavender roses, carnations and mums; dark lavender roses and carnations; plus white roses, carnations and mums to decorate the cloud arch from front to rear. Kaiser has been a part of 19 previous Rose Parades, and has won 15 trophies including the President Award in 2024 and the Wrigley Legacy Award last year. If you’re watching the parade from along Colorado Boulevard, that song you’re hearing is a recording of Bruno Mars’ “Count on Me.”\n- Dimensions: 20 feet (height), 18 feet (width), 55 feet (length)\n- Number of flowers: Nearly 75,000\n13. Delfines Marching Band\nXalapa, Veracruz, Mexico\nFounded in 1999, Delfines Marching Band is the oldest and largest musical group of its kind in Veracruz, Mexico — a metropolitan area with nearly 1 million residents on the country’s gulf coast about 250 miles east of Mexico City. Performance credits include more than 1,500 appearances throughout Mexico, the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Pageant at Windsor Castle in 2012, and three previous Rose Parades (2007, 2011, 2015). The band’s uniforms include charro suits and pre-Hispanic Papanteca attire.\n- Band director: Jesus Emmanuel Mendoza Gonzalez\n14. Los Hermanos Bañuelos Charro Team\nAltadena, Calif.\nDedicated to preserving the rich traditions of charrería, Mexico’s national sport, the Los Hermanos Bañuelos Charro Team was founded in 1995 and remains based in the San Gabriel Valley. Riders wear custom-made charro suits — newly designed each year — embroidered with silver; they ride on handcrafted saddles stamped with the team’s logo.\n- Marshal: Ramon Banuelos\n- Breeds: American Quarter Horse, Andalusian, Freisian, Azteca\n15. City of Santa Fe Springs\nHonoring the Past, Celebrating the Present, Inspiring the Future!\n(Phoenix Decorating Company)\nThe iconic Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe steam locomotive from Santa Fe Springs’ scenic Heritage Park is represented on the city’s 13th Rose Parade float, along with the 24-foot-tall windmill that spins. Santa Fe Springs was a Rose Parade regular in the 1960s, including in 1969 when its entry won the Grand Prize. After a 38-year hiatus, the city returned to the parade lineup in 2007 and ’08 (when it won the Extraordinaire Trophy for the most spectacular float). After 2026, organizers have already committed to the next two Rose Parades. City leaders, including Mayor William K. Rounds, are expected to ride the float.\n- Dimensions: 24 feet (height), 18 feet (width), 55 feet (length)\n- Number of flowers: 28,300\n16. Grand Marshal Earvin “Magic” Johnson\nConsidered one of the NBA’s all-time greatest point guards, Magic Johnson led the Los Angeles Lakers to five championships during the 1980s. He retired in 1991, after announcing that he was HIV-positive, and went on to become a successful entrepreneur. His early investments and partnerships included opening movie theaters in underserved urban communities; more recently, he was part of an ownership group that purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012. He’s also part-owner of several sports teams including the WNBA’s Los Angeles Sparks and the NFL’s Washington Commanders.\nJohnson will be riding in a Lincoln-Zephyr Continental Cabriolet convertible, which generally sold for $2,840 in 1940, making it one of the highest priced cars available that year. It was a time when the median annual family income was about $1,230.\nThe floral design adorning the vehicle, created by FTD, includes an abundance of yellow and purple roses — similar to the Lakers’ uniform colors — plus sunflowers, lisianthus, agapanthus, craspedia, purple artichokes, bromeliads and a variety of orchids that include cymbidium, vanda and mokaras.\n17. Kindness is Free, Powered by Boys & Girls Clubs of the West San Gabriel Valley and Eastside\nBuilding Kinder Communities\n(Artistic Entertainment Services)\nThe classic “Three Little Pigs” tale has been reimagined for the third Rose Parade entry from the Boys & Girls Clubs of the West San Gabriel Valley and Eastside. Watch as the wolf and pigs move in sequence to mimic real building actions; the bird sitting atop the mailbox also moves.\nAmong the 60,000 flowers, the shingled roof is covered in red fine-cut strawflowers; the sides of the structure are dressed in ground yellow split pea, the front door with fine-cut hot pink statice, and the windows have ground peach lentil and seaweed. The chimney is textured with ground walnut shell and soft grey poppy seed.\nThe Kindness is Free initiative — which helps youth to understand the importance of equal treatment, respect and compassion for others through words and actions — was started by this organization in 2020, and has since spread to 450 Boys and Girls Clubs across the country.\n- Dimensions: 22 feet (height), 18 feet (width), 55 feet (length)\n- Number of flowers: 60,000\n18. LAUSD All-District High School Honor Band\nLos Angeles\nWith more than 300 students from 75 high schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District — including brass and percussion musicians, drum majors and shield carriers — this unit will be making its 53rd Rose Parade appearance. They’ve also performed at past Super Bowl and World Series games, plus with musical artists including Ringo Starr and Jon Batiste. The red, white and blue uniforms are topped with the distinctive West Point-style military shako.\n- Band director: Anthony L. White\n19. Mini Therapy Horses\nCalabasas, Calif.\nFounded in 2008 by Victoria Nodiff-Netanel, Mini Therapy Horses is a Southern California nonprofit with nine small horses trained to perform tricks such as smiling, bowing, and even playing keyboards. They bring smiles and encouragement to people of all ages at hospitals, schools and other venues, and also have been used in many crisis response efforts — including mass shootings in San Bernardino, Thousand Oaks and Las Vegas, plus 2018’s devastating Woolsey fire in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. A Rose Parade crowd favorite, they’ll be returning for their eighth appearance in 2026.\n- Marshal: Victoria Nodiff-Netanel\n- Breed: American Miniature Horses\n20. Visit Mississippi\nMississippi: Where Creativity Blooms\n(Artistic Entertainment Services)\nSome of today’s most celebrated authors, musicians, storytellers and visual artists have connections to our nation’s 20th state. Nobel- and Pulitzer Prize-winning authors William Faulkner, Eudora Welty and Jesmyn Ward were born in Mississippi and/or grew up there. The late Jim Henson did, too. The puppeteer, who created the Muppets, listed the “birthplace” of Kermit the Frog as Leland, Mississippi, where a museum celebrates Henson’s legacy. You’ll find those and several other highlights on this sophomore entry from Visit Mississippi.\n- Dimensions: 21 feet, 6 inches (height), 18 feet (width), 55 feet (length)\n- Number of flowers: 90,000\n21. City of South Pasadena\nThe Great Picnic Heist!\n(Self-built)\nThe South Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association, the producers of this colorful entry, is an all-volunteer organization that has been constructing and decorating floats since 1893. To reduce float-building costs, and also to better involve the community, the organizers asked residents to donate two types of bark (eucalyptus and malaluka), along with sycamore and liquid amber leaves, plus bougainvillea flowers. Also, there are 15 varieties of roses on the float, including Toffee, Coffee Break, Sweet Unique and Pink Floyd).\nThe South Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association is riding a four-year streak of winning entries, after earning the 2025 Fantasy Award, the 2024 Founder’s Trophy, the 2023 Bob Hope Humor Award and the 2022 Founder’s Trophy.\n- Dimensions: 26 feet (height), 18 feet (width), 45 feet (length)\n- Number of flowers: 20,000\n22. Arcadia Apache Marching Band and Color Guard\nArcadia, Calif.\nMaking their 19th Rose Parade appearance, this unit is well-versed at performing on a big stage. After winning a Southern California 6A level marching band competition in 2015, they were elevated to a national list from which they were selected to appear in a commercial that aired during Super Bowl XLIX. They’ve also marched in two Presidential Inaugural Parades and appeared on the TV game show “Let’s Make a Deal.”\n- Band directors: Kevin Sherrill, Tom Plunkett\n23. Budweiser Clydesdales\nSt. Louis\nRaised at Anheuser-Busch’s Missouri farm, the Budweiser Clydesdales have been a Rose Parade favorite since their first appearance in 1953. The bay-colored horses stand 18 hands high and weigh about 2,000 pounds each; they have signature white stockings plus a blaze of white on the face, and flowing black manes and tails.\n- Marshal: Todd Radermacher\n- Breeds: Clydesdale hitch teams always travel with a total of 10 “gentle giants.”\n24. Trader Joe’s\nYou Float Our Boat!\n(Phoenix Decorating Company)\nFrom front to back, there’s lots of activity on this entry from Trader Joe’s, including: colored water flowing from a bottle that rotates 360 degrees; the fish on the deck bob, and the pickle and squash sway back and forth; the three fruit masts at the center rock side to side (the second one is 28 feet high, and the others are 26 feet high); and the six utensils (knives, spoons and forks) plus the kitchen mixer beaters manually move to give the appearance of propelling it forward.\nThe ice cream float at the float’s front (say that three times fast) includes blueberries of blue fine-cut statice, raspberries of hot pink fine-cut strawflower, and cherries of red fine-cut strawflower; the straw is decorated with white fine-ground rice and yellow fine-cut strawflower; and the glass and base inside features white fine-ground rice, light pink fine-cut strawflower.\nAs for one of the floral characters, the parrot captain is dressed in yellow carnations (front), red fine-cut strawflower (back), red carnation petals and blue fine-cut statice (wings), and its wearing a hat with crème pampas grass, blue fine-cut statice and yellow fine-cut strawflower.\nWinner of 16 awards during its past 23 years as part of the Rose Parade, Trader Joe’s is riding a four-year streak of trophy winners: Showmanship (2025), Animation (2024), Wrigley Legacy (2023) and Americana (2022).\n- Dimensions: 28 feet (height), 18 feet (width), 65 feet (length)\n- Number of flowers: 58,900\n25. Rotary\nUnite for Good\n(Phoenix Decorating Company)\nRiding a three-parade streak of presenting award winners, Rotary’s 46th Rose Parade entry represents the interconnectedness of all living beings and a shared responsibility to protect the planet’s diverse ecosystems. It’s fitting because the global service organization, with a membership of 1.2 million business and community leaders, works “toward a healthier and more peaceful world” in communities around the globe, according to the organization.\nAboard the float, the giraffes feature bodies of brown coffee, white fine-ground rice and gold clover seed, with tails of tan uva grass; the tigers have heads and bodies of white fine-ground rice, black onion seed, orange fine-ground lentil, yellow fine-ground split pea, and brown fine-ground flax seed.

Black seaweed and brown palm bark complete the structure. The futuristic flying city will be detailed with tan sesame seed, grey silverleaf, orange lentils, and blue statice, highlighted with green parsley flakes.

The UPS Store\nSharing Skills for Success\n(Artistic Entertainment Services)\nWith an under-the-sea themed float, The UPS Store returns with a majestic 34-foot-tall seahorse coaching his charges through a synchronized swimming routine. It’s adorned with an impressive number of flowers (170,000) and natural elements. Corn husk, sesame seed, orange slices, and both whole and ground lentil were used on the coach, along with vibrant red carnations for the crown and spine. The baby seahorses were crafted with a corn husk belly and sesame seed accents, accented with sides of yellow split pea and ground peach lentil. Orange slices add a lively pop of color, while the manes glow in orange safflower.\nThis marks The UPS Store’s eighth Rose Parade, and when it comes to winning awards their record is perfect — with the most recent kudos being the Bob Hope Humor Award in 2024 and the Judges’ Award in 2025.\nRiding aboard the float will be four Los Angeles area Junior Achievement students, outfitted in scuba gear, selected as a result of their outstanding participation in JA courses. There’s a nationwide partnership between The UPS Store and Junior Achievement USA; nearly $7 million in customer donations have been made since the program began in 2022.\n- Dimensions: 34 feet (height), 18 feet (width), 55 feet (length)\n- Number of flowers: 170,000\n30.

Indiana University Marching Band\nFormed in 1896, the Indiana University Marching Hundred has a long and rich history. It started as a 22-member unit in 1896; by the mid-1920s, the band’s size had grown and it was nicknamed the Marching One-Hundred. Years later, the name was adjusted to the Marching Hundred, or simply the Hundred. In 1925, John Philip Sousa visited Bloomington, and declared the Marching Hundred “one of the snappiest marching and playing bands in the country.” The ensemble has performed at the Kentucky Derby (1939), a Presidential Inaugural Parade (1953) and a variety of college football bowl games.\n- Band director: David C.

Of the nearly 31,500 flowers packed onto this 35-foot-long float are light pink, pink and hot pink carnation petals, along with xmas red mums and purple fine-cut statice; yellow fine-cut strawflower decorates the faces of the bees.

After taking office, Gordo helped lead the city through the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery, and also during a period of mass retirements and the search for a new city manager.\nMore recently, Gordo led Pasadena’s effort to assist neighboring Altadena during and since the devastating Eaton fire; on Jan. 13, he wrote this: “Pasadena and Altadena are communities built over generations, each with a fabric that makes them unique. And while we are separate legal entities, we are one collective community. … Pasadena and Altadena are resilient and strong.”\nGordo and his family will be riding in a 1937 American LaFrance fire engine, first acquired by the Petaluma, Calif., Fire Department through President Roosevelt’s New Deal.

The hotcakes are covered in cornmeal, several colors of chrysanthemums, various grains and seeds and topped with dripping floral syrup.\nWhile there’s plenty of whimsy, there’s some seriousness here, too — a memorial garden, filled with yellow roses in commemorative vials, wraps around the float’s front, just behind the title sign.\nWhen it comes to award-winners, the Sierra Madre Rose Float Association is riding an impressive streak: 18 kudos during the last 19 Rose Parades.\n- Dimensions: 24 feet (height), 16 feet (width), 48 feet, 5 inches (length)\n- Number of flowers: Nearly 37,000\n47.

Closing Show\nCapital Cities, the Grammy-nominated, platinum-selling artist, and DEK of Hearts, the recently crowned Mic Drop winner on NBC’s “The Voice,” will bring the 137th Rose Parade to a high-energy close. Joining them will be 24 dancers tearing through a range of styles — from flappers to hip-hop — against the backdrop of classic cars spanning several eras.",
