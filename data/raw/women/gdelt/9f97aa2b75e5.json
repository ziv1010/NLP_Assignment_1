  "body_text": "Disney+ scores rights to UEFA Women's Champions League matches\nThe streaming giant will show Women's Champions League matches from next season, October 2025\nDisney+ will be the home of the UEFA Women’s Champions League across Europe from next season, allowing fans to watch every match live at no extra cost. The announcement follows a five-year deal in which the streaming giant has secured live rights to the competition from 2025/26 to 2029/30.\nThe platform will be the only place fans can watch all live matches in the competition. Coverage on Disney+ will launch in October 2025, with the introduction of the 18-team League phase format.\nAll 75 matches in the competition, from the League phase to the 2026 Final at Ullevaal Stadion, Oslo, will be live-streamed on Disney+. ESPN, Disney’s multiplatform sports brand, will produce all live matches, offering commentary in multiple languages and pre-game and post-game programming.\nKarl Holmes, general manager of Disney+ EMEA, said: “The UEFA Women’s Champions League is the very best in football performance, dedication, and passion. Bringing this incredible tournament to Disney+ customers and audiences speaks to our commitment to delivering a huge range of bold and dynamic entertainment.\n\"As women’s football continues to grow with audiences worldwide, we’re proud to offer the thrill and excitement of every single match to Disney+ customers across Europe, at no extra cost.”\nGuy-Laurent Epstein, co-managing director of UC3, said: “The UEFA Women’s Champions League has seen exceptional growth in recent years, with record-breaking attendance, rising standards, and increasing global interest. These new broadcast deals not only reflect this but are important milestones in the continued development of women’s football in Europe, underscoring its growing importance and appeal to fans worldwide. We look forward to working with Disney+ and the Free-To-Air broadcast partners to continue to grow the women’s game in Europe.”\nStarting at £4.99 per month, Disney+ has a large entertainment catalogue, including exclusive movies and TV series in a wide range of genres, including action-adventure, Sci-Fi, and documentaries, as well as critically acclaimed drama and comedy.\nAlongside award-winning titles from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic. Hundreds of Disney+ subscribers have shared their experience of the platform on Trustpilot.\nOne user wrote: \"Absolutely great! The best TV platform that caters to dyslexia and eyesight accessibility with many subtitle settings. Being someone who experiences bad hearing loss and I’m dyslexic and find it easier to see pink text, I can finally watch TV with less struggle. Worth every penny of my subscription, never seen anything like this elsewhere.\"\nAnother wasn't as pleased, writing: \"This is ok, the things available are great. But the only letdown is that you can't remove things from the watch list on TVs, even though you have watched a full film or episode, it's still showing that you haven't watched the full episode. Should be able to remove items through app on TVs.\"\nIn other streaming app sports news, Netflix signed a deal with WWE this year and is now showing WWE live events. Subscribers can watch WWE Raw, SmackDown, NXT, and WWE programmes on the platform.\nMeanwhile, NOW subscribers can watch all 12 live channels and every Sky Sports+ stream, with memberships from £14.99 per month. Sportwing events covered on NOW include the Premier League, Formula 1, the US Open and EFL.",
