But there they were, in mid-December 1993, kicking off the 1994 World Cup with a draw that attendees remember as “unique,” “hysterical,” “bizarre” and “out of body.”\nAdvertisement\nThere was 57-year-old Sepp Blatter, charming colleagues and running the show as FIFA’s secretary general.\nAnd there was the Italian delegation, having just staged a classic World Cup in 1990, now gawking at moving statues inside Caesars, the famed casino hotel that became FIFA’s hub for the week.\nThere were, according to Soccer America, German national team players at blackjack tables. There was Roy Hodgson, the British coach of Switzerland, collecting change to play slots. There were FIFA officials enjoying opulent suites, then hopping around “Sin City” on lavish per diems, some “looking where they can commit some sins,” Blatter says with a smile. The night before the draw, they attended a glitzy gala, and some arrived at the ballroom accompanied by female escorts, according to one witness. Another remembers seeing a FIFA executive walking through the halls of Caesars with a brown paper bag; inside, the executive said, was $250,000 in cash, collected from a casino banking window, earmarked for the soccer federations whose teams had qualified.\nThis, amid cigarette smoke and lowlife gamblers, was how the 1994 World Cup launched in America — in a very different setting than this week’s 2026 World Cup draw in Washington, D.C.\nAfter a dizzying week of meetings and parties, thousands gathered at the Las Vegas Convention Center on Dec. 19, 1993. Pelé, soccer’s most recognizable star, was sidelined by a bitter FIFA president, João Havelange; but celebrities of all sorts were present. James Brown opened the show with “Living in America”; Vanessa Williams, a former Miss America, closed it; and comedian Robin Williams stole it with mid-draw jokes that poked fun at Sepp Bladder’s name.\n“It couldn’t have been more American,” says Charlie Stillitano, a longtime soccer executive who attended.\nAmerican and strange. “The strangest thing that I’ve seen,” Stillitano says of the scene.\nAdvertisement\n“It was kind of a surreal experience,” says Barry Adelman, who co-produced and wrote the show for Dick Clark Productions.\n“And it will never be matched,” Blatter says. “It’s impossible.”\nThis is the story of the surreality, of the 1994 World Cup draw and FIFA’s Vegas adventure, as told by those who planned it and lived it.\n‘The greatest show that FIFA’s ever seen’\nThe story begins in the brain of a Swiss lawyer named Guido Tognoni, who, two decades earlier, as a recent University of Zurich graduate, took a trip to Vegas. “I didn’t have the money to gamble,” Tognoni says, “but it was very impressive for a little Swiss guy to see the unbelievable hotels, the 24-hour lifestyle they have.” He was wowed, he says, by “what the Americans did out of a piece of desert.”\nBack in Switzerland, he started his career as a journalist. He later became FIFA’s media relations director and World Cup project manager. But on the side, he and a handful of friends would play blackjack. Their group would gather every other month, and ultimately stayed together 40 years, under the formal umbrella of ABJUFA — the Association of Blackjack Unions, Federations and Associations — according to Tognoni.\nSo, “Las Vegas was always in my mind, because it’s a place of blackjack,” he says. In 1993, when FIFA sought a site for the 1994 World Cup draw, Tognoni suggested it. There was “opposition,” Blatter says, from only one member of the FIFA executive committee, who worried about sin in “Sin City”; everyone else was on board.\n“And there was another factor,” Blatter claims in a Zoom interview from his home in Zurich. “I had, at that time, a relationship with a lovely young lady. And she said: ‘Make me a favor, do it in Las Vegas.’”\nThe U.S. organizing committee also loved the idea, because it had a non-traditional vision for the World Cup draw. It was, in the words of press officer Jim Trecker: “We’re gonna put on the greatest show that FIFA’s ever seen.”\nAdvertisement\nAt previous draws, the picking of orbs and the sorting of teams into groups had captivated a soccer-obsessed audience. In America, though, “we weren’t sure how much support for soccer there was,” Alan Rothenberg, the organizing committee’s CEO, recalls. One poll in late 1993 showed that only 13 percent of Americans knew the World Cup was coming. “We were doing everything we could in ’94 to make sure the public perceived this as a big event,” Rothenberg says.\nSo they didn’t just take the draw to Vegas. They hired Dick Clark Productions, whose aim was to “book as many big names as we could,” Adelman says. They got Brown, the “Godfather of Soul”; and other musicians, such as Stevie Wonder and Barry Manilow. They arranged and filmed an opening montage featuring actors William Shatner and David Hasselhoff, the Harlem Globetrotters and U.S. President Bill Clinton. Later segments introducing the host cities featured NFL star Walter Payton and … Mickey Mouse.\nThey hired actress Faye Dunaway to co-host with Dick Clark. The draw assistants, many paraded onstage to pick one solitary orb out of a glass bowl, included supermodel Carol Alt, actors Tom Selleck and Beau Bridges, racecar driver Mario Andretti and heavyweight boxer Evander Holyfield.\n“I didn’t really know all that much about soccer,” Alt says. She doesn’t remember what, exactly, was in the orb she was picking. The draw itself, she recalls, was “anticlimactic.”\nBut the entire event was fun — and upended FIFA norms.\nA decade earlier, at España 1982, the World Cup draw featured Blatter, Havelange and two other soccer executives sitting at a desk inside Madrid’s Palacio de Congresos. Blatter read from a script. Kids from a local school ferried the all-important orbs from spinning caskets to the desk. The primary entertainment came when one orb broke; old men in suits spent minutes trying to fish it out of the casket. The entire ceremony lasted less than 40 minutes.\nBy Italia 1990, singers and actress Sophia Loren were involved. Soccer legends participated.\n“But here,” Blatter says of USA 1994, “it was a totally other atmosphere.”\nAdvertisement\nThe 1990 draw was held at a small sports arena in Rome, and stayed culturally close to what FIFA — soccer’s Zurich-based, Euro-centric global governing body — has always been. It was full of “straight-laced people,” Stillitano says. “Everyone’s wearing a suit and tie, everyone’s buttoned up, everyone’s respectful to the president.”\nFour years later, they flew to Vegas and got, as Stillitano says, “exactly the opposite.”\nThe juxtaposition of FIFA executives and Vegas\nThey came, first and foremost, for business. There were meetings of coaches and FIFA committees. There were summits for World Cup sponsors and venue directors. There was an expo hall overflowing with companies hawking soccer-adjacent products. There were press conferences, including one in which Rothenberg laid out his original vision for Major League Soccer, which would launch off the back of the World Cup and “soon rank with the finest (leagues) in the world,” Rothenberg promised.\nBut there were also “spare-no-expense dinners” every night, says Scott LeTellier, the organizing committee’s managing director and COO. They would take over entire restaurants. Then, on the eve of the draw, everyone who was anyone — over 1,000 people in total, according to Marla Messing, the organizing committee’s executive vice president — filtered into a Caesars Palace ballroom for plated meals and a performance from Motown frontman Smokey Robinson.\nThe following day, they and others — from U.S. men’s national team players to Caesars Palace high-rollers — filled a makeshift theater in the convention center. Spotlights jumped around the cavernous hall. Dancers and guitarists boogied; smoke shot into the air; and Brown, legendary for his energy, waltzed to the front of the stage. He grabbed the mic, and when James Brown grabbed a mic, in any other setting, “he always got a certain reaction from the audience,” Adelman says. His voice and soul would pull people out of their seats.\nBut on this occasion, “there were 3,000 people in that audience, and at least 2,000 of ’em were guys in suits,” Adelman recalls. “And nobody was up moving with James.”\nThey clapped, politely, and highlighted what Stillitano calls “the juxtaposition of traditional FIFA people and Las Vegas.”\nAdvertisement\nThe Robin Williams takeover\nAs the draw droned on, a backstage area of dressing rooms, nourished by a pop-up McDonald’s, buzzed with activity. Alt, the supermodel, chatted with Andretti, the driver. At one point, Williams, the acclaimed star of Mrs Doubtfire, approached U.S. women’s national team star Michelle Akers, and “I was expecting him to cut up and be a comedian,” Akers says. Instead, “he was a total and complete soccer fan. He knew everything about my career.” In fact, Adelman says, Williams had indicated early in the booking process that he wanted to be involved.\nWilliams, though, did not sign up for a simple soccer event. When someone backstage told him to stay on script and “don’t fool around,” Williams went to Adelman and asked: “Is it OK for me to have some fun up there?”\nAdelman’s answer soon became evident.\nWilliams had about 10 minutes to work with, so, when he skipped onstage to assist Blatter with Pot 4 of the draw, he wasted no time. “Mr. Bladder,” he said as he grasped Blatter’s hand, “so nice to meet you after feeling you for so many years.”\n“Thank you,” Blatter said with a chuckle.\n“You’re full, I guess,” Williams continued. “Good.”\nMany of the thousands in attendance guffawed. They continued to laugh as Williams tugged on a white glove. He joked about blue balls. He said to Blatter: “Funny, I met you just in the men’s room a minute ago!”\nSome “purists” found the improv routine disrespectful. They revered Blatter, who had been with FIFA since the 1970s, and they came from cultures where roasting soccer executives was taboo.\nBut Blatter himself? The back-and-forth “was absolutely outstanding,” he recalls. He’d studied theater in college and considered himself a “showman.” He was comfortable and often masterful onstage. Soccer America’s Paul Kennedy described him as “the Swiss Alex Trebek.”\nAdvertisement\nBlatter admits to being “surprised” by Williams’ playful jabs, but he put on his actor’s facade and didn’t show it. Nor did he scold Williams. “No,” Blatter recalls, “I said, ‘Let’s do it.’” He laughed along and mostly let Williams flow. Afterward, he says, they hugged.\nBlatter and FIFA, in general, leaned into the free-spirited Americanness of it all. It clashed with tradition but brought the 1994 World Cup to life. FIFA, Rothenberg says, “saw, probably for the first time, the opportunity to have entertainment combined with soccer.” They were thrilled with the end result.\n“The only thing I still feel sorry about,” Tognoni says, “is that the Pelé show went wrong.”\nThe conflict over Pelé\nThe soccer legends appeared, one by one, for Pot 2 of the draw. First came Portugal’s Eusebio. England’s Bobby Charlton, France’s Michel Platini and Holland’s Marco van Basten eventually joined Cameroon’s Roger Milla and USMNT captain Tony Meola onstage.\nThose names, however, meant nothing to most Americans. The only footballer they recognized was Pelé. And Pelé, curiously, was watching from somewhere off camera, buried among commoners in the audience.\nWhy? Because Havelange, the stony Brazilian president of FIFA, essentially barred him. The story at the time was that Pelé had accused the Brazilian soccer federation — run by Havelange’s son-in-law, Ricardo Teixeira — of taking bribes. The two parties had sued each other. Havelange sided with Teixeira. And “Havelange was so stubborn,” Tognoni and Blatter both say.\nRothenberg fought with Havelange. Blatter did too. “He was fighting until the last minute,” Tognoni says, “to get Pele on the stage.” Celebrities were looking forward to meeting him, and disappointed by his absence. Blatter thought about at least mentioning Pelé during the ceremony, but “I got the veto from (Havelange),” he says.\nAdvertisement\n“And I should have done it. I should have done it, really,” Blatter continues. “All of the members of the (FIFA) executive committee … said that if Pelé’s there, mention Pelé. It would be good for promotion, for television, for everything.”\nBlatter, though, says Havelange told him: “If you mention the name of Pelé, I stand up and I close the ceremony.”\n“I feared,” Blatter says, “if I called Pelé, (Havelange) will not only stop the show, he will get rid of me.”\nThe actual draw\nPelé v. Havelange was the juiciest controversy entering the draw. The draw itself delivered another. When Colombia appeared from Pot 2, as the second team drawn, Blatter — unassisted by the computerized systems that now guide draws — sent the South American giants all the way to the sixth group, and to a matchup with the U.S. in Los Angeles. Sitting in a front row, Rothenberg fumed. Witnesses describe him being “furious” and “screaming at (FIFA director) Walter Gagg,” “livid” and “demonstrably pissed.”\n“I lost it,” Rothenberg admits.\nHe lost it because Colombia was viewed as a title contender, and there was no clear rationale for skipping four groups. Blatter says he had to “avoid” placing South American teams together, and avoid a U.S.-Mexico matchup, but there was no reason Colombia couldn’t have been paired with Germany in the very first group. (The next team drawn, Bolivia, did go with Germany.) Blatter and FIFA had conducted a dress rehearsal the day before, and “had they followed (protocol) the same way at the draw, we would not have drawn Colombia in our group,” Rothenberg says.\nBut Bora Milutinović, the U.S. coach, had a very different reaction to the U.S. group.\n“Bora could not have been any happier about it,” then-USMNT defender Alexi Lalas says.\nAnd six months later, a stunning victory over Colombia effectively sent the U.S. through to the round of 16.\nAdvertisement\nSo the draw became a footnote. The story, and the legacy, was the show. It was “about as tacky, Las Vegas and commercial as it gets,” Soccer America’s Duncan Irving wrote at the time, which was “just what FIFA ordered.” It fulfilled FIFA’s expectations for “something really big,” Tognoni says. “It was a new standard.”\nTraditionalists grumbled. Soccer America quoted one British journalist saying, “What the f*** has all this got to do with football?”\nBut they were “a minority,” Trecker notes. Everyone else, Rothenberg says, “was delighted.”\nMany were also relieved. FIFA, in awarding World Cup hosting rights to a country where soccer was niche and relatively nascent, had taken a risk. The draw helped dispel any lingering skepticism. It raised awareness for the tournament, and became proof that America was, as Tognoni says, “a new frontier.”\nIt also “planted a flag,” Lalas says. “It said, this is going to be a World Cup unlike anything that you have seen before. We are going to go in a different direction. And we’re going to lean into the Americanness.”",
