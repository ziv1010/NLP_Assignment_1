  "body_text": "Renée Slegers was back in front of the media for her pre-Brighton press conference at the Sobha Realty Training Centre on Friday.\nOur head coach was asked about her thoughts Sunday's opposition, team selections and more.\nHere's what she had to say on the following subjects...\non team news after the Lyon game:\nEveryone was on the training pitch today, we have more day to go tomorrow of course but everyone’s fit at the moment apart from Leah Williamson.\non if there’s extra pressure on us to win on Sunday:\nLike we said there’s extremely high expectations on ourselves and that’s the very, very strongest and of course we want to and need to win more.\non if it’s hard not to look ahead to the Chelsea game already:\nI’m not looking at that game already, I’m looking at Brighton only, on Sunday. I think what’s most important for us right now is to be in the present and everything that’s done, that’s done, we can’t affect it any more. The only thing we can focus on is the here and now and do our very, very best to get the most out of this moment, that’s the most important. Of course, after Brighton, we have Benfica and then there’s a break, then the next block of games start again.\non the title race when there’s not much margin for error, with Chelsea only drawing three times last season:\nThat was last season. I know there’s certain statistics from previous seasons. This is this season and we’re still early in the season. We can’t control what the others do, but we know that we have to do what we can do. We’re very disappointed and not happy with the last three results in the WSL. We definitely want more and that’s what we’re going after. It’s all we can do and let’s start on Sunday.\non if we feel we have to be perfect until the end of the season:\nLike I said, there’s always very high expectations on ourselves. I don’t think there’s any games or training when you’re at Arsenal where you don’t strive for perfection. But things aren’t always perfect and we’re working really hard to get the wins over the line and work on parts in our games that we want to do better, that’s all we can do.\non how to address Tuesday’s defensive errors against Lyon:\nWe're very open and honest with the players. Staff and players, we all want the same thing. We have a shared purpose and we want to go in the same direction. When things are hard for us at the moment, there's not a single person in the group who doesn't want to solve this and contribute to it. We all want the same thing. Of course, no one wants to turn the ball over in the field. There are certain actions that become costly for us. We have looked at it all together. It's not only the football. It's a piece of it, the psychology as well. How we stay in games, how we react to certain moments. I looked at a really inspirational video of Roger Federer. What he did as a tennis player to go from point to point. That's all we're looking at and we do that together as a group. This week, everything has been very honest and transparent. We spent a lot of time together. What I see and what I take from it is that everyone wants the same thing, everyone wants Arsenal to succeed.\non how it’s felt starting the season how we have after the high at the end of last season:\nLike I said, I have to stay very levelled. If we have a clear head as a staff, and have clarity in what we see and what we think, then I think that projects onto the player group. That's the most important and that's what we can do. Of course, we keep on looking at the wider picture, the bigger perspective, where we want to go, and then go into the details. Then you go small and then you go big again. That's where we want to work together with the players. That's all we can do. Of course, I'm a winner as well. I do want to win every single game, of course. But I'm also a realist. The game is on a very high level. There are going to be spells for every professional sports team, for every athlete, that are harder for you. That's what you need to go through. The champions, they find ways. They come back after setbacks; that’s what we’re striving for. We want to find as much inspiration as possible, and as many details as possible, to find our way back again, because we really believe in ourselves as a team.\non Daphne van Domselaar’s form this season and if goalkeepers need a psychological rest:\nOf course, the goalkeeper’s position is a special position in a team. But I think with that, if you shy away from the problem, I think you make the obstacle even bigger. I don't think that's necessarily the solution, always from a psychological perspective. That's not what we're doing, or what we're thinking, or what we're seeing. But it's a really good question. Football is football, and there's a lot involved in football. How you connect with the team, how you play tactically, tactically for every single player. But there's also a lot of psychology in football. We try to do everything we can to stretch and support the players on all levels. I think what I'm happy with is, like I just said, the players' mindset and wanting to move forward and being constructive. I think we have a really good support staff, a good system around it to be able to help all players in that way.\non if Leah Williamson’s absence requires a personnel or systematic change:\nEvery individual brings certain qualities. The centre-backs that have now played in a position where Leah played most of the time last year, they bring other qualities. We will always look at what are the qualities this player brings, what do we want them to do on the pitch, and where do we want to and need to support them from a partnership perspective and players around each other. That's always going to be the case with every single player on the pitch. Of course, Leah is a fantastic player. She was so good for us and she's making progress in her rehab. Of course, we look forward to getting her back, she’ll bring a lot of things. At the moment, we have other centre-backs playing who bring their qualities. Leah Williamson is not the same as Laia Codina. Steph Catley is not the same as Lotte Wubben-Moy. Katie Reid is not the same, they’re all different players, but they all bring their qualities.\non how Michelle and Rosa have done on loan at Brighton:\nI'm really happy to see them play. They're two really good players. They're getting a lot of minutes now in the WSL, in good positions high up the pitch. You see them being challenged and it's really good to see them active in the league against the best opposition and getting a lot of minutes. That's really, really good. It's been a joy to watch them. There's a really good support system in place there as well, with our loans manager and conversations and feedback sessions and contact with the club. Now I'm really happy with how that's going.\non if it was a difficult decision to let Michelle go out on loan after such a successful summer:\nYes, of course. We have to think long-term and what we think is best for the players. I think what's really good for them, for both Rosa and Mich, is just to get a good amount of minutes on a weekly basis and build robustness in that sense and develop it in that way in game situations. I'm happy that they get so much minutes and that they're improving.\non if Daphne is our number one and will be starting on Sunday:\nShe's such a good goalkeeper in all aspects. We have a really strong goalkeeper union with Manu and Anneke. We're happy with the goalkeepers. They're driving and pushing each other every single day. All of them are strong and they make each other better. Who will play on Sunday, you'll see. But I'm really happy with both of them.\non what she said about watching Roger Federer for inspiration:\nIt's really clear in my head, that's why I brought it up. We had a look today. He talks about the percentage of games he's won in his career and the percentage of points he's won in his career. That's really interesting. He talks about his mindset. The point he's playing for at the moment is the most important point. But then that's done. When that point is over, he goes on to the next one. I think he won, as he says himself, 54% of his points. He's one of the best two times at tennis. That says something about how he comes back after points and how he was really good at being good in the most important moments, the points that count. That was good inspiration. I also do want to put things into perspective and look at wider things and get inspiration from other athletes and sports teams. Like I just mentioned earlier, all athletes and teams go through different times. It's about how you come back. That's why this was brought up because we spoke about Roger Federer this morning.\non what leadership means to her in moments like this:\nRole modelling the right things, making sure that everyone is going in the same direction, everyone is engaged and involved. That's really important. Empowering the right people at the right times. When we need energy, we need someone taking the stage that will bring the energy. If we need someone with a really reflective mindset and an outside perspective or an inside perspective, then we give that person a stage. I think the most important thing that I can do right now is to stay levelled and to stay positive. Keep on seeing and re-emphasising all the things that we're good at and that we do well, and the things that we want to focus on, and just giving the team direction and work closely together with the staff and the leadership group.\non what she would tell people who were critical of our recruitment in January:\nThat I'm really happy with the squad, and it was good that we got our business done early. I'm happy with where we're at with the team. It's always a balance of how much change do you make in one window. It's not that easy, I think, if you can see things from the outside. It's also what actually is possible and how our process is. If you get a player that you lose because of injury, for example, it's not that easy that you just go in and you find a similar player and you sign that player, and that's business done. It's not that simple, of course. I'm really happy with where we're at with the squad. I think we brought in some really good quality in certain positions. There's good competition across most of the positions. I think we have good consistency with the personality of the squad.\non her thoughts on Brighton this season:\nI think they do a lot of interesting things. They're unpredictable in the way they set up. Both in and out of possession, they change from game to game, and they seem to have a really interesting philosophy. I think they play good football. It's going to be a good opposition, so I have a lot of respect for what Dario is doing with Brighton. We're prepared for different scenarios in this game because they can come out and do different things. Just like last year, their set-ups were different in the home and away game, so we'll see what they will bring on Sunday. So we'll have to prepare for different scenarios.\non if Tuesday was a good time to play Lyon early in the season:\nWe want to be competing with the best teams, and I think if you look at Lyon and their front four, it's on such a high level. So the quickness of their decision-making, their quality on the ball, the physicality, speed. So it was a real, real challenge. That's what Lyon brings in games, but then there are different challenges in other games. What we want to do is to play our game, ours in our way, and stick to our identity, and keep on stretching ourselves in the different areas where we feel like we can stretch ourselves.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
