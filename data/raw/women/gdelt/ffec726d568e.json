  "body_text": "Hawthorn defender Catherine Brown will be retiring from AFLW, effective immediately, following two seasons with the Hawks.\nThe 29-year-old was signed by the club ahead of its inaugural AFLW season and went on to play every game in 2022.\nFollowing a strong off-season, Brown was then elevated to Hawthorn’s leadership group in 2023.\nShe suited up on six occasions this season before rupturing her ACL in the lead-up to Hawthorn’s Round 7 win over Sydney.\nPrior to her AFLW career, Brown spent four seasons at A-League Women’s side Canberra United before turning her attention to Aussie Rules at Canberra side, Eastlake Demons.\n“Having overcome so much adversity and injury setbacks, it’s been a privilege to make it as far as I did in AFLW,” Brown said.\n“I wouldn’t be where I am without my family, teammates, coaches, support staff and of course, the amazing members and fans we have at the Hawks.\n“I thank everyone who supported me throughout my two seasons in the brown and gold and can’t wait to watch what this team produces in years to come.”\nHawthorn General Manager of Football Operations Max Bailey said that Brown would be missed.\n“Catherine impressed us with not only her playing ability but also her character as a teammate and leader,” Bailey said.\n“While it’s sad to see her go, we hope she is proud of what she has achieved in her two seasons at Hawthorn.\n“As a club, we wish her every success in her next chapter.”",
