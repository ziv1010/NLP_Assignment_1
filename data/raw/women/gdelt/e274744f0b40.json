How our streets and landmarks tell our history | TLH 200\nWhat’s in our names?\nFor years, former Tallahassee Democrat columnist and city historian Gerald Ensley shared brief vignettes in the pages of the Tallahassee Democrat on the historical figures and meanings behind the streets that people travel and the landmarks that residents love.\nThese waypoints tell the tale of Florida's capital city.\nRepublishing his Local Names series has been one of the most repeated requests from readers to the Tallahassee Democrat. So here, today, for the first time, we republish his complete collection, lightly updated and edited. It's long, so bookmark it, settle in and enjoy the story of us.\nHappy 200th birthday, Tallahassee and Leon County.\nBICENTENNIAL PARTY PLANNER: A guide to a weekend of events in Tallahassee\nTHE MAIN EVENT: 'I'm coming home': T-Pain concert in Tallahassee is 200 years in the making\nWORK IN PROGRESS: TLH 200: An evolving list of 200 history makers who shaped Tallahassee of today\nSCHOOL HALLS OF HISTORY: The historic figures and educators behind Leon County school names\nConcrete posts once marked Tallahassee's streets\nFor more than 40 years, Tallahassee streets were identified by concrete, waist-high posts in the ground — several of which remain around Tallahassee. The four-sided posts were white with street names in black lettering.\nThey were installed in Tallahassee in 1936. They were replaced by aluminum signs on tall, metal posts in 1979 when national traffic codes required street signs to be reflective and high enough to be viewed easily.\nThe concrete markers also caused more damage than metal posts when struck by cars and presented maintenance problems: \"Every two to three years we had to repaint them and re-stencil the street names,\" said Ellis Cheshire, a retired city street markers supervisor.\nSome of the concrete markers were re-used by the city as parking lot bumpers and barriers, such as on Martin Street, where 30 of them prevent cars from driving into Lafayette Park. Some were used for erosion control, such as at the Tallahassee Museum. Residents claimed some as mementos and a few, now weathered and illegible, remain on street corners.\nPottsdamer was prominent Black landowner, cigar maker\nPottsdamer Street, in the Callen neighborhood in southwest Tallahassee, is named for Edward A. Pottsdamer, a prominent Tallahassee Black businessman and land owner in the first half of the 20th century.\nPottsdamer was born in Lake City in 1877 and moved to Tallahassee in 1891. He apparently apprenticed at the Wahnish Cigar Factory in the All Saints neighborhood, before starting his own nearby E. A. Pottsdamer Cigar Company. In 1922, he won the blue ribbon at the state fair for making Florida's best cigar.\nPottsdamer acquired significant Tallahassee property. In 1929, he deeded property to the Leon County School Board, where a new Lincoln High was built after fire destroyed the original school. In the early 1970s, the city and county purchased land for the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center from Pottsdamer's heirs.\nPottsdamer was active in civic affairs: In 1920, he was elected to the board of the state Republican Party; in 1938, he was elected to the executive board of the Leon County Republican Party. He was a Mason, a member of the Knights of Pythias, head of the Black community bond drive during World War II and won a Silver Eagle Award for his work with Boy Scouts.\nThough Pottsdamer and his wife, Pinkie, were childless, they raised two nephews. The older boy died in 1920, at age 7, when he was electrocuted by a live electric wire, downed by a storm, at the corner of Madison and Bronough streets. The younger nephew, Vinzant Pottsdamer, was a Marine Corps veteran who taught at Lincoln High (1950-1966) and Atlanta before his death in 1997.\nThe Callen neighborhood, between the FSU golf course and Pine View Elementary, was developed in 1953 by then-Tallahassee Police Chief Frank Stoutamire. The three streets are Pottsdamer, Gunn and Callen. Dr. William Gunn was Tallahassee's first Black physician. Maude Callen was Gunn's niece, who was raised by her uncle, graduated from Florida A&M, was a nurse-midwife in South Carolina and became famous in 1951 as the subject of a photo essay in Life magazine.\nEdward Pottsdamer died in 1961 and is buried beside his wife, who died in 1957, in the Old City Cemetery. Several home furnishings from Pottsdamer's home are in the FAMU Black Archives.\nBel Air: A long-gone hideaway from yellow fever\nBel Air was a community established in 1841 about six miles south of Tallahassee because of the yellow fever epidemic that enveloped the city. The open pine woods and breezes were believed to provide a more healthy climate. Bel Air, also spelled Bel Aire and Bellair, remained a resort community for the socially prominent and wealthy until the end of the Civil War.\nNo signs remain today of the community, which local historians Joe Knetsch and Claude Kenneson believe was probably located near today's Flea Market on Capital Circle SW, just west of the Woodville Highway.\nThe Bel Air Road remained the name for the main highway south from Tallahassee into the 20th century. It ran along the path of Woodville Highway and paralleled the St. Marks Railroad (today's St. Marks bike trail). Local historian Mary Cathrin May believes Bel Air Road originally began at the Tallahassee railroad depot and ran south along today's Wahnish Way to the Woodville Highway.\nBy 1885, Adams Street had been extended south to Four Points and the Woodville Highway, and became the northern end of the Bel Air Road.\nTwo roads named for developer T.S. Green\nGreen Street in Levy Park, as well as T.S. Green Road in Miccosukee, are named for Thomas Sherrill Green, a Tallahassee real estate developer in the 1920s and 1930s.\nGreen owned land all over Tallahassee and developed several neighborhoods. Starting in 1925, he developed the Sunniland neighborhood (now subsumed into the Levy Park neighborhood), which is bounded by Seventh Avenue, Milton Street, 10th Avenue and M.L. King Boulevard. He named the street between Milton and M.L. King for himself.\nGreen was a native of Mt. Gilead, N.C., who lived from 1906 to 1929 in Miccosukee, where he operated a general store and produce warehouse beside the railroad.\nIn 1937, he and his wife, Velva, built an impressive, two story brick home at 228 E. Tharpe St., overlooking Lake Ella. The Greens had three sons. Velva Green died in 1971; T.S. Green died in 1974 at age 96.\nAll Saints Neighborhood: Holy rolling on Gaines street\nThe streets in this neighborhood between Gaines Street and the railroad once all bore names of saints — and there is only speculation about why they were so named.\nOne theory holds they were named by Irish laborers who helped build the adjacent railroad in the 1850s and may have settled in the area. Another theory is they were named by George K. Walker, who developed the area in the 1880s.\nThree of the saints' names remain: St. Francis, St. Michaels and All Saints streets. But originally, modern-day Duval Street (St. Peter's), Bronough Street (St. James) and Railroad Avenue (St. Patrick's) also bore saints' names for the portions of them between Gaines and the railroad tracks.\nThe once-fading neighborhood is experiencing a wave of new buildings and businesses.\nWahnish Way: A Jewish pioneer and tobacco tycoon\nThe main drag through the Florida A&M University campus, originally called Railroad Avenue, was named in 1966 for Sam Wahnish, a city commissioner (1938-1941) and civic leader.\nWahnish was a member of one of Tallahassee's pioneer Jewish families, and his father, Abraham Wahnish, was a prominent tobacco farmer and cigar manufacturer.\nSam Wahnish served five years as vice president of Wahnish and Sons Cigar Factory before spending 45 years in the state comptroller's office.\nThe two-story cigar factory, built in 1905 is still standing on St. Francis Street, and has been a lighting company and nightclub and was once targeted to be a museum. In 1971, the Railroad Avenue name was restored to a portion of Wahnish Way from Madison Street to FAMU Way.\nSam Wahnish died in 1976. The road bearing his name was changed this year to honor FAMU tennis star Althea Gibson. The city is looking for other ways to honor him.\nOx Bottom Road: Lost livestock led to name\nThis road connects Thomasville Road and Meridian Road, and was built through a one-time rural area of farms and properties originally accessible only from Bannerman Road.\nIn 1950, W.J. and Sue Boynton bought a tract of 1,200 acres from Mrs. Alfred B. Maclay.\nThe Boyntons were told their property was known locally as \"the ox bottom\" because of a low-lying field (between the present-day Ox Bow Circle and Evening Star Lane) where lost oxen were often found back when fields were plowed by oxen. The bottom was filled with maiden cane, a nutritious native plant that oxen loved to eat.\nThe Boyntons, who raised cattle, called their property Ox Bottom Ranch. In 1967, the Boyntons and other property owners deeded land for the road to Leon County, which named it Ox Bottom Road.\nFlagg Street honors jeweler, one-term mayor\nFlagg Street, off the Woodville Highway, is named for Francis Hopkins Flagg, the founder of the summer community of Bel Air. The community, on the east side of Woodville Highway, just north of Capital Circle Southeast, was located in the area of Flagg Street. Bel Air was a retreat for well-to-do Tallahassee families in the mid-19th century.\nFlagg was a jeweler from Massachusetts who came to Tallahassee in 1838 and opened a watch shop on Monroe Street. In 1847, Flagg won $2,000 in the Louisiana lottery. With his winnings, he bought a home at 323 E. Park Ave., from R.A. Shine, one of the city's leading early builders.\nIn 1848, Flagg was elected to a one-year term as mayor; he was later a member of the city council (1865-1870) and secretary-treasurer of the local railroad. Flagg died in 1872 and the home was sold.\nBut in 1894, the home was bought by Simeon Chittenden for his son, after his marriage to Francis Flagg's granddaughter — bringing the home full circle. The Chittenden family still owned the home, which has been restored, on the southeast corner of Park Avenue and Gadsden Street.\nLonnbladh Road gets name from Los Robles developer\nLonnbladh Road in northeast Tallahassee is named for Leon Lonnbladh, the co-developer of the Los Robles subdivision at Thomasville and Meridian Roads. Lonnbladh was born in 1877 in Sweden.\nA civil engineer, he moved to the United States in 1901 and worked for several railroad companies. He came to Tallahassee in 1924 to survey a new railroad to Tampa. When that project failed, Lonnbladh remained in Tallahassee and became a land developer.\nLonnbladh and Albert Thornton developed the Mediterranean-themed Los Robles (\"The Oaks\") in 1926, just before the collapse of the Florida land boom. Only eight buildings were constructed in Los Robles before 1930 and only four structures were built in the Mediterranean style, including the still extant entrance gate and the Tallahassee Woman's Club.\nLonnbladh also owned land near Welaunee Plantation — where the road named for him was deeded to the county in 1938. Lonnbladh died in 1952 in his Los Robles home at 246 DeSoto St.\nMacomb Street: Former judge opened first Capitol, launched Fourth of July party\nThis one-time main drag of the Black Frenchtown community is named for David Macomb, one of Tallahassee's early prominent white residents.\nA native of Michigan, Macomb came to Tallahassee at its founding in 1824. He organized the city's first Fourth of July celebration in 1826 and that same year delivered the main speech at the completion of the first Capitol building.\nHe was one of the founders of St.John's Episcopal Church in 1829 and one of Leon County's first county judges.\nHe infamously fought a Tallahassee duel against Prince Achille Murat, in which he shot off half of the prince's little finger. Macomb died in 1837.\nHis son, David Jr., was a U.S. Navy admiral for whom a World War II ship was named.\nCampbell Park named for prominent Black physician\nCampbell Pond Park, at the end of Shoreline Drive off the Woodville Highway, is named for Alpha Omega Campbell, a prominent Black physician in 20th century Tallahassee.\nCampbell was a Gadsden County native, who treated white and Black people and operated a private hospital for African Americans on W. Virginia Street (near its intersection with M.L. King Boulevard). Campbell's prosperity allowed him to acquire a large swath of land near the present-day park.\nThe southside streets of Alpha, Omega, Zillah and Gaile are named for the doctor, a daughter and a granddaughter — and numerous babies he delivered in Tallahassee were named for him.\nIn 1955, Campbell was indicted in the death of a white woman who had an illegal abortion. Though Campbell insisted the woman came to him only for treatment after her abortion was botched by a white doctor, he was convicted of manslaughter, sent to prison for four years and had his medical license revoked. After prison, his efforts to have his medical license re-instated were unsuccessful.\nCampbell died in 1971. The city purchased the land for the park in 1981.\nPalmer Munroe Teen Center named for late city official\nThe Palmer Munroe Teen Center on Jackson Bluff Road is named for the late assistant city manager, Palmer \"Doc\" Munroe. A native of Tallahassee, nicknamed for a local physician named Palmer, Munroe was the brother of Ivan Munroe, one of the city's early aviators for whom the Tallahassee Regional Airport terminal is named.\nPalmer Munroe began his career with the city in 1928, rising from meter reader to city cashier to assistant city manager under City Manager Arvah Hopkins. As assistant city manager for 10 years, Munroe was famous for his round-the-clock availability to citizens, especially those in underprivileged neighborhoods. Munroe died in September 1963 at age 55 of complications from diabetes. Construction had just begun on the Westside Community Center, which was renamed in his honor when it opened in February 1964.\nThe community center closed in 2009 because of city budget cuts, then reopened in 2010 as Tallahassee's first teen center, funded by the state and county. \"My dad would be so happy that his namesake is being used in the way it's being used,\" said Munroe's daughter Anne Williamson-Vinson.\nLipona: A made-up name for Murat's plantation\nThis is one of four westside streets near Florida State University named in honor of Prince Achille Murat and Princess Catherine Murat.\nThe nephew of Napoleon lived for 22 years on a plantation in Jefferson County that he named Lipona. After his death, his widow lived in a westside Tallahassee home she called Belle Vue (\"beautiful view\").\nThe names of three of the streets are self-explanatory: Prince, Murat and Belle Vue.\nBut Lipona is a made-up name.\nMurat was the Prince of Naples (Italy), which is spelled \"Napoli\" in Italian. The prince simply created an anagram of Napoli for the name of his American plantation: Lipona.\nNugent Drive named for wife of FSU football coach\nTwo eastside residential streets, Margaret Court and Nugent Drive, are named for the wife of Florida State football coach Tom Nugent — who coached FSU in its first game against the University of Florida.\nThe Nugents had nine children: When Peg Nugent gave birth to her last child in 1958, developer Syde Deeb named two streets behind the old Tallahassee Democrat building in her honor.\nTom Nugent was famed as a coaching innovator during stops at Virginia Military Institute, FSU and Maryland, as he created the I-formation and other offensive concepts still used today.\nNugent, whose FSU players included Lee Corso and Burt Reynolds, was coach and athletic director for FSU from 1953-1958. The charismatic Nugent led the still-young program to marquee victories over Tennessee and Miami and was a leading advocate for an annual game against Florida. The first meeting was Nov. 22, 1958. Though FSU scored a touchdown on its opening drive, Florida won 21-7.\nThe Nugents, married 61 years, spent their final years in Tallahassee. Peg died in 2002; Tom died in 2006.\nWaldo Palmer Lane named for late local veterinarian\nWaldo Palmer Lane, off Mahan Drive near the Florida Sheriffs Association, is named for the late Tallahassee veterinarian Waldo Palmer.\nA native of Camilla, Ga., Palmer earned two degrees at the University of Georgia. He worked as a veterinarian at a Miami horse racing track before moving to Tallahassee in 1952.\nHe and veterinarian Paul Vickers operated an animal clinic on South Monroe Street, until Palmer opened Palmer Animal Hospital in an old home on six acres off Mahan Drive in 1961. Palmer operated the clinic until his death of cancer at age 52 in 1979.\nIn the mid-1990s, his widow, Sharon Palmer (sister-in-law of Tallahassee entrepreneur DeVoe Moore), and their four children developed the property, naming the entrance road for their husband/father. The property includes the defunct Atlantis restaurant, a prosthetics company, two office buildings — and an animal hospital that operated in Palmer's original building.\nEarly Spanish explorers dubbed island Saint George\nThe barrier island 80 miles southwest of Tallahassee known as Saint George has been drawing beachgoers since long before there was a Fourth of July holiday. It was named San George by early Spanish explorers, with the expedition of Panfilo Narvaez probably the first Europeans to set foot on the island.\nThe island was 28 miles long until 1957, when it was divided by the dredging of the Bob Sikes Cut to allow quicker passage of ships from Apalachicola to open ocean. The resulting 9-mile western Little St. George is uninhabited; the 19-mile eastern Big St. George is a vacation retreat that includes a 9-mile-long state park.\nThe island was reachable only by boat until 1965, when a toll bridge-and-causeway was built from Eastpoint (the $2 toll was dropped in 1992 after the bridge was paid off). In 2004, the bridge-and-causeway were replaced by a 4.1 mile bridge. In 2008, the historic lighthouse on Little St. George was dismantled and rebuilt in the center of the main St. George Island.\nBrevard: The last Confederate general who got a street, county name\nBrevard Street, the long east-west street that runs past the Governor's Mansion and The Grove, is named for one of Tallahassee's most distinguished 19th-century families.\nTheodore Washington Brevard, a North Carolina native, came to Florida in 1847 and was state comptroller from 1853-1861. Brevard County in Central Florida is named for him.\nHis son, Theodore Washington Brevard Jr., was a Tallahassee attorney, state legislator and state inspector general. He was the last Confederate officer promoted to general during the Civil War, and was captured by Union Gen. George Armstrong Custer in the waning days of the war.\nBrevard Jr., who died in 1882, was married to the daughter of Florida territorial governor Richard Keith Call, who built The Grove. Brevard Jr. was the father of Caroline Brevard, for whom a Tallahassee elementary school is named.\nFlastacowo Road: A phonetic abbreviation for FSU lakefront\nModern generations of FSU students must assume that it's some kind of Native American name that identifies the road off Lake Bradford Road that leads to the Seminole Reservation.\nBut Flastacowo Road is actually a phonetic abbreviation for Florida State College for Women, which was what Florida State University was called from 1909 to 1947, before it became a co-ed school.\nIt was a popular name at FSCW, which used it for the Seminole Reservation, the yearbook and the numerous alumni clubs started by female grads before the switch to a co-ed university.\nSealey Elementary was named after a Leon principal\nThe Sealey Elementary Math and Science Magnet School, on Allen Road near the Tallahassee Mall, was originally at 234 E. Seventh Ave. — now the home of the Tallahassee Police Department. The school opened in 1930 as Sealey Memorial Elementary and commemorated Romero Mitchell Sealey.\nSealey had been a school principal in Fort Myers before coming to Tallahassee, where he was a Leon High principal, state schools inspector and secretary of the Florida Education Association.\nSealey, 39, died from a stroke in 1928 while traveling by train to a national education conference in Boston. Sealey was succeeded as FEA Secretary by James S. Rickards (for whom a Tallahassee high school was later named).\nSealey Memorial ceased operations at its original location after the 1969-1970 school year and opened at its current site in fall 1970. The Seventh Avenue building was remodeled and opened as TPD headquarters in 1972.\nWhat's in a name? The historic figures and educators behind Leon County school names\nDorman Hall honors popular professor, dean\nDorman Hall at Florida State University was named for a popular professor and dean in the final years of FSU's existence as a woman's college.\nOlivia Dorman came to Florida State College for Women as a classics professor in 1924. A native of Alabama, she earned her undergraduate degree at Randolph Macon Woman's College, then earned her master's and Ph.D. at the University of Chicago. She soon became chair of the department.\nIn 1925, the hugely popular Sarah Landrum Cawthon, FSCW's first Dean of the College Home, resigned because of poor health. Her two immediate successors proved wildly unpopular as they ended numerous FSCW rituals and traditions. In 1934, Dorman was appointed to the position renamed Dean of Students.\nDorman oversaw a great modernization of FSCW social rules, while supporting many traditions. Under Dorman, rules on smoking, riding in cars and dating were relaxed. The housing program was reorganized, a counseling program begun and the synchronized swimming Tarpon Club was founded.\nBut with the arrival of male students in 1946, Dorman was unable to enforce many of FSCW's longstanding policies. In 1947, a month after FSCW officially became the co-ed Florida State University, she resigned to return as head of the classics department. She retired in 1949 and died in Tallahassee in 1958 at age 66.\nIn 1959, the newly constructed Dorman Hall on West Jefferson Street was named for her. After a new Dorman Hall complex opened nearby in 2015, the old Dorman Hall was demolished.\nFAMU library named for postman alumnus\nFlorida A&M University's Coleman Library is named for a former president of the FAMU alumni association — and Tallahassee postman who was killed in a car accident shortly before the library opened in 1949.\nSamuel Harrison Coleman graduated from FAMU in 1906. He was a longtime member of the FAMU alumni association, serving many years as president of the organization. He also spent 40 years as a Tallahassee mail carrier.\nOn Feb. 9, 1948, Coleman was crossing the 400 block of West Brevard Street at night, when he was struck by a car driven by a Florida State University student, John H. Leonard. Coleman suffered a concussion, broken leg and other injuries and died nine days later. He was 63.\nLeonard, from Milton, had been a B-24 pilot in World War II and was driving a car he borrowed from his aunt. Leonard, driving west on Brevard Street, said he was blinded by the lights of an eastbound car that pulled out from curb and said he didn't see Coleman until he was just 20 feet from the man. State attorney William Hopkins declined to press charges.\nA month later, FAMU President William Gray announced the school's under-construction library would be named for Coleman. The $425,000 library opened Jan. 16, 1949. It was the first building on the FAMU campus to bear the name of an alumnus.\nTucker Hall named for FAMU's first president\nTucker Hall, the former home of Florida A&M's College of Journalism and Graphic Arts, is named for the university's first president.\nThomas DeSaille Tucker was born in 1844 in Sierra Leone; his mother was the daughter of an African chief and his father was an Englishman. At 12, Tucker was brought to the United States by a Methodist missionary. He earned a degree from Oberlin College in 1865 and taught school in Kentucky and Louisiana, before opening a law practice in 1882 in Pensacola.\nIn 1887, he accepted the post as president of the new Florida State Normal College for Colored Students. The school opened with 15 students in a single building on the site of today's Florida State University. Tucker and former Florida legislator Thomas Gibbs were the only instructors, charged with training Black school teachers. Under Tucker, the school grew to more than 200 students and eight buildings on its current site south of downtown.\nTucker resigned in 1901 following disputes over the direction of the school and his ill health. He practiced law in Baltimore before dying in 1903. Tucker Hall housed FAMU's journalism school from 1977 to 2005, when the college moved into an adjacent new building. Tucker Hall is now home to the College of Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities and the Charles Winterwood Theater.\nEfferson Street honors FAMU dean\nEfferson Street, a one-block long residential street off Gibbs Drive, is named for H. Manning Efferson, a one-time dean and interim president at Florida A&M University.\nEfferson was a native of South Carolina who earned a master's degree from Columbia and came to FAMU as a math instructor in 1924. Efferson went on to serve as head of the math department, dean of liberal arts and dean of students before being tapped as interim president from July 1949 to April 1950, between the presidencies of William Gray and George Gore.\nDuring his presidency, Efferson oversaw numerous construction projects, including completion of the former FAMU Hospital. In 1950, Gore appointed Efferson the first FAMU Dean of Administration. In 1954, the Pine Lumber construction company developed the Gore subdivision off Gibbs Drive just south of Tharpe Street. The company named the subdivision for the FAMU president, Gore, and its main street for Efferson. Efferson retired from FAMU in the early 1960s and died in 1972; FAMU named its student union building for him in 1975.\nEfferson's daughter, Victoria Efferson Warner, was a prominent Tallahassee social worker, community activist and FAMU professor who founded the university's School of Social Work. Warner died in 2006.\nSellers Street honors dairy farmer\nSellers Street, a short, dead-end street off Pontiac Drive, is named for the late Calvin Collis \"C.C.\" Sellers, a longtime Tallahassee dairy farmer.\nSellers operated a dairy farm from 1944 to 1954 that stretched from Paul Russell Road to Orange Avenue and included today's Leon County Fairgrounds. He and his wife, Mary, lived in a farmhouse that still stands at 1012 Paul Russell Road. In 1954, Sellers sold his land to Tallahassee developer Syde Deeb, who built the adjacent Apalachee Ridge Estates and paved a short street behind the farmhouse, which he named in Sellers' honor.\nSellers then moved his dairy farm to a 700-acre farm near Lake Jackson, operating it until the early 1980s. That farm, stretching from Old Bainbridge Road to North Monroe Street, encompassed today's Edinburgh Estates, View Pointe subdivision and Canopy Oaks Elementary School — and Sellers' two-story brick home was surrounded by the under-construction Arbor Landing apartment complex and set for demolition.\nSellers died in 1983; his wife of 47 years, Mary, is 97.\nWade Wehunt was city's director of pools\nWade Wehunt Pool in Myers Park is named for Wade Harrison Wehunt, the first director of city pools.\nWehunt, a native of Tate, Ga., came to Tallahassee in 1923. He was a real estate developer, who in 1929 built one of the early homes in Myers Park neighborhood (527 Oakland St.). He was hired in 1952 to oversee construction of the city's first three municipal pools, two for whites and one for Black residents.\nAfter completion of the pools at Myers Park, Levy Park and Griffin Heights in 1953, Wehunt was named director of city pools. Wehunt initiated the first swimming lessons and first water safety classes and spent 20 years as director of the local Red Cross. He served as a city elections inspector in the 1930s and 1940s and spent more than 20 years as manager of the Elks Club (then on North Monroe Street where the Tennyson condominiums are today), where he was active in downtown affairs.\nThe Myers Park pool was named for Wehunt upon his retirement in 1968. He died in 1985.\nGallows Hill: Where FSU presidents reign from Westcott\nFlorida State University's Westcott Hall Administration Building, at College Avenue and Copeland Street, is built on a site once known as Gallows Hill.\nThe name stems from the fall of 1829 or 1830, following what is believed to be Tallahassee's second murder, when an unidentified Black woman was convicted of killing her baby and sentenced to die. The hill where Westcott is located was chosen as the site for the gallows and the woman was hanged there.\nThe site was used for subsequent executions until 1854, when Tallahassee mayor Francis Eppes built a male academy on the site as an inducement to legislators.\nIn 1851, the legislature had established two seminaries in Florida, on the east and west sides of the Suwannee River. Several cities vied to be homes to the seminaries: In 1857, FSU won out over Marianna and Quincy and opened its doors as West Florida Seminary — in the building on Gallows Hill — becoming the forerunner of today's Florida State University.\nCity's 'seven hills' just a legend\nIt is a local legend that Tallahassee was built on seven hills. That's why Seven Hills is a common Tallahassee descriptive name: Six current local businesses have Seven Hills in their name.\nBut it's a fiction: Tallahassee has far more than seven hills and none of them were ever identified as key to the city's location.\nSome modern-day observers say \"Seven Hills\" was a conceit several hilly American cities adopted in tribute to Rome, which famously was founded on seven hills. Territorial Gov. William DuVal even named his Myers Park estate \"Mount Aventine,\" after one of those Roman hills.\nIn 1997, Tallahassee Democrat reporter Jan Pudlow talked to city officials to identify the seven tallest hills in city limits: Goodwood Plantation (216 feet), Old Fort Park (212), Mission San Luis (208 feet), Old Capitol (207 feet), The Grove (204 feet), FAMU's Lee Hall (192 feet) and FSU's Westcott Hall (176 feet).\nEd Young, research supervisor for the Tallahassee-Leon County Planning Department, confirmed those remain the seven highest points in city limits — but noted there are numerous areas in northern Leon County with elevations as high as 248 feet. The National Weather Service lists Tallahassee's average elevation as 197 feet.\nOrr Drive named for FAMU professor killed in WWII\nOrr Drive, on the campus of Florida A&M University, is named for Herbert Roy Orr, a professor who died in World War II. The street runs south off Robert and Trudie Perkins Way, between the School of Journalism and Graphic Communications and Tucker Hall.\nOrr was born in 1909 in Washington, D.C. He earned a bachelor's and master's degree from Howard University, where he participated in ROTC. He was hired at FAMU in 1936 and taught mechanical drawing and radio communications.\nHe joined the Army in 1943, became a captain in the U.S. Signal Corps and fought at Guadalcanal. He died in April 1944 at age 35 and is buried in a national memorial cemetery in Hawaii.\nIn 1938, he married fellow FAMU instructor, Ruth Bates. Ruth Bates Orr, who never remarried after her husband's death, taught 18 years at FAMU Developmental Research School and then many years in the Leon County school system. She died in 1989.\nRuth Bates Orr's niece is Carriemae Marquess, a retired FAMU food and nutrition professor (1946-1989), who was selected one of the top 100 FAMUANs of the 20th century. Marquess continues to live in the home near the FAMU campus that her aunt built shortly after World War II.\nCalhoun Street honors senator and two-time vice president\nCalhoun Street is named for John C. Calhoun, the 19th century statesman who played a role in Florida becoming part of the United States. Calhoun was a U.S. Senator from South Carolina and served as U.S. Vice President under two presidents, John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson.\nIn 1818, while Secretary of War for President James Monroe, Calhoun approved Jackson's invasion of Florida because of threats posed by Native Americans and runaway slaves. Jackson's incursion became the First Seminole War, and led to Spain selling Florida to the United States — though Calhoun later criticized Jackson for over-stepping his authority. Calhoun began his political career as a pro-Union supporter, but became famed for his defense of states rights, nullification and slavery as a \"positive good.\"\nNorth Calhoun Street has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1979 for its 16 historic buildings. Calhoun Street was once mostly residential and lined with stately oak trees. The cutting of several oaks on Calhoun Street in 1940 led to public protest and the \"Live Oak Trail,\" a driving tour of Tallahassee trees. In 1955, Calhoun (southbound) and Gadsden Street (northbound) became Tallahassee's first paired, one-way streets.\nMcLean Park named for former city commissioner\nJack McLean Jr. Park is named for a former Tallahassee City Commissioner who was instrumental in the city's purchase of the property in 1985. McLean was a city commissioner from 1984 to 1992.\nMcLean later became city attorney for Quincy and since 2008 has been Quincy City Manager. A native of North Carolina, who earned his law degree at FSU, McLean spent 17 years (1977-1994) as head of Legal Services of North Florida before beginning his political career.\nMcLean Park is set on a wooded, 52-acre tract along Paul Russell Road that was once the site of the John Barry Dairy. The dairy was purchased in the 1950s by developer Syde Deeb, who built the nearby Apalachee Ridge subdivision. Deeb gave the unused portion of the former dairy to the FSU Foundation, which sold the 52 acres to the city in 1985 for $425,000.\nSouthside Park opened in 1992, with hiking trails, ball fields and basketball courts. In 2004, a community center and two pools were added. The city commission renamed the park for McLean in 1998.\nGore led tumultuous era at FAMU\nThe Gore Education Complex at Florida A&M University, as well as nearby residential street, Gore Avenue, is named for former FAMU president George W. Gore.\nGeorge William Gore Jr., was FAMU president from 1950 to 1968, making him the second-longest serving FAMU president to J.R.E. Lee (1924-1944).\nGore, a native of Nashville, earned his bachelor's degree in English and journalism from DePauw, his master's from Harvard and his Ph.D. from Columbia. He joined the faculty of Tennessee A&I (today's Tennessee State University), where he became a pioneer Black journalism instructor, and spent 23 years as dean before he was hired at FAMU.\nGore directed a period of great growth at FAMU. More than 20 new buildings were constructed, including the FAMU Hospital (1950) and FAMU Developmental Research School (1957). Gore created FAMU's first university police force (1952), presided over the transition from Florida A&M College (FAMCEE, as it was called) to Florida A&M University (1953) and enrolled the first white student (James Van Matre, 1964).\nBut Gore's tenure is most remembered for the rise of student demonstrations. From the bus boycott (1956) to lunch counter sit-ins (1960) to theater protests (1963), FAMU students took a lead role in the Tallahassee civil rights movement. Under pressure from white officials, Gore discouraged political dissent by FAMU students and faculty but did not forbid it.\n\"He was not weak but cautious,\" said FAMU historian Leedell Neyland. \"Gore's strength was that while he was not active in civil rights leadership, he did not prevent his faculty and students from participating.\"\nAfter FAMU, Gore returned to Nashville, where he died in1982 at age 81.\nDoug Burnette Park\nThe little park on Gaines Street at Martin Luther King Boulevard used to be one of the city's most popular children's playgrounds.\nBuilt in 1938 by the Depression-era Works Progress Administration, the park was named for Doug Burnette, executive director of the regional Boy Scouts office and chairman of Tallahassee's first recreation board.\nThe park included a softball diamond, a basketball court, swings, seesaws and a tether-ball pole.\nThe playground equipment was removed in the 1980s. In 2008, the park was renovated with landscaping, benches and other improvements, including \"Quark,\" an 80-foot-tall, blue-painted steel piece by John Henry, a nationally renowned sculptor. The sculpture was later moved to the Orlando Museum of Art.\nDRS first named for Black educator\nFlorida A&M's Developmental Research School was once called Lucy Moten School, in honor of one of the leading Black educators of the early 20th century.\nLucy Moten was born in 1851 to a free Black couple in Washington, D.C. Educated in Massachusetts and Howard University, she was director for 37 years (1883-1920) of the Miner Normal School, a public teacher training institution for Black students in Washington, D.C.\nShe became nationally famous for her discipline and high educational standards, drawing Black prospective teachers from all over the nation. Moten, who never married, was killed after being struck by a taxi in New York's Times Square in 1933.\nFAMU president J.R.E. Lee, an associate of Moten, named FAMU's teacher-training school for Moten in 1932. In 1935, a new Lucy Moten School was constructed at then Gamble Street and M.L. King Boulevard. Lucy Moten School originally served grades one through eight (then the highest grade offered to Black students), then was used for elementary classes when the school expanded to grades K-12 and was called FAMU High.\nIn 2009, FAMU High moved to a new complex at Wahnish Way and Orange Avenue and assumed the name FAMU DRS — though the historic Lucy Moten School building is still used for university office space.\nWeems Road named for former cattle rancher\nWeems Road, a one-time rural road that connects Mahan Drive to Tom Brown Park, is named for George Emerson Weems, a former state official who had a cattle farm in the area.\nA native of Hillsboro, Tenn., and a graduate of the University of Arkansas, Weems moved to South Florida in 1914. He came to Tallahassee in 1933 as director of the newly created Milk Control Board, which regulated the state dairy industry (and was disbanded in 1969).\nFrom 1935 to 1937, he served as the second director of the state Beverage Commission, established to regulate the sale of alcohol after the end of Prohibition (now part of the Department of Business and Professional Regulation). After he left state government, Weems operated a cattle ranch and livestock market on Lake Lafayette.\nWeems died in 1958; his wife, Sally Hieronymous Weems, died in 1983 — the year Weems Road was annexed into the city.\nMuseum, school named for revered John Gilmore Riley\nThe school off Tharpe Street and the downtown museum are named for John Gilmore Riley, Tallahassee's most prominent early Black educator, community leader and businessman. Called Northwest Elementary when it opened in 1951, it was renamed for Riley a year after his death in 1954.\nRiley was born into slavery in 1857 and worked odd jobs until landing his first teaching position in 1877. A self-taught educator, he taught in Wakulla, Gadsden and Leon counties before spending 33 years (1893-1926) as principal of Tallahassee's all-Black Lincoln High.\nDespite never earning more than $100 a month as principal, Riley became one of Tallahassee's leading property owners and was revered for his leadership in the Black community.\nThe home he built in 1890 at 419 E. Jefferson is on the National Register of Historic Places and since 1997 has been the John G. Riley Center/African American Museum of History and Culture. (Feb. 6, 2012)\nGoodbody Lane has a Thomas Jefferson connection\nGoodbody Lane, a three-block connector street off East Park Avenue that borders the Florida Lottery, is named for Albert and Fannie Goodbody who once lived at the corner of Park Avenue and the dirt trail that became Goodbody Lane.\nAlbert George Goodbody was an English native, who served as a Tallahassee justice of the peace until his death in 1936. His wife, Fannie Maude Craig, was the great-great-granddaughter of U.S. President Thomas Jefferson and the granddaughter of Francis Eppes. Eppes was one of Tallahassee's early settlers, a longtime mayor and a founder of what became Florida State University.\nAs Frenchtown fades, mystery over name continues\nFrenchtown is the name for the former commercial and residential heart of Tallahassee's Black community.\nIt was bounded roughly by Brevard, Duval, Call and Dewey streets, around the axis of Macomb Street's stores, restaurants and nightclubs.\nLore long held it was named for French farmers sent to Tallahassee by the Marquis de Lafayette in 1831.\nSubsequent research revealed the farmers never actually came to Tallahassee. Frenchtown could have been named for Jourdan Frenchy, a mulatto carpenter who built many early houses there, or Frenchtown, N.J., site of an infamous War of 1812 massacre and stronghold of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, whose preachers often visited Tallahassee.\nAll but a handful of businesses have left Frenchtown, which is home to many new houses and apartments, plus the city's Renaissance Center.\nFading Frenchtown: Frenchtown fights to survive, preserve history as it's squeezed by student housing\nKillearn Estates: Where Scottish and Irish eyes smile on Tallahassee\nMost streets in Tallahassee's ground-breaking subdivision bear Irish names — even though Killearn is a village in Scotland. That dichotomy caused an early flap with the family who brought the name to Tallahassee.\nNew York financier Alfred Barmore Maclay bought a Leon County hunting plantation in 1923. Maclay planted thousands of plants on the plantation and renamed it Killearn Gardens in honor of his ancestral home in Scotland.\nIn 1953, his widow, Louise, donated the gardens to the state.\nIn 1964, Tallahassee native J.T. Williams began developing Killearn Estates — directly across Thomasville Road from Killearn Gardens State Park — and giving his streets Irish names.\nLouise Maclay was incensed and protested the Irish names. Ultimately, the gardens were renamed Maclay Gardens.\nWilliams, who went on to develop Killearn Acres, Killearn Lakes, Golden Eagle and five Georgia subdivisions, laughs: \"We always said we don't care if (the street names) are Irish or Scottish, if the check is made out correctly.\"\nHays Street: A name intertwined with history\nThis residential street that straddles Magnolia Drive from Belmont Drive to Oak Street, is named for Jesse Hays, who built the home on nearby Park Avenue that now houses the Florida Trust for Historic Preservation.\nHays came to Tallahassee at the turn of the 20th century to serve as manager of Tallahassee's first phone company; he was later a state inspector on engineering projects in the Everglades. In 1910, he and his wife, Sarah, built the Queen Anne style house at 906 E. Park Ave. Jesse Hays, who died in 1950, was an avid photographer and many of his photos of early Park Avenue are in the Florida Photographic Collection.\nIn 1949, son Harold Hays sold the home to Tallahassee insurance agent Buck Hood and his wife, Rebecca, who raised four children and lived in the home for nearly 60 years. Buck Hood died in 2002. Rebecca Hood sold the house to the historic trust in 2005 and died in 2009.\nSaxon Street named for Capital City Bank founder\nThis long residential street through a traditionally Black community adjoining Florida A&M University is named for one of Tallahassee's most prominent early white businessmen, George Washington Saxon.\nA native of Tallahassee whose education ended in grade school, Saxon began his business career as owner of a general store.\nIn 1889, he began a private bank in his store, and six years later (1895) he founded Capital City Bank, Tallahassee's oldest, continuously operating business.\nSaxon was a prosperous real estate developer throughout Tallahassee (he donated the land for the Florida Governor's Mansion) and the Big Bend. He was among the early developers of St. Teresa, Lanark Village and St. George Island, which he owned from 1910 to 1921.\nSaxon, who co-founded the first Tallahassee phone company in 1895, died in 1935. His numerous descendants include Tallahassee attorneys Duby Ausley and Palmer Proctor.\nEasterwood served on city and county commissions simultaneously\nEasterwood Drive, leading into Tom Brown Park, is named for Henry Grady Easterwood — the only person to serve on the Tallahassee City Commission and Leon County Commission at the same time. The choice is fitting: Tom Brown Park is owned by the county but operated by the city.\nEasterwood, born in 1900 in Alabama, moved to Tallahassee in 1930. He worked 16 years for the Seaboard Rail Line then became co-owner of a furniture store. He was elected to a five-year term on the city commission in 1950, when the city commission expanded from three members to five members.\nIn 1951, Easterwood was one of three city commissioners who tried unsuccessfully to sell the city-owned electric company to a private company; the trio also fired city manager Malcolm Yancey, replacing him with Arvah Hopkins.\nIn 1954, Easterwood was mayor when he won election to the county commission. Easterwood's term on the city commission ended a month after he took office on the county commission, allowing him to serve on both commissions. Don Price (city commission, 1974-75; county commission, 1986-1992) is the only other person to serve on both commissions.\nEasterwood served 11 years on the county commission, gaining attention for opposing the city's 1956 sale of Capital City Country Club to a private club to avoid racial integration. Easterwood died in office in 1966.\nOpperman named for first College of Music dean, who inadvertently helped start the Marching Chiefs\nFlorida State University's 442-seat recital hall, Opperman Music Hall, in the Kuersteiner Building, is named for Ella Scoble Opperman, who created the modern day College of Music.\nOpperman, born in 1873, was an accomplished pianist and organist, who earned degrees from Wesleyan College in Cincinnati and the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music. She spent three years abroad studying piano in Berlin and Paris before returning to teach music for many years at her alma mater.\nShe was hired as Director of Music at Florida State College for Women in 1911, and led the department from a program that conferred teaching certificates to a full degree granting program. In 1920, she was named the first dean of the College of Music and was considered one of the nation's leading music educators, before her retirement in 1944.\nOpperman opposed the first efforts to form the College of Music's now-signature marching band. In 1938, 39 female students formed the Tally Troopers to march at student events. Opperman insisted they disband because she said marching was not ladylike.\nTwo years later, students resurrected the group, adding musical instruments. Though Opperman and the College of Music did not recognize them officially, the group played at school functions.\nIn 1946, after she retired, marching band became a credited class in the College of Music. In 1950, after the school became co-ed, the band was named the Marching Chiefs.\nOpperman died at 95 on March 4, 1969 — the day of the infamous Night of the Bayonets, when armed Leon County sheriff's deputies lined Tennessee Street during a Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) protest at the FSU Student Union.\nAdams Street named for John Quincy Adams almost was Palm Avenue\nOne of Tallahassee's oldest and main streets is named for the sixth U.S. President, John Quincy Adams.\nAdams was President James Monroe's Secretary of State when Tallahassee was founded in 1824 and the city's two main thoroughfares were named for them. As Secretary of State, Adams negotiated the purchase of Florida from Spain in 1819.\nAdams succeeded Monroe as president in 1825, when he became the only U.S. President elected by the House of Representatives because none of the candidates won a majority of electoral votes. Adams was defeated for a second term.\nAdams Street was once lined with businesses and homes, as the street ran south from the Governor's Mansion, past the Capitol and south to the coast. All four Tallahassee City Hall buildings have been on Adams Street. The original police and fire stations and Tallahassee Democrat were on Adams.\nIn 1921, at the urging of Tallahassee Democrat editor Milton Smith, the city commission approved planting palm trees on Adams Street from the Capitol to the Governor's Mansion – and renaming the street Palm Avenue. Smith promoted the plan as Tallahassee's version of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C. Although numerous palm trees were planted, city commissioners abandoned the plan to rename the street in 1922, citing a desire to continue honoring John Quincy Adams.\nSince 1927, Adams Street has served as the east-west dividing line for all addresses in Tallahassee.\nIn September 1972, Adams Street was permanently closed at Pensacola Street, as the new capitol was built on what had been Adams Street, ending its days as a main thoroughfare.\nRuby Diamond Auditorium named for FSU benefactor\nRuby Pearl Diamond was a Tallahassee native, who graduated from the newly created Florida State College for Women in 1905 — one of 13 graduates who made up the last co-ed class of the university until 1947.\nShe lived for 50 years in the Floridan Hotel on the corner of Call and Monroe streets (now the site of the Aloft Hotel). A longtime benefactor of FSU, she donated $100,000 in land to FSU in 1970, which named its auditorium in Westcott Hall for her — which was fitting as it was Diamond who, in 1936, suggested naming the school's administration building for Tallahassee native James Westcott.\nThe auditorium, originally built in 1911 and rebuilt in 1954, was closed for renovations in 2008. It reopened with a concert by blues great B.B. King.\nRuby Diamond died in 1982 at age 95.\nBull Headley Road named for pioneer of Killearn Lakes\nBull Headley Road, off Bannerman Road in northern Leon County, is named for Julien Christian \"Bull\" Headley, who once owned the 4,000-acre plantation that became the Killearn Lakes and Golden Eagle subdivisions.\nHeadley, born in Mississippi and raised in Kentucky, came to Tallahassee in 1946 to raise cattle and timber. In 1951, he bought Water Oak Plantation on the south shore of Lake Iamonia, renamed it Bull Run Plantation and built a home.\nIn 1952, Headley deeded a dirt road along the boundary of his property from Bannerman Road to Lake Iamonia to Leon County. The county named the road Bull Headley Road, though it was not paved until 1982.\nThough generations of Tallahasseeans have pronounced the road as Bull HED-ley Road, the family pronounces its last name HEED-ley. Headley had five children with two wives; two of his daughters, Jill Poole and Kirk Headley-Perdue, still live in Tallahassee.\nIn 1964, Headley sold Bull Run to a group of Louisiana investors, who renamed it Kinhega Lodge and turned into a hunting preserve. In 1985, the investors sold the plantation to Killearn Estates developer J.T. Williams, who developed Killearn Lakes.\nKinhega, the name of a Miccosukee chief, is still used for the home that Headley built and for one of the two main roads in Killearn Lakes.\nIn 1959, Headley bought property in British Honduras, now Belize, where he raised cattle and timber on 18,000 acres. In 1962, he moved to Bermuda and split his time between Belize and Bermuda; Headley gave up his U.S. citizenship in 1972.\nAn inveterate entrepreneur who dabbled in many enterprises, Headley converted part of his Belize property to a resort in the late 1980s. Called Hidden Valley Inn, it had numerous waterfalls, including Belize's famous 1,000-foot Falls.\nIn 2001, Headley traded the waterfalls to Belize for more timberland. The waterfalls are now a national park.\nHeadley, the youngest of four boys, gained his nickname as a toddler, when a cow chased him and he ran into the house screaming he was being chased by a \"Bull.\"\n\"Never was a nickname so fitting,\" said George Headley, the youngest of Headley's five children.\nHeadley died in Belize in 2003 at age 87.\nBeard Street named for Welaunee Planation owner's granddaugher\nBeard Street, a residential street by Lafayette Park, is named for Letitia Beard – granddaughter of one of Leon County's early prominent residents, Robert Gamble.\nLetitia Beard owned 70 acres off North Gadsden Street between Sixth Avenue and Williams Street; the property had been part of the Lafayette Land Grant. In 1914, she sold the property to local developers, including Dr. Kent Johnston, who founded Tallahassee's first hospital on North Gadsden Street. Part of the property was developed as Meridian Heights subdivision (with a portion later donated for Lafayette Park).\nRobert and John Gamble were were prominent merchants in Virginia. Their father, Robert, was a Revolutionary War hero; their mother was Letitia Breckenridge, daughter of a Revolutionary War general. She turned down a marriage proposal from explorer Meriwether Lewis to marry Robert Gamble.\nIn 1826, John Gamble moved to Florida and established Waukeenah Plantation in Jefferson County; a year later, Robert Gamble, bought adjoining property and established Welaunee Plantation in Jefferson County.\nThe brothers later moved to Tallahasseee, while continuing to operate their Jefferson County plantations. John Gamble was the founder of the Union Bank, with Robert Gamble serving on the board.\nOne of Robert Gamble's sons, Robert Howard Gamble, served as Florida comptroller after the Civil War. One of John Gamble's sons, also named Robert, established a plantation in Manatee County, which is now a state park.\nLetitia Beard, named for her grandmother, was married to William Kelly Beard. Letitia Beard, 84, died in 1921 and is buried in Tallahassee's St. John's Episcopal cemetery.\nPond covers Coal Chute Park\nA stormwater treatment pond built for the FAMU Way extension now covers the original Coal Chute Park — a historic longtime Black community park.\nThe four-acre pond is at the west end of Railroad Square arts district, south of the adjacent railroad tracks.\nThe park was originally known as Villa Mitchell Park, the name of the surrounding community. The original park had basketball goals and playground equipment. Children in the neighborhood played softball, basketball and football in the park, and it was used for community events.\nIn 1994, the city bought the park, fenced it off, installed new playground equipment and named it Coal Chute Park. Legend holds the area, once part of a sawmill, was where train locomotives stopped to take on water and coal – which was delivered through a chute.\nThe park was dismantled in 2011 as it and nearby properties were bought for right of way of the FAMU Way extension. Construction of the pond was completed late last year.\nVilla Mitchell was the name of a suburban community developed in 1886 by C.L. Mitchell. It was bordered by Railroad Avenue, Gamble Street and the railroad in the large curve of the railroad before it crosses Lake Bradford Road. The streets were named for prominent figures of the day (President Grover Cleveland, Florida Gov. Edward Perry, Everglades developer Hamilton Disston). The neighborhood prospered for about 20 years. In 1891, Florida A&M moved to its current home on a hill above Villa Mitchell and the neighborhood became a Black residential area.\nOnce FAMU Way was completed, the park was paired with the Capital Cascades Trail, a pedestrian/biking path. The trail came to include a children's play area just east of the stormwater pond — replacing Coal Chute Park.\nApalachee Parkway named through a contest for original inhabitants\nThe Apalachee Parkway pays tribute to the first inhabitants of this area — and is the genesis of the names of the nearby city of Apalachicola and the Appalachian Mountains.\nThe Apalachee people occupied the area between the Aucilla and Ochlockonee rivers from the 1100s to 1700s. Famed as farmers and warriors, they were first encountered by Europeans during the expeditions of Spanish explorers Panfilo Narvaez and Hernando de Soto in the 1500s. The Apalachees lived with the Spanish at Mission San Luis from 1656 to 1704, before dispersing to Louisiana, where about 300 Apalachee descendants remain today.\nThe name Apalachee, from the Creek and Hitachi languages, has several interpretations. One interpretation is \"apalchi\" means \"allies.\" Another holds it means \"torch bearers\" or \"those who bring light.\" A third interpretation is \"apalahchi,\" means \"on the other side.\" The name Apalachicola joins \"apalahchi\" (other side) and \"okli\" (people), for \"people who lived on the other side\" of what is now the Apalachicola River.\nReports from the Narvaez and DeSoto expeditions indicated the Apalachee ranged as far north as the Appalachian Mountains, 350 miles from Tallahassee. So as early as 1563, Spanish cartographers were labeling the mountain range in today's Georgia and North Carolina, the \"Apalachen Mountains.\"\nApalachee Parkway was named in 1957, after this newspaper sponsored a contest to name the newly constructed road. Tallahassee native Bill Yancey was one of seven people to submit \"Apalachee,\" winning the contest because his entry was the earliest postmarked.\nThe parkway passes through the area believed to be Anhaica, the chief village of the Apalachees. The site of de Soto's 1539-1540 winter encampment among the Apalachees is one block south of the parkway.\nTMH name salutes World Wars I and II casualties\nTallahassee Memorial Healthcare — which celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2023 — is named in tribute to those who died in World War I and World War II.\nThe city had limited medical facilities its first 125 years of existence: a church and a hotel during the Civil War; the Masonic Lodge for whites and a small clinic for Black people in the early 1900s; a private sanitarium on North Gadsden Street for white people (1924-1964); the FAMU Hospital for Black people (1950-1971).\nIn 1941, responding to a clamor from Tallahassee's then-17,000 residents, city fathers announced plans to secure grants and issue bonds to build a hospital. But after purchasing 15 acres east of downtown, the city's plans were put on hold by World War II.\nIn 1946, after the war, the Baptist Church began operating a hospital in the wooden barracks of an abandoned World War II military medical complex of Dale Mabry Field. But after struggling financially for two years, the church asked the city to take over the hospital.\nIn January 1948, armed with a $1.5 million federal grant, the city began construction on a five-story hospital at Magnolia Drive and Miccosukee Road. In April, 1948, the city took over operation of the Baptist Hospital at Dale Mabry Field, where it operated for 18 months.\nOn Nov. 4, 1949, Tallahassee Memorial Hospital opened as a municipally operated hospital. In 1976, the hospital converted to a private, non-profit corporation and changed its name to Tallahassee Memorial Regional Medical Center (TMRMC).\nIn 1998, for its 50th anniversary, TMRMC it restored its original TMH acronym by renaming itself Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare.\nCarroll house becomes a iconic restaurant trifecta\nTable 23 used to be the Front Porch restaurant and before that the former home of Chez Pierre Restaurant — though the tree-shrouded, two-story brick building at Thomasville Road and Sixth Avenue began life nearly 90 years ago as the home of Tallahassee businessman Fred Carroll.\nConstructed as a one-story home in 1924, it was rebuilt as a two-story home in 1935 following a storm.\nCarroll owned Capital City Ice Company, Capital City Bakeries, a Georgia fertilizer and peanut company and several parcels of local property. Carroll died in 1956 and his wife died in 1959. Son Fred Carroll Jr., and daughter Clara Jane Smith leased the building to a variety of businesses, including Bevis Funeral Home (1964-1968) and the Lt. Governor's Club (1993-1994) before selling it to Chez Pierre (1996-2012).\nThe two large oaks on the front lawn, the subject of some concern during remodeling efforts, were planted as saplings in 1936 after Thomasville Road construction had removed previous trees.\nLive Oak Plantation Road named after governor's property\nLive Oak Plantation Road, between Thomasville Road and Meridian Road, is named for the plantation established on its western end in the 19th century.\nMost of the plantation, which once stretched all the way to Lake Jackson, has been subdivided into home sites since the 1950s. Originally, Live Oak was the 10,000-acre plantation of John Branch, a governor and U.S. Senator from North Carolina.\nBranch moved to Tallahassee in the mid-1830s and served as sixth and last territorial governor before statehood in 1845. Branch's daughter married planter and merchant Arvah Hopkins, owner of Goodwood Plantation (and grandfather of the late longtime Tallahassee city manager Arvah Hopkins).\nAfter Branch, it passed through many owners, including Dr. Tennent Ronalds, a native of Scotland, who built one of Tallahassee's first golf courses on the property in 1903.\nRuediger Elementary honors former teacher\nLillian Ruediger Elementary School is named for a former Tallahassee school teacher and Leon County Schools administrator.\nLillian Josephine Cross Ruediger taught at Florida High before becoming general supervisor of Leon County Schools from 1945 to 1951. Ruediger, who oversaw elementary schools, resigned because of poor health and requested a transfer to a teaching position at Kate Sullivan Elementary. But Ruediger, 54, died at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital on Jan. 16, 1952 before she could resume her teaching career.\nRuediger (ROO-di-gher) Elementary at 526 W. 10th Ave. was named for her when it opened Sept. 6, 1955, the same day Griffin Middle School opened.\nRuediger was a native of Lake City, who enrolled at FSU in 1922 but did not graduate until 1930. She was married to Julius Ruediger, a longtime superintendent of the city's gas plant. Julius Ruediger died in 1958; his son, Herbert Ruediger, a longtime city employee, died in 1978.\nHouse built by Gov. John Martin marks site of earliest US Christmas\nThe chief structure at the De Soto site off East Lafayette Street — where Spaniards are believed to have celebrated the first Christmas (1539) in what became the United States — is the Gov. Martin House.\nThe brick, hunting lodge style home was built in 1934 by Florida Gov. John Wellborn Martin. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it is now home to the Florida Bureau of Archaeological Research.\nMartin, a former mayor of Jacksonville, was governor of Florida from 1925 to 1929, presiding over the height and end of the Florida land boom. He spearheaded state highway construction and successfully advocated for a change to the state constitution to allow state funding of public elementary schools. In 1925, a new State Road Department building was constructed and named for him at 300 S. Adams St. — a building that served as Tallahassee City Hall from 1964 to 1982 and is the site of the current City Hall.\nMartin ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate in 1928 and unsuccessfully for governor in 1932. Martin sold his Tallahassee property in 1941 and returned to Jacksonville, where he died in 1958.\nCobb named for principal\nTallahassee's first middle school, Cobb Middle School, is named for the first principal of its first elementary school: Elizabeth DeBerry Cobb.\nCobb was a native of Tallahassee who began teaching in 1915 at all-grades Leon High. In 1925, she became the first principal of Caroline Brevard Elementary, Tallahassee's first elementary-only school. In 1935, she became supervisor of Leon County Schools before leaving the school system in 1936.\nCobb went on to spend many years as house mother for the Ruge Episcopal Center at Florida State University and teach youth classes at St. John's Episcopal Church. In 1954, Cobb Junior High opened as Tallahassee's first junior high (now middle) school and was named for Cobb.\nWidowed before she was 30, and affectionately known as \"Bessie,\" Cobb lived most of her adult life in the Bradford-Cobb House at 403. N. Calhoun St. The home, in the Calhoun Street Historic District, was built in 1878-79. Cobb bought the home in 1921 and lived there until shortly before she died in 1974 at age 96. The home is now a law office.\nKate Sullivan was a teacher\nOne of Tallahassee's oldest elementary schools is named for Kate Sullivan, a beloved teacher in Tallahassee for 45 years.\nSullivan was a native of Tallahassee, who graduated from Florida State College, a forerunner of FSU. She taught many years at Caroline Brevard Elementary, the city's first elementary-only school, before retiring in spring 1948. In fall 1948, Kate Sullivan Elementary on Miccosukee Road and the now-defunct Wesson Elementary opened as the city's third and fourth elementary schools (after Caroline Brevard and Sealey Memorial).\nSullivan, who taught primarily English, was the favorite teacher of many students; a dozen prominent former pupils, including soon-to-be Gov. LeRoy Collins, were pallbearers at her 1953 funeral. Sullivan and her older sister, Mattie, neither of whom ever married, lived at 503 Beard Street.\nFurniture from their home is displayed at Goodwood Museum & Gardens. The glass-doored bookcase Kate Sullivan used in her Caroline Brevard classroom is at the library entrance of Kate Sullivan Elementary.\nChapman Pond named for Justice\nChapman Pond is the two-acre city park and pond at Merritt and Circle drives in the Myers Park neighborhood. It is named for former Florida Supreme Court Justice Roy H. Chapman, who once lived nearby.\nA native of Lake City, Chapman attended the University of Florida and Stetson Law School. He returned to Lake City and practiced law with Fred Cone, who later was elected the 27th governor of Florida (1937-1941). Cone nominated his law partner to the Supreme Court in 1937.\nChapman, who spent a term (1945-1947) as Chief Justice, served on the court until his death in 1952.\nIn the 19th century, Chapman Pond was one of three ponds on the Houstoun family's Lakeland Plantation. It was originally known as Wash Pond, because plantation slaves used it to do laundry.\nIt has also been known as Mosley Pond, DuVal Pond, Duck Pond and Sylvan Pond. It was named for Chapman on April 28, 1953.\nDorothy B. Oven Park\nThis seven-acre park on Thomasville Road just south of I-10 gained prominence in the 1930s as Camellia Gardens, one of the nation's largest commercial camellia nurseries.\nThe manor house was designed in 1936 by Alfred B. Maclay, creator of the nearby state park and gardens that bear his name. Maclay designed the house for Camellia Gardens co-owner Breckenridge Gamble, whose widow, Dorothy, married Tallahassee attorney Will Oven in 1960.\nUpon Dorothy's death in 1985, Will Oven donated the house and heavily landscaped grounds to the city of Tallahassee, with the provision it be named in honor of Dorothy B. Oven.\nA half-acre of the park houses a Tallahassee fire station. The house is used for meetings and weddings. The grounds attract thousands of residents at Christmas, when the park is decorated with holiday lights.\nCarroll's Quarters named for Black female owner\nThe term \"quarters\" to denote housing dates to the 16th century and was most often applied to military and servant lodgings. In the American South, it became the term for slave housing — and, after slavery, was still applied to clusters of Black homes.\nTallahassee had numerous \"quarters,\" including Gray's Quarters, Council Quarters, Henry Watson Quarters, Riley's Quarters and Collins Quarters. Some were named for the chief landlord of the quarters.\nOthers were named for the predominant Black landowner — such as Carroll's Quarters, in the area behind where Whole Foods Grocery replaced the Miracle Theater. Annie Carroll owned much of the still-residential neighborhood bordered by Thomasville Road, Pine Street, Ninth Avenue and Mitchell Street.\nOne of the landmarks of Carroll's Quarters was Oliver's Grocery at 1563 Pine Street, operated into the early 1970s by Alberta Oliver, grandaughter-in-law of Annie Carroll.\nThe cross street nearest the store is Gwen Street, named for Oliver's granddaughter. Alberta Oliver died in 2000; Gwen Oliver Parker, a TCC instructor, died in 2005. The former store was then used for storage by retired local football and track coach Billy Oliver, son of Alberta and father of Gwen.\nTrimble Road named for hardware store owner who pioneered neighborhood\nTrimble Road, which connects Tharpe Street and Hartsfield Road on Tallahassee's west side, is named for the late Jesse Trimble, a hardware store owner who built one of the first homes on the street.\nTrimble, a native of Sandy Springs, Ga., came to Tallahassee in 1920 and worked many years as a bookkeeper and insurance agent. In 1944, he became a partner in Ralph Johnson's Hardware at 121 E. Jefferson Street (now the site of the House Office Building). In 1946, the two men built a new store at 1315 N. Monroe.\nIn 1956, after Johnson's retirement, Trimble moved across the street to a building on the southwest corner of Monroe Street and Seventh Avenue. In 1959, Trimble retired and sold his store to Nick Eppes and Henry Edenfield, who operated Eppes-Edenfield Hardware until 1995.\nIn 1948, Trimble built a home on 10 acres of a former pecan grove. In more recent times, the county graded the dirt trail from Tharpe Street to Trimble's home — with country road foreman Aubry Ott naming it Trimble Road. Trimble died in 1979. Since 1965, Jesse Trimble Jr., a retired Leon County Schools custodian, lived in the home he built next door to his father.\nAppleyard Drive named for Confederate Navy man, newspaper owner\nThis westside thoroughfare that fronts now Tallahassee State College is named for Thomas Jefferson Appleyard, an early Tallahassee newspaper editor, printer and government official.\nT.J. Appleyard was secretary of the Florida Senate from 1895 to 1905. In 1909, he became the state printer and also published the weekly Florida Record newspaper. During the legislative sessions of 1913, 1915, 1917 and 1919, he published the Record as the daily Florida Morning News newspaper. In 1919, he sold his newspaper to the rival Tallahassee Democrat but continued to operate a printing company, which was sold after his death to the present-day Rose Printing Company.\nAppleyard, who joined the Confederate Navy at 12 and later was the major general of the Florida Division of United Confederate Veterans, died in 1931.\nWakulla County springs from famous spring\n2023 was the 180th anniversary of neighboring Wakulla County, which was established as the state's 23rd county on March 11, 1843.\nThe county's name comes from its most famous feature, Wakulla Springs, which dazzled early Native Americans and Spanish explorers. Indigenous people called Wakulla Springs \"Tah-ille-ya-ahan,\" which supposedly meant, \"place where the water flows upward like the rays of heavenly light out of the shadow of a hill.\" But Spanish explorers named it Guacara, their phonetic spelling of a Timucuan town whose name they adopted for a string of missions in North Florida.\nGuacara was pronounced Wakala by subsequent Native Americans (and later spelled Wakulla). Popular lore holds the name Wakulla means \"mysterious waters.\" But experts have long dismissed that explanation as \"entirely fanciful\" — while agreeing the meaning of the original Timucuan town is a mystery.\nHow Martin Luther King Boulevard came to be\nLongtime residents still occasionally call this \"Boulevard Street,\" as it was known for 150 years. Legend holds it was named in phonetic honor of 19th century South American freedom fighter Simon Bolivar.\nOthers say it was named for its appearance as a heavily treed \"boulevard\" buffering the city's western edge (much as the downtown chain of parks buffered the northern end of town).\nIt was chosen for renaming in honor of the 20th century civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. because it ran in front of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church, whose pastor, C.K. Steele, was one of King's lieutenants with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Because of protests by some residents, the name change came in two pieces, the south half in 1980 and the north half in 1984.\n▶'Freedom is never given freely': Remembering when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. came to Tallahassee\nJohnston Street inspired by service of sanitarium doctor\nThis one-block street from Thomasville Road to North Gadsden Street is named for Dr. John Kent Johnston, who operated Tallahassee's first hospital at 805 N. Gadsden St.\nJohnston was a Tallahassee native, graduate of West Florida Seminary (forerunner of FSU) and co-owner of Tallahassee's first airplane in the 1920s with Ivan Munroe and Theo Proctor. The 12-bed Johnston Sanitarium opened in July 1924 and operated until 1944, three years after Johnston's death.\nIn November 1947, the building became the Seventh Day Adventist-operated Forsyth Sanitarium, named for Edna Forsyth, the Central Florida dentist who donated the $51,000 purchase price.\nThe Forsyth Sanitarium closed in 1964 and the building later served as the home of the Leon County Guidance Center (1969-1972), Apalachee Mental Health Clinic (1973-1986) and attorney offices. Since 1997, it has been the home of Moore Bass Consulting.\nPensacola Street one of our oldest paved roads\nPensacola Street, named for the city toward which it runs, is one of Tallahassee's oldest paved roads. It was originally constructed in 1916-1918, heading west from Monroe Street to near today's Appleyard Drive.\nIn 1928-29, with the creation of Tallahassee's first airport near Appleyard Drive, Pensacola Street was repaved and a bridge built over a swampy area that became the site of Doak Campbell Stadium (1950).\nBy the 1960s, the road had been extended to connect with State Road 20, which crosses North Florida from Palatka to Niceville (30 miles east of Pensacola). In 2002, the Pensacola Street bridge was eliminated with the re-routing of the street around Doak Campbell Stadium.\nPensacola, on the western edge of the state, was Florida's first European settlement (1559). But the city was abandoned two years later because of a hurricane, making St. Augustine (1565) the oldest continuously occupied city in the present-day United States; Pensacola was not re-established until 1698.\nThe name Pensacola is derived from a Native American tribe that occupied the area, the Pansfalaya, whose name meant \"long-haired people.\"\nArchitect Phillips was eccentric mausoleum, clock maker; his skull is still missing\nTwo of the most interesting structures ever constructed in Tallahassee were designed and built by the same man: An eccentric architect named Calvin Phillips, who created the long-gone clock tower on South Macomb Street and a mausoleum at Oakland Cemetery.\nPhillips was a famed New York architect who received a medal from France for designing buildings for the 1889 Paris World's Fair (whose most famous exhibit was the new Eiffel Tower).\nIn 1907, Phillips retired to Tallahassee, leaving behind a wife and two daughters in New York. By 1910, he had built a small home and 30-foot-tall clock tower at 815 S. Macomb St., earning a reputation as a recluse with a long white beard.\nIn 1919, he built his mausoleum, often sleeping inside the structure during construction. He died in November 1919; though his family never joined him, the mausoleum had slots for four caskets.\nIn the late 1970s/early 1980s, the clock tower was torn down by new owners of the property. In 2000, the mausoleum was vandalized and Phillips' skull was removed from his casket — and never recovered.\nWhen Phillips died, the few Tallahasseeans who'd seen him described him as a lean man, with a white beard spiraling below his waist. He's inspired ghost stories as some have reported that a gaunt, spindly figure was seen perched atop the tomb.\nJohn Knox: Presbyterian founder's name on short but major road\nThis major (if short) thoroughfare from North Monroe Street to Meridian Road began in 1958 as just a service road from Meridian Road to newly constructed Faith Presbyterian Church.\nChurch members named it John Knox Road, after the founder of the Presbyterian Church in Scotland. In 1964, it was extended down the hill to the area near today's Trousdell Aquatics complex. In 1971, during construction of the Tallahassee Mall, the road was extended to North Monroe Street, where it meets Monticello Drive and forms a major intersection.\nThe greatness of Gaither inspires name for multiple landmarks\nIt is the 30th anniversary of the death of legendary Florida A&M football coach Jake Gaither — for whom everything Gaither-named in Tallahassee (street, golf course, community center, FAMU gymnasium, etc.) honors.\nOne of six children of a Methodist minister in Dayton, Tenn., he was born Alonzo Smith Gaither. As one of the youngest students at Knoxville College, he was required to do chores for upperclassmen who inexplicably began calling him \"Jake.\" The name stuck, with encouragement from Gaither because, \"I liked the name Jake better than the name Alonzo.\"\nA champion debater in college, Gaither planned to enter the ministry until his father died his senior year, forcing him to take a job as a teacher to help support his family. He taught at two schools before being hired as an instructor, assistant football coach and head basketball coach at FAMU in 1937.\nIn 1945, he became the FAMU head football coach — and led the Rattlers to greatness. He coached 25 seasons (1945-1969), led the Rattlers to seven Black national championships, three unbeaten seasons and a career record of 203-36-4. He was a three-time national coach of the year and was elected to the College Hall of Fame.\nHe staged annual football clinics at FAMU that drew top-name white coaches. He engineered 1969's FAMU-University of Tampa game, the first in the South to pit a predominantly Black school against a predominantly white school. He sent numerous players to the NFL, including Willie Galimore, Ken Riley and Bob Hayes. Gaither was famous for his oratory and lines such as, \"I want my players hostile, agile and mobile.\"\nGaither died Feb. 18, 1994 at age 90. Sadie, his beloved wife of 62 years, died in 1997 at 92.\nHayden Road, home of Seminole football stars, was named for prof, wife\nHayden Road, an apartment- and condo-filled street overlooking Florida State University's Doak Campbell Stadium, is believed to commemorate a long-ago professor and his wife.\nEdwin Andrew Hayden was a popular professor of philosophy and psychology at Florida State College for Women from 1915 until his self-inflicted death in 1921 at age 51.\nHayden dazzled students with his psychology experiments, but suffered bouts of depression and had a nervous breakdown shortly before his death. After his death, Hayden's wife, Clara, was hired as FSCW's chief library assistant, a position she held for 25 years. Clara, who never remarried, died in 1970 in the home on Pensacola Street she had shared with her husband and raised their two children in.\nHayden Road is the home of Burt Reynolds Hall, once an apartment complex that served as the football team's dorm from 1987 until a 1995 NCAA rule change eliminated athletes-only dorms. It is now set for demolition.\nA new FSU dorm, for football players, Champions Hall, rose at Hayden Road and Belle Vue Way.\nWilson Street named for contractor, Lafayette Park builder\nWilson Street, which runs between Meridian Street and Miccosukee Road in the Lafayette Park neighborhoood, is named for William H. Wilson, a Tallahassee contractor and early developer of St. George Island.\nWilson was born in nearby Thomas County, Ga., but grew up in Tallahassee. In 1922, he founded Wilson Construction and Supply Company, which built many of the homes in the Lafayette Park neighborhood. In the early 1960s, he was a co-developer of St. George Island and helped push for the 1965 construction of today's Bryant Patton Bridge from the mainland.\nWilson built the first apartment house in Tallahassee, the Wilsonian Apartments, on a block bounded by Tennessee, Bronough, Call and Duval streets, which had been the site of the Leon Academy, a forerunner of Leon High. The site is now the City Centre parking garage.\nWilson also owned Wilson Beach Cottages at St. Teresa Beach, a complex of cabins originally built for World War II Army officers stationed at nearby Camp Gordon Johnston, which was a training ground for the D-Day invasion. Wilson died in 1969.\nLeMoyne: An early French painter of Florida Native Americans\nThe LeMoyne Center for the Visual Arts is named in honor of France's Jacques le Moyne de Morgues, the first European artist to paint pictures of Native Americans in Florida.\nLeMoyne came to Northeast Florida in 1564 as an illustrator and cartographer with the expedition of French explorer Jean Ribault. In addition to landscapes and maps of Florida, LeMoyne painted numerous pictures of indigenous Timucuans, which remain the iconic images of Florida's early residents.\nThe LeMoyne Art Foundation was organized in 1963 by four Tallahassee women: Nanette Fisher, Clifton Lewis, Mary Metzke and June Strauss. The foundation opened its first gallery in 1964 in the former Deeb House on the northwest corner of Calhoun Street and College Avenue (once a Po' Boys restaurant deck/parking lot).\nIn 1968, LeMoyne moved to its current home in the historic Meginnis-Munroe House at 125 N. Gadsden St.\nWesson started as school named for a mayor who offered Babe Ruth a job\nThe school district's multi-use R.N. Gooden-Nancy Russell Center at Wesson on South Meridian Street spent nearly a half century as Leonard Wesson Elementary, which was named for a former Tallahassee city commissioner and Leon County School Board chairman.\nThe school began in 1946 as Prince Murat Elementary, housed in the former military barracks of Dale Mabry Field. It moved in 1949 to 2813 S. Meridian St., and was renamed South City Elementary. In 1956, it was renamed Wesson Elementary, following the death of Leonard A. Wesson. In 2006, Wesson Elementary merged with Bond Elementary and its building was converted to the Gooden-Russell Center.\nWesson was a Tallahassee city commissioner for one term (1935-38), serving twice as mayor. In 1935, Mayor Wesson offered just-retired baseball star Babe Ruth the position as manager of the Tallahassee Capitals, a minor league baseball team (Ruth declined). Wesson served on the Leon County School Board from 1940-1947, including a stint as chairman.\nWesson died in December 1955, when he suffered a heart attack while turkey hunting. At the time of his death, Wesson was president of the local Coca Cola bottling company and had recently resigned as chairman of the state Game and Fish Commission because of health issues.\nOnce known as Bullfrog Pond and a place for baptisms, Lake Ella endures\nOriginally known as Bull Pond (and earlier as Bullfrog Pond), it was originally a natural lake used for baptisms, Emancipation Day celebrations and fishing.\nIn the 1930s, it was renamed the more pleasant-sounding Lake Ella by the wife of developer William Anderson, who developed the surrounding Anderson Heights housing development.\nIt remained a popular fishing lake into the 1950s and site of Tallahassee's annual Fourth of July fireworks into the 1970s.\nWidening of North Monroe in 1968 led to pollution and it was retrofitted as part of the city's stormwater system.\nNow officially known as Fred Drake Park at Lake Ella (Drake was a businessman and civic leader), the park has an encircling sidewalk, gazebo and aerating fountains and is popular with walkers, joggers, bicyclists and ducks.\nLaundry owner, county leader lends name to Tom Brown Park\nTom Brown Park is 255 acres of former federal land given to the county in 1972 and named for County Commissioner Tom Brown, who had died the year before.\nBrown served two terms on the County Commission and was a businessman who operated several laundries and a service station.\nHe also had a big background in sports: A former Clemson football star, he spent two years as the Leon High football coach and was a longtime Babe Ruth League baseball coach.\nHe was renowned for playing first base in city league softball games — without a glove. The county built the original part of the park, which is operated by the city.\nAs a fitting memory for a coach, Tom Brown Park features several softball and baseball fields, racquet and tennis courts, a disc golf course, a 3.1-mile-long bike and nature trails, and a fenced area for dogs to frolic.\nGibbs Drive and Gibbs Hall named for secretary of state who broke color barrier\nA northside Tallahassee street, a Florida A&M University dormitory and a St. Petersburg high school are named for Jonathan Clarkson Gibbs, Florida's first Black Secretary of State, first superintendent of Public Instruction and a delegate to the state's 1868 Constitutional Convention.\nGibbs was born (1821) a free Black man in Philadelphia, graduated from Dartmouth College and became a minister in Philadelphia. After the Civil War, he moved to Charleston as a missionary to newly freed slaves.\nIn 1867, he moved to Jacksonville and operated a private school before becoming heavily involved in Reconstruction politics.\nAs Secretary of State (1868-1872), he conducted investigations into the Ku Klux Klan. He was elected to the Tallahassee City Council in 1872 and died in Tallahassee in 1874.\nHis son, Thomas Van Renssalaer Gibbs, was a co-founder of FAMU in 1887. The FAMU dorm was demolished in 2023 to make way for newer dorms.\nRaymond Diehl: Pipefitter, liquor baron and developer\nRaymond Diehl Road in northeast Tallahassee is named for Raymond Diehl Sr., a prominent businessman who built a home in the 1930s near the corner of Thomasville Road and present-day Raymond Diehl Road.\nCapital Health Plan now occupies the site. Originally, the road was a dirt trail from Thomasville Road to near Centerville Road. Construction of I-10 in the early 1970s severed the road into the current two pieces on either side of I-10. Diehl was a pipefitter who operated a plumbing supply store then segued into real estate development.\nAfter Leon County voters approved liquor sales in 1960, Diehl and his son, Raymond Jr., opened five liquor stores (later sold to the ABC Liquor chain). For 53 years, Raymond Sr.'s wife, O'Neill Diehl, operated O'Neill's Fairy Tale Shop, a popular children's clothing store.\nIn the early 1980s, Raymond Diehl Jr. and his wife, June, developed the Betton Place shopping center, where June operated the upscale Haystack clothing store for 17 years.\nRaymond Diehl died in 1968 of a heart attack while hunting; O'Neill Diehl died in 1988. Raymond Diehl Jr. died in 2003.\nGaines Street and Gainesville named for famed Army general\nGaines Street, one of Tallahassee's most notable thoroughfares, is named for a famous 19th century U.S. Army general, Edmund Pendleton Gaines.\nGaines was born in 1777 in Virginia, where his great-uncle and his father were prominent in the American Revolution. As a young military officer, Gaines was responsible for surveying Mississippi and constructing the Natchez Trace road. In 1807, Gaines arrested former U.S. Vice President Aaron Burr in Alabama on charges of treason and transported Burr to Richmond, Va., where he was acquitted in a trial.\nGaines became a hero of the War of 1812, when he commanded forces that prevented the British from taking Fort Erie. He played a prominent role in the first two Seminole Wars (1817-1818, 1835-1842) and spent several years arbitrating disputes between white settlers and Native Americans. Gaines opposed removal of Native Americans from their traditional lands and gained a reputation for treating the tribes fairly.\nIn 1824, the first Florida territorial council to meet in Tallahassee made Gaines one of the first names attached to a Tallahassee street. Cities in Florida, Texas and Georgia were named Gainesville. Fort Gaines, a historic fort near Mobile, is named for him. Gaines died in 1849.\nCoincidentally, Col. Edmund Pendleton Gaines (possibly a descendant), was the third of four base commanders of Dale Mabry Field, Tallahassee's World War II Army Air Corps base. Col. Gaines served at Dale Mabry from Sept. 1943 through June 1944 – gaining notoriety in October 1943 when he threatened to make Tallahassee off limits to military personnel because of an outbreak of venereal disease.\nVenereal disease became a statewide epidemic in 1943, as Florida became the training ground for hundreds of thousands of military personnel. Gaines sent a letter to the city officials calling for \"more aggressive measures to control prostitution and promiscuity.\" The crisis eventually waned.\nState owns historic Brokaw-McDougall House\nThe Brokaw-McDougall House is the well-landscaped two-story home at Meridian Street and Miccosukee Road. It was built by pioneering businessman Peres Bonney Brokaw.\nBorn in 1814 in New Jersey to French immigrants, Brokaw arrived in Tallahassee in 1840. He and a partner began a successful livery business at Calhoun and Pensacola streets, which operated until the Civil War.\nBrokaw built his home from 1856 to 1860 — a period during which he also served on the Tallahassee city council, Florida House of Representatives and Florida Senate. Following Brokaw's death in 1875, the house passed to a daughter, who married businessman Alexander McDougall (who, after his wife's death, married another of Brokaw's daughters). The McDougall descendants continued to live in the home until it was sold to the state in 1973.\nThe family's original 640-acre property, stretching a half-mile east along Miccosukee Road, once encompassed all of today's Leon High School property and was filled with crops and cows. Brokaw elaborately landscaped the area around the home — and according to unproven legend received advice from Frederick Law Olmstead, the landscape architect who designed New York's Central Park.\nIn 1998, the state leased the home to the city, which hosted weddings, receptions and art shows. In 2011, the state reclaimed the property to house its Division of Cultural Affairs.\nLate Cherokee Hotel connected to Jim Morrison of The Doors\nThe 2012 pardon of the late rock singer Jim Morrison by Gov. Charlie Crist for a 1969 Miami conviction had many readers wondering: Where was the Cherokee Hotel?\n\"Room 206, Cherokee Hotel,\" was the address Morrison gave to Tallahassee police in September 1963 when he was arrested for disturbing the peace while a student at FSU.\nAs longtime residents know, the 4-story Cherokee Hotel was on the southwest corner of Park Avenue and Calhoun Street (across the street from the Knott House).\nThe Cherokee Hotel was built in 1922 and demolished in 1964. One presumes it was a temporary address in 1963 for Morrison, as the transfer from St. Petersburg Junior College looked for an apartment following the start of classes five days before.\nNylic Street an abbreviated named for business interest of Wadsworth's\nStreets of a small enclave of rental houses and apartments near FSU are named for its developers — and an insurance company.\nHowell Wadsworth, a Tallahassee real estate entrepreneur and insurance executive, once owned land at West Tennessee and Brevard streets, where, among other things, he was responsible for creating a housing development in the early 1950s.\nThe street that runs off Tennessee Street is named Wadsworth; another is named Hancock, for Wadsworth's development partner, Melvin Hancock. A third street is named Nylic, an acronym for New York Life Insurance Company, for whom Wadsworth was an agent for 40 years.\nWadsworth owned numerous tracts of land in Tallahassee, including parcels that include today's Riley Elementary School (for which he donated the land), Callen neighborhood, Fourth Quarter restaurant and a downtown square on Tennessee Street between Bethel Missionary Baptist Church and the federal building.\nWadsworth's late wife, Alice, was the sister of Florida Gov. LeRoy Collins; his son, Murray Wadsworth, is a longtime Tallahassee attorney. Howell Wadsworth died in 1985.\nGardens of Edenfield: A couple's legacy inspires road name\nEdenfield Road, which connects Miccosukee Road to the Mahan Highway, is named for Lawrence and Isabella Edenfield – who became famous for allowing townspeople to grow vegetable gardens on their property on Edenfield Road.\nLawrence, a native of Grand Ridge, was a teacher and principal at several North Florida schools, then worked for the state Department of Education. Isabella was a native of Indiana, who taught at Leon High and worked for the Dean of Public Administration at FSU. They married in 1928 and had two children. In the late 1940s, the couple bought a 90-acre tract at the southwest corner of Miccosukee Road and Edenfield Road, then a dirt road.\nStarting in the 1950s, the Edenfields began allowing needy FSU students and neighboring Black residents to grow vegetables in plots on their land. The Edenfields eventually expanded the program, providing space for professors, physicians, attorneys and other Tallahassee residents to grow vegetables. Lawrence Edenfield prepared and provided the land for free for many years (eventually charging a token $5 per row per year).\nThe garden program ended shortly after the deaths, just two months apart in 1979, of Lawrence (January) and Isabella (March). The Edenfields' farm house still stands, though it's now located on Berklie Drive — a name created out of the initials of the Edenfields, their daughter and son-in-law.\nMabry Manor has WWII street names\nThe streets of Mabry Manor are named for World War II generals and soldiers because it was once the home of Tallahassee's World War II Army Air Corps base — though the streets were not named for military personnel when it was a base.\nDale Mabry Air Field existed from 1941-1945. It occupied 559 acres bordered by present-day Roberts Avenue (on the north) and Mabry Street (east). The streets of the military base were identified by letters (Avenue C, Avenue D, etc.) and numbers (Third Street, Fourth Street, etc.). After the base closed, the land reverted to the city, which gave it to FSU, which used it as its West Campus from 1946 to 1956.\nIn 1952, at the request of the U.S. post office, the city gave the streets new names, honoring U.S. military leaders such as Dwight Eisenhower, Douglas MacArthur, Hap Arnold, Matthew Ridgway, George Patton, etc. Nininger Street was named for Army Lt. Alexander Nininger, the first World War II winner of the Medal of Honor.\nAfter FSU departed, the former base became home to the Mabry Manor housing subdivision and Sabal Palm Elementary School. A short distance west, also off Roberts Avenue, is Seminole Manor, a housing development built by Syde Deeb from 1948 to 1950.\nDuval Street named for man who set our capital status\nThis north-south artery in downtown Tallahassee, as well as Jacksonville's Duval County, is named for the first civilian territorial governor of Florida, William Pope DuVal (who capitalized the V in his last name).\nDuVal had been a U.S. Congressman from Kentucky and territorial judge in St. Augustine, before serving as Florida governor from 1822 to 1834 — making him the longest-serving governor in state history. Under DuVal, Tallahassee was chosen as the capital of Florida, and DuVal lived in a home in today's Myers Park.\nA colorful raconteur who ran away from home as a teenager, DuVal once shared a stagecoach ride with author Washington Irving, who recounted DuVal's adventures in a short story titled \"The Early Experiences of Ralph Ringwood.\" DuVal moved to Texas in 1848 and died in 1854.\nRed Barber Way honors voice of Dodgers, NPR\nThe street encircling WFSU television and radio studios, as well as a camellia garden in the downtown Chain of Parks, is named for legendary major league baseball announcer Walter \"Red\" Barber, who lived the last 20 years of his life in Tallahassee.\nBarber broadcast for three major league teams, most famously the Brooklyn Dodgers, where he popularized such colorful terms as \"rhubarb\" and \"sitting in the catbird seat.\"\nAfter retiring from broadcasting, Barber penned numerous books, wrote a weekly column for the Tallahassee Democrat and appeared every Friday on National Public Radio's \"Morning Edition,\" where he often extolled the beauties of Tallahassee camellias.\nBarber died in 1992.\nBloxham gets park, street, building as governor who urged creation of FAMU\nWilliam Dunnington Bloxham was a Tallahassee native who became Florida's first governor to serve two times (1881-1885 and 1897-1901).\nHis most notable achievements were selling four million acres of the Everglades for $1 million to restore the state's financial stability and urging creation of what became Florida A&M University.\nBloxham died in 1911 and is buried in St. John's Cemetery. His one-time home at 410 N. Calhoun St. has been restored and is used for offices.\nBloxham Park is between Monroe and Calhoun streets in the Park Avenue chain of parks.\nBloxham Street runs between Gadsden Street and M.L. King Boulevard.\nThe Bloxham Building, in the 700 block of South Calhoun Street, is the former Caroline Brevard Elementary.\nCollege Avenue originally called Clinton Street\nCollege Avenue, the street that basically runs from downtown to the gates of Florida State University, spent nearly a century named Clinton Street.\nLike many early Tallahassee street names, the name was applied at the time of the city's founding in 1824 to honor a national leader, either George Clinton, a U.S. vice-president under two presidents (Jefferson and Madison) or New York statesman Dewitt Clinton.\nThough the original incarnation of FSU opened its doors in 1857, the street name was not changed to College Avenue until 1916. By then, the western end had been paved (1912), broadened from 24 feet to 30 feet and lined with oaks and stately private homes (since demolished or remodeled into businesses and sorority/fraternity houses).\nNeamathla led tribe near Lake Lafayette\nA residential street in northeast Leon County, Neamathla Trail, is named for the most significant Native American in Tallahassee history: Neamathla, who gave Americans \"permission\" to establish Tallahassee as the capital of Florida.\nNeamathla was the chief spokesman for Seminoles in the negotiation of the September 1823 Treaty of Moultrie Creek, which attempted to relocate Seminoles in Florida. Territorial Gov. William DuVal praised Neamathla as \"the greatest man you will see among the Indians, who controls his warriors with as much ease as a colonel his regiment.\"\nNeamathla led the larger of two tribes occupying the Tallahassee area; the older Chefixico led the smaller band. Both tribes lived near Lake Lafayette, east of Tallahassee.\nIn October 1823, territorial commissioners John Lee Williams and William Simmons, met with Neamathla to tell him of the new territory's plan to locate its capital in Tallahassee. Neamathla objected but gave his grudging approval with the stipulation they not tell other Seminoles of his consent.\nA year later, Neamathla threatened to make the streets of Tallahassee \"run red with blood,\" unless the white settlers left.\nDuVal, backed by a regiment of U.S. Army soldiers, met with Neamathla and his 600 warriors. DuVal illegally deposed Neamathla as head of the Seminoles, and ordered the Native Americans to a reservation near Tampa. The confrontation was retold by famous author Washington Irving, a friend and chronicler of DuVal, in the story \"The Conspiracy of Neamathla.\"\nNeamathla later participated in the 1836 Creek War, was captured and sent to Oklahoma, where he died in 1841.\nBlountstown named for Seminole chief\nBlountstown, county seat of nearby Calhoun County, is named for John Blount, a Seminole chief whose reservation was near the present city.\nBlount was sympathetic to the United States, serving as a guide for Andrew Jackson in the first Seminole War (1818). In 1823, he was one of two Seminole chiefs exempted from the Moultrie Creek Treaty (designed to move all Seminoles to Central Florida) and given their own reservations.\nBy the late 1820s, Blount was being regularly attacked by other Seminoles, who considered him a traitor and in 1834 the U.S. moved Blount and his followers to Texas. Blount was robbed of his U.S.-provided expense money by slave traders and other Native Americans during the move, then died shortly after arriving in Texas.\nBlount's real name was Laufauka, meaning \"One Who Endures.\"\nHe became known as Blount because he reportedly shared character traits with William Blount, a Tennessee governor, U.S. Senator and superintendent of Indian Affairs. In Tallahassee, there is the Blountstown Highway (State Road 20) and Blount Street (south of Gaines Street, between Adams Street and M.L. King Boulevard).\nNeil Kirkman Building named for father of FHP\nThe Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles building on Apalachee Parkway is named for the man who was the founding director of the Florida Highway Patrol (1939) and the first HSMV executive director (1969).\nRaised in Palatka, Neil Kirkman served in both world wars.\nIn 1936, he was appointed director of the short-lived State Road Department Patrol.\nIn 1939, he was appointed commander of the newly created FHP, with an original force of 32 officers statewide.\nAfter World War II, where he rose to the rank of colonel, he returned to build FHP into an agency of more than 2,300 officers. The Kirkman building was built in 1958.\nKirkman retired in 1970 and died in 1973.\nArvah Hopkins named for city power player\nArvah Hopkins was the Tallahassee city manager from 1952 to 1974 and a scion of one of Leon County's oldest families.\nHopkins oversaw creation of Tallahassee's city-owned utility company, the building of a new airport and the planting of 50,000 dogwood trees.\nHopkins was a descendant of an owner of Goodwood Plantation and great-grandson of territorial Gov. John Branch. His older brother, Bill, was the longtime Leon County prosecuting attorney, who won ground-breaking convictions of four white youths for the 1959 rape of a Black Florida A&M co-ed.\nArvah Hopkins is memorialized in the electric power generating station on Geddie Road, the Arvah Branch housing development and Arvah Branch creek in eastern Leon County.\nHopkins died in 1976.\nSt. Teresa Beach: How it got its sainthood is unknown\nThis 2-mile stretch of summer homes along St. George Sound in Franklin County was settled in 1873 on land deeded from Gov. William Bloxham to three prominent Tallahassee landholders: Arvah Hopkins, Patrick Houstoun and Joseph John Williams.\nIt was named for Teresa Hopkins, daughter of Arvah Hopkins, who once owned Goodwood plantation and was the grandfather of longtime Tallahassee City Manager Arvah Hopkins. No one knows when or why \"Saint\" was added to the name.\nLocated 50 miles southwest of Tallahassee, it was originally a two-day trip by horse-drawn wagon, including a ferry ride across the Ochlockonee River. The heart of the development, sometimes called Old St. Teresa, consists of 15 lots along the bay and 15 lots behind those.\nDuring World War II, the homes were leased to the Army officers of nearby Camp Gordon Johnston.\nDempsey Mayo: A Florida Supreme Court marshal and landowner\nDempsey Mayo Road, a mile-long road connecting Mahan Drive with Miccosukee Road, is named for a former Florida Supreme Court marshal who owned land on the road: Dempsey Bryan Mayo Jr.\nMayo was born in 1919 in Ocala and moved to Tallahassee in 1936 to work as an auditor for a private business.\nHe served in the Army during World War II, then returned to Tallahassee where he went to work for the state's Division of Vocational Rehabilitation.\nIn 1949, he was hired as the Supreme Court marshal, responsible for custody and maintenance of the Supreme Court building as well as security and purchasing for the justices.\nMayo served 25 years as marshal before his retirement in 1974.\nOver time, Mayo, who lived on Piedmont Drive, acquired a sizeable number of acres in what was then rural eastern Leon County.\nHe sold the land in individual homesites; many around Maylor Road, named because it connects Dempsey Mayo and Taylor roads. Dempsey Mayo Road is home to Westminister Oaks retirement community and W.T. Moore Elementary School.\nMayo, who was married and had one daughter, died in 1981.\nBroward Street named for higher education-minded governor\nOne of the state's most famous governors, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, had his name applied to one of Florida's most populous counties — and one of Tallahassee's residential streets, which runs three blocks from Apalachee Parkway to East Park Avenue.\nDuring Broward's governorship (1905-1909), he initiated the draining of the Everglades and the consolidation of Florida's hodge podge of state-funded colleges into a system of three colleges (today's Florida, Florida State and Florida A&M universities) under a Board of Control.\nBroward, who piloted a Spanish blockade-running tugboat supplying Cuban revolutionaries during the Spanish-American War, was elected a U.S. Senator in 1910 — but died before he took office.\nPerkins from a pioneer family that owned Myers Park land\nPerkins Street, a southside street between Meridian and Adams streets just north of Magnolia Drive, is named for George Perkins — a 20th century Tallahassee attorney who once owned the land that became the Myers Park, Country Club and Woodland Drives neighborhoods.\nA descendant of a pioneer Tallahassee family, Perkins was born in 1870 and educated at the University of Virginia. Married in 1900, Perkins built a home at 118 N. Gadsden Street in 1904. Because his wife and his daughter were very heavy he had an elevator installed in the home in the 1930s so they could reach the second floor.\nIn 1912, he bought the 1,400 acre former Lakeland Plantation from the Houstoun family. The plantation encompassed most of the land now bounded by Magnolia Drive, Apalachee Parkway, Meridian Street and Cascades Park.\nIn 1924, Perkins sold the city 200 acres for the establishment of Capital City County Club and golf course. In 1925, he sold the city 47 acres for the creation of Myers Park. In the 1930s, he platted the Woodland Drives neighborhood.\nPerkins died in 1941; in 1943, his wife and daughter donated Old Fort Park to the city. The Perkins home now serves as offices.\nProctor and Yancey led city when Levy Park streets were named for them\nProctor and Yancey streets in the Levy Park neighborhood are named for Tallahassee's mayor and city manager at the time they were platted in 1946. The streets were named by longtime Tallahassee developer Syde Deeb and comprised his Circle Beautiful residential subdivision.\nRalph Proctor was a star football lineman at Leon High in the early 1920s, owned Proctor Oil Company, helped found the Tallahassee Bank, served one term (1943-1946) as a city commissioner and was a beloved Boy Scout troop leader. He died in 1987. One of his two sons is famed Tallahassee sculptor Sandy Proctor.\nMalcolm Yancey spent 25 years as a State Road Department engineer before being hired as City Manager in 1940. Yancey was ousted by city commissioners in 1952 (and replaced by Arvah Hopkins) when Yancey opposed the eventually thwarted attempt by commissioners to sell Tallahassee's municipally owned electric power company to a private corporation. Yancey returned to the SRD (today's Department of Transportation) for many years before his death in 1969.\nOne of his 10 children was the late Bert Yancey, a professional golfer who won seven PGA Tour tournaments; one of his grandsons is Yancey Sutton, the former Leon High and University of Florida football star.\nClaude Pichard started lumber company\nClaude Pichard Drive, a residential street straddling Magnolia Drive by Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, is named for the youngest of three Pichard brothers who founded a local lumber and construction company in 1909.\nAfter the brothers— Alphonse, Eugene and Claude — dissolved their partnership in 1917, Claude Pichard continued to build homes throughout Tallahassee (Alphonse and his son continued Pichard Bros. hardware store for many years). Claude Pichard also bought a swath of land along Magnolia Drive from Miccosukee Road to Alachua Drive.\nAfter Pichard's death in 1946, his five children received homesites on Magnolia Drive and the remainder of the land was sold to developers Julius Parker and Harold Brock.\nThe men developed Brockswood Park residential neighborhood (now part of the Old Town neighborhood). Parker named streets for his daughter (Lucy), son (Frederick), great grandmother (McLendon), great grandparents (Browning) — plus Claude Pichard.\nMeginnis Arm named for plantation owner\nThe southern-most, arm-like projection of Lake Jackson (and an adjacent residential road) is named for Daniel B. Meginniss, who owned a plantation in that area along the lake in the 19th century.\nMeginniss was also a partner of Arvah Hopkins, an early owner of Goodwood Plantation, in a general store and land investing. Meginniss was a member of an early Tallahassee pioneer family from Maryland. Joseph R. and George H. Meginniss were early settlers of Leon County and George owned a successful general store.\nPerhaps the best known Meginniss descendant was Daniel's nephew, Benjamin Andrews Meginniss, who was a Leon County judge, Tallahassee city commissioner (1923-1929) and mayor. An amateur historian, who published numerous articles in the Tallahassee Democrat, Benjamin Meginniss died in 1972 at age 88.\nCastelnau Court named for artist who sketched cascade, early Capitol\nCastelnau Court, a short residential street off Old St. Augustine Road, honors the 19th century French visitor who produced the earliest sketches of Tallahassee.\nFrancis comte de Castelnau (1810-1880) was a naturalist, artist and diplomat. He was born in London and studied natural science in Paris. He came to Florida in 1837 at the beginning of a four-year scientific expedition in the United States and Canada.\nHe produced several drawings of Florida's frontier capital, Tallahassee — including three famous, frequently reprinted images. One shows Florida's first permanent Capitol, another shows Jefferson Street between today's City Hall and Leon County Courthouse — and the third is the only known image of the famous cascade, or waterfall, that inspired Tallahassee's selection as the capital of Florida and Cascades Park.\nCastelnau later made a scientific exploration of South America. He went on to serve 30 years (1848-1877) as a French consul in Siam (Thailand) and Australia.\nPark, Adams dividing line for city addresses\nMany might assume downtown's main intersection of Tennessee and Monroe streets form the dividing lines for Tallahassee addresses.\nBut every street direction and street number in Tallahassee is actually determined from the intersection of Park Avenue and Adams Street.\nPark Avenue is the dividing line for north and south; Adams is the dividing line for east and west.\nBuildings facing south and east have even numbers; buildings facing north and west have odd numbers.\nThough Tallahassee streets were first named in the 1820s, the assignment of directions and numbering didn't begin until the 20th century.\nIn 1902, Park Avenue (then McCarty Street) and Boulevard Street (now M.L. King Boulevard) were established as the dividing lines. In 1903, building numbers were instituted.\nIn 1927, Adams Street replaced Boulevard as the dividing line for east-west designations; Adams Street, which originally passed behind the west entrance to the Capitol, was more of a main street then than it is today.\nIn 1927, the Tallahassee City Commission also eliminated two-digit numbers in the first blocks on either side of the dividing streets, instituting today's numbering system that starts with numbers in the 100s.\nIn 1902, Tallahassee had only 23 named streets. Named streets stretched only from Georgia (north) to Gaines (south), and from Gadsden (east) to Gay (west).\nFAMU football, track star built Paremore Estates\nParemore Estates, a subdivision off North Meridian Road, is named for the Black family that has lived on land in the area since Reconstruction — and the late Florida A&M football and track star, Bob Paremore, who developed the subdivision.\nA freed slave, Martin Paremour, was the first to settle on the land. His sons, Martin Paremore and Sandy Parramore (family members have used all three surname spellings), later bought 40 acres each between Lake Jackson and Meridian Road.\nIn the 1970s, Martin's grandson, Bob Paremore, developed Paremore Estates, once marked by a football-shaped sign in FAMU colors. Paremore was a two-time All-American running back at FAMU, a track star and teammate in both sports of the late Olympic gold medal winner and NFL star Bob Hayes.\nOne of the streets in Paremore Estates is named China Doll — Paremore's nickname from birth, because he was a small infant with long lashes and hair. Paremore, who coached and taught at Godby High School for 33 years, died in 2004.\nJim Lee Road named for city's star golfer\nThis long residential street from Magnolia Drive to south of Paul Russell Road, passing Rickards High School, is named for Jim Lee Jr., one the most talented golfers in Tallahassee history.\nLee, whose father was a Florida Comptroller (1933-1946), worked for state government and owned a 180-acre cattle ranch where Rickards now sits.\nBut he gained fame as one of the state's top amateur golfers.\nHe was a two-time winner of the Florida Amateur championship (1946, 1950). He won numerous regional tournaments and finished in the top 10 of several open professional tournaments.\nIn 1960, as president of Capital City Country Club, he organized the Tallahassee Open, the city's first professional golf tournament. After Lee's death in 1965, the tournament was renamed the Jim Lee Open, which was one of the city's top amateur tournaments.\nStreet recognizes 1933 FAMU grad\nPinder Street, stretching from Osceola Street to behind the student union on the Florida A&M University campus, is named in honor of a famous U.S. agriculture adviser and FAMU grad.\nFrank Edward Pinder, a native of Key West, earned a degree in agriculture from FAMU in 1933. He spent many years as a county farm agent in Florida before working nearly 40 years in Africa for the the U.S. Department of State and United Nations. Pinder won innumerable awards and honorary degrees for his work in improving food-production practices in Africa. He became a friend of legendary Ethiopian leader Haile Selassie and Liberian President William Tubman.\nPinder also became a prolific collector of African artifacts and art. In 1983, he donated his collection to the FAMU Black Archives, including one of the world's largest collections of antique Christian artifacts from Africa.\nPinder was inducted into the FAMU Hall of Fame in 1962. He died in 1992 in Maryland. FAMU named the street for him in 2003.\nGoodbread Lane named for the smell of baking bread\nGoodbread Lane, according to its chief historian O'Neal Jackson, is named for what it suggests: the smell of good bread.\nGoodbread Lane is a two-block enclave of homes, just west and parallel to the 700-800 blocks of North Macomb Street. It was originally an unnamed dirt lane with more than three dozen families crowded into duplex-style small homes.\nJackson, 69, a former Leon County school teacher, sports coach and football referee raised on adjacent Macomb Street, said the name developed in the 1940s, when residents baked breads and cakes for Sunday dinners on Saturday afternoons.\nHe said Beatrice McPherson, a domestic worker who lived off nearby Gibbs Street, walked through the community every Saturday on her way downtown, proclaiming, \"There is some good bread cooking here.\" Jackson said children in the neighborhood began calling her the \"Good Bread Lady,\" and the name was eventually adopted by residents to describe where they lived: \"We lived where the good bread is cooked,\" Jackson said.\nThe street name first appears in the 1948 city directory. The street was paved about 1980; the former duplexes have been remodeled into single family homes. Most current residents of Goodbread Lane were raised on or have family connections to the street, which lends its name to the neighboring low-income housing project, Good Bread Hills.\nEverhart a local pioneer in special education\nGretchen Everhart School, a public school for children ages 3-22 with intellectual disabilities, is named for the first coordinator of special education for Leon County schools.\nGretchen Everhart, who had braces on her legs from a childhood disability, was a native of Escambia County.\nBorn in 1908, she began her teaching career in 1929 shortly after she graduated from high school. She taught for 15 years before accepting a position teaching in a school for disabled children. In 1947, she came to Tallahassee, where she earned her bachelor's and master's degrees from Florida State University.\nShe taught one year at a school for disabled children in St. Petersburg, before accepting a position in Tallahassee in 1951, teaching a special education class at Prince Murat Elementary (later the now-defunct Leonard Wesson Elementary).\nFamed for her cheerful, forceful personality, she spent nine years (1962-1971) as coordinator of special education before retiring in 1971.\nTallahassee's first school entirely for special needs children was opened and named for her in 1972. Everhart died in her native Pensacola in 1973.\nMcMillan oversaw National Guard Armory\nThe National Guard Armory on Easterwood Drive near Tom Brown Park is named for the late Henry W. McMillan — a Tallahassee-reared soldier who oversaw all the state's National Guard units from 1962-1975 as the Florida Adjutant General.\nHenry William McMillan Jr., was born in Mississippi, moving to Tallahassee with his family when he was 15. The seventh of 10 children, he was an older brother of Vernelle Tucker, a ground-breaking woman executive for the Tallahassee Democrat, who died Jan. 14.\nMcMillan graduated from Florida High and enlisted in the National Guard in 1929. McMillan worked several jobs in Tallahassee, until he joined the Internal Revenue Service in 1937. He married Tallahassee resident Louise Ford in 1932 and they had two daughters.\nMcMillan rose from private to captain in the National Guard. In 1940, he was called to active duty for World War II. McMillan rose to colonel, commanding an infantry unit that fought in the Pacific. He was later sent to South America, where he served on the task force for the military treaty for the Organization of American States.\nDeactivated in 1946, he returned to the IRS, becoming a division director in Tampa and Jacksonville. In 1962, he retired from the IRS for a full-time position as the Florida National Guard Adjutant General, stationed in St. Augustine. When McMillan retired in 1975, he was the longest-serving member in history (46 years) of the Florida National Guard.\nThe armory, built in 1970, was named for McMillan in 1976. McMillan died in Orlando in 1990 and is buried in Tallahassee's Roselawn Cemetery.\nKoucky Park: The name before the Nenes\nThis 2.8-acre park in Indian Head Acres was given to the city in 1955 by George Koucky, who was one of the major developers of the east side neighborhood.\nKoucky developed the neighborhood with John and Irene Stead, who had bought the 500-acre former Indian Head Plantation in 1947 and gave the streets their Native American names (all streets include the word \"nene,\" which means \"trail\" in the Creek language).\nThe park is connected through a wooded path to busy Optimist Park, a one-time lake filled in by the county.\nKoucky, a native of Arizona who moved to Tallahassee in 1946, died in 1997.\nTharpe street named for Dairy farmer\nTharpe Street originally existed for only one long block from North Monroe Street to Meridian Road and was created by the developers of Anderson Heights, which was a housing development built in the 1930s and 1940s around Lake Ella.\nThe developers named it for the previous owner of the land, G.C. Tharpe, who operated a dairy farm. In 1947, it began a series of extensions west. Today it stretches five miles to Capital Circle Northwest.\nThe two-lane road was widened to four lanes from Monroe Street to Ocala Road from 1989 to 1996.\nAnne Street: Ten-year-old's question to commissioner gets her a road name\nAnne Street, a short service road connecting Crestview and Mitchell avenues at the south end of Winthrop Park, was named for retired Florida State University Dean of Faculties Anne Rowe — when she was a child.\nIn July 1956, when she was 10 years old, Rowe lived on Crestview Avenue, where her neighbor was Tallahassee city commissioner Joe Cordell. Noting that the short street had no name, Rowe went to Cordell and asked why — which led to the city commission unanimously voting to name the street \"Anne Street.\"\nRowe, the daughter of longtime attorney Bob Ervin and the niece of one-time state Attorney General Richard Ervin, earned a Ph.D. in literature from the University of North Carolina. She joined the FSU faculty in 1972 and became the school's third Dean of Faculties in 2003.\nSpanish mission borders San Luis Ridge\nSan Luis Ridge is a west-side neighborhood that adjoins historic Mission San Luis, which sits on the highest part of a ridge that runs westward through the residential neighborhood.\nThe mission existed from 1656 to 1704 and was the capital of a string of Spanish missions across North Florida. The neighborhood was developed by the late David Avant Jr. and his late brother, George, in the mid-1950s.\nDavid Avant Jr., an artist, entrepreneur and historian, named the development's streets in honor of the inhabitants of the 17th century mission. The dozen or so streets include the names of Apalachee chiefs (Don Patricio, Don Andres, Domingo), Spanish priests (Miranda, Mendoza) and Spanish soldiers (Perez, Francisco, Solana) among others.\nThough the mission and neighborhood are commonly pronounced San Loo-wee, the correct Spanish pronunciation is San Loo-weese.\nOld Fort Park: A Civil War era touchstone designed to keep the Capitol Confederate\nOne of Tallahassee's most quaint features is Old Fort Park, a moat-surrounded earthworks erected during the Civil War.\nLegend holds it was hastily constructed in March 1865 when U.S. Army troops landed at St. Marks during the Civil War. But apparently the fort was one of several constructed around Tallahassee in 1864 when the Union victory in the nearby Battle of Marianna revealed the capital city's vulnerability.\nThe safeguard proved unneeded as Confederate troops and volunteers repulsed federal troops at the Battle of Natural Bridge, 10 miles south of Tallahassee, on March 3, 1865.\nOriginally known as Fort Houstoun (HOUSE-ton), it was built on Lakeland Plantation, owned by Edward Houstoun, whose 1,280 acres encompassed today's Myers Park and Woodland Drives neighborhood. The plantation was bought in 1912 by Tallahassee attorney George Perkins, who developed Woodland Drives (1920s, 1930s) and donated the land for Capital City Country Club (1924).\nThe Perkins family donated the fort to the city in 1943. The one-acre park is bounded by Seminole, Maple, Country Club and Santa Rosa drives.\nHodges Drive named for father of homestead exemption\nThis short street behind Tallahassee Memorial Hospital is named for State Sen. William C. Hodges and his wife, Margaret, owners of nearby historic Goodwood Mansion.\nHodges served in the legislature from Leon County from 1923 to 1939, ran unsuccessfully for governor twice and was largely responsible for passing Florida's homestead exemption law in 1935 as Senate president.\nHodges bought Goodwood in 1925, and his passion for horticulture laid the foundation for today's gardens.\nHodges died in office in 1939; his widow, Margaret, continued living at Goodwood and remarried Army officer Thomas Hood. Margaret died in 1978 and Hood died in 1990, bequeathing the house to the nonprofit foundation that operates Goodwood Museum and Gardens.\nAusley Road named for physician patriarch of prominent family\nAusley Road in west Tallahassee is named for physician and longtime Leon County Commissioner Charles Ausley — whose son, grandson and great granddaughter became equally prominent Tallahassee residents.\nCharles Merritt Ausley was a native of Camden, S.C., who earned an undergraduate degree at the University of Tennessee and his medical degree at the Baltimore College of Medicine. He came to Tallahassee in 1901 and established a medical practice. In 1906 he married Elizabeth Saxon — daughter of George Saxon, founder of Capital City Bank and Tallahassee real estate magnate.\nAusley was such a beloved physician that numerous babies he delivered were named in his honor. Ausley Road, which runs from Pensacola Street south across Jackson Bluff Road, was named for him in the 1920s.\nAusley also was involved in local politics. He served several years on the city council, before Tallahassee switched in 1920 to the city manager-city commission form of government. He was elected to the county commission in 1917, remaining 23 years until his death on Nov. 22, 1940.\nOne of Ausley's two sons, Charles Saxon Ausley, became a prominent attorney, and was a city commissioner and mayor (1940-1944). Ausley's grandson, Charles Dubose \"Duby\" Ausley, is a prominent attorney and was the longest serving member (15 years) of the now-defunct Florida Board of Regents, which oversaw state universities.\nAusley's great granddaughter, Loranne Ausley is an attorney who served in the Florida House of Representatives from 2000 to 2008 and in the state Senate from 2020 to 2022.\nSmith Hall named for FSU math professor, assistant football coach\nFlorida State University's Smith Hall residence hall was named for Elmer Riggs Smith, who was an FSU math professor for 39 years — and one of the school's first assistant football coaches.\nSmith, a native of Tennessee, earned a master's degree from Vanderbilt University and spent two years at the University of Chicago.\nHe was hired in 1903 at Florida State College, the co-educational forerunner of Florida State College for Women, which was the forerunner of Florida State University. FSC fielded a football team from 1902-1904, with Smith serving as assistant coach to FSU's second head coach, Jack \"Pee Wee\" Forsythe. Football was dropped in 1905, when FSC became FSCW; it was resurrected in 1947, when FSCW became FSU.\nThe 10-story Smith Hall, originally called West Hall, was completed in 1952 and hailed as \"the tallest building between Jacksonville and Pensacola.\" It was FSU's second on-campus dorm for men and became co-ed in the mid-1970s. Smith retired as a math professor in 1942. He died in Tallahassee in 1959. The dorm was demolished in 2017.\nGadsden Street was originally Butler Street\nGadsden Street was originally named Butler Street for one of Tallahassee's most prominent early residents, Robert Butler, the first surveyor general of Florida.\nButler was a protégé of and Army officer with Andrew Jackson. Butler came to Tallahassee in 1824 and opened a surveying office/home on the site of today's Supreme Court.\nHe established the prime meridian marker, the spot in Cascades Park from which all Florida surveys originate, and designed Florida's first capitol building. He established a plantation near today's Lake Jackson Mounds State Park, where he and his wife hosted the \"Feast of Roses,\" an annual springtime celebration.\nEarly maps show today's Gadsden Street named Butler Street and today's Meridian Street named Gadsden Street. It is believed one of Butler's assistant surveyors named the street for Butler — which Butler later changed because he felt it inappropriate.\nThe name of fellow Jackson officer James Gadsden was moved to Butler Street and Gadsden Street was renamed Meridian Street — as it runs north from the prime meridian.\nShephard Street was named for fallen World War II hero\nShephard Street — a two-block-long northside street from M.L. King Jr. Boulevard to Ford Street — is named for Marion \"Buddy\" Shephard, a Tallahassee native killed during World War II.\nShephard was a Leon High grad who enlisted in the Army in 1942 and won a Purple Heart while fighting in North Africa before being killed Oct. 30, 1944, in Italy. Shephard grew up in his family's home at the corner of North Boulevard Street (now M.L. King Blvd.) and a then-unnamed street. In August 1945, the City Commission named the previously unnamed street in honor of Shephard, at the request of his year-older brother, John.\nThe family home was renumbered 404 Shephard St.. John Shephard lived at 412 Shephard, next door to the family home, until a few years before his death in 2005 — and he named his daughter, Marion, in honor of his fallen brother.\nCan you imagine Park Avenue as McCarty Street?\nThe name seems obvious enough today, given that seven blocks of it straddle the downtown Chain of Parks. But this street was originally named McCarty Street, for an early judge and territorial secretary, W.M. McCarty.\nLegend holds its name was changed to the more affluent-sounding Park Avenue when one of its residents, Jane Chittenden, didn't want an Irish street name printed on the invitations to her son's wedding. Actually, Chittenden was president of a local women's group that successfully petitioned the city in 1905 to change the street name to reflect its relationship with the downtown parks.\nHer descendants insist it was just coincidental her son's wedding occurred at the same time. The street now extends from Florida State University to Capital Circle Southeast.\nCarraway key to legislating FSU-UF rivalry\nCarraway Street is named for the Tallahassee state senator who co-authored the bill creating co-educational Florida State University — and backed a 1955 bill that would have forced FSU and Florida to play football.\nFranklin Wilson Carraway was a Tallahassee native, who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, and became a banker. The son-in-law of Tallahassee entrepreneur Lewis Lively, Carraway and his brother-in-law, future Tallahassee mayor Leonard Wesson, also operated their father-in-law's Coca Cola bottling company for several years.\nCarraway served in the Florida House of Representatives (1945-1949) and the Florida Senate (1955-1966). In 1947, he was a co-sponsor of the bill that created co-educational institutions at previously all-male University of Florida and Florida State College for Women (FSU).\nIn April 1955, Carraway backed a bill that would have compelled the long-established UF to play the still-new FSU in football. The bill was defeated 19-15 in the Florida Senate. Gov. LeRoy Collins and presidents of the two universities later hammered out the agreement that started the series in 1958.\nCarraway Street is in the Capital Hills neighborhood, between Mahan Drive and Miccosukee Road, just east of Magnolia Drive. The street was named for Carraway by developer Horrie Culpepper Sr., who developed the neighborhood in the early 1950s. Wilson Carraway died in 1972.\nShuttered city hydroelectric plant named for former power superintendent C.H. Corn\nThe former C.H. Corn Hydro-Electric facility at the Lake Talquin dam was named for the city's former superintendent of power production, Clemer Herbert Corn.\nCorn, born in 1923, was a native of Pikeville, Indiana. He was in the U.S. Navy during and after World War II, serving as a gunner's mate on two ships. He became a mechanical engineer and worked many years for the Jacksonville Electric Authority. He came to Tallahassee in 1972, as superintendent of Tallahassee's then-two power plants. He was married for 49 years to the former Lucky Strickland and they had four daughters.\nThe hydro-electric plant was built in 1929, when the Ochlockonee River was dammed to create Lake Talquin. It was run by Florida Power until 1970, then was abandoned until the city acquired it in 1978. The city received a federal grant and made it operational again in 1986, when it was named for Corn, who oversaw its acquisition.\nThe C.H. Corn Hydro-Electric facility, off State Road 20 in western Leon County, was one of only two hydro-electric plants in Florida. It produced about one percent of Tallahassee's electric power, operating only when rainfall fills Lake Talquin and allowed water to pass through the dam and power the generators.\nCorn retired in 1987. He died in 1997 at age 74 and is buried in Tallahassee's Roselawn Cemetery. The city moved to abandon the facility in 2017 to pursue solar power.\nCemetery a remnant of Betton Plantation\nA Florida historic marker on Betton Road recognizes one of the few remaining plantation cemeteries that once dotted Leon County.\nThe Plantation Cemetery at Betton Hills was the burial ground for slaves and servants of the 19th century Betton Plantation. The 1,200 acre plantation was owned by Turbott Betton, who bought the land from the estate of the French general Marquis de Lafayette, who received land in Tallahassee for his service to the United States during the Revolutionary War. Betton died in 1863 and the land was purchased by the Winthrop family.\nIn 1945, Guy Winthrop began developing the present-day, 800-home Betton Hills neighborhood — and struck a deal in which the city would maintain the cemetery in exchange for the land that became Winthrop Park in Betton Hills. By the 1990s, the cemetery had become overgrown and the neighborhood association persuaded the city to resume its maintenance of the cemetery.\nThe historic marker was erected in 1999. The marker is on the north side of Betton Road between Trescott Drive and West Randolph Circle. Only a handful of gravestones remain in the cemetery, where most graves were originally marked with wooden crosses.\nEdward Conradi served as FSU president for 32 years\nThe longest serving president in Florida State University history was Edward Conradi. He was selected as the school's third president in 1909 and served until 1941.\nA native of Ohio, with a Ph.D. in psychology, Conradi oversaw the prime years of Florida State College for Women (1905-1947). During his 32-year leadership, FSCW grew from 13 acres, five buildings and 237 students to 88 acres (plus the Seminole Reservation and FSU dairy farm), 20 buildings and more than 2,000 students.\nConradi created an honors program, won the first Phi Beta Kappa chapter in Florida and led FSCW to become the first woman's college in the South approved by the Association of American Universities. He died in 1944.\nThe school's original biology building was named for him and the psychology department's first endowed chair was named in his honor. A street connecting West Tennessee and West Call streets also bears his name. There is a statue of Conradi in the Williams Building courtyard, which adjoins the Augusta Conradi Theater, named for his wife of 29 years who died while he was in office.\nTorreya tree led to local Garden of Eden theory\nA short northside street in Tallahassee, Torreya Drive, as well as various businesses in North Florida, are named for a unique conifer tree found in only a few places in the world — including Torreya State Park, 45 miles west of Tallahassee on the Apalachicola River near Bristol.\nThe tree was named about 1835 by Hardy Croom, the original owner of Tallahassee's Goodwood Plantation, who named the tree in honor of 19th century American botanist John Torrey.\nThe tree gained notoriety in the 1960s, when it was promoted by E. E. Callaway as proof the biblical Garden of Eden was located in Torreya State Park (where the tree has been imperiled for decades by a fungus).\nElvy Edison Callaway was a Bristol attorney and unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor in 1936, who became a Baptist minister. Callaway based his theory on the Bible's reference to a river running out of Eden that branched into four rivers (as does the Apalachicola River) and the Bible's assertion Noah built his ark out of gopherwood — a name also used for the Torreya tree.\nA Torreya tree, planted by Croom in 1835, stood outside the Old Capitol until construction of the new Capitol in the early 1970s. Callaway died in 1981.\nNortheast streets named for banking family\nThe street names of a northeast Tallahassee neighborhood near Lake Jackson pay homage to one of the most prominent Tallahassee residents, and his family, of the early 20th century: Dexter Lowry.\nDexter Marvin Lowry, born in 1876 in Valleyhead, Ala., came to Tallahassee in 1900 as general manager of Florida Cotton Oil Company. He was elected to the city council in 1904 and was elected mayor eight consecutive years from 1910 to 1917. In 1918, he was elected state senator from Leon County, serving two legislative sessions (1919, 1921).\nIn addition to the cotton oil company, Lowry joined the board of Capital City Bank. In 1920, he became president and majority owner of the bank, and remained in that position until his death in 1936. His widow sold the bank to the Smith family, which continues to operate the now-publicly owned bank.\nDexter's 16-year-younger brother, Fred Lowry, moved to Tallahassee in 1925 and joined his brother at Capital City Bank. Fred Lowry served three years on the city commission (1946-1948), including a term as appointed mayor. Fred Lowry helped organize the Florida-Georgia minor league baseball league in the late 1930s, serving as league president and president of the Tallahassee Capitals baseball team. Fred Lowry died in 1985.\nDexter Lowry's daughter, Mary Maxwell \"Tipper\" Lowry, married Frank Sampson \"Pint\" Shaw, who founded Tallahassee Ford in 1920. The Shaws bought the 650-acre Meridian Plantation on Lake Jackson in 1946. Their son, Frank Jr., later took over the car dealership and ran it until he sold it in 1988.\nIn the 1980s, the Shaws developed a portion of Meridian Plantation as the Pine Tip Hills neighborhood on the north side of Rhoden Cove Road. Frank Shaw Jr. named the streets for his father, his daughter Sally, his sister Tennie, his grandmother Letitia and his grandfather Dexter. He also named streets for previous owners of the plantation: Uncle Glover (Rawls) Road and Dwight Davis Drive.\nThere is also a Lowry Drive off Piedmont Road.\nPark, Legion post named for father and son, Ben Bridges\nTallahassee's first city softball field was named for longtime treasurer-clerk Ben Bridges.\nThe city's American Legion post is co-named for his son, Ben Bridges Jr. Ben Bridges, a native of Andalusia, Ala., graduated with a degree in chemistry from the University of Florida in 1905. He moved to Tallahassee to be Assistant State Chemist with the Department of Agriculture.\nIn 1911, he was hired as city clerk, and became city treasurer-clerk in 1920. In 1938, the city built its first softball-only diamond between South Monroe and Adams Streets, just south of Gaines Street, and named it Ben Bridges Park. The city softball program moved to Messer Field in 1963; a state parking garage now occupies the former Ben Bridges Park.\nBridges was severely injured in a 1940 car crash on Thomasville Road and died in January 1941.\nBen Bridges Jr., a University of Florida tennis star, died in a plane crash in April 1942 while piloting an Army Air Corps plane in California — becoming the first UF grad and first Tallahasseean killed in World War II.\nTallahassee's Sauls-Bridges American Legion Post 13 is named for Bridges Jr., and Claude Sauls, the first Tallahasseean to die in World War I.\nSampson Hall named for FAMU football founder\nThis five-story men's dormitory at Florida A&M University is named for George M. Sampson, founder of the FAMU football team.\nThe dorm, originally named South Hall for Men, was built in 1938.\nSampson joined the FAMU faculty as a professor of mathematics in 1899 upon graduation from Western Reserve University in Ohio (now Case Western Reserve University).\nSampson, who had played football at Western, organized and coached FAMU's first football team.\nTwo years later, Sampson and another football-playing faculty member, Jubie Bragg, laid out a field a mile south of campus.\nSampson, who served in a variety of teaching and administrative roles, left FAMU in 1909.\nAfter World War I, a football field was established on the site of today's track and field complex — just south of Sampson Hall — before moving in 1957 to its present site and being named for Jubie Bragg and his son, Eugene, FAMU's first All-American football player.\nLake Talquin and its merged name\nThe 8,850-acre lake is named for the two cities it lies between: Tallahassee and Quincy.\nIt was created in 1927 by construction of the Jackson Bluff Dam on the Ocklockonee River. The dam was created to provide hydro-electric power for the surrounding area. Shallowest at the eastern end, its depth ranges from 15 to 40 feet, with the deepest areas in the former river channel. It is filled with numerous trees and tree stumps that were once part the forest that surrounded the river.\nIt is surrounded by the 30,000 acre Talquin State Recreation Area, which includes the Lake Talquin State Park on the southern and southwestern shores of the lake.\nKleman Plaza named for visionary city manager\nIt's startling to realize it's been more than a quarter century since Kleman Plaza opened — and thus many residents may not even know the origin of its name. It's named for Dan Kleman, who was Tallahassee's city manager from 1974 to 1994.\nThe choice of Kleman, who was only 28 years old then and from \"up North\" (Dayton, Ohio), was considered a bold one by the city commission in 1974, following the retirement of Arvah Hopkins.\nDescended from Leon County pioneers, Hopkins had led city operations for 22 years. But the cool and cerebral Kleman proved up to the challenge, guiding Tallahassee through two decades of unprecedented growth and progress – including construction of the multi-building plaza that has become an integral part of downtown.\nKleman, who went on to posts in Hillsborough and Duval counties, later became the director of the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department.\nTPD officer Ponce De Leon honored after being murdered in line of duty\nTallahassee Police Department Officer Ernest Ponce de Leon was the first TPD officer murdered in the line of duty. A street on the east side of TPD headquarters on Seventh Avenue is named Officer Ponce Way in his honor.\nPonce De Leon, 40, and a father of two, was shot and killed July 8, 1988 at a laundromat near the corner of Lake Bradford Road and Levy Street. Ponce De Leon and Officer Greg Armstrong had been called to investigate a carload of suspicious people, three of whom were escapees from a Maryland prison who opened fire on the officers.\nPonce De Leon died after being shot twice in the chest; Armstrong fired 13 times, wounding all three men, who were captured at a nearby house. Clarence Jones, then 33, was convicted of killing Ponce De Leon and sentenced to death; he died on Florida's Death Row.\nIn 1988, on the 10th anniversary of the shooting, city officials named the street for Officer Ponce de Leon. In 2002, TPD officer Dale Green became the second TPD officer killed, when he was ambushed during an investigation of a home invasion. Officer Christopher Nicholas Fariello was killed in 2022 when his patrol vehicle collided with a car being driven by a man who was fleeing the police.\nFred Lee Park honors man who integrated TPD\nThe statue at the corner of Macomb and Georgia streets, and the little park behind it, are named for the first Black sergeant on the Tallahassee Police Department.\nFred Lee was a cafeteria cook at Leon High in 1952 when city fathers convinced him to integrate the police department.\nHe was not treated equally at first: He had no squad car and had to call white officers to complete arrests he initiated.\nBut Lee eventually was given the same powers as all officers, received his own squad car and climbed to the rank of sergeant before retiring after 20 years.\nLee died in 1973. One of his sons, Fred Lee Jr., is a Tallahassee singer.\nThe park and statue were unveiled in 2002.\nOakland is city's second-oldest cemetery\nAn annual Memorial Day observance is held in Oakland Cemetery, which is the city's second-oldest public cemetery and includes a veterans section. The cemetery is presumably named for its profusion of oaks and other trees.\nOakland Cemetery was created in 1902 and stretches north from Brevard Street to Fourth Avenue, bordered by Bronough Street on the east and originally by Macomb Street on the west. In 1905, the city gave up the western portion for creation of old Lincoln High and a city park (today's Fred Lee ballfield).\nThe veterans cemetery was begun in 1936 in the southeast corner of Oakland and has 170 gravesites of veterans who participated in conflicts from World War I to Vietnam.\nThe Old City Cemetery, laid out during the 1841 yellow fever outbreak, was Tallahassee's first public cemetery. In 1937, Greenwood Cemetery was established for Black people — after city officials decreed Oakland's Black section had reached capacity — followed by Roselawn (1955) and Southside (1963) city cemeteries.\nStreets named for governors\nMany of the Tallahassee streets named for early Florida governors are the result of a street renaming project by the City Commission in 1930.\nThe commission eliminated many duplicate names by giving streets new names — and approved the suggestion of Mayor Frank Moor to use the names of former governors for many of the new street names.\nThe process produced the modern-day streets of Allison, Branch, Broome, Broward, Brown, Drew, Fleming, Gilchrist, Jackson, Jennings, Martin and Reid.\nThe process also eliminated separate names for street extensions and formalized a previously unwritten policy in which north-south streets in Tallahassee were designated streets and not avenues. Tallahassee underwent similar street renaming projects to eliminate duplicate names in 1948 and in 2001.\nEarly settlers dubbed it the Yellow River\nThe Ochlockonee River forms the western boundary of Leon County between Gadsden and Liberty counties – and is one of the oldest identified natural features of Florida.\nSpanish explorer Hernando de Soto was the first European to discover the river, crossing it in 1540 on his way to the Mississippi River after spending the winter of 1539-40 in Tallahassee. De Soto named the river Guacuca. Later Spanish called the river Amarillo, and the first English-speaking settlers in the area called it the Yellow River for its color.\nNative Americans called it oki, for water, and lakni, for yellow. English speakers eventually adopted phonetic spellings of oki lakni, creating a host of spellings through the years before arriving at the current Ochlockonee. The river originates in Georgia, just north of Moultrie, which was originally called Ocklockney.\nIn 1927, the Ochlockonee River was dammed to create Lake Talquin and provide hydro-electric power.\nBut the river continues south from the dam to Franklin County, and empties into Ochlockonee Bay; the longtime Angelo's Restaurant is on the bay. The Ochlockonee River State Park, where the river merges into the bay, was established in 1970.\nMurphree was only FSU, UF president\nA short thoroughfare between West Tennessee and Call streets on the west side of FSU is named Murphree Street — for the only person ever to serve as president of FSU and the University of Florida.\nAlbert Alexander Murphree, a native of Alabama, was hired as a math instructor in 1895 at West Florida Seminary, FSU's original incarnation. Two years later, at age 27, he was elevated to president and married the daughter of a Tallahassee trustee of the university. Murphree guided the school's metamorphosis into Florida State College and in 1905 presided over the conversion to Florida State College for Women, after losing a bid to be president of the newly consolidated University of Florida.\nIn 1909, he was hired as UF's second president. Murphree reorganized the Gainesville school, oversaw creation of its colleges of education, pharmacy and journalism and the construction of 10 new buildings. Murphree was promoted as a candidate for governor and even U.S. President before he died while university president on Dec. 5, 1927 at age 57.\nThe University of Florida erected a statue and named a dormitory for Murphree. FSU named its Jennie Murphree dormitory for his wife, a graduate of FSCW, and erected its statue of Murphree in front of the dorm. Both Murphrees are buried in Tallahassee's St. John's Episcopal Cemetery.\nMcCaskill Avenue named for early city commissioner\nMcCaskill Avenue, which runs west off Lake Bradford Road, is named for Allen Peter McCaskill, one of the first three people elected to the Tallahassee City Commission in 1920 — and one of two people to serve as a city commissioner and city manager at the same time.\nBefore 1920, Tallahassee was governed by an elected mayor and an 8-9 member city council. In 1920, Tallahassee adopted the appointed city manager/elected city commission form of government. McCaskill, Guyte McCord and James Stuart Lewis were the only three people to run for the city commission in 1920. McCaskill was the leading vote-getter (100 votes), earning him a three-year term.\nFollowing the 1922 resignation of the first city manager, J.W. Greer, McCord and McCaskill each spent nearly a year as interim city managers while continuing to serve on the commission. In 1923, McCaskill won a second three-year term on the city commission before retiring from government in 1926.\nMcCaskill, a native of South Carolina, was born in 1871. He was married in 1904, though his wife died 10 months later. He and several family members moved to Tallahassee in 1907, where he purchased a large farm on Lake Jackson and raised cattle and crops. In 1913, he sold his farm and earned a living in livestock sales, lumber and construction. He died in 1941.\nBlair Stone Road named after telephone company exec, not a rock\nLongtime Tallahasseeans know Blair Stone Road is correctly written as three words — not two, as in Blairstone Road — because Blair Stone was a person.\nStone was a Tallahassee telephone company executive and civic leader whose name was first affixed to the street that bears his name in the 1950s — when it was just a dirt road between U.S. Highway 27 (Apalachee Parkway) and Old St. Augustine Road.\nIt was one of many previously unnamed roads — such as Olson Road and Gearhart Road — that were named for employees of the telephone company, which needed to assign names to streets when they added phone service to new areas.\nStone died in 1959.\nGilchrist named for principal\nGilchrist Elementary, on Timberlane Road, is named for its first principal, James \"Mack\" Gilchrist.\nA native of Alabama, Gilchrist served with the Marines during World War II, seeing combat in the South Pacific, including Guadalcanal. After the war, he moved to Tallahassee where he earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Florida State University and worked at the Sweet Shop.\nHe taught school at Kate Sullivan Elementary, Cobb Middle School and Chaires School before becoming principal at Sealey Elementary. In 1966, he became the first principal of the newly opened Timberlane Elementary.\nUpon his retirement in 1979, the school was renamed Gilchrist Elementary — marking the first time a Leon County school was named for a living person. Gilchrist died in 2010.\nRogers Hall honors FSU English prof\nRogers Hall, a dormitory at Florida State University, is named for the university's first Distinguished Professor of the Year, William Hudson Rogers.\nA native of Plum Branch, Va., Rogers graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Davidson University, and taught high school for two years before earning a master's and Ph.D. in English from the University of Virginia and serving in World War I. He joined the faculty of Florida State College for Women in 1922, and taught for 42 years in the English department.\nThe handsome, athletic Rogers was a favorite of women students and renowned as one of the nation's leading scholars on poet Robert Browning. In 1957, Rogers was voted by faculty members as the inaugural winner of FSU's Distinguished Professor of the Year award. Rogers, the author of three books, retired from FSU in 1964 and died in Tallahassee in 1975. The 8-story Rogers Hall on the west side of campus opened in 1969.\nRogers and his wife, Mary, had two daughters: Elizabeth, who died in 2012, was a Miss Tallahassee and wife of former circuit and appeals Judge Guyte McCord Jr.; Isabel, who died in 2007, was a noted Presbyterian Church official and college professor.\nKnott House known for Emancipation reading\nThe annual Emancipation Day celebration is held at the Knott House, from whose steps Union Gen. Edward McCook read the Emancipation Proclamation on May 20, 1865 — officially signaling the end of slavery in Florida.\nThe historic house at 301 E. Park Ave. was built in 1843 by free Black George Proctor, who built many antebellum homes in Tallahassee. It was originally occupied by attorney Thomas Hagner and his wife, Catherine Gamble.\nIn 1928, it became the home of Luella and William Knott, who spent 38 years in the Florida Cabinet (1903-1941) as state treasurer and comptroller; his wife was a poet, who published several books. Following their deaths in 1965, their son, Charlie, lived in the home until his death in 1985, when he willed it to the former Historic Tallahassee Preservation Board. In 1997, the home was transferred to the state, which operates it as a museum.\nHartsfield dairy becomes school, street namesake\nAlmost anything in Leon County named Hartsfield traces to Thomas Hartsfield, a farmer from North Carolina who migrated to Leon County in the 1830s and fathered 12 children.\nThe eastside elementary school, opened in 1956, is named for his grandson, Frank S. Hartsfield, a Leon County superintendent of schools for 20 years (1916-1936). The westside road is named for descendants who operated Hartsfield Farm, a large dairy operation between Hartsfield Road and Old Bainbridge Road; the dairy operated until the 1960s and softball tournaments were later held on the property.\nTom's great grandson was the late Paul Hartsfield, longtime Leon County Clerk of the Courts (1960-1992), who was the father of Bert Hartsfield, longtime Leon County Property Appraiser (1993-2015).\nAccording to family lore, former Atlanta mayor, William Berry Hartsfield, namesake of the Atlanta airport, was the grandson of Tom Hartsfield's brother.\nDeGraff Hall gets moniker from prof\nDeGraff Hall, a two-building, five-story Florida State University dormitory complex at Tennessee and Dewey streets is named for the late Mark DeGraff, a popular FSU professor and administrator.\nDeGraff was a native of New York, who earned degrees at Colgate University, American College of Osteopathy and Iowa State University. He came to Florida State College for Women in 1925 as a professor of education and in 1928 published a noted social studies textbook.\nBy 1947, when FSCW became FSU, DeGraff was supervisor of the testing bureau, responsible for administering all standardized tests.\nDeGraff Hall, originally a two-story dorm, was built in 1950 as FSU's first men's dorm and later became the graduate student dorm. DeGraff died in 1957; the dorm was named for him in 1961.\nThe original structure was demolished in 2005 to make way for the current complex, which opened in 2007. In 1985, the FSU College of Social Work established a scholarship in the name of Mark DeGraff and his wife, Lula Hamilton DeGraff.\nChapel Drive named for former military church\nChapel Drive, which connects West Pensacola and West Call streets, is named for a former military chapel moved there in 1957 to serve as home for Westminster Presbyterian Church. The church placed the chapel over a basement, covered it with bricks, added four columns and a steeple.\nThe chapel was one of two identical chapels at Dale Mabry Field, the World War II Army Air Corps base in southwest Tallahassee. In 1954, five families from Tallahassee's First Presbyterian Church founded Westminster Presbyterian in one of the chapels. In 1957, the church bought the chapel and moved it to a 12-acre former dairy farm on a hill overlooking FSU.\nThe church sold eight acres to a developer, who built homes for FSU professors on the adjacent Westminster Drive. The late Nobel Prize winner Paul Dirac and his wife lived across the street from the church.\nChapel Drive was originally a dirt road from Pensacola to the church, before being paved all the way to Call Street in the early 1960s.\nThe second chapel at Dale Mabry Field was purchased, moved to 2821 South Monroe Street and also covered with bricks. It is now home to New Life United Methodist Church.\nIn 2000, Westminster Presbyterian moved to 4501 Centerville Road.\nRoad named for Andrew Jackson's crossing site\nJackson Bluff Road in Tallahassee is named for the place on the Ochlockonee River where Andrew Jackson crossed into present-day Leon County — 196 years ago today.\nJackson and his army ranged through North Florida in 1818-1819 as part of the first Seminole War. On March 29, 1818, following a five-day march from the Apalachicola River through present-day Tate's Hell swamp, they reached the Ochlockonee River. According to historian Dale Cox, the river was high but Jackson ordered his men to build canoes and the next day, March 30, 1818, they crossed the river and followed a Native American trail into the area of present-day Tallahassee.\nTwo years later, settlers came to Gadsden County and dubbed the area where the soldiers crossed as Jackson's Bluff. During the Second Seminole War, Fort Braden was built to guard the river crossing.\nSettlers also used a Native American trail to reach Tallahassee, when it became the capital of Florida (1824) — though the original route would have been roughly today's State Road 20/West Pensacola Street.\nIn 1927, the Ochlockonee River was dammed to create Lake Talquin and provide hydroelectric power from the Jackson Bluff Dam, built near Jackson's crossing point. The C.H. Corn Hydro Dam became one of only two hydroelectric dams in Florida. It was shuttered in 2017.\nToday's Jackson Bluff Road, which runs parallel to West Pensacola Street, was created and named in 1927, when Gaines Street was extended west of Lake Bradford Road.\nElliot Building named for civil engineer who drained the Everglades\nThe Elliot Building is a small state building on South Monroe Street across from the Capitol named for Fred Cotten Elliot, who supervised the draining of the Everglades in the early 20th century.\nA native of Leon County, Elliot earned a civil engineering degree from Virginia Military Institute and worked in New York, Arizona and Mexico before returning to Tallahassee in 1908 to work for the Internal Improvement Trust, which oversaw state swamp lands. Beginning in 1911, Elliot conducted, designed and oversaw the state's surveying and drainage of the Everglades to provide farmland. He also designed the St. Lucie canal that controls drainage of Lake Okeechobee.\nElliot spent 48 years with the Internal Improvement Trust (now a part of the Department of Environmental Protection), serving as chief engineer and secretary to the board for 28 years. Elliot designed the first giant swamp buggies that allowed construction crews and farm workers to operate in the marshes of the Everglades. Elliot also laid out the first few holes of the Capital City Country Club golf course in 1924.\nThe Elliot Building was built and named for him in 1962 as home of the Internal Improvement Trust and Volunteer Florida. Lawmakers set aside $2 million to demolish the building to make way for a Memorial Park.\nElliot died in 1963 at age 85.\nObelisks memorialize two early St. John's church leaders\nAt St. John's Episcopal Church, 211 N. Monroe St., the two granite obelisks flanking the front sidewalk are memorials to two of the church's 19th century founders. The northern obelisk is for J. Loring Woart, the pastor who oversaw construction of the church in 1837. The southern obelisk is for Hardy Croom, a member of the congregation that began in 1829. The two men died within nine months of each other in separate tragedies at sea.\nBryan and Hardy Croom were North Carolina planters who came to Leon County in the 1830s and bought vast tracts of land. The Crooms were the original owners of Goodwood Mansion and plantation. Hardy Croom and his family were sailing to Florida in October 1837 when their steamship sank in a storm. The presumed order of their deaths became the basis of a lawsuit that served for nearly a century as the precedent for Florida laws about survivorship and inheritance.\nWoart was a native of Massachusetts and Harvard graduate, who was pastor of St. John's in 1836-1838, overseeing construction of the church. In June 1838, Woart, his wife and four members of St. John's were on a steamship to New York, when the boiler exploded and the ship sank. Woart and his wife stayed alive for several days by clinging to debris but eventually drowned.\nEvening Rose streets were named for landowners\nThe streets of the Evening Rose neighborhood, off Capital Circle NE near Mahan Drive, are named in tribute to the land's longtime inhabitants as well as the developer's family. Evening Rose was started in 2006 by Dave Wamsley and Fincher Smith; it was acquired by another company in 2010.\nThe 36-acre development was originally part of a 132-acre farm belonging to Alexis Stanley, a son of slaves in North Carolina who moved to Leon County after the Civil War. Stanley fathered 14 children with two wives. Alexis Lane, across Capital Circle, is named for Alexis Stanley and his descendants continued to live on or owned much of the original farm.\nIn Evening Rose, Easter Stanley Road is named for one of Alexis' daughters. Easter Stanley married Hubert Davis, and raised a large family on the property; one of her daughters, Parthenia Austin, was head baker at FAMU and famous for baking cakes for local weddings. Austin Davis Avenue is named for the two families who sold the land to Wamsley and Smith.\nGenevieve Park Drive is named for Wamsley's grandmother. Brush Hill Road is named for the road in Nashville where Wamsley grew up, across the street from country music star Roy Acuff.\nThe name Evening Rose was suggested by the Austin and Davis families, linking another branch of the family. The neighborhood includes the Imagine School at Evening Rose.\nThis story is part of TLH 200: the Gerald Ensley Bicentennial Memorial Project.
