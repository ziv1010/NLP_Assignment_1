  "body_text": "Lauren James is the most exciting English talent since Kelly Smith and can fire the Lionesses to World Cup glory this summer, according to Euro 2022 champion Jill Scott.\nChelsea ace James, 21, has emerged as a crucial cog in Sarina Wiegman's England machine over the last year as her creativity helped them successfully defend their Arnold Clark Cup title.\nAnd Lionesses legend Scott, who retired from the professional game after helping England claim European Championship victory last summer, believes James can emulate former 46-goal international striker Smith and propel her country all the way in Australia.\nThe 36-year-old said: \"I don’t have to sit on the fence anymore – I do think we can go there and win it.\n\"We have such a great squad. You can just look at people like Lauren James who is such an exciting talent.\n\"She is a great player technically on the ball. I watch her and I just haven’t seen players like that since Kelly Smith.\n\"Obviously Fran Kirby also plays a similar way, but I’m sure that Lauren can get the crowd on their feet if she makes this World Cup squad.\n\"We will definitely be the best prepared team going into this summer – I’m really excited.”\nScott made her national team debut in 2006 and went on to play in four World Cups, four European Championships and two Olympic Games.\nBut most memorably, the midfielder was part of the history-making Lionesses team that soared to Euro 2022 glory at Wembley last summer, capping a watershed moment in the women’s game in this country.\n\"There’s something here and it’s big, but there’s so much more to be done to challenge other countries. We need more investment and funding and I will never stop saying that.\"\n— Women in Football (@WomeninFootball) March 15, 2023\nAbsolutely love this from Dion Dublin 💜#WIFBeInspired #WomeninFootball pic.twitter.com/peva6EmiOb\nScott was recently back under the famous arch as a keynote speaker for the Women In Football Be Inspired Conference, in partnership with Barclays, just eight months after that moment, providing insight into her illustrious career.\nAnd she added: “This event is for all for people who are already in the football community or those just embarking on their career in football.\n\"So it's fantastic to be here. It was a one-day event last year and they’ve grown it to two days now which just shows how much the women’s game is progressing.\n\"And it's great to be back at Wembley.\n\"Being back here brings back so many memories of lifting that trophy on the pitch.\n\"I don’t think I left the pitch for about an hour and a half after the final whistle, just going around and talking to fans.\n\"It gives me goosebumps being back.\"\nThe Women in Football Be Inspired Conference in partnership with Barclays is a unique convergence of women who are blazing a trail in the game, and their allies in the pursuit of gender equality. The event offers invaluable insights and encouragement to women pursuing careers on and off the pitch, opening access to professional networks and development resources",
