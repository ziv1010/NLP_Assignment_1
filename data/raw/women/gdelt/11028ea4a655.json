Why do some fans originate chants and why do many more join in?\n\"It's about expressing your identity as fans, as a collective,\" says Dr Hope before adding that this was more keenly felt in some areas of stadiums than others.\nAll football grounds have sections where the most vocal fans congregate - not just in Britain, but in continental Europe where groups known as \"ultras\" sit and stand together.\nWhile these fans generate much of the atmosphere at games that is valued so highly by other supporters and broadcasters alike, Dr Hope thinks they can sometimes straddle the boundaries of what is deemed to be socially and legally acceptable.\n\"Fans distract and intimidate opposition players - even more so in derbies - and this is where the line can be trodden over,\" he says.\nIn addition, some individuals can feel \"empowered\" by being part of a crowd of thousands.\nDr Hope also thinks some fans get \"caught up in the moment\" during matches and - were they to be given time to reflect - many of them would change their views about where to draw the line between banter and abuse.\nRacism, homophobia and other forms of abuse\nThanks to stronger enforcement and better education, Dr Hope says the levels of racism we saw in the 1970s and 80s have reduced significantly within stadiums.\nHe says we have \"seen a similar journey\" in recent years when it comes to homophobia on the terraces.\nTragedy chanting - when rival fans taunt each other about tragedies such as the 1989 Hillsborough Disaster or the 1958 Munich Air Disaster - is also on the wane, according to Dr Hope.\nWhile acknowledging some isolated incidents still happen, he thinks most fans \"police themselves\", for example by not joining in the offensive chants.\n\"When they won't get involved, there is a lack of traction for the chant to gain hold,\" he explains.\nDr Hope says \"a lot of work\" has been done both to identify and prosecute offenders (for instance through high-definition CCTV cameras) and better educate fans.\nHe also points out that it has never been easier for fans to discretely report offensive and abusive behaviour or chanting - for example by sending text messages to the club about the block, row and seat number of those causing trouble.\nIn plain language, Dr Hope says: \"You can report concerns now in ways that won't risk you getting your head kicked in.\"\nMisogynistic abuse\nMisogyny and sexism do not exist in a vacuum, argues Dr Hope.\n\"Problems are society-wide but football is a vehicle through which they are exposed.\n\"The FA, clubs, the Premier League... and police have roles to play in both education and enforcement, for example by clubs issuing bans, police action being taken.\"\nUltimately, he argues that a combination of education and enforcement are key.\nDr Hope says police match briefings increasingly consider the need for officers and football clubs to be aware of misogyny and violence towards women and girls.\nHe says there is now a lot more awareness and emphasis being put on these areas of discrimination, in addition to a greater focus on safeguarding.\n'Revise definitions'\nFA rules do prohibit abusive chanting and discriminatory behaviour from fans.\nRule E20 states clubs are responsible for ensuring their supporters \"refrain from improper conduct\", which includes \"a reference, whether express or implied to any one or more of the following: ethnic origin, colour, race, nationality, religion or belief, gender, gender reassignment, sexual orientation or disability\".\nThe FA says it investigates all allegations of discriminatory conduct by spectators. Its rules also state a club is \"likely\" to face disciplinary actions if there is \"sufficient evidence of mass discriminatory chanting\".\nNo action is planned against Manchester United over the Foden abuse, however.\nThe BBC understands the chants would have been deemed discriminatory had they have been directed at a female player.\nBut given they were aimed at a non-participant in the game [Foden's mother] the rule does not apply.\nIn light of what happened at Old Trafford and the ensuing fallout, Dr Hope thinks the FA may revise its definitions.\nHollie Varney, chief operating officer of the anti-discrimination in sport group Kick It Out, believes much stronger action is needed to tackle sexism and misogyny.\nShe told the BBC: \"We've seen several incidents of sexist and misogynistic mass chanting in men's football this season, yet too often the response from football falls short.\n\"Sexism isn't 'banter'. Hearing sexist chants echo around a stadium doesn't just affect the players involved or those directly targeted, it creates an environment where women can feel unsafe or unwelcome.\"\nIn February, the organisation's chief executive Samuel Okafor pointed to research it had done with 1,500 female football fans.\n\"One-in-four still feel unsafe going to games and 52% said they experienced sexism within a stadium,\" he said.\n\"There's still a huge amount of cultural work to do to make the game more inclusive.\"\nAction can be taken, though.\nIn November 2023, two fans were arrested for directing misogynistic abuse at referee Rebecca Welch during Birmingham City's Championship match against Sheffield Wednesday at St Andrew's.\nThe two teenagers were eventually referred to Kick it Out's fan education and engagement manager Alan Bush.\n\"I'm looking to change their behaviour and change their attitude,\" he said.\n\"I use a lot of reflective questions, for example: 'If that was your sister or your grandmother and they were on the end of that sort of abuse how would you feel?'\n\"I get them to a point where I start dismantling their attitudes and their views.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.
