  "body_text": "Simone Biles isn’t afraid to show why she’s the GOAT, even if it means outcompeting her man, Jonathan Owens.\nThe seven-time Olympic medalist posted a clip of her Facebook Watch docuseries, Simone vs Herself, featuring a rope-climbing race between herself and her NFL player beau. Although Owens had a head start of over a foot, Biles easily won the race and the couple’s $50 bet. Biles wrote in the caption: “Never underestimate a gymnast 😂 Nothing like a friendly challenge with your boyfriend.”\nNow married, Biles and Owens first made their relationship Instagram official in August 2020, with a simple selfie captioned, “It’s just us 🤎.” Since then, they have become one of social media’s most adorable couples, thanks to their sweet vacation photos, holiday tributes, and matching moments.\nAhead, we break down everything we know about the Chicago Bears safety and his relationship with Biles, from their wedding to their friendly competitions, and everything in between.\nHe is a safety for the Chicago Bears.\nThe 28-year-old NFL player grew up in St. Louis, where he started playing football in high school; he played college ball for Missouri Western State University. Owens first joined the NFL in 2018, playing for the Arizona Cardinals, before joining the Houston Texans’ practice squad in 2019; he officially signed with the Texans in 2020. Then he signed with the Green Bay Packers in May 2023, before inking a two-year contract with Chicago a year later.\nOwens took time off from training to support Biles at the Paris Olympics.\nEver the supportive partner, Owens took time off from training camp so he could watch Biles compete at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris—her third consecutive Olympic Games.\nPro football players are not allowed to take off too much time, especially in the weeks before the regular season begins, but Biles revealed the news in a press conference, saying, “The Bears are actually granting him a couple days off from training camp, so he’ll be there, yes. For just a short time.”\nThis marks the first time Owens has been able to watch Biles compete in the Olympics. At her first showing in 2016, the couple was not yet together, and when she returned for the 2020 Summer Olympics (which took place in 2021), spectators were not allowed, due to COVID-19 regulations.\nOwens signed a two-year contract with the Bears in March. The team’s training camp this summer starts on July 23, and the Olympics competitions kick off on the 26th, so he missed a few days of training to see Biles do her thing.\n“It’s these memories that we make that we’ll never get back, so anytime we can show up for one another in support, we just get super excited because our schedules don’t align that much,” Biles said. “So whenever it does, it’s really important for the both of us to show up in support.”\nOn July 29, Owens shared a selfie of himself aboard a plane heading to Paris. “Coming for you baby,” he wrote over the picture.\nAnd since then, he has watched his wife win two gold medals—one with Team USA, and one in the individual all-around finals. “Another one!!!! You’re so amazing,” he wrote on X after her August 1 individual win. He also shared photos taken of him making heart hands to Biles from the stands, as well as shooting photos and videos of her performances.\nBiles and Owens battle over who’s the better athlete.\nIn December 2023, Biles appeared on Peacock’s 2023 Back That Year Up with Kenan Thompson and Kevin Hart, where she revealed that she and Owens always try to challenge each other athletically.\n“I think we’re good at our own sports,” she said. “We’ve tried to pin each other against on, like, difficulty, ability and all of that stuff. So at the end of the day, gymnastics is harder, if he agrees or not.”\nWhen Thompson said Biles’s answer was a “politician” response, she added, “We fought over it a couple times, and then we bowed once we got married. We wouldn’t talk about it again, but it keeps coming up every time. But he has done my workout in the gym, and he can barely do it. And I went to their NFL workout and I crushed it.” In response, Hart laughed and said, “A lot of uppercuts being thrown.”\nOwens proposed to Biles on Valentine’s Day 2022.\nThe gymnast shared the happy news on Instagram with a photo of the NFL player getting down on one knee in a gazebo. In the picture, Biles wears a leather ruched minidress and black strappy sandals with gold heels.\n“THE EASIEST YES,” she captioned the sweet snap. “I can’t wait to spend forever & ever with you, you’re everything I dreamed of and more! let’s get married FIANCÉ 💍🥺🥲🤎 @jowens_3.”\nOwens also shared the proposal to his social media feed. “Woke up this morning with a fiancée 💍❤️,” he captioned the picture. “Appreciate my dawg @don_julio314 for helping me set everything up, she really had no clue what was coming 😂 @zofrost you went crazy on this one bro really made the night special 🙌🏽.”\nBiles and Owens were married on April 22, 2023.\nThe athletes marked the occasion via Instagram, sharing their gorgeous wedding portraits, taken by Houston-based photographer Rachel Taylor. In the pics, Biles wears a four-tiered white gown featuring a plunging halter neckline and a strappy open back.\n“I do 🤍 officially owens 🤍,” Biles captioned the wedding-day post on Instagram, while Owens commented, “Wifey got a great ring to it ❤️💍 First day of forever 🤞🏽.”\nHe and Biles are both loving pup parents.\nOwens is a devoted dog dad to his bulldog, Zeus. He also runs Zeus’s Instagram, @zeusthebulldog36. The description for Zeus’s Instagram reads, “Most energetic English Bulldog you’ve ever met. I love food, chewing on anything i can find, and taking long naps 🐶 son to @jowens_3 Aspiring model.”\nBiles also runs an Instagram for her own French bulldogs, Lilo and Rambo, at @thebilesfrenchies. Biles and Owens’s pups have even made each other’s feeds, with captions referring to the pups as siblings. (The cutest!)\nOwens didn’t recognize Biles at first.\nThe couple met over social media in March 2020, according to Texas Monthly, but Owens didn’t recognize the Biles from her iconic Instagram at first. “I didn’t know who she was,” Owens told Texas Monthly. “I just hadn’t heard of her, and when I told her that, that’s one of the things she liked.”\nOwens went into more detail about how Biles impressed him in that episode of Simone vs Herself. “Her work ethic was really the first thing that caught my eye. I never really watched gymnastics before I first started talking to her. When I met her, I honestly didn’t know who she was. It was just kind of like, ‘Oh, she’s got a lot of followers. You know, she must be pretty good or something.’ ”\nHe continued, “That’s how I would tell people, and they’re like, ‘Simone Biles?! You for real, the gymnast?!’ And I’m like, ‘Man, she’s good like that?!’ Like I didn’t [know].”\nThe pandemic gave them the chance to get to know each other.\nBoth Owens and Biles both had big plans in early 2020, with Owens headed to training camp and Biles expected to compete in the Summer Olympics. When everything was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they had more time for each other, according to Texas Monthly.\nOwens said, “We ended up hanging out right before the pandemic. It was one of the few times in her life where everything was just shut off and she couldn’t do anything. So we used it to get to know each other—really get to know each other. It created our bond and made it stronger. Now I’m so thankful.”\nSimone says the couple was “meant to be.”\nIn the same Simone vs Herself episode, Biles explained how similar she and Owens are. “We vibe on the same level. We have the same kind of humor. We’re both athletic. We’re both elite athletes, so we definitely get each other. It was like it was meant to be,” she said.\nOwens told Texas Monthly that he loves Biles’s positive personality. “Her energy is something. She’s always happy, giggly, bubbly. If I’ve had a tough day at the office, I wouldn’t want to take that home to her. Her personality, man …”\nHe continued: “This was a match made in heaven. There’s no better person for me. She loves me, she’s so affectionate. I just love that. And it’s just intoxicating seeing how much work she puts into everything.”\nThe two are super supportive of each other’s athletic careers.\nBiles told People that Owens is one of her biggest fans. “Oh, he’s always so supportive. Even if I wake up in the morning and I’m like, ‘I’m tired, do I have to go,’ jokingly, he’s like ‘Don’t say that! You can do it, this is your dream!’ ”\n“He’s always, always so helpful and making sure I stay on top of my therapy and all of that. He’s the best because he also goes through it [as an athlete], so he knows exactly how it is in the process. It’s been amazing to have him,” she continued.\nOwens got the chance to cheer on Biles in person as she won her seventh national women’s title. He posted a sweet pic congratulating Biles, with a caption that read, “First time getting to watch you compete in person and you didn’t disappoint. It’s so cool that i get to watch you do what you love, and be the best at that ‼️ I’m so proud of you my lil champ 🥰❤️ Trials up next and you already know I’m there!! Love you baby ❤️❤️.”\nBiles replied in a comment, “I love you so much 🤎 I’m so happy you got to come watch while in the middle of OTA’s 😘😘 you a real one.”\nBiles also supports Owens’s football career, and attends his football games often. A November 2020 Instagram post shows Biles in Texans gear at the stadium. Her caption reads, “you know where to find me on sundays.”\nBiles called Owens her “favorite person” in a birthday tribute.\nBiles didn’t let her preparations for the Tokyo Olympics keep her from celebrating Owens’ 26th birthday. She posted a sweet Instagram tribute July 22, with a slideshow of moments in the couple’s relationship. “Here in Japan it is already my favorite persons birthday 🖤 HAPPY 26th BIRTHDAY BABE. @jowens_3 I love you so much. Can’t wait to celebrate you when I get home!”\nShe continued, “Thanks for keeping me sane during the craziest times. an ear to vent too, someone to share fun times with and make the best of memories 🖤 not sure how I got so lucky & what I’d do without you! But I hope you have the best day ever. Not too much fun without me tho hahaha 🥺🤞🏾🤍 forever yours, S.”\nOwens commented under the post, “Thank you so much baby i love you ❤️❤️.”\nThe couple celebrated their one-year anniversary with matching outfits.\nBiles took to Instagram to celebrate her one-year anniversary with Owens, posting a sweet pic where the couple wore matching outfits on what appears to be a date night. In the pic, Biles and Owens wear orange shirts—a T-shirt for Owens and a tube top for Biles—with distressed light-wash jeans and white sneakers. The gymnast also included a candid caption, in which she noted that the post was coming after their actual anniversary day.\n“Oops I forgot to tell y’all that we’ve been dating for more than a year 🤍 so happy past 1 year to the best thing that’s ever happened to you: ME 🤍🤣,” Biles wrote.\nOwens left a comment under the post, saying, “Time flies when your having fun ❤️🤪 To many more with you baby 🤞🏽.”",
