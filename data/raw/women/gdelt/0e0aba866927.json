  "body_text": "Mohamed al-Fayed ‘combined most horrific parts of Jimmy Savile, Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein’\nLawyers representing women who claim they were raped or sexually assaulted by the former Harrods boss described the case as the most horrific they have seen\n- Bookmark\nMohamed al-Fayed was a “monster” whose alleged sexual abuse of women can be compared to the crimes of Jimmy Savile, Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein, it has been claimed.\nThe scale of the late billionaire’s alleged offences was laid bare by lawyers representing former Harrods employees who say they were raped or sexually assaulted by Fayed.\nIn a press conference held on Friday following the broadcast of BBC documentary Al-Fayed: Predator at Harrods, the luxury department store was accused of a “systematic failure of corporate responsibility”.\nAround 37 former employees are being represented by the legal team, with “many more” coming forward with fresh allegations of sexual violence at Fayed’s properties across the globe.\nFive women alleged they had been raped by Fayed, who died last year at the age of 94. Victims as young as 15 and 16 from the US, Canada, Malaysia, Australia, Italy and Romania fell victim to Fayed in locations including London, Paris, Abu Dhabi and St Tropez, it is claimed.\nDean Armstrong KC said he had “never seen a case as horrific as this”.\n“This case combines some of the most horrific elements of the cases involving Jimmy Savile, Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein,” he told reporters. “Savile, because in this case, as in that, the institution, we say, knew about the behaviour. Epstein, because in that case, as in this, there was a procurement system in place to source the women and girls – as you know, there are some very young victims.\n“And Weinstein, because it was a person at the very top of the organisation who was abusing his power. We will say plainly, Mohamed al-Fayed was a monster.”\nThe legal team also represents women who were employed by the Paris Ritz, as lawyers said investigations were continuing into “all entities that [Fayed] had involvement in”, including Fulham Football Club.\nUS lawyer Gloria Allred, who has worked on cases involving R Kelly and Harvey Weinstein, claimed that Harrods was a “toxic, unsafe, and abusive environment” under Fayed’s chairmanship. She said the allegations against Fayed include serial rape, attempted rape, sexual battery, and sexual abuse of minors.\n“They involved doctors administering invasive gynaecological exams as a condition of employment for some of the employees who were targeted by Mohamed al-Fayed for sexual abuse,” she said. “Al-Fayed was determined to silence these women. They will be silenced no more.\n“It is not enough for Harrods to now say that they are sorry. Justice demands that the victims receive meaningful accountability for what they suffered.”\nBruce Drummond KC told the press conference it was “one of the worst cases of corporate sexual exploitation that certainly I, and perhaps the world, have ever seen”.\nDescribing the scope of the case as “vast”, he said: “We do not see this as anything but a global claim. Also, the assaults, the rapes, the attempted rapes were carried out all over the world – it wasn’t just in Paris and the UK.”\nNatacha, a survivor who spoke at the press conference, described her excitement when she began working as Fayed’s personal assistant, saying she felt it was “the chance of a lifetime” and that the job would be her “passport to a shining, high-power career”.\n“He was clever and highly manipulative; he behaved like a father figure, saying ‘Call me Papa,’” Natacha told the press conference. “Unbeknownst to me, I had [walked] into a lion’s den, a lair of cover-ups, deceit, lies, manipulation, humiliation and gross sexual misconduct ... The chairman preyed on the most vulnerable.”\nNatacha recalled her time working as Fayed’s PA, claiming that he said he would find out if she told anyone of his sexual advances. “I felt such fear and some sick loyalty as his employee,” she added.\nOne night, Natacha was asked to stay late under the pretext of a job review – but after she was ushered into Fayed’s private sitting room by a security guard, she says she spotted his bedroom door ajar with sex toys on view.\n“I felt petrified,” Natacha said. She described how Fayed allegedly “pushed himself” onto her, before she kicked herself free and ran to the door, telling him she had to meet her father for dinner.\nNot all of the allegations are thought to be specifically related to Fayed. Mr Armstrong said the legal team is not ruling anything out, adding that it is “not the case that we are not pursuing other parties”.\nHarrods said in a statement that it is “appalled by the allegations of abuse”, saying that they were the “actions of an individual who was intent on abusing his power wherever he operated and we condemn them in the strongest terms”.\n“We also acknowledge that during this time his victims were failed, and for this we sincerely apologise. We are doing everything we can to fix this,” the statement added.\nA Fulham FC spokesperson said: “We are deeply troubled and concerned to learn of the disturbing reports following yesterday’s documentary. We have sincere empathy for the women who have shared their experiences.\n“We are in the process of establishing whether anyone at the club is or has been affected. Should any person wish to share information or experiences relating to these allegations, we encourage them to contact the club at safeguarding@fulhamfc.com or the police.”\nA spokesperson for the Ritz Paris said: “The Ritz Paris strongly condemns any form of behaviour that does not align with the values of the establishment.\n“The hotel upholds the highest standards of professionalism and has a steadfast commitment to fostering an environment where employees and guests are treated with respect and integrity.\n“The safety and wellbeing of our employees and guests are our absolute priority.”",
