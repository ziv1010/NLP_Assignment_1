Then a 'gut feeling' led her to discover the unthinkable\n- Catherine O'Dea has always considered herself 'fit and healthy'\n- The now 34-year-old had done everything right to stay on top of her health\n- But her world was turned upside after a shock ovarian cancer diagnosis\nFrom the outside, Catherine O'Dea looks fit, healthy and normal.\nFor most of her life, she rarely had to visit the doctor's office and never imagined anything was wrong. She had done everything right to stay on top of her health, including getting routine tests and pap smears.\nBut her world expectedly came crashing down at the age of 33 when she received a devastating diagnosis - despite never seeing the warning signs.\nThe only thing she noticed were her 'normal women symptoms' - subtle signs that she would soon discover were ovarian cancer.\n'I now can honestly see how ovarian cancer is called a 'silent' cancer. My signs and symptoms were very, very vague,' Catherine, now 34, told FEMAIL.\nThe communications manager, from Victoria, decided to see a GP for a check up after noticing her periods were irregular while tracking her cycle.\n'I was getting my period every few weeks for a short amount of time. It was strange but I thought my \"hormones must just be out of whack\". I had a bit of pain in my right side, but again, I put this down to just \"being a woman\",' she said.\n'I was just fed up with \"putting up\" with the period pain, the discomfort of my cycles. I just knew in my gut my body wasn't 100 per cent. I decided to put my health first - and that's how it started. I still look back and think, \"Thank God\", because so many of us overlook our own health.'\nFrom an outsider’s perspective, Catherine O'Dea is fit, healthy and normal By at 33, she received a devastating ovarian cancer diagnosis - despite never seeing the warning signs\nBefore her diagnosis, she was leading a seemingly normal and active life.\nCatherine loved playing sports, and in 2024, she was involved in netball, as well as women's football and rugby.\n'I considered myself fairly fit and healthy, as I have been for most of my life,' she said.\n'I'd rarely find myself at the doctors unless it was for a sports injury.'\n'Everything on the women's health side of things seemed fine, tests were up to date but unfortunately pap smears don't detect the early stages of ovarian cancer.'\nA pap test is only used to screen for cervical cancer.\n'Nothing alarming'\nIn early 2024, she began tracking her cycle, only to notice an unusual pattern.\n'I noticed the irregular periods, along with skin breakouts, fatigue and a dull, stabbing pain in my right side - though nothing alarming,' Catherine said.\n'I thought all of these symptoms were just linked to my hormones playing up and my cycle - something women deal with very often for various reasons.'\nBefore her shock diagnosis, she was leading a seemingly normal and active life\nShe booked an appointment with a GP after assuming her symptoms might be due to endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\nCatherine had several blood tests, multiple follow-up GP appointments, an iron infusion, an ultrasound and was eventually referred to a gynecologist.\n'They thought there was a burst cyst on my right ovary which could be linked to endometriosis and what they thought could explain the pain - something fairly common,' she said.\n'It was the gynecologist who left no box unticked and I'm so thankful for how thorough he was. He wanted to not just \"fix\" my issues, but get to the bottom of \"why\",' she said.\nAfter undergoing more tests, she received a call from her gynecologist the following day, who explained he had spotted something unusual but he was 'not overly worried'.\nShe had an MRI to assess whether she might have endometriosis after showing 'vague signs' of the condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus.\nHer gynecologist referred her results to a hospital where doctors discovered a 'hardened mass' on her right ovary, which they initially thought was a ruptured cyst.\n'And this was the first time I physically heard the word \"cancer\",' Catherine recalled.\n'But to be honest, it was never really a huge consideration for me, even in my referral appointment with the oncologists because of my age, and I wasn't showing any major signs of cancer in my blood work so we really didn't think this was the case.\n'We did think it could potentially be a pre-cancerous tumour, where the cells are abnormal and could eventually form into something nasty, but it's unlikely.'\nFor most of her life, she rarely visited the doctor's office and never suspected anything was wrong, as she had done everything right to stay on top of her health\nShe was required to undergo surgery to confirm her diagnosis.\n'We wouldn't know what it was until the surgery. But honestly, all along, I never thought it would end with the diagnosis that it did,' she said.\nCatherine had surgery on September 30 of last year to remove her right ovary and fallopian tube, along with biopsies from the surrounding areas.\n'My surgery was an oophorectomy where we removed the right ovary and fallopian tube. I'm blessed to be in the position where the surgery was the immediate extent of it for me,' she said.\nOn October 8, she was told she had stage 1A ovarian cancer. Stage A1 is an early stage ovarian cancer, a type that is confined to one ovary or fallopian tube.\n'It probably took a while to sink in,' she said.\n'There was a lot of confusion, some shock and, in a way, I felt like I almost didn't have cancer because I felt like I hadn't gone through it as such.\n'My new normal will be check-ups every six months which will include scans, blood work, ultrasounds as well as now going down the route for my fertility options.\n'But again, considering how much worse it could have been, I still feel lucky.'\nPhysically, she said her recovery from surgery 'could not have gone better'.\n'The mental side of things, and trying to grasp exactly what happened is probably the most difficult thing to deal with,' Catherine said.\nCatherine was diagnosed with stage 1A ovarian cancer. Stage A1 is an early stage ovarian cancer, a type that is confined to one ovary or fallopian tube\nDuring her journey, she joined Workout 4 Women Challenge after reaching out to Ovarian Cancer Australia for support.\nWorkout 4 Women is a free fitness challenge anyone can take part in to raise funds for those facing the life-changing news of an ovarian cancer diagnosis.\n'A big part of me felt the need to use my experience and turn it into something positive. It was only by researching exactly what ovarian cancer was, as I was honestly so in the dark about it, that I came across the the challenge,' she said.\n'I thought if I can use my experience to start a conversation, or just spark the thought to go and get that check up if you think anything is slightly off, then why not because as I know, ovarian cancer is difficult to detect in its early stages.\n'Symptoms are so vague and can often be associated with other conditions - which is how my journey started, I thought it was \"something else\".'\nIt has only been four months since her diagnosis but Catherine said she feels 'physically good'.\n'It's still fairly early days... The mental battle of having a bit of \"fear\" of whether or not it will occur again does creep in,' she admitted.\n'I'm still honestly learning about it all, but sharing my story has helped tenfold, and as time goes on it's something I'm slowly learning to grasp.'\nWarning signs\nShe urged everyone to look out of the common signs, which includes abdominal bloating, stomach pains, feeling full after eating a small portion and needing to urinate often or urgently.\nOther symptoms include changes in bowel habits, unexplained weight gain or loss, excessive fatigue, lower back pain, nausea and pain during sex.\nCatherine hopes by sharing her story, many will be encouraged to get checked\n'Again, signs and symptoms for ovarian cancer are so vague and are often mistaken for other conditions. It is important to remember that all these symptoms can be caused by other, less serious medical conditions,' she said.\n'However, if you are experiencing any of these symptoms, which are persistent and troublesome, you should see your doctor. They will be able to examine you and if necessary, do further tests to find the cause of your problems.\n'If you are not comfortable with your doctor’s diagnosis or you are still concerned about unexplained persistent symptoms, you should seek a second opinion.'\nShe hopes by sharing her story, many will be encouraged to get checked.\n'Book in that check-up, your health is so important, and too often we push things aside,' she said.\n'Whether it's for yourself, your mother, your friend, or any other woman - encourage them to book in that appointment, no matter what it may be.\n'You know your body better than anyone else, so always listen to what your body is saying and trust your instincts. Track your symptoms in our symptom diary and take this record with you to your doctor.'\nFor those going through Cancer, Catherine said: 'You are so strong.'\n'I've been told so many stories, particularly in relation to ovarian cancer, and a major theme is the strength of these women.\n'If I had any advice, it would be to lean on the support of this amazing community we have. I can't express how much it has helped me.'",
