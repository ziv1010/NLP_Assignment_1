The home fans came in droves with some 4,000 turning up to cheer the team on.\nIt must be the first time to have that number of fans coming into Likas Stadium to watch a women’s match.\nTheir presence was a great morale booster for the players who had to face a team that had earlier defeated APF FC 1-0, whilst we only managed a goalless draw.\nAdvertisement",
