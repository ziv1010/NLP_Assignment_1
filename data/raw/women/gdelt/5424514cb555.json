  "body_text": "Fulham FC and the Paris Ritz are now being probed for victims of Mohamed Al-Fayed's 'predatory behaviour' - as lawyers warned the investigation into the suspected sex fiend would likely go global.\nFive women have claimed they were raped by the Harrods tycoon, who died last year aged 94, and a further 20 female employees allege Al-Fayed sexually assaulted them.\n'Monster' Al-Fayed allegedly forced some of his victims to take sexual health tests and left them 'petrified' while attempting to abuse them - with Harrods now standing accused of covering up the rape claims levelled against Al-Fayed.\nSo horrific was some of the alleged abuse suffered at the hands of Al-Fayed, those representing his victims compared him to notorious sex predators Jimmy Savile, Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein.\nBut lawyers today warned the true extent of Al-Fayed's alleged offending could go further, 'with victims all over the world' - with investigations now taking place at the Ritz in Paris and Fulham FC, which were both owned by the tycoon.\nDuring a bombshell press conference on Friday, barristers admitted they were looking into the two other businesses, with barrister Maria Mulla telling journalists: 'Wherever [Al-Fayed] went, there will be victims.'\nIt comes as it was last night revealed:\n- How Al-Fayed rose from the streets of Egypt to rub shoulders with British royalty;\n- Accusers criticised the portrayal of him as 'funny and gregarious' in The Crown;\n- His family have reportedly been in a Succession-style battle over his inheritance\nLate billionaire Mohamed Al-Fayed has been described as 'a monster' amid claims he raped multiple women working for him at Harrods\nAl-Fayed was compared to sexual predators Jimmy Savile (left) and Jeffrey Epstein (right).\nPictured is one of Al-Fayed's alleged victims, who went by the name Natacha (right) hugging one of her lawyers at the press conference\nIt's understood legal experts are representing alleged female victims employed by the Ritz - which Al-Fayed bought in 1979 for $30 million.\nMs Mulla confirming that at this stage they did not represent any women who 'sustained attacks' at Al-Fayed's former football club in Fulham.\nAl-Fayed bought the west London club in 1997 and under his ownership they rose to the top half of the Premier League in the early 2000s, peaking in qualification for the Europa League. He sold the team in 2013.\nA Fulham FC spokesperson said: 'We are deeply troubled and concerned to learn of the disturbing reports following yesterday's documentary. We have sincere empathy for the women who have shared their experiences.\n'We are in the process of establishing whether anyone at the club is or has been affected. Should any person wish to share information or experiences relating to these allegations, we encourage them to contact the club at safeguarding@fulhamfc.com or the police.'\nA spokeswoman for the Ritz Paris said: 'The Ritz Paris strongly condemns any form of behaviour that does not align with the values of the establishment.\n'The hotel upholds the highest standards of professionalism and has a steadfast commitment to fostering an environment where employees and guests are treated with respect and integrity.\nAl-Fayed bought the west London club in 1997 and under his ownership they rose to the top half of the Premier League in the early 2000s (he is pictured outside the club)\nAl-Fayed bought the Ritz in Paris in 1979 for $30 million when the hotel chain was almost bankrupt (he is pictured outside the hotel in December 2016)\n'The safety and wellbeing of our employees and guests are our absolute priority.'\nMultiple women have already come forward to claim Al-Fayed sexually abused them in the Knightsbridge store and at his luxury properties in the UK and on foreign trips abroad.\nFurther claims were levelled at Harrods today, with lawyers saying the luxury retailed was plagued by a 'toxic' culture under Al-Fayed's 25 years in charge, as the wealthy businessman 'preyed upon... his own employees for his own sexual gratification' and tried to 'silence' his vulnerable victims.\nBarrister Dean Armstrong KC told the press conference the case of Al-Fayed 'combines some of the most horrific elements of the cases involving Jimmy Savile, Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein'.\nHe said: 'I have many years of practice... I have never seen a case as horrific as this.\n'This case combines some of the most horrific elements of the cases involving Jimmy Savile, Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein.\n'Savile because in this case, as in that, the institution, we say, knew about the behaviour.\n'Epstein because in that case, as in this, there was a procurement system in place to source the women and girls - as you know there are some very young victims.\n'And Weinstein, because it was a person at the very top of the organisation who was abusing his power.\n'We will say plainly, Mohamed Al-Fayed was a monster.'\nMore than 100 women have got in contact with the legal team representing some of Al Fayed's accusers since the BBC documentary aired on Thursday evening, barrister Bruce Drummond said.\nMr Drummond revealed on Friday that there have been about 100 enquiries. The team is already representing 37 women.\nSpeaking earlier to reporters from across the global press, he added: 'This is one of the worse cases of sexual exploitation that I and perhaps the world has ever seen.\n'It was horrific, just horrific. It's horrific because of the acts carried out on these women and girls.\n'It was horrific because it was the system that procured them, enabling the abuse of these young women and its horrific, because the effect this sexual abuse and of Harrods' institutional betrayal have had on our clients.'\nIt comes as one of Al Fayed's alleged victims told the press conference how the billionaire businessman was 'highly manipulative' and left her 'petrified' as he abused her.\nIn chilling testimony, the woman - known as only Natacha - said joining Harrods was like 'walking into a lion's den' and said Al-Fayed 'preyed on the most vulnerable'.\nOne of Mohamed Al-Fayed's alleged victims, who went by the name Natacha (pictured), told the press conference the billionaire businessman was 'highly manipulative'.\nBarrister Bruce Durmmond (left) and Dean Armstrong KC, who represented the female former employees of Harrods\nThe BBC documentary says the Egyptian-born businessman - who died in London aged 94 last August - carried out the attacks while Harrods boss between 1984 and its sale in 2010\nBranding Al-Fayed a 'sick predator', she said: 'Mohamed was clever and highly manipulative.\nSpeaking about the alleged abuse she suffered at the hands of Al-Fayed, Natacha continued: 'Mohamed Al-Fayed, a sick predator, lured me in by using the same modus operandi he used time and time again.\n'I was subjected to Aids and STD testing without consent, and now believe in hindsight, I was checked for my purity.'\nSpeaking about what happened in meetings with Al-Fayed, Natacha said: 'These private meetings turned into more of a forced kiss, his hands gripping your face to his lips or pulling you down on his lap, where his hands were free to explore any part of your body that he wished.\n'These incidents lasted seconds, but the fear instilled left me paralysed.\n'Al-Fayed brushed off these moments like they had never happened, but I was always reminded not to mention them to anyone.'\nMr Armstrong KC said it is time Harrods 'took responsibility' and 'set matters right'.\nHe told the press conference: 'We are here to say publicly and to the world, or to Harrods in front of the world, that it is time that they took responsibility, and it is time that they set matters right, and that is something they should do as soon as possible.\n'They need to face up to accept the responsibility, that they have full culpability for the abuse that these women suffered.\n'Today, we are going to set out our claim and how our claim shows an abject failure of corporate responsibility and a failure to provide a safe system of work.'\nDuring the press conference, barrister Maria Mulla told how female workers were tormented and threatened by the billionaire alleged sex pest.\nDean Armstrong KC, who featured in 'Al-Fayed: Predator at Harrods' speaks during a press conference to discuss the involvement of the legal team in the investigation and the legal claim against Harrods\nNatacha, who says she was sexually abused by Al-Fayed, described him as a 'monster'\nGemma, who worked for Fayed between 2007 and 2009, is among those accusing him and featured in a BBC documentary on Thursday evening\nWomen would often have to 'speak in some kind of code' and if female workers ever complained they would 'receive threats along the lines of you will never work in London again', the barrister said as she laid bare the horrifying accusations.\nDescribing the threats, Ms Mulla said staff were told 'I know where you and your family live' by security officials allegedly working for Al-Fayed.\n'Often they would be demoted and false allegations made about them so they would have no choice but to leave Harrods,' she added.\n'Threats were also made about police action by the security team.'\nOne woman who had the 'courage and bravery' to report her sexual assault in a written complaint was threatened hours later.\n'One woman we rep was sexually assaulted and she had the bravery and courage to raise this in a formal written complaint to Harrods.\n'On the same day the head of security, John Macnamara said, 'you are a girl alone in London, someone could jump out the bushes at you or you could have a sudden accident,' Ms Mulla said.\n'She of course did what she was told because she was absolutely petrified.'\nAnother woman tried to resign to 'get away from it', Ms Mulla added, claiming the victim had also been threatened.\nUS lawyer Gloria Allred told the press conference Harrods was a 'toxic, unsafe and abusive environment' under the chairmanship of Mohamed Al-Fayed.\nShe said: 'The allegations against Mohamed Al-Fayed include serial rape, attempted rape, sexual battery, and sexual abuse of minors. They involved doctors administering invasive gynaecological exams as a condition of employment for some of the employees who were targeted by Mohamed Al-Fayed for sexual abuse.\n'The allegations also include the unauthorised disclosure to Mohamed Al-Fayed of the examination results of employees he targeted for sexual abuse.\n'The allegations involve cover-ups, threats and a quarter of a century of sexual abuse by Mohamed Al-Fayed after he purchased Harrods and became its chairman.\nOne of Mr Al-Fayed's accusers, Natacha (right), no surname given, who featured in 'Al-Fayed: Predator at Harrods' is reassured by American Attorney Gloria Allred after speaking during a press conference\nSome of Fayed's assaults are said to have been carried out at his Park Lane property in London\nHarrods (pictured) was an alleged hunting ground for Al-Fayed who targeted 'vulnerable' women before sexually assaulting them\n'Harrods is often referred to as the most beautiful store in the world... many women dreamed of working there, to be associated with this prestigious corporation and to further their careers.\n'However, underneath the Harrods glitz and glamour was a toxic, unsafe and abusive environment.'\nAnd in a bombshell statement, lawyers claimed that further probes had been launched into potential crimes by the retail tycoon at other places he was linked to.\nQuestioned on whether employees at other businesses owned by Al-Fayed, such as Fulham Football Club, were also allegedly subject to sexual abuse, barrister Maria Mulla said: 'Yes, we are aware of allegations that have been made at other places of work.\n'We also represent women who were employed by the Ritz.\n'We don't at this stage represent any women who, for instance, sustained attacks at Fulham Football Club.\n'But our investigations are obviously ongoing into all these entities that he had an involvement in.'\nShe said investigations so far had revealed a 'startling' number of women from Harrods involved in the alleged abuse by the Egyptian.\n'It's highly unlikely that there are not victims out there from these other places of work - wherever he went, there will be victims,' the lawyer told reporters.\nBarrister Dean Armstrong KC told the press conference 'this is and was a systematic failure of corporate responsibility'.\n'And that systematic failure is on the shoulders of Harrods,' he said.\nHe added that compensation from Harrods for women who have claimed sexual abuse against Mohamed Al-Fayed would be 'welcome'.\nIf Harrods feel that they ought to compensate women financially for what they've done and how they failed them, then of course that is something which we would welcome,' he told the conference.\n'But we are not going to sit here and accept any suggestion that we are only interested in money.\n'This is about much, much, much more.'\nAsked about the global scope of the case, barrister Bruce Drummond told the news conference the 'scope of this case is vast' and listed countries were Mohamed Al-Fayed's accusers are from.\nHe said some of the women are from Malaysia, Australia, Italy, Romania, the US and Canada.\nThe revelation comes as the boss of Harrods apologised for the firm 'failing' its employees after sex abuse allegations against late owner Al-Fayed, a leaked memo reveals.\nManaging director Michael Ward has written to staff as a BBC investigation revealed five female ex-employees accused Fayed of raping them - admitting that Harrods 'failed our employees who were his victims and for this we sincerely apologise'.\nMr Ward has told current staff in his internal message they would receive 'the support you need during this incredibly difficult time', as he described Fayed as 'abusing his power wherever he operated'.\nSome of those involved claim they were coerced into undergoing invasive medical exams in which they were tested for sexually transmitted diseases, with the results being sent directly to Al-Fayed himself.\nHarrowing details of the accusations, including vivid descriptions of the alleged rapes by the women, were shown on a new programme called Al-Fayed: Predator at Harrods - along with claims the firm itself not only failed to intervene to help the alleged victims but also covered up their claims.\nBruce Drummond, a barrister representing some of the former employees, said: 'The spider's web of corruption and abuse in this company was unbelievable and very dark.\n'Any place of work has a duty to ensure the safety of its employees. Without question, the company failed these ladies.\n'That's why we step in. Because they just did nothing to actually prevent this. They did the opposite. They enabled it.'\nFormer Harrods owner Mohamed Al-Fayed has been accused of sexual assault by multiple women including one, Gemma, who worked as his personal assistant between 2007 and 2009\nThe BBC documentary says the Egyptian-born businessman - who died in London aged 94 last August - carried out the attacks while Harrods boss between 1984 and its sale in 2010\nThe corporation says more than 20 female former workers at Harrods have come forward to accuse Al-Fayed (pictured) of sexual abuse\nAnd now in his memo to staff, Mr Ward wrote: 'You may be aware of the BBC documentary, and the accompanying podcast, concerning allegations of misconduct by Harrods' former owner and Chairman, the late Mohamed Al-Fayed during his period of ownership of Harrods from 1985 to 2010.\n'We know that the content and detail outlined within the documentary is extremely upsetting to watch, for those in the business at the time of the alleged behaviour, and for those that have joined the business since.\n'We wanted to reach out to you directly to let you know how we have responded, and what we have been doing separately to support the victims of Al-Fayed, and ensure that you, our colleagues, have the support you need during this incredibly difficult time.\n'As our response to the BBC outlined, we are utterly appalled by the allegations of abuse perpetrated by Mohamed Al-Fayed. These were the actions of an individual who was intent on abusing his power wherever he operated, and we condemn them in the strongest terms. We also acknowledge that during this time as a business we failed our employees who were his victims and for this we sincerely apologise.\n'The Harrods of today is a very different organisation to the one owned and controlled by Al-Fayed between 1985 and 2010. This is why, since new information came to light in 2023 about historic allegations of sexual abuse by Al-Fayed, it has been our priority to settle claims in the quickest way possible, avoiding lengthy legal proceedings for the women involved.\n'This process is still available for any current or former Harrods colleagues. While we cannot undo the past, we have been determined to do the right thing as an organisation, driven by the values we hold today.'\nHe urged anyone affected and still working at Harrods to contact its human resources department, while also sharing contact details for help services including confidential helplines and sexual harassment support officers.\nMr Ward added: 'This is an extremely difficult time for us as a business. My ask is that you continue to look out for your teams and yourselves, and seek the support you require from colleagues and from the business.\n'My final point is that this is an issue of extreme sensitivity to many. I ask that you treat this issue with the compassion and sensitivity that it warrants, both inside the business and in your personal lives.'\nThe alleged attacks are said to have happened not only in London including at his Mayfair flat in the capital but also in Paris, at the Ritz hotel which he owned, and St Tropez in France as well as Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.\nOne of his alleged victims, Gemma, who worked for Al-Fayed as a personal assistant between 2007 and 2009, says his behaviour would turn more frightening during work trips abroad\nShe says he raped her at Villa Windsor in Paris's Bois de Boulogne, a former home of post-abdication King Edward VIII and his wife Wallis Simpson\nGemma described her former boss Fayed to the new BBC investigation as 'a serial rapist'\nRachel, not her real name, told the BBC she was raped after staying at one of Mr Al-Fayed's apartments after a late shift at work.\nShe said: 'I made it obvious that I didn't want that to happen. I did not give consent. I just wanted it to be over.\n'I remember feeling his body on me, the weight of him. Just hearing him make these noises. And just going somewhere else in my head.'\nAnother woman told of being raped at the Mayfair address as a teenager, describing staff at Harrods as being treated as his 'playthings'.\nShe said: 'Mohamed Al-Fayed was a monster, a sexual predator with no moral compass whatsoever.\n'We were all so scared. He actively cultivated fear. If he said 'jump', employees would ask, 'How high?''\nOne of his alleged victims was named as Gemma, who worked for Al-Fayed as a personal assistant between 2007 and 2009 - and tells how his behaviour would turn more scary during work trips abroad.\nShe says he raped her at Villa Windsor in Paris's Bois de Boulogne, a former home of post-abdication King Edward VIII and his wife Wallis Simpson.\nMohamed Al-Fayed, former owner of Harrods and Fulham FC, is pictured here in 2018\nMohamed Al-Fayed pictured alongside Diana, Princess of Wales, at a charity event held at Harrods in London in 1996\nShe described waking up to find him attempting to get into bed with her, adding: 'I told him, 'No, I don't want you to'.\n'And he proceeded to just keep trying to get in the bed, at which point he was kind of on top of me and [I] really couldn't move anywhere.\n'I was kind of face down on the bed and he just pressed himself on me.' She added: 'I think Mohamed Al-Fayed is a rapist - he is a serial rapist.'\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme yesterday, Gemma said she 'didn't feel safe' around Al-Fayed after the attack and said she 'would have been too frightened' to get justice while the tycoon was alive.\nShe claimed Mr Al-Fayed started sexually harassing her 'immediately' after she started her role at his charitable foundation, by making sexual remarks and groping her.\nShe told the Today programme that Mr Al-Fayed tried to come into her room on multiple work trips and spoke of locking herself in rooms and bathrooms and ignoring him when he would come to her door.\nThis was then followed by the alleged rape during a work trip to Paris.\nGemma said he directed her to clean herself afterwards, adding: 'Looking back now I'm older, more mature, I realise that that was probably to cover up anything, any kind of evidence, anything that would have left his trace on me.'\nShe said she felt 'terrified' afterwards.\n'In Paris, there were security guards patrolling the house, there were security guards outside the house, we were locked in a gated property, we'd been escorted there that day by the police, so I felt like I couldn't even go to the police, even if I could make my way out of the property,' she told Radio 4.\n'I couldn't even contemplate leaving the country because he had my passport, so my only way to leave was with him back on that private jet back to London.'\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Woman kills two while speeding just weeks after driving test\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein",
