  "body_text": "I love TV sitcoms, but there are some details about certain characters that I’m still very confused about. Many of the best sitcoms of all time feature a contradiction or two, and this is usually because the writers are so invested in the story that previously established facts are forgotten about.\nWhile many TV show character arcs change for the sake of pushing the story forward, there are things about particular sitcom characters that still don’t make any sense after the fact. Whether it’s a big storyline alteration or simply a small and seemingly inconsequential change, I’m still baffled by these sitcom character details.\n10 Chandler's Hatred Of Dogs\nFriends (1994-2004)\nMonica and Chandler’s relationship in Friends is put to the test when Phoebe sneaks a dog into the apartment. I think season 7’s “The One Where Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs\" is a great filler episode of Friends, but I’m still confused why Chandler makes such a big deal about Clunkers, the pet of Phoebe’s other friends she is keeping an eye on. This is because when Phoebe asks Chandler and Monica to help her babysit three puppies in “The One with Joey's Porsche,” who actually turn out to be Frank and Alice’s triplets, Chandler accepts.\nYour comment has not been saved\nFriends\n- Release Date\n- 1994 - 2004\n- Network\n- NBC\n- Showrunner\n- Marta Kauffman\n- Directors\n- Kevin S. Bright, Gary Halvorson, Michael Lembeck, James Burrows, Gail Mancuso, Peter Bonerz, David Schwimmer, Robby Benson, Shelley Jensen, Terry Hughes, Dana De Vally Piazza, Alan Myerson, Pamela Fryman, Steve Zuckerman, Thomas Schlamme, Roger Christiansen, Sheldon Epps, Arlene Sanford, David Steinberg, Joe Regalbuto, Mary Kay Place, Paul Lazarus, Sam Simon, Todd Holland\nCast\n-\nRachel Green\n-\nMonica Geller\n- Seasons\n- 10\nGranted, his response isn’t as overly enthusiastic as Monica’s, but his nonchalance doesn’t suggest it’s one of Chandler’s biggest fears in Friends. Plus, up until this instance in season 7, everyone believes Chandler is allergic to dogs. Therefore, the fact Phoebe asks, as well as Chandler’s supposed dislike of the animal, means that this moment doesn’t make sense twice over.\n9 Holt Doesn't Have A TV In His Bedroom\nBrooklyn Nine-Nine (2013-2021)\nOne thing I love about Brooklyn Nine-Nine is how solid the character development is. While the characters change as the show progresses, their developments are generally logical. However, I always pick up on the fact Holt states he doesn’t have a TV in his bedroom. This makes total sense for him and Kevin, as that’s the type of people they are.\nExcept, when the squad attends their boss’ birthday celebrations in season 1’s “The Party,” a brilliant Captain Holt-focused episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Amy starts going through the DVR in his bedroom. However, this isn’t even an example of Holt changing. It’d be great if the squad’s influence on Holt, especially Jake’s, convinces him to buy a TV, but this isn’t the case.\nYour comment has not been saved\nBrooklyn Nine-Nine\n- Release Date\n- 2013 - 2021-00-00\n- Network\n- NBC, FOX\n- Showrunner\n- Michael Schur, Dan Goor\n- Directors\n- Michael McDonald, Claire Scanlon, Linda Mendoza, Dean Holland, Beth McCarthy-Miller, Victor Nelli Jr., Craig Zisk, Tristram Shapeero, Rebecca Asher, Eric Appel, Maggie Carey, Alex Reid, Giovani Lampassi, Nisha Ganatra, Ryan Case, Trent O'Donnell, Matt Nodella, Jamie Babbit, Ken Whittingham, Max Winkler, Akiva Schaffer, Fred Goss, Jaffar Mahmood, Julie Anne Robinson\nCast\n-\nJake Peralta\n-\nAmy Santiago\nFrom the creative minds of Dan Goor and Michael Schur comes Brooklyn Nine-Nine, a police comedy series set in the NYPD's fictional 99th precinct. The detectives of \"the 99\" deal with burglaries, drug deals, and oddities in New York City, occasionally steering into real-world issues surrounding police perception and social concerns in the 2010s and earlier.\n- Seasons\n- 8\nHolt states he doesn’t own a television set in the season 2 episode “Beach House,” a good amount of time after “The Party.” Clearly, this is simply a story error, but I like to think that Holt lies about this to appear more cultured, something that causes a strain in his relationship with Kevin and is referenced several times throughout the show.\n8 Donna Not Going To College To Stay With Eric\nThat '70s Show (1998-2006)\nThere are several things about Eric and Donna’s relationship in That '70s Show that infuriate me to a ridiculous level, but the moment I most take issue with is when Donna decides to stay in Point Place rather than go to college. There’s a part of me that understands why she sticks by Eric’s side: she’s young and in love, with hopes for a future together.\nDonna always talks about going to college and working in journalism, so why does she suddenly decide to stay with Eric at the last moment?\nHowever, this choice completely contradicts Donna’s character altogether. The reason why the pair split initially is because of Donna’s independence and her want for a better and well-educated life. Her small yet promising job at the radio station threatens Eric, and she voices during this time that she has no desire to be a housewife and live her life for the sake of him.\n- Release Date\n- 1998 - 2006-00-00\n- Network\n- FOX\n- Showrunner\n- Gregg Mettler\n- Directors\n- David Trainer, Terry Hughes\n- Writers\n- Mark Brazill, Bonnie Turner, Terry Turner\nCast\n-\nTopher Grace\n-\nLaura Prepon\n- Seasons\n- 8\nDonna always talks about going to college and working in journalism, so why does she suddenly decide to stay with Eric at the last moment? Although I get that she wants to support Eric after Red’s heart attack, I never fail to be disappointed when rewatching season 6’s “Magic Bus.”\n7 Penny's Season 12 Pregnancy Storyline\nThe Big Bang Theory (2007-2019)\nThe entire attitude towards Penny and Leonard having kids is easily The Big Bang Theory season 12’s most uncomfortable storyline, from the sperm donation subplot up to the pregnancy reveal in the finale. I continue to be baffled about this arc to this day, and I can’t understand why the writers spend all season covering the topic, only for Penny to accept that she and Leonard are having a child at the very end with little more than a shrug.\nThe Big Bang Theory Finale’s Most Controversial Twist Was Secretly Foreshadowed Four Years Earlier\nThe Big Bang Theory's finale included a controversial fate for one star, but this divisive twist was secretly given away by Sheldon years earlier.\nOf course, I’m sure she has more of a response than this, but it isn’t really delved into on-screen. There’s nothing wrong with Penny changing her mind, but considering how vocal she is about not wanting to be a mother, and the memories of her journey from struggling waitress to successful pharmaceutical sales rep that crops up in every season of The Big Bang Theory, it feels out of place. I find it hard to believe, really, and I wish that the show dedicated more time to her outlook changing.\n6 Troy's Injury\nCommunity (2009-2015)\nTroy’s backstory in Community establishes from the pilot that the reason why the former high school football star attends Greendale is because he loses out on a football scholarship at an esteemed university. Annie mentions Troy dislocates both shoulders while doing a keg-stand, which causes an injury that results in him losing the chance to go to a better college.\nTroy admits to intentionally hurting himself in “Football, Feminism and You” because of the fear of failing, but that isn't the only problem with this. A flashback in season 4’s “Heroic Origins” shows that Troy doesn’t cause his injury on purpose, he simply fakes it, and instead of hurting his shoulders, it’s his knee instead.\nYour comment has not been saved\nCommunity\n- Release Date\n- 2009 - 2015-00-00\n- Network\n- NBC, Yahoo! Screen\n- Showrunner\n- Dan Harmon\n- Directors\n- Tristram Shapeero, Joe Russo, Anthony Russo, Rob Schrab, Jay Chandrasekhar, Adam Davidson, Justin Lin, Steven K. Tsuchida, Kyle Newacheck, Victor Nelli Jr., Nat Faxon, Michael Patrick Jann, Anthony Hemingway, Ken Whittingham, Steven Sprung, Tricia Brock, Jeff Melman, Gail Mancuso, Duke Johnson, Fred Goss, Bobcat Goldthwait, Richard Ayoade, Seth Gordon, Beth McCarthy-Miller\nCast\n-\nJoel McHaleJeff Winger\n-\nBritta Perry\n- Seasons\n- 6\nTechnically, it can be argued that the shoulders narrative comes from Annie, and because she is still in active addiction when witnessing Troy in “Heroic Origins,” she is misremembering the party. However, Troy never corrects anyone in “Football, Feminism and You,” either, nor does he admit to faking it.\n5 Marshall's Fear Of Fighting\nHow I Met Your Mother (2005-2014)\nAn integral part of Marshall’s characterization in How I Met Your Mother is his upbringing in Minnesota, specifically his relationship with his family. Marshall frequently talks about roughhousing with his brothers, and this is demonstrated multiple times throughout the show. For example, the made-up game Baskiceball proves how violent the Erikson clan is, as is the flashback of a newborn Marshall being thrown around the room. However, in the season 1 episode “Sweet Taste of Liberty,” Marshall claims he’s never been in a fight.\nYour comment has not been saved\nHow I Met Your Mother\n- Release Date\n- 2005 - 2014-00-00\n- Network\n- CBS\n- Showrunner\n- Craig Thomas\n- Directors\n- Michael J. Shea\nCast\n-\nTed Mosby\n-\nBarney Stinson\n- Seasons\n- 9\nAfter confronting a man talking to Lily in MacLaren’s, Marshall is relieved to learn the stranger is gay and isn’t hitting on his wife-to-be. While this is only the third episode of How I Met Your Mother, later installments prove that despite Marshall’s generally pacifistic attitude, he knows how to hold himself in a fight. This isn’t only with his brothers, as he also ends up punching Doug in the back alley in “The Fight,” albeit begrudgingly, and he happily slaps Barney in the “Slap Bet” stories, which are some of the best episodes of How I Met Your Mother.\n4 Gooch Is Supposedly Ted's First Girlfriend\nScrubs (2001-2010)\nSam Lloyd’s Ted Buckland in Scrubs contradicts himself several times when discussing his past relationships. He finally seems to have some hope with his love life when he meets Stephanie Gooch, and in season 8’s “My Absence,” Ted tells Turk that Gooch is his first girlfriend. However, this is incorrect, and the quirky ukulele player isn’t even his second romantic partner.\nWhile annoying, I think it’s hilarious Ted fails to remember this properly, and if anything, it makes sense for his character because of how he interacts with women in general.\nThe first four seasons of Scrubs include many mentions of Ted’s wife and his exhaustive marriage to her, which ended when she left him for his brother. In \"My Best Laid Plans,\" he tells the Janitor about his Junior High girlfriend, too, and shares a story about impressing her by posing as her father and renting a car.\nYour comment has not been saved\nScrubs\n- Release Date\n- 2001 - 2010-00-00\n- Showrunner\n- Bill Lawrence\n- Directors\n- Michael Spiller, Chris Koch, Ken Whittingham, Adam Bernstein, Gail Mancuso, Marc Buckland, John Inwood, John Putch, Will Mackenzie, Victor Nelli Jr., Craig Zisk, Lawrence Trilling, Linda Mendoza, Michael McDonald, John Michel, Rick Blue, Richard Alexander Wells, Henry Chan, Joanna Kerns, Mark Stegemann, Matthew Diamond, Peter Lauer, Elodie Keene, Jason Ensler\nCast\n-\nDonald FaisonChristopher Turk\n-\nZach BraffJohn 'J.D.' Dorian\n- Seasons\n- 9\nTed also has a brief fling with an inexperienced cancer patient in \"My Rule of Thumb,\" and even though they only have sex once, presumably, it still counts for something. While annoying, I think it’s hilarious Ted fails to remember this properly, and if anything, it makes sense for his character because of how he interacts with women in general.\n3 Michael's Ability To Ride A Bike\nThe Office (2005-2013)\nFor me, one of The Office’s biggest headscratchers is Michael’s bike-riding ability. In season 3’s \"A Benihana Christmas,\" Michael famously rides a bicycle into the office and shows it off to everyone, wanting to get attention from his employees for donating such a significant gift to the toy drive.\nSteve Carell Candidly Explains Why He Left The Office\nSteve Carell explained why he left The Office, talking about his emotional exit from the sitcom in an interview with his former co-stars.\nHe has zero issue doing this, and considering the limited space in Dunder Mifflin Scranton’s entryway, his skills are pretty impressive (minus the occasional stumble). However, by season 7, Michael has seemingly forgotten how to ride a bike. In “The Sting,” Jim and Pam help teach Michael in the parking lot, using Oscar’s brand-new bike.\nYour comment has not been saved\nThe Office\n- Release Date\n- 2005 - 2013-00-00\n- Network\n- NBC\n- Showrunner\n- Greg Daniels\n- Directors\n- Greg Daniels, Paul Lieberstein, Paul Feig, Randall Einhorn, Ken Kwapis\nCast\n-\nMichael Scott\n-\nDwight Schrute\n- Seasons\n- 9\nThere are several inconsistencies to Michael’s character, but I cannot get my head around this one. His departure storyline is still a while away at this point, so the stress of moving to Colorado can’t be blamed for it. Although it’s an irritating detail, it’s one that makes Steve Carell’s iconic character that much more ridiculous.\n2 Nobody Spots Marcus' Ridiculous Salary While Trying To Save Myrtle's Job\nSuperstore (2015-2021)\nI think Marcus is one of the most underrated and funniest characters in Superstore, and it’s hilarious when he casually shares his wages with Cloud 9’s staff in season 4’s “Salary.” Marcus announces he earns $134,000 a year, naively assuming everyone gets the same amount, and he believes that the minimum wage is $86 per hour. While this is a brilliantly comical moment, it always makes me wonder why this isn’t spotted beforehand, especially when Cloud 9 tries to find a way to get rid of Myrtle in season 3’s “District Manager.”\nYour comment has not been saved\nSuperstore\n- Release Date\n- 2015 - 2021\n- Network\n- NBC\n- Directors\n- Victor Nelli Jr., Ken Whittingham, Ruben Fleischer, Betsy Thomas, Matt Sohn, Ross Novie, America Ferrera, Charles Stone III, Jeffrey Blitz, Mark McKinney, Geeta Patel, Phil Traill, Ryan Case, Todd Biermann, James Renfroe, Amy York Rubin, Jay Hunter, Kabir Akhtar\n- Writers\n- Owen Ellickson, Bridget Kyle, John Kazlauskas, Alessandro Tanaka, Laura McCreary, Brian Gatewood, Josh Malmuth, Rene Gube, Matt Lawton, Dayo Adesokan, Aaron Lee, Colton Dunn, Justin Shanes, L.E. Correia\nCast\n-\nBen FeldmanJonah Simms\n-\nLauren AshDina Fox\n- Seasons\n- 6\nThere is roughly only a season between these two episodes, and surely Amy and Jonah would see Marcus’ salary while combing through the store’s finances to find room in the budget and save Myrtle’s job? Amy hires Myrtle as her assistant in “Salary” after she is ultimately fired in “District Manager,” too, and the older woman’s presence should be enough to remind them of this fact.\n1 Claire and Phil's First Meeting\nModern Family (2009-2020)\nWhen Phil and Claire Dunphy are introduced in Modern Family’s pilot, they have been married for 16 years. There are a few questions about Claire and Phil’s relationship in Modern Family that crop up throughout the show, but one that audiences continue to ask is: how did the pair actually meet? It’s known that they originally meet during their college years, but the details of their first interaction are rather blurry and change at points.\nYour comment has not been saved\nModern Family\n- Release Date\n- 2009 - 2020\n- Network\n- ABC\n- Showrunner\n- Christopher Lloyd, Steven Levitan\n- Directors\n- Gail Mancuso, Steven Levitan, Beth McCarthy-Miller, Jason Winer, Michael Spiller, James Alan Hensz, Fred Savage, Chris Koch, Jeffrey Walker, Ryan Case, Randall Einhorn, Eric Dean Seaton, Scott Ellis, Bryan Cranston, John Riggi, Julie Bowen, Ken Whittingham, Reginald Hudlin, Iwona Sapienza, Elaine Ko, Helena Lamb, Adam Shankman, Claire Scanlon, Dean Parisot\nCast\n-\nJay Pritchett\n-\nSofía VergaraGloria Delgado-Pritchett\n- Seasons\n- 11\nIn season 5, Phil states that he and Claire met at a concert. However, in season 8’s “Do You Believe in Magic,” one of Modern Family’s funniest episodes, Phil tells Alex that their first meeting involved Claire hitting him with her car while breakdancing in a KFC parking lot. While there’s a chance there’s an overlap with these two events, initially crossing paths in the parking lot and later reuniting at the concert, Modern Family doesn’t explain this very well.",
