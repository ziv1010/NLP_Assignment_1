Fast-forward to 2025, and it is hard to imagine the Lionesses without their youngest member.\nSo who is Michelle Agyemang, and how has she risen so quickly through the football ranks?\nA Young Lioness with an eye for goal\nBorn in South Ockendon, Essex, in 2006, Agyemang grew up as a fan of Arsenal and joined the north London team at the age of six.\nIn 2022, aged 16, she made her debut for Arsenal in a 4-0 win over Leicester City in the Women's Super League.\nShe made six appearances and scored her first and only goal for the club against Leeds in the Women's FA Cup before going on loan to Championship side Watford for the 2023/24 season.\nAgyemang spent last season with Brighton and Hove Albion in the Women's Super League.\nShe scored five goals in 22 appearances for Brighton and won the side's Young Player of the Year award.\nAgyemang has now returned to Arsenal ahead of the new season.\nAt around the time of her Arsenal debut she also started as a Young Lioness, having first been called up to represent her country in the Women's Under-16s squad.\nShe scored an impressive 10 goals in 12 appearances for the WU17s before making the step-up to the WU19s.\nThe call-up from Wiegman\nIn April this year Agyemang was called up to England women's senior squad for the first time.\nEarlier the same week, she had helped the WU19s qualify for the European Women's Under-19 Championship in Poland.\nShe got her debut in the Lionesses' UEFA Women's Nations League clash against Belgium in Leuven, scoring a stunning goal after just 41 seconds on the pitch.\nDespite her best efforts, the team lost 3-2, but it was undoubtedly her stand-out performance that secured her a place in Weigman's 23-player squad for Euro 2025 in Switzerland.\n'Surreal' first senior tournament\nAgyemang's success on the pitch has continued into Euro 2025.\nDespite a loss to France in England's first match in the tournament, the team's campaign got into gear with wins over the Netherlands and Wales, which sent them through to the knock-out stages.\nIt was during England's quarter-final showdown against Sweden that Agyemang truly proved her worth, coming off the bench and levelling the game in the 81st minute, England's second goal in three minutes to draw level with the Swedes.\n\"[It was] surreal,\" Agyemang told England Football after the quarter-final.\n\"Throughout the game itself I was quite calm. We had a lot of momentum, especially in the last stages of the game, but the penalties were nerve-wracking and I was going to be next, which was quite scary.\n\"I just wanted to take the opportunity, when I came on. It's a great privilege to be here and to even get on the pitch was surreal. I was grateful to Sarina and I thank God for the opportunity.\"\nAgyemang was at it again in the semi-final. In the 96th minute, with England's hopes fading in the face of fierce Italian resistance, the ball fell to the super-sub in the box and she sent it flying into the back of the net.\nAnd if that wasn't enough, Agyemang almost won the game herself in extra time, hitting the bar with an audacious lob in the 116th minute.\nIt was Chloe Kelly who won the game in the end, slotting in her follow-up after the Italy keeper Laura Giuliani saved her initial penalty.\nOn Sunday's final, all eyes will undoubtedly be on the youngster.\nRead more:\nThe comeback queens - these Lionesses never give in\n\"She has something special,\" Wiegman said of Agyemang. \"She's only 19-years-old, she's very mature, she knows exactly what she has to do.\n\"When you talk about little things that she picks up straight away, because she's not only in the 18-yard box very dangerous but when we have to go to her as a target player, she keeps the ball really well too.\n\"Even when you saw her shot hit the crossbar, that was not just a shot, she was aiming for it. If she continues like this she has a very bright future.\"",
