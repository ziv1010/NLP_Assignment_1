As he made his way onto the field, Kelce shook hands with some fans before warmly greeting Browns defensive end Myles Garrett and quarterback Deshaun Watson.\nOnce in the batter’s box, Kelce, who played high school baseball, put on an impressive performance. After connecting on his final swing and sending another ball over the fence to clinch the win, Kelce flipped his bat in celebration and took a victory lap around the bases.\nHe was awarded a trophy he’ll be able to show to Swift, who is performing concerts in Scotland this weekend.\nALSO READ: Report: BJ Thompson released from hospital following cardiac arrest incident\nA three-time Super Bowl champion, Kelce has become close in recent years with Njoku, who has attended his offseason Tight End University.\n“That’s my guy, man,” Njoku said. “He’s one of the purest human beings I’ve met in my life honestly.
