  "body_text": "We’re delighted to announce that our head coach Renée Slegers has signed a new long-term contract with the club until 2029.\nRenée was appointed head coach on a permanent basis in January 2025 and led us to a historic UEFA Women’s Champions League victory four months later.\nThe 36-year-old Dutchwoman has been at the club since the summer of 2023, when she joined as assistant coach, following a two-year spell in charge of Rosengard. There, she’d won back-to-back Swedish league titles in 2021 and 2022.\nRenée became interim head coach at Arsenal in October 2024 and oversaw an 11-match unbeaten run before being appointed on a permanent basis. We ended the 2024/25 season in second place in the Barclays Women’s Super League – our highest finish in three years – and remain unbeaten at home in the WSL under Renée.\nRenée masterminded a thrilling run in the UEFA Women’s Champions League last season, as we defeated Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and eight-time winners OL Lyonnes on the way to the final in Lisbon in May 2025. In front of nearly 5,000 Arsenal supporters at the Estadio Jose Alvalade, we defeated two-time reigning champions FC Barcelona 1-0 to lift the trophy and deliver a moment of history for our club.\n“From playing in the academy and being in the stands watching Arsenal win the Champions League in 2007, to living it with our players, staff and supporters last summer, I’m immensely proud to have shared this journey with Arsenal, a club that means so much to me and to so many people,” said Renée.\n“I’m delighted to have signed a new contract here, as I believe we have so much to achieve together – this season and in the years to come. I’d like to show my gratitude to our supporters for the incredible backing you give us, whether it’s at Emirates Stadium, Meadow Park or on the road. We hear it, we see it and we feel it every day.”\nDirector of Women’s Football, Clare Wheatley, added: “We’re delighted Renée has signed a new long-term contract with us. Since taking over, first on an interim basis and then as our permanent head coach, Renée has proved to be an elite coach with the capabilities to lead us as we continue to challenge to win major trophies. Together with our supporters, we look forward to continuing our successful journey with Renée in the years to come.”\nChief Executive Officer, Richard Garlick, said: “Renée has already achieved great things as our head coach, leading us to our second Champions League title in her first season in charge. Beyond this, Renée has embraced the values and ambitions of Arsenal, driving standards and progress as we aim to compete consistently at the top of the women's game. We now look ahead to an exciting second half of the season, with five trophies to play for. Our huge congratulations to Renée and her family.\"\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
