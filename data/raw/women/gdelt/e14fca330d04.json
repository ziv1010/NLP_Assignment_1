  "body_text": "The sounds of excited fans from Howard and Hampton Universities filled Southwest D.C. as people gathered at Audi Field for the Truth and Service Classic, better known as the “Battle of the Real HU” on Sept. 20.\nMore than a football game between longtime rivals, the annual meetup between Howard in Northwest D.C. and Hampton in Hampton Roads, Virginia, is an event showcasing African American excellence, camaraderie and pride, featuring two historically Black institutions.\nPirate fans chanted “Hampton, Hampton the Real HU,” as Bison supporters countered by yelling “Howard, Howard, the Real HU.”\nIn the friendly battle, Howard walked away victorious this year, winning 34-7, ending the eight-game hex that Hampton held over them, and continuing to celebrate the university’s 100th anniversary.\n“It is great for both institutions,” said Howard University coach Larry Scott, emphasizing the importance of showcasing historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), before adding some Bison pride. “It is all about Truth and Service and that is actually a part of the Howard brand. And to have it here in Washington, D.C. adds to the mystique.”\n‘A Great Team Effort‘\nHampton went into this year’s game having prevailed in the last eight meetings between the institutions and boasting a 55-43-1 advantage.\nFurther, the last three meetings have been decided by a total of 11 points with the Pirates each time finding a way to win.\nWith 20,000 fans filling Audi Field to capacity, Howard jumped out to the early 7-0 lead on its first possession and led 34-0 in the second half before Hampton was finally able to get on the board.\nThe key to the victory was Howard’s balanced offense and its strong complementary defense.\nThe individual hero of the game for Howard’s offense was sophomore running back Travis Kerney, who rushed for a career-high 113 yards and two touchdowns. Further, Kerney benefited from an offensive line that featured four new starters, who helped the Bison rush for a season-high 274 yards and four touchdowns.\n“A lot of credit goes to the O-line because they did a great job today,” said Kerney. “They opened holes and made it easy for the backs. Tyriq [Starks] also called a great game. It’s been a little rough but we are beginning to get good chemistry.”\nA transfer from Florida Atlantic University, quarterback Starks, continues to improve with his play. In the Truth and Service Classic, he completed 12-of-15 for 165 yards and although he did not throw a touchdown, he spread the ball around, connecting with eight different receivers.\nKnown for its high-powered attack, the Hampton offense struggled against the Howard defense that held them to only 215 yards of total offense, which included seven tackles for negative yards and three quarterback sacks.\nHoward’s Kedrick Green had eight tackles and a key interception return and Jaquavion Smith also contributed with seven tackles and two sacks. Each had outstanding individual performances, but the Bison defense as a whole tackled well and refused to allow the Pirates any consistency on offense.\n“It was a great team effort on defense,” Green said. “Everyone on the field contributed. We were flying around the ball and everyone was focused. We have multiple people on defense who can make plays.”\n‘It’s All About HBCU Pride’\nOver the years, the rivalry between Howard and Hampton has been part of the student experience at each university.\nFrom the first game in 1908, which ended in a 2-0 forfeit by Hampton, the series has continued with both schools claiming victory streaks at various times.\nKeith Pough, a former NFL athlete and Howard standout, played in four matchups against Hampton during his tenure as a Bison from 2008-2012.\n“The great thing about this is that it is a healthy rival,” said Pough, who attended the game. “Howard and Hampton both have strong academic traditions, having produced some of the top African-American leaders in the history of this country.”\nToday, the Battle of the Real HU goes beyond football and includes other sports.\nIn August, the women’s soccer teams met at Audi Field where Howard prevailed, 4-1 and in December, the two will square off in a men’s and women’s basketball doubleheader at the CareFirst Arena in Southeast D.C.\n“The rivalry aspect is healthy and it gives the alumni and students something to rally around,” Pough continued. “But at the end of the day, it is all about HBCU pride.”",
