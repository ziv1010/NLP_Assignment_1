  "body_text": "Women’s World Cup 2023 LIVE: Spain set to begin tournament against Costa Rica after hosts win\nSteph Catley’s penalty earned co-hosts Australia a narrow victory over the Republic of Ireland in front of a record home crowd after captain Sam Kerr was ruled out of their first two matches at the Women’s World Cup due to injury.\nCatley took the armband from Kerr after the star forward was sidelined by a calf injury picked up in training on the day before the tournament, and the stand-in skipper converted a second-half spot-kick to ensure Australia made a winning start to the World Cup in front of over 75,000 fans at the Sydney Olympic Stadium.\nEarlier, co-hosts New Zealand claimed their first ever World Cup win, at their 16th attempt, as Hannah Wilkinson’s goal shocked group favourites Norway at a sold-out Eden Park. It was also a record attendance for New Zealand, men’s or women’s, with a crowd of over 45,000 there to celebrate a historic victory at the tournament.\nThe kick-off to the World Cup came just hours after a mass shooting in Auckland that killed two people and wounded six. But the World Cup will “proceed as planned” and New Zealand prime minister Chris Hipkins said there was no risk to national security.\nFollow the latest World Cup scores, updates and news in today’s live blog\nWomen’s World Cup 2023 LIVE: Latest scores and updates\nWomen’s World Cup 2023 under way in New Zealand and Australia\nWomen’s World Cup to ‘proceed as planned’ after shooting in Auckland on eve of tournament\nAustralia defeat Republic of Ireland despite injury to star Sam Kerr in training\nGOAL!

The New Zealand captain had waited more than most, winless at her four previous World Cups, part of a run that stretched back even further than that. Without a victory in 15 attempts at the tournament, New Zealand entered their own World Cup with unwanted history hanging over them. Facing Norway in their opening match, that winless run was expected to continue.\nHow Hannah Wilkinson’s goal changed that. In a stunning upset, New Zealand altered the narrative, providing the World Cup with its first shock that will ripple not just in Group A but throughout the tournament. With a victory in their most difficult game of the group stages, New Zealand can now set their sights higher and target a place in the knockouts. They will have momentum on their side when they face Switzerland and the Philippines.\nSuch moments can change expectations, as well as perceptions.\nNew Zealand’s historic moment gives Women’s World Cup the spark it needed\nJitka Klimkova: New Zealand squad stayed calm after hearing of Auckland shooting\n19:15 , Mike Jones\nBoss Jitka Klimkova revealed all remained calm in advance of New Zealand’s 1-0 victory over Norway which opened the Women’s World Cup in Auckland, where a fatal shooting took place on Thursday morning.\nThe incident, which occurred in the city’s central business district close to Norway’s team hotel, resulted in three deaths – including that of the suspected gunman – with more wounded in what New Zealand Police characterised as an “isolated incident” and “not a national security risk”.\nFIFA said a decision was taken to proceed with the match as planned after consulting with New Zealand authorities and the participating teams, who observed a moment of silence for the victims before the tournament kicked off at Eden Park.\nNew Zealand squad stayed calm after hearing of Auckland shooting\nAustralia star Sam Kerr ruled out of Women’s World Cup opener after injury blow\n19:00 , Mike Jones\nAustralia star Sam Kerr has been ruled out of her country’s first two matches at the Women’s World Cup in what is a huge blow to the tournament co-hosts.\nThe Chelsea striker suffered a calf injury in training the day before the start of the tournament.\nAustralia play their opening match against the Republic of Ireland in Sydney on Thursday night, while Kerr has also been ruled out of their Group B clash with Nigeria next week.\nAustralia star Sam Kerr ruled out of Women’s World Cup opener after injury blow\nLionesses train in Brisbane as preparations for opening match continue\n18:54 , Mike Jones\nEngland’s Lionesses have been taking part in private training sessions as preparations for their Women’s World Cup campaign continue in Queensland’s capital city, Brisbane.\nOn the eve of the tournament, Sarina Wiegman’s squad hit out at the Football Association for failing to agree a bonus structure with players.\nIn a statement signed by every single member of the 25-player squad, the Lionesses said they are putting negotiations on hold but will revisit the issue after the tournament.\nLionesses train in Brisbane as preparations continue for Women’s World Cup\nPlayers to watch\n18:48 , Mike Jones\nGroup H\nGermany: Alexandra Popp became the first player in Euros history to score in five consecutive games before her story took an unexpected twist, with injury ruling the 32-year-old out of the final against England. The Wolfsburg striker, who is driven by goals, is among the contenders for the golden boot.\nMorocco: Ghizlane Chebba was named player of the tournament as Morocco reached the final of the women’s Africa Cup of Nations for the first time, where they lost to South Africa. The 32-year-old scored three goals during the tournament and the captain of the Morocco team has become a star in her country.\nColombia: The rise of Linda Caicedo has been extraordinary. The 18-year-old is set to star in the World Cup having played in both of the U-17 and U-20 World Cups in 2022, as well as the Copa America. There, Caicedo won the tournament’s Golden Ball and helped Colombia reach the final, before a big move to Europe beckoned. The midfielder chose Real Madrid, who have secured one of the biggest talents in the game.\nSouth Korea: Ji So-Yun was hailed as an “icon”, a “magician” and the “best international player in the WSL ever” by Chelsea manager Emma Hayes after she made the decision to bring eight years with the Blues to an end in 2022. Ji’s impact on Chelsea’s success under Hayes was clear, but the creative midfielder has created an even finer legacy in her own country. Ji is South Korea’s greatest ever player and record scorer, and this is set to be her last World Cup.\nPlayers to watch\n18:42 , Mike Jones\nGroup G\nSweden: Converted into a left back by Barcelona, Fridolina Rolfo remains one of the most dangerous players in the world and is given full licence to attack by her national team. With a brilliant left foot and engine, Rolfo comes into the World Cup on a high after scoring the winning goal in last season’s Champions League final.\nSouth Africa: With key forward Thembi Kgatlana injured, Hildah Magaia scored a clinical brace as South Africa beat Morocco to win the women’s Africa Cup of Nations, their first major title. Magaia was also named player of the tournament and will be key to their hopes in Group G.\nItaly: Barbara Bonansea. The Juventus forward is a quality outlet on the wings and remains from the Italy team that reached the quarter-finals in France four years ago. The 32-year-old Bonansea has overseen a period of change this then, with the Italy domestic league turning professional in 2022 and a new generation coming through, but she remains just as important to her side.\nArgentina: Estefania Banini is a star for Atletico Madrid in Spain and made the FifPro World XI in 2021. The tricky wide midfielder has returned from injury a previous falling out with the national team and is set to be fit for what is expected to be her last World Cup at the age of 33.\nPlayers to watch\n18:36 , Mike Jones\nGroup F\nFrance: With Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Delphine Cascarino out of the World Cup due to injury, more emphasis and responsibility will be placed on the shoulders of Kadidiatou Diani. The PSG forward, who can play across the front line, will need to support the returning Eugenie Le Sommer, France’s record goalscorer.\nBrazil: While Marta is very much the leader and inspiration in the Brazil team, keep an eye on the Barcelona forward Geyse, who troubled England in April with her quick turning and dribbling. Geyse has been linked with a move to the WSL and Manchester United in recent weeks.\nJamaica: Khadija ‘Bunny’ Shaw scored 20 goals in 22 appearances in the Women’s Super League last season, second only to England’s Rachel Daly, and the Manchester City striker is a shining light in the Jamaica team. Shaw thrives on the responsibility. She is Jamaica’s record scorer, men’s or women’s, and her goals secured qualification to a second consecutive World Cup.\nPanama: Marta Cox is the captain of the side and stands as the inspirational force behind Panama’s qualification for the World Cup. The 25-year-old midfielder dedicated Panama’s victory against Paraguay in the inter-continental qualifiers to her late mother, who had passed away nine months earlier.\nPlayers to watch\n18:30 , Mike Jones\nGroup E\nUSA: Alex Morgan, the face of the US team and joint top scorer in France four years ago, is back for her fourth World Cup, arguably better than ever. Since helping the US to back-to-back titles, Morgan has given birth to her first child and at 33 is still scoring regularly in the NWSL.\nNetherlands: With Vivianne Miedema ruled out with an ACL injury, the Netherlands will turn to a relatively unknown prospect for goals. Fenna Kalma only made her international debut in September but comes into the World Cup having scored 30 goals in just 20 appearances for FC Twente last season.\nPortugal: Jessica Silva is a baller who belongs on the World Cup stage. The Benfica forward has a tall and languid style but is devastating on the ball and is one of the most skillful attackers in the game.\nVietnam: As the only player in the Vietnam squad to play their football outside of the country and in Europe, striker Huynh Nhu will be familiar with some of her Group E rivals. The 32-year-old, who is Vietnam’s record goalscorer, plays for Portuguese side Lank Vilaverdense.\nPlayers to watch\n18:24 , Mike Jones\nGroup D\nEngland: Keira Walsh was the player of the match in the Euros final and remains England’s most important player with her ability to set the team’s pace and tempo in midfield. Walsh moved to Barcelona last summer for what was said to be a world-record fee and after winning the Champions League on her first season at the club, the 26-year-old has returned to the Lionesses to set higher standards.\nDenmark: Pernille Harder is one of the top players in the world and will be a familiar face to England fans after three successful seasons spent in the Women’s Super League with Chelsea, who she joined for a world-record fee in 2020. The skillful and tireless attacker leads the line for Denmark, who cannot afford to leave her isolated. One of the game’s most decorated players, Harder will be making her World Cup debut.\nChina: Captain Wang Shanshan is a wonder: a veteran striker with a tendency to score crucial goals, the 33-year-old can also help out defensively by playing at centre-back for the team.\nHaiti: There is considerable excitement around the 19-year-old Melchie Dumornay, who has signed a pre-contract with European powerhouse Lyon ahead of the new season. The midfielder scored twice as Haiti beat Chile in the inter-continental play-offs to qualify for the World Cup and is regarded as one of the best young players in the world.\nPlayers to watch\n18:18 , Mike Jones\nGroup C\nSpain: Aitana Bonmati. When an ACL injury robbed two-time Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas of the chance to play at the Euros last summer and then took away almost all of the following season, it handed her international and club team-mate Bonmati the opportunity to play further forward for Barcelona. How she took it. Arguably the best player in the world over the past year.\nJapan: Yui Hasegawa. Signed by Manchester City last summer to replace England’s Keira Walsh, the 26-year-old impressed with her class and composure on the ball and tenacity in midfield, finishing the season as one of the top performers in the Women’s Super League. Japan will rely on Hasegawa to set their tempo from the middle of the pitch.\nZambia: Barbra Banda made history at the 2021 Olympics when she became the first player to score back-to-back hat-tricks at the Games. The 23-year-old is captain of the Zambia side and is key to their chances of making it out of the group, as her stunning two-goal display against Germany before the tournament showed.\nCosta Rica: Raquel Rodriguez is Costa Rica’s record scorer with 55 goals, including the country’s first at a World Cup on their only previous appearance in 2015. The Portland Thorns midfielder, who has won over 100 caps for Costa Rica, has urged her team-mates to battle with passion and commitment as they look to claim a first-ever World Cup win.\nPlayers to watch\n18:12 , Mike Jones\nGroup B\nAustralia: There’s no question about this. Sam Kerr is the face of the World Cup and the star of the Australia team. As the most lethal striker in the world, who always seems to deliver on the big occasion, the Chelsea forward could be the difference for the Matildas as they look to advance past the quarter-finals for the first time. The 29-year-old makes the hosts a genuine contender.\nCanada: Christine Sinclair has been setting records for most of her life. At 40, and now into the 22nd year of her international career, the striker is set to become the first player to play at six World Cups - although Brazil’s Marta could later equal that record this tournament. In Australia, Sinclair and Marta also have the chance to become the first player to score at six different World Cups.\nNigeria: Asisat Oshoala doesn’t just have a claim to be the greatest African player in the world, but the best of all time. The Nigeria striker and Barcelona star has won the African player of the year award four times and has hit at least 20 goals in each of her last two seasons in Spain. The Super Falcons may have been drawn in the group of death, but Oshoala will be a threat to both Australia and Canada.\nIreland: Katie McCabe. The Arsenal fan favourite famously wears her heart on her sleeve and embodies what Ireland will require in Australia: defensive nous, aggression, a lot of effort, and quality when it counts. McCabe has it all and alongside Denise O’Sullivan will be key.\nPlayers to watch\n18:05 , Mike Jones\nGroup A\nNew Zealand: If New Zealand are going to need something special to break their cycle of World Cup disappointment on home soil, don’t be surprised if they are inspired by the fearlessness of youth. The Football Ferns finished an impressive third at the Under-17 World Cup five years ago and striker Gabi Rennie, the team’s No 9, is a breakthrough prospect.\nNorway: It’s a testament to the skill, speed and elusiveness of Barcelona’s Caroline Graham Hansen that Guro Reiten isn’t even the most dangerous winger on the Norway team. Arguably the best dribbler in the game, the 28-year-old took a break from the international side following the Euros last summer but is now back to best - as Chelsea once again found out in this season’s Champions League.\nSwitzerland: The smooth and composed Lia Walti draws the eye in the centre of midfield and the captain is the pillar of the side. “Lia is such a magnetic player. Everyone passes to her,” said the Switzerland head coach Inka Grings. “She always demands the ball and, when she has it, it sticks to her feet.”\nPhilippines: Sarina Bolden took the most important kick in the history of the Philippines with the winning penalty against Chinese Taipei that secured their qualification for the World Cup. The Philippines will need more moments of history to make an impact in New Zealand.\nEngland’s Lionesses park controversial bonus row on eve of Women’s World Cup\n17:58 , Mike Jones\nThe England women’s team took the decision to pause controversial negotiations over World Cup bonuses in order to show it was “on their terms”, but also make clear their anger and disappointment with the Football Association over an issue that could have developed into a huge distraction on the eve of the tournament.\nThere is similarly a determination the issue isn’t parked once the competition ends, and that the federation have got the message over how payment structures need to be clarified going forward.\nThere has still been some debate over the merits of the strategy, particularly as the FA had already been insistent that all discussions be delayed until after the campaign. While that could be seen as bending to what the association want, there is also the risk now that the England squad lose their leverage in the event of going out of the competition unexpectedly early.\nEngland park controversial bonus row on eve of Women’s World Cup\nEngland’s World Cup hinges on a defining question\n17:38 , Mike Jones\nSince arriving in Australia, Sarina Wiegman has stepped up work on a new system, that may not even be unveiled until the knock-out stages. It is an inherent acknowledgement that England are no longer in the strong position they were, but simultaneously something that may yet prove the winning of this World Cup.\nThis has been reflected in the mood of the camp in Australia, beyond the distraction over bonuses. There is certainly no lack of faith, especially in Wiegman’s ability to come up with something special. This is another benefit of a feat like the Euro 2022 victory. It banishes doubts, and fosters that immensely powerful feeling that everything will go well because the manager knows exactly what they are doing. It is why big games, as in that juncture quarter-final win over Spain, can almost seem like they will go exactly as Wiegman predicts.\nThere’s also the fact that, right now, the manager has one of the most talented teams in the world. For so long, this has seemed like the moment England were long building up to.\nThe question now is whether that moment just comes at the wrong time.\nEngland’s World Cup hinges on a defining question\nWomen’s World Cup teams: Every squad and key players to watch\n17:28 , Mike Jones\nThe Women’s World Cup is finally here as the biggest tournament ever kicks off in Australia and New Zealand.\nThe first 32-team Women’s World Cup is set to be one of the most open yet, with a host of teams challenging to dethrone the two-time defending champions United States.\nEngland head ‘Down Under’ full of belief after their Euros success on home soil last summer, but that is also set to inspire co-hosts Australia and their star forward Sam Kerr.\nHere’s everything you need to know ahead of the 2023 Women’s World Cup, including group guides, players to watch, and how to follow on TV .\nWomen’s World Cup teams: Every squad and key players to watch\nRachel Daly or Alessia Russo for England? I know who I would start at the World Cup\n17:19 , Mike Jones\nKelly Smith explains who she thinks will lead the line for England in their opening match agains Haiti writing:\n‘Tournament football is about solving problems, quickly and effectively. While Sarina Wiegman, assistant Arjan Veurink, and the rest of the coaching team will be devising plans to see off England’s World Cup opponents, a lot comes down to how teams react on the pitch to what is in front of them.\n‘That is especially true when facing teams who want to sit deep against a team of England’s undoubted strength, where unlocking packed back lines with 10 or 11 behind the ball will be crucial.\n‘Against cautious opponents – which is what England will face in the group stage when they play Haiti, Denmark and China – taking chances is the key. Scoring not only puts you up, but it also alters the stage of the game, it will invite the opposition forwards to try to get one back, and there is the psychological impact. There is nothing more disheartening than defending superbly for 20 or 30 minutes and then conceding from the first real opportunity...’\nKelly Smith: Rachel Daly or Alessia Russo for England? I know who I would start\nCourtney Brosnan says playing for Republic gives her ‘connection’ to family\n17:13 , Mike Jones\nGoalkeeper Courtney Brosnan is certain her grandparents would be beaming with pride had they had lived long enough to see her play in the Republic of Ireland’s World Cup debut.\nThe Girls in Green kick off their campaign against tournament co-hosts Australia at 1100 BST in front of a sold-out crowd at Stadium Australia after demand forced organisers to relocate the meeting to the competition’s largest venue.\nThe Everton keeper is eligible for the Republic through her paternal grandparents Margaret and Brendan, who were born in Roscommon and Kerry but later emigrated to the United States, where Brosnan was born and raised.\nCourtney Brosnan says playing for Republic gives her ‘connection’ to family\nWho are the threats to the Lionesses at the Women’s World Cup?\n17:06 , Mike Jones\nHaiti\nThere is considerable excitement around the 19-year-old Melchie Dumornay, who has signed a pre-contract with European powerhouse Lyon ahead of the new season.\nThe midfielder scored twice as Haiti beat Chile in the inter-continental play-offs to qualify for the World Cup and is regarded as one of the best young players in the world. “You can’t compare Melchie with any other player, she’s special,” team-mate Jennyfer Limage told Fifa.\nHaiti have nothing to lose on their World Cup debut and with players such as the exciting Dumornay, they have the talent to cause an upset if they can balance their ambition with defence organisation.\nFrenchman Nicolas Delepine helped spark scenes of national celebration when Haiti qualified for their first ever World Cup by beating Chile in the play-off final.\nWith the majority of the Haiti team already playing France, Delepine took the job from French club Grenoble Foot 38 and wants his team to play quick, attacking football.\nWho are the threats to the Lionesses at the Women’s World Cup?\n17:00 , Mike Jones\nChina\nShui Qingxia took charge of China after the 2021 Olympics and led China to victory in the 2022 Asian Cup, where they beat Korea Republic in the final and Japan in the semis.\nA former midfielder who won five Asian Cups and the Olympic silver medal as a player, Qingxia is China’s first female coach and has brought glory back to the team as manager. She admitted that their European opponents in Group D are ahead of China, but their Asian Cup win should give them confidence.\nChina reached the World Cup final in 1999 during the team’s golden era, where they lost to the United States.\nChina’s captain Wang Shanshan is a wonder: a veteran striker with a tendency to score crucial goals, the 33-year-old can also help out defensively by playing at centre-back for the team.\nWho are the threats to the Lionesses at the Women’s World Cup?\n16:54 , Mike Jones\nDenmark\nDenmark will be making their first appearance at a Women’s World Cup since 2007 and will be desperate to make up for lost time. They will hope to test England in Group D and challenge for a place in the last-16.\nHead coach Lars Søndergaard will say goodbye to Denmark after the World Cup after seven years in charge but the team have had their confidence boosted by recent wins against Norway, Japan and Sweden. Søndergaard, who asks his side to sit deep before breaking on the counter-attack, preferes to field a 3-4-3 formation that can switch to 4-3-3 during sustained attacks.\nMeanwhile, Pernille Harder is one of the top players in the world and will be a familiar face to England fans after three successful seasons spent in the Women’s Super League with Chelsea, who she joined for a world-record fee in 2020.\nThe skillful and tireless attacker leads the line for Denmark, who cannot afford to leave her isolated. One of the game’s most decorated players, Harder will be making her World Cup debut.\nEngland World Cup Fixtures: Full Lionesses schedule and route to the final\n16:48 , Mike Jones\nEngland enter the World Cup as one of the favourites as the Lionesses look to build on their victory at the European Championships last summer by winning the game’s biggest prize.\nEngland have reached the semi-finals on their last two World Cup appearances in 2015 and 2019 and will be dreaming of going one step further in Australia and New Zealand.\nThe Lionesses gained valuable experience of winning a major title after their historic victory on home soil at the Euros under Sarina Wiegman.\nThe United States are looking to win their third consecutive World Cup but England arrive at this summer’s tournament as the main contenders to their crown.\nHere’s everything you need to know.\nEngland Women World Cup Fixtures: Full Lionesses schedule and route to the final\nFIFA Women’s World Cup fixtures and full schedule\n16:41 , Mike Jones\nAfter winning the European Championships on home soil last summer, England travel to Australia and New Zealand as one of the favourites to win the Women’s World Cup.\nThe Lionesses defeated Germany at a sold-out Wembley last year and have positioned themselves as one of the strongest teams in the world under Sarina Wiegman.\nThe United States have won the past two World Cups and are the defending champions after beating the Netherlands - who were coached by Wiegman - at the 2019 World Cup in France. The Lionesses reached the semi-finals for the second World Cup in a row, only to lose to the USA, but will be looking to go a step further this time.\nFIFA Women’s World Cup fixtures and full schedule\nToday at the World Cup\n16:33 , Mike Jones\nBattling display from Irish debutants\nThe Matildas were expected to have an easier ride than their co-hosts, but Ireland were in no mood to offer safe passage towards three points on their World Cup debut in Sydney.\nIt took a second-half penalty from Steph Catley to see off Vera Pauw’s newcomers, after Marissa Sheva shoved Hayley Raso to the ground.\nAustralia were missing Sam Kerr with the Chelsea forward also set to be absent for the next game against Nigeria, and struggled to break down the Republic during a first half of few chances.\nIreland manager Vera Pauw said: “Sam Kerr is of course one of, if not the top striker in the world so the fact that she did not play was a surprise for us but Australia have so many fast and attacking players that our game plan did not change because of that.”\nToday at the World Cup\n16:26 , Mike Jones\nNew Zealand stun Norway\nExpectations for 1995 champions Norway are not what they once were, particularly in the wake of a group stage exit at Euro 2022 and an 8-0 mauling at the hands of England, but few anticipated them to fall to New Zealand at Eden Park.\nBut Jitka Klimkova’s underdogs delivered a memorable curtain raiser thanks to Hannah Wilkinson’s 48th-minute goal in front of more than 42,000 ecstatic supporters, a record for a football match in the country\nIt was the team’s 16th attempt at winning a match at the finals and could have been made sweeter had Ria Percival not struck a post from the penalty spot late on after handball was given against Tuva Hansen.\n“The expectations, we will put those on ourselves first,” said goalscorer Wilkinson. “We’ll take momentum from this first win into the next game.\n“It’s incredibly important that we secure a space outside of this group and we can do that in this next game.”\nWho is the team to beat at the Women’s World Cup?\n16:18 , Mike Jones\nThe United States remain the team to beat ahead of the Women’s World Cup and the two-time defending champions remain number one in the Fifa rankings ahead of the tournament.\nThe USA are looking to become the first country to win three World Cups in a row and have held top spot since 2017.\nBut the tournament in Australia and New Zealand could bring a shake-up to the order. Europe is catching up and the likes of England, Germany, France and Spain will be coming for the USA’s crown.\nZambia come into the World Cup as the lowest-ranked team at the tournament, which is hosting 32 teams for the first time.\nWhy Australia’s Women’s World Cup opener felt different\n16:11 , Mike Jones\nSteph Catley stepped up to the penalty spot with her nation’s expectations on her shoulders. Star striker Sam Kerr had been forced to pull out with an injury and Australia had been unable to trouble the visitors’ goal. They couldn’t cope with the determination and hunger of a Republic of Ireland side eager to prove themselves on their first foray on the world stage and needed their moment of magic. It was her time to shine.\nAs she fired home, leaving Courtney Brosnan watching on as she dived in the wrong direction, she corrected Australia’s failures and set them on course for the World Cup they’d been hoping for. This is the perfect situation and they’ll feel capable of upsetting the established order.\nTheir opponents, Ireland, hadn’t been to a Women’s World Cup before. The increased size of this tournament to 32 teams in this edition, the emergence of a new generation of talent and improved backing from their national federation gave them the tools they needed for qualification.\nWhy Australia’s Women’s World Cup opener felt different\nAustralia relief after Women’s World Cup opener reveals significance of Sam Kerr injury\n16:03 , Mike Jones\nAustralia get away with it, Ireland will feel they should have got something. Both can take some encouragement from their opening game of the Women’s World Cup, while England can take encouragement from how beatable these possible last-16 opponents look.\nThis absorbing first game for the co-hosts was so much more engaging than a single penalty from Steph Catley and a narrow 1-0 suggested. Some of that might have been down to Sam Kerr’s injury for the opening two matches. The truth is it makes Australia a completely different team.\nThat’s also why it could have been a lot worse for the hosts. A proud if frustrated Ireland would have felt they should have had so much better, though.\nAustralia relief after World Cup opener reveals significance of Sam Kerr injury\nA different ball game\n15:55 , Mike Jones\nNew Zealand head coach Jitka Klimkova has challenged her players to make football as popular as rugby in the southern hemisphere nation with their exploits in the tournament.\nThe All Blacks are three-times Rugby World Cup winners, while the Black Ferns have lifted the women’s version on six occasions and are the current holders.\nKlimkova told a press conference: “I really believe this is an incredible opportunity for this country to not be just a rugby country, but to actually really also wake up the love of football.”\nThe Football Ferns, who are playing at their sixth finals are ranked 26th in the world by FIFA. They earned their first every victory at the World Cup and upset the odds when they launched their campaign with a victory over the 12th-placed Norwegians.\nHow far can they go?\nCan Sam Kerr live up to expectations?\n15:48 , Mike Jones\nSam Kerr is happy to bear the weight of expectation as Australia target World Cup glory.\nThe Matildas’ record goalscorer with 63, Chelsea striker Kerr insists she is used to the pressure of having to deliver on the big stage.\nShe told a press conference: “I guess for me the expectation has been growing over four years so it’s been something I’ve learned to deal with.\n“I think I’ve really enjoyed it.

They have such a powerful team, it was difficult for us to play against them but they did so well. They didn’t create a lot of chances, right?\n\"A draw would have been a reasonable result. I think everybody is proud that we are part of the top nations and we can only grow from this.\"\nGustavsson on Kerr’s injury\n14:20 , Mike Jones\nTony Gustavsson also spoke about how Sam Kerr is feeling following her injury in training.

There’s been a lot challenges thrown at this team over the last 24 hours, an opening game at a home World Cup and then you add Sam Kerr’s injury to that. They stuck together and played as a team and that mental toughness I am proud of.\n“The fans carried this team to the victory. That support was amazing. In the stands they were amazing.”\nWhy this Women’s World Cup will be unlike anything we’ve seen before\n14:07 , Mike Jones\nAs the squads have been adjusting to Australia and New Zealand over the last few weeks, many coaches and staff members have been doing what the rest of the public does, bouncing around news stories about the different teams to see how they are doing. It is the point at which an international tournament takes on that enticingly self-contained quality. All eyes still go to the USA, especially with this being Megan Rapinoe’s last World Cup, and the squad looking to see her off with a historic third successive victory.\nAs the defending champions themselves look around the field, though, they aren’t seeing what they used to. There is the usual confidence, of course, but also some caution. The gap between them and the rest of the teams isn’t as big. Rapinoe’s retirement may well close out a wider era, since the dominant factor in women’s football over the last decade has been how the USA have enjoyed much longer-term development than the rest of the game. That has been seen as especially influential as regards physical conditioning, but the general feeling is that the European game and Australia have caught up.\nEngland would certainly have no fears there, especially given how they beat the USA in that signpost match back in October.\nWhy this Women’s World Cup will be unlike anything we’ve seen before\nNew Zealand’s historic moment gives Women’s World Cup the spark it needed\n14:00 , Mike Jones\n“We’ve been fighting for this for so long,” Ali Riley said, smiling through the tears.\nThe New Zealand captain had waited more than most, winless at her four previous World Cups, part of a run that stretched back even further than that. Without a victory in 15 attempts at the tournament, New Zealand entered their own World Cup with unwanted history hanging over them. Facing Norway in their opening match, that winless run was expected to continue.\nHow Hannah Wilkinson’s goal changed that.\nIn a stunning upset, New Zealand altered the narrative, providing the World Cup with its first shock that will ripple not just in Group A but throughout the tournament. With a victory in their most difficult game of the group stages, New Zealand can now set their sights higher and now target a place in the knockouts and will have momentum on their side when they face Switzerland and the Philippines.\nSuch moments can change expectations, as well as perceptions.\nNew Zealand’s historic moment gives Women’s World Cup the spark it needed\nNew Zealand squad stayed calm after hearing of Auckland shooting\n13:53 , Mike Jones\nBoss Jitka Klimkova revealed all remained calm in advance of New Zealand’s 1-0 victory over Norway which opened the Women’s World Cup in Auckland, where a fatal shooting took place on Thursday morning.\nThe incident, which occurred in the city’s central business district close to Norway’s team hotel, resulted in three deaths – including that of the suspected gunman – with more wounded in what New Zealand Police characterised as an “isolated incident” and “not a national security risk”.\nFIFA said a decision was taken to proceed with the match as planned after consulting with New Zealand authorities and the participating teams, who observed a moment of silence for the victims before the tournament kicked off at Eden Park.\nThe Football Ferns opened their campaign in style as Hannah Wilkinson’s second-half goal was enough to set the pace in Group A.\nNew Zealand squad stayed calm after hearing of Auckland shooting\nSpirited Ireland suffer narrow defeat to Australia\n13:47 , Mike Jones\nIreland, who qualified for the Women’s World Cup for the first time in their history, suffered a narrow defeat to hosts Australia after a Steph Catley penalty gave the Aussies a 1-0 victory.\nIt was the opening match of the tournament for both teams but should give Ireland hope that they can challenge to get out of the knockout rounds.\nAustralia, pegged as one of the teams to go deep in the tournament, were on the backfoot towards the end of the match as Ireland chased an equaliser but a lack of final third quality cost the Irish.\nAustralia relief after Women’s World Cup opener underlines blow of Sam Kerr injury\n13:38 , Mike Jones\nAustralia get away with it, Ireland will feel they should have got something. Both can take some encouragement from their opening game of the Women’s World Cup, while England can take encouragement from how beatable these possible last-16 opponents look.\nThis absorbing first game for the co-hosts was so much more engaging than a single penalty from Steph Catley and a narrow 1-0 suggested. Some of that might have been down to Sam Kerr’s injury for the opening two matches. The truth is it makes Australia a completely different team.\nThat’s also why it could have been a lot worse for the hosts. A proud if frustrated Ireland would have felt they should have had so much better, though.\nAustralia relief after Women’s World Cup opener underlines blow of Sam Kerr injury\nPost-match thoughts from Katie McCabe\n13:33 , Mike Jones\nRepublic of Ireland captain Katie McCabe gave her reaction to ITV 1 saying: “Little [Abbie] Larkin and Lucy [Quinn] coming on brought a bit of energy.\n“The Aussies were tiring towards the end and we gave a good account of ourselves in the second half and we have things to build on for the second game against Canada.\n“I enjoyed the physical game, I think everyone enjoyed it.
