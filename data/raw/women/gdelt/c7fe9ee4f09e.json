  "body_text": "The Orlando Pride is the team to beat in the NWSL. With an incredible 15-game unbeaten streak, they also hold the league's longest winning streak with eight victories. In an interview with MLS Multiplex, midfielder Angelina shared what it's like to experience this moment with the league's runner-up, second only to Kansas City Current in goals scored.\n\"We're very happy with our performance this season. We have a team with a lot of quality when we have possession, but also a warrior team that does what it takes to defend well and not concede goals.\"Angelina\nFollow MLS Multiplex on X (Twitter).\nBorn in New Jersey, the player has dual citizenship and chose to represent the Brazilian National Team. She joined the Pride in 2023 after three seasons with OL Reign, with whom she is under contract until 2026. One of the highlights of the new Brazilian generation, it hasn't all been smooth sailing for Angelina at the Pride. During the 2022 Copa America, she suffered a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament and lateral meniscus during the match against Colombia, keeping her off the field for 11 months. Recently, she recovered from a knee arthroscopy that sidelined her for five weeks.\nLike a true warrior, the 24-year-old managed to overcome these setbacks and has already played 10 games in the NWSL. The support she received was one of the factors that made her return to the field easier.\n\"I felt at ease after we made the action plan for this recovery. We have excellent professionals who took great care of me from the start, making me more comfortable to come back strong. The feeling of returning to the field was one of great joy. It was five weeks of dedication to return well, and with the help of the staff and teammates, I managed to make it happen smoothly. I feel good and ready to play.\"Angelina\nWith experience in two different leagues, Brazil and the United States, Angelina spoke about the evolution of women's soccer. Nowadays, it's possible to notice the growth of several European teams, with Barcelona standing out as one of the great powers of women's soccer, not to mention the evolution of England's Women's Super League, considered by some to be the top league at the moment. With all this evolution, we asked her if the NWSL had fallen behind, but the midfielder was quick to dismiss that notion.\n\"Women's soccer has evolved rapidly and is becoming more prominent everywhere in the world. The NWSL is also evolving in terms of structure and visibility and, as a result, is attracting more and more top athletes to the league. This year has shown just how competitive this league is, and the expectations for the coming years are high.\"Angelina\nThe road to the NWSL playoffs is long. With the Orlando Pride being a tough team to face, the group's winning mentality and ambition shouldn't just be about fighting for the top spots in the standings. Angelina acknowledges the challenges of maintaining a high level until the end of the season, but consistency is one of the team's main goals.\n\"I believe that as we get closer to the end of the season, maintaining the high level we've set so far won't be easy, but it's definitely the main goal. We know that maintaining this consistency demands a lot from everyone, but we're continually striving to improve our strengths.\"Angelina\nCheck out the full interview with Angelina\nAngelina, first of all, we know your routine is quite exhausting. So, we'd like to thank you for taking the time to talk with us. To start, you recently went through a recovery process after an injury. How did it feel to get back on the field after five weeks away? Do you feel 100% recovered, or are there still physical aspects to improve?\nThe feeling of getting back on the field was one of great joy. It was five weeks of dedication to return well, and with the help of the staff and teammates, I managed to make it happen smoothly. I feel good and ready to play.\nGoing through a knee arthroscopy must have been a tense moment. Were you nervous or confident in the surgery's success? How was your mental state during that time?\nI felt at ease after we made the action plan for this recovery. We have excellent professionals who took great care of me from the start, making me more comfortable to come back strong.\nI imagine the Orlando Pride provides good treatment conditions, considering that their main sponsor is Orlando Health. Can you tell us more about the dynamic with the medical team during this period?\nThis partnership allows us access to excellent professionals and the best in sports medicine. Knowing this certainly helped me feel calm and secure about my recovery outcome.\nSpeaking of the conditions Orlando Pride provides for its players, until recently, the United States was considered the main force in women's soccer. Now, we're seeing a remarkable rise of European teams, with Barcelona standing out as a powerhouse. How do you view this global evolution? In your opinion, has the NWSL and its clubs fallen a step behind European leagues?\nWomen's soccer has evolved rapidly and is becoming more prominent everywhere in the world. The NWSL is also evolving in terms of structure and visibility and, as a result, is attracting more and more top athletes to the league. This year has shown just how competitive this league is, and the expectations for the coming years are high.\nBased on your experience as a player, are there specific aspects that make the NWSL unique compared to your experiences in other leagues around the world?\nI believe the format and how it operates in terms of drafts, trades, etc., following the style of some sports in the United States, make it unique.\nThe Orlando Pride is having a great season. An impressive performance! Can you tell us about the strengths that set the Pride apart from its competitors?\nWe're very happy with our performance this season. We have a team with a lot of quality when we have possession, but also a warrior team that does what it takes to defend well and not concede goals.\nCurrently, you have the opportunity to play and live alongside Marta. She is undoubtedly a living legend of women's soccer. Can you share any experiences or lessons you've learned from Marta on and off the field?\nIt's a privilege to play and live with her. With athletes like her, you learn every day from her vision of the game and her decisions on the field. And off the field, she brings incredible energy and joy that contagiously lifts the environment.\nSeb Hines is a legend in Orlando, having brilliantly transitioned Orlando City from the USL to MLS as a defender. After retiring as a player, he is now coaching Orlando Pride. How do you assess his understanding of women's soccer dynamics and his influence on the team?\nIt's always easier when the coach has been through what we're going through now. The results speak for themselves. I believe we've found our identity and how Orlando Pride likes to play, with the vision and experience of the entire coaching staff.\nIn several interviews, both Hines and the players mentioned they don't accept mediocre results and always keep their focus high. How does this mentality influence the team's performance on the field and help achieve the season's goals?\nFrom the start of the season, we set our goals and objectives for this season, creating a strong identity and a winning mentality.\nAngelina, you're very young and still have a promising career ahead of you. We wish you great success with Orlando Pride. It was incredible to talk with you and hear your opinions! To wrap up, what areas do you believe Orlando Pride still needs to improve to reach the top of the league? Are there specific aspects you're working on to perfect?\nI believe that as we get closer to the end of the season, maintaining the high level we've set so far won't be easy, but it's definitely the main goal. We know that maintaining this consistency demands a lot from everyone, but we're continually striving to improve our strengths.",
