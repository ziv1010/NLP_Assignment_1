It’s published each Saturday, and members can receive it directly in their inbox by going to their newsletter preferences or adding their email to the sign-up box in this article.\nAustria has Father’s Day — but where are the fathers on parental leave?\nAs Austria marks Father’s Day this Sunday, the numbers tell a sobering story: when it comes to dads staying home with their children, Austria ranks dead last in the EU.\nDespite more than 30 years of legal entitlement, only 16 percent of Austrian fathers take any parental leave at all, and most for less than three months. Just 3.6 percent of childcare allowance recipients are men. By contrast, in countries like Iceland and Luxembourg, up to 90 percent of fathers take leave, backed by stronger incentives and better childcare support.\nAustria’s low uptake is not just a cultural “quirk” — it’s one of the key reasons the country has one of the highest gender pay gaps in Europe. Women still earn 18.3 percent less on average than men and receive 40 percent less in pension payments, in part because time spent caring for children is only partially credited to retirement.\nExperts say this isn't just a women’s issue. Research indicates that early involvement enhances fathers’ long-term relationships with their children. Nordic countries have led the way with “use-it-or-lose-it” quotas for dads and full wage compensation. Austria’s “daddy month” (Papamonat) offers just €55 a day and remains optional — only 11,700 fathers claimed it in 2021.\nNow, the pressure is growing for reform. The Austrian Trade Union Federation is advocating for a fully paid month of paternity leave, stricter split-leave requirements, and improved access to childcare.\nThe government says it’s working on proposals to improve leave-sharing and simplify access, but concrete changes aren’t expected before 2026.\nCan Austria qualify for its first World Cup since 1998?\nAustria's national football team kicks off its 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign this weekend — and while the mood is cautiously hopeful, a lot will depend on whether the team’s early momentum can carry them through a relatively easy group.\nTeam boss Ralf Rangnick has earned respect with his no-nonsense style and long-term vision, and Austria heads into the qualifiers as the top seed in a group that includes Romania, Bosnia, Cyprus and San Marino. On paper, the path to qualification looks clear.\nBut there are question marks. Striker woes continue to plague the team: Marko Arnautović and Michael Gregoritsch are both veterans with limited recent match time, and the team’s recent goal tally has been underwhelming. Without more firepower up front, even weaker opponents could cause trouble.\nThe Austrian FA is also trying to stabilise its leadership after a series of internal controversies. And while enthusiasm remains high following last year’s strong European Championship showing, Austria’s football euphoria is fragile, dependent, as always, on winning.\nThe first match is against Romania in Vienna this Saturday. A win would go a long way to keeping the dream of 2026 alive.\nWhat else?\nAustria is heading into another long weekend with Pfingstmontag (Whit Monday) on June 9th. Here’s what to know:\n- Why is Monday a holiday?\nWhit Monday is a religious holiday marking the day after Pentecost and is one of Austria’s 13 public holidays. Most shops and supermarkets will be closed, but restaurants and museums remain open.\n- Why is Pentecost a public holiday in Austria? - Explore Vienna’s vegan street food scene\nVeganmania returns to the MuseumsQuartier this weekend with plant-based dishes, fair fashion, music and a festival vibe.\n- What to do in Vienna this weekend - Worried about flight delays this summer?\nThe EU is planning to water down air passenger compensation rules — but the changes won’t take effect before summer.\n- Passenger compensation for flight delays set to decrease in Europe",
