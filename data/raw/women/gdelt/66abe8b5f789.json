  "body_text": "Morning, everyone. On this evidence, the death of Test cricket may be somewhat exaggerated. After being on the wrong end of several dramatic finishes in England in recent years, Australia won the first Test at Edgbaston by two wickets to slay the demons of 2005 and 2019. We’ve got all the news and reaction to a match that will be talked about for years. Elsewhere we’re looking at whether we’re really heading for a double dissolution of parliament and keeping track of the Titanic sub search.\nAustralia\n-\nChina ‘threat’ | Three-quarters of Australians believe it is likely China will become a military threat to Australia in the next two decades, but a majority say Australia should remain neutral in the event of a conflict between China and the United States, a Lowy Institute poll has found.\n-\nDefence denial | The defence department has stopped providing details about the use of taxpayer-funded VIP jets to the nation’s independent expenses watchdog, leaving it unable to recover funds from the offices of MPs who use it to ferry electorate staff and family across the country.\n-\nSenate standoff | The Albanese government has asked the solicitor general for advice about having another attempt to pass the Housing Australia future fund bill amid a continued standoff with the Greens in the Senate about the legislation. The move would be one of the steps on the road to a double dissolution election.\n-\nReform rethink | Don Farrell has signalled that Labor could rethink its plans for political spending and donation caps amid concern about a possible negative impact on charities and fundraising bodies like Climate 200.\n-\nWinter chill | South-eastern Australia may be waking up to the coldest morning for five years today with Sydney and Melbourne forecast for 5C and 4C respectively. And it might get as low as -6C in Canberra.\nWorld\n-\nTitanic search | An aerial search resumed at first light in the north Atlantic today for a submersible and five crew members who went missing during a dive to the wreck of the Titanic. Here’s what we know so far and also who is on board along with British billionaire Hamish Harding (pictured).\n-\nHunter Biden guilty | Hunter Biden, the scandal-plagued son of US president Joe Biden, will plead guilty to two counts of wilful failure to pay federal income tax and one firearm offense. And the judge in Donald Trump’s classified documents case has set the trial for 14 August.\n-\nWest Bank shooting | A Palestinian attacker has killed at least four people and wounded several others at a petrol station near an Israeli settlement in the West Bank.\n-\nTate on trial | The controversial influencer Andrew Tate, his brother, Tristan, and two other suspects will face trial in Romania on charges of human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women, prosecutors said.\n-\nNeue Tech | Germany’s Bild tabloid, the biggest-selling newspaper in Europe, is to replace some editorial jobs with artificial intelligence as part of a €100m cost-cutting program.\nFull Story\nWhy won’t the Labor government freeze rents?\nAmid the worsening standoff between Labor and the Greens, chief political correspondent Paul Karp looks at the fight over renters’ rights and whether it could spell the end of the government’s housing bill.\nIn-depth\nWhen tennis star Novac Djokovic was detained in a hotel in Melbourne last year for failing to get the Covid vaccine, it shone a brief light on the government’s use of city hotels as ad hoc immigration detention centres. But a report by the Australian Human Rights Commission beams a spotlight on the practice, calling it “devastating” for the mental and physical health of detainees. We also have a first-hand account by an inspector who describes “the hopelessness and helplessness” felt by the detainees.\nNot the news\nIt’s been home to Rod Stewart and a Warner Bros record executive who guided the careers of Jimi Hendrix and Fleetwood Mac among others. But the Malibu home known as the “wave house”, which is now up for sale for US$49.5m ($72m), has a connection to Australia because many people think it might have inspired Jørn Utzon’s design of the Sydney Opera House. Kelly Burke investigates.\nThe world of sport\n-\nThe Ashes | The first Ashes Test lived up to expectations with a thrilling win for Australia at Edgbaston as Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyon steered them home with the bat in the dying overs. Don’t blame Bazball, Australia won by taking a leaf from their hosts’ book, writes Jonathan Liew.\n-\nWomen’s Ashes | The absence of Meg Lanning when the one-off Test against England starts tomorrow is not as big a concern as it once was, writes Megan Maurice.\n-\nFootball | West Ham are expected to reject a second bid from Arsenal for Declan Rice worth £90m. Arsenal are offering £75m plus £15m in add-ons.\nMedia roundup\nAustralians could be back at the polling booths ahead of time if the Canberra deadlock over the government’s housing plans lead to a double dissolution election, reckons the Courier-Mail. The corporate regulator Asic has been accused by Labor, the Coalition and the Greens of obstructing inquiries into how it polices the nation’s businesses, the Sydney Morning Herald says. Victoria’s politicians have had a pay rise to make the base salary nearly $200,000, the Herald Sun reports. Alfred Neal, a man the Cairns Post describes as “one of the nation’s greatest leaders” who worked to improve the lives of Indigenous people in far north Queensland, has been laid to rest after a funeral in Yarrabah.\nWhat’s happening today\n-\nHealth | Australian Institute of Health and Welfare releases its annual report into alcohol and other drug treatment services.\n-\nTaree | AVO mention for anti-trans lobbyist Kirrillie Smith who allegedly harassed trans football players.\n-\nCanberra | The Midwinter Ball takes place in the capital.\nSign up\nIf you would like to receive this Morning Mail update to your email inbox every weekday, sign up here.
