  "body_text": "The next employee-of-the-month award at Manchester United should not take too long to decide. Whoever won it last month can probably cross the office and hand it to their successor, as, once again, there appears to be only one team in it: the commercial team.\nA wag might suggest it is time to let that lot keep the trophy and let the club’s other departments — the men’s team, for example — have a crack at a new piece of silverware for the superstar not working on sponsorships and merchandising.\nAdvertisement\nBut that would be a bit unfair… on the commercial team. They are truly the best in business and deserve to be recognised.\nWhile most United fans have spent the past couple of months worrying about the club’s owners, the summer recruitment efforts, off-field scandals, the future of high-profile signings, the manager, the stadium, financial fair play and the nagging feeling that both the men’s and women’s teams have got worse, the commercial department have signed two stonking deals that confirm one simple fact: Manchester United are massive.\nThe first, announced at the end of July, was the early renewal of the club’s official kit-supplier agreement with Adidas, a 10-year deal worth at least £900million ($1.1billion).\nThe second was confirmed earlier this week, a three-year agreement with Qualcomm Technologies to put its Snapdragon brand across the front of the men’s and women’s match shirts. That one should bring in at least £60m per season.\nBoth are significant uplifts on the deals they replace and set benchmarks for their peers, which surely begs the question: how much would they have been worth if United were still really good at the football stuff?\n“The deal between Qualcomm and Manchester United shows the enduring appeal of Manchester United as one of the world’s biggest clubs and the strength of their major piece of sponsorship inventory, despite the relative lack of success in recent years,” answers Conrad Wiacek, the head of sport analysis at consultancy firm GlobalData.\n“While many fans will complain about the direction of the club on the pitch, it is undeniable that, commercially, the 20-time champions of England are still an exceedingly strong brand.\n“With a massive global fanbase, Qualcomm hopes to leverage the partnership to build greater brand awareness in key markets around the world, and association with one of the biggest sporting brands in any sport will help them do so. While some will suggest Qualcomm have overpaid, the tech brand obviously see value in the partnership as sport moves to fully embrace the opportunity that new technologies and AI can provide.”\nUnited have got so good at getting commercial partners to overpay for something you are reminded of South African golfer Gary Player’s famous quip: “The harder I practise, the luckier I get.”\nAdvertisement\nFor what it is worth, Qualcomm, a hugely successful California-based firm that makes semiconductors and software for wireless devices, will pay about a third more than German software company TeamViewer did for the privilege of having its logo splashed across the chests of United players for the past two and a bit seasons.\nTeamViewer, however, is ending that relationship two years early after a major shareholder told the board to “rapidly disengage from this mess”, describing the decision to sponsor United as “appalling judgment”.\nTeamViewer replaced Chevrolet on the front of the shirt, with the American automobile brand having stunned the sports industry by agreeing to give United £64million a year for that piece of advertising space between 2014 and 2021. The person who did that deal for Chevrolet was axed 48 hours after it was announced.\nYou would think they would learn, right? But they never do.\nThe Adidas deal is probably an even better example of how United’s outsized gravitational pull appears to do strange things to marketing executives.\nThe German sportswear giant replaced its great rival Nike as the club’s kit supplier in 2015. The American firm had taken over from Manchester-based Umbro in 2002 and was paying somewhere between £25m-£35m (it varied according to certain terms in the contract) a year.\nAs is standard in such deals, Nike had a clause in the contract which meant it could match the best deal United’s commercial wizards could find in the market when they started to make polite inquiries in 2014. When United told Nike that Adidas was willing to give them £75million a season for 10 years, some say they could hear the laughter from their base in the U.S. state of Oregon almost 5,000 miles (7,500km) away in Manchester.\nAnd yet here we are, eight years into that deal and Adidas has agreed, under no obvious signs of coercion, to extend it by another decade for £15million a year more. Minimum.\nWhen this revised deal was announced, there was no laughter, just applause.\nAdvertisement\n“Even when the market is running at full bore it’s hard to get an uplift, so it’s a very impressive achievement by Manchester United’s commercial team,” says Leo Thompson, co-president of rights management at sports marketing agency Two Circles.\n“Put it this way, when United do their front-of-shirt deal, they’ll probably reach out to 1,000 companies worldwide. But when they do their apparel deal, there are maybe six brands out there, but it’s probably just three for a deal of this size, and when you look at United’s options, it’s really just two: Adidas and Nike.\n“So, not a huge amount of market tension but United are the best at this and they know it comes down to where these two fierce rivals want to place their chips. United will have done a huge amount of research to prove to Adidas that they really need to put those chips on them.”\nTim Crow, the former chief executive at sports marketing agency Synergy and now a leading consultant in the industry, agrees.\n“It demonstrates that United continue to hold enormous pulling power for the two biggest players in the category — Adidas and Nike,” says Crow. “It’s a huge number. But there are only a handful of clubs in the world with a fanbase like that. As a result, they can command a premium.”\nA third expert, who asked to remain anonymous to protect business relationships, puts it like this: “When Adidas did the deal in 2014, the feeling within the industry was that they had overpaid.\n“Everybody thought it was just a branding exercise and all about prestige — nobody thought they’d make any money or even get close. Fast forward to now and I thought Adidas had a good chance of getting a discount. With Nike tied up with Liverpool, Spurs and Chelsea, and Puma with Manchester City, there didn’t seem to be any competitive tension in the market.\nAdvertisement\n“On top of that, you’ve had a period when the club has been less successful than before and then, more recently, there have been negative headlines.\n“I thought Adidas could do this for £60m-£65m.\n“So what happened? Well, there are three main reasons.\n“One, they’ve built up a good working relationship over the last few years. The relationship between United and Nike wasn’t very good at the end.\n“The second is that United’s commercial team are the best in the game.\n“And the third is that Adidas could not afford to lose this deal, so all United had to do was suggest the possibility that they might, even if it was very unlikely. (British firm) Castore aren’t ready for a deal this big and it’s not like an Errea or one of the other smaller brands could do it. Adidas want to be the number one football brand, so they have to be in this space.”\nSo, good vibes, nice presentations, fear of missing out… is that it?\n“No, the skill in these negotiations is knowing what the other party wants and then using that to your advantage, and United will have had the inside track here because of their existing relationship with Adidas,” says Crow.\n“They will have known that Adidas wants leverage in the wholesale market with the big retailers. So, if (UK retailer) Sports Direct wants the Manchester United home shirt in their stores, and they do, what space can they provide for Adidas tracksuits and trainers?\n“These negotiations with the retailers are what the big beasts in every category are good at, but United will know that Adidas need premium products.\n“And then there is the direct-to-consumer piece. A few years ago, getting people to buy sportswear from the Adidas or Nike website was the big obsession and it’s still the golden egg in terms of capturing first-person data, but Adidas and Nike seem to have realised that most people still buy a lot of stuff from shops.\nAdvertisement\n“That said, Adidas would still prefer it if you bought everything from their app because that would mean they no longer need to spend money on advertising to you: they’ll have your data and can just send you offers.\n“But what really underpins all this is trying to turn Manchester United fans into Adidas fans and Adidas will be looking for that sweet spot where two prestige brands get together. It’s a huge branding exercise, but they are also trying to acquire customers.\n“It is a rare example of a win-win. For United, it’s a very reassuring deal, but it’s good news for Adidas because it means they’ve secured one of the biggest billboards for the next decade.”\nBut does it really follow that brand X sponsors team Y, so team Y’s fans buy brand X?\nTwo Circles’ Thompson told a fascinating story on a recent edition of the Unofficial Partner sports business podcast. He explained that he knew of one club that installed a camera in their megastore which filmed what brand of shoes their fans were wearing. Within a year, they were able to tell their new kit supplier that their supporters had made the change, too.\nSpeaking to The Athletic, Thompson made the point that ensuring a good geographical spread is important for Adidas, Nike and their smaller rivals. That is why Adidas needed one of the Premier League’s northern giants and Nike had to make sure it had London covered with Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur.\nThompson agrees with Crow that Adidas and Nike have remembered the importance of the high street and shopping mall, which is why they need these connections with the most popular sports teams, but they believe every customer who uses their website will have a “lifetime basket value” to them of $600 (£480). So, giving United some money to help them acquire that first-person data is not a bad deal.\nWhen it is put like this, you start to think maybe Adidas — and Qualcomm — did not overpay.\nAdvertisement\n“This is a marketing play,” says Matt Powell, a sports industry veteran who now runs his own consultancy, Spurwink River.\n“Adidas wants their brand associated with a very popular team and it wants to block Nike from taking this deal away. While there are sales dollars to be gained, sales alone do not justify these deals. Endorsement deals continue to escalate, so yes, this deal could look less outsized in a few years.”\nSo, will Adidas make money on this deal?\n“Directly? No,” says Thompson. “An adult shirt costs about £80 but they’ll only get 40 per cent of that and they’ll have to give 20 per cent of that to United as a royalty payment, so that only leaves them with a little over £25. I can’t see them shifting enough shirts to recoup their investment.\n“But indirectly? Yes, they’ll make money because this is a branding exercise and that association with United has enormous value.”\nFor what it is worth, United typically sell about two million shirts a year — official Adidas shirts, that is — but the club says this season’s home, away and third shirts are doing record numbers. And say what you like about the product on the pitch, but the figures the commercial team are spitting out are nothing short of spectacular.\nIn June, the club announced its third-quarter numbers — the three months to the end of March. Commercial revenues were up, year on year, by nearly six per cent to £69.4million, and the nine-month figures were up 21 per cent, year on year, to £235.5m. The club raised its projection for the year’s total revenues from a range of £590m-£610m to £630m-£640m.\nAnd this is long before the additional income from Adidas and Qualcomm — or Estee Lauder, the club’s new skincare partner — starts to flow.\nAll of these numbers require two important bits of context: the first is that United, previously English football’s greatest cash machine, have been losing money in recent seasons and the second is that all their peers have been posting impressive numbers, too, particularly their noisy neighbours across town, City.\nAdvertisement\nWe will have to wait for the end-of-year numbers later this month to see if United are over the lingering effects of Covid-19 and a decade of sub-optimal football decisions, but their ability to bring in serious amounts of money remains undisputed.\n“This makes Manchester United top of the pops,” says Thompson. “Because of their stock market listing, they can’t pump up the numbers. If they announce that the minimum income from this deal is £90million, they mean it. And you can be sure that there will be all kinds of potential bonuses in the agreement that could make the final number significantly greater.\n“When Barcelona or Real Madrid tell everyone they’ve got a kit deal that could be worth up to €120million, that’s the best-case number, the guaranteed minimum will be half that. Real might have the biggest front-of-shirt deal but I am confident United will have the biggest kit deal. They are just much better than Real at capturing the data the big brands want.”\nOur secret industry expert is almost as bullish. “The kit deal is right up there, probably second only to Real Madrid. This will have eclipsed Barca,” he says.\nAnd, for him, the key metric is United’s much-trumpeted, but often ridiculed, claim of having 1.1 billion followers across the world (estimated population: 8bn).\nFor those who have not followed this particular controversy, United have been asking international market research firm Kantar to work out how many people care about the club for nearly 20 years. In 2006, a survey found that 330 million adults around the globe took an interest in United one way or another. By 2011, that figure had nearly doubled and by 2019 it had almost doubled again.\n“The 1.1 billion number is misunderstood,” the industry expert said. “They’re not saying they have that many fans — I think that number is 475m. They’re saying 1.1bn people will watch or read about Manchester United.\nAdvertisement\n“Sponsors love that. Don’t forget, you’re selling eyeballs and United deliver eyeballs. As the (United fans’) banner says: Hated, adored, never ignored.”\nDon’t worry, we know — United deliver subscriptions, too, but will all these followers and the commercial income they attract deliver new owners?\n“Maybe,” says Crow. “This confirms Manchester United’s position at the top table. For any potential buyers out there, this is a big number in your forward revenue projections. Suddenly, a lot of risk is taken off the table. Or perhaps it will persuade you that you are worth more than you have been offered?”\nThat is the view of our anonymous expert, who puts it like this: “These deals confirm to (the club’s U.S.-based owners) the Glazers that United is worth what they think it is worth.”\nThompson, however, chose to remain in the safest spot when it comes to this debate: the fence.\n“The best analogy for the takeover that I can think of is (TV drama) Succession because we are talking about a family that clearly can’t decide what they want to do,” he says, wisely.\n(Top photo: Matthew Ashton – AMA/Getty Images)",
