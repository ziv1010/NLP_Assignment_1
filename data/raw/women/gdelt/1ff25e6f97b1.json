What if she doesn't have a soul?\nMen do have souls. Obviously. But women? Hmmm.\nABC Radio National's Conversations has just featured a conversation with historian Paul Ham about his new book The Soul: A History of the Human Mind.\nHam finds that the story of humankind is crowded with the refusals of men to recognise women as their equals, with an accompanying refusal to accept that women, like men, have souls.\nHam told Conversations' presenter Richard Fidler that there was a council of Christian fathers in about 530 (of course with no women in the room) where there was argument about whether women could possibly have souls.\nA majority of the men seem to have grudgingly agreed that a woman probably did have a soul, in which case it was just a second-class, derivative soul, an offcut of Adam's soul since after all women were created by God (as God's afterthought) out of Adam's spare rib.\nIt won't have occurred to the men at that ancient council, or to men like them still with us today, but in my endearing, pro-feminist way I can imagine men and women having two different sorts of souls with women's souls having qualities never found in men's souls. Sensitive, impressionable men like me even feel tempted, at elections, to vote for women just because they are women.\nBut even as I re-read that last sentence I can see I have written it under the intoxicating influence of Jane Anger the 16th-century English protofeminist. Ham quotes her with rapt approval in his book and quoted her during this Conversations talk.\nIn her seething treatise Jane Anger - Her Protection For Women (1589), she raged against women's oppression by men. She fumed that women were inherently better than men and that was because God, appalled by what He had created in Adam, then created women as the vastly improved version of mankind.\n\"God, making woman of man's flesh that she might be purer than he [men], showed how women are more excellent than men. Our bodies are fruitful - whereby the world increaseth - and our care wonderful, by which man is preserved,\" she insisted.\nWhat's more, she raged, God's improvements, with His women, included equipping women with reason while sex-crazed men's \"unreasoning minds, which know not what reason is, make them nothing better than brute beasts\".\nAnd while I am enthusing about the innate superiority of women I wonder if it is time for a woman, almost any woman, to take over from Ricky Stuart as coach of the Canberra Raiders?\nOne does wonder what the fact that Canberra Raiders' head coach Ricky Stuart appears to have his Raiders' top job for life (rather like a pope) irrespective of his team's results, says about Canberra and Canberrans.\nREAD MORE IAN WARDEN:\nMy extreme football fandom finds me with one foot in the soccer excellence of the English Football League (EFL) and the other foot in the rugby league excellence of Australia's NRL where the Canberra Raiders are alas, always, in living memory, outexcelled by other teams.\nThis Raiders' season looms as the worst in 41 years, thus-far featuring five matches in which the Raiders have conceded a shameful 40 points. Meanwhile, in the EFL's top divisions, head coaches only ever keep their jobs for as long as their teams are successful.\nOften, in the ruthless meritocracy of the EFL, just one very bad result is enough for a manager to be sacked. If \"our\" Ange Postecoglou's Premier League Spurs (Tottenham Hotspur) ever lost just one match as badly as Ricky's Raiders have lost five this season (imagine, say, a scandalous score of Spurs 0 Fulham 6) then Ange would be shown the door.\nBut one is torn here. On the one hand I subscribe to the ferocious idea that sport is a win-at-all-costs matter, a kind of warfare.\nBut on the other hand, and in the Canberra Raiders' special case, I wonder if our eccentric perseverance with Ricky says something really rather nice about us, about Canberra and Canberrans. Perhaps it says our city does after all have a heart (a soul, even), a kindly, sentimental side that our city's critics never give us credit for.\nIn the EFL, fans of a club as unsuccessful as the Raiders would, at matches, by now be singing songs and chanting chants calling for the manager's sacking.\nBut Canberra Raiders' fans never, ever sing against Ricky, and instead seem humanely accepting of his quasi-papal by-the-grace-of-God tenure.\nWhat does this say about us, about Canberrans? If it says that we are an essentially familiarity-loving people not fussed about excellence and achievement then that is very bad news for the Canberra Liberals. As October's election looms, their campaign's major theme is that Canberrans are wearied and embittered with unbroken decades of Labor/Greens government.\nBut what if, instead, Canberrans are enjoying the good old familiarity of Labor/Greens governments? What if, just as we're content to have Ricky coaching the Raiders until Hell freezes, Canberrans want Labor/Greens governments to continue until all the seas go dry, until the poets run out of rhyme?\n- Ian Warden is a regular contributor.",
