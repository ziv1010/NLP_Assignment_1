The Eagles have won three NFL championships (1948, 1949, and 1960) and two Super Bowls (2018 and 2025).\n(Read Walter Camp’s 1903 Britannica essay on inventing American football.)\nEarly history\nThe Eagles were founded in 1933 when the remains of the defunct Frankford Yellow Jackets franchise was sold to a syndicate of Philadelphia-based businessmen. The team was not an early success, as it posted either one or two victories in seven of its first 10 seasons, but the hiring of head coach Earle (“Greasy”) Neale in 1941 marked the beginning of a turnaround in Philadelphia. Neale guided teams featuring star running back Steve Van Buren to an NFL championship game appearance in 1947 and NFL titles in 1948 and 1949. The Eagles slowly regressed in the wake of their consecutive championships, and by the mid-1950s they routinely finished in the bottom half of the league. In 1960 the Eagles, led by quarterback Norm Van Brocklin and diminutive flanker Tommy McDonald on offense and linebacker Chuck Bednarik on defense, rebounded to win the franchise’s third NFL championship, a 17–13 victory over the Green Bay Packers.\nRandall Cunningham and Donovan McNabb\nThe Eagles’ renaissance proved to be short-lived, as the team entered into an 18-year playoff drought immediately after its championship season. Head coach Dick Vermeil was hired in 1976, and his emotional coaching style energized the Eagles (as well as their fans), resulting in four straight playoff berths from 1978 to 1981 with teams that featured the passing duo of quarterback Ron Jaworski and the towering (6 feet 8 inches [2.03 meters] tall) wide receiver Harold Carmichael. This span was highlighted by Philadelphia’s first Super Bowl berth in 1981, though it lost to the Oakland Raiders, 27–10. Before the 1985 season, the Eagles made two significant additions: Randall Cunningham, a fleet-footed quarterback who would set the career record for rushing yards from his position, and Reggie White, a dominant defensive end who would retire as the NFL’s all-time sack leader. However, their stellar individual play never translated to team postseason success, as the Eagles won only one of the five playoff games in which the pair played between 1988 and 1992.\nIn 1999 the team hired head coach Andy Reid, who with his first draft choice selected quarterback Donovan McNabb. Reid and McNabb guided the Eagles to eight playoff berths in 10 years from their second season in Philadelphia, which included five trips to the NFC championship game and a Super Bowl appearance in 2005 but no titles. The pair had a tumultuous relationship on and off the field, and in 2010 McNabb was traded away. Michael Vick eventually took over as the Eagles’ starting quarterback that year and helped a young team win a division title. The following season the team signed a bevy of high-profile free agents—notably cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha—and drafted Jason Kelce, who became one of the game’s greatest centers. Expectations were high for the Eagles, but Philadelphia struggled to an 8–8 record and missed the playoffs in 2011. The team followed with an injury-plagued 4–12 campaign in 2012, which led to Reid’s firing at season’s end. In 2013 a revamped Eagles team won 10 games and captured a divisional title but lost in its opening playoff contest. After again winning 10 games but failing to make the postseason in 2014, the Eagles fell back to mediocrity in the following two seasons.\nFirst Super Bowl win\nThe Eagles hired Doug Pederson as head coach in 2016. Pederson, a former Reid assistant coach, instituted an innovative offense that took the NFL by storm behind the play of breakout quarterback Carson Wentz during the 2017 season. The Eagles won a division title and advanced to the Super Bowl despite Wentz suffering a season-ending injury during the 13th game of the regular season. Backup quarterback Nick Foles then led the Eagles to a surprising upset of the New England Patriots to give Philadelphia their first Super Bowl championship in franchise history. The team struggled early in the 2018 season, but another Wentz injury opened the door for Foles to rally the team to three straight regular-season wins to sneak into the playoffs, where the Eagles won their first game before being eliminated in the divisional round. Wentz stayed healthy for the 2019 regular season, but the rest of the Eagles roster was decimated by injuries that year. The team nevertheless won nine games to win a division title, but Philadelphia lost its opening playoff game.\nJalen Hurts\nIn 2020 the Eagles drafted Jalen Hurts, a quarterback known for his passing and rushing. Later that season he replaced a struggling Wentz as the starting QB. The team finished the season with a 4–11–1 record, and Pederson was fired. Philadelphia subsequently hired Nick Sirianni as head coach. The Eagles got off to a slow start in 2021, posting a 2–5 record. However, the team’s play improved, and the franchise qualified for the playoffs, though it lost in the wild card round. In 2022 Hurts had a breakout season, and he led the team to a 14–1 record; he missed two games due to a shoulder injury, and Philadelphia lost both contests. The Eagles easily advanced to the Super Bowl, where the team lost to the Kansas City Chiefs on a field goal in the final seconds.\nPhiladelphia seemed poised to continue that success in 2023 as the team had a 10–1 record through the end of November. However, they lost five out of the last six games of the regular season and were defeated in the wild card round of the playoffs. In the offseason the Eagles added star running back Saquon Barkley. He had a phenomenal season in 2024, setting the single-season Eagles rushing record with 2,005 yards. The team finished with a 14–3 record and returned to the playoffs, where they advanced to the conference championship game. Barkley and Hurts each tallied three touchdowns en route to victory in that game, and Philadelphia earned a trip to Super Bowl LIX, where they again faced Kansas City. This time the Eagles were victorious, 40–22.\n- Awards And Honors:\n- Super Bowl (2025)\n- Super Bowl (2018)\n- Date:\n- 1933 - present\n- Headquarters:\n- Philadelphia\n- Areas Of Involvement:\n- American football\n- Related People:\n- Donovan McNabb\n- Andy Reid\n- Jalen Hurts\n- Jason Kelce\n- Michael Vick\nThe Eagles had a solid season in 2025, finishing with a record of 11–6.
