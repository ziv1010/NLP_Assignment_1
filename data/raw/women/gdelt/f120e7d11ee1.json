  "body_text": "A Canberra football coach has quit, blaming what he argues was an inadequate punishment of a shocking incident where a female player was punched in the face while defenceless on the ground.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nQueanbeyan Blues player Majella Smith was suspended for three weeks for punching an opponent in the face in an incident that marred the Queanbeyan derby in Canberra Raiders Cup league tag on June 22.\nSmith was put on report and sin binned after she flattened a Queanbeyan Kangaroos player - who also plays under-16 league tag - with a \"shoulder charge\" before punching her in the face while she was still on the ground.\nThe Kangaroos player suffered cuts to the inside of her mouth and lip, as well as bruising and swelling to her jaw, cheekbone and eye.\nIt sparked a melee - with players from each team running off the bench to join in.\nLeague tag is a non-contact modified version of rugby league. There is no tackling, with players grabbing tags on the side of opponent's shorts to signal a tackle.\nBoth players who re-entered the field were suspended for three weeks, while both the Kangaroos and the Blues were deducted two premiership points for having a player re-enter the field illegally.\nThe points deduction was a bitter blow for the Kangaroos, who won the game 16-14. It was their first win since 2022.\nKangaroos coach Matthew Cox quit because he felt Smith's three-week ban was inadequate given league tag is essentially a non-contact sport. He said the Kangaroos had struggled for player numbers after the incident, leading the club to forfeit two games.\nThe Blues deemed Smith's involvement so serious she was stood down for the rest of the season, and the club's board is weighing up whether she will be eligible to play for the Blues in future years. Her Blues fate will be decided at a board meeting.\nThe incident has been put in the spotlight in the wake of another women's rugby league brawl, which led to Crystal Papali'i being banned for 20 weeks for her involvement in a fight during a Katrina Fanning Shield game last month.\nCox felt Smith should have received a similar sentence to Papali'i - about eight weeks for the shoulder charge and then 12 weeks for striking.\n\"I attended the girl on the ground - she had lacerations on the inside of her mouth,\" he said.\n\"I heard the crack and thought she'd broken her jaw to be honest, because it was a decent shot.\n\"It looked very similar to the Warriors game because there were people coming onto the field.\n\"One of the dramas I've always had with the Canberra Region Rugby League and the match review committee is they have no transparency in regards to who's been charged, what was the grading or anything ... and then what the outcome is.\n\"What she should've been looking at is 20 weeks.\"\nCRRL general manager Mark Vergano said the decisions of the independent tribunal were appropriate.\nSmith was offered a four-week ban, which was reduced to three with an early guilty plea.\nBoth teams' points deductions were for the players re-entering the field of play, as per the NSWRL Tough Love in League policy.\n\"We obviously don't condone any foul play,\" Vergano said.\n\"We've got a robust, but independent, tribunal, which on the referee's advice cited both the two people running on the field but also the person who did the punching.\n\"We don't condone it and we've taken appropriate action through the proper, independent process that we've run.\"",
