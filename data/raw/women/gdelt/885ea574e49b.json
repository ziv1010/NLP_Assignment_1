Liberty, once lost, is lost forever.” —John Adams (1775)\nIN TODAY’S DIGEST\n- Debating the Debatable Merits of Debates\n- Executive News Summary\n- Rapid-Onset Gender Dysphoria Targets Women\n- Tuberville’s Noble Stand Ends\n- Abandoning Bidenomics — the Word, Not the Policies\n- Haley’s Big Demo Donor\n- Hating God\n- DAILY FEATURES: Reader Comments, Videos, Best of Right Opinion, Short Cuts, Memes, and Cartoons.\nON THE WEB\n- Scarlen Valderaz: Are Babies and Toddlers a Nuisance?\n- In Brief: The Anti-Human Depopulation Agenda\n- Days of National Recognition: Remembering Pearl Harbor\nFEATURED ANALYSIS\nDebating the Debatable Merits of Debates\nFour candidates are getting pretty desperate to give GOP primary voters any reason to abandon Donald Trump.\nNate Jackson\nIt’s getting awfully late in the Republican primary for anyone not named Donald Trump. So when every other remaining candidate not named Donald Trump gathered for last night’s NewsNation debate in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, each one was desperately hoping to make the kind of splash needed to separate from the pack and overtake the former president.\nWe’ll get to a couple of key exchanges in a minute, but first we’d like to provide some presidential primary context.\nIowa is and has long been the first in the nation when it comes to selecting presidential nominees. By definition, that makes winning there really important. Ron DeSantis in particular has put most of his eggs in the Iowa basket, visiting all 99 counties and shaking a lot of hands in hopes that he can dislodge Trump with a strong showing. But Iowa gets it wrong almost every time, at least if “right” means picking the eventual nominee.\nIn contested Iowa caucuses (i.e., without an incumbent president running unopposed) since 1976, voters chose the eventual nominee only three times — Gerald Ford in ‘76, Bob Dole in '96, and George W. Bush in 2000. In other words, that’s not a great sign for DeSantis even if he somehow pulls off a miracle while fourth and goal at the 31 yard line (this Auburn fan may or may not have just cursed the crimson team from Tuscaloosa).\nThen again, maybe winning Iowa is also not a good sign for Trump if he maintains his lead.\nNew Hampshire, by the way, has a far better track record picking the eventual nominee, since 1976 failing only with Pat Buchanan in 1996 and John McCain in 2000.\nFor further perspective, as political analyst Jim Geraghty observed before the debate: “Whether you prefer DeSantis or [Nikki] Haley, your candidate is currently about 30 percentage points behind in Iowa, about 30 percentage points behind in New Hampshire, about 30 percentage points behind in South Carolina, and nearly 50 percentage points behind nationally. This is consistent across all pollsters. You can find Trump leads that are a few points smaller here and a few points larger here, but the overall picture is very clear. Trump is way ahead. DeSantis and Haley are well behind, fighting over a distant second place.”\nThat news is even worse for Chris Christie and Vivek Ramaswamy, though arguably both men are running more to make a point — Christie the Trump hater and Ramaswamy the Trump stand-in — than to win the nomination.\nSo, back to the debate. No one could have even hoped to have the kind of debate performance that would suddenly change a bunch of poll respondents’ minds and swing the race wildly in their favor.\nNone of them did, either, though that isn’t to say no one did well.\nDeSantis, coming off last week’s clock cleaning of smug California Governor Gavin Newsom, again displayed a steady command of policy and facts. He does, after all, have a solid record to stand on.\nThat record includes standing strong for kids against groomers, and he did so last night to perhaps the most enthusiastic applause of the evening. “As a parent, you do not have the right to abuse your kids,” he said. “This is cutting off their genitals, this is mutilating these minors, these are irreversible procedures. And this is something that other countries in Europe like Sweden, once they started doing it, they saw it did incalculable damage, they’ve shut it down. I signed legislation in Florida banning the mutilation of minors because it is wrong. We cannot allow this to happen in this country.”\nHe also paid perhaps the best backhanded compliment of the night to Trump. “Look, the media is making a big deal” over fears of a Trump dictatorship, DeSantis said. “I would just remind people that is not how he governed. He didn’t even fire Dr. [Anthony] Fauci. He didn’t fire Christopher Wray. He didn’t clean up the swamp. He said he was going to drain it. He did not drain it.”\nHowever, while DeSantis rebuffed “the idea that we’re going to put someone up that’s almost 80,” he was unwilling to say Trump is unfit for office, which prompted thorough and effective mockery from Christie. Trump’s “conduct is unacceptable,” Christie said. “He’s unfit.” DeSantis didn’t say that because primary voters clearly don’t agree.\nRamaswamy landed a couple of big punches against his favorite target, Haley. One was for that big Democrat donor of hers. He even held up a sign reading “NIKKI = CORRUPT” in case anyone needed a visual aid. Another punch was for her being unable to name the Ukrainian provinces she specifically wants to defend, which undermined her touted foreign policy experience, something Ramaswamy cleverly noted isn’t the same as “foreign policy wisdom.”\nOnce again, however, Ramaswamy was booed for a ridiculous attack on Haley as being “the only person more fascist than the Biden regime.” She’s absolutely guilty of a free speech miscue for wanting to identify all anonymous online speakers, but she walked it back and it doesn’t hold a candle to the actual fascism of the Left.\nHaley has enjoyed a boomlet in polling lately, so all three other candidates targeted her. She brushed it off, saying: “I love all the attention, fellas. Thank you for that.”\nArguably the worst moment for any candidate was Christie’s first question and answer, 17 minutes in. Moderator Megyn Kelly kneecapped Christie with a question that began by comparing his dismal approval rating of 25% to Trump’s 81%. “Voters may wonder how you could possibly become the nominee of a party that does not appear to like you very much,” Kelly asserted. That left a mark.\nAll in all, the big winner of the night once again appears to be Donald Trump. His decision to skip the debates makes the other candidates angry and leaves them to nastily attack each other, which continues to pay off for him.\nExecutive News Summary\nMcCarthy is leaving Congress, House censures fire-alarmist Bowman, attack at UNLV, and more.\nDouglas Andrews, Thomas Gallatin, & Jordan Candler\nCross-Examination\n“I have to run,” says unhinged Joe: Events continue to overwhelm Joe Biden, the president whom columnist and one-time stand-up comedian Kurt Schlichter called “a crusty, desiccated old pervert who was stupid to begin with but is now senile.” After mumbling at a Boston fundraiser Tuesday that if Trump weren’t running “I’m not sure I’d be running,” the Self-Anointed Trumpslayer tried to do some damage control yesterday by saying that “probably 50” Democrats could beat Trump but again insisting, “I have to run.” Some in the mainstream media, though, have determined that Biden is damaged goods politically, and they’re starting to turn on him by asking good questions as opposed to tossing scripted softballs. Get a load of how he comes unglued at the audacity of a question about his interactions with “so many of your son and brother’s foreign business associates.” Rather than calmly answering the question, Biden first stumbled, “I’m not going to comment,” and then he seethed: “I did not and it’s just a bunch of lies. They’re lies. I did not. They’re lies.” Of course, they’re not lies. As House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer points out: “Joe Biden dined at Café Milano with oligarchs from around the world that sent his son money. Joined by speakerphone with Biden family associates over 20 times. Used aliases as vice president to email with his son’s business associate. POTUS just continues to lie.”\nMcCarthy is leaving Congress: In a surprise development on Wednesday, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced that he will not seek reelection next year. Furthermore, he will retire from Congress come January. Despite having the ignoble distinction of being ousted from the position by every Democrat and eight members of his own party, McCarthy’s announcement contained no animosity for Republicans. Rather, he wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, “The Republican Party is expanding every day, and I am committed to lending my experience to support the next generation of leaders.” McCarthy’s decision to leave office a year early will set up a special election in California, though it will likely not be held until the summer, leaving the seat vacant and therefore shrinking the House Republicans’ slim majority.\nHouse censures fire-alarmist Bowman: This morning, House Speaker Mike Johnson pounded the gavel and demanded that Jamaal Bowman “present himself in the well” to be officially censured by the House for having pulled a fire alarm to obstruct an official House proceeding — namely, a vote to prevent a government shutdown. The vote was 214-191, with three decent Democrats crossing over to vote for censure. Bowman, a full-on “Squad” member and a former middle school principal, had laughably claimed that he was “rushing to make a vote” and “trying to get through a door” and that he “thought the alarm would open the door.” Uh-huh. When that didn’t work, Bowman and his surrogates went full Godwin, saying that House Republicans “need to instead focus their energy on the Nazi members of their party before anything else.” The censure was thus a brief moment of decency and justice within the People’s House, and it flew in the face of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s ridiculous claim yesterday, in defense of Bowman, that pulling a fire alarm to obstruct a House vote is hardly more serious a matter than “jaywalking.”\nGOP senators blocks Ukraine aid: Mitch McConnell’s grip on the Senate’s GOP caucus ain’t what it used to be. Yesterday, as Just the News reports, Republicans in the upper chamber “blocked a procedural vote on a supplemental spending bill that included billions in foreign aid to both Ukraine and Israel, preventing the measure from advancing to the floor for consideration.” It was a close vote, 49-51, with strange bedfellow Bernie Sanders joining Republicans to oppose the bill, but it would’ve needed 60 votes to clear the Senate’s filibuster hurdle. Senate Republicans, like their House colleagues and the American people more generally, have become increasingly frustrated by the billions of taxpayer dollars being spent in Ukraine with seemingly so little to show for it. But this particular vote must be seen in its full context: The GOP is seeking to separate aid to Israel from aid to Ukraine, and to couple the latter with more spending to secure our porous southern border. Even McConnell has come grudgingly along, noting that now is “the time to pay attention to our own border in addition to these other important international concerns.”\nDid House J6 Committee collude with Atlanta prosecutor? It’s no secret that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is a sleazy and unscrupulous Trump-hating hyper-partisan. But would she go so far as to collude with Nancy Pelosi’s rigged J6 Committee to prosecute her case against the former president? It seems so, and House Republicans are trying to get to the bottom of this alleged violation of Donald Trump’s Sixth Amendment rights with an inquiry into whether the January 6 Select Committee provided Willis with documents and materials to aid her criminal case against Trump. Naturally, Willis has been uncooperative. As a letter to her from House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan tells it: “Recently, the Committee became aware of cooperation between your office and the partisan January 6 Select Committee. We are in possession of a letter, dated December 17, 2021, and enclosed herein, from you to Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, Chairman of the partisan January 6 Select Committee, requesting access to congressional ‘records that may be relevant to our criminal investigation.’” The charges against Trump and his associates include forgery, racketeering, and soliciting a public official to violate their oath of office. Sounds more like a description of Willis and congressional Democrats.\nAttack at UNLV: In Nevada, a former college professor with an MBA from Duke University targeted and attacked staff at Lee Business School on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus, killing three people and wounding others before being killed by police. According to early reports, the 67-year-old assailant had applied for work with UNLV’s Lee School but had been rejected. Notably, the lockdown response to the attack continued for hours after the Las Vegas PD announced the assailant had been killed. It also included a ground stop of all flights at Las Vegas International Airport, a shutdown similar to the recent Thanksgiving Day closure of Buffalo International Airport after a false report of a “terrorist attack” at the Niagara Falls bridge. Astoundingly, and typical of the asinine tone-deaf posts by major social media platforms, the UNLV assailant’s LinkedIn page noted, “In memory of Tony Polito — This account has been memorialized as a tribute to Tony Polito’s professional legacy,” though it appears LinkedIn eventually took it down.\nBillions allocated, no chargers installed: Back in 2021, under pressure from Joe Biden for the furtherance of his climate change agenda, Congress allocated $7.5 billion for the construction of hundreds of thousands of electric vehicle charging stations across the country. Two years later, the program has not constructed a single charging station. And Biden wants everyone driving EVs by 2040? Of that $7.5 billion, $2 billion has been sent by federal officials to the states, with fewer than half the states having even begun taking contractor bids for constructing charges. At this rate, the federal government will have built exactly zero charging stations by 2030, when Biden wants half the cars on America’s roads to be EVs. Welp, so much for saving the planet.\nGender fight in Congress: During a House hearing addressing the Biden administration’s proposed changes to Title IX that would effectively redefine sex to include “gender identity” as opposed to biological reality, Democrat Representative Summer Lee (PA) preemptively attacked and smeared the panel of witnesses, including former NCAA swimmer and women’s rights advocate Riley Gaines. Lee inferred they’re guilty of espousing “transphobic” and “hateful misinformation.” Gaines took the smear in stride, expressing her competitive spirit by hitting back at Lee in her opening statement: “If my testimony makes me transphobic, then I believe you’re opening monologue makes you a misogynist.” That triggered Lee, who demanded that Gaines’s words be stricken from the record. Gaines countered by asking, “Can I just ask how it’s fair to be called transphobic?” To which Lee disingenuously responded, “I never called you anything.” After a bit of back and forth with the chair, Lee’s request was denied.\nSneaky nuns bully Smith & Wesson: A group of Second Amendment-opposing Catholic nuns recently filed a lawsuit against firearms manufacturer Smith & Wesson in an effort to prevent the company from making AR-style rifles. The same group of anti-2A nuns first engaged in a sneaky effort to buy up stock in the company and then file shareholder proposals to end the manufacturing of the rifles. The nuns, who are members of four different congregations, effectively deny reality when they claim that AR-style rifles “have stolen the lives of so many innocent people and devastated communities across the nation.” Furthermore, they falsely claim, “These rifles have no purpose other than mass murder.” Vice president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation Lawrence Keane called the nuns’ lawsuit “frivolous,” observing that “this same group has been filing shareholder proposals and losing so I guess they’re trying a new tactic.”\nHeadlines\nFDA delays menthol ban following lobbying war (Roll Call)\nUnion workers at Jeff Bezo’s WaPo plan walkout as insiders question billionaire owner’s role in newsroom drama (Fox News)\nU.S. migrant population reaches largest share in history (The Federalist)\nU.S. military grounds entire fleet of Osprey aircraft following a deadly crash off the coast of Japan (AP)\nDOJ brings first war crimes charges against Russians accused of torturing U.S. citizen in Ukraine (Washington Times)\nJewish woman kicked out of cafe after complaining about anti-Semitic graffiti scrawled all over bathroom, getting berated by workers (New York Post)\nIsraeli forces have started flooding Hamas’s terror tunnels with seawater (Townhall)\nVenezuela orders drilling in Guyanese territory, raising prospects of conflict (Washington Examiner)\nFrench farmers protest taxes with manure (Not the Bee)\nHumor: Keeping you safe: Here are 10 more dangerous J6 criminals the FBI just arrested (Babylon Bee)\nFor more editors’ choice headlines, click here.\nRapid-Onset Gender Dysphoria Targets Women\nWhy does this cultural issue have such vehement backing when all science points against it?\nEmmy Griffin\nWhen the rare mental illness known as gender identity disorder became “gender dysphoria” under the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in 2013, it set in motion a chain of events that have led to the “transgender” craze. This relatively small name change effectively morphed a well-documented mental illness that had always presented in young boys into a more generalized feeling of discomfort with one’s own body that’s become much more prevalent in adolescent girls.\n“Dysphoria” means being uneasy or dissatisfied with life. In essence, the APA name change expanded something serious to make it more codable by the medical system, but in actuality it helped start to foster the monster that would later be dubbed by Dr. Lisa Littman as Rapid-Onset Gender Dysphoria (ROGD).\nIn the early 2010s, renowned Finnish psychiatrist Dr. Riittakerttu Kaltiala was asked to head Finland’s first gender youth clinic and help pioneer the Dutch Protocol model knows more colloquially as “gender-affirming care.”\nIt was shortly after these two factors came into effect that a phenomenon started appearing in this particular field of mental disorders. There was a slow-building explosion of girls and young women who were presenting with the newly minted “gender dysphoria” label. Dr. Kaltiala wrote: “The ones who came were nothing like what was described by the Dutch. We expected a small number of boys who had persistently declared they were girls. Instead, 90 percent of our patients were girls, mainly 15 to 17 years old, and instead of being high-functioning, the vast majority presented with severe psychiatric conditions.”\nWhat scientists like Dr. Kaltiala, Dr. Littman, Dr. Miriam Grossman, and so many others noticed is that these girls were saying they felt uncomfortable in their own bodies, but also that there were other more severe psychiatric symptoms going on underneath that surface-level dysphoria. They also noticed that before claiming gender dysphoria, these girls had no history of having any discomfort in their bodies or having talked about being the opposite gender. In 2018, Dr. Littman named the phenomenon ROGD because the girls’ dysphoria was kind of out of the blue. Besides being rapid in nature, many of these girls also had an autism diagnosis and many “came out” as part of a larger trend among their peers. In other words, it seemed to be a social contagion. This was quickly smeared and politicized by transgender activists.\nHowever, gender dysphoria as a social contagion is a theory that is becoming more true with each passing year. Honest scientists and investigative journalists are coming out of the woodwork to sound the alarm on ROGD mainly because of the other caveat in this case: so-called gender-affirming care.\n“Gender affirmation,” or the Dutch Protocol, is a model of treatment that instructs caregivers to unreservedly provide any medical service available to affirm a person’s psychological desire to become the opposite gender. This generally starts with puberty blockers, which have been falsely marketed as reversible and harmless. Then cross-sex hormones are introduced. For girls, that means testosterone. Next are surgeries: Remove healthy breasts here, create a fake penis there — in other words, gender mutilation in the name of caregiving. None of these treatments is harmless or fully reversible.\nROGD victims are pulled into the rabbit hole of medical transition quickly and all too easily. Some ROGD girls have even reported that they may have been manipulated into it even though they initially weren’t willing to go that far. The other tragic aspect of the medical financial hole that these suffering girls are stumbling into is that with each treatment, the initial euphoria isn’t sustainable. The dysphoria comes back and the girls find they need to go further down the transgender track in their desperate bid to become the other sex.\nThe truth is they will never become the other sex, and they will never feel at home in their own bodies because their bodies aren’t the problem. It’s their minds that are sick and need attending to by the physicians, psychologists, and psychiatrists overseeing their care.\n“Gender-affirming care” and ROGD victims have the surface ability to draw women and men into the trap of “being compassionate.” They demand to know, Is it compassionate to allow a girl to suffer and “remain a girl” if she claims she feels like she should be a boy? This false “compassion” presented by transgender activists and gender-affirmation advocates appeals to the constituents of the party that is guided by their feelings and not their brains (i.e., Democrat voters). It’s not a coincidence that transgenderism is a battleground issue for the Biden administration, as it plays well with Democrats’ main voting bloc: women.\nUsing the “gender-affirming care” model to sweep ROGD under the LGBTQ rug is not compassion. Compassion is suffering with someone. If one is truly compassionate toward these girls presenting with ROGD, then one would strive to get to the real root of their distress. Gender dysphoria is a way of dissociating; it’s not the main underlying issue for these girls. Some use gender dysphoria as a way to protect themselves from past sexual violence or as a way to cover for another, more severe mental illness that is treatable with medicine and therapy.\nDr. Kaltiala has adjusted the requirements for girls who have shown up at her clinic in Finland. She has instructed her coworkers to treat the most severe mental issues first before addressing the “gender dysphoria.” This has worked not only to help these girls who are evidently in distress but also to cut down on the actual number of patients suffering from gender identity disorder. If others were treated in similar compassionate ways, the ROGD diagnosis would drop by as much as 90%.\nDr. Kaltiala and others have tried to warn the U.S. and Europe that “gender affirmation” is a disaster and is destroying girls’ bodies and minds, their families, and their communities through social contagion and the bully tactics of the LGBTQ activists seeking to take advantage. Many European countries are taking heed.\nThese warnings have fallen on deaf ears in the U.S. This medical/psychiatric issue is now a political issue — and one that keeps putting Democrats in office. They aren’t going to back down until the devastation is so obvious that future generations will look back at this time and think what idiots these ideologues were.\nTuberville’s Noble Stand Ends\nWhile he failed to end the Biden administration’s illegal policy facilitating abortions for military personnel, he was right to stand for life.\nThomas Gallatin\nWhy does it seem that so often when it comes to political battles in Washington, Republicans find themselves on the losing end? The answer often lies in the fact that Republican lawmakers by and large have a much harder time uniting, even on core policy issues, than do the goose-stepping Democrats.\nRepublicans’ seemingly inherent disjointedness has resulted in yet another loss for a core policy issue that the party claims to uphold as a primary concern. Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville stood his ground for months, holding up the promotion of hundreds of U.S. military officers over Joe Biden’s decision to use taxpayer dollars to provide abortion access for military members, a breaking of the Hyde Amendment that the “good Catholic” Biden long supported. But Tuberville finally ended his crusade this week.\n“I’m not going to hold the promotions of these people any longer,” Tuberville stated. “We fought hard. We did the right thing for the unborn and for our military, fighting back against executive overreach and an abortion policy.”\nThe Democrat-controlled Senate still had the power to individually vote on promotions, though Democrats and the administration wanted the optics rather than an honest debate. The party of death, the party of unlimited and subsidized abortions, wanted the issue front and center following the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade last year.\nSo, Tuberville stood as the lone Republican senator for months, a man willing to take the smears and jeers of Democrats, their Leftmedia cohorts, and even his own side. Even our Mark Alexander has from the beginning viewed Tuberville’s promotion blockade as absolutely correct on principle but badly flawed in strategy and tactics. He argues Republicans are losing the abortion issue by being viewed as extremists and, in this case, are seen as hurting military readiness.\nRespectfully, the rest of the editorial team here disagrees. Tuberville’s stand was not merely a principled but foolhardy effort; it was an effort to preserve Rule of Law, and if we don’t send our elected representatives to Washington to do that, what are we doing? To borrow a phrase from hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.”\nWhat the old football coach did was take a shot. He took the initiative. He took a stand against the egregious and blatantly unconstitutional action of the Biden administration. His only failure was that his own side abandoned him.\nNear the end, several GOP senators including Joni Ernst (IA), Lindsey Graham (SC), Todd Young (IN), and Mitt Romney (UT) turned on Tuberville and adopted the dubious Democrat claim that Tuberville was endangering military readiness.\nThe question is: Why, after all these months, has Tuberville only now conceded his fight? “Senator Chuck Schumer changed the rules on us,” he argued. “And when you change the rules, it’s hard to beat somebody.” The rule change hadn’t happened quite yet, but the Democrats led by Schumer pushed a resolution that if approved by 60 senators would allow them to circumvent Tuberville. Thanks to the aforementioned Republicans, Schumer was likely to get his rule change approved.\nAs a Hill staffer said of Tuberville’s shift, “This is on everyone who sold him out.”\nAbandoning Bidenomics — the Word, Not the Policies\nBiden and his administration think playing word games will fool people who experience economic hardship.\nSamantha Koch\nIn a recent White House press conference, Karine Jean-Pierre reported to the American people that Joe Biden’s economy — fondly labeled by the current Biden handlers as “Bidenomics” — is working for everyday people, and that the costs of food, toys, and holiday items have all gone down since last year.\nIn his truly iconic way, Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy routinely holds Jean-Pierre accountable for her statements. “On lowering prices,” Doocy pressed, “you said earlier that the actions the president has taken have worked. So, is it your sense that when people were home for Thanksgiving, catching up with their family members, they were saying to each other, ‘Can you believe how much more affordable things have gotten?’”\nIf Jean-Pierre were truly confident in the state of the economy and her belief that it is benefiting middle- and lower-income families throughout the country, the simple answer would have been “Yes.” However, when someone is intentionally being deceitful, they tend to use more words than are needed so as to distract the hearer from the fact that their response has no substance and that their statements aren’t backed by any evidence.\nJean-Pierre’s attempt at coherency went like this: “Honestly, I wouldn’t — I — I hear the question, but I want to make sure this is very clear — we take that very seriously. We take what families, the decisions that they make at their kitchen table, whether it’s at Thanksgiving or whether it’s every month as they’re trying to make hard decisions about how they move forward with taking care of their family — we take that very seriously. It’s not a joke to us. This is very important to us. This is a president who talks about it in a very personal way when he talks about what families have to go through, working families, middle class families. And that’s why he’s taken the actions that he has.”\nIt would seem as though Jean-Pierre feels that aimlessly rambling about Biden’s feelings should satisfy anyone who might be staring at their recent purchase receipts and having different thoughts about the situation.\nIt also seems as though the Biden administration believes that proper branding, paired with the use of comforting words and phrases about caring, should really make everyone feel better about the sorry state of their bank accounts and the dire trajectory of their finances.\nThe administration’s brain trust is thinking hard about the words used to inspire excitement and positivity toward the current U.S. economy. According to NBC News, “Since June, President Joe Biden had been freely peppering the word ‘Bidenomics’ into his speeches and remarks mentioning the economy — 101 times to be exact.”\nNot anymore. The use of this word has backfired, and it has attached this administration to policies that most Americans don’t believe have worked.\nEven Biden’s team seems to understand that Americans are associating their catchword with negative results. People haven’t latched onto the branding effort in the way that Biden’s campaign team would have hoped — which was to hear the word “Bidenomics” and relate it to all of the ways that their families and financial circumstances are thriving.\nSeveral residents from Biden’s hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, were asked how they’re faring in today’s market. One woman said: “It’s tougher for people, ya know? So how could he be seeing it through our eyes?” Another man responded, “This economy sucks. Everything is going up except paychecks.”\nWe know this is astonishing, but the voices of the working class do not align with what is being asserted in the White House press room.\nTo address the public’s increasing stress and displeasure about the rising costs of essentials — never mind trying to squeeze out a few more dollars for holiday extras — Team Biden is now coming to the rescue by changing the branding.\nOver the last couple of weeks in Biden’s speeches and remarks, there has been a noticeable absence of the word “Bidenomics.”\nNot only that, Democrats have now started using the word “MAGAnomics” in an attempt to shift attention away from the horrendous living situation their policies have created for millions of people. They’re reverting to the only tool they have in their limited kit: fear. They use the term “MAGA” and blame Donald Trump and his supporters for the disastrous state of affairs.\nThe Daily Caller explained the emergence of this new word: “The Biden Administration characterizes ‘MAGAnomics’ as an attempt to take away health care and raise prices for Americans by ending [Affordable Care Act] expansion.” The Caller cites a memo released by Democrats on Monday: “Efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Inflation Reduction Act put the differences between Bidenomics and MAGAnomics into sharp perspective.”\nOn that, we agree.\nAccording to the leftists in charge, the solution this holiday season is not for government to stop spending money we don’t have and sending all of our resources overseas, or to find ways to actually lower the costs of goods and essentials that everyday people count on to survive. Instead, they want to rebrand the state of the economy and expect us to believe what we’re told when Biden’s press secretary says that he cares.\nWe’re sure children everywhere will understand when parents use “MAGAnomics” to make them feel better about their empty stockings at Christmas.\nHaley’s Big Demo Donor\nHer acceptance of a $250,000 campaign contribution from LinkedIn lefty Reid Hoffman is disqualifying.\nDouglas Andrews\nNikki Haley has been on a roll of late. The former South Carolina governor has pulled in some 70 new endorsements in Iowa, and last week she kicked off a $10 million ad buy in both the Hawkeye State and New Hampshire.\nBut if Haley thought she had the wind at her back going into last night’s fourth Republican presidential debate — the debate that no one watched — she was disabused of that notion in short order.\n“The only person more fascist than the Biden regime now is Nikki Haley,” said Vivek Ramaswamy in an apparent dig at Haley’s recent call for the outing of everyone who posts comments on social media. Ramaswamy went on to lambaste the former UN ambassador for her ties to the defense industry and the sizable fortune she’s amassed thereby in remarkably short order. “Nikki,” he said, “I don’t have a woman problem. You have a corruption problem.”\nBut it wasn’t just Ramaswamy who went after Haley. It was also Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who himself was fresh off a one-on-one curb-stomping of Democrat shadow candidate Gavin Newsom. “She caves anytime the Left comes after her,” said DeSantis, “anytime the media comes after her. I did a bill in Florida to stop the gender mutilation of minors. It’s child abuse, and it’s wrong. She opposes that bill.”\nIt wasn’t the harsh words of her Republican colleagues that posed the biggest problem for Haley, though. Instead, it was a huge gift to her super PAC from a Democrat mega-donor — a $250,000 donation from LinkedIn cofounder and Big Tech billionaire Reid Hoffman.\nWhy on earth, you ask, would a lefty like Hoffman — a longtime Biden supporter who says he’ll vote for Scranton Joey Bagadonuts again next year — donate such a large sum to a Republican?\nIt’s a great question. And the answer: Simply to meddle. In a LinkedIn post titled “American Democracy, Joe Biden, and Nikki Haley,” Hoffman explained: “I did so because my first priority is American democracy and the integrity of our legal system. That means my first priority is to defeat Trump, and the primary is the first of two chances to do so.”\nApparently, Hoffman thinks that an extra 250 grand is all that’s keeping Nikki Haley from catching fire, winning over 50 million or so Trump voters, and running away with the Republican nomination. Uh-huh.\nAs to Hoffman’s meddlesome gift, DeSantis press secretary Bryan Griffin had this to say: “It makes perfect sense that liberal Democrat billionaires would support Nikki Haley’s bid for the White House because she is a liberal. She would let corporations set immigration policy, roll out the red carpet for China, hike taxes on hardworking Americans, and require social media users to register with the government. Ron DeSantis is bearing the banner of conservatism in this nomination contest and will defeat the swamp, starting with Nikki Haley.”\nIn his justification for trying to rig a Republican primary election, Hoffman trots out one tired trope after another:\nI agree with The Economist that a Trump re-election is the greatest threat the world faces in 2024 and with The Atlantic that a second Trump term would pose an ‘existential threat to America and to the ideas that animate it.’ Those of us who believe in America must link arms to block Donald Trump from regaining the White House. America needs both major parties to nominate sane people who will honor their oath of office. …\nIf America is to avoid another Trump presidency, it will be because Trump loses an election next year. If he is to lose, it will either be to Nikki Haley in the primary, or Joe Biden in the general. I have invested in the Stand for America PAC supporting Nikki Haley because I agree with Jamie Dimon’s recent comments that Democrats should support Haley in the primary and Biden in the general election.\nWhat we have here is a case of election interference. Hoffman is clearly Trump-deranged, and he has no legitimate business meddling in the Republican primary.\nAs for Haley, she should’ve returned that ill-gotten cash. Or donated it to her favorite charity. Or donated it to the Republican National Committee. That she didn’t do so immediately speaks volumes about her tone-deafness and her opportunism.\nIt also says something about her character. But now that Hoffman has exposed her willingness to take money from anyone, all that’s left is to haggle over the price.\nHating God\nMarxists are only interested in using believers until they come to power — after which their religious allies are disposable.\nLaura Hollis\nThe news continues to be filled with shocking accounts of Jew-hatred (or as it is more blandly called, “antisemitism”). Ed Morrissey at HotAir described attacks on Jews and Jewish-owned businesses in Philadelphia and New York City last weekend as an “American Kristallnacht.” Yet another article — this one by Darlene McCormick Sanchez at the Epoch Times — connects the support for Hamas and opposition to Israel with the many Marxist movements that have proliferated in the U.S.\nObservant Jews and believing Christians may take issue with that conclusion; surely one can support the end of hostilities that take the lives of countless innocents without subscribing to Marxist philosophy.\nOf course you can. But the Marxists are using you, nevertheless.\nThroughout the history of Marxism, ideologues and activists have often aligned with religious believers by couching their revolutionary aspirations in terms like “fairness” and “justice” that they know will resonate with those having a religious worldview. But Marxists are only interested in using believers until they come to power — after which their religious allies are disposable.\nKarl Marx himself was quite specific on this point. At best, Marx viewed religion as a necessary evil in a world of oppressors, the need for which (like the state) would wither away once everything was owned by the proletariat, or working class.\nDespite his purported concern for “the people,” Marx was a contemptible racist who referred to Blacks and Hispanics as being “closer to the animal kingdom.” He despised Jews (“The Israelite faith is repulsive to me”) and had nothing but contempt for “hypocritical” Christians, saying, “The social principles of Christianity preach cowardice, self-contempt, abasement [and] submission.” His ultimate goal he expressed thusly: “My object in life is to dethrone God and destroy capitalism.”\nMarx sought not only the abolition of religion and free commercial exchange but “the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions,” including private property, the nuclear family and Judeo-Christian principles of sexual morality.\nIt is no accident, therefore, that his acolytes in America advocate for the sexualization of childhood and grade school curricula, a movement that is little more than a thinly veiled attempt to validate the sexual choices and behaviors of adults and to undermine the moral authority of parents trying to instill traditional values in their children.\nNor is it surprising that certain segments of our society insist that men can become women (and vice versa) merely by so identifying. When one raises the scientific objection that neither personal identification, nor chemical or surgical interventions can change chromosomal biology, one is accused of being a bigot or a “transphobe.” This accusation is tossed out even if those scientific realities are being asserted to protect safety and fairness for women (a group considered by the Left to be an “oppressed” class until about 15 minutes ago), as champion swimmer-turned-activist Riley Gaines saw yet again this week, this time when testifying before Congress.\nIn other words, to point out that human beings are not God triggers sputtering outrage.\nSimilarly, much of the hatred of Israel seems rooted in Jews’ biblical claims of God’s gift of the land to them, a fact overlooked by those claiming Israel is an “occupier.”\nThe same can be said of the laws God gave to the Israelites — most notably, the Ten Commandments, which have provided the foundation for Western society. Those who attack Israel and despise the Jews are openly hostile to the societal principles set forth in the Ten Commandments.\nFor example, God tells us not to steal or even covet other people’s property; Marxists argue that no one should have personal property, and that the government should take people’s property by force and give it to others. God says “Thou shalt not kill”; Marxist revolutions are inevitably bloody affairs — 100 million people have died under communist regimes. God tells us to honor our father and mother; Marxists claim that family ties interfere with the proletariat’s love of the state. (In communist countries, children are routinely encouraged to report their parents to the authorities for being “enemies of the state.”)\nMarxism is utterly unprincipled. The ideology is peppered with phrases like “the end justifies the means” and “whatever it takes to bring about the glorious revolution.” Without a belief in God, there is no supreme authority or natural law to which their own laws and policies must adhere in order to be just.\nInstead, it is the “class struggle” of “oppressor” versus the “oppressed,” a struggle in which the vaunted status of “oppressed” can change in the blink of an eye. Facts don’t matter, history doesn’t matter, philosophical consistency doesn’t matter, theft and enslavement and murder don’t matter.\nIf principles hold no sway with Marxists, neither does precedent. In 2020, Black Lives Matter marches quickly turned to anarchy: riots, arson, looting, violence and even murder. The unrest was often excused as understandable actions by “oppressed” minorities. Now, Jewish Americans who thought they stood proudly with the BLM movement find themselves targeted by increasingly violent mobs shouting, “Intifada revolution!” and “F*** the Jews!”\nWhere are their defenders? Good question. When the college presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania testified before Congress this week, not one would state for the record that calls for Jewish genocide were violations of university policies.\nJust not “oppressed” enough, I guess.\nThe same thing will happen to Christians — yes, even “social justice” Christians — if the Marxists ever take control and no longer need their support.\nThere can absolutely be common cause between those who believe in God and those who don’t (or who simply aren’t sure). But there can be no common cause between those who believe in God and those who hate Him.\nCOPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM\nDon’t Miss Alexander’s Column\nRead Who Wants to Control What You Know?\nIf you’d like to receive Alexander’s Column by email every Wednesday, update your subscription here.\nREADER COMMENTS\nEditor’s Note: Each week we receive hundreds of comments and correspondences — and we read every one of them.

And President Biden has addressed both issues with strength from day one.” —DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas\nBaghdad Bob\n“When the president got into the White House, we all know that the economy was at [sic] a tailspin. … And the president came in and had to fix that because obviously the last administration did not have a comprehensive plan. … The actions that he took … really took effect on the economy in a good way.” —Karine Jean-Pierre\nDumb & Dumber\n“A vote for Donald Trump may mean the last election that you ever get to vote in.” —former Congresswoman Liz Cheney (R-WY)\n“We are talking about opening up all women and girls to genital examinations when they are underage, potentially just because someone can point to someone and say, ‘I don’t think you are a girl.’” —Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY)\n“I know a little something about voter suppression. … My election should not give people the false impression that there’s no voter suppression in Georgia.” —Senator Raphael Warnock (D-GA)\n“The Heritage Foundation loves Texas. … They always sending us some nonsense bills that somehow set this country on the wrong trajectory.

Now many leftist students on these same campuses are marching for Hamas!” —Gary Bauer\n“Perhaps the FBI should be less worried about pro-life Catholics than it is about hateful and potentially violent Hamas-sympathizing atheists and Muslims who want to harm or kill Jews. Perhaps university presidents should get back to educating students instead of indoctrinating them in hateful and potentially violent Marxist ideology. And perhaps adherents of the Religion of Peace™ could stop threatening, attacking, and killing members of other religions.” —Nate Jackson\nTODAY’S MEME\nFor more of today’s memes, visit the Memesters Union.\nTODAY’S CARTOON\nFor more of today’s cartoons, visit the Cartoons archive.\nPlease join us in prayer for our nation — that righteous leaders would rise and prevail and we would be united as Americans.
