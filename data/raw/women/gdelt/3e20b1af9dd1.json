I know we're all here for the Jays (Go Jays Go!) and this season has been spectacular, but pause for a moment and think about this thing you've probably never thought much about before: Canadian Women's Rugby.\nNow, I only even thought to bring this up because there's a few pretty interesting storylines about it. For one, I know as much as most people about rugby, and that's that large bodied individuals crash into each other with devastating force and somehow aren't murdered, and that they can't throw the ball forwards. Due to recent events, I now know more about it and, as they say, knowledge is power. In this case, the power to see what the deal is.\nThe setup? Canadian Women's Rugby, and the sport in general, aren't exactly popular in Canada. We have a long history of the sport: McGill University helped to invent \"Football\" as Americans know it based on rugby, and the CFL itself has a much longer rugby-based history than the 60 or whatever years it has officially been a league. Rugby was around much longer. James Naismith's invention of basketball was based on his background as a rugby player.\nThat being said, the storyline here is Canadian Women's Rugby of today. This year, right now, this week. It's their version of the World Cup, every 4 years, and Team Canada, OUR team, is about to play in the Championship Game vs Jolly Old England in a week. That we're even there is something of a miracle because Team Canada had to crowdfund money to even get to the World Cup. We don't have a kicking coach because we can't afford it. Being a charity case on an international stage is a bit odd, so how does this team make it to the finals? Are the other teams beggars too?\nNo, actually. Team Canada is ranked #2 in the world. The entire reason I'm writing this post and have been reasonably enthralled by this for a day now is because, not only are we ranked #2, these women, this team here from our nation are actually doing something in a sport this old that hasn't been done before. They've figured out how to do something new and frankly pretty amazing, and it's pretty awesome to watch.\nIt isn't like the tactics and play of rugby are unknown, and it isn't like no one has ever figured out how to git gud. Like baseball, hockey, soccer, basketball etc, there's smart people doing smart things. It isn't a small time sport in many other parts of the world. Like how hockey is in Canada, rugby is in several other nations like New Zealand.\nBut here we are now: A sporting revolution possibly occurring within it, started by us here in Canada, conjured up and perfected and trained by a guy who is frankly a brilliant coach, and this team needs only one more win to drive this point home. It kind of feels like Ted Lasso, lol.\nSo maybe take the time a week from now to watch that final. It'll be on TSN, but if you can find it with an Englandish or NZ broadcaster, you know what to do. No one likes an American broadcaster for hockey, you best go to the guys that breathe it.\nIf you're interested, and want to learn what and why someone is good at this game and what Team Canada is doing, here's some videos.\nBoth videos are superbly narrated and by watching them, if you didn't before, you really get a feel and understanding of what kind of skills it requires to play the game and what makes a good player. It was interesting enough to make me write this post, so there's that!\n1 - (3 Weeks ago) The before times, and the explanation of what Team Canada does that isn't that.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Foq1rCWiYuA\n2 - (Today) The World Cup Semi-finals match analysis which, spoiler, Canada wins. This wasn't a game like Canada vs Estonia in the world juniors, this was Canada vs New Zealand, who have, up until this point, never lost an elimination game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGi6idyobGU\nSign in to reply to radivel\nLoading...",
