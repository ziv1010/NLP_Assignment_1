Group B consists of New Zealand, New Caledonia, Tahiti and Solomon Islands.\nThe finalists of the OFC Women’s U-16 Championship will represent Oceania at the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup™ in 2025.\nAmerican Samoa: 0\nSamoa: 11 (Holly LEAPAI 1’, 5’, 10’; Cali WILLIS 2’; Grace TAEOALLI 24’; Tamani SKEERS 45’, 63’; Bree TOATELEGESE 72’, 88; Ayres AVA 90+1; OG 18’)\nHT: 0:6\nContent Sourced from scoop.co.nz\nOriginal url",
