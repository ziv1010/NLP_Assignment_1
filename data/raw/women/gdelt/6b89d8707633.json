Authorities describe the 34-year-old Cavalcante, of Royersford, Montgomery County, as “extremely dangerous.” He was convicted in August of murdering his girlfriend.

Shivanthi Sathanandan, the second vice chairwoman of the Democratic–Farmer–Labor (DFL) Party, reported Wednesday on Facebook she had been assaulted by a group of men outside her home. Yesterday my children and I were violently car jacked in the driveway of our home in Minneapolis,” Sathanandan explained. “Four very young men, all carrying guns, beat me violently down to... -\n[Catholic Caucus] Bishop Strickland’s powerful defense of Church teaching is crucial in the fight for truth\n[Catholic Caucus] Bishop Strickland’s powerful defense of Church teaching is crucial in the fight for truthThe attendees of the 2023 Rome Life Forum will have the opportunity to discuss with Bishop Strickland about how to defend Catholic truth.Tyler’s Bishop Joseph Strickland is due to address the Rome Life Forum taking place shortly after the October 2023 session of the Synod on Synodality concludes.Fresh from the recent publication of two pastoral messages, in which he clearly re-iterated Catholic teaching on a number of points currently under the spotlight of the Synod, Bishop Strickland is set to address similar matters in Rome.... -\nCalifornia city votes to ban universal COVID-19 mask and vaccine mandates\nHuntington Beach was largely defiant of statewide mask mandates throughout the pandemic The City of Huntington Beach, California, voted Wednesday to ban universal mask and vaccine mandates for COVID-19. The matter was submitted by Mayor Pro Tem Gracey Van Der Mark, and included on the city’s agenda for Tuesday. Van Der Mark said mask mandates imposed in the city \"unnecessarily limited the freedoms of the citizens of Huntington Beach — even those who were not around anyone who tested positive for COVID-19 or at risk of any exposure.\" -\nBiden administration considers forcing migrant families to remain in Texas\nThe Biden administration is considering forcing some migrant families who enter the country without authorization to remain near the border in Texas while awaiting asylum screening, effectively limiting their ability to travel within the U.S., three U.S. officials told The Times. Administration officials have been considering the idea as a way to stem recent increases in the numbers of migrant families crossing the southern border, which reportedly reached an all-time high last month. Supporters of the remain-in-Texas idea, which has yet to be finalized, hope that it would help the administration advance its goals of quickly deporting families who fail... -\nVice chair of Minnesota Democrat Party who advocated for dismantling police gets violently beaten and carjacked\nShe now calls for law and order and wants to take her city back. A far-left Minneapolis activist was the victim of a brutal armed car-jacking that occurred in the driveway of her home on Tuesday evening. Shivanthi Sathanandan, a radical leftist and second vice chairwoman of the Democratic Farmer Labor party in Minneapolis, who was left bruised and bloodied during the incident, is calling for \"accountability\" despite her past history of being a notable \"defund the police\" agitator. Sathanandan said in a Facebook post that she suffered a broken leg, deep lacerations to her head, and cuts and bruises... -\nMyths and Realities of the Russian/NATO NCO Systems\nInterestingly enough, a Donbass commander relayed the story of how Ukraine faced disastrous losses in the SMO partly for this reason. When NATO came to overhaul the AFU into their much-vaunted Western NCO system, the Ukrainian officers subsequently saw opportunity to “pull back” from the frontline, considering that to be an obsolete “Soviet” tactic, and figuring the new NATO-trained sergeants can handle leading the charge. The problem is that in the U.S., as Ryan Mcbeth repeatedly emphasizes, sergeants undergo many years of progressive training in order to truly develop the leadership and famed “initiative”-building qualities touted in the West.

The directive, dated Jan. 10, 2021, states that “aggressive mitigation must be used” to combat the virus. It advised “uniform implementation of effective face masking” and “strict physical distancing.”DeSantis, 44, released the letter Thursday, as he accused former President Donald Trump, 77, of being a “power-hungry” bureaucrat. “Even in January of 2021, the Trump-Fauci White House Coronavirus Task Force attacked Florida for being open and demanded Florida impose a mask mandate and enact... -\nUK Unlocks Wegovy: The Game-Changer in Weight Loss Medication\nWegovy, the weight-loss medication, is now accessible in the UK through a controlled and limited introduction.

Twitter/X owner Elon Musk has even got in on the criticism, threatening to bring a lawsuit against the organisation for revenue lost due to their criticisms of the platform. In 2007, the organisation piled pressure on the Holy Father Pope Benedict XVI after his landmark document Summorum Pontificum, which had loosened restrictions on the Latin Mass. The motu proprio led to a boom in young people returning to the faith as well as... -\nSITUATIONAL AWARENESS: Dashcam Video Shows Cabbie Thwart Armed Carjackers\nNow comes a dashcam video from a taxi driver in Chile who narrowly escaped a robbery and carjacking late one night. The taxi driver’s response to the attempted attack looks to be virtually textbook perfect. The incident began with the carjackers forcing their vehicle in front of the taxi driver at an exit (see photo at top). The good guy exercised good personal defensive driving skills, maintaining a healthy separation from the vehicle in front of him. Notice his separation compared to the other drivers in both directions. In this case, after intentionally hanging back from the vehicle in front... -\nU.K. Government Finally Admits It Can't Scan for Child Porn Without Violating Everybody's Privacy\nA surveillance authority in the country’s troubling Online Safety Bill won’t be enforced, officials say. But for how long?The U.K. government finally acknowledges that a component of the Online Safety Bill that would force tech companies to scan data and messages for child porn images can't be implemented without violating the privacy rights of all internet users and undermining the data encryption tools that keep our information safe. And so the government is backing down—for now—on what's been called the \"spy clause.\" Using the justification of fighting the spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), part of the Online Safety... -\nDOJ seeks 120-day prison term for J6 journalist who never entered Capitol, spoke out about 'stolen election' on air\nCernovich @Cernovich DOJ seeks 120-day prison term for J6 journalist who never entered Capitol, spoke out about 'stolen election' on air thepostmillennial.com DOJ seeks 120-day prison term for J6 journalist who never entered Capitol, spoke out about ‘stolen... 12:37 PM · Sep 7, 2023 -\nIs India Changing Its Name to Bharat? G20 Invite Controversy Explained\nNEW DELHI: Invites sent by Indian President Droupadi Murmu calling herself \"President of Bharat\" for a dinner on the sidelines of the G20 summit have stirred speculation that the government may be about to change the country's name. WHAT IS THE CONTROVERSY ABOUT INDIA'S NAME? By convention, invitations issued by Indian constitutional bodies have always mentioned the name India when the text is in English, and the name Bharat when the text is in Hindi. However, the invites - in English - for the G20 dinner called Murmu the President of Bharat. An official at the president's office said they... -\nDisney drops all but free speech claim in political retaliation suit against DeSantis [Disney Folds]\nDisney amended its federal lawsuit against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to focus solely on its First Amendment claim that the governor politically retaliated against the company. Disney last week had asked to drop its other claims in the case because they are being actively pursued in a separate state-level lawsuit in Florida. It’s the latest wrinkle stemming from Disney’s battle with DeSantis that began when the company publicly denounced the controversial classroom bill dubbed “Don’t Say Gay” by critics. ... The revision, which nixes four claims Disney had previously presented in the case, shrinks the company’s federal civil complaint to... -\nMorning Joe Buries Looming Hunter Indictment, Rips 'Howling' Republicans\nThe most explosive news Thursday morning was that special counsel David Weiss has announced that he expects to indict Hunter Biden this month for possessing a gun while being a narcotics user -- a felony that carries a potential 10-year prison sentence. But despite Morning Joe's Mika Brzezinski calling it \"big news,\" the show buried the story deep in its fourth and final hour -- and even then devoted barely two minutes to it. Get the rest of the story and view the video here. -\nActor Danny Masterson sentenced to 30 years to life in prison for rape\nA judge sentenced That '70s Show star Danny Masterson to 30 years to life in prison Thursday for the rapes of two women two decades ago. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charlaine F. Olmedo handed down the sentence to Masterson, 47, after hearing statements from the women about the trauma they experienced and the suffering caused by the disturbing memories in the years since.

CHARTER COULD BE THE END OF THE CABLE BUNDLE…AND SPORTS AS WE KNOW IT\nIn the summer of 2014, the cable and satellite bundle peaked. One hundred million households were subscribed to ESPN, the most successful channel in the history of cable, and the apex of the greatest business in the history of media had been reached. But no one knew it. Cable, satellite, and media executives were all blissfully unaware of what was coming. Fox Sports FS1 had launched the prior year — yours truly appeared on the very first show in the history of the network, a 2013 college football preview show. In the summer of 2014 the SEC Network would make... -\nHomeless destroy motel in Wyoming city, leave about 500 pounds in feces on streets: mayor\nA city in Wyoming has been overrun with an unprecedented homeless population that’s destroyed a vacant motel and has left hundreds of pounds of feces across the area, according to its mayor. Mayor Bruce Knell detailed the destructive behavior of roughly 200 homeless people in Casper, WY who have been creating a “mess” throughout the streets and parks, as well as a closed motel where squatters left millions in property damage. “They destroyed everything,” he told Cowboy State Daily. “It’s horrible.” Homeless people who squatted at the Econo Lodge motel caused more damage than the flooding that initially closed the...\nBrowse by Forum\nGet Connected!
