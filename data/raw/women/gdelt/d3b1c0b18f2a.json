In many cases, the Class A Shares are registered in the name of your representative, such as a broker, bank, trust company, or trustee, rather than in your name. As noted above, since Rogers is using notice-and-access, we are not mailing paper copies of information circulars and annual financial statements to shareholders unless specifically requested.\nWe are not sending notices of the meeting or proxy forms directly to non-objecting beneficial owners (NOBOs) as permitted under NI 54-101. Instead, we have distributed copies of the notice of meeting to the intermediaries for onward distribution to non-registered shareholders. Intermediaries are required to forward these materials, along with a voting instruction form to all non-registered shareholders for whom they hold shares unless they have waived the right to receive them. We do not pay for intermediaries to deliver proxy-related materials to objecting beneficial owners (OBOs).\nGenerally, non-registered shareholders who have not waived the right to receive meeting materials will receive a voting instruction form from their intermediary, or its agent on behalf of their intermediary, asking for their voting instructions. Non-registered shareholders who receive materials from their intermediary or their agent should complete the voting instruction form and submit it to them as instructed on the voting instruction form. The intermediary or its agent is responsible for tabulating the voting instructions it receives and providing appropriate instructions to our transfer agent, TSX Trust Company.\nHOW DOES A NON-REGISTERED HOLDER OF CLASS A SHARES GIVE VOTING INSTRUCTIONS?\nYour representative may have sent to you the notice of meeting, including a voting instruction form or a blank proxy form signed by the representative. You may provide your voting instructions by filling in the appropriate boxes. Please follow your representative's instructions for signing and returning the applicable materials. Sometimes you may be allowed to give your instructions by Internet or telephone.\nNon-registered holders of Class A Shares who have not duly appointed and registered themselves as proxyholder will not be able to vote at the meeting but will be able to attend the meeting and ask questions. This is because the Company and our transfer agent, TSX Trust Company, do not have a record of the non-registered holders of Class A Shares, and, as a result, will have no knowledge of their shareholdings or entitlement to vote unless they appoint themselves as proxyholder.\nHOW DOES A NON-REGISTERED HOLDER OF CLASS A SHARES VOTE IN PERSON AT THE MEETING?\nYou can request your representative to appoint you as its proxyholder. Insert your own name as proxyholder on the voting instruction form or proxy form you received from your representative and then follow your representative's instructions.\nHOW DOES A NON-REGISTERED HOLDER OF CLASS A SHARES VOTE ONLINE AT THE MEETING?\nIf you are a non-registered holder of Class A Shares and wish to attend and vote online at the meeting, you can request your representative to appoint you as its proxyholder. Insert your own name as proxyholder on the voting instruction form or proxy form you received from your representative and then follow your representative's instructions.

DIRECTORS' RESTRICTED SHARE UNIT PLAN\nOn January 31, 2024, the Board approved the Directors' Restricted Share Unit Plan (the Directors' RSU Plan). Directors of the Company (other than the CEO) or any other corporation related to the Company may receive restricted share units (RSUs) under the Directors' RSU Plan.\nIn accordance with the policies of the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), the Company is required to submit the Directors' RSU Plan for approval by the holders of the Class A Shares at the meeting. No RSUs will be granted until the Directors' RSU Plan has been approved by the holders of the Class A Shares at the meeting. If approved by the holders of Class A Shares at the meeting, the Directors' RSU Plan will be effective as of April 24, 2024. As more fully described below, pursuant to the Directors' RSU Plan, unless otherwise determined by the Corporate Governance Committee, participants (i) will be awarded 2,500 RSUs per fiscal year; and (ii) may elect to receive up to 100% of their quarterly remuneration in RSUs. Participants that have satisfied their minimum securities ownership requirement, as described below, may elect to receive up to 1,500 of their annual RSU grant in cash.\nThe Directors' RSU Plan, if approved by the holders of Class A Shares at the meeting, is expected to replace the Directors' Deferred Share Unit Plan (the Directors' DSU Plan) as the principal equity compensation plan for directors. For further information on the Directors' DSU Plan, see \"Director Compensation\".\nIn addition, and subject to the approval of the Directors' RSU Plan by the holders of Class A Shares at the meeting, the director minimum securities ownership requirement is expected to be amended to require each non-employee director of the Company to own, from the fifth anniversary of their election or appointment to the Board and thereafter until they cease to be a director of the Company, an aggregate of at least 12,000 Class A Shares, Class B Non-Voting Shares, RSUs and DSUs, in any combination.\nA description of the Directors' RSU Plan is provided below assuming that the Directors' RSU Plan, as presented to the holders of the Class A Shares, is approved at the meeting.\nSUMMARY OF DIRECTORS' RSU PLAN | | Type: | |\nRestricted Share Units\n|\nEligibility: | |\nAll directors of the Company or any other corporation related to the Company are eligible, other than the CEO of the Company.\n| Overview: | |\nAn RSU is a right to acquire a newly issued Class B Non-Voting Share. RSUs are intended to track the value of the Class B Non-Voting Shares and accordingly, when dividends are paid, additional RSUs are credited to the participant's RSU account based on the market price of the Class B Non-Voting Shares on the dividend payment date.\nThe Company will settle vested RSUs by issuing Class B Non-Voting Shares from treasury.\nThe maximum number of Class B Non-Voting Shares that may be issued under the Directors' RSU Plan is 2,000,000. This represents approximately 0.38% of the aggregate number of Class A Shares and Class B Non-Voting Shares outstanding as at December 31, 2023.\nThe Corporate Governance Committee of the Board will administer the Directors' RSU Plan.\nThe number of Class B Non-Voting Shares that may be (i) issued to insiders within any one year period, or (ii) issuable to insiders at any time, in each case, under the Directors' RSU Plan alone or when combined with all other security-based compensation arrangements of the Company, cannot\n|\n2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC.| 23\nTable of Contents | | |\nexceed 10% of the aggregate number of outstanding Class A Shares and Class B Non-Voting Shares.\nThe number of Class B Non-Voting Shares that may be (i) issued to any one insider and that insider's associates in a 12-month period under the Directors' RSU Plan alone or when combined with all other security-based compensation arrangements of the Company cannot exceed 5% of the aggregate number of outstanding Class A Shares and Class B Non-Voting Shares; or (ii) reserved for issuance to any one person under the plan alone or when combined with all other security-based compensation arrangements of the Company cannot, at any time, exceed 5% of the aggregate number of outstanding Class A Shares and Class B Non-Voting Shares.\n| | |\nAwards: | |\nParticipants may elect to receive up to 100% of their quarterly remuneration in RSUs, subject to any minimum amount that may be required by the Corporate Governance Committee. The number of RSUs to be granted is determined by dividing the dollar value of the participant's applicable quarterly election amount by the market price on the first business day of the applicable fiscal quarter.\nMarket price is determined using the five-day volume weighted average price of Class B Non-Voting Shares for the five business days preceding the applicable date.\nUnless otherwise determined by the Corporate Governance Committee, participants will be awarded 2,500 RSUs per fiscal year (the Annual Entitlement), in addition to any RSUs granted with respect to the quarterly election amount. Participants that have satisfied their minimum securities ownership requirement may elect to receive up to 1,500 of these RSUs in cash per fiscal year.\n| | |\nVesting & Expiry: | |\nUnless otherwise determined by the Corporate Governance Committee or as contemplated in the Directors' RSU Plan, RSUs cliff vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. If such third anniversary date falls during or within five business days immediately following a blackout period, the applicable vesting date will be deemed to be the sixth business day immediately following the expiration of such blackout period.\n| | |\nExercise or Payout: | |\nVested RSUs plus credited dividends are settled as Class B Non-Voting Shares as soon as practicable after the vesting date.\nApplicable cash payments to participants made in satisfaction of the Annual Entitlement are calculated by multiplying the number of RSUs elected to be received in cash by the market price as at the applicable grant date.\n| | |\nTreatment on Termination of Service: | |\nUnvested RSUs held as at the date that a participant ceases to provide services to the Company (for any reason whatsoever) will vest effective as of such date and will be redeemed by the Company as soon as practicable.\n| | | Change in Control: | |\nIn the event of a change in control of the Company, the outstanding RSUs will be assumed or substituted for similar awards by the successor or acquiring entity, failing which, the RSUs will be vested and redeemed in connection with the change in control. In addition, the Board may determine that the Company shall redeem any RSUs which are outstanding at the time of the change in control and may, among other things, otherwise modify the terms of the RSUs to permit the holders to tender to a takeover bid or other arrangement leading to a change in control.\n| | |\nAssignment & Transferability of Awards: | |\nRSUs are not transferable or assignable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution in the event of the death of a participant.\n|\n24 |ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC. 2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR\nTable of Contents | | |\nAmendment and Termination of Plan: | |\nThe Corporate Governance Committee may, subject to applicable law and regulatory approval and subject to applicable security holder approval in certain circumstances, amend, suspend or terminate the Directors' RSU Plan or any portion thereof or any RSU at any time, provided that no such amendment, suspension or termination may materially adversely alter or impair the rights of a participant under any RSU previously granted to such\nparticipant without the consent of the affected participant. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Corporate Governance Committee may\nmake the following types of amendments to the Directors' RSU Plan or any RSUs without seeking security holder approval: (a) amendments of a \"housekeeping\" or administrative nature; (b) amendments necessary to comply with the provisions of applicable law or the rules, regulations and policies of the TSX, or to qualify for favourable treatment under applicable tax laws; (c) amendments to the vesting, termination or early termination provisions of the Directors' RSU Plan or any RSU; and (d) amendments necessary to suspend or terminate the Directors' RSU Plan.\nSecurity holder approval is required for the following types of amendments to the Directors' RSU Plan or any RSUs: (a) amendments to increase the maximum number of Class B Non-Voting Shares issuable under the Directors' RSU Plan other than in connection with reorganizations or other changes to the capitalization of the Company; (b) amendments extending eligibility to participate in the Directors' RSU Plan to persons other than non-CEO directors of the Company; (c) amendments to remove or to exceed the insider participation limit set out in the Directors' RSU Plan; (d) amendments which delete or reduce the range of amendments which require approval by the security holders; and (e) amendments required to be approved by security holders under applicable law or the rules, regulations and policies of the TSX.\n|\nA copy of the Directors' RSU Plan is attached to this circular as Appendix D.\nThe resolution to adopt the Directors' RSU Plan which will be presented at the meeting and, if deemed appropriate, approved with or without variation, is as follows:\n''1. THAT the Directors' Restricted Share Unit Plan, as described in the Information Circular of the Company dated March 5, 2024 under the heading ''Directors' Restricted Share Unit Plan\", is hereby adopted and approved;\n2.

The net cumulative result across all components was 100% achievement.\nOur Long-Term Incentive Plan provides grants of Performance Restricted Share Units. Approved adjusted EBITDA levels were achieved in each of the three years 2021 - 2023, resulting in 100% payout of grants made in 2021. See additional detail provided later in \"Compensation Decisions for 2023-2024\".\nCEO COMPENSATION AND PERFORMANCE\nMr. Staffieri's compensation, benefits and pension were set in alignment with the Company's executive compensation philosophy, including careful review of market positioning for the role and in consideration of industry-leading 2023 performance. Reflecting 2023 performance, bonus tied 100% to Company Performance and paid out at 100% of target or $1,400,000, and the Committee granted a $9,000,000 LTIP award to the CEO. Details can be found in the \"Summary Compensation Table\".\nSUCCESSION PLANNING\nThe Committee met during the year to discuss succession planning for the CEO as well as other critical senior executive roles. This review includes getting to know key talent, creating tangible developmental moves with defined actions and timing, and forming risk mitigation plans to ensure a strong internal pipeline for future growth.\nCOMPENSATION PROGRAMS FOR 2023\nEach year, we review our compensation programs to ensure they are aligned with our priorities and good governance practices while also being consistent with relevant market practices.\n2023 Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP) Design |\n•\n| |\nIn consideration of the ongoing Shaw Integration, and our focus on \"team\", the Committee approved a consistent design with overall program design remaining unchanged from 2022 (60% weighted on Company performance and 40% weighted on Business Unit / Function & Team performance) when we replaced Employee measures with Network measures to ensure we deliver world-class connectivity and re-introduced a minimum adjusted EBITDA achievement to receive payouts.\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nThere is clear line of sight between our 2023 STIP targets and external shareholder guidance given at the beginning of the year and increased during 2023.\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nTargets remained numerical with clear underpinning measurements.\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nWe continue to provide executives with the opportunity to receive 0%, 50% or 100% of their bonus in Deferred Share Units (DSUs). Elections made in December 2023 will apply to STIP payouts made in March 2025.\n|\nShaw Bonus Program |\n•\n| |\nAs part of our acquisition of Shaw, we provided a multi-year special performance-based incentive tied directly to integration metrics that drive long-term value for shareholders. We explained this program in our 2022 circular and the program remained the same in 2023. Participants were given the option to receive their award in the form of Performance Stock\n|\n2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC.| 27\nTable of Contents |\nOptions (PSOs) or Performance Restricted Share Units (PRSUs) vesting 50% per year over a two-year period. Reflective of our success in the early achievement of integration milestones, specifically achieving $750M annualized savings in nine months against a 24-month savings target of $1B, the Shaw Special Bonus metrics for the first year were met and will vest in June 2024.\n|\n2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) Design |\n•\n| |\nSince 2022, NEOs can elect their annual LTI grant to be either a mix of 50% Stock Options (SOs) and 50% PRSUs, the default mix, or up to 100% in the form of SOs or PRSUs. In 2023, Mr. Staffieri elected to receive 100% of his LTIP in SOs. In 2024, as part of the Committee's review, we will discuss the long-term incentive plan, including the PRSU design.\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nContinuing with the existing DSU plan, executives can receive 0%, 50% or 100% of their long-term incentive in DSUs. Elections made in December 2023 will apply to LTI grants made in March 2025.\n|\nINDEPENDENT RISK ASSESSMENT\nThe Committee's mandate includes a biennial assessment of the impact of both short- and long-term incentive plans on risk-taking to ensure the plans do not incent risk-taking beyond the Company's risk tolerance. Willis Towers Watson, our historical partner, completed their review in December 2022, and consistent with the previous review, concluded there do not appear to be significant risks arising from RCI's compensation programs and practices that are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Additional detail can be found in \"Compensation Risk Oversight and Governance\".\n2024 PRIORITIES\nThe Committee will continue to review the Company's executive compensation programs on a regular basis to ensure they remain competitive with the external market, and aligned with the business priorities to deliver long-term sustainable value to you, our shareholders. Following the close of the Shaw Transaction, we have reviewed and refined our peer group benchmarking to reflect the new scale of our assets. Details are provided in \"Benchmarking\" and \"Peer Group\" within the \"Executive Compensation Philosophy and Objectives\".\nCONCLUSION\nOn behalf of the Human Resources Committee and the Board, we invite you to review the following sections, which provide more details on our executive compensation programs and actual pay for our top executives in 2023.

Effective February 12, 2024, Mr. Wickramasinghe was appointed President, Group Operations.\n|\nMr. Zoran Stakic, former President, Residential resigned in December 2023 and departed Rogers in March 2024. He held the role effective September 25, 2023 prior to which he served as Chief Transformation Officer. Mr. Stakic joined Rogers following the Shaw Transaction on May 5, 2023 and during his tenure, he received a sign-on cash bonus of $1,500,000 and a one-time special integration award of $4,000,000 in the form of PRSUs contingent upon the achievement of one- and two-year milestones related to the Shaw Transaction. As outlined in his employment agreement and per the terms of the incentive plan, Mr. Stakic forfeited all of his PRSUs and repaid a portion of his sign-on cash bonus in an amount prorated to the time in the role. Mr. Stakic's compensation in 2023 outside of the sign-on bonus and one-time special integration award consisted of the following: base salary earned of $392,308, annual bonus earned of $345,623, a pension value of $32,700 and other compensation of $20,401. Mr. Stakic's total compensation inclusive of his sign-on bonus and one-time special integration award would have been $6,291,032, however actual 2023 total compensation considering forfeited PRSUs and repayment of sign-on bonus was $978,532.\nWithin this section, Other Named Executive Officers (Other NEOs) refers to the three named executive officers excluding the CEO and CFO.\nHUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE\nAll Human Resources Committee members have a solid understanding of policies, principles, and governance related to human resources and executive compensation.

For each meeting, the agenda is designed to ensure the Human Resources Committee is provided with a comprehensive presentation on matters for which the Human Resources Committee has oversight. For further information, please refer to the \"Director Orientation and Continuing Education\" section of this circular.\nRole of the Human Resources Committee\nThe Human Resources Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight of the compensation, benefits, succession planning, and talent management programs for the Company's executives. For more information on the Human Resources Committee's mandate, please refer to Appendix C to this circular or visit the Corporate Governance section of the Company's website at investors.rogers.com/corporate-governance.\nThe Human Resources Committee meets periodically throughout the year to review key items according to its mandate and annual work plan. The Chair of the Board and members of both the Board and management, including the CEO, attend the meetings at the invitation of the Chair of the Human Resources Committee. At each meeting, there is an in-camera session without management.\nThe Human Resources Committee's decisions about executive compensation policies and practices are made within the context of the Company's purpose to connect Canadians when and where they want and the ambition to be number one in Wireless, Cable, and Media. To this end, the Human Resources Committee's mandate is to oversee management in the attraction, retention, and succession of talented, diverse, and highly motivated people who will excel in a fast-paced, dynamic environment and who have the responsibility of growing market share, the long-term profitability of the Company, and increasing financial returns to shareholders.\nA key focus of the Human Resources Committee's annual work plan is building talent, deepening bench strength, and ensuring that succession plans are in place for the most key roles in the Company. Annually, the CEO provides a comprehensive update to the Human Resources Committee on the strengths of the overall executive leadership team and areas on which to focus development. This includes a review of talent diversity and the plans in place to both retain and accelerate the development of the Company's strongest leaders.\n30 |ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC. 2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR\nTable of Contents2023 Highlights\nThe Human Resources Committee met seven times in 2023 to review and approve a number of initiatives:\n| Topic | |\nHighlights | |\nCEO Performance,\nPriorities, and\nCompensation | |\n• Reviewed and evaluated CEO priorities for 2023\n• Recommended CEO compensation to the Board\n| | Talent Management,\nSuccession Planning,\nand Diversity | |\n• Continued talent development and action planning for CEO direct reports and other critical executive roles informed by CEO assessment and key insights to ensure a diverse leadership team across Rogers, including executives joining after closing the Shaw Transaction\n• Discussed profile, performance scorecards together with current and future expectations for the CTIO and the President roles leading Business, Residential, Rogers Sports & Media and Wireless\n| | Performance and\nCompensation of\nSenior Executive\nOfficers | |\n• Reviewed the alignment of 2023 achievements and resulting funding levels approved for executive and broad-based employee incentive plans based on this achievement\n| | Plan Design | |\n• Approved the 2024 STIP and LTIP design together with the 2024 salary merit budget\n• Reviewed and approved updates to wealth accumulation programs to ensure they remain competitive as part of harmonizing programs after the closing of the Shaw Transaction\n| | Governance | |\n• Recommended for approval updates to policies and practices on executive compensation to the Board\n• After the closing of the Shaw Transaction, approved plan and program changes enabling effective harmonization, including updated financial performance metrics for 2023 incentive plans reflecting the combined entity\n• Approved an updated compensation Clawback Policy to comply with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission listing standards\n| | Public Disclosure | |\n• Reviewed and approved the circular in respect of the Company's 2023 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders\n|\nINDEPENDENT COMPENSATION ADVISOR\nThe Human Resources Committee engages an independent advisor that is directly retained by, receives instructions from, and reports to the Human Resources Committee. All work performed by the advisor must be pre-approved by the Human Resources Committee. The advisor's role is to provide independent advice, analysis, and expertise to assist the Human Resources Committee in evaluating compensation recommendations put forward by management in order to ensure sound decisions are made within an effective governance framework.\nWhile the Human Resources Committee considers the information and recommendations provided by the independent advisor, it ultimately relies upon its own judgment and experience in making compensation decisions.\n2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC.| 31\nTable of Contents\nThe Human Resources Committee has engaged Hugessen Consulting Inc. (Hugessen) as its independent advisor since August 2006. Hugessen provides no other services to the Company. In 2023, Hugessen provided advice related to merger-integration activities (e.g., review of compensation philosophy and peer group, considerations for post-merger incentive structure, competitive performance and pay vs. peers based on financial profile of the combined entity). Hugessen also advised the Committee on pay governance matters throughout the year (e.g., clawback policy).\n| Executive Compensation-related Fees | | | | Advisor | |\n2023 | | |\n2022\n| |\nHugessen\n| |\n$ |\n416,842 | | |\n$\n|\n215,387\n| |\nCOMPENSATION RISK OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNANCE\nOn behalf of the Board, management conducts regular assessments of the Company's executive compensation plans to evaluate whether there are any compensation-related risks within the plans that are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Human Resources Committee is confident that the Company's compensation structure is balanced and well governed, and encourages calculated risk-taking that positively impacts the Company. Similar to the assessment conducted by Willis Towers Watson in December 2020, their latest assessment conducted in December 2022 found compensation risk management continued to be strong at Rogers with no significant risks arising from compensation programs and practices that are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Human Resources Committee will continue to review and introduce changes, as required, to maintain alignment of our programs with the Company's risk management framework.\nRogers' compensation governance practices include, among others, the following:\nAnti-Hedging Policy\nRogers prohibits its reporting insiders, including its directors and NEOs, from dealing in puts and calls, affecting any short sales, dealing in futures, option transactions, or equity monetization, or engaging in any other hedging transactions relating to the Company's shares without the prior approval of the Corporate Governance Committee.\nCEO Post-Retirement Hold\nThe CEO is required to maintain his share ownership position of five times base salary equivalent for a period of one year following retirement or resignation from the Company.\nRecoupment Policy (Clawback)\nIn 2023, this policy was revised to comply with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's new listing standards (Rule 10D-1) for recovery of erroneously awarded compensation.\nThis policy applies to current and former executives including the CEO, CFO, Controller and executives in charge of business units or performing a policy-making function. In the event of an accounting restatement due to material non-compliance or error in previously issued financial statements, this policy provides for a clawback of all incentive awards, based wholly or in part upon the attainment of financial measures in the previous three fiscal years. This policy applies to the gross amount of all erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation received on or after October 2, 2023.\n32 |ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC. 2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR\nTable of ContentsShare Ownership Requirements\nThe share ownership requirements are designed to link the interests of executives to those of our shareholders by encouraging an ownership position in the Company.\nTo the extent an executive has not satisfied the share ownership requirements, they are required to receive any annual cash bonus in excess of 100% of target in the form of RSUs or DSUs. RSUs vest no later than June 15th of the third calendar year following the calendar year in which the bonus was earned, while DSUs vest immediately. For detailed information on the design features and provisions of these long-term incentive vehicles, please see the \"Summary of Long-term Incentive Plans\" section.

The primary objectives of our executive compensation programs are to:\n|\n•\n| |\nattract and motivate talented executives in a competitive environment;\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nreward executives appropriately for exceptional organizational and business unit performance (opportunity for above median total direct compensation for above median performance);\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nalign compensation with performance over both the short- and long-term;\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nalign management's interests with those of shareholders through performance conditions in incentive plans and share ownership requirements;\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nretain high-performing executives and encourage their long-term career commitment to the Company through diversity of experience and differentiation of pay; and\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nensure that our compensation plans align with good governance practices and do not incent risk-taking behaviour beyond the Company's risk tolerance.\n|\nVarious performance measures are used in the Company's STIP and LTIP in order to balance the objectives that facilitate annual growth and those that reward the creation of long-term shareholder value. Continuing to maintain the Customer and Network measures in the STIP first\n2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC.| 33\nTable of Contents\nintroduced in the 2022 STIP, in addition to strong Financial Performance measures, reflects our commitment to keeping the executive team focused on the importance of creating and maintaining customer loyalty.\nPhilosophy and Positioning\nThe Human Resources Committee follows the philosophy of generally positioning our target total direct compensation (salary + target short-term incentive awards + target long-term incentive awards) of the NEOs at or above the median of the competitive market. While market assessment is relative to a defined peer group of large publicly traded Canadian companies, the individual's skills, qualifications, abilities, retention risk, experience, and performance may be considered in determining the appropriate level and mix of pay for a NEO. See \"Benchmarking\" in \"Executive Compensation Philosophy and Objectives\" for further details regarding the peer group.\nCompensation for an executive may also be set above median to reflect the strategic importance of the role within the Company, market conditions, individual experience, sustained performance in the role, and potential. To determine appropriate pay levels and mix of pay elements, the Company may also review the pay practices of other companies in the telecommunications industry. Specific positioning by compensation element is captured below.\nNEO Total Rewards At-A-Glance | | |\nBase Salary | | | |\nShort-Term\nIncentive | | | |\nLong-Term\nIncentive | | | | Benefits &\nPerquisites | | | | Wealth\nAccumulation\nProgram | | | | | | | | | | | Total Cash Compensation\nTotal Direct Compensation\nTotal Rewards | |\nAnnual Salary\n| | |\nAnnual Incentive Plan\n| | |\nStock Options\nPerformance Stock Options\nPerformance Restricted Share Units\nDeferred Share\nUnits\n| | |\nBenefits Plan\nWell-being Program\nExecutive Allowance\nService Discounts\n| | |\nEmployee Share Accumulation Plan\nDefined Benefit & Defined Contribution Pension Plans\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)\nGlobal Registered Retirement Savings Plan & Tax-Free Savings Account\n| | | | | | | | | | Objective: | |\nReward sustained individual contribution.\n| | | |\nReward based on annual Company and Business Unit/Function performance.\n| | | |\nReward potential and align pay to shareholder interest and long-term objectives.\n| | | |\nEnsure employee well-being with balanced offerings.\n| | | |\nSupport employee savings for various life events,\nincluding retirement.\n| Positioning: | |\nPositioned at the median on average, between median and top quartile for top talent.\n| | | |\nTarget awards aligned with median.

The 2023 annual long-term incentive grant for the NEOs was composed of either a mix of 50% SOs and 50% PRSUs or up to 100% SOs or PRSUs as elected by the NEO. Similar to last year, executives could make elections to defer 0%, 50% or 100% of bonus and/or LTI into DSUs. Elections made in December 2023 will be applicable to bonus payouts in March 2025 (in respect of the 2024 bonus performance year) and LTI grants made in March 2025. Based on elections made in December 2022, the CEO will be receiving 50% of his 2023 STIP and 100% of his LTI grants made in 2024 in the form of DSUs.\nOther key components of the 2023 Total Rewards for the NEOs include benefits and perquisites, as well as participation in the Wealth Accumulation Program (WAP). The WAP for the NEOs includes executive pension plans as well as group savings programs offered broadly to all eligible employees, including the Employee Share Accumulation Plan (ESAP), the Global Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), and the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA).\n| | |\nTotal Direct Compensation | | | | | | | |\nBase Salary | | |\n• Fixed annual rate of pay\n• Individual salary tied to competitive market for talent, individual experience, sustained contribution, performance, and potential\n| | | | | | | | | | | Short-Term Incentive Plan | | |\n• Annual bonus.

These companies were selected based on revenue and market capitalization levels and to ensure cross-industry representation. To avoid over weighting the sample, we limited the number of financial services and energy companies. The peer group was reviewed and updated in late 2023 following the closing of the Shaw Transaction to capture the financial profile of the combined entity. The market levels of the updated peer group will inform policy decisions which will be reviewed as part of executive compensation policy updates in 2024 with any recommended salary or incentive updates coming into effect in 2025. Assets and EBITDA were additional criteria considered in updating the 2024 peer group as well as a focus on companies where talent competition was most relevant.\nAny changes are subject to the Human Resources Committee's review and approval.

The Company's commitment to pay for performance is reflected in its variable compensation plans (or 'at-risk' pay), which are strongly influenced by both the individual's performance and the Company's business results. See \"Compensation Decisions for 2023-2024\" for a view of target total direct compensation mix.\nCOMPENSATION DECISIONS FOR 2023-2024\nInput from Management\nThe Human Resources Committee engages in active discussions with, and considers recommendations from, the CEO concerning:\n|\n•\n| |\nbase salaries, considering internal pay equity among executives and external market competitiveness;\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nparticipation in the incentive programs and award levels;\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nperformance metrics for the incentive plans;\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nperformance targets, at the company and team levels for the coming year, where applicable; and\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nactual achievement of performance against pre-determined targets.\n|\nThe Company's Chief Human Resources Officer is involved in the compensation-setting process through the preparation of information for the Human Resources Committee, which includes the recommendations of the CEO. The Human Resources Committee may also seek input from its independent compensation advisor, as determined by the Chair.\nAnnual Compensation Review\nSalaries, STIP targets, and LTIP targets are reviewed annually by the Human Resources Committee, with input from the CEO with respect to Other NEOs.

In 2023, corporate performance was achieved at 100%.\n|\n2023 LTIP Awards\nAt the beginning of each fiscal year, the Human Resources Committee approves the value of target LTIP awards to be granted and, with the exception of the CEO's LTIP, receives and reviews recommendations from the CEO. Individual grants are determined within an approved range to reflect individual performance and contribution to the long-term value creation for the Company.\nUnder the current PRSU design, each year the applicable adjusted EBITDA target is achieved, one third of the award becomes eligible to vest at a maximum of 100%, for payout at the end of the three-year performance period. If the target for the year is not achieved, one third of the award is cancelled. This target represents 90% of the approved adjusted EBITDA in the business plan. As this level was achieved in 2023, together with target achievement in 2021 and in 2022, PRSUs granted in 2021 will be paid out at the maximum level of 100%.\nTypically, the Human Resources Committee does not take previous grants or length of service into account when setting new grants. In consideration of individual performance during the year, a new hire, or a promotion, the Human Resources Committee may approve an award which differs from the targeted annual grant level based on their assessment of the rationale provided by the CEO. In 2023, Ms. Watson received a one-time special integration award contingent upon the achievement of one-andtwo-year milestones for the strategic importance of decisions within the Media portfolio following the close of the Shaw Transaction.\nThe Board follows the same process for the CEO's LTIP award based on the Human Resources Committee recommendations.\nAll other executives and directors below the senior executive officer level are eligible to receive LTIP in the form of RSUs. For detailed information on the design features and provisions of the 2023 LTIP vehicles, please see the \"Summary of Long-term Incentive Plans\" section.\n42 |ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC. 2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR\nTable of ContentsPERFORMANCE GRAPH\nThe following graph illustrates the change in value of $100 invested on December 31, 2018 (five years ago) in:\n|\n•\n| |\nClass A Shares (RCI.A);\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nClass B Non-Voting Shares (RCI.B); and\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nStandard & Poor's/Toronto Stock Exchange Composite Total Return Index (S&P/TSX Composite Index).\n|\nThe graph also includes a NEO Total Direct Compensation Index that reflects the change in the sum of the annual Total Direct Compensation for NEOs (salary + short-term incentive awards + long-term incentive awards) as reported in the summary compensation table for the past five years.\nValues are given as at December 31 of each of the years listed. The year-end values of each investment are based on share appreciation, assuming that all dividends are reinvested.\nFor the five-year period, the market price for Rogers shares was below the S&P/TSX Composite Index and below increases in NEO Total Direct Compensation. In 2023, NEO Total Direct Compensation trended lower given one-time nature of NEO compensation impacts adjustments year over year.\nOverall, the Human Resources Committee is confident that the current executive compensation program and associated pay levels for the Company's NEOs are well aligned to the Company's performance over the prior five-year period.\n2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC.| 43\nTable of ContentsSUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE |\nSummary Compensation Table | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Non-Equity Incentive\nPlan Compensation | | | | | | | | | | | |\nName and Principal Position | |\nYear | | | Salary1\n($) | | |\nShare-\nBased\nAwards2\n($) | | |\nOption-\nBased\nAwards3\n($) | | |\nAnnual\nIncentive\nPlan4\n($) | | |\nLong-Term\nIncentive\nPlans\n($) | | |\nPension\nValue5\n($) | | |\nAll Other\nCompensation6\n($) | | |\nTotal\nCompensation\n($) | | | | | | | | | | | |\nTony Staffieri7\nPresident and Chief\nExecutive Officer\n| | |\n2023 | | | |\n1,400,000 | | | |\n- | | | |\n9,000,008 | | | |\n1,400,000 | | | |\n- | | | |\n708,300 | | | |\n467,168 | | | |\n12,975,476 | | | |\n2022\n| | | |\n1,376,538\n| | | |\n3,750,000\n| | | |\n13,000,008\n| | | |\n1,826,666\n| | | |\n-\n| | | |\n10,291,500\n| | | |\n1,270,335\n| | | |\n31,515,047\n| | | |\n2021\n| | | |\n790,000\n| | | |\n1,150,182\n| | | |\n1,150,038\n| | | |\n869,158\n| | | |\n-\n| | | |\n511,500\n| | | |\n104,334\n| | | |\n4,575,212\n| | |\nGlenn Brandt8\nChief Financial Officer\n| | |\n2023 | | | |\n650,000 | | | |\n900,000 | | | |\n900,011 | | | |\n660,920 | | | |\n- | | | |\n226,100 | | | |\n439,325 | | | |\n3,776,356 | | | |\n2022\n| | | |\n613,520\n| | | |\n812,500\n| | | |\n3,312,505\n| | | |\n785,614\n| | | |\n-\n| | | |\n503,700\n| | | |\n47,115\n| | | |\n6,074,954\n| | | |\n2021\n| | | |\n270,608\n| | | |\n275,000\n| | | |\n-\n| | | |\n148,837\n| | | |\n-\n| | | |\n159,000\n| | | |\n37,224\n| | | |\n890,669\n| | |\nPhilip J.

In addition, all NEOs will receive benefits under the Rogers DB SERP or Rogers DC SERP in accordance with their registered pension plan participation.\nDEFINED BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS\nThe DB Plan is a contributory defined benefit pension plan registered under the ITA and the Pension Benefits Standards Act. It was closed to new enrolment on July 1, 2016. Executives who are members of the DB SERP are not required to contribute to it. For each year of credited service, the DB Plan provides members with an annual pension benefit of 2.0% of their annual salary, up to the ITA prescribed maximum. Periodically, Rogers has provided for updates to the career average base year earnings used to determine pensions under the DB Plan. Pensions are payable on an unreduced basis once a member has attained age 55 and 30 years of continuous employment or age 65. Members who terminate before eligibility for early retirement are entitled to a lump sum payment of equivalent value to the accrued pension payable at age 65, or they may choose a deferred pension option.\nThe DB SERP provides additional pension benefits to certain key executives for earnings in excess of the ITA limits prescribed for DB pension plans. For each year of credited service, the DB SERP provides eligible executives with an annual pension benefit of 2.0% of their pre-2015 career average base salary plus 2.0% of their post-2014 pensionable earnings, in excess of the ITA limits, including eligible target bonuses, capped at a combined annual aggregate of $1,250,000. Benefits earned under the DB SERP vest after three years of membership in the DB SERP and are payable on an unreduced basis once a member has reached age 65 or attained age 55 and completed 30 years of continuous employment. Executives who are vested and whose employment ends are entitled to a lump sum payment from the DB SERP of the equivalent value of the accrued pension benefit payable at age 65 or they may defer their benefit in the plan until a later date. If a DB SERP member's employment ends after eligibility for early retirement, they also have the option to receive entitlement in the form of a monthly pension. Any amendments made to the DB Plan, such as career average upgrades, are reflected in the DB SERP. The DB SERP is not funded and benefit payments to former executives are paid directly by Rogers.\n| Defined Benefit Pension Plan | | | | | | | Annual Benefits\nPayable1 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\nName | | Number of\nYears of\nCredited\nService | | |\nAt\nYear End\n($) | | |\nAt\nAge 65\n($) | | |\nOpening Present\nValue of Defined\nBenefit\nObligation2\n($) | | |\nCompensatory\nChange3\n($) | | |\nNon-\nCompensatory\nChange4\n($) | | |\nClosing Present\nValue of Defined\nBenefit\nObligation5\n($) | |\nTony Staffieri6 | | |\n19.75\n| | | |\n1,580,000\n| | | |\n2,060,000\n| | | |\n13,599,100\n| | | |\n708,300\n| | | |\n1,937,700\n| | | |\n16,245,100\n| |\nGlenn Brandt\n| | |\n29.92\n| | | |\n132,200\n| | | |\n248,800\n| | | |\n1,295,000\n| | | |\n226,100\n| | | |\n456,200\n| | | |\n1,977,300\n| |\nPhilip.

Commuted values would be based on market interest rates in effect at the date of retirement and may differ significantly from the Accrued Obligation at Year End. The benefits for all NEOs are based on the December 31, 2023 values.\n|\n|\n2 |\nOpening Present Value of Defined Benefit Obligation equals the value of the projected pension earned for service to December 31, 2022. The values have been determined using the same actuarial assumptions and measurement date used for determining the pension plan obligations at December 31, 2022, as disclosed in the notes to the 2022 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, based on the actual earnings for 2022 and adjusted to reflect expected future increases in pensionable earnings.\n|\n2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC.| 53\nTable of Contents| 3 |\nCompensatory Change includes the value of the projected pension earned for service from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023, the change in accrued obligation due to differences between actual and assumed compensation for the year, and the change in accrued obligation due to changes in benefits in the year. The impact of expected future career average upgrades is recognized in the compensatory change over the career of each executive even in years when no such upgrade occurs. The accrued benefit liabilities assume that the Company will resume its historical practice of upgrading the career average earnings base year on a triennial basis. In the future, if the Company deviates from its historical practices, such deviation will be reflected in the compensatory change at that time.\n|\n|\n4 |\nNon-Compensatory Change includes interest on obligations at the beginning of the year, gains and losses due to differences in actual experience compared to actuarial assumptions, and changes in actuarial assumptions.\n|\n|\n5 |\nClosing Present Value of Defined Benefit Obligation equals the value of the projected pension earned for service to December 31, 2023. The values have been determined using the same actuarial assumptions and measurement date used for determining the pension plan obligations at December 31, 2023, as disclosed in the notes to the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, based on the actual earnings for 2023 and adjusted to reflect expected increases in pensionable earnings.\n|\n|\n6 |\nMr. Staffieri's special benefit arrangement (the CEO Defined Benefit Supplementary Retirement plan and promotion award) is reflected in the Opening Present Value of Defined Benefit Obligation and December 31, 2023 Closing Present Value of Defined Benefit Obligation.\n|\nNEOs who participate in the DB Plan are currently vested in their pension entitlements earned to December 31, 2023. In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the amounts set out above make no allowance for the different tax treatment of the portion of pension not paid from the registered pension plans. All amounts shown above are estimated based on assumptions and represent contractual entitlements that may change over time. The methods and assumptions used to determine estimated amounts will not be identical to the methods and assumptions used by other issuers and, as a result, the figures may not be directly comparable across issuers.\nDEFINED CONTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS\nEffective July 1, 2016, the Company introduced the DC Plan for new employees and existing employees who were not enrolled in the DB Plan. Employees joining this plan may contribute between 1% and 8% of their earnings and receive a matching contribution from the Company of up to 6%. Benefits in the DC Plan vest immediately. Normal retirement age for employees in the DC Plan is age 65, but employees may choose to retire at any time after reaching age 55. Certain executives hired after June 30, 2016 will join the DC Plan on a non-contributory basis, receiving a 14% employer contribution up to the annual ITA maximum, if they are eligible for the DC SERP. The DC SERP provides a 14% employer contribution on base salary earned above the maximum money purchase limit under the ITA, plus 14% of the lesser of a) the actual bonus amount and b) the annual target bonus amount, capped at a combined annual aggregate of $1,250,000. The DC SERP is not funded and benefits are accrued on a notional basis. An executive's notional account is vested three years after joining the DC SERP. Executives whose employment ends within three years of joining the DC SERP will not receive any benefit under the DC SERP. Notional interest is credited and is determined based on the investment decisions made by the executive.\n| |\nDefined Contribution Pension Plan | | |\nName | | Accumulated Value\nat Start of Year1\n($) | | |\nCompensatory2\n($) | | |\nAccumulated Value\nat Year End1\n($) | |\nMahes Wickramasinghe\n| | |\n86,100\n| | | |\n178,800\n| | | |\n281,800\n| |\n|\n1 |\nAccumulated Value at Start of Year and Accumulated Value at Year End represents the account balances at the beginning and/or end of the 2023 year, respectively.\n|\n|\n2 |\nCompensatory changes includes accrued contributions to the registered pension plan and accrued notional contributions to the DC SERP plan.\n|\n54 |ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC. 2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR\nTable of ContentsTERMINATION AND CHANGE OF CONTROL BENEFITS\nPOTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION, RESIGNATION, RETIREMENT OR CHANGE OF CONTROL\nThe following table shows potential payments to each NEO who was active as at December 31, 2023, as if the officer's employment had been terminated with or without cause and/or if the officer had retired or resigned as at December 31, 2023.

In 2020, the Corporate Governance Committee conducted an external assessment of the directors' compensation program. This assessment compared the compensation of the members of the Board against prevailing market conditions and included feedback from Meridian Compensation Partners. The compensation program described below was approved by the Corporate Governance Committee and came into effect in the first quarter of 2020.\nThe compensation of directors is designed to:\n|\n•\n| |\nattract and retain qualified individuals to serve on the Board;\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nalign the interests of the directors with the interests of the Company's shareholders; and\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nprovide competitive compensation in line with the risks and responsibilities inherent to the role of director.\n|\nAs described below, the components of our director compensation program are:\n|\n•\n| |\nan additional annual retainer if the director serves as Lead Director, a Committee Chair, or a Committee member; and\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nan annual grant of equity through the issuance of DSUs (or RSUs, if the Directors' RSU Plan is approved by shareholders at the meeting) and/or through the purchase of Class B Non-Voting Shares.\n|\nDirectors have historically been able to choose to receive their retainer and/or fees in DSUs or through the purchase of Class B Non-Voting Shares. If the Directors' RSU Plan is approved by shareholders at the meeting, directors will instead have the option of receiving their retainer in RSUs.\nThe Directors' RSU Plan, if approved by shareholders at the meeting, is expected to replace the Directors' DSU Plan as the principal equity compensation plan for directors. For further information see \"Directors' Restricted Share Unit Plan\".\nRETAINERS AND FEES\nAnnual Retainers\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, non-employee members of the Board received director retainers in accordance with the following standard arrangements:\n| Type of Retainer | |\nAmount\n($) | |\nBoard Annual Retainer\n| | |\n110,000\n| |\nLead Director Annual Retainer\n| | |\n40,000\n| |\nAudit and Risk Committee Chair Annual Retainer\n| | |\n30,000\n| |\nHuman Resources Committee Chair Annual Retainer\n| | |\n30,000\n| |\nOther Committee Chair Annual Retainer\n| | |\n15,000\n| |\nCommittee Member Annual Retainer\n| | |\n5,500\n| |\n2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC.| 57\nTable of ContentsEquity Grants to Directors\nIn addition to the retainers noted above, in 2023, each non-employee director (other than the Lead Director, the Chair, the Vice Chair, and the Deputy Chair) received a grant of equity in the amount of $120,000 through the issuance of DSUs and/or through the purchase of Class B Non-Voting Shares, at the director's election. The Lead Director received DSUs in the amount of $160,000. The Chair received Class B Non-Voting Shares in the amount of $500,000 and the Deputy Chair received Class B Non-Voting Shares in the amount of $250,000. The number of DSUs is based on the share price at the time of the grant. The market price of the Class B Non-Voting Shares for calculating DSUs granted and credited as dividends, and the redemption price, is the weighted average trading price of the Class B Non-Voting Shares on the TSX for the five trading days before the relevant date.\nIn 2023, the Company made a special one-time DSU award to certain independent directors recommended by the Corporate Governance Committee in recognition of (i) the extraordinary levels of workload and commitment required from, and discharged by, them in connection with the Shaw Transaction and (ii) the successful oversight of the Company's swift return to operational and financial leadership in the Canadian telecom industry.\nWe introduced the Directors' DSU Plan effective January 1, 2000 to encourage directors to align their interests with shareholders. Each DSU has a value equal to the market price of a Class B Non-Voting Share at the end of the relevant fiscal quarter. A director's DSUs may be redeemed only when the director ceases to be a director. At the time of redemption, the director is entitled to receive a lump-sum cash payment equal to the number of DSUs credited to the director's account multiplied by the market price of the Class B Non-Voting Shares. DSUs accrue dividends in the form of additional DSUs at the same rate as dividends on Class B Non-Voting Shares.\nIn 2017, the Directors' DSU Plan was amended and restated to allow non-employee directors to choose to receive any or all of their retainers and fees in DSUs or through a purchase of Class B Non-Voting Shares.\nIn addition to the retainers and fees discussed above, we reimburse directors for travel and other expenses when they attend meetings or conduct our business. Other than certain former employee directors, our non-employee directors are not entitled to a pension, other retirement benefits, or non-equity incentive plan compensation.\nSHARE OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS\nThe share ownership requirements for directors are designed to link the interests of directors to those of our shareholders by encouraging directors to hold an ownership position in the Company's shares. As of the date of this circular, each non-employee director is required to own six times their annual cash retainer in any combination of Class A Shares, Class B Non-Voting Shares, and DSUs during their term of service as director of the Company. Directors have five years from the date of initial election to the Board to attain the required ownership level. See \"The Proposed Nominees\" above for information on each director's current share ownership.\nAs described above under \"Directors' Restricted Share Unit Plan\", the Company expects to amend the foregoing requirements if the Directors' RSU Plan is approved at the meeting.\n58 |ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC. 2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR\nTable of ContentsDIRECTOR SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE\nThe following table shows the compensation received by each director for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The Board believes that these Corporate Governance Practices enhance the interests of our security holders, employees, customers, and others dealing with us. These Corporate Governance Practices conform in all substantial aspects with applicable corporate governance guidelines and standards and take into account the following:\n| | Source | |\nReason for Conforming | |\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (U.S.)\n| |\nWe are a foreign private issuer in the U.S.\n| |\nNew York Stock Exchange (the NYSE)\n| |\nWe have shares listed on the NYSE\n| |\nTSX\n| |\nWe have shares listed on the TSX\n| |\nCanadian Securities Administrators\n| |\nWe are a reporting issuer in various jurisdictions in Canada\n|\nThe Board closely monitors these and other corporate governance developments and is committed to enhancing our Corporate Governance Practices on a continuing basis. Our Corporate Governance Practices, summarized below, respond to the disclosure required by National Instrument 58-101 - \"Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices\" (NI 58-101) and the guidelines set forth in National Policy 58-201 - \"Corporate Governance Guidelines\" (NP 58-201). This Statement of Corporate Governance Practices was prepared by the Corporate Governance Committee and approved by the Board.\nControlled Company Exemption\nThe NYSE listing standards require a listed company to have, among other things, a nominating committee consisting entirely of independent directors. The rules permit a \"controlled company\" to be exempt from these requirements. A \"controlled company\" is a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group, or another company. The Board has determined that it is appropriate for directors affiliated with the controlling shareholder to serve on the Board committees, apart from the Audit and Risk Committee, because of the alignment of interests between our controlling shareholder and our minority shareholders, namely the creation of value and long-term growth. Accordingly, the Board has approved the Company's reliance on the controlled company exemption with regards to membership of the nominating committee.\nForeign Private Issuer Status\nUnder the NYSE listing standards, a \"foreign private issuer\", such as the Company, is not required to comply with most of the NYSE corporate governance listing standards. However, foreign private issuers are required to disclose any significant ways in which their corporate governance practices differ from those followed by U.S. companies under NYSE listing standards.\nAppointment of Auditor\nThe NYSE listing standards and U.S. securities laws require the audit committee of a U.S. company be directly responsible for the appointment of any registered accounting firm engaged for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or performing other audit review or attest services. There is an exception for foreign private issuers that are required under a home country law to have auditors selected pursuant to home country standards. Pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia), our auditor is to be appointed by the shareholders at the annual general meeting of the Company. Our Audit and Risk\n64 |ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC. 2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR\nTable of Contents\nCommittee is responsible for evaluating the auditor and advising the Board of its recommendation regarding the appointment of the auditor.\nShareholder Approval of Equity Compensation Plans\nThe NYSE listing standards require shareholder approval of all equity compensation plans and material revisions to such plans, subject to limited exemptions. The definition of \"equity compensation plan\" covers plans that provide for the delivery of newly issued or treasury securities. The TSX rules provide that only the creation of, or material amendments to, equity compensation plans that provide for new issuances of securities are subject to shareholder approval in certain circumstances. We follow the TSX rules with respect to the requirements for shareholder approval of equity compensation plans and material revisions to such plans.\nBOARD COMPOSITION\nThe Board currently has eleven members. If all of the proposed nominees are elected to the Board, the Board will have fourteen members,with ten being independent. The Board is responsible for determining whether a director is \"independent\" within the meaning of NI 58-101.\nOn April 3, 2023, the Company acquired all of Shaw's issued and outstanding Class A Participating Shares and Class B Non-Voting Participating Shares (the Shaw Transaction). In connection with the Shaw Transaction, the Company agreed with the Shaw Family Living Trust (SFLT), the former controlling shareholder of Shaw, that, for so long as SFLT and related persons (the Shaw Family Shareholders) beneficially own, or exercise control over, directly or indirectly, at least 12,000,000 Class B Non-Voting Shares (subject to appropriate adjustments for stock splits, consolidations and other reorganizations involving the Class B Non-Voting Shares), SFLT shall be entitled to designate for election or appointment to the Board (i) Bradley S. Shaw (provided that he is eligible to serve as a member of the Board under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) thereby being an \"Eligible Person\") and (ii) one other Eligible Person that is reasonably acceptable to the Board and qualifies as \"independent\" under securities laws, stock exchange rules and other applicable laws (unless the Company otherwise agrees). If Bradley S. Shaw is unable or unwilling to serve as a director at a time when SFLT would otherwise be entitled to nominate two nominees, then SFLT shall thereafter only be entitled to nominate one nominee. For so long as SFLT beneficially owns, or exercises control over, directly or indirectly, less than 12,000,000 Class B Non-Voting Shares but at least 4,000,000 Class B Non-Voting Shares (subject to appropriate adjustments for stock splits, consolidations and other reorganizations involving the Class B Non-Voting Shares), SFLT shall be entitled to designate Bradley S. Shaw for election or appointment to the Board (provided that he is an Eligible Person). If Bradley S. Shaw is unable or unwilling to stand for election or appointment as SFLT's only nominee, SFLT shall be entitled to designate an alternative Eligible Person that is reasonably acceptable to the Board and qualifies as \"independent\" under securities laws, stock exchange rules and other applicable laws (unless the Company otherwise agrees) until the earlier of (i) ten years from the date that Bradley S. Shaw ceases to be a director of the Company, and (ii) the date that SFLT ceases to beneficially own, or exercise control over, directly or indirectly, at least 4,000,000 Class B Non-Voting Shares (subject to appropriate adjustments for stock splits, consolidations and other reorganizations involving the Class B Non-Voting Shares). The Rogers Control Trust (the controlling shareholder of the Company) has agreed to vote all of the Class A Shares of the Company of which it is the registered or beneficial owner, or over which it directly or indirectly exercises control, in favour of each nominee of SFLT that is nominated for election or appointment to the Board. SFLT has nominated Bradley S. Shaw and Trevor English as its two nominees for this year's meeting.\nCertain directors may be principals of, partners in, or hold other positions with entities that provide legal, financial, or other services to the Company. The Board has adopted discretionary\n2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC.| 65\nTable of Contents\nDirector Material Relationship Standards for the purpose of assisting the Board in determining whether a direct or indirect business, commercial, industrial, banking, consulting, professional, charitable, or service relationship that a director may have with the Company or its subsidiaries is a material relationship that could, in the view of the Board, reasonably interfere with the exercise of the director's independent judgment. These standards can be reviewed in the Corporate Governance section of the Company's website at investors.rogers.com/corporate-governance.\nIt is the policy of the Board that there is a separation of the offices of the Chair of the Board and the CEO. The Chair and CEO are in regular communication during the course of the year, including with respect to the Company's business and the responsibilities of the Board.\nMr. Rogers, Chair, is not an independent director. Pursuant to the Board Mandate, the Board has appointed Mr. Gemmell, an independent director, as Lead Director. The Lead Director facilitates the functioning of the Board independently of management of the Company and provides independent leadership to the Board. For further information regarding the role and responsibilities of the Lead Director, see \"Role and Responsibilities of the Lead Director\" in the Board Mandate (attached to this circular as Appendix B).\nThe following table shows those directors of the Board who are independent and those who are non-independent within the meaning of NI 58-101, and the reason for non-independence of individual directors.\n| |\nDirector | |\nIndependent | |\nNon-independent | |\nReason for non-independence |\nMichael J.

The Corporate Governance Committee typically also reviews the effectiveness of the Board on an annual basis.\nThe Board has eight permanent (or standing) committees. The Board may appoint special committees to deal with specific matters. A special committee might, for example, consider proposed material transactions between us and our controlling shareholder (or corporations controlled by our controlling shareholder) or between us and our subsidiaries. In those cases, the committee would consist entirely of independent directors who have no relationship to us or to our controlling shareholder other than as a director. The mandates for the eight standing committees of the Board are attached to this circular as Appendix C.\n66 |ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC. 2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows the eight standing committees of the Board and the current directors acting as chair or members of the committees.\n| Director | |\nAudit\nand Risk | |\nCorporate\nGovernance | |\nESG | |\nExecutive | |\nFinance | |\nHuman\nResources | |\nNominating | |\nPension | |\nMichael J.

This requires the Board to oversee the conduct of the business and affairs of the Company. The Board discharges some of its responsibilities directly and discharges others through committees of the Board. The Board is not responsible for the day-to-day management and operation of the Company's business, as this responsibility has been delegated to management. The Board is, however, responsible for supervising management in carrying out this responsibility. The complete Board Mandate, including roles and responsibilities for directors, including the Chair of the Board, is attached to this circular as Appendix B.\nDuring 2023, the independent directors met at in camera sessions during every regularly scheduled Board meeting without management or non-independent directors. In camera sessions for the independent directors will be included in the agendas for director meetings in 2024. For information on director attendance at Board and committee meetings in 2023, see \"The Proposed Nominees\" under \"Election of Directors\".\nCODE OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT POLICY\nThe Board has adopted the (i) Directors Code of Conduct and Ethics, and (ii) Business Conduct Policy for directors, officers and employees, which together we refer to as the \"Codes\". The Codes require our directors, officers, and employees to disclose any material transaction or relationship that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest, among other requirements.\nTo ensure the directors exercise independent judgment in considering transactions, agreements, or decisions in respect of which a director has a material interest, the directors follow a practice whereby any such director with a material interest must be absent during any Board discussion pertaining thereto and must not cast a vote on such matter.\nIssues arising in connection with the Codes, including conflicts of interest, are reported to the Audit and Risk Committee (in the case of the Business Conduct Policy) or to the Corporate Governance Committee (in the case of the Directors Code of Conduct and Ethics), each of which are responsible for monitoring compliance with the applicable Code and applying and interpreting the applicable Code in particular situations. The Committees must inform the Board of Code violations.\nProcesses are in place to ensure compliance with the Codes by directors, officers, and employees, such as distribution of the Business Conduct Policy to the Company's employees, and the STAR Hotline, the Company's anonymous whistleblower hotline. For more details, refer to \"Ethical Business Conduct\" in Appendix A to this circular.\nDIRECTOR ORIENTATION AND CONTINUING EDUCATION\nIt is the responsibility of the Corporate Governance Committee to provide an orientation and continuing education program for the directors.\nNewly-appointed directors attend orientation sessions that are intended to familiarize them with our business and operations, including management structure, strategic plans, finances, opportunities, and risks. New directors have the opportunity to meet with management and other members of the Board. New directors are also provided with a package of detailed information concerning our affairs, including public filings.\nAll of the directors are members of the Institute of Corporate Directors, which offers director education programs and provides access to publications to enhance knowledge concerning governance and director responsibilities.\n2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC.| 69\nTable of Contents\nAs part of the Board's continuing education, presentations are made by management personnel or outside experts to educate the directors on new issues and developments in legal, regulatory, and industry initiatives from time to time.\nThe following table sets out certain educational activities organized in 2023:\n| Topic | |\nParticipants | |\nTiming |\nUpdate on Accounting Policies, Estimates, and\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nTax Update\n| |\nAudit and Risk Committee\n| |\nJanuary\n|\nRisk Management in Compensation Programs\n| |\nHuman Resources Committee\n| |\nJanuary\n|\nInclusion and Diversity Review and Trends\n| |\nHuman Resources Committee\n| |\nApril\n|\nDirector Orientation and Business Unit Update\n| |\nBoard of Directors\n| |\nMay\n|\nInformation and Cyber Security\nEnterprise and Business Unit Risk Management\nUpdate\nInvestor Relations Update\n| |\nAudit and Risk Committee\n| |\nQuarterly\n|\nBoard Oversight of Strategy - Institute of\nCorporate Directors\n| |\nDr. Mohamed Lachemi\n| |\nSeptember\n| |\nEnterprise Risk Management, Business Continuity, and Disaster Recovery\n| |\nAudit and Risk Committee\n| |\nOctober\n| |\nAudit Committee Effectiveness - Institute of Corporate Directors\n| |\nDavid A.

The Nominating Committee maintains an evergreen list of potential candidates for future director vacancies. Potential candidates for the Board are evaluated by the Nominating Committee, having regard to the candidate's background and qualifications to ensure that the candidate's experience and skill are aligned with the Company's needs. Each year the Nominating Committee recommends to the Board the names of individuals to be nominated for election as members of the Board.\nThe Nominating Committee has four members, three of whom are independent. For more information on the Nominating Committee and its responsibilities, please refer to the subsection \"Nomination of Directors\" in Appendix A to this circular. Also refer to Appendix C to this circular for the full mandate of the Nominating Committee.\nThe Company has a strong commitment to diversity. A strong female participation rate is important at all levels of the organization, including the executive officer level and the Board level. The Board has adopted a formal gender diversity policy to re-affirm its commitment to diversity and to ensure that the Board is meeting one of its objectives for strong female representation on the Board. The key provision of this policy is to ensure that the Nominating Committee reviews overall composition of the Board and potential nominees with gender diversity as an important\n70 |ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC. 2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR\nTable of Contents\nconsideration. The Nominating Committee monitors and annually presents to the Board the gender diversity statistics of the Board. The Board does not have a target for representation of women on the Board but the Board believes that the gender diversity policy will ensure that gender diversity is an important consideration in the candidate evaluation and selection process. The Board currently has two female directors and, if all of the proposed nominees for this year are elected, women will represent 21.4% of the Board. The Nominating Committee also takes other aspects of diversity into account in evaluating potential candidates.\nThe Company does not impose term limits on its directors as it takes the view that term limits are an arbitrary mechanism for removing directors, which can result in valuable, experienced directors being forced to leave the Board solely because of length of service. The Nominating Committee annually assesses the strengths and weaknesses of the Board. In these reviews, consideration is given to each director's ability to continue to make a meaningful contribution to the Board. This flexible approach allows the Company to consider each director individually, and the Board composition generally, to determine if the appropriate balance is being achieved.\nThe Corporate Governance Committee uses discussions between the Chair of the Committee and Board members and annual evaluations to solicit comment and evaluation from individual directors on the performance and effectiveness of the Board and its committees and recommendations for improvements. The Chair of the Committee discusses with the individual directors the effectiveness and performance of the Board and individual directors' areas of interest and participation. The Chair of the Committee reviews the recommendations and comments of the directors with the Corporate Governance Committee.\nGENDER DIVERSITY IN EXECUTIVE OFFICER POSITIONS\nRogers is committed to gender equality and recognizes the benefits of having a leadership team that is representative of a broad range of perspectives and experiences. In November 2020, the Company rolled out a new five-year Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging Strategy (DEIB Strategy Plan) that includes a focus on supporting the career growth and development of equity-deserving groups (e.g., Women, People of Colour, Indigenous Peoples, Persons with Disabilities, and 2SLBGTQ+). Our plan sets out representation goals in the aggregate and by lines of business for each equity-deserving group.\nGender diversity is one of the considerations of potential candidates for senior executive officer positions. In support of building a strong pipeline of women, our plan includes representation goals at the Vice President and above levels in the aggregate and by line of business. As at December 31, 2023, three of the twelve senior executive officers were women, representing 25% of the senior executive officer positions. Excluding senior executive officers, as at December 31, 2023, 30% of positions at the Vice President and above level (28 of 92) and 39% of positions from Manager to Senior Director levels (1,504 of 3,891) were held by women.\nRISK MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT\nFor a description of risk management oversight, please see \"Risk Management\" on page 63 of our 2023 MD&A.\nAUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE\nThe Audit and Risk Committee is composed entirely of independent directors and meets regularly without management present. Audit and Risk Committee meetings with both internal and external auditors are held on a regular basis and the committee has the authority to engage independent advisors, paid for by the Company, to help make the best possible decisions on the financial reporting, accounting policies and practices, disclosure practices, and internal controls of the Company.\n2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC.| 71\nTable of Contents\nFor further information regarding the Audit and Risk Committee, in compliance with the disclosure requirement of National Instrument 52-110 - \"Audit Committees\", refer to the section entitled \"Audit and Risk Committee\" in the Company's Annual Information Form dated March 5, 2024, which is available on SEDAR+ at sedarplus.ca and on EDGAR at sec.gov.\nOTHER GOOD GOVERNANCE PRACTICES |\n•\n| |\nDirector share ownership requirements (see \"Share Ownership Requirements\" under \"Director Compensation\")\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nCommittee retention of independent advisors\n|\n|\n•\n| |\nBoard approval is required for material commitments\n|\nINTERACTION WITH SHAREHOLDERS\nThe Company remains committed to interacting with its shareholders.

The Audit and Risk Committee has recommended to the Board that KPMG LLP be re-appointed. Representatives of KPMG LLP are expected to attend the meeting virtually or in person, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to questions.\nAudit partners are subject to rotation requirements which limit the number of consecutive years an individual partner may provide service to the Company. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission independence rules governing KPMG LLP require the lead audit engagement partner for a reporting issuer to rotate every five years, and all other audit partners to rotate every seven years. For each mandatory rotation of the lead audit partner, the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee is involved in the selection of the Company's lead audit partner, including interviewing candidates for the role and providing a recommendation to the full Audit and Risk Committee.\nFor the total fees paid to the auditors, refer to \"Appointment of Auditors\" on page 22 of this circular.\nSubmitted on behalf of the Audit and Risk Committee.\nRobert J.

The Committee may require that a minimum portion or percentage of the Director's Quarterly Remuneration for each Eligible Director be paid in equity, in which case such minimum portion or percentage shall be deferred into Restricted Share Units.\n|\n|\n(b)\n|\nMethod of Electing for Director's Quarterly Remuneration. To elect a form or forms of payment of a Director's Quarterly Remuneration, the Eligible Director shall complete and deliver to the Secretary of the Corporation, or other officer of the Corporation designated by the Committee, a written election (such written election, a \"Written Election\"), in the form set out in Schedule A, by no later than the last Business Day of the Fiscal Year immediately preceding the Fiscal Year respecting which any services are performed by the Eligible Director for which the Director's Quarterly Remuneration becomes payable. The Eligible Director's Written Election shall, subject to any minimum amount that may be required by the Committee, designate the portion or percentage of the Director's Quarterly Remuneration for the applicable Fiscal Year that is to be deferred into Restricted Share Units (the \"Elected Portion\") and the portion or percentage to be paid in cash. The Eligible Director's most recently filed Written Election shall continue to apply to all subsequent Director's Quarterly Remuneration payments until the Eligible Director submits another Written Election in accordance with this paragraph. The Written Election in respect of the Director's Quarterly Remuneration in effect as of the last Business Day of any Fiscal Year shall be irrevocable for the subsequent Fiscal Year. If no Written Election is in effect, the Eligible Director shall be deemed to have elected to defer any minimum amount that may be required by the Committee into Restricted Share Units and to receive the\n|\n122 |ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC. 2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR\nTable of Contents |\nbalance of the Director's Quarterly Remuneration for the applicable Fiscal Year in cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an initial election to defer a Director's Quarterly Remuneration into Restricted Share Units may be made within 30 days after the Eligible Director first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan, with such election to apply to the Director's Quarterly Remuneration of the Eligible Director for services to be performed after the election form has been filed.\n|\n|\n(c)\n|\nPayment in Cash. The cash portion or percentage of the Director's Quarterly Remuneration shall be paid in cash in the first month of each subsequent fiscal quarter for which the Director's Quarterly Remuneration is payable.\n|\n|\n(d)\n|\nAdditional Restricted Share Units. In addition to the Elected Portion, in consideration of past services performed by Eligible Directors, the Committee may, in its absolute discretion, award Restricted Share Units to Eligible Directors. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the number of Restricted Share Units granted to each Eligible Director pursuant to this Section 2.1(d) shall be 2,500 Restricted Share Units per Fiscal Year (such grant pursuant to this Section 2.1(d), an \"Annual Entitlement\"). Following the satisfaction by an Eligible Director of any prescribed requirements respecting minimum ownership of Class B Common Shares or share equivalents (as may be established and modified by the Board or the Committee from time to time) and for so long as such minimum requirements are satisfied, an Eligible Director may elect to receive up to 1,500 of their Restricted Share Units (or such other number of Restricted Share Units as determined by the Committee from time to time in its absolute discretion) granted in connection with their Annual Entitlement in cash (which such election shall be conducted via a Written Election, in the applicable form set out in Schedule A). The cash payment to be paid to an Eligible Director in satisfaction of any such Restricted Share Units that are elected to be received in cash shall be (i) calculated by multiplying (A) the number of Restricted Share Units elected to be received in cash, by (B) the Fair Market Value per Class B Common Share as at the Grant Date for the Annual Entitlement, and (ii) paid as soon as practicable following the Grant Date for the Annual Entitlement (less Applicable Withholding Taxes). A Written Election pursuant to this Section 2.1(d) shall be completed and delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation by no later than the last Business Day of the Fiscal Year immediately preceding the Fiscal Year in respect of which any services are performed by the Eligible Director for which the Annual Entitlement becomes payable. The Eligible Director's Written Election shall only apply to the Annual Entitlement for the Fiscal Year in respect of which the Written Election is delivered. The Written Election in respect of the Eligible Director's Annual Entitlement in effect as of the last Business Day of any Fiscal Year shall be irrevocable for the subsequent Fiscal Year. If no such Written Election is in effect, the Eligible Director shall be deemed to have elected to receive all of their Annual Entitlement in Restricted Share Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an initial election to receive a portion of an Annual Entitlement in cash may be made within 30 days after the Eligible Director first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan, with such election to apply to the Eligible Director's Annual Entitlement for services to be performed after the election form has been filed.\n|\n|\n(e)\n|\nReceipt of Restricted Share Units. The Elected Portion as elected by an Eligible Director pursuant to the Plan shall be granted to the Eligible Director and credited to the Eligible Director's Restricted Share Unit Account on the last Business Day of each fiscal quarter for which the Director's Quarterly Remuneration is payable. The number of Restricted Share Units (rounded down to the nearest whole Restricted Share Unit) to be granted shall be determined by dividing the amount of the Director's Quarterly Remuneration to be deferred into Restricted Share Units for the applicable fiscal quarter by the Fair Market Value per Class B Common Share on the Determination\n|\n2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC.| 123\nTable of Contents |\nDate. The Restricted Share Units issuable in connection with an Eligible Director's Annual Entitlement that are not otherwise elected to be paid in cash shall be granted to the Eligible Director and credited to the Eligible Director's Restricted Share Unit Account on the applicable Grant Date.\n|\n|\n(f)\n|\nDividend Equivalents on Restricted Share Units. When dividends are paid on Class B Common Shares prior to the Vesting Date, additional Restricted Share Units will be automatically granted to each Eligible Director and credited to the Eligible Director's Restricted Share Unit Account. Such dividend equivalent Restricted Share Units (rounded down to the nearest whole Restricted Share Unit) shall be computed by dividing: (i) the amount obtained by multiplying the amount of the dividend declared and paid per Class B Common Share by the number of Restricted Share Units recorded in the Eligible Director's Restricted Share Unit Account on the record date for the payment of such dividend, by (ii) the Fair Market Value per Class B Common Share on the dividend payment date. Restricted Share Units granted in accordance with this Section 2.1(f) shall be subject to the same vesting conditions, forfeiture provisions and other terms applicable to the related Restricted Share Units.\n|\n|\n(g)\n|\nVesting of Restricted Share Units. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee or as otherwise contemplated pursuant to the Plan, Restricted Share Units shall vest on the third anniversary of the applicable Grant Date; provided that, if such date falls during or within five Business Days immediately following a Blackout Period, the Vesting Date shall be deemed to be the sixth Business Day immediately following the expiration of such Blackout Period.\n|\n|\n(h)\n|\nBlackout Periods. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, if a Blackout Period is in effect, an Eligible Director may not deliver a Written Election until the first day immediately following the expiration of the Blackout Period; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, a Written Election by an Eligible Director must at all times be delivered by no later than the last day of the Fiscal Year immediately preceding the Fiscal Year with respect to which any services are performed by the Eligible Director for which the Director's Quarterly Remuneration or the Annual Entitlement, as applicable, becomes payable, even if that last day falls within the Blackout Period.\n|\n|\n2.2 | Redemption of Restricted Share Units |\n|\n(a)\n|\nRedemption of Vested Restricted Share Units. Subject to Section 3.17,as soon as practicable after the Vesting Date, the Corporation shall issue to the Eligible Director (or where the Eligible Director has died, their designated beneficiary or their estate, as applicable), without additional consideration, a whole number of Class B Common Shares equal to the whole number of vested Restricted Share Units held by the Eligible Director on the Vesting Date; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such issuance of Class B Common Shares upon redemption of the vested Restricted Share Units held by any U.S. Eligible Director shall occur within 90 days after the Vesting Date. No fractional Class B Common Shares shall be issued. Upon the issuance of the Class B Common Shares, the redeemed Restricted Share Units shall be cancelled.\n|\n|\n(b)\n|\nEffect of Redemption of Restricted Share Units. An Eligible Director shall have no further rights respecting any Restricted Share Unit which has been redeemed.\n|\n|\n(c)\n|\nNo Acceleration or Delay. With respect to U.S. Eligible Directors, notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, the acceleration or delay of the time or schedule of any redemption or payment due under the Plan is prohibited except as provided in Section 409A (including Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)).\n|\n124 |ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC. 2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR\nTable of Contents| 2.3 | Effect of Change of Control |\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, in the event of a Change of Control, the surviving, successor or acquiring entity (or a parent or subsidiary thereof) shall assume any outstanding Restricted Share Units or shall substitute similar share units for the outstanding Restricted Share Units; provided that any such assumption or substitution of outstanding Restricted Share Units held by a U.S. Eligible Director shall be effected in accordance with Section 409A (to the extent applicable). If the surviving, successor or acquiring entity (or a parent or subsidiary thereof) does not assume the outstanding Restricted Share Units or substitute similar share units for the outstanding Restricted Share Units, or if the Board otherwise determines in its discretion, the Corporation shall give written notice to all Eligible Directors advising that the Plan shall be terminated effective immediately prior to the Change of Control and all Restricted Share Units shall be deemed to be vested and, unless otherwise redeemed, forfeited or cancelled prior to the termination of the Plan, shall be redeemed immediately prior to the termination of the Plan; provided that, with respect to U.S. Eligible Directors, such termination of the Plan and any accelerated vesting and/or redemption of Restricted Share Units in connection with such termination shall be effected in accordance with Section 409A (to the extent applicable).\nIn the event of a Change of Control, the Board has the power to: (i) make such other changes to the terms of the Restricted Share Units as it considers fair and appropriate in the circumstances, provided such changes are not adverse to the Eligible Directors; (ii) otherwise modify the terms of the Restricted Share Units to assist the Eligible Directors to tender into a takeover bid or other arrangement leading to a Change of Control, and thereafter; and (iii) terminate, conditionally or otherwise, the Restricted Share Units not redeemed following the successful completion of such Change of Control, in all cases, in compliance with Section 409A, to the extent applicable with respect to U.S. Eligible Directors. If the Change of Control is not completed within the time specified therein (as the same may be extended), the Restricted Share Units which vest pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be returned by the Corporation to the Eligible Director and the original terms applicable to such Restricted Share Units shall be reinstated.\n| 2.4 | Adjustments and Reorganizations |\nIn the event of any stock dividend, stock split, or subdivision, consolidation, reclassification, exchange or other change with respect to the Class B Common Shares, or a merger, spinoff, or other distribution (other than ordinary course cash dividends) of the Corporation's assets to its shareholders, the number of Restricted Share Units in the account of each Eligible Director and the number or kind of shares or other securities reserved for issuance under the Plan shall be adjusted in such manner, if any, as the Board may in its discretion deem appropriate to reflect the event. If the foregoing adjustment shall result in a fractional Restricted Share Unit or share, the fraction shall be disregarded. However, no amount will be paid to, or in respect of, an Eligible Director under the Plan or pursuant to any other arrangement, and no Restricted Share Units will be granted to such Eligible Director to compensate for a downward fluctuation in the price of Class B Common Shares, nor will any other form of benefit be conferred upon, or in respect of, an Eligible Director for such purpose. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, all adjustments made pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be made in compliance with paragraph 7(1.4)(c) of the ITA and/or with Section 409A (including Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)), to the extent applicable.\n| 2.5 | Termination of Service |\n|\n(a)\n| Termination of Service for reasons other thanDeath. If an Eligible Director experiences a Termination Date for any reason other than the Eligible Director's death, then all Restricted Share Units held in the Eligible Director's Restricted Share\n|\n2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC.| 125\nTable of Contents |\nUnit Account on the Eligible Director's Termination Date that are not then vested will vest effective as of the Termination Date and any such vested Restricted Share Units will be redeemed in accordance with Section 2.2(a) (which, for clarity, means that such vested Restricted Share Units held by a U.S. Eligible Director will be redeemed within 90 days after the Termination Date (or, solely to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A, within 90 days after the third anniversary of the applicable Grant Date)); provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the applicable Termination Date occurs during or within five Business Days immediately following a Blackout Period, the Vesting Date for the Restricted Share Units that vest pursuant to this Section 2.5(a) shall be deemed to be the sixth Business Day immediately following the expiration of such Blackout Period.\n|\n|\n(b)\n| Death of Eligible Director. In the event of the death of an Eligible Director, all Restricted Share Units held in the Eligible Director's Restricted Share Unit Account as of the Eligible Director's death that are not then vested shall vest effective as of the date of the Eligible Director's death and will be redeemed to the Eligible Director's legal representative as soon as practicable following the date of the Eligible Director's death (but in any event within 90 days after the date of the Eligible Director's death if such Eligible Director is a U.S. Eligible Director); provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Eligible Director's death occurs during or within five Business Days immediately following a Blackout Period, the Vesting Date for the Restricted Share Units that vest pursuant to this Section 2.5(b) shall be deemed to be the sixth Business Day immediately following the expiration of such Blackout Period.\n|\nARTICLE 3\nGENERAL |\n3.1 | Transferability of Awards |\nRights respecting RestrictedShare Units shall not be transferable or assignable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.\nUnless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Plan shall be unfunded. To the extent any individual holds any rights under the Plan, such rights (unless otherwise determined by the Committee) shall be no greater than the rights of an unsecured general creditor of the Corporation. This Plan is not intended to be, and shall not be, subject to the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.\n| 3.3 | Successors and Assigns |\nThe Plan shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Corporation and an Eligible Director, including without limitation, the estate of such Eligible Director and the legal representative of such estate, or any receiver or trustee in bankruptcy or representative of the Corporation's or Eligible Director's creditors.\n| 3.4 | Amendment, Suspension or Termination of the Plan or Restricted Share Units |\n|\n(a)\n|\nThe Committee may amend or suspend any provision of the Plan or any Restricted Share Unit, or terminate this Plan, at any time, subject to those provisions of applicable\n|\n126 |ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC. 2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR\nTable of Contents |\nlaw and the rules, regulations and policies of the Toronto Stock Exchange, if any, that require the approval of security holders or any governmental or regulatory body regardless of whether any such amendment or suspension is material, fundamental or otherwise, and notwithstanding any rule of common law or equity to the contrary. However, except as expressly set forth herein or as required pursuant to applicable law, no action of the Committee or security holders may materially adversely alter or impair the rights of an Eligible Director under any Restricted Share Unit previously granted to the Eligible Director without the consent of the affected Eligible Director. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee may make the following types of amendments to this Plan or any Restricted Share Units without seeking security holder approval:\n|\n|\n(i)\n|\namendments of a \"housekeeping\" or administrative nature, including any amendment for the purpose of curing any ambiguity, error or omission in this Plan or any Restricted Share Unit or to correct or supplement any provision of this Plan or any Restricted Share Unit that is inconsistent with any other provision of this Plan or any Restricted Share Unit;\n|\n|\n(ii)\n|\namendments necessary to comply with the provisions of applicable law or the rules, regulations and policies of the Toronto Stock Exchange;\n|\n|\n(iii)\n|\namendments necessary for Restricted Share Units to qualify for favourable treatment under applicable tax laws;\n|\n|\n(iv)\n|\namendments to the vesting provisions of this Plan or any Restricted Share Unit;\n|\n|\n(v)\n|\namendments to the termination or early termination provisions of this Plan or any Restricted Share Unit; and\n|\n|\n(vi)\n|\namendments necessary to suspend or terminate this Plan.\n|\n|\n(b)\n|\nSecurity holder approval will be required for the following types of amendments:\n|\n|\n(i)\n|\nany amendment to increase the maximum number of Class B Common Shares issuable under this Plan, other than pursuant to Section 2.4;\n|\n|\n(ii)\n|\nany amendment extending eligibility to participate in the Plan to persons other than Non-CEO Directors;\n|\n|\n(iii)\n|\nany amendment to remove or to exceed the insider participation limit set out in Section 1.7(d);\n|\n|\n(iv)\n|\nany amendment which deletes or reduces the range of amendments which require approval by the security holders of the Corporation under this Section 3.4(b); and\n|\n|\n(v)\n|\namendments required to be approved by security holders under applicable law or the rules, regulations and policies of the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n|\nThe Committee may postpone any redemption of any Restricted Share Unit or the issue of any Class B Common Shares pursuant to this Plan for as long as the Committee in its discretion may deem necessary in order to permit the Corporation to effect or maintain qualification of the Class B Common Shares issuable pursuant thereto under the securities laws of any applicable jurisdiction, or to determine that the Class B Common Shares are exempt from that qualification. The Corporation is not obligated by any provision of this Plan or grant hereunder to sell or issue Class B Common Shares in violation of any applicable law. In addition, if the Class B Common Shares are listed on a stock exchange, the Corporation will have no obligation to issue any Class B Common Shares pursuant to this Plan until such Class B Common Shares have been duly listed.\n2024 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC.| 127\nTable of Contents| 3.6 | Compliance with Section 409A |\n|\n(a)\n|\nRestricted Share Units held by U.S. Eligible Directors are intended to comply with Section 409A or an exemption therefrom, and each provision of the Plan shall be interpreted and construed consistent with such intent.
