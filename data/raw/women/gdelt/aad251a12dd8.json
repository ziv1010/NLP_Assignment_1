It helps the day-to-day work, it helps the recruitment of players and it helps the retainment of our very best players, which we want to do.\n“I think that’s going to be a big, big boost. It’s always nice to see the plans going on in the background. I think when the first digger and the first shovel come, it gives the players a big boost, it just reminds everyone that there’s a big, big future ahead of the next week or the next game and the club’s going in a really positive direction.\n“It’s exciting to hear that the work’s not too far from commencing and we’re looking forward to seeing it in progress.”\nRegarding current works at the stadium, Ashton said: “In the next few weeks two new lounges will open in the West Stand that we’ve been developing underneath the executive boxes and there are multiple projects in the stadium ongoing.\n“A planning application is in for car parking behind the South Stand and ultimately we’re working on the redevelopment of the Cobbold Stand, but as I’ve said time and time again, that’s not imminent. That’s a longer-term project.\n“We have numerous infrastructure projects still to complete, we have the training ground to complete, delivering cat one status for the academy is no mean feat. We’ve got so much going on.”\nITFC\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\nGlad no mention on here about his war cry that's in the east anglian. 100% get behind the boys but at same time if they underperformed especially some of these home games were just been a lack of effort they should know about it. It's the happy clappy clap them off when there rubbish which leads to singing don't worry when we go down. Look at wolves fans giving their boys pelters a\nFew weeks back and look at them now. Sometimes the boys just need a kick up the backside.\nLet’s always at least try to look on the bright side of life !\nStay. Positive, support, believe , have some humour and perspectives!\nCOYB\nRemember it is mainly a building with new facilities not a stadium we are building ffs!! (Not yet)\nCosts of labour and materials etc have go e through roof, I am sure half of you lot still think you grt change from £2 for a pint.\nLike i said its positive, and shows the state training ground has been in but don't sell me a BMW and tell me it's a Ferrari.\nBluewhiteboy suggest you go over there, you will feel at home\nI imagine our costs are less then your comparisons because we already own the land, will be using some of the excisting structures and have already updated the pitches.\nSure the tenders went out long ago but not prudent to admit to that before final permission granted.\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
