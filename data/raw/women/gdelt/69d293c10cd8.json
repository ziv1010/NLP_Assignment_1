The stats have until Sunday night to respond to the NCAA's latest request to deny the requests for the temporary restraining order and injuction.\nThere is still plenty more to come of this entire situation and lawsuit(s), but for now, it appears that the NCAA has quite a mess to deal with. No matter the outcome, good or bad, it will certainly change the way the NCAA and its schools deal with these types of violations and situations going forward.\nRick Pitino Calls NCAA Enforcement Staff \"A Joke\"\nRick Pitino has been coaching college basketball for much of the last four decades. Now in his first year at St. John's, and along with the new age of college athletics, Pitino didn't hold back when it came to the transfer portal and NIL.\n“It’s a very difficult time in college basketball, because it’s free agency,\" the Hall of Fame head coach said following the news about Tennessee and Virginia suing the NCAA. \"And now I think what’s going to happen is, they’re going to say everybody can transfer, and then if they don’t like it, they’re going to take ‘em to court,” the first-year St. John’s coach said Saturday.\n“So, I think the NCAA enforcement staff just should be disbanded. It’s a joke. Not because I dislike them. But, they’re of no value anymore. Because just, Tennessee now will take ‘em to court, Virginia will take ’em to court …”\nPitino does make a very good point. That said, after Pitino left Iona to take the St. John's job last March, the 71-year-old brought in 12 new players, including 10 transfers. But with NIL and the transfer portal taking college athletics by storm over the last couple of years, Pitino believes that change needs (and enforcement of rules) needs to happen sooner rather than later. Then again, it might already be too late.\n\"The enforcement staff needs to go away,\" Pitino said. \"We need to stop all the hypocrisy of NIL. We need to stop it. Because they can't stop it. Whether I'm for it or against it doesn't matter.\n\"They are professional athletes. Get professionally paid. It's not going away. You can't try to get loopholes, because they take you to court. That's why I say -- so I'm not knocking the enforcement staff -- they're going to get taken to court every time they try to make a rule. So it's a tough time in college basketball right now. And for us, you can't really build programs and a culture because everybody leaves.\"\nThere's a reason Pitino believes coaches are leaving for jobs outside of college sports.\n\"I think so many football coaches are getting out, so many basketball coaches are getting out, because of this culture,\" Pitino said. \"It's tough to build a program. You've got to really innovate, get creative and understand these rules right now -- or lack of rules.\"\nUSC's JuJu Watkins Drops 51 Points in a Game\nUSC freshman JuJu Watkins had herself quite a game Friday night. While leading the Trojans to a 67-58 upset win over No. 4 Stanford on the road, Watkins scored 51 points, 11 rebounds, two assists and four steals on 14-of-26 shooting in 31 minutes. That performance made her the only Division I freshman in the past 25 seasons with at least 50 points and 10 rebounds in a game.\nJUJU WATKINS MASTERCLASS. pic.twitter.com/xH5seAFPgc\n— USC Women's Basketball (@USCWBB) February 3, 2024\nShe scored 25 in the first half and then USC's first 15 points out of halftime to take control of the game in the second half.\n\"Every time I scored, all I heard was oooooh,\" Watkins said. \"It wasn't even like a boo. I was like, 'All right.' It was crazy.\"\nThat record-breaking performance came days after Watkins struggled in USC's loss to Washington at home, its third defeat in four games. Following that game, the freshman returned to the gym in order to work on her game. She was there for so long that a security guard called USC head coach Linday Gottlieb to see if Watkins should be forced to leave.\n\"No,\" Gottlieb told the security guard. \"Let Ju be Ju.\"\nThe extra work paid off (and then some).\n\"All week I said, 'This kid is different,'\" Gottlieb said. \"She's special, the way she takes coaching, the way she's a teammate, the way she holds herself accountable, the way she raises her level. So I did not predict this, but I think that what is so special about her is everything inside, and then obviously it came out today in a way that, if you love basketball, I don't know how you're not blown away.\n\"You come in with the best player, and our players battled and did what we needed to do, so I'm most proud of the win and how this team was able to do this tonight. I'll never forget this.\"\nICYMI\nInitial 2024 Ohio State Depth Chart Projection\nWith NFL draft decisions and the first wave of offseason transfer movement complete, Dan Hope takes his first look at how Ohio State’s depth chart could stack up at every position.\nQ&A: Caleb Downs’ High School Coach Says He Watched So Much Film Other Coaches Thought He Had Their Signs and That Downs Will “Never Be Underprepared” on Saturdays\nCaleb Downs' high school coach said the safety watched so much film opposing coaches thought he had their signs and that he'll “never be underprepared” on Saturdays.\nRecord-Low Ohio State Basketball Attendance Continues Falling As Buckeyes Struggle Through Second Half of Season\nAfter Ohio State set a record for its lowest average attendance in Value City Arena last season, the Buckeyes have seen another 13.5% decrease in attendance this year.\nWhat's Next\n- Men's Basketball: vs. Indiana, Tuesday at 7 p.m. (Peacock); vs. Maryland, Saturday at 4 p.m. (FS1)\n- Women's Basketball: at Minnesota, Thursday at 9 p.m. (Peacock)\n- 69 Days: Ohio State's spring game\n- 209 Days: OSU's season opener vs. Akron\n- 300 Days: The Game",
