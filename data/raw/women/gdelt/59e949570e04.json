It was so pristine.”\n—U.S. Army Captain Will Ryan\nIn early 2020, a dig team of around 150 people set up an excavation site in a rice paddy near the Vietnamese village of An Thủy. For Karoni Forrester, it was the culmination of years of waiting for the government to start turning over dirt in its search for her father. But as dig teams come and go, there’s no telling what they’ll find before they need to move on.\nThe Final Flight of Captain Forrester‘s executive producer is Megan Creydt. The show was hosted, reported, and written by Josh Alvarez; written and produced by Patrick Michels; and produced and engineered by Brian Standefer, who also wrote the original score. Additional production by Ella Kopeikin and Aisling Ayers. Story editing by J. K. Nickell, Ross McCammon, and Mark Warren. Fact-checking by Paul Knight. Artwork by Emily Kimbro and Victoria Millner.\nVietnamese translation in this episode was by KaLynh Ngo. Mr. Vu was voiced in English by Tam Duong.\nTranscript\nJosh Alvarez (voice-over): It’s December, and I’m in Vietnam, at a massive war memorial on top of a hill in Quảng Bình Province.\nI’m not alone. With me are three officials from the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including a minder assigned to me by the government. I agreed not to use his real name, so I’ll refer to him as Hue. Hue is in his thirties and wears glasses. He’s courteous, if a bit formal.\nStanding next to me, he points to a red-roofed temple, with an altar bathed in golden light.\nHue: We’re going to go to the altar. To, like, to worship, and then pay tribute to the martyrs. You want to join?\nJosh Alvarez: Sure. Yes.\nHue: Yeah, it is, like, the rule to go here—and then it’s not a rule, it’s the regulation.\nJosh Alvarez: I see, yeah.\nHue: If you stop here, you do that.\nJosh Alvarez: Yes.\nHue: Right. Like paying respect to the people who live here.\nWe enter the temple.\nJosh Alvarez: And then the bust is Ho Chi Minh, or?\nHue: Yeah, yeah, Ho Chi Minh.\nOn the center of the altar, surrounded by decorative urns and vases with flowers, is a golden bust of Ho Chi Minh, the man who’d led North Vietnam during the war, until his death in 1969. The three officials light sticks of incense, bow in front of the altar, and mutter a prayer. The smell of the incense carries through the mountain air.\nI step back out to take in the scenery—a hilly, emerald-green countryside. The view is beautiful, but for Vietnamese people, this is also a place of mourning. The temple is a monument to what happened here during the war.\nThe Long Đại River winds through these hills, east toward the ocean. In the valley below us, the big river narrows a bit. During the war, this is where a pontoon bridge—called the Long Đại ferry—led to a staging area for the roads into South Vietnam, what the U.S. dubbed the “Ho Chi Minh Trail.” The trail was North Vietnam’s key artery for sending men and supplies to the South. And the primary target for enemy bombers. The first American bombs targeting the trail were dropped here, at the Long Đại ferry. The ferry was bombed thousands more times after that. There isn’t an estimate for how many Vietnamese died defending the ferry, but undoubtedly, thousands did. Nonetheless, every time the U.S. destroyed the ferry and its defenses, the Vietnamese rebuilt them quickly. This was a place of strategic importance, but also futility and mass death.\nJust outside the temple, I spot a light gray stone, carved with twelve lines in Vietnamese.\nJosh Alvarez: This looks like a poem.\nHue: Poem. Poem. Yeah, “the parade,” “the night parade through the ferry dock.”\nIt says this poem about “the nighttime parade”—or “march”—across the ferry—is by a “martyr,” a North Vietnamese fighter killed in the war—named Vũ Đình Văn. He wrote this in 1972:\n“That night, under the moonlight,\nWe crossed the Long Đại ferry,\nWhere the enemy’s bomb fragments were thicker than gravel.\n. . .\nIt was a path that brought blood back to the heart.\nAs the ferry crossed through the night,\nI saw the fire calling for the days to come.”\nAt the end of that year, on December 27, Tiny 05 was flying here. I wanted to see the place, not just because of its significance in the war, but to picture what happened here that night.\nThe way the “four horsemen” reconstructed events, Ron Forrester and Jim Chipman flew right over this spot around 8:45 p.m. North Vietnamese gunners would’ve heard Tiny 05 flying under the clouds and launched a barrage into the sky from cannons, machine guns, even rifles. More than 2,400 rounds, over a minute of nonstop firing—a widening constellation of fiery lead.\nTiny 05 made it through, but without dropping its bombs. Jim Chipman kept flying out toward the Gulf of Tonkin, and then came back around. A few minutes later, they were back, approaching the highway south of the ferry. By now, other militia units might’ve known that an enemy jet was in the area. Ron Forrester might’ve had his head down, searching for a target, eyes glued to the glowing radar screen, lining up his shot.\nIt would’ve happened fast.\nAn explosion in the sky. Pieces of wreckage from the plane, and the bodies of two young Marines, rained down onto the earth below.\nForty-seven years later, in January 2020, a team of American archaeologists returned to Quảng Bình to recover the two Marines.\nFrom Texas Monthly, I’m Josh Alvarez, and this is The Final Flight of Captain Forrester. Episode four: “The Dig.”\nThe team was 150 people in all: a contingent from the DPAA, plus American contractors and local residents. The dig site was a large rice paddy a few hundred meters from the village of An Thủy.\nPermission had been arranged with all the necessary Vietnamese offices. The Americans would drain the water and compensate farmers for the rice harvest they’d miss because of the dig. And they were prepared to stay for as long as the Vietnamese would allow, usually around 45 days.\nThey’d barely unpacked when the coronavirus outbreak began, forcing the team to pack their things and go home, with no idea when or even if they could return. Karoni couldn’t have seen it coming, of course—but also, in a way, she might’ve known. After decades of obstacles coming between her and her father, here was yet another.\nAlready, she hadn’t been sure what to expect from the dig.\nKaroni Forrester: So, I mean, I was pleasantly surprised. I mean, I’d written lots of love notes saying, “Please go dig it.”\nShe wasn’t convinced the government had quite the right spot.\nKaroni Forrester: Well, I figured at this point, though, they got to dig that before they’re going to dig somewhere else. They’re not even bothering to look just over there where we told ’em to go look.\nAfter a year, the agency decided it was safe to return. In the summer of 2021, the team came back with their tents and their tools. Days began at 6:45, with a 45-minute walk to the site. On the way in, workers passed two posters, one for each of the missing Marines, with their photographs and a few details about them in English and Vietnamese.\nEach morning, the site leader shared a story about Ron Forrester or Jim Chipman, so everyone knew who they were looking for.\nThis is U.S. Army Captain Will Ryan, who gave those talks:\nWill Ryan: So service members, really, on the team, relate to a father leaving his family to make a difference in a cause he believed in. And I was kind of leaving my son about the same time Karoni was when Ron left her, essentially.\nHe told the team little things that Don had shared about his brother—\nWill Ryan: Like, everyone could relate to a kid that went up on the roof and almost jumped off with a homemade parachute.\n—or that Ron had written in letters home.\nWill Ryan: Talking about being an escort at the Bob Hope show, and talking about the Dallas football game. And, you know, we all like sports; we all like, you know, being a wild kid growing up, and being adventurous. And then moving into his military career and really thinking, you know, like, he’s going to make a difference, and he knew he was in the right place.\nJanet Finlayson: So that kind of kept us moving throughout the entire mission.\nDr. Janet Finlayson is a forensic anthropologist who also worked the An Thủy site.\nJanet Finlayson: It kind of kept the team motivated the entire time, you know, while we’re doing the same thing every day out there.\nThey’d start the work by damming off a section of the rice paddy and pumping water out. When it rained, it was a constant fight to keep the work area from filling back in.\nJanet Finlayson: And when you’re out there on a mission, it’s just kind of the same thing every day out there for the team. Something that we like to call Groundhog Day. You’re pumping the water out of the dams, you’re wet screening all day.\nIn the summer, the muddy surface dried and cracked in the sun. Wet mud turned as hard and heavy as cement. Workers split their shovels trying to break the ground and wriggle out a block of earth. They’d soak the block in water and sift through the mud, feeling for whatever little pieces didn’t melt away, and then go rinse them off to see what they’d found. A rice root, a pebble, or something else.\nThey had a small ritual for the end of each workday: The team gathered up and shouted, “One, two, three . . . Chipman and Forrester.” Then they’d hit their bunks before another long day.\nAfter a few weeks, they had found a few airplane parts, but nothing definitely from an A-6. Then the time ran out on their permit and they had to pack their things.\nA new team arrived and found some landing gear. And this time, they could tell it came from an A-6. But by the end of the season, that was about all they had found.\nThe team felt like they were closer than ever. This had to be the place. But by now, investigators had been here several times over the course of three decades. They’d likely spent millions of dollars here. And there were other missing Americans on the DPAA’s list. How many more return trips could the DPAA justify? How could they be sure the rice paddy still held any more clues?\nKaroni Forrester: Even after that first excavation, I had no level of confidence that they were digging in the right spot.\nKaroni saw all the wreckage the dig teams were turning up, but she also knew, from Lou’s analysis, that there was a crater here even before her dad went missing.\nKaroni Forrester: And we’d been at war over there for quite some time. So could that have been somebody else’s crash site? And it’s great news. I think someone’s coming home, that is a win. I just didn’t know if it was one of our guys.\nYears ago, in the thick of her work with the League, Karoni visited Southeast Asia with a delegation of MIA families.\nKaroni Forrester: Vietnam could have been Mars to me when I was growing up. It was such a distant land. And then to be looking out the window, and I couldn’t really—oddly enough, Karoni couldn’t talk. I was struck with some silence. [laughs]\nShe and a few other women from the League visited crash sites and talked with Vietnamese officials about recovery missions.\nI wondered what it was like for her to show up asking for help, as the daughter of a man who’d been part of massive bombing campaigns against the North.\nJosh Alvarez: You know, I’m thinking about him in the context of this broader war. From the Vietnamese perspective, it was like, “This was the worst for us.” That particular time—\nKaroni Forrester: “Air pirates” is what they called them in their documentation.\nJosh Alvarez: And it’s true for these people that were there and lived this, of, just, one family was gone, the next family, like that. So I don’t know if that was something that during your visit, you were exposed to that perspective, and if that made you think.\nKaroni Forrester: Well, I guess I’d been exposed to the perspective because I’d seen the documents, right, where I knew he was listed as an “air pirate.” Because they’ve got something with Dad’s name on it. I also didn’t feel like people were looking at me like I was a criminal or a criminal’s kid, per se, either. I just, I was aware that they knew whose kid I was.\nI wondered, too, about her feelings towards the people responsible for her father’s death. And whether her visit stirred up a new sense of anger. But she said no.\nKaroni Forrester: Because when it comes down to it, we’re all humans. And while we’re on different sides of this war here, the cost of war is still human life.\nAt one point on her trip to Vietnam, Karoni went to a dig site in Quảng Bình. She knew how close she was to An Thủy. But she didn’t go.\nKaroni Forrester: I wasn’t there to ask about Daddy. I was there to represent all families, and let those foreign governments know this issue matters and the families are going to keep coming back with questions. So when we were meeting with the government, it was very important that we weren’t bringing up our case.\nThat’s still the closest Karoni has come to the dig site for her father. But to tell this story the best I could, last fall, I decided I needed to go.\nSo one morning on my trip last December, I hired a driver and crammed myself into the back row of a SUV. Along with me were my Vietnamese minder, Hue, and two foreign-ministry officials who work on MIA affairs. One, a very young man, who didn’t speak the whole time. With him was his boss, a chain-smoking, stylishly dressed man named Nguyen Thanh Nam.\nWhile I had a Vietnamese official stuck with me on a long drive, I figured I’d ask Nguyen some questions.\nJosh Alvarez: And so why does Vietnam help the U.S. search for missing Americans?\nHue: Anh ấy muốn hỏi vì sao Việt Nam lại hỗ trợ Mỹ tìm kiếm những lính Mỹ mất tích trong chiến tranh Việt Nam? [Translation: He wanted to know why Vietnam supported the U.S. in searching for missing American soldiers from the Vietnam War.]\nNguyen: À, câu hỏi rất là hay. Đây là vấn đề nhân. Sau chiến tranh thì chính phủ 2 nước đã có sự phối hợp, ký kết thoả thuận thực hiện dưới góc độ nhân đạo, giải quyết các vấn đề sau chiến tranh. Chính phủ Việt Nam và Hoa Kỳ đã có thỏa thuận hỗ trợ tìm kiếm người mất. [Translation: That’s a very good question. This is a humanitarian issue. After the war, the governments of both countries worked together to sign an agreement aimed at addressing postwar humanitarian concerns. Vietnam and the United States have an agreement to support the search for missing persons.]\nHue: So the reason is humanitarian. And after the war ended, the two governments had signed the peace agreement, and in that agreement, we agreed that we’re helping each other to find the martyrs and the remains of the soldiers of both countries.\nNguyen said it dates back to the end of the war—when both governments agreed to help one another recover service members’ remains.\nNguyen: Chính quyền địa phương và người dân hoàn toàn ủng hộ việc này. Chỉ trừ một số trường hợp, vì người cũ, người ta có suy nghĩ không tốt đẹp, vì chiến tranh Việt Nam, nhưng ít lắm. [Translation: The local government and the community are fully supportive of our efforts. There are only a few cases where this support is lacking, primarily due to negative attitudes held by some previous individuals who are affected by their experiences during the Vietnam War.]\nNguyen did say that at the local level, there are some older folks who are less supportive because of what they went through during the war. But he said it’s also those people—who survived the war—who are often the key to finding the remains.\nNguyen: Thứ nhất là dịch chuyển của vỏ trái đất. Thứ hai là nhân chứng. Các nhân chứng lớn tuổi, già hoặc chết hết rồi. Rất khó. Những nhân chứng này khi họ chết đi thì khi Mỹ tìm kiếm, chỉ xác định được tọa độ của máy bay rơi thôi. Khi máy bay rơi thì có một số người chết tại địa điểm đó, một số người bị văng ra chỗ khác. Đó là sự khó khăn. Cho nên khu vực để tìm kiếm phải mở rộng. [Translation: The second challenge is related to the witnesses, who are often elderly or deceased. This presents significant difficulties. When witnesses pass away, the authorities can only determine the coordinates of the crash site. When a plane crashes, some victims may die at the crash location while others may be thrown to different areas. This complicates the search efforts, necessitating an expansion of the search area.]\nNguyen said eyewitnesses are getting old or dying. And without them, even if authorities can figure out where a plane went down, they still might not know where to find remains of the crew.\nHue: And to search for that, they need to search through the local people. But actually, the people that live in that area, they’re getting too old.\nJosh Alvarez: In other words, time is running out to really be able to get good information—because again, the young people maybe have heard, but maybe not.\nHue: Yeah, the clue is from local people, and they are getting old, and we are running out of time.\nAn Thủy is a small village with narrow, paved roads. One- and two-story homes and businesses are crammed next to each other. A small canal winds through the village, carrying water to the rice paddies nearby.\nWe arrived at a house and entered through a small courtyard. Two large doors were already open. Inside was a sitting room with a low table and six ornate wooden chairs. Tea had been set out for us.\nThe Vietnamese government had arranged this meeting for me. I wasn’t sure what to expect.\nAfter a couple minutes, our host entered through another door. His name was Phan Thanh Vu. He was a slim man with white hair brushed into a comb-over, and he was wearing an old military uniform that was neatly creased. He was beaming with pride, and as he sat down, he made sure to pat his coat and pants flat.\nJosh Alvarez: And thank you. Very, very nice. Are we in his home right now? Oh—\nHue: Wonderful. He’s in his house.\nJosh Alvarez: And there’s photos. Is this his son, or, uh, yeah?\nHue: Nhà báo hỏi có phải con trai và vợ bác không. [Translation: The journalist asked if they are your wife and son?]\nVu: Đây là con trai tôi và vợ tôi, cùng đơn vị. [Translation: Yes, they are. My wife was in the same unit as I was.]\nHue: His wife also only served in the military. Okay.\nOver the years, he’s held a few official positions around An Thủy. But I was here to ask about a time well before that.\nYou’ll hear an actor translating for Vu.\nJosh Alvarez: Okay, so, I’ll start with what—when did he serve, and what was his role during the war?\nHue: Gia nhập Quân đội Việt Nam từ năm nào? Vai trò gì trong quân đội. [Translation: When did you join the Vietnamese Army? What was your role in the army?]\nVu: Tôi gia nhập tháng 1 năm 1973. [Translation: I joined in January 1973.]\nVu (voice actor): I joined in 1973. I was nineteen.\nJosh Alvarez (voice-over): Vu told me he was born in An Thủy. He was the second of nine siblings. He got involved with the resistance, and then the Army, alongside his friends.\nVu: Năm 17 tôi cũng đã làm cán bộ nhỏ, sau đó làm bí thư chi đoàn. Ở nhà mình cũng tham gia lực lượng dân quân địa phương. Lúc đó là thời chiến rồi. Là thanh niên mình cũng hăng hái, tham gia theo chủ trương cứu nước. Lúc đó mình trẻ tuổi. [Translation: At seventeen, I was already a junior officer, then became the secretary of the youth union. At home, I also participated in the local militia. It was wartime then. As a young person, I was enthusiastic and joined the national salvation movement. I was young at that time.]\nVu: Lúc đó mình 18 tuổi thì cũng chỉ làm những việc như vận tải lương thực. [Translation: At eighteen, I mainly did tasks like transporting food.]\nVu (voice actor): I’d become a junior officer at seventeen. I was in the local militia, mainly helping with things like transporting food. It was wartime. As a young person, I was enthusiastic and joined the national salvation movement.\nJosh Alvarez: So his teenage years, then, were very much during the war. So what was that like for him?\nVu: Chiến tranh phá hoại nó diễn ra cũng khá lâu. Thời điểm đó tôi chứng kiến nhiều lần máy bay Mỹ ném bom ở vùng Le Thuy rất là nhiều. Ở vùng này thì nó ném bom 3 lần tương đối khốc liệt. Nó ném bom theo tọa độ. [Translation: The destructive war lasted quite a long time. At that time, I witnessed many American planes bombing the Le Thuy area a lot. In this area, they bombed three times quite fiercely. They bombed using exact coordination.]\nVu (voice actor): The war lasted a long time. I witnessed many American planes bombing this area, using exact coordination.\nVu: Nhà tôi bị cháy. Lúc đó khoảng 9 giờ. Tôi là người chứng kiến. Người dân họ chạy ra ngoài đồng. Tôi cũng chạy theo ra đồng. Sau đó làm hầm ở ngoài đồng. [Translation: My house was burned. It was around nine o’clock. I witnessed it. The people ran to the fields. I also ran to the fields. Then we made tunnels in the fields.]\nVu (voice actor): My house was burned. It was around nine o’clock. I witnessed it. We ran to the fields and hid in tunnels.\nJosh Alvarez (voice-over): Part of the house collapsed, but it wasn’t destroyed. And his immediate family was safe. But in the war, his aunt in another village was shot dead by a passing plane. Another uncle lost an arm.\nAnd other families in An Thủy weren’t as lucky as his.\nVu: Nhà ông này bị trúng bom chết rất nhiều người, chết cả nhà. Mỹ nó ném bom ghê lắm. Nhà tôi bị cháy. [Translation: This man’s house was hit by a bomb, killing many people, the whole family died. The Americans bombed terribly.]\nVu: Những người đó là dân thường hết, còn đang tuổi thanh niên. [Translation: They were all civilians, still young.]\nVu (voice actor): This man’s house was hit by a bomb, killing many people, the whole family died. They were all civilians, still young.\nVu: Vào một buổi tối khi máy bay rơi trước làng. Súng 57 bắn, máy bay cháy, người dân hoan hô. Những người dân trực chiến họ muốn ra xem có phải thực sự máy bay rơi. Người dân rất mừng nhưng cũng lo vì mảnh đạn văng ra khắp nơi. Có xác 2 phi công. Tôi là người trực tiếp chôn phi công. Có người còn lại chỉ còn cái đầu và cánh tay. Tôi lấy tấm nilong của gia đình. [Translation: One evening, a plane crashed in front of the village. The 57mm gun fired, the plane burned, and the people cheered. The people on duty wanted to see if the plane really crashed. The people were very happy but also worried, because shrapnel was flying everywhere.]\nVu (voice actor): One evening, a plane crashed in front of the village. The 57-millimeter gun fired, the plane burned, and the people cheered. They were very happy, but also worried, because shrapnel was flying everywhere.\nVu: Rơi ban đêm nhưng xác tìm thấy vào sáng hôm sau. [Translation: It crashed at night, but the body was found the next morning.]\nVu (voice actor): It crashed at night, but the body was found the next morning.\nVu: Tôi cùng với mọi người nhặt được hcie61c dù lớn có nhiều dây. Nhiều người nhặ được vật phẩm khác đem về nhà xem nhu chiến lợi phẩm. Sáng hôm sau chúng tôi trở lại phat hiện xác phi công như tôi có kể chỉ còn cái đầu và cánh tay. [Translation: I, along with others, found a large parachute with many ropes. Many people collected other items and brought them home as trophies. The next morning, we returned and discovered the pilot’s body, as I mentioned. Only the head and arm were left.]\nVu (voice actor): I found a large parachute. Many people collected other items and brought them home as trophies. We discovered the pilot’s remains as well. Only the head and arm were left.\nJosh Alvarez (voice-over): I was stunned. I knew I’d be meeting a local veteran. And I was planning on asking about his memories of 1972 and, specifically, about the shootdown. But I wasn’t expecting he’d recall so many details, and ones that lined up with Tiny 05. I immediately asked for more, and I hoped I could determine that the shootdown he witnessed was Tiny 05, and that the bodies he helped recover were Chipman and Forrester’s.\nJosh Alvarez: Wow.\nHue: And it’s exactly the place that we’ve been today. So it may be Forrester.\nJosh Alvarez: Possibly, yeah, that could very possibly be. It sounds very similar. I know he says he can’t quite remember, but is there any chance he remembers anything about that? You know, it was December 1972 was when Forrester was shot down.\nHue: Nhà báo nói là có phi công tên Forrester cùng quê với nhà báo. Máy bay của Forester vào cuối năm 72. BÁc có chắc chắn lúc chôn cất người phi công, bác có biết đó là Forrester. [Translation: The journalist mentioned a pilot named Forrester who was from the same hometown as the journalist. Forester’s plane crashed at the end of 1972. Are you sure that when you buried the pilot, you knew it was Forrester?]\nVu: Tôi chỉ biết là người đàn ông da trắng, trẻ lắm. Tôi thấy cánh tay của họ, không nhớ rõ tay trái hay phải. Tôi dùng túi gói lại xác của họ. Tôi đoán phi công này có thể là 1 trong 2 người phi công. Khuôn mặt trẻ, và trắng, đẹp, tóc cắt ngắn. [Translation: I only knew he was a young white man. He had a young, fair, handsome face, and short hair.]\nVu (voice actor): I only knew he was a young white man. He had a young, fair, handsome face, and short hair.\nJosh Alvarez (voice-over): I found a photo of Ron Forrester on my phone and held it up for Vu.\nJosh Alvarez: That’s Forrester when he was—\nHue: Đây là ảnh Forrester lúc trẻ, khi còn trong quân đội. [Translation: This is a photo of Forrester when he was young, still in the military.\nVu: Tôi không nhớ rõ, quá lâu rồi. Khó phân biệt lắm. [Translation: I don’t remember clearly, it’s been too long. It’s hard to distinguish.]\nHue: He doesn’t remember.\nJosh Alvarez: It’s too long ago.\nVu: Còn 1 cánh tay, tôi nghĩ đứt tay phải. Tôi gói cánh tay lại. Nhớ lại tôi thấy cảm động lắm. Ngay gần đây, cách chỗ rơi máy bay 500 met. Tôi cũng chôn theo kiểu đầu quay về phía núi. Khi chiến tranh kết thúc, họ san bằng khu mộ để làm ruộng. 52 năm rồi, quá lâu. Họ tìm về, đào 2 lần mà không thấy. [Translation: There was one arm left; I think it was the right arm. I wrapped the arm. Remembering it, I feel very emotional. It was very close, about five hundred meters from the crash site. I buried him with his head facing the mountain.\nVu (voice actor): There was one arm left; I think it was the right arm. I wrapped the arm. Remembering it, I feel very emotional. It was very close, about five hundred meters from the crash site.\nVu: Tôi chỉ biết chôn cất đàng hoàng, đúng theo tục lệ người Việt Nam. Lúc đó không có hòm, nhưng tôi dùng túi để gói lại phần thi thể của phi công và chôn cất tử tế. [Translation: I only knew to bury him properly, according to Vietnamese customs. At that time, there was no coffin, but I used a bag to wrap the pilot’s remains and buried him respectfully.]\nVu (voice actor): I tried to bury him properly, according to Vietnamese customs. There was no coffin, but I used a bag to wrap the pilot’s remains and buried him respectfully, with his head facing the mountain.\nVu: Tôi đã cố gắng trong hoàn cảnh cho phép chôn cất người lính Mỹ theo thông tục địa phương. [Translation: I did my best under the circumstances to bury the American soldier according to local customs.]\nVu (voice actor): I did my best under the circumstances.\nVu: Khi chiến tranh kết thúc, họ san bằng khu mộ để làm ruộng. 52 năm rồi, quá lâu. Họ tìm về, đào 2 lần mà không thấy. [Translation: When the war ended, they leveled the grave to make fields. It’s been fifty-two years, too long. They came back, dug twice but couldn’t find it.]\nVu (voice actor): When the war ended, they flattened the grave to make fields. They came back and dug, but couldn’t find it. It’s been 52 years. Too long.\nJosh Alvarez: Everything’s been gone. Right, okay. Yeah. I almost want to believe that it was—yeah, it’s like that little bit of, yeah. It’s kind of amazing, still, that he was involved with the burial. I’m just saying this to myself. Wow.\nVu: Tôi chứng kiến mọi thứ ngay từ đầu. [Translation: I witnessed everything from the beginning.]\nHue: He said that he’s the one who—I think he’s the only one in the village and witnessed everything from the whole beginning.\nJosh Alvarez: Yeah. Wow. No, again, I feel certain that if the family could be here, they would want to meet him too and say thank you.\nVu: Tôi muốn chia sẻ nỗi buồn, đau thương và mất mác đối với gia đình của phi công Forrester. Tôi chỉ là một người lạ. Nhưng tôi hiểu nỗi đau đó. [Translation: I want to share the sorrow, pain, and loss with the family of pilot Forrester. I am just a stranger, but I understand that pain.]\nVu (voice actor): I want to share the sorrow, pain, and loss with the family of pilot Forrester. I am just a stranger, but I understand that pain.\nJosh Alvarez (voice-over): Even if it wasn’t Forrester and Chipman Vu had buried, his story left me conflicted. I felt sad for him, and all the death and destruction he witnessed as a child. And for the two pilots, whoever they were, who died near the village.\nBut it also felt like an affirmation that even after experiencing horrible violence, Vu retained his humanity. He had every reason to hate the men killing his neighbors and to withhold compassion for their families, but he didn’t. Decency. That is what Vu displayed that night as a teenager, and what he demonstrated to me 52 years later.\nBy the fall of 2022, DPAA search teams had established that—at some point—an A6 had crashed outside An Thủy. But there was nothing to prove that the wreck was Tiny 05. And no guarantee that the DPAA could send another team.\nThe four horsemen decided it was time to chase down one last clue: those Vietnamese photographs in the museum, from late 1972, of the wreckage of the seven-hundredth shootdown in Quảng Bình.\nIn the background of one photo was a silhouette of distant mountains with a distinctive saddleback between two peaks.\nHere’s Joseph:\nJoseph Mortati: And so we looked in Google Earth to see where that was. And I want to say it was like six or seven miles west of the village. But the problem is that it’s difficult to assess distance, right, when you have a two-dimensional object.\nJay contacted another research volunteer, who contacted a buddy in Vietnam, who drove out to An Thủy on a scooter, carrying a copy of the old photo. He saw the same mountain range and walked around, holding the old photo up until he found the spot with the same perspective. He snapped a photo. He was standing next to a rice paddy, just yards from where the DPAA had been excavating.\nJoseph Mortati: So what that did was, that determined that the people who were gathering this wreckage and piling it up on this berm were in this particular place. It’s proof positive.\nIf there would ever be anything like an X on the ground, this was it.\nThat October, Jay and the team presented what they’d found to the League and DPAA officials. And the agency announced it would send another team out in 2023.\nIn February, the dig team arrived—the third in as many years. Each day, the site leader would give those talks about the two Marines, to remind the team why they were here.\nThis went on for about a month. And then one day, one member of the team—the team’s medic, actually—realized he’d found something. Janet Finlayson, who you heard earlier, was the lead scientist on this dig.\nJanet Finlayson: Yeah, well, he called me over, and he was like, “I think this is a tooth.” And I come over and look at him and I go, “This is definitely a tooth. It’s definitely a human tooth.”\nJanet almost didn’t believe it.\nJanet Finlayson: We’ve been investigating this case since 1991, and, you know, we’ve investigated the site over a dozen times before then, and excavated the site two times before we were out there. And then all of a sudden, you just find this complete tooth.\nThe find energized the team, and soon they unearthed two more. In April, the three teeth went back to the forensic lab in Honolulu.\nKaroni Forrester: That’s when I knew we were getting some answers. I didn’t know, of course, who the teeth belonged to at the time.\nJanet’s team left. And while they waited for news from the lab, a new team arrived to keep digging. The new site leader was Will Ryan.\nWill Ryan: That was in May-to-June time period. Much hotter. Heat index is about 122 every day. And, you know, it’s kind of brutal on a team, because you are almost having a team out there for ten hours out in the heat without having any AC kind of thing.\nBut they knew the last team had found human remains there. And now, as they screened the dirt, small bone fragments began appearing—a dozen in all, though it wasn’t obvious whether they were human or animal. The bone fragments went to Honolulu for testing.\nA few weeks into the dig—it had rained the day before, so it was incredibly humid—a young Army sergeant and a Vietnamese woman who’d been there for every day of the dig were both sifting through dirt when, between them, a mud brick cracked open and a piece of plastic fell out. The sergeant found her captain and tapped him on the shoulder.\nWill Ryan: And she was kind of shaking, and I was like, “What’s going on?”\nIn her hand was a piece of a credit card from the Humble Oil & Refining Company—off-white, with blue lettering. Its edges were jagged, like a torn piece of paper, and a corner looked like it was charred and melted.\nFifty years ago, gas cards like these were a common kind of credit card. Printed on the back were terms and conditions, including in all caps: “Please notify Humble immediately of loss or theft.” On the front was part of the card number, its expiration date, and the letters, clear as day, “O-R-R-E-S-T-E-R.” The “F” was there, but it was slightly melted.\nWill Ryan: It was shredded, of course—plow blades and stuff like that probably did a toll on it—but you could pretty clearly see his name in there.\nAt the dig site in Quảng Bình, the pace of the work picked up. Their time was running out. On one of their last mornings, a team member started, as usual, by cutting bricks of mud from the paddy. Captain Ryan passed by, and when he picked up the first brick in the row, he noticed something sticking out.\nWill Ryan: So I’m digging around, and you kind of see this cream-colored, you know, plastic sheath, you know? And I squeezed it, because it’s covered in mud.\nCaptain Ryan alerted the site scientist, who’d taken over for Janet. His name is Blake Ayala.\nBlake Ayala: So I just gently washed it with some water in a bucket. And actually, after getting all the dirt out, it kind of just slid right out.\nWill Ryan: And he pulled it out, and he held it in his hand, and he said, “It’s Chipman’s dog tag.” So it looked like it fell off his neck yesterday, you know, just fell out there in the rice paddy, it was so pristine.\nThis was it. Here was the X on the ground. Forrester and Chipman died here—and the dig team found teeth, and bones. Now it was a matter of waiting and hoping for a positive identification.\nKaroni was at the annual MIA family update conference when she heard what they’d found.\nKaroni Forrester: So I was in D.C., and the team had just gotten back from Vietnam the day before. And so I’m asking all kinds of questions about what they brought back. I saw that summary report that they had Jim Chipman’s dog tag. That struck me more than this piece of plastic with my dad’s name on it. But Jim’s dog tag was around his neck. That was the first time I realized they were in the right spot. It was mind-blowing. I decided I needed to step back outside for a second. And I was very happy. There was a feeling of accomplishment. “Wow, we made this happen. And there was something tangible.”\nIn August, the lab returned its first results: The teeth belonged to Jim Chipman.\nChipman’s remains were delivered to his hometown of American Fork, Utah. Waiting to receive him were his widow and his two sons, who were four years old and twenty months old when their father died. I met Jim’s youngest son, Matt Chipman, at his home in Utah.\nMatt Chipman: It was quite emotional for all of us. I think, you know, it brought up some painful memories. But then, also, a lot of gratitude that this had actually happened, and that we can now actually have, like, a real funeral.\nIt was Veterans Day when Jim was buried. A full military detail accompanied his casket, draped in an American flag, on a procession through town.\nMatt Chipman: It was very moving, because, you know, the Marine Corps escort comes, and we met them at the Salt Lake international airport. And they kept everyone on the airplane until that casket comes off the plane. Nobody moves. And the mayor rolled out the red carpet, and they shut down Main Street. Over a thousand people showed up, most of whom didn’t even know him. Just wanted to honor this soldier who’d been found. It was very moving.\nKaroni Forrester was at home in December 2023 when she noticed a missed call from a Marine casualty officer.\nJosh Alvarez: You’re at home, right? This is—\nKaroni Forrester: I’m at home, and Chris was at home, Lilian was at home. It just so turned out, all three of us happened to be home this Tuesday morning, which isn’t that common.\nShe hollered for her husband and daughter to come.\nKaroni Forrester: And we called the casualty officer. I put it on speaker so that he could tell us all together. And he said, “We got a match.” And I’m not sure what my immediate next question was. I just recall us all looking at each other.\nAfter decades of watching other MIA families get the answers they’d been seeking, finally, it was her turn.\nKaroni Forrester: I don’t feel like I’m going to lose it, but I feel like I’m supposed to be losing it. You know what I mean? The brain’s, like, not knowing how to react.\nFor so long, Karoni had been rallying others who could help her find her father—there was only so much she could do herself. But now it was up to her to organize a fitting tribute.\nGate crew member: Mahalo for your patience. At this time, Hawaiian Airlines Flight 81 with service to Honolulu at gate number three will begin general boarding . . .\nKaroni Forrester: How are you this morning?\nJosh Alvarez: I’m doing all right. How are you?\nLast fall, I went with Karoni to Hawaii for a reunion.\nIn a three-story office building on Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam—not too far from the beach—is a forensic anthropology lab operated by the DPAA. This is where scientists began to analyze her father’s remains. Scientists took a small piece of one of the bones, ground it down into a fine powder, dissolved that powder in a liquid, and isolated the DNA. This one piece, out of all the dig team found, had belonged to Ron—likely part of either a hand or a foot. Soon, it would be buried in American soil. But for now, this small piece of him was right here.\nThis was the moment Karoni had been waiting for her whole life. But of course, once she was inside the lab, she wanted to learn all she could to help other MIA families. And to help the scientists understand what families like hers have been through.\nKaroni Forrester: You know, I was a little kid in the seventies. Some of those families were involved then—they have legitimate reasons . . .\nShe was thinking back to those first, confusing reports she’d gotten from the government, and how hard it became to trust what she’d heard back then.\nGreg Berg: Oh, absolutely. I completely agree with you.\nKaroni Forrester: And it is hard to completely step away and shake that. And so, trust-building through science is super cool.\nGreg Berg: That’s what we’re trying to do.\nKaroni Forrester: Well, I’m glad you’re doing . . .\nUntil finally, with the lab machines humming around us, we settled around one door in a hallway.\nGreg Berg: And hopefully we’re getting answers to families faster that way.\nKaroni Forrester: God knows.\nGreg Berg: Are you ready to get your answer yet?\nKaroni Forrester: Yeah. Tell me.\nGreg Berg: Okay. You want to do this?\nKaroni Forrester: Yeah.\nKaroni and her husband, Chris, entered through a heavy door that locked behind them. I waited outside with the DPAA scientists and a few of Karoni’s friends.\nA couple minutes later, she opened the door and welcomed everyone inside. The room was oval-shaped, and it was cantilevered, jutting out a few floors above a courtyard. There were windows with heavy drapes drawn across.\nA large print of Ron’s Marine portrait stood off to one side. At the center of the room was a long conference table, with a cloth lying across it. On the cloth, in a neat row, were what looked like about ten small, jagged stones, each around the size of a thumbnail. I looked closer and could see these were the fragments of bone.\nAll of the work from so many people, sweating and digging, squinting at old photos, and—for Karoni—a lifetime of rallying support and applying pressure, it had taken all of that to get these little bones onto the table before us.\nFor the first time reporting this story, I could not imagine what Karoni was feeling. She picked up one of the bones and rubbed it with her fingers, like a long-lost coin. She held in her hands the truth she’d been fighting to uncover for almost forty years: Captain Ron Forrester, her father, had been found.\nBut he wasn’t home yet, either. One last flight would get him there.\nThat’s coming up, in the last episode of The Final Flight of Captain Forrester.\n- More About:\n- Texas History",
