It's a minimum standard at Arsenal that we need to be in Europe and playing in the Champions League regularly and in the group stage, so it's been nice to get it over the line.\"\nFollowing their qualification, Arsenal are booked to play their upcoming Champions League fixtures under the lights at the Emirates, which Mead is certainly excited about.\n\"Now we get to play some good group stage football at the Emirates,\" she added. \"It's really exciting and hopefully we can get a lot of people to come along.\"\nThe 29-year-old was dealt a devastating blow at the end of 2022 when she suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury. After making her starting XI return last November, she has been going from strength-to-strength.\nConsidering her ACL injury Mead revealed that she feels like she's started the 2024/25 WSL campaign in a \"pretty good place\".\nShe explained: \"I wouldn't say my pre-season was perfect. I picked up a bit of a niggle which was a bit frustrating, but I feel like I'm getting back into my stride now and I can keep building into the season.\"\nFor the first time in history, three English clubs have progressed to the group stage of the tournament, with Arsenal joining Chelsea and Manchester City.\nWSL rivals Chelsea are set to play Real Madrid, Twente and Celtic, whereas City will come up against Barcelona, St Polten and Hammarby.",
