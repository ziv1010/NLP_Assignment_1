  "body_text": "A first half defensive effort kept things interesting heading into the break Wednesday evening, but the Barton Community College women's soccer team ultimately couldn't fend off No. 7 Cowley College, falling 2-0 in Arkansas City.\nThe setback snaps the Cougars' three game winning streak, dropping them to 2-3-0 in conference play and 4-4-0 overall, while the Tigers remain unbeaten at 4-0-1 in league action and 4-0-2 on the season. Barton will look to regroup Saturday, hosting Coffeyville Community College at 3:00 p.m. from Cavannah Field in Great Bend.\nScoreless into the second half, Cowley broke the deadlock less than four minutes after the break as a midfield through ball from Sara Arsee slipped past the Barton backline and was converted by Saki Sanno with a far post finish.\nThe Tigers doubled the margin with 12:57remaining, turning a corner kick into a back post header to seal the 2-0 result.\nBarton managed five total shots with three on goal, highlighted by looks from Sara Aguirre and Maki Kimura. Goalkeeper Leonie Chambe was busy between the pipes, collecting nine saves on 27 Cowley attempts to keep the Cougars within reach much of the night.",
