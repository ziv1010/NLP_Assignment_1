As well as the name, I also like the fact they have an Australian animal in their name.\n\"It was a fantastic experience.\"\nThe pair said they \"lucked out\" when they approached a bloke flipping steaks on the barbecue before the game.\nMrs Underwood said Cameron Buist and Nicole Killen were very welcoming and chaperoned them all afternoon.\n\"We met both club presidents and took lots of photos for my Riverina trip report, which has already gone to Korea Tippers,\" she said.\n\"It was a cold and wet afternoon, but incredibly cozy under the roof with the fires going, we made sure we weren't the last car out of the car park in case we needed a tow in all the mud.\n\"We also visited the towns both clubs are named after and took photos of their signposts.\"\nMr Wilkinson said he didn't believe Mr Buist and Ms Killen went to the game expecting to host visiting strangers from southern Victoria.\n\"They gave us the warmest welcome into the Goannas family,\" he said.\n\"It's a small world, it turns out they are originally from our part of Victoria and know some of my neighbours.\n\"I was impressed by the number of volunteers helping out on the day, I'm involved in several community organisations myself, so I know how much volunteer power it takes to run an event.\"\n\"I'll definitely be back. I want another chance to wear my Goannas beanie.\"\nMrs Underwood said her husband Peter's great-grandparents were pioneer American missionaries to Korea in the 1880s, and he is the last member of his family still living there.\n\"I had known Peter's father since I was a teenager, and he was our matchmaker in 2002,\" she said.\n\"We married in 2004 in the little country church near our family farm in Wangoom, near Warrnambool.\n\"So I moved to Korea for love, we now live between Seoul, Melbourne and Warrnambool.\"\nMrs Underwood is a self-confessed Richmond tragic and knows what it is like to endure hard times, including 37 years between premierships\n\"I flew from Seoul to Melbourne for the 2017 and 2019 grand finals,\" she said.\n\"I had to settle for a ticket to our Punt Road ground to watch the game on a big screen, but I was lucky enough to get a ticket to the players' celebration at Crown Casino that night.\n\"It was the best night of my life, and I was euphoric for the best part of six months afterwards.\n\"Roger and I both saw them win the 2019 flag, but I was locked out of Australia for their 2020 premiership because of COVID, along with so many other Australians.\n\"Those three premierships will satisfy me for a very long time.\"",
