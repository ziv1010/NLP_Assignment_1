  "body_text": "Mississippi communities scarred by ICE raids fear future under Trump\nMorton and nearby towns in central Mississippi saw the biggest workplace ICE raids in the country in 2019, when nearly 700 workers were arrested...\nMORTON, Miss. — When Brandy Freeman is asked about what happened here five years ago, she stops in her tracks.\n\"It was horrible,\" Freeman says, her voice trembling as she tears up. Her eyes lose focus on the items inside the small thrift shop where she's browsing for used furniture. \"It was really horrible,\" she whispers.\nIt's Saturday morning, and people are at home watching the 'Ole Miss' football game. Other than the hum of the Koch Foods poultry processing plant on the other side of the railroad tracks, it's quiet in this small city 30 miles east of Jackson.\nThat wasn't the case on Aug. 7, 2019, when seven poultry plants in central Mississippi, some of the biggest employers in the region, were raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Authorities arrested 680 workers, more than half from plants right here in Morton.\nFreeman's partner wasn't detained that day. But he is in the country illegally working at a chicken plant, so they've talked about the possibility of it happening again– and about what it would mean for their 3-year-old son.\n\"It's a constant worry,\" she says.\nA community on-edge\nAs President-elect Donald Trump gets ready to serve a second term, he and his advisers have said workplace raids will be restarted as part of their promise to carry out the largest deportation operation in history. The Biden administration had stopped workplace raids, although it continued removing immigrants with targeted operations.\nThis promise has left people in the area anxious about the deep impact new workplace raids could have on the community's psyche and the economy.\n\"What will happen if all our people get deported?\" asks Lorena Quiroz, the executive director of the Immigrant Alliance for Justice and Equity, an organization that advocates for immigrant rights in Mississippi. She wonders whether Americans understand the extent to which the slaughtering and packaging of poultry depends on the undocumented workforce.\n\"Who is going to do all of that? Where are you going to find that pool of workers that are willing to work, quickly?\"\nQuiroz says that since the presidential election in November, she has received calls from people worried about potential new workplace raids in the area. \"Our whole focus has been this: preparing, getting ready, making sure that we have resources,\" she emphasizes.\nTrump's team says they'll first go after migrants with criminal records and final orders of deportation. Tom Homan, Trump's incoming border czar, has suggested people who have been ordered to leave the country but don't, become fugitives.\nDuring the raids in 2019, most of the migrants picked up by ICE didn't have a record. Out of the nearly 700 people detained, about 230 were removed from the country under prior removal orders and other causes, according to the Mississippi Center for Justice.\nLocal immigration activists told NPR that agents also briefly detained people with work permits.\nIt was the first day of school\n\"It makes me want to cry if I just think back, because it was a lot of pain,\" says Kimberly Trujillo, an interpreter at a local dental clinic.\n\"We saw kids suffer, husbands, wives, and it's not something that should happen,\" says the longtime Morton resident. \"Nobody deserves this.\"\nBefore the raids, Trujillo, who is fluent in Spanish and English, served as an unofficial translator for neighbors and friends who needed help filling out paperwork or making phone calls. Right after the raid she says her phone \"blew up\" with calls from people pleading for help in finding their loved ones.\nMany ended up in detention centers near New Orleans. The Department of Justice says they quickly released single parents, pregnant women, and breastfeeding mothers — many with ankle monitors.\nBut kids whose parents worked at the poultry plants returned from the first day of school to empty homes.\nThis is what everyone remembers as being the worst part of the raids.\n\"When I came home from work, my house was full of kids,\" Trujillo recalls. \"I had four of my godkids at the house because their parents were taken.\"\nScott County Sheriff Mike Lee describes the day as \"pretty frantic,\" a feeling that lasted a couple of days as Lee and his deputies knocked on doors to take kids to a local church where families were being reunited.\n\"I never wanna make it as if I'm criticizing the men and women that work for ICE, but the planning could have been better,\" Lee says. \"We had kids that were coming from schools and the parents were not gonna be at home, and these were young children.\"\nTwo days after the raids, then-President Trump was asked by reporters why there \"wasn't a better plan in place to deal with the migrant children.\"\nHis response was a warning for migrants with no legal status.\n\"I want people to know that if they come into the United States illegally, they're getting out,\" Trump told reporters. \"This serves as a very good deterrent.\"\nSheriff Lee says his agency will work with the federal government if it's required to carry out mass deportations and workplace raids.\nBut he says such actions \"would severely hurt this area of Mississippi\" by eroding the trust between his department and the community. This county is about 15 percent Hispanic according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\nEconomic and cultural impact lingers\nWorkplace raids have also hurt small businesses in Morton.\nTodd Hensley, who owns the thrift store in downtown Morton, says if unauthorized immigrants were deported again, he'd lose 50 percent of his business.\n\"I'm gonna be aggravated because everyone would be gone, and I'm not gonna make any money,\" Hensley says. \"I might close down if they leave — it'd be that serious.\"\nEven so, Hensley, like the majority of voters in Scott County, cast his ballot for Donald Trump.\nSofía Hernandez is the owner of María's Mercado, a Mexican restaurant and convenience store in downtown Morton.\n\"We were affected because many people were taken away, and our sales went down,\" she says in Spanish. \"The whole town of Morton experienced sadness and pain. You can still feel it to this date.\"\nShe used to take up to 80 lunch orders a day, she says. After the raid, a lot of her customers never came back to Morton. The food orders went down to zero, and she had to lay off employees.\nBut the impact to Koch Foods was less noticeable. The plant here halted production for only half a day, and hosted a job fair later that week to fill the vacancies.\nThe company didn't respond to a request for comment for this story, but in a statement in 2019, the company denied any allegations of wrongdoing and said it adhered to federal labor laws when verifying the immigration status of employees.\nAt least four managers at two other companies faced federal charges related to the raids, including identity theft, harboring people who have entered the country illegally and fraud. According to court documents, almost all those charges were dismissed. Of the three sentenced to probation, two were fined $1,500.\nJosé Gaspar used to work at one of the chicken plants that was raided. On that day, he was assigned to a later shift, so he missed the ICE agents.\nAfter the raid, he says, people didn't want to leave their homes and Morton turned into a ghost town. Some moved to other states; others went to Mexico.\n\"Your people, your friends, your work family — that after years of working together you become a family — suddenly disappear,\" he says. \"You are left alone.\"\nGaspar says he's worried it could all happen again.\nConstant fear for the future\nEl Pueblo, a nonprofit organization that provides legal assistance to immigrants, is trying to help to ease the fears.\n\"We can't predict the future, but we can at least help people prepare,\" says Executive Director Mike Oropeza.\nOropeza's group, which has community centers in towns affected by the 2019 raids, is helping parents complete guardianship and power of attorney paperwork for their kids in case they are deported.\n\"Our goal is to alleviate some of the fear,\" she says.\nEl Pueblo has hosted know-your-rights events during Spanish-language Masses, visiting local churches and handing out workbooks to help people plan ahead. Oropeza met with the school district in Forest, Miss., to make a game-plan in case kids end up stranded again.\nBaldomero Orozco-Juarez and his wife, Silvia García, have been making plans for their two children to be looked after in the event of another raid. Their kids are U.S.-born citizens.\nDuring the 2019 raids, Orozco-Juarez was arrested, detained in a facility in Louisiana for 11 months, and deported to Guatemala. But after 18 months and three attempts, he made it back into the U.S. and now works at a different poultry plant in the area.\nOrozco-Juarez says people who are skeptical about Trump's mass deportation promises and think it will only target violent criminals or be conducted in border towns have not lived through such a traumatic event.\n\"This government is really going to fulfill its promises,\" Orozco-Juarez says. \"Those of us who have gone through this are scared.\"\nHe says he wants only one thing: to be left alone and to be able to continue to work to provide for his two kids.\nNPR's Liz Baker contributed to this story.\nAudio transcript\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\nPresident-elect Trump's mass deportation plan was a prominent campaign pledge during his most recent run for office. But for a group of small towns in Central Mississippi, it's not just an idea. It's a life-changing event. More than 700 migrants were arrested in workplace raids in the area the last time Trump was in office at chicken processing plants that form the backbone of the local economy. As NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán reports, the memory of those raids still looms large.\nSERGIO MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN, BYLINE: Secondhand stuff spills across the sidewalk outside a small thrift store in downtown Morton, Mississippi. It's right across from the town's biggest employer, a chicken processing plant. There are interesting finds at this store - an old karaoke machine, a blue chest that looks like it came out of a pirate movie, and an orange chainsaw that Raymond Davila is inspecting closely. Suddenly, a noise pulls Davila's attention skyward.\n(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER OVERHEAD)\nRAYMOND DAVILA: (Non-English language spoken). Medical. That's a medical helicopter.\nMARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: He says a Border Patrol helicopter sounds different. He always keeps an ear out for the same reason he says he always carries his birth certificate and Social Security card with him to his job at the chicken plant.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)\nUNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #1: U.S. officials confirming some major ICE raids in Mississippi.\nUNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #2: Six hundred and eighty people rounded up by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: The operation targeted processing plants in half a dozen towns outside Jackson.\nMARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: It was the morning of August 7, 2019. Seven poultry plants in Central Mississippi were raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE. Six hundred and eighty workers were taken away with no warning, more than half right here in Morton.\nBRANDY FREEMAN: It was horrible. It was really horrible.\nMARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: The memory of that day causes Brandy Freeman to pause her thrift shopping and tear up. Her partner is from Guatemala and in the country illegally. She tells us she worries he'll be caught in a new raid, leaving behind their 3-year-old son.\nFREEMAN: We've talked about it. I got numbers that I could call, but other than that, it's a constant worry, you know?\nMARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: The events that day disrupted the lives of nearly everyone in town, including Kimberly Trujillo, who works at a dental office.\nKIMBERLY TRUJILLO: Well, I got to work. Thirty minutes later, my phone starts blowing up.\nMARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Before the raid, Trujillo was an unofficial translator, helping her Spanish-speaking neighbors with English language paperwork. So the day of the raid, people called her for help.\nTRUJILLO: There's been a raid at the chicken plant, and they took my wife or my husband. We need to find them. We don't know where they are. Can you help us?\nMARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: She spent all day calling around, trying to figure out where people had been taken to. Many ended up out of state.\nTRUJILLO: It was a sad day. When I came home from work, my house was full of kids. I had four of my godkids at the house 'cause their parents were taken.\nMARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: This is what everybody remembers as being the worst part of the raids. It was the first day of school. And for the kids whose parents got detained by ICE, they returned to empty houses.\nMIKE LEE: It was a pretty frantic, I would say, two days.\nMARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Scott County Sheriff Mike Lee has been critical of what went down that day.\nLEE: I never want to make it as if I'm criticizing the men and women that work for ICE, but the planning could have been better because we had kids that were coming from schools and parents were not going to be at home. And these were young children.\nMARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Two days after the raid, President Donald Trump was asked about that at a press gaggle before boarding Marine One.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nDONALD TRUMP: I want people to know that if they come into the United States illegally, they're getting out. They're going to be brought out. And this serves as a very good deterrent.\nMARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: As he gets ready to start serving a second term, Trump and his advisers have said workplace raids will be restarted after the Biden administration stopped them. Trump's team says they'll first go after migrants with criminal records and final orders of deportation. But in the 2019 raid, most of the migrants picked up by ICE didn't have a record. Out of the nearly 700 detained, about 230 were removed from the country for causes such as prior removal orders, according to the Mississippi Center for Justice. Local activists say agents also briefly detained people with work permits. Sheriff Lee says in his community, migrants are not committing crimes.\nLEE: If you ride around our community, you'll see that we have a very good, safe community, and that includes the people that are here potentially illegally or working. So we would make sure the laws are carried out, but it would severely hurt this area of Mississippi.\nMARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: And local business owners can attest to that. Sofia Hernandez is the owner of Maria's Mercado, a little restaurant and convenience store in downtown Morton.\nSOFIA HERNANDEZ: (Speaking Spanish).\nMARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: She used to take up to 80 lunch orders a day, she says. After the raid, a lot of her customers never came back to Morton. The orders went down to zero. She had to fire employees. Todd Hensley, the thrift shop owner, says he was affected, too. Still, he voted for Trump, like the majority of Scott County.\nTODD HENSLEY: About 50% of my business here is immigrants. Now, if I lose those 'cents, yeah, I'm going to be aggravated about it because they're going to be gone, and I'm not going - I'm not going to make any money. I mean, I might close down if they leave. It'd be that serious. But lots of businesses would close down.\nMARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: The chicken plants are likely to survive, though. At least they did after the 2019 raid. One of them, Cook Foods, halted production for half a day and hosted a job fair that same week. Cook Foods didn't respond to a request for comment for the story, but in a statement in 2019, the company denied any allegations of wrongdoing and said it adhered to federal law when verifying the immigration status of employees. At least four managers at two other companies faced charges related to their raids. Silvia Garcia's husband worked in one of the plants when ICE agents stormed in. He was arrested, detained and deported to Guatemala. It took him about a year and a half and three tries to get back to his family in Mississippi.\nSILVIA GARCIA: (Speaking Spanish).\nMARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Garcia says the experience devastated their two kids psychologically. Max, their 11-year-old, is still in therapy. These days, the family is all together. They wear colorful, woven Guatemalan shirts to church. The kids have pet guinea pigs and Benjie, a small dog.\n(SOUNDBITE OF BENJIE BARKING)\nMARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: But husband, Baldomero Orozco-Juarez, still works in a poultry plant, and the couple worries about the future.\nBALDOMERO OROZCO-JUAREZ: (Speaking Spanish).\nMARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Orozco-Juarez says he believes Trump will follow through on his campaign promises, so he and his wife have arranged for someone to take care of their kids in case they are deported.\nOROZCO-JUAREZ: (Speaking Spanish).\nMARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: \"Those who have gone through the pain of being separated from their families,\" Orozco-Juarez says, \"know that anything can happen under Trump.\"\nSergio Martínez-Beltrán, NPR News, Central Mississippi.\n(SOUNDBITE OF CASPIAN'S \"CMF\")",
