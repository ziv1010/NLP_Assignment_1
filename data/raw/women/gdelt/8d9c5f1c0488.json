  "body_text": "Trinity Rodman Becomes Youngest Player In NWSL History To Reach 10 Goals, 10 Assists\nMany know Dennis Rodman as the iconic NBA forward and Hall of Fame inductee. However, his daughter is becoming a household name in her respective sport, most recently breaking Sam Kerr’s National Women’s Soccer League record.\nTrinity Rodman’s rise in popularity is directly tied to her emergence on the soccer scene, from which she has quickly won the hearts of soccer fanatics. The sports world seemingly looks to make the 20-year-old the next face of U.S. women’s soccer.\nThe youngster recently helped Washington Spirit clinch a 3-1 win over the San Diego Wave, outshooting the Wave 15-4 while stopping a two-match NWSL winless stretch Saturday afternoon. The first half went goalless, but Trinity Rodman broke the deadlock in the 55th minute of the second half. Twenty minutes later, the rookie forward helped the Spirits take the lead after assisting her teammate, Ashley Sanchez. This is the Spirit’s third win of the season.\nA work of art 🎨\nTrinity Rodman sets it up and Ashley Sanchez finishes beautifully to double the Spirit's lead!\n📺: @CBS pic.twitter.com/adnR1F0h7Y\n— National Women’s Soccer League (@NWSL) May 6, 2023\nIn the thrilling victory for Washington, the U.S. women’s national team star scored a goal and added an assist to her name, placing Trinity in the NWSL history books: She became the youngest player in league history with 10 goals and 10 assists.\nThis outstanding start to the 2023 season sees Rodman boast three goals and two assists in just six games of the campaign. We wouldn’t be surprised to see her as a starter for the USWNT at this summer’s Women’s World Cup. The USWNT starlet is gaining major props across the soccer world, which is astounded by her talent.\n“Crushing it! D.C. has a special one,” while another wrote, “I hope she crushes it in the World Cup. She’s great in the league…” one fan said.\nFans have even called her a “Future Hall of Famer,” suggesting Trinity will also reach the stardom to achieve NWSL Hall of Fame status as her dad did in the NBA.\nFantastic young player!!\n— Robert Beckel (@40_trebor) May 7, 2023\nIn 2021, Trinity made a sensational debut, becoming the youngest player drafted in the NWSL when Washington Spirit picked her second overall pick. The starlet scored her first professional goal in the first five minutes after coming on as a substitute.\nShe then helped them win the NWSL Championship. The rookie finished as the second-highest scorer for Spirit that same year, scoring seven goals and assisting seven more in the rookie season.\nWith the 2nd pick in the 2021 NWSL Draft…@WashSpirit selects: Trinity Rodman from Washington State University\n#NWSLDraft pic.twitter.com/77wZDHvxsj\n— National Women’s Soccer League (@NWSL) January 14, 2021\nThis would also result in Trinity receiving a well-deserved, record-breaking contract worth $1.1 million from Washington Spirit, making her the highest-paid National Women’s Soccer League player.\nWe’ll see Trinity and the Washington Spirit in action on May 11 at Angel City, where they will be looking to continue their undefeated record. Trinity Rodman has started the NWSL in the best possible way, and we can’t wait to see what she does next.",
