As I’ve always said, I did nothing wrong.\n\"It’s been a difficult time, but I’ve always known the truth. Now I’m just looking forward to focusing fully on the Euros and spending time with my family.”\nFocus on the Euros she did, with Ms Keating making up part of the historic Lionesses side who became the first England senior side to retain a major tournament.\nWhile she didn't play a minute in Switzerland, Ms Keating made up an important part of the squad and was quick to pile the praise on team-mate Michelle Agyemang, following the teenager's heroic equaliser against Italy.\nREAD MORE: Cat Deeley found UK move 'really hard' before Patrick Kielty break up\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, she said: \"Mich is Mich, I think she's such a good person to have in the team. You know what you're going to get hard work goals.\n\"At such a young age, it's an inspiration to see. Someone my age, a little bit younger, is going out and scoring goals that could've sent us home if she didn't score.\"\nOn her character: \"Mich always has that underlying confidence, she might not be the loudest one in the group or the one that's walking with her chest held high. But she always knows what she has to do and she's very good at it.\" Joking, Ms Keating concluded: \"I'm the loud one, she's the quiet one.\"\nMs Keating will now have a period of time away from football before she returns to City training ahead of the new Women's Super League season. The Blues get their campaign underway against reigning champions Chelsea on Friday, September 5.",
