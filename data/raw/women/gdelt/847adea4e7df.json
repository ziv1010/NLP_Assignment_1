  "body_text": "In a bold move that defies the odds, the NRLW’s youngest captain is proving why she’s not just a leader on the field but a visionary off it too.\nZali Hopkins is part of a new breed of sportspeople planning for life after sport super early despite a shocking pay disparity and insufficient financial education for young players.\nShe built her first investment property the year after she debuted for the St George Illawarra Dragons Women’s side that she now co-captains – choosing to go interstate to Queensland for great value and strong returns in partnership with her mum.\nMORE: Origin star Reece Walsh’s staggering $520k windfall\nBuilder’s epic $740k council fine for daughter’s cubby house\nMORE: $74,800 rise: Aus capital leading home price spike\nMapped: Owners of Aus’ trashed islands named\n“It’s important to me not just as an investment, but as a step toward long-term stability beyond my playing career,” she told The Courier-Mail.\nShe called on clubs to step up educational efforts for players so they could build a future outside sport.\n“While we are often supported in developing sport-specific or performance-related skills, there is limited guidance when it comes to financial literacy or investing.” she said. “This is an area where clubs could step in and provide structured support, helping players build long-term financial security.\nMORE: How NRL stars are banking an off-field fortune\nCash-strap student turns $40k to 38 homes\nThe NRLW fullback is one of 22 sportspeople partnering with full service buyer’s agency Prpty360 to invest their earnings into property, including Broncos coach Michael Maguire and second rower Jordan Riki.\nAgency director Julian Fadini said it was harder for women in sports, being paid much less than men, so investing early was a wise move.\n“Because Zali is early on in her career, she needed a high performing asset that has rental income to help cover costs for holding.”\n“With Zali we identified the area because of its entry point in terms of the affordability, and the other part was the prospects for growth.”\nMORE: Govt pays $3.3m for unliveable derelict house\nATO’s dragnet: Millions of side hustles face shock tax bill\nMs Hopkins and her mum bought a block of land in Cairns in 2021, paying $228,000 before going on to build a four-bedroom house on it which was completed a year and a half later.\n“The entry point was perfect for my mum and I, and the rent was so high that it almost covered the mortgage,” Ms Hopkins said.\n“The area we bought in was close to the water, and it has a lot to offer lifestyle-wise”.\n“My advice to others — especially NRLW players — is to work hard, stay focused, and if possible, try to save a portion of your salary.”\n“Investing in property can be a smart long-term move. Set goals that are realistic and achievable, and start planning early. It’s never too soon to think about your future beyond the game.”\nMORE: Revealed: Complete property investor tax checklist for 2025\nTammy Hembrow’s $50m empire at risk in divorce bombshell\nHer Cairns property now rents $670 a week, but property data shows it could fetch as high as $864 a week given how dire the housing supply situation has become in Far North Queensland. Its value has also jumped to $800,000 in less than two years since it was built.\nMr Fadini said her property was performing “extremely well”.\n“The lifestyle appeal of the area is as good as it gets. She’s very close to millionaires and multi-millionaires row and very close to the marina and the water.”\nHe said athletes in particular were very young when they first came into huge contracts, and there was a growing focus on players’ agents not just securing their contracts and playing career but also making sure players don’t retire without any money afterwards.\n“Our athletes are hitting their big contracts in their early 20s,” he said.\nMORE: Inside new Liberal leader’s property portfolio\nKochie warns RBA rate cut gamble could backfire\n“Of all the kids that go out and play rugby league on a weekend, a very small percentage of those will make it into what’s considered the first step, which would be like an $80,000 contract or $120,000 contract to play, and then a vast majority of them will not go any further than that.”\n“The ones that do make it through will go from $80-120k to $250k all the way up to $750,000 or potentially more.”\n“It turns out that we’re the guys that they turned to invest the young players’ money into real estate. And we were carefully watched for about two years and thoroughly checked out before we received our first set of football clients. And then, we’ve just grown from there.”\nMs Hopkins said she would love to be able to buy in Sydney one day too, with property remaining a firm part of her post-sport plan.\n“My goal is to purchase another property independently by the end of this year. It’s something I’ve been working towards by staying disciplined with my finances, saving consistently and setting realistic targets.”\nMr Fadini said they generally recommended clients buy properties that appeal to owner-occupiers, even if they never intended to live there themselves.\n“What we typically work on are houses that have four bedrooms, two bathrooms and double lockup garages. That’s what we find is the best to buy as they are suitable to owner-occupiers and families. Investors come and go from the market, but owner occupiers are consistent, and they are the ones that drive price growth. It’s fundamental for us.”",
