  "body_text": "It was not the ending she deserved but Mary Earps rightly celebrated her Golden Glove award, holding it aloft and taking applause, after England's Women's World Cup final defeat by Spain.\nEngland's number one had done everything in her power to try to bring the World Cup trophy home - including saving Jenni Hermoso's penalty in the final - but it was not enough.\nThe 30-year-old has had a remarkable international career, going from being an outcast and on the brink of retirement, to emerging as one of the most globally recognised goalkeepers in women's football.\nWhile England fell short at the final hurdle, Earps' performances throughout the tournament confirmed her status as the world's best goalkeeper.\n'She's the best for a reason'\nShe made key saves in almost every game, keeping three clean sheets en route to the final and picking up the Player of the Match award after starring in England's penalty shootout win over Nigeria.\nAgainst Haiti, she pushed away Roseline Eloissaint's strike before tipping Lorena Durango Bedoya's effort over the bar in the 2-1 win over Colombia. She blocked an effort from Cortnee Vine late on in the 3-1 win over Australia in the semi-finals and then made four saves against Spain in the 1-0 loss.\n\"That's why she's number one, that's what she does for the team,\" Manchester United team-mate Ella Toone said after the victory over Haiti.\n\"She makes some unbelievable saves. She kept us in the game so that's why she's number one and why she's our goalkeeper.\"\nEngland midfielder Georgia Stanway added: \"She's the best for a reason and moments like that explain why.\"\nEarps kept her best performance for last, making several important saves as England desperately tried to find a way back into the World Cup final, but to no avail.\nShe had her moment of glory - diving low to save Hermoso's spot-kick, roaring in celebration and sticking her tongue out as captain Millie Bright sprinted to pick her up and thank her for giving England a lifeline.\nBut it was not the catalyst for an England comeback as so often her saves are.\nLife before and after Wiegman\nEarps' last World Cup was a very different story. She acted as third-choice goalkeeper in 2019 before being dropped by former manager Phil Neville.\nTwo years passed in which Earps did not represent England. She contemplated retirement before Sarina Wiegman's arrival in September 2021 brought her unwavering confidence.\n\"The reality is my life before Sarina Wiegman and my life after Sarina Wiegman is totally different,\" Earps told BBC Sport in January.\nIn the space of 12 months, Earps had become the undisputed England number one, started every match at Euro 2022 and picked up the Golden Glove as the Lionesses won their first major trophy.\nThe Fifa Best Goalkeeper award followed and Earps has done all she can to retain the crown again this year after her impressive performances on the biggest stage of them all.\nEarps fight for goalkeeping visibility\nSuch has been Earps' rise with the Lionesses, she has become a popular figure among supporters and a prominent role model for young boys and girls.\nBut Earps revealed in July she was \"hurt\" that fans could not buy a replica of her goalkeeper shirt.\nHer comments received widespread support and the Football Association's Mark Bullingham later said it was an issue that would be \"addressed quite soon after the tournament\".\n\"Mary spoke passionately about it and we want to grow goalkeeping - it's building role models,\" he added.\nEarps' performance in England's final defeat has only increased calls for her shirts to be put on sale with ex-Lionesses striker Ellen White saying she hopes one day her baby daughter would have one.\n'Glad Mary spoke up...'\nArsenal forward Beth Mead, who missed the tournament with a knee injury, praised Earps for speaking up about the situation concerning the availability of the goalkeeper shirt.\n\"She's the best in the world right now, and she didn't have a shirt that young boys and girls could buy,\" said Mead, who was England's standout player in their victorious Euro 2022 campaign.\n\"Are they saying that goalkeepers are not important? Because what Mary did within that tournament, and the last tournament, has been incredible.\n\"From number one to number 23, [plus] the staff behind the squad, everybody's important and that shirt should be out there for Mary. I'm glad she spoke up about it.\"",
