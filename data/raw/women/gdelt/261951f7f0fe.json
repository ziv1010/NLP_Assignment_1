  "body_text": "The USWNT began its process of taking the success from the Olympics forward under manager Emma Hayes. This series of friendlies sees the team squaring off against Iceland with the first match in Austin, Texas last night. The team took the lead in the first half, but a second half equalizer saw the Americans pushing for a game winner in the 85th minute with a third score putting the match away in the 88th.\n2024 October USWNT Friendlies: USA 3-1 Iceland - the Americans find a late winner\nJaedyn Shaw provides the go ahead goal as the 19 year-old leads the USWNT to a win\nTaking a look at the lineup, Hayes’ lineup shows the depth and versatility she has at her disposal as Sophia Smith and Jaedyn Shaw were kept on the bench for the start of the game.\nThe Americans would strike first as Alyssa Thompson found space for a shot from the left side of the goal and slotted home her effort in the upper 90 of the far post.\nGoing behind before the half against the USWNT is a difficult position to be in but Iceland responded by making the score even about 10 minutes after the second 45 began.\nThis was nicely taken by Selma Sol Magnusdottir to give Iceland the chance to hold onto a draw or find a winner of their own.\nThe USWNT battled for a second goal and was rewarded when Shaw nutmegged someone into the Jökulsárlón Iceberg Lagoon to make it 2-1.\nIf Iceland had hopes of finding a stoppage time equalizer, they were dashed shortly before the end of regulation when the lead was doubled by Smith when she buried one off of the volley in the 88th minute.\nIt was strong work by the Americans and the goals were all well taken with the 3-1 result well deserved. Iceland did not want much of the ball as the possession stats favored the home side by a count of 29% to 71% and the Yanks outshot the visitors 13-9.\nThe Americans had to work but ultimately found a way to win. Next up the teams both travel to Nashville where Kelley O’Hara will be honored for her storied career with the national team.",
