  "body_text": "Remember Ben Watson, the former New England Patriots tight end who seemingly played forever? A former first-round pick and Super Bowl champ, Watson is remembered for his hustle play in the 2005 playoffs.\nFollowing a Tom Brady interception at the goal line, Watson hustled the length of the field to track down cornerback Champ Bailey just short of the opposite goal line to save a touchdown. (You can watch the play here.)\nWatson played until age 39, an unusually long career for a tight end.\nLet’s check in to see what Watson is doing now.\nWhere are former Patriots now? | TE Ben Watson (2004-2009, 2019)\nThese days, the 44-year-old Watson lives in Georgia and juggles a variety of pursuits. You can catch on TV working as a college football analyst for SEC Network.\nHe’s also been taking online courses to get his master’s degree in public administration and public policy at American University.\nWatson works with multiple charity and activist causes. He and his wife, Kirsten, co-founded the Watson Seven Foundation, which aims to “strengthen families by enriching marriages and equipping parents so they are empowered with opportunities to thrive and impact their community.”\nWatson, who is outspoken about his thoughts on abortion, serves as the VP of strategic relationships for Human Coalition, “one of the largest pro-life and pro-women organizations in the country.”\nWatson was born in Virginia and later became a high school football star playing for Northwestern High School in Rock Hill, Virginia.\nWatson started his college career at Duke before transferring to Georgia. After three seasons with the Bulldogs, Watson emerged as a top tight end prospect with high-end athleticism for the position.\nFresh off a Super Bowl win, the Patriots drafted Watson No. 32 overall in 2004. Watson played just one game as a rookie before suffering a season-ending knee injury. He won a Super Bowl ring as part of the 2004 team.\nIn 2005, Watson became a key part of the Patriots offense, finishing fourth in receptions and receiving yards. He also made that famous tackle against the Broncos, which Patriots chairman Robert Kraft once described as “one of those plays that we’ll remember the rest of our lives.”\nAfter six seasons in New England, Watson bounced around the league, playing for the Browns, Titans, Ravens and Saints (in two separate stints).\nWatson initially retired from the NFL after the 2018 season. But about five months later, he came out of retirement to return to the Patriots for one last season.\nWatson announced his retirement (for good, this time) in March 2020.",
