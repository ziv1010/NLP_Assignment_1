  "body_text": "It feels like a while since I’ve expressed this, but there’s a lot going well if you’re a Tottenham Hotspur Women supporter. Despite changing their head coach this summer and making just two signings to a team that finished just above relegation last season, Spurs are 2-0 in the WSL with wins over West Ham and Everton. Under manager Martin Ho, Spurs are looking more cohesive, more attacking, and more efficacious defensively, having yet to concede a goal this season. It’s arrows up all across the board.\nTottenham Women vs. Manchester City: match thread and how to watch\nTottenham face their biggest test of the early season by hosting Man City.\nBut now the real test begins. Spurs host Manchester City today at Brisbane Road, a team expected once again to challenge for a Champions League position and who have a huge leg up in resources and gravitas. Spurs haven’t beaten since the infamous “Hand of Ros” match in 2021, and today’s match will be a huge test to see if Martin Ho is magic, or how much work Spurs still have left to do.\nEither way, it’s a huge opportunity as well as a milestone for Spurs. New signing Tinka Tandberg got off the mark against Everton last weekend and already looks to be integrating herself well into the team. Defender Toko Koga is showing an unusual amount of maturity for a 19-year-old playing in a high caliber league. Bethany England is still Bethany England, and Kit Graham is a welcome sight on the pitch, even if she’s still only a reserve midfielder. This should be a fun watch. Hopefully.\nLineups\nWill be posted when released by the clubs\nHow to Watch\nTottenham Hotspur Women vs. Manchester City\nFriday, September 19, 2025\n2:30 p.m. ET / 7:30 p.m. BST\nBrisbane Road, London, UK\nTV: not televised (USA), Sky Sports Premier League (UK)\nStream: ESPN Select (formerly ESPN+)",
