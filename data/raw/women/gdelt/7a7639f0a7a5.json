The week continues with a massive press conference and our public weigh-in, each bringing together the entire fight card. We also look forward to formally introducing the global Netflix audience to US Olympian Jahmal Harvey, who will open the main card of Jake vs. Joshua, and who we believe is the most promising male boxing prospect to come out of Team USA this decade.”\n“MVP keeps raising the bar. Two GOATs in Anderson Silva vs. Tyron Woodley, Alycia Baumgardner ready for a takeover and doing so with men’s rules, and now Jahmal Harvey joining the main card to show the world why he’s America’s next superstar,” said Jake Paul. “Jake vs. Joshua Fight Week is stacked, it’s free for fans, and it’s all building to me shocking the world on Friday, December 19 at Kaseya Center, live only on Netflix.”\nUS Olympian and amateur world champion Jahmal Harvey (1-0, 1 KO) was introduced to boxing at age 13 by his football coach Darrell Davis, who also owned a boxing gym. After competing in both sports, Harvey, an Oxon Hill, Maryland native, soon went all-in on boxing and immediately proved his elite potential at the junior, youth, and amateur levels, becoming a 10x national champion. By 18, he was training and sparring with Olympians, including Keyshawn Davis and Duke Ragan. That same year, he captured gold at the 2021 Elite World Championships— becoming the first American male to win the world title since 2007, while competing as one of the youngest athletes in the tournament. The next year, he took home silver at the 2022 Continental Championships and continued to dominate at the international level in 2023, winning gold at the Santiago Pan American Games. The finish qualified him for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, where he finished as a quarter-finalist. The 22-year-old Harvey signed with Most Valuable Promotions ahead of his professional debut–a knockout win–on MVP’s Most Valuable Prospects 14 in August 2025, heralded as one of the top prospects in American boxing.\nKevin Cervantes (5-0, 5 KOs) comes to the ring from Los Angeles by way of Barranquilla, Colombia. The 25-year-old prospect holds a perfect undefeated record so far in his pro career, and comes to the ring fresh from his latest first-round TKO win in September 2025. He began boxing at just 11 years old after his parents introduced him to the sport to channel his energy and fighting spirit productively. With an impressive 87-fight amateur background, Cervantes has developed into a relentless brawler known for his aggressive, high-pressure style reminiscent of his idol, Roberto “Manos de Piedra” Durán. Defined by his hard work, discipline, and commitment, Cervantes continues to build his name in the professional ranks as one of the sport’s most determined young fighters. He is managed by Rob Suarez and trained by Oscar Negrete.\nMVP’s new signee Luan Medeiros (6-0, 4 KOs) is an undefeated professional lightweight boxer and the current CNB Super Lightweight Brazilian National Champion. As an amateur, he built an extensive career with close to 150 fights, boasting over 114 wins and becoming a Brazilian National Champion, Copa del Pacífico winner in Ecuador, and a Cheo Aponte Tournament runner-up in Puerto Rico. Domestically, he won multiple regional titles, including 4x Rio de Janeiro state champion, 3x São Paulo state champion, Paraná state champion, Sul-Sudeste champion, and Centro-Oeste champion. He also represented Brazil internationally, winning team challenges against Italy and Argentina. Outside the ring, the 30-year-old Luan is known for his relationship with Brazilian A-list actress Mel Maia, who has over 21 million followers. His opponent, Hugo Macias (7-1-1, 5 KOs), is a 32-year-old prospect from Tijuana, Mexico. Macias most recently earned a 4th round TKO win in September 2025, and now makes his international boxing debut in his first pro bout outside of Mexico against Medeiros.\nFormer WBA bantamweight world champion at 118lbs and Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire native, Shannon Courtenay (9‑3, 3 KOs) transformed her life and career after discovering boxing in her early twenties, trading in a party lifestyle for intense discipline at Finchley ABC in London. Rising through the professional ranks beginning in March 2019, she claimed the vacant WBA female bantamweight title in April 2021, delivering a fiercely technical and emotional unanimous decision over Australia’s Ebanie Bridges in what many hailed as one of women's boxing’s best fights. Courtenay’s jab proved decisive, and she overcame early cut damage and increasing pressure to outmaneuver Bridges and increasingly exploit a swelling eye that nearly shut by round eight. Unfortunately, Courtenay was stripped of her title ahead of her first defense in October 2021 when she came in 2.5 lb over the limit, an issue she attributed to an unexpected menstrual cycle—a rare moment of honesty that highlighted health over title retention. She subsequently faced Jamie Mitchell at Liverpool’s Echo Arena, losing a hard-fought majority decision in October 2021 despite staying in the ring through adversity. Courtenay returned to the ring in October 2024, edged out with a competitive points decision defeat to Catherine Tacone Ramos in a six-round bout at London’s Copper Box Arena. She most recently defeated Bec Connolly in March 2025. Her opponent, Jessica Radtke Maltez (2-2-2) comes to the ring from Waconia, Minnesota. Maltez most recently earned a unanimous decision win in September 2025.\nMVP’s new signee Jocelyn Camarillo (5-0) is a 3x amateur national champion, former #1-ranked US amateur in the light flyweight division, and a proud training partner for Team USA Youth & Elite. She proudly represents Indio, California as one of the brightest young talents coming out of the Coachella Valley boxing community. Jocelyn grew up watching boxing and developed a natural passion that eventually led her to train at the historic Coachella Valley Boxing Club, where she built a strong amateur foundation and sharpened her skills among some of the region’s best athletes. Known for her speed, accuracy, and high-IQ pressure style, Jocelyn has quickly developed a reputation as a disciplined athlete with true star potential. Both inside and outside the ring, she brings charisma, professionalism, and a growing fanbase that continues to follow her journey. As she enters the next chapter of her career with MVP, standing 5-0 on her pro career, Jocelyn is focused, hungry, and ready to take on bigger challenges. She will face Yazmin Martinez Jimenez (3-2-2, 1 KO) over 4 rounds at light flyweight. Jimenez, the 24-year-old prospect, fights out of Mexico City, Mexico and most recently earned a TKO win in March 2025 and a split draw in October 2025 against highly touted and undefeated prospect, Perla Bazaldua.\nFor more information, follow on X via @MostVPromotions and @Netflix, on Instagram via @MostValuablePromotions and @Netflix, or on Netflix’s Tudum.\nAbout Most Valuable Promotions (MVP)\nMVP was founded by Jake Paul and Nakisa Bidarian in 2021.
