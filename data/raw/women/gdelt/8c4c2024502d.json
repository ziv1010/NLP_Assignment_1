With this in mind, the 14-time Champions League winner’s new kit takes on an understated design, with the predominately white color scheme being complemented by speckles of yellow and a navy layered crew neck flat knit collar, while a bold navy stripe runs vertically down the side.\nHowever, while the new jersey for Madrid seems like an updated version of a classic, the strip features a first-of-its-kind feature: a detailed inclusion of the club’s slogan, “¡Hala Madrid!” on the collar — a battle cry which often rings around the terraces of the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.\nFurthermore, both the on-field and fan version of the shirts are made with 100% recycled materials, while the on-field iteration of the shirt is optimized with HEAT.RDY technology that uses advanced materials to increase airflow to make players feel cool. Meanwhile, the fan version of the kit comes with sweat-wicking and absorbent AEROREADY materials to keep the body feeling dry.\nIn celebration of the new jersey and its ability to unite, the latest Madrid drop is marked with a “family photo,” and it brings together members of Real Madrid’s men’s and women’s football teams along with its women’s basketball athletes, representatives from its youth academies, and players from its Genuine team who compete in the La Liga Genuine.\nYou can check out the new Real Madrid jersey above and you will be able to see it for the first time IRL when the club begins its pre-season tour across the United States. The jersey is also available to shop now via the official Real Madrid webstore and with adidas retailers.\nIn other news, take a look at the new collection from TEMPLA.",
