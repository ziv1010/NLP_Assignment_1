  "body_text": "Arsenal complete signing of USWNT defender Jenna Nighswonger\n- Arsenal have signed Jenna Nighswonger from NJ/NY Gotham on a permanent deal\n- The 24-year-old was the Rookie of the Year in her debut NWSL season\n- Nighswonger: 'I want to win trophies with this club'\nArsenal have signed USWNT defender Jenna Nighswonger from NWSL side NJ/NY Gotham on a permanent transfer.\nNews broke earlier this week that the Gunners had confirmed their interest in the defender and had reached an agreement with the New York side. Nighswonger's contract was set to expire at the end of the 2025 NWSL season, meaning she would have had the opportunity to explore free agency in November.\nShe has spent the last two seasons with Gotham, taking home the 2023 NWSL Rookie of the Year honour in her debut season. The defender saw her game time dwindle in the back-end of the 2024 campaign, struggling for a starting position in Juan Carlos Amoros's side.\nThe defender confirmed the news of her departure from the New York side via social media on Thursday morning, telling fans \"NJ will always be a place I call home\".\nNighswonger was a member of the U.S Women's National Team squad that took home gold at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, featuring in four of the six fixtures. Making her senior debut for the nation in 2023, she has since appeared on the world stage 18 times.\nPrimarily plying her trade at left-back, the versatile defender can also play at centre-back and midfield when called upon. Nighswonger's arrival will provide head coach Renee Slegers with a plethora of depth in defence, as well as the ability to push Katie McCabe further up the pitch when necessary.\nThe 24-year-old becomes Arsenal's only signing of the January transfer window, following a handful of departures from the north-London club. Academy prospects Vivianne Lia, Laila Harbart, Maddy Earl and Freya Godfrey are all exploring loan ventures, whilst Kathrine Kuhl departs for AS Roma on a permanent transfer.\n“I’m so happy to be here,” said Nighswonger. “I’ve always wanted to play in England and joining such an historic football club is a dream come true. I want to win trophies with this club and help the team in any way possible. It’s an incredible feeling to be able to call myself an Arsenal player and I can’t wait to get started.”\nDirector of Women’s Football Clare Wheatley spoke on the signing, expressing “We’re delighted to bring Jenna to the club and strengthen our squad in a key area going into an important second half of the season and beyond.\n\"Jenna has already won trophies with both club and country but has clear potential for future growth and development, so we’re confident she will make a great contribution here at Arsenal. I’m sure our wonderful supporters will join me in welcoming Jenna and her family to the club.”",
