The list was selected by more than 500 film executives, a record number of voters ever for a Black List survey.\n“Twenty years can feel like a long time or a blink of an eye depending on the moment,” Black List founder Franklin Leonard said in a statement. “Throughout that time, this is always the best part: Finding and sharing great stories well told with the rest of the community of folks who care about them. I look forward to these scripts finding the success and audience that previous annual Black List scripts have found and to watching these movies in theaters as soon as they’re available.”\nSince 2005, the annual Black List has recognized an eclectic mix of screenplays as embodied by its 2024 honorees ranging from stories of highly competitive pool sharks, celebrity werewolves, Peloton instructors in mortal danger, and the true crime corporate stories of Tickle Me Elmo and Abercrombie & Fitch.\nThe 2024 list-topping script, “One Night Only,” follows “two strangers scrambling to find someone to sleep with on the one night of the year when premarital sex is legal.” Its author, Travis Braun, also wrote “Bad Boy,” which was the number 1 script on the 2023 Black List.\nIn total, at least 450 Black List scripts have been produced, grossing over $30 billion in box office worldwide. Black List movies have won 54 Academy Awards from 273 nominations, including four Best Picture Oscars and 11 Best Screenplay Oscars since 2007.\nThe Black List is behind multiple Best Picture Oscar winners, including “Spotlight,” “Argo,” “Slumdog Millionaire,” “The King’s Speech,” and “I, Tonya.” A 2019 Harvard Business School study found that The Black List scripts were “twice as likely to be made into films, with 30 percent of them produced, compared to 15 percent of non-listed scripts.” Additionally, The Black List screenplays “did better at theaters with movies of the same budget generating 90 percent more revenue at the box office.”\nOn December 2, 2024, the Gotham Film and Media Institute awarded the Black List a 20th anniversary tribute award as part of its 2024 Gotham Film Awards.\nSee the full list of screenplays below, as separated by genre. Language comes courtesy of The Black List.\nThe 2024 Black List cover image is a quote from the late Alan Rickman, reading, “And it’s a human need to be told stories. The more we’re governed by idiots and have no control over our destinies, the more we need to tell stories to each other about who we are, why we are, where we come from, and what might be possible.”\nONE NIGHT ONLY by Travis Braun (60 mentions)\nTwo strangers scramble to find someone to sleep with on the one night of the year when premarital sex is legal.\nAgency: UTA\nAgent(s): Charles Ferraro, Zoe Prince\nManagement Company: Echo Lake Entertainment\nManager(s): Matt Horwitz, Kara Hume, Amotz Zakai\nStudio: None\nProduction Companies: Olive Bridge Productions\nPLAYDATE by Marie Østerbye (39 mentions)\nWhen taking her daughter to a playdate at a new friend’s house, Alice suddenly comes face to face with her childhood bully, Katrine.
