Terry McDonagh’s poem, ‘Cill Aodain’ opens the Trail at The Square. The gathering will then proceed to the Emigrant Park, reading other poems along the route. Afterwards, the poets will retire to The Folk Cafe for an open mic session with more readings and maybe a song or a tune. Everyone is invited along the trail and encouraged to bring a poem or a song.\nThe Kiltimagh Poetry Trail is funded by Creative Ireland, led in the county by Austin Vaughan, the Mayo County Librarian. The Trail aims to grow and include more poets and poems, over time. It is hoped to include the work of international poets. The process works by invitation from the organising committee. They invite specific poets to submit pieces of up to twenty lines in length. The poems can be on any topic, and if suitable, they will be displayed on locations around the town.\nBorn in Sligo, Martin Dyar grew up in Swinford. A graduate of NUIG and TCD, his poetry has received a number of honours, including the Patrick Kavanagh Poetry Award in 2009, and the Strokestown International Poetry Award in 2001. In 2010 he was selected for the Poetry Ireland Introductions Series. He has also been a writer in residence at the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa. His debut collection, Maiden Names, published by Arlen House, was shortlisted for the Piggott Prize. He has received two Arts Council Literature Bursary Awards. Martin has read in Kiltimagh, on many occasions.\nKiltimagh CE Scheme has a number of job vacancies.

The final score was Davitts 3-15 Kiltimagh 1-10.\nKiltimagh led for the opening quarter of this match through scores from Conor Malee and two apiece from Jack Niland and Cian Gallagher. Kiltimagh were a match for their opponents for most of the first-half but were undone by a quick-fire goal and a point before the break. Donovan Cosgrove pointed and Kiltimagh got their only goal, from Conor Malee. Kiltimagh tried to get themselves back into contention but were no match for the speed and fitness displayed by the home side. Cian Gallagher with two, and Jordan Henry completed Kiltimagh’s scoring.\nKiltimagh face Castlebar Mitchels B in the final group stage round, next Sunday, September 15, at 12 noon in Aghamore.\nAs the Mayo League ends, so too does the careers of two outstanding players. KKU captain Ronan Malee and goalkeeper Niall Walshe have announced their retirements. Malee operated as a defensive midfielder for the senior team and was one of the best in the league. He captained the side for the past three seasons, and was a great leader on and off the pitch. He knew exactly what needed to be said to rally the troops, in tough moments. Ronan was a great organiser, too, and took pressure off the management by taking on many off-field tasks.\nRonan is a very skilled footballer. He could win the ball in a tackle, and could vary his passing, or take on players before laying the ball off to a team mate. He displayed a determination to fight for every ball, never stop running and he always pushed his teammates to raise their efforts. His leadership and his skill, will be missed by the club.\nNiall Walshe made some outstanding saves for KKU, these past few seasons. He is a brave goalkeeper, good in the air and with great distribution. KKU had a difficult season, finishing mid-table, as the club introduced many new players, but Niall always encouraged the young players and made many outstanding saves. Niall was a key figure between the posts. Niall was an ever-present at training and was always willing to put in that extra work needed to improve himself.\nNiall’s love of drawing-in the opposition striker before sidestepping him, often gave the team management frights, but he always succeeded. A goalkeeper that is as good with his feet as he is with the more traditional goalkeeping attributes is a rare find, but Niall certainly had it all. Both Ronan and Niall are wished the very best of luck in their retirement.\nAn under-strength Kiltimagh Knock United women's team exited the Mayo Women's Cup at the semi-final stage, losing to Manulla. Rosie McDonnell scored the KK goal. That wraps up the women's season, which sees them playing Division One football next year. It is promising to see lots of young talent coming through the ranks and the future looks bright for the KK women.\nCongratulations to Kiltimagh Knock United's Kate Byrne who has been named as the February Player of the Month in the Under 17 Premier Division by the Mayo Women's League. The awards were recently announced, with the presentations to take place later in the season.\nTwo players from the Kiltimagh Knock United girls’ section have been called up the Centre of Excellence in Milebush, Castlebar. Congratulations and good wishes are extended to Ava Mitchell, U16/17 player, and Michaela Kavanagh, who has featured on the club's U14, 15 and 16 squads this year.\nLast week's Kiltimagh Knock United 50/50 jackpot was won by Mick Spindler from Kilkenny. The lucky ticket, which netted Mick €332, was sold in O'Hora's Pub in Kiltimagh.\nCondolences are extended to Una Conway on the passing of her sister-in-law Marian O’Reilly (nee Mohan,) of Roundfort. Marian died peacefully, at the Mayo Hospice Castlebar, surrounded by her family and is predeceased by her parents, May and James. Marian will be deeply missed by her husband Shane, sons Jarlath, David and Alan, grandchildren, nephews, nieces, relatives, neighbours and friends. Marian was laid to rest on Monday, September 2, at Roundfort cemetery after Requiem Mass at the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Roundfort. May she rest in peace.\nAt the weekly poker night in Teach O’Hora on Wednesday night last, the final two seats in the Summer League Grand Final were filled when Alan Sheridan and Michael Higgins finished in the top two places in the play-off tournament. A regular tournament was also held on the night with twenty-two entries, creating a prize-pool of €440. Enda Ruane took first prize. The runner up was Daniel Kennedy with Pat Boyle third and Paul Walsh fourth.

Leitrim, on Thursday, August 29. Mary was Mary Gormally, late of Lisduff, and is a sister of Ted Gormally of Manulla.
