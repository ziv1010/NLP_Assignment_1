After scans on Friday afternoon, Stedman said White looked set for seven to 10 weeks on the sidelines.\nThings quickly turned from bad to worse for the club's goalkeeping stocks when reserve-grade shot-stopper Ngawai Pirini was red-carded 18 minutes into New Lambton's 6-1 loss to defending champions Charlestown Azzurri at Alder Park last Sunday. Pirini, who had already played reserve grade, was caught off her line and handled the ball outside the area. She was subsequently suspended for one game.\nDefender Finley Woodforth, who has no goalkeeping experience, donned the gloves against Azzurri but is not expected to be called upon this weekend.\nThere are two signing windows for NPLW. One closes on February 7 and there is another mid-season.\nLast year, Newcastle Olympic were granted dispensation to sign Isabella Whitton as an injury replacement for Coelho in the week leading up to round one as the latter had sustained a long-term hand injury.\nAt the time, a spokesperson from Northern NSW Football (NNSWF) said: \"Because goalkeeper is a specialist position, NNSWF can provide dispensation if a senior goalkeeper is out with a long-term injury.\n\"This would involve removing the injured goalkeeper from the club's roster and replacing them with the new player. Meaning the injured player would not be able to play first grade until the mid-season window, when they can be re-added to the roster.\"\nNNSWF rejected New Lambton's request to sign a replacement goalkeeper this week due to different circumstances.\n\"New Lambton FC submitted a first-grade roster with one recognised goalkeeper, with an eligible under-age goalkeeper on their reserve-grade roster,\" a NNSWF spokesperson said.\n\"New Lambton FC's recognised first-grade goalkeeper is now out with a short-term injury (four weeks). The club's reserve-grade goalkeeper was sent off in last week's match and has incurred a one-match suspension to be served this week.\n\"NNSWF has not allowed New Lambton FC to register an extra player outside the player registration window because two goalkeepers are unavailable for one week and four weeks respectively.\n\"NPL regulations permit exemptions for justifiable reasons, of which a season ending injury can be seen as one. As noted, the exemption for Newcastle Olympic last year did not allow another player to be added to their roster. It was only permitted based on the injured player being out for the season and being removed from their roster entirely.\n\"To be clear, a player being sent off is not a justifiable reason to seek an exemption from player registration windows.\"\nStedman said the club was told they were, however, able to sign any player under 20 to play first grade or a player over 20 to play reserve grade.\n\"I appreciate everything Northern do, but it's not black and white sometimes,\" Stedman said.\n\"If it was a field player, we wouldn't even be having the conversation. But a goalkeeper is important, and in Newcastle, there is just such a shortage of goalkeepers at the moment.\n\"Northern need to review the rules and have a look at these circumstances. They just need to be flexible sometimes.\n\"We're not asking for the goalkeeper to be goalkeeper all year. We're just asking the keeper to stand in for a few games, just until Issy can get back on her feet. We're hoping it's only going to be a short one but if it's longer, you're instantly putting pressure on an 18-year-old to be a first-grade keeper for the rest of the year.\n\"This week, we're basically going to go back to under 12s and say, 'Let's do a rotation in goals', and it just doesn't look good for women's football in the highest level in Newcastle. It's not ideal, and I think Northern needs to look at those rules and be a little bit flexible.\n\"Do you want to stick by these rules and stop football growth and put pressure on these young players or do you want to try and build the women's game in Newcastle.\"\nStedman said New Lambton's 17s goalkeeper would also play reserve grade on the weekend but he didn't want to put a 16-year-old in the position of playing three games in a day, including first grade.\n\"I've learnt over the years, you bring young people into senior squads too early and two things, they don't like it, or they're not ready sometimes. So you've got to be careful,\" Stedman said.\nHe was unsure which field player would take on the keeping role against the Magpies.\nIn other round-two NPLW action, Adamstown host Broadmeadow on Saturday (7pm).\nIn NPL Men on Saturday, Charlestown are at home to New Lambton (2pm), Maitland travel to Cooks Hill (4.30pm) and Edgeworth are away to newcomers Belmont Swansea (6.30pm). On Sunday, Lambton meet Broadmeadow at Magic Park (2pm) and Newcastle Olympic play Weston at Darling Street Oval (4.30pm).",
