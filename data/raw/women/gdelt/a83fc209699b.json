And, there is no possibility of routing around damaged areas, or allowing limited and controlled passage – as you can do for damaged roads undergoing repair.Comparing the resilience of the road and rail from Wairoa to Napier for example.\nBoth were washed out and badly damaged (including bridges) in Cyclone Gabrielle (and run pretty much parallel, through the same country). The road has been repaired to some extent – although there are go-slow sections, and ongoing heavy repair work – but cars and restricted-weight trucks can get through.\nThe rail has no time-frame on the repair.\nhttps://www.gisborneherald.co.nz/news/300-damage-sites-on-wairoa-napier-rail-line\nNow, it may be possible that this is due to the level of resources thrown at the two repair tasks. But, I suspect it's due more to the higher level of engineering required for a railbed, than for a road.\nThe remainder of the rail network (through to the Napier port) has been repaired in the 'ugly fast opening' style – but, my understanding is that there was no road closure to the port – in comparison.\nRail may well be a significant and useful heavy transit option – but it is not resilient in extreme weather events.\n-\n-\nWell….the problem as I see it, is not about Rail per se, but who, is running Rail !\nGet Rail back to NZ Rail. Employ the right people. Electrify it.\nI dont know if you have ever looked at the previous comments on here about this ? Over a long period I have put many links. On Transport Efficiency ? Rail wins hands down. Damage to roads ? Trucks cause the most by a major factor. Hydrogen as a fuel? Its still in VERY early stages. Rail is now.\nFYI..in my opinion light trucks still definitely for delivery. Anyway, I will link a couple…one from a Professor (who absolutely knows what she is talking about )\nThe other is a PDF ,not a big one but has all the comparison efficiency figures Rail, Coastal ship, and trucks…albeit doesnt incl hydrogen. As I say…its very early and there are many maybes about Storage (incl on truck…VERY difficult , requires an extremely gas tight tank !)\nhttps://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/research/reports/497/docs/497.pdf\n-\nEvidently we have been subsidizing road freight for the past 30-40 years to the detriment of the Rail Network. Also sold off NZ Rail for a pittance under the 1984 Labour Government to the Merchant Banking Fraternity and Wiscounsin Rail who just asset stripped it to the point the NZ Government had to buy it back to try and save it ???\n-\nYep. That Labour..(in name only, who went on to form act)\n-\nCorrect aka Roger Douglas, Richard Prebble & Michael Bassett.\n-\nAnd (with others) personally responsible for a massive wealth gain for a VERY small number of associated scumbags…and literally generations of suffering for a large number of NZers.\nWhich we are still paying for.\n-\nOne of the rewards for Prebble is that he still gets to write newspaper columns saying how shit everyone else is at running the country with the suggestion that he has the answers.\n-\nDitto for Steven Joyce, Paula Bennett & Shane Jones.\n-\n-\n-\n-\nRegional rail was in rapid and irreversible decline well before Richard Prebble got hold of it. It had been declining since the 1920s even when some branch lines were still being built.\n-\ndeclining since the 1920s\nWas the Think Big of those days.\n-\nThat was the time in our country's history when we needed grand central-driven connection projects.\n-\n-\nWell AD,at 1212. Have you a reference to support that statement\n-\n-\nAlso sold off NZ Rail for a pittance under the 1984 Labour Government\nNational flogged it in 1993.\n/\n-\n-\nI attended the Cabinet Economic Committee Meeting when the electrification of the Main Trunk Line was agreed and approved, it was announced to the media immediately after the meeting by Lance Adam-Schneider, then Minister of Railways. Part of the \"Think Big\" programme under Muldoon.\n-\nPresent at the creation!\nWhat was it like working with Bill Birch? In that era he was like the godchild of Sutch, just wrong side of the tracks. So to speak.\n-\nI was serving on the Naval Staff at that time in a number of roles, one of which was manpower planning. Defence had just moved from fixed term engagements to Open ended engagements – 3 months notice. The effect on some specialisations was horrific – particularly electric engineering and control engineering as essentially Navy at that time was one of the only organisations in the country with knowledge in this area and our people were in high demand for places like Glenbrook and the oil plants in Taranaki etc. They were leaving in droves and at one point the Admiral had to don no1's (sword and medals) and go up to Parliament and say – any more loss and we tie up another frigate! We were seen as the training establishment and I remember a meeting we had with Bill Birch at the time when these factors were discussed.\nMy attendance at the CECM above was in relation to the funding for the then new Resource Protection Vessel ( To be HMNZS Endeavour) which was also under consideration, as was the price of wheat. It was not wrong to say that at that time the country was run from the PM's desk.\n-\n\"It was not wrong to say that at that time the country was run from the PM's desk.\"\nWe didn't have a democratically elected government. We had a malevolent dictator who was known to direct his lackeys to act unlawfully on his behalf.\n-\nI was being diplomatic 😉\n-\nDiplomacy is not by strong point. 🙁\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAha. So..you say. And your point?\n-\n-\n-\nRail is needed when you need to move bulky, heavy, cheap goods around.\nSo if your economy declines in its need for that kind of transport, you need rail less and less.\nSome of the big components for the Motonui, Maui and Kapuni gas and petroleum stations came through by rail in the 1970s and 1980s.\nBut then they stopped.\nWhen the Patea freezing works closed in 1992 and Waitara freezing works closed in 1997, rail use declined further.\nMostly the left are stuck with nostalgia over rail because it used to employ tens of thousands of working class guys particularly Maori.\nWith domestic coal use dying by policy direction, soon there will be very little use for the rail line to Westport, or the Nightcaps-Ohai line to Invercargill. Rail north of Whangarei is almost unused.\nLet it go.\nI'd venture that the Otago Rail Trail makes more money in cycling and tourism than the actual rail ever did.\nRip up the regional tracks, shift away from bulk cheap exports, and do something smarter.\n-\nMostly the left are stuck with nostalgia over rail because it used to employ tens of thousands of working class guys particularly Maori.\nFuck..just bullshit. Read my links. Or not\n-\nYou just tried to compare Taranaki's rail line with something in Australia.\nYou need to keep up with reality.\nKiwirial have already invested in hybrid trains, but they did so for the 'golden triangle\" of Auckland-Tauranga-Hamilton and the main trunk line which has the demand for it.\nhttps://www.greaterauckland.org.nz/2023/05/11/its-time-to-shine-a-light-on-golden-triangle-rail/\nThe rest is just sickly left nostalgia.\n-\nYou just tried to compare Taranaki's rail line with something in Australia.\nHuh? And..IMO you change your opinion from day..to day.\n(on this and others)\nFor reasons known only to you.\nAnyway…I'll try not to engage with you again….\n-\nWhen the facts change, you ought to change.\n-\n-\n\"Kiwirial have already invested in hybrid trains, but they did so for the 'golden triangle\" of Auckland-Tauranga-Hamilton…\"\nTry reading the article before you link.\nA month ago the govt announced it will provide future funding to enable hybrid trains for the lower North Island, (Wairarapa & Manawatu).\nNothing to do with Auckland-Tauranga-Hamilton, and nothing to do with Kiwirail. They merely own the tracks, the trains will be part of the Regional Council owned commuter service.\n-\n-\n-\nHopefully they are going to sort out the rail from North Port to Auckland and we will get a fully functional rail and freight service running from Whangarei Port to Auckland.\n-\nThere is no rail line to NorthPort.\nThere's no capital available for the Whangarei-NorthPort line, which is what would start to make rail Auckland to Northland viable.\nThey've done the Designation but it's more than a decade away in reality.\n-\n-\n-\nWhen did rail ever do anything for climate change?\nHas any civil defence plan ever relied on rail? Nope.\nIs even commuter rail performing in Wellington or Auckland? Nope.\nRegional rail is the dumb economy. And regional rail is the dumb society.\n-\n-\nWeka you need facts not mere emotions.\nLast time we had a civil emergency was … Gabrielle about 8 weeks ago. And rail didn't come to our rescue. The armed forces did, together with FENZ, Police, Treasury, local civil defence, and other agencies.\nCommuter rail in Auckland may well recover in a few years. Urban rail is still possible to support with more investment then. But it's nearly bankrupted Auckland Council.\nAsk yourself what are the industries regional rail supports. Name them. Name the kinds of workers and towns you'd need for that. Name their average wage. Their educational attainment. It looks remarkably like New Zealand of the 1930s.\n-\n-\nWhat part of climate change will regional rail solve?\nWhat do you believe regional rail actually does?\n-\n-\n-\n-\nI believe after Bola & a couple of other times, but I'll to unpack a couple of boxes without the wife looking/ or knowing to confirm this.\n-\nAre they the ones who have already told her you have got rid of? if so I can understand your caution.\n-\n-\nAd, tell that to the Aussies who live in suburbs or satellite towns who Drive-Park then Ride on a train to their work.\n-\n-\n-\nIt's the bulk product s that are leaving the new Plymouth line due to it being cheaper to truck it,\nSo we either have to subsidize rail ,more, or charge higher rd users on trucks! Both will have knock effects upstream and down.\n-\nWe don't have to do either.\nWe have let most of our regional rail die including the Catlins Line, Otago inland line, Canterbury inland lines, the Blackball line, the Greymouth line, the Nelson line, the Dargaville line, the Otira line, the Paeroa line, the Waihi line, the Thames line, the Rotorua line, and dozens more …\n… and guess what we are more efficient, more responsive, stronger and more adaptable as a country than we have ever been.\nGo right ahead and invest more to Tauranga, Auckland and Hamilton where the freight and most of the passengers are and will be.\nStop wasting time and taxpayer money on regional rail.\n-\n\"Stop wasting time and taxpayer money on regional rail.\nWhat about in 30 years and nzs approaching 15 million people, the region s will soak alot ofvthat up, .\nSurely it's cheaper to maintain then now for future need than to let them go to ruin,\n-\nFor the main trunk line and the golden triangle I'd agree.\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nSo what's it like inside the Green Party at the moment?\nMaybe it's time to stop claiming there's nothing wrong as Incognito did two weeks ago.\nOutside the non-reality of the RoyMorgan poll, this is what a competitive non-mainstream party looks like, and it ain't the Green Party:\nhttps://www.act.org.nz/a_time_for_truth_offers_real_change\n-\nACT are a worry, though much of their vote is Luxon generated.\nThe Greens are concentrating on Climate Change, the Environment and Inequality at this election now the gender/woke obsessed fanatics* have been put in their place.\nThese three issues will attract many votes, especially given Labour's shift to the centre under Hipkins.\nI'm predicting Greens 11% this election.\n*gender should be a cross-party issue\n-\n-\nAgreed Weka.\nI can see TMP getting at least 3% because its leaders seem adept at keeping a high profile.\n-\n-\n-\n\"Lived experience\"? – as in \"my lived experience – which is what I say and most of which I make up, outweighs your biological reality every time\"?\nYet another reason to avoid the Green Party!\n-\n-\nFirst Armenian leader to attend the inauguration of a Turkish leader.\nPreisdent of Azerbaijan Aliyev and Prime Minister of Armenia Pashinyan at the inauguration of the Turkish President Erdogan. Substantial changes taking place in the South Caucasus\nhttps://twitter.com/revishvilig/status/1665091282404777990\n-\nErdogan is leader of the AKP (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi).\nThis has warmed my heart. A group of Turkish journalists, from pro-AKP nationalists background, encouraging Armenian leader Pashinyan’s peace initiatives. “Do not think of yourself alone”\nhttps://twitter.com/asliaydintasbas/status/1665070815056998403\n-\nErdogan's newly appointed Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.\nHe was involved in secret peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) for which in 2012 a state prosecutor wanted to investigate him.[13] Recep Tayyip Erdoğan intervened on behalf of Fidan[13] and he was later delegated to hold talks with Abdullah Öcalan and arranged the secret black marketing of Iran through Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's government.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakan_Fidan\n-\n-\n-\nLotsa shenanigans in the Russian border region. A town of 40,000 is being bombed by separatists, people have been evacuated and there are reports of widespread looting by locals and Russian forces. And it was supposed to be a wee imperialist venture where only Ukrainians would die, only Ukrainian children would be terrorised, and only Ukrainians would have their homes and communities destroyed.\nShame, really.\n/\n-\nAccording to an article the Weekend Herald the attack was carried out by Russian dissidents.\n-\nAnd some reports say Russian armed forces evacuated Shebekino prior to their own attempt to level the city. Other reports say Russian\nseparatistsdissidents are planning a referendum on the future of Belgorod.But hey, Russian infighting has legs so well played, Ukraine.\n-\nlol\nRussian dissidents\nA bit like calling the mosque murderer (who told his mother he'd like to move permanently to Ukraine) an Australian dissident\nHe told his mother he would not renew the lease on his flat and wanted to sell his belongings and move to Ukraine. It was the last time they saw him before the attack.\n-\nKyiv backed Belgorod separatists, then. But surely Russia could just give up Belgorod. For peace.\n-\nI've a feeling that demilitarizing a sizable border zone will be Ukraine's only way to conclude the war – at least while Putin avoids defenestration.\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nACT wants the Education portfolio.\n”What does it want?\nIt’s testament to ACT’s confidence that Seymour sees one of his caucus as education minister. This is potentially a fish hook for Luxon who also sees the portfolio as a priority.\nACT wants enormous reform – and that goes far beyond the return and expansion of charter schools (which Luxon has already committed to).\nSchool funding would depend on digital quarterly reporting, especially of attendance (importantly, income wouldn’t be dependent on the results, but the frequency of reporting.)\nThis does seem rather bureaucratic for an anti-bureaucracy party – but underlines the importance they attach to chronic truancy.”\nWow, interesting times head. And not in a good way.\nIt’s about time the media started investigating ACT policy.\n-\nPreviously Act's big education thing (bedsides charter schools) was 'voucher' education.\nI haven't seen any mention about that or that their other great driver, parental choice, will mean school zoning is done away with.\nPrinciple seems to go down the tubes with Seymour when electoral reality kicks in. You want parental choice? Yes. If that affects the values of your constituents' houses? No.\n-\n-\nWhat could have been.\n4/6/1989\n-\n- Take New Zealand from five tax rates on income down to two. It reduces the incentive for tax avoidance and sends a message that if you work hard and do well, you get to keep more of your own money\n- Reduce the number of public servants and remove whole departments that add no value for the public\n- Invest in safer communities by increasing the number of prison beds so dangerous criminals can be kept off the streets\n- Provide the ability to lock up serious youth offenders with the construction of 200 new youth justice beds under the management of the Department of Corrections\n- Increase capitation rates for GP practices, ensuring New Zealanders can get an appointment with their GP when they need one\n- Pay good teachers more and pay the best teachers a lot more with the Teaching Excellence Reward Fund\n- Protect New Zealand and its allies by increasing defence spending to match Australia’s at 2% of GDP\n- Share over a billion dollars a year with councils for infrastructure through GST-sharing, but only if they say ‘yes’ to building more homes.\nhttps://www.act.org.nz/time-for-truth\nThe tax is 17.5 cents to $70,000 and 28 cents over that level.\nMore spending, and huge reductions in tax revenue. It would result in an immediate downgrade in our credit rating.\nOf course the policy is not serious, because they are not proposing it as policy to be applied by any government. One wonders it they will even have it costed by any reputable body.\n- Comments are now closed",
