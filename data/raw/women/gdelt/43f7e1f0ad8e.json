  "body_text": "On a day of mixed emotions for the entire football club and its fanbase, Chelsea Women did what it always has done against Aston Villa, find the back of the net. Well, not just once, many, many times. It was the perfect time to play the west Midlands outfit, and the west Londoners took full advantage.\nIt was almost like witnessing an older cousin respectful putting his younger counterpart in their place. The two aren’t quite brothers, but the mutual respect is very much there. That’s basically what the Blues did at the Bescot Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Ruthless, but classy. That is how this club has done it under Emma Hayes.\nEven with Guro Reiten and Lauren James, the west Londoners found six different players to finish off a chance in the final third. It was the definition of a goal-scoring party. Everyone was invited. Even those who didn’t score, their participation was evident to the naked eye.\nRelentless attacking prowess right out of the international break. That’s really what it was. For the second straight game, Hayes’ team amassed over 25 shots with more than 12 of them forcing the goalkeepers’ attention. Fran Kirby provided the warning sign. Millie Bright started the party.\nCarla Ward and Villa, still pointless had absolutely no answers for a club flying at the top of the table. Credit to the west London outfit for creating the opportunities, but it has to be said how poor the Villains defense was all afternoon long. Whether it was costly turnovers in the midfield or a failure to clear the ball away from danger on crosses, Ward’s defense, for the most part acted as bystanders. On both ends of the pitch, you can just see how much this team misses French midfielder Kenza Dali conducting play.\nHayes shook up a few things up in the lineup. The Englishwomen kept Ann-Katrin Berger between the sticks while making four changes from the lineup that started against Brighton and Hove Albion before the break. Jessie Fleming, Johanna Rytting Kaneryd, and Erin Cuthbert came into the midfield while American Mia Fishel took Sam Kerr’s place up top as she was given a well-earned rest.\nThough there were far more than just three on the day, here are three of the standouts from a match in the midst of a day that will go down in Chelsea history.",
