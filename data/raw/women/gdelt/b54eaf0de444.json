  "body_text": "Friday’s Everton News: Calvert-Lewin status, Dele latest, Dyche comments\nRecapping all the Everton news from yesterday\nYour daily dose of Everton news and rumours\nSean Dyche has revealed that Dominic Calvert-Lewin missed training yesterday, which makes it likely that the 26-year-old will miss out on tomorrow’s match against Chelsea. [EFC]\n“Chelsea have some very good players, strong players. It’s another tough away game, they all are in the Premier League. Home or away, we have got to be ready. We have shown a mentality that we can be ready for that, and when the whistle blows, we have got to be ready to deliver. That’s the key focus for me,” says Sean Dyche. [EFC]\nHear more from the manager below.\nEverton Women defender Katrine Veje previews her side’s Merseyside Derby next Friday. [EFC]\nJordan Pickford named to England squad for upcoming Euro Qualifiers, while Conor Coady misses out after being benched for the last three games for the Blues.\nSeamus Coleman has also received the call for Ireland.\n“I am sure I’ll speak to the staff. I can’t really say. It’s a bit too early, but we’ll just have to wait and see. The boys are boss, honestly. I have just fitted straight in, from the first day. There are no bad eggs or anything like that. All the lads are well-knitted and for me to just come straight in and get on with them, is great for me. I have learnt a lot since I’ve been here and there are a couple of months to go still,” says in-form Everton loanee Tom Cannon on a potential return to Preston North End next season. [LancsLive]\nFollowing a poor run with Besiktas, Everton are reportedly considering terminating Dele Alli’s contract once his loan has finished. [Football Insider]\nUp the Ballin’ Blues!\n“He [Garner] is still learning about the Premier League. I think he has maybe eight appearances in the Premier League so he still has a lot to learn. He is a new player to it...he’s got a good engine and running strength, he can strike a very good ball and he is calm in possession and he will cover the yards. Getting to that true sharpness is the next step but his knowledge of the Premier League is limited just by the fact he has played a lot in the Championship. The Premier League is different. But I saw a lot of him at Forest and I think he is a very good player and I think that now that he is fit again and hopefully stays fit he will continue to sharpen through the training we put on and the day-to-day work that we do,” says Dyche. [Echo]\nWhat to Watch\nBlues will be looking for a helping hand from Newcastle United in their match against Nottingham Forest today. There’s plenty of other action on from around the globe, too.\nFull schedule of games here.",
