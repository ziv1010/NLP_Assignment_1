  "body_text": "For the Brazil national team, the first friendly after a World Cup is usually a bonfire of the idols.\nBrazil either win World Cups or they lose them; when it’s the latter, the public bloodlust has to be sated. The manager normally goes. A few of his trusted players are culled, plus anyone who performed particularly badly in whichever knockout-stage psychodrama sent the nation into its latest period of mourning.\nAdvertisement\nYou won’t hear Scottish indie in many Rio de Janeiro nightclubs, but in these moments Brazil subscribes to the Orange Juice imperative. Forget the niceties. Rip it up and start again.\nAfter South Africa 2010, Mano Menezes dumped a host of experienced stars, including Lucio, Juan, Gilberto Silva and Kaka. Four years later, Dunga began his ill-fated second stint in charge by dropping Julio Cesar, Thiago Silva, Daniel Alves, Marcelo, Paulinho and Fred, all of whom had been key men under Luiz Felipe Scolari.\nEven Tite, who escaped the guillotine himself after Brazil’s quarter-final exit in 2018, was uncharacteristically ruthless. Five of the 11 players who started against Belgium in Russia were sat at home when Brazil faced the USA two months later.\nThis year’s renovation job has arguably been even more severe.\nAlisson, perhaps the best goalkeeper in the world? Gone. Danilo, Alex Sandro, Raphinha, all part of Tite’s first-choice XI in Qatar? Gone, gone, gone. So too are Fred, Fabinho, Bruno Guimaraes, Everton Ribeiro, Gabriel Martinelli and Pedro.\nThrow in a handful of injury absences — Neymar, Thiago Silva, Marquinhos, Richarlison — and you are left with the most curious, experimental-looking Brazil squad for at least a decade.\nThe list includes only three players with more than 20 caps (Casemiro, Lucas Paqueta, Eder Militao), and they are joined by no fewer than 10 potential debutants. Morocco, Brazil’s opponents on Saturday, must have spent much of the last fortnight on Google.\nA couple of the uncapped players might be vaguely familiar to followers of the Premier League. Joao Gomes, a combative central midfielder, has made a handful of appearances for Wolves since arriving from Flamengo in January. Chelsea fans have yet to see Andrey Santos in action — he has returned to Vasco da Gama on loan — but he is seen as a future star. The early indications are that he will partner Casemiro in midfield against Morocco.\nAdvertisement\nThe remaining new faces can be split into two broad groups. The first is made up of proven performers in Brazilian domestic football. Yuri Alberto is a pure finisher who came through the Santos youth ranks with Real Madrid’s Rodrygo. Raphael Veiga, a silky playmaker and penalty expert, and whippet-like forward Rony have both been rewarded for their part in the recent success of Palmeiras.\nThen there are the youngsters, most of whom — like Andrey — helped Brazil to win the Under-20 South American Championship earlier this year. The most interesting among them are Robert Renan, an elegant centre-back who used to play as a No 10, and forward Vitor Roque, whose explosive displays for Athletico Paranaense have reportedly caught the attention of Barcelona.\nVitor Roque and Andrey are only 18. Robert Renan is 19, as is promising goalkeeper Mycael. Arthur, the America Mineiro right-back, and Fluminense midfielder Andre are 20 and 21 respectively. It is an astonishing pivot to youth.\nOr at least it is until you meet the man who will be in the away dugout at the Ibn Batouta Stadium. Brazil, who have yet to appoint a permanent replacement for Tite, will be led by Ramon Menezes, the coach of the under-20 side.\nHis squad selection raised a few eyebrows. Rony and Veiga, who both turn 28 soon, look like crowd-pleasing choices. Guimaraes and Martinelli — both of whom have been superb in the Premier League but barely featured at the World Cup — deserve more game time.\nThe decision to include the youngsters he knows best looks understandable, however, particularly in the absence of any overarching project.\n“He is not preparing for the ground for a successor who has already been chosen,” wrote Globo columnist Carlos Eduardo Mansur. “The game represents little in terms of team construction, but it can be a useful experience for the young players. The logic behind the selection is healthy.”\nAdvertisement\nIf there is any forward planning here, it is in service of the Under-20 World Cup, which takes place in May and June. The senior team will not play again until September, when qualifying for World Cup 2026 begins. The hope is that the current state of flux — “Ramon is a caretaker for nobody, managing a team in limbo,” is how Mansur put it — will be resolved by then.\nEdnaldo Rodrigues, the president of Brazil’s football federation, is due to be in Europe next month, initially to watch the Women’s Finalissima against European champions England at Wembley, then to sound out candidates for the men’s job. Rodrigues has not named names — he has only said that his preferred options are all currently employed — but the shortlist is believed to be headed by Carlo Ancelotti, followed by Jose Mourinho, Jorge Jesus and Fluminense coach Fernando Diniz.\nOn the surface, little has changed since Tite walked away in January. Yet there is growing confidence that Ancelotti can be convinced to take his first national-team job at the end of Real Madrid’s season. The players, according to Ederson, have been talking about the possibility for some time. Rodrygo revealed this week that Ancelotti himself often jokes about the rumours with the Brazilian players at Real.\nIt would be a fine appointment, and not just because Ancelotti is an elite coach. It is also a question of personality: the Italian is affable and laid-back, unlikely to rock the boat. The same cannot be said of Mourinho and Jesus, both of whom could make a mortal enemy in an empty room. Given that the mere act of turning to a foreign manager comes with a degree of culture shock baked in, it makes sense to choose someone who won’t exacerbate it.\nWhoever comes in faces an interesting task. On the one hand, reaching the World Cup looks more inevitable than ever: the expansion of the tournament means six of the 10 South American countries will qualify directly, with a seventh heading to the intercontinental play-offs. Brazil would have to try incredibly hard to fail, so there is plenty of scope for experimentation.\nOn the other, there are a cluster of nagging questions that need answering. Are we nearing the final knockings of the Neymar era? If so, is it time to make Vinicius Junior the talisman of the team? Can any of Brazil’s other talented attackers — Rodrygo, Raphinha, Martinelli, Antony, Gabriel Jesus — really kick on and make themselves essential? How is the defence going to cope when Thiago Silva calls it a day? And is the Brazilian full-back factory going to reopen in time for 2026?\nWith all that to think about, it’s safe to assume that the new coach won’t spend much time fretting about the Morocco match. Nonetheless, it is a golden opportunity for one or two of those under-20 players to announce themselves. A Brazil game is a Brazil game, weird squad or not.\nTake it away, kids.\n(Top photo: Juan Pablo Pino/AFP via Getty Images)",
