  "body_text": "EXCLUSIVE: Gemma Atkinson reveals true reason she won't return to TV soaps after Emmerdale exit\nGemma Atkinson has opened up about her decision to walk away from soaps due to the timings being 'unrealistic' but admits she can see herself in a one off drama\nActress Gemma Atkinson has ruled out a return to her soap roots. The TV star found fame playing Lisa Hunter in Channel 4's Hollyoaks between 2001 and 2005, making a brief return just three years ago. But, after appearing in the likes of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, The Bill and Waterloo Road, Gemma, 40, found herself swapping the North West for West Yorkshire, landing the role of Carly Hope on ITV's Emmerdale.\nEight years after, she departed her role and now Gemma has exclusively opened up to the Mirror about why she's ruled out returning to any soaps in the near future. \"I would love to go back to acting again, 100%, I would love to do a one off drama where there was a start date and an end date, so I could plan childcare around it,\" Gemma said.\nThe actress, who this year is a celebrity supporter for Soccer Aid for UNICEF, went on to add: \"My partner Gorka [Marquez], he starts Strictly Come Dancing from July, so from July to Christmas, he's kind of wherever his partner is based, if he has a partner. So it's kind of all up in the air. So to go back to a soap wouldn't really be realistic because the hours are so few and far between, you're either in 12 hours a day or you're in two hours a day, your schedule can change at the drop of a hat.\n\"I loved my time on all the soaps, its where I am now because of them but I think, now that I've got the children, I just wouldn't be able to commit unfortunately. But I do still watch it [Emmerdale] and I don't want Marlon to be killed off, I want Mark to stay in.\" This year, while Gemma is supporting England – with the likes of Louis Tomlinson, Jill Scott, Tom Grennan, Steph Houghton, Toni Duggan and Sam Thompson playing – her fiancée, Gorka Marquez, is playing for World XI.\n\"There will definitely be a rivalry between me and Gorka,\" she laughed, before adding: \"He's still rubbing it in about the Spanish game in the Summer. So yeah, he will still be rubbing it in but I'm going to put the kids in England shirts, he's outnumbered.\" Having names including Jill and Toni on the team was a huge bonus for Gemma.\nThe star who is mum to daughter Mia, six and son Thiago, one, couldn't be more thrilled that the Lionesses and women's football is finally being recognised. Speaking at Manchester's Hotel Football, she said: \"I think it's great that women's football is finally coming centre stage. My daughter plays football at school.\n\"We never played football, it just wasn't a thing when I was at school, we played rugby but it was tag rugby – we weren't allowed to wrestle, we had to have a little tag on that you pulled off, that in itself is just 'Why? Why can't we do it properly?' The fact that we can now, Mia is five and she asked for a football for Christmas last year, so she got one off Father Christmas, so that's being flung around the house at any opportunity, which is marvellous but I'm trying to support and encourage. So yeah, who knows, she might be a future Lioness herself.\"\nGemma, who presents The Overshare podcast admitted it was an \"honour to be involved\" with Soccer Aid, which is taking place at Old Trafford this June. \"It's on my doorstep, Manchester, there's a positivity in the air,\" she said. Adding: \"There's going to be some lighthearted rivalry on the day.\" Reflecting on the day, she commented: \"It's going to be amazing, I don't care about the weather, even if its raining people will show up.\"\nBut why did she decide to join and support? Gemma said: \"As a mum myself, you realise the impact it can have. The thought of my kids needing any help or support from charities is heartbreaking. You just want to provide everything for them. The fact that we've raised over £100 million for children worldwide is just incredible.\"\n\"£20, £10 a ticket, you think 'That's not a lot, lets go,'\" Gemma said, adding: \"To the people who are receiving it. It is unbelievable the differences you can make to a child's life. Hopefully one day we've got like people like Jill Scott playing the Lionesses or little girls watching. You can think, I can do that. And with the right support and you know, the resources they can do and that's why we're here to help.\"\nThe match takes place on Sunday 15th of June at Old Trafford, Manchester, with adult tickets priced at £10 and juniors from £10. Tickets are available now on the Soccer Aid for UNICEF website.\nLike this story?
