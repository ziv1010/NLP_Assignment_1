  "body_text": "Last summer, Nottingham Forest set a precedent — and, along with it, expectations.\nEveryone knows the numbers involved by now. They are likely to follow Forest around for a few years yet: a flurry of 22 new additions were followed by another seven in January.\nForest will forever be known as the club that made 29 signings in one season. Even the fans embraced it with their now trademark “Waka, waka” chant, the main thrust of which is “30 signings, who gives a f***? Forest are staying up”. (The number was only 30 if you include Adnan Kanuric, a young keeper who was always intended to be a Premier League 2 player rather than a member of the first-team squad.)\nAdvertisement\nNow, a few weeks later, many curious eyes remain cast on the City Ground to see what this transfer window might hold.\nAnd there is a perception things have been a little… quiet. Why has the club that signs players for fun not had any fun so far this summer?\nWhat may have been forgotten amid the past 12 months of drama is that, by this stage of the summer of 2022, Forest only had three new additions: Taiwo Awoniyi, Giulian Biancone and Moussa Niakhate.\nNobody is suggesting this is the calm before another storm; that Forest are about to launch into another frenzy of transfer activity. They are not.\nForest did what they needed to do this time last year. They assembled a squad with enough strength in depth to preserve their Premier League status. This time around, the situation is very different and the club’s approach in the transfer market will be as well.\nGO DEEPER\nA season like no other: Inside Nottingham Forest's Premier League survival\nThe focus will be on delivering five or six quality additions while moving out a larger number of players. More of that later.\nBut, in the meantime, the lack of new arrivals should not be mistaken for a lack of activity. There have been numerous new arrivals in recent months, starting with Ross Wilson, who was hired in late April as chief football officer. He has been a busy man, appointing his former Rangers colleague, Craig Mulholland, as head of football development and talent management.\nThe restructure also saw consultant Lee Charnley leave, which came as a surprise, with some at the club expecting that he would be offered something similar to a chief executive role.\nA restructuring of the academy setup is well underway, with a decade-long era under Gary Brazil having come to an end. His role will be taken over by a combination of Wilson, Mulholland and Chris McGuane, the former assistant academy manager, who will be promoted as part of the shake-up. Warren Joyce, who has inspired a flurry of success with the under-18s and under-21s, has agreed a new contract and will remain an integral figure.\nNumerous jobs have been advertised at the club, ranging from chauffeur roles to several within the media department, which is set to be bolstered again following survival.\nAdvertisement\nVarious new roles have been filled in the academy setup, along with internal promotions such as Ed Henderson becoming the head of football business and operations.\nOn Monday, an all-staff meeting was held in the Robin Hood suite at the City Ground for Mulholland to outline the plans he and Wilson have for the academy and the women’s teams. The club intend to expand and improve their academy, while also further integrating the women’s team.\nIn an email inviting staff to hear their vision, Mulholland talked about how important it was that “cohesion, alignment and communication is strong”. Wilson has spoken to the players and coaches and the initial impression is favourable. There is talk of him “reviving” the club from an infrastructure point of view.\nAmber Wildgust — who has previously worked at Aston Villa, Watford and, most recently, at London City Lionesses as director of football – has been appointed as women and girls manager.\nA new kit supplier has been secured, with Adidas a popular choice among fans given its links to the glory days under Brian Clough.\nThe club have more than one option over a potential new front-of-shirt sponsor and are understood to have been negotiating with Ideagen about a sleeve-sponsorship agreement.\nWilson has been quick to forge a strong working relationship with head coach Steve Cooper, who might previously have been disappointed to see one of his allies — in Filippo Giraldi — exit.\nWilson will be a key figure in the next round of recruitment this summer. Dean Henderson remains a primary target and the former England goalkeeper is keen to return to the City Ground. But progress over a move to sign him permanently has been stalled while United work to resolve their own goalkeeper situation.\nDavid de Gea is now a free agent after seeing protracted contract talks come to nothing, while United continue to work on a move for Inter Milan’s Andre Onana, with Henderson left in limbo in the meantime. Ethan Horvath has returned to Forest and has been involved in first-team training after Luton opted not to take up the option to sign him permanently following his loan spell, which saw him play a part in their promotion push from the Championship.\nAdvertisement\nManchester City’s Carlos Borges also features on Forest’s list, though no talks between the two clubs are currently active. Borges won the Premier League 2 player of the season award after scoring 21 goals in 24 appearances for City at that level as they won a third consecutive title. The Portugal Under-19 international is valued in the region of £10million ($12.7m) and can play as a wide forward, a winger or an orthodox forward.\nForest owner Evangelos Marinakis is a big fan of the manner in which Brighton operate: seeking to sign young players with vast potential who can make an immediate impact on the Forest first team and who will only increase in value when they do.\nThe £17million Forest spent to sign Danilo from Palmeiras in January already looks to be tremendous value, with the Brazilian adding to a clutch of young talent that also includes Morgan Gibbs-White and Brennan Johnson.\nHowever, there is also financial fair play (FFP) to consider. Forest will be permitted losses of £83million over three years by the end of this coming campaign given that one of the years under assessment would be their final season in the Championship. In 2021-22, they were permitted losses of £13m, which rose to £35m per season once they made the step up to the Premier League.\nIt is that which would make Forest consider selling Johnson — but only if somebody comes up with an offer that matches their valuation, which is in excess of £50million. Brentford have already seen a tentative offer of £30million rejected but Aston Villa, fresh from qualifying for Europe, are also interested. That is a genuine concern.\nThere have been protracted sagas over Johnson’s future during the past two seasons and that theme is likely to be maintained. Selling Johnson would have more of an impact on Forest’s finances given his status as an academy product means any sale would represent pure profit — significant when it comes to how FFP losses are assessed.\nAnd while Forest are not actively seeking to usher him out of the exit, there is a long list of players who the club will definitely want to move on.\nAdvertisement\nJonjo Shelvey did not feature again after reacting poorly to being left out of the starting line-up at Liverpool in April and Forest would be willing to allow the midfielder to leave only a few months after his arrival from Newcastle. A question mark also hangs over forward Chris Wood. His season was ended by a bad thigh injury but the New Zealand international will need to have a strong pre-season to overcome a poor first impression.\nForest were committed to making Wood’s initial loan move permanent for £15million after he had made three Premier League appearances and he is now under contract until the summer of 2024. Shelvey’s deal runs until 2025. Between them, they earn in excess of £170,000 a week, which is an obvious problem.\nEmmanuel Dennis has not made the same impact at Forest as he did at Watford and the club are willing to entertain serious offers for him. Josh Bowler and Hwang Ui-jo are both likely to go without playing a first-team game for the club.\nThe squad needs to be trimmed in other ways, too. Harry Arter and Steve Cook are both surplus to requirements but remain under contract for another season.\nImportantly, Johnson, Danilo and Neco Williams are all now 22 and would need to be included in Forest’s 25-man senior squad having previously qualified as under-age players.\nSome big decisions will again have to be made by head coach Cooper as he looks to put together that squad, a situation we will analyse in a further piece in The Athletic in the coming days. That adds to the challenges, which will also include potentially finding room for Lewis O’Brien when he returns from his MLS loan spell at D.C. United.\nThere are numerous reasons why there cannot be a continuation of the ambitious but also at times scattergun approach to recruitment that has characterised the past year.\nAdvertisement\nReports from Nigeria have repeatedly linked Kelechi Iheanacho to the club. However, The Athletic’s understanding is that, while the Leicester City striker is one of countless players offered to Forest, suggestions a deal has been agreed are off the mark.\nForest will still have money to use and their ambition will not be scaled back along with their spending; the desire is to establish the club in the top flight for the long-term.\nBut, to achieve that, they will have to have a more structured, considered approach behind the scenes — something Wilson is already working to put in place.\n(Top photos: Getty Images)",
