  "body_text": "Things could be all set to change at Arsenal next season, after it was revealed that a triple Champions League winner would be joining the club on a free transfer from Barcelona.\nFor many years now, Mariona Caldentey has been a mainstay of the all-conquering Barcelona Women’s team.\nLast season the Catalan outfit managed to record an unprecedented quadruple, seeing off bogey side, Lyon, in the final of the Women’s Champions League in front of a capacity crowd at Athletic Club’s San Mames stadium.\nAfter a decade at the club, Caldentey has clearly decided it’s time for a change, and Sky Sports note that she’ll move to the North London giants for free this summer.\nIt’s believed that she will replace Arsenal’s brilliant servant, Viv Miedema, and with 114 goals in 302 games, Caldentey will surely quickly prove to be an asset for the Women’s Super League outfit.\nArsenal will benefit from Mariona Caldentey’s experience\nBarcelona are likely to find it difficult to find someone with her output and talent to replace her, and Caldentey’s decision could be the start of the break up of one of the greatest women’s football teams in history.\nThis past season they enjoyed another unbeaten campaign, winning 27 of their 28 games, scoring 129 goals and letting in just nine.\nSince the 2019/20 season, they’ve lost just two matches, and in 2021/22, they won all 30 of their matches, scoring 159 goals in the process.\nCaldentey will have to get used to not being able to saunter through matches, however, her experience will surely be of value to an Arsenal side that will be looking to overhaul Chelsea, particularly now that Emma Hayes has moved on to managing the US Women’s team.",
