Hedgesville was like Musselman, grades 7-12, with 300 students in the entire school and no girls sports.\nShe attended Shepherd College from 1966 to 1969, married Jerry Horner, December 1968, and moved to Naples, Italy, until 1970. She returned to Shepherd College and graduated December of 1972 with a degree in Health, Physical Education and Library Science. Throughout her entire formal education there were never any sports for girls/women in Berkeley County or at Shepherd College. Title IX had just been passed into law June 23, 1972 and thanks to the efforts and persistence of Carol Kamensky, womens’ sports were beginning in Berkeley County.\nIn December of 1972, she and Jerry moved to South Berkeley County where they have lived for 52 years. In the fall of 1974, Jerry was teaching and coaching at Musselman High School and Susanne became involved with the football program as a coach’s wife. In 1973, she was teaching Health and Physical Education and was the cheerleading coach at Hedgesville High School which made for an interesting life at work and home. At the beginning of 1975, she was a stay at home mom until 1983, before returning to substituting and was the cheerleading coach at Musselman High School. On the first day of school in 1983, she received a call that they needed a Library/Media Specialist at Hedgesville High School. She took the job and again was split between the two schools. Through all of this, she became active in the Football Boosters, putting together discount cards, ham sandwich sales, shirt designs and sales, many spirit items, Bonanzas and helping with anything that the Boosters were doing.\nIn the 1990’s, Susanne became an assistant track coach at Musselman and after retiring from coaching track in 1997, she became a WVSSAC track official, officiating local track meets and the State Track Meet in Charleston, WV. At the 1995 State Championship Football game at Wheeling Island Stadium, she was initiated into the job of taking pictures on the sidelines for Musselman football, a job that was thoroughly enjoyed and continued for many years. During the Championship game, Musselman was getting ready to kick a field goal to win the game, she remembers turning to Dee Price on the sideline with her and said “Is he able to kick a field goal that far?” and Dee said “Well, we’ll see”. Kelvin Jones kicked the field goal and Musselman won the game. After each game she had the pictures taken, developed and Coach Price used the pictures for the highlight tapes at the end of the year and then the pictures were given to the players. Susanne loved every minute of taking the pictures and providing them to the players.\nShe is an active member of Arden United Methodist Church. Susanne is a member of Shenandoah Valley Chapter, National Society Daughters of the American Revolution, Camp Frame Board of Directors, West Virginia 4-H All Stars, Arden –Tabler CEOS (Homemakers), active with Berkeley County 4-H, was named a Musselman High School Pillar of the Community, the coordinator for the Wreaths Across America with Arden United Methodist Church cemetery and the John Augustine Washington Society, Children of the American Revolution and a volunteer with several additional Mountain State Apple Harvest activities and a member of the Hedgesville High School Alumni Association. She and Jerry were named Outstanding Citizens of the Community for the South Berkeley Community Christmas Parade, an honor that each cherish.\nBelow is a quote by Susanne resonating the values we share as Applemen:\n“We are the parents of three Musselman High School graduates, Andrew 1993, Mark 1995, and Laura 1996. We also have six grandchildren, Bradley Meske, Chandler Meske, Hannah Horner Green, Drew Horner, Cole Horner and Cate Horner. I have been very fortunate to have good people around me on this journey and I thank them for their support and love.”\nDave Marchette\nDave, originally from Buffalo, NY, came to Musselman high school after graduation from Fairmont state University 1969 after earning his B.S. in Physical Education, Health & Recreation. He began as a teacher in the fall of 1969 under Mr. Waldeck, teaching geography, world history, shop, West Virginia history and was a class sponsor for the year of 1970-1971. He also directed a school play called “Where the Boys Are” in 1969-70.\nDave started the wrestling program that he led for two seasons. He was fortunate enough to win the first ever match vs Berkeley Springs while forfeiting 5 weight classes. Larry Carte followed Coach Marchette after those first two seasons. Dave was leaned on heavily in the development of and building of most of the equipment that filled the fieldhouse. He worked hand in hand with Coach Price, Bill Riggleman and many booster members to see that Musselman had a big advantage with this facility.\nHis contributions toward football include: assistant football coach for one year with Charlie Cline at the junior varsity level, assistant Track coach alongside Bob Kamensky for one year, was a video filmer from 16mm film to cassette style with Ronnie Lewis and Ron Funkhouser. He provided this service from the late 80’s- 1998. He took great pride in producing high quality game footage for varsity football games…not something that every school had. Dave mentioned a quote that represents his feelings about our community and school, “I enjoyed the overall comradery of the staff…It was amazing to be associated with these people.”\nCareer-wise, he worked in the first alternative school in Berkeley and the state, Super Bennett came after Dave to transform the program into what is now the county alternative school program. This career change occurred during the 1991-92 school year. He has been the director of this program and homebound to this date…some 35 years.\nDave’s passion lies in powerlifting. He began at local level, state level, US level and was selected for the world competition team – a group of 50 people from teenage to master’s level. He competed in the Bench category and claimed approximately 20 different competitions that he has claimed the champion level. He was the world record holder in 1996 for his age and weight class.

His first experience with football was limited, playing only one game however, a spark was lit.\nThe Fall of 1970 ushered in a new assistant coach, Rod Pittman, who saw promise in the undersized athlete. Head Coach Kervin Miller led Musselman Jr. High to the first undefeated season in school history. Jeff garnered enough playing time to earn his freshman “letter” as an 8th-grader. In his freshman season, the Jr. High Applemen finished with a 7-1 record. In two seasons, Jeff and his class of 75 teammates amassed an incredible record of 15 wins and just one loss. More impressive is that of those 15 wins, the Applemen had 10 shutouts, outscoring their opponents by a whopping 414-to-70-point margin. Jeff also participated in Jr. High track that school year and band.\nIn Jeff’s sophomore year, the Class of 1975 players dominated the roster and exposed them to three new coaches: Head Coach Bob Kaminsky and assistant coaches Jerry Horner and Denny Price. He earned his varsity letter that season, spending as much time as he could in the weight room.\nThe 1973 season saw Denny Price become Applemen’s head coach and Bill Riggleman join the coaching staff, becoming Jeff’s position coach. That year, Jeff played junior varsity basketball for Coach Price, agreeing to maintain his football weightlifting requirements with Coach Riggleman and play basketball. Jeff even lifted weights on basketball game days.\nIn 1974, the Applemen captured the Class A 1974 State Football Championship, the first Eastern Panhandle school to accomplish such a feat. Jeff was named to the All Bi-State Conference team as an Offensive Guard, Martinsburg Journal All-Area Team, Guard, and Defensive End, Honorable Mention All-State Guard, and recognized as an All-American in Coach & Athlete. However, Jeff’s most significant award was being named “Mr. Musselman, Jr.” by Mr. Musselman, Sr., Principal Kenneth Waldeck, “in recognition of his outstanding school spirit and dedication to Musselman High School.”\nAfter graduation, Jeff enlisted in the West Virginia Air National Guard, serving six years as a mechanic.
