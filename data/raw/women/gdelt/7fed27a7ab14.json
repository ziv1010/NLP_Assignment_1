FIFA did not run a traditional bidding contest for the 2025 edition -- instead appointing the United States to stage the 32-team event -- and has yet to outline how the 2029 host will be selected.\nCBF president Samir Xaud has framed the talks as ongoing, saying last year: 'It's a subject I discussed with president Infantino... God willing, Brazil will host the 2029 Club World Cup.'\nFor 2029, Brazil already has one club assured of a place in the tournament. Flamengo earned its spot by winning the 2025 Copa Libertadores title.\n--Field Level Media\nShares\nShare\nTweet\nShare\nFlip\nEmail\nGet a daily dose of Brazil Sun news through our daily email, its complimentary and keeps you fully up to date with world and business news as well.\nPublish news of your business, community or sports group, personnel appointments, major event and more by submitting a news release to Brazil Sun.\nMore Information(Photo credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images) Brazil formally has told FIFA it wants to host the 2029 Club World Cup, according...\nTehran warned it stands ready with its finger on the trigger to fend off any US or Israeli aggression ...\nWashington has redrawn its military priorities around power, not values Washington's...\nWhy Americas new foreign policy struggles to turn pressure into outcomes January 2026 marks a year since Donald Trump was sworn in...\nChinese leader Xi Jinpings decision to place the countrys top-ranking general under investigation raises deep questions for Chinas...\n(260126) -- MANILA, Jan. 26, 2026 (Xinhua) -- Camila Osorio (R) of Colombia shakes hands with Hosogi Sakura of Japan during the women's...\nNEW YORK, New York - U.S. stocks edged higher on Monday, but the dollar continued to be hammered, while gold shot up past $5,100 an...\nNEW DELHI, India: After two earlier requests were rejected by the Government of India, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: After years of regulatory pressure and legal uncertainty, TikTok has secured a path to remain operational in the...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: A high-profile legal fight has erupted between the White House and Wall Street, with U.S. President Donald Trump...\nSAN FRANCISCO, California: Google is offering users a deeper level of personalization in its search engine, allowing its artificial...\nSAN FRANCISCO, California: Amazon is preparing to deepen a significant restructuring of its white-collar workforce, with another wave...",
