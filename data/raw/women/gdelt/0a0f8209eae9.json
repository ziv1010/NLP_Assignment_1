Email tips@dailymail.com\nThis is the moment that Dutch police investigating the murder of a 17-year-old girl and sex attacks on two other women discovered a large knife tossed into a river outside an asylum seeker hostel.\nThe teenager, named Lisa, was cycling to her home in the suburbs in the early hours after a night out in Amsterdam when she realised she was being followed and called the police.\nBut by the time officers arrived Lisa was found lying dead in a ditch after being stabbed in the neck.\nThey soon arrested a suspect - an illegal unregistered migrant in his early 20s who was seized by a SWAT Team at a hostel for asylum seekers.\nAnd it was in the river that runs past the hostel in Amsterdam Zuidoost that a knife was today discovered having apparently been discarded in a river.\nClose search officers, who have been working with sniffer dogs, pulled out what appeared to be a large, silver kitchen knife and an e-bike from the water.\nIt remains unclear at present if either item is connected to Lisa's murder.\nMeanwhile, almost a week on from the murder, little definite is known about the suspect.\nThis is the moment that Dutch police investigating the murder of a 17-year-old girl and sex attacks on two other women discover a large knife tossed into a river outside the asylum seeker hostel\nThe teenager, named Lisa, was cycling to her home in the suburbs in the early hours after a night out in Amsterdam when she realised she was being followed and called the police. Pictured: Police search the waterside next to the building\nBut by the time officers arrived Lisa was found lying dead in a ditch after being stabbed in the neck. It was in the river that runs past the hostel in Amsterdam Zuidoost that a knife was today discovered having apparently been discarded in a river\nThe suspected killer of 17-year-old Lisa caught on CCTV in Duivendrecht\nHe is believed to be originally from Nigeria and not to have Dutch or EU citizenship but had not been registered at the asylum seeker centre he was living in.\nDetectives are even said to be struggling to find his real name.\nAs well as the murder of Lisa, it’s believed he is also being held on suspicion of the rape of a second woman and attempted sexual assault of a third woman.\nHe is currently detained in custody and will remain there for at least another two weeks.\nThe case has caused public horror in the Netherlands where thousands of protesters turned out on the streets for a demonstration to ‘reclaim the night’ and to stop violence against women.\nA woman named Collette, who had come to pay her respects at the layby near to where Lisa's body was found, said tearfully: 'It is just such a tragedy, it has affected all of us here.\n'It is so sad, the two girls she had been with in town had decided to get a taxi home but because she had an electric bike she thought she would be okay. And when you are 17, you don't think too much about this and you also think you will be safe.\nThe suspect is an illegal unregistered migrant in his early 20s who was seized by a SWAT Team at a hostel for asylum seekers.

It's a tragedy.'\nAnother mourner, laying flowers for LIsa with his wife said: 'The country is in shock. But it happens again and again and again and nothing is done.’\nOne man who teaches at the University Amsterdam, which has a campus opposite the hostel told the Daily Mail: 'They arrest people all the time here. It is known for its crime. This place is going to s***.’\nAnother man, who lives in a flat nearby added: 'Walking here near the hostel at night is uncomfortable. There is a lot of loitering, loud music, you don't feel safe and I am a tall guy.\n'If my girlfriend comes to visit I don't want her going out alone because I just don't think it's safe around here’\nThousands of flowers, letters and soft toys have been placed around Amsterdam and Lisa's nearby hometown of Abcoude.\nDutch Police have said they are unable to release the name of the suspect and confirm his age at present, with the Public Prosecution Service announcing today ‘his identity has not been fully established’.\nThe man has reportedly given conflicting accounts of his date of birth and his country of origin.\nCrowds at an Ajax football match at the Johan Cruijff Arena stood in silence in memory of the teenager and held banners with her name\nThe case has caused public horror in the Netherlands where thousands of protesters turned out on the streets for a demonstration to ‘reclaim the night’ and to stop violence against women\nParticipants in a weekly protest march against femicide in Rotterdam where the activists want to raise awareness of the problem of domestic violence\nIt comes as residents living in the asylum centre told local paper Het Parool the suspect had not been registered at the facility and had been staying in someone else’s room.\nIt is unclear how long the man has been living in the Netherlands and whether he was seeking asylum.\nA spokesperson for the country’s prosecution service insisted this afternoon that the individual's origin is not relevant to the case.\nIn a press conference alongside police officers and the mayor, he said: ‘We suspect he's 22, but we don't know for sure where he's from.\n‘That is not relevant for the criminal proceedings, nor whether he is in the country legally or not. The facts are no less serious because of that.’\nFollowing his arrest, a fourth woman has since come forward and claimed she was chased by a man on the same day Lisa was stabbed to death near Holterbergweg in Duivendrecht.\n'I was on my way home from work, and when I turned a corner, I saw a man who looked normal, but he started running after me,' she told De Telegraaf.\nA sea of flowers at the village church in memory of Lisa, who was found dead along Holterbergweg in Duivendrecht\nA person bikes by an improvised memorial for 17-year-old Lisa from Abcoude, at Holterbergweg, where she was found dead, in Amsterdam\n'I thought he was going to hurt me or take my electric bike or phone. Luckily, he didn't overtake me, but I'm still shaking with fear.'\nEarlier today chilling footage showed the alleged suspect prowling around the area of Amsterdam where Lisa was killed.\nHe could be seen wearing a grey hoodie with his face shielded around 3.30am on Wednesday morning.\nShortly after Lisa, who was cycling on her electric bike from the city centre to her hometown of Abcoude, called emergency services telling them she was being followed and harassed.\nThe emergency service worker stayed on the phone with Lisa until the phone suddenly went dead.\nThe cycle route is a popular one and one that Lisa herself had used often.\nCCTV footage shows another person, possibly Lisa, cycling at high speed at 3:53am on the bike path towards the Amsterdam Arena.\nFollowing her call with emergency services, the young woman was then brutally attacked just south of the secondary school she had recently graduated from, called Spinoza20first.\nLisa's family have asked for her surname and photograph not to be circulated publicly as they grieve the loss of the 17 year old\nOn Sunday, around 500 people participated in a March Against Femicide in Rotterdam in the wake of Lisa's death, carrying signs such as 'She had dreams, no grave needed' and 'Not all men, but always men'\nPolice officers later arrived at the scene at 4.15am after they received a call from the public.\nLisa was found dead in a ditch near the water’s edge along the Holterbergweg, close to the Johan Cruijff Arena and concert venue Ziggo Dome.\nOfficers found she had stab wounds along her neck and that she had not been sexually assaulted.\nFollowing the attack, police launched a manhunt for the suspect who they described as a dark-skinned man, approximately 20 years old and around 1.70 metres tall.\nHe was said to have been wearing a white sweater with large sleeves over a black sleeveless shirt.\nThe unnamed man was arrested a day later outside an asylum seeker hostel, with other residents at the accommodation telling newspaper Het Parool the suspect had said he was from Nigeria.\nThe victim was described by police as having medium-length blonde hair. She was wearing a light grey hoodie, light grey trousers and black Adidas trainers when she was attacked.\nPolice are investigating the scene where a 17-year-old girl was found dead along a roadside in Duivendrecht\nPolice are investigating the scene where a 17-year-old girl was found dead along a roadside in Duivendrecht\nShe also had a red handbag hanging from the handlebars of her bicycle which was from Cowboy with a light grey frame and black chain lock.\nA statement from her grief-stricken family said: 'Our hearts are broken. We hope we can mourn Lisa's loss together in peace and privacy.\n‘We are immensely supported by the love and sympathy from family, friends, and fellow villagers, and we want to express our gratitude for this.'\nThey have asked for her surname and photograph not to be circulated publicly.\nLisa’s murder came just days after another woman was raped on Weesperzijde in Amsterdam during the night between August 14 and 15.\nThe woman had been pulled off the road before being assaulted and sexually abused. She was later taken to hospital and a major police investigation was launched.\nFollowing Lisa’s death, police raised suspicions the same individual was connected to both cases.\nPolice then looked back at another incident on August 10, also on the Weesperzjidge, which was initially reported as a suspected robbery but now is being considered as an attempted sexual assault by the same individual.\nThe tragedy has led to a public outcry in the Netherlands - with thousands of mostly women taking to the streets to campaign to stop violence against women and girls.\nA nationwide ‘reclaim the night’ campaign was launched after a poem about Lisa’s final moments cycling home went viral.\nThe poem, written by Dutch actress and author Nienke Gravemade, said: 'The red bag. I keep thinking about that red bag. How it dangled from her handlebars as she drove through the night. A night that belonged to her too.\n'I claim the night. I claim the streets. I demand that the fear be lifted.'\nAlongside the poem, the author posted the hashtag #rechtopdenacht or 'right to the night'.\nA fundraising campaign called 'We claim the night' has raised nearly €400,000 as of Monday morning.\nIn the Netherlands, according to the organisation Just Peace, a woman in the country is murdered every eight days.\nOn Sunday, around 500 people participated in a March Against Femicide in Rotterdam in the wake of Lisa's death, carrying signs such as 'She had dreams, no grave needed' and 'Not all men, but always men'.\nThe protest, organised by Dutch Feminist group Dolle Mina Rotterdam, has been occurring every week since early August following the killing of two women in two days the previous month - both allegedly by their partners or ex-partners.\nCrowds at an Ajax football match at the Johan Cruijff Arena stood in silence in memory of the teenager and held banners with her name on Sunday.\nShe was a supporter of the club and her body was discovered near its grounds.\nSwathes of protests in the country have also been held outside accommodation for asylum seekers in the Netherlands.\nA heavy police presence remains outside the hostel in Amsterdam-Zuidoost where the suspect was handcuffed by a SWAT team on Thursday evening.\nThe hostel was set up in 2022 as an emergency accommodation centre for asylum seekers in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war.\nIt now houses 850 asylum seekers from countries all around the world, including 130 Ukrainians.\nAnd as within the UK, the issue of illegal migration and those seeking asylum is becoming one of the most talked about political issues in the Netherlands.\nHard-right nationalists have been accused of taking advantage of the tragedy as Dutch elections approach at the end of October.\nGeert Wilders, the leader of the Freedom Party (PVV), has pledged to close the country to all asylum seekers.\nPosting on X in the wake of the attack he said: ‘Every day more misery. Murder, rape, violence.\n‘The PVV wants an immediate total [stop to asylum] and all criminal scum out of our country.’\nPolice are now appealing to at least three potential witnesses spotted on CCTV around the time of the attack to piece together what happened to Lisa on her journey home.\nThe potential witnesses include a scooter rider, the occupants of a light-coloured delivery van, and the occupants of a Biro microcar who were driving on the road near where her body was found.\nA large portion of the victim's cycling route is covered by video, but clear footage of the last seven minutes - between the Breitnertoren (near Amstel Station) and Holterbergweg - are still missing.\n'What happened between the victim's departure from Leidseplein and the discovery of her body is still unclear,' the force said in a statement.\n'We are urgently seeking information about her last cycling route and are calling on three specific road users to come forward. Do you know anything, or were you one of them? Contact the police immediately.'",
