In 2023, the BBC was forced to axe much of its sports coverage one Saturday as presenters refused to work in solidarity with Lineker.\nThe former England striker, who anchored the football highlights program “Match of the Day,” had been taken off air due to comments he had made on social media about immigration.\nCritics said the BBC had bowed to pressure from the then-Conservative government. Lineker was back on air soon after but left the corporation earlier this year after another spat over social media comments.",
