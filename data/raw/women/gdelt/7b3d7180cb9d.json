  "body_text": "Hayes linked to US job as she quits WSL\nChelsea boss, who grew up in Camden Town, could become the world’s highest paid female coach\nThursday, 9th November 2023 — By Steve Barnett\nEmma Hayes will leave Chelsea at the end of the WSL season [Tom Phillips/SPP]\nTHERE were 23 goals in the Women’s Super League (WSL) at the weekend – six of which were scored by Chelsea in their match away to Aston Villa at the Bescot Stadium.\nThe emphatic 6-0 victory saw the west Londoners take over at the top of the table.\nBut all the talk after the game soon focused on Blues boss Emma Hayes, who has revealed that she will be leaving the club at the end of the season to pursue “a new opportunity outside the WSL and club football”.\nHayes, who grew up kicking a ball around the Curnock Street Estate in Camden Town, is reportedly on the brink of being confirmed as the next manager of the United States women’s national team, where she could become the world’s highest paid female coach.\nThe former Parliament Hill School pupil is no stranger to living stateside, having previously enjoyed spells coaching at Long Island Lady Riders, Chicago Red Stars and Washington Freedom. Since joining Chelsea in 2012 Hayes has led the club to six league titles, including four in a row, five FA Cups, and two League Cups. It’s a winning run that includes clinching a historic double on two occasions and a domestic treble.\nShe also won the FA Women’s Spring Series trophy and the Community Shield, and guided Chelsea to a Champions League final.\nEstablishing herself as one of the best coaches in the game, Hayes has also been named WSL manager of the season on six occasions and League Managers Association (LMA) WSL manager of the season five times, as well as being inducted into the WSL Hall of Fame in 2021.\nIn a joint statement, Chelsea co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley said: “Emma has been one of the biggest drivers of change in women’s football. Her achievements at Chelsea are unrivalled and will live in the club’s history forever.\n“Given everything she has contributed to Chelsea in over a decade with the club, and the legacy she leaves behind, we would never stand in her way when she felt it was the right time to pursue a new challenge.”",
