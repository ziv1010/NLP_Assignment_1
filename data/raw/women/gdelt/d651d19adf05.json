Sun-Times…\n-\n- Illinois and Chicago on Monday accused federal immigration officials of an illegal occupation that’s led to “fear,” “indiscriminate violence,” and an “impermissible interference with state sovereignty” designed to force local leaders to abandon critical public policy.\n- The new lawsuit makes claims about the feds’ capture of biometric data, warrantless arrests, immigration enforcement at “sensitive locations” like courthouses and schools, the swapping of license plates and trespassing on private property.\n- It points out that, for decades, federal agents enforced immigration laws and arrested individuals subject to removal “without significant impact on public order and safety.” But since September, they “have imported interdiction tactics from the border into Chicago’s neighborhoods, and then, as one senior official put it … ‘push[ed] the envelope.’”\n* Related stories…\n• The Independent: Minnesota sues Trump administration over ‘unprecedented’ surge in immigration agents that has ‘terrorized’ Minneapolis\n• Tribune: Illinois and Chicago sue DHS over ‘militarized’ immigration-enforcement tactics\n• Capitol News Illinois: Lawsuit puts Illinois on offensive against ‘menacing’ immigration raids\n* Gov.

[….] Projects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.\n* ABC Chicago | Illinois House speaker pushing for new millionaire tax with looming $2.2B budget deficit: Speaker Welch suggested Mayor Johnson’s hopes for state approval for progressive taxes, such as one on professional services, may go nowhere. “We’re going to put those things through the hopper like we would any other idea. I don’t know if there’s an appetite for anything right now,” Welch said. A tax surcharge on incomes over a million dollars, modeled after Massachusetts, which Forbes reports saw a windfall of $5.7 billion during the first two years, is possible, he said.\n* Democrat Karim Lakhani is out with a new digital and streaming ad as he runs in the crowded 12th District primary.

This is people-first leadership rooted in fairness, care, and opportunity.”\n* WGN | Darren Bailey talks Bears, immigration crackdown and family tragedy amid new gubernatorial bid: If state finances were better, there should be a conversation among legislators, Bailey suggested. When asked whether he supports using taxpayer money to fund stadiums for sports teams, however, Bailey said he has never been in the conversations. “I support keeping teams. It’s big business. It needs to stay in Illinois. Right now, I don’t think the people of Illinois would support that until we get our taxes down,” Bailey said.\n* WAND | IL law expands dual language education options: The law calls on the Illinois State Board of Education to adopt a comprehensive plan for school districts outlining steps to establish or expand dual language education in their schools by Dec. 15.

The track recently completed its latest thoroughbred meet (March 20-Nov. 3) and will run its next thoroughbred meet starting on March 29. “Nothing new to report. We draw Wednesday (Jan. 14) for this weekend’s races,” said Tony Somone, Executive Director, IHHA in an email to GamblingInsider.com Monday morning. “We are hopeful that Hawthorne will have their financing in order by then and that the bounced checks will be made good. They continue to tell us that they are working on a fix for this problem and anticipate that happening any day now,”\n* Tribune | Late tax bills have cost Cook County schools nearly $122 million, district leaders say: To bridge the gap in the meantime, school districts — particularly wealthier ones whose budgets rely more heavily on property taxes than on state aid — had to take out loans, cash out investments or forgo other investment income that would have built up on property tax revenues parked in the bank, the Tribune previously reported.

The broader council meeting was preceded by a finance committee meeting at which auditors suggested the city is making some progress, but has a long way to go in digging itself out of a more than $150 million debt. Late last year, the town laid off almost half of the fire department and a third of the police force. The council previously declared financial distress, which could bring state oversight and help.\n* Aurora Beacon-News | Aurora marks record number of animal transfers from shelter: A transfer, which is different than a direct adoption, is when a different organization takes an animal from a shelter to adopt out on its own. The goal of transferring out is to lower the number of animals the shelter needs to keep itself, opening up kennel space for new ones to come in, according to Animal Control Manager Kameron DeBoer. Plus, other rescue organizations often have foster programs, so the animals can live in homes instead of in cages like they do at the shelter, which makes them happier and healthier, DeBoer said. These organizations also often have an easier time getting the animals adopted, she said.\n* Daily Herald | Rosemont raising ticket fees on shows at arena, theater: The village board Monday agreed to hike the fee tacked onto the price of each ticket sold for events at the Allstate Arena and Rosemont Theatre from $2 to $3.

There would be at least several other council members that would have changed their vote,” Horn said.\n* 25News Now | Bloomington to focus on growth, services in 2026, says Mayor Brady: Brady said city staffers reviewed property assessments and revenue sources before deciding on higher property tax rates to fund services.

He was 69 and passed away two days after his birthday.\n* The Atlantic | The Court Case That Is Allowing ICE to Stop Just About Anyone It Wants: In 1996, the Supreme Court decided Whren v. United States, which came about when plainclothes vice officers patrolling in the District of Columbia passed a truck in a “high drug” area and “their suspicions were aroused.” They had a hunch that the truck was involved in a drug operation. They chose to wait until it had violated a traffic ordinance (turning without a signal) and then used that violation as an excuse to stop the truck. In the course of searching the truck, they found crack cocaine.\n* LA Times | New California tool can stop brokers from selling your personal online data: Starting this year, a single request form will allow Californians to demand that data brokers delete their personal information and refrain from collecting or selling it in the future. Third parties are constantly lurking as you navigate the internet, collecting data they can later aggregate and sell, according to the Electronic Privacy Information Center. These data brokers can gather your email addresses, Social Security number, as well as details about your income, political preferences and martial status — often without your knowledge — and offer that information to everyone from advertisers to landlords to debt collectors.\n* WSJ | X Faces U.K. Probe Over Grok’s Sexualized Images: The U.K.’s communications watchdog has launched an investigation into Elon Musk’s X social-media platform over sexualized images created by its Grok artificial-intelligence chatbot.

Perhaps they can use some of those increased revenues to upgrade to marginally larger versions (An extra inch or two in width). I seriously think that they may still be using the same seats in the arena that they were using when I saw R.E.M. there on the Monster tour.\n-\n- Leatherneck - Tuesday, Jan 13, 26 @ 12:13 pm:\nAlthough both candidates have filed since Oct. 27, I just noticed via Springfield activist Ken Pacha’s Facebook page that Miguel Valente is primarying Sam Cahnman in Sangamon County Board District 18. Interesting, and he’s getting veterans’ groups support too:\n-\n- Leatherneck - Tuesday, Jan 13, 26 @ 12:19 pm:\nIn addition to the millionaire tax by income, it would also help the state’s bottom line if we also applied the millionaire’s tax to personal property tax.

And all the supercharged, immense trucks and SUVs in the parking lots and parking deck sometimes taking part of a second parking spots too.\nThat being said, would you consider a 2000s-era Ford Focus that I drive to be a “compact car”? I might take that chance at my next appointment, see if my Focus would qualify for those spots.\n-\n- Amalia - Tuesday, Jan 13, 26 @ 1:01 pm:\nthat Lightfoot story is wild. Sad that another bill paying issue gets into the public dialogue.\n-\n- Dotnonymous x - Tuesday, Jan 13, 26 @ 8:46 pm:\nBoundary Dam (Canada): The world’s first commercial CCS project, plagued by technical issues and downtime, though it has captured significant CO2, notes E&E News by POLITICO and Global CCS Institute.\nSorry, comments for this post are now closed.",
