  "body_text": "The renovation of a historic stadium in Franklin Park has become a political issue, with opponents of Mayor Michelle Wu, including mayoral candidate Josh Kraft, calling for the project to be halted.\nBut Boston Public Schools student-athletes — the ones who would be using the stadium — feel differently.\nStudents who spoke to the media at a virtual press conference after school Thursday said they were upset that the project had become a political point of contention because they had waited too long for adequate sports facilities.\n“When I race at White stadium, I’m not just competing against my opponents. I’m competing against the track itself,” said Brighton High School senior Jai’Reona Brown-Carter, who participates in track, cheerleading and basketball. “We should be able to compete on a track that lets us showcase our full potential, not one that holds us back. Boston is full of talent, but without the right resources, we’re always starting at a disadvantage.”\nWhite Stadium, built in 1949, is maintained by Boston Public Schools, which has used it for football practices. However, the aging venue has fallen into disrepair because the school district has been unable to keep up with maintenance costs.\nThe city, which will retain ownership of the stadium, partnered with the owners of BOS Nation, a new women’s Major League Soccer team, to help fund the $200 million project. One side of the stadium will be reconstructed with public funds and will contain facilities for Boston Public School athletes. The remainder of the project will be paid for by the soccer team, including future ongoing maintenance costs.\nPart of the need for updates comes from the fact that the existing structure is inaccessible to people with disabilities.\nDelmace Mayo, also a Brighton High senior, competes in track and field in a racing wheelchair and said practicing at White Stadium was “challenging” because of the cracked and uneven track. Instead, he travels around the state to practice.\n“I work just as hard as any other athlete in the city, but right now, Boston doesn’t have the kind of facilities that wheelchair athletes need to train safely, never mind at a high level,” Mayo said. “I want a local track where I can train without having to travel hours just to find a safe surface. White Stadium should be that place.”\nThe project has drawn loud opposition from neighbors and others across the city due to the estimated $90 million price tag for the city’s portion of the project and because they believe the city is giving up a public asset to a private organization.\nThe city has said the cost of the renovation is mainly due to the historic nature of the structure, and the public will actually have more access to the stadium when the project is complete because it will be open to the public every day.\nSome students said sharing the stadium with BOS Nation was actually a positive. Melissa Diaz, a freshman at Margarita Muñiz Academy who plays flag football, imagined professional opportunities such as internships that could come from the connection to the team.\n“I want girls like me to know that if they want to play sports, if they want to coach, if they want to work in the sports industry, they should have every opportunity to do that,” Diaz said. “Imagine future students playing their games at the same place as a professional sports team, and how proud and excited they will be.”\nOne group of residents has sued the city to stop the project, though last year, a judge declined to halt demolition and construction as the case plays out. A trial is scheduled to begin on Tuesday.\nIn a statement, the group of more than 40 students asked the courts to approve the project “as soon as possible.”\nAccording to the 10-year lease signed in December, the soccer team — expected to begin playing in 2026 ― will use White Stadium for up to 20 game days per season, which runs from March to October, as well as one practice day before each game. The stadium will be available for Boston Public Schools and community use the rest of the year.",
