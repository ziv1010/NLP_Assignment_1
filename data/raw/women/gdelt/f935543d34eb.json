That’s how things roll in Pasadena on New Year’s Day.\nFor update, see: Your 2025 guide to every Rose Parade float, band and equestrian unit\nWith “Celebrating a World of Music: The Universal Language” as the theme, parade fans can expect lots of musical performances, including ones by Destiny’s Child icon Michelle Williams, “The Voice” champion Cassadee Pope and, in the grand finale, “American Idol” winner Jordin Sparks.\nWhat follows is a look at the floats, bands, equestrian units and more, in the order they’re expected to appear along the 5.5-mile parade route. (Note: The lineup is subject to change, even as late as the morning of the parade.)\nFor related, see: 5.5 miles of roses: The 2024 Rose Parade route\nPre-parade A. Sound car\nPre-parade B. Pace car\n1-a. Rose Parade Opening Spectacular, presented by Honda\n1-b. American Honda\nKeep Dreaming\n(Artistic Entertainment Services)\nAs a Rose Parade presenting sponsor, the Honda float is the first one to roll down Colorado Boulevard and does not compete in the judging process. The company first collaborated with the Tournament of Roses in advance of the 1962 procession, when it provided two-wheeled vehicles for parade officials — something it still does to this day. It also provides multi-utility vehicles for event operations.\n1-c. U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber flyover\nWhiteman Air Force Base, Missouri\nAn exhilarating Tournament of Roses tradition, a flyover of the giant stealth bomber to open the parade was put on hiatus last year due to Air Force safety inspections. But for 2024, it will return, flying in from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, to the delight of crowds along Colorado Boulevard and a worldwide TV audience.\n2. United States Marine Corps Mounted Color Guard\nBarstow\nFormed in 1967 to promote the Marine Corps Logistics Base in Barstow at community-sponsored events, this is the last remaining mounted unit in the Marine Corps, and continues to play a key role as a recruitment tool. This group has been leading every Rose Parade since 1985. And, here’s a fun fact: This is generally the only equestrian unit allowed to carry the American flag in the Rose Parade, although exceptions were made in 2014 and 2019 for the U.S. Forest Service to also ride with the Stars and Stripes.\n3. United States Marine Corps West Coast Composite Band\nMarine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego and Camp Pendleton\nThe United States Marine Corps West Coast Composite Band is a combined military band made up of U.S. Marines from the 1st Marine Division Band, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing Band and Marine Band San Diego. Donning the dress blue uniform, these Marine musicians are fully combat trained, and many have completed military tours overseas. Although the three bands perform individually more than 300 times a year, the Rose Parade is the only event that brings all of these elite musicians together at the same time.\n4. City of Alhambra\nCelebrating the Year of the Dragon\n(Phoenix Decorating Company)\nShannon Tan, a student at Ramona Elementary School in Alhambra, created the design for this float, which features a giant dragon, with a globe perched in its claw, standing protectively over her sleeping baby dragon. Nearly 20,000 flowers adorn the float, including purple fine-cut statice; light lavender, white and “pink lady” button mums; hot pink cranberries; black beans; and dark gray lettuce seeds on the mama dragon’s head. Besides celebrating 2024 as the Year of the Dragon, this entry marks Alhambra’s 95th year participating in the Rose Parade.\n5. Shriners Children’s\nBelieve in Tomorrow\n(Phoenix Decorating Company)\nTying together this year’s Rose Parade theme and the mission of Shriners Children’s, the setting of this float is a concert in a botanical garden; one of the musicians is a young cellist who plays her instrument with a prosthetic arm made by the Shriners Children’s Pediatric Orthotics and Prosthetic Services department. Music, which can offer comfort during a procedure and help reduce anxiety, is often incorporated in the care plan for young patients at Shriners, which treats children from more than 170 countries. As for the float, it features nearly 25,000 flowers and natural elements including light and dark lavender mums for the dress, and bronze fine-cut strawflower for the cello.\n6. Toho Marching Band\nNagoya, Japan\nFeaturing 176 musicians, mostly females, this band is made up of students from Toho High School and Aichi Toho University, which are located adjacent to each other in Nagoya, Japan. Toho High School is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its opening in 1923, and the school’s Green Band performed in the 2017 Rose Parade.\n7. The Norco Cowgirls Rodeo Drill Team\nNorco\nFounded in 2008, this unit performs dangerous, high speed, precision maneuvers at a gallop to thrill rodeo fans. While their New Year’s Day appearance on Colorado Boulevard will be more toned down, they’re sure to impress wearing custom-made sparkling rhinestone show shirts adorned with flying fringe, Red Bailey cowboy hats and matching rodeo chaps. The team consists of 15 dedicated horsewomen, with 9-year-old Shae Cremo being the youngest member of the unit in today’s lineup. She’ll be riding with her mom and sister.\n8. Visit Newport Beach\nJingle on the Waves\n(Phoenix Decorating Company)\nAt a combined 165 feet long, this five-part float is sort of a mini Newport Beach Boat Parade — one of the many popular experiences during the holiday season in the beachside community. It starts with a decorated boat with a pink flamingo, festive polar bear, lights and toys and gifts with an oversized group of trees with all the trimmings. At its midpoint is a yacht with several past Rose Queens. The finale is a snowman in a top hat wishing everyone a happy new year.\n9. Tournament of Roses Grand Marshal\nTony winner Audra McDonald, the 2024 Rose Parade grand marshal, will ride the parade route in style — aboard a 1910 Model M Thomas Flyer, which is powered by a 439-cubic-inch, 40-horsepower, six-cylinder engine. When the vehicle was new, it cost $3,500 (about $113,000 in today’s dollars).\nRelated: List of every Rose Parade grand marshal since 1896\n10. Pipes on Parade: The Massed Pipes & Drums\nSouthern California\nWith 168 members, this is a unique ensemble with an interesting history: Lead director Joel M. Daniel, a longtime tuba/sousaphone instrumentalist who now makes a living as a professional bagpiper, has brought together 10 smaller bagpipe bands into a larger ensemble that will be marching in the parade. The smaller units are from throughout Southern California, and include The Pasadena Scots, The Los Angeles Scots and Rancho Cucamonga Fire Pipes and Drums, plus individuals like Daniel who are not currently members of any active band. As for Daniel, he has marched in nine Rose Parades, starting in 1993 as a member of the Pasadena City College Honor Band and later with the West Coast Composite Marine Band.\n11. Pasadena Humane | Hill’s Pet Nutrition\nFeed the Love\n(Artistic Entertainment Services)\nAfter marking its 120th anniversary in 2023, Pasadena Humane opens its next 120 years with this float, combining efforts with longtime partner Hill’s Pet Nutrition. Since they joined forces in 2012, Pasadena Humane (a shelter is just blocks away from Tournament House and the parade route) has helped 53,000 dogs and cats find loving families. The five loving dogs and seven cute cats are decorated primarily with a combination of strawflower petals, great ming and Spanish moss-uva, pampas and oat grasses, palm fibers, with accents of poppy, sesame and onion seed.\nMore coverage: Where do all those Rose Parade roses come from? Turns out, it’s far from California\n12. The New Buffalo Soldiers\nShadow Hills, Calif.\nRepresenting the 10th Regiment, Company H of the U.S. Cavalry, this unit was formed in 1992 for historical interpretation. The group continues to research the history of military participation of Black Americans. For the 2024 Rose Parade, they’ll be joined by a group honoring the 25th Infantry Bicycle Corps, known as the Iron Riders. These Iron Riders will be marking 125 years since an experimental expedition was initiated by the Army to test the feasibility of using bicycles versus horses as a mode of military transportation.\n13. CORE Kidney\nGift of Life: A Tune That Never Fades!\n(Phoenix Decorating Company)\nIn a beautiful garden display featuring a hummingbird and butterflies, kidney donors are swinging under the kidney-shaped gift of life tree in this entry from CORE Kidney, which is making its Rose Parade debut. The organization’s mission is to show how widespread kidney disease is, with the goal of inspiring more people to take preventative measures, which can be as simple as taking a blood and urine test to check how well your kidneys are functioning.\n14. West Chester University ‘Incomparable’ Golden Rams Marching Band\nWest Chester, Pennsylvania\nWith a history that dates back to 1889, this 345-member band from the suburbs of Philadelphia has performed at a number of notable events and venues — the World Series, Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade and NFL stadiums (for the Philadelphia Eagles, Pittsburgh Steelers, New York Jets and Giants, Washington Redskins) — and is now adding the Rose Parade to that impressive list. In 2019, they became the first Division 2 marching band to earn the prestigious Sudler Trophy (the Heisman of the marching band world). Fun fact: West Chester University has a satellite campus two blocks away from Independence Hall.\n15. City of Torrance\nThe Lyrical Call of Nature\n(Fiesta Parade Floats)\nStudent Jodie Cheng, from West High School in Torrance, created the conceptual design for this float, which features a nest of humming birds calling out to their mother. The backdrop is a beautiful display of trees adorned with pink dendrobium orchids and pink mokara orchids. Torrance’s Rose Parade participation dates to 1914, two years after the planned community was founded. But it wasn’t until 1958 when the city became a regular participant, and since then more than 75% of their floats have brought home an award, including the Princess Trophy in 2020 and 2022.\n16. Spirit of the West Riders\nArcadia\nFrom nearby Arcadia, this unit serves as “a living tribute to the equestrians who pioneered our American frontier with our authentic and colorful appearances,” according to organizers. Outfits cover the 1840-1920 period of the American west; and some of the saddles are carefully restored original period works, while others are authentic reproductions. Many of the riders have appeared in Wild West shows, TV documentaries and feature films.\n17. Sierra Madre Rose Float Association\nEnchanted Music Box\n(Self-built)\nFor many of us, music appreciation started with our first music box, which were created in the 1700s and have appeared in cultures around the globe. In this case, the horses are spinning around and floating up and down — but one of them has been magically transported beyond the carousel and into the future. Among the 40,000 flowers on this float, 12,000 roses fill the deck, and the music box features Italian ruscus with spider mums, button mums and carnations. During the last 17 Rose Parades, the Sierra Madre Rose Float Association has won 16 awards.\nMore coverage: What if AI designed the floats?\n18. Banda Municipal de Zarcero\nCosta Rica\nThis 308-member unit competed in the World Marching Band Championship last June and is making their second Rose Parade appearance (2020 was the first). Their uniforms are inspired by the ancestral Boruca culture, people known for their colorful traditional masks, weaving and other handmade objects.\n19. Cal Poly Universities\nShock N’ Roll: Powering the Musical Current\n(Self-built)\nThe only student-built float you’ll see on New Year’s Day — a tradition that started in 1949 — this joint program between Cal Poly Pomona and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo has produced more than 60 trophy-winning entries over the years (including the Extraordinaire Award in 2023). This year’s float showcases a community of eels and rays living in a sea of electric instruments. Blooms of purple cabbage, dragon fruit and ornamental kale add rich hues to create this stunning underwater tableau.\n20. Tournament of Roses President\nPresident Alex Aghajanian and his family will ride in a famous double-decker Omnibus that will make its world debut in the Rose Parade after a three-year restoration. From the 1900s to the 1930s, these vehicles were the kings of mass transportation in Los Angeles, Paris and many other cities. Theme parks, too. Walt Disney had two built for use at Disneyland in 1956. And, in 1982, Disney asked the legendary Imagineer Bob Gurr to oversee a fleet of new Omnibuses for Epcot’s World Showcase at Walt Disney World.\n21. Western Asset\nTogether in Harmony\n(Phoenix Decorating Company)\nBased in Pasadena for 35 years, Western Asset’s entry has a woodland ensemble celebrating perhaps the most universal of all languages — music. On board, there’s lots of animation, starting with the band’s conductor moving his wing up and down and both the raccoon and giant brown bear strumming along to the beat. During its 15 years in the Rose Parade, Western Asset floats have won 10 trophies, including the Fantasy Award in 2022 and the Judges Award last year.\n22. California Cowgirls Rodeo Drill Team\nWilton, Calif.\nCamaraderie, horsemanship and precision drill along with the individual qualities of commitment, patience, flexibility, pride, imagination and respect — that’s the mission behind this unit from Wilton, a small community southeast of Sacramento. 2024 marks the team’s 30th anniversary; they’ll be riding American quarter horses and paint horses in the parade.\n23. Mid-Parade Performance, presented by Visit Lauderdale\nEveryone Under the Sun\n(Artistic Entertainment Services)\nShowcasing some of the highlights of the area in and around Fort Lauderdale, Florida, this 55-foot-long float features a Guitar Hotel replica (decorated with gold flax seed, ground walnut shell, onion seed and silver leaf), manatees (dark and light poppy seed, ground lichen and onion seed), sea turtles (green ti leaf lima beans, Asian long beans, green seaweed and black beans) and tropical scenery (hanging heliconia, cymbidiums, pink and red ginger). The base of the float features more than 1,000 color rose varieties. Emmy-nominated songwriter Alexander Star, who is based in south Florida and known for fusing music with social impact, will perform aboard the float.\nMore coverage: These 18 Pasadena restaurants are near all the New Year’s Day action\n24. Scripps Miramar Ranch\nSan Diego\nThe pinto American Saddlebred horses of Scripps Miramar Ranch are world famous, thanks to past performances in the closing ceremony of the Olympic Winter Games in Japan and the late Queen Elizabeth’s Diamond Jubilee Pageant, and also having seven immortalized as Breyer Horses toys. On New Year’s Day, the unit will be accompanied by Santa Anita Park bugler Jay Cohen, who will play his famous “Call to the Post” and other tunes — a tie-in to the 2024 Rose Parade theme, “Celebrating a World of Music: The Universal Language.”\n25. Na Koa Ali’i — Hawaii All State Marching Band\nHawaii\nMaking their fifth Rose Parade appearance, this ensemble features specially selected performers from throughout Hawaii. Sections of the band will be wearing Hawaiian print shirts, and the colors — red, yellow, green and blue — will be arranged so that from above it looks like a marching rainbow. Members are wearing handmade Raffia skirts imported from Micronesia; headwear includes a Lei Po’o. Within the percussion section, you will find the “to’eres” or log drums, giving the group a unique Polynesian sound.\n26. OneLegacy Donate Life\nWoven Together: The Dance of Life\n(Fiesta Parade Floats)\nDedicated to saving lives through organ, eye and tissue donation in Southern California, OneLegacy Donate Life is making its 21st Rose Parade appearance with this float showcasing the culture of the Hopi tribe, native to the American Southwest. This group of Pueblo Native Americans is one of the oldest cultures in what’s now the United States, originating some 7,000 years ago. The majestic headdress includes cranberry seed, dehydrated red pepper, carrots and black beans. Purple, blue and yellow statice are used to accentuate the details, and bright white everlasting flowers make her feathers glisten.\n27. Pasadena City College Herald Trumpets\nPasadena\nFor the 44th consecutive year, this unit — composed of nine trumpeters and one snare drummer — announces the Rose Queen and her Royal Court. This elite ensemble was selected from current PCC trumpeters and more than 70 high school musicians, who auditioned from throughout Southern California.\n28. 2024 Royal Court\n(Phoenix Decorating Company)\nNaomi Stillitano, a senior at Arcadia High School, who in October was named the 105th Rose Queen, is joined on this float with the 2024 Royal Court: Olivia Bohanec, Trinity Dela Cruz, Phoebe Ho, Mia Moore-Walker, Jessica Powell, Emmerson Tucker. An estimated 5,000 flowers decorate their float, including white and pink carnations and mums, and pink roses. The crown is adorned with shiny gray silverleaf, white mums, white soybeans, dark gray dark lettuce seed and other elements.\n29. 1st Cavalry Division Horse Cavalry\nFort Cavazos, Texas\nThis entry features 16 quarter horses matched in size and color, brown to dark brown. The riders are wearing replicas of the U.S. Cavalry’s 1880s campaign uniforms, including five-button wool fatigue blouses, sky blue wool trousers and the traditional 19-inch black leather riding boots. This will be the 18th Rose Parade appearance by this unit, dating back to 1996.\n30. Union Station Homeless Services\nBee the Solution\n(Artistic Entertainment Services)\nFounded 50 years ago, this nonprofit serves the San Gabriel Valley through a “housing first” approach that has a 97% retention rate, meaning that nearly every person Union Station finds a home for remains housed. With their whimsical Rose Parade debut, the busy bees are buzzing amid a field of hot pink, pink and white roses bordered by handcrafted arrangements of yellow lilies. Rising high is an adorable Home Sweet Home hive crafted with full-bloom yellow carnations, accented with bark doors and windows.\n31. The Valley Hunt Club\nPasadena\nThis entry has been a part of the New Year’s Day procession from the beginning — in fact, in 1890, Valley Hunt Club members, led by Charles Frederick Holder, sponsored the first Tournament of Roses parade. One beloved club tradition that remains from the early days involves members decorating the carriage each year for its entry, often carrying the club president. Speaking of which, Emilie Lanstra, the club’s ninth female leader, will be riding in the carriage with her family; in honor of the club’s 135th anniversary, they’ll be dressed in late Victorian-era attire.\n32. 110th Rose Bowl Game Float – University of Michigan\n(Artistic Entertainment Services)\nGet ready for the 110th edition of The Granddaddy of Them All — the 2024 Rose Bowl Game — which this year will be a College Football Playoff semifinal, featuring two of the top four teams in the country. This float, featuring an oversized football, will be accompanied by the marching band and pep squad from one of the universities squaring off New Year’s Day afternoon.\n33. Michigan Marching Band, University of Michigan\nAnn Arbor, Michigan\nSince 1898 — when the band featured 22 members — this unit performs at all Michigan Wolverines football home games, plus concerts, pep rallies and parades, including, of course, the Rose Parade. Following the 2007 Rose Parade, the band quickly traveled back to Michigan to attend the arrival of President Gerald R. Ford’s body in Grand Rapids and subsequent funeral procession the next day.\n34. Lutheran Hour Ministries\nMake a Joyful Noise Unto the Lord\n(Phoenix Decorating Company)\nWinner of last year’s Director’s Award, Lutheran Hour Ministries returns with three oversized trumpets (yellow fine-cut strawflower, gold clover seed, white fine-ground rice, brown coffee, black fine-ground onion seed, bronze and orange fine-cut strawflower) with hanging banners (decorative cords of gold clover seed, lettering of black beans, crosses of white navy beans and red small kidney beans) in a floral garden.\n35. Budweiser Clydesdales\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nMaking their first appearance in 1953, the Budweiser Clydesdales were a Rose Parade regular until 2011. They returned in 2014 and have made multiple appearances since then. Towering at 18 hands high (6 feet), the world-famous Budweiser Clydesdales have been the symbol of Anheuser-Busch for more than 75 years.\n36. DirecTV\nTake Me Out to the Ball Game (Americana)\n(Artistic Entertainment Services)\nEl Segundo’s hometown heroes — winners of the 2023 Little League World Series championship — will be celebrated on this float from DirecTV, which was founded 30 years ago and is headquartered in the city. The players, who defied the odds and completed their dream season by battling back from a four-run deficit in the finale to win, will be riding a float that depicts a baseball field with a fresh sod infield and white mums for the baseline. The giant championship trophy will be decorated with yellow and gold strawflower and carnation petals.\n37. Rose Bowl Hall of Fame Class of 2023\nThe latest Hall of Fame inductees will ride the parade route in style — in a 1936 Packard 120-B Victoria LeBaron. It originally was custom-built for George Washington Hill, who at the time was president of the American Tobacco Company. It features an all aluminum body with a three-position convertible top, in which the driver’s top is completely removable. Hill also had a new vehicle made for his wife, a 1936 coupe hardtop.\n38. 110th Rose Bowl Game Float — University of Alabama\n(Artistic Entertainment Services)\nThis is the second of two floats featuring the marching band and pep squad from one of the universities participating in the 110th Rose Bowl Game, which this year is a College Football Playoff semifinal.\n39. Million Dollar Band, University of Alabama\nTuscaloosa, Alabama\nWinner of the Sudler Award in 2003, which designates the national champion of collegiate marching bands, this unit, which today numbers 400-plus members, has performed for Crimson Tide home games since 1912.\n40. Rotary\nClean Water — The Music of Life\n(Phoenix Decorating Company)\nA 44-year Rose Parade participant, this year’s Rotary float highlights the organization’s efforts to bring clean water projects — which provide local solutions for clean water, sanitation and hygiene education — to communities around the globe. The whimsical entry features four oversized ducks holding umbrellas and dancing on a piano keyboard. The baby ducklings have eyes of black seaweed and white powdered rice; beaks decorated with orange ground lentils/orange fine cut strawflower, and hot pink fine cut statice; bodies of white fuzzy cut everlasting; and feet of orange ground lentil. Rotary is a 13-time award winner, including the Princess Trophy last year.\n41. Orange County Regional Mounted Enforcement Unit/Western State Mounted Officer Association\nOrange County\nThis unit includes mounted police officers from various law enforcement agencies throughout Orange County. The officers will be riding quarter horses, and their tack consists of western saddles, leather bridles, leather reins and nylon breast collars. On the job, these officers and their mounts patrol their communities, ensuring major tourist destinations are safe from potential threats, enhance community relationships, and partner with various youth programs and schools.\n42. Mayor of Pasadena\nPasadena Mayor Victor Gordo and his family are traveling the parade route in a 1967 Crown Firecoach Triple Combination fire truck. First designated as Engine 38 for the Pasadena Fire Department, it served the city until 1985. A decade later, it was purchased by current owner Louis C. Farah, executive director of Professional Cars International, a national car club that celebrates the restoration, preservation and appreciation of vintage ambulances, funeral coaches, police cars and other emergency vehicles.\n43. Castle High School, Castle Marching Knights\nNewburgh, Indiana\nFrom Indiana’s southern border, across the Ohio River from Kentucky, the 250-member Marching Knights are a 32-time Indiana state finalist and a four-time Bands of America regional champion.\n44. Downey Rose Float Association\nRhythm of the Caribbean\n(Self-built)\nProduced by one of Downey’s busiest service organizations, this entry from the Downey Rose Float Association travels to the Caribbean with a group of flamingos frolicking in a tropical lagoon setting. Among the more than 18,000 flowers on the 48-foot-long float, roses, orchids and other beautiful flowers decorate the colorful deck; blue iris, hydrangea and white roses are used to create the water effects. This organization, which has a 72-year Rose Parade history, starting in 1913, is a 13-time winner of the Founder’s Trophy.\n45. The UPS Store, Inc.\nThe Beat of Achievement!\n(Fiesta Parade Floats)\nReaching a height of 35 feet, the rapping crocodile at the center of this float makes this one of 2024’s tallest entries. With the croc’s aspiring hip-hop career taking off, a posse of pink flamingos cheers him on. The surrounding tropical paradise overflows with tens of thousands of Pink Floyd roses, plus a dazzling array of orchids, and other eye-popping, colorful and unique flowers. This is the sixth Rose Parade for The UPS Store, Inc. — and each previous entry has been a trophy winner, including the Sweepstakes Award in 2019, 2020 and 2022.\n46. The Blue and Gold Marching Machine\nGreensboro, North Carolina\nFrom North Carolina A&T State University comes a high-stepping marching band known for bringing fans to their feet — as they did when winning the 2003 Defeat the Beat competition. They’ve also performed at Carolina Panthers NFL home games, and was voted one of the nation’s top 10 bands as reported by Sports Illustrated.\n47. Los Hermanos Bañuelos Charro Team\nAltadena\nFounded in 1995 in the San Gabriel Valley by a group of brothers and friends from the state of Zacatecas, Mexico, this unit has appeared in 13 Rose Parades since their debut in 2006. Riders wear authentic Charro suits sporting custom-made logos. The tack that they use also is custom-made with logos stamped on the saddles and their silver spurs. They’ll be riding American quarter horses, Andalusians, Freisians and Aztecas.\n48. Mid-Parade Performance, presented by Explore Louisiana\nExplore Louisiana\n(Fiesta Parade Floats)\nMaking their third Rose Parade appearance, the Louisiana Office of Tourism returns with another invite to the Bayou State — this one featuring thousands of magenta roses, purple and yellow Mokara orchids, bright yellow roses, and green cymbidium orchids. The jester figure is adorned with cut gold strawflower, and whole dark purple and maroon carnations with accents of pink protea and white coconut. Previously, the Louisiana Office of Tourism won the Legacy Award in 2022 and the Showmanship Award last year.\n49. United States Forest Service — Smokey Bear’s 80th Birthday Celebration\nKicking off Smokey Bear’s 80th birthday year, this group — riding and driving mules — features highly skilled Forest Service professionals with decades of pack stock and wilderness management experience. For the Forest Service, mule trains remain the most efficient way to access much of our still-wild lands. The packers and their sure-footed stock manage a variety of tasks: bringing food and supplies to workers in remote wilderness areas, and helping scientists, trail workers and firefighters, much as they have since the 1800s.\n50. City of South Pasadena\nBoogie Fever\n(Self-built)\nThis represents a community effort in many ways. First, the South Pasadena Tournament of Roses has been raising funds locally to construct and decorate floats since 1893, making it the oldest self-built entry in the parade. And, many of the flowers and dry materials were collected locally, including two types of bark (eucalyptus and melaleuca), plus sycamore leaves, liquid amber leaves and bougainvillea flowers. All the animals will have some type of movement — heads swaying, arms moving and tails twitching — and the disc on the record player will spin, taking the toucan for a ride. The song playing on that record player? You guessed it: the 1970s disco hit “Boogie Fever” by The Sylvers.\n51. Pasadena City College Tournament of Roses Honor Band\nPasadena\nCurrent PCC Lancer Marching Band members and select high school students from throughout Southern California make up this 215-member ensemble, which has marched in every Rose Parade since 1930. As they turn the corner onto Colorado Boulevard, listen as they perform Stevie Wonder’s “Sir Duke.” Other musical selections will include the honor band’s theme song, “Everything’s Coming Up Roses,” and John Philip Sousa’s “Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company,” an iconic march that’s celebrating its 100th anniversary.\n52. City of Hope\nA Lovely Day for Hope\n(Phoenix Decorating Company)\nThis is the 50th Rose Parade entry from the City of Hope, one of the largest cancer research and treatment organizations in the United States. Green springeri, bright yellow roses, yellow dendrobium and the bottoms of green ground parsley are used to decorate the trees, which have trunks of brown coffee and tan parsnip seed. The merry-go-round features finial yellow fine-cut strawflower, crown of white balls, white powdered rice and dark red dried cranberry seeds. In total, nearly 30,000 flowers were used. Riding the float are several cancer survivors, including Paul Edmonds from Desert Hot Springs. He is one of five people in the world to achieve full remission of HIV and leukemia after receiving a stem cell transplant at City of Hope in Los Angeles.\n53. Coding for Veterans\nSounds of Success\n(Phoenix Decorating Company)\nMaking their Rose Parade debut, Coding for Veterans helps servicemen and women from both the U.S. and Canadian Armed Forces make the transition from public service to the private sector, with training in the fields of cyber security and software development. The helicopter at the front is inspired by the U.S. Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, with working rotors and tail element; and doing a fly-by at the rear of the float is a replica of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II jet.\n54. Tiger Squadron Flyover\nSouthern California\nFlying vintage warbirds, the Tiger Squadron is a precision formation flying and aircraft display team. It’s made up of military and commercial airline pilots, instructors and experienced civilian pilots with thousands of hours of combined experience, an unblemished safety record and all required formation credentials.\n55. Albertville High School Aggie Band\nAlbertville, Alabama\nFeaturing more than 330 students — nearly a quarter of the student population at Albertville High School — this unit from Alabama is highly regarded in the South and beyond. Besides making their third Rose Parade appearance in 2024, the band also has performed in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade on four occasions, the Disney World Parade, the 2014 Philadelphia Thanksgiving Day Parade and the Magnificent Mile Parade in Chicago.\n56. San Diego Zoo/San Diego Zoo Safari Park\nIt Began With a Roar\n(Artistic Entertainment Services)\nRex the lion, an orangutan, koala bears and other wild animals roam this lush landscape presented by the San Diego Zoo and San Diego Zoo Safari Park, where more than 5 million visitors experience nature every year. This is the parks’ third Rose Parade entry; last year’s float won the Animation Award.\n57. Blue Shadows Mounted Drill Team\nLake View Terrace\nMaking their fifth Rose Parade appearance, the Blue Shadows Mounted Drill Team has a history that dates back six decades. What makes this team unique is new members don’t need to own their own horse. They ride at facilities where rental horses are readily available. Also, past riding experience is not required to join. “Both of these attributes allow the opportunity for so many more people to have a chance to experience this life-changing sport,” says the nonprofit/all-volunteer organization.\n58. Trader Joe’s\na one, a two, … a one – two – three – Broccoli!\n(Phoenix Decorating Company)\nThe 22nd entry from Trader Joe’s — a chain of neighborhood grocery stores that started in Pasadena in 1967 — features, perhaps not surprisingly, an assortment of our vegetable friends. The Fearless Flyer, with a chef’s hat and wooden kitchen spoon, is conducting an orchestra that includes a cool corn sax player (hair of corn silk pieces, glasses of red large kidney beans, arms of green ti leaves and fine ground split pea, and a husk of green ti leaves and fine ground split pea) and a broccoli choir (tops of dark lavender, yellow and Kermit green mums; pink, orange and light green goblin carnations).

Kiwanis International\nServing in Harmony\n(Phoenix Decorating Company)\nIt’s music, music, music on Kiwanis’ 42nd Rose Parade entry, as a giant sheepdog listens to what’s playing on a vintage wind-up gramophone record player.

The canine music-lover is decorated with white pampas grass, and black and dark gray buffalo grass for the fur; hot pink fine-cut statice for the tongue; and eyes of white powdered rice and black seaweed.
