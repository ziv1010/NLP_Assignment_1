  "body_text": "Brazil coach Sundhage eyes missing piece of silverware at World Cup\nTERESOPOLIS, Brazil — The illustrious career of coach Pia Sundhage in women's soccer includes Olympic gold medals, a Copa America Femenina title and accolades such as FIFA women's coach of the year.\nThe one big gap in her coaching resume is a Women's World Cup crown. Sundhage came close in 2011 when her United States team lost the final to Japan in a penalty shootout.\nThe 63-year-old Swede has a fourth chance to finally bag the big one with Brazil, which is also seeking its first World Cup trophy as the great Marta nears the end of her playing days.\nSundhage said during an interview at Brazil's training center in Teresopolis, outside Rio de Janeiro, that she liked their chances when the tournament kicks off on July 20 in Australia and New Zealand.\nHer team is in Group F with France — the team that eliminated the Brazilians four years ago in the last 16 — Jamaica and Panama.\n\"I truly believe the 10 best-ranked teams, like we are, do have a chance to go all the way,\" Sundhage said. \"USA, Germany, Sweden and England, they have a big chance to win.\n\"But look at Canada. They won an Olympic gold medal (in 2020) and they always come from behind. If you don't have any injuries, you have a great team, you gain confidence by winning and having a little bit of luck.\"\nHer coaching involvement in Women's World Cups began in 2007 as an assistant with China. There was the near miss with the US in 2011, between Olympic gold medals at the Beijing and London Games. In 2015, her Sweden side was knocked out in the last 16.\nShe was minding the Sweden Under-17 women when the Brazilian Football Confederation came to Sundhage after the 2019 Women's World Cup. Her contract is up following the 2024 Olympics. Across her stints with the US, Sweden and Brazil, her win rate is above 66 percent.\nSundhage came to Brazil with knowledge of its soccer culture but almost no Portuguese-speaking skills, and a demanding style. Four years later, she has become a fan of Brazilian singers and adopted a more patient approach.\nShe said she felt a culture clash when she took the job, with players reliant on their skills but yet to grow in terms of teamwork.\nIn April, showing her side was on the rise, Brazil drew in England and beat Germany away in two friendlies despite having several players injured, including Marta.\n\"At the start it was overwhelming,\" Sundhage said. \"When I went to the US, it was the same thing. They were very successful and who am I? Should I change anything? Yes, of course, a little bit. But it couldn't be too much of a change because they had been successful. And it couldn't be too small because they could just as well bring in an American coach. It is similar here.\n\"In Sweden, we are very well organized, we have a game plan, especially in defense. When it comes to the US, it is go for it, one versus one. And of course that always brings a change to be more flexible and organized. This warm country with warm people is very emotional. They rely on their technique and doing special things that make you shine, your team shine.\"\nDefender Rafaella agrees Brazil's first experience with a foreign coach has improved the team's defense and brought a more tactical approach.\n\"She brought her style of a very compact team, it is very hard for others to break our lines. We evolved a lot,\" Rafaella said. \"Pia is an extrovert during our meetings, she sings and laughs, but she is very demanding about our fitness, intensity. We will never forget our intensive training with her. I hope we can carry those lessons beyond the 2024 Olympics, no matter how long she works with Brazil.\"\nSundhage will on Tuesday announce her World Cup squad, which has already been affected by injuries. Striker Ludmilla will miss the tournament due to a knee injury, there are doubts over midfielder Angelina, while 37-year-old Marta could start on the bench as she recovers from a left knee problem.\n\"It is a team game, it is not one player that will win the World Cup. It will be the team and it will be a cohesive team,\" Sundhage said.\nThe coach added some of the players she will pick \"will be unstoppable\" inside four years.\nSundhage knows Brazil fans will judge her on what happens in the World Cup but trusts she is on the right path. As to what happens after, she is unconcerned. The team's best previous result was making the 2007 final.\n\"I am on a fantastic journey to the World Cup. Then another fantastic journey to the Olympics in France. And then I have no idea,\" the coach said. \"What matters is that I'm right here, right now.\"\nAgencies via Xinhua\nMost Popular\n- Guangdong beats Macao 2-0 in first leg of soccer cup\n- Para teams set to leave mark on ice\n- US skier Johnson wins women's downhill as Vonn crashes at Milan-Cortina Games\n- Su Yiming clinches first medal at Milano-Cortina\n- Over 300 athletes from 35 countries and regions kick off Asian championships in Tianjin\n- Legacy of Beijing 2022 lives on as Milan welcomes Games",
