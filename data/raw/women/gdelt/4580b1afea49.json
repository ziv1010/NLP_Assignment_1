She is gearing up to play a pivotal role overseeing pitch-side emergency care, ensuring players receive the right rehabilitation both before and after matches.\nCurrently pursuing her Masters in Physiotherapy at Northumbria University and hoping to enter into a career in elite performance sport, Lucy has already shown her entrepreneurial skills by launching her own sports massage clinic at the age of 21.\nSince LMC Sports Massage and Injury Clinic launched in Whitley Park, Benton, in June 2023, it has become a crucial resource for local athletes and rugby teams with tailored rehabilitation services enhancing both recovery and performance.\nSpeaking on what the appointment to the new role means to her, Lucy said: \"I am working alongside a remarkable group of female athletes and highly experienced coaching staff who have already inspired me with their dedication.\n\"I’ve already been lucky enough to have served as a sports rehabilitator for the England Universities National Rugby League Team, where I supported the team during prestigious Four Nations Tours in 2023 and 2024.\n\"The experiences working in different sporting disciplines will set me up for an exciting career in an elite sporting environment in the future.\"\nLucy’s passion for supporting athletes led her to a medical role with the England women’s amputee football team, where she has been providing specialised rehabilitation support.\nAs the team’s journey garners national attention, Lucy is focused on elevating sports rehabilitation and cultivating a culture of care for athletes at every level. With her growing expertise and dedication, she is poised to make a significant impact both on and off the field.\nThe women's squad, who flew out to Colombia on Saturday to take part in the sport's first ever World Cup, will be coached by Harry Smith. The team's first match against Peru took place on Monday.\nThe amputee Lionesses are made up of players from all over the country and many career disciplines. Some became amputees through cancer or accidents, while others were born with limb deficiencies.\nThe team needed to raise £50,000 to take part in the ground-breaking tournament in South America, and were halfway to reaching the target before appearing on BBC Breakfast. The appearance resulted in the team hitting the target immediately overnight.\nSupporters including former England and Chelsea captain, John Terry, who donated money and kit to the team, as well as inviting them down to Stamford Bridge.",
