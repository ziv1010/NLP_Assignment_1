Pauw, 60, denies the allegations.\nDespite Pauw's denial of the allegations, they \"clouded preparations\" for Ireland's appearance in the World Cup, which saw Pauw and captain Katie McCabe engage in an on-field row during their match against Nigeria.\nPauw, who refused to heed McCabe's urges to make changes, said in her post-match press conference: \"If Katie McCabe wants a change, it doesn't mean… she's not the coach.\"\nAfterward, McCabe tweeted out a zipped-mouth emoji, which drew more than 7k likes.\n?\n— Katie McCabe (@Katie_McCabe11) July 31, 2023\nEileen Gleeson, the FAI's head of women and girls’ football, has been appointed interim head coach of the Republic of Ireland team while the FAI begins the process of finding Pauw's replacement.\nGleeson will lead Ireland's Women's Senior Team as they play Northern Ireland in Dublin on September 23 for the UEFA Nations League opener, followed by a game against Hungary in Budapest on September 26.",
