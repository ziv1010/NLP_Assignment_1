  "body_text": "Following the failed attempt to stay in contention for the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) Women’s Champions League, Koloale FC is readjusting its focus on completing the tournament on a high note.\nKoloale suffered their first defeat of the tournament, a 5-0 loss to PNG’s Hekari United FC in their third match.\nThe result puts them off for the title contention.\nA statement from the Solomon Islands Football Federation (SIFF) revealed Koloale’s head coach Crystal Bakolo admitting that her girls were outclassed in the second half, conceding four unanswered goals.\n“It has been difficult for us, but I’m proud of the girls for putting up the effort throughout the game,” she told SIFF Media.\n“Ahead of our final match, I told the girls that we have to be positive.\n“We want to finish on a high-not and to do that we have to play at our very best.\n“We aim for the win and like they say ‘shoot for the moon even if you missed it, you’ll land safely on the stars,” she told SIFF Media.\nKoloale will take on New Caledonia’s AS Academy Féminine today for the final match of their campaign.\nA point will see Koloale FC settle for third, however, getting all three points will be decided between the Hekari FC and Labasa FC match – either a second or third-place finish on goal difference.\nBy CARLOS ARUAFU\nSolomon Star, Honiara",
