Disappointing scenes before the start of the game in Doneraile as 4 teams scheduled to play and only one pitch playable. Following a coin toss to see who would play the Clyda boys started the game well. Weather conditions were poor but Clyda led 1-6 to 0-5 at half time. St Dominic’s scored a goal at the start of the second half. At the end of the third quarter St Dominic’s led by 3-7 to 1-10.\nThe turning point in the game came when after a good move a goal bound effort from Clyda hit the crossbar and came back into the play and the resulting Dominic’s attack led to a penalty being conceded. Dominics scored the resultant penalty and scored two more late goals as Clyda poured in search of scores. Clyda Scores: J Ring 1-6 R O Mullane 0-3 T Colton 0-1\nOur U-15 Hurlers played Banteer/lyre in the Division 3 championship Cup final in Mallow last week, Final score Clyda 3-06 Banteer 5-14\nOur U-17 has had played Millstreet in both Football and hurling championship Semi finals in the last week emerging victorious in both matches by a single point. we will be playing Kilshannig in both finals over the next two weeks.\nAlso, our U-12 has had a great season fresh from winning against Kilworth in their last match reaching the Football Cup final against a strong Mallow side in Castletownroche last Sunday, Final score Clyda 1-07 Mallow 6-07.\nMourneabbey Community Council\nThe community of Mourneabbey are beyond sad at the passing of our Rep from Burnfort/Greenhill Brian Deane.
