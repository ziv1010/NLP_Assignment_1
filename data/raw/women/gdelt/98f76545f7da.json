The result is a combination of the DNA iconic to the early 90's release including the famed fold over tongue and tri-colour palette – overlaid onto design features previewed in early special editions. Predator 24 is available to purchase from January 16th at football boots.\nUnited Arab Emirates: Today, joining a game-changing line up of iconic silhouettes, adidas introduces the latest member of the Predator franchise – Predator 24. A nod to the boot that started it all three decades ago – it unites pure 90s nostalgia with the relentless performance of today to create a boot for a whole new generation of goalscorers.\nThe inspiration of the founding boot is clear, as it blends the aesthetic DNA of the Predator Original with the lightweight design capabilities seen in Predstrike and Predator 30. It carries the famed black, white and red colourway but made bolder in hue, and completed by vibrant yellow taping to proudly declare its place as its own boot, in its own right.\nBonded by this beautifully simplistic design, the silhouette comes in three executions which offer a combination of design features to suit various pricepoints – laced, laceless and a classic laced variant with a fold over tongue for those looking for a pure look of nostalgia.\nSam Handy, VP of Product and Design at adidas said:“The Predator 1994 was the silhouette that started it all and there is no better way to celebrate 30 years of this game-changing franchise than to revisit its early beginnings. It was designed in a very different time, and with different methods that we deploy today. And this became our creative challenge. 'If the Predator 1994 was designed today, for today's athlete, what would it look like?'\nThe answer is Predator 24. A modern-day expression of Predator, with the same eye-catching design DNA that made the Original so iconic, and instantly recognisable on the feet of the game's greatest. We're incredibly excited to continue the story of this beloved boot and can't wait to see players creating their own goal-scoring legacies, while wearing them.”\nWhile the individual boots have evolved, shape-shifting with each generation that wears them – unwavering in the Predator legacy, its core DNA of bold, confident aesthetics, technical superiority.\n- CONTROLFRAME 2.0 lightweight soleplate and heel construction optimize traction for dynamic movement and stability when striking the ball. HYBRIDTOUCH 2.0 upper provides a moulded fit with cushioning in key contact areas for comfort and a soft touch on the ball. STRIKESKIN rubber fins are strategically placed in strike zones, to support ball grip for precision shot-making. STRETCHABLE LACELESS PRIMEKNIT COLLAR – allows for easy entry and secure lockdown. LIGHTWEIGHT DESIGN – with the game getting faster, and responsiveness to in-match moments ever important, Predator 24 joins the limited release Predstrike as the lightest boot in the franchise to date.
