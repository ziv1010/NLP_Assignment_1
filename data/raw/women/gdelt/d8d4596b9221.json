We believe there are not enough opportunities for Nigerians who have the passion for the game to express their talents. That was why we set this up 13 years ago so that people can play in a conducive, enjoyable environment and also have fun,” Ayodeji said.\nFor the Director, Balloff, Ikechukwu Ofili, the tournament has achieved many milestones since its inception, from getting players to play in professional leagues in the country to having them play in reputable leagues abroad. “A former MVP of this tournament, Toyeeb Gidado, now plays for Ikorodu City in Nigeria Professional Football League, NPFL, he also captained the Nigerian U15 side.\n“Also, the 2018 MVP of this tournament, Monday Gift went on to represent the Super Falcons at the World Cup. There are a number of players that have passed through Balloff tournament that are spread across various clubs both at home and abroad and we hope to discover more talents for the nation through this competition,” Ofili noted.\nSustaining a tournament of this magnitude is not always easy, but Ayodeji believes the brotherhood between him and Ofili and the other co-founder, Bidemi Bamboye has kept them going.\n“Aside from the fact that the three of us are business partners, we’re actually very good friends and our collective passion have also helped in sustaining the tournament. Most importantly, there are a lot of talents in the country that needs to be harnessed, which is motivating.\n“We want to do more events, we want to build our own facility, we want to send more grassroots players abroad, we want to develop the game not only from the player’s point of view but also from the educational point of view. Training for the referees and development of the whole ecosystem, and we see it as achievable,” Ayodeji expressed.\nThe three musketeers indeed promised a bigger and better Balloff tournament come next year.",
