  "body_text": "(Editor’s Note – This is a story I wrote a few years ago, but I thought it would be a good time to revisit it considering the recent passing of West Virginia icon Jerry West)\nThere are normally tens of thousands of basketball games played every year in West Virginia – men’s, women’s and co-ed, pick-up or competitive, grasshopper, middle school, high school, college and even a few pro.\nWith a sport dating back 133 years, we’re talking about millions of games in the state. Most were played by those with normal skills, but some featured an amazing collection of talent, including games involving WVU and Marshall. There was an NCAA Tournament East Regional held at the WVU Coliseum in 1972, a four-team event won by Dean Smith’s North Carolina Tar Heels, who were led by Bobby Jones and Bob McAdoo. There were also a number of NBA games featuring Jerry West’s Los Angeles Lakers played in West’s home state, including an exhibition on Oct. 8, 1971 at the then-new WVU Coliseum against Willis Reed’s New York Knicks.\nBut maybe no basketball game played in the state of West Virginia ever contained more overall talent than the one contested on Aug. 10, 1960 at the WVU Field House.\nAnd for some reason, that basketball game has largely been lost to time. It featured a number of former Mountaineers, yet it doesn’t appear in any WVU press guide or website. The participants included four players and both opposing head coaches who would eventually be inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame, as would even one of the referees (Red Mihalik). The manager of one team also is enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame, while the president of the other squad is in baseball’s version. And four players who were on the floor that day are now in WVU’s Sports Hall of Fame.\nBut unlike so many memorable basketball games played in West Virginia, this one has been forgotten by many. One who didn’t forget was a then 12-year-old basketball junkie who attended the contest, faithfully collected postgame autographs of many of the participants and then lovingly preserved it for over a 60 years. Mike Toothman shared his still pristine prize with me, sparking my interest.\nThrough plenty of research and one enlightening phone call, I pieced together most of the key elements of that game. The individual stats have drifted into the ether, but the story behind the Aug. 10, 1960 basketball exhibition game between the U.S. Olympic team and the Cleveland Pipers at the WVU Field House is still available for those willing to do a little digging.\nSo, I went on an excavation tour.\nThe 1960 version of the U.S. Olympic men’s basketball squad was the original Dream Team, 32 years before Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson made the term famous. The U.S. had dominated basketball in the Olympics since the sport was first competed in the Summer Games on an outdoor lawn tennis court in Berlin in 1936. The Americans had won gold in the four Olympics starting in ’36, but even they had never fielded a team like this one, featuring co-captains and future Naismith Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson of Cincinnati and Jerry West of West Virginia, as well as Indiana’s Walt Bellamy and Ohio State’s Jerry Lucas, who also would eventually join them in the Hall. Darrall Imhoff, California’s All-American center who had broken the hearts of West and all Mountaineers with a 71-70 Golden Bear victory in the 1959 NCAA championship game, was on the team, which was guided by his Cal coach, Pete Newell, another Hall of Famer. Jay Arnette of Texas, Bob Boozer of Kansas State, Terry Dischinger of Purdue, Burdette Haldorson of Colorado, Allen Kelley of Kansas, Les Lane of Oklahoma and Adrian Smith of Kentucky also comprised the Olympic roster that year of a team put together in an uneasy truce by AAU and NCAA officials, who were battling control for USA Basketball. The squad was a compromise, as it consisted of seven collegiate stars, four players from the AAU circuit (Boozer, Haldorson, Kelley and Lane), as well as one from the U.S. Armed Forces (Smith). This compromise left off other college stars like Ohio State’s John Havlicek and Providence’s Lenny Wilkens. But still this U.S. team had the talent to dominate the competition in Rome, winning all eight games of its Olympic games by an average score of 101.9-59.5. The closest game in Rome for the Americans was an 81-57 victory over the USSR. Five Americans averaged double-figures in the 1960 Games – Robertson (17.0), Lucas (17.0), West (13.8), Dischinger (11.8) and Smith (10.9). Even today, the ‘60 U.S. Olympic team is regarded by many as the greatest amateur basketball squad ever assembled.\nOf the 12 players on that U.S. Olympic team, all were still amateurs when they went to Rome, though nine of them would go on to play in the NBA. Three of the four AAU inclusions – Haldorson, Kelley and Lane – were the only ones who didn’t play at the highest pro level. Lane went into coaching, though he died of a heart attack in the spring of 1973 shortly after being named as the head coach of his alma mater, the University of Oklahoma.\nThe U.S. roster was put together during the Olympic trials held in Denver in March and April, but they didn’t start practicing as a team until July 30, assembling at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., for the Games in Rome that would begin Aug. 26 and conclude on Sept. 12.\nFive days after they opened practice, the Olympians traveled to Canton, Ohio, to begin their six-game barnstorming tour of exhibition contests, honing their teamwork, chemistry and conditioning. The opponent that first night at the Canton Memorial Auditorium was the Cleveland Pipers, a member of the National Industrial Basketball League. Started as part of the AAU circuit in which various large companies sponsored squads, the NIBL featured teams like the Pipers, the Akron Goodyears, the Bartlesville Phillips 66ers, the Peoria Caterpillars and the Wichita Vickers, almost all of whom were amateur-in-name-only squads consisting of players who worked for the company during the day (if they felt like it) and then played on its basketball team at night. Earlier in 1960, the 29-year-old son of a very well-to-do Cleveland family, which had become wealthy in the shipping business transporting ore and other freight throughout the Great Lakes region and eventually the world, bought the Pipers. It was the first foray into professional sports for George Steinbrenner, who previously served as an assistant football coach at Ohio State, Northwestern and Purdue, before returning to the family business, Kinsman Marine Transit Company, which his great-grandfather had purchased in 1901.\nSteinbrenner would amass his own fortune in the shipping business but would use that money to feed his true passion, sports. It started with his purchase of the Pipers in 1960, and while the semi-pro club had been a part of the Industrial League for several years prior to Steinbrenner’s ownership, he took charge with the notion of leading the franchise into a still-not-formed professional league, the American Basketball League. The brainchild of Harlem Globetrotter owner Abe Saperstein, the ABL brought together some NIBL and AAU teams into a league to compete with the NBA. The Pipers were joined by the Kansas City Steers, Chicago Majors, Pittsburgh Rens and various others to start the ABL in 1961.\nWhen Steinbrenner bought the Pipers in 1960, his eye turned from fielding an Industrial League team to one that would be ready to compete in a full-fledged pro league beginning in 1961. Thus he looked to acquire professional-level talent in the spring of ’60, shortly after buying the Pipers. One of the first things he did was send his private plane to Morgantown to pick up a trio of Mountaineers who had recently concluded their college basketball careers – Willie Akers and Jerry West, as well as a teammate who had graduated the previous year, Bucky Bolyard.\n“It was flattering that he brought us up there, but Bucky and I both knew why we were there – we were friends with Jerry – and Mr. Steinbrenner wanted to use us to try to sign Jerry,” remembered Akers a few years ago. “Jerry went into his office first and met with Steinbrenner. He actually offered him more money than the Lakers, so Jerry didn’t tell him no right away. But for him, it wasn’t about the money; he wanted to play in the NBA. He didn’t tell Steinbrenner that right away, though. When Jerry came out, he told me, ‘Sign as quickly as you can.’ He knew Steinbrenner would give us each a good deal because he was still hoping to get Jerry. So, we both signed as quickly as we could.”\nWest ultimately spurned Steinbrenner’s offer with the Pipers, instead choosing the Lakers of the more established NBA. But both Akers and Bolyard signed and would join the Cleveland squad that summer.\nSteinbrenner would be successful in luring a college All-American two years later, signing Ohio State star, and 1960 Olympian, Jerry Lucas to an unprecedented contract worth $40,000 a year plus stock in the team. Steinbrenner tried to use Lucas’s signing to force the Pipers’ way into the NBA. It nearly worked, but after the ABL won a lawsuit to block the move, Steinbrenner was left with a team but now no path to the NBA and no desire to return to the ABL. So, he folded the club prior to the 1963-64 season, and the ABL went belly up a few months later. The ABA would emerge from those ashes several years after that, using ABL innovations like the three-point shot, to form another NBA competitor.\nSteinbrenner wasn’t done with professional athletics, though. Using money from his growing shipping empire, he tried to buy Major League Baseball’s Cleveland Indians in 1972. That attempt failed, but the next year, he did enter the MLB ownership circle. CBS had purchased the New York Yankees in 1965, but after several years of financial struggles, the TV network sought to sell the club. Thus in 1973, Steinbrenner led a group of wealthy investors, including car executive John DeLorean and oil baron Nelson Bunker Hunt, that bought the Yankees for $8.8 million. Forty-three years later, that Pinstripe franchise, run by Steinbrenner’s sons Hal and Hank since George’s death in 2010, is worth an estimated $7.55 billion, 857 times the initial investment.\nBut back in August of 1960, Steinbrenner wasn’t worried about the Bronx Bombers, just a semi-pro basketball team in Cleveland, as well as a bunch of freighters steaming around on Lake Erie. The Olympic team needed some exhibition games in August prior to departing for Rome, and most of the NBA and college clubs were still months away from starting their practices, so they weren’t available. Instead a tour against AAU and NIBL teams was set up, and Steinbrenner was only too happy to get a couple of games for his Pipers on that slate.\nThe first meeting between the Olympic team and the Pipers came just a few days after West, Robertson and company started practice. Meanwhile, Akers and Bolyard had joined a Pipers’ team that consisted of plenty of former college stars itself, including Lloyd Sharrar, a second-team All-American from WVU (1956-58). Several other players on that Cleveland squad also would eventually play in the NBA, including Ben Warley, John Barnhill and Dan Swartz. Though the NBA had been integrated since 1950, African-American players still were having trouble breaking into that league, so Steinbrenner paid particular attention to products of the historically black colleges. Three of the Pipers – Barnhill, Ron Hamilton and Warley – came from Tennessee State, a historically black college in Nashville that had become a power at the time in the integrated NAIA, winning three straight national championships (1957, 1958 and 1959). Steinbrenner also hired the Tigers’ coach, John McLendon, to guide the Pipers, making the then 45-year-old from Hiawatha, Kansas, the first African-American to serve as the head coach of a professional sports team in the United State. McLendon took charge of the Pipers in the summer of 1960, and he was on the bench for its meetings with the Olympic team that August.\n“John McClendon was an excellent coach,” stated Akers. “I was fortunate to have played for a lot of great coaches, starting with Ray Caldwell in junior high, and then Lewis D’Antoni (at Mullens High School) and Fred Schaus (at WVU), and Coach McClendon was as good as anyone.”\nMcClendon was in charge of the Pipers when they faced the Olympians in Canton on Aug. 6 for their first exhibition game. Before a sellout crowd of more than 4,700 at Canton’s Memorial Auditorium, Cleveland pushed the pace and had a lead until late. The USA squad came back to tie the game at 88-88 at the end of regulation, but the Olympians missed five of their seven shots in the five-minute OT session, and Cleveland came away with a 101-96 victory. It was the first loss ever by a U.S. Olympic basketball team to another amateur squad (technically the Pipers were still amateurs as members of the NIBL, though the term “amateur” was debatable, and within a year, the debate was moot, as Steinbrenner took his program into the pros, joining the ABL).\n“That was a nice win for us,” remembered Akers of his Pipers’ victory over the Olympians in Canton. “But it was their first game, and they had only been practicing a few days. The talent that Olympic team had was incredible. I was glad we got them when we did because I knew it wouldn’t be as easy the next time around.”\nThat next time came four days later in Morgantown. A packed house of 6,500 squeezed into the WVU Field House for the Olympians’ second exhibition contest. This contest featured four former Mountaineers – Akers, Bolyard and Sharrar for Cleveland and West for Team USA. The Pipers were game, but there was no upset this time.\n“Man, they just killed us,” chuckled Akers. “They must have beaten us by 50 points. We couldn’t do anything to slow them down.”\nWillie’s memory was off, but by only a little. The final score was 91-69. “That team was just unreal,” noted Akers.\nThe Pipers shouldn’t have felt too bad because one win was more than anyone else would get off the Olympians. After the twin bill against Cleveland, the USA handily won exhibition games against the Denver Truckers on Aug. 13 in Cincinnati and against the New York Tapers on Aug. 17 in NYC, before a pair of tune-ups in Switzerland, against Lausanne on Aug. 20 and Lugano on Aug. 22. Four days later, the U.S. opened Olympic play at the Palazzetto dello sport in Rome. Host Italy was the first victim (88-54), followed in successive order by Japan (125-66), Hungary (107-63), Yugoslavia (104-42), Uruguay (104-42), USSR (81-57), Italy again in the medal round (112-81) and Brazil in the gold-medal game (90-63).\n“We were all really excited about the Olympics because of Jerry,” noted Akers. “But that was a different time, and TV didn’t broadcast the Olympics then like they do now. Usually all we got from the basketball team were a few highlights. There were newspaper stories, but there wasn’t much in the way of TV coverage. I wish we could have seen more because that team was fun to watch. Nobody could stop them. They rolled over everyone and won the gold.”\nA couple weeks later after standing atop the Olympic podium, West and Robertson joined their respective NBA teams. The former Mountaineer averaged 17.6 points, 7.7 rebounds and 4.2 assists a game as a rookie for the Lakers that year, playing for his old college coach Fred Schaus. West was very good in his first NBA season, but Robertson was phenomenal, averaging nearly a triple-double, as he finished the year averaging 30.5 points, 10.1 rebounds and 9.7 assists per game for the Cincinnati Royals. The Big O was third in the MVP voting at the end of that 1960-61 season, behind only Boston’s Bill Russell and Philadelphia’s Wilt Chamberlain, with L.A.’s Elgin Baylor and West finishing fourth and fifth respectively. Robertson also won the Rookie of the Year balloting.\nAs for the Cleveland Pipers, they continued on as a member of the NIBL through the 1960-61 season, and then moved into the ABL for the 1961-62 campaign. Cleveland won ABL title in that inaugural season, posting a 24-18 mark in the regular season to claim the Eastern Division title. Then in the best-of-five championship round, the Pipers came back from a 2-0 deficit to defeat the Kansas City Steers. By the next year, though, the Pipers had played their last song, as Steinbrenner’s power move with Lucas backfired in his attempt to land a spot in the NBA. The ABL tried to muster on without Cleveland, but mounting debt by many of the franchises forced the league to suddenly close up shop on Dec. 31, 1962, midway through the 1962-63 campaign.\nBy that point, Akers, Bolyard and Sharrar were gone from Cleveland. Sharrar and Bolyard both found their way to another ABL franchise, the Pittsburgh Rens, which played their games in a dungeon-like gym deep in the bowels of Pitt’s football stadium. A native of tiny Aurora, West Virginia, Bolyard averaged 16.2 points a game for the Rens in the 1961-62 season. He moved the Chicago Majors the next year and was averaging 9.5 points a game for that club when the ABL folded 24 games into its second season. Sharrar, a native of Meadville, Pennsylvania, also spent the 1961-62 season with Pittsburgh, but then returned to the industrial teams, playing for Vickers Oil in Wichita and then the Akron Wingfoots, winning several national AAU titles with those clubs before ultimately retiring in 1968, when he settled into an executive position with Goodyear. Sharrar died in 1984 at the age of 47 as the result of brain cancer. As for Bolyard, after he left the ABL he moved into coaching, working as an assistant coach at VMI. He eventually settled into Western Pennsylvania and spent a long time coaching and teaching in the California (Pa.) School District. He died suddenly of a heart attack in 2001 while golfing.\nIn terms of Akers, now 86, his last year as a player came during the 1961-62 season with the Pipers, but he did get a extra little reward.\n“We got off to a pretty good start, 6-0, and Steinbrenner promised if we won the next game, he’d buy us all green jackets – sports coats – with a pipe on it,” Akers recalled. “Well, we won, and he was good to his word. We got the jacket.”\nFree sports coat aside, Willie didn’t have much fun that season. Even though McLendon’s Pipers were doing well, he was relieved of his coaching duties after a midseason slump, and another future Hall of Famer, Bill Sharman, took over. Despite his firing, McLendon had more trails to blaze. He would be hired as the head coach of Cleveland State in 1966, where he again broke the color barrier, becoming the first African-American coach at a predominately white college. After three seasons with the Vikings, he jumped back into professional basketball, becoming the head coach of the ABA’s Denver Rockets in 1969, though he lasted just 28 games with the club before being fired with a 9-19 record. Credited with popularizing both the full-court press and the four-corners offense, McClendon, who died at the age of 84 in 1999, was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame on Sept. 9, 2016.\nWith McLendon gone and Akers confined mainly to the bench, the Pipers traded Willie to the Pittsburgh Rens in the offseason. But newly married, he was looking for some stability. He was approached about becoming the head basketball coach at Logan High School, which was about 60 miles from his southern West Virginia hometown of Mullens, and he jumped at the chance.\n“I thought it was a great opportunity, but I was also naïve,” Akers explained. “First of all, when I got there, I didn’t realize the former coach had been pushed out of the job. He had been 18-2 the year before, and I thought he just left. But apparently it wasn’t that cut and dried. I felt bad about that.\n“Then when I got there, I had a lot to learn,” he continued. “I had been around college coaches and pro coaches; I didn’t realize a high school coach also had to teach. I didn’t know that until I walked into Logan and they handed me a teaching schedule with things like P.E. and driver’s ed. I eventually did about everything – taught biology, worked in administration. You name it, I did it. But I didn’t know I’d have to do anything but coach when I first got there.”\nAkers turned out to be both a very good teacher and an incredible coach, leading the Wildcats to four Class AAA state championships (1963, ’77, ’78 and ’83) and a record of 402-116. He eventually retired from coaching, but he remained in Logan. He served for 1over a decade as an assistant superintendent of schools for Logan County and was also a county commissioner there.\nWillie and his wife Linda remain loyal Mountaineers, attending as many football and basketball games as possible. And they continued to be very close to his former WVU teammate and one-time Olympic exhibition adversary, Jerry West, and his wife Karen, right up until Jerry’s death on June 12, 2024.\n“We were at the football game against Missouri,” recalled Willie of West Virginia’s 2016 opener, “and I got a call from Jerry on my cellphone. He asked where I was, and I told him ‘The football game.’ He said he had just flown in, and I assumed he meant to The Greenbrier (where the Wests had a summer home). But he said, ‘No, we flew into Morgantown.’ I looked up and he’s in one of the boxes above Touchdown Terrace. He tossed me a couple of tickets so we could get in the boxes, and we went up and spent the game with them. It’s always good to see Jerry and Karen. As soon as we get together, it’s like we’re 20 again.”\nAkers and West first met in 1955 while at Boys State, which is a leadership conference for high schoolers held each summer at Jackson’s Mill. The two struck up a friendship at that point, though they would be adversaries later that basketball season when West’s East Bank Pioneers defeated Akers’ Mullens’ Rebels, 77-73, in the semifinals of the Class A (at that time the larger of the state’s two-class system) tournament at the WVU Field House. West would score 39 points in the championship game the next day to lead East Bank to a 71-56 victory over Morgantown High.\n“Everyone knows how good Jerry was, but I don’t think many people realized how hard he worked,” said Akers. “He was the hardest worker I’ve ever seen, whether it was in practice, a game, anytime. We lived right by the Field House, and we’d go over and practice for three hours. I’m tired and ready to leave, and Jerry would say, ‘Just a second, I need a few more shots. His second turned into 30 minutes.\n“Then when we were in practice, he would go 100 percent,” remembered Akers. “Coach Schaus would pull him out for a short break, and Jerry would get mad. This is practice, remember, and usually everyone else was happy to get a rest in practice. Not Jerry. He’d get mad. And remember, Fred was a big ol’ man, but Jerry would get mad. This one time, he took off his jersey and threw it at Fred. Well, Jerry may have been mad, but he wasn’t stupid. Fred started after him, and Jerry took off. Fred never did catch him. But that was Jerry; he worked so hard that he didn’t want to even come out of practice.”\nFor over 60 years, West and Akers remained close friends. For their four years at WVU, they were teammates. And then on two occasions in August of 1960, they were on opposite sides – the U.S. Olympians vs. the Cleveland Pipers. Akers’ club came out on top in Canton, but West’s Team USA got its revenge in Morgantown.\n“I guess that’s the last time we ever played against each other in a real game,” said Akers, drifting back. “I hadn’t really thought about that, but it’s the last time we ever played in a real game together. It’s hard to believe that it’s been so long ago.”",
