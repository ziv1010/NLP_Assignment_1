Jones, who did not allow a run across 16 1/3 innings of Grapefruit League play, is scheduled to make his first major league start on Sunday.\nJones joins a rotation that includes All-Star Mitch Keller, World Series champion Martín Pérez, Marco Gonzales and Luis Ortiz.\nThe Pirates also will be placing right-handed relievers Ryder Ryan and Hunter Stratton on the roster. Jones, Ryan and Stratton were all non-roster invitees to spring training.\nPittsburgh will start the season with right-handed pitchers Carmen Mlodzinski and Colin Holderman, catcher Yasmani Grandal and infielder/outfielder Ji Hwan Bae on the injured list.\nThe Pirates optioned right-handed starter Quinn Priester, who made eight starts in the majors last season, to Triple-A Indianapolis.\nPittsburgh also reassigned several players to minor league camp, including former New York Yankees pitcher Domingo Germán, who pitched a perfect game last season, and former Detroit Tigers pitcher Wily Peralta.",
