Every Friday.\nSubscribe Here!More in General\nThe Latest\nSure, Nebraska football did not go bowling, but despite that, this was a good year for Nebraska sports which is kind of fun!\nWhy not? It’s a free newsletter!\nNebraska week on OTE continues with a quick aside on the athletic department at Nebraska. If you would like to read an overall preview of Nebraska, feel free to check out our Cocktail Party Preview from yesterday, and don’t forget to add your questions to the mailbag post so that your Nebraska ‘writers’ can show you how witty and brilliant we are (or aren’t... at least in my case. I’m definitely the least witty of the three).\nWhen Nebraska hired Trev Alberts as AD back in 2021, it was widely seen as one of those “Well, you didn’t try that hard, now did you” moves. His only experience in higher education to that point was up the road at very-recently-D1 Omaha (fka University of Nebraska, Omaha). And, what had he done there?\nWell, the history is murkier than the commenting public would like to believe. On one hand, he elevated Omaha to D1, secured a spot in a relatively safe and regionally sane conference (the Summit), made inroads to building an on-campus hockey arena for the crown jewel sport, and made soccer and basketball a thing that would be worth attending. To do this, he also killed a bunch of sports including football (conspiracy theorists claim this was at the regents’ behest which is absurd), and wrestling (which honestly might have been personal but also Title IX problems were well known across the University).\nThat he is now off to Texas A&M, it’s worth evaluating what he did in his short stint in Lincoln, but one of the things that seems pretty apparent is that he did seem to elevate Nebraska sports across the board. Now, jokes aside about football - and oh boy are there jokes to be had - you have to admit that Alberts has seemingly left Nebraska in a better spot than he found it. One of the key areas he said he wanted to improve was Nebrska’s overall standing in the Directors Cup, and boy did he... While it’s quite likely that Nebraska will not finish in the Top Ten just due to its lack of Spring qualifying sports, what they did through Winter was downright impressive, finishing 7th overall.\nFor context, dating back to its entrance into the Big Ten, Nebraska has finished Top 25 once - its second year in the conference - and has been hoovering in the 30s and 40s, even flirting with 50, which is less than ideal for a school with this much money. So, how did they do it? Well, primarily by scoring in almost every sport that was available. Men’s and Women’s Basketball (both received points for making NCAA tournament), Women’s Bowling (5th overall), Men’s and Women’s Gymnastics (Men finished 4th overall, Women made tournament), Rifle (8th), Women’s Swimming (30th), Men’s and Women’s Indoor Track and Field (25th and 12th respectively), and Men’s Wrestling (9th).\nThat’s... easily the best Nebraska has done when you add in the Fall sports of Women’s Volleyball (2nd), and Women’s Soccer (5th). For the Spring, they will place in Men’s and Women’s Outdoor Track and Field but likely that’s about it, but still, this was a really good year for Nebraska sports, and a good sign for what they can be in the new Big Ten.\nI honestly am unsure of what new AD Troy Dannen intends to do to push Nebraska forward. Be it facilities, new coaches, or whatever else it is ADs do, but I think it’s cool to see Nebraska pushing forward in all sports. If the football team can start pulling its weight more and win some games, it’ll be a really exciting time to be a fan of Nebraska... which is saying something because it’s generally been pretty annoying for a while now.\nSee More:\nLoading comments\nGetting the conversation ready...",
