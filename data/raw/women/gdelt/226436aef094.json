We can't keep developing players and giving them to other teams, that's not happening anymore, we want a WSL licence.\"\nRunning from under-5s through to their Northern Championships side, City have had a 200 per cent increase in female participation.\nDescribing themselves as the biggest junior club in the state, they have 600 juniors across 65 teams.\nLinger confirmed the club intend to keep its women's Northern Championships side in operation should they enter the statewide competition.\nThe side are fourth on the six-team ladder this season, having won seven of their 19 games - improving on last year's result under new coaches.\n\"They've done a wonderful job, working right across the mental health and the diet to develop these girls and take the next step,\" he said.\n\"We are still about mid-table but we've got some talent that want to come back and play that are playing in other areas and we need to get this licence to give them that opportunity.\"",
