At full time on Saturday week in Clogher, in the Senior League Division 1B, Ballintubber and Westport played out a 0-18 to 1-15 draw. It was a top-class club encounter and while the Westport team deserve great credit for pulling back a 7 point deficit late on – some of the “’Tubber boys of the old brigade” deserve a special mention. In goal, the wily old silver fox Padraic O’Connor pulled off three tremendous saves and his kick outs were of the highest order. Wing back Michael Plunkett was the outstanding player on the field with three super two pointers to cap an overall brilliant display. At midfield the evergreen Jason Gibbons and his opposite number Conor McGraynor fought a ferocious fight for primary possession in what was a real battle of the midfield Goliaths! Up front Cillian O’Connor with his assured wily connivance was a vital cog in the Ballintubber wheel contributing 0-6. Ballintubber had many other notable performances also and seem to be achieving a nice balance between the club elder players and young aspirants.

January’s Storm Éowyn was very severe on people, buildings, trees and forests, but it hasn’t prevented work identifying boulders to fit in a geodiversity trail in Tourmakeady Woods. This walk, funded by Geological Survey Ireland, is a partnership with Coillte and the local Coiste Pobail Thuar Mhic Éadaigh. It is being implemented by the Geopark in association with Comharchumann Dhúiche Sheoigheach Teo. Quarries and some other landowners in the Geopark region are generously providing boulders of particular rock types for the trail. The walk will consist of 10 to 12 boulders of distinct rock types set at intervals along the 500m walk from the Woods carpark to Tourmakeady Waterfall with a small information panel beside each. There will also be additional panels identifying various native species present in this People’s Millennium Forest. The development will strengthen the link Tourmakeady, and other communities, have with the wider Geopark and develop the woods further for education and enjoyment.\n**************\nThe elected members of Castlebar Municipal area met in Belcarra Community Centre for their monthly meeting last week.
