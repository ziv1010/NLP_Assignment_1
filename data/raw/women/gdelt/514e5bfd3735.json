Dismissed.\nFor you see, of all the sacrosanct rules, the one against entering the field of play to get involved in a melee not your own is, and always has been, the Cardinal, the one whose ring all the other rules had to kiss. (Yes, I know a bit strained, but it’s late in the Parisian night, and I can see Notre Dame. I think it works, so there.)\nWhich brings us to Cam Murray being sin-binned in Origin III for his involvement in the brawl, despite not even being on the field at the time. He had to go, I think. But...\nBut Murray didn’t go onto the field of play. It all happened on the same sideline he was already on. There might be an argument – admittedly a very technical one! – that if you bring the fight to my house, I can defend it.\nDiscuss.\nRelax my rugby brethren, it’s OK to praise league\nTFF received a few expressions of surprise this week on how highly I rated the Origin III game after I wrote in my column that “This was Origin at its very best, and football as good as it gets.” Many thought it disloyal to my alma mater of rugby union, blah, blah, blah.\nI stand by it. While my usual theorem is that while nothing is so dull as a dull rugby game, there is nothing so fabulous as a great rugby game, this particular Origin match was up there with the 1989 grand final between Canberra and Balmain as a great sporting spectacle – one genuinely to remember as opposed to the usual burbling every Origin series that it was unforgettable. For those who saw it, Origin III 2024 will be chiselled into our consciousness for years to come. NSW-LANDER!\nCauchemar: Paris’ Olympic traffic will test us all\nI reckon Matthew Lynn of the UK Telegraph must be reading my column. Take it away, Matthew: “In reality, the Olympics needs a radical rethink. It is a great spectacle of sport, and a test of the limits of human endurance, and achievement. It should be an inspiring spectacle that the whole world can unite around.\n“But the travelling jamboree of staging the event in a different city every four years is becoming more and more untenable, with the cost rising all the time, and with visitors and sponsors becoming more and more wary of the way that congestion and security will make it too difficult to travel to any of the events.”\nSpeaking of which … I can faithfully report that while Paris is as splendid as ever, and looking good, the traffic is more akin to a full stop than even an ellipsis, let alone an exclamation mark. It took me two hours to get from Place de La Concorde to my hotel, in a trip that usually takes 20 minutes. You might recall that in Sydney to get to the Olympic Stadium in 2000 you pretty much had to get there by bus or train, as private vehicles and even taxis were given no access.\nIn Paris, with the venues dotted all over the city, no such rule is possible. Perhaps they have a plan to sort this once the gun goes off, but right now it is chaos and the frustration of the visitors is outdone only by that of the locals. Let us all hope it will be all right on the night.\nTorrie speaks of freedom at top speed\nThe two brightest shining stars in the Australian athletics team are Jessica Hull, who I interviewed last week, and Torrie Lewis, who I interviewed this week. Lewis, just 19 years old, is burning up the track and though she holds the Australian record for the women’s 100 metres, at these Games she will be focusing her attentions on the 200 metres event. For the interview, which will be published in full on Sunday, I asked her what it feels like to be motoring at full speed when everything is working perfectly, and she is in overdrive. Here is a small burst of her replies.\nTL: It’s … it’s just ... really a moment of freedom like you can’t get from anything else. It’s like your mind is not really saying anything, but you’re just ... free. It’s hard to describe, but you just feel so fit and strong, like your mind isn’t really doing anything, it’s just blank and what’s left is this feeling of just being so super strong.\nFitz: So now that you’ve made it, broken the Australian record for the 100 metres and been selected, can you believe it, and believe that you’re an Olympian? Does it feel like you are living the dream?\nTL: Yeah, yeah. I knew I could make it and I knew I was gonna make it. So yeah, it wasn’t unbelievable to me. Other people have been surprised, but this is precisely what I was going after and as my times kept coming down, I was more and more confident that I would get there. So I don’t have that sort of “pinch me” thing. It is what I have worked towards, and I felt I was going to get there. But I don’t just want to be an Olympian, I want to be a successful one.\nBig Darrell opened doors for Rabs\nRay Warren was inducted into Suncorp Stadium’s Media Hall of Fame this week. Via a taped message the great man recounted his experience on his first night of broadcasting from the-then Lang Park, when a security guard asked him for the very pass he did not have, before recognition struck: “Are you Darrell Eastlake?”\nRay Warren: “Yes I am.”\nSecurity guard: “I love your work.”\nGo forth!\nWhat they said\nHaumole Olakau’atu – NSW’s 19th man on Wednesday – on why, despite being dressed in chinos and a navy suit jacket, he waded into the sideline melee during Origin III: “There was more maroon than blue, so I was just being a friend. I wanted to help a brother out...” Oh. As you were then, and carry on!\nAfter an … interesting, and certainly … original rendition of The Star Spangled Banner at the MLB Home Run Derby on Monday, country singer Ingrid Andress apologised on Tuesday: “I’m not gonna bullshit y’all, I was drunk last night. I’m checking myself into a facility today to get the help I need. That was not me last night. I apologise to MLB, all the fans, and this country I love so much for that rendition. I’ll let y’all know how rehab is I hear it’s super fun. xo, Ingrid.”\nTiger Woods responding at the British Open to Colin Montgomerie’s call for him to retire: “Well, as a past [Open] champion, I’m exempt until I’m 60. Colin’s not. He’s not a past champion, so he’s not exempt. So he doesn’t get the opportunity to make that decision. I do.”\nNovak Djokovic, on his former public nemesis Nick Kyrgios who did a great job commentating through Wimbledon: “He’s very positive. It’s nice to see him full of life, full of energy. He’s really pumped to be here in Wimbledon, enjoying our practice sessions and commentating. He’s an extremely important guy for our sport. I think he brings new fans.”\nNewcastle coach Adam O’Brien after his Knights were crushed by Manly: “I don’t believe that’s who we are any more but that’s where we were tonight and we need to fix it. It’s not all on the players, it’s me too.” Mighty big of you, Tex.\nEnglishman Dan Thomas, after getting an “ENGLAND EURO 2024 WINNERS” tattoo before the final, won of course by Spain: “We came close, I don’t regret the tattoo. If anything, I don’t think it’d be hard to change the four into an eight in four years’ time. I won’t be covering it up. Absolutely no regrets and I still love it.”\nAfter Spain’s victory, the team returned home where, on stage in front of a massive crowd in Madrid’s Plaza de Cibeles, the national captain, Alvaro Morata, and midfielder Rodri chanted: “Gibraltar es espanol!” When Morata playfully reminded Rodri that he plays for an English side – Manchester City – the latter replied: “No me importa.” (I don’t care.)\nCharlie Eccleshare in the New York Times, following Carlos Alcaraz’s Wimbledon victory over Novak Djokovic: “Beating the greatest-ever champion and escapologist in men’s tennis, having just coughed up championship points, took all the cojones of his tennis trifecta, alongside his cabeza [head] and corazon [heart].”\nCarlos Alcaraz was asked to predict how many grand slam titles he might win: “I don’t know my limit. But at the end of my career, I want to sit at the same table as the big guys.”\nRory McIlroy still coming to terms with his US Open meltdown: “I play 23-25 [events] per year. You have to keep going. The great thing about this game is you have an opportunity to get back on the horse right after a tough loss. You try to learn from it and do better next time.” He didn’t, at least not after his first day at the British Open, where he finished seven-over, 13 strokes off the lead.\nGerman ex-F1 driver Ralf Schumacher’s caption to a photo of him and his partner Etienne on his Instagram account: “The most beautiful thing in life is when you have the right partner by your side with whom you can share everything.” He is the third driver in F1 to come out as gay since the competition began in 1950.\nTeam of the week\nThe NSW blues. That is that strange, eerie feeling you get when the Blues actually do in the Origin.\nAFL. A strange ladder with Hawthorn in 13th spot, just a single win outside the top eight.\nMatildas. They kick off our Olympics campaign next Thursday (Friday, 1am AEST), with a match against Germany, the day before the Opening Ceremony on the Seine.\nWallabies. Take on Georgia on Saturday afternoon in Sydney, after beginning the season with two strong wins against Wales.\nSpain. Won the men’s Euros, men’s Wimbledon and SailGP on a magical day for them.\nCarlos Alcaraz. At just 21, is missing only the Australian Open to complete the set and is just the sixth male in the open era to do the French-Wimbledon double in the one year.\nRIP David Morrow. Renowned sports commentator, and particularly rugby league caller, passed away this week at the age of 71.\nRIP Mike Colman. TFF was very sorry to hear of the passing of the long-time News Corp and before that Fairfax sports columnist last weekend, aged 68. Great bloke, very colourful writer. The Herald sends its deepest condolences to his wife Linda, and three children.\nFor Olympics news, results and expert analysis sent daily throughout the Games, sign up for our Sport newsletter.",
