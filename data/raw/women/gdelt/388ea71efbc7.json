  "body_text": "West Alabama Thursday Briefing\nGood morning West Alabama. it is Thursday, December 12, 2024.\nThursday Morning Observations:\nThe internet is one of the greatest inventions ever! The internet is one of the most dangerous inventions ever! Both of those statements are correct. Both statements are accurate.\nIn a comparatively very short time in history. The computers and the internet have changed how we live. We shop, meet people, learn, get information and entertain ourselves differently. That is both good and bad.\nThe good is you have an enormous library of information and resources just a few clicks away. The bad is not all the information available is accurate, reliable or trustworthy and clicking on the wrong site can leave you vulnerable to malware.\nThe good is you can keep up with current news and events as they happen. The bad is fake news, internet sites and apps used to spread negative and false messages.\nThe good is you can bank and shop online. The bad is these sites can be hacked, or you access a fake website and compromise your money and personal information.\nThe good is availability of social media to meet new people, keep in contact with friends and be entertained. The bad is not everyone is who they say they are, not all entertainment is innocent fun and it gives an opening to cyberbullying.\nThe good is the internet provides countless ways to be entertained without leaving home. The bad is it can become addictive and result in isolation.\nThe good is internet accessibility is mobile allowing connectivity via our PCs, laptops, tablets and phones. The bad is our mobile devices make us more vulnerable to hacking and too often causes us to miss out on reality by providing virtual reality.\nThe bottom line is to use the internet safely:\n- Don’t share personal information. Theis can make you vulnerable to all sorts of threats.\n- Don’t download from untrustworthy sources. Check the URLs for accuracy. Clicking on untrustworthy sources can lead to downloading trojan horses, viruses and spyware.\n- Do avoid suspicious attachments. They could contain malicious links and malware.\n- Do avoid using public access wi-fi, it is not secure.\n- Do use strong passwords with double authentication.\n- Do use VPN and firewalls.\n- Do use anti-virus software.\nDuring the holidays the internet reaches high usage, but it should be used safely. The internet is like driving. It is convenient and takes you places quickly but if you don’t do it safely it can lead to tragic, long-term negative consequences.\n(Opinions expressed in Morning Briefing are not necessarily those of the ownership, management or staff of Townsquare Media Tuscaloosa.)\nWeather:\nThose eternal optimists that hope for a white Christmas each year look to be out of luck, again. The 8-to-14-day outlook reveals near normal temperatures and below normal precipitation possibilities.\nThe rain has helped roll the drought across most of West Alabama back to Abnormally Dry according to the new Drought Monitor released this morning. However, Moderate to Severe Drought conditions continue to hang on in southern Greene, Hale, Perry and Sumter counties and across all of Marengo County.\nThe Forecast:\nTopping the News:\nTuscaloosans will soon lose one of its locations to obtain driver's licenses. Effective Monday, Dec. 23, driver’s license transactions will no longer be processed at the Tuscaloosa County License Office in Spiller Market Center located on Skyland Boulevard.\nLicenses will remain available at three other sites at the main Tuscaloosa County License Office at 2501 7th St., Suite 100, the ALEA post located at: 2645 Skyland Blvd. E. in Tuscaloosa and the Northport office at 3500 McFarland Blvd. in city hall.\nThe ribbon will be cut at 4:00 this afternoon in advance of a reception marking the opening of the new Benjamin Barnes YMCA in West End. Located at 3011 Martin Luther King Blvd. at the McDonald Hughes Center; the new facility replaces the previous branch that was aging, inadequate and suffered from infrastructure problems.\nConstruction began on the new $10 million facility is 2023.\nThe murder of the United Healthcare CEO in New York last week has placed the problems with healthcare in the U.S. at the forefront of public interest. At greatest risk is the health of those living in rural areas where hospitals have closed and ambulance services struggle to stay in business.\nA rural healthcare forum recently at Stillman College highlighted the plight in West Alabama. The picture immerging is not a pretty one. ADPH revealed some concerning statistics. Seven percent of the counties in the state don’t have a hospital. Additionally, 28% of the women living in rural areas don’t live within 30 minutes of a hospital with birthing services.\nGovernor Kay Ivey has joined 25 other governors in supporting President-Elect Trump's immigration policies.\nBelow is a portion of the statement released by the governors...\n“As Republican governors, we stand united in support of President Donald Trump’s unwavering commitment to make America safe again by addressing the illegal immigration crisis and deporting illegal immigrants who pose a threat to our communities and national security.\nThe statement noted that GOP Governors mobilized, \"...state resources, including law enforcement and National Guard units, to protect Americans from disastrous open border policies and prevent illegal immigration from overwhelming our country.\"\nTopping Sports News:\nAs head coach Kalen DeBoer predicted, it looks like most of the Alabama Football Team will play in the Reliaquest Bowl against Michigan on New Year's Eve.
