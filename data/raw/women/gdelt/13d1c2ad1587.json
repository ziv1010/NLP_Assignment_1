Ella Brennan captained the side from right-half back and turned in her usual top-class performance as she drove her side on with typical energy and commitment from her wing back position. Clodagh made her competitive debut when she came on in the second half and acquitted herself very well as Mayo put their opposition to the sword with a very commanding display. Julia Gawalkevicz was the replacement goalkeeper and took her place on the bench as Mayo played some quality football to dismiss the challenge of Wexford with ease.\nMayo, led by Ella, were on the front foot from the throw-in and had too much quality in every line of the pitch for a Wexford team that never really got to the pitch of the battle. Mayo’s display was laced with promise as they look to bounce back to the top division with this performance giving their new manager Diane O’Hora plenty to enthuse over as they look to back it up in the remainder of their games in a division they look to have a right good shot at winning.\nThe death took place at St Attracta’s Residence, Hagfield, Charlestown of Kathleen Brennan Cloonlyon, Charlestown.

The boys were full value for their victory as they bossed the game from the tip-off and dominated in every facet of the play. This victory owed much to their resilience and teamwork as it did to their skill and ability and keeps them nicely positioned in the top half of the table very much in contention for a place in the play-offs as they continue to improve with each and every outing.\nThe U12 boys suffered a narrow defeat to Westport in their latest outing in U12 league but they did the club and themselves proud at the manner of their fine display as they pushed the home side to the wire and left everything on the court and were unlucky not to have taken something from a rip-roaring contest as both teams threw everything at it in their pursuit of victory.\nThe open day at Cloonlyon National School takes place on Friday, February 13, from 9.30am-4pm.

Governor Gus had plenty to occupy his mind in his role as match referee but, as ever, he wasn’t fazed at what played out before him and kept both men in check impeccably. The Duke had a real swagger about his play early doors as he surged into a two-set lead with some razor sharp throwing. He hit every treble and double that came his way with unerring accuracy with the Magician unable to keep pace such was the form being exhibited by the number two seed.\nThe Magician needed to look deep into his cauldron at the start of the third set in the hope of finding some sort of a response but it was slow in coming as the Duke continued on the rampage into set three. He grabbed the first two legs to leave him just one away from victory as McGowan struggled to find any kind of a response and looked odds on to be whitewashed with the Duke in no mood to offer any kind of an olive branch. From nowhere, however, the Magician found some inspiration and rattled off the next two legs to set up a single leg shootout to decide the fate of the set. The Duke, stunned at the loss of the two previous legs, took his anger out on the board as he galloped to the double at breakneck pace in the fifth and final leg to put himself in prime position to close out the match. The Magician wasn’t far behind, it must be said, but it proved futile as the Duke took out 128 with some aplomb with his final dart landing plum in the middle of the double ten bed to set in train great celebrations in his camp as he clinched his second title of the season.\nThe Magician was as magnanimous as ever in defeat but he can have few complaints as the Duke was a most worthy winner and remains in a rich vein of form as he enjoys his best start to the season in many a long year.\n*****************\nKilmovee.\nThe death took place of Tommy Regan, Egool, Kilmovee, and Kiltimagh Road, Swinford, on January 9, in Mayo University Hospital, Castlebar, surrounded by his family. Tommy was the third eldest of a family of seven born to Michael and the late Josephine Regan (nee McCormack).\nThe practice of his faith was very important to Tommy and he was very popular in the area. Tommy attended Kilmovee NS, and later the Vocational School in Ballaghaderreen. Following on from this he served his apprenticeship as a mechanic. At the age of 21 years he was involved in a traffic accident which resulted in life changing circumstances for Tommy but rather than bemoan his situation, he accepted and carried his cross with courage and positivity that was truly inspirational to all. Tommy was rightly described as a true gentleman, warm, generous and very appreciative, very supportive, a wonderful son, brother, and friend who loved to stay connected, and his mobile phone was very instrumental for him to keep in touch with his family and his legion of friends.\nTommy was predeceased by his mother Josephine, niece Aoife, and sister-in-law Marie. Tommy reposed in the Sharkey Funeral Home, Ballaghaderreen on Monday, January 13, and removal took place from his home on Tuesday, January 14, at 11.30am to the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Kilmovee, arriving for Mass of the Resurrection at 12 noon, followed by interment in Naomh Mobhí cemetery.\nTommy is survived by his father Michael, brothers Hubert, Gerry, Michael and Vincent, sisters Kathy and Eileen, aunt Sr. Eileen, nephews, nieces, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, relatives, neighbours and friends. May Tommy rest in peace as sympathy is extended to his family relatives and to all who mourn his passing.\nKilmovee NS are now accepting enrolments for the school year 2026/27.
