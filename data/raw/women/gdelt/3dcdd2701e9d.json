Berry was sinbinned for sliding into Brisbane winger Kerri Johnson with her knees in the Broncos' 30-6 victory at WIN Stadium on Sunday.\nCronulla's Jaydika Tafua is also faces a two-to-three match suspension after being charged with Grade 3 Dangerous Contact for a hip drop tackle on Wests Tigers winger Claudie Nielson in the Sharks' 20-16 win on Sunday.\nThe inaugural NRLW Magic Round is being staged at McDonald Jones Stadium on Saturday.\nThree consecutive games will be played both days. The Knights are chasing a fourth successive win when they host winless Canberra in the middle game on Sunday (1.45pm)\nKnights' attack fires to make it three on the trot\nThe Knights are headed back to Newcastle for Magic Round on a three-game winning run after beating Parramatta 30-6 at Eric Tweedale Stadium on Sunday for their biggest victory of the season.\nNewcastle have been building nicely since an opening-round blemish, in which they succumbed 26-12 to fired-up newcomers Canterbury, and were left in a three-way tie for second spot on the ladder following the 24-point win.\nLast year, the Knights strung back-to-back wins together on multiple occasions but were inconsistent and never managed to extend their runs beyond two results.\nA week after beating New Zealand Warriors 36-20, their attack again fired - the Knights had five different tryscorers.\nBut, importantly, it was arguably Newcastle's best defensive display this campaign.\n\"They were really patient, and earned their way to victory by just doing the hard stuff,\" Knights coach Ben Jeffries said.\n\"We showed a lot of resilience on our tryline, held them up a couple of times, and looked really connected in defence.\n\"They're really enjoying their football at the moment and they just keep building.\n\"That was probably the result we were looking for last week, we just let a couple of late tries in [against the Warriors].\"\nJesse extends record run\nHalfback Jesse Southwell again pulled the strings, and extended her NRLW record of most consecutive conversions to 20 with another 100 per cent showing.\nBut the whole spine was impressive.\nBotille Vette-Walsh had big shoes to fill following the departure of superstar fullback Tamika Upton but has found her feet beautifully at the Knights and is looking more impressive with each outing.\nOn Sunday, the experienced 28-year-old clocked 162 run metres, made one line break to set up an almost length-of-the field try for lightning-quick winger Tess Staines and had two try assists.\nStaines left NSW fullback Abbi Church in her wake as she powered to the try line in the 12th minute after Vette-Walsh busted through the Eels from her own try line and offloaded to her winger.\n\"That was probably her best performance, Bo,\" Jeffries said.\n\"We did a lot of work on Rachael Pearson and her kicking game. They've scored a lot of tries off their kicks and we nullified that today.\"\nThe Knights' second try also came quickly on the counter.\nSouthwell wrapped up a Rachael Pearson bomb in her own in-goal then sprinted to take a quick tap. Before the Eels had time to reset, the Knights No.7 had her team within striking range.\nSouthwell and five-eighth Georgia Roche then combined with killer long passes to find Tenika Willison on the left edge. The New Zealand rugby sevens star stepped inside three Parramatta players to score in the 24th minute.\nWinger Sheridan Gallagher produced a try-saving tackle on Eels centre Rory Owen, who had proved a handful one week earlier in Parramatta's big win over Canberra, with seven minutes left in the first half.\nStaines and second-rower Evah McEwen, who was put on report late in the game for an alleged hair pull, also diffused attacking threats on their try line as Newcastle withstood a mountain of pressure in the finals stages of the first half to hold a 12-0 advantage at the break.\nEels enforcer Elsie Albert, who produced 187 run metres, looked to have been held up on the try line five minutes into the second half but a bunker review found the Papua New Guinea international had found some paint with the ball.\nPearson's conversion closed the gap to 12-6 and the Eels kept coming.\nNewcastle scrambled, and scrambled well to keep their opponents to six points.\nSouthwell produced a trysaving tackle from behind on a runaway Albert before Knights captain Yasmin Clydsdale, who clocked an incredible 202 run metres, bamboozled several Eels players to step and spin her way to the try line in the 46th minute.\nRoche had Taneka Todhunter held up over the line with 18 minutes to go as the Eels applied pressure with repeat sets within striking range.\nGallagher, who threw a scare into Newcastle camp when she went down in the first half clutching at her left ankle, was put away in the right corner by Vette-Walsh in the 55th minute.\nKayla Romaniuk iced the win when the grubber kick of hooker Olivia Higgins bounced favourably for the Knights lock to score from close range with five minutes remaining.\nSouthwell finished the match with five from five conversions.\nNewcastle will now host to the NRLW's inaugural Magic Round next weekend, where all six competition games will be played over Saturday and Sunday.\nThe Knights are pitted against Canberra on Sunday (1.45pm).",
