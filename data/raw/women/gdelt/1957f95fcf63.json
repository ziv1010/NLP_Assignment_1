  "body_text": "With the Women's Euros now upon us, there's an exciting new era for the England Lionesses as they prepare to defend the title they won in 2022.\nThis year's squad features several new faces, including the promising 19-year-old striker, Michelle Agyemang. Born on 3 February 2006, she is already considered a rising star in women's football.\nAs the young footballer gears up for England's first game on Saturday 5 July, you might be wondering about the London-born star's life away from the spotlight. Here's what we know…\nWho is Michelle Agyemang?\nThe English-born forward, of Ghanaian descent, grew up in Essex, where football was woven into daily life.\nHer father coached at a grassroots level, and her brother also played.\nWhile Michelle is a lifelong and dedicated Arsenal fan, loyalties were split in their household – her father is a Manchester United fan; her brother, who Michelle likes to claim she's \"definitely better than\" now, follows Chelsea; and her sister supports West Ham.\nMeanwhile, her mother \"supports anyone\" to keep the peace.\nLife before playing for England\nIt was only in 2021 that Michelle was actually a ballgirl at Wembley, watching from the sidelines as the Lionesses played against Northern Ireland.\nThis match, which England won 4-0, also happened to be Sarina Wiegman’s first Wembley game as England's head coach – little did Michelle know she'd be playing under the head coach four years later.\nA future off the pitch\nBeyond football, Michelle is also pursuing her education.\nShe is currently studying Business Management at King's College London, balancing her demanding professional football career with her academic pursuits.\nFrom Arsenal to England\nMichelle has been at Arsenal since the age of six and quickly progressed through the ranks, making her senior Arsenal debut at the age of 16 in November 2022.\nShe signed her first professional contract with the club in May 2024 and still plays as a forward for Arsenal in the Women's Super League (WSL).\nMichelle is also the youngest player to join the England squad, and she made her debut with a goal just 41 seconds after coming off the bench in a match against Belgium in April.\nThis impressive impact earned her a place in England's squad for the UEFA Euro 2025 tournament, marking a significant milestone in her burgeoning career.\nEllen White – the Lionesses' goalscorer – described Michelle as \"a phenomenal talent\".\n\"Take her to the Euros,\" she said in April. \"There is some excitement, something different and something fresh.\"\nAll three seasons of the Italian detective series, Lolita Lobosco, are available to stream on Channel 4 now, via its offshoot streaming service, Walter Presents",
