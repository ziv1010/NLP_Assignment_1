Debt is the road to ruin.\n“Sir Matt Busby would be turning in his grave at the current plight of one of the world’s greatest football institutions which is being brought to its knees and in many ways becoming a laughing stock.”\nA separate protest was organised by the Manchester United Supporters’ Trust at Sunday’s FA Cup fifth-round tie against Fulham.\nIt joined forces with the Fulham Supporters’ Trust to protest against ticket pricing outside Old Trafford, then displayed banners inside the ground as the teams walked out onto the pitch.\nFA Cup holders United went on to lose that match on penalties, compounding a miserable season that sees them a lowly 14th in the Premier League standings.\nThe Red Devils return to action at Real Sociedad in Thursday’s Europa League last-16 first leg, with that competition providing their last shot at silverware and only realistic route to European qualification.\nHaving accounted for progress to the Champions League knockout phase for years, the PA news agency understands financial modelling for next term includes the prospect of missing European football entirely.\nA post shared by Real Sociedad de Fútbol (@realsociedad)\nUnited have lost more than £300million over the past three seasons and last week announced there would be 200 further redundancies having shed 250 jobs last summer.\nUnited did not wish to comment when contacted by PA but pointed to chief executive Omar Berrada’s recent comments.\n“We have a responsibility to put Manchester United in the strongest position to win across our men’s, women’s and academy teams,” he said after the club announced another round of redundancies.\n“We are initiating a wide-ranging series of measures which will transform and renew the club.”",
