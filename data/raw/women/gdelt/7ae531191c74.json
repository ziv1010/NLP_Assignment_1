  "body_text": "Former Spanish Football Federation Chief, Luis Rubiales went to trial on February 3 2025 over an incident that took place at the Women’s World Cup 2023. The incident involved Spanish Women’s football player Jennifer Hermoso, with the event being broadcasted all over the world, sparking outrage. It involved Rubiales kissing Hermoso on the lips as the Spanish Women’s Team collected their medals, just having won the Women’s World Cup. The kiss could have been missed with the blink of an eye but in the aftermath has been seen by the world over.\nThe trial, concluded February 14 and awaiting verdict, has seen prosecutors seeking a two-and-a-half years prison sentence for Rubiales. This is not just for the non consensual kiss with Hermoso, but also for the alleged coercion of Hermoso after the incident took place by Rubiales and the Spanish federation to play down what had happened. Within this, three colleagues of Rubiales have also gone to trial over alleged coercion, including Jorge Vilda (former coach and manager of the Spanish Women’s National team), Ruben Rivera (the federation’s former head of marketing) and Albert Luque (former sporting director).\nIn response to prosecutors, Rubiales and his defense team have argued that whilst his behaviour was perhaps inappropriate, it was not criminal, with Rubiales pleading that the kiss was consensual. Part of the defense has included videos of Hermoso partying and celebrating that same evening after the kiss, justifying the case that she was not upset over what had happened. This defense of Rubiales is absurd and extremely far-reaching, calling into question why he felt the need to kiss Hermoso in the first place. For a player who made her debut in 2012, 11 years before finding silverware on an international level, she had every right to celebrate with her team because shock does not equate to consent.\nThis is due to the fact that the now infamous ‘kiss’ which took place in 2023 was the cherry on top of an accumulation of misgivings perpetrated by the Spanish Federation towards the Spanish Women’s international team. In 2022, after the Women’s Euros, the Women’s team went to the Federation with a list of grievances. These included the training facilities and tactics used by the coaches, as well as the authoritarian nature of the team’s manager Jorge Vilda. This resulted in 15 players, who were a part of the national team at Euro 2022 sending a letter to the Federation asking not to be called up, and they subsequently were not. With key players like Ballon D’or winners standing their ground against the Federation, this illustrates the extent to which the situation and conditions for this team were in dire straits.\nTherefore the actions of Rubiales can be seen as part of a wider institutional problem within the Spanish Football Federation. Not only is it a further display of misuse of power within the Federation, but it unequivocally demonstrates the lack of respect afforded to players within the Spanish Women’s National Team. Both Rubiales and Vilda have since left the Federation as a result of the charges made against them by not only the team, but also legally. However they did not leave willingly and cooperatively, revealing the arrogance and narcissistic nature of these individuals.\nWhat took place in 2023, which is now on trial, brings to light many different things. The biggest impact it had was towards the players themselves. The Spanish Women’s National Team in the World Cup 2023 had won their first ever international competition, and what should have been a lasting legacy of success and enjoyment was completely overshadowed by an abuse of power. The incident completely tarnished the victory of the team, whereby the actions of a selfish and egotistical man have marred the crowning achievement of a group of women. Instead of the front cover of newspapers being Spanish player Olga Carmona scoring the winning goal, like Chloe Kelly the day after Euro 2022, it was rather of the ‘kiss’.\nNot only does this trial stress the dishonour given to the Spanish Women’s National Team, it further sheds light onto the all too common experiences of women. Sexual assault and sexual harrassment have become somewhat normalised in society, whereby 1 in 4 women have been raped or sexually assaulted since the age of 16. This reinforces how as events unfolded Hermoso did not immediately recognise what had actually taken place, but when the world was able to see it on replay, it became all too clear that it should never have happened in the first place.\nThe actions of Rubiales and the subsequent trial should be an example for the world. The legal fallout taking place emphasises that not only do actions have consequences, but that more should be done to protect women from those in power. It should illustrate that these players and women should be given the respect they deserve, and hopefully justice will prevail in this case.\nSubsequently it was announced February 20 that Rubiales was found guilty of sexual assault against Hermoso and has been ordered to pay a fine of €10,000. He was also served with a 200-meter restraining order from Hermoso and has been banned from communicating with her for one year. The other colleagues who were on trial have been acquitted.",
