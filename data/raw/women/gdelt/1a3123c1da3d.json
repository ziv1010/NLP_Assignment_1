Trailing 2-0 at half-time, our Gunners came storming out of the gates after the break, levelling the scoreline through Cloe Lacasse and Alessia Russo by the 52nd minute.\nGoals from Caitlin Foord, Victoria Pelova and Stina Blackstenius followed suit before Lina Hurtig popped up in injury time to make it six.\nour opposition\nAfter flirting with relegation last season, the Foxes kicked off this campaign with a commendable point away to Liverpool. Their top scorer last season, Jutta Rantala, struck on the counter with a well-taken goal.\nLeicester City strengthened in the transfer window, adding Noemie Mouchon from Reims and Asmita Ale from Tottenham Hotspur. Former Gunner Ruby Mace also joined their ranks permanently after her loan last season.\nAmandine Miquel took over management duties in the summer following seven seasons at French club, Reims.\nFACTS AND STATS\n- We have won all six of our Women’s Super League games against Leicester by an aggregate scoreline of 23-2\n- Our Gunners have scored 15 goals across our three away games against the Foxes. Only Chelsea average more goals per away fixture with an opponent in the league\n- Alessia Russo has scored in each of her last four WSL appearances against Leicester. Our number 23 has scored more top-flight goals against the Foxes than any other opponent (six goals overall)\n- Jutta Rantala has 12 goal involvements in 23 WSL appearances (7 goals, 5 assists) - the joint-most of any Leicester City player in the competition along with Sam Tierney\n- Across the last six WSL campaigns, we're unbeaten in our first away game - winning five and drawing once\n- Beth Mead has been involved in at least one goal in each of her last eight WSL appearances in September, scoring eight and assisting eight. Her 22 goal involvements overall in September (11 goals, 11 assists) is the second most by a player in a single month\nWHAT THE MANAGERS SAY\nEidevall on Leicester: \"They have a clear identity, it’s a little bit different but a very clear identity. I think they had a strong transfer window, they have a strong squad.\n\"They're one of the teams that continuously building here in the WSL and they continue to make this competition harder and harder, which is good because it’s a challenge but it also makes it difficult for us because it’s going to be a tough opponent.\"\nSam Tierney on us: \"It's 90 minutes of football and it's one team against another. We know how tough it'll be and they have some fantastic players but we can take learnings from games we've had in the past against them.\n\"We'll try to be a team that's difficult to beat and make sure that we go out there and put on a good performance for our fans.\"\nTeam news\nJonas had no update on Leah Williamson's availability, after our number six missed the past two matches due to concussion protocol.\nSteph Catley and Lina Hurtig are expected to miss this weekend's fixture as they return from injury. Elsewhere, Victoria Pelova stepped up her ACL recovery this week with her first run on the anti-gravity running machine.\nMATCH OFFICIALS\nReferee: Jane Simms\nAssistant referees: Jade Wardle and Leoni Harland\nFourth official: Emily Heaslip\nHow to watch\nKicking off at 3pm at the King Power Stadium, the fixture is free to stream on the Women’s Super League official Youtube channel.\nOur social media channels will provide in-game updates and highlights will be shared on Monday.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
