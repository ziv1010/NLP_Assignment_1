Chelsea have obliterated their last three opponents, scoring a total of 15 goals in those matches. They often heat up late in the season, and the return of Pernille Harder has only strengthened them. If United are to win they’ll have to be at their very best.\nHere’s how to watch the match:\nFA Cup Final schedule\nThe match is set to kick off at 2:30 PM local time, meaning 9:30 AM on the east coast of the US and 6:30 AM on the west coast.\nBroadcast and Streaming options\nViewers in the UK and Ireland will be able to watch the match through the BBC. It will be broadcast on BBC One and will be available to stream on BBC Sport Web or the BBC iPlayer.\nViewers in the US and much of the rest of the world will need to stream the match via the FA Player or other means which will not be endorsed or condoned in this article.\nSouth and Central American viewers can likely find the match streaming on Star+. Everone else check out LiveSoccerTV for your options.\nPredicted XI\nMary Earps; Ona Batlle, Maya Le Tissier, Millie Turner, Hannah Blundell; Hayley Ladd, Katie Zelem, Ella Toone; Nikita Parris, Leah Galton, Alessia Russo",
