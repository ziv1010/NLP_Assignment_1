  "body_text": "WILKES-BARRE — After 250 years of faithful service, the historic 109th Field Artillery of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard — one of the oldest military units in the nation — retires its flag at the end of Sunday.\nThe 109th on Monday becomes the 28th DIVARTY, short for division artillery, but will continue to maintain its headquarters in Wilkes-Barre, commonly known as the “Kingston Armory.”\nNanticoke’s armory will close and be sold, while Plymouth’s armory will be used by the new unit, said Major Travis Mueller, public affairs officer for the Pennsylvania Army National Guard.\n“This reorganization aims to modernize the 28th Infantry Division into a force more capable of carrying out future missions,” Mueller said. “The preservation of the unit’s lineage and honors will continue with the 28th Division Artillery.”\nThe 109th traces its roots back to May 1775 — prior to the founding of the country — as part of the Connecticut Militia. Col. Zebulon Butler assumed command in the Wyoming Valley on Oct. 17, 1775.\nAnd the unit has fought in the country’s battles ever since — from the Revolutionary War to the Civil War to the War on Terrorism.\nWhile the unit was summoned to war after the Sept. 11 terror attacks in 2001, the date Sept. 11 has long been a notable day on the calendar for the 109th. On that day in 1950 after being mobilized for duty in the Korean War, a train crash in Ohio claimed the lives of 33 soldiers and wounded nearly 300 others.\nAn official ceremony regarding the deactivation of the 109th and rise of the new unit is slated for Sept. 14 at 11 a.m. at the Wilkes-Barre armory, Mueller said.\nRev. Kevin Miller prepared 109th soldiers for war in Iraq and Afghanistan as battalion commander — and deployed to Afghanistan with them. He’s now a priest in Hazleton, serving the parish of St. Padre Pio.\n“It was one of the greatest honors of my life,” Miller said of serving in and leading the 109th. “We are older than the country itself. We were originally militia men when the country was fighting for its independence as citizens soldiers.”\nMiller called the 109th the “best organization I was ever a part of in my life.”\n“When my time comes to go home to the Lord, some of my last thoughts will be of that battalion and armory and those men and women I served with,” Miller said.\nCurrent soldiers assigned to the 109th have the opportunity to be reassigned to another unit, including the 28th DIVARTY, change their specialty to join another unit or leave the military if their separation date is within 90 days of the unit’s inactivation date, the National Guard said last year when the restructuring was announced.\nRobert Dick, 47, a retired sergeant first class from Forty Fort, said the 109th is a “historic unit.”\n“The 109th has been ingrained in the history of the Wyoming Valley,” Dick said.\nState officials have described restructuring as a “name-only change,” but for those who wore the uniform the loss of the 109th name is tough to deal with, he said.\n“It’s like your favorite football team being rebranded,” Dick said. “You still love them, but it’s not the same.”\nDavid Kollar, 62, a retired captain from Bear Creek Twp., said the 109th played an integral part in the nation’s history.\n“It’s a proud tradition going back to the Revolutionary War,” Kollar said. “Few organizations have survived the amount of time the 109th has.”",
