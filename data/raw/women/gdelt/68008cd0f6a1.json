  "body_text": "When Young Matilda and starting goalkeeper Chloe Lincoln was shown a straight red card in Canberra United's last game, on the bench Coco Majstorovic was in shock.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nIt's the moment every back-up goalie is there to be ready for, and yet when it happens there's nothing that can truly make the situation feel any less daunting.\n\"I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting it,\" Majstorovic said.\n\"But that was probably a good thing that I didn't have time to think about it, because it was just straight on and off we go.\"\nMajstorovic would make some key saves, but Canberra went down in the match 2-0 to Melbourne Victory.\nNow a week on, the 24-year-old goalkeeper who previously played with Brisbane Roar and Melbourne City has a chance to do something she's never done before - start an A-League Women game.\nAnd unlike last week, she's had a full week of preparation to tune up with the other starters ahead of their match against Central Coast Mariners on Saturday afternoon at McKellar Park.\n\"I was reflecting a bit the last few days and just thinking how happy and proud I am about my career up to date, and after good performances, it finally pays off,\" Majstorovic said.\n\"Not many people get this opportunity, so I'm super honoured and grateful.\n\"We've got a really good team connection at Canberra so I'm super happy to go out there with the girls and hopefully we get a win this weekend.\n\"Not much will change - if anything I'll just eat a bit more food to fuel up.\"\nUnited coach Njegosh Popovich sang Majstorovic's praises.\nHe said Lincoln will grow from her \"learning moment\", but added that Majstorovic will bring a different dimension to the team and add plenty of value.\n\"Coco's communication skills are probably the best in the whole team, and she's experienced, which is great as a goalkeeper,\" he said.\nDespite coming off that deflating loss where United failed to score a goal for the first time this season, Canberra will go into Saturday's match backing themselves to come away with the victory.\nUnited tend to put on a show for their home fans as their last victory a fortnight ago showed, in an emphatic 5-1 thumping of Brisbane.\nThey'll also have Chilean international Maria Rojas back on deck after overcoming a knee issue, and any injury fears about the league-leading goalscorer Vesna Milivojevic in the rear-view mirror.\nThe Mariners meanwhile haven't won in three-straight games and are sitting just above Canberra on the A-League ladder in 10th spot, making this a very winnable match for the home side.\n\"We're building nicely,\" Majstorovic said. \"We had a bit of a rocky start to the season, but it's to be expected with the young group and new backline.\n\"It's just about putting all the puzzle pieces together.\n\"If we can get on a roll, we have shown in previous years we can string a few wins together, and open the floodgates towards finals.\"\nAT A GLANCE\nA-League Women - Round 9\nCanberra United v Central Coast Mariners, Saturday 5pm at McKellar Park",
