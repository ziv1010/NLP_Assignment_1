  "body_text": "Bompastor keeps reason for Green's Chelsea exit 'private'\n- Published\nChelsea manager Sonia Bompastor wants to \"keep it private and confidential\" as to why Paul Green suddenly left the club after 13 years.\nGreen left his role as head of women's football on Monday evening, despite having a significant impact on their success in the last decade.\nDuring his time at the club, the majority spent working with former boss Emma Hayes, Chelsea won 19 trophies, including six Women's Super League titles in a row.\nThere was speculation about Green's departure in reports this week, external but, when asked if the fans deserved more of an explanation, Bompastor said: \"I think it's probably not a question for me to answer. Maybe some other people in the club can answer that question.\n\"But for sure, every player and member of staff, recognise what Paul did for this club and all the success he brought from the beginning. We are all really thankful for that.\n\"I think he laid the foundations from the beginning and has been a huge part of the success of this club. I think he will be missed at this club for sure.\"\nChelsea are third in the WSL, nine points adrift of leaders Manchester City, as they prepare for Sunday's home fixture against Liverpool.\nA number of players in the squad posted about Green's exit on social media and their subsequent disappointment, including Erin Cuthbert and Millie Bright.\nStriker Sam Kerr said his departure was a \"big, big loss for the club\", while ex-Chelsea boss Hayes described him as \"the absolute best in the business\".\n\"Everyone was sad. On a human level, it's never positive news to have someone leaving the building,\" added Bompastor, when asked on Thursday about the reaction to the news.\n\"We need to focus on what is coming next. That is difficult sometimes as we have emotions and feelings. But we just need to focus on what we can control in the future.\n\"We are professionals. We have to bounce back and the game on Sunday is the most important thing.\"\n'I know my players are with me'\nFormer Manchester City striker Ellen White told the Women's Football Weekly podcast that Green had been the \"heartbeat\" of Chelsea behind the scenes.\n\"He had an impact on recruitment,\" she added. \"They were always two or three years ahead of everyone else and that took them to another level.\n\"He had a huge part in building everything that Chelsea stands for, so it is really sad he's left. It will be interesting to see what happens now.\"\nGreen's departure raised questions over the increased involvement of co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley, and their decision-making in relation to the women's team.\nBompastor signed a contract extension last week, keeping her at the club until 2030.\nAsked whether she was happy with the level of autonomy she held at Chelsea, the Frenchwoman said: \"I think I'm happy with where the club is going and the direction the club is going in.\n\"My job is to focus on what's on the pitch.\n\"My job right now as a manager is to make sure I make this team as successful as possible, I win games with my team and I give the players clarity to perform on the pitch. That's the only thing I can control and that's my main focus.\"\nBompastor insisted \"the processess are still working and running\", despite noticeable disappointments in recent transfer windows.\nFollowing their 5-1 WSL defeat by Manchester City, she raised concerns over their summer recruitment, admitting she \"would have liked to have been in a better place\" after it.\nThe Blues did not make any signings in January, despite falling behind their WSL rivals, and had multiple bids for Paris St-Germain midfielder Jennifer Echegini turned down on deadline day.\nFollowing recent concerns, a report in the Athletic, external suggested some players had not taken to Bompastor's training methods.\nBut she responded: \"I know there is a lot of noise going on about our team outside the environment. I know we can't control any of that.\n\"But I know my players are with me. We are all together focusing on the next game and what is next in the season for us.\n\"I guarantee they have the trust and belief that we can achieve great things.\"\n'Damaging time for Chelsea' - analysis\nIt's been a chaotic and damaging few weeks at Chelsea - a club that were a previously impenetrable force in the WSL.\nThey have set standards on the pitch, winning six successive titles, and have made a number of high-profile signings in previous transfer windows to remain on top.\nHowever, their rapid fall from grace this season has been alarming and the cracks in their armour are now more apparent than ever.\nBompastor has been under scrutiny from her own fanbase, having to answer questions on her position and was defiant in her response.\nJust as she had started the process of rebuilding with their victory over Tottenham on Sunday, the shock announcement of Green's exit threw a spanner in the works.\nSources told BBC Sport the news came as a surprise to Bompastor and her players, with many upset by the decision and confused by the reasons.\nBompastor and Green appeared to have a good relationship, often seen talking at length on the pitch after games, and were aligned in their ambitions.\nWhile she cannot admit as much publicly, Green's exit will undoubtedly have an impact on her role as she loses a key ally in the boardroom.\nIt is a crucial few months for Chelsea with a number of senior players, including Australia striker Sam Kerr, captain Millie Bright and England internationals Hannah Hampton and Lucy Bronze coming to the end of their contracts and a transition period on the cards.\nIt is a worrying time for fans, irrelevant of what happens on the pitch for the rest of the season, with the club's structure clearly undergoing an unfamiliar shift.\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.
