  "body_text": "England defender Lucy Bronze made a shocking admission after the Lionesses beat Spain to win the Women's Euros title.\nThe 33-year-old had played the entire tournament with a secret injury, but persevered to help her team reach the finals and win the title. She was forced to retire from Sunday's final, leaving the pitch in tears.\nDuring the post-match celebrations with her team, Lucy's right knee was bandaged, and she hopped on one leg, sometimes leaning on teammates for support.\nLucy's injury\nLucy showed an incredible amount of strength and resilience throughout the Women's Euros, finally explaining what had gone wrong for her during the final.\n\"I actually played the whole tournament with a fractured tibia, but no one knew,\" she told BBC Sport in a post-match interview. \"I just hurt my knee today on the other leg.\"\nLucy later revealed that she found out her tibia was broken after England's win against Portugal at the end of May and that her manager and teammates were aware of the situation.\nShe also said that she had taken some pain medication to help manage the injury.\nWhere is your tibia?\nYour tibia is better known as your shinbone and is the larger of the two bones in the lower legs. The top of the tibia connects to the knee joint, while the bottom of the tibia connects to the ankle joint.\nThis bone carries a lot of the body's weight in day-to-day life.\nWhat is a fractured tibia?\nDr. Suzanne Wylie, GP and medical adviser for IQdoctor, told HELLO! more about the nature of the injury:\n\"A fractured tibia refers to a break in the shinbone, which is the larger and stronger of the two bones in the lower leg and crucial for weight-bearing and mobility. It’s usually an extremely painful injury, often causing swelling, bruising, and difficulty walking, let alone running or playing football.\n\"In most cases, a broken tibia would immediately sideline a player, as continuing to put pressure on the bone risks worsening the injury or causing long-term damage.\"\nAward-winning osteopath Anisha Joshi explained more about the nature of the injury:\n\"A tibial stress fracture is an injury often seen in high-level athletes, especially young adults. It usually develops gradually from repetitive loading, making it painful but not always impossible to play through. With expert oversight from physios, osteopaths, and doctors, athletes can sometimes continue competing if the fracture is low-risk and well-managed.\"\nAccording to the NHS website, a broken tibia may be treated using rest, a cast, pain medication or, in extreme cases, surgery.\nRecovery times for this injury vary by its severity, but can take months to heal.\nCan you play football with a fractured tibia?\nWhile the NHS website advises that those with broken legs should try not to move too much, Lucy was determined to play for her country.\n\"That is why I got a lot of praise from the girls after the Sweden game, because I have been in a lot of pain,\" she shared with BBC Sport. \"But if that's what it takes to play for England, that's what I'll do - they know that. We inspire each other by playing through things like that and it got us to the end.\"\nAnisha Joshi gave HELLO! her thoughts on the decision:\n\"In Lucy Bronze’s case, I’m sure her medical team would have ensured that playing wouldn’t jeopardise her long-term health and were keeping a close eye on her from the side lines. It is still a true testament to her resilience and determination to support her team mates.\"\nMeanwhile, Dr. Wylie explained more about how Lucy might have been able to make it through the tournament.\n\"If the fracture is minor, such as a stress fracture, it is possible, though not advisable, for someone to continue playing, especially with strong pain management and medical oversight. That said, doing so requires a very high pain threshold and considerable mental and physical resilience.\nIf Lucy Bronze did indeed play in the Euros with a fractured tibia, it’s an extraordinary testament to her toughness, but also raises serious questions about the risks involved in pushing through such an injury.\"\nLucy was also adamant that she would not let the injury dampen her celebrations:\n\"It's very painful. I am going to party, I am going to enjoy it and that's it.\"",
