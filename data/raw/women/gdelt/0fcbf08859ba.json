In the first half of her side's second group game at the tournament, England's midfield metronome seemed destined to join that star-studded list of absentees.\nHere's everything you need to know about Walsh's injury and whether she stands a chance of playing any future part in the World Cup.\nWhat injury has Keira Walsh got?\nThree little letters have dominated the discourse in English women's football this season; ACL. Both Williamson, who is close friends with Walsh, and Mead damaged their anterior cruciate ligaments, which runs diagonally in the middle of the knee, and the immediate fear was that Walsh had suffered the same injury which typically takes around nine months to recover from.\nMercifully, the English FA revealed on Saturday that Walsh had not tested the strength of her ACL.\nHowever, the governing body did not disclose Walsh's exact diagnosis. The Telegraph suggests the 26-year-old may have damaged her medial ligaments as she continues to undergo more medical scans.\nWhen will Keira Walsh return from injury?\nThis World Cup has already witnessed certain associations tactically withhold information about the fitness of key players - Australia notably neglected to inform any external parties that Sam Kerr would miss the tournament's first two matches until an hour before kick-off against the Republic of Ireland.\nEngland's FA are also being careful with the details they divulge. Walsh has been ruled out of the team's final group game against China but she has not been sent home just yet. The Barcelona midfielder returned to the squad's base in Terrigal ahead of a final decision.\nIf Walsh has sustained medial ligament damage in Friday's match, a mild tear would take between one and three weeks to heel.\nWalsh is expected to miss England last 16 tie, should they reach the knockout stage, which will take place between Saturday 5 and Tuesday 8 August.\nIt's likely that the Lionesses would have to advance to the quarter-finals, scheduled over 11-12 August, for Walsh to harbour any faint hopes of returning at some point in this tournament.\nREAD MORE ON THE WOMEN'S WORLD CUP IN AUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND\nPotential Keira Walsh replacements for England\nEngland may have a 100% record at this embryonic stage of the tournament after scratchy 1-0 victories against Haiti and Denmark but the Lionesses are not yet guaranteed their place in the knockout rounds. If Wiegman's side lose to China and Denmark defeat Haiti, all three nations would be tied on six points. In that scenario, goal difference becomes the first focus.\nLaura Coombs replaced Walsh during the victory over Denmark on Friday, forcing Georgia Stanway into a more defensive role.\nWiegman gave Coombs her first cap in eight years back in February, a decision which left the Manchester City midfielder \"shocked\". At 32, Coombs is the oldest player in England's squad but earned her unlikely call-up as a star in City's midfield. However, Coombs' focus at club level has been to create and score rather than dictate and restore possession.\nStanway is also more attuned to the attacking aspect of a midfielder's role. Denmark manager Lars Sondergaard reflected that \"England also got a bit insecure in their passing from behind\" after Walsh was forced off. Kathrine Kuhl had been tasked with shadowing Walsh off the ball in the first half, limiting Denmark's ability to press England's ball-playing centre-backs. Without Walsh to draw the focus, Millie Bright and Alex Greenwood had a much trickier second half.\nUnless Wiegman takes a leaf out of Phil Neville's tactical playbook (always a dangerous approach) and shoehorns Lucy Bronze into the centre of the pitch, Manchester United captain Katie Zelem and Aston Villa midfielder Jordan Nobbs are the only natural alternatives.\nWhile Zelem offers a dead-ball threat and Nobbs boasts experienced savvy, the inclusion of either player would likely necessitate a switch to a 4-2-3-1, putting a leash on Stanway in a double pivot.\nLISTEN NOW TO 90MIN'S FOOTBALL CLIMATE CONVERSATION PODCAST\nFormer Italy international Arianna Criscione, Dulwich Hamlet's Brittany Saylor and Football for Future founder Elliot Arthur-Worsop join Katie Cross to have football's climate conversation about the Women's World Cup and tournament football's carbon footprint. Pledgeball's Heather Ashworth also gives an update on the Pledgeball's new Women's World Cup initiative.\nIf you can't see this embed, click here to listen to the podcast!",
