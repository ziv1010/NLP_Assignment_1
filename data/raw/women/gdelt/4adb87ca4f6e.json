After the incredible highs of the first half of the season — where that 4-2 loss against Sassuolo was the only real negative — there was barely anything positive about the second half of the season, except for Juventus (surprisingly) winning the Coppa Italia for the 15th time in the club’s history.\nMay’s Monthly Juventus Thoughts: The masquerade is over\nA very bipolar season finally came to an end.\nThe second half of the season certainly tested my writing abilities because there are only so many ways to say that a team sucks before you start getting repetitive. But hey, pressure makes diamonds, or whatever that Instagrammy #inspirationalquote says.\nOnwards, then, to the final monthly review of the 2023-24 season.\nA Sweet Ending\nThe first game of the month was a challenging away game against Roma. Like Juventus, our opponents were in an end-of-season battle to qualify for next season’s Champions League. It was a very entertaining match that was wonderful for the neutral to watch and really ebbed and flowed throughout the 90 minutes. Juventus started well but Roma scored first through Romelu Lukaku’s shot on the rebound after Tommas Baldanzi danced his way to the byline and caused chaos in the box.\nBut Juventus equalized almost immediately thanks to Gleison Bremer’s header from Federico Chiesa’s fantastic dribble and cross. Roma keeper Mile Svilar made some excellent saves to keep his team in the game as the Bianconeri cranked up the pressure.\nMax Allegri’s men started the second half on the front foot. Chiesa executed a marvelous solo dribble and shot that deserved a goal but the ball hit the inside of the post. Roma keeper Mile Svilar made some excellent saves — especially the one from Manuel Locatelli’s volley — to keep his team in the game as the Bianconeri cranked up the pressure. An entertaining game ended 1-1.\nJuventus were then back to their brilliant worst in the home game against Salernitana. The visitors scored first through Niccolo Pierozzi’s header from a corner. Despite the Bianconeri hitting the woodwork twice, they offered almost nothing in attack. Allegri made a few attacking substitutions and took more risks as the game progressed, which did result in his team creating more chances. The hosts hit the woodwork for the third time of the game when Fabio Miretti’s thunderous shot went off the crossbar. Eventually, captain Adrien Rabiot saved his team from an embarrassing loss when he squeezed in an equalizer in stoppage time after Locatelli flicked on a cross from a corner to the far post: 1-1.\nThe next game was the Coppa Italia final against Atalanta, the team’s one and only opportunity to win silverware this season. Remarkably, Juventus rose to the occasion. A nice passing play between Weston McKennie, Andrea Cambiaso, and Dusan Vlahovic resulted in the latter beating the offside trap to collect Cambiaso’s fabulous pass. The Serbian steadied himself and scored the game’s first and only goal in the fourth minute.\nThe team then produced an old fashioned corto muso performance to frustrate Atalanta and keep a clean sheet. Frankly, the Bianconeri probably created the better chances throughout the game despite having only 34% ball possession. Atalanta had zero shots on target all game and their most dangerous moment came when Ademola Lookman hit the post with a vicious shot late in the game. But Juventus were eventually relatively comfortable and held on for the victory and a record-setting 15th Coppa Italia victory!\nThen came the craziest game of the month (and arguably the season): the away game against Bologna, the first since Allegri was sacked after his misconduct in the aftermath of the Coppa Italia final. For 75 minutes, Juventus were a team at its absolute worst and completely devoid of any interest or motivation to play football. Bologna took advantage of this and raced to a 2-goal lead in the first 11 minutes thanks to goals from (the departing?) Riccardo Calafiori and debutant Santiago Castro. They added to the lead with a third after the break after a lovely chipped finish by striker defender Calafiori.\nBut then, a miracle happened. For roughly 15 minutes, Juventus not only cared about playing but they also suddenly played their hearts out. Three goals in a remarkable six minute period brought the game level. Chiesa, Arek Milik, and Kenan Yildiz were the goalscorers. The Bianconeri could (and possibly should) have snatched the winner late on, such was their momentum and Bologna’s complete collapse, but it stayed level at 3-3. What a game!\nThe final match of the season, at home versus Monza, was one in which neither team had anything to play for. Monza had already secured a tidy 12th-placed finish in the league and Juventus had (in spite of, rather than thanks to itself) secured Champions League football. So the team used the occasion to give Alex Sandro, playing his final game as a Juventus player and equaling Pavel Nedved’s record for the most appearances of a non-Italian Juventus player, as heartwarming send-off. Chiesa and, as fate has it, Sandro scored the game’s only goals in the 26th and 28th minute respectively. As most season-ending games that have nothing to play for tend to be, this was an overall pleasant game and finally a game in which Juventini could sit back and relax given the low stakes.\nFinal score in the final game of the month and season: 2-0.\nJuventus Women\nJuventus Women ended a disappointing season strongly with three wins out of three in May. The team got revenge for their Coppa Italia loss against Fiorentina by beating the same team 2-0 away from home. Sofia Cantore and Barbara Bonansea scored the goals.\nCantore continued her goalscoring form with two more goals in the home game against Roma. She scored the first goal before Evelyne Viens equalized for the visitors. Cantore put her side back in the lead with a lovely lob over Roma goalkeeper Camelia Ceasar. Jennifer Echegini scored Juve’s third and final goal in 90th minute: 3-1!\nLast but not least, the thrilling and wonderfully entertaining 3-2 victory against Sassuolo. Juventus raced to a 2-goal lead by half time thanks to goals from Echegini and Caruso. Loreta Kullashi halved the deficit for Sassuolo and made the game interesting again, until Cristiana Girelli restored the Bianconere’s two-goal lead. Of course, it had to be ex-Juventina Annahita Zamanian who had to create a tense ending to the game thanks to her penalty goal in the 81st minute.\nBut Juventus held on for a season-ending 3-2 victory away at Sassuolo. Let’s see if new coach Massimiliano Canzi (the other Max) can restore Juventus to its rightful place at the top of women’s football in Italy.\nTransition\nSummer is a time of positivity, both in life and in football. It’s the time when all forms of life are at their peak and their highest forms of beauty. In football, it’s the time when we look forward to new transfers, the new season, and new opportunities for better days for our respective clubs.\nUnlike the last time that Allegri left the club, it seems quite certain that there’s no coming back this time. At the time of writing, the new coach hasn’t been announced yet but, like the Mbappe-to-Real-Madrid transfer, it’s basically the worst-kept secret in town that Thiago Motta will be the next Juventus coach.\nThat means that, for the nth time in the last four years or so, it’s going to be another summer/season of transition. As mentioned earlier, one of the last stalwarts of the Old Guard, Alex Sandro, is leaving the club while there’s some uncertainty around players like Rabiot, McKennie, and Kostic. Then there’s the perpetual problem of a lack of money that might force the club to sell at least one of its most valuable assets.\nI say this because while I’m optimistic about the changes that will come (and some of the changes that have happened at the boardroom/upper management) at Juventus, it feels like in the last 4-5 years we’ve been stuck in a permanent state of transition and rebuilding. Will this finally be the moment where we break out of this state and stick to a plan for more than a year or two?\nI hope so because as we’ve seen with clubs like Manchester United after the Sir Alex Ferguson era, once you slip into mediocrity and constant transition stages at a club, it’s very, very difficult to get out of it.\nMost Popular\n- Report: Juventus could turn to Guglielmo Vicario in potential summer goalkeeper shake-up\n- Round 25: Juventus vs. Inter Milan match preview\n- Analyzing Juventus’ upcoming Champions League matchup vs. Galatasaray\n- Reports: Khephren Thuram a sudden doubt to face Inter due to bone bruise\n- Report: Juventus open talks with Pierre Kalulu over new contract through 2030",
