  "body_text": "Strictly Come Dancing's Karen Carney opens up about 'physical challenge' in rehearsals\nThe footballer topped the leader board on week one, and is ready for the second week of dances\nStrictly Come Dancing's Karen Carney admitted that rehearsal has been a \"physical challenge\" for her ahead of week two.\nPrior to Strictly, the 38-year-old former footballer has spent the past few years focusing on her punditry, joining Sky Sports as lead Women's Super League pundit in 2021.\nKaren quickly turned her attention to covering the Lionesses on ITV, providing detailed analysis of their UEFA Women's Championship triumphs in 2022 and 2025.\nAlso commentating on Champions League matches for CBS Sports, Karen has been part of TNT Sports football broadcast team since the start of last season, covering both the men’s and women’s game.\nWith 144 caps, Karen is England’s third most-capped player, competing at four World Cups, four European Championships and the London Olympics before retiring in 2019.\nShe shared: \"It really is a dream come true to be a part of this year’s Strictly Come Dancing line up. I’m such a huge fan of the show and I can’t believe I’m finally getting the chance to take part. I’m so excited to meet everyone and get dancing!\"\nOn Saturday (September 27), Karen took to the dancefloor for the first time with professional partner Carlos Gu as they performed the energetic Jive to One Way Or Another by Blondie.\nKaren unexpectedly wowed judges with a total of 31 points out of 40, making her top of the leader board going into the second week.\nAppearing on Strictly - It Takes Two with Carlos on Tuesday (September 30), Karen shared: \"I loved the song and loved the work that we did in the training room, and the aim was to go out and have fun and enjoy it.\n\"Honestly, as soon as it kicked in, the music, I was like 'Oh this is so much fun'!\"\nCarlos admitted: \"To be honest, I had no idea she could pull out the dance like that. I was surprised. In the middle of the dance I could feel her energy was boost, and I had to keep up!\"\nThis Saturday (October 4), Karen and Carlos will be performing the Tango to Training Season by Dua Lipa, which is all about posture for the footballing legend.\nAs Fleur asked how she's coping with the frame, Karen responded: \"Posture doesn't come easy to me, it's a real physical challenge. Like, it's really, really hard. I have the posture aid.\"\nCarlos added: \"Her spine is curved in, so she can't fully open, not with her shoulder but her spine.\" Karen continued: \"It's a challenge, but it's a challenge I'll improve on, and with this guy I'm trying my best.\"\nStrictly - It Takes Two airs on weekdays at 6:30pm on BBC Two and is available to stream on BBC iPlayer.",
