The Hammers progressed in both the Continental and FA Cup last week, keeping a pair of clean sheets in the process.\nWhere to watch West Ham vs Arsenal WSL on TV/live stream\nWhen is kick off? Sunday 5 February, 18:45 (GMT)\nWhere is the match being played? Chigwell Construction Stadium\nTV channel/live stream? Sky Sports Football/Premier League/Main Event (UK), FA Player (International)\nWhat time does coverage start in the UK? 18:30 (GMT)\nReferee? Richie Watkins\nWest Ham team news\nWest Ham continue to be without Jess Zui, sidelined with an ACL injury. Paul Konchesky has an otherwise has a 'fully fit' squad to choose from on Sunday. Deadline day signings Amalie Thestrup and Shannon Cooke could be in contention to make their debuts.\nArsenal team news\nBeth Mead and Vivianne Miedema remain long-term absentees for Arsenal as the pair continue their recoveries from respective ACL injuries.\nLia Walti has sat out Arsenal's last two due to a small injury. Jonas Eidevall admitted the midfielder was 'progressing', but that Sunday's fixture would be 'too early' for her to return.\nWest Ham vs Arsenal score prediction\nWest Ham have never taken so much as a point against Arsenal, losing all eight of their previous WSL encounters. The Gunners were 3-1 winners when the pair met in the reverse fixture, but the Hammers had taken the lead and were unfortunate to see a second goal disallowed.\nArsenal should have too much quality, even in the absence of the instrumental Walti, and will be expected to take three points again on Sunday.",
