  "body_text": "It's time to pick our Women's Player of the Month for February!\nA challenging month when it came to results, February saw us lose out to Chelsea in the FA Cup but defeat Manchester City in extra time to book our place in this weekend's Conti Cup final.\nThere were standout performances throughout the month and here are the four contenders:\n- Rafaelle Souza put in a stalwart defensive shift against Manchester City in the Conti Cup and bagged a goal against City in the WSL a few days later. Our Brazilian centre-back showed an abundance of skill and determination in her four February performances\n- Frida Maanum had yet another excellent month in red and white. Our Norwegian midfielder kickstarted the move for our extra-time winner against City and continued to be our key chance-creator in the final third\n- Across our tough February fixtures, Katie McCabe was a constant rock in defence and attack. Her versatility and unwavering spirit particularly shone in the Conti Cup semi-final, earning her a Player of the Match nod\n- Laura Wienroither put in several standout performances this month, particularly thriving when Jonas Eidevall briefly switched to a back-five. Despite the loss against Chelsea in the FA Cup against the run of play, she impressed throughout in the right wingback position\nWatch our quartet's best moments in the video above.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
