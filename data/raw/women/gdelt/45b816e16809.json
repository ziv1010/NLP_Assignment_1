  "body_text": "Tottenham Hotspur Women bowed out of the Subway League Cup after a 2-1 loss to Manchester United. Spurs still put up a respectable showing despite the clear difference in depth between the two sides, and will now look to strengthen in the January transfer window.\nSpurs Women 1 - 2 Manchester United: Spence strike not enough in the Subway Cup\nI am tired of playing Manchester United.\nFirst of all, let me take a moment to apologize for not writing about last weekend’s 3-3 draw against United in the league. United’s stoppage time equalizer sapped my spirit and I had to go outside and touch grass. It happened, it was brutal. It was exactly what you’d expect from a decent but depleted team facing opposition who has enough depth to play twice as many games. We were perhaps a bit lucky to put three goals past United in the first place, but I digress.\nIn a move that underscored our depth issues and injury crisis, Martin Ho selected an unchanged lineup from that 3-3 draw. It’s not super ideal to have to run out the same starting lineup against the same team, but we really didn’t have any other options.\nSpurs looked solid and mostly organized in the opening stages of the first half, although individual errors (loose balls, and one notable miss from Olivia Holdt in front of goal) snuffed out any promising attacks. United looked typically dangerous but seemed content to wait patiently. Drew Spence grabbed the first goal of the game with yet another stunner – Olivia Holdt won a free kick outside the box, and the ball bobbled around for a while until Drew Spence volleyed it into the corner. It was a brilliant goal, and the typical kind of Drew Spence magic we’ve come to know and love. United pressed for an equalizer for the rest of the half but were unable to break through.\nManchester United equalized just five minutes into the second half. Rolfö got the better of Ash Neville at the corner flag and crossed into the center of the box, where the unmarked Jess Park fired home. For much of the half, United seemed on top, though it looked like both sides were trying to conserve energy in case of extra time. Last weekend’s nemesis Fridolina Rolfö grabbed the last goal after Melvine Malard got past Ash again and found her in the center. Drew Spence had a chance to equalize at the death, but it was not to be.\nThoughts\nThe main story of this game for me was the depth. Yes, Ash got done on the wing and gave up a cross that led to a goal twice. But she’s got little cover from substitution (Rybrink isn’t actually a fullback and Ella Morris is still out for a while longer). Martin’s system also typically involves the right winger covering in defense, and Martha (a more out and out forward) has been playing there since Jess Naz’s ACL injury. I think pretty much everyone could’ve been sharper at times throughout this game (midfield covering United attackers for their first goal, our forwards’ decision making, etc.), but man, they just really need some cover and some new faces.\nIt’s getting to the point in the season where I’m starting to repeat myself. I remain really impressed both with Martin Ho’s brand of football, and the fact that he was able to galvanize the side after the disheartening draw the previous weekend. But seeing United prepare to bring Melvine Malard on and then looking at our bench made me cry a little on the inside. I’ve had a few of these moments this year. I wish it would stop.\nIf we truly want to compete with sides like United, we need to add to the squad. Spurs have already signed a true young star in Signe Gaupset, and I’m super excited to see her once she joins on January 1. Unless we want to be stuck in midtable purgatory, we’ve got to do a lot more business. We’ve already heard some rumors (Julie Blakstad and Hannah Lund to name a few), stay tuned to see what shakes out.\nSpurs Women will return in January with back to back games against Leicester City (one in the league and one in the FA cup). I’m hoping this double header goes somewhat better than the one against United. Happy Holidays to you all, and COYS!",
