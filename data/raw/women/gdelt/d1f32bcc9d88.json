This time, why doesn’t Cena just say no? The crowd chants for Cena to kick Lesnar’s @$$. Saying no would be safe and easy. The crowd chants, “Thank you, Cena!” Cena quips that’s the reason he says yes. He is the last real champion. The last real champion never takes his ball and goes home. Is Cena afraid of Brock Lesnar? Yes, he is. Could Cena fail? Yes, he could. Will he back down or give up? Hell no. WE (who’s we??) will take the fight to the Beas. This is the final showdown of two titans.\nGrade: B+\nCena is a master on the mic. Nothing more to add here other than at this point, Cena is in the Captain America/Optimus Prime-level of promoing.\nLyra Valkyria vs. Roxanne Perez w/Raquel Rodriguez\nValkyria takes Perez down. Perez pie faces Valkyria. Valkyria and Perex trade takedowns. Rolling prawn hold by Valkyria. Perez kicks out. Dropkick by Valkyria. Rodriguez trips Valkyria.

Bayley seems to have a mini meltdown in the ring, holding her temples as if the voices are talking to her. Bayley rolls out of the ring and starts hugging the commentary team, the ring crew, the fans, everyone.\nGrade: C+\nThe match wasn’t one of Perez or Valkyria’s best. Though it went over a break, it still seemed as though they didn’t get to tell much of a story during the match. Granted, the real story was the post-match bit with Bayley-Two-Face. Bayley finally has something interesting to sink her teeth into. This is going to be fun.\nKofi Kingston w/Xavier Woods and Grayson Waller vs. Penta\nKingston runs away. Penta gives chase.

Not sure where this war with Penta and New Day is going, unless this is what leads to Penta finally teaming with his brother Rey Fenix in WWE.\nThe Vision\nThe World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins and his wife, the Women’s Intercontinental Champion Beck Lynch, get drowned out with “CM Punk” chants. Rollins notes he’s not going to address the ignorant people in the building; he’ll address the people at home. Rollins puts over Lynch. As Lynch starts to speak, the crowd chants for AJ Lee. Lynch says she wants to say what she has to say to Punk’s face. AJ Lee’s music hits. Lee and Punk join Lynch and Rollins in the ring. Punk grabs a mic and announces himself as AJ’s husband. The crowd cheers. Punk notes that he doesn’t need to give his wife an overblown, overcompensating introduction. Punk asks who is the team leader is for Rollins and Lynch.\nRollins goes off. Punk notes that Rollins and Lynch aren’t on the same page. While chuckling, Punk points out that he had to listen to two crappy songs just now because Rollins and Lynch clearly aren’t on the same page. You see, Punk had no problem putting Cult of Personality aside so his wife could light it up. Rollins says he’s going to give Punk some credit. Rollins points at AJ and says that she is the best decision Punk has made in his personal life. As far as business is concerned, inserting AJ into “this” is a mistake Punk will regret for the rest of his days.

AJ points out that Rollins is literally standing behind Lynch.\nThe Voices of the Voiceless Face-to-Face with\nLynch tells AJ that she’s read AJ’s book and asks how AJ’s neck is feeling these days.

The crowd is LOUD for AJ. AJ reminds Lynch that AJ won two titles with her damaged neck and she’s a Puerto Rican from New Jersey, so sometimes she’ll shank a chick. AJ tells Rollins that he can’t handle or predict what she will do.\nRollins says AJ may be right. Rollins gets close to AJ and tells her that her husband has a nasty habit of leaving things when they let him down. At Wrestlepalooza, AJ better hope to god that Punk doesn’t leave her, too. AJ slaps Rollins in the face so hard his soul ended up in the third row. Rollins says he’s never put his hands on a lady, but thankfully, he has someone who will. Lynch looks around, wondering who Rollins is talking about. Rollins is confused. Lynch and Rollins argue. Rollins tells Lynch this is her fault. Lynch walks away. Rollins mushes Punk and runs away. As Punk gives chase, Lynch rolls back in and destroys AJ with a Manhandle Slam. Punk checks on AJ. Lynch slaps Punk.\nGrade: B+\nHeck of a segment. Everyone was on fire, and the subtefudge by Rollins and Lynch was executed to perfection. This is the most excited this writer has been for a match involving Lynch for ages. This match should be the main event of Wrestlepalooza.\nEl Grande Americano vs. Dragon Lee\nAmericano ends up on the apron. Lee sends Americano flying off the apron with a rana. Americano lies on the commentary desk. Lee rolls back in the ring and crushes Americano with a diving suicide senton through the ropes that sends both men crashing into the desk.

SKY seems to be trying to calm Asuka down. Asuka eventually walks away. SKY and Vaquer have a stare-down before shaking hands.\nGrade: B\nMatch of the night. Vaquer and Sane were totally locked in tonight. So many stiff strikes and big moves led to some nail-biting nearfalls. It’s a welcome change for the villain’s second to not actually have any effect on the finish here. Despite Asuka barking orders, this one had a finish as clean as a white sheet. Considering how interference-heavy every WWE show has been, this was a welcome change.\nBackstage, Asuka and SKY argue. SKY tells Asuka she has to do this on her own. Asuka storms off. Sane follows.\nJimmy Uso and LA Knight vs. Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed\nBreakker runs over Jimmy. Reed tags in and works over Jimmy. Jimmy manages to tag in Knight, who lands a few strikes.

Jimmy sends Reed over the top. Jimmy Spears Reed and goes up top. Breakker lays out Knight with a running shoulder block. Breakker crotches Jimmy up top. Reed hits the Jagged Edge on Jimmy for the win.\nWinners- Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed\nAfter the match, Reed and Breakker beat down Jimmy. Jey makes the save with a steel chair. Jey checks on Jimmy. Knight picks up the chair and threatens to hit Jey with it. Jey offers Knight a handshake. Knight accepts and drops Jey with the BFT.\nGrade: B-\nThis writer is a fan of Breakker and Reed, but we need to move away from having them main event Raw in tag matches. This is getting old quickly. That said, this was a fun, semi-PLE quality match. The bit at the end with Knight and Jey was predictable but well done.\nWWE Raw Review:\nTonight’s show managed to have matches that didn’t end in a disqualification or interference. That in itself is a victory. With all the solid matches (highlighted by the Sane/Vaquer contest) and solid promo segments (Cena, Punk, Rollins, AJ, and Lynch all threw heat tonight), Raw actually served as a decent go-home show for the Wrestlepalooza PLE. What do you all think? What was the match of the night? Are you excited for Wrestlepalooza?
