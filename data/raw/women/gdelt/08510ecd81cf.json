  "body_text": "Leah Williamson is noticeably absent from the World Cup this summer.\nIn April, she confirmed that she would not be taking part in the tournament after she ruptured her ACL when Arsenal played Manchester United, an injury that required surgery the following month.\nThe former WH cover star took to her Instagram to share - with characteristic candour, eloquence and sense of broader perspective - where she's at emotionally after learning that she would need surgery on her damaged ligaments.\n'Unfortunately the World Cup and Champions League dream is over for me and everyone will think that’s the main focus, but it’s the day to day of what I’m about to go through that is the most draining of my thoughts.\n'I had my tears and made my peace with it the night it happened and since then I have been following the steps I’m told to, in order to best help myself in the short and long term.\n'Ultimately, I think it’s just my time. In the past couple of years alone I have watched teammates beat serious illnesses and adversity with the biggest of smiles on their faces. I also hold perspective that globally there are much greater difficulties and therefore my circumstances right now are just that, circumstantial, and I’ve seen a lot worse.'\nAlex Scott told WH that she had offered support to the stricken player.\nShe said: 'When I know [the disappointment] will hit her in those moments where she's like, you know, wishes that she was there; that she's a part of the team. So that's when I know that I need to be checking in on a deeper level...because I know how much that will hurt.’\nWho is Leah Williamson?\nLeah Williamson is the current captain of the England Women’s football team, taking over from Steph Houghton before the UEFA Women’s Euro's in summer 2021.\nHowever, due to her horror ACL injury, Millie Bright is wearing the coveted captain's armband at the FIFA Women's World Cup, where England meet Haiti, Denmark and China in the group stages.\nHer footballing journey began at the age of six when her gymnastics teacher threw a football out for the girls to play with after a session. And for Leah, it was love at first kick.\nFalling in love with the game, Leah’s mum got her to try out for the local boys’ team Scot Youth, based in Bletchley, Milton Keynes, where Leah Williamson was born. Despite being the only girl on the team, Leah became the star striker for the next year.\nWhat club does Leah Williamson play for?\nWhen she’s not on the pitch representing England, Leah Williamson plays for Arsenal in the Women’s Super League.\nThe 26-year-old is a defender and is known for having a knack at being in the right place at the right time. You can catch her wearing shirt number six when she plays.\nWhen did Leah Williamson start playing for England?\nThe 5ft 7 (170cm) defender started playing for England at a young age, representing the country in every age group from the U15s team, right up to securing her spot on the senior team and eventually being made captain in time for the Euro's.\nShe made her England senior debut in June 2018 when the team played in Russia as part of their 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup qualifying matches. Originally, she was used sparingly, with her first senior team goal coming in November 2019 when she scored a late winner in the Czech Republic.\nNow Leah has an impressive total of 43 senior England caps.\nWhat is a standout moment from Leah Williamson’s career?\nLeah first burst into the sporting limelight in 2015 when she was playing for the England U19 team in a tournament at Seaview Stadium in Belfast.\nFacing Norway, England were trailing 2-1 when Leah scored an injury-time penalty, however, the referee ruled it wasn't a goal due to player encroachment – when any part of a player’s foot, who isn’t the kick-taker or goalie foot, enters the penalty area while the penalty kick is taken.\nRather than retake the kick, Norway were granted a free-kick and England lost… until five days later when UEFA ruled that the final seconds of the game should be replayed. Leah Williamson then retook the penalty and calmly sealed the deal and ensured qualification for England. This girl has nerves of steel!\nWhat awards has Leah Williamson won?\nEarly on in her career, Leah Williamson was named England’s Young Player of the Year for 2014.\nThe footballer comes from a divided footballing family, with her brother and father Tottenham Hotspur fans, while her mother, grandmother, and herself, support Tottenham’s main rivals, Arsenal.\nThroughout her time playing with Arsenal, Leah has won the FA Women’s Super League title as well as the Women’s FA Cup title.\nAnd her wins don’t stop there. With England, she won the SheBelieves Cup in 2019, when the team beat Japan 3-0; as well as last year’s Arnold Clark Cup. Of course, who could forget this summer when the Lionesses secured their first ever Women’s Euro's win after beating Germany in the final.\nWith so many triumphs under her name, it is no wonder that Leah was awarded an OBE in the 2023 New Year Honours list for her services to football. Her role as captain has made her a role model for many young girls wanting to get into football and put pressure on the FA to support the progression of the women’s game.\nIn her WH cover star interview, Leah said: 'If you’re not prepared to [be famous], you’re doing a disservice to the game and all those women that had to pretend to be boys to be able to play. I understand that I stand on the shoulders of those people.'\nPretty inspiring stuff.\nWhat does Leah Williamson do off the pitch?\nLeah Williamson announced the news that she is releasing a book, titled: Leah Williamson: You Have The Power. It is set to be the first in a three-book deal with Macmillan Children’s Books where the captain will share guidance to young children on how to realise their dreams and live life to their full potential.\n'It’s a positive guide, full of stories from my life, tips and advice and I hope it will inspire young people to be the TRUE and best version of themselves,' shared Leah on her Instagram, @leahwilliamsonn.\nYou can also catch up with the Lioness captain on Twitter, @leahcwilliamson.",
