  "body_text": "A hot-and-cold Gotham FC found their form tonight in Monterrey as they defeated Club América 3-1 in the Concacaf W Champions Cup Semifinal. The Bats scored three goals inside of 12 minutes in the first half, then they withstood the attacks from an improving América to end the rainy evening with a well-earned road win.\nThis match was a scheduling oddity, coming a little more than six months after Gotham's most recent game in the tournament. The Bats are a drastically different side since they drew Tigres UANL 4-4 on October 16, 2024, at the arena then known as Red Bull Arena: The iconic Crystal Dunn left for Paris Saint-Germain, and superstar center-back Tierna Davidson suffered a season-ending injury. But Midge Purce is back in the lineup after returning from an anterior cruciate ligament injury suffered last season, and striker Esther González leads the National Women's Soccer League race for the Golden Boot.\nOn this rainy night in Mexico, the 2025 edition of Club América couldn't contain the 2025 edition of Gotham FC. Now the bats will face Tigres UANL in the championship match scheduled for Saturday, May 24, at 10 pm ET (Paramount+). That game will be played at the Estadio Universitario, which is home to Tigres but will now be familiar to the Gotham squad — it's where they were victorious tonight.\nGotham FC: 10 shots, 3 shots on target, 49% possession, 385 passes, 74.8% pass accuracy, 13 fouls, 4 saves\nClub América: 17 shots, 5 shots on target, 51% possession, 391 passes, 77.5% pass accuracy, 13 fouls, 1 save\nGoals:\n• Gotham, Geyse, 21'\n• Gotham, Midge Purce, 30' (P)\n• Gotham, Jana Gutíerrez, 33' (OG)\n• Club América, Irene Guerrero, 38'\n3 Goals in 13'\nWhile Club America exerted influence over most of the game, dominating possession in the second half, Gotham controlled the run of play when it mattered most. Their three goals came in quick succession: From a set piece in the 21st minute, a penalty in the 33rd minute, and a fortunate deflection for an own goal in the 33rd minute.\nNone of the goals were cheap. Gotham opened the scoring when a corner from midfielder Sarah Schupansky was met by a hard-charging Geyse, who sent her first-touch shot past América goalkeeper Sandra Paños. From Schupansky's quality service to Geyse's perfectly-timed run, the defense didn't stand a chance.\nNine minutes later, Purce was taken down in the box by América‘s Jana Gutiérrez. Purce stepped up to take the penalty, sending her shot past the outstretched arms of Paños despite the goalkeeper correctly diving to her right. It was an ice-cold goal from Purce, who looks fully comfortable after recovering from her season-ending injury last year and returning to the squad earlier this season.\nJust three minutes later, Gotham scored again after a left-footed shot from González beat Paños only to hit the far post — then carom back across the goal line after bouncing off the leg of Gutiérrez. González was unlucky not to score. She was troubling the América defense all night, taking four shots – three from inside the box – and testing Paños. But in the end, it's América’s Gutiérrez who is credited for the own-goal — the 21-year-old defender had a night to forget.\nDefensive discipline\nThe Gotham defense deserves as much credit for this result as the attack: América had a slight advantage in possession and passes, and took significantly more shots, outgunning the Goths 17 to 10, but they were held to just one goal.\nStill, winger Irene Guerrero showed what América was capable of doing. The play started with midfielder Montserrat Saldívar carrying the ball into the attacking third, then laid off a pass for wingback Nicolette Hernández, who sent a cross into the box. Guerrero jumped on the ball, redirecting it over a diving Ann-Katrin Berger.\nIt was a quality goal from the buildup to the finish.\nBut that was the only ball that made it past Berger, who had four saves on the night. América ended the night with an xG of 1.99, with 12 of their 17 shots taken in the second half. América took their chances, but Berger won the night.\nSilverware on the line\nNow that Gotham has advanced to the final, they will be playing not only for their fourth trophy, but their third in three years. This game follows the team's surprise run to the NWSL title in 2023, and win in The Women's Cup in 2024; their first trophy came in 2009, when the club then known as Sky Blue FC won the now-defunct Women's Professional Soccer season.\nGood news for Gotham, this game will be played just three days from now. The Bats had a blistering April, winning three games out of four played, scoring 11 goals along the way. But they stalled in May, going scoreless in three games as they drew once and lost twice. The three goals Gotham scored tonight, and the form they displayed on the field, makes it feel more like April than May.\nAnd this stage of the Concacaf W Champions Cup feels a little like The Women's Cup, which also consisted of two games played in short succession. It's a sprint, not a marathon, and a Gotham with a multi-pronged attack backed up by a defense anchored by Berger has to like their chances no matter who they face in the title game on Saturday night.\n• Gotham FC, Lily Reale, yellow card, foul 62′\n• Club Américan, Montserrat Saldívar, yellow card, foul 73'\nOfficials\n• Referee: Odette Hamilton",
