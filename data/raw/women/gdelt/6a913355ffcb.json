  "body_text": "Ted Lasso is coming back for football season — and not the American kind. Nearly three years after its series finale, Apple TV's feel-good soccer show is set to return for another round of training. The last time viewers saw coach Ted Lasso (Jason Sudeikis), he had packed his bags and returned to Kansas City to spend more time with his family. Clearly, based on our latest look at the show's return, Ted isn't retiring from coaching anytime soon.\nSlated for a summer 2026 release, Ted Lasso Season 4 is set to follow Ted as he takes on a new kind of challenge: coaching a Division Two women's team in England. Ted might not be the brightest coach the Premier League has ever seen, but his mission is to bring out the best in his players. One early Ted Lasso scene doesn't just hit differently on a rewatch of the show ahead of its return; it also reveals a deeper understanding of the show's lead character.\nSeason 1's \"Diamond Dogs\" Monologue Reveals Who Ted Lasso Really Is\nIf there's one scene that reveals who Ted really is, it's the pub darts match in Season 1, Episode 8, \"The Diamond Dogs.\" Leading up to this moment, Richmond's current owner, Rebecca Welton (Hannah Waddingham), finds herself in a moral pickle. On one hand, she wants revenge on Richmond's former owner — her ex-husband, Rupert Mannion (Anthony Head) — by sabotaging the club and running it to the ground. In hiring Ted, Rebecca is fully convinced he'll destroy the team on his own, but things go quickly sideways when Ted's unconventional tactics are ultimately overshadowed by his kindness.\nRebecca's vengeance against Rupert also reveals she's letting him dictate her emotions, which isn't the best feeling after a divorce. In \"The Diamond Dogs,\" Ted and Rebecca cross paths with Rupert and his new, much younger fiancée, Bex (Keeley Hazell), at the local pub, the Crown & Anchor. Rebecca might be the new owner of Richmond, but Rupert is embraced by the pub's patrons, who are all Richmond fans. This is part of Rupert's ploy to maintain emotional control over his ex-wife, and he doubles down when he reveals that he's purchased minority ownership of the team through Bex.\nTed Lasso's \"Be Curious, Not Judgmental\" Monologue Is the Foundation of His Character\nTed might be all smiles on the outside, but the moment he witnesses Rupert blatantly disrespecting Rebecca, he decides to confront him in the most Ted way possible: challenging him to a game of darts. Rupert assumes Ted has no idea how to play and pulls out his own specially made darts, proving that the game has long been his forte. Ted, meanwhile, \"purposely\" shoots with his right hand and plays like a rookie, before announcing that he's always been better with his left — and suddenly, he's good at darts. As Ted closes the gap against Rupert's score, just when it seems impossible for him to catch up, he launches into his famous \"be curious, not judgmental\" monologue.\nThe pub darts scene changes with a rewatch of Ted Lasso. In the beginning, Ted appears to be a bumbling American coach unfamiliar with English football and its culture, his excessive kindness making him easy to underestimate. However, Ted's monologue reveals a deeper truth shaped by a childhood filled with relentless bullying. He realizes that those who belittled him were never curious, only quick to judge. That curiosity becomes Ted's greatest strength, allowing him to see beyond assumptions and remain empathetic. In contrast, Rupert's biggest weakness is his ignorance, blinding him to Ted's inner intelligence and unexpected mastery at darts.\nFrom 'Ted Lasso' to 'Slow Horses,' These 8 Apple TV Shows Are Perfect From Start to Finish\nIs Apple TV the most original streaming service at the moment?\nKindness and Understanding Are Keys to Success in 'Ted Lasso'\nTed has always put his \"be curious, not judgmental\" mindset into practice, both before and after the darts match. When the arrogant Jamie Tartt (Phil Dunster) acts out and encourages his fellow Richmond teammates to follow suit, Ted doesn't see Jamie as a villain — only as someone driven by deep insecurity and a need to overcompensate his masculinity. When Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein) is openly hostile, Ted doesn't judge Roy as temperamental or difficult; instead, he sees Roy's seriousness as a sign of loyalty to the team and fear of becoming irrelevant with age. After the darts match, when Rebecca finally confesses her intentions in hiring him, Ted chooses forgiveness over retaliation, understanding how deeply divorce can wound.\nTed's kindness shouldn't be mistaken for naivety. It's his way of navigating a new social landscape, one where people aren't afraid to voice their opinions or hurl the occasional UK insult. Instead of firing back, Ted lets these comments slide, choosing to observe before reacting and asking questions instead of snapping back. No matter how ridiculous those questions may seem, or how much he's ridiculed for asking them, they fuel his curiosity about his team, rather than pushing him to make the worst assumptions.\n- Release Date\n- August 14, 2020\n- Showrunner\n- Bill Lawrence\n- Writers\n- Brendan Hunt, Joe Kelly, Bill Lawrence\nCast\n-\nTed Lasso\n-\nRebecca Welton\nAmerican college football coach Ted Lasso heads to London to manage AFC Richmond, a struggling English Premier League soccer team.\n- Streaming Service(s)\n- AppleTV+",
