  "body_text": "Jason Whitlock Op-ed: Colin Kaepernick and Philly looters share the same foolish, bigoted motivation\nJASON WHITLOCK | September 27, 2023\nRead more at https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-colin-kaepernick-and-philly-looters-share-the-same-foolish-bigoted-motivation/\nMatt Winkelmeyer / Staff | Getty Images\nThere’s little difference between Dayjia “Meatball” Blackwell and Colin Kaepernick. Both are internet trolls, substanceless social media influencers adept at promoting chaos and outrage.\nOn Tuesday night, Meatball encouraged her Philly followers to meet her downtown. The group eventually looted a Lululemon, an Apple store, a Foot Locker, and a liquor store. Meatball livestreamed much of the action before getting arrested.\nKaepernick, of course, is the former NFL quarterback who elevated his brand seven years ago by kneeling during the national anthem. In the process, Kaepernick became the most polarizing athlete in America. He torched his football career while simultaneously becoming a cult figure to left-wing activists and Nike. On Tuesday, Kaepernick had his rap music buddy J. Cole release a letter Kaepernick wrote to the New York Jets asking for a roster spot on their practice squad.\n“I would be honored and extremely grateful for the opportunity to come in and lead the practice squad,” Kaepernick wrote. “I would do this with the sole mission of getting your defense ready each week. If I were able to fill this role, I believe this allows for multiple things.’\n“Worst case scenario, you see what I have to offer and you’re not that impressed. Best case scenario, you realize you have a real weapon at your disposal in the event you ever need to use it. In either of these scenarios, I would be committed to getting your defense ready week in and week out, all season long, and I would wear that responsibility like a badge of honor.”\nMeatball and Kaepernick are victims of a culture that rewards, promotes, enables, excuses, and justifies self-destructive behavior from black people. They’re collateral damage from the circus “clown show” that I’ve been railing against all week. The social media matrix baits celebrities, journalists, athletes, broadcasters, and influencers into creating content that outrages what used to be the establishment. For black influencers, the establishment is white evangelical conservatives. Black influencers have been convinced that anything that aggravates, annoys, or frustrates white conservatives is a net positive for black people. It’s a ridiculous standard.\nBut it’s what compelled Kaepernick to foolishly kneel during the national anthem. His protest and support of Black Lives Matter did not save one black life. It accomplished the opposite. It demonized the profession of policing, sparked defund-the-police policies and sentiment, and subsequently made black neighborhoods more violent and crime-ridden. It also wrecked Kaepernick’s football career. It should be obvious to everyone that Kaepernick regrets sabotaging his playing career. How else do you explain someone who hasn’t played football in seven years begging the Jets to sign him to the practice squad? Kaepernick is 35. Two years ago, he released a documentary-style movie about his life and analogized the NFL to a slave plantation. Three years ago, he backed out of an organized workout in Atlanta and donned a Kunta Kinte T-shirt.\nKunta Kaepernick now wants a job back on Massa Goodell’s plantation? Make it make sense. It only makes sense if you recognize and acknowledge that Kaepernick’s original protest was devoid of substance and was driven by the social media stimulus that grants clout and relevance to black people who troll white evangelical conservatives.\nThis same stimulus motivates young people such as Dayjia Blackwell to loot and produce immoral content.\nLeftists have defined Christianity as the “white man’s religion.” They’ve demonized whiteness, which, in their minds, justifies the tearing down of Christianity. It’s all a lie. The first Christians were ethnically Semitic and had light to dark brown skin. All humans, regardless of color, are made in the image of God.\nLet me get back to Meatball and the looting last night in Philadelphia. Blackwell streamed much of the activity. She screamed into the camera: “Everybody’s gotta eat!”\nYou don’t rob Lululemon because you’re hungry. The looting we see nationwide has nothing to do with hunger pangs. It’s a reflection of people’s animus toward a country they’ve been convinced must be torn down and remade. It is a form of protest.\nThey’re just protesting the wrong thing. The establishment that is truly in control is quite comfortable with black people and others protesting the wrong thing. They’re fine with protesting white evangelicals and Christianity. What the ruling establishment won’t tolerate is American citizens protesting the ruling establishment.\nThe ruling establishment controls Congress, the Capitol, and the White House. Americans are strictly forbidden to protest there. The ruling establishment constantly points black people to direct their frustration at “whiteness” and away from the wickedness of a secular society.\nJoe Biden routinely tells the public that “white supremacy” is the greatest threat to America. He’s providing cover for Satan, who is colorless. Satan is a set of values and beliefs that destroy the soul and the mind. Biden and the left are intentionally inspiring black people to destroy America and themselves.\nColin Kaepernick and Dayjia Blackwell are useful idiots following instructions.",
