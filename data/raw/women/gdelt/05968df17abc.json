  "body_text": "PHILADELPHIA — Another offseason, another new offensive coordinator for Jalen Hurts.\nWith Kevin Patullo being promoted to replace Kellen Moore, who liked New Orleans so much he decided to become the Saints’ head coach after Super Bowl LIX, the Eagles quarterback is now playing for his sixth offensive coordinator since being drafted in 2020.\nThere have been Doug Pederson, Nick Sirianni, Shane Steichen, Brian Johnson, Moore and now Patullo. Not to mention, he had four play callers in college — Lane Kiffin, Steve Sarkisian and Mike Locksley at Alabama and Lincoln Riley at Oklahoma.\nThe fact Patullo has been here since 2021 as an assistant coach helps ease the transition, and much of the play terminology he uses is the same as Moore’s. But it’s still an adjustment for the Super Bowl MVP.\n“There are some nuances that are different,” Hurts said this week at NovaCare Complex. “Things evolve and things change as time goes on, and we’ve just really bought into that. It’s an important thing. I think that’s something I’ve learned as well, is you have to be able to evolve as time goes on.\n“Coach Patullo has been here throughout the journey. He’s had a different position, but he’s always played a pivotal role in what we’ve done. I think he’s got a great mentality and a great approach coming into everything right now. The bigger picture is just taking it a day at a time, truly, keeping the main thing the main thing, and I think that’s where we are.\n“We’ve always had some type of communication in the past … so nothing really changes in terms of that. It’s just kind of people with different titles. I think this is a season right now, in the offseason, where we’re collectively trying to build out the system and structure things the way it’s going to be for this iteration of the Eagles.”\nAll-Pro left tackle Jordan Mailata called Patullo a “great communicator, just very detailed, very open, very approachable, so it makes it easy for us to come to him with ideas.” But he admitted the OC turnover can be challenging.\n“Now I know how Jalen feels,” Mailata joked. “Thank God there’s carryover (of culture some key staff), but it’s no surprise to us in the offensive line room, because of the way Coach Stout (O-line coach Jeff Stoutland) coaches. It’s extremely difficult at times, but also very easy. We’re pretty lucky to be coached that way, because it makes it easier for these scenarios when they play out, like when you lose an offensive coordinator, because of the way we’re coached and the fundamentals.”\nMailata is excited about the offense and the Eagles’ new rookie class, and of course he focused on center Drew Kendall (Boston College) and offensive tackles Myles Hinton (Michigan) and Cameron Williams (Texas).\n“I love our rookies,” he said. “This is a great rookie class, especially in that O-line room. They work hard. I told Myles and I told Cameron and I told Drew, ‘I don’t care if you come for my job. If you’re better than me, you’re going to be better than me, but I’m going to make it damn hard for you to reach that. But I’m going to bring you along. I’m not going to kick you down, that’s not how it runs here. That’s not how we do it. I’m going to bring you along, because it will make me better.’ And, boy, they’re pushing me.”\n• • •\nSirianni began the week by inking a multi-year contract extension. He has made the playoffs all four seasons he’s been here, including a pair of Super Bowl appearances and a Lombardi Trophy.\n“Congratulations to him,” Hurts said. “Everything he’s been able to achieve and accomplish, he’s earned. Just to see his evolution and his growth from my perspective in playing quarterback here, his whole entire tenure has been a great experience, been a great ride. It’s been a lot of learning for the both of us, and hopefully we’re just getting started.”\nIn an early press conference in 2021, Sirianni famously mentioned a flower blossoming as a metaphor for a team’s growth.\n“I think about that time at his press conference when he talked about the flower, and now I just want to give him his flowers,” Mailata said. “All the scrutiny that he’s gotten and to be able to come back every year and preach the message but also correct his mistakes and show accountability. … And when you have a coach that allows even the players – he always says, it’s not coaching-led, it’s player-led – he gives us our space to be able to create that culture as well. And we feed off that.”\n• • •\nDuring this offseason, Sirianni has spoken with several coaching luminaries about their approaches after winning a championship, such as how they refocused their programs. Among them were former Villanova men’s basketball coach Jay Wright, who is a regular confidant of Sirianni’s, UConn women’s basketball coach and Norristown native Geno Auriemma, South Carolina women’s basketball coach Dawn Staley, who grew up in Philadelphia, and former Alabama and LSU football coach Nick Saban.\n• • •\nNOTES >> A.J. Brown proposed to his girlfriend Kelsey Riley at the Four Seasons Hotel in Center City earlier this month, and musician John Legend assisted with a personalized video. “He’s a big Eagles fan and he went to school here at Penn,” Brown said. “It just kind of teamed up perfectly for me.” … Hurts said he’s already turned the page from the Super Bowl victory. When asked if he has spent any time reflecting on the accomplishments of the past year, he said, “We’re here talking about the 2025-26 season.\nFollow Christiaan DeFranco on X at @the_defranc.",
