  "body_text": "DALLAS (NCBWA) – Craig Way, in the midst of his fifth decade of working with the Longhorn Radio Network from Learfield and baseball voice of the University of Texas program since 2002, has captured the 50th annual National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association Russell D. Anderson/Wilbur Snypp Award for national contributions to college baseball.\nThe award, first given in 1975 to NCBWA founder Wilbur (Bill) Snypp of Ohio State, also memorializes the cherished Russell D. Anderson – treasurer and associate executive director for the NCBWA for 25-plus years from 1996-2021 before passing away April 5, 2021. Anderson was awarded the top honor given by the NCBWA in 2002 for his sterling efforts in the college baseball realm.\n“Craig Way has done so many great things to encourage interest and to promote the game of college baseball,” NCBWA Executive Director Bo Carter said. “His body of work and work ethic not only college baseball but in all areas of college broadcasting are unrivaled. He is one of the best in the business and longtime friend of many NCBWA members and officers.”\nWay is currently in his 24th season as the play-by-play voice of the Texas Longhorns for baseball on the Longhorn Radio Network from Learfield, but his legacy goes far beyond the diamond. He began working on radio broadcasts in 1988 as the network's studio anchor and served as analyst on football and basketball broadcasts from 1992-2001 while becoming UT's play-by-play voice of women's college basketball in 1997. He then assumed play-by-play duties on football, men's basketball and baseball beginning in 2002.\nThe Voice of the Longhorns, Craig Way\nHis list of honors in broadcasting, which covers a career as a student broadcaster at the University of North Texas to an intern and anchor at KRLD Radio in Dallas, includes the Contribution To Amateur Football Award from the National Football Foundation/College Football Hall of Fame Austin (Texas) NFF Chapter, the Texas High School Coaches Association's Distinguished Service Award, induction into the Texas High School Football Hall of Fame and his first (of two) 2016 Texas Sportscaster of the Year by the National Sports Media Association.\nWay also is recipient of the Dallas Press Club’s prestigious Katie Award, and seven Lone Star Emmy Awards, three as host of “High School Scoreboard Live” on FOX Sports Southwest; four for Best Play-By-Play in Texas for his call of the UIL State High School Championships and also is widely recognized as “The Voice of High School Sports In Texas.” He has called more than 200 state title games in football and basketball on TV and all told more than 5,000 high school football, basketball and baseball games on TV and radio.\nHis smooth and exciting descriptions of everything from the greatest moments in Longhorns history in the NCAA World Series, 2005 Bowl Championship football title, NCAA Final Four®, times in the pressbox elevator (when it worked) at old Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, and other national events have distinguished him among fans and fellow broadcasters alike.\nAnderson/Snypp namesake Russell Anderson told friends before his passing that Way was one of his favorite broadcasters, and the two met many times during Anderson’s days as assistant commissioner of Conference USA and in NCBWA capacities.\n\"I am greatly honored and humbled to be named the recipient of the 50th annual National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association's Russell D. Anderson/Wilbur Snypp Award.” Way said. “This award is synonymous with great contributions to game of college baseball, beginning with its namesakes Russell Anderson and Wilbur Snypp, and includes some of the greatest names in the history of college baseball.\n“I feel fortunate and blessed to have worked alongside several of the individuals who have won this award, including the late Bill Little, one of my first broadcast partners on Longhorn baseball,” he added. “I also have been blessed to work with great coaches like the late Augie Garrido, David Pierce and now Jim Schlossnagle. I have also greatly benefited from having a College Baseball Hall of Famer in Keith Moreland over the years as a broadcast partner.\n\"Other than calling the two national championships for the Texas Longhorns in 2002 and 2005 at the College World Series, I can't imagine a greater thrill in the game in being named the recipient of this prestigious honor. I thank the NCBWA for this award.\"\nAll-Time Russell D.
