  "body_text": "The Voice of Nigeria (VON) has tendered an apology over an erroneous report published on its website regarding the outcome of the 2025 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) Final.\nVON had published a misleading report on Sunday implying that the Nigerian Super Falcons lost to Morocco in the WAFCON final, which held on Sunday. Many Nigerians have knocked VON for the erroneous publication, noting that it was unethical.\nIn a statement signed by the Director General/CEO of VON, Mallam Jibrin Baba Ndace, the media organisation addressed the inaccurate announcement of a Nigerian loss in the match against Morocco, which Nigeria ultimately won 3–2.\n“The erroneous report, which prematurely and falsely announced a Nigerian loss before the conclusion of the match, was both inaccurate and deeply unfortunate.\n“Voice of Nigeria aligns with this historic moment, as our Super Falcons mounted a courageous comeback to defeat hosts Morocco 3–2, securing a record-extending tenth WAFCON title and affirming their place at the pinnacle of African women’s football,” the statement read in part.\nNdace added that the organisation is investigating the incident and considering both internal lapses and external threats. He also noted that there is a possibility of a security breach or identity theft through hacking that may have contributed to the erroneous report.\nHe also highlighted the precautions VON is taking to ensure the security of its digital platforms and prevent a recurrence.\nHe said, “As part of our ongoing internal reforms, we have introduced key editorial structures, including an Investigative Desk, a Fact-Checking Unit, and a Monitoring and Evaluation Team. We have also undertaken strategic staff redeployments to enhance accountability, build resilience, and boost editorial efficiency across our platforms.”",
