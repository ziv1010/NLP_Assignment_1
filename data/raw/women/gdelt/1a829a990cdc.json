But, despite all the popularity that's she's given the sport, Clark is being left off Team USA in the 2024 Summer Olympics. It's left quite a few fans disgruntled, because she's certainly become such a massive name in not just women's sports but sports, in general. But, Clark is handling the decision like a pro. She has the perfect response to being left off Team USA.\nCaitlin Clark's Response to Being Left Off Team USA\nClark is smart enough to know that all eyes are on her and everyone is watching her every move, especially when she's dealing with adversity. So, she's careful when talking to the press, especially when it comes to something as important as being left off Team USA at this summer's Olympics. While Team USA's official women's basketball roster hasn't been released yet for 2024, various media reports, and Clark herself, has said she was not picked to be on the team.\nSo, Clark is speaking out and staying positive. Speaking with the Indianapolis Star about being left off Team USA, Clark said she is \"excited for the girls that are on the team. I know it's the most competitive team in the world.\" She added that having USA Basketball select her to compete \"could have gone either way\" and that she's \"going to be rooting them on to win gold.\"\nClark, of course, is on the Indiana Fever. Her coach, Christie Sides, also commented on her star player being left off Team USA. Sides told reporters that Clark will have plenty of chances to join USA Basketball down the road. \"That's the hardest team in the world to make,\" Sides said. \"That is a tough team. She's young. She's going to have so many opportunities in the future.\" Sides also said that after Clark found out she wouldn't be part of this year's Olympic team, she texted Sides. \"The thing she said was, 'Hey coach, they woke a monster,' which I thought was awesome,\" Sides said.\nClark is a rookie in the WNBA and joined the Indiana Fever this spring following a record-breaking college showing. Speaking with reporters, she reiterated that she's not upset and instead excited for her colleagues. \"Honestly, no disappointment,\" said Clark, who also stars in a new ESPN+ Series, \"Full Court Press.\" \"Like, I think it just gives you something to work for. Hopefully one day I can be there.\" I'm sure she will make it one day. She has the drive.",
