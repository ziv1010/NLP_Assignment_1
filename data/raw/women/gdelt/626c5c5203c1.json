I spoke about it when I doorknocked, and was with community groups, and it was an issue that was raised continually, in particular in the East Perth area,\" he said.\nLabor blasts Basil Zempilas\nPremier Roger Cook said while he respected the council's long-term plans for the space, the needs of women using the service should be the short-term priority.\n\"Those women will have to fend for themselves on the streets of Perth [tomorrow night], and that is down to the decision by the City of Perth, and it's entirely regrettable and entirely avoidable,\" he said on Wednesday.\nAt a media conference on Thursday, the premier also took aim at Mr Zempilas attending an overseas conference on the day the service closed.\n\"He's in Cape Town today with the governor of Nairobi and the deputy mayor of Los Angeles,\" he said.\n\"It's the very thing he critiqued the prime minister for just a fortnight ago, when the prime minister went to an APEC summit.\n\"So he's now at a water conference in Cape Town when there's going to be 30 women on the streets tonight because of his decision.\"\nThe government has repeatedly suggested the City of Perth's actions are at odds with its 16 Days campaign to end domestic violence, which started on Saturday.\nThe Minister for Women's Interests, Sue Ellery, went further in state parliament on Thursday in criticising the Lord Mayor.\n\"I think that [to close the service] in the middle of the 16 Days campaign ... is appalling,\" she said.\n\"And [it's] one of either the most stupid or the most lacking in value political judgements that I have seen, and I've seen a few stupid political operators and I've seen a few political operators with no values.\n\"But this is a person, if you read the subtext, he wants to be in this building. If that is what he stands for, well, that's a sad reflection.\"\nThe subtext Ms Ellery referred to is a rumour which has been swirling for years that Mr Zempilas is considering a jump to state politics at the next election, potentially to take over leadership of the Liberal Party.\nMr Zempilas has long rubbished those rumours, insisting his focus is on serving as the Lord Mayor.\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, he said the Safe Night Space had been extended beyond its initial two-year trial to allow for other homelessness services to come online, and accused the premier of \"undermining our collective efforts to transition vulnerable women to other available services\".\n\"The Department of Communities is in contact with all of the women, including [providing] access to case workers,\" he said.\n\"Throughout the year the City has proposed other properties within the state government portfolio or other vacant private properties that could accommodate a similar service.\n\"We are now 12 months on from when the state were made aware of the service's closure. The Department, Ruah and the City have been actively working on this transition.\"\nHowever, the Department of Communities said it was seeking a retraction of some comments made by the Lord Mayor because they were \"factually incorrect\".\nA spokesperson said the department had not been contacted by the City of Perth to specifically discuss the transition of the service, or women using it.\n\"Communities is not in contact with all of the women who were clients of the Safe Night Space,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"The Department does not have the contact information for all clients of the Safe Night Space service as the contract for this service is between the City of Perth and Ruah and client confidentiality applies.\"\nThe spokesperson said Ruah had advised the Department that women were accessing other homelessness services and would be case-managed through the Rough Sleeper Coordination Group as appropriate.\nDozens protest closure\nAn online petition looking to save the centre has attracted more than 22,000 signatures.\nIt was followed by a snap protest attended by dozens of people outside Perth's Council House last night to express anger about the closure of the service.\nAmong them was Royal Perth Hospital nurse unit manager Simon Cavoli, who said news of the closure was distressing.\n\"Not only as clinicians but as humans of the city to have a vulnerable group of people who had a safe place to sleep being impacted,\" he said.\n\"We have a very strong relationship with the Ruah service within the emergency department and the service they provide linking vulnerable people into services in the community is essential for us.\n\"Providing them a safe place to stay is a fantastic option rather than leaving them potentially in an emergency department that is already overcrowded, overstimulated and overburdened as well.\n\"Anyone on the streets are likely to be more vulnerable to, and be victims of violence, and abuse, purely because of the nature of the streets.\n\"We encourage the councillors to recognise the importance of this service and the opportunity that exists given that there is a funding source.\"",
