  "body_text": "Former Republic of Ireland captain Shane Duffy could be on the move as Norwich City have admitted that he is likely to be down the pecking order at Carrow Road this season. The 33-year-old, who won the last of his 61 caps against Hungary in June 2024, was a key figure for Norwich last term, where he missed just one league game, and has a full season left on the three-year contract he signed in 2023 when he moved from Fulham. But the Derry native has featured little in the Canaries pre-season programme and manager Liam Manning admits talks have been ongoing about a possible move.\nBack in April, BBC Norfolk reported on April 9 that an offer from the Red Bulls was “on the table” for the 33-year-old Republic of Ireland international. But Red Bulls denied it and there's no more speculation this time that Duffy, who has spent 14 seasons playing in England and one in Scotland, is headed stateside.\nBRUNO LETS RIP\nManchester United captain Bruno Fernandes let rip at his teammates following their 2-2 pre-season draw with fellow Everton, saying their performance was “lazy” and calling for further reinforcements. A second-half goal from Mason Mount had United on course for victory in Atlanta after Fernandes’s opener was cancelled out by Ndiaye, but a bizarre 75th-minute own goal by Ayden Heaven gifted Everton the draw on Sunday. The draw put a slight damper on United tour of the United States, after promising victories over West Ham United and Bournemouth last month. Fernandes said: ‘‘The tour has been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved also. We didn’t want to finish in this way. Our performance was not the best and we were a little bit lazy today. We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.’’\nCHAMPIONSHIP\nTO KICK OFF\nThe English soccer season, which started last week with games in League One and League, really kicks off this weekend with a full round of games in the Championship. Ipswich Town who were relegated from the EPL last season are in action on Friday night away to Birmingham City. It will be interesting to see if Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu can win his place back at Southampton, having gone out on loan to Standard Liege last season. The Saints start at home to newly promoted Wrexham where Derry’s James McClean is the captain. Bazunu was first choice Irish goalkeeper under former Irish manager Stephen Kenny, but since his injury Caoimhin Kelleher has taken over between the posts. Bazunu has yet to play under new manager Heimi Hallgrimsson.\nThe weekend will see action at Wembley Stadium and the Aviva Stadium. In the former, Crystal Palace will make their first-ever appearance in the Community Shield final when they play Liverpool on Sunday. Meantime on Saturday, Leeds United, who are back in the EPL this season, play a pre-season game against AC Milan. Leeds still have a huge number of fans in Ireland, the tradition that beginning with the great side of 1960s and ‘70s when Ireland’s John Giles was among the many stars playing at Elland Road. And ticket sales for the Aviva game are reported to have been selling well. It will be the first meeting between the clubs since the UEFA Champions League group stage in the 2000/2001 season.\nBRENNAN’S BARNET\nLOSE OPENING GAME\nDubliner Dean Brennan who managed English club Barnet when they were promoted to League Two at the end of last season sounded very confident when interviewed about the season on Irish radio last week ahead of their opening game. The Bees won the National League title last season to end a seven-year spell playing non-league football. But their return didn’t start well with a 2-0 defeat at home to Fleetwood on Saturday. A better start for Cork-born Brian Barry-Murphy in his first league game in charge of Cardiff City. The Bluebirds won 2-1 at home to Peterborough. Another Corkman who started well was Bandon’s Conor Hourihane. The former Irish international was appointed manager at Barnsley at the end of last season and on Saturday they won 3-1 away to Plymouth Argyle. But not a good start for another former international Noel Hunt, who is now in charge of Reading. The Biscuitmen lost 2-0 away to Lincoln City.\nThe League action also got under way in Scotland at the weekend where their Premiership got started. Rangers, under former Southampton manager Russell Martin, drew 1-1 away to Motherwell on Saturday while Celtic beat St Mirren 1-0 at Parkhead on Sunday.\nATHLONE ADVANCE\nOn Saturday Athlone Town women’s manager Colin Fortune watched his team claim their second Champions League victory in the space of four days, but he knows they face a big step up in challenge as they progress to the second qualifying stage of Europe’s top competition. The reigning Women’s Premier Division champions followed up their 4-0 win against Cardiff City on Wednesday of last week with an equally assured performance against Croatian club Agram in Lissywollen on Saturday winning 3-0. Maddie Gibson found the net twice before setting up another for midfielder Hannah Waesch in what proved to be a decisive opening half. The win means that Athlone Town are the first League of Ireland women’s team since Raheny United in the 2014-15 season to reach the second qualifying round, for which Athlone will travel to Dutch club FC Twente on August 27 and 30.\nMeanwhile Athlone Town’s new owner Nick Giannoti admitted in an interview at the weekend that he now has a stake in five other clubs, all operating in the lower leagues in their respective countries. The 46-year-old, who was raised in California and is now based in Virginia, made his money from the solar business. He also has a share in Irish League club Larne, English clubs Plymouth Argyle and Truro City, two Italian clubs Campobasso, where an ESPN/Disney docuseries, similar to the one they did on Wrexham, is charting their journey and Serie B club Juve Stabia. His sixth club is Atletico Lisbon who play in Portugal’s third tier. Eight of the 20 men’s League of Ireland clubs now have backing from the USA\nROVERS EXTEND\nLEAGUE LEAD\nBohemians’ chances of overtaking Shamrock Rovers at the top of the League of Ireland Premier Division suffered a setback when they were went down1-0 to Drogheda at Dalymount Park on Friday night. Then on Sunday evening two goals from Rory Gaffney helped Rovers beat Derry City in Tallaght to extend their lead at the top of the table. With just 10 series of games to be played and all the clubs now having played the same number of games, the picture is becoming clearer. It’s looking very much like Rovers, who have 52 points from 26 games, will make up for the disappointment of not winning five in a row in 2024 as they are 10 points clear of second-placed Bohemians and 11 points ahead of Derry City and Drogheda United. Shelbourne, who won away to Sligo at the weekend, are in 5th place on 38 points, but have too much ground to make up to catch the Hoops. St Patrick’s Athletic’s good run in Europe seems to be beneficial for their League form and they won 2-0 away to Waterford on Sunday evening which moves them up to 35 points. At the bottom it’s looking like automatic relegation for Cork City. Despite their win over Galway United at Turner’s Cross on Friday night the Rebel Army are still 8 points adrift of Sligo Rovers.\nLOI results: Bohemians 0, Drogheda Utd 1; Cork City 1, Galway Utd 0; Shamrock Rovers Derry; Sligo Rovers 0, Shelbourne2 ; Waterford 0, St Patrick’s Ath 2.",
