They were engaged the following year.\n1999\nBefore the millennium was the first time Beckham experimented with dye.\nHe tried out highlights before bleaching his curtains peroxide blonde, starting a new grooming trend among men.\nBefore this, hair dye had largely been the preserve of women, but Beckham showed that experimentation was for everyone.\n2000\nIn 2000, the same year Beckham became England’s captain, he stepped onto the pitch with a buzz cut after a decade of long locks.\nIt’s no surprise Beckham opted for a buzz cut: it’s easy to achieve and super-low maintenance, due to the fact that anyone can cut it themselves at home with the a good clipper and the right size guard.\n2001\nThe buzz cut however was a low-maintenance, under-the-radar look – something Beckham is not massively into.\nSo in 2001, he grew it out, and he sported a Mohican which caused mass media attention and scores of football fans emulating the look.\n“I never did it to create attention,” Beckham said in his 2023 Netflix documentary ‘Beckham’, “I’m not that person.”\n2002\nShortly after the birth of his second son, Romeo, in 2002, Beckham started to grow out his hair, bleaching the tips blonde, which started a new craze for ‘frosted tips’.\nFrosted tips kick-started a trend for more dimensional colour in men’s hair, with variations of the look being emulated by the likes of Zac Efron, Joe Jonas and Justin Timberlake.\n2003\nIn 2003, Beckham started to indulge in hair accessories, from head bands to hair bands, growing his hair out once again and sporting slicked-back buns on red carpets.\nHis unkempt locks leant into a more laid-back, bohemian style that was beginning to trend at the time, when Sienna Miller and Kate Moss were fashion’s biggest style icons.\n2006\nIt wasn’t until the mid-Noughties that Beckham began to sport a variation of his iconic ‘short back and sides’ look.\nIt was this year Beckham would also step down as captain of the England football team after being knocked out of the FIFA World Cup.\nBeckham sported a choppy-but-chiselled quiff – a look that would become his signature for years to come.\n2010\nAt the beginning of the 2010s, Beckham sported a modern fohawk, a play on his infamous 2001 look.\nFohawks are not a common cut for barbers these days, but somehow Beckham seemed to reinvent the style to appear much more on-trend.\nHis modernised fohawk inspired looks for countless boy bands and male celebrities throughout the 2010s.\n2011\nFrom one controversial look to another: in 2011 Beckham started sporting a pared-back pompadour.\nKeeping his length longer up top is the key to Beckham’s success in most of his styles. With more options for parting and directing, all the extra length can be used to create a variety of good styles.\nThis longer pompadour look tied into the hipster trend of the time, but it was only a year until Beckham opted for a shorter more polished look.\n2012\nHosting the London Olympics, this year was as big for Britain as it was for Beckham’s hair, and as one of the nation’s biggest icons, Beckham made a noticeable change to his look.\nHis straight back with a side part brought a mature edge to his look. Styled with a dab of matte pomade, a barrel brush and blow dry; Beckham’s new look certainly appeared less effortless than previous ones.\nHe sported his new sleek and sophisticated style at the London Olympics, shortly after debuting it at the Prince and Princess of Wales’ wedding a year prior.2018\nBy the late 2010s, Beckham had gone for a more rugged and choppy style, paired with his now iconic stubble.\nStill styled in a quiff, Beckham shaved the sides considerably shorter, which let his beard do more talking.\nHe sported this classic style at The Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s wedding in 2018, which worked well with an elegant tux.\n2025\nAt 50, Beckham has returned to slightly longer locks, styling his sandy blonde hair brushed up with plenty of height.\nHe’s maintained the choppier styling for a more rugged look as he enters his 50s.\nWhile his colour looks a bit more pallid, with greys poking through, his beard is the same it’s always been.\nAs the first to always try new cuts, his current look is smart but easy: not long enough to require maintenance, but not short enough to cost 20 quid at your barber.\nAs with a lot of his looks, it is fussy without looking like it, which is why Beckham continues to nail male grooming.",
