  "body_text": "From 2008 to the present two MLS sides have four MLS Cup Finals appearances and another has five. Within this era of large crowds, the growth of the DP rule, and things like Allocation Money and U22s, these three most successful clubs over the full-season existence of the Seattle Sounders (MLS team founded in mid-07) show that building success isn't confined to a singular system.\nThat best side isn't a surprise – the LA Galaxy. They get there by spending big money on big players, overpowering everyone. When they have a strong GM this lasts for years.\nSeattle is on that list, all of the big Cup success coming in the Brian Schmetzer era with a roster built on the backend by locals and the top end being high-quality players from fringe communities.\nThe third team on the list is the Columbus Crew, another original MLS team. Their identity is the Reboot. Their finals appearances never had a repeat coach. Their styling has flailed between American-borne national teamers, to locals, to big spending. Crew also changed ownerships in that stretch, including one that seemed completely unconcerned with the local community – they still had a great team. Columbus being reboot heavy shouldn't be a surprise. They spiral down fast.\nBut like a drinking song from the 1990s, they get back up.\nIn the current era the Crew look like a team that will stay up as long as they hold onto their coach. Wilfried Nancy puts together wondrous expositions of skill and talent, with a whiteboard philosophy that is as consistent as it is successful. Nancy is less concerned with the talent he has than that talent's ability to execute his vision – a vision that keeps Crew punching well above their tiny market.\nThis season they do have weaknesses, but those weaknesses are not because of the transfers of attacking talent. Losing Cucho Hernández, Christian Ramirez, Marino Hinestroza, and Aidan Morris over the last season+ should have taken apart their attack. But it's been fine. Crew have the third highest non-pen xG in the league and the fifth highest xG per shot. The attacking quality shouldn't be doubted, even if their raw numbers aren't strong.\nIt's the defense where they falter in 2025.\nCrew have the 12th best xG against and the absolute worst xG per shot against.\nWhy are they struggling and how can Seattle take advantage of that?\n- Very weak at aerial duels\nStares in Cristian, Jackson, Jordan – look for action on attacking set pieces to be closer to fruitful than typical.\n- Stopping opponents from creating chances\nOne of Seattle's strengths is creating chances from individual skill (yes, I know you don't believe it, but compared to the league this is a strength of Seattle).\n- Defending counter attacks\nAgain staring in a healthier Jordan, but also in Kalani and Paulie with a side order of when the underperforming wings play at their best.\n- Defending through ball attacks\nStares in Albert, Pedro, Ryan, Jesús, Cristian and Obed. 2025 Sounders are set up as a team that is supposed to be quite good at throughballs. They attempt them frequently, off by just a foot or so often. But that's against most MLS teams, which by definition either average or good at defending those balls. Columbus is bad at what Seattle wants to do.\nSunday's match, finally getting an even balance between home-away, is between two of the heavyweights in MLS history. It is also a matchup between the Sounders' best styles of attack and the opponent's weaknesses.\nUse our affiliate links to support your bloggers when buying merch and tickets.\nCatching up on Sounder at Heart\nHere's what you missed on the site this week.\nSounders\nNext match: Sunday, July 6 vs. Columbus Crew | 2 pm PT | MLS Season Pass\nGood transit news: There is limited Sounder train service.
