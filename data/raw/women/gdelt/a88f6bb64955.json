That's a conversation that I had in full with them today and yesterday as well, and will continue to do that. Including on the types of munitions that they use and when they use a certain type of munition, how those are delivered to ensure that from a United States perspective they are fulfilling their obligations, their responsibilities.\"\n**\nPrince Harry is calling on British authorities to take further action against the publisher of Britain's Daily Mirror after he was awarded more than $260,000 in a phone hacking lawsuit.\nA judge ruled that Mirror Group Newspapers carried out extensive phone hacking between 2006 and 2011 with Prince Harry's phone targeted between 2003 and 2009.\nThe judge found the executives at the media group were aware of the practice and tried to cover it up.\nPrince Harry's lawyer David Sherborne says the Duke of Sussex wants to see further legal action taken against the publishers.\n\"The acts listed in this judgment are prime examples of what happens when the power of the press is abused. I respectfully call upon the authorities to do their duty to the British public and to investigate bringing charges against the company and those who have broken the law.\"\n**\nQueensland's new premier says he is happy to welcome five new ministers to the cabinet as part of the government's refresh.\nSteven Miles has been officially elected by the Labor caucus as Queensland's 40th premier, after Annastacia Palaszczuk's shock announcement on Sunday that she would resign.\nMr Miles was the only candidate for the leadership after Health Minister Shannon Fentiman withdrew her bid.\n\"I asked the caucus - we asked the caucus - to provide us with fresh faces, with a new team. And I'm pleased to say there will be five new ministers in the first Miles government. That's the most number of new ministers Queensland has seen since we were first elected in 2015. They are younger, they are energetic, they are ready to deliver a fresh approach for Queenslanders.\"\nThe new ministers are Nikki Boyd, Bart Mellish, Lance McCallum, Michael Healy and Charis Mullen, but their portfolios are yet to be confirmed.\nCabinet will also increase by one minister, as Mr Miles says he will not take responsibility for the Olympic and Paralymic games portfolio as Ms Palaszczuk did.\n**\nA new report shows gas will need to be transported to the southern states to avoid shortfalls in supply next winter.\nAn ongoing gas inquiry by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commision has revealed New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania could face shortfalls in locally produced gas during the winter months.\nThe short-term outlook is for sufficient gas to meet demand in 2024, but with a reduced surplus, as east coast producers continue to export gas internationally.\nThe report shows there is sufficient pipeline capacity to transport the required gas south from Queensland.\n**\nFriends and family of late Labor MP Peta Murphy have gathered in Melbourne to remember the life of Ms Murphy.\nPeta Murphy was first elected into Parliament in 2019, just two weeks after the return of her breast cancer.\nThe former barrister's contributions to Australian politics and advocacy work are remembered as inspiring and selfless.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese spoke at the funeral, describing his former colleague as cherished family member who was deeply loved.\n\"Seeing herself as privileged, because she could set an example, she could be visible, she could give heart to those in the same fight. In all this I want to make the point, that while everyone admired the grace and courage Peta showed in her struggle, everyone of us knew she was so much more than what she endured.\"\nThe former squash champion and softball national league player's funeral was held in the at the Melbourne Cricket Ground's Olympic Room.\n**\nThe Spanish women's football team have for the first time ever made it to the top position in FIFA rankings.\nThe winners of this year's Women's World Cup ousted Sweden from the number one spot after several impressive games in the UEFA Women's Nation League.\nThe United States women's team moved into second place in the rankings followed by France.\nThe Matildas currently rank in eleventh place.",
