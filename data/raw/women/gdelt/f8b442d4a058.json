The behaviour of those who think they are invincible must not be tolerated.”\nWorld players’ union FIFPRO said it had written to UEFA urging it to open disciplinary proceedings.\n“Any lack of action by authorities in addressing the conduct of Mr Rubiales would send an entirely unacceptable and damaging message to the football industry and wider society,” it said in a statement.\nEuropean football’s governing body has yet to issue any comment on the Rubiales case.\nThe players, however, have escalated things themselves.\n“From our union we want to emphasize that no woman should feel the need to respond to the forceful images that everyone has seen and of course, they should not be involved in non-consensual attitudes,” they added in their statement.\n“The players of the Spanish Soccer Team, current world champions, expect forceful answers from the public powers so that actions such as those contained do not go unpunished.\n“We want to end this statement by asking for real structural changes that help the national team to continue growing, in order to transfer this great success to later generations.\n“It fills us with sadness that such an unacceptable event is managing to tarnish the greatest sporting success of Spanish women’s football.”",
