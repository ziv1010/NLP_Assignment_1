  "body_text": "The bars and restaurants owned by celebrities across Greater Manchester and Cheshire\nFrom pop stars to footballers, there's plenty of famous faces behind a host of bars and restaurants in the region\nThere has been a long tradition of celebrities becoming restaurateurs over the years in Manchester - from pop icons to footballers and soap star favourites. The lure of owning a brilliant bar, pub or restaurant continues to appeal to famous faces in the fertile foodie turf of Manchester and Cheshire.\nThe latest star to announce a new venture in the hospitality world in the region is Blossoms frontman Tom Ogden. He and wife Katie have announced they will launch the Bohemian Arts Club in Stockport later this Spring.\nThey are transforming a derelict buidling in Stockport's burgeoning Underbanks with what is planned to be a \"chic and intimate cocktail bar\" in the style of a hidden speakeasy. They chose Stockport because the \"area's food and drink scene is really taking off.\"\nRead more: The 50 best restaurants in Greater Manchester right now\nWhile we wait to have a peek inside Tom's new venture, what better time to take a look at some of the key hotspots that are currently owned by famous faces across Manchester and Cheshire?\nTast - Pep Guardiola\nThere's been a long tradition of footballers turning restaurant investors over the years in Manchester- stretching back to the golden days of United legend George Best and his famed venues like Oscar's. Although it's not been quite as common to see a footballing manager get stuck into the hospitality scene.\nBut then there's not many managers like Pep Guardiola. The Manchester City boss is known for his love of fine dining, and so jumped at the chance to invest in Tast Catala when it launched on King Street in the city in 2019.\nOpening with a menu created by two Michelin Star chef Paco Perez, it aims to bring \"The taste of Barcelona to Manchester\". It continues to win great acclaim with its Catalan cuisine, and has long been tipped to win a Michelin Star of its own.\nTast, 20-22 King St, Manchester M2 6AG / w: tastcatala.com\nSmithfield Social - Liam Fray\nCourteeners frontman Liam Fray partnered with two of Manchester's leading hospitality figures to launch The Smithfield Social in the Northern Quarter in 2019. The former Teacup Kitchen was transformed into the new bar by Jobe Ferguson of the Liar's Group and TNQ, and Anthony Fielden also of TNQ.\nThe result was an all-day dining destination, inspired by Liam's favourite hangouts in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. He played a secret gig there last year to the delight of fans and customers.\nAnd it was the obvious place to celebrate when Liam, alongside bandmates Daniel 'Conan' Moores and Michael Campbell, found out The Courteeners had made UK chart history when their album St Jude had made it to Number One in the charts last month.\nSmithfield Social, 53 - 55 Thomas St, Manchester M4 1NA / w: thesmithfieldsocial.com\nAnnies - Jennie McAlpine\nCoronation Street legend Jennie McAlpine and husband Chris Farr realised a lifelong dream when they launched their own restaurant and tea rooms Annies on Old Bank Street in Manchester city centre. Launching amid a flood of publicity in December 2012, it's become a natural hotspot for visiting Corrie fans to the city.\nJennie says she's always happy to chat to fans when they do pop by for the venue's award-winning afternoon teas or hearty lunch dishes. She previously told the MEN: \"I get a variety of reactions, I came out of the toilet one day and a woman started having a panic attack when she saw me, I was like: “Yes, it’s me!”\n“Yes, people do come into the restaurant because they hope to see me, but they also come because they want the lunch, and the lovely warm welcome, all of our staff have the same ethos of looking after people as we do.\n“I always just think it’s really nice. Corrie is in your living room five nights a week, so people feel they know you, people relate to you.”\nAnnies, 5 Old Bank St, Manchester M2 7PE / w: anniesmanchester.co.uk\nThe Spinn Off - Adam Thomas\nWaterloo Road star Adam Thomas and his old school pal Scott Graham are the duo behind The Spin Off bar in Stockport's burgeoning Underbanks. They had long had dreams of owning a joint venture together and initially launched The Spinn restaurant in Gatley in 2019.\nThey decided to close the doors of the original site last year, to focus instead on \"the next chapter\" with The Spin Off bar, and also the rapidly-expanding Oh My Glaze empire created by Scott.\nAt The Spin Off you'll find a range of craft beers, natural wines and cocktails til 1am at weekends. And on Sunday you will find \"Pie Sundays\" where they serve up pie and mash courtesy of Patel's Pies.\nThe Spin Off, 19 Little Underbank, Stockport SK1 1LA / w: thespinn.com\nBohemian Arts Club - Tom Ogden\nThe newest arrival on the celebrity-owned bar circuit will be just across the road from The Spin Off in Stockport's Underbanks. Blossoms star Tom Ogden and his stylist wife Katie are transforming a derelict building into Bohemian Arts Club which is due to open in April.\nSplit over three floors, the speakeasy style bar space will be accessed via a \"secret\" entrance over the top two floors, while the ground floor will host Katie's beauty salon.\nTom told the MEN earlier this year: \"When we took on the building it was completely derelict so it's taken a long time to get it to this point. I've known Katie for a long time and for as long as I can remember she's always wanted to have a salon with a speakeasy bar in it.\n\"When we've been travelling on tour, we've been to places like Japan and New York and you find these really quirky off the beaten track bars that we ended up falling in love with. So at the start of 2021 we said 'why don't we do this in Stockport?\"\nBohemian Arts Club, 18-20 Lower Hillgate, Stockport / w: bohemianartsclub.com\nMenagerie - Seema Malhotra and Stacey Forsey\nReal Housewives of Cheshire stars Seema Malhotra and Stacey Forsey revealed they were investors in the oh-so-glam Menagerie bar back in 2017, alongside bar founder Karina Jadhav. The New Bailey venue is known for its lavish pink interiors and runway through the restaurant where there is a regular roster of live entertainment.\nSpeaking about it on the Real Housewives of Cheshire show at the time, Stacey said: \"I'm very excited about the venture. It's always been my dream to be involved in the hospitality industry on this level.\n\"To be part of such an exciting venture with two amazing women as Karina and Seema is fantastic and I'm looking forward to seeing the business flourish even more over the next few years.\" And flourish it has.\nThe bar and restaurant space has gone from strength to strength since then, hosting some of the biggest celebrities like Justin Timberlake and Kevin Hart, as well as regular visits from the Real Housewives ladies, Corrie and reality stars.\nMenagerie, New Bailey, Ground One, New Bailey St, Salford M3 5JL / w: menagerierestaurant.co.uk\nD13 Irish bar - Shane Lynch and Sheena Lynch\nBoyzone star Shane Lynch and his wife Sheena moved to Cheshire in 2021 - and swiftly brought the luck of the Irish with them, with Shane launching his own D13 Irish bar in Knutsford. Sheena would soon after become even further embedded in Cheshire life when she was invited to join the Real Housewives of Cheshire show on ITVBe.\nD13 refers to the Dublin postcode where Shane grew up, and the 300-year-old building on King Street has been transformed over three levels to offer a \"boutique bar\" experience taking the visitor on a journey from \"traditional to modern Ireland\". It also boasts a huge outdoor terrace and \"Guinness Garden\" painted in black that is a big hit as soon as the sun shines.\nThe Lynches own the business alongside their long-time friend and movie stunt driver Nathan Gerhold. They say they've been \"blown away\" by their warm welcome to Knutsford from both customers and other business owners in the area.\nShane previously told the MEN: \"We were friendly outsiders coming into Cheshire but Knutsford has really looked after us. Myself I'm an Irishman, my wife is from London, Nathan is from Brighton - we're nomads - we've travelled up here a long way and Cheshire has made us very, very welcome, everyone has made us so welcome. \"\nD13, 50 King St, Knutsford WA16 6DT / @d13knutsford\nDexter and Jones - Adam Rickitt and Katy Rickitt\nProving Knutsford is something of a hotbed for celebrity-owned bars, just up the street from D13 you'll find the bar run by showbiz husband and wife team Adam Rickitt and Katy Rickitt. Former Coronation Street and Hollyoaks star Adam and ITV presenter Katy have been running the craft beer and artisan gin and fine wine shop and bar for the past three years.\nSince then they have delighted fans with their regular TikToks inside the bar with some hilarious dance videos. They also post about upcoming events there like fashion swap shops and their ever-popular fortnightly \"Dexters Quiz Night\".\nPosting about their three year anniversary, the couple wrote on Instagram: \"In those three years we've danced through a pandemic, handed you beers in your PJs and knocked down walls. All that really matters is that you've stuck with us....\n\"Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Katy's mopping hasn't gotten any better since her first shift, but every day you do!\"\nDexter and Jones, 10 Princess St, Knutsford WA16 6DD / w: dexterandjones.co.uk\nRosso - Rio Ferdinand\nRosso, which is the Italian word for red, was first opened in the city in 2009 by Manchester United and England great Rio Ferdinand amid a fanfare of publicity. Rio, along with investors, opened the classic Italian restaurant in the stunning former bank building at the top of Manchester's King Street.\nIt soon became the playground of the rich and famous, with Manchester United Christmas parties held there and famous faces including One Direction's Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson hailing it their favourite restaurant in Manchester.\nPhotos of the hundreds of celebrities who visited used to adorn the walls, before a sleek refurbishment in 2017 gave the restaurant a new understated white and gold styling. It's become known for its incredible Christmas decorations and this year it went to town with its Valentine decor too.\nWhile Rio is no longer based in Manchester after retiring from football, he regularly pops back to the city and hosted his big 40th birthday bash at Rosso as well as celebrating milestones with his wife Katie (pictured above).\nRosso, 43 Spring Gardens, Manchester M2 2BG / w: rossorestaurant.com\nStock Market Grill and Cafe Football - Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs\nThe former footballing team-mates at Old Trafford found a winning combination when it comes to hospitality. Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs formed GG Hospitality together after they hung up the football boots and have launched a number of ventures since.\nTheir first big hit was with Hotel Football and Cafe Football in the shadow of their beloved Old Trafford. Cafe Football boasts a sports-themed menu and nods to Reds icons in the menus.\nMeanwhile Gary has overseen the transformation of the old Stock Exchange in Manchester into a luxurious hotel. The venue opened with a restaurant from celebrity chef Tom Kerridge, Bull & Bear, but the pair announced their mutual decision to part ways at the end of 2022.\nThe new restaurant in the hotel will be the eagerly-anticipated Stock Market Grill from the award-winning team behind Schofield's Bar - brothers Joe and Daniel Schofield. The new restaurant will open on March 1.\nAnd we can expect more to come from Gary in the years to come, with big developments underway at his St Michael's development in the city centre. Set to be coming to the top of the building is a new Japanese Peruvian restaurant Chotto Matte.\nCafe Football, 99 Sir Matt Busby Way, Old Trafford, Stretford, Manchester M16 0SZ / w: hotelfootball.com\nStock Exchange Hotel, 4 Norfolk St, Manchester M2 1DW / w: stockexchangehotel.co.uk\nSymposium - Ashley Taylor Dawson\nLong-standing Hollyoaks favourite Ashley Taylor-Dawson is also a club owner in his native Wilmslow. While we all know him for his acting skills, Ashley is also passionate about music and the live music scene.\nAnd so when the opportunity arose to go into business with restaurateurs George Yiannis and Nicos Georgiou, the Symposium bar and nightclub in his native Wilmslow was born. The concept was to create a great late night cocktail bar and live music venue.\nWhen it opened back in 2016, he told the MEN: \"I was originally looking at opening something in Manchester, but I moved back to Wilmslow with my family a couple of years ago and found myself falling in love with the place again. This seemed to me a prime spot and I think Wilmslow is crying out for a bar like our with live music, small plates food, great wine and cocktails, everything that we like to offer.\n\"My vision was to make this a hub of entertainment and the arts, music will be at the forefront of what we do we’ve got some fantastic musicians and jazz bands on board.\"\nSymposium, 70a Grove St, Wilmslow SK9 1DS / w: thesymposium.co.uk\nGullivers and The Castle - Rupert Hill\nSimilarly to Ashley Taylor-Dawson, former Coronation Street star Rupert Hill has also long had a passion for music and has played in a number of bands. Along with fellow bandmate Jonny Booth, they seized the opportunity to take on the historic Castle Hotel in the Northern Quarter and nurture a music hall inside back in 2010.\nThe concept was to create a warm and welcoming pub and creative space. Since then they have welcomed in the likes of Elbow and Mark Owen, and have a regular roster of live music all through the week.\nIn 2013 they would go on to do the same again with Gullivers pub just a few yards down the road on Oldham Street. A sympathetic renovation there has also seen it become a popular live music spot in the Northern Quarter.\nThe Castle, 6 Oldham St, Manchester M4 1LE / w: thecastlehotel.info\nGullivers, 109 Oldham St, Manchester M4 1LW / w: gulliversnq.info\nRead next:-\n- Manchester's 15 best bars - from rooftop terraces to drinking dens\n- The best restaurants and takeaways open late at night in Manchester\n- The 20 amazing places you need to visit in Greater Manchester in 2023\n- The prettiest villages to visit near Greater Manchester in 2023\n- Best restaurants in Manchester with a view",
