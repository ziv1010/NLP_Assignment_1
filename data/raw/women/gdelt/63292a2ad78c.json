Plan your afternoons accordingly.\nTuesday afternoon Cardinal news and notes\nSable bourbon loves the Cards.\n—It’s postseason game day for the Louisville baseball team, which takes on Pittsburgh in the first round of the ACC Tournament at 5 p.m. Here’s a preview.\n—U of L was the top revenue producer in the ACC for the 2023-24 athletic season.\n—The Athletic ranks Lamar Jackson as the No. 5 college football player of the last 25 years.\n5. Lamar Jackson, QB, Louisville\nCareer: 9,043 yards, 57%, 69 TDs, 27 INTs, 146.6 rating; 655 rushes, 4,132 yards, 50 TDs\nBest season: 2016; 3,543 yards, 56.2%, 30 TDs, 9 INTs, 148.8 rating; 260 rushes, 1,571 yards, 21 TDs\nA three-star recruit from South Florida, Jackson became a spectacular one-man show at Louisville. He was as dynamic a runner as Michael Vick but a much more prolific passer.\nHe carried the Cardinals to a 9-4 record and No. 20 final ranking in 2016, which included a close 42-36 loss to eventual national champion Clemson in Death Valley. In that game, Jackson ran for 162 yards and two touchdowns and passed for 295 yards and another touchdown. In one dazzling breakout performance at Syracuse, he ran for 199 yards and passed for 411 yards with eight total touchdowns. The week after the Syracuse game, he led Louisville to a 63-20 romp over No. 2 FSU behind his four rushing touchdowns, putting up the most points the Noles had ever allowed in a game.\nVick, watching it all, tweeted: “Lamar Jackson 5x better than I was at V-Tech.”\nJackson ran away with the Heisman Trophy in 2016, getting 80 percent of the first-place votes to become the youngest player to ever win it at 19. The next year, Jackson rushed for 1,601 yards and 18 touchdowns despite defenses being so geared up to slow him down. When Jackson left, the Cardinals fell to 2-10 and 0-8 in the ACC and Bobby Petrino was fired.\nCam Newton tops the list.\n—Eric Crawford writes that Jackson could have justifiably been ranked even higher.\n—Cardinal QB commit Briggs Cherry is the guest on the latest episode of the Cardinal Authority podcast.\n—The Full Court Network podcast discusses Louisville as one of the big winners of the college basketball offseason so far.\n—Russ is still doing Russ stuff.\n—David Hale puts Miller Moss in Tier 3 of his ranking of all 136 quarterbacks in the FBS.\n—Larry Demeritte, the inspirational trainer of 2024 Kentucky Derby contender West Saratoga, has died at age 75 after a decades-long battle with cancer.\n—Top-35 wing Kayden Allen is transferring to Zephryhills Christian Academy in Tampa, Florida for his senior season. Louisville is one of the schools that has had the most contact with the class of 2026 hooper.\n—Matt McGavic shares his breakdown of new Louisville hoops commit Mouhamed Camara.\nPolish: As you can probably guess by now, Camara’s offensive game lags a little behind his capabilities on defense. With how well he moves and how explosive he is, Camara has the potential to be an elite slasher - he just has to get the reps in and improve with how he moves with the ball in his hands. He does carry the threat of the three, as evidenced by his 37.5 percent shooting on long balls in NBA Academy Africa events this past year, but his jump shot is a little slow with a slightly inconsistent release. Back over on defense, Camara does a fantastic job with timing his swipes for one-on-one steals, and usually doesn’t bite on pump fakes whenever he’s looking to block a shot. When it comes to rebounding, he has great timing with his actual jumps to grab the ball, although his ability to box out is so-so.\nBottom Line: Overall, this is a pickup that has some fantastic long term potential. Sure, Camara does have a few things to clean up, and he does need to bring his offensive game up to par with his efforts on defense. But he is extremely athletic, and is very far along in terms of his basketball IQ for someone with his athletic intangibles. Once he gets his feet wet in college ball this upcoming year, Camara has a very high ceiling for the 2026-27 season and beyond.\n—Racing Louisville’s Emma Sears has been called up to the U.S. Women’s National Team for their upcoming friendly matches.\n—Athlon writes about Eddie George’s next act as the head coach at Bowling Green. His Falcons will face Louisville at L&N Stadium on Sept. 20.\n—Arizona and UCLA will meet in the “Bill Walton Legacy Tribute Game” on Nov. 14. A cool way to keep that rivalry alive.\n—Green is good.\n—New details have emerged to explain why “Hard Knocks” pulled the plug on a series with the North Carolina Tar Heels.\n—The USC-Notre Dame rivalry is on the brink of ending this fall. The two sides see the situation very differently, with talks ongoing.\n—Joe Lunardi’s updated Bracketology for the 2026 men’s NCAA Tournament has Louisville as a 6-seed.\n—I am so ready to watch this guy play again.\n—The CJ looks at what needs to happen for Louisville to crash the College Football Playoff in year three of the Jeff Brohm era.\n—Louisville is one of the schools most in contact with 5-star PG Dylan Mingo.\n—The U of L women’s team finished as the runner-up at the outdoor ACC track and fiel championships.\n—And finally, beat Pitt.",
