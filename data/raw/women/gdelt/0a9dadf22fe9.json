I was 19 years old, more interested in girls than politics, and thought of life behind the Iron Curtain as more novelty than terror. There was little visible suffering or hardship. * * * * Not until much later, after I’d heard years of stories from Russians who’d lived through harder times, did I start to understand the brutal system whose end I got to witness. Parents of friends talked about going on vacations and trying to guess who was the... -\n18-time felon, on probation for ‘Puffy Coat Bandit’ thefts, is charged with theft again. ( Chicago )\nCHICAGO — An 18-time convicted felon on probation for being part of the “Puffy Coat Bandit” theft ring was arrested Sunday after he committed the exact same crime that he’s on probation for, according to prosecutors: stealing a man’s credit cards and using them almost immediately to buy things at Target. During an initial appearance this week, Judge Susana Ortiz released Jerome Sharp, 30, with a nighttime curfew. He was not detained for violating probation. One year ago, the “Puffy Coat Bandits” were the talk of the town as they slithered through restaurants in their bulky winter coats, stealing phones,... -\nVideo: Biden apologizes for calling Laken Riley's kiIIer an \"illegal\" -“They built this country.\"\nBREAKING: Biden apologizes for calling Laken Riley's kiIIer an \"illegal\" \"I'm not gonna treat any of these people with disrespect.

The ‘80s has “Stranger Things,” “The Wedding Singer” and “Hot Tub Time Machine,” to name just a few movies honoring the decade. The ‘90s? We’re still waiting, and flops like “Mid90s,” Jonah Hill’s respectable debut as writer/director, don’t count.It’s still the last decade when free speech reigned supreme. Political correctness began in that era, but it didn’t fully take over Hollywood …... -\nNew Report Confirms Brad Raffensperger’s Office Committed a Crime in Jan. 2021 (Trump's Phone Call Was Illegally Recorded)\nOn Thursday Mollie Hemingway at The Federalist confirmed our reporting from February last year.

For the nation of Israel, this time of correction is called Jacob's Trouble, or the Tribulation. In Israel and the Tribulation, Amir Tsarfati looks at Israel's rebellion against God before the period of correction begins, the peace and the horror the nation will experience during that time, and the spiritual restoration that will take place when the seven years conclude. Israel abandoned the relationship that God loved for religion which He hates. It is the remnant that survives the Tribulation who will return once again to the relationship the Lord wants. You can find a... -\nFury at $65,000-a-Year Chelsea Private School as Event Sells Anti-Israel Merch\nParents at the ultra-exclusive Avenues The World School are outraged after it was revealed that last weekend the Chelsea campus was rented out for a Ramadan & Eid Holiday Bazaar where vendors hawked “From The River To The Sea, Palestine Will Be Free” merchandise.

Despite this, the Americans remained active in post-war Philippines and its politics. The CIA, adept in covert operations, combined psychological, cultural, and political warfare into one. It was this type of operation that they used as a weapon in the Philippines, using the mythical aswang against the people. The aswang doesn’t have an exact match in the Western pantheon of monsters. Some people call it a vampire, but it feeds on more than just blood (organs, unborn children, phlegm) and it can take on... -\nHunter Biden’s competing approaches in court to his laptop contents\nHunter Biden’s computer data, long a source of national scrutiny, is now a central feature in his various legal battles, but the first son is handling the data in different ways depending on the case, according to his court filings.

The government had supported the proposed changes, which would have widened the definition of the family and clarified out-dated language about the duties of women in society. \"I think it's clear at this stage, that the family amendment and the care amendment referendums have been defeated,\" Varadkar said at a press conference in Dublin.The votes are the latest attempt to reflect the changing face of European Union member Ireland, and the waning influence of the once-dominant... -\nDelays, violent crime: Report card on NYC subway reveals a system in crisis\nIf you slogged around during the first month of 2024 on the subways, you probably felt like there was a major delay every way you turned, and when you did get on the train, you were one wrong flicker of eye contact away from being a crime victim. With subway ridership hovering around 71% of pre-COVID normal, bus ridership at 60% of normal, and commuter rail at about three-quarters, we don’t want to lose any more riders to bad service or fear. But keeping straphangers riding the MTA will take work, just as the system has never felt more imperiled.... -\nFans offer condolences to USC football coach Lincoln Riley after Biden flubbed murdered nursing student’s name\nHe’s not dead yet. Fans and well-wishers of University of Southern California football coach Lincoln Riley took to social media this week to offer faux condolences after President Biden accidentally mentioned his name during his State of the Union address on Thursday.
