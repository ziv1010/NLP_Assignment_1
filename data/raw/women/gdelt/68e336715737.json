We've been training since mid-January and the numbers at training has been the best that I've ever known. The players are more keen than I've ever known,\" Walter told the Mercury.\n\"I feel like everyone who played last year now has an understanding of how tough the (WPL) competition is. And it's encouraged a lot of other players to come and want to play in the Women's Premier League.\"\nWhile excited about the year ahead, Walter admitted that his side faced a tough outing against Harbour this Sunday.\n\"It doesn't get any tougher than playing the team that won last year's grand final,\" he said.\n\"It wasn't just that they won the grand final, but their youth grade team had success in the State Cup too. We believe that a lot of those girls will probably step up into first grade. They've also got a new coach and some changes, so they're going to be really tough.\n\"We expect them to be even better than what they were last year, but that's a really good challenge for us. And that's what's so good about this comp.\"",
