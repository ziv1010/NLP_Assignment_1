And how will Wales fare in their first major tournament?\nBBC Sport takes a deeper look at the four teams involved.\nEngland\nManager: Sarina Wiegman Nationality: Dutch Appointed: 2021\nCaptain: Leah Williamson Position: Central defender Club: Arsenal\nKey player: Lauren Hemp Position: Forward Club: Manchester City\nForm: England missed out on top spot in their Euro qualifying group, coming second behind fellow Group D side France. Sarina Wiegman's side did, however, win their most recent meeting with Les Bleues.\nBut question marks have been raised over their form of late, with a convincing 6-0 win against Portugal in the Women's Nations League sandwiched between defeats by Belgium and Spain, although they did beat the latter in February.\nTournament hopes: Expectations will be high for an England side who ended the country's 56-year wait for a major trophy - men's or women's - when they beat Germany at Wembley in the 2022 final.\nBut, after reaching the final of the 2023 World Cup, the Lionesses have suffered a dip in form, plus a number of key players are in a race to be fully fit in time, while the absence of Mary Earps (retired) and Millie Bright (unavailable) means the squad is without some of its most experienced names.\nTo make things even more uncertain, they've been handed perhaps the toughest group and even getting out of the group stage could be a big ask.\nFrance\nManager: Laurent Bonadei Nationality: French Appointed: 2024\nCaptain: Griedge Mbock Position: Centre-back Club: PSG\nKey player: Sandy Baltimore Position: Winger Club: Chelsea\nForm: France qualified for Euro 2025 as group leaders but they did suffer defeats against England and the Republic of Ireland during that campaign.\nHowever, they arrive in Switzerland on a hot run of form having won all six of their Nations League matches this year, conceding just two goals.\nTournament hopes: France have generally been ranked among the favourites for each major tournament in recent times but they have always seemed to fall short, failing to reach a final at either the Euros or the World Cup.\nWith a wealth of attacking and defensive talent, Laurent Bonadei's Les Bleues have lost just two of their matches since he took charge in August - to world champions Spain and, more surprisingly, Switzerland last October.\nThe Netherlands\nManager: Andries Jonker Nationality: Dutch Appointed: 2022\nCaptain: Sherida Spitse Position: Midfielder Club: Ajax\nKey player: Vivianne Miedema Position: Forward Club: Man City\nForm: The Netherlands won only two qualifying matches but they finished level on points with top-placed Italy. They scored just four goals during that campaign but they were solid at the back - only letting in four goals.\nHowever, their last Nations League matches were not what they would have hoped for five weeks before the Euros - a 1-1 draw with Scotland after Germany had thrashed them 4-0 at the end of May.\nTournament hopes: There has been an excitement around the Netherlands heading into Euro 2025 under Jonker, who will depart after the tournament and be replaced by England assistant Arjan Veurink.\nThe Dutch team have continued to develop a host of bright new talent with the likes of Barcelona's Esmee Brugts, as well as Chelsea's Wieke Kaptein and Veerle Buurman, while they still have the experienced stars like Vivianne Miedema and Sherida Spitse, who both contributed to their Euros success in 2017.\nWales\nManager: Rhian Wilkinson Nationality: Canadian Appointed: 2024\nCaptain: Angharad James Position: Midfielder Club: Seattle Reign\nKey player: Jess Fishlock Position: Forward Club: Seattle Reign\nForm: Wales lost only one of their 10 games in qualifying for Euro 2025 but they were facing weaker teams in League B before they qualified for their first major tournament through the play-offs by beating the Republic of Ireland.\nThey have struggled since making the step up to League A in the Nations League, finishing bottom of their group without a win. Wales did earn two encouraging draws with Sweden this year but they fell to Italy and Denmark in their final two group games.\nTournament hopes: Getting through the 'group of death' won't be easy for Wales but they have become a very difficult side to beat under Rhian Wilkinson.\nHaving recently impressed against the higher ranked sides, Wales will be keen to make an impression on their major tournament debut and be competitive in Switzerland.\n- Published23 June 2025\n- Published27 June 2025\n- Published23 June 2025",
