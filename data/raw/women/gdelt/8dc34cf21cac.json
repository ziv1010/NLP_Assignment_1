  "body_text": "They play ... football. Only the biggest sport in the world.\nI support them because ... as embarrassing at it is to say, baby blue is my favourite colour. So that was the initial hook when I felt like I should start supporting a team in the sport I have played my whole life.\nYou should also be a Manchester City fan ... because they always have fine looking kits. As well as their support and growth in the women's game. Of course there is still a massive gap, but any step forward is good.\nMy favourite moment ... 2012 winning the Premier League in stoppage time.\nMy all-time favourite player is ... Kevin de Bruyne. Although he has since left the club. He hooked me in from the first watch — what a slick player.\nMy favourite current player is ... favourite men’s player is Phil Foden. Favourite women’s player is Alex Greenwood.\nThe future for my team is ... hopefully the women's team can knock off Chelsea to win the Women's Super League. They are sitting close in second place. The dream would be for both the men's and women's team to win the Champions League one day.",
