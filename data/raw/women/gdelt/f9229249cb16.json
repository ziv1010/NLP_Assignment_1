We're craving bit of normality and hopefully this redevelopment will allow that.\"\nThe Saints will begin their season at home for the first time since returning to the competition in 2022, and will face East Devonport on Saturday, April 12.\nBilling praised the Circular Head Council for recognising the severity of the problem, and thanked the company responsible for providing a magnificent surface.\nAs for further developments at the ground, Billing shared what he would like to see.\n\"Looking into the future, what we need is a bit of expansion to accommodate women's football,\" he said.\n\"For us, we're only entering our second year [in that competition]. So whether it will be sustainable, and the council will want proof of that, I dare say.\n\"But there's always an air of uncertainty because we're negotiating with the council.\"\nThe restoration work has been recognised by AFL Tasmania, with the project named the 2024 Ken Gannon Community Football Facilities award for the state.",
