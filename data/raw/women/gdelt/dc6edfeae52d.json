  "body_text": "Vienna crime figures questioned after analysis of “system breakers”\nSociologist Günther Ogris has criticised the way police crime statistics are compiled, arguing that three so-called “system breakers” significantly distort the numbers, according to Der Standard. He said the current methodology, used since 2018, uses a complex index that mixes suspects, actions and offences, inflating the number of “suspects”.\nThis means that one person could be counted multiple times – sometimes hundreds or even over a thousand times – if they commit multiple acts or are linked to several offences in one case.\nDespite this, the BMI still publishes the number under the headline “Tatverdächtige” (“suspects”), even though it is no longer a headcount.\nOgris pointed out that removing three prolific offenders from the 2024 data would turn a reported rise in suspects into a decline. He also noted that the same issue particularly affects youth crime figures in Vienna, where those three individuals represented nearly a third of all “suspects”. So, a huge chunk of the Viennese “youth crime wave” is actually due to just three prolific offenders being counted over and over again.\nHe recommended returning to a per-person method of counting and highlighted that judicial statistics show a decades-long decline in convictions.\nSlovenia approves extradition request in Graz missing person case\nSlovenian authorities have agreed to extradite the ex-partner of a missing 31-year-old Graz woman, according to ORF Steiermark. The man is in custody in Slovenia and has remained silent during questioning. Searches in his burned-out car found no trace of the woman.\nPolice say the suspect reportedly crossed the border several times before the disappearance. The woman, considered reliable by colleagues and relatives, failed to attend a planned photo shoot on Sunday, prompting the missing person report.\nTwo men arrested in Graz — the suspect’s brother and stepfather — are also being questioned but have so far remained silent. The police stressed that rumours circulating online, including claims a body had been found, are false. All suspects are presumed innocent.\nAustria’s U17 football team return as World Cup runners-up\nAustria’s U17 team lost 1–0 to Portugal in the World Cup final in Doha. The decisive goal came in the 32nd minute, ending hopes of a first major tournament title for Austria.\nDespite the defeat, the team impressed with six wins earlier in the tournament, including victories over England and Italy. Austria’s best chances in the final came just after half-time, and a late shot struck the post.\nForward Johannes Moser finished as the tournament’s top scorer with eight goals. The team will be welcomed back at the ÖFB campus in Aspern on Saturday.\nTeen previously convicted over Westbahnhof terror plot arrested again\nA 15-year-old boy who previously planned a terrorist attack at Vienna’s Westbahnhof has been detained again after a house search in Vienna-Hernals uncovered “relevant material”, according to Kurier.\nThe teenager was conditionally released in late October after being sentenced earlier this year. Police say he adhered to his conditions, but monitoring showed continued interest in radical Islamist propaganda and weapons.\nHe is now suspected of involvement in a criminal organisation and a criminal conspiracy and is being held in pre-trial detention. He remains presumed innocent.\nWhat’s happening in Austria today\nStatistik Austria is due to release several national datasets, including new figures on arrivals and overnight stays for October, producer prices for October, and updated production and construction statistics. These data will feed into ongoing discussions about prices and the cost of living.\nIn Vienna, the Volksoper stages Die Fledermaus at 7pm, while Vivaldi’s Four Seasons is performed at the Karlskirche. In Lower Austria, the Festspielhaus St Pölten hosts Orchestra Baobab. Burgenland’s “Mörbischer Winterwunder” continues on Lake Neusiedl, and Salzburg’s Mozarteum presents its “Christmas in Salzburg” programme.\nAustria’s women’s national handball team open their World Championship campaign in Rotterdam against Egypt at 6pm, with ORF SPORT+ covering the match. In the ADMIRAL 2. Liga, Amstetten host Austria Lustenau at 6pm, while the ICE Hockey League features EC iDM Wärmepumpen VSV versus Black Wings Linz and later EC-KAC against Pioneers Vorarlberg. The FIH Men’s Junior World Cup also continues in India.\nA disturbance approaching from the west brings cloud and some rain to the northern and western regions. Snow is expected from around 800 to 1200 metres. Maximum temperatures range from 2C to 9C. Vienna will be mostly cloudy with highs around 7C and a slight chance of drizzle. ASFINAG expects heavy traffic on major routes ahead of the Advent shopping weekend, and avalanche services in the west report low but present risks on steep, north-facing slopes.\nVocabulary\ndie Kriminalstatistik – crime statistics\nder Tatverdächtige – suspect\ndie Hausdurchsuchung – house search\nder Vizeweltmeister – runner-up world champion\ndie Untersuchungshaft – pre-trial detention\nIf you have any questions about life in Austria, ideas for articles, or news tips for The Local, you can contact us at news@thelocal.at or leave a comment below.",
