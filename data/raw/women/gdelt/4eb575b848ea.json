Am I happy to have scored my first senior goal? Of course I am!”\nHeading into today’s cup game, the 17-year-old reflected: “I think we should treat it like any other match, focus on our football, play our football and we’ve got the confidence, we’ve got the belief. Just treat it like any other match.\nBillericay feature two players who left Town in the summer, Maddie Biggs and Olivia Smith, with the former having netted four times on her debut last week in a 6-0 away hammering of Plymouth Argyle.\nMeanwhile, Polly Turner’s hip injury, which she sustained at Cardiff last week and forced her to spend a night in hospital, isn’t as serious as initially feared, and she is expected to return to training soon.\nKeeper Nina Meollo, 19, has joined FAWNL Division One South East side Cambridge City on a season-long loan.\nPhoto: ITFC\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
