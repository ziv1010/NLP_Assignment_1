  "body_text": "Aston Villa vs Leicester - WSL preview: TV channel, live stream, team news & prediction\nIn-form Aston Villa take on Leicester at Villa Park on Women's Football Weekend looking to cement their place as best of the rest outside of the big four.\nCarla Ward's side showed what they're capable of in the FA Cup quarter-finals, dispatching heavily fancied Manchester City 2-1 to book a place in the last four for the first time in their history.\nThat result follows a run of three wins and two defeats in Villa's last five WSL games, which is significantly better form than what Leicester have been able to produce this season.\nWillie Kirk's Foxes are glued to the bottom of the table after another difficult season, and know they must start churning out results soon if they're to mirror last season's great escape.\nWhere to watch Aston Villa vs Leicester on TV/live stream\n- When is kick off? Sunday 26 March, 14:00 (GMT)\n- Where is the match being played? Villa Park\n- Referee? Jane Simms\nAston Villa team news\nEmily Gielnik misses out against Leicester because of ankle injury, while Ruesha Littlejohn is also sidelined with the knee injury he picked up against West Ham.\nRemi Allen, Simone Magill and Chantelle Boye-Hlorkah are not yet ready for first-team action, and Meaghan Sargeant and Natasha Harding are long-term casualties.\nLeicester team news\nWillie Kirk revealed in his pre-match press conference that Jess Sigsworth's recovery from an anterior cruciate ligament injury sustained in February 2022 is going well, and that she may feature before the end of the season.\nThe same can be said for Shannon O'Brien and Abbie McManus, but they won't be available to play at Villa Park.\nAston Villa vs Leicester score prediction\nIt's hard to look past Aston Villa repeating the victory they picked up over Leicester in September, when Rachel Daly and the aforementioned Gielnik eased the Villans to three points at King Power Stadium.\nThe hosts are in good form and confidence is riding high after beating City in the FA Cup - Daly is also in tremendous form individually in her more favoured role up front.\nLeicester will be no pushovers as they trail Brighton by just a point in the WSL table, but may struggle to have the firepower to earn all three points given they've scored just seven goals all season.",
