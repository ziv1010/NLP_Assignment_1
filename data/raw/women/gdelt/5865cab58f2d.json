  "body_text": "Nine Bodies in a Mexican Morgue\n9.25pm, BBC One\nAnd Then There Were None meets Lost in Anthony Horowitz’s fun mystery thriller. A plane crashes in the Mexican jungle with 10 people on board – but only nine bodies are later found and sent to the morgue. Who is the last person alive and where are they? Flashbacks reveal all in a high-energy series starring Eric McCormack and Siobhán McSweeney (with a dodgy American accent). Hollie Richardson\nJamie: What to Eat This Week\n5.4opm, Channel 4\nA seasonal compilation episode sees Jamie Oliver rustle up dishes to celebrate autumn. His inspiring (or infuriating, depending on your point of view) ability to make complex cookery look achievable is on display as he presents a smoky sweetcorn burger and a delicious-looking mushroom curry with ginger-infused rice. Phil Harrison\nStrictly Come Dancing\n6.55pm, BBC One\nVicky and Kai! Alex and Johannes! Ellie and Vito! Jimmy and Lauren! These are just some of the names you’ll be cheering on as the brand new Strictly couples take to the floor for their first dances. Thankfully, no one will be voted off this week, but they’ll be eager to impress the paddle-wielding judges. HR\nWin Win\n7pm, ITV1\nPunters at home can win the same prizes as the studio contestants in this big shiny gameshow, and as well as interactivity it offers the sweetener of seeing hosts Mel and Sue back on telly together – and they’re as warm and funny as ever. This week they give away holidays, cars and the chance to become a “million-ruddy-aire”. Jack Seale\nBanned in the 80s: Moments That Shook Music\n9.25pm, BBC Two\nMusic videos such as Madonna’s Like a Prayer and Queen’s I Want to Break Free broke cultural barriers in the 1980s – which, says this documentary, is the decade bursting with the most controversial music. Frankie Goes to Hollywood, NWA and George Michael are also in the spotlight. HR\nThe Football Interview\n11.55pm, BBC One\nKelly Somers attempts to circumvent modern media training by peppering footballers with questions about their lives on and off the pitch. This week it’s the turn of former Spanish international Andoni Iraola, once the Athletic Bilbao right back and now running a tight ship as the Bournemouth manager. Graeme Virtue\nFilm choice\nThe Man in My Basement , out now, Disney+\nThe set-up of Nadia Latif’s edgy, unsettling film, taken from a Walter Mosley novel, screams horror. Charles (Corey Hawkins) is jobless, in debt and about to lose the home his family has lived in for eight generations. Then the mysterious Anniston (Willem Dafoe) offers to rent his basement for $1,000 a day for 65 days, no questions asked. But we’re in Jordan Peele territory here, where the well-worked genre tropes – which set two men with dark pasts against each other – are also a conduit to explore Black American history and highlight truths about racism. Simon Wardell\nEvil Does Not Exist, 10.05pm, BBC Four\nStill waters run deep in this reflective drama from Ryusuke “Drive My Car” Hamaguchi, set in a woodland community at one with nature. Tokyo-based consultants Takahashi (Ryuji Kosaka) and Mayzumi (Ayaka Shibutani) arrive to promote a proposed glamping site. But local oddjob man Takumi (Hitoshi Omika), who is raising his eight-year-old daughter Hana (Ryo Nishikawa) to respect her environment, warns of the adverse ecological impact. The political content is softly spoken, in a film of contemplative beauty, but there’s an undercurrent of unease.
