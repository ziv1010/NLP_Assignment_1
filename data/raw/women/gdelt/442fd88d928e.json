  "body_text": "BILL Bailey has pledged to return to Bradford's newest venue - the Loading Bay - for a comedy gig.\nThe comedian, musician, actor, artist and TV presenter was at the pop-up arts space to launch the Extraordinary Portraits exhibition, featuring artwork from the popular BBC One programme.\nPresented by Bill, the TV show highlights remarkable stories of ordinary people through their portraits painted by guest artists.\nThe exhibition at the Loading Bay - a new arts space in a former Marks & Spencer storage building which is running during Bradford's City of Culture year - pays tribute to six unsung heroes through a series of inspiring portraits and a sculpture featured in the current series of Extraordinary Portraits.\nThe sitters include a couple who have fostered almost 200 children; an army veteran whose walk around the UK coastline raised more than half a million pounds to support ex-servicemen and women; an influencer with Down’s Syndrome who is taking her campaign to change legislation to the government; a railway worker who saved 29 people a their lowest ebb; a lost football Lioness whose World Cup achievements were erased from history for half a century; and a young woman with incurable cancer who has set up a charity to help other people diagnosed at a young age.\nLaunching the exhibition, Bill Bailey said: \"Bradford is a place I've played many times and I've always had a good time here. This is a fantastic way to kick off this space - I will come back here and trial some of my new material!\"\nAdded Bill: \"Extraordinary Portraits democratizes portraiture in a way that hasn't been done before.\n\"Art should be for public consumption, not collected by rich people and squirrelled away. This venue, converted from an old loading bay, is a wonderful idea. It's a great way to show people what art can do - in Bradford's City of Culture year.\"\n* Extraordinary Portraits runs at the Loading Bay on Duke Street, Bradford, until April 6.\n* See Saturday's Telegraph & Argus (March 15) for a feature on the Extraordinary Portraits exhibition",
