Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nENGLAND STARTING XI\nHannah Hampton - 8\nShowed some signs of nervousness in the opening exchanges, but recovered well and displayed real confidence in all aspects of her game: dominating the box, claiming crosses with purpose and distributing well out from the back.\nCould have done very little to prevent Bonansea’s strike, which was hammered into the roof of the net with some force from inside the six-yard box.\nAged just 24 with her best years surely ahead, the Lionesses have undoubtedly found Mary Earps’ long-term successor.\nLucy Bronze - 7\nThe England stalwart – making her record-equaling 15th European Championship appearance – has grown into the tournament and proved a nuisance for the Italians with her direct and incessant running down the right flank.\nHowever, it was Bronze’s failed clearance that led to Italy’s first-half breakthrough, with the Chelsea full-back awkwardly directing the ball into the path of Bonansea.\nGuided a dangerous header across goal as England pushed for a late leveller, but the corner ultimately came to nothing, before Agyemang popped up to force extra-time.\nLeah Williamson - 6\nShook off an ankle problem to start the contest and the injury didn’t look to bother England’s captain.\nWasn’t directly at fault for Italy’s goal, but could perhaps have got tighter on Girelli to prevent the forward from prodding the vital touch into Bonansea’s path.\nTaken off for Agyemang just moments before the Arsenal forward’s stoppage-time strike.\nThe Lionesses’ inspirational skipper will be looking to wrap her ankle in cotton wool ahead of Sunday’s showpiece.\nEsme Morgan - 7\nComing in for Jess Carter, Morgan certainly did not look out of place alongside Williamson at the heart of Wiegman’s defence.\nProved to Wiegman that she can be trusted going forward, giving Wiegman a possible selection headache ahead of Sunday’s final.\nAged 24, the Washington Spirt defender displayed a level of maturity beyond her years and experience in Geneva.\nAlex Greenwood - 5\nGot far too tight on Cantore and was beaten too easily in the build-up to Bonansea’s goal to make it 1-0.\nBegan the first half by ballooning a wayward effort at Italy’s goal.\nWill be looking for a drastically improved performance if she is given the nod this weekend.\nKeira Walsh - 8\nTypically diligent in breaking up Italy’s attacks and mopping up at the base of England’s midfield, particularly throughout what was a frenetic first half.\nNo doubt frustrated with England’s lack of attacking threat in the opening 60 minutes, Walsh took it upon herself to take a speculative shot from range on the hour-mark, which had Giuliani scrambling across her goal.\nNever seemed to put a foot wrong. Wiegman’s trusty metronome was arguably England’s player of the match… that is until Agyemang came on and made herself an overnight hero.\nGeorgia Stanway - 5\nWhile Stanway will have had far worse games in her career, the Bayern Munich midfielder simply didn’t do enough to make her mark before coming off in the 77th minute.\nMay look back with some disappointment on her display and will be desperate to repay Wiegman’s trust with an improved showing in the final.\nElla Toone - 6\nToone was arguably the Lionesses’ standout player before the semi-final, chipping in with two goals across the campaign. But the forward was unable to make a meaningful impact this time around.\nLinked up nicely with Hemp throughout and found the Manchester City winger with an outstanding ball to the back post at the start of the second half, but the resulting header came to nothing.\nAnother big chance fell to Toone in the 70th minute. However, the Manchester United attacker snatched at her 20-yard effort, which failed to trouble Giuliani in the Italy goal.\nWill be hoping to rediscover her scoring boots before Sunday.\nLauren James - 6\nLooked to be getting her eye in with a strike at goal while the scoreline was still goalless in the 11th minute, after some fine play from Hemp down the left.\nCame closer with a more controlled – albeit tame – effort shortly before half-time, only to be denied by a flying Giuliani. Should perhaps have put her foot through it.\nAppeared a little leggy when attacking Italy’s box and was visibly struggling before coming off injured the half-time break, with Mead brought on in her place.\nAlessia Russo - 5\nShould maybe have hit the target with a shot on the turn in the 20th minute, which would have doubled her goalscoring tally at the tournament.\nFailed to get anything on the ball after a promising England attack in the 75th minute.\nHasn’t quite clicked for Russo this summer, but the Arsenal forward has the perfect opportunity to respond on the grandest stage this weekend.\nLauren Hemp - 7\nProvided a willing and dangerous outlet down the left flank, constantly looking to exploit the space in behind Italy’s Martina Lenzini.\nUndoubtedly England’s most potent weapon in a frustrating opening 45 minutes and came close to equalising with a whipped cross-cum-shot in the closing stages of the first half.\nShould have hit the target with a header from near point-blank range at the start of the second period as England searched for an all-important equaliser.\nSUBSTITUTES\nBeth Mead - 6\nReplaced James at the halfway stage and struggled to make an immediate impact.\nHowever, it was Mead’s attempted header that led to Agyemang’s last-gasp equaliser as England dug deep to force extra time in Geneva.\nChloe Kelly - 8\nHaving come on for Stanway, there were sighs of exasperation as Kelly fired a disappointing corner into the side netting as England sought a leveller deep into added time.\nCarried the ball with intent towards Italy’s goal in the 98th minute, but the Arsenal forward looked on in anguish after blazing her subsequent strike high and wide.\nFailed with her initial effort from the spot in extra-time, but was in the right place to tuck away the rebound to cue wild scenes amongst England’s travelling support in Switzerland.\nShe made the difference three years ago at Wembley and she did the same in Geneva. Start building a statue if Kelly manages to pull something out the bag again on Sunday evening.\nMichelle Agyemang - 9\nCometh the hour, cometh the Agyemang…\nAfter being sent on to make the difference in the 85th minute, the 19-year-old scored her third goal in four appearances to force added time in the most dramatic fashion.\nContinued to stretch Italy’s tiring defenders and came within inches of scoring one of the great Lionesses goals in the second period of extra time, only to be denied by the crossbar.\nWiegman could hardly have asked for anything more and the England boss had nothing but praise for the ‘special’ Arsenal youngster at her post-match press conference. A phenomenal performance.\nAggie Beever-Jones - 7\nWas not able to have the same influence as Agyemang, for obvious reasons, but was positive throughout and did her reputation no harm whatsoever.\nCan expect to play a similar role this weekend should England require some fresh legs off the bench.\nGrace Clinton & Jess Carter - 6\nBoth played a part after being introduced in extra-time, with England looking to preserve their advantage as the minutes ticked down in Switzerland.\nCarter – who had started all four of the Lionesses’ previous games – deserves enormous credit for showing the mental strength to be able to feature at all.\nJust days after the quarter-final win over Sweden, the central defender revealed that she had been subjected to vile racist abuse throughout the course of this summer’s tournament.\nMORE: Ian Wright sends warning to ‘lucky’ Lionesses after reaching Euro 2025 final\nMORE: When is the Women’s Euro 2025 final and who are England facing?\nMORE: Chloe Kelly scores last-minute winner to send Lionesses to Euro 2025 final",
