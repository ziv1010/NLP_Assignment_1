She was named the Woman of the Match in the Nigeria vs Morocco game.\nNigerian supporters' praises were echoed by President Tinubu in his video call with the triumphant team on Saturday night, July 26.\nThe Nigerian leader said:\n\"I watched the penalty kick; that is a very courageous exercise.\"\nOkoronkwo replied by saying, \"thank you, sir.\"\nThe video can be watched below in full:\nFootball analyst lauds Super Falcons coach\nMeanwhile, sportscaster and football analyst Ruth Odunayo reserved special praise for Super Falcons head coach Justine Madugu.\nAccording to Odunayo, Madugu \"showed us what the indigenous coaches can do if given the right support\".\nShe told Legit.ng:\n\"It was a great tournament (Yes, it is great when you win a record 10th title). Definitely, there is room for improvement in terms of team coordination and chemistry. However, a lot of credit must go to our very own, Justine Madugu, who showed us what the indigenous coaches can do if given the right support and a working environment.\"\nOdunayo added:\n\"And of course, the players. They did the unthinkable, especially in the finals against the host nation that had the full support of the fans, coming from two goals down in a final with the Moroccan fans pointing lasers in the faces of the players is quite commendable.\"\nRumours of Oshoala’s retirement swirl\nEarlier, Legit.ng noted claims alleging that Super Falcons' Asisat Oshoala announced her retirement from the national team.\nThe experienced former Barcelona star was said to have decided to hang up her boots amid Nigeria's quest for WAFCON glory.\nSource: Legit.ng",
