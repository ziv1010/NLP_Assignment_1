  "body_text": "Katie McCabe has spoken about the privilege of the captain's armband, as she led our side to another win in the Women's Super League - this time against Everton.\nMcCabe, who has stepped into the role of captain in the wake of injuries to both Kim Little and Leah Williamson, reflected on the resilience of our squad, the end of the season, and her own fantastic strike against the Toffees.\nHere is everything she had to say after the game:\non the strong performance against Everton...\nIt's always difficult coming away from home, especially against Everton. We've looked at how they play and they really love to play out from the back and they played some good football at times.\nSo it was about us organising our press early on and towards the end of the first half, we did that and got some goals from it.\non her long-range goal that doubled our advantage in the first half...\nI was actually annoyed because I didn't take a very good corner! Then I cut in and I heard Jenny Beattie shout 'Shoot!' so I was like \"Okay, I'll shoot.\" Luckily for me, it went in.\nI'm always happy to contribute and score goals, but the most important thing for me is always getting the three points for this team and we did that tonight.\non how we coped mentally after Lia Walti was stretchered off...\nLook, it hits us. I think that one hit us tonight obviously with the type of tackle it was and I think the referee got the decision right in sending the player off with the red card.\nWally is such a massive part of the squad and part of this team. She's influential in how she plays football. So we'll be making sure our fingers are crossed for her and we've got a fantastic medical team who will be looking after her. Yeah, we can only hope that she'll be okay.\non wearing the captain's armband...\nYeah, of course. I know it's only for a short period. I would much rather Kim and Leah Williamson be in the squad. But yeah, it's an honour to captain a club like Arsenal.\nI'm just doing the best I can in terms of my performances and my work rate. Yeah, it's an absolute privilege to captain the club and hopefully we can finish as high as possible this season and ends on a high. Yeah, those\non how to dig deep and finish this season strongly...\nWe've scored some goals [tonight] and we've got some confidence. It's going to be a massive game against Chelsea - we know that - and even Villa. Villa have had a fantastic season as well, so no better challenge.\nThis team have shown time and time again the character and the resilience we have in the team, even the young girls coming on as well, getting minutes and getting used to the quality of the WSL. So it's gonna be a big push but we'll be ready for it.\nTo hear more from Katie, click play on the video above.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
