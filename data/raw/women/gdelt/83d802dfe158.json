The primary goal of #SheBelongs is to shine a light of fresh perspective and hope on the struggles of refugee girls and their non-refugee counterparts and to facilitate and celebrate their journey to success however they define it, and wherever they resettle.\nEVERY GIRL | EVERY OPPORTUNITY | EVERYWHERE\nAbout Refugee Soccer\nRefugee Soccer was formally established in 2016 as a dedicated program under the 501(c)(3) entity known as Bridges To America, Inc. based in Salt Lake City, Utah. Bridges To America was started in 2005 originally to reunite African families separated by war, famine, and poverty. Soccer became a key part of Bridges’ efforts around 2013 as Founder and Executive Director, Adam Miles, started to involve his four children in the effort. His then 13-year-old daughter, Kylie, a goalkeeper, played a fundamental role in raising funds to deliver 100 soccer balls to kids living in rural villages in Ghana, West Africa through the Bridges’ program known as Save-A-Thon For Africa. This effort was the genesis of Refugee Soccer.\nToday, the mission of Refugee Soccer is to connect refugee and established communities through soccer around the world. Refugee Soccer was formed to create and support solutions that combat the tremendous losses of productivity, progress, and hope that result from the massive displacement occurring in the world at historically high levels. Soccer is our secret weapon.\nAdam Miles\nRefugee Soccer\n+1 801-931-1170\ninfo@shebelongs.org\nVisit us on social media:\nLinkedIn\nInstagram\nYouTube\nOfficial Movie Trailer\nDistribution channels: Culture, Society & Lifestyle, International Organizations, Movie Industry, Sports, Fitness & Recreation, World & Regional\nLegal Disclaimer:\nEIN Presswire provides this news content \"as is\" without warranty of any kind.
