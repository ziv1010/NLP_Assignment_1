ITV viewers were left raging at the lack of The Chase and Corrie on their schedules on Friday as ITV instead opted to air Rugby World Cup, with Argentina facing Samoa, before England's Lionesses took on Scotland in the women's football.\nTwitter user Brian fumed: \"Spend all day looking forward to #thechase and ITV show rugby instead wtf. Not even involving a home country. Wtf.\" Steve typed: \"Seriously @itv you show the same old, tired repeats of the chase and tipping point at prime time Saturday night as if they are the second coming for the nation to worship.\n\" And then. You cancel them, for a rugby match between 2 teams nobody here cares about. Make it make sense.\" Another said: \"Just seen the TV schedule for next week. On Friday 22nd, ITV will not be showing #TippingPoint or #TheChase due to the Rugby World Cup.\"\nChob said: \" @itv you have GOT to be joking right? It’s Friday night prime time and you are showing WOMENS FOOTBALL?!!! Are you insane? Where is #corrie? Do you really think the majority of viewers want this utter ****? I hope the advertisers are watching the fall off in viewers #WNL \"\nClint said: \"It was changed after tv magazines were printed. I'm sure the Coronation Street social media teams know when they are on tv. ITV are showing Rugby and Women's football on Friday so no room for Corrie\" Gita said: \"Absolutely gutted... No #Corrie nor #Emmerdale #omnibus not on freeview anymore. It's bad enough that @ITV change days and times to fit football... here's an idea. Put the footy on the Internet channels ~ I don't have or want them. Too expensive! and nothing interesting to an oap.\"\n\"Ffs no #coronationstreet no #Chase,\" another agreed, writing: \"Since when is @ITV a sports channel? No wonder people watch Netflix.\"",
