All information on the spring game can be found here at www.goheels.com.\nBaseball – The Diamond Heels kick off a nine-game homestand on Tuesday night at 6 PM welcoming Queens (N.C.)

Then on Saturday either head over to Dorrance Field for a top-five women’s lacrosse game between Syracuse and Carolina or back to The Bosh for game three of the Diamond Heels vs Hurricanes at noon.
