  "body_text": "Emma Hayes and the Chelsea Women have not taken a break since raising another piece of silverware, making moves in order to continue this streak at the top of domestic football.\nIn the span of just a week, the Chelsea Women have confirmed the return of three of their players. The latest, the Norwegian legend herself Maren Mjelde who put pen to paper on a 12-month renewal of her contract this past weekend. Mjelde joins a slew of players who contracts will expire at the end of next season including Sam Kerr, Aniek Nouwen, and goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger.\nThe 33-year-old Mjelde, while she only competed in 13 matches across both the Women’s Super League and UEFA Women’s Champions League was a critical asset down the stretch as the Blues secured another double. Since coming to the club before the Spring Series in 2017, Mjelde has defined the word clutch.\nSome of the biggest goals in the history of CFCW belong to the Norwegian international including the penalty against Lyon in the second leg back in March which sealed the deal on the west London outfit’s trip to the Champions League semifinal. That was not even her first goal that sent Hayes’ side to the semifinals of the top competition in European football. Who knows how much she will play in what looks to be her final campaign at the club, but when it matters the most, this club knows it can always rely on Mjelde for just about anything.",
