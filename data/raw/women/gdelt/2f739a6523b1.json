So we just made sure that situations couldn’t occur. We protected the players.”\nA Fulham FC spokesperson said: “We are deeply troubled and concerned to learn of the disturbing reports following yesterday’s documentary. We have sincere empathy for the women who have shared their experiences.\n“We are in the process of establishing whether anyone at the club is or has been affected. Should any person wish to share information or experiences relating to these allegations, we encourage them to contact the club at safeguarding@fulhamfc.com or the police.”\nA press conference on Friday which set out the claims made against the late Harrods’ owner heard there was a “systematic failure of corporate responsibility”.\nBarrister Dean Armstrong KC told reporters: “And that systematic failure is on the shoulders of Harrods.”\nThe legal team also represents women who were employed by the Paris Ritz and investigations were ongoing into “all entities that he had involvement in”, including Fulham Football Club.\nThe legal team featured in a BBC documentary called Al-Fayed: Predator At Harrods, where more than 20 female former employees spoke to the broadcaster as part of a special investigation, coming forward with allegations of assault and physical violence at properties in London and Paris.\nSources within Harrods have said the business has accepted vicarious liability for the conduct of Mr Al Fayed for the purpose of settling claims of alleged victims brought to its attention since 2023, reaching settlements with the vast majority.\nThe PA news agency understands Harrods has received new inquiries since the airing of the BBC documentary.\nMr Armstrong said the legal team has been retained by 37 of Mr Al Fayed’s accusers and is “in the process of being retained by many more”.\nAlso at the press conference was an alleged victim of Mr Al Fayed, who went by the name of Natacha, and said the “fear instilled left me paralysed”.\nShe said: “These private meetings turned into more of a forced kiss, his hands gripping your face to his lips or pulling you down on his lap, where his hands were free to explore any part of your body that he wished.\n“These incidents lasted seconds, but the fear instilled left me paralysed.\n“Al Fayed brushed off these moments like they had never happened, but I was always reminded not to mention them to anyone.”\nMr Al Fayed had previously been accused of sexually assaulting and groping multiple women, but a previous police investigation did not lead to any charges.\nHarrods previously said it was “utterly appalled” by the allegations of abuse and said it had set up a page on its website inviting former employees to come forward if they have allegations.\nMr Al Fayed bought Fulham in 1997 and under his ownership they rose to the top half of the Premier League in the early 2000s, peaking in qualification for the Europa League.\nHe sold the team in 2013.\n-\nMan in 40s confirmed dead after police called to Starbucks car park\n1 -\nThree taken to hospital after crash on main road\n2 - 1\nFuture of fashion retailer in Kent in doubt as luxury clothing brand enters administration\n3 - 17\nBeloved family pet put down despite heroic actions of bus driver who stopped dog attack\n4 - 6\nThe underpass that’s flooded so often it’s even got its own Facebook page\n5",
