  "body_text": "The man accused of driving a car into crowd of football fans during Liverpool FC's title victory parade \"used his vehicle as a weapon\", a court has heard.\nPaul Doyle, 53, is said to have ploughed his grey Ford Galaxy into pedestrians on Monday, leaving 79 people injured, including four children as fans gathered to celebrate the Reds 20th league championship.\nAshen-faced Doyle appeared tearful as he entered the courtroom at Liverpool Magistrates' Court and looked around at the dozens of reporters packed into the public gallery. He had no family or friends in court.\nHe then sat with his head bowed in the dock as he listened to proceedings, wearing a black suit, white shirt and grey tie and sporting short dark hair.\nHe spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth during the brief hearing.\nHe was not asked to indicate a plea and will appear before Liverpool Crown Court later on Friday.\nDoyle shook his head in the dock as prosecutor Philip Astbury told the judge he drove \"deliberately at the crowd\" and \"used his vehicle as a weapon\".\nDoyle is charged seven offences in total: which are two counts of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, two counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, two counts of attempted grievous bodily harm with intent and one count of dangerous driving.\nThe charges relate to a total of six victims: two women, two women and two boys. Police previously said the youngest victim was nine and the oldest 78. One child was the alleged victim of wounding, the other was the alleged victim of attempted GBH.\nDistrict Judge Paul Healey briefly paused the hearing to consider legal discussions concerning reporting restrictions and later granted the prosecutions request to impose restrictions on naming the victims.\nHe told Doyle: \"Charges two through to seven are indictable only charges. Charge number one will be sent as a linked allegation. I send you to Liverpool Crown Court. There will be a hearing today before the Recorder of Liverpool, his Honour Judge Menary KC. That won’t be before 12.30 today I understand.”\nAlmost a million fans had lined the streets to mark Liverpool's championship victory when a Ford Galaxy ploughed into those gathered in Water Street. It was the first time since 1990 that fans could celebrate a title win with a parade after their 2020 success came amid Covid pandemic restrictions.\nDoyle was initially arrested on suspicion of driving while unfit through drugs. Police said he has not been charged with that offence but the investigation \"remains at an early stage\". GBH carries a maximum sentence of life in jail.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the charges against Doyle, who is reportedly an ex-Royal Marine, would be kept “under review as the investigation progresses”.\nIn a statement issued to reporters on Thursday, chief crown prosecutor for CPS Mersey-Cheshire, Sarah Hammond, said: “The investigation is at an early stage. Prosecutors and police are continuing to work at pace to review a huge volume of evidence.\n“This includes multiple pieces of video footage and numerous witness statements. It is important to ensure every victim gets the justice they deserve.”\nAt the press conference, Assistant Chief Constable of Merseyside Police Jenny Sims added: “I fully understand how this incident has left us all shocked and saddened, and I know many will continue to have concerns and questions.\n“Our detectives are working tirelessly, with diligence and professionalism, to seek the answer to all of those questions. When we are able to, we will provide further information.”\nMs Sims said seven people remain in hospital. Police previously said they believed the car that struck pedestrians was able to follow an ambulance crew attending to someone suffering a heart attack after a roadblock was temporarily lifted.\nFor the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletter by clicking here.",
