  "body_text": "After weeks of buildup, Emma Hayes and the Chelsea Women have confirmed the arrival of French international Ashley Lawrence from Paris Saint-Germain.\nWhile Mauricio Pochettino and the men’s team continue to send players packing, the women cannot stop adding senior-level talent. After an extended wait, the Canadian international wing back Ashley Lawrence has finally signed a three-year deal with the Chelsea Women. Since late May, the former PSG defender had been rumored to have joined the west Londoners. It could not be official until her contract with the French side came to a close. 23 days following her announcement that her six and a half year career in the French capital was over, Lawrence was officially introduced publicly by Hayes’ side. The 28-year-old went straight from the collegiate game in the United States to European football, just like Catarina Macario, and Jessie Fleming.\nThe west London outfit now has a strong Canadian contingent as the former West Virginia Mountaineer teams up with her Canadian teammates Fleming and Kadeisha Buchanan. Her transition into the team should be made much easier given she has been playing with two regulars in Hayes’ side for years on the international stage. Canada will be one of three teams including Germany with three or more west Londoners on its World Cup squad for this summer’s tournament.",
