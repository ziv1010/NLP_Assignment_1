  "body_text": "Deric Augustine has been upgraded to a series regular in ABC's The Rookie. It's fantastic news as he's proven to be the best and most interesting new character introduced in Season 7. Augustine's promotion to series regular means The Rookie fans will continue watching Miles Penn's further growth and development in the upcoming eighth season. Miles debuted early in Season 7 as a transfer from Houston, Texas. Before joining the L.A.P.D.'s rookie program, he worked for two years in the Sugar Land Police Department in Texas. Penn brings a different type of energy and style to the cast, thanks to his southern Texas charm, which Augustine captures wonderfully well. It's time to unpack why keeping Officer Penn on board makes The Rookie a much better series, overall.\nMiles Penn Brings Something Different to 'The Rookie'\nBefore switching over to law enforcement, Penn had a promising career in sports, winning a college football championship. However, an injury ended his football prospects, and he pivoted to law enforcement. Additionally, his first appearance in the episode \"The Shot\" revealed that Penn was still living out of his car after moving to L.A. These characteristics make Penn a much more relatable and grounded character, despite his initial braggadocious swagger.\nPenn experienced some bumps in the road at first. Due to his background as a football player and Texan, he went through a difficult adjustment period to the pace and demands of the L.A.P.D.'s Mid-Wilshire Division, including undergoing rigorous oversight from his strict, yet fair, training officer, Tim Bradford (Eric Winter). Despite a few obstacles, Officer Penn endures his training, and he eventually earns Bradford's respect, an incredibly rare feat in the show's history. His moment with Diana (Virginia Knull), the woman who runs the battered women's shelter in Season 7, Episode 7, \"The Mickey,\" features a superb moment where Penn offers his services as a volunteer security guard for the shelter when off-duty. It illustrates Penn's compassion for others and his willingness to help his new community.\n'The Rookie' Showrunner on the \"Real Effects\" of the Chenford Breakups and the Return of Aaron Thorsen\nAlexi Hawley also discusses the villains we'll see again at the end of the season and what it was like working with Ryan Bergara and Shane Madej.\nMiles Penn Comes Full Circle in 'Three Billboards'\nDespite Officer Penn's ups and downs during his probationary training period in The Rookie, the character truly comes full circle in Season 7, Episode 13, \"Three Billboards.\" During the episode, Penn is confronted with a glimpse of the life he once pursued in pro football through his former college teammate, AJ Knox (Justin Cornwell). It even gets to the point where Knox is willing to bring Penn on as his new head of security, offering him a huge payday, plus access to Knox's luxurious, multi-million-dollar life. This provides a great source of conflict for Penn, but he ultimately decides to continue pursuing his career in the L.A.P.D.\nThe episode provides an exceptional moment of introspection for Penn, but Bradford's pep talk provides a resounding argument. If Penn had accepted Knox's offer, he would have ended up living vicariously through his old teammate. Penn acting as head of security for Knox would merely provide a means for Penn to leech off someone else's fame and fortune. Ultimately, Penn realizes that while the cash and prizes might come off as fun and exciting at first, he would eventually feel miserable and trapped. Seeing Penn turn down a life of certain fortune for a career in law enforcement represents a profound moment for the character. Now, Penn's resolve is strengthened, and he is all in for his career as a police officer. The young man has finally found his true calling, and his maturing as a rookie police officer has been wonderful to watch unfold in Season 7.\nOfficer Penn Is Bringing Progressive Changes to the LAPD\nThe recent Season 7 Episode, \"Mad About Murder,\" also features a great arc for Officer Penn, as he proactively seeks to update the L.A.P.D.'s training videos. Recently, Detective Harper (Mekia Cox) began recruiting a group of officers of the Mid-Wilshire Division to spearhead progressive changes and reform within the department. Harper unfortunately meets a roadblock when officers fail to show up to her first major event on the project. Penn is the one who steps up in this case, pointing out how the L.A.P.D.'s videos are antiquated and not up to date with the latest police procedures. Lt. Grey (Richard T. Jones), Detective Harper, and Sgt. Bradford quickly agree that Penn should lead the project. Penn performs the job well, even executing some comedically well-timed research with the legendary Quigley Smitty (Brent Huff).\nPenn's involvement in the project and support for Harper's efforts demonstrate that Penn will not be a passive bystander. Even though Penn recently strengthened his resolve to continue in his career in law enforcement, he recognizes that the L.A.P.D. requires progressive changes. The recent subplot allows Penn to be part of the change that will have a positive impact on policing and enhance his role in the overall recurring narrative. Storylines such as this bode well for Penn's future in The Rookie.\nMiles Penn Is the Best New Character of Season 7\nPenn's growth and evolution throughout his training period make him the best new addition to the cast in Season 7. His Texan energy and charm provide a nice dichotomy and fresh diversity within the cast. Additionally, Penn proves his compassionate nature in his profession, overcomes challenges, and finds a rewarding relationship with Bradford as his mentor. It's rare to see Bradford admit to another officer that they are a talented and a good cop, and the moment is hugely motivating for Penn as a character. There's great comfort in knowing that Augustine, as Officer Miles Penn, is a series regular now, and his growth will continue in Season 8! The character started an epic journey in Season 7, and it's good to know that the character's run in the series will continue.\nNew episodes of The Rookie air on Tuesdays on ABC and stream the next day on Hulu in the U.S.\n- Release Date\n- October 16, 2018\n- Network\n- ABC\n- Showrunner\n- Alexi Hawley\n- Directors\n- Tori Garrett, Chi-Yoon Chung, Michael Goi, Sylvain White, Lisa Demaine, Lanre Olabisi, Bill Johnson, David McWhirter, Liz Friedlander, Daniel Willis, Toa Fraser, Anne Renton, Jon Huertas, Cherie Nowlan, TK Shom, Rob Seidenglanz, Valerie Weiss, Barbara Brown, Charissa Sanjarernsuithikul, SJ Main Muñoz, Nelson McCormick, Marcus Stokes, Adam Davidson, Anna Mastro\n- Writers\n- Corey Miller, Bill Rinier, Zoe Cheng, Mary Trahan, Ally Seibert, Liz Alper, Nick Hurwitz, Racheal Seymour, Madeleine Coghlan, David Radcliff\nCast\n-\nJohn Nolan\n-\nMelissa O'NeilLucy Chen\n- Creator(s)\n- Alexi Hawley",
