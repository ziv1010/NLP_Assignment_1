  "body_text": "West Alabama Thursday Briefing\nIt is Thursday December 7, 2023. This date in 1941 was labeled the \"Day of Infamy\" by President Franklin D. Roosevelt after aircraft of the Imperial Japanese navy bombed, torpedoed and strafed Pearl Harbor, HI to bring the United States into World War II.\nThe aging pool of Pearl Harbor survivors has been rapidly shrinking. There are none left from the State of Alabama.\nThere is now just one crew member of the USS Arizona still living, 102-year-old Lou Conter of California. More than 1,100 sailors and Marines from the Arizona were killed and more than 900 are entombed inside. One of the names on the memorial wall above the hull of the Arizona is a relative that the attack kept me from ever knowing. But standing in front of that wall, seeing his name, brought home the humanity of that day. It wasn't just a historic event, it was a family tragedy, like so many families suffered from that day.\nSo why is it still important to \"Remember Pearl Harbor\"? Despite the passage of 82 years, Pearl Harbor remains a poignant symbol of freedom and sacrifice. In the space of a few hours, America became the world’s foremost defender of liberty. It reminds us that we must always be willing to fight for our freedom and for that of others.\nThe attack taught us we must always be vigilant and prepared. The world is small today, what happens on the other side of the world can impact us in our own country quickly. That is why we must not be isolationists but rather be proactive. For if one country loses its freedom due to aggressive tyranny, other countries cannot be far behind, including our own.\nA moment of silence will be held at 7:55 a.m. (Hawaii Standard Time), the same time the attack began on Dec. 7, 1941.\n----\nToday will be another sunny day but cloudy skies and possible severe weather is just ahead. A Marginal (1 in 5) Risk for strong to severe thunderstorms has been issued for Saturday across West Alabama.\nShowers will begin Friday night and continue into Saturday afternoon. The bulk of the precipitation will be Saturday afternoon according to the National Weather Service in Birmingham.\nThe most likely scenario will be a broken line of storms with a few damaging wind gusts and a possibility for a tornado or two across the area.\nThe good news is 1 to 3 inches of rainfall will be beneficial to further ending drought conditions.\nThe Forecast:\nToday: Sunny, with a high near 60. South wind around 5 mph.\nTonight: Partly cloudy, with a low around 39. South wind around 5 mph.\nFriday: Partly sunny, with a high near 67.

South wind around 10 mph, with gusts as high as 20 mph.\nSaturday: A chance of showers, then showers likely and possibly a thunderstorm after noon. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 74. South wind 10 to 15 mph. Chance of precipitation is 60%.\nSaturday Night: Showers and possibly a thunderstorm. Low around 49.

The officer is on administrative leave.\nThe family of former New Orleans Saints player Glenn Foster, Jr. has filed a federal lawsuit against the Pickens County Sheriff’s Office and the county jail. They claim Foster's 2021 death resulted from mistreatment while incarcerated on reckless endangerment and resisting arrest charges by Reform Police.\nNationally known attorney Ben Crump is representing the family and claims Foster was beaten before being transported to Northport Medical Center where he later died.\nA defamation lawsuit filed against the New York Times by Alabama Basketball walk-on Kai Spears will precede. U-S District Court Judge Scott Coogler denied a dismissal motion by the Times.
