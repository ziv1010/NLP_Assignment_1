  "body_text": "Welcome to our pick of last week’s news from Fethiye and around Turkey.\nCurated from various news sources.\n🧿 LOCAL NEWS\nFethiye Celebrates Culinary and Cultural Unity with 3rd International Gastronomy, Culture and Friendship Festival\nFethiye once again brought together cultures and flavours with the successful hosting of the 3rd International Gastronomy, Culture and Friendship Festival. Despite the rain, the event opened with a warm and welcoming ceremony at the Özer Olgun Cultural Center, setting the tone for a festival that celebrated cross-cultural connections between Turkey and Greece.\nChefs from both countries came together to share culinary traditions, while the festival offered a wide array of events, including folk dances, concerts, talks, and exhibitions of traditional handicrafts.\n“It Started with an Idea, Now a Tradition”\nAcclaimed chef Maria Ekmekçioğlu, who played a central role in founding the event, spoke at the opening and reflected on the festival’s journey.\n“Thank you very much for honouring our festival. Our friends from Greece were also welcome. In the first year, this event started as just an idea, and our Fethiye Mayor embraced it,” she said. “Çiğdem Hanım gave great support, and we organised the first festival in just 15–20 days. We took the first step with journalists and chefs from Greece. The second year came more easily, and now we’ve held the third. I hope this festival continues for many years. It has now become a tradition for this city.”\nA Festival Built on Women’s Efforts\nÇiğdem Karaca, President of the Fethiye Likya Women’s Development Cooperative, highlighted the key role women played in the festival’s development.\n“We were happy to organise our third festival,” she said. “We founded our cooperative five years ago and started this journey with great confidence. Women are the backbone of every field. We worked without profit. We even established ties in Scotland and opened a company there. We achieved something difficult, and today we’ve taken our products to an international level. As the women of Fethiye, we made a great contribution to this festival.”\n“We Met for Culture, Tourism and Peace in Fethiye”\nFethiye Mayor Alim Karaca underlined the broader impact of the event on the city’s image and international ties.\n“We were proud to host this beautiful festival once again in Fethiye, where the Aegean and Mediterranean meet and happy people live,” he said. “Our goal was to foster friendship, peace, culture and tourism. Thanks to events like this, we’ve made Fethiye known in other countries and had the chance to promote our city.”\nAs part of the festival, Greek chefs, vocal artists, and members of the press visited Fethiye, touring the town and engaging in cultural exchanges.\nThe public opening ceremony took place at 19:00 in Beşkaza Square, followed by a lively concert by Greek musicians. The event drew enthusiastic crowds and marked another successful step in Fethiye’s growing tradition of cultural diplomacy through gastronomy.\nSource: Fethiye TV\nFethiye Captivates National Audience in Live TV Broadcast\nFethiye was thrust into the national spotlight as it hosted a live broadcast by a major national television channel, showcasing the town’s vibrant identity far beyond its reputation as a tourist destination. The special programme, aired live from Beşkaza Square, offered viewers across Turkey a rich and colourful portrait of Fethiye’s gastronomy, culture, and local enterprise.\nThe programme focused on Fethiye’s multi-layered character, presenting it as a thriving community that seamlessly blends natural beauty, cultural heritage, and grassroots production. Far more than just a holiday hotspot, the town was introduced as a living cultural landscape—home to dynamic cooperatives, traditional crafts, historical richness, and a strong commitment to sustainable local development.\nA Feast for the Senses—and the Screen\nSet against the stunning backdrop of where the Aegean and Mediterranean seas meet, the live broadcast turned Fethiye into a visual spectacle. Panoramic shots of turquoise waters, lush mountains, ancient ruins, and the vibrant energy of the town’s people created a feast for the eyes.\nOne of the most talked-about moments came during a sirtaki performance, which captured the joyful spirit of the ongoing International Gastronomy, Culture and Friendship Festival. The dance, performed by men and women in unison, enchanted viewers with its rhythmic beauty and visual harmony. The male dancers’ traditional hats and the women’s matching hairstyles and makeup quickly became trending topics on social media, reflecting the performance’s cultural impact.\nFethiye Mayor Alim Karaca, who watched the performance live in the square, remarked on the growing importance of such events in promoting the city’s diverse identity.\nGastronomy Beyond the Plate\nThe broadcast didn’t just focus on the sights—it delved deep into the flavours of Fethiye. Recipes by local chefs, many of whom were women supported by cooperatives, were prepared live and celebrated for their traditional roots and regional authenticity.\nThe show also spotlighted handcrafted goods produced by local cooperatives and development initiatives. These segments highlighted the role of women entrepreneurs and underlined Fethiye’s commitment to socially conscious and sustainable growth. In doing so, the programme illustrated how gastronomy in Fethiye is not only a culinary treasure, but also a key pillar of its social and economic fabric.\nA Living Heritage on Display\nBeyond food and performance, the cultural depth of Fethiye was brought vividly to life. Viewers were taken on a journey from the ancient Lycian cities to the stone-paved alleys of Kayaköy, and from the vivid blues of Ölüdeniz to paragliders soaring above Babadağ. These features painted a picture of a town deeply rooted in history while remaining open to the world.\nThe programme further demonstrated how international influences, such as the collaboration between Turkish and Greek chefs during the festival, coexist with local traditions, turning Fethiye into a compelling destination for both domestic and international visitors.\nA City That Speaks for Itself\nWith the broadcast stage transformed into a cultural platform, Fethiye found a powerful voice. The smells of traditional dishes, the energy of the crowd, and the stories of resilience and creativity combined to offer an immersive experience that went beyond typical tourism promotion.\nThanks to this special live broadcast, Fethiye was not just shown—it was felt, lived and remembered. The town emerged not only as a place to visit, but as a place to understand, rooted in community and alive with meaning.\nSource: Gerçek Fethiye\nMuğla Metropolitan Municipality Launches Fethiye–Rhodes Ferry Service\nMuğla Metropolitan Municipality has officially launched a new international sea route connecting Fethiye to Rhodes, marking a significant development in regional transportation and tourism. Operated in cooperation with the İDO General Directorate, the İDO Marmara ferry departed from Fethiye Pier for its maiden voyage to the Greek island with 35 passengers on board.\nThe launch ceremony was attended by key figures from both the municipality and İDO, including Muğla Metropolitan Municipality Transportation Department Head Süleyman Özdemir, MUTTAŞ Board Chairman Uğur İlhami Özden, MUTTAŞ General Manager Sedat Bayrak, İDO General Manager Dr. Murat Orhan, and other officials.

The round-trip fare has been set at 85 Euros, and officials noted that frequencies may be adjusted depending on passenger demand. A new pricing regulation is also being considered for public sector employees.\nSpeaking at the event, Süleyman Özdemir highlighted the broader vision behind the initiative:\n“We have started the first fruit of our cooperation with İDO with the Fethiye–Rhodes trip. Our Metropolitan Municipality Mayor Ahmet Aras places great importance on utilising our seas. These voyages are part of that vision. Frequency may increase or decrease based on demand, and we are also working on a public employee tariff.”\nİDO General Manager Dr. Murat Orhan expressed hope that the ferry service would bring positive momentum to regional tourism, while Av. Ali Özgür Kullukçu, spokesperson for the Fethiye Municipality Council Group and Muğla Metropolitan Municipality Council Member, emphasised the potential for cross-cultural ties:\n“The first Rhodes trip, launched through the cooperation of Fethiye and the Metropolitan Municipality, will not only create competition on this route but will also contribute to Turkish–Greek friendship.”\nThe new ferry line represents a promising step forward for international tourism, economic development, and regional cooperation in the Aegean. The connection between Fethiye and Rhodes, now made more accessible, is expected to enhance travel experiences for locals and visitors alike while fostering greater cultural exchange between Turkey and Greece.\nSource: Fethiye TV\nProject Tender for New Fethiye State Hospital Set for June 23\nIn a significant development for the region’s healthcare services, AK Party Muğla Deputies Yakup Otgöz and Kadem Mete announced that the project tender for the new state hospital in Fethiye will take place on June 23, 2025.\nIn a joint written statement, the deputies emphasised the importance of the new hospital project, highlighting it as a major step toward enhancing Fethiye’s health infrastructure and improving the quality of services offered to the public.\n“According to the information we received from our Ministry of Health, the project implementation tender of our state hospital, which is of great importance to our fellow citizens of Fethiye, will be held on June 23, 2025,” the statement read.\nThe new facility is planned to have a capacity of 300 beds, aiming to relieve pressure on existing health institutions and meet the growing medical needs of the district’s population.\n“With this hospital, we aim to significantly develop the health service infrastructure of our district.

Şahika Ercümen, a decorated free diver and UNDP Turkey’s “Advocate for Life Below Water,” recently undertook an awareness dive in Southern Marmara, accompanied by marine scientist Professor Mustafa Sarı and diving instructor Osman Benli. They observed mucilage layers extending up to three metres deep, signalling its growing vertical spread.\nErcümen described the underwater conditions as suffocating, with mucilage threatening marine ecosystems on an existential level. Ultra-marathon swimmer Bengisu Avcı, who encountered mucilage during training in Çanakkale, echoed these concerns, noting lifeless seascapes and visibly tainted water. She warned the threat is no longer remote but imminent.\nExperts warn that untreated wastewater from millions of residents around the Marmara Sea is fuelling the crisis, which is feared to be escalating to levels seen during the 2021 environmental disaster. Calls are growing for urgent government action and greater public awareness to protect the region’s fragile marine environment.\nSource: https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/record-holding-divers-call-for-urgent-action-in-marmara-sea-209787\nSevere April Frost Causes Over 21 Billion Lira in Crop Losses Across Turkey\nA devastating agricultural frost in April has caused an estimated 21 billion Turkish Liras ($537.2 million) in crop damage across Turkey, officials revealed to a parliamentary committee this week. The unusually harsh cold snap, lasting from April 10 to 12, brought severe temperature drops that damaged a wide range of crops.\nAmong the worst affected were grapes, which suffered losses of 11 billion liras ($281.2 million). Apricots, hazelnuts, apples, nectarines, peaches, cherries, plums, and walnuts were also heavily impacted.\nSpeaking to the parliamentary agricultural frost research committee, Bekir Engürülü, General Manager of the Agricultural Insurance Pool (TARSİM), reported that 1.1 billion liras ($28.1 million) in insurance compensation has already been paid out, with the remaining claims under evaluation.\nIn response to criticism over high frost insurance premiums, Engürülü defended the current pricing model. He explained that in high-risk areas, such as apricot-growing regions, claims are made on 81 out of every 100 policies. “Farmers often insure only their most vulnerable plots, which increases overall risk and therefore premium costs,” he said.\nEngürülü added that the government is considering regulations that would require farmers to insure all plots of the same crop within a given district, in an effort to better distribute risk and manage premium levels.\nSource: https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/april-frost-cause-21-bln-liras-in-damage-officials-say-209742\n🧿 SPORT\nFethiyespor\nThank you to Brian Lloyd for the Fethiyespor update.\nFethiyespor U13 Crowned Champions of Muğla\nFethiyespor’s U13 team secured the Muğla championship title with a 1-0 victory over Muğlaspor in the final match held in Muğla.\nThe young squad delivered a determined and disciplined performance to claim the trophy, showcasing the strength of the club’s youth development.
