  "body_text": "Chelsea vs Brighton - WSL preview: TV channel, live stream, team news & prediction\nChelsea find themselves needing to quickly put Sunday's disappointing Conti Cup final defeat behind them as the games now come thick and fast in an extraordinarily busy March.\nThis week's WSL clash with Brighton, postponed a few days because of Sunday's final, is the second of seven games across four different competitions the Blues will play this month.\nHaving taken points off Chelsea in each of the last three WSL seasons - including a win at Kingsmeadow in February 2021, Brighton could be considered a bogey side.\nBut the Seagulls have had plenty of upheaval this week, bidding farewell to manager Jens Scheuer after little more than two months in the job. Amy Merricks, who was in charge throughout November and December after Hope Powell left the club, is the interim boss again.\nWhere to watch Chelsea vs Brighton on TV/live stream\nWhen is kick off? Wednesday 8 March, 19:30 (GMT)\nWhere is the match being played? Kingsmeadow\nTV channel/live stream? Sky Sports Main Event/Football (UK), Paramount+ (US), FA Player (International)\nWhat time does TV coverage in the UK start? 19:00 (GMT)\nReferee? Abigail Byrne\nChelsea team news\nChelsea remain without Pernille Harder, while Fran Kirby is also a doubt after having a PRP injection last week. Emma Hayes said at the time it can take around a week to subsequently settle down.\nThe Blues announced an agreement to sign Belgian goalkeeper Nicky Evrard this week but she won't actually join the club until the summer.\nBrighton team news\nGoalkeeper Megan Walsh has put in some inspired performances against Chelsea in the past and could replace Australian vetern Lydia Williams.\nThe return of Merricks to the helm could see a 4-4-2 system brought back, with Scheuer havig switched to 4-2-3-1 in his last league game in charge last month.\nChelsea vs Brighton score prediction\nWhether a rotated side or not, Hayes will expect a response from Chelsea after speaking about complacency in the Conti Cup final performance against Arsenal.\nThere will be no favours from Brighton given their record in this fixture - Merricks took four points from three WSL games in her previous stint in charge - and there is a huge amount at stake given that this is one of two games in hand on Manchester United, who extended their lead at the top of the table to four points on Sunday, before they then face each other this coming weekend.\nVictory here would put Chelsea back within a point of United before the Red Devils arrive at Kingsmeadow on Sunday, still with an additional game in hand to play after, meaning the title race initiative would be very much with the reigning champions. But failure to get the job done against Brighton and only a big win on Sunday would given them a chance of going back top then.",
