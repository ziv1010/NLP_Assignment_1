  "body_text": "If you hadn’t figured it out by the jughandle alone, I have not lived in New Jersey for a while. In fact, I’ve spent 10 times the amount of nights on other continents as I have in the Garden State the last decade. So despite my parents being Rutgers athletes who spent their entire lives within an hour drive of the Rutgers campus, I feel like I have enough perspective on the inside and the outside to articulate why YOU should or should not hate Rutgers.\nB1G 2024: To Hate or Not to Hate: Rutgers Edition\nYou talkin’ to me?\nAnd if you aren’t thrilled with this idea, that’s what the polls and comments sections are for.\nTo hate: Rutgers was deserving to join the Big Ten? Really?\nWhen Rutgers accepted the invitation to join the Big Ten conference in 2012, they had ZERO Big East titles in football, the sport that drives the bus. The Scarlet Knights did win a share of the 2012 title afterward, but all they had to do was win one of their final two games to reach the BCS and instead completely fell short. Even in their magical 2006 season, RU lost to a backup QB in triple overtime at West Virginia in the season finale, missing out on the BCS and a conference title. In 22 seasons of Big East play, Rutgers was .500 or better in conference games just six times.\nIn basketball, Rutgers hadn’t been to the men’s NCAA Tournament since 1991, before they joined the Big East. At least the Women’s Basketball team had made some noise on the national circuit, regularly making deep runs in March Madness and falling in the National Final to an all-time great player in Candace Parker and an all-time great coach in Pat Summitt.\nOutside the revenue-producing sports, the wrestling team wasn’t yet what it would become, men’s soccer and baseball were trending down from previous national prominence, and volleyball was already struggling. Only the women’s soccer team was a legitimate powerhouse. No other sports, outside of maybe crew (which was nearly cut as an athletic program), had traditions that looked appropriate for Big Ten annals.\nDon’t get me wrong, I am EXTREMELY overjoyed that it happened and am not asking for a mulligan. However, the fact that Rutgers struggled in almost every sport upon its inclusion in the Big Ten came as no surprise. On the other hand ...\nRU in VA: I feel like Rutgers’ biggest export is college graduates, just like the state of New Jersey’s biggest export is college students to non-state schools. Luckily, I have two degrees from Maryland - so I’m still in the bucket.\nBut in all honestly, we need to change how we think about the landscape. It’s only haves and have-nots. Entire conferences don’t matter and how they are aligned doesn’t matter. Of the new B1G, who is a have? Michigan, OSU, Penn State, USC, Oregon, Nebraska? Schools that can function with a positive $$ athletic department AND have strong donor NIL.\nI dunno. But Rutgers, by that metric, is a have not. There is no magic T. Boone Pickens or some seismic event that will make the state magically send their hard earned hedge fund dollars to the state university. But I also maybe miss the regional rivalries we DID have, like some other B1G schools lament about (Pitt, WVU, Princeton, Syracuse, BC, etc.). Maybe I’m also a whiny baby BECAUSE THE SCARLET KNIGHT IS HERE TO STAY!\nNot to hate: Academics\nUnlike the athletics front, Rutgers has been a top academic institution since its 1766 founding as Queen’s College in the American Colonies. The University currently hovers in the high 30s or low 40s according to US News and World Report, which places them around 15th among public schools. Number one in the state, one that still somehow remains the 11th most populous in the country. For some self-promotion, you can see the full list here. If 6th in Digital Librarianship doesn’t strike your fancy, they finish in the 30s for basically every math/science, and do top the leaderboard in both Women’s and African American history. They better in the latter, ever hear of Paul Robeson? Dude was a legend off the field and deemed the GOAT of the “End” position in the first 50 years of amateur pigskin.\nThough the professors and administrators don’t seem to get it, you don’t even need a full blown Flutie effect to have a name known nationally. In Florida for example, the average person on the street thinks the University of Chicago is a community college, but they have heard of Rutgers and know it is decent school that is probably in the Ivy League or maybe Patriot or like Notre Dame or something.\nSpeaking of Ivy League douches ...\nTo hate: Lack of rivals\nNestled between traditional athletic powerhouses such as Princeton and Columbia, it’s not a surprise that finding any sort of multi-sport rival has historically proven difficult in Piscataway. Though there exists some controversy as to whether or not Rutgers was invited to the Ivy League and declined thus allowing Cornell and Brown to be the butt of all the “safety school” jokes, Princeton being your biggest rival on the field even after 1869 isn’t exactly something to brag about. Forming a three team conference with Lehigh and Lafayette doesn’t scream 12 team playoff half a century later either. In the more modern times, the Big East should get credit for creating rivalries between Rutgers and Seton Hall, St. John’s, Villanova, and Georgetown on the hardwood, but none of those schools strike much fear on the gridiron.\nRutgers really needs to find a rival, though the expansion of the Big Ten may make this even more difficult. By default, Maryland is the only school that makes sense but when both fanbases are so fair weather (more on that later) there just isn’t much juice. Imagine being in the protected annual matchup meeting. The Chris Ash versus Iowa annual tilt was a complete dud, Illinutgers was acclaimed only by Thumpasaurus and I as being fun/exciting, and I guess maybe there’s bad blood with Greg Schiano welcoming former players and coaches from his disciple PJ Fleck’s sinking ship. The OJ trial (RIP) is African American history, maybe Rutgers-USC can be called something less controversial like the the Zuzu Classic? Poor Tony Pettiti’s in there having to ask if Rutgers’s trips across the Delaware were anywhere close to as successful as George Washington (Huskies anyone?) to justify an annual beat down by Penn State.\nSpeaking of Brits and Italians ...\nNot to hate: Diversity and Inclusion\nNew Jersey was basically a sanctuary state long before ESG was a thing. In addition to Taylor Ham Egg and Cheese, I grew up eating Chinese food and authentic tacos while sitting in the station wagon watching men with turbans pump the gas at the stations they owned to make their way in America. When my dad grew up in our town with Defensive Coordinator Joe Harasymiak’s parents, it was Italian-German with some Irish sprinkled in. By the time Joe and I were playing basketball and baseball, the town had evolved into an Asian hodgepodge with the legendary El Salvadoran enclave to boot. My mother in law asked me last night if I ever met a Brazilian before her daughter and I’m like, ever hear of Ironbound in Newark?\nAll this to say, New Jersey was a melting pot before we needed to start calling it a “Mosaic” to be politically correct. This was on display at the “Grease trucks” many years ago and continues to this day. Rutgers may just be finally capitalizing on its Indian connections in Central Jersey with placekicker Jai Patel as new blood is needed with its most famous fan James Gandolfini having a passed on over a decade ago. Wow time flies. And yes, one day maybe RU will be Ready for an influx of Brazilian fans, too.\nRU in VA: I’m really curious what David means when he talks about the Grease Trucks names. You’re telling me that the Fat Nini 69 was not appropriate? I distinctly remember a drunken night at 2 AM and Osvaldo barking out “Only Bitches and Darrells”. I guess that was probably it.\nI grew up in the other side of the state - much closer to Philly. I experienced the EXACT opposite racial makeup - my friends were all Jewish, we always want through Camden to get to the city, and there were enough rich turds in Moorestown to start a private Quaker school.\nNJ is the ultimate melting pot - and my experience at Rutgers aligns with the most diverse place I’ve ever been.\n...\nDespite the range of people you meet every day, there is one universal constant ...\nTo hate: Obnoxious people in the area\nAbsolutely yes. Having been to most places in the hemisphere, you may not find ruder people in the Americas than at a New Jersey DMV, post office, or public transit station. Unlike Lincoln, Nebraska, where the locals at Paddy’s Pub welcomed me with open arms on a random Wednesday night at 11 PM in January, I don’t even get the same warm and fuzzy feeling from my own mother. “There are clean towels in the closet” is often the gesture of utmost politeness. They say gymnasts are cut-throat, and I can attest to that. There is never any confusion with southern hospitality.\nAt least it’s straight to your face. More than once, when thanking the person behind the bulletproof glass for my bus ticket at Port Authority, I have been greeted with the warmest of the warm “you’re welcomes” by being yelled at through the microphone, “NEXT!” Now that New York is turning into a bunch of softies (unless you are a former President), if you want to be told you suck at everything, head to the Garden State.\nSpeaking of New Jerseyans ...\nNot to hate: Greg Schiano\nMaybe Rutgers didn’t deserve a spot in the Big Ten yet, but the man most responsible for getting the train even on the tracks and almost single-handedly pushing it himself did. Greg Schiano willed the athletic programs to another level with his relentless pursuit of perfection in everything. He understood that details as simple as painting the stadium walls portray a certain image. He knew Rutgers needed to connect with all the high schools in the state, like Iowa and Wisconsin do so well, and never put himself above the mundane. The famous story is that even after he announced he was leaving for the NFL, he was observed picking up a small piece of trash off the ground and placing it in the proper receptacle on his way to his car.\nSchiano was even humble enough to accept some teaching (though luckily not all) from Urban Meyer at Ohio State decades after Joe Paterno before him. Tennessee may have blown a story way out of proportion, but this is more about the journey itself, and Rutgers is glad to have him back. As I harp on when invited to the Scarlet Faithful podcast, Schiano’s strengths as a leader are accentuated even more in the transfer portal and NIL era than they were before.\nUnfortunately with a stubborn old-school personality at the helm ...\nTo hate: Lack of a passing offense\nOften, what it means to be a Big Ten football team is to pound the rock, possess strong special teams (especially punting), and have a defense that wins you slugfests. What made me a regular reader of OTE was a legendary chart I cannot find, composed by Thump, with one axis being “How Iowa you are” and the other axis “How Iowa you think you are.” If I remember right, this was around 2018 or 2019, and Michigan was basically just Iowa but thought they were not. Rutgers under Schiano is in the opposite corner, thinking they are Iowa when they aren’t (quite) yet.\nThat being said, when Rutgers was struggling to climb the ranks under Schiano 1.0, he was willing to air it out some to make things entertaining and at least threaten a comeback once in a while. When the team did have NFL-quality QBs in Mike Teel and Tom Savage, they fed NFL-bound receivers like Kenny Britt and Tiquan Underwood (who both went for 1,000 yards each in the same season) and got Mohamed Sanu 115 receptions in a season, more than the entire WR corps hauled in during entire seasons of the Ash era. So the possibility exists that someday, Rutgers will advance past the Stone Age and into modern football once again.\nSpeaking of large volcanic rock ...\nNot to hate: Mountains, Beaches and the Boardwalk\nPurposely choosing not to live in New Jersey has its perks, and I do encounter people monthly who ask me why anyone would choose to live in the state when given other options. Well, unlike my current state of North Carolina, the beaches and mountains in New Jersey are both roughly within an hour of one another. For weekend warriors who like to vary their activities, there are advantages. New Jersey is not just the Turnpike near oil tanks, but since it’s smaller than California, it gets a bad rap for this fact alone. Nobody complains about the oil refining in LA. They even made Beverly Hills Cop 2, celebrating it in the Golden State. That’s what most people see when shuttling from Newark Airport to midtown Manhattan, and first impressions do matter.\nThe skiing is not exactly Tahoe or Vail levels of luxury and fine powder, but it does exist. With the Big Ten expansion, Rutgers now has company when it comes to beaches (although I have been in LA in June and it was still too cold to swim comfortably). Jersey beaches vary in width and quality but aren’t bad overall. The boardwalks are top-notch, especially after federal money rolls in following periodic hurricane destruction. (at least tax dollars are going somewhere other than fighting foreign wars).\nGetting to these places is at times problematic because of traffic (more on that in the mailbag), and one excuse as to why ...\nTo hate: lack of consistent fan support / professional options\nHowever, the wide range of activities available on fall Saturdays does not excuse Rutgers from having a legitimately sized fan base. Georgia has mountains and beaches, too, but the Bulldogs never had problems packing the seats. My tickets to drive 90 minutes to watch them spank Middle Tennessee State still cost about $131 each. This is probably the main reason to criticize Rutgers. Fans are mostly fair weather, and excuses that the local beaches are preferable to a Knights game are narcissistic and overblown. Making fun of Nebraska or Indiana diminishes what those programs have built over a long time.\nWith the strict lockdowns and mental fatigue, locals are starving more than ever for the type of group gatherings that athletics provide. New Jersey may not have world-class landscapes, but it does have 13 teams in the four major professional sports within a two-hour radius of the Rutgers campus. The real issue is that there is only so much sports energy to go around. A 7-6 record should be a ho-hum year, rather than the best in a decade, to fill the seats. In basketball, Dylan Harper and Ace Bailey are just pieces of a larger attraction because, other than last year, the team has been a consistent fighter/winner under Steve Pikiell. Wrestling, lacrosse, and soccer teams now have good turnouts. Even field hockey sold out when they were ranked #1 in the country. So, it can be done if the product on the field or court is there.\nThe question is, will it be and for how long?",
