But Alhaji Ibrahim Musa Gusau, the 40th President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), says his tried-and-tested simple ways of doing things would help him in taking Nigerian football to its Nirvana, in a frank conversation with MORAKINYO ABODUNRIN.\nNIGERIAN SPIRIT\nNigeria Football Federation (NFF) President, Alhaji Ibrahim Musa Gusau, said his dream to bequeath an enduring legacy on Nigerian football is well alive.\nDespite the fact that the Super Eagles missed the glorious chance of winning the country’s fourth Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) title last Sunday, following a 2-1 loss to the hosts, Cote d’Ivoire, Gusau, with his Pan-Nigerian outlook, noted that the ‘Nigerian spirit’ demonstrated by the Super Eagles despite their loss in the Final Match is something to cheer about looking forward.\n“We have always been talking about the Nigerian spirit but many people simply pay lip service to it,” Gusau noted on the eve of the AFCON final match.\n“The Nigerian spirit is of high significance; it is the overpowering conviction that we can get things done with our will-power, hard work, diligence and perseverance.\n“Currently, we may be having challenges in certain sectors and facets of our national life, but the Nigerian spirit can propel us to overcome those challenges and then reach for glory.\n“That is what the Super Eagles have shown here. At the beginning of the tournament, very few people believed in the team.”\nElected as the 40th President of the NFF at the body’s 78th elective congress in Benin barely two years ago, Nigerian football is surely undergoing some renaissance since Gusau came on board and he reckons that nothing can be achieved without the support of critical stakeholders.\nDESTINY CHILD\nWhile his predecessor was known for his swashbuckling posturing, Gusau is a truism of the common saying of someone being ‘as cool as cucumber’, and he admitted as much that “not only cowboy can oversee the success of Nigerian football.”\nGusau can indeed be likened to a ‘destiny child’ for obvious reasons. Two years ago, he was the leader of delegation of the Super Eagles to the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) held in Cameroon, where the coach Austin Eguavoen-led side flattered to deceive as they crashed out in the Round of 16 to Tunisia after finishing their group stage matches, that included Egypt with Mohammed Salah, in flying colours.\nAt Cote d’Ivoire 2023, however, the Super Eagles nearly won the long-awaited fourth AFCON title for Nigeria but for the loss against the Elephants of Cote d’Ivoire in the Final Match at the Stade Olympique Alassane Ouattara in Ebimpe, on the outskirts of Abidjan.\n“I feel highly delighted to be leading the Super Eagles to the Ivory Coast as the President of Nigeria Football Federation and it’s a thing of joy to me,” Gusau, who will be 60 on 1st March, told Sport $ Style exclusively on the eve of the Super Eagles departure to the 37th edition of the continental showpiece.\n“As you said, precisely two years now, I was given the opportunity to lead the Super Eagles as the head of delegation to the last AFCON in Cameroon, and I stayed with them as such. So, I can tell you that I know the Super Eagles inside and out.\n“Therefore, it’s a thing of joy for me to be leading the team this time around to the AFCON as the president of the federation and I’m very hopeful of achieving good results,” he noted.\nThough his board had a struggling start when he took over the reins of the NFF, no thanks to some of the inherited problems of the last dispensation, and it’s a measure of Gusau’s leadership qualities that there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel for Nigerian football after the not-too distant past that some observers regarded as the ‘locust years of Nigerian football’.\nSUCCESS STORY\n“We just make sure we give our best for the job and then we try to do whatever we feel it is right with the cooperation of the staff and other stakeholders like you (the media), and with the pieces of advice we are receiving from many stakeholders, as such we always try to see that we give our best efforts in order to get the best results for Nigerian football,” Gusau noted when pressed on the success of his board so far.\nUnder his watch and for only the second time in the history of Nigerian football, the country last December produced the Men’s and Women’s African Footballer of the Year as Victor Osimhen and Asisat Oshoala respectively were crowned as the continent’s best players for 2023, amongst other accolades, much to the delight of Gusau, as he beamed with smiles recalling the special night in Marrakech in Morocco.\n“Our success in Morocco at the CAF Awards is not only about the successes of Osimhen and Oshoala but we also won the women’s best goalkeeper award by Nnadozie and the Super Falcons were also the best team of the Year too,” Gusau noted, with his frank but boyish smiles. “That’s to tell you how lucky we were and I’m happy to be part of this success because it has been a long time this happened; I mean to win the African Footballer of the Year for both the men’s and women’s categories as well as the best women’s goalkeeper and then the best female national team. It has never happened before.\n“I must say we are very lucky and we are going to see how we can make Nigerians even happier.”\nGusau, one of the unseen hands during the successful tenure of the Alhaji Aminu Maigari-led board, when Nigerian football won many titles that included the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa and the FIFA U-17 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), surmised that his management style is as simple as A-B-C.\n“As I said earlier, we leave room for stakeholders that are genuinely ready to partner with us for the progress and development of football in the country and that is the main secret behind some of the successes we have recorded so far,” he said.\n“Of course, I try to make myself available for whoever wants to share one thing or the other with us, knowing genuinely that such advice given us is in line with our vision to make sure that we move the game of football forward in Nigeria.\n“A lot of people also tell us what we are doing wrong, where we are doing good and we listen to everybody; so I think that’s the main secret behind it.”\nIn Nigerian football lexicon, there are some that believe that you must be as hard as nail or, simply put, ‘a cowboy’, to be able to oversee the administration of football, given the inherent problems that had long befuddled the game.\nBut Gusau would be the first to dismiss such notion, adding that he has long been in the Nigerian football ecosystem to know what is good for the country.\n“I don’t agree with you that it’s only cowboys that can lead the NFF,” he said amid rancous laughter. “I don’t see it like that because I have been part of the system for a long time and I know what and what is good for Nigerian football.\n“I know the hectic job that is ahead of me; it’s not an easy job to do because it (football) is something that everyone is interested in.\n“I can say 99 percent of Nigerians, both male and female, are interested in what’s happening in Nigerian football, so it not easy.\n“Of course, you have to behave like a ‘cowboy’, but in all honesty, we are doing our best.\n“I can assure you that I’m not a cowboy. Alhaji Musa is still the Alhaji Musa that you know; simple, focused and determined to see that he does what he’s supposed to do to see that the Nigerian football moves forward and achieves success.\n“This is my focus and I won’t deviate from that,” he said.\nApart from ensuring that Nigerian football begins to win big on both the continental and global levels, the NFF President further hinted that it would be a dream comes true for him, if he can give the domestic football the much-needed fillip during his tenure.\nNIGERIAN LEAGUE\nFor many, the domestic leagues: the Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL), Nigeria National League (NNL) and Nationwide League One (NLO) are nothing to write home about. But Gusau said he is committed to ensuring greater things happen across the domestic league, adding that it would be a thing of pride to raise the standard to an appreciable level.\n“Of course, there are so many things we want to do in order to lift the face of Nigerian football,” Gusau further said.\n“The legacy I want to leave behind is to take the game to a higher place than where I met it\n“For example, what we are doing with the league, we are trying as much as possible to improve the standard of the league because I see no reason why our players should be leaving the country because they can get what they want from here.\n“I think if a player can be paid one million naira in Nigeria, it is better than being paid 2,000 dollars in some of those far places they are going.\n“Apart from the league, we are working very hard so that all our national teams can be the best on the continent and even beyond; we want to go back to that culture of winning titles.\n“Before, we used to be the power house as far as age-grade football was concerned and we even have the record of being the best performing country as far as the Under-17 men’s football is concerned globally.\n“All that has gone down, but I want to leave a legacy of taking us back to that level before I finish my tenure.\n“Of course, the Super Eagles remains our greatest brand and it’s also our goal to ensure we get things right with them and not forgetting the fact that we are still the best as far as women’s football is concerned in Africa, but we want the Super Falcons as well as our other women’s teams to challenge for honours both in Africa and against the rest of the world.”\nSIMPLICITY\nYet in his words, Gusau explained that simplicity has been his way of life as he gave a glimpse of his sense of dressing.\n“I try as much as possible to dress and look very simple,” he said. “I still try to remain the Ibrahim Musa you know; a very casual man, but, most importantly, I love wearing white because it always makes me happy.\n“Asides white colour, my other favourite colour is blue, especially when it comes to suit.”\nUnlike many who are enamoured by and crazy with top end designs, Gusau said he has no reason to bother himself as such.\n“I don’t have any favourite design and I’m not crazy about any particular label,” he continued. “I just want to be simple, but I don’t stress myself about a particular design. When I see a design I like on anybody, I will just ask which tailor sewed it and the next thing, I will engage him (the tailor).\n“But in all honesty, I don’t specifically have a single design that it’s a must that I patronise.\n“I always try to take things as easy as possible and whenever I see what I want, I go for it.”\nYet administering Nigerian football even now amid critical economic challenges is not as straight forward as it seems, hence Gusau was pressed for the most difficult decisions he has made since he came on board at the NFF.\n“So far, I can’t remember that very difficult decision because I don’t take most of my decisions in isolation of other members of the board and critical stakeholders.\n“As such, I don’t think there is a single decision I have taken without due consultations.\n“Whatever decision we have taken so far is a decision of the board, so I don’t think I have any singular difficult decision that I have taken for now,” Gusau noted.",
