  "body_text": "We are delighted to confirm that Amanda Ilestedt has joined us on a permanent deal.\nThe Swedish central defender joins us following a two-year spell with French side Paris Saint-Germain.\nAmanda, 30, began her senior career at FC Rosengard in 2009 and went on to have an eight-year career with the Swedish club, winning five Damallsvenskan league titles as well as one Swedish Cup and three Swedish Super Club titles. Two of those league titles came under the management of our head coach, Jonas Eidevall.\nAmanda moved to Germany with Turbine Potsdam in 2017, before signing for Bayern Munich in 2019. The centre-back spent two years at Bayern, signing off with the 2020/21 Frauen Bundesliga title before sealing a move to Paris Saint-Germain, where a two-year stint yielded one French Cup title.\nAt international level, Amanda has won 64 caps for Sweden and has represented her nation at two UEFA European Championships and two FIFA Women’s World Cups, winning bronze in France in 2019. She was part of the Sweden side that won the silver medal at the 2016 Olympics and has been named in the Sweden squad for the upcoming World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.\n“I’m really excited and happy to be here,” said Amanda. “My goal is to win titles and this is a great club with great players and fantastic facilities, so I believe this is the right place for me to achieve that. There is a real sense of momentum around this club and the support has been wonderful – I can’t wait to walk out onto the pitch in the Arsenal kit.”\nHead Coach Jonas Eidevall said: “I’m delighted that Amanda has joined us here at Arsenal. She brings extensive international experience and I believe she has a great mix of presence and technical ability, making her an ideal fit for our squad. I enjoyed working with Amanda during our time in Sweden and am looking forward to coaching her here at Arsenal too.”\nHead of Women’s Football Clare Wheatley said: “Amanda is an experienced international defender in her peak years, so we are very pleased to have brought her to Arsenal. She has a proven track record in domestic, European and international football and we believe she will strengthen our squad in a key area as we look ahead to the new season.”\nThe transfer is subject to the completion of regulatory processes.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
