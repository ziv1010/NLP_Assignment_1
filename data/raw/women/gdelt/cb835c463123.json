Molango’s call for an investigation was echoed by Chichester MP Jess Brown-Fuller.\nThe FA said it was “deeply saddened” by Vigar’s death, and added: “Whilst the health and safety of participants and spectators at the National League System level is the responsibility of the clubs and their local authorities, we will now conduct an immediate review, working with leagues, clubs and relevant stakeholders across the game, that will focus on the safety of perimeter walls and boundaries around pitches in the National League System.”\nUnited States President Donald Trump has warned he will move 2026 World Cup matches away from host cities he deems to be “dangerous”.\nTrump said he was going to make sure San Francisco and Seattle were “safe”, adding that the cities were “run by radical left lunatics who don’t know what they’re doing”.\nSeattle’s Lumen Field is set to host six matches at next summer’s finals, with Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara – an hour away from San Francisco – due to host a further six.\nTrump said: “If any city we think is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup… because they’re playing in so many cities, we won’t allow it. We’ll move it around a little bit. But I hope that’s not going to happen.”\nPalmer is set to be sidelined for two to three weeks with a groin injury, dealing a blow to Chelsea and England.\nChelsea head coach Enzo Maresca confirmed the England international needs to be rested for a period.\nIt means he will miss the upcoming Premier League matches at home to Brighton and Liverpool as well as Wednesday’s visit of Benfica in the Champions League.\nHe will also be unavailable for England’s friendly against Wales in October and the World Cup qualifier against Latvia.\n“We decided to protect Cole a little bit, in terms of not letting his injury get worse,” said Maresca.\n“I don’t think he needs surgery but it is just to manage the pain in his groin. We have decided to be a little bit conservative with him.”\nThe Premier League returns with Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea all in action.\nLiverpool will attempt to maintain their 100 per cent record when they take on Crystal Palace while United striker Bryan Mbeumo faces his old team at Brentford.\nIn the Scottish Premiership, Celtic host Hibernian, while Arsenal play Aston Villa in the Women’s Super League and LaLiga sees its first Madrid derby of the season.",
