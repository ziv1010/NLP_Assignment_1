Gareth Southgate’s side will now play Spain in the finals.\nSir Keir previously supported calls for a bank holiday when England’s women’s football team made it to the World Cup final last year.\nAsked whether he would back a bank holiday if Southgate’s team is victorious, the prime minister told broadcasters in Washington DC: “We should certainly mark the occasion, I don’t want to jinx it. I went to the last Euros final, I don’t want to go through that again.\n“I don’t want to jinx anything but we must mark it in some way. But the most important thing is getting it over the line on Sunday.”\nSir Keir, an Arsenal supporter who regularly plays five-a-side football, said England’s win on Wednesday night was “fantastic”.\nHe is attending the final in Berlin after watching Wednesday’s semi-final from the Nato summit in Washington DC.\nSir Keir was seen watching Harry Kane score England’s equaliser in the match in a room with his Dutch counterpart Dick Schoof.\nThe prime minister got out of his seat and celebrated as the spot-kick was drilled home, then shook hands with Mr Schoof.\n“I managed to pop out from one of my sessions for just five minutes which is when I saw Harry Kane get the first goal,” he told broadcasters.\n“I missed the second one but it was brilliant.\n“So on we go now, great chance. I’ve always said this team were going to go all the way so I’m really, really pleased and just good luck for Sunday.”\nSir Keir said it looked like football was coming home when asked about the result during an Oval Office meeting with President Joe Biden.\nLib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: “The Three Lions are playing their first ever final on foreign soil, and if they bring it home, the Government should bring home a bank holiday to celebrate.\n“England deserves the chance to celebrate a once-in-a-generation event. Who knows, we might even get decent weather.”\nIt is not the first time the Lib Dems have called for a temporary bank holiday in the event of a sporting win, having made similar calls last year when England Women reached the World Cup final.\nTwo extra one-off bank holidays were held across the UK in 2022, one for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee and another for her funeral.\nThe King’s Coronation in May 2023 was also a bank holiday.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments",
