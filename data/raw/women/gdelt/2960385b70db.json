It is a great football region.\"\nOn the field, the Jets men's team, who have two players to sign, have made a strong start to the Australia Cup.\nThe Jets will take on Macarthur in the Australia Cup in the round of 16 at Maitland on Sunday, August 25. If they win, they will be the only A-League team left on that side of the draw.\nThe youth team has earned promotion to NSW NPL1 (second tier) and is poised to complete the season undefeated.\n\"Our men's team are in the sweet 16 of the Australia Cup which is a great result, given the club's recent history,\" Bisetto said. \"We have Macarthur next. There are only six A-League team left which shows nothing should be taken for granted.\n\"The women's team is coming together nicely and start preseason training in just over a month.\n\"The girls academy teams have show improvement and development. Their results in the last month of the season are very different to the first month. That is going well.\"\nOf the field, the Jets membership is up 10 per cent compared to the same stage last season, there has also been an increase in corporate partners and the club has launched a Jest in business network program.\n\"I'd like 15,000 members,\" Bisetto said. \"I think that is achievable. Whether it happens year one, two or three, that has to be a realistic goals.\n\"Getting bums on seats will be an important KPI. Commercial revenue is very, very important to any sporting organisation. The response from the business community has been really positive. In some areas I'd like to be more advanced. Ultimately it is a long-term strategy and long-term relationships we need to build.\"\nKen Schembri (general manager of football), Jason Hoffman (corporate manager and player welfare) and Ben Hawse (commercial, marketing and digital) have joined the staff.\n\"We bought an organisation with good resources,\" Bisetto said. \"They just needed a bit of help. Ken, Jason and Ben have come on board with a lot of enthusiasm. They have very different skill sets and add to the organisation.\"\nBisetto has been very hands-on and met with a number of NPL clubs.\n\"There has been a benefit of having ownership on the ground and present in Newcastle,\" he said. \"That has helped with a lot of the relationships which are being built. I'm looking to get to a few community clubs as well, not just NPL clubs.\n\"It is part of a broad strategy to engage with the community. The community includes football teams, the punters on the street, schools, business network ... it is the region. We will try and get to all of them, whether it's in person, through digital media. We have 50 professional footballers - men and women - and they will have a part to play.\"",
