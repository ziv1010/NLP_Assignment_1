  "body_text": "Three debutantes make winning start as Mayo Women's Masters League returns\nThe LPB Building Services Mayo Women's Masters League got off to a great start at Celtic Park last night.\nThree clubs had winning starts on their debuts at this grade – Ballina Town, Ballyglass A and Snugboro.\nThe early evening fixtures in Division 1 saw Claremorris defeating Westport United 5-1, with title holders Kilmore suffering a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Ballyglass A.\nSome serious talent in the Claremorris side where Marie Bones and Emma Mullin accounted for four of their goals. Heather Merrick got them off the mark early on, but while her goal saw a swift reply from Westport's Laura Hughes, the south Mayo side were to run out comfortable winners.\nBallyglass A's debut game saw Cora Staunton make a return to soccer - Staunton was a member of the Kiltimagh Knock United women’s team that won the national WFAI Intermediate title back in 2007. She notched up two goals for Ballyglass after Sarah Keane got the opening goal 10 minutes in.\nLast season's top scorer, Annie Lynskey, scored from the penalty spot late on for Kilmore but Ballyglass absorbed their second-half pressure to enjoy a winning start to the league.\nIn Division 2, debutantes Ballina Town chalked up a 7-0 result over Fahy Rovers, and Snugboro, also on their first night in the masters, went one better against Ballyglass B, winning 8-0.\nMargaret Bonner was the night's top scorer in the league overall with four goals for Ballina. And Thelma Feeney wasn't too far behind with a hat-trick for Snugboro.\nRESULTS\nDIVISION 1\nClaremorris 5-1 Westport United\nKilmore 1-2 Ballyglass A\nDIVISION 2\nFahy Rovers 0-7 Ballina Town\nSnugboro 8-0 Ballyglass B",
