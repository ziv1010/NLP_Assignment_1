Peacock has plenty of new additions this month, from reality TV, wall-to-wall sports, and plenty of must-watch events packed into just a few weeks.\nNear the beginning of February and throughout the month, sports fans have plenty to circle on the calendar, as Legendary February brings together the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, Super Bowl LX, and the NBA All-Star Game in one nonstop stretch.\nThen, for anyone craving dark comedy and suspense, \"The 'Burbs\" serves it up with a remake of the '80s classic starring Tom Hanks with Keke Palmer taking the lead role instead.\nFinally, there's the season 4 finale of \"The Traitors\", followed by its reunion special, where plenty of secrets finally come to light. Yes, that means more drama as well.\nThere’s plenty more arriving throughout the month, but these highlights are the perfect place to start. Below, you’ll find everything coming to Peacock in February 2026. Check it out and plan your watchlist accordingly.\nNew on Peacock in February 2026: Top picks\nLegendary February: Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, Super Bowl LX, and NBA All-Star Game\nThings kick into high gear from February 6–22 with Legendary February, a massive stretch where three of the biggest moments in sports take over at once. You've got three separate events going on, all available to watch via Peacock. The Milan Cortina Winter Olympics bring world-class competition to the global stage, while Super Bowl LX is all about football’s biggest showdown of the year.\nAt the same time, the NBA All-Star Game brings basketball action to an already packed February, so if you're into sports or just want to be part of history with all the spectacles, these days are your opportunity to jump in and see what happens. It's a can’t-miss run for sports fans, no matter which league has your loyalty.\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\nStream on Peacock starting February 6-22\n'The 'Burbs'\nIn this remake of the 1989 film of the same name, a young couple (Keke Palmer and Jack Whitehall) reluctantly move into the husband’s childhood home. But when a mysterious new neighbor arrives across the street, strange behavior and some super freaky secrets begin bubbling to the surface.\nSoon, the couple realizes their neighborhood may be hiding far more than some weirdly awkward block parties and nosy residents. Their seemingly safe version of suburbia won't last long, and they've got to figure out how to get out or die trying.\nStream on Peacock starting February 8\n'The Traitors' season 4 finale and reunion\nThe tension reaches its breaking point with the season 4 finale of \"The Traitors\", followed immediately by its reunion show. The Emmy Award-winning reality series brings all of its action to a head as the remaining players deal with all their lies, betrayals, and alliances from the inside of the show's Scottish Highlands castle. Host Alan Cummings will return to showcase it all as well.\nThe Faithful have one final prize on the line, so they're forced to scramble and expose the last Traitors. Meanwhile, the deceivers have to survive one final banishment. Once the game ends, you can watch the reunion show to see how everything actually played out behind the scenes for more incredibly juicy drama.\nStream on Peacock on February 26\nPeacock originals and exclusives in February 2026\n- January 26: The Office Superfan Episodes, Premiere, Season 9 (Peacock Exclusive)*\n- February 5: Field Generals: History of The Black Quarterback - Premiere (Peacock Original)*\n- February 8: The ‘Burbs - Premiere (Peacock Original)*\n- February 26: House of Villans, Season 3 - Premiere (Peacock Original)*\n- February 26: The Traitors, Season 4 - Finale (Peacock Original)*\nEverything new on Peacock in February 2026\n* = is exclusive to Peacock\n(++) = New episodes of Reelz original series stream live on the Reelz Channel and are available on demand the next day.\nNew Episodes Weekly\n- Below Deck Down Under After Show, Season 1 (Bravo Digital)\n- Below Deck Down Under, Season 4 (Bravo)\n- Brilliant Minds, Season 2 (NBC)\n- Chicago Fire, Season 14 (NBC)\n- Chicago Med, Season 11 (NBC)\n- Chicago PD, Season 13 (NBC)\n- Dateline, Season 34 (NBC)\n- Days of Our Lives, Season 61 (Peacock Exclusive)\n- Dinastía Casillas, Season 1 (Telemundo)\n- Earth Odyssey With Dylan Dreyer, Season 8 (NBC)\n- Exatlón Estados Unidos: All-Stars, Season 10 (Telemundo)\n- The Fall and Rise of Reggie Dinkins, Season 1 (NBC)\n- Field Generals: History of The Black Quarterback (Peacock Original)*\n- Happy’s Place, Season 2 (NBC)\n- The Hunting Party, Season 2 - Premiere (NBC)\n- Jenna & Sheinelle, Season 1 (NBC)\n- Jeopardy!, Season 42 (Syndicated)+\n- La Casa de Los Famosos, Season 6 (Telemundo)\n- Law & Order, Season 25 (NBC)\n- Law & Order: SVU, Season 27 (NBC)\n- Lejos de Ti, Season 1 (Telemundo)\n- Lobo, Morir Matando, Season 1 (Telemundo)\n- Love Island All Stars, Season 3 (ITV)*\n- Married to Medicine, Season 12 (Bravo)\n- Mutual Of Omaha's Wild Kingdom Protecting The Wild, Season 3 (NBC)\n- On Patrol: First Shift, Season 4 (Reelz)++\n- On Patrol: Live, Season 4 (Reelz)++\n- Poder y Traición, Season 1 (Telemundo)\n- Open House NYC, Season 18 (LXTV)\n- The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills, Season 15 (Bravo)\n- The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills After Show, Season 3 (Bravo Digital)\n- The Real Housewives Of Potomac, Season 10 (Bravo)The Real Housewives of Potomac After Show, Season 1 (Bravo Digital)\n- The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, Season 6 (Bravo)\n- Saturday Night Live, Season 51 (NBC)\n- Southern Charm, Season 11 (Bravo)\n- Southern Charm After Show, Season 2 (Bravo Digital)\n- St. Denis Medical, Season 2 (NBC)\n- Stumble, Season 1 (NBC)\n- Summer House, Season 10 (Bravo)\n- Tails of Valor, Season 1 (NBC)\n- Top Chef VIP, Season 4 (Telemundo)\n- The Traitors, Season 4 (Peacock Original)\n- The Traitors Official Podcast, Season 1 (Peacock Original)*\n- The Valley: Persian Style, Season 1 (Bravo)\n- Vanderpump Rules, Season 12 (Bravo)\n- The Voice, Season 29 (NBC)\n- The Wall, Season 6 (NBC)\n- Watch What Happens Live, Season 23 (Bravo)\n- Wheel of Fortune, Season 43 (Syndicated)+\n- Wild Child, Season 6 (NBC)\nNew additions\nFEBRUARY 2\n- 2 Minutes Of Fame\n- About Time\n- Above the Rim\n- Air\n- All My Life*\n- Along Came Polly\n- American Fiction\n- America’s Sweethearts\n- Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy\n- Austenland\n- Black Ice*\n- The Boss Baby\n- The Break-Up\n- The Brothers\n- Bulletproof\n- The ‘Burbs (1989)\n- Challengers*\n- Coach Carter\n- Couples Retreat\n- Courage Under Fire\n- Deliver Us From Eva\n- E!
