  "body_text": "Journalists in Italy are set to go on strike after a commentator made a string of bizarre mistakes during the Winter Olympics opening ceremony, including misidentifying an Italian performer as Mariah Carey.\nThe Milano Cortina Games got underway with a typically spectacular opening ceremony on February 6.\nOne commentator caused confusion and anger among his colleagues with his errors during the coverage.\nPaolo Petrecca was commentating on the ceremony for RaiSport and got off to a bad start by welcoming the audience to the Stadio Olimpico.\nThe ceremony was not at the famous stadium in Rome, it was at the San Siro in Milan, so he wasn’t even close on that one.\nWhile Carey did perform at the opening ceremony, Petrecca was wrong when he claimed ‘the show continues with Mariah Carey’ as the camera showed Italian actress and singer Matilda De Angelis.\nThe 30-year-old seems to have taken it in good humous, posting pictures from the event on Instagram with the caption: ‘PLEASE, CALL ME MARIAH.’\nPetrecca also saw Italian President Sergio Mattarella walk into the stadium and announce: ‘Mattarella … and his daughter.’\nIn fact, he was with International Olympic Committee President Kirsty Coventry.\nThe stumbling commentator also clearly failed to recognise the members of the Italy’s men’s and women’s volleyball teams, despite both being world champions.\nThe show was covered by RaiSport in Italy, part of the state-owned network, Rai, broadcasting the Winter Olympics free-to-air.\nPetrecca is a director of RaiSport and Italian publication Quotidiano report that he appointed himself to the role of commentator for the opening ceremony at the last minute.\nMore Trending\nRaiSport journalists have responded angrily to his performance, removing their bylines from articles for the rest of the Games and organising a three-day strike after the events finish.\nA statement from the journalist’s union read: ‘For three days, we’ve all been embarrassed, no one excluded, and through no fault of our own.\n‘It’s time to make our voices heard because we are facing the worst performance ever by Raisport during one of the most anticipated events of all time, the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics.’\nPetrecca has now been removed from commentary duties for the closing ceremony on February 22.\nMORE: Winter Olympian admits to cheating on girlfriend on live TV moments after winning medal\nMORE: Are the Olympics really using ‘AI slop’ to promote the Winter Games?\nMORE: Complete guide to curling at the Winter Olympics 2026: From the hammer to power plays",
