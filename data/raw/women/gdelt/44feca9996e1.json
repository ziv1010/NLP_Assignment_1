  "body_text": "The Camp Nou public address system was making its way through Roma’s line-up before the second leg of their Women’s Champions League quarter-final against Barcelona when it lingered on one name.\n“With the number 14, Vicky Losada!” Cue huge applause around Barca’s iconic stadium.\n“I’ve been preparing myself since February 10 so that when the moment comes, I know how to handle it well,” Losada told The Athletic five days before the match.\nAdvertisement\nFebruary 10 was when Roma were drawn against Losada’s former team Barcelona in the last eight of the Champions League. The former Arsenal and Manchester City midfielder spent three separate spells with the Catalan giants, coming through the youth ranks there and rising to become captain. But she never got the chance to play at Camp Nou — just before Barca women hosted city rivals Espanyol in their first match there in January 2021, Losada caught COVID-19.\nSo it was no wonder the 32-year-old walked out onto the pitch with a firm gaze on the grass and a grimace on her face as she tried to contain her emotions. With 54,667 fans looking down at Losada, a 17-year journey ran through her mind — from starting out at Barca to playing against them at the place which she has always considered home.\nGO DEEPER\nSpecial report: Barcelona Women - building a winning identity over 20 years\nIn the stands, her brother Benjamin was almost as nervous as her. He watched the game from a central position, just behind the benches but a little higher, to give himself a better perspective. He admitted he is a Real Madrid fan, but that he has become something of a Barca women’s fan because of his sister, who has been a cule since she was a little girl.\nThere was good news before kick-off as Losada started — having arrived at Roma two months ago, she had only featured from the bench in the first leg at the Stadio Olimpico, which Barca won 1-0.\n“I think it’s because the coach plans to change her in the second half so that Camp Nou will give her a standing ovation,” Benjamin said. “She had a thorn in her side because when she left they still didn’t give Camp Nou to the women’s team.”\nWhen they eventually did, Losada could not even experience the game from the stands because of her COVID-19 infection. It seemed like fate, then, when the draw paired Roma with Barcelona just 10 days after Losada had joined from City.\n“If they had told me earlier, I would have thought it was impossible that Barca could have drawn us,” Losada said. “I’m not very superstitious, but now I do believe in destiny.”\nAdvertisement\nBarca’s first goal came in the 11th minute. They scored their second around the half-hour mark, a remarkable effort from distance from Mapi Leon that left Roma keeper Camelia Cesar helpless. Benjamin turned to The Athletic and made a gesture as if to say, “Oh my god”.\nThen he noticed his sister was experiencing physical discomfort. “She made a strange gesture,” he said. “I don’t understand it, this morning I saw her and she told me that physically she was perfect.”\nFridolina Rolfo scored her second in first-half stoppage time to make it 3-0 but by the break, Losada’s involvement was over. Her face, as she walked down the tunnel, confirmed her brother’s worst fears: she would not be coming out for the second half.\nInstead, Barca’s eternal captain sat at the back of the Roma bench with a look of pain and anger on her face during the second half. She had missed out on her ovation at Camp Nou — another cruel twist of fate.\n“She deserved to leave the stadium with the fans applauding her,” Benjamin said.\nNot that it makes Losada’s journey with Barca any less impressive. As she put it herself when speaking to The Athletic, “I arrived at Barca when I was 13 and left when I was 30. I’ve lived so much I could write a book.”\nThe Barca Losada first joined was very different to the all-conquering team they have now become. She made the first team at 15 years old, but they trained on dirt pitches next to Camp Nou late at night.\n“Nobody knew us,” she said. “When we played at the weekend, only our families came to see us. Many players who were very good had to give up football for work. It’s a world that is now the opposite of what we see.”\nLosada’s trajectory embodies the growth of women’s football in Spain and at Barca. In 2007, she left to spend a season across the city with Espanyol. She returned a year later, becoming one of Barca’s most important players before moving to the United States for a season-long loan with Western New York Flash in 2014. Then she left Barca for Arsenal in 2015 — which might not have been necessary had Barca been at their present level.\nAdvertisement\nThings were different when she returned for her third and final spell in 2016. By then, the team were professional and about to embark on their greatest years yet, culminating in Barca winning the Champions League in 2021 along with the Primera Division title and the Copa de la Reina. Losada raised all three trophies as captain.\nGO DEEPER\nThis Barca-Madrid rivalry is getting intense — and the dispute driving it remains unsolved\nLosada describes those achievements as the “icing on the cake” after so many years at Barca, but she also experienced difficult moments in that final spell.\n“I enjoyed it a lot, but I had a hard time mentally because we are not machines and there comes a point when things overtake you,” she said.\n“I went to the United States, then to England, and played three or four years in a row without a break. There comes a time when the body says enough is enough.\n“In the last few years, I wasn’t at my best physically because I was suffering a lot of injuries — injuries that were very difficult to deal with mentally. It came together with a golden age for the club and being its captain was a lot of responsibility. During the day, there were many things going on that I had to be aware of, not only on the field. It was a very difficult time for me mentally.”\nAfter winning everything, Losada decided it was finally time to say goodbye to Barcelona and head back to England with City. She spent a season and a half there, but injuries meant it was not everything she expected.\nThen Roma called, an emerging team in the women’s game who played a brand of football that appealed to Losada. She signed for them in February and there she has found the happiness she lacked in her final years at Barca and during her time at City. According to Benjamin, she has once again found the essence of football that she missed so much.\n“I see my sister happy, she tells me that Roma reminds her of her old Barca because it is a team that is starting to emerge now,” Benjamin said.\nAdvertisement\nDespite the huge progress in women’s football and at Barca since Losada started her career, the midfielder has no regrets.\n“I’m not sorry I wasn’t born later to be able to enjoy what our generation has fought so hard for because what we have achieved is something to be very proud of,” she said.\n“It was very difficult. We have fought against society and history. The world of football is very masculine and everything is much more complicated.\n“Sometimes you can get confused between being famous and being a public person. Before it was much more family. I gave it more value because you really liked it. Now it is true that there are things to manage.\n“Women’s football is growing a lot and there are girls who are starting to earn a lot of money at the age of 15. That essence that was there before is something very nice and maybe it’s in danger of being lost.”\nLosada is still adapting to Italy. She has yet to see much of Rome, only the trendy Trastevere neighbourhood and the Piazza Venezia. “I’m very geeky about my job,” she said with a chuckle.\n“There are a lot of places I want to visit. Castel Sant’Angelo — I’ve been told by the girls that it’s worth it, that I have to go in. I think the perfect excuse is that my family is coming in a month and I’m not going to have any choice but to move about.\n“I have two dogs that are like children. I get up, take them out for a walk, go to work, come back and when I come back I’m thinking about recovering to be at my best the next day.”\n@losada_vicky 👏👏👏👏 pic.twitter.com/e8xUTVvlnW\n— FC Barcelona Femení (@FCBfemeni) March 29, 2023\nShe feels she can use her considerable experience to help Roma’s players mature. But she is also convinced she can learn from the younger players in the team.\nRoma were outclassed in the second half against Barca, losing 5-1 as their European adventure came to an end. At the end of the match, Losada looked to the stands, possibly trying to locate her relatives or her partner Emma, who was in the press box commenting on the match for Barca TV, the club’s official station.\nAdvertisement\nShe let her gaze wander while her former Barca team-mates went looking for a picture with her. The fans who had once cheered her on as captain also asked her for photos and autographs.\nUnderstandably, it took her a while to leave the pitch. “I’m going to Camp Nou to save as much as I can in my retina,” she had said before the match.\nEven if it did not go as planned, Losada will always remember the day she was finally crowned at her home stadium.\n(Top photo: Fran Santiago – UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images)",
