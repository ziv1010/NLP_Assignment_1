  "body_text": "DRIVING THE DAY: POST-BREXIT DEAL CRUNCHTIME\nIT’S SHOWTIME: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen heads across the English Channel today to meet British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, as the two sides are on the cusp of an agreement to resolve the ongoing tension over the U.K.’s post-Brexit trading arrangements with the EU.\nLogistics: Von der Leyen will meet Sunak in Berkshire, with a press conference scheduled this afternoon. At 4 p.m., EU ambassadors will gather in Brussels for a meeting with Commission Vice President Maroš Šefčovič, where they’re expected to sign off on the agreement, reports Suzanne Lynch. Von der Leyen also spoke to Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar Sunday ahead of the announcement.\nRECAP: Yes, we’ve been here before, and yes, Brexit was supposed to have been wrapped up years ago. But Britain has sought changes to the Northern Ireland protocol — the part of its Withdrawal Agreement with Brussels that keeps NI in the EU’s single market for goods. In particular, the Democratic Unionist Party has refused to enter government in Belfast since an election in May in protest at the protocol, which the party argues weakens Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom.\nWHAT TO EXPECT: The details of the compromise text to be presented today have been closely guarded in Brussels. Šefčovič has been the Commission’s point-man, but von der Leyen’s team has been increasingly involved of late — particularly her deputy head of Cabinet, Stéphanie Riso. Ambassadors will get their first look at the compromise agreement today — though details have been leaking out in London.\n**A message from McDonald’s: Packaging is vital for safe, quick and convenient food delivery.

Get a sneak preview: nosilverbullet.eu.**\nWHAT TO LOOK FOR: The role of the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) is a key sticking-point. In his most recent meeting with ambassadors on February 17, Šefčovič made it clear that the CJEU’s role is non-negotiable for the Commission, sources told us. But today’s text is expected to make some compromise, in terms of ensuring that the CJEU is only the very final arbiter in disputes. Also expected in the deal: further details on a red lane/green lane system for goods crossing the Irish Sea, an enhanced role for Northern Ireland in the rules governing the region, and possible changes on state aid and VAT rules.\nUNKNOWN 1 — TORY PARTY: Even if he manages to strike a deal today, Sunak still has to face down opposition within his own ranks. Backseat-driver-in-chief Boris Johnson has been leading the charge in talking down a deal, insisting that the controversial Northern Ireland Protocol Bill he introduced last summer, which was slammed by the EU and senior members of the U.S. Congress as a clear breach of international law, should not be dropped. Sunak may well put his new deal to a vote — the opposition Labour Party has said it will support him.\nUNKNOWN 2 — THE DUP: It is unclear if the unionist party, which put forward seven “tests” for any new arrangement, will back Sunak’s deal. The party is split, with mixed messages coming from leadership and rank-and-file members.\nUK PERSPECTIVE: As Annabelle Dickson writes in this piece, today is likely to mark “a defining moment in Sunak’s young premiership, which only began in October when he took over a Conservative Party still riven with divisions following the departures of Johnson and Liz Truss in quick succession.”\nRUSSIA’S WAR\nLITHUANIA SLAMS WESTERN AMBIGUITY ON UKRAINIAN VICTORY: Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis hit back at suggestions that Kyiv may have to cede territory to Russia, warning that only “a complete Ukrainian victory” will bring lasting peace to Europe, and arguing that Vladimir Putin sees any concessions as “weakness.” Referring to the Russian president in a Twitter thread Sunday night, Landsbergis said: “He should be in court, not in power.”\nLandsbergis to Playbook: “Even now, one year after Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine, some European super powers do not dare to say out loud: ‘Russia has to be defeated. Ukraine must win,'” Landsbergis told Playbook when asked about the reasons for his intervention.\nWho could Landsbergis be talking about? German Chancellor Olaf Scholz famously refuses to say that Ukraine should win, instead insisting Russia must fail in its invasion. France’s Emmanuel Macron has used similar wording in the past, but recently changed course when he said Paris would “accompany Ukraine to victory.” However, those words have yet to translate into action, as France has delivered fewer weapons to Ukraine than Germany has — not to mention the U.S.\nRussian withdrawal would end the war: In his Twitter thread, Landsbergis listed seven “myths that must be discarded before we can talk about achieving sustainable peace” — including the idea that all wars end with negotiations. “WWII didn’t end with negotiations,” he said.\nIs this revanchism? Countering criticism by some Western leaders that the Baltics’ and Poland’s hawkish stance overshoots the mark, Landsbergis said this wasn’t about “revenge” against Moscow, but about achieving lasting security in Europe. “It’s simple: Peace means respecting borders.”\n‘Security guarantees’: Landsbergis’ warning comes after reports that the U.K., Germany and France are preparing to offer Ukraine security guarantees if it starts peace talks with Russia. According to a Wall Street Journal report, Macron and Scholz urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during his visit to Paris earlier this month, to start preparing for peace talks with Russia.\nBerlin denial: A German government spokesperson on Sunday said there had been no developments for months in the discussion of possible NATO security guarantees for Ukraine, and that at Zelenskyy’s recent meeting with Macron and Scholz, “this issue played no role at all.”\nNow where have we heard about security guarantees for Ukraine before? Around three decades ago, Ukraine gave all its nuclear weapons to Russia in exchange for a promise of peace, with Western powers brokering the deal. So there’s a heavy dose of skepticism about the idea of security guarantees for Kyiv.\nWe’ll talk about China later: Landsbergis argued the appeasers’ reasoning was based on “many misconceptions that has already led our Continent to dangerous dependancies on Putin’s and other regimes. But we shall start talking about the world after Ukraine wins and Russia is defeated.”\nSPEAKING OF GERMANY: A year after Scholz declared a Zeitenwende in German defense, Berlin’s security policy is the same as it ever was, writes Matthew Karnitschnig in this excoriating piece out this morning: “A year in, it’s become clear that the best way to describe Scholz’s much-ballyhooed slogan is with a blunt Americanism: bullshit.”\nALSO TODAY: Manfred Weber, the leader of the European People’s Party, is in Kyiv this morning with a group of center-right MEPs, including EPP Vice Chairs Rasa Juknevičienė from Lithuania and Paulo Rangel from Portugal, an official close to Weber told Playbook.\nEasier said than done: The EPP politicians will be keen to display their support for Ukraine and undoubtedly reassure Kyiv that the party stands solidly behind it. The embarrassing problem is that the EPP has stood by as one of its most famous members, Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi, has blamed Zelenskyy for Russia’s war, praised Putin and spread other Kremlin talking points.\nNOW READ THIS: POLITICO’s Opinion Editor Jamie Dettmer has this analysis of Zelenskyy’s strengths and weaknesses.\nELECTION SEASON\nGREEK ELECTION: Greece is gearing up for a national election, with April 9 now the most likely date, Nektaria Stamouli writes in to report. The conservative New Democracy government is likely to announce a rise in the minimum wage as one of its final decisions, with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis then expected to dissolve the parliament around March 9 or 10. But the election is unlikely to deliver a clear winner, with a second round expected on May 14 or May 21.\nTURKISH ELECTION: Meanwhile, neighboring Turkey is gearing up for presidential and parliamentary elections as soon as May. Ankara seems to have abandoned the idea of delaying the votes after suffering massive casualties in catastrophic earthquakes. As the death toll from the disaster nears 50,000, anger at President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan over his initial response has been growing — it was on display Sunday when football fans chanted for the government to resign.\nNEW FACE OF ITALY’S CENTER LEFT: In a major plot twist, radical candidate Elly Schlein became the new leader of Italy’s traditionally center-left Democratic Party (PD), my colleague Gregorio Sorgi writes in to report. In an open primary, Schlein beat the favorite, Stefano Bonaccini, the more-established governor of Emilia-Romagna. That came as a surprise to the many pundits and pollsters who had written off the 37-year-old former MEP, who left the party under centrist PM Matteo Renzi’s leadership and returned to the fold only a few months ago.\nAnti-Meloni: In a first for Italy’s traditionally male-dominated politics, both PM Giorgia Meloni and the de-facto leader of the opposition are women — with radically different ideology. Schlein, a lesbian with a liberal agenda from LGBTQ+ rights to migration, is seen as the antithesis of Meloni. “I received a mandate to change people, methods and vision,” said the new PD leader in her acceptance speech in Rome, promising to tackle poverty, health care privatization, precarious work and climate change.\nJeremy Corbyn type? Schlein’s victory marks the ultimate backlash against Renzi’s centrist and pro-market policies, and has been compared by pundits to Labour’s lurch to the left under Jeremy Corbyn.\nIN OTHER NEWS\nSHIPWRECK OFF ITALIAN COAST: At least 59 people, including 12 children, have died and many more are missing after a migrant boat sank off Calabria. Survivors said at least 150 were on board when the boat sank in rough sees. PM Meloni, who was elected on a promise to stem migration, said her government “is committed to preventing departures, and with them the unfolding of these tragedies.” European Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson said she “deeply regret[s] the loss of life” and called on EU countries to move forward with new migration rules.\nVIOLENT LOOP IN THE MIDDLE EAST: Israeli and Palestinian officials pledged to de-escalate tensions at a meeting in Jordan on Sunday, reports Reuters, with Isreal vowing to halt new settlements for four months. The move came after at least 11 Palestinians were killed last week during a raid by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank. But in a sign the violence is still escalating, Palestinian attackers shot and killed two Israeli settlers in the West Bank on Sunday, sparking revenge attacks by settlers, killing at least one and causing numerous injuries.\nSpeaking of Israel: More than 130,000 people protested on Saturday in Israel after the parliament gave initial approval to controversial judicial reforms proposed by Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.\n**Next Wednesday at 2:00 p.m. CET, POLITICO Live will celebrate International Women’s Day with figureheads of women empowerment in Europe and discuss about feminization of leadership.

It’s the story of a Romanian construction worker living in Brussels.\nCALLING ALL CAT LOVERS: The Brussels parliament has bought a massive statue of Le Chat, the popular character created by Belgian cartoonist Philippe Geluck, reports La Libre. The statue — which is almost 3 meters high and weighs 2,500 kg — cost €370,000 and will be installed in the parliament’s interior garden as a sign of support for the planned construction of the Le Chat Museum.\nSpeaking of statues: There’s a new one of Vladimir Putin that’s been placed in a children’s playground in Brussels’ Leopold Park. The sculptor, James Colomina, has been moving the red resin full-size visage of the Russian president sitting atop a miniature tank around the world since Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine last year.
