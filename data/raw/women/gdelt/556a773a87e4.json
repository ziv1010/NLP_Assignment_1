  "body_text": "It seemed to be inevitable, but after three years with the Chelsea Women Pernille Harder departs not only as one of the best goal scorers, but a club legend.\nWhen Pernille Harder arrived from Wolfsburg just three years ago, it became clear the Chelsea Women had taken a historic step forward. On September 1, 2020, Emma Hayes signed the Danish international for a world-record transfer fee of for a female footballer, of more than £250,000.\nAs Hayes said, “She can play for any team in the world, but chose us”. The Blues’ manager is right, and when one of the best footballers in the world came to west London, the silverware evidently followed.\nOn Thursday afternoon, via their personal social medias, and the club, Harder announced she will leave west London alongside her partner Magdalena Eriksson. The loss is massive, no matter how you cut it, but with the rumors that Catarina Macario is more than likely headed to the United Kingdom, their is an obvious replacement.\nThe Dane played a major role in amassing seven major trophies with the hope of another one at the conclusion of the league campaign. Harder made less than 80 appearances for the club, but scored 44 goals in the process while lifting the team to their first UEFA Women’s Champions League final in her first season with the club. Whether it was her instant impact off the bench in the 2023 FA Cup final or his stretch of games in January and February of 2021 where she collected seven goal contributions in six consecutive WSL contests, it was impossible to keep your eyes off Harder when she was on the pitch.\nShe has finished top-four in total goals in each season throughout her career in west London. Injuries hampered her time in London, especially this season, but that should not take away the influence she had at the club in the attacking line. Her versatility to be able to play in the No. 10 role, on the wing, and as the No. 9 is something Hayes is going to miss immensely in 2023/2024.\nWhile she is one of the most clinical finishers in the club’s history, the Dane also displayed her unselfishness in the final third. Not once did she seek the spotlight while he talent deserved it. The Chelsea Women’s No. 23 elevated the west Londoners’ in an atmosphere Hayes only could have dreamed of when she took the job back in 2012.\nIt may only have been since 2020, but Pernille Harder gave three of her prime seasons of her career to the Chelsea Women.\nWithout Harder’s move, Macario would not have even considered a move to Hayes’ side, or the WSL. Despite missing the majority of the 2022/2023 campaign, Harder has put on a clinic to close the book on her CFCW career. The midfielder has not missed a beat, contributing to seven goals in the last three WSL contests with two remaining. In three out of his eight outings in blue during this campaign, Harder has accumulated a multi-goal contest. This season, Harder has averaged 6.25 shots per league game, acting as both a goal-scoring threat and one of the best offensive creators the league has seen since 2020.\nThe final photo of her and Madga in the triumph over West Ham United will go down as one of the most memorable of the Hayes’ era. Harder’s love for the club shined through her post on social media, expressing her love she has for the fans, and the west Londoners’ as a club. When it is all said and done, the Dane is going to be known as one of the most talented footballers in history. She is a truly special, and the Blues should be grateful to call her one of their own for three whole years of her illustrious career.\nHarder’s dominance up top transformed the west Londoners’ into a club everyone else feared. Nothing great will last forever, but the greatness of the Danish international will never be forgotten when this club one day reaches the peak of European women’s football.\nChelsea fans around the world and the community here at the PoL would like to thank Pernille Harder for her contributions for the club since coming over in 2020. We wish Harder nothing but the best in wherever she may end up in the future.",
