Their message is more about how we’re going to benefit you.\n“They have great facilities and it’s all about player development.”\nKnueppel, who has not set any kind of timetable for a decision and said he will make more visits, did say that player development “is a big deal for me.”\n“Wherever you go, you are going to get better,” he said. “It’s just who can take you to that next level and I think there are some schools out there better at that than others.\n“It will be a pretty sizable part of my decision.”\n—Pitbull will perform at Waterfront Park on Aug. 26.

For several seconds. As loudly as he laughed during any part of our 19-minute conversation.\n“They say the old wine is the good tasting one,” Behanan said.\n“Everybody always asks me that question.
