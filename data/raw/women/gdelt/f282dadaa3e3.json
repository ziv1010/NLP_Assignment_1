Only a Fever matchup with the Chicago Sky last August brought more viewers (1.6 million) to Ion.\nAt ESPN and ABC, WNBA viewership is up 7% this year, with Disney Advertising revenue from the WNBA increasing 70% compared to last season.\nThe numbers showcase the sport’s growth heading into this weekend’s activities, with the Skills and 3-Point events on ESPN and ESPN+ on July 18, the All-Star Game on ABC on July 19, and both events streaming on Disney+.",
