Belgium FA's new kits: red for Red Devils, blue Tintin-themed away. Vandendriessche pays homage to Hergé, aiming to inspire team performances.\nBRUSSELS: If Kevin De Bruyne goes back to his old haircut, he will make a perfect Tintin at Euro ’24 this summer.\nBelgium Football Association unveiled new home and away kits for its men and women football players Thursday. The home kit continues with the traditional red color worn by the national teams, whose men are nicknamed Red Devils and women Red Flames. The away kit, though, is a tribute to Belgian cartoonist Hergé and the character that made his fame: Tintin, the intrepid reporter: it has a blue jersey with a white collar, brown shorts, and white socks.\nIn his action-packed adventures, Tintin often wears a blue sweater over a white collared shirt paired with brown cutoff pants, white socks and brown shoes. Tintin also has a trademark quiff haircut.\nOver the years, Belgian media have often pointed to the resemblance of Belgian midfielder Kevin De Bruyne to Tintin, particularly when the Manchester City star sported a shorter haircut.\n“We are thrilled to pay homage to a true global icon: Hergé. He not only captured my heart and my mind growing up, but that of so many generations. And that is exactly what the Red Devils, but also the Red Flames, are trying to achieve. Hopefully, Tintin will give them the inspiration to put up great performances, starting this summer in Germany.”\nThe new home jersey, which features a burgundy shade of red, will be worn by all Belgian national teams from Saturday onwards, when the Red Devils play Ireland in a friendly as part of their preparations for Euro 2024. The men's team will debut the away kit in a friendly against England on March 26.\nTintin first appeared in the Brussels “Le Petit Vingtième” newspaper supplement in 1929 and traveled all over the globe. His adventures have sold more than 270 million comics worldwide and have been translated into 70 languages.\nEuro 2024 in Germany is scheduled from June 14-July 14.\nThe Belgium FA announced during the press conference at the Hergé Museum outside Brussels that Red Devils coach Domenico Tedesco extended his contract beyond the 2026 World Cup.\nBelgium Football Association unveiled new home and away kits for its men and women football players Thursday.
