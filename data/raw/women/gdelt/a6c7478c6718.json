(Xinhua/Wang Guansen)Some Nigerians turn to gambling as a risky escape as Africa's most populous country grapples with a cost-of-living crisis.by Olatunji SaliuABUJA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Simon Onyema, a 32-year-old Nigerian, rose in frustration from a wooden bench outside a betting shop in Lugbe, a low-income suburb in Abuja, the country's capital, as he compared his printed football match predictions with the actual results on a large television screen one Saturday evening in March.For Onyema, what started as a harmless football bet about 15 months ago has turned into a full-blown addiction after he lost his job as a supervisor at a local bottled water factory and struggled to secure another.\"At first, I thought I could make quick money from betting,\" he told Xinhua, staring at his crumpled betting slip of about 1,000 odds. \"Now, I cannot stop. Even when I win, I use the money to place another bet because I want more money in this hard economy.\"Onyema's story is not uncommon. Across Nigeria, gambling has tightened its grip on people already struggling with the soaring costs of rent, food, and transportation, exacerbated by the removal of subsidies on gasoline in May 2023. It has become a last silver lining for many, especially the youth, trying to survive and navigate what has been widely described as \"the country's toughest cost-of-living crisis.\"Data from the National Bureau of Statistics show that Nigeria's overall unemployment rate stood at 4.3 percent in the second quarter of 2024, and the headline inflation rate was 23.18 percent in February.Amid soaring living costs, stagnant wages, get-rich-quick mindsets, and sometimes, diehard support for favorite teams that drives people to back them with money, betting shops across Nigeria's cities draw desperate crowds of men and women hoping for a miracle.Sports betting is the most popular form of gambling in Nigeria, fueled by a nationwide football fervor. The betting business has grown exponentially in recent years, with millions of bettors choosing preferred digital platforms to bet on their favorite teams and sporting events.People relax near the National Assembly Complex in Abuja, Nigeria on Nov. 26, 2024. (Xinhua/Wang Guansen)As a way of generating tax revenues, the Nigerian government legalized certain forms of gambling in the late 1990s. Since then, many Nigerians have viewed gambling as a harmless leisure activity, with online sports betting, the lottery, and slot machines being the most common forms.\"Betting has become a growing trend among many Nigerians, especially the youths. You can see from the increasing number of betting shops and online betting platforms that the lifestyle of many people has been greatly influenced, making gambling an integral part of their daily routines,\" said Asake Olasupo, a manager at a betting shop in Abuja, in an interview with Xinhua.In the view of Ambrose Okon, who runs a sports betting prediction group that gives out daily odds to bettors on the social messaging app Telegram, many unemployed youths have seen betting as a livelihood and a quick way to earn money.Okon acknowledged that excessive gambling had ruined many lives, leading people into debt, forcing them to sell off personal belongings, and even pushing them to commit crimes to fund their betting habits.Local media reported that over 65 million Nigerians are active participants in the betting industry, placing an estimated 14 million bets daily.\"Gambling is especially prevalent in the South-West and the South-South geopolitical zones of the country. To be precise, the southwest area recorded the highest prevalence with 92 percent. The reason is the lax stance regarding the activity in the southwestern state of Lagos. It is home to the largest casino in the country and numerous sports betting parlors,\" The Nation, a national newspaper, said in a recent report.Data by Statista, an international data and business intelligence platform, projected revenue in Nigeria's sports betting market to reach 590.58 million dollars in 2025. The National Lottery Regulatory Commission, established under the National Lottery Act of 2005, is tasked with overseeing the sector.According to Chinyere Aguocha, a professor of psychiatry at the Imo State University in the southern part of the country, gambling is \"a double-edged sword,\" with both positive and negative impacts on society.Aguocha noted that when done \"responsibly,\" betting could yield moderate financial gains. She also warned of its associated risks or social vices, including addiction, which could bring about economic instability when done irresponsibly.",
