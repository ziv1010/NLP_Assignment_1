Now, and after going down so well among the local populace of Barcelona and all art lovers from all around the world who visit the renowned museum every day, these digital works of art will also travel to Amsterdam, where they can be visited from May 30.\nThe first two NFTs in FC Barcelona history are part of the Masterpiece collection, a project promoted by Barça Vision and consisting of ten items that will be presented piece by piece. Under the name ‘Masterpiece. A digital tribute to Johan Cruyff and Alexia Putellas’ the famous museum will also exhibit in Amsterdam these audiovisual pieces with which the club pays tribute to iconic Barça moments and people that magnify its historical legacy and heritage.\nThe Moco Museum is an independent facility with a wide range of inspiring modern, contemporary, and street artworks based in Barcelona, Amsterdam, and London, opening in the coming months. Its collection includes works of art by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Damien Hirst, Kaws, Jeff Koons, Yayoi Kusama and Andy Warhol, among others, and now also FC Barcelona.\n‘The Flying Dutchman’ and the empowerment of women in sport\nThe first NFT in the club’s history, entitled In a Way, Immortal (inspired by a famous quote from Johan Cruyff) recreates the late Dutch star’s legendary moment in the stadium when, on 22 December 1973, he ‘flew’ to put a crucial goal past Atlético Madrid goalkeeper Miguel Reina.\nBarça’s second piece of digital art, called Empowerment, represents Alexia Putellas’ exceptional performance in the Women’s Champions League semi-final against Wolfsburg, watched by a world record attendance of 91,648. She scored two goals and has gone on to defend the empowerment of women in sport.\nThe exhibition of the two blaugrana works of art at the internationally renowned Moco Museum once again showcases the club’s clear strategic commitment to the adoption of technology and innovation and, at the same time, to the creation of unforgettable cultural moments of the past and present, with a particular focus on Millennial, Gen Z, and similar supporters.\n- label.aria.viber Viber\n- label.aria.whatsapp WhatsApp\n- label.aria.twitter Twitter\n- label.aria.facebook Facebook\n- label.aria.messenger Messenger\n- label.aria.link label.aria.tick Copy link",
