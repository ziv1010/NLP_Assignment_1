  "body_text": "IT looks set to be a momentous occasion at Malvern Town's HDAnywhere Community Stadium on Sunday as Malvern Town Women look to book their spot in the WFA Sunday Women’s Cup Final.\nThey host Worcester City Development in a local derby semi-final clash, with the winners moving to within 90 minutes of silverware.\nMalvern have been in sparkling form this season and sit second in the Midwest Counties Female Football League One table with just one defeat from their 13 League games and still with a chance of winning the title.\nThey have one final game left in the 2023/24 league campaign, which is a winner-takes-all clash with current leaders Bromsgrove Sporting. If Malvern win, they will be crowned champions, but anything less than that will see Sporting lift the trophy.\nBut for now, focus is very much on the cup and Malvern will be hopeful that their season will end with a trophy and the WFA Sunday Cup presents a brilliant opportunity for this incredibly successful Malvern side.\nThey will be up against it this weekend. Worcester Development play in the the level above Malvern in the West Midlands Regional Women's Football League Division One South.\nBut they have had a challenging season, only winning four of their 17 league matches.\nIt promises to be an exciting occasion and admission is FREE with the action kicking off at 2 pm. The Clubhouse will also be open as usual.",
