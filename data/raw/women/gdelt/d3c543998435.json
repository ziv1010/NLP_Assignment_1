  "body_text": "Best Phoenix-Centric Music Venue\nThe Rebel Lounge occupies a singular place in Phoenix music history. The no-frills, low-slung venue near 24th Street and Indian School Road is the erstwhile home of the Mason Jar, the city’s seminal ’80s/’90s rock club. For the past 10 years, Rebel has carried the torch, giving punk and hard rock bands a home in the Valley and championing acts deserving of attention. Under founder/owner Stephen Chilton (of Psyko Steve Presents), Rebel is a friendly, no-bullshit space where Phoenix’s distinctive music culture is being born nightly. More than a place to visit the past, Chilton’s high-metabolism curation of local and traveling bands make this a venue where you can see the city’s future rising up, mic in hand.",
