  "body_text": "UofL, UK, Bellarmine basketball start regular season Monday night\nCollege basketball season is officially here in the Bluegrass.\nThree of Kentucky's teams are opening regular season play Monday night.\nWatch WLKY's Road to the Final Four special in the player above.\nThe Louisville Cardinals are hosting the University of Maryland Baltimore County Retrievers at the KFC Yum! Center at 7 p.m. It will air on the ACC Network.\nThe preseason No. 16 Kentucky Wildcats open their season at Rupp Arena, hosting the New Mexico State Aggies. That game tips at 8 p.m. It will air on the SEC Network.\nMeanwhile, Louisville's other Division I team, the Bellarmine Knights, open their season on the other side of the country as they travel to face the Washington Huskies at 11:30 p.m. It will air on the PAC-12 Network online.\nAll three teams come into the season hoping for better outcomes than last season.\nLouisville\nThe Cards finished 4-28 last season, so there is little place to go but up for head coach Kenny Payne's team as the Cards host UMBC.\nThis season's start comes after a rough loss to D-II team Kentucky Wesleyan in a pre-season game.\nThe Cards will definitely be looking for a brighter start to the season, especially as the game will feature late, great coach Denny Crum's seat in section 106 permanently painted black and marked in his honor.\nKenny Payne talks about year 2\nKentucky\nCoach John Calipari's Wildcats tip off their season with a bit of a chip on their shoulder.\nThe Cats brought in one of their best batch of recruits in program history but were only ranked No. 16 in the AP preseason poll.\nAfter an underachieving last season with a 22-12 record, the Cats entered the 2023 NCAA Tournament as a 6 seed and lost in the second round to Kansas State.\nWith one of Calipari's strongest teams on paper in a few years, expectations are high amongst Big Blue Nation as the team takes on the Aggies as 16-point favorites.\nBellarmine\nIn the Knights' case, largely due to injuries, Bellarmine finished with a 15-18 record last year and feels it has something to prove this year.\nThey have even gone so far as to continue fighting to be eligible for NCAA Tournament play a year earlier than they're currently able.\nBellarmine jumped to D-I play in 2020 and learned they had to complete four years as a team ineligible to participate in NCAA postseason tournaments.\nThe Knights found out in 2022, even after winning the ASUN Conference Tournament, that rule also applied to the NCAA-owned National Invitational Tournament.",
