While the NFF’s petition against the DRC keeps a faint hope alive, Nigeria’s absence would carry profound economic, professional, and social consequences. SEGUN ODUNAYO explores the financial opportunities and livelihoods at stake for the country if it misses the world’s biggest football stage\nWith one game left in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, Nigerians clung to hope, once again reaching for the familiar calculators that Super Eagles fans have grown accustomed to over the years. Only the top team in each group was guaranteed a ticket to the Mundial, but there was a slim backdoor: second-placed teams could advance to another qualifying round for a shot at the inter-confederation playoffs.\n“Rise up, Victor Osimhen,” fans pleaded — and the towering striker answered.\nThe Galatasaray man scored a hat-trick against the Squirrels of Benin Republic, while Frank “The Tank” Onyeka added a fourth, allowing Nigeria to sneak into the next qualifying round after finishing second in their group. The Super Eagles became one of four African teams vying for a single slot in the inter-confederation playoffs.\nGabon was the first hurdle. After a gruelling 90 minutes that ended 1–1, Nigeria ran riot in extra time, scoring three goals to seal a convincing 4–1 victory. The Democratic Republic of Congo then stood between the Eagles and the World Cup playoffs — a hurdle many fans believed was surmountable.\nBut it wasn’t. After another 1-1 draw over 120 minutes, Nigeria fell 4-3 on penalties.\nThat defeat sent cold shivers not only through football supporters, but also through small business owners, advertising professionals, journalists and stakeholders across Nigeria’s sports economy.\nBad losers?\nHowever, the Nigeria Football Federation filed a petition against the Congolese, insisting that two of their players, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Axel Tuanzebe – both English footballers of Congolese descent – who featured in the match, should not have been cleared because Congolese law does not permit dual citizenship.\n“Our contention is that FIFA was deceived into clearing them,” NFF Secretary General, Dr Mohammed Sanusi, said in a statement. “The Congolese rule (law) says you cannot have dual nationality, but some of their players have European and French passports.\n“What we consider to be a breach of FIFA regulations is there. We are saying it is fraudulent.”\nBut the Congolese Football Federation rejected the petition, describing it as an attempt to overturn the result through administrative means.\nIn a message shared on its official platforms, Fecofa said Nigeria should “play the World Cup with dignity and confidence, not with lawyer tricks,” and described the complaint as the action of “bad losers.”\nThough skeptics feel the NFF officials are on a wild goose chase and have thus dismissed the appeal, the case represents a glimmer of qualification hope. If the federation loses out, the financial costs are huge.\nRewards for appearance\nWorld Cup participation has always carried enormous financial rewards.\nAccording to a FIFA financial report quoted by the Los Angeles Times in October 1994, the USA ’94 World Cup generated $84.3m from ticket sales, $90.6m from television rights and $60.2m from merchandising, totalling $235.1m. FIFA later declared a surplus of $99.7m.\nUSA ’94 marked Nigeria’s debut appearance at the World Cup. Each of the 24 participating teams received more than $650,000 per match played. Despite Nigeria’s painful second-round exit to a Roberto Baggio-inspired Italy, the Nigerian Football Federation earned over $2.6m from that campaign.\nNigeria returned to the World Cup in 1998, hosted and won by France. Each participating team reportedly received $1.4m, while the champions earned about $6.5m.\nThe Super Eagles also featured at the 2002 World Cup co-hosted by South Korea and Japan, drawn in Group F alongside Sweden, Argentina and England. Brazil, the eventual champions, reportedly earned $8m. While official figures for other teams remain unclear, former Super Eagles captain Sunday Oliseh revealed on the Home Turf podcast that Nigeria received $1m from FIFA.\n“We had an agreement,” Oliseh said. “The $1m from FIFA was to be split 50-50. The federation would take $500,000 and the players would take $500,000. That meant about $18,000 each for the 30 players involved in the qualifiers.”\nNigeria returned to the Mundial in 2010 after missing the 2006 edition.\nAccording to FIFA’s then-General Secretary, Jérôme Valcke, teams eliminated in the group stage received $8m, with an additional $1m allocated for preparation. Nigeria exited in the group phase and earned $9m.\nAt Brazil 2014, the Super Eagles equalled their best-ever performance by reaching the round of 16, earning $9m in prize money and an additional $1.5m in preparation costs. At Russia 2018, Nigeria received $8m as a participation fee and $1.5m for preparation.\nThe failure to qualify for the 2026 World Cup therefore translates directly into financial losses for both the NFF and the players.\nVeteran sports journalist Mitchel Obi lamented the scale of the missed opportunities.\nHe said, “For the national team missing the World Cup, if we had got to the quarter finals, which is the average stop of African teams, we’re looking at almost $20m in just one month. For qualifying alone, that’s over $9m. For finishing the group phase, that’s about $12m. And this money would be made in four weeks.”\nFIFA has confirmed that prize money for the 2026 tournament would rise by around 50 per cent compared to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\nThe increase reflects the tournament’s expansion to 48 teams, the rise in global broadcasting revenues, and growing commercial partnerships linked to the competition.\nThe FIFA Council recently approved a record-breaking financial contribution of $727m for next year’s World Cup. The biggest share – $655m, marking a 50 per cent increase compared to the previous edition – will be paid out as prize money among the 48 participating teams.\nThe winners will get $50m; runners-up $33m; third place $29m; fourth place $27m; fifth to eighth place $19m; ninth to 16th place $15m.\nFor 17th to 32nd place prize money will be $11m; and lastly 33rd to 48th place will take home $9m.\nIn addition, each qualified team will receive $1.5m to cover preparation costs. This means that all Participating Member Associations are guaranteed at least $10.5m each for their participation in next year’s tournament, leaving the Eagles to rue their luck.\nLost visibility and more opportunities\nBeyond prize money, Obi noted that absence from the World Cup denies players invaluable visibility and high-value transfer opportunities.\n“Jay-Jay Okocha’s move to PSG after France ’98 didn’t happen by accident,” he said.\nObi also pointed out that non-qualification limits Nigeria’s chances of attracting high-profile international friendlies and the lucrative appearance fees that accompany them.\n“And for the players, it’s a massive loss of opportunity. Some of them in their lowly clubs would may get good transfer opportunities. When ‘Jay Jay’ left his club in Turkey for PSG, wasn’t it because of his performance at the World Cup in France?”\n“The chain effect of going to the World Cup is massive. And it’s not limited to players. Even journalists gain from the experience of covering a World Cup,” he added.\nLost media opportunities\nBeyond the NFF and players, Nigeria’s failure to qualify has significant consequences for journalists and the media industry.\nAs a journalist who has covered several World Cups, Obi described the experience as invaluable.\n“Journalists gain unmatched exposure and experience covering the World Cup,” he said.\nSpeaking exclusively to The PUNCH, Nigerian photographer Sulaimon Adebayo, popularly known as Pooja, described Nigeria’s absence as a major blow.\n“I’ve covered two World Cups without the Super Eagles, including Qatar 2022, and it really affected business,” he said. “Compare that with tournaments where Nigeria qualifies, like the last AFCON where we reached the final. Nigerian journalists lose quite a lot when the team is absent.”\nAccording to Adebayo, brand sponsorship dries up significantly when Nigeria is not participating.\n“There are two types of sponsors; some are already into football while the second type is for those who aren’t really into football. Taking AFCON as an example, the likes of Tecno, 1Xbet and co are AFCON sponsors, if a country as present and popular as Nigeria is in such tournament and you submit a proposal, it’s very easy to get sponsorship.”\nAdebayo said convincing non-football brands becomes nearly impossible without Nigeria’s presence.\nHe said, “For brands that aren’t into football activities, they need convincing before they sponsor journalists to such tournaments. Now imagine when Nigeria isn’t even going for a tournament, it won’t even work. The loss is deep, we can’t really quantify the amount of brands that would not want to sponsor journalists.”\nAdebayo noted that the Super Eagles’ performance directly affects media opportunities.\nHe stated, “At the last AFCON, some brands didn’t even support because many felt Nigeria wasn’t going to go beyond the group stage. But when we got into the quarter finals, we saw brands that reactivated and began doing adverts and promotions with journalists. When Nigeria goes deep in tournaments, brands look out for journalists at these tournaments to partner with them so that they can push their products and services through that tournament.\n“When we got into the finals against Ivory Coast, there were brands that hadn’t taken part all through the competition that resurrected because they wanted to join the party as well.\n“We can’t really measure the amount of money we have lost. It’s sad.\n“When Nigeria isn’t even at the tournament, it just won’t work. The loss is deep, and we can’t quantify how many brands walk away.”\nPooja rued the fact that many journalists have now missed two World Cups in their prime years.\n“Footballers return to their clubs, administrators go back to their offices, but journalists are the ones who lose business opportunities,” he said.\n“I always tell my generation of journalists that we have missed two World Cups in our peak years, 2022 and 2026. That means we have lost the opportunity to get brands to partner with us for the World Cup in eight years. Most of us will be in America to cover the World Cup but it would be us using our savings to push our brands into big spaces.”\nAlso sharing in his book, ‘My Autobiography’, ace sports journalist, Mumumi Alao, lamented that the inability of the Eagles to attend AFCON 1996 put “Complete Sports (a sports publication) into trouble” because they were losing money as a result of lack of interest from Nigerians.\n“We had launched Complete Sports on December 18, 1995 in anticipation of the Africa Cup of Nations finals in January 1996. But the moment it was confirmed that the Eagles would not be participating, local Nigerian interest in the competition waned and Complete Sports, suddenly with no major event to report, was standing on one leg.\n“The following months were very rough, to say the least. Unlike a weekly or monthly publication that gives the publisher some breathing space even in times of poor sales, a daily publication is suffocating and gives no space at all. As hard as we tried to keep the newspaper going, our accountant, Ayoola Adeleke, would come to management meetings to declare in his usual cold-blooded manner, ‘For everyday that we are publishing, we are simply losing money.’”\nHowever, he mentioned that there was a contrast in fortunes in 1996 when Nigeria won gold at the Olympics.\n“Between July and September 1996, Complete Sports got a reprieve during the Atlanta ‘96 Olympics Games in the United States of America when Nigeria won the gold medal in football, beating global power houses Brazil (4-3) and Argentina (3-2) in the semi-final and final respectively. I covered the Games for all our publications and we made some very good sales, especially with Complete Football International that sold-out its Olympics special edition titled ‘Golden Boys,” he shared.\nAdvertising, business, viewing centres lose\nA newspaper advert executive, Boye Ajao, said he was totally devastated when Democratic Republic of Congo, dashed Nigeria’s dream of appearing at the 2026 World Cup.\nHe said, “I sat there with my sons feeling sad. That game meant I had lost a lot of potential clients for the year 2026. I can’t even quantify the loss. When events like the World Cup happen and Nigeria is present, extra money is released by several companies for advertisement but I guess that won’t be happening next year.”\nAkin, a football viewing centre operator in Arepo, Ogun State, echoed similar frustrations.\n“Usually, we don’t subscribe around June and July because all leagues aren’t on but now, we’d have to suscribe and show games for people and this may lead to a loss for us because Nigeria won’t be there and only a few persons would come out to watch.\n“If we say we’re not showing the World Cup because we won’t be having many customers, the few people coming out may go elsewhere and we may never get them back again. So we have to show the games but maybe at a loss because our major boom day may only be the World Cup final,” he said.\nWake-up call for Nigerian football\nObi believes Nigeria’s absence from the World Cup for eight consecutive years should serve as a national wake-up call.\nHe called for more investment to build the Nigerian league.\n“I have told many people, this is time to start creating our World Cup at home, which means we should elevate our home competitions to global standards. If we raise our league to where the prize money competes with what is offered by CAF at continental level or say we put a $4m or $10m price tag on our league, that’s not too high, we’d be increasing the standard,” he said.\nHe hopes that the Nigerian league can get big enough to attract outsiders with its attendant contribution to the economy.\n“That’s why our players go outside because the exchange rate doesn’t allow them the flexibility of balancing their income and doesn’t match their expectations. It’s all a reflection of our society, there’s a decay inside.\n“Our players now go to Sudan which doesn’t even have home to play league football where their clubs play in different countries. When would our players play at home and not be going to places like South Africa?”\nHe argued that Nigeria’s football struggles mirror deeper societal and economic decay.\n“Not being in the World Cup in the last eight years is a reflection of where Nigeria is today. More than even the economic side of it, it’s the societal balance. For a country that prides itself as using sports as a vehicle of unity and peace, when you don’t get to the apex football even for eight years then something is missing.\n“And there’s no guarantees we’d go next time around in 2030 and that means we have missed the World Cup for 12 straight years. It has never happened since we started qualifying for the World Cup, we had gotten into the song and now we can’t even chant. We used to be a beauty in football but that beauty is almost lost. If we fix the economy, we’d also be fixing Nigerian sports’, he said.\nCorruption, waste and bleak future\nVeteran broadcaster Deji Omotoyinbo blamed corruption and lack of prudence for Nigeria’s decline.\nAnother ace sports broadcaster, Deji Omotoyinbo, decries corruption and lack of prudence that have hobbled investment in the Nigerian football and the sports sector in general.\nHe lamented that Nigeria has nothing to show for the huge earnings realised from previous World Cup appearances.\n“The Egyptian FA is moving into their newly built headquarters. The multipurpose facility has a swimming pool, gym, training ground, auditorium and hostels for all national teams. We’ve been to six World Cups, collected $22m from FIFA as training grants and appearance fees in total since 1994, alongside billions of naira in sponsorship fees, with nothing on ground to show for it. No Centre of Excellence, No Football Development Centre. NOTHING! All we do is go to the World Cup, come back and start planning to attend the next one.”\nOmotoyinbo feared that the decline would continue except something drastic is done.\n“The local league is comatose, women’s dootball is moribund and the age-grade teams are struggling.\nThe signs are showing and the cracks are widening. If we don’t arrest this slide, disaster looms ahead for Nigerian football,” he warned.\nPooja expressed the hope that Nigeria will make it in 2030, adding that the ongoing African Cup of Nation would be a consolation.\n“We’re hopeful that in 2030, we’d be at the World Cup and can only use AFCON as consolation but the type of sponsors that comes with the World Cup is different. With the World Cup, other football tournaments across the world shut down, everything stands still for it and no major leagues are playing, the attention of the world is on the tournament, unlike AFCON where leagues are still on and attention is shared,” he said.",
