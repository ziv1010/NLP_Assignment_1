  "body_text": "Since 2000, the population of Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Maitland, Port Stephens and Cessnock has risen by over 100,000 people, with a similar rise expected by the mid 2040s. Yet we still only have four large hospitals plus Cessnock and Kurri Kurri.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nSure, Maitland has been rebuilt, but it will not reach its full potential for some time. The John Hunter is being upgraded, yet demand for public health services has never been more prevalent than in the past few years. Even with two extra ambulance stations (Edgeworth and Sandgate's makeshift one, and one each proposed at East Maitland and Branxton) the demand will not go down, with more ambulance ramping the result.\nWith only four emergency departments already stretched, paramedics are having to travel further to get to patients, then back to hospitals and wait longer to be able to hand over their patients. Big is not better.\nIf Belmont Hospital is full to capacity and the Calvary Mater, John Hunter and Maitland are full, where do the paramedics take their patients? Governments of all flavours have got it wrong for the past 30 years and now the community is suffering. The extra ambulance stations proposed are welcome, but where will the paramedics take their patients and will that really help with the ability for those paramedics to take a meal break?\nDoug Bell, Raymond Terrace\nParks aren't political playthings\nI THINK it's time that the council got its hands off our sporting fields for redevelopment. Instead of using the parks at Lambton for a basketball stadium, they should be upgrading these fields for the community to use all year and in all weather conditions.\nI have also noted that Smith Park now has a wire fence around the perimeter. What is happening with this park? It is used for cricket and touch football. What happens now to that? Why can't the old gas works at Hamilton be used for the basketball stadium? There is a lot of land there. I would suggest that as a council election is being held soon, residents should let the council know your feelings at the ballot box. It's a mess.\nGreg Lowe, New Lambton\nSeeds of hate were sown gradually\nWHEN Prime Minister John Howard, back in 2001, claimed that asylum seekers were threatening to throw their children overboard after their small vessel was intercepted, I believe he planted a race hate seed.\nWhen Tony Abbott in 2015 urged European leaders match his stance and refuse entry to asylum seekers, he planted a seed of race hate. The Tories took up the slogan \"stop the boats\" themselves.\nFast forward to Opposition Leader Peter Dutton, who I believe has planted another race hate seed by linking the shortage of affordable housing to immigrants.\nThe recent violent outbreaks across England are the result of years of race hate seeds being planted (\"King Charles calls for unity after riots in UK\", Herald 10/8). Nigel Farage's constant diatribe against asylum seekers and immigrants has also contributed, along with those behind false social media postings regarding the person who allegedly murdered young children in Southport.\nAs one wise soul wrote on a placard a few days ago in a Liverpool peace rally, the enemy of the working class travels by private jet, not migrant dinghy.\nJulie Robinson, Cardiff\nGin was a bad choice anyway\nWHY have NSW Police continued to buy alcohol with taxpayer's money for the police commissioner to give away as gifts anyway? It was seriously at odds with police campaigns against excessive alcohol consumption and driving. Every day we are reminded of the results of excessive drinking and driving. Everyday and long weekends extra police are out testing drivers for alcohol and drugs. It's a fact of life now to expect to be breath tested driving or riding.\nIt's not only about who's friends with whom, or where the gin came from. I believe the commissioner of police giving away alcohol as gifts is outdated and not at all sensible. I'm reminded of the Rum Corps, who had a monopoly that successive governors of NSW could not control. Any other outdated police practices that need dumping?\nKerry Vernon, New Lambton\nHumanity in terror is hard to see\nJulie Robinson (\"We're only human after all\", Letters, 6/8), it's undeniable that Hamas terrorists behave more atrociously than most humans. How do those who you say \"suffer most\", women and LGBTQI people for instance, fare under the Hamas regime?\nPeter Dolan, Lambton\nNo healing in refusal to hear another view\nTO see Peter Dutton spruiking to the media that there will be no Makarrata or truth telling under his leadership with Michaelia Cash in the background with loud \"hear hears\" I found a really poor example of leadership. For privileged politicians who sit in comfort in their offices and are chauffeured around to deny the Indigenous people of this country a say or some empathy is really poor form. Kevin Rudd's \"sorry\" helped heal, but I thought Dutton was deliberately divisive.\nSteve Robinson, Wangi Wangi\nEmergency staff were impressive\nHats off to John Hunter's Emergency Department. Friendly, caring and thorough. How fortunate we are to have such a great facility in our area.\nSusan Gray, Newcastle\nHigh prices may bring profits\nTHE very high wholesale electricity generation prices that are happening now will surely bring in new investors for electricity generation.\nAgner Sorensen, Teralba\nEveryone reacts their own way\nRegarding the report that top prosecutor Nicholas Cowdery SC stated that 'cannabis should be legalised for recreational use' (\"Mood-altering drug use a 'human right': top prosecutor\", Newcastle Herald 2/8): what Mr Cowdery seems to choose to ignore is the fact that cannabis and other 'mood-altering' drugs may improve a particular person's mood, however, in a substantial number of instances these drugs may also have the opposite effect and cause a deterioration in the person's thinking. We have both happy drunks and nasty drunks; same with recreational drugs.\nRichard Devon, Fishing Point\nUS election won't end the world\nOur staunch conservative correspondents are in a lather concerning Kamala Harris's possible victory in the US elections. Keep your spirits up chaps. The sky won't fall and the sun will rise. Trump is not the saviour.",
