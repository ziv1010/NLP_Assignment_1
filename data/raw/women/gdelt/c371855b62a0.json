Honestly, I have no idea why I bought her a pair of binoculars, it seemed like a good idea at the time.\"\nWilliam appeared on the podcast in 2020, where he talked about his love of football, both watching and supporting the beautiful game.\nBut it seems that playing in matches is now taking its toll on the 40-year-old, who admitted his struggle earlier this week.\nIt came as he was carrying out an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle, where he handed ex-England striker Luther Blissett an OBE.\nThe former player was being recognised for his services to football and his charity work, with William confiding in him he still enjoys playing in 11-a-side games.\nAnd after receiving his award, the former Watford player discussed what he and the Prince of Wales talked about - and how he gave him an invitation.\nHe explained: \"We had just a couple of little words. I did ask him if he would love to come and join us on the (Watford former) players club and he said yes, he would love to.\n\"He said he was playing (football) last week and he said he couldn’t walk for a week afterwards. He says he still plays 11-a-side.\"\nMeanwhile, William will get his footy fix today as it has been confirmed he will be at Wembley for another big match.\nHe will be there for the women's FA Cup final, which will be contested between Manchester United and Chelsea. And once the game is over, he will be on hand to present the winners with the trophy.\nREAD MORE: King Charles' slimmed-down monarchy will mean too much work for royals, claims expertREAD MORE: Prince Harry's 'deliberate' Coronation seat was 'overseen and approved'READ MORE: Queen Camilla's telling six-word comment about Coronation outfit revealed by lip readerREAD MORE: Kate Middleton issued concerned warning to William before Coronation, says lip readerREAD MORE: Prince William presents top honour to royal aide who called Meghan Markle a 'bully'",
