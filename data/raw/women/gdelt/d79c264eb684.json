  "body_text": "As the fall 2024 semester begins, Harvard Law School’s campus is buzzing with fresh energy, thanks in part to a new crop of talented J.D., LL.M., and S.J.D. students. Hailing from all over the country — and world — they are former teachers, singers, congressional staffers, engineers, financial analysts, journalists, and much more. There are even two Jeopardy! contestants, four professional figure skaters, and one alligator wrangler among the bunch.\nRead on to learn more about some of these HLS community members — and future friends, study partners, and colleagues. (And as a bonus, a few shared a photo of themselves as a baby, so you can watch them go from youngster to young lawyer.)\nBert Li ’27\nWhere I’m from: Golden, Colorado\nWhat I was doing before law school: I spent a year doing management consulting in New York City, and then I quit my job to be a full-time EDM producer, songwriter, and DJ! It was a once in a lifetime opportunity (insofar as I’d probably never have this much free time again) and I will always cherish this special chapter of my life.\nMy interests and hobbies: Outside of work and school, I like playing soccer, snowboarding, playing covers on my guitar, and practicing Shaolin kung fu.\nAn interesting fact about me: My friends and I once drove from Colorado to New York in a nonstop 32-hour road trip (without a single speeding ticket)!\nWhat I’m looking forward to at Harvard Law School: I can’t wait to meet all the amazing folks that make HLS the place that it is. There are some “wicked smaht” folks here, and who knows, maybe three years will be enough for some of that to rub off on me!\nJasmine Bacchus ’27\nWhere I’m from: Boston, Massachusetts\nWhat I was doing before law school: After graduating from Brown, I spent a summer on the Intellectual Property team at Louis Vuitton before taking a year to get my masters in Social Science of the Internet where I focused my research on digital fashion. After that, I joined Microsoft and was on the Corporate Development Team where I worked on M&A and investments.\nMy interests and hobbies: I’m a big foodie and love trying new restaurants in Boston. I also love all things fashion and beauty, watching “Survivor,” taking ballet classes, and making lots of Spotify playlists.\nAn interesting fact about me: I run a wine tasting club where I host interactive tastings that highlight diverse wine producers and owners. It’s been a great way to meet other wine lovers. One day, I’d love to get my sommelier certification!\nWhat I’m looking forward to at Harvard Law School: I’m excited to be part of a diverse class and meet classmates who come from a wide range of backgrounds and interests and I look forward to building long-lasting friendships. I’m excited to get involved in student organizations and courses that will help me explore my interests and shape my career path.\nKelsey Bergeson ’27\nWhere I’m from: Boulder, Colorado\nWhat I was doing before law school: I earned a master’s degree at the University of Texas at Austin, where I studied Spanish linguistics. My research explored the social and linguistic predictors of language change in semi-rural communities in the Ecuadorian Amazon, where Spanish is increasingly spoken alongside and instead of heritage languages. I also taught Spanish and English at the middle school, high school, and university levels, and spent time living in Madrid, Spain and Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nMy interests and hobbies: My hobbies tend to be seasonal. In the winter, I enjoy snowboarding, baking, hot yoga, and reading. In the summer, I love running, cycling, going to concerts, and trying new restaurants. I’m also learning to golf, but so far I am pretty bad at it all year long.\nAn interesting fact about me: I never miss an episode of my favorite celebrity gossip podcast. Shoutout to all the HLS Wholigans!\nWhat I’m looking forward to at Harvard Law School: I’m so excited to get to know my incredible classmates and professors.\nWill Skinner ’26\nWhere I’m from: Winnetka, Illinois\nWhat I was doing before law school: For the last two years, I served as a political analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency, where I wrote about China’s foreign policy behavior for the president and the National Security Council. Before that, I spent about three years at the Defense Intelligence Agency where I focused primarily on energy security issues. In short, a lot of time going through “Track Changes” in cell phone-free, spook-filled office buildings in the Washington, D.C. area.\nUndergraduate institution/previous law school: Harvard College/Georgetown University Law Center (Evening Program)\nMy interests and hobbies: I’m not sure if this counts, but one thing that brings me great joy is going down late-night Wikipedia rabbit holes and then shoehorning the fruits of said rabbit holes into conversations with friends. I also love listening to excessively thorough biographies on Audible, watching musical theater, and spontaneously calling friends and family while in my car.\nAn interesting fact about me: As part of my first job out of college, I spent several months traveling between seatbelt, airbag, and steering wheel factories across northern Mexico and even personally made a few seatbelts that are currently in cars on the roads (for those curious, I haven’t been sued yet!). Only years later did I reveal to my mom while watching “Narcos” that one of those factories was around the corner from El Chapo’s first-ever drug tunnel into the U.S.\nWhat I’m looking forward to at Harvard Law School: Learning by osmosis. At Harvard, so much wisdom can be gleaned just by physically being here and chatting up strangers, whether at the library or while waiting in line for food at El Jefe’s or Noch’s.\nTimothy McDonald ’27\nWhere I’m from: Baltimore, Maryland\nWhat I was doing before law school: Working as a patent agent at Venable followed by a summer as an SEO intern at Weil.\nMy interests and hobbies: Basketball, movies, chess, anime, film pictures\nAn interesting fact about me: I am a twin! (Fraternal)\nWhat I’m looking forward to at Harvard Law School: I’m looking forward to the interesting discussions that will be fostered in the classroom! There wasn’t much of that creativity during undergrad due to the nature of my STEM degree, so I’m interested to discuss challenging topics that are always changing.\nAyesha Bashir LL.M. ’25\nWhere I’m from: Pakistan but I’ve been living in Qatar for the last three years.\nWhat I was doing before law school: I studied international relations in my undergrad and worked as a research associate on the Paigham-E-Pakistan project for the reconstruction of a more inclusive Pakistani society. I also used to ride horses and go on hikes with all the free time I had before law school.\nMy interests and hobbies: I enjoy swimming, horseback riding, and recently picked up skiing as well! I love both video games and board games. I also find cooking and baking to be my favorite ways to de-stress. In law I’m interested in anything related to technology and healthcare, even better if it combines the two.\nAn interesting fact about me: I’ve had my stuffed toy since birth, taking him everywhere I go, even on all my travels — you’ll see plenty of him on my Insta!\nWhat I’m looking forward to at Harvard Law School: I look forward to making new connections and friends from all across the globe. As someone who just finished their first law degree I’m still figuring my career out and what better place to do that than surrounded by the wonderful community at Harvard!\nLauryn Wang ’27\nWhere I’m from: Thousand Oaks, California\nWhat I was doing before law school: I graduated from UCLA in March, where I majored in history and minored in Asian American studies and community engagement and social change. Outside of the classroom, I was a sports journalist and editor at the Daily Bruin newspaper and labor policy research intern at a labor nonprofit. Some of my current interests include name, image, likeness (NIL) issues and unionizing within NCAA athletics!\nMy interests and hobbies: I’m a lifelong UCLA fan, lover of basketball, average golfer, and avid Goodreads user. I also really like experimenting with film photography and exploring sustainable fashion through thrift shops and flea markets.\nAn interesting fact about me: I’ve covered two March Madness tournaments as part of the press, one in which Caitlin Clark sank a corner 3-pointer about a foot away from me right after I plopped down at an empty reporter seat!\nWhat I’m looking forward to at Harvard Law School: I’m looking forward to expanding my advocacy skill set whether through Student Practice Organizations or clinics, and doing so in community with really amazing peers. I also appreciate the culture of mentorship, both formal and informal, that I’ve discovered already at HLS. I can’t wait to continue growing through these relationships and one day paying it forward.\nSaxon Bryant ’27\nWhere I’m from: I claim Pueblo, Colorado, but I’ve lived in 9 states over the years.\nWhat I was doing before law school: After graduating from Penn, I spent a year as a Fulbright Debate Coach in Taiwan. I worked with eight high schools across the country teaching students, educators, and administrators the foundations of rhetoric and public speaking. When that was done, I returned stateside to Washington, D.C. where I worked with McKinsey & Company as a business analyst for two years. The summer before law school I did a bit of globe-trotting and traveled the world from New Zealand to Portugal with several stops in between.\nMy interests and hobbies: Playing and watching rugby, going to music festivals, sampling exotic liquors, impulse purchasing paintings, and anything outdoorsy. I also do my own nail art!\nInteresting fact: Before moving to rural Colorado, I thought tumbleweeds only existed in movies.\nWhat I’m looking forward to: For me life’s best memories are made of micro-moments: those miscellaneous sidebars between classes or inside jokes that pop out of nowhere. The next three years will be a once-in-a-lifetime chance to live, laugh, and learn with friends from around the world. The readings will be daunting but decades from now we’ll all remember the special moments we build as a community.\nGabriella Achampong ’27\nWhere I’m from: Chambersburg, Pennsylvania\nWhat I was doing before law school: I just graduated from The Pennsylvania State University in May where I did a lot of research on civil rights in education. I was recently published in my first book, having written a chapter with my former professor on voluntary integration! I also co-wrote a few articles for the magazine Principal Leadership throughout undergrad and have loved dipping my toes into the academic side of law these past few years.\nMy interests and hobbies: I love watching professional women’s soccer, dancing, reading, and listening to music from around the world; I love soca music from Trinidad, Afrobeats, and K-Pop!\nAn interesting fact about me: I can name all the U.S. presidents in order!\nWhat I’m looking forward to at Harvard Law School: I am looking forward to learning from my classmates’ experiences, making lifelong friends, and engaging with the Equal Democracy Project and Election Law Clinic.\nJack Seigenthaler ’27\nWhere I’m from: Weston, Connecticut\nWhat I was doing before law school: I spent several years in Nashville on the policy team at ACLU of Tennessee, where I helped manage advocacy campaigns and lobbying efforts at the state legislature. Then I moved to Brooklyn and served as policy and budget director for a New York City Council Member. I’ve also spent much of my time post-undergrad on music. Over this past summer, I recorded an album and toured the Northeast with my band.\nMy interests and hobbies: I’m an avid runner. I try to catch as much live music as I can, and I love learning about and exploring public transit systems.\nAn interesting fact about me: I’m a huge fan of Wolverhampton Wanderers (or Wolves), an English Premier League soccer team based in the West Midlands of England. A longtime dream of mine is to catch a home game in Wolverhampton.\nWhat I’m looking forward to at Harvard Law School: I’m thrilled to be a student again — I recognize what a gift it is to learn full-time once more. I’m also so excited to meet my classmates, from whom I know I’ll learn more than I can imagine over the next three years.\nDomenick Bailey ’27\nWhere I’m from: This is always a complicated question for me, with one answer being, “I’m from all over.” My dad was my role model growing up, and as a kid, watching his career as an Army officer was transformative. However, as an Army family, it also meant we packed up and moved just about every two years, with stops in the Netherlands, Germany, Kansas, Hawaii, and more. As a result, I call Virginia home although I was born in San Antonio, TX, since many of my most formative years took place in the commonwealth.\nUndergraduate institution: University of Virginia\nWhat I was doing before law school: Before law school, I was a policy aide to my hometown member of Congress, Rep. Abigail Spanberger, where I worked on small business, civil rights, and voting rights issues. It was an extremely gratifying experience to serve the community I call home and see behind the curtain of the policymaking process. I also participated in the SEO Law Fellowship and had a great experience learning more about private practice while working at Covington & Burling LLP in Washington, D.C.\nMy interests and hobbies: I love all things sports — particularly watching the NBA as a huge LeBron James fan. I spend much of my free time hanging out with friends and family, watching the NBA, NFL, UFC, boxing, golf, tennis, and more. As you can imagine, we really enjoyed the Olympics.\nI also like to improve my Spanish conversational skills by calling home, watching videos, and listening to podcasts. I appreciate the progress of being a little more fluent every time I make it back to Panama to visit my mom’s side of the family.\nAn interesting fact about me: During undergrad, I became a collegiate basketball champion when my team won a down-to-the-wire game and brought home the co-ed intramural basketball championship (shoutout to the Big Ballers!).\nWhat I’m looking forward to at Harvard Law School: I’m excited to meet people from places near and far from Virginia, who are leaders in their respective fields and working to improve their communities. I’m looking forward to being challenged to investigate how I think about the world and to being exposed to new perspectives. Ultimately, I’m excited to come away each day with something I can take back home and share with my neighbors.\nEthan Kibbe ’27\nWhere I’m from: Harrison Valley, Pennsylvania — a very small town in north-central PA.\nWhat I was doing before law school: I spent the last 6 years in journalism, working as an anchor and reporter at WICU/WSEE, the NBC and CBS affiliates in Erie, Pennsylvania.\nMy interests and hobbies: I love investigative reporting, running, watching and playing sports, cooking and traveling when possible.\nAn interesting fact about me: Because I grew up on a dairy farm, I can milk a cow by hand.\nWhat I’m looking forward to at Harvard Law School: As simple as it might sound, I’m most looking forward to learning. Spending 6 years out of the classroom has led me to a far greater appreciation of the opportunities that school presents.\nWant to stay up to date with Harvard Law Today?
