  "body_text": "ALBANY, N.Y — In another era, Oregon State women’s basketball would be a year away.\nThe Beavers roster is deep with underclassmen, including a starting lineup that includes two sophomores and a freshman. There isn’t a senior on the team.\nA women’s NCAA Tournament run would be welcome, but not necessarily expected. That’s for next year, when the team is fully mature.\nBut in this era of transfer portal mobility, there’s only one time to strike when the iron is hot: It’s now.\nThere’s no such thing as next year. While the players may say they love their teammates and coaching staff, there’s no certainty of returning next season. Not when name, image and likeness dollars for playing at another school can sometimes be a personal game changer.\nThis is OSU coach Scott Rueck’s fifth Sweet 16 team. The previous four had multiple seniors. His most veteran team was OSU’s 2016 Final Four team, which included five seniors and three juniors.\nThe Beavers team that takes the floor at 11:30 a.m. Friday against Notre Dame in an Albany 1 (New York) Regional semifinal is Rueck’s youngest. The player with the most minutes on the roster this season is freshman guard Donovyn Hunter. Of the eight players to log at least 500 minutes this season, two are freshmen and three are sophomores.\nRueck is philosophical about the challenges a coach faces today versus 10 years ago, saying “it’s just more accurate of life. Are we going to be here tomorrow? Who knows? So, it teaches you to just be grateful in the moment, and to do your best because you’ve prepared in every way.”\nRueck admits things were a bit different eight to 10 years ago, when there was an expectation of recruiting and developing a player over four to five years.\n“If anything, it allowed me the unfortunate opportunity to relax and just take things for granted more,” Rueck said.\nIf the current roster remains intact for next season, Oregon State is a likely preseason top five team. But the Beavers can’t play or think for tomorrow. Young or not, here they’ll come Friday.\nRueck is fine with the current approach.\n“Even back when we had the illusion of control, we actually didn’t,” Rueck said. “This is a very healthy way to live. Do the very best today and manage what comes tomorrow when it comes. You appreciate everything that you do have. I think that’s a good way to live.”\n-- Nick Daschel covers Oregon State athletics, in particular football and basketball, and can be reached at 360-607-4824, ndaschel@oregonian.com or @nickdaschel.\nOur journalism needs your support.
