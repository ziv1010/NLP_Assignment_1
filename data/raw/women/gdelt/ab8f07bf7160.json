  "body_text": "As we close out 2025, we reflect on a year of success and achievement. As always, we also lost some memorable local sports figures.\nIt was another remarkable year in local sports, capped by a rush of high school gold-medal efforts on both the individual and team levels in the fall sports season.\nHere’s a look back at 2025 with some significant dates and storylines that captured our attention and had our readers talking.\nSweet Vic-tory\nDunmore native Vic Fangio dials up a defense that shuts down Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs and enables the Philadelphia Eagles to win Super Bowl LIX, 40-22. Fangio, a longtime defensive coordinator in the NFL, reaches the pinnacle of the sport for the first time.\nHeard it here\nAbington Heights wrestler Brian Heard became District 2’s all-time wins leader, securing his 170th career victory with a 16-0 technical fall over Nazareth’s Elijah Simak in the opening round of the Class 3A Northeast Regional. Heard surpassed Abington Heights’ Evan Craig’s mark of 169, which he set in 2010 for his second straight state title. Heard finished his career with four district titles, two regional titles and two state fifth-place medals.\nHoop of the day\nThe Holy Cross and Valley View boys and Mountain View girls advanced to the PIAA basketball semifinals. Holy Cross defeated District 3 runner-up Lancaster Mennonite, 63-52, in Class 3A; Valley View topped District 4 runner-up Shamokin, 53-46, in Class 4A; and Mountain View dropped District 11 champion Williams Valley, 32-14, in Class 2A. All three teams lost in the semifinals, with Holy Cross losing on a 3-pointer at the buzzer to District 12 champion West Catholic, 58-57.\nYouth movement\nSt. Clare/St. Paul rolled to the state CYO eighth grade boys basketball championship with a 63-23 victory over Our Lady of Peace (Erie) in the title game at Marywood University. The Crusaders (35-0) captured their first state title since 2007. Jimmy Doherty led the way with 25 points, including the 1,000th of his career, Matty Seitzinger added 15 points and Sean Fairweather chipped in 14 points.\nGoin’ West\nClarks Summit native Becky Burke was named the women’s basketball coach at Arizona on April 9. The former Abington Heights and University of Louisville star spent the last three seasons at Buffalo, which culminated with a program-record 30 wins last season and the WNIT championship. She became the 10th head coach in the history of Arizona women’s basketball, replacing Adia Barnes, who left to take the head coaching job at SMU.\nTo the Max\nValley View grad Max Kranick makes the New York Mets’ Opening Day roster. He appeared in 24 games out of the bullpen and was 3-2 with a 3.65 ERA before being placed on the injured list with a right elbow strain in June and undergoing his second career Tommy John surgery in July.\nDippre to the NFL\nLakeland graduate C.J. Dippre signed as an unrestricted free agent with the New England Patriots on April 26. He was released by the team at the end of training camp Aug. 26, but added to the Patriots practice squad the next day. Then Nov. 17, he was elevated to the active roster.\nGiant achievement\nDespite the threat of the school closing, Keystone College baseball clinched its 20th straight conference championship and its second United East title, after defeating Penn State Harrisburg, 6-3, and punched its ticket to the NCAA Division III Tournament with an automatic bid. Andy Rivas had a two-run single and finished with three RBIs in the final to earn United East Tournament MVP.\nA district first\nMorgan Davis scored five goals, Allie Rothenberger added four and Sadie Gilbert chipped in three to lead Abington Heights to a 13-7 win over District 1 third-placer Upper Moreland to become the first District 2 lacrosse team to advance to the state semifinals. The Lady Comets lost to District 1 champion Strath Haven, 17-7, three days later in the PIAA Class 2A semifinals.\nState of success\nTaylor Cawley fired a two-hitter with no walks and 13 strikeouts to lead Valley View to a 6-0 victory over District 3 champion Kennard-Dale in the PIAA Class 4A softball championship game June 12 at Penn State University. A three-run first inning and 14-hit attack by the Cougars supported Cawley. Kalli Karwowski and Ella Swingle each had three hits and Abbi Call added two hits and three RBIs. Cawley and Ashlyn Palickar also contributed two hits for the Cougars (24-2), who closed the season with 13 consecutive wins.\nDiamond dandy\nThe Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Triple-A franchise plays its 5,000th game, a 5-4 loss to Lehigh Valley in the season-opener in Allentown. The RailRiders went 49-26 (87-60 overall) to win the International League second-half title, then lost to the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp, two games to one, in the best-of-3 final. Shelley Duncan earned IL Manager of the Year, and Jose Rojas and Allan Winans were all-stars.\nTricky win\nChase Briscoe saved fuel over the final 30 laps to win the NASCAR Cup Series race at Pocono Raceway, holding off teammate and seven-time Pocono winner Denny Hamlin. It is Briscoe’s first win since joining Joe Gibbs Racing at the start of the season.\nMajor move\nScranton Prep graduate and Misericordia University and University of Virginia product Matt Lanzendorfer is picked in the 15th round of the MLB Draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Pittston native won an NCAA Division III national title with Misericordia before spending a season with Virginia, going 4-2 with a 2.90 ERA in 22 relief appearances and striking out 40 in 31 innings.\nWorth the Wade\nOn Aug. 1, Carbondale native Ed Wade is inducted into the Philadelphia Phillies Hall of Fame, along with former Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Baron Jimmy Rollins. In his tenure as Phillies vice president and general manager from 1998 to 2005, Wade drafted many of the core players part of five NL East winners (2007-11), two NL pennant winners and the 2008 World Series championship team: Ryan Howard, Chase Utley, Cole Hamels, Pat Burrell, Carlos Ruiz and Ryan Madsen. He acquired Shane Victorino and signed Jim Thome. He hired Charlie Manuel as manager when fans were clamoring for Jim Leyland. That helped make him the 50th inductee and sixth executive on the Wall of Fame. In 15 seasons with the Phillies, Rollins became the team’s all-time hits leader with 2,306, a three-time All-Star and the 2007 National League Most Valuable Player.\nScranton shocker\nElizabeth Bennett had 15 points while Dunmore graduate Sophia Talutto had 14 points as the University of Scranton beat NCAA Division I Pittsburgh, 69-63, in a women’s basketball exhibition game Nov. 19 at Petersen Events Center. According to the NCAA, it is the first time a women’s Division III team beat a Division I power conference team. It happened only once in men’s basketball when Ohio Northern beat Oklahoma, 72-69, in 1980.\nBlazing start\nIn a 97-37 opening-night victory over Wyoming Valley West on Nov. 28, Riverside sophomore and basketball star Nico Antoniacci scored a school-record 53 points — all in the first half. He had six 3-pointers and 27 points in the first quarter. He finished 19 for 24 from the field with 10 3-pointers and 5 for 5 from the foul line. Jerry Kincel set the previous mark with 52 points Jan. 17, 2012, in an overtime loss to Holy Cross.\nBest in state\nAbington Heights’ Nick Bradley was named the Gatorade Baseball Player of the Year for Pennsylvania. The Comets went 17-5 and reached the District 2 Class 5A final. The future Auburn University righthander was 9-1 with a 0.71 earned run average and batted .493.\nThe Pennsylvania Soccer Coaches Association named Abington Heights’ Lilia Calvert the girls soccer state player of the year. The Rutgers commit compiled 156 points, including 68 goals and 20 assists to lead the Lady Comets to District 2 Class 3A and Lackawanna League Division I titles and the state quarterfinals. Meanwhile, Abington Heights’ Frank Dyska earned PSCA Class 3A Boys Coach of the Year.\nAlso, Lackawanna Trail’s Isaac Ryon was tabbed the Pennsylvania Football Writers’ Class 1A Player of the Year after etching his name in the LIAA history books. He ran for 2,876 yards to break the single-season record of 2,669 yards set by Honesdale’s Terrin Ash in 1992. Ryon had 49 rushing touchdowns to surpass the record of 44 set in 2013 by Old Forge’s Brandon Yescavage. Ryon had 54 total touchdowns, which also beat the record of 46 set by Yescavage in 2013. He finished his career as Lackawanna Trail’s all-time leading rusher with 4,969 yards, breaking the mark of 4,546 yards held by all-state back Richard Jackson (1998-2000). He also set school records with 82 rushing touchdowns and 89 total touchdowns.\nEnd of an era\nLackawanna College announces that it is leaving the NJCAA ranks for NCAA Division II, becoming a member of the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference. Then, before the end of the football season, Mark Duda reveals he has the early stages of Parkinson’s disease and announces his retirement after 32 years as head coach. Duda is the active leader in wins in NJCAA with 217 against 105 losses. He guided the Falcons to 13 NJCAA bowl appearances, coached 55 NJCAA All-Americans and had a number of players go on to the National Football League such as Bryant McKinnie, Mark Glowinski, Kevin White, Jermaine Eluemunor, Jaquan Brisker and Ji’Ayir Brown.\nFranklin downfall\nWhat began as a season of promise for Penn State football, fell apart quickly. The Nittany Lions opened the season ranked No. 2 in the Associated Press Top 25 Poll after advancing to the College Football Playoff last season, but lost in overtime to Oregon, and then suffered back-to-back losses to heavy underdogs UCLA and Northwestern, costing head coach James Franklin his job after 12 seasons.\nWhat followed was a nearly two-month search for a head coach that came with several candidates falling through and signing extensions with their current schools.\nPenn State eventually hired Iowa State head coach Matt Campell on Dec. 11 to replace Franklin, who went 104-45 in his 12 seasons, including six 10-win seasons in the last nine years, and six trips to New Year’s Day Six bowl games. However, Franklin was 5-21 against Top 10 teams in his time in Happy Valley, including eight straight losses to Ohio State, which ultimately contributed to him losing his job.\nFranklin landed on his feet, being hired as Virginia Tech head coach on Nov. 18.\nCollege carousel\nIt’s been a whirlwind year for lineman Tavian Branch. The Riverside football standout committed to Rutgers on June 11 before decommitting Aug. 29. Then, he committed to Penn State on Sept. 6, and 12 days later Nittany Lions coach James Franklin helicoptered to Montrose to see Branch play. After Franklin was fired Oct. 12 a day after the Nittany Lions lost to Northwestern, Branch reopened his recruitment Oct. 13 and decommitted from Penn State on Nov. 13. On Dec. 3, he committed to Auburn.\nAwesome autumn\nLackawanna League players and teams secured a monster fall sports PIAA postseason.\n— On Oct. 22, Scranton Prep golf repeated as Class 2A team champion with a record score of 6-under 282 on the Penn State White Course. Brendan Bell shot a 4-under 68, with four birdies and 14 pars, Cole Powell shot 2-under 70, Ben Boyanoski carded a 1-under 71 and Guy Rothery added a 1-over 73 as the Cavaliers topped Peters Twp.’s mark of 284 set in 2023.

Riverside’s Mikey Schimelfenig was seventh in 16:38.\n— On Nov. 15, Joey Pivirotto scored the first goal and Nico Bustos put the game away with a header off a free kick from James Mitchell, as Abington Heights captured the PIAA Class 3A boys soccer title with a 2-0 victory over District 3 champion Conrad Weiser. Goalkeeper Billy Johnson had eight saves to secure his 18th clean sheet of the season, as the Comets became the first District 2 boys state champion since Mountain View captured the Class 1A crown in 2012. The Comets outscored their opponents, 134-9, this season and, 31-0, in seven postseason games.\nIn memoriam\nBob Simons, who coached golf for 54 seasons at Wallenpaupack and became the winningest high school golf coach in Pennsylvania, died April 20 at 77.

Hemans was one of the most talented players in the history of the Eastern Professional Basketball League. He spent 13 years in the league and played for five teams, including the Hazleton Hawks (1956-60) and Scranton Miners (1962-68). The graceful 6-foot-7 forward is considered one of the all-time scoring and rebounding leaders in league history.
