I got all over the world, met some great friends, and served alongside some really inspirational people. And I'm just glad to have a moment to share some time with fellow veterans, and I'm glad the Town of Cary is putting this on,\" said Svolto.\nHis grandfather, father, and brother all served in the military.\n\"I learned this sense of service and the value of giving back and giving to your country from the example that my father set and my grandfather. It's just great to sort of revisit that time to time, and certainly events like these help you do that,\" Svolto explained.\nHe discussed the importance of providing support for veterans as they reintegrate back into civilian life.\n\"First of all, naming it and creating a space for it is tremendously important. I think it sends a really strong signal to to veterans across the country, not just here in Raleigh or here in Cary, that the community cares and that there's a role for leaders within local government, within the state government, and certainly within industry to create space and also to value the experiences that our veterans have. I certainly think it's important for us to talk about those challenges, because the more that we do so, the more we free and open up everyone to seek out the resources and support that will be helpful to them to live fulfilled lives and to contribute and continue serving their communities,\" said Svolto.\nOver at NC State, a large crowd gathered for the annual early morning run from the Memorial Belltower.\n\"Looking out in the crowd today, I just saw so many young people that have answered the call to serve. So it just makes me feel great that everything that I sacrificed for is still being in the hands of the young people today,\" said Retired Master Gunnery Sergeant Travis Johnson, who served as the keynote speaker.\nIn Apex, Mayor Jacques Gilbert delivered an address highlighting the sacrifice of service members.\n\"Our veterans continue to stand strong despite the conditions. Every hardship, every challenge, they did it with courage, discipline and love for this country. And because of that we have the privilege to stand here today in peace, surrounded by family, friends, and neighbors,\" said Gilbert.\nIn Garner, about 250 people attended a gathering at Aversboro Road Baptist Church, as town residents and World War II veterans were recognized for their attendance.\nUNC also unveiled an installation inside the Kenan Football Center Hall of Honor on Tuesday, with Bill Belichick beginning is press conference on Tuesday discussing former student-athletes and coaches' connections to the military.\n\"This program dates back to 1888, certainly. Along the way, we've had so many people in the program that have served for us. It's very proud to be part of that. We have many military people here and in the university program, two on our staff, (Assistant Director of Sports Performance) Trent Baker and (Special Teams Coordinator) Mike Priefer, who both served and we're very proud to have them,\" said Belichick.\nBelichick was joined by UNC Chancellor Lee Roberts, veterans, and active military members to unveil a wall of 61 former Tar Heels who served in the military. Belichick stressed the wall was a work in progress, noting his dad Steve, who served in the Navy during World War II and later worked at UNC as an assistant coach, has not been added.\n\"My dad played for the Detroit Lions in 1941, and that was his rookie year. And then Pearl Harbor, December 7th (1941), so he enlisted in the Navy,\" said Belichick.\nBelichick shared that he initially discussed ways to honor veterans with Roberts.\n\"Very proud to be part of this. Very proud to continue to hear from people who were at North Carolina and the football program that served our country and recognize them. And that's something that we've spent time working with our players on this week,\" Belichick explained.\nBelichick has long expressed an affinity for the military, namely the Navy, due to his dad's connection. Steve Belichick would work for the school's football team for over three decades. He discussed his dad's service, as well as the impact of World War II on the growth of football, during a four-minute answer to end his press conference.\nCopyright © 2026 WTVD-TV.
