It is estimated the build will take about 12 months.\nThe new site, known as Delacombe Village, sits south of the current shopping complex, on the other side of Valiant Road behind the first stage of shops, which opened in September 2017.\nDevelopers Troon Group will also build a new 98-place childcare centre within the village, which is currently being offered for lease.\nDelacombe Saleyards\nRemediation works have begun at Delacombe's historic former saleyards but the future of the site is still unclear.\nAfter sitting empty since the saleyards moved to a newly-built site at Miners Rest in 2018, works began in November to remove contaminated soil and building materials to make the ground safe to build on.\nIn August 2024, the state government committed to remediate the site and develop it into a jobs and housing precinct.\nCouncil will soon begin community consultation on the future of the 13.6 hectare area, with a draft Precinct Structure Plan (PSP) expected to be released in 2027.\nBallarat Base Hospital redevelopment\nFour large tower cranes now dominate the western end of the city skyline as works on the seven-storey clinical services tower power along at Ballarat Base Hospital.\nThree cranes are named after volunteers and staff at the hospital - Josie Ashmore, Associate Professor Wasek Faisal and brothers Ashton Kline and Grant Monks - while the fourth displays a large 'thank you' to recognise the patience and understanding of hospital staff, patients, the community and construction workers.\nDuring 2026 the clinical services tower will rise from the site, with the final basement slabs on the ground already poured and the vertical concrete structure begun.\nOnce complete in 2027, the new hospital tower will feature a new main entrance off Sturt Street, a new emergency department, 100 extra inpatient and short-stay beds, a new state-of-the-art theatre suite, a new and expanded women and children's hub, a new and expanded critical care floor and a helipad on the roof.\nThe $655 million redevelopment has already seen construction of a new Central Energy Plant and Support Services building completed, and an extension of the car park to provide double the number of spaces.\nYPARC\nConstruction of the $10 million Youth Prevention and Recovery Care Centre for mental health in Newington is scheduled for completion in early 2026.\nGrampians teens aged 16 to 18 needing inpatient mental healthcare currently need to be admitted to the Royal Children's Hospital. When the 10-bed YPARC opens next year they will be able to stay closer to home and their support networks for treatment.\nThe first sod was turned, marking the start of construction, in February with the completion date expected in the first half of the year.\nThe YPARC will cater for people aged 16 to 25.\nThe YPARC will feature a home-like environment with 10 private bedrooms with ensuites, communal kitchens, dining and living areas, breakout spaces and an outdoor garden.\nBallarat Station\nBallarat Station's controversial new overpass was lifted into place in November, another piece in the $51 million jigsaw of improving accessibility at the historic transport hub.\nThe overpass, which contains lift access, will connect the station's two platforms and allow people to move around the station more easily, avoiding the need for people with mobility issues to leave the station and cross at the level crossing to move between platforms.\nOther works as part of the station upgrade include a new ramp, stairs and lighting improvements for the northern entry to the station near the multi-storey car park.\nThe project is scheduled for completion in 2026.\nGeorge Weston Foods Flour Mill\nRising from the rear of BWEZ, adjacent to the railway line, a seven-storey building is changing the western landscape of Ballarat.\nIt is the new $132.9m flour mill for food manufacturing company George Weston Foods which replaces its historic existing mill in North Melbourne.\nWhen construction is complete, expected in the first half of 2026, it will undergo a process of machinery installation and preparation for operational readiness.\nThe facility will create 174 new jobs, including the transfer of 46 jobs from North Melbourne to Ballarat, and bring in grain from northern and central Victoria to supply the company's operations across the state.\nArt Gallery of Ballarat upgrades\nThe doors of the Art Gallery of Ballarat have been closed since March for a $5.5 million project to replace and upgrade the gallery's heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system so conditions are optimal to exhibit and store art.\nThe works are vital to secure the gallery's future, to ensure it can attract exhibitions from around the world and to protect and maintain the gallery's 12,000-piece collection.\nIncluded in the project is an upgrade to the interior walls which will allow artworks to be attached directly to the wall meaning more works can be displayed. Both lifts on site will also be refurbished and the building's switchboard and generator upgraded.\nDuring the gallery's closure, which are expected to be complete during 2026, a separately-funded upgrade of the gallery's skylights to energy-efficient LED panels will also take place.\nDuring the closure, some artworks have been packed away for storage, others on loan to regional and state galleries and the Backspace Gallery has opened at 43 Mair Street.\nSocial Housing\nThe first of the 181 new social housing homes at Leawarra Crescent in Delacombe are expected to be completed during 2026 after ground was broken on the project in December, 2025.\nThe massive rejuvenation project was first announced in 2021 and the original 66 residents of Leawarra Cres and surrounding streets were moved out of their existing homes.\nThe 1970s homes, many deemed no longer fit for purpose, were demolished to make way for 117 social and 64 affordable homes, mostly townhouses.\nThe new homes will be a mix of one, two and three-bedroom properties to help best cater to the region's social housing demand.\nBut the land has sat empty since.\nMinister for Housing and Building Harriet Shing, while visiting the site in December, 2025, said the new homes would be completed in stages from 2026 to 2028. Previous residents will be able to move back if they choose.\nThe Delacombe development comes alongside the delivery of 439 new social and affordable homes across Ballarat and the Central Highlands including 15 homes under construction in Canadian, 30 in Mitchell Park, 24 in Ballarat and a further 34 to be built across the Central Highlands - most of which will be move-in-ready in 2026.\nEastwood Leisure Complex\nOne of the city's most diverse community facilities will be largely demolished and rebuilt in a $17 million project to provide a modern, purpose-built venue for community groups.\nThe sprawling Eastwood Leisure Complex in Ballarat Central has evolved over the past 80 years since it began during 1945 as the Ballarat Youth Centre to support young people transitioning to peacetime life after World War II.\nBuildings were donated from the Red Cross from a military hospital at Victoria Park that were used by American Marines who passed through there. Over the decades there have been various upgrades and additions and an ever-expanding number of community groups and programs have been based at the site.\nThe existing complex has been deemed not fit for purpose, with parts of the building not fully accessible and not compliant with current regulations.\nWhen it closed recently, it was hosting 60,000 visits a year, 67 regular user groups and more than 100 organisations and clubs who used the centre.\nThe new Eastwood Leisure Complex will provide a modern, purpose-built venue for community groups and expected to be complete in early to mid 2027.\nBallarat-Carngham Road Coles complex\nOriginally planned to open in mid-2025, then early 2026, there has been no movement or construction on the long-awaited shopping complex at the Alluvium estate on Ballarat-Carngham Road in Winter Valley.\nPlans for the complex show a Coles supermarket as an anchor tenant with a range of different businesses alongside a pharmacy, petrol station, gym, medical centre and various retail and food and beverage businesses.\nThe centre will become part of the Alluvium Estate, which is located on the south side of Ballarat-Carngham Road, between Wiltshire Lane and Dyson Drive.\nLearmonth Road shopping complex\nConstruction should be complete by mid-year on Wendouree's newest retail precinct, a large-format retail hub on Learmonth Road.\nArtwork from leasing agents CBRE show Nick Scali, Amart and Pillow Talk among the new tenants of the shopping centre, which occupies land at 121A Learmonth Road between the Eureka Home Maker Centre and Caravan Street.\nEarthworks began in March for the complex, which will house showrooms and retail outlets from 1000sm to 2700sqm along with 362 car parks.\nTenants are expected to include a mix of furniture, homewares, automotive, haberdashery, leisure, retail and similar retailers.\nCity Oval Grandstand\nChangerooms at the historic City Oval grandstand are being refurbished and upgraded to bring them up to modern standards and cater for female users.\nThe $2.5 million works will see extensive renovations of the existing change rooms, including replacing the current wooden floor, which is in poor condition and does not meet modern building standards.\nTo help expand the changerooms, pods will be built at the rear of the existing change rooms and accessed through a connecting link.\nThe identical rooms, each with a floor area of about 34 square metres, will contain three toilets, basins and three showers. Construction is scheduled for completion mid-way through the 2026 football season.\nWorks will also be carried out to rectify structural issues to ensure the longevity of the grandstand, which was built in 1898.\nThe project is the first part of a major renovation of the venue, with a masterplan expected to be finalised and put out for public consultation within months.",
