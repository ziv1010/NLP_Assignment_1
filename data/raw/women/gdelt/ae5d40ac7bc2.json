He's football through and through.'\nOn one point during the match, Giggs rests his head on his hand as he watches Salford's performance - a day after being cleared of domestic violence\nThe charges against the ex-Manchester United footballer, 49, were withdrawn by the Crown Prosecution Service at a hearing at Manchester Crown Court\nGiggs had pleaded not guilty to controlling or coercive behaviour over a three-year period towards his ex-girlfriend Kate Greville (pictured), 38, between August 2017 and November 2020\n'It is my intention to resume my managerial career at a later date,' Giggs told fans in a statement issued in the run up to his trial last July.\nWhile his barrister added this week his client was 'looking forward to rebuilding his life and career as an innocent man'.\nBut in what capacity Giggs will work in football again is a question the sport's administrators now find themselves facing.\nBecause while he may have emerged from the protracted proceedings without a criminal record, the details that emerged during his trial about his compulsive cheating and vile behaviour towards ex-girlfriend Kate Greville only served to inflict further damage to his already tarnished reputation.\nAt its root is the way Giggs treats women, a problem which, at a time when the sport that made him famous is finally and fully embracing their place in the game, can no longer be simply shrugged off.\nGiving evidence at Manchester Crown Court Giggs admitted to being a liar, a serial cheat and a 'jealous bully' who sent vile, abusive and often foul-mouthed messages to Miss Greville.\nThe court also heard how he had affairs with at least eight other women while they were together.\nBut the truth is that even as that tribute was being penned back in 2010, Giggs' actions were already making a mockery of Fergie's judgement.\nBecause just months later he would be exposed for what he really was, after details of an affair with his younger brother Rhodri's wife Natasha were revealed by The News of the World. The details were excruciating.\nRyan Giggs stepped down as Wales manager last year after being charged with assaulting his ex-girlfriend Kate Greville. He was subsequently cleared of the charges in court\nGiggs began a relationship with PR girl Kate Greville (pictured) in 2017 but their relationship soured and she accused him of cheating on her with eight women\nGiggs repeatedly cheated on his ex-wife Stacey during their marriage, including with his brother's wife, Natasha. Pictured: Ryan and Stacey Giggs at the GQ Men of the Year awards in 2010\nThe footballer spent £150,000 on an injunction in a bid to keep his affair with Imogen Thomas (pictured) a secret\nThe affair started while Giggs' wife-to-be Stacey was pregnant with their first child and continued for eight years. In 2010, two weeks prior to Natasha and Rhodri getting married, Natasha fell pregnant with Giggs' child. She aborted the baby after the star delivered £500 in cash on his bicycle as a contribution to the cost.\nAt the same time he was sleeping with Big Brother star Imogen Thomas, later spending £150,000 on a super-injunction in a bid to keep the relationship secret.\nWhile the revelations about these infidelities obviously tainted Giggs' reputation, incredibly they didn't stop Manchester United making him their temporary manager in 2014.\nAnd nor did it subsequently stop the Welsh Football Association putting him in charge of the national side in 2018.\nThe world now knows that while holding that position – 'an honour and a privilege' as he described it – Giggs wasn't exclusively focused on football. Rather, on juggling his myriad lovers to satisfy his insatiable sex drive while at the same time toying with the emotions of anyone who got close to him.\nBut as his own barrister told the court, being a cheat, a womaniser, a liar and an adulterer isn't a crime. And, ultimately, the jury was unable to reach verdicts on the charges of assault and controlling behaviour that he faced.\nThe former footballer insisted he had never been violent to any woman, or used coercive or controlling behaviour against them. His barrister, Chris Daw KC, said the allegations were based on 'distortion, exaggeration and lies'.\nJurors had failed to reach a verdict following an original, 11-day trial last year, after 22 hours and 59 minutes' deliberations. A retrial had been scheduled to begin on July 31.\nRyan Giggs runs with the ball for Manchester United in a Champions League semi-final against Schalke 04 in April 2011\nGiggs began an eight-year affair with his brother's girlfriend Natasha while his wife Stacey (pictured) was pregnant with his first child\nDuring a short pre-trial review hearing at Manchester Crown Court on Tuesday morning, Peter Wright KC, prosecuting, said the original trial over the alleged assault at Giggs' home in November 2020 was 'a process that has taken its toll' on PR consultant Ms Greville and her sister.\nHe said Ms Greville had 'indicated an unwillingness' to give evidence in a re-trial as doing so in the first had 'taken its toll' on her and her sister.\nMr Wright said: 'This is not a decision taken lightly.'\nHe said there was no realistic prospect of conviction on count one, that of coercive and controlling behaviour, and it was no longer in the public interest to proceed to prosecute on the other charges of assault on Ms Greville and her sister.\nHe added: 'That being the case, we formally offer no evidence on counts one, two and three.'\nJudge Hilary Manley replied: 'I formally enter not guilty verdicts in respect of those counts.'\nRyan Giggs girlfriend Zara Charles popped out for a take away pizza just hours before the case against him collapsed\nDuring Giggs's time at Old Trafford, Manchester United won 13 Premier League titles, two Champions League trophies, four FA Cups and three League Cups. (Pictured: Giggs in 2004 after scoring for Manchester United against Spurs)\nGiggs' barrister, Chris Daw KC (pictured), said allegations against him were based on 'distortion, exaggeration and lies'\nThe court heard that for more than a month, until June 29, Ms Greville, who has a new partner and a baby, refused to 'engage' with the investigating officer in the case, although eventually he was able to make contact and request she provide a doctor's note to outline her exact health problems.\nMr Wright said a decision on whether to continue with the case was being considered at the highest level of the Crown Prosecution Service, adding that, when it came to allegations of coercive and controlling behaviour by allegedly abusive men, the 'wearing down of a complainant is not to be interpreted by the public and by men as a passport to an acquittal.'\nIn a statement this week, a CPS spokesperson said: 'Following a recent change in circumstances in this case we have determined our legal test is no longer met.\n'We have determined there is no longer sufficient evidence available to proceed in respect of the controlling or coercive behaviour charge and that it is no longer in the public interest to prosecute the remaining assault charges.\n'This decision was made following detailed discussions with Greater Manchester Police and consultation with the complainants.'\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying",
