  "body_text": "The National Women’s Soccer League said in a statement on Thursday that Houston Dash goalkeeping coach Matthew Lampson has been dismissed by the team for violation of NWSL’s anti-fraternization policy and coach code of conduct. The league has also suspended Lampson from future employment in the league for the rest of the 2024 season as a result of the violations due to a “lack of full cooperation” in the investigation.\nThe statement from NWSL stated that Lampson, 31, was fired on March 18 following an investigation that “examined third-party reports of Lampson crossing professional boundaries with a Dash player” It also said that the results found him to be in violation of regulations that “require coaches to maintain strict adherence to professional boundaries.” The Athletic reports that the NWSL confirmed that while Lampson was fired for violating the league’s anti-fraternization policy, it “did not find a violation of the NWSL Anti-Harassment Policy which is focused on preventing abusive, discriminatory, or harassing behavior.”\nAccording to a report from Theodore Lloyd-Hughes of The Equalizer, the Dash organization said: “Houston Dash goalkeeper coach Matt Lampson was terminated on March 18. We respect the privacy and confidentiality of our players and employees and will not comment on specific details of Club employment matters.”\nLampson made 51 appearances in MLS for the Columbus Crew, Chicago Fire, Minnesota United and LA Galaxy from 2012-2020. Following his playing career, Lampson served as a volunteer assistant goalkeeper coach for his alma mater, Ohio State, as well as Ohio Dominican University. He joined the Houston Dash as their goalkeepers coach in March 2022.\nEditorial credit: EstetStudio / Shutterstock.com\nLeave a Reply\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.",
