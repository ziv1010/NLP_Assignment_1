But who is Bompastor and why did the Blues choose her to replace Hayes?\nSonia Bompastor’s journey to Chelsea\nBefore becoming one of the best young managers in Europe, Bompastor was a world class player in her own right.\nA midfielder who was equally comfortable in defence, she remains one of the best women’s players in French history.\nWinning 156 caps for her national side over a 13-year spell, Bompastor had spells at La Roche-sur-Yon, Montpellier, Washington Freedom and Paris St-Germain.\nBut it was Lyon where she really left her mark, in two separate spells Bompastor won a remarkable 11 major trophies – including back-to-back Champions League titles in 2011 and 2012.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nWhen she called time on playing in 2013, Bompastor initially stayed at the French champions as director of the women’s academy, a role she held for eight years.\nIn 2021, Lyon appointed her first team manager with her stock rising dramatically. In her first year in the job, the team produced an invincible season to win the league whilst also beating Barcelona 3-1 in the Champions League final to claim a record eighth European Cup.\nVIDEO How will Lauren James Change Women's Football Forever\nBompastor delivered two further French titles and a domestic cup over the next two seasons before deciding it was time for a new challenge.\nHer final game in charge before making the move to Chelsea had the potential to deliver a fairytale outcome - the 2024 Champions League final in Bilbao. Sadly for the French coach, it wasn’t to be, her side losing 2-0 to the great Barcelona.\nBy that time a move to Stamford Bridge was all but confirmed. Bompastor’s task of matching , or even surpassing the achievements of, Emma Hayes may appear daunting\nBut the French coach has the experience, tactical shrewdness and player-management skills to keep the WSL title with Chelsea this season and go one step further?\nJack has worked as a sports reporter full-time since 2021.
