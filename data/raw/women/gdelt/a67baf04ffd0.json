  "body_text": "Newcastle United 2025 January transfer window – Focus now turns to this\nHere we are again, the Newcastle United 2025 January transfer window looms, with much at stake.\nAfter a summer of perceived relative failure, what can we expect?\nIn the days of PSR, a starting point is our financial situation.\nBy way of reminder, the financial years that count are of course the current season, last season and the season before. We are allowed a £105 million loss over the three years. The only concrete figures available showed an operating loss of £66.5 million. On the bright side, this season replaces a loss of £71.7 million.\nThe summer sales of Anderson and Minteh means that we are likely to have made a profit in the financial year for last season, pure profit on the suggested £35 million sale of Anderson, no doubt with some sell on clauses for Minteh since the sales were completed before the end of that financial year.\nWe do not know for sure what allowances have been made for investment in infrastructure, the academy and women’s football. We know that revenues have increased since the Ashley days, from £180 million at the end of the Ashley era to £250 million the following year and with Champions League qualification, possibly over £300 million last season. The Adidas and other new commercial activity should mean that is sustained.\nIn short, the pursuit of Guehi in the summer indicates that there are funds available, on top of the completed transfers of Osula (amortisation of £3 million per year), Hall (£6 million) and Vlachodimos (£4 million).\nElsewhere, contracts have been extended for Joelinton and Bruno, along with others, their pay rises presumably covered by being able to amortise contracts over a longer period. Wages have been saved with the departures of the likes of Dummett and Ritchie.\nWith a full squad of 25 senior players, along with the likes of Under 21s such as Hall and Miley, it is clearly desirable to cull the squad in some areas. Any transfer fees gained add to the kitty, of course allowing for “loyalty” bonuses to be paid to departing players. On the flipside, agents’ fees and signing on payments provide some restrictions.\nThe club have highlighted the desire to reduce the average age of the squad. To that end, rumours surrounding the likes of Trippier, Almiron and Dubravka might hold water, similarly, Longstaff’s name has been thrown into the hat, the latter being homegrown, therefore a potential source of significant profit. Even those like Barnes or Willock, whose playing time has been limited, seem realistic options. Could Wilson pass a medical?\nAlso on the periphery, with five senior goalkeepers on the books, the squad as a whole could be argued to lack balance. In the same vein, long-term injuries have reduced defensive cover in the first half of the season. When will Botman or Lascelles be available? An injury to Isak could be crucial. The form of Jacob Murphy has papered over a crack.\nThat brings us to a key strategic decision for the powers that be.\nJanuary can be a tough window but flying high in the league, with Spurs and Man U struggling to make the top half of the table in a tight league, can Newcastle United afford to risk a big push for the Champions League again?\nOptimistic supporters will say yes, even that we have to grasp the nettle while we can. The new look Champions League format would be better for us than the group of death.\nIn the background, Paul Mitchell has stated his aim to explore wider international markets. From the coaching point of view, Eddie Howe will be keen for talent from the Premier League to get us through the current campaign.\nWith all five keepers aged between 31 and 37 at the end of the season (Vlachodimos being the youngest by a clear two years), it would be no surprise if the boat were to be pushed out to land someone like Trafford from Burnley, do they need to sell\nElsewhere in defence, Kelly is yet to make his mark, Botman to return and some international talent with Premier League experience is available.\nThe absolute imperative is a right sided attacker.\nWith Forest riding high, last summer’s rumoured target, Elanga, would require a premium price. Brentford’s Mbeuno proved his worth against us in the league, whilst Brentford’s business model is geared to making profit on players who they have identified and traded. What about the Bournemouth connection for Semenyo? Do we have a buy back clause for Minteh? Could we take a risk from a less competitive league for someone like Bakayoko?\nUp front could be the most intriguing element.\nNUFC are reported to have a long standing interest in Calvert-Lewin from Everton who only has six months remaining on his contract, another club with its own new owners and its own PSR issues. The striker has not had the sort of service he might expect at NUFC. There are a few characters on Tyneside who have experience at pursuing the safety route, the Evertonians surely seeking to start life in their new stadium in the Premier League.\nAfter a summer which saw a relative lack of activity, we can expect to see more in January. There will be options all over the field, with those obvious priorities and perhaps intriguing opportunities.\nMitchell has a point or few to make, both in buying and selling. Ultimately, what can be afforded is down to his sales skills. He and his predecessor, the man kicked out of Man U, may be set to compete at the Chelsea Flower Show, Ashworth previously at our expense, Mitchell previously at Monaco’s.\nThere are so many possibilities. Everything is geared for a gamble. A five game (four in the league) winning run, including against Man U in the last match of the year, with some great chances to progress, Chelsea with their own stutters.\nWe want the chance to advance. Will Newcastle United follow suit?\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
