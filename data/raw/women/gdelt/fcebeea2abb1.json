  "body_text": "Man Utd in contact with PSV star Esmee Brugts\nEsmee Brugts could soon become Manchester United's newest reinforcement ahead of the 2023/24 campaign, 90min understands.\nThe player's contract with PSV Vrouwen expires at the end of this season, allowing her to move to another team on a free transfer. Sources close to 90min understand that the Red Devils have made contact with Brugts over a potential move, but no decision has yet been made.\nSeveral other teams have also expressed interest in signing the Dutch talent, including Manchester City, but she has her sights set on playing Champions League football. United have already secured a minimum second place finish in England's WSL to qualify for the first time, while City look all but certain to miss on the competition for the first time since 2015.\nUnited are hoping to strengthen their squad ahead of their maiden European adventure, with manager Marc Skinner teasing last weekend: \"We're going in for very good players.\"\nBrugts initially kicked off professionally with FC Binnenmaas, working through the academy for eight years before signing her first contract with PSV in 2020 at just 16. She adapted quickly, scoring three goals in 13 games throughout her first campaign with the team.\nAfter almost three years with the club, Brugts made history and broke records. Overall, she’s managed 17 goals and seven assists in 58 games in all competitions to inspire PSV Vrouwen to lift the KNVB Cup in 2021 and constantly place in the top four of the Eredivisie.\nRead the latest Man Utd Women news here\nBrugts’ continued success with PSV drove her to the Dutch national team, receiving several call ups before debuting in 2022 against Brazil during the Tournoi de France.\nDespite the intense competition for a place in the roster, she was never one to shy away from a challenge. The forward used her creativity and versatility in the final third to compete among the best in Dutch football, and secure her place on the pitch.\nHer defining moment with the national team came on 6 September 2022 in the decisive FIFA World Cup qualifier against Iceland. Brugts came off the bench in the 66th minute, replacing Renate Jansen. In the third minute of added time, she connected with teammate Kerstin Casparij to send the ball into the back of the net for the lone, game-winning goal.\nHaving already been to UEFA Euro 2022 last summer, now she’s looking forward to representing the Netherlands in the game’s biggest stage of all.",
