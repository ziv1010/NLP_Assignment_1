  "body_text": "Gabby Logan says 'there's constant arguments' in honest family confession\nBBC presenter Gabby Logan shared an insight into her family life as she revealed how she has \"constant arguments\" with one family member\nPresenter Gabby Logan has opened up about her life at home with former rugby star Kenny Logan, admitting \"there's constant arguments.\"\nHaving met purely by chance, Gabby has previously recalled how she met Kenny while drinking in a bar in Chelsea, London, with friends.\nAfter Kenny finally plucked up the courage to go over and speak to the sports presenter, Gabby told the Table Manners with Jessie and Lennie Ware podcast that her husband got her name wrong when later speaking to his friends—saying he referred to her as another famous presenter, Gabby Roslin.\nHowever, after making their relationship official, Gabby walked down the aisle in 2001. In 2005, the couple welcomed their twins, Lois and Reuben into the world.\nSharing an insight into her life at home with Kenny, she recently told the Proper Tasty with Tom Kerridge and Chris Stark podcast that their competitive nature often sees them end up \"arguing.\"\nRevealing how they often fail to see eye to eye when it comes to household chores such as unstacking the dishwasher, she told Tom: \"There's constant arguments about that, obviously.\"\nLooking back on one particular occasion when their competitive spirit was on full display, she recalled how a game of family rounders didn't exactly go according to plan, saying there was confusion over the number of balls they were using.\nRecalling the moment she \"lost it,\" she said: \"I said third ball, and Kenny went, 'No, playing two balls, there's too many people to go.' And I absolutely lost it.\"\nShe added: \"And my niece and nephew, who were about eight and nine at the time, were watching their aunty go, 'No, no, no, when did we change the rules?'\"\nAway from her home life, Gabby’s career has gone from strength to strength in recent months, after she was announced as one-third of a new presenting trio set to replace Gary Lineker on Match of the Day.\nDue to begin their roles at the start of the new football season in August, Gabby, Mark Chapman, and Kelly Cates are also set to present Match of the Day 2 and MOTD: Champions League.\nMore recently, Gabby has been part of the BBC's presenting team, and she is next set to appear on our screens as part of the coverage of the 2025 Women's European Championships, presenting tonight’s Finland v Switzerland match.",
