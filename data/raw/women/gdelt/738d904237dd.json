An ensuing 23-yard tying attempt by Maya Turner hit the left upright and dropped short.\n“I’m proud of the way the kids played,” said head coach Stan Pierre, who did not take solace in going 4-4 and reaching the playoffs in his first season as the program’s bench boss. “We were really trying to win the game, and there’s no second place. I’ve been through so many things at this level in football… and as I continue forward as a coach, I really, really do hope the kids get to experience some of those things.”\nThe Rams will play the Saskatchewan Huskies for the Hardy Trophy for the second year in a row on Nov. 8.\n“This is another opportunity gone for a lot of those kids,” Pierre said, “and for some of them, it’s forever, because their careers are done. It’s never an easy thing, but this is why we tell everybody, why our game is so great, and why it teaches our young men and women so much — because this is part of it.\n“There’s nothing great about being successful without going through the trials and tribulations that go with it. I love competition, and I hope my kids love competition. If it’s easy, it’s not fun.”\nQuarterback Jackson Tachinski, named a Canada West all-star for the second year in a row — the first time a pivot has accomplished the feat since 2001-02 — is one of those players who will not return next season. The fifth-year signal-caller completed 21 of 35 passes for 297 yards, with two touchdowns and one interception. Tachinski also rushed for a touchdown.\nOffensive lineman Matt Stokman, defensive lineman Jerome Fouillard, defensive back Marcus Wahl and linebacker Nic Pereira were the other Bisons named to the all-star team.\nNathan Udoh, who caught both of Tachinski’s touchdown passes, led the receiving attack with four receptions for 68 yards on a night eight different Bisons recorded a catch.\nManitoba was in the driver’s seat after Turner made good on a 16-yard go-ahead field goal attempt — one of her three makes on the day — with 30 seconds remaining in regulation. On the ensuing kickoff, however, Turner’s angled boot illegally rolled out of bounds, setting the Rams up with prime field position. Four plays later, Gorniak connected on a 35-yard kick as time expired.\nThe kickers exchanged field goals on each team’s opening possession in overtime.\n“She has a range that she’s trying to kick the ball in every time she kicks it off,” Pierre said. “Her first kickoff of the game was in the middle of the field, which they almost scored on, so she knows that she has to place the ball in a certain spot on the field, and she’s trying her best to do that.\n“You know, that’s the way it goes. That’s sports. Sometimes, when you’re trying your best and you make a mistake, that’s what happens. But I sure want them trying their best and having things happen that way, as opposed to just hoping for the best.”\nThe Bisons and the Rams boast two of the top rushing attacks in the conference this season, and both were on display. Bisons’ fifth-year running back Breydon Stubbs rumbled for 96 yards on 22 carries, while Tachinski added 34 yards on three carries.\nHowever, both were outdone by Rams rusher Marshall Erichsen, who was the focal point of the offence, logging 13 carries for 96 yards and a touchdown, and adding 58 yards on seven receptions.\n“We certainly struggled early, and we were able to make some more plays,” Pierre said. “I don’t think you’re ever pleased with that stat line. I think we probably thought we were better than that, but we minimized the chunk plays, which is the most important thing.\n“It all evens out in the end. Sure, I wish we would have done better, but they’re pretty good too.”\nThe highly competitive game featured 862 yards of total offence and five lead changes.\nIt’s the second year in a row the Bisons were eliminated by the Rams in the Canada West semifinal. Though this one stung, Pierre said it’s something he hopes his team can build on.\n“Hopefully,” he said. “On my business, it’s always right back to the drawing board.
