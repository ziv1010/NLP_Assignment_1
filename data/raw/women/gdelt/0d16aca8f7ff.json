Last week's squad announcement followed the retirements of Mary Earps and Fran Kirby, and Millie Bright's withdrawal from selection.\n'This group is a very well-balanced mix of players with multiple tournaments on their CVs and also those that will make their tournament debuts. I am excited to see what we are capable of this summer,' the England manager told Sky News.\n'At the same time, I do feel for those that have just missed out. I can only name 23, but there are more players who have been so important to us on our journey to Switzerland. We would not be here without them.'\nMost of the team will meet at training base St George's Park from 16 June, but the US-based players – Anna Moorhouse, Jess Carter and Esme Morgan – will join on 23 June.
