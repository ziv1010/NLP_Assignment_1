But there’s still football on today — Tottenham Hotspur Women travel to face Brighton & Hove Albion Women at the AmEx Stadium today.\nBrighton Women vs. Spurs Women: match thread and how to watch\nTottenham are hoping to capitalize on two straight wins and some good form.\nSpurs Women have had a pretty great week. They rebounded from a narrow (but still promising) opening week loss at Chelsea by defeating Bristol City in the league before pounding Championship side Reading 6-0 in the Continental Cup group stage. Today they travel to face a Brighton Women side that split its opening two league matches — defeating Everton before losing to West Ham last weekend.\nRobert Vilahamn has started with the same lineup in each of Spurs’ first two league matches but rotated heavily for the Cup. With three games in eight days, will he go back to his preferred XI or mix things up a bit? Will there be any aggressive subbing? We’ll find out!\nThe match is not televised but is available for (free) streaming on The FA Player.\nLineups\nLive Blog\nHow to Watch\nBrighton Women vs. Tottenham Hotspur Women\nSunday, October 15, 2023\nAmerican Express Stadium, Brighton\n11:00 a.m. ET / 4:00 p.m. BST\nTV: none\nStreaming: The FA Player",
