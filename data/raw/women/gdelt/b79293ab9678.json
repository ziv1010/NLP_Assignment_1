More details will be announced at a later date.\nWrestleMania, SummerSlam and Royal Rumble have a combined economic impact of more than $300 million, as the events bring hundreds of thousands of people into the host city from all 50 states and dozens of countries throughout the world. To date in 2024, WrestleMania and Royal Rumble set all-time WWE records for viewership, gate, sponsorship, merchandise and social media.\nSince its inception in 1979, Indiana Sports Corp has hosted more than 500 national and international sporting events, including Super Bowl XLVI, the College Football Playoff National Championship, Men’s & Women’s NCAA Final Fours and 11 Big Ten Football Championship Games.

It looks like two-night SummerSlam events will become the norm starting in 2026 in Minneapolis, if not sooner depending on what’s announced for 2025.",
