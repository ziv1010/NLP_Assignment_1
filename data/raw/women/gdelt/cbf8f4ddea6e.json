  "body_text": "AB InBev signs deal with Netflix\nAB InBev has struck a global partnership with Netflix to bring its beer brands into the heart of streaming culture. The move signals how drinks companies are reshaping marketing strategies to connect with at-home audiences and new drinking occasions.\nAB InBev and Netflix have formed a global partnership between some of the world’s biggest beer brands and one of the fastest-growing entertainment services.\nThe move is seen as a major development in how companies might switch their marketing strategies to counter lower sales due to health concerns and the growing awareness of wellness.\nMarcel Marcondes, chief marketing officer of AB InBev, said in an interview with Fox News that adjusting the brewer’s strategy to appeal to an audience at home is “paramount and offers a glimpse into the future of not only how people socialise, but when they choose to drink”.\nStreaming as a new social occasion\n“Streaming is becoming a big social occasion,” he said. “People get together to watch the shows, to watch this series, and this is a big beer occasion.”\n“We see people scheduling to get together to watch the next episode of their favourite shows, or even with people in different homes in different households, to say, let’s watch together. This is just part of culture now.”\nThe link echoes the thoughts of Diageo’s interim CEO Nik Jaangiani, who recently stressed the importance of “occasions” to the way Gen Z choose to socialise and drink.\nPartner Content\nGlobal scale and cultural integration\nThe partnership with Netflix is “unprecedented in the global reach and scale of activations across AB InBev’s portfolio of brands”, the brewer said.\nIt “is an opportunity for our brands to create deeper experiences with consumers and more moments of cheers while they watch the content that shapes culture.”\n“Together, we will create even more enjoyable experiences for legal drinking age fans around the world and connect with audiences in new and exciting ways. Streaming is a social and shared experience — it’s an occasion where beer and entertainment come together,” said Marcondes.\nTitle integrations, packaging and promotions\nAB InBev will collaborate with Netflix on co-marketing campaigns across a variety of Netflix’s most popular global and regional titles, such as The Gentlemen from the UK, Brasil 70 – A Saga do Tri from Brazil and Culinary Class Wars from South Korea, among others.\nAB InBev brands will feature title integrations, limited-edition packaging and digital promotions. Its beers will also feature in some of Netflix’s productions through product placements.\nAB InBev will also advertise directly in broadcasts of Netflix’s 2025 live American football Christmas Game Day games and plans to collaborate on other sporting events, such as the 2027 Women’s World Cup, which will be covered on Netflix.\nAs reported by db, Netflix is also set to dramatise the story of Ireland’s most famous brewing dynasty with House of Guinness, a new Steven Knight series premiering globally on 25 September.\nRelated news\nAB InBev becomes beer partner for Live Nation UK\nReasons why AB InBev is buying back its stake in US metal plants",
