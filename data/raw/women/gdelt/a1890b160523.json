I believe in nature versus nurture. So give us the basics and we can show this kid love.\"\nColton and Jordan were ultimately able to receive 22 eggs from the donor. After dividing their sperm evenly, three embryos were fertilized, and the healthiest one was transferred into the surrogate.\nColton and Jordan told Men's Health that they'd like to have two children, and whoever's sperm wasn't used the first time will be used the second time around.\nWhen the embryo transfer took place, Colton revealed that it was a special moment for the couple.\nIn fact, Colton and Jordan decided to be intimate and have \"sexy time\" during the transfer, with Colton explaining, \"We just thought that, as the transfer is happening, it's really important that we feel a part of it somehow. Because we're building our family in love.\"\nColton and Jordan learned the transfer had worked 10 days later, but they weren't aware of which man's sperm was used.\nWhile Colton admitted he has \"a million\" regrets from his lifetime, he noted it's \"worth it\" to be able to bring a baby into this world.\nFOLLOW REALITY TV WORLD ON THE ALL-NEW GOOGLE NEWS!\nReality TV World is now available on the all-new Google News app and website.

(PHOTOS)\nColton insisted he was \"100 percent\" speaking the truth, adding, \"I feel like I have been in love multiple times and with different women and I've taken things from those relationships and applied them to my relationship with my husband.\"\nColton concluded that he's become \"a much better partner\" thanks to his past relationships.\nColton and Jordan were first linked in September 2021, when they were photographed kissing and flirting during a romantic getaway to a Four Seasons resort in Maui, HI.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Bachelor alum and Jordan then announced their engagement to Jordan in February 2022 after the pair had been dating for less than one year.\nWhen Colton came out as gay on Good Morning America in April 2021, he said he had never experienced an \"emotional connection\" with a person of the same sex before and he was looking for a man who could challenge him.\nCassie admitted at the time she had no idea Colton was gay during the course of their relationship and was also never given a heads-up that he'd be coming out as gay on national television.\nThe former football player explained on GMA how he realized he was different at the age of six and came to the conclusion he's gay when he was a freshman in high school.\nColton said he hated himself \"for a long time\" and was \"a miserable person living as a shell of a human being\" while pretending to be straight for well over a decade.\nIn addition to having starred on The Bachelor, Colton also appeared on The Bachelorette 14 starring Becca Kufrin and Bachelor in Paradise 5 when he dated Tia Booth.\nColton has said in the press he thought being the Bachelor and dating Cassie could make him straight but he was ultimately lying to himself and he feels badly for having hurt so many women on his season.\nWhen Cassie and Colton split in Spring 2020, their relationship was initially amicable.\nBut Colton and Cassie's breakup turned nasty in June 2020 when Colton got angry about Cassie appearing on a Bachelor special after they had agreed to handle their breakup privately.\nCassie thought she respected Colton's wishes and proceeded to accuse her ex of trying to \"monetize\" their breakup by writing about it in his The First Time memoir.\nColton allegedly put a tracking device on Cassie's car, sent her \"unsettling\" text messages, and would stand outside her apartment or her parents' house very late at night, which resulted in a restraining order against Colton that was ultimately dropped once a private agreement was reached in November 2020.\nADVERTISEMENT\nInterested in more The Bachelor news?
