  "body_text": "This article was originally published in the Winter issue of Esquire\nIt’s a cloudy evening in the middle of June and thousands of people are swarming the grounds of Hampton Court Palace. The England football team is about to kick off its European Championship journey, and in this old quadrangle, deep rows of plastic chairs have been parked in front of a large screen that hangs above a stage. The queue for the bar is long, and expectations are high.\nBut nobody is here for the match. Gareth Southgate’s brave boys will just have to wait. Because for the next 90 minutes, all eyes will be on two middle-aged men cracking wise about the Tudors.\nWhat to Read Next\nThe Rest is History, hosted by Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook, both popular historians and bestselling authors, is the most subscribed-to podcast in Britain. It is also the most popular history podcast in the world, a globetrotting live show and the MVP of Gary Lineker’s all-conquering Goalhanger network.\nCo-founded six years ago with former TV and radio execs Tony Pastor and Jack Davenport, the studio’s line-up of shows — including The Rest is Politics, presented by former New Labour press secretary Alastair Campbell and former Conservative minister Rory Stewart, and The Rest is Football, anchored by Lineker himself — hold permanent residence at the top of the UK charts. According to the company, Goalhanger’s 10 podcasts collectively achieve more than 40 million downloads a month.\nThe Rest is History makes up a lot of those. Peek over someone’s shoulder on the Tube, and there’s a not-insignificant chance they’ll be plugged into an episode. It might be the six-part series dedicated to the Titanic, in which Holland and Sandbrook debunk Hollywood’s myth-making. Or it could be a guest appearance, perhaps the one where friend-of-the-pod Tom Hanks geeks out over Nasa’s lunar missions. Four years since its launch, there are more than 600 episodes to choose from.\nToday, the donnish double act are performing on-stage to a sold-out venue — no surprise there, but also no mean feat on an overcast Sunday evening during a huge international fixture. And did I mention it’s Father’s Day? Judging by the crowd, that wasn’t a scheduling error.\n“Oh my God, we’ve been looking forward to this for so long,” says 22-year-old student George Wheeler, trading a smile with his dad, Len, a 67-year-old retiree from Reigate, Surrey, as Medieval muzak drifts from the speakers.\nThe father and son have bonded over the podcast for years now, discussing each episode after it drops.\n“All the things you thought before, it just blows that apart,” says Len, who was already a fan of Holland’s books. “You know, the stuff we were taught at school was rubbish, really, compared to how they put it over. They find the humanity in history.”\n“I’m a football fan, massively,” George assures me, “but this takes precedence.”\nIt’s show time. The lutes fade out as Holland and Sandbrook walk out onto the stage.\n“Hello, Hampton Court Palace!” shouts Sandbrook. I look around at the crammed courtyard, listen to the hoots and whoops, and ask myself the same question these guys tackle every single week: how did we get here?\nThe other day, Gary Lineker was on a train when a man waved from across the carriage.\n“I’m listening to you,” he said, giddily tapping at his earphones. Right on cue, another passenger unplugged their own and looked over. “Me too!”\n“I’m getting a lot more love everywhere I go,” Lineker tells me over the phone in early August. He’s relaxing in his garden after a relentless month at the Euros. Alongside his co-hosts, players-turned-pundits Micah Richards and Alan Shearer, the veteran broadcaster released an episode of The Rest is Football every single day from his Berlin rental. That was on top of his BBC duties.\nA summer break was never on the cards. And what, lose ground to the myriad other football podcasts jostling for attention? It would all be worth it in the end: over the course of the tournament, The Rest is Football accumulated 19.6 million downloads and over 66 million views across social-media platforms, doubling its audience in the process.\nIn real terms, that means becoming a fixture of people’s lives — infiltrating their commutes, dog walks, bubble baths and everyday conversations — in the way that only podcasts can.\n“I’ve just been to lunch now where a couple of middle-aged women came up to me and said: ‘I want to thank you for The Rest is History and The Rest is Politics’,” Lineker tells me, sounding slightly bewildered. The former England (and Tottenham, Everton and Barcelona) striker has been famous — properly stopped-in-the-street, sign-my-forehead famous — for 40 years, but even he finds this new chapter surreal.\nIt was in late 2018, almost 25 years after his BBC radio debut, that Lineker first got the ball rolling.\nHe had set up Goalhanger Films five years earlier with Pastor, the former controller of sport for ITV, to produce traditional documentaries. But television is a slow-moving world of tight budgets, risk-averse commissioners and CC’d middlemen. Why not bypass all that?\nLineker sent a DM to fellow football broadcaster Danny Baker on Twitter and, soon enough, the pair — basically strangers, but for social media — were sitting in Lineker’s kitchen to record the pilot episode of a podcast called Behind Closed Doors, swapping anecdotes and grumbles about the game.\nThe show’s modest success convinced Pastor to pitch a curveball: a World War II podcast called We Have Ways of Making You Talk. Hosted by the historian James Holland (brother of Tom) and his comedian friend Al Murray, it started off as a weekly show in the spring of 2019 and built a dedicated audience by word of mouth. When lockdown arrived in March 2020, episodes went out daily.\nAround that time, former BBC producer Davenport joined as a third partner. He’d been plugging away on sport radio for years but knew that podcasts were the place to be. “I thought they’d hit on something,” he tells me over Zoom, sitting alongside Pastor in Goalhanger’s London office. “There was more room to run with it.”\nSo, in late 2020, as the spectre of a second lockdown loomed, Davenport presented his pitch to Pastor and Lineker: what if, instead of limiting themselves to a single world war, they created a podcast covering… the entire span of human civilisation?\nIt’s not a particularly novel concept — the Encyclopaedia Britannica got there first — but the show’s format has transformed the business of popular history. The thinking was simple: give a pair of microphones to two gifted storytellers who know their stuff and, crucially, enjoy spending time with each other, and let them jabber on about Lord Byron, or Richard Nixon or whoever, as long as they can make it easy, enlightening and conversational.\nIt helps that the hosts complement each other so well. Sandbrook, a sardonic student of the 20th century and critic of “hand-wringing” approaches to British history, teamed with Holland, a chirpy, self-effacing and liberal-minded aficionado of the ancient world.\nThe show’s success was exponential. Around nine months after launching, Davenport tells me, “We looked at each other and said: we need to build a company around this podcast.”\nWhat really helped was the timing. According to Spotify, podcast streams doubled in the first three months of the pandemic. It was already a boom time for the industry, following two years of massive investment from the tech giants, including Spotify and Amazon. Suddenly, there was a captive audience to capitalise on.\nBy 2020, the US podcast advertising market was worth $842m — up 700 per cent over the span of five years. UK figures were comparatively modest, but followed a similar curve. The podcast pioneers couldn’t have seen that coming back in 2004, when the word itself was first coined in a Guardian article about a “new boom in amateur radio”.\nThe appeal was clear from the start: podcasts are easy to make and (for the most part) free to listen to, with a DIY infrastructure that allows for a wider array of voices. And yet, for the first 10 years of their existence, established publishers only dabbled in podcasts, and small brands made up much of the ad spend.\nWith some notable exceptions, journalists, comedians and chopped-up segments from radio shows dominated the data stream. But when the advertising money started to flow in around the mid-Noughties, so too did the celebrities. Slowly at first, and then all at once. Often, they were hired by podcast companies wanting to cut through the noise.\n“Celebrities are shortcuts for attention,” says Matt Deegan, audio consultant and co-founder of the British Podcast Awards. “The celebrity has already done the brand development, so it’s an easy sell to someone. It doesn’t mean that it’s a good show or does well.”\nMany famous podcasters found success, but the early adopters reigned supreme. American stand-up comedian and culture warrior Joe Rogan, a lightning rod for controversy, was by far the most popular podcaster in the world by the end of the 2010s, with 190 million downloads a month. His meteoric rise was being tracked by the Swedish music-streaming app Spotify, which hoped to become the industry’s foremost podcast platform.\nIn 2020, Spotify signed Rogan to an exclusive deal for $200m, as part of a wider $1bn bet. Alongside him on the new podcast roster, for tens of millions of dollars each: Kim Kardashian; the Obamas; and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, just months after their royal exit. Much like Amazon, the streamer also purchased independent podcast studios and popular shows.\nLockdown felt like fertile ground for an industry that thrived on routine. Advertisers feared that consumer spending would go down and upped their own accordingly. Yet analysts were puzzled. Even if the projected growth was correct, Spotify would still struggle to recoup its massive outlay.\nThat was tomorrow’s problem. For now, the podcast gold rush was pulling in some of the biggest names in pop culture and politics. Gary Lineker’s contact list would come in useful.\nBy the end of 2021, The Rest is History had sold out its first live show. But it wasn’t until spring that Goalhanger unveiled its follow-up: The Rest is Politics.\nAlastair Campbell attended the same school as Gary Lineker in Leicester in the 1970s, albeit a few years apart, and the latter’s occasionally outspoken views on government policy brought them back in touch. The Goalhanger boss spotted an opportunity, and approached Campbell about starting a discussion-and-debate show with a Tory counterpart of his choice.\n“He got the hump for a bit and said it would be an impossible idea,” Pastor remembers. “Then he drew up a list of 10.”\nCampbell crowdsourced the names on Instagram. Rory Stewart, the former Conservative MP and leadership candidate who had recently had his whip suspended for voting against a no-deal Brexit, was by far the most popular with Campbell’s followers.\nThings could have been very different. “Alastair takes the piss out of me because I suggested Dominic Cummings,” Pastor laughs.\nIn the end, Goalhanger’s co-founders agreed that they wanted to balance the left-leaning Campbell with somebody “towards the centre-right” of the political spectrum. So, Stewart won out.\n“That was very much the idea, to disagree agreeably,” says Lineker, no stranger to heated political discourse himself. “Considering how polarised it has become in recent years…” He pauses. “We just wanted to show that people from different sides can actually get on.”\nCritics of the show would suggest there’s not actually a lot of disagreement going on a lot of the time, agreeable or otherwise. How much of a balancing act you can play on the political pivot is up for debate. But Stewart and Campbell certainly bring insight and experience to the table, and the odd-couple dynamic helps, too.\nOne surprising discovery was the podcast’s youthful demographic. Around half of The Rest is Politics audience is under the age of 33, too young to have voted in the New Labour years. And impressive listening figures suggest that TikTok hasn’t deep-fried their attention spans just yet.\nIt wasn’t long until Campbell and Stewart were fighting it out with The Rest is History at the top of the podcast charts. Both shows introduced their own membership schemes and semi-regular, sold-out live shows. Goalhanger had found its template.\nBy this point, Lineker and co were feeling confident. And yet, no matter how many times they quoted Field of Dreams at her, Anita Anand wondered if anyone would even notice her podcast’s arrival.\nThe BBC radio presenter had been asked to co-host Empire with her friend and collaborator, the historian William Dalrymple, towards the end of 2022. It would delve into the story of British colonialism in India, something they had written about together in the past. It would be Goalhanger’s fourth history podcast in three years.\nGoalhanger’s Battleground, hosted by military historians Patrick Bishop and Saul David, had appeared a few months earlier. Was there room for another? Certainly, there had never been an easier time to start a podcast — but there had never been a tougher time to draw attention to it. Over two million new shows had been created since 2020, with the top one per cent of podcasts receiving 99 per cent of downloads.\nBut the runaway success of The Rest is History and The Rest is Politics meant that Goalhanger could now cross-promote their podcasts and give new shows a leg-up. On the phone in early August, I ask Anand what Empire brought to the table.\n“Apart from ovaries?” she says, laughing. “In this day and age, the subject matter is obviously fascinating to people. They want to understand why we are here and what went on before.”\nScottish scholar Dalrymple spends most of his time at his farmhouse near Delhi, India, while Anand, the daughter of Punjabi immigrants, lives in London. To start with, Goalhanger sent them both microphones and left them to it. There was no real downside: the show was cheap to make, and if it failed, it failed. It didn’t.\n“I write books normally, and I’m very pleased if I sell 100,000 copies in the course of a year,” Dalrymple tells me over a flagging phone signal from his Highlands holiday. “This last week, just for two episodes, we had 690,000 downloads. It’s ridiculous.”\nDalrymple calls podcasting “extraordinarily light-footed guerilla radio” that can transcend borders and censors. Anand still regularly appears on the BBC airwaves and describes it as the difference between “being in a cathedral and a pub”.\n“There is an architecture in radio that is very deliberate, thought-out and built on ancient stones of wisdom,” she explains, “whereas with a podcast, it’s just so free. You have an idea, and you can put it out into the world. I love that.”\nThe money is fun, too. On the whole, each Goalhanger host receives a third of the profit from their podcast — meaning your monthly payout is commensurate with the success of your show. Rory Stewart has described The Rest is Politics as “Championship-footballer money” — conceivably tens of thousands of pounds each week. The Empire hosts haven’t hit those heights, but they’re happy with the return on their time.\n“This is the first time in my entire adult life when I haven’t been bouncing in the land of overdraft,” Dalrymple tells me. “It comes with a very welcome paycheck at the end of it, which continues to rise and rise.”\nLike Lineker, they also talk of being stopped in the street by fans who riff on running jokes. Speaking to the Goalhanger roster, “intimacy” is the word that crops up constantly.\n“I think it’s unique to podcasting,” says Anand. She’d received kind words for her work in the past, “but this is a quantum leap from all of that. It’s informal, it’s unguarded. People do feel like they know you a lot more.”\nPsychologists refer to the one-sided bonds formed through podcasts as “parasocial relationships”. The Atlantic uncharitably calls it “imaginary friends for adults”. But who among us hasn’t listened to two charismatic hosts shoot the shit and felt, if only for a fleeting moment, as though they were part of the conversation?\nWhen We Have Ways of Making You Talk went daily in the first lockdown, Pastor says it played a poignant role in people’s lives. “A lot of the listeners to that podcast were blokes of a certain age, and many wanted to have a sense that they were part of a conversation every day,” he tells me. It all came to a head when hosts Murray and Holland held a meet-up when the UK government relaxed social distancing laws.\n“The boys really enjoyed it,” says Pastor, “but it was slightly disconcerting to have hundreds of people come up and treat them like they’re old mates.”\nWhile Goalhanger was going from strength to strength, the wider picture was looking less rosy. By the beginning of 2023, the podcast bubble had burst. Spotify’s dumb-money days were over.\nListening numbers were rising steadily, but advertising had slowed down. Spotify’s podcasts weren’t turning a profit and that January, the company reduced its staff for the third time in five months. Soon they parted ways with the Obamas and their $25m deal; Harry and Meghan, who had produced just one series in three years, were next on the chopping block. Similar cuts were seen across the industry. Much-loved shows were cancelled. Studios went bust.\nThe downturn was a gut punch for UK podcast creators who hoped to convert sceptical advertisers on home soil. By 2022, total UK podcasting revenue stood at £37m — up tenfold from 2016, but not much to go around compared with the billions spent each year on print, digital and broadcasting.\n“The ad agencies still don’t understand it,” says Pastor, not without frustration. “The media-buying agencies who have long lunches with their counterparts in the TV and radio world and have these trading deals… it’s an incredibly opaque, complicated business. There’s definitely a sense that podcasting is a kind of disruptive new kid on the block they don’t really understand the value of yet.”\n“To an extent,” says Davenport, “our business is a gamble on that side catching up to how people consume content now.”\nIt was time to bring out the big guns. Halfway through 2023, the inevitable news arrived: Gary Lineker, alongside his Match of the Day colleagues, would be launching his own show called The Rest is Football.\nHe felt that the football podcasts already on the market, specifically the ones hosted by sports journalists, were “very good but generally quite earnest”. Watching the games with his BBC colleagues off-camera, gossiping and joking around in the hours building up to the weekly highlight show, had always been Lineker’s favourite part of the job. “I thought, if we can be light-hearted and serious, with our own football histories, that would give us the edge.”\nAnother Goalhanger show followed three weeks later, presented by ITV newsman Robert Peston and journalist Steph McGovern: a finance show called The Rest is Money. Then came the fictional true-crime podcast Sherlock & Co., followed by Legacy, another history show hosted by academic Peter Frankopan and journalist Afua Hirsch.\nBy the end of 2023, Goalhanger had established itself as the UK’s largest independent podcast company. Identikit competitors continue to snap at its heels — see Political Currency, hosted by former Conservative chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne and former Labour shadow chancellor of the exchequer Ed Balls, or Stick to Football, with players-turned-pundits Gary Neville, Jamie Carragher, Jill Scott, Ian Wright and Roy Keane — but so far, nobody has pushed the Goalhangers from their perch.\nThe question remains: why? It clearly wasn’t just a matter of talent. Many of the studio’s hosts had previously released podcasts that didn’t hit the mark. Goalhanger’s familiar ‘The Rest is…’ branding no doubt helps, even if it didn’t make an enormous amount of sense after the first instance. Perhaps, across a period in which the world has been engulfed by tumult and scandal, the company’s self-styled level-headedness and establishment bent holds a palliative kind of appeal. Maybe, as the Goalhanger name suggests, it’s just a case of right place, right time.\nThere’s a simpler explanation, of course: that the shows are well cast and enjoyable to listen to. Towards the end of 2023, Goalhanger began work on another podcast — and set its sights on the next step.\nEvery Monday morning, Richard Osman and Marina Hyde pull up to Spotify’s London studio, nestled behind a big metal door on a grand Westminster row, to record two episodes of The Rest is Entertainment.\nThe show launched at the tail end of 2023, after Osman, the TV producer-presenter turned blockbuster author met Hyde, political satirist for The Guardian, at a book festival. Goalhanger had been trying to get Osman onboard for a while, but the ideas didn’t feel right, and he was busy with his bestselling Thursday Murder Club novels. It was only when the two hit it off that the concept came to him.\nThe first weekly episode they record is a mix of pop-culture talking points and showbiz intel. The other is a Q&A session pulled from their mailbag. (Who is Banksy? Can celebrities dodge jury service?) Today, I’m meeting them fresh from the booth, which was built during Spotify’s spending spree four years prior.\nThe Rest is Entertainment holds a unique place in Goalhanger’s line-up. In some ways it is the most international of them all, particularly when it indulges in Hollywood industry gossip. But the hosts are just as likely to dedicate an episode to discussing British game shows — Osman’s speciality — or, as is the case today, the nation-shaking break-up of Love Island-ers Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury.\nSometimes, like a resident Greek chorus, they find themselves discussing media topics that, through the show’s success, they’ve become an inextricable part of.\nBecause in 2024, it’s abundantly clear that podcasts aren’t just podcasts anymore. The Rest is Entertainment is filmed and packaged for YouTube, which has emerged as a crucial platform for podcast creators. Ditto Instagram, TikTok and X, where segments of conversations are clipped — often by Goalhanger, sometimes by fans or critics — before being surrendered to the algorithm.\nI ask them what it’s like to get chewed up by the content-industrial complex. The answer: not great.\n“Our big algorithm used to be the Deal or No Deal prize pot,” says Osman, glumly.\n“Now the algorithm runs countries,” Hyde replies. “It’s a shame.”\nTo have somebody’s ear is a powerful thing. Become a darling of the doomscroll, and there’s no limit to how far your podcast can go — or how deeply entrenched you can become in people’s lives. Nobody has tested that to its logical endpoint just yet. How long, I ask, until we find ourselves with a podcaster prime minister?\nHyde: “I don’t know! Who’d have thought we were going to have the biggest reality-TV star become president?”\nOsman: “Certainly, if I was Alastair Campbell or Rory Stewart, I have an awful lot more political power now than I did before the podcast started.”\nHyde: “Than when you’re in the Cabinet? Yeah, I mean, you have a lot more than that.”\nOsman: “I absolutely see that…”\nHyde: “How about President Rogan? Oh, I hope not.”\n“But listen,” says Osman, settling into the idea. “That’s a definite possibility — President Rogan. Why not? Just as the prime ministership has become another little rung on a particular ladder of grifting, you go podcast, president, and then get twice as much money for the podcast next time around.”\nOn that note: back in August, fresh from hosting Channel 4’s election coverage in the UK, Stewart and Campbell flew over to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, flanked by the hosts of The Rest is Politics US (oh yeah — that one launched earlier this year, with British journalist Katty Kay and short-lived Trump staffer Anthony “The Mooch” Scaramucci). In September, it was announced that a Goalhanger supergroup, comprising Hyde, Stewart, Campbell, Sandbrook and Mooch, would be recording a live show from New York on US election day.\nThe benefits of covering American politics are twofold. First, placing the word “Trump” into a podcast’s headline will send its popularity through the roof. (“I’m trying to think, would it be good for business if he wins?” Lineker pondered when we spoke. “I don’t think it would be good for the world.”)\nBut it’s also true that breaking into the American podcast market would transform any studio’s bottom line. After all that boom and bust, the industry has corrected itself and settled into a steadier ascent.\nAnother reason to diversify looms large. Earlier this year, the BBC announced plans to introduce adverts to its vast collection of podcasts and repackaged radio shows. In an open letter to the government, podcast producers said it could have a “disastrous” impact on the UK market. Måns Ulvestam, co-founder of podcast-hosting company Acast, believes that the move “will cannibalise every other podcast’s revenue”.\nSo, Goalhanger wants to create US podcasts that achieve the impact of their homegrown counterparts. “Obviously, we’re aware that there are probably thousands of British companies at the bottom of the Atlantic somewhere who’ve tried and failed to break America,” says Davenport. “But we’ve got a few things in the pipeline. I don’t think we’ve got a specific pairing we’re after, but if Barack Obama wants to do something new, we would be open to it.”\nYou’ll rarely see him in the Goalhanger office, but Lineker says he is “always on the phone, listening to the podcasts, offering my little nuggets of ignored advice”. Would the 63-year-old be tempted to go full-time and make a go of it in the US? Perhaps he could even quit Match of the Day? His £1.3m-a-year contract runs out in 2025.\n“I could do,” he says. “Whether that will be the case I don’t know. At some point, I have to slow down somewhere… I’m getting old.”\nFor now, he’s in the mood to reflect. “We never envisaged where we’re at now,” he says, thinking back to that first show on the kitchen counter. “For all I knew, we could have just been talking to ourselves.”\nThe rest is… well, you get the idea. ○",
