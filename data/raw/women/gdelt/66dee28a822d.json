The U.S. was second to Sweden in the 2011 group stages and went on to finish as tournament runners-up.\nThe U.S. will face the winner of Group G in the last 16 in Melbourne on August 6. Sweden are in pole position to top Group G after two wins from their opening two group games. The U.S. will learn its last-16 opponent following the final round of Group G fixtures on Wednesday.\nAs it stands in Group E\nShort of conceding a goal, that first half could not have gone much worse for the USWNT; Portugal have been the better team, Lavelle will miss the next match and the Netherlands are building an unassailable lead at the top of Group E.\nUSWNT 0-0 Portugal\nNetherlands 5-0 Vietnam\n- Netherlands – 7 PTS, GD: 6\n- USWNT – 5 PTS, GD: 3\n- Portugal – 4 PTS, GD: 1\n- Vietnam – 0 PTS, GD: -10\nLavelle starts for the USWNT\nFollowing two substitute appearances in the opening two group games, Rose Lavelle is in from the start for the USWNT against Portugal.\nLavelle was introduced at halftime during their last match against the Netherlands.\nLooking at a 1-0 deficit at halftime, it was clear that the 2019 Bronze Ball winner was needed to turn the tide.\nNobody in the pool can quite do everything Lavelle does. The second half against the Netherlands reminded us of that.\nUSWNT vs Portugal - follow live\nThe USWNT face Portugal in their final group game today as they attempt to top Group E and secure their place in the last 16.\nVlatko Andonovski has made two changes to the side that drew with the Netherlands, with Rose Lavelle coming in for Savannah DeMelo and Lynn Williams replacing Trinity Rodman.\nBrazil's Marta offers emotional reflection on iconic legacy, says she's 'ready' for 90 minutes vs. Jamaica\nMarta shed tears in Tuesday's news conference to preview Brazil's final group stage clash against Jamaica. She was asked to ponder her 20-year legacy; initially, she deflected from the question, not wanting to talk about herself.\nHead coach Pia Sundhage gladly picked up the torch, saying, \"Marta played in Sweden as a young player. I saw her in U-20 and in the (2004) Thailand World Cup, and I coached against her in club teams, and she means so much to Swedish football actually, so I knew that she was big. Okay, she's a famous player. But I could not even imagine how big she is in Brazil. So I get very emotional just being around such a good player, and not only what she's going to do tomorrow, but what she's done for so many years, and been a fantastic role model. So thank you for that.\"\nMarta herself said via translator, \"When I started playing, I didn't have an idol, a female idol.\" She was unable to see herself in the game as no one showed women's football when she was growing up, and now people stop her and the team and tell them, \"My daughter wants to be just like you.\"\n\"This wouldn't have happened if we had stopped at the first obstacles that we faced,\" Marta said, crediting a continuous persistence over the years for building the game to this point.\nIn terms of their preparation for Jamaica, Sundhage said she would of course not reveal their tactics, although she was very much aware of not repeating their error against France in losing Wendie Renard on a set piece. She said they were prepared for a very fast and physical game from both sides.\nMarta was asked if she could play 90 minutes; she said, \"I will struggle, but I will fight to play 90 minutes. I'm ready. I'm prepared.\"\nEden Park ready for USWNT vs. Portugal\nMore fans will soon be gathering in Eden Park in New Zealand for the USWNT's group-stage match against Portugal at 3 a.m. ET, 7 p.m. local time in Auckland. Fox is carrying the broadcast for those in the U.S. staying up to watch.\nHead over to The Athletic's live blog of the match to follow the latest news and analysis.\nJamaica's Lorne Donaldson, Peyton McNamara preview match against Brazil\nAt the MD-1 news conference to preview Jamaica's final group stage clash with Brazil, coach Lorne Donaldson and midfielder Peyton McNamara called themselves the underdogs. One reporter called it \"David versus Goliath.\" Donaldson responded, \"I wish it was that easy.\"\nDonaldson said that they would take a few things from France's high-pressure game that disrupted Brazil's buildup, but that they had a very different team, and would ultimately play the way that suited their personnel.\nOn the other end, Donaldson said star Khadija Shaw, now available again after having to sit out against Panama due to a red card from the first game, was \"going to pose a problem for anybody.\"\n\"Obviously we can use (Shaw) in certain areas that we didn't do against Panama... (but) it's got to be everybody. Everybody has to do their job. Bunny Shaw is just one player — but she's a very, very good player,\" Donaldson said.\nDonaldson also joked that with Australia having similar colors to Jamaica, he wouldn't mind seeing them supporting the Reggae Girlz alongside any Jamaican diaspora in Melbourne. \"I'm just telling Aussies right now that we love them,\" he said.\nEngland captain to wear ‘Unite for Gender Equality’ armband for match against China\nA few notes regarding England's game against China on Tuesday:\n- England will be in their home kit (white shirts, blue shorts).\n- The England captain will wear the ‘Unite for Gender Equality’ armband as the team continues to support FIFA’s ‘Football Unites the World’ campaign.\nAlen Stajcic out as Philippines' WNT coach\nThe contracts of the Philippines' women's national soccer team coach Alen Stajcic and assistant coach Nahuel Arrarte expired at the end of the team's World Cup campaign and will not be renewed as the coaches have \"asked to explore other options,\" team manager Jeff Cheng said in a statement.\nVlatko Andonovski: the USWNT manager who doesn't want to be the story\nVlatko Andonovski took the Reign head coaching role in 2017, moving on from FC Kansas City after the club folded — he had led Kansas City to two NWSL championships. During that stint, he also pulled double duty as head coach of the Kansas City Comets, a men’s top-flight indoor league. In 2014, he won championships in both.\nRight before his current role, he had led the Reign to the playoffs, despite a massive run of injuries that had nearly derailed the team’s 2019 season. He took the USWNT job that October, fully aware of the expectations and pressure it presented.\nBut Andonovski thinks he's still the same guy — the one who had balanced multiple teams at the same time, would stick around an NWSL draft just to show you his draft board because he liked sharing his process or who’d pause his morning jog or coffee run to say hi to someone who crossed his path.\n“I don’t know if I have changed, but things around me have changed a lot,” he told The Athletic. “The environment, obviously, is different. The people I’m surrounded by for most of the day are different, even though I try to stay the same as much as possible.”\nRead the full interview below\nRapinoe: We know we can be better\nAs the U.S. women’s national team waits to face Portugal to finish up their group stage of the Women’s World Cup on Tuesday in Tāmaki Makaurau, Auckland, the match is now “a must perform, must win,” says Megan Rapinoe.\nThat’s not a new scenario for this squad.\n“We go into these moments like, ‘Hell yeah, this is exactly where we want to be,'” she said. “You could feel it in the second half, even, of the game against the Netherlands, that’s coming, you know that it’s coming.\n\"For us, we’re excited, we’re unsatisfied with the way that we’ve played, but we know the areas that we can be better and I think there are some really simple fixes that we can do to put ourselves in a better position to have more joy on the ball, especially in the final third.”\nMore below\nLavelle’s importance to USWNT’s World Cup\nU.S. coach Vlatko Andonovski opted not to make a single change to his lineup from the group-opening win over Vietnam. Among the players who stayed on the bench was Rose Lavelle, as the team continued to manage her minutes as she works back from an injury.\nLooking at a 1-0 deficit at halftime, it was clear that the 2019 Bronze Ball winner was needed to turn the tide.\nNobody in the pool can quite do everything Lavelle does. The second half against the Netherlands reminded us of that.\nMore analysis below\nCoombs: Overlooked by England for eight years, preparing to take centre stage\nWhen the irreplaceable midfield maestro Keira Walsh was taken off on a stretcher against Denmark on Friday, England manager Sarina Wiegman turned to Laura Coombs.\nDespite being the oldest player in the England squad at the age of 32, Coombs is one of the most inexperienced. Only Hannah Hampton, Esme Morgan and Katie Robinson, all in their early twenties, have fewer caps.\nIn 2015, Coombs made her first two senior England appearances. She would not play again for her country until eight years later.\nMore details below\nWho should start for England against China?\nEngland will be without instrumental midfielder Keira Walsh for their final group game against China, leaving Sarina Wiegman with a big selection decision on her hands.\nShould Katie Zelem get the nod as a like-for-like replacement? Will we see Laura Coombs from the off? Can Jordan Nobbs force her way into the midfield? Should Wiegman play a double pivot or a single pivot?\nOur experts have their say on who should start for England against China.\nMore analysis below\nHow do England replace Walsh?\n- Like for like?\n- The Plan B against Denmark?\n- Switching to a double pivot?\n- Use three proper central midfielders?\n- Change formation completely?\nWith instrumental midfielder Keira Walsh sidelined for England's final group game against China, how do the Lionesses replace her?\nMore analysis below\nPriestman blames 'pressure' after Canada exit\nCanada coach Bev Priestman said the difference between the side that claimed Olympic gold and the one that exited the World Cup at the group stage two years later was \"pressure and belief\".\nCanada became the first Olympic champions in history to crash out in the opening round of the next World Cup following a 4-0 defeat by Australia on Monday.\n\"When we went into Tokyo I'm not sure anybody thought we would win an Olympic gold medal. I did. The team did. But I'm not sure anybody (else) did,\" Priestman told reporters after a shock heavy loss.\n\"You're coming into a very difficult group (B at the World Cup). There's pressure. And you've got that target on your back. That's new territory. And I think that's the difference ... it's belief and pressure for me.\n\"At half-time (with Canada trailing 2-0) I told them, 'I believe. Do you believe? We have to stick together, we have to believe.\n\"My (four) substitutions at half-time were trying to be brave and bold and chucking the kitchen sink at it, and that's all we tried to do.\n\"We had a gameplan, but it's behaviours within that. It's behaviours of getting up to the ball, playing forward, running at players.\n\"I keep saying the word but 'belief,' and the group I've got in front of me are world class players and can be a world class team. We just need to believe it.\"\nEuropean champions gear up to face Asian champions\nTuesday's Group D fixture between China and England sees the champions of Asia face the European champions.\nChina won the Asian Cup in January 2022 before England triumphed in the Euros the following summer.\nAhead of Tuesday's fixture, England midfielder Georgia Stanway spoke about how special it was to be part of England's Euro 2022-winning squad alongside players she had grown up playing alongside.\n“When you play people at the youth age group, you kind of build connections,\" Stanway said. \"As England have played the same nations. You build relationships. It’s really exciting to see people that I used to play with maybe five or six years ago progress and be at the same World Cup together.\n\"It’s unbelievable and likewise, with China, to be Asian champions and see them achieve that. It’s heartwarming as a player knowing that they’ve had their journey as well.”\nWiegman on China's threat\nEngland manager Sarina Wiegman is expecting China to carry a varied threat when the two sides meet in their final group stage fixture on Tuesday.\nEngland top Group D and China sit third, but both sides are still in contention to qualify for the last-16 or be eliminated heading into Tuesday's fixture.\n“Of course we’ve analysed China,\" Wiegman said. \"They’re a different team to the one we saw at the Olympics. A different team. A different coach. I think they play very organised. They can play possession and also play a direct style of play.”\nStanway on the importance of family\nEngland midfielder Georgia Stanway emphasised the importance of players' families being out in Australia to support the team.\n“It’s massive,\" Stanway said. \"From day one Sarina has installed in us how big a part of a family we are. Not only in our environment but making sure that our families are connected so that we have special moments with families. (Match day) plus two is our day when we can relax and enjoy our time with our families.\n\"We’ve all got families out here pretty much, even Sarina. We’re just loving that day just to relax and be off. That’s the day you can take your mind away from football and can just have some family time”.\n“Sometimes you don’t realise your head coach is actually human. It’s nice that her family are here supporting us as well with England shirts on”",
