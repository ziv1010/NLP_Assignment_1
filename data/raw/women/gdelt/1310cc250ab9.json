  "body_text": "Mikel Arteta was delighted that a late goal managed to send us into the summer with plenty of positivity after we beat Southampton 2-1 in our final game.\nMartin Odegaard’s excellent low shot secured the victory for us with a minute of normal time to play to finish the campaign on a high note, after Kieran Tierney had given us the lead before the hosts found a leveller.\nAnd with Kieran and a few others in mind, the boss was pleased we managed to say farewell to some players whose contracts at the club are expiring in the summer and give another moment of joy in our colours.\nPost-match, Mikel said: “I’m very happy. You want to start your holidays in the next few days with a good feeling, with a good vibe, seeing some smiley faces there. It was important to win it, it was important as well to say goodbye to a few players who have left our football club, to say thank you for their contribution.\n“Some of them, like Kieran, they've been on this journey for six years with us. Jorginho, we’re trying to hug him, Neto and Raheem as well. So, there are a few players that I had the duty to say thank you to. I think we all have and we wish them the best for the next season.\n“[Kieran] mentioned it yesterday, he said ‘I’m going to score in my last game’ and he's certainly done it.”\nThe win brought the curtain down on a 58-game campaign that has seen us go further in the Champions League than we’ve experienced since 2009, and again remain in the highest echelons of the Premier League table right throughout the season, ultimately ending up with a third successive runners-up finish.\nMikel is looking forward to recharging his batteries over the coming weeks, but having enjoyed watching our women’s team become European champions courtesy of their win over Barcelona, he is hoping that we can use that as inspiration for our own successes in 2025/26.\n“It's time to reflect, time to reset, and get our energy back,” he added. “It's been a really demanding season, a season that has stretched us all. But I think the culture and the mindset that we have at the football club have sustained everything to perform with the resources that we have at the highest level up to the last day, and I think that's remarkable.\n“We were on the bus journey to Southampton and we were all cheering [the women’s team]. We’re so proud, the way they've done it, the way they have overcome adversity throughout the season and managed to do that against Barcelona, it's amazing. So, big congratulations and make sure that they enjoy tomorrow!”\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
