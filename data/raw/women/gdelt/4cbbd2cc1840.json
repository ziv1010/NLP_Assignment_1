That's in their DNA. They're not going to let the rope slip.\"\nThe Tigers trailed 17-0 and were still trailing in the final two minutes when Williams took a handoff through a big hole on the left side and into the the end zone for the winning score. LSU players jumped with joy, but it was probably as much relief after trailing most of the game.\nAnd LSU made a bunch of mistakes. Nussmeier had an interception and fumble off a bad snap. The Gamecocks blocked a punt and the Tigers failed on an extra point with another poor snap. South Carolina held LSU without points after first-and-goal two yards from the end zone in the third quarter.\n\"It's not perfect by any means. But it's early in the season,\" Kelly said.\nNussmeier finished with 285 yards passing and two touchdowns, Caden Durham ran for 98 yards and a pair of scores.\nFor much of this game, it looked like South Carolina would come away with an unexpected win.\nQuarterback LaNorris Sellers ran for two touchdowns including a 75-yard burst that was longest by a quarterback in South Carolina history. Arkansas transfer Raheim Sanders had a 66-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter that put the Gamecocks back on top.\nSouth Carolina had a final chance to tie things, driving to the LSU 39 with :05 to play. Kicker Alex Herrera, however, pushed his 49-yard goal attempt left and LSU players ran to the sidelines to celebrate.\nSellers, who ran for 88 yards and threw for 113, came out right before halftime with an ankle injury. Sellers and coach Shane Beamer both said it was not serious.\nSanders ran for 143 yards and two scores.\nTHE TAKEAWAY\nLSU: It was an inconsistent performance by the Tigers, but it was a much needed victory after the grumbling from losing to Southern Cal 27-20 in the opener two weeks ago.\nSouth Carolina: The Gamecocks, picked 13th in the 16-team SEC, missed a golden opportunity to mark themselves as SEC contenders.\nOPPORTUNITY LOST\nBeamer apologized to fans for his team's 13 penalties. \"Obviously, we've got to clean up a lot, but there's a lot to build on as well,\" he said. \"We've all got to be better, starting with me.\"\nWOMEN\"S HOOPS\nA big week for South Carolina women's hoops and coach Dawn Staley that began with a visit to the White House on Tuesday ended with a celebration at the football game. The team was honored at halftime for their 38-0, national championship season. Staley was also the guest picker on \"College GameDay.\"\nUP NEXT\nLSU starts a three-game home stand with UCLA on Saturday.\nSouth Carolina faces Akron at home on Saturday night.\nMore Articles to Read\n© Copyright 2026 The Sumter Item |\nTerms of Use / Privacy Policy |\nCancellation / Refund Policy\nx",
