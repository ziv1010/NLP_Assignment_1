Credit: Al Bello/Getty Images\nAmongst the wider social context of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders' continuing fight for justice, and a federal government unwilling to engage, the sight of a young Blak woman representing the country was a powerful one for many.\nFrom the moment she was revealed before a screaming stadium and millions of viewers across the world as the lighter of the Olympic flame, expectations were sky-high for her 400 metre run.\nThe Kuku Yalanji Birri Gubba woman, then 27 years old, had won silver at the '96 Atlanta Games: the Sydney Olympics were seen as her (golden) chance for the top prize.\nLooked back on, her win seems inevitable: the lithe sight of Cathy gliding to a comfortable victory made it look easy.\nIn reality it was the culmination of years of work, an elite athlete at their peak.\nThe screams of thousands of spectators, echoed in living rooms around the country, were a release as much relief as elation, sharing in the glory.\nOlympic boxing hopeful James Swan at Darling Harbour in December 1999.

His prowess gained him respect.\n\"I'm a sportsman,\" he said.\n\"I don't like wanting to fight people, because it causes bad feelings ... but when it's in a boxing ring, I'll tear you up!\n\"I love it.\"\nHe won bronze medals at the both the '94 and '98 Commonwealth Games.\nDuring the 1999 Olympics Test Events, something of a dress rehearsal before the Games proper, Swan took gold in the 57kg event.\nHe has been inducted into the Aboriginal and Islander Sports Hall of Fame.\nKyle Vander-Kuyp taking a leap at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.

The electricity was buzzing through your body,\" he said.\n\"It's hard to describe the sensation you get going out there.\n\"It's still a regret to this day that we didn't do better.\"\nIn an electrifying game against Nigeria, the Socceroos were down 2-0. After scoring one goal, the Socceroos were bouyed by the home crowd.\nWehrman went on to score another goal, drawing the team level with Nigeria to raucous screams.\n\"Now and again my missus will bring it up,\" he said.\n\"It's nice to remember it ... I remember celebrating.\"\nUnder his jersey, the midfielder had donned another shirt with the words \"Hello to Cloncurry\", his home town in Queensland.\n\"I don't know why I did it.

Having reached our shores from its outset in historic Olympia, the torch began its 100-day relay through the country at Uluru, in the hands of Peris.\n\"I had made the decision to run with no shoes on and [an Elder] said 'No shoes Nova', and I said 'No, a sign of respect for this sacred country,'\" the Gija Yawuru Gagudju woman told NITV.\nPeris ran a 1.4km stretch at the base of Uluru with her then 10-year-old daughter Jessica, who Peris said she had to hide before the moment came.\n\"The rules were no one is to run with the Olympic torchbearer,\" Peris said.\n\"Try telling that to a 10-year-old, who said 'I'm running with you mum.'\n\"That was just a phenomenal moment,\" she said.\nPeris reached the semi-finals of the 400m and placed fifth with the other members of Australia's 400m women's relay team.\nPatrick Johnson in the second round of the men's 100m, and pictured at a press conference before the games.\nA Kaanju man from Far North Queensland, Patrick Johnson is the fastest man in Australian Olympic history.\nIt's a record he's held now for 22 years, achieving a 9.93-second 100m run in Mito, Japan in 2003.\nHis talent first spotted at the '96 Australian University Games, Johnson became a Commonwealth Games medal winner, taking out a bronze in the 100m relay in 2002.\nDespite this, and his status as a dual Olympian (having also competed at Athens in 2004), Johnson says the title never sat easy with him.\n“I never saw myself as an athlete, I saw myself as a person,” he said.\n“Who I am is around being back on Country, back in the ocean, back to connecting to Mother Earth and my sense of belonging.”\nNathan Thomas during the men's preliminary match between Australia and Spain at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, held at Ryde Aquatic Centre in Sydney.\nNathan Thomas is another Aboriginal and Islander Hall of Fame member.\nA Tamworth boy, he played over 300 games for the national water polo side, becoming the first Indigenous person to do so.\nThe 2000 Olympics crew put in a valiant fight, making it all the way to the quarter finals, but a 3-7 loss saw them knocked out.\nHe went on to captain the team at Athens in 2004.\nThose exploits saw him also inducted into the Water Polo Hall of Fame in 2023.\nThomas followed the footsteps of many great athletes and turned his attention to coaching after his competitive career, helping the younger polo players of Tamworth starting out.\nHe serves as co-chair of Water Polo Australia's Reconciliation Action Plan working group, and is also on the Australian Olympic Committee’s Indigenous Advisory Committee.\nHenry Collins (blue) boxing Viliami Tau'aika (Tonga) at the 2000 Oceania Boxing Championships in Canberra in May, four months before the Olympics.
