  "body_text": "With the February FIFA window upon us, the U.S. women’s national team is in Florida preparing for the eighth edition of the SheBelieves Cup.\nU.S. Soccer booked three quality teams for the international friendly tournament. Canada, Brazil and Japan should each offer a meaningful test for the USWNT as part of its World Cup preparations. All three opponents have participated in SheBelieves before, and all three will feature at this summer’s big event.\nAdvertisement\nThe pressure will be on the U.S. to pick up definitive wins over all three teams to settle lingering questions around its readiness for the World Cup. But this is also one of the few remaining chances for player evaluation and chemistry building. Balancing the short and long-term goals will be key for head coach Vlatko Andonovski.\nThis year’s SheBelieves Cup consists of three doubleheader game days at three different venues. First, teams head to Exploria Stadium in Orlando, home of the Pride. They move on to Nashville — where the USWNT makes its stadium debut at GEODIS Park — and then return, once again, to Frisco, Texas for the finale at Toyota Stadium.\nThree meaningful games lie ahead, including some instructive looks at three U.S. opponents that all could advance to the knockout stages at the World Cup. In short: buckle in for what should be a very fun SheBelieves Cup. Here’s everything you need to know before the games kick off February 16.\nKeeping Track\nOn The Athletic\nSteph Yang and I will be earning frequent flier miles this month, heading to all three stadiums to bring you coverage from the entire SheBelieves Cup. Follow the USWNT here, and if you’d like to go above and beyond, you can also follow Steph’s work at her author page and my work here.\nIf you need to prepare and missed any of our recent stories, we’ve got a bunch for you to catch up on. The National Women’s Soccer League preseason might just be getting underway, but it’s been busy on the USWNT front since 2023 started.\n- USWNT World Cup roster prediction 4.0: How SheBelieves Cup could impact selections by Meg Linehan and Steph Yang\n- Lynn Williams’ whirlwind return to the pitch: A goal, an apology and a trade by Meg Linehan\n- Sam Coffey finds ways to serve the USWNT in the absence of playing time by Meg Linehan\n- USWNT’s New Zealand trip takeaways: Rose Lavelle, Mallory Swanson star in big wins by Meg Linehan\n- What makes Naomi Girma key for USWNT and an NWSL standout with San Diego by Joseph Lowery\n- USWNT thinking about the past, preparing for the future in New Zealand by Meg Linehan\nSpeaking of this summer, in The Journey to the Cup, The Athletic follows six players as they work towards a place in the 2023 Women’s World Cup. Follow along as we check in with them each month in the build-up to the tournament, tracking their progress as they prepare both mentally and physically for a chance to shine on the game’s biggest stage.\nAdvertisement\nYou can subscribe to Full Time with Meg Linehan via The Athletic site and in the app (which carries the ad-free version of the show), or via Apple, Spotify or wherever else you listen to podcasts.\nOn TV and streams\nIt’s the second round of the USWNT on Warner Bros. Discovery Sports in 2023 — and this time, we’re getting two games on TV. Compared to previous years, the three matches that don’t feature the USWNT will stream on HBO Max instead of U.S. Soccer’s YouTube channel.\nThere will be pregame coverage starting 30 minutes before USWNT matches. The broadcast team for U.S. games includes Luke Wileman on play-by-play, Julie Foudy as analyst and Melissa Ortiz pitch side.\nUSWNT matches will also be available in Spanish via Universo and Peacock.\nAs a part of our recently announced @Telemundo partnership, for the FIRST TIME EVER, 100% of our @USWNT matches will be broadcast live in Spanish. Coverage continues Feb. 16 vs. Canada! pic.twitter.com/W5Fyj2HID1\n— David A. Wright (@DavidWrightUSSF) February 9, 2023\nCanadians can watch Canada’s matches via OneSoccer, but it seems you’ll be out of luck if you want to watch the entire tournament.\nOn social media\nFor our coverage, make sure you’re following @TheAthleticSCCR on Twitter, plus the main account at @TheAthletic. You can also follow @thrace and @itsmeglinehan, and I’ll be snapping photos the whole tournament — so you might see those on The Athletic handles or at my Instagram, or perhaps both!\nFollow the four team/federation accounts: @USWNT, @CANWNT (the better handle to follow now, but @CanadaSoccerEn still has the general feed for Canada Soccer), @SelecaoFeminina for Brazil and @jfa_en is the spot for Japan.\nThere will be the usual gameday hashtags, but also expect content under the #SheBelievesCup, as well.\n“An incredibly important tournament”\nOn USWNT\nThere’s no ignoring that the USWNT will be under pressure to produce three comprehensive performances during SheBelieves Cup, but Canada, Brazil and Japan will each provide their own interesting tests. As much as the national team got value out of traveling to Auckland and Wellington last month and experiencing a dry run of its World Cup group stage in New Zealand, the Ferns posed a very different opponent than what the USWNT will face in February.\nAdvertisement\nAfter announcing the roster, Andonovski told reporters on his usual zoom that the team he has for SheBelieves Cup is not going to be the exact team that boards a plane in July.\n“It will show us where the team is now, but I don’t think it will be a real parameter of where the team is going to be five-and-a-half months from now,” he said earlier this month. “I know we’re going to try different things and test different combinations of players. I’m sure that the same thing will happen with the teams that we’re going to face, so I don’t think it will show the exact level of where the teams are at.”\nOn Wednesday, Alex Morgan said it was “really important” for the USWNT to win the tournament — which would make it the third consecutive SheBelieves Cup trophy.\n“Especially going into the World Cup, this is an incredibly important tournament because it’s the last time that we’re going to get a chance to do three games in a short period of time that sort of replicate in a way, either a group stage or a knockout stage, something where you have consecutive games,” Morgan said.\nIt’s another chance — as Morgan pointed out, the last one of 2023 before the big show — for less experienced players to learn how to manage travel and the fatigue of a tournament setting.\nOn Canada\nThat importance extends to the three other teams participating, too. Canada will be under more scrutiny following their Olympic success in Tokyo, and they would get a massive mental boost from grabbing a result against the U.S. — especially after dropping the final at last summer’s W Championship.\nHead coach Bev Priestman is navigating the FIFA window, announcing a camp roster ahead of the actual matches and knowing that some European players will head back for the games. As she told reporters this month, the training camp and the tournament will essentially be two parts.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s a balancing act of assessment, getting players ready (at camp) who can afford that time away from either not having fixtures or not having been in season,” Priestman said. “Absolutely, (the roster) will be topped up with some of the usual players that this group has been accustomed to.”\nOne of Priestman’s major considerations heading into this summer is navigating the demand on players brought on by constant major tournaments since the Olympics.\n“We’ve seen more injuries, more burnout than we’ve ever seen before,” she said on the Player’s Own Voice podcast.\nFor Canada, the goal is having the “freshest” team, not just when they arrive this summer, but by the time the final rolls around too.\n“In many ways that’s been the downside of Canada,” Priestman said. “We’ve been intense. We’re used to these sort of short, sharp, ‘let’s get it done,’ but when it comes to the tournament where you’ve got to be just as fresh on day 52 as you were on day one, I think that’s going to be the art.”\nFour of the world's top nations battle for hardware at the 2023 #SheBelievesCup, presented by @Visa 🏆\nUSA 🇺🇸\nCanada 🇨🇦\nJapan 🇯🇵\nBrazil 🇧🇷 pic.twitter.com/3AlGhAnRTZ— U.S. Women's National Soccer Team (@USWNT) February 9, 2023\nOn Brazil\nMajor injuries have been a factor for many teams, including the USWNT, but Brazil might have one of the biggest projects reincorporating Marta ahead of the World Cup. She’s been dancing her way through Orlando Pride preseason, but it will be interesting to watch how Brazil manager Pia Sundhage works her back into the mix.\nOverall, Sundhage’s larger project of adding defensive structure, and a little bit of a Swedish feel to Brazil, is still the main thing to keep tabs on, but the USA vs. Brazil match-up could turn into a heavyweight counter-for-counter match-up. Debinha, Kerolin, Geyse will be very, very interesting tests for a USWNT backline ahead of the World Cup.\nAdvertisement\nOn Japan\nAs for Japan, there might be no better team that understands the USWNT’s fall. They also faced off against England and Spain and ended up with two losses (though theirs came in November, not October).\nJapan’s going to have to worry about Spain again in a few months, thanks to their group stage assignment, but in the meantime this is still a version of the Nadeshiko that is light on combined caps. Two veterans are still at the heart of this team: Saki Kumagai (Bayern Munich) and Mana Iwabuchi (Spurs). Both of those names should definitely be familiar to USWNT fans.\nAlmost half of the Japanese midfield has NWSL experience. Fuka Nagano just departed the North Carolina Courage for Liverpool and has made an immediate impact for the WSL side. Hina Sugita and Jun Endo had impressive seasons for the Portland Thorns and Angel City, respectively. Japan gets plenty of credit for being clean on the ball and clinical, but this midfield is also capable of some creativity that could cause every other team at SheBelieves Cup some problems. The Nadeshiko have the lowest FIFA ranking of the four teams, but that doesn’t mean much of anything only a few months before the World Cup.\n(Photo: Brad Smith/ISI Photos)",
