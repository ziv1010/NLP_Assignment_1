  "body_text": "Dame Sarah Storey, who lives with her husband, Barney, and their children in Disley, was one of the six sports stars shortlisted for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2024 award\nTell us about your childhood\nI grew up in Cheshire and went to Disley Primary, where there was a lot of sport on the curriculum. I was always happy to try any sport offered. I was a very outdoorsy kid.\nWhere did your love of sport come from?\nMy mum and dad were both akelas in the Cheadle Hulme scout group and my dad was also the superintendent of our church youth group, so there were always weekends away doing activities, camping, and mini-highland games. We were always very active and loved the outdoors. No one was particularly athletic, we just loved being outside. I remember watching the Olympics in 1984 when I was six and seeing 15-year-old Sarah Hardcastle swim and that’s when I realised there were reasons to do sport, other than just for fun.\nWas there a moment when you believed your disability (Sarah was born without a functioning left hand) wasn’t going to hold you back?\nIt was never an issue for me. I just saw it as, for example, some people have bigger feet than other people; I’ve got one arm longer than the other.\nWho was your role model growing up?\nSarah Hardcastle. I thought, not only is she called Sarah but she also swims, which is one of the things I loved to do, so I looked up to her. Sarah now lives in Australia and one of her daughters is a two-time Olympian\nYou started as a highly accomplished swimmer – what made you shift to cycling?\nSwimming was the first sport that took me to an international level and introduced me to competing at Paralympian events. Previous to that, I competed in able-bodied events, which I continued to do. But I got an ear infection in 2005, so couldn’t swim, and needed something else to do to keep fit. I saw the velodrome and thought, that looks suitably scary, let’s give it a go.\nHow do you prepare for a competition?\nThere’s the physical preparation, which is pretty generic in many ways. As I’ve been competing for 34 years I’ve got a pretty good base fitness but I do have to fine-tune it when I’m getting into competition mode. I then refine my training to complement the specific course and terrain I’m going to be competing on. For example, when I competed in the World Championships in Zurich this year, I could see the terrain was very hilly so my power-to-weight ratio was crucial. That meant I had to balance the amount of muscle I was building because it weighs a lot and I would have to push it uphill. But being heavier means it aids in coming down the hill faster. So it’s important to get the right balance. I also look at the psychological aspects of preparing and differentiating the ‘human’ part of the brain, which makes logical decisions, versus the emotional part of the brain – the ‘chimp part’, as Steve Peters, the author of The Chimp Paradox, would put it, which wants you to be comfortable and can often derail the human brain by talking you out of doing something if you feel nervous. I find it useful to rehearse how I am going to feel in a race and what the opposition might be doing. I like to create a mental tool kit that can prepare for every eventuality.\nCongratulations on your 19th gold medal in Paris this year. You must have a room dedicated to your medals and awards?\nI initially wanted to emulate Sir Steve Redgrave and I got my fifth gold in a row by getting my 18th gold in that time trial. Then I took my 19th medal in what I think was the closest race I’ve ever had to win. Two weeks later I went out to the World Championships and won two more golds. Altogether I have 45 world titles. I don’t have a room dedicated to my medals, I just have them stashed in various socks.\nWhat has been the proudest moment of your career?\nAt the time, I think every moment is the proudest moment because of what I have done to get there. Competing in a home games is a highlight for all athletes. But coming back after having a baby and then coming back again after having my second child was special. Then I think back to my first Paralympic Games (Barcelona 1992) as a 14-year-old – that was a highlight.\nHow did you feel when you found out you had been made a Dame in the 2013 New Year’s Honours List?\nI had to Google what a DBE meant – Dame Commander Order of the British Empire. We had just come back from a holiday in Lanzarote and we had a pile of post, and I then noticed the royal crest on one of the envelopes. The Damehood means an acknowledgment of everything I’ve had to do in my journey and the support of people who have helped me in the ongoing search for the best version of me. It was an acknowledgment of the six Paralympics I had then competed in, which span 24 years, culminating in my wins at the London Olympics in 2012. I am very proud.\nHow did you meet your husband, Barney Storey?\nBarney is a sighted pilot for visually impaired athletes so he is an able-bodied national champion who had the opportunity to pilot the tandem in 2002 and has competed in three Paralympics in that capacity. We met at a training camp when I was a swimmer. We started out as friends and it grew from there.\nWhen you’re not training or competing how do you spend your time?\nWe do a lot of family activities as we have two children: Louisa is 11 and Charlie is seven. We like to catch up with friends or go to the match as we are Man United fans.\nWhat are your plans for Christmas and the new year?\nWe went away last year on a training camp but this year we are going to be at home having a family Christmas. My parents are going to join us and then I suppose we will get a holiday away at some point.\nWhat’s been the best gift you have received from Barney?\nBesides my engagement and wedding rings, it would have to be the Wonder Woman necklace he bought me.\nWhat plans do you have for 2025?\n(Note: Shortly after this interview, Sarah fractured her ankle which sidelined her plans to appear in the upcoming Dancing on Ice series)\nI will probably get back into my cycling training as I have no plans to retire. The difference in the disciplines of cycling and ice skating is interesting – the tucked and compact mode of cycling versus the stretch, elegance and co-ordination of skating. I will also continue supporting the charities I’m passionate about, such as the Children’s Adventure Farm Trust, which is a haven for hundreds of disabled and disadvantaged children and is based in Cheshire. Also Boot Out Breast Cancer, which was set up by Debbie Dowie in 2010, to help support and make a difference to women diagnosed with breast cancer. Finally, the UK Human Milk Bank, which does brilliant work to help ensure babies have access to healthy milk through a donor scheme, which I contributed to in 2017 after I had Charlie. I’m a patron.\nAre your children sporty?\nThey both play cricket. Charlie is also into his BMX and football, and Louisa is a dancer.\nWhere are your three favourite Cheshire places?\nLyme Park is lovely and on the doorstep, I enjoy Macclesfield and I absolutely love cycling around the beautiful Cheshire lanes.\nHow do you look after yourself, physically and mentally?\nProtein shakes after training, collagen supplements, and a night-time powder supplement to help maximise sleep and recovery. I have a high-protein diet with lots of fruit and vegetables. I do lots of breathwork when I do my mobility work, which is similar to yoga. #\nWhat are your three favourite beauty products?\nI really like the Elemis Pro Collagen Rose Cleansing Balm as it’s like a fast facial. I pop it on before I get into the shower and the water turns it to a milk. Your skin feels lovely after using it. BareMinerals Tinted Moisturiser is so easy to use and it feels light on the skin, and I apply Elemis Pro Collagen SPF 50 before my makeup every day.\nWhat advice would you give to your younger self?\nProbably the advice that I was given: follow your path and don’t worry about what other people think.\nThis article was originally published in Cheshire Life.
