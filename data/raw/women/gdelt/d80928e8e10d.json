She steps into the captain role due to an injury sidelining Leah Williamson.\nLucy Bronze and Alex Greenwood, among the 23 players named, are set to participate in their third consecutive World Cup. The pair were part of the squad that secured a bronze medal in 2015.\n\"I have huge belief in this squad and we're very fortunate to be selecting a fantastic group of players to travel to Australia,\" said Wiegman, a Netherlands native who assumed leadership of Team England in 2021.\nThe upcoming World Cup is scheduled to take place from July 20 to August 20 in Australia and New Zealand. England shares Group D with Haiti, Denmark, and China.\n\"We know we will face tough challenges from strong teams, and we will have to be competitive from the first match on 22 July,\" said Wiegman. \"We will do everything to be at our very best again this summer. \"\nFour years prior, Wiegman guided the Netherlands to the World Cup final, but the team fell to the United States, 2-0.
