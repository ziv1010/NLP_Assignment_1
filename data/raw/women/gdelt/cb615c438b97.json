  "body_text": "I Run For Her, one of the major annual fundraising initiatives of Newcastle based domestic and family violence advocates - Got Your Back Sista - returns for its sixth year with walks and runs hosted across Australia on Sunday 12 October.\nToday - Got Your Back Sista announces the appointment of their 2025 I Run For Her Ambassadors, including National Ambassador and professional VFLW North Melbourne star-player, Courtney Ugle, and Hunter Local Ambassador and DV advocate and tiktoker, Paige Bush. You can preview the 2025 campaign video here.\nCourtney Ugle is a proud Noongar woman who moved to Melbourne following the loss of both her parents to tragic circumstances at a young age. It's there she discovered football as a form of therapy, which has since transformed her life.\nWhen Courtney was 19, her forty-two-year-old mother was murdered by her abusive partner. Courtney is now a voice for people with 'lived experience' of Domestic Violence and has founded her own social enterprise - Waangkiny. Now a tireless advocate for DV awareness in Victoria, Courtney has committed to working with Got Your Back Sista to take I Run For Her to a national level and continue her plight for increased awareness. She will also be hosting a Melbourne walk as part of the fundraising campaign on 12 October.\n\"Domestic violence has devastated my family in the most heartbreaking way - I lost my mum to it. That pain never leaves, but it drives me to use my voice and my story to stand up for other women and children. That's why I Run for Her is deeply personal to me, because every step we take in I Run for Her is a step towards safety, healing, and hope for survivors of domestic violence, and for those still fighting to find safety and freedom,\" explains Courtney Ugle of her plight.\n\"Already this year, 32 women in Australia have been murdered by a current or former partner, and countless more women and children continue to live in fear and endure abuse. These are not just numbers - they are mothers, grandmothers, daughters, aunties, sisters, and children whose lives matter.\n\"I Run for Her is our community's stand to come together and say enough is enough: to run, walk, or move in solidarity with people who have experienced domestic and family violence,\" said Got Your Back Sista Founder, Melissa Histon.\n\"Every woman has a right to live free from fear and violence. I Run for Her is more than just a community event — it's a movement to stand up for women who are silenced, to show them they are not alone, and to raise vital funds so we can provide life-changing programs and give them the support they need to rebuild their lives with dignity and hope.\n\"I Run for Her gives all of us - men, women, families - the chance to speak out for those who can't, to champion their strength, and to create a safer future for every woman and child,\" adds Histon.\n\"I'm so passionate about standing alongside Got Your Back Sista as an Ambassador for I Run for Her because I believe in the power of community to create change, and I want every woman and child to know they deserve to live free from violence and thrive in a life filled with love and dignity,\" says Courtney Ugle.\n\"This campaign gives us all the chance to unite, raise our voices, and show women and children living in fear that they are not alone,\" adds Ugle.\nThe format of the I Run For Her event is incredibly flexible. Participants can pick their own location, start time and distance, and even manage their own fundraising efforts. Individuals, friends, businesses, schools and community organisations are encouraged to register now to host a walk or run. Registrants will then be sent a special commemorative purple print I Run For Her 'Say NO to domestic violence' t-shirt, the colour purple a nod to International Women's Day and the women's right to freedom movement. The hope is that every participant will don the t-shirt on 12 October and one step at a time, walk or run towards this event becoming a national, if not global initiative.\nAll funds raised will help Got Your Back Sista to provide one-on-one individual support, resources, and life-changing programs for women who have suffering domestic and family violence. Thanks to Courtney and Paige as well as the generosity of sponsors, Got Your Back Sista is excited to share today's campaign launch video.\nThe 2025 I Run For Her presenting partner is the MacDougall Foundation. Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group, One Rail Australia, Allambi Care, Hicksons and Hunt & Hunt Lawyers, New Era, and City of Newcastle are this year's generous sponsors, and community partners include HIC Services, Charlestown Square, and City of Maitland.\nVisit irunforher.com to register a fundraising walk or run, or to join a team.
