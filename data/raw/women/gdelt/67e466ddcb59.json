I think we have so many girls sitting at home watching us. They wanted to play here. They got injured really badly, and it makes a team sticking together even more,\" she said.\n\"We go for each other, and I get goosebumps. It's just amazing and I'm so, so proud of that\nresult, but again we have a second leg next week and we want to go to the final.\"\n\"I think what we could see in the past, we do feel really confident at the Emirates playing in\nfront of our fans so I think it'll give us an extra boost. I think also a little advantage for us, I\ndo hope the fans can carry us throughout the game.\"\nWhile the second leg not only promises some incredible football pitting Arsenal against the reigning German champions, but the clash will take place in front of a sell-out crowd at the Emirates.\nRead the latest Women's Champions League news here\nTickets have quickly been snapped up after first going on sale after the quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich, which itself drew a record attendance of 21,307. The highest crowd for an Arsenal women's game at the Emirates is 47,367 - a WSL record which was set against Tottenham in the autumn.\nReminiscing on what women's football has achieved, Walti revealed what playing in front of\na sell-out crowd would feel like.\n“Amazing. I mean that's what we are all dreaming of since we were kids, to play in front of sold-out stadiums and at Arsenal in a home stadium haven't happened before so something really special for us,\" she said.\n\"I think it's just so exciting. I think we're still not used to playing in front of so many people,\nso it is a very special location for us and really exciting to have, hopefully the whole stadium\nbehind us. To hear them, the noise, it's going to give us that extra boost we hopefully need\nto go in the final.\n\"We want to go to the final. If you're that close, we're going to do everything to make it\npossible.\"",
