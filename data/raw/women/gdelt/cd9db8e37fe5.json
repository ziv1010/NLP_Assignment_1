We might be debutants and considered underdogs, but we are ready to fight. Let the battle begin.”\nIiyambo says her squad is a good mix of younger and more experienced players.\n“COSAFA allows us to bring 21 players, and in our squad we have both youth and experience,” she says. “In fact, we have one of the oldest players in the Namibian league, over 40, who brings invaluable guidance on the field. At the other end, our youngest player is just 15 years old, with two or three others in that age range.\n“We also have a few with international experience. Overall, it’s a team full of life, ready to fight and stand together.”\nThe owner/coach also explains the history of the side since its formation 22 years ago.\n“Beauties FC was formed in 2003 from the merger of two secondary schools in two districts, originally called Okahandja Beauties. We quickly rose to prominence, winning everything in the national league until 2011.\n“After that, there was a brief decline, we even lost to our junior team in 2012, and then football came to a standstill for a while. We returned after COVID but didn’t win anything until now.\n“This club has always been known for agility, resilience, and producing national team players. In the past, eight or nine of the (national team) starting 11 might have been from Beauties. I took over in 2015 after returning from studies in Europe.”\nCOSTA DO SOL HOPE SUN SHINES ON THEIR CAMPAIGN\nCosta do Sol return for a third year running at the CAF Women’s Champions League | COSAFA Qualifiers having last competed in 2023 and will look to improve on their third place finish two years ago.\nThis time round they have been drawn in Group C with Herentals Queens from Zimbabwe and Olympic de Moroni of Comoros, giving them an opportunity perhaps to advance to the semifinals again.\nThey debuted in 2022, but it was a tough introduction to the regional competition for the side from Mozambique.\nThey were in Group A along with home favourites Mamelodi Sundowns, who beat them 8-1 in the opener. But Costa do Sol improved in their second match, showing much more fight and organisation as they went down 2-0 to Double Action Ladies from Botswana.\nA year later they were back and showed much more quality as they finished runners-up in their pool.\nThey started with a 2-1 win over Young Buffaloes from Eswatini, before defeating Olympic de Moroni by the same scoreline. They will meet the latter again this year.\nTheir final pool game was a 4-0 loss to Sundowns, but they had done enough to book a semifinal. There they lost 2-0 to Double Action Ladies, but they edged defending champions Green Buffaloes from Zambia 2-1 to take the bronze medal.\nThey did not qualify in 2024, but have several players with good memories of success in this competition and will bring this experience into the competition.\nTOURNAMENT FINISHES\n2024 – Did not qualify\n2023 – Third\n2022 – Group Stage\n2021 – Did not enter\nGOALSCORERS\n2 goals – Goia, Maconho\n1 goal – Cazemba, Janeiro, Ninika\nRECORDS AND SEQUENCES\nBiggest win: 2-1 vs Young Buffaloes (2023), 2-1 vs Olympic de Moroni (2023), 2-1 vs Green Buffaloes (2023)\nHeaviest defeat: 1-8 vs Mamelodi Sundowns (2022)\nHighest scoring match: 1-8 vs Mamelodi Sundowns (2022)\nLongest winning run: 2 games (31-08-23 to 02-09-23)\nLongest losing run: 2 games (from 07-08-22 to 11-08-22; from 04-09-23 to 06-09-23)\nLongest unbeaten run: 2 games (31-08-23 to 02-09-23)\nLongest run without a win: 2 games (from 07-08-22 to 11-08-22; from 04-09-23 to 06-09-23)\nTotal clean sheets: 0 matches (0%)\nTotal failed to score: 3 matches (43%)\nMost goals scored in a competition: 6 (2023)\nMost goals conceded in a competition: 10 (2022)\nGroup stage wins: 2 out of 5 (40%)\nKnockout stage wins: 1 out of 2 (50%)",
