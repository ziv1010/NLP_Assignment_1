Get Me Out Of Here! in a bid to make a huge TV comeback - with the ITV fee said to be a record-breaker.\nColeen Rooney is reportedly set for a sensational TV return, as she's allegedly inked a deal with ITV's hit show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!\nSources say Coleen is expected to pocket an eye-watering fee that eclipses what ITV previously doled out to stars like Caitlyn Jenner and even the whopping £1.5million they shelled out for Nigel Farage. Insiders suggest showrunners are eager for Coleen, 38, to spill the beans on her life with Wayne Rooney and divulge details from the high-profile Wagatha Christie case involving Rebekah Vardy.\nThe Liverpool lass will be jetting off to Australia next month, braving the infamous Bushtucker Trials to win meals for her campmates.\n\"I'm A Celeb bosses have pulled off a huge coup getting Coleen for the jungle this year and the team are thrilled to have her on board,\" an insider revealed to The Sun on Sunday. Coleen, together with her children, is understood to be a fervent fan of the series, and they eagerly watch every season to see celebrities abandon their plush surroundings for the rugged Australian wilderness.\n\"Coleen has a huge fanbase and she won massive plaudits for her classy handling of the Wagatha Christie case. She's excited to show fans a different side to her and prove she can survive without her creature comforts,\" an insider revealed to the publication. Showrunners are convinced that Coleen will be a hit with audiences and dominate over Rebekah Vardy in their on-going saga, reports the Mirror.\nRebekah Vardy, spouse of football ace Jamie Vardy, took part in the same series in 2017 but was among the first to be evicted, leaving in floods of tears after getting heartfelt messages from her children and husband Jamie, whom she had been missing intensely.\nWhile participating in the series, Rebekah found herself embroiled in a controversial dispute where she, along with Amir Khan and Jamie Lomas, faced allegations of bullying Iain Lee someone she slammed as being \"fake\". Upon chatting with hosts Ant and Dec following her departure, she expressed: \"I have had the most amazing time but I am so glad to get out of there. What a great bunch of people and I will never forget it.\n\"It's harder than I ever anticipated, the feeling of being completely separated form the outside world was nothing I have ever experienced. I thought we were going to get backhanders, bananas and energy bars but you don't. And I am sick of rice and beans.\n\"I have learnt that I am so miserable and cranky sometimes and I can kill looks that literally kill but I have learnt how to be compassionate. You have all got to be there for each other and support each other. I have definitely become more tolerant.\"\nIn the aftermath of their Wagatha Christie saga, Rebekah Vardy's legal team has accused Coleen Rooney of \"deliberately deceiving\" the court regarding the hefty £1.8 million court costs. The drama continues as former 'I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!\nRebekah was slapped with a bill requiring her to cover 90% of Coleen's legal feesa sum that landed after losing the much-publicised 2020 libel case.\nThe litigation storm rages on, with Rebekah this week instructed to pay an additional £100,000 to Coleen after their widely-reported defamation conflict. Coleen had publicly alleged that Rebekah disclosed her private information to journalists.\nSubsequently, a determination decreed that Rebekah must foot the bill for 90% of Coleen's expenses, initially involving an upfront cost of £800,000. Adding to the financial fallout, the recent mandate from judge Andrew Gordon-Saker compels Rebekah to settle another payment of £100,000 within a 21-day window.\nAfter this week's court developments, a confidant of Rebekah disclosed to OK! magazine her ongoing dispute with Coleen.\nThe source divulged: \"Becky can't help herself and she is determined to get the final say in all of this. She is still furious that the judge ruled in Coleen's favour initially, as she insists she didn't do it. She's upset at this latest ruling, but she's not letting it get her down as she's determined Coleen and her team won't get away with this.\"\nColeen Rooney has been thrust into the media glare post-trial, with the premiere of The Real Wagatha Story on Disney Plus detailing the scandal with input from her and husband Wayne Rooney, aged 38. Her recent appearances include Vogue and penning the book 'My Account'.\nSpeculation abounds over who will face this year's Bushtucker challenges. Names tipped for the jungle include Loose Women panellist Jane Moore, former Republic of Ireland frontman Mick McCarthy, and Harry Clark of The Traitor fame.\nReports last month suggested that Max Whitlock, the retired artistic gymnast, was in negotiations with the producers of ITV's jungle challenge, with discussions reportedly \"ongoing\". Meanwhile, Tulisa Contostavlos, erstwhile X Factor judge, is rumoured to be poised for a high-profile comeback on this year's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!",
