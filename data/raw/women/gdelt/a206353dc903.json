  "body_text": "The Bachelor Season Premiere Recap 1/7/19\nOriginally posted on January 7, 2019 @ 11:56 pm\nTonight is the season premiere of The Bachelor on ABC. Colton Underwood, the self-proclaimed virgin, football player and charity worker, will start his journey of finding love. Thirty women will vie for his heart, but only one will remain standing and possibly engaged to our leading man.\nWe open with Chris Harrison channeling Phil Donahue, which I thought only happened in the finales, but whatever, I will go with it.\nMany Bachelor alumni are hosting parties all across the country. We even get an inside look at one in Michigan with Blake and Jason…so we can be reminded of the fact that Colton is a virgin. If I took a shot every time this is mentioned tonight, I would be dead.\nNow we are in Dallas, Texas with Kaitlin and JoJo….and Chris’s mom. Okay, that was kind of cute. We learn he was a precocious, yet cute kid. He quips that they are all in a bar on live TV, so what can possibly go wrong.\nKrystal and Chris are in LA acting all sweet and in love.\nAshley and Jared are in Utah and once again discuss Colton’s virginity. Ten minutes and it’s been mentioned twice.\nWe get to some videos of the girls.\nCassie is a beach loving speech pathologist who is also in grad school.\nHannah is from Alabama and a former beauty queen. She admits she is a train wreck and hot mess. She even does a cheer for him and is WAYYYYY too excited that he is a virgin.\nVirginity mention: 3\nKatie is a dancer who wants a long lasting love, just like her parents.\nHeather is a fellow virgin who has never been kissed. She actual met Colton for a whopping 15 seconds.\nI’ll count this as virginity mention #4.\nOneyeka admits she is loud and obnoxious and a lot to handle….but she has a big heart. She says she will bring out all the tricks to get Colton’s virginity…and if he gives it to her. Okay then!\nVirginity mention: 5\nNicole is bilingual who wants the real deal. She helps take care of her autistic brother.\nKirpa is a dental hygienist. She tells her patients she is going on the show and I will bet a million dollars that they don’t care and are pissed their appointment is being filmed.\nDemi is super bubbly, outgoing and sassy. She lives at home and never had a serious relationship. Wait…they allowed her to film her talking to her mom in PRISON? I know it is over the phone, but isn’t that…illegal? She also thinks it is concerning that he is a virgin and talks about how it is like trying ice cream and cupcakes. What? I not only want ice cream and cupcakes, but am thinking of that episode of the Golden Girls where Dorothy asks Rose what she would think if Miles wanted to try her cupcakes, which are moist and delicious.\nVirginity mention: 6\nWe are back with Jason and Blake. Kendall and Siena crash the party to surprise the hosts.\nCue Colton’s shirtless montage. He works out and talks about his journey and life. Football helped him come into his own. He was heartbroken after breaking up with Becca.\nOMG, is Chris trying to give him the sex talk? This is awkward.\nVirginity mention: 7\nBack to the parties, one of which has virgin cocktails to honor the virgin.\nVirginity mention: 8\nChris asks if Colton lose his virginity, get engaged or leave heartbroken.\nBachelor kids….so cute. This is kind of creepy with all the Bachelor references.\nDid someone seriously ask their daughter if she wanted to be the Bachelorette? I’m running on very little sleep and mass amounts of caffeine to get me through this, but WTF did I just watch?\nChris catches up with Krystal and ‘Goose,’ who reveal they are having a baby—-PUPPY!\nAlexis is now with Kaitlin and JoJo.\nSome random couple gets engaged at Ashley and Jared’s party. Who are these people?\nVirginity mention: 9–due to the sign in the background of the party offering to take his virginity.\nWells says Colton is probably praying Tia isn’t there.\nWhy does Colton look like he is heading to his execution instead of the mansion?\nChris is there for one more pep talk. Sweet baby justice, can we get on with this already. We still have two hours!\nLimo entrances:\nDemi: She hasn’t dated a virgin since she was 12…and that is….I have no words. Also? 1980 called, they want their neon outfit back.\nTayisha: Loves his big….heart.\nHeather: She thinks he is rare and tosses her hair more than Willow Smith.\nNicole: Talks to him in Spanish.\nCaeylnn: Wears a sash with Miss North Carolina on one side and Miss Underwood on the other.\nSydney: Quit her job for him.\nElyse: Is nervous\nTahzjuan: Her dress is gorgeous and she tells him her name is hard to spell and pronounce.\nCassie: Gives him dead butterflies.

I think it is her voice.\nVirgin mention: 14-18….several girls mentioned it and Erika grills him as to WHY he is a virgin. He wants to wait for the right person and put work before a personal life.\nErika looks like a live action Elsa from Frozen.\nMost of the mingling is kind of boring.\nCaeylnn gets the first kiss….and she says he kisses well for a virgin.\nVirgin mention: 19\nFirst impression rose time!
