  "body_text": "Good Monday morning. This is Rosa Prince with Eleni Courea traveling back from the G20 and Dan Bloom at the TUC in Liverpool.\nDRIVING THE DAY\nWESTMINSTER IN SHOCK: MPs return to Westminster after the weekend in a state of shock at news of an alleged spy in their midst. A ministerial statement or urgent question is all but certain following the Sunday Times’ revelation that a parliamentary researcher with links to senior Conservatives had been arrested on suspicion of spying for China. The news overshadowed Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s return from India, where he attended the G20 — the PM will make a statement on the outcome of the summit this afternoon.\nFirst read this: The Times is today the first paper to publish an actual name linked to the alleged spy scandal. No comment as yet from the person named. Several papers report that some MPs had threatened to use parliamentary privilege to out the suspect.\nThen hear this: Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch is on the morning broadcast round and is bound to be quizzed about what ministers knew and when.\n**A message from Intuit: Small businesses are the first to be affected by difficult macroeconomic conditions. The Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index provides unique, up-to-date insights into the small business economy and is a powerful tool for economists, policymakers, and small businesses. Read more here.**\nWhat you need to know: The 20-something researcher was arrested in March under the Official Secrets Act alongside another man in his 30s. Both were released on police bail until October. The alleged spy has links to hawkish Conservative MPs who are privy to classified information including Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Alicia Kearns and Security Minister Tom Tugendhat.\nNarrow escape: The Times team led by Senior Investigations Reporter Billy Kenber say of the researcher: “He became active on Westminster’s social scene and used a dating website, making several attempts last year to arrange a date with a political journalist.” The Sun’s Noa Hoffman claims to have had a narrow escape.\nOnly the start: Could there be more to come? The Telegraph reckons intelligence services will “unmask” more Chinese spies in coming months, raising the prospect that a “network” of spooks is operating out of Westminster.\nWhat the PM has said: Sunak raised the case with Chinese Premier Li Qiang at a brush-by meeting at the G20 on Sunday morning. Just before embarking on the return flight to London, the PM told broadcasters that he relayed “very strong concerns” about Beijing’s potential interference in parliament. Playbook’s Eleni Courea was on the trip and has been sending in the latest.\nThis also raises questions for: Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, whose decision to travel to China in late August will come into question.\nCabinet splits: The Times’ Steven Swinford reports that Home Secretary Suella Braverman and Tugendhat are keen to see China designated as an official threat to Britain’s “safety and interests” under new national security laws. They are said to be opposed by the Foreign Office and Treasury, over fears for the impact on trade of requirements under the plans for anyone working “at the direction” of China or state-linked Chinese companies to register with the U.K. government.\nBan them: China should be barred from attending Sunak’s November AI summit, China hawk Iain Duncan Smith tells the Mail.\nMORE FROM THE G20: Speaking to journalists traveling with him in India, Sunak refused to commit to retaining the pensions triple lock in the next Tory manifesto. The Express’ Steph Spyro has a write-up. The Sun points out that Justice Secretary Alex Chalk didn’t quite seem on board with this on the Sunday shows.\nAS FOR THE SUMMIT ITSELF: Read this piece by the POLITICO team on the ground on how the G20 stripped out accusations against Russia from the communiqué in order to arrive at a consensus. The leaders settled on language drafted by officials from India, Brazil and South Africa — G20 hosts present and future — calling on member states to “refrain from action against the territorial integrity and sovereignty or political independence of any state.”\nBut but but: Sunak will face questions during his Commons update about why the U.K. was not part of a new India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor agreed at the G20. Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy said: “It is extraordinary that U.K. has been left out.”\nFROM SUMMIT TO SUMMIT: In her wrap of Sunak’s G20 trip, Eleni has written about how the PM used the opportunity to drum up international interest in the landmark AI safety summit which the U.K. is hosting in November. “He sees it as one of his long-term legacy pieces,” a government adviser tells her. “Shaping the world’s response to a paradigm-shifting technology would be a big deal — and it would be recognised as a big deal.” A second government official said that Sunak “never misses a chance” to bring up AI.\nFun fact: At one point when Sunak was recording a pool clip in the summit venue his team had to position him to make sure the Russian flag wasn’t in the background.\nHIS TURN: It’s over to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, who is now in Delhi for an “economic and financial dialogue” with his counterpart Nirmala Sitharaman, the first between the U.K. and India since 2017.\nRuh roh: The Sun’s highly esteemed Trevor Kavanagh has a new nickname for Sunak: “Dr Dolittle.” “Rishi is rolled up in a defensive ball while Labour piles in with hobnail boots,” he complains in his column today. That’s gonna hurt inside No. 10.\nTHOUGHTS ARE WITH: Grant Shapps, who will miss the first departmental questions since his appointment as defense secretary, due to take place at 2.30 p.m, as his father Tony is critically ill.\nBREXIT REDUX\nEVERYTHING IS AWESOME: New Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho will meet her Irish counterpart Eamon Ryan in Whitehall today to sign new agreements on energy cooperation. The deal will see an agreement on energy transition and security of supply.\nEverything is Brexit: Britain had long operated these commitments as part of the European Union’s “solidarity rules” — the new agreements will confirm that the arrangement will continue now the U.K. has left the bloc.\nEverything is climate: A second agreement will commit Britain and Ireland to work together to reach net zero.\nBUT BUT BUT: A survey by the British Chambers of Commerce and published in the FT shows more than 80 percent of small- and medium-sized businesses are unprepared for the “avalanche” of new EU regulations and taxes bearing down on them in coming months and years as Brexit fully kicks in.\nWAIT, WHAT? Laura Kuenssberg has a great scoop in the first episode of her new series, State of Chaos, about Brexit and the strains it put on our political system. Simon McDonald, former head civil servant at the Foreign Office, informed fellow officials and ministers on the morning after the referendum that he had voted to remain, in potential breach of civil service neutrality rules.\nThere’s more: The show also confirms rumors for the first time that conversations took place in government about Remainer David Lidington replacing Theresa May as PM with a pledge to hold a second referendum.\nAnd more: Laura also speaks to ministers about their response to Boris Johnson’s and Dominic Cummings’ cunning ruse to prorogue parliament to stop the Commons blocking Brexit. The program airs at 9 p.m. tonight and is available now on BBC iPlayer.\nLABOUR LAND\nTALKING THERAPY: Labour leader Keir Starmer and Shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson are visiting a school in Dagenham this morning, where they’ll watch a pupil debate, as part of his policy of encouraging oracy in schools.\nAnd talking of schools: Starmer has given an interview to the Jewish News in which he says Labour in power would be “even more supportive of faith schools” than the Tories. “I want to promote the idea of a family of schools where we are not pitting schools against each other, not faith schools versus other schools, and actually where schools are all supporting each other,” he said.\nThriving here: Starmer also backed Phillipson’s policy of ending private school tax breaks, but insisted he wanted independent schools to “thrive.” And he said work is needed to address the rise of antisemitism in schools, colleges and universities.\nSTARMER <3 THE UNIONS? After responding to Rishi Sunak’s G20 statement in the afternoon, Starmer heads to Liverpool to dine with more than 50 trade union bigwigs at a four-star hotel, my Playbook colleague Dan Bloom writes from day two of TUC Congress. One union official says the private “family dinner” will see general-secretaries and Starmer gently roast each other, before (says another) “they all shake hands.”\nWhich is a nifty metaphor … for their relationship ahead of Labour conference (at the same venue next month) and the election. The unions’ policies clearly push further than Labour — with motions on free school meals for all primary pupils, and “index-linked pay restoration” for the public sector already passing. But most unions are picking their battles carefully to avoid exposing splits. “Progressives are perennially disappointed with the Labour Party,” one general-secretary tells Dan. “But it’s better to be disappointed with the Labour Party in government.”\nStanding out: Unite General-Secretary Sharon Graham, who took a swing at “Nineties tribute act” Labour on Sunday, has her speech this afternoon. Sky’s Jon Craig reports she will not attend tonight’s dinner, while Rail, Maritime and Transport Union General-Secretary Mick Lynch will.\nCOMING ATTRACTION: Labour’s National Policy Forum document, agreed in July, is being published very soon. TUC eyes will be on the wording around its “New Deal” for workers. Graham has already slammed reports (first in the FT) that it was watered down. Two officials tell Dan that Starmer wrote to union leaders to reassure them.\nAnother interesting point: A Unite motion today calls on Labour to “repeal all anti-trade union laws within 12 months of gaining office.” Playbook is told that includes those passed under Thatcher — which goes a fair whack further than Labour’s policy. It’s expected to pass, but a senior union official said they don’t expect it to actually happen.\nI FOUGHT THE LAW: Today’s big event is a vote on “non-compliance” with Tory plans for minimum service levels for striking workers. Lynch — who will give a mid-afternoon speech — tells Dan: “We can’t comply with a law that may be regarded internationally as illegal.”\nThe government says … the minimum service levels law is to “protect the lives and livelihoods of the general public.”\nSCOOP — CONFERENCE STRIKE? Lynch refused to rule out planning a rail strike during Conservative conference, like last year. “That is a possibility in the time frame,” he told Dan. “Our members look for the most effective prosecution of the strike. And whether the Tory conference is part of that factor, I haven’t spent too much time thinking about it, but that will be a part of it because it’s in two or three weeks’ time.” Lynch also could not rule out strikes continuing another 13 months to an October 2024 election if neither side backs down.\nTODAY IN LIVERPOOL: TUC General-Secretary Paul Nowak speaks around 11 a.m., when he’ll claim “nothing works in this country” because “everyone sat on their arses.” Gillian Keegan’s check is in the post.\n**Listen in on conversations with global power players with Power Play, a brand-new global podcast by POLITICO. Renowned host Anne McElvoy takes you into the minds of those shifting power, policy and politics across the globe, starting this September. Sign up here to be notified of the first episodes.**\nTODAY IN WESTMINSTER\nIN THE DOGHOUSE: Home Secretary Suella Braverman commissioned “urgent advice” on banning American XL Bully dogs, labeling the breed a “clear and lethal danger” as she shared a Mail article showing a dog mauling an 11-year-old girl in Birmingham over the weekend. In a rare moment of agreement, Braverman’s call splashes the Mirror (as part of its campaign calling for action on dangerous dogs,) and also leads the Sun. Defra however will decide whether to ban the breed.\nJAIL BREAK LATEST: Jeremy Hunt raised concerns about “extremely worrying” conditions and low staff morale at Wandsworth Prison to the jail’s governor and Prisons Minister Damian Hinds after being contacted by a constituent who was serving time there, the Telegraph’s Charles Hymas reports. His letter came in August, weeks before now recaptured terror suspect Daniel Khalife snuck out by clinging to the underside of a food delivery truck.\nDEAR CHANCELLOR: New Shadow Chief Secretary Darren Jones has written to Hunt demanding clarity over reports he had been urged to introduce an “inflation tax” of 100 percent on salary increases above 3 percent.\nSUICIDE PREVENTION: The government launches its National Suicide Prevention Strategy containing more than 100 measures aimed at saving lives as it pledges to reduce England’s suicide rate within 2.5 years.\nVOW OF JUSTICE: Justice Secretary Alex Chalk vowed to do everything to keep the family and friends of the late Joanna Simpson safe as Robert Brown, who was acquitted of murder having admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, is due to be released on license in November after 13 years in jail — the Sun has a writeup.\nHACKS REJOICE: Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer attends the inaugural meeting of the task force dedicated to tackling Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation — which aim to financially exhaust those seeking to expose wrongdoing. The task force contains media organizations including the Society of Editors and the National Union of Journalists.\nONE HUNDRED DAYS OF WAITING: Over a third of crimes are taking more than 100 days to charge, analysis of Home Office figures found. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said victims are being “badly let down” — the Mirror’s Lizzy Buchan has the exclusive.\nPOLICE SCANDAL: Three-quarters of police officers and staff accused of violence against women are not suspended by their force, according to a joint investigation by the Refuge charity and the Independent. Crossbench peer Louise Casey, who authored a damning review of the Met Police, said “Officers accused of violence against women should be immediately suspended pending investigation” — Maya Oppenheim has the story. In an Independent op-ed, Shadow Home Office Minister Jess Phillips said “Now is the time for the home secretary [Suella Braverman] to actually be tough, rather than just acting like she is.”\nTHEY’LL BE WATCHING YOU: Ten of Britain’s biggest retailers including John Lewis, the Co-op and Tesco agreed to fund a police operation cracking down on shoplifting by scanning shoplifters’ faces. The Times has a write-up, with the issue raised in the Observer and Mail on Sunday over the weekend.\nSNP INDEPENDENCE: Expelled SNP MP Angus MacNeil has no path back to the party’s Commons group, Westminster leader Stephen Flynn appeared to hint.

Newsweek’s Alex Hudson got the Bats’ innings going while Downing Street’s Director of Strategy, Jamie Njoku-Goodwin provided strong support to ensure the team was in a decent position around the halfway mark. Then the Plastics unearthed a pair of bowlers who proved too quick for the addled hacks and the team succumbed to a total of 135, all out after 29 of the allotted 35 overs. The three current Lobby journos in the XI — the Mail on Sunday’s Dan Hodges, the Sun’s Jack Elsom and the i’s Hugo Gye — mustered up just two runs between them.
