Three years later, the\nGovernment created the Redfern-Waterloo Authority Act 2004 No 107 and, in\nJanuary 2005, the Redfern-Waterloo Authority was established.\nSince then, this partnership has\nhelped changed not only the face of Redfern-Waterloo, but the perception of the\narea by the wider community and, in February 2010, independent data was\nreleased showing a reduction in local crime combined with solid increases in\nhousing prices over the last two years.\n“What we are seeing in Redfern\nand Waterloo now are the results of a strong partnership between Government and\nthe community, including local Aboriginal leaders, creating thriving and safe\nsuburbs,” the NSW Premier Ms Keneally said when presenting the data with Police\nMinister Michael Daley.\nKey highlights for Redfern-Waterloo in 2009 – 2010:\n- Then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd\nofficiated at the opening of Australia’s one-of-a-kind Aboriginal youth arts,\ncultural & education facility, the National Centre for Indigenous Excellence;\n- Prince William met with\nAboriginal leaders at Redfern’s The Block during a three day visit to\nAustralia;\n- Yaama Dhiyaan – Australia’s\nonly hospitality training centre specialising in Indigenous cuisine –\ncelebrated its third year of success;\n- In just seven short months, the\nEveleigh Farmers’ Market was awarded Sydney’s best;\n- Australian Technology Park\nwelcomed 2,000 new employees with the opening of the new television & media\ncomplex;\n- The state-of-the-art Redfern\nCommunity Health Centre opened to service the needs of clients in the areas of\nmental health, drug, alcohol & HIV services and health nursing; and\n- The Aboriginal Housing\nCompany’s Pemulwuy Project Concept Plan for the redevelopment of The Block was\napproved.\nA range of partnerships between\nthe RWA and the community continue to focus on local issues, while The Greater\nSydney Partnership – a marketing alliance spearheaded by founding Chairman\nPeter Holmes à Court – selected Redfern as the location to launch its exciting\ninitiative in April, 2010. The partnership aims to further enhance the\ninterests of Sydney as Australia’s only true global city.\nOn Sunday, 7th February, 2010,\nmore than 5,000 fans braved inclement weather to watch the Rabbitohs in a\npre-season game against the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles at the Australian\nTechnology Park Performance Centre. The match was described as their “return to\nRedfern” and they certainly didn’t disappoint, thumping home to a 42 to 12\nvictory.\nManagement of Australian Technology\nPark, which is one of the RWA’s strategic development sites, recently became a\nsenior partner of the Rabbitohs and also undertook sponsorship of the\nRabbitoh’s charitable arm, Souths Cares. The former Redfern Oval has been\nrenamed the ATP Performance Centre as part of the two-year sponsorship deal.\nSouths Cares assists\ndisadvantaged youth and their families in the South Sydney region through\neducation, training and employment programs and players are taking an active,\nhighly visible role within the local community in support of Souths Cares.\nRabbitohs Chief Executive and\nSouths Cares Board Member Shane Richardson said: “The Australian Technology\nPark is one of the leading organisations in the heart of the South Sydney\ndistrict, so for Souths Cares to have an opportunity to partner with them was\nan opportunity that we jumped at.\n“Our players and staff have made\na big impact on the local community and having the backing of the Australian\nTechnology Park will allow us to take the next steps with the Teachers’ Aide\nand Workplace Mentoring programs which are touching our people now.\n“We’re providing our players\nwith the best training facilities, as well as our community with the best\nsupport through Souths Cares’ programs, all with the backing of the Australian\nTechnology Park.”\nThe RWA brokered 10 jobs for\nIndigenous workers on the upgrade of the former Redfern Oval through the City\nOf Sydney’s Aboriginal Employment projects.\nThe RWA, of course, supports\nlocal sporting groups and associations at a grass roots level including the\nRedfern All Blacks and Waterloo Storm in the Koori Knockout.\nThe financial year began with the\nformer Planning Minister, and now Premier, the Hon Kristina Keneally announcing\napproval in July 2009 of the $60m Pemulwuy Project Concept Plan for The Block\n– a project capable of delivering 300 jobs, 62 homes and over 9,000sqm of\ncommercial uses, shops and community and cultural space.\nThe State Government and the\nDepartment of Planning worked closely with the Aboriginal Housing Company (AHC)\nthroughout the assessment process and the proposed redevelopment will include:\n- More than 15,000sqm of floor\narea for a range of commercial, retail, cultural and community uses, including\nup to 62 residential apartments;\n- Basement and ground floor car\nparking for around 71 vehicles;\n- At least 500 square metres of\nopen space, opening up the site to the surrounding area and connecting to the\nexisting public open space on the adjacent Redfern Community Centre site;\n- Incorporating into the\ndevelopment several lanes in the area, including Eveleigh Lane;\n- Conceptual landscape design;\nand\n- Staggering the development in\nthree stages.\nThe proposed redevelopment will\nsignificantly improve the area’s attractiveness, boost the viability of further\ncommercial investment and restore a sense of respect and pride in The Block as\na positive cultural meeting place. The Plan promotes a secure and aesthetically\npleasing site by incorporating principles of crime prevention through environmental\ndesign and will support the area’s long and vibrant history.\nA number of amendments have been\nmade following public exhibition of the proposal to address public and agency\nfeedback, including the requirements of the AHC to:\n- Comply with RailCorp’s\nrequirements with regard to protecting the rail corridor, assessing derailment\nrisks and protection, stormwater drainage, noise and fencing/landscaping;\n- Demonstrate sustainable design,\nincluding meeting a minimum 4.5 star Australian Building Greenhouse Rating or\nequivalent in all new retail and commercial buildings;\n- Demonstrate design excellence\nin accordance with the Major Projects state environmental planning policy\ncovering the Redfern-Waterloo Authority sites; and\n- Prepare landscape plans for any\nnew public domain areas.\nThe AHC has also committed to\nconsulting with the local community and stakeholders throughout the\nrejuvenation of the precinct and will ensure all future applications are\nconsistent with the concept plan.\nPemulwuy was an Aboriginal warrior believed to have been born in 1750\nwho was about 38 years old when the First Fleet arrived. He was of the Eora people, whose land – now known as\nBotany Bay – was most directly affected by the arrival of the British.\nPemulwuy fiercely resisted the British colonisation of Australia, using\nfire as a weapon, destroying crops and animals, and raiding settlements. As his\nlegend grew, so did his supporters. At one point, he had more than 100\nfollowers who knew him as the “rainbow warrior” for the colours he wore.\nPemulwuy was shot dead on the orders of Governor Philip King in 1802\nand decapitated. Some believe his head was bottled, sent to England and then\nreturned to Australia in 1950 but his remains have never been recovered.\nThe Hon. Kristina Keneally M.P. NSW Premier\nMinister for Redfern-Waterloo Parliament House\nMacquarie Street\nSydney\nDear Minister Keneally,\nIt is with pleasure that I\nforward you the sixth Annual Report of the Redfern-Waterloo Authority for the\nyear ending 30 June 2010.\nThis report has been prepared in\naccordance with the NSW Annual Report (Statutory Bodies) Act 1984 No 87, the\nAnnual Report (Statutory Bodies) Regulation 2000 and the Redfern-Waterloo\nAuthority Act 2004 No 107.\nYours sincerely,\nRoy Wakelin-King AM\nChief Executive Officer Redfern-Waterloo Authority\nRedfern - Waterloo Authority\nRedfern and Waterloo are located just south of Sydney’s Central\nBusiness District. To the south-west are Sydney’s economic gateways, Port\nBotany and Sydney Airport.\nThe Redfern-Waterloo Authority\n(RWA) was created by a NSW Government Act of Parliament in Oct 2004\n(Redfern-Waterloo Authority Act 2004 No 107) and established on 17 January\n2005.\nThe RWA is responsible for\nrevitalising Redfern, Waterloo, Eveleigh and Darlington through strategic urban\nrenewal, job creation and improved human services in consideration of social,\neconomic, ecological and other sustainable development, public spaces,\nAboriginal community needs, social cohesion and community safety.\nUnder the direction of the NSW\nGovernment’s 10-year urban renewal program for Redfern-Waterloo, the\nrevitalisation of the area has instilled renewed\nconfidence in the region and encouraged an influx of creative enterprise and\nprivate investment. With the amount of commercial, residential and community\nfacilities being developed or refurbished as a direct result of RWA\ninitiatives, Redfern-Waterloo is seeing the benefits of a commitment to\nreinvestment, jobs and sustainable economic prosperity.\nSince the inception of the RWA\nin 2005, the NSW Government has directly facilitated the investment of well\nover $600 million towards infrastructure development, the provision of improved\nhuman services and employment opportunities for the local community including\ndedicated roles for Indigenous workers.\n(see pdf version)\nIt gives us great pleasure to\npresent the Redfern-Waterloo Authority’s (RWA) Annual Report for 2009/2010.\nThis was the fifth year of the\nRedfern-Waterloo Authority since its establishment in 2005 under the\nRedfern-Waterloo Authority Act, 2004 (the Act).\n2009/2010 was an outstanding\nyear for the Redfern-Waterloo Authority with much of its earlier hard work\ncoming to fruition. This has resulted in positive progress in the\nrevitalisation of Redfern-Waterloo which will have direct and lasting benefits\nfor the area.\nThe National Centre of\nIndigenous Excellence (NCIE) was officially opened by the former Prime Minister\nin February 2010. This world class facility has put Redfern on the nation’s map\nas the best place in Australia to celebrate and promote Indigenous culture, arts,\neducation and sport. It will bring visitors and students from all over the\ncountry to the area as well as provide an exciting new local facility for the\npeople of Redfern and Waterloo. The establishment of this facility was a direct\nresult of the work of the Authority under its Redfern-Waterloo Built\nEnvironment Plan.\nIn January 2010, Channel 7,\nPacific Magazines and Global Television moved into 8 Central Avenue at\nAustralian Technology Park (ATP). The establishment of these major corporations\nat ATP demonstrates the increasing confidence the business community has in the\nfuture of the Redfern-Waterloo area. The arrival of these organisations has\nseen more than 2,000 staff members introduced to the local area, resulting in a\nreal boost to the local economy.\nIn March 2010, operations\ncommenced at the new community health centre which was established using the\nproceeds of the sale of the Rachael Forster Hospital site. This was a direct\nresult of the work done by the Authority in developing a concept plan for this\nsite and returning the proceeds from the sale to the Redfern community.\nThe NSW Premier also announced\nin July 2009 the approval of the Pemulwuy Project Concept Plan for the\nredevelopment of The Block. This project will deliver 300 jobs, 62 homes and\nover 9,000sqm of commercial uses, shops and community and cultural space for\nthis iconic area of Redfern.\nRedevelopment of the Redfern RSL\nsite began in early 2010 with the commencement of demolition works. This site\nwill be developed over the next two years, resulting in an 18-storey mixed use\nbuilding comprising 86 residential apartments and retail and commercial uses.\nIt will also result in a new RSL Club being returned to the site by the end of\n2011.\nWhilst a tremendous amount of\nwork continues in the built environment, the Authority has also continued its\nwork in the broader area of urban renewal for Redfern-Waterloo.\nIn February 2010, the NSW\nPremier and Minister for Redfern Waterloo, the Hon Kristina Keneally, presented\na report card that demonstrated all indicators for the renewal of Redfern and\nWaterloo were moving in the right direction including increased training and\njob numbers and increased demand for housing. The Premier also highlighted the\nsignificant decrease in crime statistics for the local area as being a very\npositive indicator of the urban renewal process occurring in Redfern-Waterloo.\nThe Eveleigh Farmers’ Market continued\nto go from strength to strength winning the Sydney Morning Herald 2010 Foodies\nAward for Best Markets in Sydney after trading for only seven months. More than\n3,000 people attend the markets on a weekly basis to enjoy freshly grown\nproduce sold by the growers/producers themselves.\nThe RWA also introduced the\nEveleigh Market Christmas Banner competition in 2009 inviting every youth\nservice in Redfern-Waterloo and every school in the City of Sydney Local\nGovernment area to participate. The NSW Premier announced the winner,\nAlexandria Park Community School, at a special Christmas Market held in\nDecember 2009.\nTo ensure that the important\nheritage of the Redfern-Waterloo area is preserved, the RWA established the\nRedfern-Waterloo Heritage Taskforce in 2009. This Taskforce will\nidentify opportunities for the active conservation, interpretation and adaptive\nreuse of the heritage of the Redfern-Waterloo area.\nThe RWA formed a new partnership\n“Roll up Redfern” in 2009 with the City of Sydney, Redfern-Waterloo Chamber of\nCommerce, REDWatch and the South Sydney Rabbitohs. This group is focused on\npromoting the key strengths of the Redfern-Waterloo area including highlighting\nthe iconic landmarks and organisations and the diversity of the local community\nand culture.\nThe RWA’s Employment and\nEnterprise programs continued to deliver strong results for both Aboriginal and\nnon Aboriginal people in the area of training and employment during 2009/2010.\nThe RWA’s Aboriginal Employment\nModel was developed to ensure the creation of employment opportunities for\nAboriginal people in the hospitality and construction industries and continues\nto exceed its targets. The Koori Job Ready in construction course is helping\nGovernment and private sector organisations to employ Aboriginal people on\ntheir construction projects, with well over 500 employment opportunities being\ncreated in this sector alone.\nThe Redfern-Waterloo Human\nServices Plan Phase 1 Evaluation Report was released in July 2009. This report\nrevealed some very good progress on many of the actions contained in the Plan\nand has resulted in key human service agencies working more collaboratively,\nsharing information and targeting specific new initiatives in the area.\nThe RWA once again supported a\nrange of groups during the year through the Community Grants Program. This\nincluded support of sports, arts, cultural and educational activities and\nevents in the community.\nThe RWA continues to be focused\non creating a vibrant and safe community through urban renewal, improved human\nservices, training and job creation for the community of Redfern and Waterloo.\nDr Col Gellatly AO Chairperson\nRoy Wakelin-King AM Chief\nExecutive Officer\n- To encourage the urban renewal\nof Redfern–Waterloo into an active, vibrant and sustainable community;\n- To promote, support and respect\nthe Aboriginal community in Redfern-Waterloo with regards to the importance of\nthe area to the Aboriginal people;\n- To promote the orderly\ndevelopment of Redfern-Waterloo whilst taking into consideration principles of\nsocial, economic, ecological and other sustainable development;\n- To provide and promote housing\nchoices in the operational area;\n- To enable the establishment of\npublic areas in Redfern-Waterloo; and\n- To promote greater social cohesion\nand community safety in Redfern–Waterloo.\nIn order to achieve its aims and\nobjectives, the RWA maintains an undertaking to:\n- Promote, facilitate, manage and\nsecure the social, economic, ecological and other sustainable development and\nuse of the operational area, including the development and management of land,\nthe provision of infrastructure and the establishment of public areas;\n- Provide and promote housing\nchoices in the operational area (including for Aboriginal residents);\n- Provide and promote employment\nopportunities for local residents, commercial opportunities for local\nbusinesses and cultural development (including the needs of the Aboriginal\ncommunity) in the operational area;\n- Enhance and manage public\nplaces in the operational area and to improve, maintain and regulate the use of\nthose public places;\n- Promote, co-ordinate, organise,\nmanage, undertake, secure, provide and conduct cultural, educational,\ncommercial, recreational, entertainment and transport activities and facilities\nin the operational area; and\n- Do any other thing for the\nsustainable improvement of the operational area.\nCEO\n----------------------\n: V\n:\nBusiness Administration\n:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nV V V\nHuman Services Community Relations Training, Employment & Enterprise Planning and Urban Renewal\nThe NSW Premier and Minister for\nRedfern-Waterloo, the Hon.

The\neconomic and social benefits generated by the BEP1 are evidenced by key\ndevelopments such as the television/media complex at Australian Technology Park\nand the redevelopment of the Redfern RSL Club which commenced in early 2010.\nThe RWA in partnership with\nHousing NSW continued to develop the draft Stage 2 of the Built Environment\nPlan (BEP2) to provide for the renewal of social housing estates in\nRedfern-Waterloo and opportunities to enhance affordable housing by:\n- Revitalising and improving\nsocial housing stock;\n- Enhancing the public domain\nwithin and around the social housing estates;\n- Reducing the concentration of\nsocial housing and providing a more balanced housing and social mix to create\nmore sustainable communities; and\n- Facilitating the provision of\naffordable housing.\nThe Redfern-Waterloo community\nand social housing tenants in particular will be extensively consulted on any\nproposals for public housing renewal.\nSignificant achievements\ndelivered through the Built Environment Plan to date:\n- Assisted the Indigenous Land\nCorporation in securing Redfern as the location for the $53m National Centre of\nIndigenous Excellence. The NCIE is a multi-use complex with world-class sports,\narts, educational and cultural programs for young Indigenous people and the\nwider community. The centre opened in January 2010 and is the first of its kind\nin Australia.\n- The establishment of the $10m\nCommunity Health Centre in Redfern Street on the site of the former court house\nand police station was facilitated by the RWA. The centre was funded from the\nproceeds of the sale of the former Rachel Forster Hospital with a concept plan\nprepared by the RWA. The centre opened in February, 2010 and provides mental\nhealth, drug and alcohol services, HIV services and health nursing.\n- The establishment of affordable\nhousing initiatives, including the negotiation of the Affordable Housing\nAgreement with Frasers Property from the development of the former Carlton United\nBreweries site in Chippendale. The agreement will generate around $32m in\naffordable housing funds over the next five years up until 2013/14 to fund the\nprovision of affordable housing within the Redfern-Waterloo area.\n- The establishment of a working\ngroup with RailCorp to develop options for the upgrade of Redfern Station.\n- Enabling the commencement of\nconstruction on the $28m mixed retail/commercial and residential development\nwhich will result in 84 apartments and a new Redfern RSL Club.\n- The Government’s approval of\nthe Aboriginal Housing Company’s $60m Pemulwy Project Concept Plan on\nAboriginal land within and around ‘The Block’ in July 2009 is a significant\nrenewal project for the area. This includes 62 residential apartments,\nemployment, and cultural & community uses.\nHeritage Works\nIn late 2009, the RWA established the Redfern-Waterloo Heritage\nTaskforce (RWHT), the purpose of which is to identify opportunities for the\nactive conservation, interpretation and adaptive reuse of the heritage of the\nRedfern-Waterloo area. The RWHT met for the first time in December 2009 and\nmeets approximately four times a year with sub-groups meeting at other times.\nThe Taskforce includes two Indigenous representatives and works on a project\nbasis to address a broad and comprehensive treatment of the area’s diverse\nheritage values.\nThe preservation of Bays 1 and\n2, the refurbishment of the pump room, the upgrade of the water tower and\nvarious other works at the former Eveleigh\nLocomotive Workshops at Australian Technology Park are among the heritage works\ninvested in by the RWA, through its subsidary company ATPPML.\nThe Taskforce seeks to increase\ncommunity awareness, understanding, appreciation and enjoyment of the existing\nheritage and stimulate greater community initiative and participation in\nefforts to conserve it.\nBuilt Environment Ministerial Advisory Committee\n- NSW Department of State & Regional Development – Reg Fisk\n- Housing NSW – Kathy Roil\n- NSW Roads & Traffic Authority – Peter Collins\n- NSW Department of Planning – Josephine Wing\n- Railcorp – Ivan Glavinic\n- City of Sydney – Andrew Thomas\n- Community – Alex Kibble\n- Community – Geoff Turnbull\n- Community – Norah McGuire\n- Community – Steve Tamas\n- Community – Denny Powell\n- Community – Mary Lynne Pidcock\n- RWA – Roy Wakelin-King AM (Chair)\n- RWA – Joanne McGuiness\n- RWA – Julie Parsons (Secretariat)\nIn February 2010, the Redfern\ncommunity was joined by then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, for the official\nopening of The National Centre for Indigenous Excellence (NCIE). Mr Rudd said\nit was proud day for Australians and marked a new era in Indigenous education,\nengagement and leadership. The multi-use complex provides world-class sports,\narts, educational and cultural programs for young Indigenous people and the\nwider community, and is the first of its kind in Australia.\nThe Redfern-Waterloo Authority\nhelped the Indigenous Land Corporation to secure the site for the Centre.\nFacilities include a 25-metre heated pool, a YMCA-designed gymnasium and cardio\nhall, sports field, dining hall and activity rooms, hostel accommodation,\nconference facilities, meeting rooms and a ropes course.\nSol Bellear, an NCIE Director,\nsaid the Centre is already helping to build a more cohesive, more tolerant\nRedfern.\n“The idea being that the Centre is inclusive\nnot exclusive. We are here for everybody, not just Indigenous people.”\nMore than 100 young people will\nsleep, eat and learn in the facility at any one time, studying in the fields of\nsport, art culture and/or education.\n“We will provide practical\nskills for young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who need guidance\nand support,” said NCIE CEO Jason Glanville. “We are aiming to have 5,000\npeople rolling through the doors annually.”\nMembers of the general public\nhave also embraced the Centre, with almost 1000 gym memberships since it opened\nin January 2010.\nThe RWA’s Human Services Plan\nwas developed in two phases. Phase 1 focuses on improving services delivered to\nchildren and families, Aboriginal people and young people and was endorsed by\nNSW Government in December 2005. An independent consultation undertook an\n18-month review of Phase 1 and The Redfern Waterloo Human Services Plan Phase 1\nEvaluation Report was publicly released in July 2009.\nThe Report revealed good progress\non many of the actions, and highlighted the fact that the Human Services Plan\nPhase One has resulted in key human services agencies working more\ncollaboratively, sharing information and targeting specific new initiatives in\nthe area.\nFollowing recommendations made\nin the report, the RWA re-established the Redfern Waterloo Youth Services\nTaskforce and Family Violence Taskforce in 2009 to advance action in these\nareas.\nThe RWA continued to oversee the\nimplementation of the Human Services Plan working collaboratively with both\ngovernment and non-government agencies in the area to progress actions.\nSignificant achievements in Human Services include:\n- The RWA in conjunction with\nvarious human services agencies delivered LOVE BiTES a school-based violence\nand sexual assault prevention program. The LOVE BiTES program was run at the\nAlexandria Park Community School and incorporated interactive workshops for\nstudents and youth workers on sexual assault and family/domestic violence\nissues.\n- The RWA in conjunction with the\nWaterloo Neighbourhood Advisory Board Learning, Employment, Enterprise Action\nGroup assisted in a landscaping project and upgrade of the South Sydney PCYC\nfaçade. This project provided vocational education and training for young\nunemployed people from the area and resulted in creating a more welcoming entry\nto this important youth facility for the area.\n- The RWA provided support to the\nRedfern Local Area Command in the delivery of the “Working together for a safer\nRedfern” forum held in March 2010. The forum featured speakers from victims of\ncrime, and various organisations involved in community safety and focused on\nDomestic Violence, Alcohol and Drugs and the effects of violence and trauma on\nchildren.\n- The RWA in conjunction with the\nInner Sydney Regional Council for Social Development hosted an NGO Forum in May\n2010 to promote positive discussion between NGO’s and Government agencies in\nthe ongoing delivery of human services to provide better outcomes for the\ncommunity.\n- In collaboration with NSW\nHealth, the City of Sydney Council and Redfern Police, the RWA assisted in the\nrelocation the Needle & Syringe Outreach Service from The Block in December\n2009.\nHuman Services Ministerial Advisory Committee\n- NSW Department of Community Services – Lisa Charet\n- Housing NSW – Meghan Hibbert\n- NSW Police – Luke Freudenstein\n- NSW Department of Aboriginal Affairs – Kristy Masella\n- NSW Department of Education – Phil Lambert/Paul Parks\n- NSW Department of Health – Greg Stewart\n- City of Sydney – Suzie Matthews/Ian Hay\n- NSW Dept Ageing, Disability and Home Care – Steven Gal\n- Indigenous Coordination Centre – Sally Gibson\n- Ministry of Transport – Caroline Mason\n- Community – Alison Peters\n- Community – Mabel Chang\n- Community – Michael Shreenan\n- Community – Robert Perry\n- Community – Albert Torrens\n- Community – Brad Freeburn\n- Community – John Hutchinson\n- Community – Ross Smith\n- RWA – Roy Wakelin-King AM (Chair)\n- RWA – Julie Parsons\n(Secretariat)\nThe former Courthouse and Police\nStation at 103 Redfern Street is now home to a $10 million Community Health\nCentre. The Courthouse and Police Station was one of several key “strategic\nsites” identified by the RWA which can contribute to providing land for\nbusiness and residential purposes. These sites maximise the advantage of\nexisting public transport; the Sydney CBD, Airport and Port; recreational and\ncultural facilities; and nearby significant health and educational facilities.\nThe project was funded by the\nsale of the Rachel Forster Hospital site on the corner of Pitt and Albert\nStreets, Redfern, and was approved by the NSW Government in July 2008. The\nCentre operationally opened in February 2010 and provides a comprehensive range\nof services, creates up to 94 full-time jobs in the area, adaptively re-uses a\nsignificant building and delivers a range of important health benefits to local\nfamilies.\nOther aims and objectives of the\ndevelopment are to:\n- Provide access to and between\ndifferent health and community services;\n- Provide flexible building\ndesign to allow for future modification and anticipated growth in demand for\nservices and changes in clinical practice;\n- Ensure development provides\nharmony and balance with the surrounding areas;\n- Provide a high quality urban\nenvironment through careful design of buildings and a well designed public\ndomain; and\n- Provide a safe and secure\nenvironment for users and staff of the facility and the wider community.\nThrough projects such as the\nCommunity Health Centre, the community is starting to see the results of both\nphases of the Human Services Plan, which identifies specific challenges faced\nby a broad section of the community particularly in the areas of population,\ndrug and mental health.\nThe Employment & Enterprise\nPlan was published in May 2006 and was the first comprehensive training and\nemployment strategy for the Redfern-Waterloo area. Its main aim is to deliver\nskilled job seekers to meet the specific employment needs of the market, to\ncreate educational opportunities and build on future growth potential.\nThe Plan focuses on:\n- Increasing supply of employment\nopportunities, particularly through commercial and residential development;\n- Capitalising on the Research/\nBiomedical Innovation Zone;\n- Improving education and\ntraining including a dedicated vocational training centre;\n- Strengthening partnerships with\nlocal employers;\n- Industry-based employment\nstrategies;\n- Employment and enterprise\nstrategies for Aboriginal people and youth; and\n- Supporting local business.\nSignificant achievements to date:\n- Establishment of the Yaama\nDhiyaan Hospitality Training Centre on the North Eveleigh site in Darlington.\nSince opening in 2006, a total of 135 students have graduated with a\nCertificate II in Hospitality Operations. The training centre specialises in\nIndigenous cuisine.\n- Establishment of the Koori Job\nReady Course in Darlington, training local Indigenous people in construction\nskills. Since 2008, 78 Indigenous people have graduated from the\ncourse. 46 (or 60 percent) have gained employment in construction and other\nindustries.\n- Creation of the Aboriginal\nEmployment Model which as of 30 June 2010 has brokered employment opportunities\nfor more than 600 Aboriginal people in the construction industry on local,\nState and Federal Government projects and private sector contracts.\n- Helping facilitate the\nrelocation of Channel 7, Global Television and Pacific Magazines in January\n2010 to a new purpose-built media complex at Australian Technology Park. The\nthree companies have up to 2,000 employees, many of whom utilise Redfern\nStation and contribute to local business in the surrounding area.\n- The collaboration with Sydney\nCity Council, Souths Rabittohs and the Redfern-Waterloo Chamber of Commerce in\nthe Roll-Up Redfern campaign which encourages local business to improve the\ncommercial landscape in the Redfern-Waterloo town centre.\nAboriginal Employment Model (AEM)\nThe RWA’s groundbreaking\nAboriginal Employment Model (AEM) has brokered employment opportunities in the\nconstruction industry for over 600 Aboriginal people across 25 trades, from\nelectricians to bricklayers, office administrators and crane drivers. Several\nprivate sector groups are also replicating the RWA’s model to manage Aboriginal\nemployment on sites throughout Sydney.\nThe Model has been adopted by\nother NSW Government agencies, and has resulted in the achievement of\nAboriginal employment outcomes on local construction projects including the\nNational Centre for Indigenous Excellence, Channel 7, CarriageWorks, the Black\nTheatre site, the Elizabeth Street Housing redevelopment, Redfern Community\nHealth Centre, and the Redfern Street Redfern Park upgrades.\nEmployment and Enterprise Ministerial Advisory Commitee\n- NSW Department of Education – Phil Lambert\n- NSW Department of State & Regional Development –\nBernadette Selfe\n- NSW TAFE – Allison Wood\n- NSW Department of Aboriginal Affairs – Kristy Masella\n- Dept of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations –\nSharron Hawkins\n- City of Sydney – Jan Campbell\n- Community – Mary Lynne Pidcock\n- Community – Michael Dalah\n- Community – Millie Ingram\n- Community – Siobhan Bryson\n- Community – Les Tobler\n- RWA – Roy Wakelin-King AM (Chair)\n- RWA – Denny Hall\n- RWA – Julie Parsons\n(Secretariat)\nThe Yaama Dhiyaan Hospitality\nTraining Centre held its third graduation ceremony for 2009 in October. Eight\nAboriginal students received their Certificate II training in Hospitality\nOperations, and it was a also fitting way to acknowledge the company’s third\nanniversary.\nSince opening its doors in\nOctober 2006, Yaama Dhiyaan has become a cornerstone training centre in the\nlocal community, having helped over 100 students graduate from the hospitality\ncourse. More than 66 percent have since gained employment or moved on to\nfurther education.\nAboriginal Elder, Aunty Beryl\nVan Oploo has taught at Yaama Dhiyaan since the beginning. “My dream to provide\nAboriginal people with skills to work in hospitality has become a wonderful\nreality,” Aunty Beryl says.\n“Along with the Koori Job Ready\nCourse, this hospitality course empowers graduates to make decisions about what\nthey want to do with the rest of their lives,” said RWA CEO, Roy Wakelin-King\nAM.\n“It’s about giving young and\nolder Indigenous people the skills and the opportunity to build themselves a\npositive and fulfilling future.”\nThree months after celebrating\nthe anniversary, Aunty Beryl was preparing afternoon tea for Prince William. Around\n2000 people turned out on the streets of Redfern when the Prince visited the\nCommunity Centre in the heart of The Block on 18th January 2010 as part of a\nthree day Australian tour. He was welcomed by a traditional Aboriginal\nsmoking ceremony and met with members of the local Indigenous community.\n“It was exciting because he\nchose our community to come to,” Aunty Beryl said. “I reckon he has similar\nreasons to his mum for coming to Redfern. He wants to touch everybody in\nsociety whether you are rich, poor or otherwise. He is a lovely man with\nsimilar traits to his mother and father.”\nCharles Madden, director of\nRedfern’s Aboriginal Medical Service, was first to speak at the event, saying:\n“I’d like to thank Prince William for coming here to The Block today.” Mr\nMadden said. “It’s good to have him here because The Block has produced a lot\nof positive things for Redfern.”\nAunty Beryl and the team at\nYaama served the Prince and around 60 elders an afternoon tea which included\nquandon and custard tarts, lemon myrtle butter biscuits, chocolate truffles and\na fruit cocktail. It was the second time Aunty Beryl has served royalty. About\n40 years ago, she did a catering job at The Rocks during a visit by Prince\nWilliam’s father, Prince Charles, who was served kangaroo meatballs with bush\ntomato sauce.\nSince the inception of the RWA in 2005, the NSW Government has directly\nfacilitated the investment of more than $b00m towards infrastructure\ndevelopment, the provision of improved human services and employment\nopportunities for the local community including dedicated roles for Indigenous\nworkers.\nNew facilities such as the\nCommunity Health Centre and National Centre of Indigenous Excellence are now\nproviding first class services and facilities to the local community. The newly\nopened Farmers and Artisan Markets in North Eveleigh features over 70 regular\nstall holders offering a vast array of seasonal fresh and value-added produce\nincluding organic biodynamic foods from farmers and artisan producers across\nNSW. A number of other exciting businesses have also integrated into the\nindustrial heritage of the Refern area including art galleries, furniture\nstores and restaurants.\nAustralian Technology Park & North Eveleigh\nThe NSW Government’s biggest\ninvestment in the Redfern-Waterloo area has been in Australian Technology Park.\nATP is one of the country’s most dynamic technology and innovation precincts,\nproviding a collaborative R&D environment which enables innovative ICT\ncompanies to forge exciting alliances and access support for global\ncommercialisation. It also includes unique world class conferencing, exhibition\nand entertainment venues which have earned a national reputation for\nexcellence.\nATP is located on almost 14\nhectares of what was originally part of the Eveleigh Railway Yards and was an\ninitiative of the University of New South Wales, the University of Sydney and\nthe University of Technology (Sydney), with support from the Federal and NSW\nState Governments.\nOwned and managed by the Sydney\nHarbour Foreshore Authority since July 2000, it became a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of the RWA and one of eight locally significant strategic sites under\nthe jurisdiction of the RWA in April 2005. Five months later, an investment of\nmore than $54m by the RWA resulted in construction of the 11,000sqm research\nfacility for National Information and Communications Technology Australia\n(NICTA) and the Defence, Science & Technology Organisation (DSTO), which\nwas completed in 2008, along with new roads and infrastructure.\nIn January 2010, Channel 7,\nPacific Magazines and Global Television moved approximately 2,000 employees\ninto a brand new state-of-the-art television and media office complex at 8\nCentral Avenue within the Park. This building was the largest commercial\ndevelopment in Redfern for more than a decade and the arrival of these global\ncompanies heralds the ATP’s evolution as one of Australia’s leading media\ncentres.\nAustralian Technology Park will\nbe a main driver in RedfernWaterloo’s economic growth over the next decade.\nFuture capital investment is estimated at around $460m, with an ultimate\nworkforce of more than 9000 permanent employees, representing a 20 percent\nincrease in jobs for the area. The developing media environment at ATP will\nstimulate commercial interest and encourage associated industries wanting to\nseek synergies with such a large and dynamic industry presence to locate, if\nnot exclusively within ATP, to Redfern-Waterloo, and particularly, the North\nEveleigh precinct.\nThe former Minister for Planning\nand now Premier, Kristina Keneally, announced the approval of the Concept Plan for\nthe redevelopment of North Eveleigh in January 2009.\nThe Concept Plan provides for a\nmixed use precinct for living, working and recreation and will offer affordable\nhousing for key workers in the area, such as teachers, nurses and police.\nThe plan is for the site to be\ndeveloped over the next five to seven years and will accommodate residential,\ncommercial, retail cultural and community uses as well as public open space.\nThe concept plan proposes:\n- Around 1,200 new dwellings\nwithin close proximity to Redfern Station;\n- Retention and adaptive use of\nheritage buildings;\n- A public open space network\ntotalling 9,980sqm including five parks;\n- New community and childcare\nfacilities;\n- A 12 percent target of the\ntotal new dwellings to be developed on the site for affordable housing;\n- Construction of a number of new\nbuildings ranging from 4 to 16 storeys, with the taller buildings at the\neastern end of the site and adjacent to the rail corridor;\n- Infrastructure and services\nsuch as roadways and stormwater management; and\n- Intersection upgrades to\naddress any increased traffic generation.\nOne of the outstanding features\nof this site is its historical and heritage significance. Approximately 30\npercent of the site’s floor space is located within existing buildings. The\nheritage buildings and structures to be retained and adaptively used are;\n- Paint Shop Building – retail\nand residential uses;\n- Chief Mechanical Engineers\nBuilding – commercial or residential uses;\n- Scientific Services Building –\ncommunity/cultural uses;\n- Telecommunications Equipment\nCentre – community/cultural uses;\n- Clothing Store Building –\nresidential uses;\n- Blacksmith’s Workshop –\ncultural/community and commercial purposes; and\n- Fan of Tracks – part of the\nrailway tracks will be retained and interpreted within the public domain.\nThe Carriage Workshop building\ncurrently occupied by the Ministry of Arts – Performing Arts Centre and the\nAnna Schwartz Gallery will continue to be used for cultural/community and\ncommercial purposes.\nThe $550m redevelopment will\ncreate approximately 6,500 jobs including 3,300 construction jobs with 300 of\nthese positions being for Aboriginal people. Approximately 3,000 permanent jobs\nwill be created from the commercial, retail and cultural development of the\nsite.\nEveleigh Market Named Sydney’s Best\nIn October 2009,\nRedfern-Waterloo’s premier market were declared the best market in Sydney after\njust seven months of operation by the Sydney Morning Herald 2010 Foodies Guide.\nEveleigh Market was judged the\nbest on the criteria of ‘excellence of product, knowledge and understanding of\nwhat is stocked, attention to detail and engagement with business.’ The award\nacknowledged Management’s undertaking of authentic audits with stallholders on\nan ongoing basis to reassure product quality.\nEveleigh Market Manager, Ariana\nAljinovic said it was an honour to receive the award, especially for the\nfarmers and producers.\n“Ever since we started\noperating, community support for the markets has grown,” says Ariana. “It’s no\nwonder considering the amazing range of products on offer from the more than 65\nstallholders.”\nThe rain, hail or shine weekly\nevent attracts up to 3,000 visitors every Saturday, while the Artisans’ Market\ncontinues to showcase the best in individually-designed local art, sculpture,\nceramic glass, craft and Indigenous works on the first Sunday of each month.\nThe Eveleigh Market was created\nby a $3m refurbishment of the heritage Blacksmith’s Workshop undertaken by the\nNSW Government and the Redfern-Waterloo Authority.\nThe RWA sponsors and provides\nfunding throughout the year to community projects, local sporting organisations\nand Indigenous enterprises.
