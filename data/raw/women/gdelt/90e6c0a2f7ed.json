  "body_text": "In Shane Christie’s final year, each day felt darker than the one before: his perception clouded by concussion symptoms that never let up and his belief he had developed the brain-destroying disease CTE from head-knocks during his rugby career. David Fisher reports.\nWarning: This article contains distressing content\nFour days before Christie is believed to have taken his own life, he shot and buried his dog, Rajah. As he buried Rajah, he said on video: “In a year or so, I can dig his bones up and they will be clean. His body will have decomposed and we’ll see where we’re at.”\nAt home in Nelson where Christie’s body was found last Wednesday morning, were neatly-ordered stacks of papers about his dead friend Billy Guyton, the first professional rugby player to be diagnosed with the degenerative brain disease CTE, linked to repeated head knocks.\nSome of those papers were for a meeting on September 15 with members of the Guyton family and the coroner, who would hear Billy Guyton’s inquest.\nLike Christie, the immediate cause of Billy Guyton’s death was suspected suicide - but there will be questions about how much of a killing hand chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) played.\nRight up to the week Christie died, he had plans. He had a future of which he spoke often, places to be and people to meet.\nFor the Guyton family, the death of Christie on Wednesday 27 August was like losing Billy all over again. Billy Guyton’s death at 33 two years ago had brought Christie deep into the family fold.\nJohn Guyton said it’s hard to understand how the world is seen by people afflicted with the disease he blames for killing his son.\n“I thought Shane was going to hang around with us but we don’t live life in their minds.”\nHe was talking about the minds of those damaged by rugby, like his son and like Christie. Players who find their memories fading, and paranoia and confusion setting in. Players who show signs of aggression, depression, impulsivity and irritability - with thoughts returning again and again to suicide.\nThey are the players who will never know if they have the disease that may eventually kill them because CTE can only be diagnosed after death.\nChristie believed he, too, carried the disease found in Billy Guyton’s brain. He announced his retirement from professional rugby in 2018, already plagued by confusion, fatigue, memory loss and head pain.\nYears later, still tormented by symptoms, he wrote: “As I now understand the effects that concussion had on Billy’s brain and witnessing the drastic changes in his life, I can only assume that I’ve developed CTE myself. This realisation has been a confronting one, but it has also given me a new perspective on my own experiences and struggles.”\nA year ago, symptoms of CTE weren’t strikingly obvious in Christie.\nHe was fiercely smart, and larger than life. Tori Guyton, Billy’s sister, talks of “mana grab” in which he would say hello by seizing your hand, looking into your eyes and powering that smile into you in such a way you were uplifted.\nThe week he died, those who knew him were seriously worried about the changes they were witnessing. His friends were contacting each other, and increasingly finding they held the same fears.\nOn the morning Christie died, an urgently-organised meeting was to be held at the NZ Rugby Players’ Association to find a way to help him, even though he did not want help.\nThe morning of that meeting, Christie’s body was found.\nA year is a long time in brain injury\nAyear before Christie died, the casually-dressed former rugby star was looking perfectly out of place in the back rows of a medical seminar in Auckland.\nComfortable in a hoodie and cap, Christie looked more like he was heading out for a run than rubbing shoulders with neuroscientists and doctoral researchers working their way through the scientific details of chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\nHe wasn’t the only one looking like he didn’t quite belong. With him was John Guyton whose dead son Billy’s brain had been analysed by the same experts in the room, discovering the retired rugby player had the degenerative brain disease.\nNext to Christie was Gregg “Pup” Johnson, a former NZSAS soldier who has pledged his brain for research, to help find out whether a military career’s worth of head knocks can lead to the same - or similar - condition.\nThe three men from the provinces had travelled from the South Island to be there. For Guyton, because CTE had killed his son. For Christie and Johnson, to create greater awareness of CTE - and to help understand their own brains.\nThis was August 29 2024 at the University of Auckland’s Centre for Brain Research. It stretches across the top floor of the medical school’s Grafton Campus and shares space with the Neurological Foundation Human Brain Bank.\nThat’s where Billy Guyton’s brain is kept - and where Christie’s brain will now be going for examination.\nThrough security-controlled doors, the three men had joined a gathering listening to Samantha Bureau of international research consortium, the Concussion Legacy Foundation.\nShe is an expert in neurodegenerative diseases and particularly CTE.\nThat day, she ran through the almost century-long research history of a disease that was discovered through “punch drunk” boxers in 1928 and is now fast enveloping the world of contact sport.\nCTE, she explained, was a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head impacts. Those head hits don’t have to be concussive, Bureau said. Lower grade hits still create abnormal deposits of tau protein in the brain.\nTau usually helps keep the brain functioning and stable, but after a lifetime of head knocks, it can change shape and cluster around small blood vessels, damaging brain cells.\nThe frontal lobe is where this starts to happen: the home of our high-order thinking. The centre for judgment, impulse control, mood and planning.\nWhen abnormal tau protein clusters and starts causing damage, early signs of the disease include aggression, depression, impulsivity, personality changes and poor decision-making.\nThe progress of CTE is marked by cognitive decline into confusion and a struggle with routine tasks.\nTowards the end, it resembles dementia - severe memory loss and trouble with movement and speech.\nAlso in the crowd that day a year ago was Irene Gotlieb-Old, wife of former All Black Geoff Old. While John Guyton was thinking about the early-stage symptoms he saw in his son, she was thinking about the man she lived with and how hard it had become.\nOld had experienced years of decline, isolating his wife yet helpless without her, seemingly oblivious to her and the impact his increasingly erratic behaviour had on her and others.\nShe loved meeting the younger players, seeing that spark that had drawn her to the man she loved before brain injury crushed in on both their lives.\nAfter meeting Christie, Gotlieb-Old spoke to him about three or four times a week. She was one of the people who later told the Herald how dramatically he changed across his final year of life.\nBureau told the gathering how the last decade of work had built what she considered unassailable scientific arguments about the connection between head injuries and sport. She name-checked the Boston University brain bank study that identified CTE in 110 of 111 brains donated by former NFL players.\n“If you think about smoking and lung cancer, we’re fighting a very similar battle where they had big tobacco to go against,” she said.\nAs Bureau addressed the group, Big Sport was meanwhile involved in legal fights about head knocks right across the globe.\nIn 2013, the United States’ National Football League settled a head injury case involving CTE. The case, brought by about 4500 players, settled for US$1bn but included no admission of liability.\nThe National Hockey League and Canadian Hockey League have also negotiated similar settlements, also with no admissions of liability.\nThe biggest rugby case remains unresolved. It was lodged in the United Kingdom against World Rugby in December 2020.\nAbout 1200 players alleged the global body failed to protect them from the consequences of head injuries. They claimed there was poor monitoring, a lack of proper protocols and inadequate warnings about risks.\nExploring CTE and its links to contact sport is not about stopping sport, Bureau told the crowd. Rather, she said, it’s about finding the place where reward and risk are balanced, and where everyone knows the price being paid.\nChristie and being an agent of change\n“Football is like smoking. The younger I start, the longer I’m exposed to danger,” Bureau says.\nShe recommends we stop full tackle rugby for children, introduce tools to better monitor impacts and develop better stand-down periods.\nFor Christie, this all made so much sense. He wanted to be an agent of change - that’s why he had come.\nHe had the Billy Guyton Foundation to launch - a memorial to his dead friend, and CTE advocacy hub he wanted to operate out of a retail space in Nelson.\nHe had plans to get across to Wellington and lobby in the unfamiliar space of Parliament for better health care for sport-related head injuries.\nHe wanted the NZ Rugby Players’ Association to be more aggressive and assertive towards NZ Rugby in arguing for better treatment facilities.\nChristie wanted NZ Rugby to step away from its current position that “a causal link between CTE-NC and clinically diagnosed neurodegenerative diseases is not currently well-established”.\nIt’s a statement that lines up with other major sporting bodies - and not with many independent medical agencies that instead directly call a causative connection - that repeated head knocks will cause CTE.\nAnd Christie argued NZ Rugby had to acknowledge a duty of care, not just to current players receiving improved messaging about head knocks, but to those whose careers were behind them, and who may be carrying the damage to early graves.\nChristie also felt frustrated there was information he felt NZ Rugby should make public yet he wasn’t being allowed to share it.\nWhen Christie announced his retirement from the professional game in 2018, part of the exit package was a promised review into the management of his concussions over his career.\nThe review was paid for by NZ Rugby, carried out by jurist Jeremy Doogue, and detailed the impacts from his earliest recorded concussion in 2006 through to the intense period of head injuries starting in mid-2016 that led to his retirement two years later.\nThe review was intended to be confidential so as to protect the identities of medical staff.\nFour months earlier, Christie had been told in a letter from NZ Rugby’s chief executive Mark Robinson that he would not be allowed to make public any recommended improvements to the future management of head injuries among players.\nThese proposed changes, Christie felt, would make a positive difference and therefore should be public. He also wanted progress to be tracked.\n“It shows they don’t want to be exposed for not living up to their slogan of having the best interests of players and their wellbeing at heart” he told the Herald.\n“If they were confident, they would have released the recommendations straight away.”\nThis was Christie one year ago. Clear-eyed in his vision - it was all about head injuries and their links to CTE. In the wake of his death, NZ Rugby is now saying it will find a way to make those recommendations public.\n“There’s so much trust in people, trust in institutions,” Christie said of rugby, and the faith it engendered in the playing community.\n“It’s not about trust – it’s making sure the system is efficient and operating properly. It should be based on outcomes. I would say there are thousands of people suffering with head injuries and nothing being done.”\nUnderstanding Billy Guyton\nIn the months that followed, Christie’s focus didn’t deviate but his frustration grew.\nThere were meetings organised with politicians, trips to see his local MP, letters written to seek support. But nothing appeared to change.\nThe Herald published a story about Christie being gagged by NZ Rugby over the changes proposed in his exit report. NZ Rugby didn’t budge - it’s only now after Christie has died that it may release the recommendations.\nChristie began to realise there were skills he needed but did not have. As he pushed himself to learn he came up against headaches and struggled to focus.\n“This is a war we’ve got and we’re ready to take this on for your brother,” Tori Guyton recalls him saying.\nChristie wrote an essay about his friendship with Guyton, “The Untold Story of Best Friends and the Impact of Multiple Concussions in NZ Rugby” in which he revealed his efforts to understand what head injuries had done to them both.\n“Simple day-to-day errands ... became painful for me as the very thought of using my brain to focus was agonising.\n“Lacking education on concussion or CTE, I struggled to understand myself and felt lost.”\nHe developed podcasting and video skills. He wanted to be an investigative journalist. He interviewed those with connections to CTE and head injuries, many on Zoom, from his bedroom.\nAmong those were Professor Alan Pearce, an Australian neurophysiologist and concussion specialist who became a friend, and brain bank neuroscientist Dr Helen Walker- who will likely be among those who study his brain.\nThere was also an interview with Bureau recorded on the day they met in Auckland.\nChristie told Bureau he wished the public knew more. He said it wasn’t until the death of Billy Guyton that he really worked to understand his own concussion issues and their impact on his mental health.\nChristie was in high-energy mode during this period. He was refitting a Nelson shop to be the physical home of the Billy Guyton Foundation. And it was there he discovered his desperate quest was not the only one in town.\nGotlieb-Old recalled: “So many people were walking in there with different grievances. I don’t think he could say no to anybody.”\nPeople came in complaining of fluoride in the water system and sharing disproved conspiracy theories about the Covid-19 vaccine.\nFor Christie, it was a short leap into alternative reality.\nHis faith in medical and political institutions was low, as it was in sporting institution NZ Rugby too - after being prevented from sharing changes he believed would make a difference.\nThose coming in had similar low levels of faith in institutions and he was ready to listen.\nIn November, he posted a video raising concerns about the Covid-19 vaccine. And similar issues followed. Instead of interviews with CTE academics and those from the rugby world, he was now interviewing those alleging government cover ups and conspiracies.\nPearce, the Australian academic, stayed in touch with Christie, and later told the Herald the striking shifts in Christie’s character and interests accelerated around the time Trump was re-elected.\nThe alerts about Shane Christie\nIn early 2025, Christie sought out an Opposition MP he’d previously met to secure support on the issue of CTE. Now he wanted to talk to her about fluoride.\nBy several accounts Shane was becoming increasingly intense - and he was frustrated. To him, it seemed so obvious - why did all involved not simply declare a connection between CTE and head injuries and concentrate support on those who need it.\nHe brought the same fervour to the fluoride debate with talking points from the conspiracy crowd.\nChristie’s approach left the MP frightened and she alerted Parliamentary Security. This was to become a pattern over the months ahead.\nIn March, Christie publicly asked Efeso Collins’ widow Vasa Fia if her husband died due to the Covid-19 vaccine.\nDuring a break in a court case he’d been following, he’d stumbled upon a press conference following a coroner’s court hearing for Collins’ inquest.\n“I just want to ask you, respectfully, but was there any word in the court hearing about the potential of the vaccine causing your husband’s passing, the Covid-19 vaccination?” Christie asked.\nThat was the end of that press conference. Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson shut it down and told Christie: “That is really unfortunate you chose to do this on a painful day.”\nIn Wellington, Christie was managed out of Parliament by security after he bailed up an MP’s staff member inside the complex.\nOn the anniversary of Guyton’s death in May, Christie was with John Ansell, the one-time creator of the infamous Iwi/Kiwi billboard for the National Party’s 2005 election campaign.\nIn recent years, Ansell - who has not replied to a request for comment - has embraced conspiracy theories and spoken to elements of Sovereign Citizen ideology.\nAnsell filmed himself walking outside Parliament with Christie, referring to him as a “young sporting hero” who could be a leading voice in the “truth” movement.\nAnsell said: “If cool people come out and make it okay then others will hopefully say, ‘well, if Shane can do it then so hopefully can I. I want to be cool too’.”\n“You have the skills to help make telling the truth popular because it sure as hell ain’t yet” he said.\nChristie said Ansell introduced him to “anthony-john of the house haddock”, the preferred address of Tairua’s Anthony Haddock, whose teachings align with elements of Sovereign Citizen beliefs. anthony-john has told the Herald he is not a Sovereign Citizen.\nChristie wrote of attending a six-hour meeting led by anthony-john, a man with “God in his eyes” and “one man I respect deeply”.\nHe described how, wearing shorts mid-winter, anthony-john stood barefoot on a cold concrete garage floor and used a felt-tip pen and paper to explain to those gathered how the system was corrupt.\nHe spoke of how laws are a bankrupt code that can be interpreted by using particular phrasing, and that a birth certificate creates an entity that is subject to a country’s laws. By shrugging off the name on the certificate, one can escape accountability.\nThis was why Christie called himself “living man Shane” when called to court in Thames after being issued with a trespass notice at the local council. His new name showed he was not an artificial construct of the law, he said.\nBy then, Christie was living at anthony-john’s Tairua home. The trespass notice had come as a result of Christie’s efforts to interview the local council’s mayor and chief executive.\nChristie wrote of his confidence as he was called to the dock: “Three months of living and breathing in ant’s world had prepared me to address a serious miscarriage of justice”.\nOn that day at the Thames court, with anthony-john at his side, Christie wrote how “the 40 year veil constricting my mind from freedom” had begun to lift.\nWhen the community magistrate insisted on calling him Mr Christie, he “made it clear to her I am alive and do not identify as your thing of imagination”.\nChristie wrote that the experience “finally opened my eyes to the fact the judicial system of New Zealand is an organised crime unit”.\nIn the end, he wrote of the magistrate entering a “not guilty” plea, pushing the case forward to a future date that will now never be heard.\nWhen Christie returned to Nelson on August 18, he had a new and different world view.\nShane Christie and a ‘dark place’\nIn Nelson, Christie launched into a fresh campaign. Nelson City Council was after dog registration fees for Rajah, the 11-year-old Rottweiler he had long called his “son”. Christie saw it as a further example of the government using its power in an unequal and illegal way.\nIn Nelson, an urban dog costs $115 a year. Christie posted on social media saying he’d asked the council if they could prove it was legal for it to demand the fee.\nSure we can, the council officer said.\nChristie requested a meeting, and set up a camera to record the interaction with two staff, in which he used talking points associated with the Sovereign Citizen movement.\nThe next video was Christie outside council, being handed another trespass notice by police and being told he couldn’t return.\nAnd the next video after that? That’s when he took Rajah out for his last meal and then shot him dead.\nThose who know Christie are both disturbed and defensive of what might be read into this. Rajah was old, as Christie says in the video, and his back legs no longer worked properly - including for toileting. He was a much-loved old dog who didn’t have much left to give.\nBut Holly Parkes, Christie’s close friend and former partner, spoke at his funeral about the day he called her and ran through his plan to put Rajah down.\n“I knew his brain injury was now in the driver’s seat” she said.\nIn the video, Christie talks about recovering Rajah’s bones so he could be reborn.\nHe also spoke about why he was putting Rajah down. “I believe that we need the ability to fully self-determine over our own affairs and I think with the way legislation, government, local government are set up - the police, the judicial system - they all take away the ability for us to make our own decisions.”\nMost would take their dog to the vets to be put down, he said. “But what it does is it takes away .. the pain of feeling love. I think it’s important that we all know exactly how our loved one dies.\n“And if our agencies and government and medical system are betraying us and not being transparent about the dangers of things like fluoride, the vaccine, pharmaceutical medication, then they are taking full authority over everything about us as men and women.\n“For me anyway, shooting Raj, I realised it is about the battle for the spirit. So taking Rajah’s life today is about me self-determining my own affairs and I want to be really observant about what it does to me.\n“I want to be observant of what influences I have when I post it on my social media and I’m doing it to try and get as close to the truth of the experience of taking my dog’s life as possible.”\nChristie was found later that day, crying and asking: “Have I done the right thing?”\nJohn Guyton reflects on the views Christie returned to Nelson with, and how some of those causes also appealed to his son. He sees men who adopted causes to balance out lives becoming more confused and difficult.\n“I think they feel so wronged. I think they want justice. Billy has done plenty of yelling. Billy did plenty. They feel ripped off.”\nFor Christie, exclusion from places the rest of us are accepted was a theme of his last year. And the more he found himself unwelcome, the more he was embraced by others who told him society was the enemy.\nGotlieb-Old: “I think he did wear himself too thin. And he got confused. This disease, you can only tackle one thing at a time.\n“Their brains can’t keep up but they try. And the harder they try, the more difficult it is to process anything and it’s frustrating and overwhelming. And that manifests into anger and despair.”\n‘Another kick in the guts’\nChristie had a lot to contend with, as did Guyton before him.\nChristie revealed some of Guyton’s writing during his final year: a mix of uplifting diary notes on how to be a better man, and anecdotes about how hard that is when your failing brain is tearing you apart.\nChristie and Guyton’s careers overlapped or touched edges. Both wore the Hurricanes jersey in 2013, they played side by side at Tasman for the Mako’s from 2013 to 2017. Christie played for the Māori All Blacks from 2013 to 2015 while Guyton joined the side in 2016.\nBoth experienced extreme symptoms. For Christie, they became extreme in 2023 after Billy Guyton died, including delusions and a series of psychotic episodes.\nJohn Guyton: “Every time this happens, it’s another kick in the guts.” He worries there will be no one to speak on CTE in New Zealand now Christie has gone.\n“How many are actually out there? There must be thousands. It’s definitely not just these two boys. It’s a dying cause, isn’t it?”\nHe says it with no humour or irony. “The foundation, that stands for quite a bit. We have to keep it going. It was for Billy and now Shane too because he created it.”\nTori Guyton says the same: the foundation needs an advocate and a sponsor.\nLater, John Guyton sends a text saying the Billy Guyton Foundation is to be wound up. Christie’s hope it would be a vehicle to increase awareness about CTE is likely over.\nEven before Christie’s death, Guyton forced himself to back away from fighting for the cause.\n“I had to pull back out of it. It f**ks you up. I had to put it away in a box because it f**ks you up.”\nPearce says more work needs to be done around any links between CTE and suicide. “Is suicide a key feature of CTE?” he asks.\nResearch has found suicide is disproportionately common among young athletes later diagnosed with CTE, with doctors saying the disease’s attacks on the frontal lobe produce symptoms recognised as suicide risk factors.\nSuicide, though, is complex - as is CTE.\nThere is so much that still needs to be discovered about CTE. Extreme behaviours or an inclination to extreme views? These too could be CTE.\nIt’s a frustrating disease because once you have it there is considered to be no way back.\nPearce says it can be crushing to discover that the mental health encouragement to speak to your mates and ring health lines doesn’t promise a positive outcome.\nFor CTE, there is only managing symptoms and quality of life.\nTori Guyton got the news about Christie’s death early Wednesday. Her phone was buzzing with messages of support, and she didn’t know why.\n“News travels really fast in Nelson. News travels too soon for its own good.” She got to Christie’s home and found an ambulance and police outside.\nIt was devastating and still is. “Shane was like a brother to me. I feel like I’ve lost a brother all over again. The brutal reality of CTE, I guess.”\nIn saying that, Tori Guyton, has assumed a diagnosis - as Christie did of himself. It will take a professional diagnosis of his brain to know for sure.\nShe saw Christie on Monday - two days after Rajah died and two days before Christie died - “and he was different for sure”.\nThere were so many plans. She says their next enterprise for the foundation was to take the Billy Guyton story to schools.\nAnd there was the upcoming inquest for Billy Guyton. Christie was coming to the meeting with the coroner in mid-September and preparing to testify at the inquest, likely to be held next year.\nChristie was planning to be around. And yet, she says, everyday life was challenging for him. He had truths to speak, like the NZ Rugby recommendations from his retirement report.\n“I think he had seen things weren’t changing and no one is listening. And that spoke volumes, especially when people in high places are not allowing him to speak.”\nTori Guyton drew parallels with the symptoms she saw in her brother: “Confusion, very paranoid, irrational thinking. Sometimes thinking the worst.”\nThese men, Tori Guyton says, “they just get put into categories of crazy or mad [but] they’re not crazy or mad”\n“They’re screaming out for help.”\nDavid Fisher is based in Northland and has worked as a journalist for more than 30 years, winning multiple journalism awards including being twice named Reporter of the Year and being selected as one of a small number of Wolfson Press Fellows to Wolfson College, Cambridge.
