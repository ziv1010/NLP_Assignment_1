  "body_text": "Gotham FC emerged victorious in the inaugural CONCACAF W Champions Cup on Saturday night, defeating Tigres UANL 1-0 on Saturday night at Estadio Universitario in Nuevo León, Mexico.\nA quick rebound by Esther González after she missed her penalty in the 82nd minute secured the historic win for the club. A strong first-half performance alongside a tight backline kept Gotham at the front throughout the game.\nThe victory gives Gotham the opportunity to compete for more trophies by securing a place in both the 2026 FIFA Women's Champions Cup and the 2028 FIFA Women's Club World Cup.\nGotham FC: 23 shots, 7 shots on target, 56% possession, 304 passes, 79% pass accuracy, 14 fouls, 6 corners, 1 save\nTigres UANL: 7 shots, 1 shot on target, 44% possession, 256 passes, 71% pass accuracy, 12 fouls, 3 corners, 6 saves\nGoals:\n• Gotham FC, Esther González, 82'\nAttendance: 17,264\nEsther González rebound\nIn a moment of brilliance, González stepped up when Gotham needed her most.\nAfter 81 minutes of tight play, Gotham broke the gridlock when Emily Sonnett was fouled on by Tigres defender Jimena López during a corner kick play. González took the penalty, aiming low down the middle before Tigres goalkeeper Itzel González saved the shot.\nEsther refused to take no for an answer, powering forward ahead of the rest of the Tigres squad to take possession of the ball and put it in the back of the net for the only goal of the game. Her performance won her Superior Player of the Match and Player of the Tournament.\n\"Every time she scores or earns one of these awards, everyone is genuinely happy for her because they respect her and appreciate her,\" said Gotham head coach Juan Carlos Amorós. \"She’s a very special person who gives everything on the field—for the team and for her teammates—always with a smile, always ready to work.\"\nThe goal was Esther's third of the tournament and eighth in all competitions this year. Her finish sealed Gotham's place in history and bodes well for her return to the international stage this coming week.\nTo her credit, Itzel performed strongly throughout the game. Despite facing a barrage of 23 shots from Gotham, the Tigres goalkeeper made six saves of the seven that were on target, including a double save shortly after the first minute and a saved penalty in first-half stoppage time. Her command in the box kept Tigres in the game for far longer than what could have been without her.\n\"All of the teams we faced brought amazing competition and showed different strengths,\" said Gotham midfielder Taryn Torres. \"Their possession style and ability to transition into counterattacks were really impressive, and it was definitely a challenge to match up against both of them.\"\nGritty offensive effort\nThe scoreline may have only showed a one-nil win, but the game proved to be much more complicated than that. It was scrappy, but Gotham managed to outlast Tigres with an attitude dead set on scoring.\nIn a tough first half, both teams held somewhat equal possession, although Gotham outshot Tigres 12 to four. Esther had two massive opportunities to score before halftime, one shot kicked wide in the 35th minute and another shot blocked by Itzel in the 43rd minute. It was a testament both to Tigres' grit and Gotham's inconsistency with finishing.\nStill, the club played a massive offensive strategy, taking 23 shots total with seven on target, using gaps left by Tigres' backline to capitalize on scoring chances with only Itzel to stop them. Gotham took control of the possession in the second half, determined to limit Tigres' attacks and use as much time as possible to put themselves in prime scoring positions.\nAfter a series of missed opportunities and blocked shots, Esther's lone goal won Gotham the championship.\n\"It’s truly an honor to be walking away with the trophy, and we’re just glad we were able to contribute on the field,\" said forward Sarah Schupansky. \"Qualifying for the [FIFA] Club World Cup for the first time is an incredible step forward for women’s football, and it’s going to be really exciting.\"\nMidge Purce and a tight backline\nGotham's backline held steadily for the entirety of the match, allowing Tigres the space to take just seven shots. Gotham goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger saved the only shot on target after a header by Tigres forward Stephany Mayor sent the ball right into her hands.\nGotham defender Midge Purce has since come back from her injury with renewed determination, and yesterday's championship match was no exception.\nPurce actively created chances for Gotham in the first half of the game, winning key duels and pushing for space for scoring opportunities. An attempted run up to goal in first-half stoppage time saw her tackled by Tigres defender Anika Rodríguez, granting her a penalty which Itzel saved. However, she didn't let that stop her, continuing to advance the ball forward while making way for Gotham's front line to have a chance to score.\n\"From the beginning, I felt that Gotham is a very different team and a very different club,\" said Amorós. \"With our owners, our players, and our staff, we’ve had high expectations from day one. Sometimes it’s hard to see that when you’re in the middle of league play and the focus in the U.S. is so heavily on regular-season matches. But for us, being here was incredibly important.\"\nThe club breaks for international duty this week, returning back to action at home in Sports Illustrated Stadium on June 7 against KC Current.",
