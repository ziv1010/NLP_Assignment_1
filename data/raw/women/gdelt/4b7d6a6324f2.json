  "body_text": "In a stunning development in the worldwide campaign to promote transgenderism, an athlete in the United Kingdom has been suspended for six matches for asking if her opponents are male.\nA report from the Christian Institute explained the 18-year-old, whose name was not being released, is accused of asking if “all their players are eligible to play. Look at their keeper and for example their No. 10 is obviously a man.”\nA referee who has been indoctrinated into the ideology reportedly threatened to ban her from play, and the athlete then asked her opponents about the issue.\nHer team was handed seven disciplinary points and the player was forced into an “online education” to correct her beliefs, the report said.\nShe explained she had raised the question because of the “extremely aggressive” style of play.\nShe pointed out she is not even being allowed to stand up for herself, because any comments could produce an extended banishment.\n“It’s disgraceful that another teenage girl has been suspended for daring to challenge the presence of a male player in a women’s game,” explained Fiona McAnena, of Sex Matters.\nThe nation’s Football Association claims it supports women’s athletics but it allows men who say they are women to be on women’s teams, despite charges that actually violates the nation’s 2010 Equality Act.",
