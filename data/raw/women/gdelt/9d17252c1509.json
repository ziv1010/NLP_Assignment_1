We need to be us, and that was everything I want to see from our team.\n\"Speed, quality, movement, two beautiful goals, we connected with our crowd and created an incredible atmosphere. They have been incredibly supportive of what we have done and we wanted to earn the right to be top of the league. We are, and happy to be there.\"\nOn Martin Odegaard, who scored two goals: \"He has 14 goals this season. His contribution to the team, his leadership skills, I'm really pleased with him.\"\n(All photos by Getty Images)\nLampard: 'We were too nice to play against'\nFrank Lampard spoke to the BBC after the defeat: \"Not good enough first half, that's what confirms the result. Much better second half, but not good enough first half.\n\"We were too nice to play against in all aspects in the first half. In the second half we played much more like a team that has a threat up top. In the first half we were too easy to play against.\n\"It's tough because you want to win games, but it's our job, we'll work on it.\"\nXhaka: 'Every game is a final for us'\nGranit Xhaka spoke to Sky Sports after the match: \"I think we deserved to win today, the first 60 minutes we had a very good game.\n\"We needed a distraction after four games without a win. Every game is a final for us. We have to go for it and hope that we can do something.\"\nOn keeping their foot on the gas in the second half: \"We spoke about this at half-time, that we wanted to go for a fourth and a fifth, but we were a little bit sloppy.\n\"We're disappointed with the second half but we can learn from this.\"\nOn his turnaround in fortune at Arsenal over the past few years: \"I try to give advice with my experience. I've had worse times than every player here, that's for sure.\n\"I try to help the youngsters to give them motivation.\n\"Of course if you lose four games you start to struggle, but this is my job.\"\nAzpilicueta: 'It's the worst run since I've been at the club'\nCesar Azpilicueta spoke to Sky Sports after the loss: \"The first half we were quite passive. We know they are a dangerous team and will bring a lot of people forward but we should've done better with the ball.\n\"In the second half we showed a bit of a reaction, in the first half we were far from there. It's tough for everybody, we're not in a good position. The reality is what we have now. We have to go through it.\n\"We are all disappointed, the fans at the club. We have to take responsibility and that's the only way. It's very hard, we didn't expect to be here but that's where we are. We have five games left, we have to show a positive energy and win games.\n\"It's the worst run since I've been at the club. We're the ones playing on the pitch and we have to turn this around. It's hard for everybody and we have to come through these moments. Off the pitch we have a lot of things to work on.\"\n(All photos by Getty Images)\nHow the table looks\nArsenal have moved back into first place, two points ahead of Manchester City, though City have played two fewer matches.\nChelsea remain languishing in 12th place, having taken just 39 points from 33 matches. Their next match sees them travel to Bournemouth, a club that also currently have 39 points...\nOdegaard: 'We needed this one'\nMartin Odegaard spoke to Sky Sports after scoring two goals in this match: \"Especially the first half was brilliant. We came out and showed a different spirit to last time.\n\"I'm very happy with the first half, the second was a bit messy but three points and a good win and we needed this one.\n\"Everyone was so hurt after the (loss against City). We used the anger and the disappointment to get back into this game. You can lose games but the way we lost, we didn't play our game and weren't ourselves, that was the most painful thing, and we wanted to show a different side and we definitely did.\n\"I just try to help the team. This year I've scored more goals, Granit (Xhaka) with two good passes and that made it easier. I just tried to be in the right area and as soon as I see him attacking the space I just have to be in the right place.\n\"In the second half we didn't keep the ball enough. They went a bit more direct and after the duels we didn't keep the ball.\n\"We have to fight and keep going. We believe and will fight until the end.\"\n(All photos by Getty Images)\nGoals galore at the Emirates\nTonight was Arsenal's 17th home match in the Premier League this season.\nThey failed to keep a clean sheet for the 14th time. Only Southampton have kept fewer clean sheets at home in the league this season.\nThe good news for Arsenal is that their opponents don't keep clean sheets at the Emirates either. Only once have Mikel Arteta's men failed to score at home in the league this season, in a 0-0 draw against Newcastle in January.\nWhen Jesus scores, his team doesn't lose\nGabriel Jesus has now scored in 55 Premier League matches. In those matches, he's remarkably never been on the losing side, winning 50 and drawing five.\nThis is now the most times a player has scored in a game in the competition without ever losing, overtaking James Milner who did so on 54 occasions.\n(All photos by Getty Images)\nKings of London\nArsenal have gone unbeaten in London derbies in a Premier League season (W10 D2) for the first time since 2004-05.\nThey have also become the first side to win 150 Premier League London derbies all-time.\nFrank Lampard = Arthur Cox\nAcross his stints at Everton and Chelsea, Frank Lampard has now lost each of the past 10 matches he’s taken charge of across all competitions.\nHe is the first manager to lose 10 in a row while in charge of a top-flight team since Arthur Cox in February 1988 with Derby.\n(All photos by Getty Images)\nUnderwhelming second half from Arsenal\nGood for Arsenal to get back to winning ways but that second half was underwhelming. Almost like they knew the cushion was there and relaxed rather than keeping control.\nHopefully the good work in the first half is enough to provide them with confidence and momentum for Sunday's big match against Newcastle.\nChelsea fortunate to avoid relegation zone\nIf the Premier League season had begun on October 29, Chelsea would be in the relegation zone:\n- 16th: West Ham (21 games, 20 points)\n- 17th: Leicester (22 games, 19 points)\n- 18th: Chelsea (22 games, 18 points)\n- 19th: Everton (22 games, 16 points)\n- 20th: Southampton (22 games, 12 points)\nShift of power in London\nArsenal now sit on 78 points, exactly double Chelsea's current total of 39.\nIt's a stunning turnaround from last season, when Chelsea finished with 74 while Arsenal totalled 69.\nDark days for Chelsea\nChelsea have now lost all six of Frank Lampard's matches in charge of the club.\nIt's their longest losing streak since a six-match run in October/November 1993.\nChelsea have also now lost 20 games in all competitions this season, their most since losing 20 in the 1987-88 season.\nFT: Arsenal 3-1 Chelsea\nArsenal move back into first place with a comfortable win over their London rivals.\nGallagher booked\n90+5' Arsenal 3-1 Chelsea\nGallagher clatters White and receives a yellow card.\nTeam Stats\nARS\nCHE\nGame Details",
