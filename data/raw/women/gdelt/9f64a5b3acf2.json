  "body_text": "The ACC now stretches from sea to shining sea, with 18 women’s basketball programs set to belong to the conference beginning in the 2024-25 season. In February, the conference released the conference matchups for the 2024-25 and 2025-26 seasons, determining all teams’ home and away opponents for the next two seasons.\nFighting Irish emerge as early favorites in an expanding ACC\nStanford, Cal and SMU will join the ACC before the 2024-25 season, taking the conference to 18 teams. But, who will be No. 1? Right now, Notre Dame has the edge.\nAdditional changes, however, could be on the horizon, as both Florida State and Clemson are suing to leave the conference. Both schools are challenging the conference’s right to charge an exit fee of more than $100 million. Earlier this week, a judge in Tallahassee ordered that FSU and the ACC to enter mediation.\nFor now, let’s turn our attention to the drama that could unfold on the basketball court, rather in the court of law.\nStanford, Cal and SMU join the ACC\nTwo teams from northern California and one from Texas are now in the Atlantic Coast Conference? Sure. Thanks college football.\nThe Stanford team that will cross the country to compete in the ACC will look much different from the Cardinal teams we’ve come to know. First, for the first season since 1985, Tara VanDerveer will not be perched on the Stanford sideline, professorially assessing the action. The retirement of VanDerveer opened the way for longtime assistant Kate Paye to take over the program. However, the expected differences for the Cardinal also extend onto the court, as the team has lost its two best players, with Cameron Brink heading to the WNBA (and staying in California) and Kiki Iriafen entering the transfer portal (and possibly staying in California as well). Their absences leave Stanford at a talent deficit, a rare position for one of the sport’s legacy programs. It’s also a position not easily rectifiable by the transfer portal due to the school’s stringent academic requirements. Will the former Pac-12 power become a mere middle-of-the-pack program in the ACC?\nWhile Cal just scored their first winning season under head coach Charmin Smith, the Golden Bears are unlikely to emerge as ACC contenders. The same goes for SMU, which just finished 11th in the much-less-competitive AAC.\nChanges at Miami, Clemson and Virginia Tech\nA retirement at Miami, a firing a Clemson and a hiring away from Virginia Tech has resulted in Tricia Cullop taking over in Coral Gables, Shawn Poppie grabbing the reins at Clemson and Megan Duffy assuming control in Blacksburg.\nUpon the retirement of former head coach Katie Meir, eight Hurricanes entered the transfer portal. Haley Cavinder, however, decided to remain in South Florida, and her twin sister, Hanna, who retired from college basketball after the 2023 season, also is returning to The U to exercise her final year of eligibility. But it looks like Cullop will need to work the portal to round out her roster. Thus far, only forward Daniela Abies, who just completed her sophomore season at Wichita State, is transferring to Miami.\nPoppie, in contrast, quickly has used the portal to begin bolstering the Tigers. Most recently, he lured Loyal McQueen away from Alabama, with the fifth-year point guard representing one of the most significant signings for an ACC squad. Grad forwards Summah Evans, by way of Mercer, and Tessa Miller, from Belmont, also have committed to the Tigers, while soon-to-be sophomore guard Hannah Kohn followed Poppie from Chattanooga to Clemson. Additionally, two Tigers who had entered the portal, rising senior guards Madi Ott and Maddi Cluse, have decided to stick with Clemson. However, Clemson did lose the highest-ranked recruit in school history with the coaching change, with former signee Imari Berry instead committing to Louisville.\nThere’s been less action at Virginia Tech, where Duffy will not have the services of guard Georgia Amoore or center Clara Strack, both of whom followed former Hokies head coach Kenny Brooks to Kentucky. It’s worth watching to see if forward Liza Karlen, who played for Duffy at Marquette and has a year of eligibility remaining, takes her talents to Virginia Tech after entering the transfer portal.\nAre the Irish the early favorites?\nThe 2024 ACC Tournament champions not only look to be the best team in the conference, but also one of the best in the nation in 2024-25. After missing all of last season recovering from injury, the electric Olivia Miles is expected to be back on the court for the Fighting Irish, forming one of the country’s most threatening backcourts alongside ACC Freshman of the Year Hannah Hidalgo. Supporting stars Sonia Citron and Maddy Westbeld remain in South Bend, while guard KK Bransford, who had entered the portal, opted to stay at Notre Dame. Kate Koval, the No. 5 ranked recruit in the class of 2024, also is set to join head coach Niele Ivey’s squad.\nNotre Dame will have a number of challengers for the conference crown, beginning with a NC State team that just reached the Final Four. The Wolfpack backcourt of Saniya Rivers and Aziaha James rivals that of Notre Dame. On top of that dynamic duo, there’s Zoe Brooks, Madison Hayes and incoming five-star recruit Zamareya Jones, giving NC State one of the strongest perimeter corps in the conference, if not the nation. The Wolfpack frontcourt, in contrast, currently is a question mark, as both River Baldwin and Mimi Collins are out of eligibility. Duke appears poised to build on a surprise Sweet 16 appearance, welcoming the nation’s fifth-ranked recruiting class to Durham, headlined by dunking Canadian Toby Fournier. Things are more uncertain for the Triangle’s third team, North Carolina. While do-it-all wing Alyssa Ustby is exercising her final year of eligibility, guard Deja Kelly has entered the transfer portal, although she indicated returning to the Tar Heels is an option.\nExpect Louisville and Florida State also to be heard from in ACC play. Virginia’s improvement over the course of last season, propelled by rising sophomore guard Kymora Johnson, suggests the Cavaliers could make more noise in the conference as well.\nMost Popular\n- Who will survive and advance as Unrivaled’s 1-on-1 Tournament continues with the second round and quarter finals?\n- Catch up on all the action, upsets and more from the first-round of Unrivaled’s 1-on-1 Tournament\n- Who will be the first-round winners in Unrivaled’s 1-on-1 Tournament?\n- Courtney Williams, Saniya Rivers and Azurá Stevens swapped in first-ever Unrivaled in-season trade\n- 2026 WNBA Mock Draft 1.0: Dallas Wings go with upside at No. 1 in this first-round scenario",
