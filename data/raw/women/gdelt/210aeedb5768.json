The most\ncommon languages spoken at home after English are Chinese, Russian, Greek,\nArabic, Spanish, Vietnamese, Indonesian and Korean.\nTo establish\nRedfern-Waterloo as an active, vibrant and sustainable community by promoting\nand supporting greater social cohesion and community safety, and respect for\nthe cultural heritage and orderly development of the area in consideration of\nsocial economic ecological and other sustainable development.\nThe Hon. Frank Sartor MP\nMinister for Redfern-Waterloo\nParliament House\nMacquarie Street\nSydney\nDear Minister Sartor\nIt is with pleasure that\nI forward you the third Annual Report of the Redfern-Waterloo Authority for the\nyear ending 30 June 2007.\nThis report has been\nprepared in accordance with the NSW Annual Report legislation and the\nRedfern-Waterloo Authority Act 2004 No 107.\nYours Sincerely\nRobert Domm\nChief Executive Officer Redfern-Waterloo Authority\nWe are pleased to\npresent the third Annual Report of the Redfern-Waterloo Authority, which was\nestablished on 17 January 2005.\nIn this, our second full\nfinancial year, many initiatives have been implemented to further promote\ninvestment in the operational area and to provide jobs and training for local\nunemployed, particularly within the Indigenous community.\nA sound strategic\nplatform has been laid for Redfern-Waterloo's future growth and social\ncohesion.\nOver the last 12 months,\nwe have continued to focus our efforts on further developing the\nRedfern-Waterloo Plan, which is being implemented as part of the Government's\n10-year urban renewal strategy. The three main components are Human Services,\nEmployment & Enterprise and the Built Environment.\nStage One of the Built\nEnvironment Plan was released on 30 August 2006 and is primarily a planning\nframework to encourage future economic growth and the creation of up to 18,000\njobs throughout Redfern-Waterloo. The blueprint includes plans to generate more\nthan 444,000sqm of new employment space, 2,000 new homes, a new Town Centre,\nimproved pedestrian access to our residential and business hubs and better\nurban design.\nWe have also been\ndriving and monitoring the implementation of Phase One of the Human Services\nPlan and the Employment and Enterprise Plan. Both Plans aim to enhance the\nlives of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged within our community.\nA draft Human Services\nPlan (Phase Two) was finalised in 2007 that outlines key strategies for the\nimprovement of services to older people, people with disabilities, homeless\npeople and migrant communities. The RWA's small but dedicated Human Services\nreform team has worked assiduously in bringing disparate stakeholders together\nto generate momentum for beneficial changes within the local community.\nRedfern-Waterloo is\nundergoing transformation with more than $500 million earmarked for urban\nrenewal and a significant investment by the RWA as part of the NSW Governments\n10 year plan.\nThe RWA has entered into\nan agreement with ATP Partnership Ltd for a landmark $123 million development\nat Australian Technology Park which is due to commence construction in late\n2007. Under the agreement, the Seven Network and their publishing company,\nPacific Magazines (along with other commercial tenants), will relocate to the\nsite within the next two years to occupy a 43,500sqm state-of-the-art media\ncentre. This will be Redfern's largest commercial development in more than 10\nyears and will create 600 construction and 2000 permanent jobs, including 6o for\nIndigenous construction workers. The multiplier effect in respect to further\ninvestment and jobs coming to Redfern is expected to be very significant.\nThe RWA has directly\ncommitted over $54 million at Australian\nTechnology Park\nfor the construction of new roads and associated infrastructure as well as the\ndevelopment of an 11,000 sqm research facility. The new building will house\nNational ICT Australia and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation and\nis due for completion in November 2007, while the finish date for the new Henderson Road\nentrance, internal roads and landscaping is October 2007.\nArts NSW's new $40\nmillion Contemporary Performing Arts Centre in North Eveleigh at the heritage\nCarriageWorks building opened its doors in January 2007 to the Sydney Festival.\nIt continues to bring new vibrancy and life to the formerly dilapidated\nindustrial site.\nRWA has also committed\n$3 million to the refurbishment of North Eveleigh's\nheritage Blacksmiths' Workshop adjoining the Performing Arts Centre to create a\ncommunity market, arts space and car park. A development application was lodged\nin June 2007 and the new multi-purpose facility is scheduled to commence\noperation by mid 2008.\nThe RWA has also\ninvested a further $6m for the Eveleigh Heritage Walk - a pedestrian/cycle\nbridge over the rail corridor to link ATP with North\nEveleigh.\nA further $750,000 has\nbeen spent by the RWA at North Eveleigh for\nthe Yaama Dhiyaan Training Centre which become operational in October 2006. The\nCentre offers job ready courses in hospitality and construction to local\nunemployed. This includes Australia's\nfirst and only Indigenous hospitality centre and café, Yaama Dhiyaan. Fifty-one\nstudents have already graduated in Certificate II Hospitality (Operations)\nalong with certificates in Barista, Responsible Alcohol Service and Responsible\nGaming Service. Directly underneath Yaama, the RWA's Les Tobler Construction\nTraining Centre has commenced producing graduates from the Koori Job Ready\nCourse to take advantage of the development opportunities opening up in\nRedfern-Waterloo.\nA major investment by\nthe Indigenous Land Corporation of $45 million has been committed to the\ndevelopment of a National Indigenous Development Centre at the former Redfern Public School. The ILC's purchase of the\nschool from the Department of Education and Training was successfully brokered\nby the RWA. The ILC expects project approval in late 2007 with the Centre to\nbecome operational in 2009.\nA concept plan was also\nlodged by the RWA in June for the proposed $50 million residential development\nof the former Rachel\nForster Hospital\nsite in Redfern. The RWA's sale of the site in late 2007 will provide funding\nfor the transformation of the former Redfern Police Station and Courthouse into\na $10 million Community Health Centre. The new health centre is expected to\ncommence construction in early 2008 and become operational in 2009.\nIn June, the NSW\nGovernment announced a major $27 million public housing redevelopment at\nElizabeth Street Redfern that will create 106 modern and eco-friendly\ndwellings. In addition, the Department of Housing will sell adjoining land for\na private residential development of 158 new dwellings.\nThe RWA's commitment to\nthe implementation of the Built Environment Plan includes developing an\nAffordable Housing Contributions Plan, which will deliver about $35 million or\n75 affordable housing dwellings in Redfern-Waterloo over the next 10 years. The\nRWA will also be able to deliver an additional $23 million for affordable\nhousing under the agreement it negotiated with the former owner over the future\ndevelopment of the CUB site in Chippendale. $16 million of the total funds\navailable will be committed to affordable housing specifically for Aboriginal\nresidents, which will be in addition to housing owned or proposed by the\nAboriginal Housing Company on AHC land in and around The Block in Redfern.\nThe RWA Contributions\nPlan will also deliver about $37 million in developer contributions for public\ndomain and other public works as a result of future development in the area\nunder the RWA's Built Environment Plan.\nIn partnership with the\nDepartment of Housing, the RWA has commenced work on Stage Two of the Built\nEnvironment Plan, which includes the aim of improving public housing stock,\nenhancing the mix of housing types and tenancies in order to reduce the\nconcentration of public housing, establishing a more sustainable social mix and\nfacilitating affordable housing.\nDr Col Gellatly Chairperson\nRobert Domm Chief Executive Officer\nA sound strategic platform\nhas been laid for Redfern-Waterloo's future growth and social cohesion\nThe RWA Contributions\nPlan will deliver about $37 million for public domain and other public works.\nThe Redfern-Waterloo\nAuthority (RWA) was created by a NSW Government Act of Parliament in Oct 200q\n(Redfern-Waterloo Authority Act 200q No 107) and established on 17 January\n2005.\nThe RWA is responsible\nfor revitalising Redfern, Waterloo, Eveleigh and\nDarlington through strategic urban renewal,\njob creation and improved human services in consideration of social, economic,\necological and other sustainable development, public spaces, Aboriginal\ncommunity needs, social cohesion and community safety.\nThe RWA is responsible\nfor… strategic urban renewal, job creation and improved human services\nWORK IN PROGRESS -\nRedfern-Waterloo is undergoing transformation with more than $500 million\nearmarked for urban renewal and a significant investment by the RWA as part of\nthe NSW Governments 10 year plan.\nIN PROGRESS:\n- Australian Technology Park\n- National ICT Australia\nBuilding\n- Seven Network and Pacific Magazines\nDevelopment\n- Contemporary Performing Arts Centre\n- Yaama Dhiyaan Training Centre\n- Eveleigh Heritage Walk\n- National Indigenous Development\nCentre\n- Community Health Centre\n- Blacksmith's Workshop Community\nMarkets\n- Former Rachel Forster\nHospital Residential\nDevelopment Site\n- Elizabeth\nStreet Public Housing Development\n- To encourage the urban renewal of\nRedfern—Waterloo\ninto an active, vibrant and sustainable community;\n- To promote, support and respect the\nAboriginal community in Redfern-Waterloo with regards to the importance of\nthe area to the Aboriginal people;\n- To promote the orderly development\nof Redfern-Waterloo whilst taking into consideration principles of social,\neconomic, ecological and other sustainable development;\n- To provide and promote housing\nchoices in the operational area;\n- To enable the establishment of\npublic areas in Redfern-Waterloo; and\n- To promote greater social cohesion\nand community safety in Redfern—Waterloo.\nIn order to achieve its\nprinciple objectives, the RWA maintains an undertaking to:\n- Promote, facilitate, manage and\nsecure the social, economic, ecological and other sustainable development\nand use of the operational area, including the development and management\nof land, the provision of infrastructure and the establishment of public\nareas;\n- Provide and promote housing choices\nin the operational area (including for Aboriginal residents);\n- Provide and promote employment\nopportunities for local residents, commercial opportunities for local\nbusinesses and cultural development (including the needs of the Aboriginal\ncommunity) in the operational area;\n- Enhance and manage public places in\nthe operational area and to improve, maintain and regulate the use of\nthose public places;\n- Promote, co-ordinate, organise,\nmanage, undertake, secure, provide and conduct cultural, educational,\ncommercial, recreational, entertainment and transport activities and\nfacilities in the operational area; and\n- Do any other thing for the\nsustainable improvement of the operational area.\nSee full PDF for\nOrganisational diagram\nPromote, facilitate,\nmanage and secure the social, economic, ecological and other sustainable\ndevelopment and use of the operational area.\nThe Minister for\nRedfern-Waterloo, the Hon.
