Free streaming service RTE is also home to The Traitors Ireland. But can you watch RTE in the U.K., U.S.A. and Canada too? Below we will explain exactly how you can access RTE from anywhere in the world.\nRTE doesn't just appease to rugby fans either, it's the place to go for UEFA Championships League, golf, racing and much much more for live sports fans. RTE recently announced an agreement to extend their broadcasting rights of the Six Nations until 2029, much to the delight of rugby fans.\nWhilst RTE is a breeze to use in Ireland, unfortunately fans of their coverage can't access their great content outside of the country. However, where there's a will, there's a way and in this guide, we'll show you exactly how to watch RTE no matter where you are in the world.\nHow to watch RTE live in Ireland\nIn order to watch RTE online, you can do so through their RTE Player service. The great thing about RTE's online player is that you don't even need an account to watch all your favorite shows on their platform.\nIreland residents can enjoy a plethora of content via their RTE 1 and RTE 2 channels and can even put some TV on for the kids using their RTE jr channel or keep up to date with worldly affairs on their RTE News channel.\nAll you need to do is head over to RTE Player find the series or live TV you want to watch and click play, it's as simple as that.\nOutside of Ireland and want to access RTE? Here's how to unlock all their great content...\nHow to watch RTE live abroad\nRTE is our #1 streaming service for Irish residents\nIf you're outside of Ireland and want to use RTE to catch up on your favorite series or watch some live sports, you can do so by using a VPN. NordVPN is our favorite to use as they boast excellent speeds, the power needed for streaming, great security as well as more excellent features. NordVPN is the best choice to unblock your RTE stream from anywhere in the world.\nRTE users travelling outside of Ireland will know all too well the pain of trying to access your account, only to be blocked from logging in when you're outside the country.\nHowever, there are ways around this issue to make accessing your RTE account quick and seamless, just as if you were at home.\nSigning up to NordVPN gives you the power to unblock your RTE account from anywhere in the world. No matter where you are travelling to, using Nord gives you the ability to connect to any country's server virtually, in this case, Ireland.\nFor example, if you're travelling to Canada for work or vacation, NordVPN will allow you to connect a server in your home country and access your streaming accounts. All you need to do is turn on your VPN and select 'Ireland' from the listed countries and you'll have the ability to login to your RTE account and watch your favorite show just as if you were at home.\nLive sports on RTE\nAs stated above, RTE broadcasts a wide range of live sporting events.\nThe Irish network boasts the rights to this years UEFA Champions League coverage, which they share with Virgin Media. As well as midweek European football, viewers can also enjoy RTE's overnight coverage of the 2025 World Athletics Championships with commentary provided by Greg Allen and David Matthews for this years events in Tokyo.\nAs well as track and field events, RTE also holds the broadcasting rights for the Women's Rugby World Cup which is streaming live on their RTE Player as well as retaining the rights to the Six Nations as mentioned before.\nRTE also offer sports fans some live golf and horseracing as they are the exclusive home of the Irish Open and will show the Galway races as well as select races from Punchestown.\nWhat's on RTE?\nIf reality TV is what helps you unwind after a long day, RTE is the place to go. There's plenty of reality options including coverage of the Love Island franchise as well as Traitors.\nIf you're looking for some soaps or a good series to sink your teeth into, you can watch the likes of Eastenders on RTE or even catch up on episodes of Kin or Normal People.\nThere's even comedy options too, with Ireland's famous series, Mrs Brown's Boys, available to watch on their streaming platform.\nSo head over to RTE for all your entertainment needs and vices as they've got you covered for every genre. Remember, use a VPN if you're travelling outside of Ireland.\nWhy should you use a VPN to watch RTE live?\nEven if you live in Ireland at the moment, the second you leave the country for work or leisure, you'll lose the ability to access RTE without a VPN (a risk not worth taking).\nA VPN will always be there for when you need it, no matter where you are in the world, a VPN offers you a route back to your favorite streaming platforms (RTE).\nThe great thing about VPN's is that they also encrypt your browsing data, keeping all your data private from cybercriminals (and the government) but also your internet service provider too.\nWhat is the best VPN for RTE?\nWe specialize in testing and reviewing VPN services and NordVPN is the one we rate best. It's fast, has top-level security features, and has a brilliant track record when it comes to unblocking streamers like RTE. It's terrific value too, and with over 7,000 servers across 110 countries, we thoroughly recommend it.\nMore from Tom's Guide\nWe test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses. For example: 1. Accessing a service from another country (subject to the terms and conditions of that service). 2. Protecting your online security and strengthening your online privacy when abroad. We do not support or condone the illegal or malicious use of VPN services.
