It’s one step at a time because as I always say, God”s time is the best.”\nThis is the fifth time that the Olympique Lyonnaise forward has been nominated for the award currently held by Nigerian Asisat Oshoala, who was not nominated this year.\nAs for Temwa, who could not be reached for comment yesterday, it is the second time.\nIn a separate interview, National Women’s Football Association chairperson Adellaide Migogo said she fancies the Chawinga sisters’ chances this time around.\nDuring the 2023/24 season, Tabitha won the golden boot, Players’ Player of the Season and Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards in her debut French Women’s top-flight with Paris Saint Germain (PSG), whom she guided to the Coupe de France, league runners-up slot and the semi-finals in the Uefa Women’s Champions League.\nOn her part, Temwa has won the US National Women’s Soccer League golden boot with a record 20 goals and was voted MVP in her debut season in which she also helped her club Kansas City Current to win two cups though they missed out on the league which was won by Banda’s Orlando Pride.\nThe awards gala is scheduled for December 16 in Marrakech, Morocco.\nThe 2024 CAF Awards cover the period from January to October this year.\nIn its statement, CAF said: “This year’s nominees reflect the excellence in women’s football across the continent after their impressive performances at club and national team level.”\nApart from individual accolades, the awards also recognise the contributions of national teams and clubs.\nThe nominees for CAF Women’s National Team of the Year are Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and the Cameroon Under-20 side, while Club of the Year contenders include TP Mazembe (DR Congo), AS FAR (Morocco), and Mamelodi Sundowns (South Africa).\nThe winners of each category will be determined through votes from the CAF Technical Committee, media professionals, head coaches and captains of member associations as well as clubs participating in the group stages of Interclub competitions.",
