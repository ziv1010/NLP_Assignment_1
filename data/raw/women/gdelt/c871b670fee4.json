When asked for the result of the England-Australia football match, Alexa said there was no match, reports BBC.\nAcademic Joanne Rodda, a senior lecturer in psychiatry at Kent and Medway Medical School, said it showed \"sexism in football was embedded in Alexa”.

A company spokesperson was quoted as saying that this was an error that has been fixed.\nDr Rodda said it was “pretty sad that after almost a decade of Alexa, it's only today that the AI algorithm has been fixed so that it now recognises woman's World Cup football as football”.\nAmazon said it had automated systems that use AI to understand the context and pull out the most relevant information, but the systems got it wrong in this case. The company added it expected the AI systems to get better over time.\nThe incident highlights the issue of bias being embedded in systems powered by the booming AI sector, the report noted.\n\"Out of interest, I just asked Alexa who the Arsenal football team is playing in October. It replied with information about the men's team, and wasn't able to give an answer when I asked specifically about women's fixtures,” said Dr Rodda.\nThe Lionesses beat Australia 3-1.\nStay informed on all the latest news, real-time breaking news updates, and follow all the important headlines in india news andworld News on Zee News.\nLive Tv",
