  "body_text": "Premier League live news updates: Man Utd takeover latest; Euro qualifiers and more\nLatest headlines\nNews\n- Man Utd to vote on Ratcliffe stake as Qataris pull out\n- Man Utd takeover: The 12 who will decide on Ratcliffe bid\n- Belgium vs Sweden abandoned after Swedish nationals shot dead in Brussels\n- Southgate 'doesn't understand' Henderson boos\n- Euro 2024 - who's qualified and state of play\n- Man Utd wait on Casemiro injury\nFeatures and analysis\n- The search for Liverpool's next sporting director\n- Explained: The Premier League's 'new deal for football'\n- Reviewing the weekend's WSL action\nPodcasts\nWilson boosts Wales hopes\nHarry Wilson celebrated his 50th cap with a brilliant double as Wales boosted their Euro 2024 automatic qualification hopes with a 2-1 win over Croatia in Cardiff.\nWilson rewarded an excellent home performance with two clinical second-half strikes, enough to stave off a late Croatia rally that saw Mario Pasalic convert 15 minutes from time.\nWales came into the contest knowing victories in their final three group games were probably necessary to secure a top-two place and avoid the play-offs in March.\nRob Page's side still have to work to do in November - away to Armenia and at home to group leaders Turkey - but upsetting the 2022 World Cup semi-finalists in such fashion offers great encouragement.\nThis win takes Wales into second place above Croatia by virtue of them having done better in their head-to-head ties — and eases some pressure on manager Rob Page, who awoke to newspaper headlines on Saturday morning linking Roy Keane to his job.\nSpain - and Scotland - qualify for Euro 2024\nSpain have qualified for Euro 2024 after beating Norway 1-0 — and the Group A result means Scotland are also through to next summer's finals.\nGavi scored what proved the winner in the 55th minute, with the goal awarded after a lengthy VAR review.\nErling Haaland's Norway needed to win to keep their automatic qualification hopes alive but failed to overturn the deficit in Oslo.\nSteve Clarke's side have now qualified for back-to-back European Championships and have done it, like Luis de la Fuente's team, with two games to spare.\nTurkey also qualified by thrashing visitors Latvia 4-0 to ensure they will finish in the top two in Group D.\nWhat could Ratcliffe deal mean for Man Utd hierarchy?\nMuch depends on how much control Sir Jim Ratcliffe would get with his 25 per cent stake if it is voted through. Sources say his deal is premised on influence over sporting decisions, which brings uncertainty to the entire current football department.\nSir Dave Brailsford is Ratcliffe’s sporting guru at his cycling team and Nice, the Ligue 1 side he owns, and would be expected to get a job at United. What that means for football director John Murtough, and those who work under him, is currently unclear.\nErik ten Hag’s position is thought to be safe.\nTalks over Richard Arnold’s role as chief executive would also be anticipated, although that may depend on if, when and how Ratcliffe increases his holding.\nMead makes Arsenal impact on comeback appearance\nBeth Mead made an impact on her first appearance in nearly a year as she helped Arsenal snatch a 2-1 win over Aston Villa in the Women's Super League on Sunday.\nMead, who had not played since tearing her anterior cruciate ligament last November, came off the bench in the 87th minute to a rousing reception from the home fans in a 35,829 crowd at The Emirates, before assisting Alessia Russo's winner seven minutes later.\nRusso delivered further drama after Katie McCabe had equalised in the 92nd minute following a first-half Maz Pacheco goal that had Villa looking poised to take the points.\nMead, 28, won the Golden Boot and Player of the Tournament in England's Euro 2022 triumph but was sidelined for this year's World Cup in Australia, where the Lionesses were finalists.\n\"Pretty special,\" Mead told the BBC on returning after her long-term knee injury. \"It's been obviously a long, tough injury but the fans here today were incredible. I got a bit emotional running on the pitch but amazing to be back, so amazing.\"\nArsenal were heading for a second straight home defeat before the late turnaround, which sees them move to four points from three matches, while Villa have yet to pick up a point.\nSir Jim Ratcliffe in profile\nSir Jim Ratcliffe, 71 later this week, owns the petrochemicals giant INEOS, which says it comprises 36 businesses at 194 sites in 29 countries with more than 26,000 employees.\nHis net worth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, is $13.6billion but the Sunday Times Rich List — an annual list compiled by the British newspaper — estimated him to be worth £29.6bn, making him the second-richest man in the UK.\nHe describes himself as a boyhood United fan, although he did make an attempt to purchase Chelsea when the club was for sale in 2022.\nRatcliffe is a UK tax exile who backed Brexit, albeit a soft one, and thinks the UK government’s stance on fracking is “pathetic”.\nHe grew up in Failsworth, a few miles from Manchester city centre, and then his family moved across the Pennines to Yorkshire, where he was enrolled at Beverley Grammar School, just north of Hull.\nHe read chemical engineering at Birmingham University, then worked for Esso after graduation, before moving into private equity at Advent International.\nIn 1992, he co-founded chemicals firm Inspec, and six years later formed INEOS.\nHe also already owns two football teams: Lausanne-Sport, since 2017; and Nice, his other “local” club — close to his home in the south of France, 13 miles west of Monaco.\nAnd it’s not just football: Ratcliffe owns one-third of the successful Mercedes F1 organisation; the INEOS Britannia sailing team, helmed by English multi-Olympic gold medallist Sir Ben Ainslie; and the INEOS Grenadiers cycling team.\nHe also has a pub, The Grenadier, in London’s Belgravia; Lime Wood, a five-star hotel in the New Forest National Park; Le Portetta, a ski resort in Courchevel, France; and two super yachts, named Hampshire and Hampshire II.\nMUST calls for clarity - and 'club interests before own interests'\nManchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST) has released a statement following the latest development in the club's ownership saga, calling for \"clarity\" and urging all parties to put \"Manchester United interests before their own interests\".\nUnited's board is set to vote on selling a minority stake in the club to British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe after Sheikh Jassim’s Qatari group claimed on Saturday to have withdrawn from the race.\nA MUST statement on Sunday read: \"It would be wildly optimistic to think the Glazers are acting in the interests of supporters or are making ownership decisions which don’t centre on their own priorities.\n\"However, what supporters should expect at the very least now is some clarity and an end to this process. Furthermore the outcome must include new investment into the club. It cannot be solely about the interests of shareholders, whether existing or new.\n\"We call upon all parties to put Manchester United interests before their own interests.\"\nOn Ratcliffe's INEOS potentially obtaining a 25 per cent stake in United, MUST listed a number of questions to which it sought answers, including impact on the share structure, the ambition for investment in infrastructure and whether or not there was \"a clear path to a change of majority ownership locked in beyond an initial transaction i.e. are the Glazers going even if it isn’t immediate?\"\nMUST added: \"While we wait for answers to these questions everyone needs to put our football club first at this time and as fans we need to be unified both in the backing of the team and on demands for the best ownership and investment for the club.\"\nSpalletti will judge Italy against England\nLuciano Spalletti praised Italy for a professional 4-0 win over Malta on Saturday — but said they would really be able to judge their potential against England on Tuesday.\nItaly face England at Wembley Stadium, where a win would put them level on points with Gareth Southgate's side, who will themselves clinch a place at the finals with a victory.\n\"That is a match where we can really see what our potential is,\" Spalletti said.\n\"Once we have played, then I'll tell you what that potential is.\"\nOn Saturday's game, he added: \"The important thing is the three points, never letting it be in doubt, without taking this test lightly, showing a professional attitude.\n\"You can see these players are eager to get to know each other more and play good football, so we are pretty pleased.\"\nMessi's Inter Miami heading to China\nLionel Messi’s Inter Miami have announced two exhibition games in China next month.\nThe team, which was eliminated from the Major League Soccer play-offs, will play friendly fixtures against Qingdao Hainiu on November 5 and then another Chinese Super League side, Chengdu Rongcheng, in Chengdu on November 8.\nInter Miami did not specifically mention the involvement of Messi or any other player, though the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner was a central figure on the club’s social media announcement.\nFull story below.\nWho cares about FIFA rankings?\nA follower of another sport might read tributes to the retiring Eden Hazard this week and question why what looks like his most salient achievement was omitted.\nThere were mentions of the great goals, the league titles and the player of the year awards, but barely a nod to him taking Belgium to the top of the world.\nHazard was his country’s captain between 2015 and 2022. And towards the end of that period, between October 2018 and February 2022, Belgium topped the FIFA World Rankings for more than three years.\nNot only were Belgium ranked first, their lengthy stint at the top — extended, in fairness, because fewer international games were played during that time due to the COVID-19 pandemic — means only Brazil and Spain have spent longer as the highest-ranked nation since the rankings were introduced in 1992.\nBut the realistic reason no one mentioned Belgium’s status as world No 1 is much simpler: no one in football cares about the rankings.\nWhy do they exist? And why does nobody seem to care? Read on...\nEuro 2024 qualifying state of play\nThe bid to reach Euro 2024 in Germany is gathering pace, with just three matchdays remaining.\nTen group winners and the same number of runners-up will qualify for the finals, with the remaining three spots decided via the 2022-23 Nations League play-offs in March 2024.\nHere's what we know so far:\nQualified for Euro 2024: Germany (hosts), France, Belgium, Portugal\nAssured of at least a play-off spot (based on Nations League rankings): Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Greece, Israel, Italy, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Scotland, Serbia, Spain, Turkey\nCannot finish in top two: Andorra, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Malta, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland, San Marino\nMan Utd supporter groups call for unity\nManchester United supporter groups have called for unity among the fanbase amid the ongoing campaign to oust the Glazer family from power at Old Trafford.\nSix influential fan bodies have released a joint statement, which says: \"Many support protest, many support dialogue and many support both — they are complementary. For the greater good of our club, let’s work towards our shared goals, set aside what divides us, and respect that different people, working towards the same goal, will have different strategies to get there.\"\nPressure movement The 1958, a collection of United fans protesting Glazer ownership, had last week called for an end to dialogue with the club, claiming such discussions have been used \"as a tool for manipulation and deception\".\nA fan advisory board (FAB) was established in 2021 in the wake of the aborted Super League plan, with co-chairman Joel Glazer, the sibling with greatest involvement in the running of the club, speaking directly to chosen supporters once every three months, alongside club executives.\nBut Glazer has not attended any of the meetings since the launch of the strategic review last November and The 1958 believe fans should cut all communication.\nUnited also have a fans' forum, where 19 representatives from various fan backgrounds engage with the club's hierarchy to push for changes, primarily for matchgoers. The latest forum took place on Tuesday, with chief executive Richard Arnold, football director John Murtough and chief operating officer Collette Roche among those present, with minutes released on the official website.\nOn-pitch matters, ticket prices, stadium renovations, shareholder dividends, and police action involving players have all been topics discussed at FAB meetings and fans forums, but The 1958 insist meaningful action will only come with a complete boycott. A pitch invasion at Old Trafford which caused the postponement of the Premier League game against Liverpool in May 2021 triggered the creation of the FAB.\nThe 58 said: ‘Joel’s (Glazer) initial response to the Liverpool protest was to engage in dialogue, merely to appease and pacify our support. By maintaining a dialogue with the Glazers, we have validated their actions and legitimatised their ownership of our club.\n‘It is now time to reevaluate this approach and consider alternative methods to ensure that the Glazers ownership of our Club finally becomes untenable.\n‘Dialogue with the club and owners does not work. We ask that all members of the fans’ forum boycott their position with immediate effect. It will send a powerful message to the Glazers, the clubs sponsors and the media.’\nBut a statement in response from the FAB, the fans' forum, Manchester United Women Supporters Club (MUWSC), The Rainbow Devils (Manchester United LGBT+ Supporters Club), MUST — the independent Manchester United Supporters’ Trust, Manchester United Disabled Supporters' Association (MUDSA), read: \"We welcome and echo the call for unity. We all believe we need better ownership and investment for our club. We all believe that fans have the right to lawfully protest. We all believe that fans have the right to be represented. We all want what’s best both for our club and for all of our fans\n\"Many support protest, many support dialogue and many support both — they are complementary. For the greater good of our club, let’s work towards our shared goals, set aside what divides us, and respect that different people, working towards the same goal, will have different strategies to get there\n\"This statement is supported by the following fan representative bodies and independent supporters groups who represent Manchester United fans’ views to the club.\"\nThe statement from these groups was compiled before news broke of Sir Jim Ratcliffe closing in on a 25 per cent stake in United. Ratcliffe's potential arrival, which will go to a board vote in the coming days, would not end the Glazers' association, but should grant the 70-year-old influence of sporting decisions.\nSheikh Jassim pulled out of the running after more talks around a full takeover were unsuccessful.\nRangers appoint Clement as new manager\nRangers have confirmed the appointment of Philippe Clement as their new manager.\nThe 49-year-old arrives at Ibrox following the departure of Michael Beale at the start of the month.\nAfter playing at Genk and Club Brugge, Clement has won the Belgian Pro League as a manager with both teams and had Champions League experience with Brugge.\nClement was sacked by Monaco in June after 18 months in charge when his side finished sixth in Ligue 1.\nRangers chairman John Bennett said the Belgian was \"the outstanding candidate across all the key criteria\".\nClement said: \"I am honoured to have been appointed as the new manager of Rangers Football Club and I’d like to thank the board for giving me this opportunity.\n\"I am hugely excited by this chance to achieve success at one of Europe’s most iconic clubs across four competitions in what remains of this season and beyond.\"\nDe la Fuente's case for defence despite Haaland form\nErling Haaland has unsurprisingly been a central figure in the build-up to Spain's trip to Norway.\nNorway beat Cyprus 4-0 in Larnaca on Thursday with the Manchester City star scoring a double to make it 27 goals in 27 appearances for his national team.\nBut Spain boss Luis de la Fuente has been praising his defence as they prepare to come up against the Norwegian goal machine.\nHe told Marca: \"We will look for the best version of all, with concentration to try to stop the attacks of Norway.\n\"We know the importance of Haaland, but he is not the only one. There is no Haaland plan. Haaland is a dynamic attacking specialist, but I'm delighted with the work of my centre-backs.\n\"We will try to counteract those characteristics, not only Haaland, and we will try to minimise the talent of these players. In defence, against Scotland and Norway, we have dominated the situation.\"\nThe only blip in the qualifying campaign for Spain, this summer's Nations League winners, was the 2-0 defeat at Hampden Park in March and they will qualify for Germany with a win in Oslo.\nBut Norway have no margin for error in their quest to reach Euro 2024 and coach Stale Solbakken knows the difficulty of the task they face.\nHe said: \"Yes, the situation of the group for us is a disappointment. Why? It's as simple as the fact that our situation is extremely difficult to be in the European Championship.\"\n\"Spain is always one of the best; always with the ball and in aggressiveness when they don't have it.\"\nSunday's Euro qualifiers - what's coming up\nThe Euro 2024 qualification campaign continues on Sunday — here's what's in store:\nGroup A\nSpain visit Erling Haaland's Norway seeking a win that will clinch qualification for the three-time European champions. A victory in Oslo will put Spain into the finals of Euro 2024 with two games remaining.\nNorway have to beat Spain to keep alive their chances of finishing in the top two. Scotland are not in action but the surprise group leaders will qualify if Norway fail to beat Spain. Spain beat Norway 3-0 at home in March, when the visitors were missing Haaland because of injury.\nElsewhere in the group, Georgia host Cyprus.\nGroup D\nGroup leaders Turkey host Latvia and could qualify for next year's tournament in Germany if results go their way Sunday. Turkey will advance if they beats Latvia and Wales fail to defeat Croatia. A draw for Turkey and a Welsh defeat will also see the Turks qualify.\nGroup E\nFirst-place Albania are not in action but can secure qualification if Poland and Moldova draw, and if the Czech Republic fail to beat the Faroe Islands at home.\nGroup I\nIsrael's scheduled game against Kosovo was postponed, leaving group leaders Switzerland versus fifth-place Belarus and second-place Romania facing bottom team Andorra. No team can advance on Sunday.\nItaly keep pressure on - what else happened on Saturday?\nItaly put a scandal-ridden week behind them to beat Malta 4-0 in their European Championship qualifier on Saturday to move within three points of Group C leaders England, whom they play on Tuesday at Wembley.\nElsewhere, Hungary put themselves in the driving seat to qualify from Group G after they defeated Serbia 2-1 at home.\nLithuania registered their first win of the qualifiers at the sixth attempt thanks to defender Pijus Sirvys' double either side of half-time to beat 10-man Bulgaria 2-0.\nIn Group H, Northern Ireland wrapped up a 3-0 victory over lowly San Marino.\nBut Slovenia strengthened their grip on qualifying following a 3-0 rout over Finland.\nDenmark stayed level on points with Slovenia to occupy the top two spots after they earned a 3-1 win over Kazakhstan.\nMan Utd latest - essential reading\nAs the Manchester United board prepares for a crucial vote, get the lowdown on British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe with some our our deep dives:\nUSMNT beaten by Germany\nThe U.S. men’s national team fell 3-1 to Germany in a friendly Saturday after a promising first half. Here’s what you need to know:\nUSMNT captain Christian Pulisic opened the scoring in the 27th minute with a blistering shot from outside the box into the upper right corner. But after İlkay Gündoğan tied it up in the 39th minute, Germany dominated the second half and scored in the 58th (by Niclas Füllkrug) and 61st minutes (Jamal Musiala).\nGio Reyna started for the U.S. in his return to the squad after suffering a leg fracture in the CONCACAF Nations League final in June — it also marked his first match under coach Gregg Berhalter since their relationship came under the microscope after the 2022 World Cup.\nMore analysis below\nItaly cruise to qualifying win ahead of England trip\nDomenico Berardi scored twice as Italy cruised to a 4-0 win over Malta in their Euro 2024 Group C qualifier on Saturday.\nGiacomo Bonaventura opened the scoring after 23 minutes, before Berardi curled in just before half-time and then netted his second of the game in the 64th minute.\nIn the closing moments, Davide Frattesi scored the final goal of the night, slotting a low shot from the edge of the area into the bottom corner.\nItaly now sit second in the standings, ahead on goal difference of Ukraine, who earlier won 2-0 against North Macedonia. Both teams have 10 points but Italy have a match in hand.\nEngland, who top the group with 13 points, host Italy in their next qualifier on Tuesday.\nWhat will Man Utd fans think?\nThe Glazer family’s ownership has faced opposition from United supporters from its very inception due to the nature of their leveraged buy-out in 2005, which borrowed money against the club to make their takeover possible.\nUnited have remained in debt ever since — their current gross debt stands at £725million — while a similar figure has been paid out in interest to service the debt over the same period. The Glazers have also paid approximately £165million in dividends during their tenure, mostly to themselves.\nAnti-Glazer protests have been a regular occurrence at Old Trafford over the years, particularly since the announcement of the club’s potential sale last November.\nDespite concerns about Qatar’s human rights record and accusations of sportswashing, many fans preferred Sheikh Jassim’s bid for 100 per cent ownership as it was the only offer that would bring the Glazers’ 18-year stewardsip to an end.\nRatcliffe’s minority deal will keep the Glazers in position, at least initially, and is likely to face a backlash from some supporters as a result. Others may be placated by the prospect of full INEOS takeover further down the line.",
