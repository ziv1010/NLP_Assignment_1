how you have to look, how you have to act.\n\"I know a lot of young girls struggle with that.\"\nZara and team-mate Millie, also 16, play for North Bristol Rugby Club.\nThey both had to move to Bristol when they turned 12 in order to continute playing due to the lack of more local girls' teams.\n\"I've been playing rugby since I was about six and I used to play with the boys up until I was U12s which is the age limit that you're not allowed to play with them anymore,\" says Zara.\nAn athletic physique is \"always seen as a masculine thing\", adds Millie.\n\"[Ilona's] a role model for me because I'm quite tall and she's also tall and she just shows the beauty in that and she's not ashamed of it.\"\nFor rugby union journalist and author Jessica Hayden, Ilona's message of body positivity is breaking down a significant barrier in the women's game.\n\"Half of the issue is that they don't have the opportunity and that clubs don't have women's or girls offerings for them,\" she tells Newsbeat.\n\"The other half of the issue is that, when they get to that age, there's problems around body positivity.\"\nAnd while there have been campaigns in the past to promote body confidence, what makes Ilona cut through is her authenticity, Jessica says.\n\"Personalities are the most important thing in sport because people want to understand who this athlete is,\" she says.\n\"What I really liked was seeing young girls talking to her [after her debut] about what Ilona's done for them in terms of how they view their own bodies.\n\"And I'm sure those conversations are happening up and down the country about what she's doing for the sport.\"\nTeam-mates Millie and Zara say they're excited to see the boost they think Ilona's already bringing to the women's game.\nA record-breaking crowd of 9,240 turned out to watch Ilona's Premiership Women's Rugby debut as the Bristol Bears took on rivals Gloucester-Hartpury.\nThe figure is more than double the Bears' previous record attendance of 4,101- not to mention a new Premiership Women's Rugby record for a standalone game.\n\"She's had a massive effect,\" says Zara.\n\"They might not play rugby, they might not ever have watched a rugby match, but because they follow her on Instagram and TikTok, they want to come and watch her.\"\nJessica was also in the crowd and says she's \"never seen anything like it\".\n\"If you have all those fans who turned up to see Ilona Maher, they might become Bristol Bears fans and then come back the next week and the week after that,\" she says.\n'Our Lionesses moment'\nIlona's signed to Bristol on a three month deal and Millie says it's \"a really good opportunity to create more of a platform for women's rugby\".\nJessica is optimistic that will happen, particularly with the Women's Rugby World Cup being hosted in England this year and plans to boost female participation in the sport.\n\"We could be having our Lionesses moment,\" Jessica says, referring to the success of England's women's football team.\n\"The attention [Ilona]'s drawing it right now can only be a good thing for the wider game.\n\"Now is the time to invest in women's rugby - it's only going to get bigger.\"\nAfter coming on for 20 minutes, the Bristol Bears eventually lost to rivals Gloucester-Hartpury 17-40 and Ilona told Newsbeat she's \"ready for more\".\n\"I feel happy, but hungry's the word - I'm ready to do more.\"\nRelated topics\n- Published5 January 2025\n- Published6 December 2024\n- Published3 December 2024",
