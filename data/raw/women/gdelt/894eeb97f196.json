  "body_text": "Men locked up in Wales in 2024 for attacking women as 'national emergency' declared\nConcerns have been raised about violence against women and girls with at least one in 12 women in Wales and England being a victim every year\nPolice have warned this week that violence against women and girls is 'a national emergency' with at least one in 12 women in England and Wales being a victim every year. The deepening 'epidemic of violence' towards women and girls is evident in the number of men who have been locked up for attacks on women in the first six months of 2024.\nUK figures issued this week show that there were an average of a shocking 3,000 recorded violent crimes against women and girls every day between April, 2022, and March, 2023, and these were only the ones where victims had gone to the police. Many more crimes may have gone unreported.\nThe serious court cases we have covered show that, on average, around seven men a month have been jailed for attacks on partners and ex-partners - a total of 40 in the first six months of this year. A further 16 men have been jailed during the same period for serious attacks on women they did not know. They include the case of a woman who was brutally murdered by her partner who then left her body lying on the toilet floor while he went shopping and visited his parents. Another man repeatedly attacked his wife with a hammer before dousing her in petrol and setting their car alight.

Another subjected his partner to such a brutal beating her friends didn't recognise her bloodied and swollen face. Another poured petrol on his partner and threatened to kill her after beating her up and strangling her.\nYasmin Khan, government advisor to the Welsh government for violence against women and girls, told BBC Radio Wales: \"The statistics are really concerning. Violence against women and girls is an epidemic, and we know that not all crimes are reported. It is more prevalent than you could imagine. That is the worrying thing and we really need to be concerted in our efforts to tackle violence against women and girls.\"\nShe added: \"For all the victims who go to the police there are just as many go to the specialist sector like health and education. They tell us they are working at a crisis level that they have never seen the scale of violence that is now being presented to them. Organisations are bursting at the scenes in terms of supporting victims. The scale of the abuse is escalating and there needs to be a concerted effort.\" Ms Khan also pointed out that there was a \"very clear national commitment\" to address the issues with strategies in place.\nA wide-ranging report by the NPCC and College of Policing published this week said violence against women and girls had reached \"epidemic\" levels. It identified several key threats facing victims including sexual violence, domestic abuse, stalking and child sexual abuse.\nIt found there had been a 37% increase in the number of violent crimes against women and girls between 2018 and 2023. Police said more than a million such crimes were recorded in England and Wales last year alone, accounting for 20% of all crimes recorded by the police.\nSome of the rise has been driven by an increase in reporting and more awareness of those crimes. But police chiefs said domestic abuse was growing and remained one of the biggest demands on officers. And it's estimated that one in 20 adults - or 2.3 million people - are perpetrators of such violence every year. The NPCC said it had created a central hub which would offer police forces help by providing specialist knowledge and training.\nHere are the men who have been locked up in Wales in the first six months of this year for violent crimes against women:\nMathew Pickering\nHe brutally murdered his vulnerable partner and left her body lying on the toilet floor while he went shopping and visited his parents and will now spend at least 17 and a half years behind bars. Pickering beat and strangled Georgina Dowey to death at his home in Neath before putting a black plastic bag over her bloody and bruised face, and then set about covering his tracks by sending a text to the dead woman's phone to make it look like she left the property to go home.\nDavid Clarke\nHe received a life sentence after repeatedly attacking his wife with a hammer before dousing her in petrol and setting their car alight. Helen Clarke, 77, died of her injuries after being rushed to hospital with serious burns following her husband Clarke's \"brutal and merciless\" actions.\nClarke, 80, of Higher Lane, Langland, Swansea, pleaded guilty to murdering his wife of more than 50 years when he previously appeared at Swansea Crown Court in December. During his sentencing the court heard how Clarke sent his son David a message which read \"I love you\" on the morning of September 22 before the defendant and Mrs Clarke were captured on CCTV leaving their home in Langland, Swansea.\nDaniel Popescu\nHe tried to murder the mother of his unborn child and will serve up to 17 years and four months in jail. Popescu armed himself with a large knife and stabbed the woman at least five times before a passer-by's screams caused him to flee.\nArmed police attended the scene at Coronation Place in Aberfan, near Merthyr Tydfil, following the stabbing at around 9.10am on December 5 last year. Nearby schools and community centres were locked down for hours as police launched a manhunt, which resulted in the arrest of Popescu, a 29-year-old of no fixed address. He pleaded guilty to attempted murder and stalking.\nREAD MORE: Junior football volunteer's double life as major drug dealer\nREAD MORE: This man was banned from a Welsh town to protect women, but he went back\nMichael Stannard\nHe throttled his new partner, trashed her flat and broke her phone in what a judge labelled \"outrageous\" behaviour. Stannard's victim had to flee the situation after he squeezed the woman's throat with such force she struggled to breathe.\nSending the father-of-three to prison, a judge at Swansea Crown Court told him he had behaved in an \"outrageous way\" towards the woman. And he said the courts always regarded the act of strangulation as serious because of the inherent dangers in one person taking another by the throat.\nAndrew Beckett\nWhen Alana Rossiter first met her now ex-boyfriend Andrew Beckett in early 2021 she said he seemed too good to be true. He offered her the world, spoiled her with gifts, and took her on exciting trips away.\nHowever, it didn't take long for Beckett to show his true colours, proving Ms Rossiter's initial gut feeling right. The 35-year-old from Aberdare became paranoid, jealous, and controlling. Read how long he was sentenced to here.\nTravis Roberts\nHe slapped, punched and abused a former partner then used her phone to transfer £300 of her money into his account. Before he attacked the woman Travis Roberts bragged to her about the amount of cocaine he had taken.\nRoberts' barrister told Merthyr Crown Court that the defendant was \"deeply ashamed\" of his behaviour and said he realised he needed help with his alcohol and drug issues. Sending the defendant down, a judge said there was no realistic prospect of rehabilitation and said the offending was so serious only a sentence of immediate custody was appropriate.\nLouis Henry\nHe controlled and manipulated a woman he met on a dating website and assaulted her by cutting a chunk of her hair off with dog clippers. Henry spent months monitoring the woman's social media use, continually checked her whereabouts, and persuaded her to hand over tens of thousands of pounds.\nSwansea Crown Court heard a statement from the victim in which she said being with the defendant had been an \"horrendous\" experience which had left her isolated from family and friends. She said in total she had given the defendant £35,000.\nTyler Sangha\nHe beat his partner with bits of a broken bed then casually went on his phone as if nothing had happened. Sangha leapt out of a window when police arrived at the property but was arrested later that day following a major police search involving sniffer dogs and a helicopter after he got into a violent dispute with drug dealers.\nSwansea Crown Court heard Sangha had a long history of assaulting partners including attacking two while they were pregnant. His advocate told the court the defendant realised there was a lot of work to do in addressing the issues that led to his offending. Sending the 29-year-old to prison a judge said \"only time will tell\" whether Sangha does change his ways.\nAshley Bryan\nHe was described as being \"like a Rottweiler\" as he viciously attacked a former partner who intervened to help save his life. Bryan suffered a drug-induced seizure and his ex put him in the recovery position to stop him from choking - he responded by punching the woman then dragging her outside by her hair before kicking and throttling her.\nBryan's barrister told Swansea Crown Court his client had begun using cannabis at the age of 13 and heroin at the age of 15 and then, after a decade addicted to that drug, moved on to cocaine. He said his client could not recall the assault due to his \"drug-addled state\".\nREAD MORE: Grandmother mauled by XL Bully as she sat down with cup of tea\nNeil Seer\nHe beat and strangled a woman with whom he had formed a relationship while in prison. Seer was serving a lengthy sentence for his role in a major heroin-trafficking conspiracy when he began communicating with a woman on the outside.\nCardiff Crown Court heard that a matter of days after being released on licence from his drug-dealing sentence the defendant and the woman went on a caravan holiday and during the trip they argued and the defendant threw the woman about before grabbing her by the neck causing her to fear for her life. Jailing father-of-three Seer the judge told him strangulation was always taken seriously because taking someone by the throat could easily result in damage to the internal structures of the neck or even cause death. Read his sentencing here.\nAndrew Walker\nThe serial domestic abuser punched his homeless girlfriend in the head during an argument about him cheating on her. At the time of the assault he was subject to a suspended sentence after stamping on her and strangling her.\nWalker, 45, of Pontlottyn, Caerphilly, had a history of violence within his two-year relationship with the victim. She was homeless and vulnerable, which caused her to return to the defendant's home after he had been violent towards her.\nIan Smith\nHe strangled his ex-partner on New Year's Day after she tried to leave his house. Smith damaged the woman's voice box during the prolonged assault, leaving her voice \"hoarse\".\nSwansea Crown Court heard the 46-year-old realised he has to address his issue with alcohol – he had downed 15 pints the night before the attack – and his attitude towards former partners, whether that involved jealousy, insecurity, or \"other issues\" yet to be explored. The defendant has been jailed for 16 months for the attack.\nJamie Thomas\nThe jealous man subjected his partner to a \"prolonged and persistent assault' in which he dragged her by her hair and broke her ribs. Thomas pleaded guilty to several attacks on his girlfriend throughout their relationship.\nSending the 30-year-old to jail at a sentencing hearing at Cardiff Crown Court a judge said the evidence presented \"abuse to an appalling extent\" against his partner. The court heard Thomas, from Snowden Road in Ely, Cardiff, also had a history of violence against partners. In a powerful victim statement read to the court the victim said the abusive relationship drove her to self-harm.\nJamie Huxtable\nHe subjected his partner to a brutal and sustained beating after she turned down his request for birthday sex. Jamie Huxtable's victim suffered a seizure following the assault and spent time in a hospital intensive care unit.\nSending Huxtable down for seven years a judge told him he treated the woman like a \"rag doll\" and had then had the gall to claim she was the aggressor and he was the victim. In a statement to the court the woman said she relived what happened to her \"almost every day\".\nConnor Jay McLachlan\nThe 28-year-old, from Port Talbot, crushed his victim's self-esteem so much that she was convinced he would be acquitted of all charges against him. Instead, he was found guilty at Swansea Crown Court of 11 charges ranging from damaging her property to rape. Read the case here.\nJonathon Stapleton\nThe former serviceman knocked his partner to the floor and put his foot on her throat while scrolling through her phone to check who she had been talking to. Stapleton later forced the woman to change her bloodied top and appear at a window to tell police she was okay – but officers realised something was wrong and called for armed backup.\nAlfie Field\nA woman who was stabbed by her partner initially told hospital staff that her serious injury was an accident. She arrived with a deep cut on her leg claiming it was caused by a falling knife.\nBut the hospital staff were suspicious because the wound was severe and she seemed nervous when explaining what happened. Her story didn't match the seriousness of her injury so staff alerted the police. After several attempts to talk to her alone the police decided to arrest her partner, Alfie Jack Field. Read his sentencing here.\nLee Fleming\nThe thug attacked his ex-partner by grabbing her by the throat and stamping on her after he broke into her house and sat on her bed as she slept. He also trashed her house and was later found in possession of a Stanley knife when he was arrested by police.\nFleming, 33, was made subject to a restraining order preventing him from contacting his ex-partner in March last year. But he went on to breach that order after turning up at her home while under the influence of alcohol and cocaine.\nSteven Kaged\nHe subjected his partner to such a brutal beating her friends didn't recognise her bloodied and swollen face.

There were multiple incidents where he strangled the victim or pushed her to the floor causing various cuts, bruises, and swelling.\nChristopher Davies\nHe bombarded his ex-partner with hundreds of unwanted emails and calls in breach of a restraining order. Christopher Davies was also caught multiple times on his former girlfriend's video doorbell outside her property in the early hours of the morning.\nA judge told the 40-year-old his behaviour had resulted in a significant impact on the victim and she said it seemed he had not learned his lesson after being jailed for previous breaches of the same restraining order. The judge acknowledged the defendant would \"lose a lot\" with another term of imprisonment.\nKeiron Thomas\nHe punched and kicked his long-term partner, locked her and their two children inside their home, and then threatened to come back and kill her before driving away. The 28-year-old became paranoid his partner of around eight years was being unfaithful and assaulted her while the two children were in the property before forcing them to escape through a window.\nThomas, of Ffynnon Wen, Clydach, Swansea, confronted his partner about a message on her phone on the evening of December 2 last year. He then apologised for his behaviour but at around 2am the following morning she awoke to find Thomas again questioning her about being unfaithful. He then proceeded to grab her by the hair and threatened to kill her if she was unfaithful before punching her to the right side of her body, causing her to scream, and hitting her across the face.\nRobert Pinnington\nHe bit his wife's lip while she was sleeping and then tried to choke her. Pinnington was locked up for three years and made the subject of a 15-year restraining order.\nPinnington, of Gwynfryn, Y Fron, Caernarfon, admitted assault causing actual bodily harm, intentional strangulation, and threats to kill.

She eventually managed to flee after shouting to her daughter for help.\nDaniel Adams\nThe thug poured petrol on his partner and threatened to kill her after beating her up and strangling her. He had previously damaged a number of items in the victim's home including a microwave, washing machine, and an iPhone.\nAdams, 27, of Cwmbran, had been in a relationship with the victim for six years and they have a young child together. On January 28 police received a call at 12.03pm from a stressed-sounding woman who could be heard saying: \"Leave me alone Dan\" before the call came to an end.\nGeoffrey Pennington\nThe 74-year-old man who called his wife a \"cripple\" and threatened to bite her ear off has been jailed. Pennington \"tormented\" Amanda Jane Lloyd over three years, in what prosecutor David Mainstone claimed was a \"disability hate crime\".\nMold Crown Court heard that Ms Lloyd, 65, secretly recorded Pennington attacking her and went to the police.

Sending Hill back to jail a judge said it seemed the vulnerable woman was to some extent under the defendant's spell and said courts sometimes had to act to protect people from themselves.\nJamie Hughes\nThe thug assaulted his girlfriend's father's partner in an unprovoked attack when he punched her in the face. The victim felt instant pain and had blood coming out of her mouth.\nHughes, 30, first met the victim on April 3 this year at her then partner's daughter's birthday party in Barry. The relationship between the defendant and his girlfriend was \"strained\" due to his use of drugs.

He also told her she would be \"dead\" if she did not leave their house.\nThornton, 56, of Aberdare, harassed the victim between August 2 and September 30 last year made up of seven incidents during that period.

The incident was part of a \"frenzied\" assault Rhys Parry-Watts carried out on the woman which also saw him punching, biting, and suffocating her.\nSwansea Crown Court heard the assault came to an end when a neighbour of the victim intervened and drove the woman to safety. A judge sent Parry-Watts to prison for 20 months and commended the neighbour for his bravery and public-spiritedness.\nKhuram Hussain\nHe strangled his girlfriend under a table in a Cardiff pub before punching her in the face after she threw a drink at him.

Reynolds was subject to a restraining order at the time of the incident which banned him from contacting the woman.\nSwansea Crown Court heard Reynolds also had another restraining order in place in regard to a different ex-partner and his barrister said the 30-year-old realised he had issues around \"trust and paranoia\" that he needed to address. Elin Morgan, prosecuting, said Reynolds was made the subject of a restraining order in respect of his former partner in December last year with the order to last for two years.\nAlexander Miles\nHe armed himself with knuckledusters and threated to kill his pregnant former partner and her parents during a terrifying ordeal in the victims' own home. Miles also made sick dark web rape threats.\nThe 30-year-old's barrister said the defendant was struggling with his mental health and with coming to terms with changes in \"family dynamics\", and he invited the court to impose a sentence that was \"more rehabilitative\" in nature. Sending Miles to prison for 21 months a judge at Swansea Crown Court said the victims must have been left \"fearing for their lives\" during the prolonged incident.\nRhys Phillips\nThe narcissistic stalker spent months harassing a former partner after their relationship ended. Phillips bombarded his victim with unwanted emails, texts and voicemails, sent songs he had written for her, and told her he had put a \"voodoo spell\" on her to make her love him.\nSwansea Crown Court heard the emotional abuse Phillips subjected the woman to had resulted in a devastating impact on her life and on her mental health. Sending the defendant to prison a judge said Phillips had engaged in gaslighting and victim-blaming, and said he had no doubt he posed a risk to women who he formed intimate relationships with.\nCee-jai Sharpe\nHe subjected a former girlfriend to a series of lurid and violent threats over the phone after their six-week relationship ended. During one of the menacing calls Sharpe played the sound of a child's crying doll down the phone then laughed at his victim.\nThe 24-year-old's advocate told Swansea Crown Court that the defendant was remorseful for his actions towards the woman, and acknowledged he had a problem with drink and drugs. The court heard the probation service was not able to recommend any alternative to immediate custody and had concluded that the defendant would need to be subject to stringent licence conditions upon his release from prison in order to properly manage him in the community.\nPhillip Thompson\nThe prolific burglar mocked his girlfriend for being scared of him, sent her a message saying “I’m going to f****** stab you” and strangled her in a hotel room until she passed out, a court heard. Thompson, 35, had known his victim for around 20 years by the time they started a relationship.\nIn September, 2022, his partner was due to travel to Manchester with her brother for the day, something which Thompson, of Pine Court, Tongwynlais, Cardiff, was not in favour of. He told her what would happen to her if she did travel to Manchester and even threatened to “smash her house up”.

Bk at first denied being in the property at all but later claimed the allegation was some kind of fantasy on the part of the victim.\nSending the 27-year-old defendant to prison, a judge said he was aware there were people who knew Bk and who did not believe the incident had taken place - he said those people were \"either totally blinkered or incredibly gullible\". The victim of the sexual assault has life-long legal anonymity. Read his sentencing here.\nJohn Harding\nThe sadistic thug viciously raped one woman in a horrific attack and tied up another woman with tape before threatening to kill her. He left one of his victims unconscious after he stamped on her head and neck.\nThe 30-year-old, of Newport, committed brutal attacks upon his two victims which left them fearing for their lives. The defendant has a long history of violence committed against women.\nA sentencing hearing at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard the first victim was attacked by Harding who threw her to the ground and stood on her head, which caused her to scream in pain.

Once she did so he unzipped her hoodie and groped her breast over clothing. Read his sentencing here.\nMatthew Edwards\nHe sneaked into a woman's house in the dead of night and raped her in her bed. The victim said her attacker seemed to \"believe he was entitled to my body\" and she said her home now feels like a \"crime scene\".\nIan Wright, prosecuting, told Swansea Crown Court the rape occurred in June last year after the victim had gone to bed at around 11pm. After listening to the radio for a while the woman fell asleep only to wake some time later to find Edwards in her room. The court heard the woman, who is in her 60s, \"froze in terror\" as the intruder got into bed beside her. The 42-year-old defendant then raped the woman, telling her: \"I am going to shoot my load\".\nAndras Jancso\nHe posed as a taxi driver in order to kidnap a lone woman and sexually assault her. Jancso lured his victim into his car in the early hours of the morning and drove her to an isolated car park before telling her he would not release her until she agreed to sex.\nSwansea Crown Court heard the attack had had a profound effect on the young victim leaving her feeling \"numb\" and wishing for her old life back. She said when she realised the driver was not taking her home but was stopping in an empty car park she believed he was going to rape and kill her.\nAdrian Russell Coxon\nHe sexually assaulted a woman leaving his victim feeling at \"rock bottom\" and wanting to kill herself.

Former PC May, also known as Aron May, who grew up in Carmarthenshire before joining West Midlands Police, was a serving officer when he carried out the attacks on the \"terrified\" victim.\nKalvin Davies\nHe was given an extended sentence as a dangerous offender after beating up and raping a woman. A judge said it may be that Kalvin Davies \"gets a sexual thrill from emotionally and physically subjugating women\".\nDavies repeatedly punched the woman in the face and strangled her at his home in Swansea in the summer of 2023 before carrying out the sex attack. He then stopped her leaving the property and she was only able to escape when he fell asleep.\nDean Jones\nHe videoed himself sexually assaulting a woman. Jones then told his victim that nobody else would want her after what he had done.\nSwansea Crown Court heard the 34-year-old defendant's victim had been left suffering with anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

He was talking gibberish and shouted 'you robbed her' a few times.\nMark Dursley\nHe beat and strangled a woman at a hotel after asking to borrow her mobile phone and then following her to her room. Dursley said he needed the mobile's torch to look for his missing bag of cannabis before launching the unprovoked attack which left his victim bleeding and unconscious on the floor.\nSwansea Crown Court heard Dursley had a history of violent offending including wounding with intent, and a judge told him that if he continued to use violence there would come a time when a court might have no alternative but to find he was a dangerous offender who needed to be subject to an extended sentence to protect the public.",
