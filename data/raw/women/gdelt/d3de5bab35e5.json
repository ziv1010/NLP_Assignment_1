But they're not stopping there, according to coach Lachlan Raymond.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nThe Flame - who compete in the FNSW League One U20 Women's competition - qualified for the decider by upsetting league champions Hills United in a dramatic penalty shoot-out last Sunday, and will now face Mt Druitt in the grand final this Sunday at Landen Stadium in Blacktown.\nThe Raymond-coached side made history by winning last week and in doing so, became the Flame's first ever team to qualify for a decider in the seven-year history of the club.\nAs for the girls set to take to the field on Sunday, they are as confident as ever of bringing even more history to the Football South Coast club.\n\"There has been a real mix of giddiness, I'd say a little bit of excited-nervousness, but as we've progressed in our preparations their focus has definitely ramped up,\" Raymond said.\n\"We're pretty blessed that we have quite a diverse squad, and I think all of their different qualities are starting to come together. Overall they're a really calm group, so I think we're in a pretty good spot and I think we're progressing well towards the weekend.\"\nAt just 26, Raymond said he was immensely proud as a young coach to be part of the Flame's history, considering his long association with the club. He said as a coach, he was hungry to progress as high as he possibly could in future.\n\"I've been with the Flame going on seven years, pretty much since it started,\" he continued.\n\"I feel immense pride to be associated with this group of players that I've worked with for quite a number of years now. I just can't wait to sit back and watch them do their thing on the weekend. I came into the youth program when I first started with no real coaching experience before that.\n\"Since then, I've progressed through the coaching ranks and I've been afforded a lot of opportunities to go and do these things by the Flame.\n\"Now I'm at my A level license, which has been great for networking and making new strides in the game and trying to understand what it takes to be at an elite level. I'm still really hungry, and my ambitions are to go as high as we can, whether that looks like a first grade NPL2 level, or hopefully NPL1. Who knows what it looks like.\"\nThe Flame will take on Mt Druitt this Sunday at 1:30pm.",
