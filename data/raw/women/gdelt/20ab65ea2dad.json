Undergraduate enrollment was up by 3.2% in the spring of 2025, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. That increase is all the more noteworthy when you consider the current price tag for a college education—per the Education Data Initiative, the average cost of one year at a higher education institution clocks in at more than $38,000 in 2022-23. Still, college offers a valuable return on investment for many prospective students. An analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that in recent years, college grads earned a median of $80,000 per year, while workers with only a high school diploma earned a median of $47,000 per year.\nWith this in mind, the return on investment may be more apparent at some schools than others. Stacker compiled a list of the best colleges in America using Niche's 2026 rankings. All four-year schools in Niche's database were considered. Niche ranks colleges using various factors, including academics, admissions, finances, and student life. You can check out the full methodology here.\nThe list includes public and private institutions, from West Coast research colleges to East Coast liberal arts schools. It also contains a fair share of sprawling state schools and religion-centric universities.\nThese colleges offer pioneering sciences, entrepreneurship, and even bagpipe performance programs. While some may be best known for athletic achievements, many football schools are making rapid educational advancements, producing several Rhodes scholars and collaborating with tech industry giants. Of course, some have cool perks that few others do, including an on-campus ice cream factory or proximity to the beach.\nWhile the Ivy League is considered the cream of the crop for American colleges, that's not necessarily the case with this list.
