  "body_text": "BBC Match of The Day star Gary Lineker faces court showdown over £4.9m tax bill\nThe presenter announced his plans to quit Match of the Day at the end of this season\nGary Lineker could be set to face court over a £4.9million tax bill. It comes as the veteran presenter announced plans to quit hosting Match of The Day (MoTD) at the end of this season.\nHe first joined the popular BBC show back in 1999. The 63-year-old is now set to be quizzed about his earnings from when he worked for BBC and BT Sport from 2013 to 2018. He listed himself as a freelancer but the tax authorities considered him an employee.\nIn March 2023, the courts ruled in the former football ace's favour against HMRC. But three months later, HMRC appealed that decision and now a date has been set for the two parties to face each other at the Upper Tribunal on December 2 and 3.\nPOLL: Do you agree with the DWP taking money from bank accounts or wages?\nLineker argued that he had paid all his tax legitimately though his firm Gary Lineker Media Ltd - a similar argument used by ITV presenter Lorraine Kelly, who faced a £1.2M bill but a judge ruled she worked for herself and not ITV.\nGary is set to remain at the BBC until 2026 after both parties agreed in principle to him presenting coverage of the next World Cup, The Mirror reports. He will also host coverage of the FA Cup in the 2025-26 season and continue with the MoTD Top Ten podcast and The Rest is Football podcast, featuring Lineker, on BBC Sounds.\nHe said said: \"I'm delighted to continue my long association with BBC Sport and would like to thank all those who made this happen.\" Alex Kay-Jelski, director of BBC Sport, described Lineker as a \"worldclass presenter\", who will be \"hugely missed\" on Match of the Day. The bookies' favourites to replace the former England goal-machine include Mark Chapman, the regular Match Of The Day 2 presenter.\n\"Chappers\" is also a key part of the BBC's coverage of football on radio, presenting Sports Report and the Monday Night Club on 5 Live. He also fronts Global podcast The Sports Agents with Gabby Logan, another candidate to succeed Lineker.\nFormer gymnast Gabby has presented MoTD in his absence and fronted coverage of England women's Euros 2023. Ex-Lioness Alex Scott is also firmly in the mix having presented The One Show and worked alongside Lineker on the BBC Sports Personality Of The Year programme.\nA spokesperson for the BBC said: \"Plans for Match of the Day will be announced in due course.\"",
