  "body_text": "UPPER LAKE — Adriana Lopez and Junior Fernandez aren’t the first siblings to win the Lake County Record-Bee Athlete of the Year award, but the two seniors are the first to win it during the same sports season.\nBreaking new ground is something Upper Lake High School’s dynamic wrestling duo excelled at in 2018-19 and they can add this honor to a long list of firsts. While Lopez was claiming the girls state championship at 121 pounds to become the first Lake County athlete to win a first-place state medal in a CIF-sanctioned sport, brother Junior earned a fifth-place medal at the boys state championships, the highest finish ever by a Upper Lake wrestler and the third-best ever by a county boy.\nBoth Lopez, 18, and Fernandez, 17, experienced many thrills and even a couple of spills during the recently completed high school season. The two-sport athletes — Lopez in volleyball and wrestling and Fernandez in football and wrestling — graduated from Upper Lake on May 31 and are about to embark on the next stage of their student/athlete careers. Fernandez is already involved in Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo’s summer wrestling program and he’ll compete for the Mustangs, a Division I program, for at least the next four years – five if he red-shirts his freshman year. Lopez is headed to Campbellsville University in Kentucky, one of the top women’s wrestling programs in NAIA. Whether or not she cracks the Tigers’ starting lineup this year remains to be seen, but you probably don’t want to bet against her.\nThe good news for the Northshore community where they grew up is that both of these Upper Lake graduates and sports stars, the children of Joe and Jamie Fernandez of Upper Lake, are determined to return to the Upper Lake area and give back to the people who supported them throughout their long journey to the state medal podium.\nLopez will pursue a degree in nursing while Fernandez plans to major in ag business. His goal is to return to Upper Lake and take over his father’s business, Jim’s Pumps, which services and installs water pumps in wells for residential, agricultural and commercial customers, and to start his own cattle ranch. He already has a small herd — three heifers, three cows, a bull and two calves.\nBoth are members of FFA. Junior raises steers and pigs while Adriana raises pigs and lambs. When not playing sports or tending to their animals, which requires a ton of time and hard work, they’re also solid students in the classroom — Adriana finished high school with a 4.1 GPA while Junior was at 3.7. They needed those grades, too, as the universities they will soon be attending don’t dole out scholarships to marginal students.\nCompeting for the first time outside of the community that nurtured their growth as athletes and human beings will be an adjustment for both.\nAsked what she would miss most about Upper Lake, Lopez didn’t hesitate. “Our family and our community has supported us all of our lives, especially our parents.”\nAdded Junior, “I got so used to Upper Lake, it’s one big family. Everything is different (at San Luis Obispo). There you’re just another person.”\nAdriana Lopez\nLopez not only repeated as North Coast Section champion this season, but she took it to the next level. After placing third in the state in 2018, she won all five of her state matches as the No. 3 seed in 2019, culminating with a 9-5 victory over No. 1 seed Ashley Venegas of Mount Whitney High School in the 121-pound finals.\nWhile posting a season record of 35-3, Lopez said it was her first loss that proved to be her most important match as it provided the wake-up call she needed to walk off the mat a fist-pumping state champion in Bakersfield.\n“There was a lot of pressure on me to win state,” Lopez said. “I was ranked No. 1 in the state going into my first tournament. I dominated the first few matches before I lost to Nyla (Gaines of Bear Creek High School). Losing that match made me win the state championship. I ran that match through my mind over and over. I wasn’t going to let that happen again.”\nGaines, an accomplished wrestler in her own right, went on to win a fourth-place state medal at 126 pounds.\nComing from a small town, Lopez said she felt a big responsibility to bring home a state title for all those people who had supported her and her family for many years.\n“It was better for me to lose then rather than later. It pushed me to be better.”\nWhen she was younger, Lopez said the thought of going to college, or even wrestling, wasn’t at the top of her list of things to do.\n“I didn’t see this coming,” she said.\nAnother Upper Lake High School great, two-time section winner and state medalist Christina Wilson, got her excited about the sport.\n“She gave me that little push I needed,” Lopez said.\nOnce bitten by the wrestling bug, there was simply no stopping Lopez. She improved every year, culminating in a state championship. Was she satisfied?\nNope.\nLopez said she wanted to follow that up by winning at Nationals, but had to settle for a fourth-place medal.\nHer biggest thrill during wrestling season wasn’t winning state, believe it or not. With the boys and girls state championships being held on the same weekend and at the same venue for the first time ever, Lopez said her most memorable moment was competing on the mat adjacent to where her brother was wrestling during his quarterfinals match.\n“He was in the third period (of his match) when I just started (my match),” Lopez said. “He won his match and I won mine. It was fun and my best memory of the season.”\nWith the possible exception of her early-season loss to Gaines, Lopez said there was really no true low point during her senior year at Upper Lake, where she also started in volleyball for the Cougars.\n“My teammates in volleyball were awesome, we had so much fun,” she said.\nWhile the trend among current athletes is to concentrate on a single sport in the hopes of securing that college scholarship, Lopez said she wouldn’t trade her experience in volleyball for anything.\n“It was fun,” she said. “There was so much pressure in wrestling, it was good to have fun (in volleyball) before wrestling started.”\nThat doesn’t mean Lopez wasn’t as serious about winning in volleyball as she was in wrestling.\n“I want to win in everything, I don’t like losing,” she said.\nWhile she doesn’t report to Campbellsville until Aug. 16, Lopez said there is plenty about Upper Lake she’ll miss, including her favorite food.\n“The Judy’s Junction Junction Jackpot,” she said. “It’s all breakfast stuff mixed together. It’s delicious.”\nThough making weight means she couldn’t splurge much on the calorie end of the strict diet of a competitive wrestler, Lopez celebrated when she could.\nWhile hard work and a rigorous training schedule served her well throughout her career, Lopez said she was blessed to make it through her senior year relatively injury free.\nAmong her many skills are welding — it was her favorite class in high school and she’s very good at it.\nJunior Fernandez\nHe overcame multiple injuries, including a pretty serious one at the end of his freshman year, and at least one naysayer to reach the Division I college ranks of Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo. Nothing could stop Junior Fernandez’s college dreams, not even nemesis and good friend Kyle Parco of De La Salle High School of Concord, who handed Fernandez three of his four losses during an otherwise incredible 24-4 senior season.\nAs for the naysayer?\n“I’ve wanted to go to Cal Poly since the sixth grade,” Fernandez said. “Somebody told me (years ago) I wasn’t smart enough.”\nFernandez said he had to scramble to reach a high enough GPA that would attract attention from San Luis Obispo, not because he isn’t smart but because he almost lost his wrestling dream after a tournament three years ago in Temecula where he sustained an injury while wrestling up three weight classes.\n“I got knocked off the mat, my head hit the floor, I was knocked out cold,” Fernandez said.\nFernandez continued on in the tournament only to get head-butted in his next match, which only aggravated the concussion he had sustained from the earlier match.\nWhile recovering from the injury, Fernandez said he couldn’t do much.\n“I couldn’t watch TV, I couldn’t read or write,” Fernandez said. “The only thing I could do was color and I colored a lot.”\nWorse yet, the doctors told him he wouldn’t wrestle again.\n“I was a 4.0 student my freshman year, but I dropped to 2.2 my sophomore year,” said Fernandez, who admitted he lost a serious amount of motivation because he didn’t think he would wrestle again or be able to enroll at Cal Poly.\nCleared to continue in his sport midway through his sophomore year, that motivation returned and so did the good grades.\n“I had to adapt and overcome,” Fernandez said.\nAfter placing second in the sections in 2018, Fernandez came within a win of reaching the medal round before being eliminated at the state championships. That only spurred him to work even harder in the offseason. He broke through in 2019 after posting another runner-up finish at the sectional tournament where he lost to Parco in the championship match. At the state finals that followed he won each of his of his first three matches to reach the semifinals opposite Parco. He dropped a 6-2 decision to the No. 1 seed, then lost a 1-0 heartbreaker in the consolation semifinals against Gianno Petrucelli of Clovis High School. Fernandez bounced back to defeat Marcus Polanco of Bishop Amat High School 4-2 in the fifth-place match.\nFernandez entered the state tournament seeded No. 5, which wasn’t the game plan at the beginning of the season. During the prestigious Doc Buchanan Tournament in early January at Clovis, he stunned state No. 1 seed Ryan Franco in the quarterfinals. Facing Parco in the semifinals, Fernandez sustained a concussion during a 10-5 loss and the injury sidelined him more than a month, hurting his overall state seeding.\n“If that (injury) doesn’t happen I probably go into the (state) tournament as the No. 2 seed and wrestle Parco in the finals instead of the semifinals,” Fernandez said. “That was the hardest thing about that injury.”\nFernandez said he tried to get back into action earlier but his dad and coach made sure he wouldn’t return until he was fully healed.\nThe Fernandez-Parco rivalry might not be done yet even though both are now moving on to the collegiate ranks. Parco is headed to Fresno State and there is a chance the two could meet at some point during their college careers.\nWhile Fernandez will certainly be remembered in years to come as Upper Lake’s most successful boys wrestler, he also distinguished himself during the 2018 football season, earning All-League North Central League III first-team honors as a running back for the Cougars.\n“I wasn’t going to play football,” Fernandez said. “I solid all of my stuff (after his junior year) but the coaches kept begging me.”\nWhat changed his mind?\nA nearly fatal auto collision involving a member of the football team, Kellen Smith, on Aug. 15, just before the start of the 2018 season, produced a change of heart.\n“He’s always treated me well,” Fernandez said of Kellen’s dad, Mike Smith, the Upper Lake High School athletic director and the former football head coach. “I’m glad I went out because I had the best season of my career.”\nIn one game against Round Valley, Fernandez rushed for 258 yards and four touchdowns.\nMuch like his sister Adriana in volleyball, Fernandez said playing another sport helped ease him into what turned out to be a grueling wrestling season. There was less pressure and more of an opportunity to have fun.\n“In football, everything happens at a slower pace. Wrestling it comes so fast,” Fernandez said.\nJust like his sister Adriana, Fernandez doesn’t get much of an opportunity to deviate from a strict diet during the season. On those rare occasions when he can splurge his food of choice is “anything from Taco Bell,” Fernandez said.\nHe agrees with his sister that the best moment of wrestling season was competing on adjacent mats at the state tournament. The worst? His injury at Doc Buchanan.\nBut it didn’t stop him. Nothing could, and that’s just a family trait.",
