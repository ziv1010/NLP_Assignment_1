  "body_text": "MAJOR SIGNING NEWS: prep 400 phenom Quincy Wilson surprised many by committing to Maryland…\nOlympic gold medalist Athing Mu-Nikolayeva has ended her coaching agreement with Bobby Kersee and is now training in Dallas, Texas. Kersee told LetsRun, “I’m sure they’ll seek out good coaching and once she’s healthy, then she’s going to be very difficult to beat. She’s that talented. I think it was a blessing for me to coach her, I enjoyed coaching her. I loved her attitude, I loved her support.

She said, “My goal for 2026 is to figure out and prioritize how to make running fun again.”…\nThe WJR of Chinese javelin thrower Ziyi Yan 212-8 (64.83) did not pass the ratification process because it came at an uncertified facility. Her later throw of 216-2 (65.89) was already ratified…\nGeorgia’s new track facility is set to officially open at a dedication ceremony on February 18.

The Nigerian sprinter faces 15 years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and possible deportation…\nA man drove his car into 8 high school runners in Anaheim, California, and has been charged with DUI. Fortunately, none of the runners had critical injuries…\nMohammed Bati, 2-time Div. III cross country champion, has been ruled ineligible by the NCAA for accepting around $6000 from his community to help him with school costs at Augsburg. International athletes are not eligible for NIL funds…\nThe AIU reports that its out-of-competition testing of competing athletes at Tokyo was up by 49% compared to London ’17. During the same 9-year period, out-of-competition tests by national anti-doping agencies rose 71%…\nWADA has announced its ’23 stats. Leading the league of nations in positive tests: India with 222.

Emily Venters of Utah, the 10K runner-up, petitioned the NCAA to be declared the winner but was denied, with the official win “vacated.” Posted Venters, “Today’s decision from the NCAA is beyond disappointing. It is heartbreaking and honestly infuriating… We later [after the ’23 meet] learned that the athlete… tested positive for a banned substance and had her results revoked… I will never get to experience being named a national champion, standing on the top step of the podium, hearing my name called. That moment was taken from me by someone who chose to cheat and now by a system that refuses to fix it.”…\nFormer marathon great Ingrid Kristiansen finally lost her Nordic marathon record to Alisa Vainio’s 2:20:48. For that she says she is happy, but she admits she is skeptical of the spate of ultra-fast women’s times. “I have faith until the result starts at, for example, 2:17. When we go to the results starting at 2:13–2:14, I am always very convinced that they involve blood doping.”…\nOlympic heptathlon champ Carolina Klüft returned to competition after a 13-year retirement, throwing the shot 36-5½ (11.11) at a small competition in Bollnäs, Sweden. Now 42, she said, “This was a family competition for the club that my children are in. It was just for fun and there were three standing shots. It was fun but I really have no desire to make a comeback.”…\nSifan Hassan has been world-class at everything from the 800 to the marathon. What’s next when she tires of marathons? “Then I’ll do an ultra run. A hundred kilometers or so, to see what it feels like, how far I can get. And not on the road, but on unpaved paths, up and down mountains. I really love that.”…\nFormer 400H World Record holder Kim Batten says that the recent improvements in the WR make it clear that the time has come to raise the barriers from 30 inches to 33. She is launching a “Raise the Hurdles” campaign which will be circulating a petition…\nMondo Mania? The announcement that AOY Mondo Duplantis would be competing at the London Diamond League in July led to an 1150% increase in ticket sales over the previous week…\nAxelina Johansson broke the Collegiate Record with her December 64-8½ (19.72) in Lincoln.

So literally, I just flew to Denver to pee,” said the Nebraska senior…\nPoland’s Chorzów is no longer assured of hosting the ’28 European Championships.

Recipient nations: Anguilla, Burundi, Cook Islands, Dominica, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Palestine, Panama, Tajikistan, Tanzania and Ukraine…\nWorld Indoor medalist Carl Bengtström of Sweden is against the World Indoor going to 2-sections for its 400 final: “I think everyone in the final should run in the same race. Then the top three across the finish line will get a medal and everyone has the same conditions during the final. Now it could happen that one of the two finals is messy, while the other is completely clean for all runners. I might then think it would be a bit unfair for the runners in one heat.”…\nThe Nike Indoor Nationals this year will feature scoring by state, the event culminating with an all-star distance medley of state teams…\nThe IOC says that it will be allowing youth teams (U16) from Russia and Belarus to return to international competition…\nIn the everyone-is-doing-it department, Under Armour has announced that it will be hosting its own prep nationals at Florida’s IMG Academy in Bradenton, set for the last weekend of May…\nUSTFCCCA’s Bowerman Award winners for ’25: Doris Lemngole of Alabama and Jordan Anthony of Arkansas…\nWorld Athletics gave its Member Federation Award for ’25 to China, host of the World Indoor and World Relays, along with two Diamond League meetings…\nMondo Duplantis, on winning WA’s AOY honor: “I hope to keep irritating everyone who has to vote for me for years to come.”…\nThe famous Tokyo doll shop, Kyugetsu, unveiled its annual collection of battledores (decorative badminton-like paddles) to honor positive newsmakers of the year.

Qatar, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates are all shopping, he says. It doesn’t sound like he has given them a flat no: “We told them what we are worth, and they are promising to up their game, so that’s how it is.” For its part, Botswana has given its champion a new house…\nGermany’s Jessica Schilder says she is gunning for 68-10¾ (21.00) in the shot. “My legs aren’t that strong; they need more muscle. It’s the body of a world champion, but not yet the body needed to become an Olympic champion.”…\nPolish high jumper Robert Wolski, 43, was killed in a car accident in December. He had a PR of 7-7 (2.31) and placed 8th at the World Indoor in ’06…\nCompensation department: a new deal is being offered to high school milers by the Italian apparel company Diadora. Quite simply, race the classic distance in a pair of its new Mezzofondo (Italian for “middle distance”) superspikes and if you’re the first to break the announced barrier, you’ll be NIL-compensated to the tune of $40,000. A boy will need to break 4:00, a girl 4:35 to become “the athlete connected to one of the boldest product launches in the sport,” says Diadora. “We believe this spike can change the conversation.”…\nTumultuous times for the USATF Board Of Directors, where 3 members were not only sidelined, but also had their USATF memberships completely suspended, making them ineligible to even attend the annual meeting. Two of the members, Mike Conley and Kristie Killough-Ali, were suspended because of their proximity to the continuing lawsuit by Jim Estes. The third, Jere Summers-Hall, apparently because of concerns raised by athletes and staff. USATF issued a statement that said, in part, “Following failed attempts to intervene, the Board had no choice but to act in the best interest of the organization. These decisions were made in near unanimity by a Board Of Directors that, while diverse in their perspectives, remains laser-focused on the business of running a national governing body and putting athletes first.”…\nThe Taliyah Brooks lawsuit against USATF for allowing the ’21 Trials heptathlon to proceed in extremely high temperatures, leading to her heat stroke, has been shot down by the Indiana Supreme Court, which focused its ruling on a procedural misstep…\nReportedly, multiple bidders are in the mix to host the ’28 U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials…\nFlorida coach Mike Holloway has been tabbed by USATF to head its High-Performance Division…\nUSATF’s Long Distance Running Committee will be surveying team members in Tallahassee on the question of whether the national XC championships should be held at different distances in non-WXC years.…\nNoah Lyles says that proper coverage of the sport’s rivalries can be a boost for its popularity. “But calling every competition of an athlete going up against another athlete a rivalry is not the same. There has to be a story. There has to be a purpose. There has to be intent. Just the fact that they happen to show up at the same track meet is not a rivalry.”…\nLyles was miffed that he and Melissa Jefferson-Wooden weren’t even nominated for WA’s AOY honors, saying, “At this point, this award is kind of a joke.” ◻︎",
