The project, Villas at York II, is the second phase of a rental development for the purpose of providing affordable housing for low- and moderate-income elderly residents in an urban in-fill area. In addition, rental tenants in units funded by the HOME-ARP Program must also meet one or more of the Qualifying Population definitions under that program. Funds will be provided to the project in the form of a loan. The site is approximately 5.52+/- acres, with approximately .76 +/- acres in the floodplain/floodway and a riverine which fronts Grayson Valley Drive. The project consists of the new construction of an approximately 45-unit single-story cottage style development to be constructed on approximately 4.76 +/- acres. A small portion of the site (flood area) contains a SFHA Zone X – 500 Year Floodplain, a SFHA Zone AE- BFE Not Determined Floodplain, a Floodway, and a wetland (riverine) which consists of approximately .76 +/- acres. No units will be constructed in the floodplain, floodway, or wetland area (riverine) and it will be left undisturbed. No known natural values are present in the flood area. The flood area has road frontage on Grayson Valley Drive and is currently undeveloped. It has no waterway, commercial, recreational, or educational usage. One corner of the flood area has a 20’ X 40’ drainage easement. There are no known rare biota or historical resources present. Jefferson County will, however, consult with the appropriate agencies for a determination. The proposed project is located at 1225 Grayson Valley Parkway, Birmingham, Alabama 35235 in unincorporated Jefferson County.\nThere are three primary purposes for this notice. First, people who may be affected by activities in floodplains and those who have an interest in the protection of the natural environment should be given an opportunity to express their concerns and provide information about these areas. Second, an adequate public notice program can be an important public educational tool. The dissemination of information about floodplains can facilitate and enhance Federal efforts to reduce the risks associated with the occupancy and modification of these special areas. Third, as a matter of fairness, when the Federal government determines it will participate in actions taking place in floodplains, it must inform those who may be put at greater or continued risk. Jefferson County, Alabama will comply with all state and local floodplain protection procedures.\nWritten comments must be received by the Jefferson County Department of Community Services at the following address on or before May 29, 2023: Jefferson County Department of Community Services, Suite A-430, 716 Richard Arrington Jr Blvd N, Birmingham, Alabama, 35203, Attention: Lynn Smith, Community Development Specialist.
