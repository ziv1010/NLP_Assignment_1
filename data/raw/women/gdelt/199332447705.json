As you may appreciate the crown courts have a huge backlog of work which means that trials do take a long time to come on.\n‘Because you have bail effectively you are sitting behind a queue of people in prison who are waiting to be tried.’\nHe was granted bail on the same conditions as with a previous hearing.\nPartey cannot contact any of the three alleged victims, and he must notify the police of any permanent address changes or travel abroad.\nThe player previously stated his address as Potters Bar, Hertfordshire.\nPartey, who was born in Krobo Odumase in Ghana and has played for the country’s national team dozens of times, transferred to Arsenal for £45 million and joined Villarreal on a free transfer when his contract in London expired.\nVillarreal’s manager Marcelino Garcia Toral said ahead of the Tottenham game that Partey is ‘mentally prepared and technically prepared to play tomorrow night.’\nHe said: ‘For sure he will be ready. We are very happy Thomas is with us for his football capacity, football ability and his presence as a human.’\nMore Trending\nThe Villarreal boss insisted that the attention should be on football amid the legal case, saying that ‘we’re playing a game of football tomorrow where the important thing is football. This is where football was invented after all.’\nPartey entered last night’s game in the 78th minute as a substitute and faced booing from the Tottenham Spurs fans, whose team beat Villarreal 1-0.\nThe player was charged four days after his contract with Arsenal ended at the end of June.\nAn Arsenal spokesperson commented on the legal case after Partey was charged: ‘The player’s contract ended on June 30. Due to ongoing legal proceedings, the club is unable to comment on the case.’\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\nFor more stories like this, check our news page.\nMORE: Mum ‘let alligators kill her young son and gave her newborn baby cocaine’\nMORE: Woman shot by husband on Valentine’s Day after trying to escape relationship\nMORE: Charlie Kirk ‘assassin’ Tyler Robinson appears in court for the first time",
