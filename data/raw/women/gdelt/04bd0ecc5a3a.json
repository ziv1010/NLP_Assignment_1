  "body_text": "Part of Rick George’s legacy as the 13-year leader of the Colorado athletic department will almost assuredly include his efforts to improve the totality of the student-athlete experience.\nIt’s a legacy Fernando Lovo intends to uphold.\nLovo was officially introduced as the seventh full-time athletic director in CU history on Monday, leading his first press conference in Boulder alongside Chancellor Justin Schwartz.\nLovo arrives following a one-year tenure as the AD at New Mexico, and he moves to CU at a time in which the athletic department is facing a budget deficit of $27 million caused in large part by the $20.5 million in revenue-sharing payments directed to athletes that began this year.\nUnder George’s watch, CU expanded many of the amenities available to athletes, such as improved nutrition and mental health support. George also made it a priority to keep those programs active during the COVID-19 shutdown.\nDespite the need to stretch dollars, Lovo said its his goal to maintain the standards of those support systems, while also touting his goal to see Colorado finish in the top 25 of the Learfield Directors’ Cup, which is awarded to the athletic program with the top all-sports success ever year.\nThe Buffs finished 69th in the Director’s Cup standings last year.\n“Every decision that we’re going to make is keeping our student-athletes first,” Lovo said. “I can tell you this — we have a really strong group of sports across the board that I think are well-positioned to win championships, and we’re going to continue down that pathway. We’re going to find innovative and creative ways to drive our revenue, because I believe that we should be in the top 25 each and every year for the Learfield (Directors’) Cup. And I know we can do that here.\n“My focus is listening, learning and embracing everything this wonderful institution has to offer. And I fully intend to pour into all of our sports and continue to build on what Rick has already established.\nFresh perspective\nLovo described his new job at CU as a “destination” opportunity, and Boulder certainly has been for much of the Buffaloes’ coaching staff. Men’s basketball coach Tad Boyle, women’s soccer coach Danny Sanchez and women’s lacrosse coach Ann Elliott Whidden all were hired by George’s predecessor, Mike Bohn. Men’s golf coach Roy Edwards has been a Buff since 2006.\nAnd there are assistants on the staffs of Boyle, Sanchez and volleyball coach Jesse Mahoney, who just completed his 10th season at CU, that have been there since the beginning of those coaching tenures. Women’s basketball head coach JR Payne and her associate head coach (and husband) Toriano Towns are also in their 10th season at CU.\nSanchez said having a fresh set of eyes on the department, particularly during a time of upheaval in college athletics, will be a benefit to all of the Buffs’ athletic programs.\n“I think the great thing about CU is we don’t have a million sports,” Sanchez said. “You can really put your time and effort and energy and money into the sports that we all can compete for championship. As opposed to having 30 sports, and somebody’s going to be left in the wake.\n“You don’t become an AD at a place like Colorado at his age if you don’t know what you’re doing, or if you’re not prepared. Everyone that comes here, this is where they want to finish. When you have an AD that comes in and sees that, and he has a young family, there’s no better place to raise a family. If it’s done right, we can compete for and win championships in all our sports.”\nGetting unpacked\nWhile Lovo moved around a little during the early years of his career, moving from his alma mater Florida to Ohio State to Houston through 2015 before landing at Texas in 2016. However, Lovo spent seven of the next eight years in Austin, spending the 2021 football season with the Jacksonville Jaguars before returning to Texas.\nYet after taking the athletic director job at New Mexico 13 months ago, the move to Boulder marks the second major move for Lovo and his family in a relatively short amount of time. Lovo says he doesn’t expect to pack his bags again any time soon.\n“I know I’m only the seventh athletic director in the history of Colorado athletics, and I think speaks to what makes this institution so wonderful,” Lovo said. “The continuity over the years is a powerful statement, and it’s one that really resonated with me as I was exploring this opportunity.\n“We are just beyond thrilled to be here and can’t wait to spend a meaningful time with our personal lives and my professional life here at CU.”",
