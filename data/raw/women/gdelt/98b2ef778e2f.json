Vice-captains Jess Whelan and Amy Bissett will form an extended leadership group with Elise Hoiberg-Cox and Finlay Bryan.\n2023 FINISH: Premiers (15 wins and one loss)\nINS: Nikki Ellis (Ulverstone), Piper Humphries (Burnie), Tara Moore (Ulverstone) and Sharna Appleby\nOUTS: Charlie Vandenberg (WAFLW), Alana Jago, Sahvanna Cox and Kassidy Coward (Circular Head)\nPREDICTED FINISH: \"It will be hard to take second [after winning in 2023]. We want to be back in the number one spot,\" Weller said.\n\"With the standard of this group, I've got 110 per cent confidence we can be back in the same position, even though the doubters have already started.\"\nPLAYERS TO WATCH:\n1.Olivia Smith and Abbie Hoiberg-Cox - The reigning competition best and fairest and the Cats' former playing coach require no introduction. Both Olivia and Abbie will be making the step up to the VFLW this season, but Weller said the duo will still play a big role in Wynyard's quest for back-to-back premierships.\n2.Tayla Hoiberg-Cox - The name itself holds some familiarity, with Weller describing Tayla as one young talent to watch this season. Tayla played a big role for the Cats' under 17 girl's side last year, also making a string of appearances for the senior women.\nPRE-SEASON BOLTER: Ella Moodie\nAlready impressed by the 16-year-old's \"dedication and work ethic\", Weller described Moodie's ability as well beyond her years. Weller expects Moodie to play through the Cats' forward line and into the midfield.\nCOACH'S COMMENTS:\n\"A big thing for us is our team spirit and morale. We're building a culture that's really important, and we think our football will speak for itself as a result,\" Weller said.\n\"We've got six girls, which is the most in the North-West, who are in the Tasmania Devils under 18 program. I think that speaks to the quality of girls we have.\"\n\"The biggest thing for us is continuing to drive that off-field culture. Both our assistant coaches Noah Fleming and Peter Smith are just as important as I am in driving that.\"\nPENGUIN\nCOACH: Clint Schulze\nCAPTAIN: Emilie Saward and Tayla Marshall. Vice-captain will be Kirby Gibbons.\n2023 FINISH: Runners-up (11 wins, four losses and one draw)\nINS: Chloe and Libby Haines (Ulverstone), Ana Bermudez (Ulverstone), Deborah Bonde (Barwon Heads), Jessica Smith\nOUTS: Cyndra Williams (Burnie), Christy Duncan, Simone Weller, Ebony Cullen\nPREDICTED FINISH: \"Realistically top three,\" Schulze said.\nPLAYERS TO WATCH:\n1.Chloe Haines - Having been \"training the house down\" throughout pre-season, Schulze also highlighted Chloe's six goals in three quarters during the Two Blues' recent practice match.\n2.Georgia Purton - Also training at a high level, Schulze expects Purton to take \"a big step forward\" this season.\n3.Charlotte Dennis - Returning from a knee injury, Schulze said Dennis has been \"building nicely\" and will be a \"really important player to have back\".\nPRE-SEASON BOLTER: Amarli Johnson\n\"She could quietly be one of the best in the competition,\" Schulze said.\nLooking \"sharp\" throughout pre-season, Schulze said Johnson will play at centre half-forward.\nCOACH'S COMMENTS:\n\"I don't think we could've been any happier with our pre-season,\" Schulze said.\n\"It has been our best by a long way and the work ethic has been really good. I think you'll see us build slowly, and our best footy will be at the back half of the season.\n\"I'm a clean state person [in regard to losing the grand final in 2023] - the motivation comes from knowing we got there, and that we're capable.\n\"We wanted some more speed at ground level, which is where we've been exposed. We've now got four or five of the faster players in the competition.\"\nDEVONPORT\nCOACH: James Gray\nCAPTAIN: Kelsey Aherne and Raigan Kettle. Vice-captains will be Bronte Byard and Maighan Singleton.\n2023 FINISH: Third (Eight wins, seven losses and one draw)\nINS: Aspen Auton (Ulverstone)\nOUTS: Tegan Byard (Injury)\nPREDICTED FINISH: \"We're definitely aiming for top three again, but we're not out to get a premiership or make the grand final,\" Gray said.\nPLAYERS TO WATCH:\n1.Raigan Kettle - Gray described Kettle as \"an underdog\", highlighting her win of runner up league best and fairest in 2023. He said Kettle would be \"one to watch\" now she can \"focus on her own game\" after being an assistant coach last season.\n2.Kelsey Aherne and Bronte Byard - Gray alluded to a \"mixture of things\" being done with both Aherne and Byard to \"change their games\" and take this to a new level, only benefiting the Magpies.\nPRE-SEASON BOLTER: Jaz Stokes\nThe work put in and skills developed by Stokes, the Magpies' young ruckman, has impressed Gray throughout pre-season.\nCOACH'S COMMENTS:\n\"What I want from the girls in the early part of the season is to get a general understanding of the game. My goal is to teach them footy brains first, and then we can start to look at everything after that,\" Gray said.\n\"I want them to build knowledge and confidence, and respect for their opposition, so when they go out against teams like Penguin and Wynyard they aren't panicking when they get the ball.\"",
