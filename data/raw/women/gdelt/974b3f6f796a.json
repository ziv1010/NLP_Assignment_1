  "body_text": "Manchester United boss Marc Skinner has responded to the worrying speculation that Grace Clinton could be on her way out of the club before the close of the summer transfer window.\nClinton linked to Manchester City\nA report covered by The Peoples Person on Tuesday relayed that Clinton is a target for cross-town rivals Manchester City.\nCity are believed to be keen on adding Clinton to their ranks amidst uncertainty over her long-term future at Leigh Sports Village.\nHer contract expires next summer and there has been no progress in talks over fresh terms. Unless United and Clinton’s camp strike an agreement, the attacking midfielder will be available as a free agent in one year.\nHowever, City are not willing to wait that long and want to strike a deal before the transfer window closes on September 4th.\nSeen as one of the best talents in English football, Clinton was a key part of the success that United enjoyed in the Women’s Super League last term. Her performances earned her a maiden call-up to England’s Euro 2025 squad that would go on to win the whole tournament last month.\nAhead of United’s Champions League meeting with PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday, Skinner opened up on the Clinton rumours and shut them down.\nSkinner talks about Clinton transfer speculation\nSkinner said [as quoted by She Kicks], “Right now, I’ve not been told anything of the sorts.”\n“I’m sure there are people interested in Grace, because she’s a fantastic footballer, but the reality is, the club have not told me anything of that.”\n“As I am now, I am preparing for Champions League tomorrow and Grace is progressing nicely to being part of our squad going forward.”\nUnited have had a quiet transfer window, only signing two players – Julia Zigiotti Olme and Fridolina Rolfo. There was hope that the club would snap up RB Leipzig forward Giovanna Hoffmann but talks have collapsed and the transfer is not expected to get over the line.\nHowever, Skinner insisted he still wants to make additions to the attacking department.\n“We need to bring forwards in, I think, in this window, potentially two.”\n“I’m probably looking for two players in this window while we’ve got time left. Giovanna [Hoffmann] was one of those players that we looked at. I don’t think right now the valuation, we’re meeting in the middle.”\n“Right now that doesn’t look like something that can happen. But again, I must stress we’re looking in those forward areas, so we have an array of options and people we’re looking at.”\nUnited vs. PSV kicks off at 11:00 BST at the 3Arena in Stockholm, Sweden.\nFeatured image Steve Bardens via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
