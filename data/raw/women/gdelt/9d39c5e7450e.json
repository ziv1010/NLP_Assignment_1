Persevere today.\nWhile You Were Sleeping: A stunner down under\nThere are plenty of tennis fans who don’t remember the buzz that accompanied Madison Keys when she arrived on the scene. And you really can’t blame them — it was 16 years ago, as Matthew Futterman writes.\nAdvertisement\nBut everything changed in an instant yesterday when the nearly 30-year-old American shocked world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka to win the Australian Open, 6-3, 2-6, 7-5, for her first Grand Slam title (with much of her home country still asleep). Some context on Keys’ arduous path to glory:\n- Keys was just 14 when she won her first WTA match at her first pro tournament.\n- It had been eight years since her only other Grand Slam final appearance (2017 U.S. Open).\n- Keys had to go through the world Nos. 2 and 7 in Melbourne before meeting the Belarusian Sabalenka, who was expected to win her third straight Australian Open. Keys becomes the first player to defeat a No. 1 and No. 2 in a Grand Slam since 2009. 🤯\n- Keys entered the tournament +5000 to win it all, per BetMGM, and Sabalenka was a -325 favorite heading into the final. (For reference: The Jaguars and Steelers entered the 2024 NFL season at +5000 to win the Super Bowl.)\nSo it was particularly moving when reality set in after the win for Keys, now among the oldest first-time Slam winners ever on the women’s side:\nCrying.\nLaughing.\nHappiness.Madison Keys is experiencing all the emotions following her dream Melbourne moment 🤩#AusOpen pic.twitter.com/TZUSl1lOo9\n— Eurosport (@eurosport) January 25, 2025\nA much different story in the men’s final, which finished minutes ago as we type this Sunday morning. Top seed Jannik Sinner cruised. You can get all the details here. Sinner now has three majors already.\nNFL Watch Guide: History is nigh\nTonight, we will know the Super Bowl matchup. It is hard to overstate what’s at stake before that, though, as four teams battle to define personal and franchise legacies in a 60-minute football game.\nHere’s to parsing through the magnitude, along with some Good Bets (odds via BetMGM):\nCommanders at Eagles\n3 p.m. ET on Fox\nA beautiful matchup, story-wise. The rookie/prodigal son, Jayden Daniels, leading Washington to its first conference title game since 1991, against a division rival who made — and lost — the Super Bowl two seasons ago. The teams split the season series. Daniels can arguably cement his place as the best rookie QB in league history by becoming the first to ever make a Super Bowl. Philadelphia QB Jalen Hurts can make his second Super Bowl in four years as a starter. Not bad.\nGood Bet: Commanders (+240). Why not? I’ve come up with so many reasons to pick against them — and there are plenty, namely Saquon Barkley and the Eagles’ defense — but they seem inevitable.\nAdvertisement\nBills at Chiefs\n6:30 p.m. ET on CBS\nThis is Kaiju-on-Kaiju violence. Two of the best quarterbacks and teams of this age have played to a lopsided record in the playoffs, as the Josh Allen-led Bills have never prevailed after Week 17. Getting past the two-time defending champs at Arrowhead Stadium is hard enough for Buffalo to overcome. I wonder: Do the Chiefs feel any pressure? A three-peat is on the line, but they are a dynasty win or lose here. Also, this game could smash viewership records.\nGood Bet: Chiefs (-2). Sorry to Allen, but I just can’t bring myself to pick the upset. I imagine this ends in especially heartbreaking fashion, too. The three-peat moves on.\nWant more insights? Jeff Howe spoke to coaches and executives around the league for their predictions.\nNews to Know\nNFL coaching carousel winding down\nThe Saints have the last open head-coaching gig in the NFL after the Raiders hired Pete Carroll and the Cowboys tabbed Brian Schottenheimer on Friday. Schottenheimer, 51, has been with Dallas for the last three seasons and has spent 14 years as an NFL offensive coordinator; he’s a qualified hire, to be sure, just not a particularly exciting one. But in Las Vegas, conversely, the 73-year-old Carroll was coveted for his record as a culture builder who should be able to help level out the franchise’s turbulence.\nA bonus stat to melt your brain (h/t to our Mike Sando): Carroll’s 181 career wins are more than those of the last 14 Raiders coaches … combined!🤯\nA rare in-season NHL blockbuster\nThe Hurricanes surprised everyone Friday night, six weeks before the March 7 trade deadline, acquiring pending unrestricted free agents Mikko Rantanen and Taylor Hall in a three-team deal with the Avalanche and Blackhawks. It was a painful but sensible deal for Colorado, which likely couldn’t have afforded Rantanen this summer. The 28-year-old is on pace for his third straight 100-point season, with 25 goals and 39 assists in 49 games. High marks for Carolina in our trade grades.\nMore news\n- The one-of-one Paul Skenes MLB Debut Patch autographed card we wrote about last week — pulled by an 11-year-old card collector from Los Angeles — will be auctioned off. Sorry, Pirates.\n- No. 2 South Carolina women’s basketball defeated No. 5 LSU 66-56 on Friday, handing the Tigers their first loss of the season. Read the full recap.\n- Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth will make their PGA Tour season debuts at Pebble Beach next week. More details here.\n- Utah Hockey Club is hitting speed bumps in securing trademarks for the six finalists to be its permanent team name, including Yeti.\nWhat We’re Watching: The only sports movie* was snubbed\nHi folks, it’s me, Hannah Vanbiber, your Pulse pop culture correspondent, calling to report an Oscars snub!\nThe Oscar nominations were announced Thursday morning, and the single sports film that had a shot at snagging some hardware — the Zendaya-helmed tennis movie “Challengers” — got completely shut out. (It had been a favorite to compete in several categories, including score and screenplay.)\nBut I’m here today because of that pesky *, signaling a question that cropped up at Pulse HQ: Is “Challengers” even a true sports movie? 🤔 Let’s discuss:\nCase against: “Challengers is about a love triangle and only incidentally about tennis.”\nCase for:\n- Is “Remember the Titans” not a sports movie just because it’s also about civil rights and the power of Denzel’s silky voice? What are sports if not a proxy for the human experience at the most grit-deep level?\n- “Challengers” respects tennis. Everything about the film celebrates the high skill of a perfect volley, the flow state of an athletic quest for perfection, the rush of rivalry, the intoxicating sting of never being satisfied. In the words of Zendaya’s character, tennis prodigy Tashi Duncan: “Tennis is a relationship.”\n- What “Challengers” has done for sports:\n- Google searches for “adult tennis lessons” were up 245 percent shortly after the premiere.\n- Searches for “tennis skirt outfit summer” skyrocketed by 138 percent (including one successful purchase by Yours Truly!).\n- The 2024 Met Gala, co-hosted by Zendaya, broke its fundraising record, and the 2025 honorary chair is LeBron James. “Challengers” → LeBron?\n- Tennis also had a record-breaking year in terms of TV viewership, tournament attendance and search popularity. I’m not saying “Challengers” did that, but I am saying there’s a correlation.\n- The movie itself grossed over $96 million at the box office on a reported $55 million budget.\nVerdict: It may have been snubbed at the Oscars, but Challengers is a worthy entry into the sports movie hall of fame. Agree?\nFurther reading/listening:\nPulse Picks\nThe NBA trade deadline creeps closer.
