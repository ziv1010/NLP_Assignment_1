  "body_text": "A powerful 6.9-magnitude earthquake jolted the central Philippines on Tuesday, killing at least 69 people.\nThe earthquake struck at 9.59pm local time off Cebu island's northern end, near Bogo, a city of 90,000 people, according to the US Geological Survey.\nCivil defence deputy administrator Raffy Alejandro said the death toll remains \"fluid\" as more reports come in from emergency responders.\nCebu governor Pamela Baricuatro said the Cebu provincial hospital in Bogo recorded 25 deaths from the city alone.\n“Because of the high volume of patients with serious injuries, the medical staff tended to some of them outside the hospital,” Mrs Baricuatro posted on her Facebook page.\nRescuers earlier tallied six more deaths elsewhere in the province, while the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council listed 147 injured across the central islands, where 22 buildings were damaged.\nDramatic footage filmed by residents and shared widely on social media showed an old Catholic church on Bantayan island near Cebu adorned with a string of light bulbs swaying wildly shortly before its belfry tumbled into the courtyard.\n“I heard a loud booming noise from the direction of the church, then I saw rocks falling from the structure. Luckily no one got hurt,” said Martham Pacilan, who was nearby when the belfry collapsed.\nLocal television showed riders being forced to dismount from their motorcycles and hold on to railings as a bridge in Cebu rocked violently.\nBuildings were damaged as far as Cebu city, 100km south of Bogo, where online shoe merchant Jayford Maranga, 21, hid under a restaurant table to avoid being struck by the collapsing metal ceiling of a shopping mall.\n“My friend and I ate at the food court near closing time and then, bang! It was as if the Earth stopped spinning. And then the mall started shaking,” Mr Maranga said. His friend was slightly injured, he added.\nThe Cebu provincial government has put out a call on its Facebook page for medical volunteers to assist in the aftermath. “There could be people trapped beneath collapsed buildings,” rescue official Wilson Ramos said.\nOvernight recovery efforts were hampered by aftershocks, he added. The rescue mission proceeded all night as the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the region was rocked by 379 aftershocks.\nThe quake caused electricity lines to trip, leading to power cuts across Cebu and nearby central islands, though power was restored shortly after midnight in Cebu and four other major islands, the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines said.\nThe Cebu government reported that a commercial building and a school in Bantayan had collapsed, while a fast-food restaurant in Bogo was heavily damaged.\nAgnes Merza, 65, a carer in Bantayan, said her kitchen tiles had cracked. “It felt as though we would all fall down. It's the first time I have experienced it. The neighbours all ran out of their homes. My two teenage assistants hid under a table because that's what they were taught in the Boy Scouts,” she told AFP.\nA number of village roads also sustained damage.\nQuakes are a near-daily occurrence in the Philippines, which is situated on the Pacific “Ring of Fire”, an arc of intense seismic activity stretching from Japan through South-east Asia and across the Pacific basin.",
