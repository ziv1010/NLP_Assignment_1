  "body_text": "Round one of the Concacaf Champions Cup starts this week. If you're unfamiliar with the CCC, it's the perpetually renamed version of the thing that the Seattle Sounders won in 2022 when it was called the Concacaf Champions League. Previously under the CCC banner, the USL Sounders were the first U.S. team to qualify. The Galaxy and D.C. United won the CCC-named tournament at points in time too, albeit in different formats.\nThis year's CCC is larger and starts so early in the season that two of Canada's qualifiers can't use their home stadiums – both Cavalry (Calgary) and Vancouver Whitecaps are playing on Vancouver Island.\nOther sites may try to tell you the tactics and rosters for the teams (read ESPN for that), but there are 27 teams and as a Seattle soccer fan my sole interest in the 2024 CCC is setting up the Sounders for a better showing in the 2025 Club World Cup than the 2023 CWC.\nTuesday's matches are on FS2 and FoxSports.com (authentication required). Don't fact-check me, but the Sounders have played all four teams featured on Tuesday. With two Central American sides hosting two Liga MX teams the easy thing would be to root for the Central American sides. Do That! Comunicaciones and Real Estelí haven't hurt you like Monterrey and Club America have.\nWednesday has three matches, only available on ViX. That is going to make it hard to watch the Vancouver Whitecaps play a home match in Starlight Stadium. It's a 6,000-seater about 30 minutes west of Victoria. Tigres gets to experience Victoria. All-in-all this seems like a lot of fun to experience for both teams. I hope Tigres players get to have high tea at the Empress, fish & chips at the houseboats and a walk or water taxi around the Inner Harbor.\nForge is the best CPL team ever. They're basically the '90s Yankees of that league. They're going to get absolutely crushed by Chivas. No, Chivas isn't the grand team they've been and they have a long distance to travel. But it's a CPL side against a Liga MX team. Hamilton, and it's just below freezing temps, will have no magic for Forge.\nHerediano and Toluca is the other match. Don't get hung up on it and default to rooting against the Liga MX team unless you have a personal connection.\nThe rest of the first legs of the opening round don't take place for another two weeks.\nWhich gets down to the real way to hate-watch the CCC – root against Concacaf, where the points don't matter and the rules are made to favor the revenue-generating leagues of MLS and Liga MX. The rules certainly aren't made up to have a fair competition.\n– Dave\nStocking up on new branded gear or planning to purchase MLS Season Pass?
