In place of the traditional St George’s Cross on the back of the shirt’s collar, Nike has opted to alter the traditionally red horizontal element with shades of navy, light blue, and purple – a move which many have deemed absurd and uncalled-for.\nThe social media consensus surrounding Nike’s ‘playful update‘, set to be shared by both the men’s and women’s teams, seems to be one of almost-universal disapproval. But has the modification truly infringed on England’s much-valued heritage, or is the resulting anger merely petty and inconsequential? Former England winger John Barnes has referred to the fiasco as “much ado about nothing”, and he might just have a point.\nSpeaking to BBC reporters, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak weighed in on the debate by saying that, “when it comes to our national flags, we shouldn’t mess with them because they’re a source of pride, identity, who we are, and they’re perfect as they are”. Mr Sunak’s opposite number on the political pitch, Sir Keir Starmer, joined the Prime Minister in stating that, “the flag is used by everybody and is a unifier”. The Labour leader added, “It doesn’t need to be changed”.\nA central English sporting memory was made in 1966 when Bobby Moore lifted that ‘gleaming’ trophy. It is telling, however, that the iconic away shirt donned by the team on that momentous day was, after all, red and white\nThe Football Association (FA) has insisted that it “completely stands by [the change]”, saying that the choice was intended to pay homage to the “classic colour regime of 1966 training gear”. This reasoning has understandably furrowed eyebrows, given that purple was nowhere to be seen on the 1966 jackets worn by Sir Alf Ramsey’s legendary squad.\nWhenever a major tournament rolls around and the Lightning Seeds’ classic ‘Three Lions’, inevitably finds its way back into the charts, many an England fan will sing the words, “Jules Rimet still gleaming” – a central English sporting memory was made in 1966 when Bobby Moore lifted that ‘gleaming’ trophy. It is telling, however, that the iconic away shirt donned by the team on that momentous day was, after all, red and white.\nThe strong antagonism towards the revamped cross is neither exclusivist nor nationalistic, but perhaps a natural response. One can imagine the outrage that would occur if Scotland’s Saltire was made perpendicular instead of diagonal, or even if Wales’s fierce red dragon became a docile sheep. In fact, Cardiff City owner Vincent Tan received widespread disapproval back in 2012 after replacing the bluebird on the club’s badge with a Welsh dragon. His motive was to attract ‘international markets’, but pressure from the fanbase eventually forced a reversal of the change. Tampering with established and cherished iconography has long been an ill-judged move, never more so than with the current England shirt controversy.\nThe change to the St George’s Cross on the new shirts is undoubtedly a puzzling choice from the kit’s designers, which begs the response, to idiomatically echo Mr Starmer, ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’.\nOne grandmother went so far as to make an iron-on St George’s Cross to cover up Nike’s much-maligned effort on a shirt bought for her grandson. Her husband told The Sun: “It only cost about £1, and she ironed it on top of the badge on the back of the collar to cover up that awful woke design.” The decision to alter England’s (literal) cultural fabric has evidently been poorly-received by many traditionalists, who find it hard to cope with any upsetting of the apple cart, no matter how subtle.\nSeaman’s confidence that the refashioned cross equates to a weakening of national character differs sharply from the excitement of Southgate’s boys and the Lionesses\nElsewhere, however, the abundantly positive reactions from the England teams hoping to forge memories in the new shirt would suggest this backlash to be, as Barnes insinuates, an unnecessary distraction from what matters most: playing football.\nEngland ballers past and present have, like the country at large, submitted their reviews of the new home kit. Arsenal stars Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka, both of whom will play a key role in Gareth Southgate’s Euro 2024 squad, were enthusiastic about the shirt’s design. “I think this is the best kit we are going to wear”, praised Saka, while Rice, who captained the national team for the first time in a recent friendly against Belgium, added that the kit “is a ten, a classic”. England Lioness Alessia Russo has also given a thumbs-up to the new kit.\nFormer England goalkeeper David Seaman’s stance on the update was more lukewarm. “What’s next?” quipped the Euro ‘96 keeper to TalkSport. “Are we going to change the three lions to three cats? Leave it alone!” Seaman’s confidence that the refashioned cross equates to a weakening of national character differs sharply from the excitement of Southgate’s boys and the Lionesses who will be competing in the shirts.\nWhat really matters is unifying as a country and backing Gareth Southgate’s team in Germany this summer\nThe players’ readiness to perform in the widely-panned shirt makes one thing clear: when the dust has settled, what really matters is unifying as a country and backing Gareth Southgate’s team in Germany this summer. The St George’s Cross has only been a frequent fixture on the shirt since the early 2000s, and, as the gaffer himself has declared: “The most important thing on an England shirt … are the Three Lions.” While the current design choice is admittedly questionable and unnecessary, England’s true flag is not going anywhere.\nMoving forward, it will be Nike’s task to learn some lessons from the kit’s polarising reception, while we as fans should put any lingering resentment behind us and start looking ahead to what promises to be a memorable footballing summer.\nComments (2)\n-\nInsightful. I suppose as long as it doesn’t annoy the team and disrupt their morale it should be tolerable. But the red cross also wouldn’t really look that great in terms of matching with the colourway of the shirt. It would look a bit off. But it should still also be easily recognisable. Where do you stand?\n-\nHi Sourav, I’d say that having a design which is cohesive with the colourway should play second fiddle to actually getting the cross itself right! As you say, though, the players’ morale is most important, and we should just try and look past it. Nevertheless, I still remain in the (slightly) peeved-off camp…\n-",
