He scored a remarkable 35 times last season.\nThe 28-year-old played in 29 league games, scoring 21 times along the way, but it was in the Champions League where his performances really stood out.\nDembélé scored eight goals and assisted on six others in 15 matches as he led a young PSG side to its first-ever Champions League crown.\nWhile primarily utilized as a winger during his career, Dembélé often played down the middle for Luis Enrique’s side, spearheading a fluent and formidable front three, flanked by the dynamic Désiré Doué and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia.\nThe role suited the former Barcelona man as he was able to link play between his teammates and receive the ball in positions where he could cause the most damage for opposition teams – as seen during PSG’s historic night in Munich.\nDespite not scoring, Dembélé was a constant thorn in the side of Inter Milan and set up two goals while also helping to create another during his side’s 5-0 win.\nDembélé was able to attend Monday’s ceremony as he is recovering from a right hamstring injury suffered during national team duty earlier this month. His teammates couldn’t celebrate in person as PSG faced Marseille on France’s south coast in a previously postponed Ligue 1 match. The reigning titleholders fell 1-0 on Monday, their first defeat of the season.\nNo stranger to earning this award, Bonmatí has now been named the best women’s soccer player in the world for an incredible three years running.\nThe midfielder has dominated world football in recent years and was once again crucial to Barcelona Femení’s success last season.\nBarcelona picked up a domestic treble as the side continued its stranglehold on Spanish soccer but the 27-year-old will no doubt be disappointed after losing two major finals against English opposition.\nBonmatí’s Barcelona lost to Arsenal in the Champions League final before falling to England on penalties at Euro 2025. Despite this, Bonmatí remained a constant in the biggest moments in women’s soccer.\nAfter accepting the award, she reflected on her role and the future of the sport.\n“We are more than footballers. We are leading by example through all the world. For the new generations coming, I think they can dream about being footballers, not like our generation. They can dream it. This is the best thing we can achieve,” Bonmatí said.\nBarcelona’s Lamine Yamal won the men’s Kopa Trophy for a second straight year, awarded to the best under-21 player. The 18-year phenom was also nominated for the Ballon d’Or. Completing the Barca and Spain sweep of the category, attacking midfielder Vicky López won the women’s Kopa Trophy.\nThe women’s Johan Cruyff Trophy winner (coach of the year) was England’s Sarina Wiegman. She guided the Lionesses to back-to-back Women’s Euro titles in 2025.\nAfter leading his side to the Champions League and Ligue 1 titles last season, PSG’s manager, Luis Enrique, captured the men’s Johan Cruyff Trophy.\nFrance Football has been honoring the sport’s best since 1956.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
