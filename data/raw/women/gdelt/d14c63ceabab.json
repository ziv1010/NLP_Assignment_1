  "body_text": "How Arteta-McVay bond helped Arsenal & Rams reach top\n- Published\nA year ago today, Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay was \"not in a great place\".\nThe night before, his team had suffered a \"terrible loss\" at home that left their NFL play-off hopes hanging by a thread.\nThen he spoke with Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, whose team is another of those owned by the Kroenke Sports & Entertainment (KSE) group.\nArteta happened to be at the Rams' training facility as he and some Arsenal executives were visiting during football's international break.\n\"Mikel went into Sean's office and they spent two hours talking about player connections, ideas and things that Mikel had done,\" the Rams' president Kevin Demoff told BBC Sport.\n\"Sean took a step back from the day-to-day of 'we just lost to Miami' and into 'this is what makes a great leader, this is how we do it'.\n\"We then had this amazing run, and I truly do believe that Sean was invigorated by that conversation with Mikel. I credit Mikel with some of our turnaround last year.\"\nMcVay led the Rams to victory in six of their next seven games to clinch the NFC West divisional title before being halted in the post-season by the eventual Super Bowl winners, the Philadelphia Eagles.\nArteta and McVay have developed a bond that has proved mutually beneficial, helping Arsenal and the Rams become title contenders in the Premier League and NFL this season.\nIt is also a prime example of how KSE, the world's most valuable sports empire, external at $21.2bn (£16.3bn), is using cross-sport collaboration to become even stronger.\nWhy coaches have become kindred spirits\nStan Kroenke already owned the NBA's Denver Nuggets, the NHL's Colorado Avalanche and Major League Soccer side Colorado Rapids when he became the Rams' full owner in 2010, followed by Arsenal's majority shareholder in 2011.\nMcVay was just 30 when hired by the Rams in 2017, while Arsenal appointed a 37-year-old Arteta in 2019.\nThe pair have since discovered they are kindred spirits, always open to ways to improve and get the best out of themselves and their players.\nMcVay was a highly-rated footballer at high school before choosing to focus on American football but it was Arteta's man-management and leadership style that really piqued his interest in Arsenal's All Or Northing documentary from 2021-22.\n\"Sean watched it and said 'I don't know if I would have handled [Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang] the way Mikel did',\" said Demoff. \"He took a lot of strength from how Mikel handled adversity, [and thought] 'that's something I want to be better at'.\"\nArteta and McVay have forged a friendship over several meetings on each side of the Atlantic, during their off-season, football's international breaks or when their team plays overseas.\nThey have spoken of their mutual admiration and how they learn from each other, despite coaching in different sports.\n\"It's not only about the sport, it's about the culture, about managing,\" Arteta said before the Rams' NFL game at Wembley last month. \"It's always that willingness to learn, that curiosity to learn.\"\nArsenal's chief executive Richard Garlick said they share \"that energy, that passion, that affability. They are like sponges - they take stuff in and invite reflection. They are brave like that. They'll ask the players what they think\".\nDemoff added: \"I see so much of that in their relationship. What they often talk about is their connection with players, how that shows up and how that translates.\"\nThe NFL tactics influencing the Premier League\n- Published30 September 2025\nWhat is KSE's ethos and DNA?\nAccording to Demoff, Stan Kroenke and his son Josh have a relatively hands-off approach with KSE. They are \"very clear and intentional about laying out the brand values and ethos\", then \"entrust you to go execute\".\n\"There's a DNA that connects all of these franchises: you want to develop young players into stars, and then reward them,\" added Demoff, who has also been KSE's president of team and media operations since March 2024.\n\"That's the mindset. There's a similar DNA in terms of what they're looking for in coaching.\"\nKSE gave McVay and Arteta their first senior appointments, while Arsenal women's coach Renee Slegers (34) and Nuggets head coach David Adelman (36) were both relatively young when they joined the organisation before being promoted from within.\nBukayo Saka is an Arsenal academy product and Arteta has ushered Myles Lewis-Skelly, Ethan Nwaneri and now Max Dowman into the Gunners' first team.\nPuka Nacua, Kobie Turner and Jared Verse soon established themselves with the Rams after being drafted over the past two years, while the Nuggets developed Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray into NBA championship winners.\nGarlick added: \"When I joined Arsenal (2021), you could see there was a clear plan as to how they were going to develop the team and that has played out to where it's challenging on all fronts.\"\nOf course, being competitive is another of KSE's values and under their ownership, all of their major league teams have won a championship, apart from Arsenal, who lead the Premier League by four points.\nArteta said last month: \"We have to share the vision and especially the ambition, and the ambition is very clear - we are here to win major trophies.\n\"Every sign [the Kroenkes] are giving us, every conversation, that's the main topic. They are incredibly experienced in sport, they win almost everything, and we want to do that here.\"\nWhat football can learn from NFL's international games\n- Published20 October 2025\nWhy Arsenal could be set for revenue boost\nDemoff said that Arteta and McVay's competitive nature \"is what drives them\". It is now driving the rest of the organisation too, as the working relationship between KSE's most prominent coaches embodies how the group wants all of its staff to operate.\nBesides KSE's annual team summit, the cross-sport connections are more organic than prescriptive. But when those opportunities arise, such as the Rams' recent London game, their staff are encouraged to share ideas and insights, to \"think bigger picture and connect dots\".\nBefore the Rams' first London game in 2012, they trained at Arsenal's training base and saw their players wearing tracking devices. The Rams introduced them in 2013, allowing them to monitor player workload, and the team has since suffered the fewest injuries in the NFL.\nOnce when Arsenal trained at the Rams' facility, Arteta noticed the number of cameras filming the players and said \"this is the sort of thing that we need to do\".\nSome of Demoff's closest friends in the industry are at the San Francisco 49ers, who now own Leeds United and Rangers too, but \"we're all competitors. There's only so much people are willing to share, whereas here, there is no limit. Everybody realises that being an open book makes us all better\".\nIn recent years, the vision of Stan and Josh Kroenke has been to bring KSE's teams and entities closer together, in terms of both sport and commercially.\nWith the Rams playing international games this season and next, they have been working with Arsenal to see how they can grow their fanbase and brand globally.\nAnd in January, KSE formed Kroenke Signature Properties (KSP), a division dedicated to sharing resources and making it easier for partners to connect if they wish to branch out from the UK market to the US, or vice-versa.\n\"It's more joined up, it's the ability to spread that reach,\" said Garlick. \"We can leverage those different areas we've got across the globe.\"\nDemoff added that \"the goal is to grow revenue, to be helpful in the US and drive revenue into Arsenal, where obviously that's valuable from a PSR (profit and sustainability rules) perspective.\n\"But also to tell a story of 'there's power when your brand shows up at Emirates Stadium or SoFi Stadium', especially given the global events that are coming to Los Angeles via the World Cup (2026), the Super Bowl (2027) and the Olympics (2028).\"\nRelated topics\n- Published30 October 2025\n- Published16 August 2025",
