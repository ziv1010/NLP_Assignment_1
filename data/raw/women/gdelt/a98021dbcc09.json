Temporary athletic coach Alex Burgess was also told that his services would be put on hold.\nAn investigation into the decision to allow the trans member to compete is under investigation. State law requires athletic participants to compete in their biological gender.\nA spokesperson for Broward County Public Schools said Cecil and the other staffers were reassigned 'pending the outcome of an investigation into allegations of improper student participation in sports.'\nHundreds of students at Monarch High School in Coconut Creek, Florida, flooded the football field in back-to-back demonstrations to support their school principal\nThe teens waved signs in support of school staff and chanted 'trans lives matter'\n'I think this has completely ruined her life,' team captain Jordan Campbell said of the unnamed student.\n'I played with her and I think everyone who thinks that they have this opinion on her but don’t even know her, have no idea who she is. She was the sweetest person anyone has ever met.'\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a law in 2021 excluding transgender girls and women from girls' and women’s sports teams in public schools.\n'In Florida, girls are going to play girls sports and boys are going to play boys sports,' DeSantis said as he signed the bill into law. 'We're going to make sure that that's the reality.'\nThe statute says athletic teams or sports designated for females, women or girls are not open to male students.\nIt adds that 'a statement of a student’s biological sex on the student’s official birth certificate is considered to have correctly stated the student’s biological sex at birth.'\nMore than 20 other states have similarly restrictive laws including Kansas, North Dakota and Wyoming.\nThe district’s superintendent, Peter Licata, maintained that the reassignment was 'not an indication of discipline' and added: 'Again, we want to make sure we do this right, nobody is guilty of anything at this point.'\nTuesday's demonstration came one day after members of staff were moved to 'non-school sites' amid an investigation into a transgender student playing on the girls' volleyball team\nStudents rallied behind their principal, James Cecil (pictured), and four other staffers who were reassigned following 'allegations of improper student participation in sports'\nThe participation of transgender girls and women on girls' and women's public school sports teams is banned under Florida state law\nAt a Tuesday press conference, Licata told reporters there would be 'new processes' for athlete eligibility going forward.\n'We’ll have an extra level of investigation on making sure everyone is eligible for the sport they’re playing, in all aspects, grade level, grades, so forth and so on,' he said.\nBut Campbell expressed concern about her teammate, who has been missing from school.\n'Right now she’s not being treated like a human, she’s not being treated like she’s worth anything to anyone,' Campbell told NBC6.\n'The things people are saying in school and on social media is beyond disgusting. She’s a human and deserves to be treated like one, how about we bring fairness into that? 'Cause she’s not being treated like that right now.'\nThe transgender student appears to be the plaintiff in a June 2021 lawsuit filed against the governor, the School Board of Broward County and other state officials.\nAt the time, the student - identified only by the initials D.N. - was 13 years old and intended to try out for the school’s volleyball team.\n'The Florida legislation that is the subject of this complaint, SB 1028, would prevent D.N. from participating in the sports she loves and decimate her social network,' the suit read, in part.\nSuperintendent Peter Licata said the reassignment was 'not an indication of discipline' and added that 'nobody is guilty of anything at this point'\n'This statute, which is part of a wave of anti-transgender bills across the county, would stigmatize this teenager and separate her from her peers and teammates.'\nA federal judge rejected the suit earlier this month, and Licata claimed he was unaware of its existence when questioned.\nSchool district spokesman John Sullivan issued a statement saying the district was committed to following state law and would take 'appropriate action' following the outcome of the investigation.\n'We are committed to providing all our students with a safe and inclusive learning environment,' Sullivan added.\nThe state Department of Education was adamant in its stance. 'Under Governor DeSantis, boys will never be allowed to play girls’ sports. It’s that simple,' a spokesperson said.\n'As soon as the Department was notified that a biological male was playing on a girls’ team in Broward County, we instructed the district to take immediate action since this is a direct violation of Florida law.'\nThe spokesperson expressed hope that 'those responsible' face 'serious consequences.'\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying",
