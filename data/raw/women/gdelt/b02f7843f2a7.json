In 1876, founder Adolphus Busch set out to create the United States' first truly national beer brand brewed to be universally popular and transcend regional tastes. Today, Budweiser is recognized as the world's second most valuable beer brand in Kantar's BrandZ global 2025 rankings, enjoyed in more than 80 countries and brewed with the same unwavering commitment to quality and consistency. Each batch of Budweiser stays true to the same family recipe used by five generations of Busch family brewmasters. Budweiser is a medium-bodied, flavorful, crisp beer with layers of premium American hop aromas, brewed for the perfect balance of flavor and refreshment. Budweiser is made using time-honored methods including \"kraeusening\" for natural carbonation and Beechwood aging, which results in unparalleled balance and character.\nAbout AB InBev\nAnheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) is a publicly traded company (Euronext: ABI) based in Leuven, Belgium, with secondary listings on the Mexico (MEXBOL: ANB) and South Africa (JSE: ANH) stock exchanges and with American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BUD).
