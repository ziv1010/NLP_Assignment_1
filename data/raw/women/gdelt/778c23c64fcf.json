It will increase costs for consumers in the United States because it is supplied across the board. What it will do is not create any comparative advantage or disadvantage compared with other countries that export into the United States. It is an inappropriate action by the Trump administration.\"\n+++\nThe federal government is being urged again to consider using targeted sanctions against Israel over its actions in blocking aid in Gaza.\nLabor party M-P Ed Husic has been joined by former Labor foreign ministers Gareth Evans and Bob Carr - have called for Australia to join the UK, France and Canada in signalling the use of targeted sanctions, if Israel fails to stop the renewed military offensive and lift all of the restrictions on aid.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has so far rejected the calls, saying he is focused on peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians rather than soundbites.\nMr Husic has also urged the federal government to consider backing Palestinian statehood at a UN conference on a two-state solution to be held in New York later this month [[17-20 June]].\nActivist Reem Borrows, from Palestine Australia Relief and Action, has told SBS Arabic much stronger intervention is needed from the Australian government.\n\"The responsibility is on the globe, Australia included, to finish this with justice, freedom for all. The first step is to stop what is happening in Gaza, that’s the first step, but not only to treat the symptoms. This is what we’ve got be very careful of.\"\n+++\nThe federal opposition is accusing social media giant TikTok of trying to bully Australia on the issue of social media age restrictions.\nThe laws passed during the last federal parliament putting in place a ban for those aged under 16 from using platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok comes into force in December.\nTikTok last week brought four and half pages of national newspaper advertising challenging the government on the issue.\nBut senior opposition frontbencher, James Paterson, has told the Nine Network that TikTok, unlike some other platforms, has no educational value, and kids needs to be protected from some of the content on it.\n\"It's really important that the Prime Minister doesn't back down here. Because TikTok is not a safe place for children. And surely every parent who's seen the effects of these social media platforms would understand and agree with that. There is no educational content on TikTok, and that is not what kids are getting from TikTok- it's a lot of other stuff, frankly, that is not appropriate for them at their age. So, I really hope the Prime Minister shows some strength here, doesn't back down to this attempted bullying campaing from TikTok, and makes sure that children are protected from what is a really harmful platform.\"\n+++\nThe Business Council of Australia has called on the federal government to have a focus on supporting innovation in its strategy to regulate A-I.\nIn a new report, the group warns against over-regulation, saying the country has vast land resources that could be used for data centres for AI.\nThe report says that Australians more than people in many other countries, express nervousness about AI, and that could lead to over-regulation\nThere are no specific laws or regulations that directly regulate AI in Australia.\nThe federal government is considering different reform options to mandate guardrails for AI systems deemed high risk, including introducing a new AI Act.\n+++\nThe New South Wales government is investing more than half a billion dollars in dealing with domestic violence, trying to fix what it says has been years of neglect in regards to the issue.\nThe state budget, to be handed down on the 24th of June, will provide 227 million dollars over five years for the state's victim support service.\nAnother 50 million dollars will be allocated towards measures to make it easier for victim-survivors to give evidence in court, via remote courtrooms, making sure they don't have to attend the same court complex as their alleged abuser.\nA hub will also be built to provide counselling, legal aid, and financial advice to those impacted.\nIt will open in late 2027.\nAnd if you or someone you know needs support.. you can seek 24 hour help through a phone call to 1800 RESPECT.\nThat's 1800 737 732.\n+++\nExit polls released on the second round of Poland's presidential election shows the contest is too close to call.\nOfficial results are due later today [[Mon morning local time]].\nTwo exit polls show the pro-European Warsaw mayor, Rafał Trzaskowski, very marginally ahead of the historian and former amateur boxer Karol Nawrocki.\nThat hasn't stopped Mr Trzaskowski claiming victory in front of cheering supporters in Warsaw.\n(Polish then translated into English): \"This is truly a special moment in Polish history. I am convinced that it will help us all move forward like a torpedo and focus primarily on the future. This is what I was very keen on throughout this campaign, to tell all Polish women and men that I will unite, I will build. I will truly be the president of all Polish women nd men, I will be your president.\"\nMr Nawrocki says it is too early to call the election result, but he believes he will win.\n+++\nIn the United States, multiple people have been injured in an attack in the city of Boulder in northern Colorado.\nWitnesses say a man threw bottles that apparently contained flammable liquid, which hit the ground and exploded in flames.\nA suspect is in custody and police are investigating what FBI officials immediately called a targeted terror attack.\nHowever, local authorities say it is too early to know the motive of the attack.\nStephen Redfearn is the chief of Boulder Police.\n\"When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries... There was group of pro-Israel. People that were there in a peaceful demonstration. I wouldn't even call it a protest. They were there in that area. We're looking and actively interviewing victims and witnesses to determine if that group was targeted or others. And we just don't have those answers yet.\"\n+++\nIn football, Joe Montemurro will be the new coach of the Matildas.\nHe's signed a three year deal to be coach of the national side through the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, a period which will also inlcude the 2026 Asian Cup on home soil, and the 2027 World Cup in Brazil.\nThe 55-year-old Aussie was most recently coach of French side Lyon [[lee-on]].\nHe's previously coached English side Arsenal, Italian side Juventus, and A-League side Melbourne City to women's league titles.\nMontemurro's hiring ends the long search for a successor to Tony Gustavsson, who left after the Olympics last year.\nInterim coach Tom Sermanni will coach tonight's [[mon]] game against Argentina in Canberra.\nMontemurro will take over after that, with his first game in charge being against Slovenia in Perth later this month.",
