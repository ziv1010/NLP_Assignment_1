McClory, an experienced figure in the investment banking world, has acquired a majority stake in Brera Holdings, the first publicly-traded multi-club ownership (“MCO”) company in global football (American soccer).\n“I believe that this strategic move underscores the robust confidence Mr. McClory places in Brera's potential and heralds in a new era of international focus and expansion beyond the Company’s Italian roots,” stated Pierre Galoppi, Brera’s Chief Executive Officer.\nDaniel J.

Dan's principal and advisory deals have spanned North and South America, Europe, Africa and Asia. His teams have ranked in the Top Ten of league tables for placement agents and won “Deal of the Year” at the M&A Advisor Awards.\nDan has completed IPOs and transactions for clients listed on Nasdaq, the NYSE, the London Stock Exchange, Toronto Stock Exchange, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, Euronext Growth, and the Irish Stock Exchange.
