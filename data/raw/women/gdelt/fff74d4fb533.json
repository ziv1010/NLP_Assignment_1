  "body_text": "No matter your sport, it can be hard to tune into every game, especially if you've given up cable. Fortunately, some of the best sports streaming services can help you start watching your favorite teams today, although it's not always easy to figure out which app you need.\nWhether you're into football, basketball, baseball, hockey, soccer, boxing, or something else entirely, we've combed through some of the most popular sports streaming services and identified the very best of the bunch. Our highlights range from three live TV packages that serve as wide-spanning cable alternatives to seven cheaper options that focus on one specific channel or a handful of popular sports. Even if you have cable, some streaming services have exclusive rights to games, so you might still need to sign up for an app to ensure full coverage.\nKeeping in mind a variety of budgets and sports, we've scoured the top streaming services to identify some of the best options for live streaming sports. For each service, we've outlined basic specs, including starting prices, relevant free trial information, and any notable missing channels. Plus, we've highlighted a few add-ons that sports fans might find helpful.\nDirectly below, you can find a cheat sheet of some of the best streaming options for select leagues and sports, although you should consult each app's exact channel lineups in our guide to see which (if not all) games you can stream. Many of these services offer other sports in their lineups as well. For example, DirecTV, Fubo, and Sling have a little bit of everything; we've just highlighted what we've found they excel most at. Most apps have some additional hidden gems. If you're interested in learning more about the ongoing sports streaming debacles or exploring which services will help you watch your favorite leagues, you can scroll down to our FAQ.\nDirecTV\nPreviously known as AT&T TV, DirecTV offers streaming access to a large selection of live channels, including most key networks typically found in traditional cable packages.\n- Massive on-demand catalog\n- Allows add-ons like HBO Max, STARZ, and Paramount+ with Showtime\n- Offerings similar to cable\n- Slightly less intuitive interface and TV guide\n- Signature plans are some of the pricier live TV packages on the market\nIf you're looking for something just like cable but don't want to lock into a contract or have any hardware, DirecTV is a great option. Signature plans start at $89.99 a month and feature more than 90 channels — including ESPN, TNT, and local networks — in the base Entertainment subscription. A helpful thing about DirecTV is that you can get almost every cable channel with an upgrade or add-on, but this also means that it can quickly become one of the priciest live TV streaming packages out there.\nDirecTV's new MySports package makes watching sports even cheaper. The plan, which costs $69.99 a month, carries 20+ key sports networks, including several popular cable channels typically only found in the higher tiers of DirecTV's signature packages. It also includes access to ESPN Unlimited. The only catch comes with the local channels. FOX and NBC are pretty broadly available, but ABC and CBS coverage varies by region (although all signature plans carry those channels).\n- See full plan details on the DirecTV website. Read more in our DirecTV review and DirecTV genre packs explainer.\nFubo\nFubo is the streaming service for sports fans. Its huge library of channels includes regional and international sports leagues, setting it apart from the competition. You can also tack on additional programming to your plan, but it'll cost you extra.\n- Huge library of channels\n- Tons of sports options\n- Different tier subscriptions available for different budgets\n- Some sports channels cost extra\n- Gets costly with each add-on\n- Missing key networks like AMC, TNT, TBS, and CNN\nFubo is a sports fan's best friend when it comes to streaming, especially if you're into football, soccer, golf, women's basketball, or international leagues. It was initially started as a soccer streaming service, but it has morphed into one of the most robust live TV packages out there. Standard Pro plans cost $73.99 a month and offer over 150+ channels right off the bat. From there, fans can get add-ons for additional channel packages. This includes the $9.99 monthly Sports Lite add-on for NBA TV, MLB Network, and the Tennis Channel, among others. All base plans include regional sports options, which come with their own additional monthly fees, so you'll most likely be paying a bit more than the initial price tag. Fubo also recently introduced a cheaper sports-centric plan for $55.99 a month, which is only available in select markets at the moment.\nGiven that it's catered toward sports, the only notable flaw is the omission of TNT and TBS, eliminating a batch of NHL, MLB, and Unrivaled games each season. Otherwise, it is one of the best true cable alternatives out there, given its broad catalog of channels and comprehensive local network coverage (like ABC, FOX, and, notably, CBS), the latter of which is often missing from live TV services. However, an ongoing dispute with NBCUniversal means that all NBCU channels are currently missing from Fubo's lineup. All plans (other than Latino) also unlock access to ESPN Unlimited.\n- See full plan details on the Fubo website. Read more in our Fubo guide.\nSling TV\nSling TV offers some of the best cable channels for $65 or less. There are three different tiers to choose from, plus several sports and entertainment-specific add-ons, but the Orange + Blue combo is the best way to get the most major sports channels. Plus, you can usually get about half off your first month.\n- Multiple affordable base plans to choose from\n- Options with sports or local networks\n- Up to four simultaneous streams\n- Local channels limited to select cities and no option to get CBS\n- Gets pricey with add-ons\nSling TV is one of the more affordable live TV packages, with an adaptable slate of plans that can easily be tailored to your budget and specific sports needs. Sling Orange and Blue, the two base plans, each cost $45.99 a month. Each includes anywhere from around 34-43 channels, with certain options exclusive to each plan (Orange carries several ESPN channels, while Blue has FS1 and the NFL Network). If you combine the two for the Sling Orange + Blue plan, you can find some savings at just $60.99 a month and get the most out of Sling's sports offerings. The Blue and combo plans cost $5 extra in select areas with robust local channel coverage. Sling also recently launched shorter-term (day, weekend, weeklong) passes for its Orange plan, a cheaper 10+ channel Select monthly plan, and prepaid three-month passes for all plans.\nWhere Sling differs from some of its pricier live TV counterparts is in the local channel coverage. A Sling Blue, Sling Select, or Sling Orange + Blue combo plan can provide some local channels (like NBC, ABC, or FOX) in certain regions, but coverage is selective, and Sling is missing CBS altogether. Fortunately, if you live in a region that cannot stream local channels on Sling, the streaming service has a fairly generous offer that will send you a free HD antenna if you prepay for a few months, which should allow you to supplement any major missing local networks.\n- See full plan details on the Sling TV website. Read more in our Sling TV review, Sling TV channel guide, and Sling Orange vs. Blue breakdown.\nESPN\nESPN Unlimited has everything from ESPN Plus, in addition to all that the ESPN linear networks have to offer.\n- The cheapest way to live stream ESPN directly\n- All ESPN networks in one place\n- Still relatively expensive for a standalone streaming service\nAfter years of only offering select content through ESPN+, ESPN has finally launched a way to live stream all of its linear networks in one place — without having to invest in a live TV streaming service. The brand-new ESPN Unlimited carries live programming from ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN3, ESPNU, ESPNews, ESPN Deportes, ESPN on ABC, the SEC Network, the ACC Network, ESPN+ streaming exclusives, and more in the new enhanced ESPN app. Subscriptions cost $29.99 a month for ESPN Unlimited, and the streamer offers several affordable bundling opportunities with services like Disney+, Hulu, and/or NFL Plus or FOX One.\nThere's also a Select tier, which is essentially just ESPN+ with a new name. This version costs $12.99 a month and unlocks exclusives and other select events, although it doesn't carry full network live streams like Unlimited.\n- See full plan details on the ESPN website. Read more in our ESPN streaming service guide.\nParamount+\nParamount Plus offers a huge library of on-demand content from Paramount, CBS, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. The Premium Plan also includes Showtime and live CBS streaming. More importantly, it removes ads from the on-demand streaming library.\n- Huge library of classic TV shows\n- Live NFL and UEFA Champions League games\n- New Paramount films\n- Less original content than the competition\n- Can't watch games on-demand after\nCBS is a fixture in most major sports leagues, so access to the network has become paramount (no pun intended) to the average sports fan's viewing experiences. Enter Paramount+, formerly CBS All Access, which is best known for its on-demand catalog of original CBS broadcast series and several of the latest film releases from Paramount Pictures.\nParamount+ Essential plans cost $7.99 a month, but you should upgrade to Paramount+ Premium for $12.99 a month if you're hoping to tap into CBS and CBS Sports Network live streams (both tiers will see a minor price hike starting January 15, 2026). This will give you access to select NWSL, PGA, WNBA, Big Ten Football, and March Madness coverage. Fortunately, both available Paramount+ plans allow you to live stream the NFL on CBS and the UEFA Champions League. Paramount+ has also scored the rights to show UFC events beginning in 2026, and the platform won't require additional pay-per-view (PPV) fees beyond standard subscription prices to watch the fights.\n- See full plan details on the Paramount+ website. Read more in our Paramount+ guide.\nDAZN\nDAZN is a sports streaming service with live and on-demand content, including exclusive boxing matches. It's also available in a vast amount of countries around the world. Many events require an additional PPV fee, but a base subscription also offers its own slate of content.\n- Lots of boxing, women's football, and international basketball\n- International viewers can watch NFL Game Pass\n- Available in 200+ countries\n- PPV prices are expensive and add up quickly\nDAZN is a truly global sports streaming service, with select coverage available in more than 200 regions. The service carries tons of sports, but it's best known for its PPV boxing events. Subscription prices vary from region to region, but in the US, you can get a subscription for $29.99 monthly for the flexible pass, or $19.99 monthly when you lock in for 12 months. PPV prices are a bit steeper, but they are the only way to watch the big events, with most major fight cards costing around $50 to $80.\nThe service also offers MMA, Esports, and women's football, among other sporting events, although exact offerings are specific to each country, and not all events are available on a global scale. International viewers can also purchase packages like the NFL Game Pass, which offers every regular game of the NFL season, in addition to the Playoffs and Super Bowl.\n- See full plan details on the DAZN website.\nPeacock\nPeacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. The service also carries its own slate of original programming.\n- Affordable ad-supported plan\n- Live news and sporting events\n- Access to new Universal releases\n- Doesn't offer many exclusives\n- Live NBC streaming requires Premium Plus plan\n- Limited 4K selection\nWhile Peacock is often thought of for its catalog of popular NBC sitcoms like The Office and Parks and Recreation, it also offers ample sporting coverage of select events broadcast on NBCUniversal networks, including full Summer and Winter Olympics live streams. Coverage of most major cycling races and golf tournaments can be found here via designated sports streaming hubs. The app also carries select college sporting events from the Big Ten Conference. Most notably, NBC and Peacock snagged the broadcast rights to a slew of NBA games beginning with the 2025-2026 season. Peacock will even show several streaming-exclusive games this season, so even NBA fans with access to NBC will still need the streamer.\nIf you upgrade from Premium ($10.99 a month) to Premium Plus ($16.99 a month), you can live stream NBC 24/7. While you can watch Sunday Night Football and select sports live with either plan, the Premium Plus option will also unlock additional options via the aforementioned NBC live stream. This tier also makes on-demand content ad-free and allows viewers to download select content to watch offline. There's also a new budget Peacock plan, Select, but this option doesn't offer any live sports events.\n- See full plan details on the Peacock website. Read more in our Peacock guide.\nPrime Video\nAmazon Prime Video is a capable, competitive streaming service that's more than just a Prime membership perk. You can also sign up for a stand-alone plan at $9/month.\n- Included with Amazon Prime\n- Offers extra movie rental and purchase options\n- Can add streaming channels\n- Content library is less impressive than the competition\n- Ad-free streaming now costs extra\nLive sports might not be the main draw to Amazon for most people, but the Prime Video platform has become a live TV hub in the past few years, with an emphasis on some top sports. Prime Video is the official home of Thursday Night Football and the 2025 Black Friday Football game. The service also has exclusive rights to several WNBA games on Thursday nights and NWSL games on Friday nights, and other select sporting events. Starting in the 2025-2026 season, Prime Video will also host exclusive NBA games on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. 2025 also marked the start of Prime's NASCAR coverage.\nPrime Video's live streaming options are included in standard Amazon Prime subscriptions, which cost $14.99 a month. You can also just subscribe to Prime Video for $8.99 a month. Select events will be included with a PPV fee, and many of the best sports streaming services allow you to subscribe via an add-on in Prime Video if you'd rather have all of your watch options in one place. The NBA League Pass and WNBA League Pass are available for an extra fee through Prime Video as well.\n- See full plan details on the Prime Video website. Read more in our Prime Video guide.\nApple TV\nApple TV may have a limited lineup compared to the more established services, but it's less expensive than other ad-free services and offers a growing selection of critically acclaimed series you can't stream anywhere else. The service also carries select movies and live sports, including MLS matches and Formula 1 races\n- Competitive ad-free price\n- Movie rental and purchase options\n- Can add streaming channels\n- Doesn't have as many movies and shows as other services\n- Small back catalog of licensed programs that stream for a limited time\nApple's TV streaming counterpart might be best known for its prestige scripted series, but the service has begun to dip its toes into live sports over the past year or two. The crown jewel of Apple TV's sports content is full access to all regular-season (including the Leagues Cup) and playoff MLS games. Fans previously needed to subscribe to the MLS Season Pass separately, but beginning with the 2026 season, all matches are included with a standard Apple TV subscription. An Apple TV subscription will also grant you access to two MLB games every Friday night. As of 2026, Apple TV also has the exclusive rights to show Formula 1 racing in the US.\nAn Apple TV subscription costs $12.99 a month (although you can usually get a few months free if you purchase a new Apple product) or $99 a year.\n- See full plan details on the Apple TV website. Read more in our Apple TV guide.\nHBO Max\nHBO Max's Standard plan includes ad-free on-demand streaming for HBO series, Warner Bros. blockbusters, original HBO Max shows, and much more. Plus, all ad-free subscribers get the B/R Sports Add-on, so they can live stream NBA, NHL, MLB, and more for no extra cost.\n- The free B/R Sports Add-on includes TNT and TBS games\n- Big selection of unscripted content from Discovery Plus\n- Lots of prestige shows and films\n- Included with an HBO cable plan\n- Some shows and movies are being removed with little warning\nHBO's streaming counterpart might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of sports, but the streaming service rolled out a new B/R Sports Add-on last year, bringing live and on-demand sports to the platform. HBO Max offers live streams of games that air on Warner Bros. Discovery channels like TNT and TBS, making it a particularly handy app during the MLB, NHL, NBA, and Unrivaled seasons. The streaming service also live streams select other sports that might not have a broadcast home in the US, including several major global cycling events.\nThe B/R Sports Add-on is available at no extra cost with the ad-free tiers, so sports fans will need to subscribe to Ad-Free for $18.49 a month or Ultimate Ad-Free (4K and other perks) for $22.99 a month. The service also has annual plans, which offer savings to users who commit to a yearlong subscription.\n- See full plan details on the HBO Max website. Read more in our Max guide.\nBest options for NBA live streaming\nNBA fans need a variety of channels to watch weekly games, including various networks from the ESPN/ABC family of channels. The league will no longer air new games on TNT and TBS. Instead, fans will need to get access to NBC, Peacock, and Prime Video. NBA TV is also a necessity for any NBA fan, although this is a bit more of a niche option that falls outside many streaming services' standard base plans. Sling TV and DirecTV are services that will allow you to watch almost everything outside of streaming exclusives (with the help of some add-ons), while streamers like ESPN Unlimited, Peacock, and HBO Max offer select networks and games. Fubo also offers nearly every network you might need for nationally broadcast TV games, outside of NBC. Check out our how to watch NBA games streaming guide for a full breakdown of services.\nBest options for WNBA live streaming\nThe WNBA season is typically spread across a few different families of networks, including ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN3, ABC, CBS, CBS Sports Network, ION, and NBA TV, although NBC, USA, and Peacock will be getting in on the action in the next season. Fans who want to watch absolutely every game will also need to subscribe to Prime Video, which holds exclusive rights to Thursday night games. Sling TV, DirecTV, and Fubo will be able to help you out for the most part, but if you want to live stream every single national broadcast, your best bet is subscribing to one of the higher-tiered DirecTV plans (in addition to signing up for Prime). You can also try out the WNBA League Pass for select coverage. Our where to watch WNBA games guide has additional information.\nBest options for MLB live streaming\nNationally broadcast MLB games air on TBS, Fox Sports 1 (FS1), FOX, ESPN, and the MLB Network. You can find these networks through DirecTV, Sling TV, and Fubo's various plans and add-ons, although TBS will be missing from the latter. You can also try out MLB.TV. TBS games are also usually available on HBO Max, and Apple TV is the exclusive home of two games every Friday night. Our how to watch MLB live streams guide has the full breakdown of national options. Additionally, tons of MLB games air on regional sports networks and don't have national broadcasts. Fubo offers robust regional coverage in both of its main plans, but you can also get the MyHome Team mini pack add-on to DirecTV's MySports.\nBest options for NHL live streaming\nAlthough a decent amount of NHL games fall on regional sports networks, the national broadcasts are mainly found on ABC, ESPN, and TNT. There are also several ESPN+ streaming exclusive games, which are available through ESPN Select and Hulu, meaning that you might need an app even if you have a solid cable subscription. ESPN Unlimited offers full live streams of games on ESPN, ABC, and ESPN+. Sling TV and DirecTV are two of the best ways to ensure you don't miss out on any national broadcasts, but Fubo and HBO Max will also be able to help you out with select games. For more info, you can explore our guide on how to watch NHL games.\nBest options for NFL live streaming\nEach year, NFL games are spread across several different networks, making it all but impossible to keep up with the season unless you have cable or a streaming service like DirecTV. Nationally broadcast games air on NBC, CBS, Fox, ABC, ESPN, and the NFL Network. Additionally, Prime Video exclusively carries Thursday Night Football. If you're only looking to watch NBC games, Peacock will be able to help you out. Similarly, CBS games are available on Paramount Plus. Sling TV is also able to live stream many games, but local channel coverage varies by region (and CBS is unavailable in all areas), so you should check your ZIP code before subscribing. Fubo will be able to help you out with most games outside of those that air on NBC. You can find a full roundup of streaming services in our how to watch NFL games breakdown.\nBest options for combat sports live streaming\nBoxing and UFC are some of the most popular combat sports, and you can find pretty exclusive coverage across two key streamers. Paramount Plus is the only way to stream all UFC events in the US. Both Essential and Premium tiers unlock access to UFC coverage, and some events will also air on CBS. DAZN offers a similar subscription and PPV service for major boxing events, although it's available on a global scale and not confined to just the US.\nFAQ\nWhat's the best sports streaming service?\nThe short answer is that there is no one sure-fire sports streaming service that's going to be the answer to all needs. We ranked ESPN as the \"best for sports\" in our guide to the best streaming services since the service is so tailored towards sports and often carries exclusive streaming-only games that you can't even get with cable.\nThat said, in the ever-complicated era of the streaming wars, the best sports streaming service is going to be the one that carries your favorite team or league's games. Since network licenses and rights are always changing, you can't go wrong with a live TV streaming package like DirecTV, Sling, or Fubo. But gaps in coverage on things like local channels and Warner Bros. networks might make Sling or Fubo not ideal for your needs and instead pave the way for services like DirecTV.\nWhat are skinny sports streaming services?\nThe \"skinny\" package is one of the latest and most enticing trends in sports streaming, but it's also the cause of some of the more recent streaming-related headaches. Streaming services are beginning to launch skinny plans, which cater to specific interests (like sports) by offering things like sports-only channels for a cheaper price than an all-encompassing streaming package.\nIn January 2025, DirecTV was one of the first major players to launch a skinny plan, MySports, which offers 25+ key sports channels for $70 a month, $20 less than DirecTV's base signature plan. Since then, DirecTV has launched a variety of other genre packs, allowing viewers to further tailor their subscriptions to only channels that interest them.\nOther services have followed suit. In Fall 2024, a Disney, Fox, and Warner Bros. Discovery sports streaming service was supposed to launch under the name Venu Sports, but this was halted by a lawsuit from Fubo. The dispute lasted through the 2024-2025 NFL regular season, but Disney announced in January 2025 that Fubo and Hulu + Live TV would merge in business (while staying separate apps), settling litigation on Venu.\nDisney canned plans for Venu Sports, but a new ESPN streaming service launched in August 2025. At the same time, FOX also launched its own all-inclusive stand-alone service, FOX One, where plans start at $19.99 a month. The two services are now available to bundle together.\nIn September 2025, Fubo launched its own skinny sports and broadcast package, Fubo Sports + News, which costs $55.99 a month. Sling has also begun to tinker with its subscription models, launching short-term passes (daylong, weekend-long, and week-long terms) in August 2025. Sling has also launched a pared-down Sling Select plan, which starts at $19.99 a month for 10+ channels.\nWhat are the best services for 4K streaming?\nUltra-high-def streaming is hard to come by, especially for live events, but some services have the option. Your best bet will be with one of the aforementioned live TV streaming packages. Sling TV, DirecTV, and Fubo (through Fubo's Elite plan) all offer select 4K live streaming. These are typically for special events, especially big games, with a network that has 4K streaming capabilities. FOX, which enabled 4K viewing for the Super Bowl in 2025, offers UHD live streaming across all three services when available. ESPN is another popular sports network that occasionally offers programming in 4K. When not in 4K, most of the services stream in 720p or 1080p, depending on whether you're accessing live or on-demand content.\nHulu + Live TV also has 4K streaming, although it appears to just be available for select Hulu on-demand content and not part of the live offerings. HBO Max also has 4K capabilities with its highest Ultimate Ad-Free plan, but this also appears to be exclusive to select on-demand content.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.
