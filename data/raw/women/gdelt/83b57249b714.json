I said, 'Mel, this is your range', so her and Cattley organised that.\n\"Cattley had a great game, and the goal was a bomb. It was a dead-set bomb.\"\nThe free kick was awarded when Cattley was felled by midfielder Josie Morley.\nIt could not have been executed better.\n\"We worked on it for about three seconds before,\" Ayres said.\n\"I don't really like taking free kicks, but, I said if it's touched to the side, it will get around the wall.\n\"It was just spur of the moment, and Cattley did so well just to put it in the right spot.\n\"I didn't really think about it, just hit it after that. But I'm pretty stoked.\"\nThere were question marks over whether Ayres would take the field on Saturday after missing Azzurri's previous three matches due to a calf complaint.\nBut the 26-year-old was deployed at half-time, and broke the game open.\nThere had been few chances in the first half as both defences worked overtime to shut anything and everything down.\nThe biggest opportunity came in the second minute of play, when damaging Azzurri winger Chelsea Lucas had a shot tipped over the crossbar by an outstretched Annabella Thornton.\nBut Ayres was at her probing best in the second half.\nShe put a shot over the crossbar in the 57th minute and skewed a chance wide of the left post in the 68th minute before forcing two diving saves out of Thornton.\nHer efforts earned Ayres the Joey Peters Medal for player of the grand final.\nIt was a special honour after spending time working as a painter with the Matildas legend during her time away from football.\n\"We chatted a lot at work, and she just really helped with feeling OK about my decision to not play,\" Ayres said.\n\"She took me under her wing, and I really appreciate that, so it means a lot to win her medal.\"\nAyres also paid tribute to Azzurri, who helped her get back on the pitch this year.\nThis A-League season, starting October 31, she will back in Jets colours.\n\"Honestly, after last year, I didn't really want to play,\" Ayres said.\n\"I needed a break, and when this season rolled around, Heath and everyone just said, 'Take your time. We're here if you need'.\n\"They've just been so great at working with me, and I appreciate them so much.\n\"We really have built a family, and Heath has had my back in some just hard times and I just really appreciate this club.\"\nMaitland had a couple of half-chances on goal early in the second half, but their best opportunity of the match came late.\nSubstitute Paige Kingston-Hogg had been on the field just two minutes when she got in behind the Azzurri backline to meet Willow Neal's sublime pass into the 18-yard box.\nOnly Danielle Bartels stood between Kingston-Hogg and the goal, and the advancing goalkeeper denied the shot from point-blank range.\nThe win capped a sensational season for Azzurri, who claimed every piece of Northern NSW Football women's silverware on offer.\nThey beat Newcastle Olympic on penalties to secure the Charity Shield in February, defeated Maitland in the League Cup final in May, were declared joint State Cup winners with Maitland in July after the final was abandoned due to injury and pipped the Magpies by one point to seal their first premiership.\n\"On the back of such a great season, it would've been somewhat of an anti-climax to walk away today empty-handed,\" Whyte said.\n\"Everyone wants to win a grand final, but it was super important to us to finish what we'd started.\"\nIt was the seventh time Maitland and Azzurri had battled this year. All were tight affairs, aside from Maitland's 3-0 win in round seven.\nMaitland replaced Thornton in the competition in 2021 and were playing in their first NPLW top-grade grand final.\n\"It's been one heck of a battle all year,\" Maitland captain Sophie Stapleford said before congratulating their counterparts post-match.\n\"What a year you've had. Well done. We made history at Maitland, and we should be proud of that, because I'm proud of that.\"\nMaitland coach Joseph Wright, who is stepping down from the role next season due to personal commitments, reiterated Stapleford's words.\n\"I just said that I was proud of the group and what they'd achieved this season,\" Wright said.\n\"It might not be in trophies, but we were joint winners of the State Cup and then the first-ever grand final for the women's program, there's a lot of things to be proud of and to celebrate.\"\nOlympic beat Maitland 4-2 in the reserve-grade grand final.",
