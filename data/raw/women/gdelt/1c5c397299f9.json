Paralysed for life, heart attacks and even DEATH...the horrifying dangers of trendy treatments revealed - as woman dies from cryotherapy session\n- Doctors in the UK have warned about trying 'trendy' wellness 'hacks'\n- READ MORE: Cryotherapy chamber accident leaves one woman dead and another critical after nitrogen leaks during session\nTikTok is filled to the brim with wellness 'hacks' and trendy therapies, treatments and procedures that promise solutions to all our ailments.\nVideos showing influencers attending bougie cryotherapy sessions are about as common as clips of social media stars documenting their very satisfying 'insane back cracks' at the chiropractor's.\nAnd It-Girls left right and centre have filmed themselves going to saunas to achieve 'better sleep' and a 'boosted immune system.\nElsewhere, activities like cold water swimming have been all the rage, especially following celebrity wellness figures like Wim Hoff emerging.\nBut how safe are these viral practices, which so many swear by?\nDoctors have warned about the dangers of several wellness trends - prompting concerns about risk of heat stroke, injury and other dangerous conditions.\nIn some cases, there have even been fatalities after using the popular treatments.\nThese are the most up and happening practices which experts have cautioned to tackle with safety - and the benefits they claim to offer...\nCRYOTHERAPY\nIn a post promoting the practice of cryotherapy, On Air claimed that it would provide several benefits\nCryotherapy has a very Hollywood following, with celebrities including Jennifer Aniston and Demi Moore counting as devoted supporters.\nJames Bond star Daniel Craig even in past 'bolstered' his fitness training with the technique when he was filming Skyfall; footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has a £500,000 ice chamber at home; and Formula 1 star Lewis Hamilton reportedly has a session after every race.\nThe sports treatment, often used by athletes, is often described as 'tricking' the body into thinking it has hypothermia.\nThis in turn bolsters it into 'fight or flight mode', triggering the release of epinephrine, endorphins and anti-inflammatory proteins.\nAnd while the body is not actually in hypothermia, the brain thinks that it is - so blood rushes to the core. This, in turn, leads to an increase in both metabolism and energy.\nFans claim the treatment increases production of the protein collagen, plumping up your skin and diminishing cellulite, as well as boosting metabolism, burning up to 800 calories a session.\nCryotherapy has a very Hollywood following, with celebrities including Jennifer Aniston and Demi Moore counting as devoted supporters. Pictured, Kristen Bell\nJames Bond star Daniel Craig even in past 'bolstered' his fitness training with the technique when he was filming Skyfall; footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has a £500,000 ice chamber at home; and Formula 1 star Lewis Hamilton reportedly has a session after every race. Pictured: Alessandra Ambrosio\nDespite its recent popularity, cryotherapy dates back to Egyptian times. In their thesis History of Cryotherapy, authors Anatoli Freiman, and Nathaniel Bouganim, of Montreal's McGill University claim Egyptians treated injuries with cold as early as 2500 BC.\nAfter World War II, liquid nitrogen became commercially available and cryotherapy is now used to treat a host of illnesses including cancer.\nToday's whole-body emersion dates back to 1978 when Japanese rheumatologist Toshima Yamaguchi began to treat his patients with rheumatoid arthritis. By 1989 the third cryochamber in the world opened in Poland.\nHowever, it's most recently been in the news following a fatal accident, after cryotherapy session in Paris turned deadly this week, with one woman dying and another hospitalised in critical condition due to a nitrogen leak from a cold chamber, according to French investigators.\nThe tragedy occurred at around 6:20pm on Monday evening at a small sports centre located in the 11th district of the French capital, according to a police source. The centre is understood to be the On Air facility, on Voltaire Boulevard.\nAccording to initial findings, a nitrogen leak from the cryochamber is thought to have caused the poisoning, a source close to the investigation said. An employee of the gym, who was in her late 20s, died.\nA client of the establishment, who is in her 30s, was hospitalised at Lariboisière Hospital, in the city's 10th district, in a critical condition.\nThe England women's football teams secret weapon to success at the World Cup is undergoing cryotherapy sessions (Ella Toone is pictured)\n'An investigation into the cause of death has been launched,' the Paris public prosecutor's office said.\nThree people who were in contact with the victims and provided first aid also received treatment, the police source said.\nThe gym, where 150 people were present when the tragedy struck, was evacuated shortly afterwards.\nA body covered with a white sheet was reportedly carried out of the sports centre.\nScreens were set up to conceal what was happening in front of the door to the gym and along the pavement.\nThe Paris prosecutor's office said on Monday evening: 'An autopsy and toxicological analyses have been ordered to determine the precise cause of death, which is believed to have occurred during a cryotherapy session.'\nOn Air said following the incident that it would be closed on Tuesday, and apologised for the incident.\nIn a post promoting the practice of cryotherapy, On Air claimed that it would provide several benefits, including pain and inflammation relief, accelerated muscle recovery and a stronger immune system.\nNitrogen is a colourless, odourless gas that is commonly used in cryotherapy.\nDuring a session in a walk-in chamber a person is exposed to temperatures below -100° Celsius for a recommended time of no more than three minutes.\nAdvocates say whole body cryotherapy is effective in reducing muscle soreness, stress, rheumatism and various skin conditions.\nBut many experts warn that the treatment has not been proven to be medically sound and are urging further research to determine the short- and long-term effects.\nFrançois Vauglin, Socialist mayor of the 11th arrondissement of Paris, said following the incident: 'It's a stupid accident with terrible consequences. It's infinitely sad. Losing your life for a cryotherapy session is tragic. This type of treatment is not trivial.'\nMailOnline reached out to On Air for comment at the time.\nCryotherapy came under scrutiny in the United States in 2015 after a woman froze to death at a Las Vegas spa.\nThe 24-year-old woman was believed to have entered one of the spa's cold chambers after business hours to relieve some aches, and was discovered the next day by a co-worker.\nElsewhere, in 2019 a 71-year-old suffered a cold burn injury after a cryotherapy session.\nThe unnamed man was used cold therapy to ease his arthritis and back pain.\nBut he developed a blistering rash on his back after a nozzle in the cryo-chamber malfunctioned, causing liquid nitrogen to spray directly onto his skin.\nExperts have since warned that the treatment can be dangerous and there is no proof it boosts muscle recovery.\n'With the rise of cryotherapy facilities and the ease that consumers can be treated, it's important to spread awareness of the harmful side effects,' said Dr Jordan Wang of Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, where the patient was treated.\n'Most consumers are unaware of the potential side effects and the lack of data behind how useful treatments are.'\nA past case report found a 56-year-old man suffered a aortic dissection - tear in the wall of the major artery that carries blood out of the heart - after multiple cryo-chamber sessions.\nAnd a 47-year-old man developed cold panniculitis - inflammation of the fatty layer beneath the skin - after eight sessions.\nFreezing temperatures can also cause water within cells to crystallise, damaging their membranes and proteins. They can also make blood vessels narrow, reducing blood flow.\nAnd a 2015 Cochrane review - which combines high-quality studies to create gold-standard healthcare decisions - found insufficient evidence supporting cyro-chambers boost muscle recovery.\nIn an article, Mayo Clinic has warned that while cryotherapy appears to be effective in helping treat some ailments, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lower back pain - not enough is yet known about it.\n'Cryotherapy is not for everybody,' it reads. 'It's an intense and acute form of intervention. While it may work for some, others may not be able to tolerate it. Notably, humans have a much lower capacity to adapt to prolonged exposure to cold compared with prolonged exposure to heat.\n'Even if cryotherapy sessions are very short, they still may be too extreme for some people... There also may be other negative effects that aren't known yet...\n'The jury is still out. If you’re considering it, make sure to discuss it first with your healthcare team and proceed with caution. Keep in mind too that you don’t have to visit a cryotherapy chamber to get some of the benefits of cold temperatures. A bag of ice remains an effective and inexpensive way to ease the pain of a swollen joint or a sore muscle.'\nHOT SAUNA\nSocial media stars post videos of themselves in the steam rooms, claiming everything from their muscles to their sleep schedules has improved as a result\nHot saunas have for years been lauded by wellness experts - and a new generation of TikTok influencers has been taken in by the trend.\nSocial media stars post videos of themselves in the steam rooms, claiming everything from their muscles to their sleep schedules has improved as a result.\nThe number of UK saunas has increased rapidly from under 100 in 2023 to 147 now – including a 65-seater in Canary Wharf in London and a floating sauna anchored in Princes Dock, Liverpool – according to the British Sauna Society. Home sauna sales are also rising.\nBut safety is key, as it was this month revealed an actress is suing a gym chain owned by fitness giants Sports Direct for up to £100,000 after her mother overheated in a sauna and died.\nMilanka Brooks, who has starred in two episodes of Black Mirror, is seeking damages over the death of her 75-year-old mother Mileva Brooks who died from heatstroke after using the sauna at an Everlast gym in Cheltenham in August 2022.\nThe former model was rushed to hospital when other gym users alerted staff that she had collapsed in the sauna and was experiencing breathing difficulties, a coroner's inquest found.\nShe tragically passed away three days later, with the coroner ruling she 'died from the effects of heatstroke'.\nNow the actress, 41, is suing the owner of the Everlast gym chain, SportsDirect.Com Fitness Ltd, at London's High Court, seeking up to £100,000 in compensation over her mother's death.\nAccording to legal documents, Ms Brooks is claiming 'damages in excess of £50,000, but limited to £100,000' in her role as administrator of her mother's estate for 'personal injury and consequential losses' and under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976.\nThe defence of SportsDirect.Com Fitness Ltd was not available from the court at the time of writing.\nThe actress has often spoken of her and her mother's close relationship, with posts on social media calling her 'the light and inspiration of my life,' her 'partner in crime' and 'best friend in the world'.\nRoland Wooderson, assistant coroner for Gloucestershire, recorded a narrative verdict after an inquest in 2023.\nHe said: 'Mileva was found unresponsive in the sauna of the gym on August 26 last year.\n'An ambulance was called and she was taken to hospital where she later died three days later on August 29.\n'The post-mortem cause of death is noted that she died from the effects of heat stroke.'\nHe had earlier heard medical evidence that Mileva's body temperature was 39.2 degrees centigrade when it was measured by paramedics who attended the scene.\nMailOnline approached Frasers Group, the owner of the Everlast and SportsDirect.Com brands, for comment at the time.\nIn January, doctors issued a warning about spending too long in saunas without proper hydration.\nExperts, in a British Medical Journal case report cautioned that this may 'put bathers at risk of heat stroke, particularly if they haven’t drunk enough water beforehand'.\nThe doctors referenced a case where a woman in her early 70s was treated for the condition, after she was found 'unconscious in her local gym’s sauna, where she had been doing stretching exercises for around 45 minutes'.\n'Her core body temperature was 42°C—normal temperature is 36.4°C—her blood pressure was extremely low, and her heart rate was extremely high. She had a seizure after her arrival in emergency care.\n'She had previously been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and an underactive thyroid, but she wasn’t a smoker or heavy drinker, and was a regular gym goer, so had few risk factors, point out the authors.'\nThe woman eventually regained consciousness after being treated, but blood tests revealed 'malfunctioning kidneys and liver, evidence of a minor heart attack, and muscle tissue breakdown (rhabdomyolysis)'.\n'This is just one case report after prolonged sauna use, and as far as the authors are aware, only 9 other similar cases have been reported,' the BMJ Group warned. 'But 3 of those people died as a result.'\nHowever, there has also been research on the benefits of saunas.\nWhile investigating the health benefits of the trend is hardly a new field of study (papers on this date back to 1765), recent literature has shown it can also aid pain relief, lower blood pressure and improve mood.\nFor example, experts in Sweden surveyed more than 1,000 people, 66 per cent of whom used a sauna at least once a month and found regular users were happier, had more energy, were less likely to have high blood pressure or pain and slept better, compared with non-sauna users, reported the International Journal of Circumpolar Health last November.\nThis echoes previous research by the University of Eastern Finland, published in 2018, which found that men who used saunas four to seven times a week had a 60 per cent reduced risk of stroke compared with those who had a weekly sauna.\nTheir risk of heart and circulatory diseases – as well as dementia – was also 50 per cent lower.\n'The effects of being in a sauna appear to mimic some of the benefits you get from a workout,' says Dr Tom Cullen, an associate professor of research in applied physiology at Coventry University.\n'You begin to sweat, your core body temperature rises, your heart rate goes up, blood vessels dilate, and blood flow increases, raising levels of nitric oxide [all this can happen without you noticing], which we think is important for blood pressure regulation and reducing arterial stiffness,' explains Dr Cullen, who previously led a review of studies into the effects of saunas.\nSpending time in a sauna is like a 'workout for your cardiovascular system similar to exercise', agrees Dr Oliver Guttmann, a consultant cardiologist at the private HCA Wellington Hospital in London.\n'What we know is that people who use saunas for prolonged periods of time [regularly over years] have lower blood pressure, increased cardiac health and lower stress levels.'\nThis, he says, is partly due to the release of hormones which reduce stress and inflammation.\nBeyond cardiovascular health regular sauna use may have some protective effects on the brain. A 2020 review by the University of California suggested that it could be linked to a reduced risk of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's, that lead to the death of brain cells.\n'This may be because exposure to heat can help improve blood flow within the brain and activate processes that protect against proteins sticking together,' says Claire Bale, associate director of research at the charity Parkinson's UK.\nCHIROPRACTORS\nReferencing a video by another practitioner, Trevor Zierke on TikTok showed a clip in which a woman's neck is worked on with a brace-like strap which pulls on it\nThe chiropractor, pictured, said that the neck pull was 'one of the most dangerous things a chiropractor can do to you'\nSocial media is full of countless clips that show chiropractors performing what looks like wizardry as they 'crack' your back - and seemingly 'fix' decades-worth of back pain, migraines and neck soreness.\nThrough the hands-on manipulation of the spine and surrounding bones, muscles and soft tissue, they promise easing of common aches.\nSome go further, touting it as a treatment for everything from asthma and allergies to infant colic.\nThere are more than 3,800 chiropractors registered in the UK and 15 per cent of American adults visit one every year.\nBut while chiropractic treatment boasts an army of ardent supporters, a string of high-profile cases have highlighted the potentially serious – and even life-threatening – risks.\nAmong the most vocal critics is Professor Edzard Ernst, emeritus professor of complementary medicine at the Peninsula Medical School, University of Exeter, and author of Chiropractic: Not All It's Cracked Up To Be.\n'My advice would be to avoid chiropractors,' he said, explaining that the 'risks outweigh the benefits'.\nBroken bones, stroke, and even death are some of the rare but devastating consequences that can result from chiropractic, which is classed as a 'complementary and alternative medicine' by the NHS.\nEven successful treatments are not without their side effects. UK-based industry body The Royal College of Chiropractors estimates that up to 50 per cent of patients experience 'mild or moderate adverse effects after manual therapy, such as soreness or stiffness'.\nThe treatment recently made headlines after a coroner returned a verdict in the death of Joanna Kowalczyk, 29, who suffered a fatal tear of her blood vessels after having her neck 'adjusted' by a chiropractor.\nMs Kowalczyk, of Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, sought out the alternative treatment after injuring herself during a PT session. She had initially attended A&E but later discharged herself from hospital.\nCoroner Leila Benyounes raised concerns that chiropractors are not required to request medical records before assessing a patient and called on the General Chiropractic Council, the UK's independent statutory body, to introduce new rules.\nMs Kowalczyk's medical history showed she regularly suffered migraines and joint hypermobility issues, the inquest heard.\nThe mother-of-one also had an undiagnosed connective tissue disorder which made her susceptible to arterial dissections, one of the most serious chiropractic injuries, in which the blood vessels that supply blood from the heart to the brain are torn.\nIt is thought Ms Kowalczyk suffered an arterial dissection when she injured her neck in the gym and that she suffered acute dissections to the same location when the chiropractor manipulated her neck. She later died in hospital.\nIn response to the coroner's comments, the General Chiropractic Council said in a statement that it expects 'chiropractors to provide good quality care that is patient-centred, safe and effective' and that it will give careful consideration to the 'important concerns raised by the coroner in her report'.\nThe death of Ms Kowalczyk is tragic but not unprecedented.\nIn 2016 American Playboy model Katie May died after experiencing a stroke caused by an artery that ruptured during a neck manipulation by a chiropractor.\nIn 2022, American graduate student Caitlin Jensen suffered a stroke and cardiac arrest when four blood vessels were torn during a chiropractic appointment. The right side of her body was paralysed.\nThere are also risks to the mechanics of the body: in 2017 John Lawler, 80, of York, died after his neck was broken and he suffered 'irreversible' spinal damage which left him a quadriplegic.\nDespite these well-documented case studies, the risks posed by chiropractic are difficult to quantify.\nProfessor Ernst said the lack of formal reporting procedures means it's impossible to quantify exactly how many injuries there are.\n'As there is no post-marketing surveillance, like in conventional medicine, nobody knows how frequent serious complications after chiropractic treatments truly are,' he explained. 'Chiropractors, of course, claim they are extreme rarities, but I very much doubt it.'\nAccording to one estimate, an arterial dissection occurs in one out of 1,000 neck manipulations.\nAnother authored by chiropractors puts the figure at one in 5.8 million. The Royal College of Chiropractors notes that 'cases of serious adverse events, including spinal or neurological problems and strokes caused by damage to arteries in the neck' are 'rare' with estimates ranging from 'one in 2 million manipulations to 13 per 10,000 patients'.\nThe NHS describes chiropractic as 'generally safe when performed correctly by a trained and registered chiropractor'.\nAn arterial dissection, like the one suffered by Ms Kowalczyk, is among the most serious injuries a patient can sustain. A dissection can occur during manipulation of the neck, which is more susceptible to injury than the lower spine.\n'The neck contains the arteries that supply the brain,' explained Professor Ernst, who specialises in subjecting alternative medicines to thorough scientific scrutiny.\n'Since the neck is so very movable in all directions, chiropractic manipulations can over-stretch an artery; this can then cause a blood clot to develop, and if the clot shoots along the bloodstream into the brain, we have a stroke.'\nSymptoms of an arterial dissection include headaches, dizziness and vertigo. In the least severe cases, a patient might be unaware that any damage has occurred and will heal without medical intervention.\nHowever, they can also lead to a stroke or even death. The potential for life-threatening damage means some chiropractors refuse to perform significant manipulations of the neck.\nIn online material, The Royal College of Chiropractors notes the profession is most closely associated with the treatment of 'low back pain'.\nMany chiropractors also dispute the claim that their treatments can cause such significant harm.\nThe Royal College of Chiropractors, which was incorporated in 2012 to 'to promote quality, safety and professionalism', points to research that suggests the 'risk of stroke has been found to be similar after seeing a primary care physician'.\nThe NHS recommends patients should notify their GP before booking an appointment with a chiropractor. Treatment is rarely available on the NHS.\nProfessor Ernst urged patients to consider seeking alternative treatment options.\n'The benefits of neck manipulations are either minor or even non-existent, while risks are clearly real,' he said. 'It follows unquestionably that the risks outweigh the benefits.'\nElsewhere, some chiropractors have themselves warned people about going to trusted professional who follow best practice.\nReferencing a video by another practitioner, Trevor Zierke on TikTok showed a clip in which a woman's neck is worked on with a brace-like strap which pulls on it.\n'That's one of the most dangerous things a chiropractor can do to you,' he explained. 'When I talked about it last time, people kept asking if we learned that adjustment in school and the answer is no...\n'And the reason we aren't taught that is because it's not practical. You're doing what we call long axis distraction, which is just a really fancy name for just pulling something.\n'Long story short - in the next, that's pointless. Sure you hear lots of pops and that's why people usually have that crazy reaction. But you know, there's some pretty important stuff here in your neck that you probably don't want pulled on - one of those being your vertebral artery.\n'That's the artery that runs up to the brain and supplies blood to the brain. And if that bad boy gets severed, that's when you lose oxygen to your brain and you can have a stroke.'\nHYROX\nAshley Whelan, 37, pictured competing in a Hyrox competition. The event sees fitness fanatics complete a gruelling workout regime against the clock; while also providing the perfect backdrop for influencers to take selfies for social media\nIt's the new in workout event for chiselled twentysomethings across the globe, but beneath the glamour and high-octane excitement of Hyrox, there may be a dangerous reality.\nThe event sees fitness fanatics complete a gruelling workout regime against the clock; while also providing the perfect backdrop for influencers to take selfies for social media.\nHyrox combines running and functional workout stations, where participants, including celebrity clientele like Zoe Hague and Love Island's Molly Smith, run 1km, followed by a functional workout station, repeated eight times.\nThe competition, which launched in Germany in 2017, bills itself as the fastest-growing of its kind in the world, with events now spanning across 11 countries, including the UK, America, and Shanghai.\nBut despite building up an army of formidable spandex clad supporters raving about the fitness cult, a glamorous marketing campaign, and thousands of TikToks filmed at the event, there is an unspoken and potentially fatal downside.\nAttendees have suffered from heart attacks, seizures, and panic attacks during or shortly after taking part - but, as such medical emergencies don't make for appealing social media content, they are often glossed over in TikTok clips and Instagram reels. As such, many are totally unaware of the potentially harmful consequences.\nThe race takes place inside an expansive hall, where spectators can observe those competing - and it is a competitive sport, with global leaderboards totting up results for World Championships at the end of each race season.\nIt's branded for everybody, or more specifically as a 'race for every body' - supposedly accommodating people at all levels, from professional athletes to everyday people looking to improve their fitness abilities.\nHyrox has attracted over 90,000 athletes, according to its website, but the glamorous racecourse comes with possible health risks. (Pictured: Andy Whelan who suffered a heart attack at Hyrox Manchester)\n'[Hyrox is] designed to accommodate all participants and 99 per cent of our athletes reach the finish line,' the website reads.\nProspective participants can complete a questionnaire to determine the Hyrox race that will be the best fit for them, with questions asking basics, such as the distance one feels comfortable running.\nThe answers lead to a race recommendation, suggesting one of the four options - open, which is a standard race, pro - for the experience racer, doubles, which allows partakers to split the task in two, or the relay team, dividing the task in four.\nCase studies on the website further reinforce Hyrox's 'accessible' pillar, for instance, 'Marcus Ellwell, a 40-year-old father of three, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in May 2021.\n'After undergoing emergency surgery to remove the tumour, Marcus had lost the ability to even lift a spoon to his mouth and faced life in a wheelchair. Despite the devastating diagnosis, Marcus determinedly taught himself to walk again, and in October 2022, competed in Men's Doubles at HYROX Birmingham.\n'Marcus entered Hyrox to have a goal to look forward to and work towards during his ongoing battle. Since his race, he has now found a new sport, a new community and a new passion.'\nThere's no doubt that Marcus' story is inspirational and impressive, but others warn of a different experience.\nFitness fanatic Ashley Whelan suffered a heart attack moments after completing his first Hyrox event, after mistaking his symptoms for 'race day nerves'.\nLara Bardelli (pictured) had a panic attack when completing a Hyrox course in Glasgow, despite being 'well trained'\nThe avid gym-goer, 37, had been training for months to compete in the fitness phenomenon in November last year.\nHe had been interested in fitness since his late teens, competing in Muay Thai boxing events in recent years, and was excited to challenge himself further with the competition.\nHowever, on race day the site manager said he 'didn't feel right' but put the strange feeling down to 'race day nerves' because it was his first Hyrox.\nAshley, who lives in Manchester, grew more concerned when his heart race sky-rocketed to 220 bpm while completing his last lap.\nAfter finishing the race, he began experiencing sharp pains across his chest, arms and back, prompting him to be checked over by the on-site paramedics.\nHowever, an ECG test revealed that Ashley was in the middle of a heart attack and required urgent care.\nAshley was rushed to hospital where doctors discovered a blockage in his left coronary artery - and were forced to shock him with a defibrillator when his heart began beating irregularly.\nLuckily, he made a full recovery, but Ashley is now warning others about the importance of listening to your body.\nLove Island's Molly Smith (pictured) shared a glamorous photograph of herself during a Hyrox event\nAshley said: 'My friend actually put me forward for Hyrox and asked if I wanted to do it with him and I said absolutely.\n'I felt good in the lead up to it, training was really good and I felt really fit. My friend actually went to Thailand so I ended up doing it solo.\n'On the day of it, I was a little bit nervous to do the race. I started doing the race and there was some intuition that something in the background of myself wasn't quite right but I put it down to race-day nerves.\n'The way that I've trained my mindset through fighting is to ignore the inner voice telling you to stop.\n'I was pushing myself but not pushing as hard as I could've been. It was only on the last lap when I looked down at my watch and my heart rate had gone up to 220 bpm.\n'My max heart rate I'd had was 190 bpm and I'd only peaked at that once or twice during training.\n'Seeing my heart rate was that high, I knew something wasn't right and slowed down the pace. It started coming down slowly. I was running at half the pace.'\nAfter finishing the race, Ashley started to feel more and more restless and decided to seek medical help after he experienced pain down his chest, back, and arms.\nTikTok influencer Emily (pictured) warned her followers that the Hyrox aftermath is 'not for the faint hearted'\nAshley said: 'I told them about the pains in my chest and they put me on an ECG where they confirmed I was having a heart attack.\n'I was in disbelief. I knew I had to be calm because there was no point in panicking.\n'The pain was like a ball of fire in my chest trying to break through my ribcage.'\nAshley was rushed to Wythenshawe Hospital where an angiogram revealed a blockage in his left coronary artery.\nHowever, when doctors noticed Ashley's heart was beating irregularly, they feared he may go into cardiac arrest and decided to shock him with a defibrillator.\nAshley was hospitalised for five days and placed on blood-thinner medication to help eradicate the clots caused by an arterial tear.\nAshley said: '[Being shocked] was horrible. It was like running straight into a brick wall at 30mph. It was that sort of feeling.\n'It was instant pain but the pain from my chest dissipated instantly. It removed one of the clots that had been there.\n'They told me I'm very lucky, it kills people that type of heart attack. I'm very thankful for the team at Hyrox that were very quick with their actions.\n'It's still up in the air as to why I got this clot but when I've looked into it, [and] deep emotional stress and high-intensity exercise can cause it.\n'I was intensely working out six days a week, working nine or ten hours a day and working on my house at the weekend. I think I was burning the candle at both ends.\n'I look back and think I'm so lucky to be alive. I put it down to the strength of my mind and body to pull me through that.\n'I'm living proof that it can happen to ultra-fit people as well. It's a case of listening to your body.\nHe concluded: 'The mentality of powering through all the time isn't always the way to be.'\nMailOnline contacted Hyrox for comment at the time.\nElsewhere, a US-based gym coach, Adam Redmond, took to Instagram to reflect on a similarly traumatic experience.\nAlongside an image of himself in a hospital bed, Adam wrote: 'Well this was a fun day! Made it halfway through my Hyrox race and then started to have some chest pain and shortness of breath.\n'Had to hold on to the barrier because my vision went hazy. This wasn't me just being gassed after a station. Something was wrong!\n'I had to see the medics on site. An EKG was done and I was having a STEMI. That's a ST Elevation Myocardial infarction. A very life threatening type of heart attack.\n'I was immediately taken to hospital where I had a PCI done with a stent placed. My right coronary artery was blocked but the outstanding surgeon cleared it and the pain was gone immediately.\n'Now, I am staying for a few days for observation. Hopefully no complications and I can get back to Japan and the family.\n'Not going to lie. I was scared...very scared. I knew exactly what was happening to me, what was being done and the complications that could happen.\nThere was a small part of me that was like ''am I going to die on this bed in Taipei without my family near to say goodbye?'' Luckily, God willing, I will be home in a few days.\nAdam concluded the post, writing: 'Don't take life for granted. Don't put things off that you can do today. Do tell your friends and family you love them.'\nThough Adam had a severe reaction, other racegoers have attempted to break the taboo on the general physical and mental weaknesses experienced after taking part in Hyrox.\nFor example, TikTok content creator Lara Lucia Bardelli took to the platform to inform her followers of her 'Hyrox race day horror' in Glasgow.\nTo give context on her 'unfiltered race experience', Lara said she was 'well trained' and had a nutritional diet, 'I was prepared to do this right,' she added.\nLara continued: 'So when you enter the room, it's very busy...the whole room is a mess… everything is going on, there's music, everyone's running in all different directions, it's wild.'\n'Now I'm a powerful girl, I prefer pushing 100 kilos over running a kilometre right, so I do this big man push, and I'm walking to the end like ''I do not feel good'', nothing behind those eyes, white as a sheep... and I was like ''I'm going to be sick''.\n'They obviously got the paramedics over, it was too late, I was sick in front of everyone.'\n'I felt better, but I refuse to be taken off the course because I was like ''I'm going to finish this race'... I had to sign a medical form.'\nShe added: 'I continued running throughout the entire rest of the race; I had a paramedic team follow me from one end of the room to the other... so I was just famous at that point.\n'I had to do breathing exercises in the middle of the race with my best friend... so I was stopped in total for about 20 minutes either on the floor breathing or being sick.\n'All in all, we discovered that I actually had a panic attack throughout the whole day'.\nLara added that after the race, she posted a glamorous selfie at the event, meaning spectators would have been clueless about her negative experience, 'I look fabulous [but] that girl was just recovering from a panic attack, does she look like that? No. That's Instagram for you.'\nOnline coach Emily, who goes by @emilyjadefit on TikTok, also shared a dose of Hyrox reality on the platform, saying: 'Everyone told me about the Hyrox high, oh my god was I floating way up in the sky on the Sunday and on Monday, feeling one hundred out of ten.\n'No one told me about the rest of the week. I have felt so low, in a slump, demotivated, not wanting to do a thing, and I just want to let everyone out there know that Hyrox is the best thing I ever did, I was absolutely so proud of myself.\n'[But]….because no one else is talking about it, I'm guilty of it myself, I'm like ''best day ever'', but actually, as a reality, I have not felt good this week post-race.'\nWhile it's clear that Hyrox is an impressive set up fulfilling thousands across the globe, potential health and safety precautions and aftercare are a facet perhaps requiring additional attention.\nCOLD WATER SWIMMING\nActivities like cold water swimming have been all the rage, especially following celebrity wellness figures like Wim Hoff emerging\nIt's the trendy health kick that's been making a splash in the UK for years now. But doctors have been vigilant in warning anyone taking up cold water swimming to be wary of deadly hidden dangers\nThe cold temperatures can trigger a potentially fatal condition of fluid on the lungs, especially when swimming long distances, researchers found\nIt's the trendy health kick that's been making a splash in the UK for years now.\nBut doctors have been vigilant in warning anyone taking up cold water swimming to be wary of deadly hidden dangers.\nThe cold temperatures can trigger a potentially fatal condition of fluid on the lungs, especially when swimming long distances, researchers found.\nPulmonary oedema – where excess fluid collects in the air sacs of the lungs – can cause difficulty breathing and needs urgent hospital treatment, with the added risk of drowning when swimming.\nExperts say it is not clear what causes the condition but is likely to include both an increase in pressure and exaggerated constriction in the blood vessels that supply the lungs, caused by the cold temperatures and increased blood flow during physical exertion.\nOlder women or those with high blood pressure and pre-existing heart disease are at particular risk but the condition although it 'frequently' occurs in those who are otherwise fit and healthy, they found.\nOpen water swimming has become very popular, with more than 3million enthusiasts in England in 2021 alone.\nIt typically involves swimming outdoors in rivers, lakes or the sea, where temperatures are usually lower than in swimming pools - a typical swimming pool temperature is between 26C and 28C (79F and 82F).\nWriting in the journal BMJ case reports, Dr James Oldman, of the Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust, said there was no formal national medical guidelines concerning the recognition and management of this complex condition.\nHe referenced the case of a woman in her 50s who was a keen competitive long distance swimmer and triathlete.\nOtherwise fit and well, she was struggling to breathe and coughing up blood after taking part in an open water swimming event at night in water temperatures of around 17C while wearing a wetsuit. Her symptoms started after swimming 300 metres.\nShe had no medical history of note, but experienced breathing difficulties during an open water swim a fortnight earlier which had forced her to abandon the event and left her feeling breathless for some days afterwards.\nOn arrival at hospital, her heartbeat was rapid, and a chest x-ray revealed pulmonary oedema. Further scans revealed that fluid had infiltrated the heart muscle, a sign of strain known as myocardial oedema, but she had no structural heart disease.\nHer symptoms settled within two hours of arrival at hospital and after careful monitoring, she was discharged the following morning.\nAlthough little research has been conducted into its occurrence in wild swimming, up to a fifth (22 per cent) of scuba divers who suffered from the condition have previously reported a recurrence.\nDoctors advise swimming at a slower pace, accompanied, in warmer water, without a tight-fitting wetsuit, and avoidance of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen, to minimise the risk.\nAnyone who experiences symptoms should stop swimming and getting out of the water straight away, sit upright, and call for medical assistance if required.",
