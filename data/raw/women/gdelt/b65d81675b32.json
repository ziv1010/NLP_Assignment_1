  "body_text": "These are the faces of 516 Merseyside criminals who were jailed during 2022\nThe law courts remained as busy as ever last year despite long-running barrister strikes\nAs was the case in many fields, 2022 was a turbulent year within the criminal justice system.\nLong-running strikes by barristers saw court cases delayed by weeks and even months before the dispute was ultimately resolved. Despite this, there was still plenty of activity in Merseyside's courtrooms.\nWhether at Liverpool Crown Court, Liverpool Magistrates' Court, those of Wirral or Sefton or further afield, hundreds of crooks were brought into the dock again last year. And these are the faces of 516 criminals who were led down to the cells after being jailed by judges during 2022.\nREAD MORE: Encro hack hits heavy drug gangs rooted in Croxteth, Huyton and West Derby\nLeon Clark\nThe paedophile's cover story was busted when police heard the ringtone of the mobile he pretended he'd sold.\nThe 46-year-old lied that he no longer owned the device that investigators had linked to his Wirral home in June of last year. But officers found the phone behind his radiator, which led to the discovery of 58 images of children being sexually abused.\nClark, of Lingdale Road North in Birkenhead, admitted one count of possessing and three counts of downloading indecent images of children. The predator - previously jailed for sexually assaulting a girl - also admitted breaching a suspended sentence for failing to comply with sex offender requirements and was jailed for 18 months.\nMichael McLoughlin\nMichael McLoughlin killed aspiring firefighter Duncan Browne in an unprovoked attack over a taxi.\nHe delivered a fatal \"catastrophic injury punch\" to the 23-year-old at a taxi rank in Hanover Street in Liverpool city centre. McLoughlin's friend - convicted heroin dealer Terrence Kerwin - first hit the victim, as they tried to get into a black cab ahead of him.\nBut after McLoughlin knocked out Mr Browne in the early hours of Sunday, July 4, 2021, the \"cowards\" got in the taxi and went to a party. Mr Browne, from Kirkby, died in hospital next day, surrounded by his family.\nMcLoughlin, 36, of Torus Road, Old Swan, and Kerwin, 31, of no fixed address, both denied murder and were set to stand trial on January 4. But the Crown Prosecution Service accepted McLoughlin's plea to manslaughter and Kerwin's plea to assault causing actual bodily harm, to the dismay and anger of Duncan's grieving family, who slammed the decision.\nMcLoughlin - a convicted armed robber - was jailed for nine years and four months, of which he must serve two thirds behind bars. Kerwin was handed 10 months in jail, but had already spent nearly six months in custody, meaning he was immediately released.\nMichael Morson\nDog breeder Michael Morson had a special space installed below kennels in his van to stash cocaine and heroin.\nHe used his business as a cover while involved in a scheme that saw him move a total of 10 kilos of cocaine and four kilos of heroin. Police found Morson with £25,000 in cash, two Rolex watches, designer clothes and 25kg of cannabis when they arrested him in 2021.\nA judge said Morson was involved in dealing \"on an almost industrial scale\". The 32-year-old used the handle \"LuckySea\" on the encrypted phone network EncroChat.\nMorson, of Paxton Road, Huyton, who admitted conspiring to supply cocaine, heroin and cannabis, was jailed for eight years and seven months.\nNathan Creighton\nNathan Creighton brandished a 'gun' in a Snapchat video while threatening his former girlfriend.\nHe told his ex, who the ECHO chose not to name, \"I've got this for yous\" and also filmed himself saying: \"If you think I’m f***ing about.\" A court was told while it was not known whether the gun was real, his victim was very frightened of the \"serial abusive domestic perpetrator\".\nThe yob, who was previously abusive to his ex after their four-month relationship ended, was also violent to police after his arrest in November. Creighton, 28, formerly of Manor Lane, Liscard, Wallasey, admitted possessing an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and was jailed for 18 months.\nPaul Kemp\nA paedophile who failed to tell police where he was staying claimed he was sleeping under a hedge and had no idea what day it was.\nPaul Kemp was spared jail in November 2021 after offering to pay two 14-year-old boys £20 if he could touch their penises in McDonald's. Kemp, who admitted two counts of attempting to cause a boy to engage in sexual activity, was handed a nine-month suspended prison sentence.\nThe 64-year-old had to regularly update police of his whereabouts as a result of being on the sex offenders register', but soon went missing. He failed to attend a police station and a probation appointment, before he was found at the Mercure Hotel in Little Sutton, Ellesmere Port on December 3.\nKemp, of no fixed address, admitted breaching notification requirements and his suspended sentence. He was jailed for 12 months in January.\nNicholas Whitcombe\nGym owner Nicholas Whitcombe's drug smuggling plot was busted when police found texts from him telling an associate how to 'clean' dirty cash.\nWhitcombe, who was fined for refusing to close his Body Tech Fitness site in Moreton during lockdown, was described by a judge as a \"professional drug dealer\". His role in the cannabis trafficking and money laundering scheme was exposed through an investigation by Jersey's customs and immigration department.\nWhitcombe, 31, from Birkenhead, worked with Jersey-based Anthony Dryden, 31, in a plot valued at more than £54,000, between 2018 and 2019. He sourced the drugs, which were sent to Jersey, collected and sold by Dryden, who then posted the cash back to UK addresses, provided by Whitcombe.\nBoth men were jailed for three years.\nIan Robinson\nIan Robinson stabbed a man just months before knocking his own ex-girlfriend's tooth out and breaking her cheekbone.\nRobinson, 33, and his former partner, Kylie Gaffney, had confronted a mum at their children's school over claims she was spreading rumours. The woman's partner William McIntyre told them to leave her alone, but the two couples came across each other in Poulsom Drive, Bootle.\nDuring an argument Robinson stabbed Mr McIntyre in the chest, inflicting a wound requiring four stitches, and inflicted a small puncture wound to the elbow. While under investigation for that attack, and having split up with Miss Gaffney, Robinson stayed over at the home she shared with their three children.\nWhen she confronted him over texts from another woman, Robinson, of no fixed address but from Netherton, punched and kicked her in the face and head. He admitted two counts of assault causing actual bodily harm and possessing a bladed article and was jailed for three years.\nCarl Sullivan\nCarl Sullivan threatened to kill his neighbour as he brandished an imitation gun and knife at him after the man parked outside his home.\nThe 35-year-old, who was high on drink and drugs, began shouting at the innocent driver, Florin Niga, from his window to move his vehicle. When he asked why, Sullivan was insistent, so the victim moved his car to the other side of the street, before Sullivan shouted: \"Come in here.\"\nMr Niga declined but Sullivan said \"if you are not going to come then I will kill you\" while pointing a gun at the victim's head and holding a knife. The drunken thug pursued the victim into the road with the air pistol and blade, in Suez Street, Warrington, at around 3.30am, on October 9 2021.\nSullivan later admitted possessing an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, possessing a knife and possessing cannabis. He was jailed for 12 months.\nLuke Browne\nLuke Browne pulled a machete from his trousers when he was refused entry to a nightclub.\nThe 31-year-old has plagued pubs, bars and nightclubs across Birkenhead with violent and anti-social behaviour. A court heard this has included Browne and gangs of masked youths \"intimidating\" staff and customers.\nHe was previously spared jail after he hurled a metal beer keg at the head of Elsa Frost, aka internet personality 'Banter Dancing Queen', at Mr Whites sports bar. But last October 25 the yob - who has 60 previous convictions for a staggering 106 offences - tried to get into Platinum Bar with a machete, at around 2.40am.\nBrowne, of Paterson Street, Birkenhead, admitted possessing a bladed article and breaching a suspended sentence. He was jailed for two years.\nAnthony Lonergan\nTaxi driver Anthony Lonergan used private hire vehicles as a cover for cocaine, cannabis and ketamine handovers.\nLonergan traded 76kg of cannabis, 3.8kg of cocaine and 3kg of ketamine between March 2020 and June 2020 alone on EncroChat. But the private hire driver was busted as a result of the EncroChat hack and revealed as the man behind the handle \"PalacePuma\".\nDetectives were able to nail him thanks to other dealers talking about his day job and Lonergan chatting about a holiday he'd booked to Ibiza. Thanks to notes on his phone, they discovered he had actually been trading drugs since November 2019 and selling them on a \"graft\" phone.\nThe 25-year-old, of Lewis Walk, Kirkby, admitted conspiracies to supply cocaine, cannabis, cannabis resin and ketamine. He was jailed for nine years and four months.\nCharlie Meadows\nCharlie Meadows stabbed and battered a taxi driver after trying to avoid paying his fare.\nHe left his victim John Gunning with stab wounds to his shoulder after the assault on Ennismore Road in Old Swan on June 17 last year. The driver's car was left so badly damaged in the incident, which saw other men damage it, that it had to be written off and he could not work.\nIn a separate incident, Meadows was involved in trying to get drugs into jails and on one occasion threw a tennis ball full of ecstasy over a prison wall. The 23-year-old was also sentenced for two separate incidents, a week apart in 2019, which saw him smuggle Class A drugs into HMP Berwyn in Wales.\nMeadows, of no fixed address, admitted wounding with intent, possessing a bladed weapon and two counts of trying to take Cass A drugs into a prison. He was jailed for six years and three months.\nRoman Fletcher\nA paedophile referee turned up to children's football matches and started running the line and giving offside decisions.\nRoman Fletcher has a history of grooming youngsters and is subject to a 10-year sexual harm prevention order. The 21-year-old, formerly known as Peter Burns, was previously locked up for using his role as a wrestling referee to target victims.\nBut he then started using his training as a football official to get closer to children - only to be spotted by an eagle-eyed coach. Fletcher, of Halton Road, Runcorn, admitted breaching his SHPO three times by attending games at Orford Jubilee Neighbourhood Hub in Warrington on September 26, October 10 and November 7 last year.\nHe was jailed for 16 months.\nJanine Clough\nJanine Clough slashed the manager of a Lidl store when she was caught stealing a trolley full of meat.\nThe 43-year-old is one of Liverpool's most prolific shoplifters and was once banned from the city centre. A judge said her \"staggering\" criminal record now features 70 previous convictions for 236 offences.\nWhile high on crack cocaine and armed with a broken coffee jar, she sliced through her victim's uniform, leaving him with three wounds to his back. Clough, of Liverpool Road, Huyton, struck at the Lidl store in Kensington and shoplifted £140 of meat, at around 9pm, on July 24 last year.\nShe pleaded guilty to theft, possessing an offensive weapon and assault causing actual bodily harm. Clough was jailed for two years and 11 months.\nChristopher Halewood\nChristopher Halewood punched his ex in the face before hiding under bed sheets when she called the police.\nThe coked-up bully showed up at the home of his former partner - who the ECHO chose not to name - even though he was banned from doing so. The 39-year-old hit his victim in the face and dragged her around the hallway by her hair, before trying to throw an empty vodka bottle and an iron at her.\nA judge labelled the dad-of-four a coward and a bully after hearing the details of the events at the victim's address on July 10 last year. Halewood, of Roseside Drive, Netherley, was found guilty of assault and admitted four counts of breach of a restraining order.\nHe was jailed for two and a half years.\nJohn Southern\nDrug dealer John Southern went by the handle \"BigDunc\" on the encrypted phone network EncroChat.\nThe 34-year-old was found to have supplied 3.8kg of cocaine, 76kg of cannabis and 3kg of ketamine between March 2020 and June 2020. However, detectives said evidence showed Southern, from Burscough Street, Ormskirk, had been involved in drug dealing since March 2019.\nSouthern denied any wrongdoing but was found guilty after a trial of conspiring to supply the drugs. He was jailed for 15 years.\nGraham Draper\nMerseyside scout leader and former PCSO Graham Draper groomed and sexually abused a 13-year-old girl.\nGraham Draper, then 22, sexually abused her multiple times over an 18-month period and told her they would run away together when she was old enough. Draper, now 31, was a volunteer scout leader at a troop in Merseyside and formerly a police community support officer with Merseyside Police.\nHe groomed the girl online, kissed her at his house after picking her up in his car, then sexually abused her in his vehicle, at various locations. Draper gave her gifts, including money and alcohol, and said he loved her and they would buy a house together.\nShe went to the police in 2020 and the now dad-of-one confessed when arrested, before he admitted eight sexual offences, including causing a child to watch sexual activity and multiple counts of sexual activity with a child. Draper, of Halifax Crescent, Thornton, was jailed for three years and four months.\nCourtney Ireland-Ainsworth\n\"Poisonous\" ex-girlfriend Courtney Ireland-Ainsworth sent herself threats from fake Instagram accounts to get an innocent man locked up.\nCourtney Ireland-Ainsworth created up to 30 false profiles, then told police her former partner Louis Jolly was behind \"vile\" messages. The \"cunning\" teenager reported him for supposedly threatening to stab her and warning: \"She is getting a f***ing blade in her chest.\"\nShe made 10 police statements claiming Mr Jolly was harassing and stalking her, leading to him being arrested six times and spending 81 hours in custody, including being remanded overnight, over five months in 2020. He was charged with assault and stalking, hit with a stalking protection order, bailed on a home curfew with an electronic tag, and even lost his job.\nDetectives requested data from Instagram's owners Facebook, but the court heard this \"took some time to be released to the police\". When it finally was released, it revealed the false profiles were in fact linked to Ireland-Ainsworth's own email accounts and IP addresses.\nThe charges were dropped against Mr Jolly and Ireland-Ainsworth, now 20, of Brackendale, Runcorn, admitted perverting the course of justice. She was locked up for 10 months.\nBradley Hughes\nPolice found a gun when they raided the home of drug dealer Bradley Hughes.\nThe 31-year-old used the secret phone network EncroChat, going by the name \"TwoTimes\", to supply Class A and B drugs between April 2020 and July 2020. Detectives raided his house in Hatfield Gardens, Huyton, on Thursday, July 15 last year, after discovering his identity after EncroChat was hacked.\nDuring the raid, officers found and seized a gun and Class A drugs. He pleaded guilty to drug offences and having a firearm without a certificate and was jailed for 10 years.\nMichael Hall\nThief Michael Hall who was brought down by his distinctive stripy socks was banned from every Co-op store in Merseyside.\nThe 33-year-old repeatedly targeted Co-op stores in 2021 and even cheekily stayed in a hotel to raid two more in North Wales. He waited just two months after getting out of prison to begin his latest crime spree, which involved losses of more than £135,000.\nHall, of no fixed address, climbed onto the roofs of the premises - usually brazenly using a ladder - to break in and scarper with cash and goods. But the drug addict's downfall involved his distinctive socks, which were spotted on CCTV and later found at his home.\nHall, formerly of Mount Pleasant, Waterloo, admitted burgling eight Co-op stores and also a coffee shop, where he stole a charity box. He was jailed for six years.\nGrant Pridham\nA boy thought he was going to die when Grant Pridham demanded cigarettes and pointed a BB gun at his head.\nThe deluded thug had earlier been thrown out of a pub in Burtonwood after producing the air pistol and claiming to be an \"assassin\". The 30-year-old then accosted two teenagers in the street, shortly after midnight, and threatened them with the weapon.\nPridham, of Borron Road in Newton-le-Willows, admitted two counts of possessing an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence. At the time of the offences, on September 4 and 5, 2021, he was on licence after serving a seven-and-a-half-year sentence for robbing an elderly couple in their Warrington home at knifepoint.\nPridham was jailed for three years and nine months.\nRoy Bryers\nA dad was \"sickened\" to discover a paedophile had photographed his daughter through her bedroom window.\nRoy Bryers, 49, spied on the child, who was standing at her window while undressed, and took a picture on his mobile phone. The victim and her parents had no idea, until police raided Bryers' home on July 9, 2019 over sick chats he'd taken part in online.\nAmong his collection of child sex abuse photos, officers recovered the picture of the unsuspecting child. Police found he had been talking about sex with a paedophile hunter, posing as a 12-year-old girl called Izzy, on WhatsApp.\nBryers admitted attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child and to cause a child to engage in sexual activity. He also pleaded guilty to one count of possessing and two counts of making indecent images of children.\nBryers, of Castle Walk, Southport, was jailed for three years.\nTaylor Johnson\nTwo teenagers plotted for days how to take advantage of a drunken woman before sexually assaulting a vulnerable victim in a hotel room.\nAlex Stormont and Taylor Johnson abused their victim while, in the words of the judge who sentenced them, she was \"essentially asleep\". Their attack followed days of texts between the pair in which they discussed booking a hotel room and planned how to make the attack possible.\nThe Wirral men, both aged 19 at the time, struck on a night out in Liverpool city centre in March 2018, bringing a woman who \"could barely stand up or walk\" back to a room they booked at a Travelodge. Taylor Johnson, 23 and of Edgbaston Way in Bidston, was sentenced to three years and six months for two counts of assault by penetration.\nThe pair performed sexual acts on the woman when she was incapable of giving consent, before she later reported the attacks. Stormont, now 23, of Woodchurch Road in Oxton, and Johnson, now 23, of Edgbaston Way in Bidston, were both found guilty of two counts of assault by penetration after a trial.\nThey were jailed for three and a half years each.\nConnor Higgins\nThree men were jailed for their role in a County Lines drug operation involving a phone number nicknamed \"Scouse Mick\".\nThe gang flooded parts of North Wales with heroin and cocaine, which was delivered directly to the homes of their customers. A judge said their exploits would have had \"a devastating effect on local communities\", feeding addiction and misery.\nIan Heyes, Connor Higgins and James Douglas targeted addicts in Flintshire with their Class A drugs business. It is believed they dealt heroin and cocaine with a value of around £90,000, before North Wales Police brought them down through Operation Blue Annex.\nHeyes, 32, from Tuebrook; Higgins, 30, from Litherland; and Douglas, 28, from Woolton; each admitted conspiring to supply crack cocaine and heroin. Heyes was jailed for two years, consecutive to an unrelated sentence he is already serving.\nHiggins and Douglas were each jailed for three years and four months.\nJamal Adam-Neale\nA 16-year-old shouted \"do you want to get sliced up?\" before plunging a huge chunk of glass into a dad's stomach.\nJamal Adam-Neale stabbed Steven Cartwright in an alleyway off Scarisbrick Avenue in Southport on August 23 last year. Mr Cartwright required life-saving surgery to remove part of his small bowel after the brutal attack and has been left permanently scarred.\nProsecutors said it wasn't clear what started an argument between a group containing Jamal Adam-Neale and a group containing Mr Cartwright and his friend Steven Johnson. Adam-Neale punched the two men, breaking Mr Cartwright's elbow and injuring Mr Johnson's head, before he ran off and picked up a large piece of glass.\nThe teenager, of Falkner Street, Liverpool city centre, then stabbed Mr Cartwright once in the stomach and twice in the back, before he fled. Adam-Neale, who admitted wounding with intent and two counts of common assault, was locked up for four years and four months.\nGrace Smith\nA woman suffocated her own nan with a pillow and dragged her by the hair in a desperate bid to steal her money.\nA judge said Grace Smith's attack on Mary Smith, 73, in Anfield last July saw the 20-year-old \"suffocate her into submission\". It was the culmination of a campaign of theft and harassment against family members, which went on for years.\nSmith stole thousands from her nan through credit card fraud and also tried to pawn a ring her mum inherited from her late father. She began stealing from her nan in February 2019, using her credit card details to place more than £500 in food orders.\nShe then went further, using details of a different card to make just under £3,500 of orders on Amazon, Uber Eats and Netflix. Smith, of no fixed address, admitted offences including robbery, theft, fraud and numerous breaches of a restraining order.\nShe was jailed for six years and two months.\nDean Colquhoun\nConvicted gun thug Dean Colquhoun was found hiding in a garden after escaping a police escort guarding him in hospital.\nHe helped burgle a home in Lancashire in January 2020, only to be caught by police at the wheel of a £50,000 Audi RS3 taken in the raid just nine days later. Colquhoun was released on bail, before officers raided his home that July and found almost 90g of cannabis, £2,010 in cash, plus designer watches and shoes.\nThe 26-year-old wasn't present but was spotted in the back of a taxi on October 27, 2020, when he was arrested after a violent struggle and sustained injuries. The crook was taken to hospital for treatment, however, when a police guard took a phone call, he fled to a residential garden, when he was caught again.\nColquhoun, of no fixed address, admitted burglary, possessing cannabis with intent to supply, escape from lawful custody and possessing criminal property. He was jailed for four years and one month.\nMichael Lynch\n\"Rogue trader\" Michael Lynch forced an elderly woman to cut down on food and heating bills as he conned her out of nearly £33,000.\nLynch, 38, of Wordsworth Avenue, Widnes, befriended his 75-year-old victim in 2019 and used to tell her she was like \"family\" and \"a second mother\". He started charging her for shoddy or non-existent building repairs and got her to stand as a guarantor for a £6,000 loan, purportedly for his business.\nLynch took phone contracts out in her name costing around £7,000 and falsely said he would repay her; used her credit card to withdraw cash and buy items in JD Sports and off licences; and \"borrowed\" electrical items from her, while claiming he had a £2m building contract lined up. He admitted four counts of fraud and one count of theft and was jailed for three years and seven months.\nJoseph Robinson\nJoseph Robinson had a bike seat converted to hide a shotgun stashed in his home.\nThe audacious contraption was recovered after police caught him riding an electric bike while carrying a pistol in Kensington. Officers went to the 22-year-old's home in nearby Hampstead Road after arresting him at around midnight on October 10, 2021.\nThere they found the adapted bike seat loaded with a shotgun, ammunition, cocaine and cannabis. Robinson admitted possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, possessing ammunition - 9mm rounds - without a certificate, possessing a prohibited firearm, possessing cocaine and cannabis with intent to supply, driving without a licence, and using a vehicle without insurance.\nHe was jailed for 11 years.\nChelsea Russell\n\"Out of control\" Chelsea Russell waved a knife at a car window while a three-year-old child was sitting behind screaming in fear.\nRussell said she \"lost her head\" when dad-of-three David Law intervened in an argument she was having with her girlfriend. Mr Law and his wife Amy stopped their car when they saw Shauna Aston distressed in Stonebridge Lane, Croxteth, on September 25, 2021.\nBut when Mr Law prevented Russell from grabbing her partner, the 23-year-old went home and returned with a five to six inch knife. She slashed the blade towards the victim in front of his terrified children - aged three, seven and eight - then attacked their car.\nRussell, of Stonedale Crescent, Croxteth, admitted affray, possessing a bladed article in public and criminal damage. She was jailed for 12 months.\nNathan Frazer\nNathan Frazer threatened a couple with a machete and attacked one of them with a hammer in their own home.\nThe 27-year-old was one of three men who broke into a flat on Whitethroat Walk in Birchwood, Warrington, on Friday, December 3, 2021. The balaclava-clad men attacked one of the victims with a hammer and also threatened the couple with a machete, then fled with a handful of computer games.\nBut detectives found CCTV footage of Frazer with his balaclava lifted as he was smoking a cigarette and waving a hammer just moments before the incident. They also recovered text messages in which he admitted committing the burglary and he later pleaded guilty to aggravated burglary.\nFrazer was jailed for seven years and a half years.\nWesley Kavanagh\nWesley Kavanagh was caught after messages from an EncroChat device activated after the network had already been hacked.\nThe drug dealer had picked up a phone enabled with the software from a side street in Oldham in a £1,400 deal in May 2020. By that time the system had already been compromised by an international operation that allowed texts to be obtained by police.\nKavanagh, 36, sourced his EncroChat-enabled phone through his friend Lee Taylor, with whom he dealt cocaine and cannabis. Taylor, 34, was already trading under the handle MuscialSalmon and Kavanagh started using the name MysticBlade.\nTexts showed the Warrington dealers used an adulterant nicknamed 'marshmallow' to bulk up cocaine before flogging it to customers. Kavanagh, of Stockport Road in Thelwall, and Taylor, of Longshaw Street in Dallam, both admitted conspiring to supply Class A and B drugs, said to be at least six kilos of cocaine and at least nine kilos of cannabis.\nThey were both jailed for 12 years.\nJoshua McLaughlan\nJoshua McLaughlan viciously attacked a student while photographing or filming the helpless victim.\nThe 26-year-old repeatedly punched Joshua Ormrod in the head and body, before coming back to attack him for a second and third time. The thug left his victim lying unconscious in the middle of Fleet Street in Liverpool City Centre at around 4.30am on June 17, 2021.\nBut the IT network engineer - captured on CCTV cameras - was detained by nearby door staff, while other security staff gave first aid. McLaughlan, of Hawkshead Drive, Bolton, admitted assault causing actual bodily harm.\nHe was jailed for 16 months.\nMichael Smith\nMichael Smith \"looked like a zombie\" as he smashed through a mum's front door with an axe before pulling her arm onto the broken glass.\nCatherine McLoughlin suffered cuts to her arm when Smith struck at her Walton home last November, as part of a wider incident when he also smashed up her sister's house and even his own car. Ms McLoughlin told police that Smith - her sister Donna Payne's ex partner - \"looked like a character from The Walking Dead\" in the drunken attack on November 20, 2021.\nSmith, 36, of Avis Walk, Fazakerley, admitted wounding, possessing a bladed article in public and two counts of criminal damage. He was jailed for 16 months.\nEdward Mullins\nAlcoholic Edward Mullins threatened to stab his housemates and repeatedly hurled homophobic insults.\nPolice were twice called to the address in Belle Vale - once by Mullins himself - on August 22 last year. After police arrived for the second time, he made other offensive remarks to one of the arresting officers.\nMullins, 47, now of no fixed address, admitted affray over the incident. He was jailed for 20 months.\nCraig Ford\nCraig Ford was caught trying to break into a home on a Ring doorbell and tried to flee the scene on a little girl's pink bike.\nThe 28-year-old convicted burglar struck at a property in Capricorn Crescent, Huyton, at around 2.40am on January 20 this year. But his victim was woken by the doorbell and saw Ford fiddling with the front door lock, so ran downstairs and chased him away.\nFord, who was accompanied by another man hiding behind a nearby car, jumped on the bike to flee, but then abandoned it and ran off. The burglar, of no fixed address, admitted attempted burglary.\nFord was jailed for two years.\nMichael and Peter Moogan\nTwo brothers once named among the UK's 'most wanted' ran a drug dealing operation busted by happy birthday messages.\nMichael and Peter Moogan shared an EncroChat handle \"PaleFlame\" but were caught out in part by a flurry of congratulations on Peter's big day. The convicted gun crooks, from Huyton, were linked to the dealing of eight kilos of cocaine and one kilo of cannabis, plus nearly £90,000 in dirty cash.\nMichael also admitted affray, relating to threats over alleged missing cash made to his partner's sister in August 2020, which caused her to flee Huyton. The court heard the two men both have previous convictions for guns, when they fled to Spain to try and evade justice.\nMichael, 33, of Boundary Road, and Peter, 39, of Salerno Drive, admitted conspiring to supply cocaine and cannabis. They were each jailed for 11 years and three months.\nThomas Broadhurst\nThomas Broadhurst killed his friend of 20 years Thomas Edmunds after targeting him in a brutal gang robbery.\nBroadhurst put Mr Edmunds in a fatal chokehold as Terence Bennett, Kevin Nethercote and Kevin Condliffe helped rob the victim's cash. The drunken gang were caught on recordings talking about their plan to violently attack Mr Edmunds, and even celebrated after they left him for dead.\nThe men struck at the house the 36-year-old victim shared with his father Alan Edmunds, in Clorain Road, Kirkby, at around 10pm on May 9 last year. Bennett waited outside in the car while Broadhurst, Nethercote and Condliffe knocked on the front door, before they were let in by Mr Edmunds senior.\nBroadhurst and Condliffe attacked the victim, with Broadhurst putting him in a \"chicken hold\", and Condliffe stealing cash he had saved from his job as a labourer. The group then fled in a car, blowing the money on alcohol and drugs, before the victim died in hospital the following day, after suffering a cardiac arrest.\nBroadhurst, 32, of Regal Road, Croxteth, was jailed for 10 years and eight months after he pleaded guilty to manslaughter and conspiracy to rob. Bennett, 34, of Sovereign Hey; Nethercote, 48, of Regal Road; and Condliffe, 17, of Carr Lane East; all in Croxteth, were locked up for eight years, nine years and four months, and five years respectively, after they all admitted conspiracy to rob.\nMichael Hoy aka Michael Brown\nA murderer released early from a life sentence became a cocaine dealer trying to trade in guns and grenades.\nMichael Brown changed his name and went into landscaping work in an apparent bid to escape his shocking past. He was one of two doormen who stabbed to death innocent Colin McGinty after mistaking the 21-year-old for a gangland rival.\nIn 2001, he was sentenced to life with a recommended minimum term of 18 years, after his victim was stabbed 15 times on a Bootle street. However, Brown was released in 2017 after serving just 16 years behind bars, changed his name to Michael Hoy, and got an EncroChat phone.\nHe used the codename TimelyBeta and worked with Patrick Murray - aka WeirdGun - to try and broker deals for grenades and guns, including AK47s and Uzis.

Welsh was detained and arrested.\nWelsh, of Vanbrugh Road, Walton, admitted attempted robbery over the incident, at around 4pm on February 10 this year, in Priory Road, Anfield. The court heard he has mental health problems and was the son of a crack addict who was put in care as a toddler.\nJudge Gary Woodhall accepted Welsh was genuinely remorseful and took into account his \"tragic, traumatic extreme upbringing\". He pointed out that it did not excuse his behaviour, but his duty was to impose the least possible sentence commensurate with his offending and jailed him for three years and eight months.\nThomas Wright\nA Huyton joiner was part of a gang who transported heroin and crack cocaine between Liverpool and Wrexham.\nThe group was blown apart after officers busted several doors and discovered the true scale of the operation. Seven of the 11 members of the Wrexham-based crew were sentenced this week, including \"trusted\" courier Thomas Wright.\nThey were operating a major drug supply chain over roughly a year between March 2020 and 2021. Their patch was predominantly in and around Wrexham, a place that the judge said was already \"suffering greatly\" from a drug problem.\nThomas Wright, 44, of Fairfield Avenue, Huyton, was branded as the \"upstream supplier\". Wright - who sourced \"kilos upon kilos\" of hard drugs for the gang to shift in the Wrexham area and was convicted of being part of the Class A drug conspiracies - was jailed for 10 years.\nHis defence barrister, Julian Nutter, claimed the \"respectable\" joiner was threatened into joining the trade. It was said he had been \"forced\" to work for criminals higher up the drugs supply chain.\nEthan Birch\nSocial media cyber groomer Ethan Birch drove to Widnes with children's underwear in the boot to meet an '11-year-old girl'.\nThe 20-year-old turned up at the car park of the DCBL Stadium on Lower House Lane, Widnes, on Friday, January 21, with \"knickers and crop tops\" and a change of boxer shorts for himself after 10 days of messages online including sexual incitement and sending obscene images of himself.\nUnbeknown to Birch, of Little Lowes Meadow, Lowton, Warrington, the supposed child was really an adult decoy out to snare paedophiles preying on the young online. When Birch arrived, adults from a group called Cobra UK confronted Birch and rang Cheshire Police, who arrived and arrested him.\nBirch admitted five counts of attempting to cause a child to engage in sexual activity, two counts of attempting to cause a child to watch a sexual act, attempting to meet a child following grooming, attempted sexual communication with a child, and attempting to cause a child to engage in sexual communication.\nHe was locked up for four years and eight months.\nSteven Mallon\nJewellery shop robber Steven Mallon was tackled to the ground by police after being hit by an SUV while fleeing.\nCCTV footage of the \"blatant and audacious\" raid - carried out in front of passers-by - was played in court after the only gang member caught appeared for sentencing. Mallon's five accomplices leaped onto two motorcycles when police rushed to the scene, Rebecca's Jewellery Shop in Southport, taking the other bike out of action.\nMallon was tackled to the ground and arrested when he tried to flee on foot and was knocked over by a small SUV. The raid was carefully pre-planned and the gang was equipped with an angle grinder, axe, hammer and crowbar.\nThe \"clearly organised\" burglary happened just after 9pm on Monday, March 21 this year. Three of the men, all in black and wearing helmets, waited on the motorbikes while the others, including Mallon, were involved in breaking in during an estimated £80,000 raid.\nOne of them used an angle grinder, from which large showers of sparks were seen, to cut through the metal shutter and then a grille inside the shop. Mallon, 43, of Briarwood Road, Aigburth, admitted robbery.\nHe was jailed for two years and eight months.\nDavid Houghton\nDavid Houghton jumped into the Manchester Ship Canal after speeding the wrong way up the M6.\nAt 1.17pm on Wednesday, April 6 this year, officers spotted a white Volkswagen Transporter on the M6 southbound near to junction 21 at Woolston Interchange. Intelligence suggested the driver of the van, Houghton, 43, did not have a licence and officers tried to stop the van.\nHe pulled off the motorway onto the A57 roundabout and appeared to stop for officers. However, he then made off at speed.\nHoughton drove the wrong way down the M6 on two occasions and travelled at speeds well above the 50mph limit. Despite abandoning a chase on two occasions due to the manner of his driving, officers followed Houghton from a safe distance to the A50 Knutsford Road.\nHoughton eventually turned off onto Thelwall Lane, a dead-end road. He abandoned his vehicle and fled before jumping into the Manchester Ship Canal. He was arrested as he got out of the water on the other side.\nHoughton, of no fixed address but from Liverpool, admitted dangerous driving and failing to provide a specimen. He was jailed for 16 months.\nLisa Fletcher\nBurgling mum Lisa Fletcher wept as she was led to the cells for a jail term which means she might not see her father alive again.\nFletcher and her then partner Lee Owens stole more than £1,200 of stock from an independent shop in Maghull last year. The couple were caught after an off duty police officer spotted them in an Indian restaurant and recognised them from CCTV.\nThe pair targeted Ryat Menswear on Moreton Way on November 21, waiting until the owner went out to get lunch before ransacking the shop in the space of a minute. They took £1,285 in stock from the shop.\nPolice found CCTV of the pair but were unable to locate them until the next month, when an off-duty officer went for a meal at a restaurant with his partner. He spotted the thieves at another table and rang the police.\nOwens tried to pickpocket another diner and the officer got him on the floor before he and his girlfriend were arrested. The couple, both of Drake Crescent, Fazakerley, admitted burglary and Fletcher told the court she cared for her father who is seriously ill with cancer.\nOwens was jailed for three years and a tearful Fletcher for 16 months, as she moaned through tears: \"But my dad is going to die.\"\nGary Stanley\nA man found a loaded gun at the bottom of his garden after two thugs threatened to shoot him.\nThe homeowner disturbed the masked men lurking outside his house in Childwall. They issued the chilling threat before fleeing on a motorbike.\nWhen he searched around his property, the victim spotted a holdall in woodland backing onto his address. It contained a Russian semi-automatic pistol - bearing the DNA of fugitive crack dealer Gary Stanley.\nStanley dived off a boat into a canal in a futile attempt to swim away from police when caught by officers in June 2020. He was wanted at the time for crimes including threatening to skin his ex-girlfriend alive and biting her.\nStanley, of Kingsland Road, Norris Green, was jailed for five years that summer. He was back in the dock in connection with the discovery of the firearm, in Lanfranc Close at around 7.20pm on February 14, 2020.\nHe wasn't located until June 17 that year, when he jumped off a boat into the Leeds and Liverpool canal at Burscough. Stanley, now 33, admitted possessing a prohibited firearm and possessing ammunition without a certificate.\nHe was jailed for six years.\nBehnam Tavakoli-Juibari\nBehnam Tavakoli-Juibari who helped run a £9m plot to distribute cocaine across Britain kept details of his gang's deals in notebooks.\nHe acted as the bookkeeper for a crew responsible for shifting huge amounts of Class A drugs. The 37-year-old is the last of the gang to be sentenced but was finally jailed after being extradited from the Netherlands and admitting his role in the plot.\nThe group supplied hundreds of kilos of drugs in England, Wales and Scotland throughout the first half of 2016, with eight members jailed for a total of 106 years in May 2018. The plot, which focused on the supply of cocaine but also included heroin, MDMA, and diazepam, was mainly run from the Wirral, but collapsed after Merseyside Police's Operation Wessex.\nOfficers raided an address used by the group, seizing a £1.4m stash including more than 9kg of cocaine, 7kg of unadulterated heroin, 10,000 MDMA pills and 11,000 diazepam tablets.\nBookkeeper and courier Tavakoli-Juibari, of Woodlands Avenue, New Brighton, admitted his role in the plots. He was jailed for 15 years.\nPeter Neild\nPeter Neild who recorded himself sexually assaulting a toddler was caught out by police who recognised his tattoos.\nHis attacks on the little girl came to light after police found a phone hidden in the headrest of a chair in his Little Sutton home and matched his tattoos to those captured in the video. Officers had gone to arrest him on suspicion of downloading indecent images from the internet, but were faced with vile footage of Neild himself carrying out abuse.\nThe 50-year-old, who told police \"I need help, I cannot continue like this\", was labelled a danger to children after police raided his home on January 27 this year. Officers have since been able to identify the child and she and her family are being supported by social services. Neild admitted sexual assault against her.\nNeild was also sentenced for an earlier set of sexual offences committed when he was living in Southport, when he was caught out by paedophile hunters trying to groom a young girl online and then arrange to meet her in 2018. He admitted attempting to meet a child following grooming, to incite a child to engage in sexual activity, to incite a child to watch sexual activity, and to engage in sexual communication with a child.\nNeild, of Chester Road, Little Sutton, had previously been jailed for rape, unlawful sexual contact with a child and sexual assault of a child. He was jailed for 10 years and 10 months, with an extended five years on licence.\nHarry Beardsmore\nHarry Beardsmore cuckooed the home of two drug addicts and used their flat to package and sell Class A drugs.\nA lockdown raid at a flat in Torquay saw police find Beardsmore and Brandon Murray packaging and selling heroin and cocaine. The legal tenants of the flat were drug addicts who lived in the bedroom while the two men slept in the living room.\nMore than 20g of cocaine and heroin was seized, along with £1,500 in cash, on June 22, 2020. Beardsmore, 21, of Bedford Road, Birkenhead, was found guilty of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs and possession of criminal property.\nBeardsmore was jailed for four and a half years.\nPaul Devine\nPaul Devine threatened to stab a shop worker before smashing up his shop in a robbery sparked by a row over a mobile phone top up.\nHe launched the terrifying attack at the Day 2 Day convenience store in Everton Valley on December 20 last year, swinging a large kitchen knife at a terrified worker. The 34-year-old later told police he couldn't remember the incident and wept as he was shown footage of the chaos he caused.\nDevine had asked to top up £10 on his phone. The money appeared to go from his account but he couldn't yet see it on his phone records and argued before leaving the shop, then returning in a drink and drug fuelled rage.\nThe dad-of-one, who shouted \"I'll stab you, I'll stab you,\" admitted attempted robbery, possession of a bladed article and criminal damage. Devine, of Jason Street, Everton, was jailed for five years and three months.\nJoseph Helps\nJoseph Helps strangled his partner during brutal domestic abuse.\nThe 48-year-old, of Main Street, Halton Village, Runcorn, was arrested following the attack on the woman in Main Street on Saturday, May 14. Court papers said the offence was considered \"so serious\" and only custody would suffice because Helps had a \"flagrant disregard for people and their property\".\nThe court heard he had a history of domestic abuse, strangulation was involved, and he was already on a community order. He admitted assault causing actual bodily harm.\nA three-year restraining order was imposed banning him from contacting his victim and visiting two named street addresses. Helps was jailed for 12 months.\nAndrew Graham\nDrug dealer Andrew Graham missed the birth of his first child after police caught him moving a block of crack cocaine from Liverpool to Scotland.\nHe hid 107g of Class A drugs in the wheel arch of his car as he tried to ferry it out of Merseyside, but officers discovered it after searching his car. They also found he and another man in the car, Justin Richmond, were dealing cannabis, on November 7, 2020.\nGraham and Richmond's phones were seized and it then emerged both had been dealing cannabis on a low level for the preceding two months. Both admitted being concerned in the supply of Class B drugs and possessing cannabis, while Graham also admitted possessing crack cocaine with intent to supply.\nGraham, 21, of Tiree Court, Dreghorn, was jailed for three years and two months. Richmond, 19, of Annick Drive, Dreghorn, was spared jail.\nAaron Rowe\nAaron Rowe who vandalised nine police vehicles could have put lives at risk, a senior police officer said.\nThe 36-year-old, of no fixed address, admitted threatening behaviour towards a woman in Widnes on March 11; two separate assaults by beating against two men on May 11 in Widnes; criminal damage to the ceiling of a Halton Borough Council disabled toilet on May 11; criminal damage towards nine police vehicles in Runcorn; and a supervision breach.\nCourt papers said the crime spree was \"so serious\" due to being committed while on licence, a domestic offence, assaulting people at work, and because of his previous criminal record. Cheshire Police said he could have put vital vehicles out of action, leaving patrols unable to get to incidents, which could be the difference between life and death.\nHe was jailed for 24 weeks.\nTrevor Carr\nA 12-year-old child was abducted outside of a busy train station and driven 120 miles away.\nTrevor Carr, 40, and Ava Jones, 28, threw a blanket over the child's head and told them to turn off their phone so they couldn't be tracked. The pair abducted the child, who was in school uniform, at Wigan North Western railway station and drove to a campsite in North Wales.\nThe pair argued during the journey, with the police calling them during the drive, resulting in the child screaming. Jones put a hand over the child's mouth and told officers that her name was David Jones, and that she was camping in Ireland.\nBut when detectives tracked Jones' phone, they discovered they were at Fferm Cedris Farm Campsite in Abergynolwyn, North Wales. Jones had pitched up a tent and was staying in it with the child, in separate sleeping bags.\nThe child had started speaking with Jones online in September 2021, when they discussed gender identity. The child's gran told Jones to stop and warned her it was \"grooming\", but that October 4, Jones and Carr abducted the child.\nCarr, of Burns Street, Bootle, and Jones, of no fixed address, both admitted abduction on the basis the crime was not sexually motivated. Carr was jailed for two years and Jones for two years and two months.\nRyan Blake\nScrambler yob Ryan Blake was caught with more than 2.5 kilos of MDMA but told police he was just holding it for his drug dealer.\nPolice seized around £100,000 of ecstasy when they raided his Hughes Street, Garston home in 2019. Yet in a bizarre claim, the 26-year-old told officers his own dealer, known simply as \"Gary\", had asked him to hold the colossal amount of the Class A drug - then never asked for it back.\nA judge told Blake, who has been jailed before for a cowardly scrambler bike attack on police, his excuse was unbelievable. Police raided Blake's home on November 11, 2019, and found 2.62kg of ecstasy. The drugs, at 32% purity, were judged to have a street value of between £78,000 and £130,000.\nBlake admitted possession of the MDMA with intent to supply but said his role was a minor one and he was actually just holding drugs for a dealer to whom he owed a £800 debt.\nA judge rubbished his claims and noted he had a past conviction for drug dealing. Blake also admitted possessing cocaine with intent to supply, over a separate haul of eight wraps of cocaine, weighing 3.9g, found during a separate police search in July 2020.\nHe was jailed for seven years and 11 months.\nJohn Neild\nJohn Neild threatened to bury his girlfriend in a hole if she spoke out about his vile domestic abuse.\nThe 30-year-old attacked the woman - who the ECHO chose not to name - twice in separate attacks just over a month apart, trying to strangle her during the first incident and then knocking her out in the second, breaking bones.\nNeild turned aggressive with his partner of nearly three years at home, at around 10pm on Boxing Day last year. He slapped the woman, tried to strangle her, then grabbed a kitchen knife and demanded their friends leave, before pushing her face down onto a bed. When she screamed, he threatened to bite her ear off.\nOn December 27 he made the threat to bury her and on February 4, after going out drinking, he attacked her, leaving her with facial fractures requiring surgery. Neild, of Barnes Close, Widnes, admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm and threatening behaviour over the February 4 incident and assault causing actual bodily harm over the Boxing Day assault.\nHe was jailed for 16 months.\nJoseph Byrne\nJoseph Byrne who used the EncroChat handle \"FoxHedge\" blew kisses to his partner as he was being sent down.\nByrne was a drug broker and courier who supplied narcotics across the country. The 44-year-old was involved with at least 30 kilos of cocaine and heroin, as well as thousands of pounds of cannabis.\nIn one message he told another EncroChat user he was carrying £38,000 he owed when driving through a police stop check area. Byrne said: \"It was heavvvyyy s*** myself.\"\nWhen police raided his home in Radway Road, Huyton on July 15 last year they found passports, £7,000 in cash, cannabis and scales. Byrne admitted three conspiracies to supply drugs involving cocaine, heroin and cannabis between January 1 and June 4, 2020.\nByrne, whose previous convictions include conspiracy to supply amphetamine, was jailed for 12 years and nine months.\nMichael Brandrick\nMichael Brandrick and James Donnelly dealt cocaine and cannabis out of a car in a Toby Carvery car park.\nThey were caught out when police spotted them sitting in a Volkswagen Tiguan in the car park of the restaurant in Aigburth Road, Aigburth. The pub, formerly known as the Kingsman, was closed because of lockdown. The Tiguan was parked with its lights on next to another car with its lights on, on January 4 last year.\nThe car stunk of cannabis and when Brandrick, 30, was searched officers found two wraps of cocaine in his jacket pocket and two clear bags in his waistband which contained 13g of the same drug. He also had £300 of cannabis and his mobile phone was vibrating.\nHe was arrested and when strip searched at the police station a further four wraps of cocaine were found, before officers seized amphetamine at his home in Dovedale Avenue, Eastham. He had £1,700 of drugs in total.\nWhen 37-year-old Donnelly's home in Arranmore Road, Mossley Hill was searched, police found a red bag containing £1,500 of heroin. A bag of £2,070 of cocaine was also found.\nBrandrick admitted possessing cocaine and cannabis with intent to supply and possessing amphetamine. Donnelly admitted possessing heroin and cocaine with intent to supply.\nBrandrick and Donnelly, neither of whom had previous convictions, were both jailed for two and a half years.\nAllan Breen\nAllan Breen who ploughed into a man trying to cross the road had more than seven times the legal limit of cocaine in his blood.\nHe also had his son in the car as he crashed into Paul Tyler on Prescot Road last year, putting him in hospital for four weeks. The 43-year-old dad, who was already serving a sentence for drug offences, was jailed for two years and eight months after admitting causing serious injury by dangerous driving.\nAmber Owen, 23, who was driving directly in front of Breen before the accident but swerved to avoid Mr Tyler directly before Breen crashed into him, admitted careless driving. Breen and Owen both stopped at a red light next to each other on the evening of April 14, before driving off at speed when it turned green.\nThe pair, who do not know each other, then turned on to Prescot Road and sped down it. Owen claimed she felt threatened by Breen and was trying to get away from him - but he denied this.\nBreen was tailgating Owen's car and when she swerved to avoid the victim, Breen hit him, catapulting him across the road. Mr Tyler suffered open fractures to one of his legs, plus head and facial injuries, required two surgeries and spent a month in hospital.\nBreen, of Regal Road, Croxteth, was jailed for two years and eight months. Owen, of Heather Brow, Claughton, was fined £450.\nAnthony Byrne\nA woman was in agony after her drunken partner poured a kettle of boiling water over her.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard Anthony Byrne, 55, was in a relationship with his victim for three years at the time of the offence on March 8 this year. On the night of the attack his victim asked Byrne for the key to her house back due to his drinking.\nHe threw the key at her, she picked it up and went into the kitchen, but he followed and pushed her. He then picked up the kettle, which he knew had boiling water inside because she had told him so, and poured it on her, said Paul Blasbery, prosecuting.\nRecorder Blakey said that as a result she suffered a scald burn and he said he had seen photographs showing “a substantial blister” on her back. He has previous convictions including harassing previous partners and the judge said that showed “a history of domestic abuse but nothing like this matter.”\nByrne, formerly of Alpine Street, Newton-le-Willows, who had pleaded guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, was jailed for four years.\nThe judge imposed an indefinite restraining order on Byrne to keep away from the victim and Alpine Street.\nHuw Thomas\nA paedophile who sent dozens of messages to what he thought were young teenage girls was caught after vigilantes managed to get into the accommodation unit where he was living.\nHuw Thomas didn’t realise he was messaging self-described \"paedophile hunters\" as he sent a slew of vile messages to accounts he believed belonged to underage girls. Yet members of the Lancashire-based group, Fleetwood Enforcers UK, discovered the address he was living at and went there to try to catch the 46-year-old themselves.\nIt was only after they accosted other people living at the supported living unit and found out Thomas wasn’t there that police were contacted about his behaviour.\nThe judge, Brian Cummings, QC, said that Thomas accepted he had a sexual interest and children and that this was dangerous but said he had only stopped when there was intervention from the police rather than through his own efforts. He said: “There was a level of persistence in that you continued offending after one of your phones was seized.”\nThomas, of Queens Road, Southport, was jailed for three years and four months.\nLuke Dwyer\nA man who tried to take a flare into a Liverpool FC away match was jailed after twice breaching a suspended sentence.\nLuke Dwyer was originally hauled before the courts last year after being convicted of dangerous driving while barred from getting behind the wheel. Despite being given a chance on that occasion, the 29-year-old went on to commit two more offences and cried in court today as he landed himself in prison for the first time.\nDwyer was described by the judge, Recorder Daniel Prowse, as having an “appalling” driving record and had narrowly avoided prison in 2021 after a judge handed him a 10-month sentence, suspended for 18 months.\nHe was then caught as he tried to get in to Selhurst Park with a flare to see Liverpool play Crystal Palace on Sunday, January 23 this year. Months later, officers also found him driving erratically and believed him to be under the influence of cannabis, though he refused to be tested. He later admitted driving while disqualified, failing to provide a sample and possession of cannabis, in addition to the offence at Selhurst Park.\nDwyer, of Sunnyside Road, Ashton-in-Makerfield, was sentenced to a total of six months. That included an eight-week prison term for the offences committed earlier this month and four months of his suspended sentence.\nHe is also disqualified from driving for four years and banned from regulated football matches for three years. Dwyer cried at various points during the hearing but was emotionless as he was led to the cells.\nDaniel Colebourne\nA man dragged his mum from her bed and smashed her head against a wall in a brutal attack in their home.\nDaniel Colebourne left Margaret Colebourne “black and blue” after a vicious assault in their home earlier this year. The 27 year old’s actions were so serious a judge didn’t just jail him but barred him from contacting her after she told prosecutors she never wanted to see him again.\nColebourne attacked his mum back in April last year, leaving her with an 8cm gash and extensive bruising across her head. He later claimed the injuries were caused by an accident but eventually admitted wounding as well as criminal damage for causing damage to his mum's fridge during the same incident.\nColebourne, of HMP Altcourse, was jailed for 18 months.\nPeter Wilson\nA paedophile's sick stash of child sex abuse videos included a half-hour film of him molesting a child.\nConvicted sex offender Peter Wilson moved to Merseyside after being released from prison and going \"missing\". The 32-year-old was eventually tracked down to a hotel in Litherland.\nPolice discovered he had downloaded twisted files including a video of a baby being raped, which left a judge speechless when it was described in court. But a further movie showed Wilson himself sexually abusing a young girl - then turning to the camera to reveal his face.\nThe judge jailed him for five years, with an extended eight years on licence. This means Wilson must serve at least two thirds of the sentence - three years and four months - behind bars, before he can ask for parole.\nHowever, he will only be released at that stage if the Parole Board considers he is no longer a risk. He will then be on licence for whatever remains of the five years, plus the extended eight years.\nIf he offends again, he could be recalled to prison to serve all of that time in jail.\nJames Gibney\nA gang of thugs launched lit fireworks at Liverpool fans as they celebrated the Reds winning the Premier League in 2020.\nJames Gibney, 39; Peter Mallon, 20; Youssif Ahmed, 28; Quaynan Browne, 21; and Claire Rowson, 38, all appeared at Liverpool Crown Court for sentencing on Friday after they pleaded guilty to affray. A video compilation of their behaviour on the night of June 26 and the early hours of June 27, 2020, showed individual members throwing lit fireworks and other missiles, attacking police vehicles, fighting in the street, and at one point climbing all over a Greggs lorry which had been brought to a halt on a city centre street.\nEach of the defendants were defended by their own counsel at the sentencing hearing, with the exception of Browne who chose not to be represented. They accepted responsibility and expressed remorse on behalf of their clients for the part they had played in the disorder that night, and blamed their actions on excessive drinking.\nRecorder Mr David Knifton QC said: \"The evening of June 26, 2020, should have been a proud day for many in this city, as Liverpool FC achieved a prize which had eluded them for 30 years, being crowned Premier League champions. Despite the strict Covid lockdown restrictions in place at that time, large crowds gathered illegally at the Pier Head on that day.\n\"By the evening, a 1,000-strong crowd had gathered, intoxicated and jumping on to the traffic. Officers attempted to disperse the crowd, but many were intent on remaining. The mood had changed from high-spirited celebration to a violent and angry scene.\n\"This was a case of serious or sustained violence which left people in severe fear or distress. Some were left hiding in doorways crying, attempting to avoid missiles being thrown.\n\"Each individual act of violence or disorder inflames or encourages others. Anyone engaging in mob violence must expect severe sentences to deter others. In my judgement your offences were so serious that nothing other than a custodial sentence can suffice.\"\nGibney, of St Paul's Close, Kirkby, was sentenced to 24 months' imprisonment, plus another 10 months for a separate offence of dangerous driving. Mallon, of Broad Lane, Kirkby, who is already serving a sentence for a separate offence of wounding, was given 18 months' detention in a young offenders institute, to be served in addition to his current five-year sentence.\nAhmed, of Fairfield Street, Kensington, who appeared by videolink from prison, was sentenced to 21 months plus another four for breach of a suspended sentence. Browne, of Kirkburn Close, Toxteth, was sentenced to 21 months' imprisonment, while Rowson, of Shaftesbury Avenue, Kirkby, was sentenced to 24 months' imprisonment.\nClare Roughley\nA scammer who stole hundreds of thousands from her family left her dad saddled with a mortgage he didn’t ask for just as he started his retirement.\nClare Roughley subjected her parents, grandparents and a woman she cared for to a vile campaign of theft over a number of years. The former bank employee was jailed back in October after admitting to using her insider knowledge to steal £325,000 from those who were supposed to trust her.\nShe set up online access to the accounts of her dad, Raymond Roughley, her mum, Delyn Roughley, and her nan, Theresa Leyland. Over a number of years, she drained their life savings to fund her escalating gambling addictions, as well as stealing thousands from a woman she was caring for.\nIn June, the 40 year old was back before a judge at Liverpool Crown Court to be sentenced for mortgage fraud carried out during the same period. Peter Hussey, prosecuting, told the court that during 2015 and 2016, the same period she was stealing from her parents, Roughley applied for and then took out a mortgage in her father’s name to buy the home where her and her partner were living.\nRoughley, who is already serving a lengthy prison term for the offences she was sentenced for last year, admitted mortgage fraud. She was sentenced to another 38 months in prison. However, that will be served concurrently with her other jail terms and means it will not affect her projected release from jail on licence in autumn 2024.\nJohn Kirk\nA drunken cocaine-fuelled thug’s homemade petrol bomb exploded mid-air as he tried to take “revenge” against a nightspot that wouldn’t let him in. Convicted heroin supplier John Kirk, 34, launched the attack at Chambers bar on High Street in Runcorn in the early hours of Sunday, March 6, after being barred entry to Chambers and Alchemy on the same street earlier that night.\nDoor staff at Alchemy bar had turned Kirk away at 10.30pm on Saturday, March 5, after seeing him argue with staff at another pub earlier on. Kirk, who later told his probation officer he had been drinking alcohol and had snorted a line of cocaine, responded by making “rude comments” and shouting abuse at door staff and bar workers.\nJust over an hour and a half later he tried to enter Chambers but was rejected by the same staff. He became aggressive but appeared to agree when police intervened to get him to go home. However, he then filled an empty Pepsi bottle with fuel from a nearby Petrol station and launched the lit missile towards the doorman. Luckily, it exploded before reaching him.\nKirk, of The Hove, Murdishaw, Runcorn, pleaded guilty to one count of attempted arson with intent to endanger life. He was jailed for four years and 10 months.\nKarl McDonough\nA burglar conned his way into an elderly couple’s home and stole thousands of pounds of jewellery by telling them he was a police officer investigating a previous break in.\nKarl McDonough targeted Jean and Francis Hampson at their home in Everton early last year, stealing a “lifetime’s worth of jewellery” from Mrs Hampson. McDonough cruelly suggested he was there to take photos to help catch the previous burglar yet he then rifled through a cupboard and found her jewellery box.\nWhen the couple began to suspect him him he pushed past them and ran off into the street with many of her valuables. The court heard the Hampsons' Everton address had been targeted by burglars before and McDonough used information about that crime to gain their trust before managing to steal Mrs Hampson's jewellery box.\nIn a statement, she said she had also lost every piece of jewellery given to her by her husband, who has sadly since died. McDonough, formerly of the YMCA on Great Crosshall Street, was jailed for three years and nine months. A restraining order will also prevent him from contacting Mrs Hampson.\nJames McGowan\nA drug dealer doused a woman in petrol from a Lucozade bottle before she went up in flames.\nJames McGowan threatened to set Kelly Quinn alight when she asked for drugs while already in debt. The 24-year-old thug then hit her over the head with an iron bar.\nProsecutors said conflicting accounts of what happened next meant they couldn't be sure if McGowan set her ablaze. But after weeks in a coma, she remembered waking up covered in bandages like an Egyptian \"mummy\".\nMs Quinn visited her drug dealer's flat on Southport's Derby Road on Boxing Day to try to get drugs but McGowan and his girlfriend Holly McCarthy later came round and argued with her over a debt. McCarthy hit Ms Quinn and McGowan, who had previously threatened to \"set her alight\", doused her in petrol.\nMs Quinn then left but the petrol, which is believed to have been ignited during the lighting of a cigarette, burned her seriously and put her in a coma.\nHe told McGowan: \"Your intention must have been to terrify your victim in order to bring her into line.\" Jailing him for two years and 10 months, the judge said: \"I accept you did not set her on fire but you must have realised by pouring petrol on someone who smokes serious harm was foreseeable - there was a risk of serious harm occurring and it did occur.\"\nMcGowan's girlfriend, Holly McCarthy, also admitted common assault and was handed an 18-month community order, with a 15-day Rehabilitation Activity Requirement and 28-day home curfew in February.\nClaire Newman\nA mum stabbed two security guards as they tried to stop her stealing children’s clothes from a Next shop in Liverpool.\nClaire Newman slashed David Bailey with a Stanley knife in the chain’s New Mersey Shopping Park store, leaving him needing 20 stitches in his arm.

The pair were not planning to call the police and wanted to take a picture of Newman so that she could be banned from the shop. However, after initially following them Newman became aggressive and agitated.\nMr Duffy said: “She shouted that she would stab David Bailey and it transpired that she had a Stanley knife on her person and she stabbed Mr Bailey, causing him a nasty injury on his forearm.” Newman also caused a scratch on Mr Bailey’s jaw and bit his other arm. In the scuffle, she also caught Mr Grogan with the knife,.\nNewman later admitted wounding Mr Bailey with intent and wounding Mr Grogan without intent. She also pleaded guilty to theft and possession of a bladed article. Newman, of HMP Styal, was jailed for six years and five months.\nHelena Robertson\nA woman who was banned from lying in the road in 2019 is back behind bars after threatening to smash up a woman’s house.\nHelena Robertson, 45, of no fixed abode but from Runcorn, appeared at Warrington Magistrates’ Court following the offence. She pleaded guilty to “shouting and swearing” at her victim in breach of a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO), threatening to smash up the woman’s house, and failing to comply with her supervision.\nCourt papers said she was sentenced to 38 weeks in prison and ordered to pay a £156 surcharge, with the conviction regarded as “serious” because the “offence occurred in someone’s home having been invited in”, was committed during post-sentence supervision and due to her criminal record.\nThe incident took place in Runcorn. Robertson was made subject to a five-year CBO intended to curb her antisocial antics in May 2019 following a litany of nuisance behaviour.\nGraham Handlon\nA depraved dad begged undercover police to send him twisted pics and said: \"I'm 100% paedo.\"\nGraham Handlon thought he was talking to a fellow pervert online. But the 49-year-old was really chatting to a covert officer - just months after the deviant was previously spared jail for having a stash of sick images. The dad-of-two revealed he had bought an unregistered pay as you go phone \"for all my paedo\".\nAnd he boasted: \"There's no limits with me. I'm just a dirty c***, I’m just into everything. Everything and anything what goes. You know what I mean?\"\nLiverpool Crown Court heard Handlon, of Park Crescent, Southport, was handed a two-year community order in January 2020, after he was caught with child rape images. He was given a five-year Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO).\nOn November 30 that year he messaged the officer on web forum ChatIW stating \"Hi m 47 peD north west no limits\" and using the profile name \"Bipedlknforbiped\". Jamie Baxter, prosecuting, said: \"Perhaps bi-sexual paedophile looking for another bi-sexual paedophile, if that's what bi-ped stands for.\"\nHandlon sent him indecent photos and videos before claiming he \"did\" a girl when she was two. He sent more photos, boasting he had \"100s\", and asked the officer if he had any photos of his 11-year-old daughter - who the officer pretended to have sexually abused.\nThe officer said he was \"cautious\" who he shared images with, but Handlon replied: \"I understand that bud, I’m 100% paedo bud.\" To prove his claims he sent more images and added: \"I have vids too.\"\nHe sent three child rape videos to the officer, plus a video of himself performing a sex act. Police tracked his phone and found CCTV footage of him buying a top up voucher at the Spar in Roe Lane, Southport on November 7, 2020.\nOfficers raided his home on January 25, 2021. He handed over a phone and laptop, but didn't produce his Alba mobile, which was discovered hidden inside a plastic bag in his letterbox.\nHe admitted three counts of downloading, three counts of distributing and one count of possessing indecent images of children, plus possessing extreme porngraphy and breaching his SHPO. A judge jailed him for three years and 10 months. He made a new 15-year SHPO and told Handlon to sign on the Sex Offenders Register for life.\nLauren Blaney\nA mum ransacked her neighbour’s home then tried to hide from police behind a bin.\nLauren Blaney “trashed” the house on Handfield Road while on bail for doing almost exactly the same thing to her ex-boyfriend’s house months earlier. The 30 year old overturned a fish tank, stole a TV and smashed up numerous rooms during the bizarre incident last summer.\nZahra Baqri, prosecuting, said Blaney’s then neighbour returned to his home during the afternoon of June 17, 2021. She said the front door was locked as normal but that he found the rooms inside “trashed”.\nBlaney was later seen running down the street and tried to hide from police behind a bin but was arrested later the same day and admitted burglary. Blaney’s victim suffered financial losses of around £1,000 due to the burglary.\nThe court heard her offending was driven by drug and alcohol abuse. Jailing Blaney for 12 months, Judge Anil Murray appealed to her to continue with efforts to address her addiction issues while in prison.\nOlivia Kamara\nA drug dealer was found hiding in a bathroom with more than 150 wraps of crack cocaine and heroin during a house raid.\nOlivia Kamara had a previous similar conviction and Liverpool Crown Court heard on Monday, June 6 that she had not long been released from prison when she was caught again. The 26-year-old was found with Class A drugs after police raided a house on Lovely Lane in Warrington on the morning of September 9 last year.\nPolice raided the house after spotting another woman, Louise Butler, involved in a drugs transaction in Lovely Lane. Butler went back into the house on Lovely Lane where she was living with her \"abusive and bullying\" partner.\nAfter a few minutes she re-emerged and walked towards Colin Street, reportedly to meet a drugs customer. But Butler was intercepted by police and wrestled to the ground. She then spat out five wraps of drugs.\nPolice then found Kamara was hiding in a the house with more drugs. She admitted possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply and was jailed for four years three months. Butler was sentenced to 23 months imprisonment but suspended it for two years\nJohn Stanley\nA man tricked a teen on a night out into getting in his car then drove her to a flat, locked her in and pinned her to the bed by her throat.\nJohn Stanley targeted the 17-year-old in Liverpool city centre back in 2018. After telling the victim, who the ECHO has chosen not to name, that he needed help getting home, the former taxi driver launched an attack which a judge today said would “send a chill down the spine” of girls and women in the city.\nStanley, now 35, protested his innocence for years but is now behind bars after a jury at Liverpool Crown Court saw through his lies.\nHis trial heard Stanley manipulated the girl, coaxing her into his car and asking her to drive him home, crying when she said she couldn’t do so. She eventually agreed to get in his car with her friend and the other man, to try to help him. However, Stanley then drove off, letting the girl’s friend and the other man out the car.\nMr Gibson said that once they were alone Stanley’s mood changed dramatically and he became aggressive. He refused to drive the girl home and instead took her to another house he was renting and said he would call a taxi.\nThe teen tried to contact a friend for help but didn’t know where she was being taken. When Stanley parked the car she refused to get out and asked him to call her a taxi outside but he grabbed her by the head and dragged her into the flat, throwing her against a wall in the process.\nAfter pinning her down and choking her on a bed she managed to escape by hitting him with a high heel and running out of the property. Stanley was jailed for 11 years after being found guilty of false imprisonment.\nAlan Underwood\nA burglar’s campaign of harassment against a shop owner forced the man to sell his shop and move home.\nAlan Underwood burgled Prescot Mobiles & Computer Services back in 2019, causing around £1,000 damage to the shop in the process. Yet when owner Shakir Ur Rehman recognised Underwood on CCTV and challenged him about the burglary Underwood threatened him and terrorised his shop for weeks.\nThe 40 year old’s campaign against Mr Rehman came before he launched a sickening attack on another shop worker in Prescot, throwing scalding hot coffee at her. Underwood, of HMP Altcourse, was jailed for three years. A restraining order will also prevent him from contacting the shop owner for seven years.\nTyrone Grimes\nA drug dealer who hid 58 wraps of crack and heroin in his bum said he strayed into peddling Class As to cope with having to pay for his mum’s funeral.\nTyrone Grimes, 25, was arrested by police after they spotted him carry out a suspected drug deal in the Widnes on May 11 this year. Paul Wood, prosecuting at Liverpool Crown Court on Thursday, said officers pulled over a Citroen Berlingo on Hale Road and arrested the driver, Grimes, who “tried to struggle”.\nThe officer also seized a “burner” phone from Grimes’s pocket. At Cheshire Police’s northern custody suite, officers strip-searched Grimes.\nGrimes was recalled to prison on licence after his arrest in Widnes, and pleaded guilty at Chester Magistrates’ Court on May 12 to two counts of possession with intent to supply a Class A drug, namely heroin and crack cocaine, and one of acquiring or using criminal property.\nGrimes was initially charged with assaulting an emergency worker in relation to his arrest in Widnes on May 11 but the count was ordered to lie on file on Thursday. He was jailed for three years and four months in prison. The sentence had been reduced by a third from five years to reflect credit for Grimes’s guilty pleas.\nCraig Walker\nA drug dealer told police the drug bags found in his house were “to hold chicken nuggets”.\nCraig Walker’s bizarre attempts to get out trouble came as he was caught by police with 70 wraps of crack cocaine down his trousers just weeks after being released from jail. A judge at Liverpool Crown Court warned him he was at risk of wasting his life if he didn’t stop dealing Class A drugs to fund his own addiction.\nAnthony O’Donohoe, prosecuting, said police spotted Walker, 30, during a suspected drug deal on the edge of the city centre on May 17, 2020. The car turned off Angela Street and into Pennygate Close and after seeing someone get in the car to buy drugs police stopped the vehicle.\nHe appeared to have something down his trousers and was later found to have wraps of 70 wraps of crack cocaine. When asked by police about drugs bag in his house, Walker told them they were to hold chicken nuggets.\nHe later admitted possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and was jailed for four years.\nClaire McGlone\nTwo sisters moved kilos of class A drugs and tens of thousands in cash across the country as part of a major drugs conspiracy.\nAmy and Claire McGlone used the handle “Moodyalpha” to take instructions on couriering cocaine, heroin, cannabis from Merseyside to destinations across the UK. Police who arrested the pair found a massive drugs “hide” in their Mazda, while the hacking of the Encrochat network revealed the full extent of their criminality.\nNicola Daley, prosecuting, said the sisters worked together, passing the Encro phone from one to the other as they both took instructions from their boss, “secretgold” during the spring of 2020. It is unclear when exactly the McGlones, neither of whom have any previous convictions, became involved in dealing drugs.\nHowever, a stream of messages show the pair were ferrying drugs to and from Merseyside throughout April and May of that year. They were stopped by police in South Wales on May 20, 2020 and later admitted conspiracy to supply Class A drugs.\nThe court heard there was no evidence the women or their families were living “a lavish lifestyle” as a result of drug dealing, with Amy McGlone’s financial situation appearing to be particularly bad. Ms Daley said they appeared to be paid only a few hundred pounds for each trip.\nClaire McGlone was jailed for four years and nine months and Amy McGlone was jailed for four years and six months.\nCallum Unsworth\nCallum Unsworth was jailed at Liverpool Crown Court for the brutal robbery of a man in Southport.

The victim had been at a bar in the town centre and gone to get money from a cash machine but as he went to take it Unsworth came up behind him and took the cash, pushing the man to the floor.\nBernice Campbell, prosecuting, told the court the man’s knee was injured in the process and his glasses were broken in the robbery, which saw 23-year-old Unsworth run off with £30. Unsworth was later arrested and admitted robbery.\nUnsworth, of no fixed abode, for two and a half years but said he believed the circumstances of his earlier years had made him more vulnerable to crime.\nMartin Grant\nMartin Grant, 33, was jailed for over 14 years on Friday, June 10, after Liverpool Crown Court heard he began using an EnroChat phone shortly after he was released from prison on licence. Grant, a father-of-two originally from Old Swan, specialised in high quality cocaine imported from Bolivia.\nPolice were able to link Grant to the EncroChat handle SwiftOrchid after they identified pictures of his home on the device. Grant, who lived in the Southport area, sent pictures of a bouncy castle on the device.\nBen Jones, prosecuting, said Grant acted as a \"wholesale broker\" and distributed Class A drugs to the midlands, Lancashire and Carlisle area. Last week the court heard how Grant's younger brother Liam used the Encro handle Beigepalm to supply cannabis. Liam Grant was jailed for four years and six months during an earlier hearing.\nMr Jones told the court Grant had previous convictions for vehicle taking, blackmail, handling stolen goods, section 18 wounding and possession of an offensive weapon. Grant had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine, conspiracy to supply heroin, conspiracy to supply amphetamine and conspiracy to supply cannabis.\nPaul Munro\nA paedophile who sent messages saying he wanted to have sex with teenage girls told police “I’ve been silly again” after he was confronted outside his home.\nPaul Munro sent vile messages to a chatroom account he thought was run by a 13 year old. But the 47 year old, from Oxton, was actually revealing his sexual interest in children to an adult who then handed them over to the police.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard Monroe sent a series of messages to accounts run by a member of a vigilante group. He sent the messages only months after a community order handed to him for a previous offence ended.\nA judge labelled Munro, of Woodchurch Road, a danger to young girls as he jailed him for four years with another six on extended licence.\nMichael Doyle\nA drug dealer who plotted the transfer of kilos of Class A drugs was found with a vacuum sealed block of cocaine in a cupboard in his house.\nMichael Doyle directed the movement of large amounts of cocaine, heroin and amphetamine throughout the first half of 2020. The Bickerstaffe dad was jailed earlier this week after an investigation laid bare his criminality.\nPolice were able to link Doyle to the transfer of 7kgs of cocaine, though there were messages alluding to larger deals which were not concluded. Other messages showed Doyle’s interest in bringing drugs in from the Netherlands and transferring millions of euros to South America.\nDoyle, of Heyescroft, was jailed for 12 years.\nPaul Shaw\nA paedophile sent 100 messages a day to Facebook accounts he thought were run by a young teen.\nPaul Shaw thought he was speaking to a 13-year-old girl when he sent messages saying he would make her “feel tingles” if they met. But the 61-year-old grandad from Bootle was actually speaking to a vigilante who later confronted him and handed the messages to the police.\nThe court member of the group No More Silent Voices had set up a Facebook profile posing as a 13-year-old and received a friend request from Shaw. She then began receiving increasing numbers of messages from him.\nShaw continued to message the account and said he would have sex with the girl and asked her to masturbate for him. Like Paul Munro, he was caught after members of the vigilante group went to his house and police were called.\nShaw, of Aylward Place, was jailed for two years and eight months.\nDean Potter\nTwo drug dealers are back behind bars after one gave the other a lift home from prison despite them being banned from associating with each other.\nCheshire Police said Dean Potter, 24, and Callum Pope, 22, were slapped with Criminal Behaviour Orders (CBO) in 2019 in a bid to curb their “repeated involvement” in antisocial behaviour, selling drugs and threatening behaviour in the town. Despite this, at 10am on Friday Potter picked up Pope from HMP Risley in Warrington after his release from prison to drive him back to Runcorn.\nPope was jailed for eight months and told to pay a £156. Potter was given six months in prison and must pay a £128 surcharge.\nFollowing the sentencing Chief Inspector Andrew Blizard, of Runcorn Local Policing Unit, said: “It is beyond belief that Pope would breach the terms of his CBO within minutes of being released from prison by getting a lift home from Potter.\n“The pair were well aware that they were banned from associating with each other, yet they chose to get into a car together. As a result of that action both of the men are now behind bars.”\nLewis Lally\nA man riding an e-bike fled to France after ploughing into a six-year-old girl, and leaving his victim seriously injured in the street.\nLewis Lally, 24, had a suspended prison sentence hanging over him when he drove \"at full pelt\" into a six-year-old girl on Windsor Road, Tuebrook, on March 4 this year.

The defendant stored the footage on his laptop, where an IT company uncovered his stash in December 2020.\nThe court heard Campbell was \"distraught\" when probed on the videos - and immediately admitted his guilt. However, David Watson, prosecuting, read out a number of statements from his numerous victims, who are still traumatised after footage of them was used for the defendant's own \"sexual gratification\".\nCampbell, of New Heys Drive, was jailed for eight months.\nSarah Campbell\nA mum sexually abused a 15 year old boy for months and eventually gave birth to his child.\nSarah Campbell had sex with her victim on a golf course and under a blanket while others were sleeping in the same room. The mum, now 40, would also ply the boy with cocaine and cannabis so they would “get off their barnets” together as part of her sordid plot to make him her “sexual play thing” between 2016 and 2017.\nMartine Snowdon, prosecuting, said Campbell started grooming the boy and abusing him for the first time in 2016. She said they had sex multiple times and that she would offer him drugs. Ms Snowdon said: “They would “get off their barnets” regularly, as [the victim] put it, smoking cannabis and taking cocaine provided by her.”\nMs Snowdon said Campbell would try to avoid social services and others finding the boy by getting him to sneak into her house at odd times of day and hide. She then fell pregnant with a child later determined to be his and was charged with multiple sexual offences against him.\nCampbell was found guilty after a trial earlier this year and was jailed for nine and a half years on Tuesday.\nDarren Nelson\nA drug dealer bragged he had a key worker in his gang who transported illicit packages during lockdown.\nDarren Nelson, of Whitfield Road, Walton, bragged about Virgin Media worker, Robert Wood's freedom to roam, a court heard.

He moved cocaine around North Wales, while other consignments were brought by other gang members.\nBut police breached their EncroChat messages - on which the conspirators used handles including Powerwhale and Excellent Wolf - and officers seized drugs from properties and vehicles.\nAll of the people involved admitted conspiring to supply a controlled drug of Class A - cocaine - and conspiring to supply a controlled drug of Class B - cannabis resin. Nelson and Wood's sentences included their part in a Liverpool gang's offences.\nNelson, 32, of Whitfield Road, Walton, was jailed for 15 years and nine months.

The 48-year-old took over the illegal enterprise from his twin brother Keith Hill, of Ridgemoor Road, Leominster, who himself is currently serving a nine-year jail sentence.\nWest Mercia Police said the brothers were at the pinnacle of the organisation, and it's estimated that they distributed in excess of a kilo of cocaine. The police operation managed to gather significant mobile phone evidence which implicated Hill, with him pleading guilty and receiving a reduced sentence.\nHill was sentenced to nine years in jail for supplying cocaine and possessing offensive weapons on Monday, June 13 at Worcester Crown Court.\nJonathan Gordon\nA dangerous and ruthless hitman behind a string of shootings was jailed for life after launching a bottle of acid into a dad's face for money - leaving him with permanent injuries.\nKnown Deli Mob gang member Jonathan Gordon, 34, offered his services on the encrypted EncroChat phone network using the handle 'ValuedBridge', and was hired by an unidentified gang boss behind the handle 'AceProspect' to carry out sickening attacks on several enemies.

Mr Deakin remains in a constant battle to keep his sight, and even required emergency surgery this week due to complications from the attack three years on.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard as well as being convicted of the near-blinding of Mr Deakin, Gordon was also convicted of two plots to carry out similar attacks that were aborted at the last stage, plus a spate of shootings including two running gun battles on the streets of Liverpool.\nJudge Aubrey said Gordon's \"extreme dangerousness\" and lack of remorse meant a life-sentence was needed to protect the public. Gordon was handed a minimum term of 24 years and eight months before any possibility of being released by a Parole Board.\nGordon’s accomplice, Dylan Johnston, was handed a lengthy extended sentence of 27 years in prison with an additional four on licence. Stephen Wissett, who drove the car during the attack, was sentenced to 12 years in prison, of which he must serve two thirds before being released on licence.\nMichael Wilde\nA former teacher, who sexually assaulted boys at the school where he taught for 38 years, was put back in jail for a fifth time.\nMichael Wilde, 73, was first jailed in 2015 after two of his victims came forward, which led to three more revealing their ordeals at his hands for which he was again sent to prison. Liverpool Crown Court heard on Wednesday, June 15, how Wilde was jailed again in 2019 and 2020 after another two former pupils of Wade Deacon High School in Widnes came forward.\nThe latest victim revealed what Wilde had done to him when he was aged between 11 and 14 in the 1970's while police were speaking to him about an unrelated matter in 2020.\nWilde, a granddad, of Drake Close, Burtonwood and Westbrook in Warrington, pleaded guilty to three offences of indecent assault and was sentenced to two years behind bars.

When she asked him to stop, “he refused” and assaulted her again. The abuse came to light when the child’s mother heard her using “inappropriate language”, and she then said what had happened.\nIt was reported to the victim’s school. In voluntary interview with Cheshire Police, Jennings denied what took place and any “sexual interest in children”.\nThat lie was left in tatters when a search of his two phones revealed 10 Category A abuse images - the most serious type and including one of a girl of about 10 years of age “in distress” being raped, 10 Category B and 178 Category C.\nRecorder Mark Ford sentenced Jennings to four years in prison, and placed him on a Sexual Harm Prevention Order and the sex offenders register, both for life or until further notice.\nSteven Bragger\nA vile bully stamped on his girlfriend’s head and hit her with a bag that had a drill in it.\nSteven Bragger also punched the woman in the face in front of her horrified friends, leaving her with a split lip.

The 71-year-old has spent most of his life in prison after committing a series of sexual assaults against women and girls.\nA judge said his pattern of predatory behaviour posed a risk to young children as he jailed him.\nMartine Snowdon, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court he was first reported after lurking in the arts and crafts aisle in Wilko’s in September last year. A ten-year-old, shopping with her parents and sister, wandered away from them and was discovered by her sister close to Foster, who had brushed past her. Ms Snowdon said: “The defendant had said to her “are you sure, are you shy, do you want a kiss?’”\nDays later, in Home Bargains, he targeted a three-year-old girl, telling her to rub his genitals over his trousers. That girl also told her family what had happened and while shop staff were checking the CCTV Foster tried to kidnap another child. He located an eight-year-old in a different part of the shop and asked her if she wanted to “come and play” and told her he would give her some money if she did so.\nHe quickly fled after realising he was under suspicion - but was arrested after he returned at a later date.\nFoster, of no fixed abode, was jailed for nine and a half years, with another four and a half years on extended licence.\nAlan Dreha\nA man who subjected a child to 11 years of sexual assault has now been brought to justice.\nAlan Dreha, 70, of Hanmer Road, Kirkby, abused his victim between 1990 and 2001.

We are also working to remove those who have been exploited by these groups, to give them a choice and a chance to make a different life for themselves.”\nDavid Byron\nA gangland debt collector was locked up for dodging penalty points in a speeding ticket scam.\nDad-of-three David Byron, 44, schemed with dodgy car rental business owner Benjamin Rood, 41, to swerve fixed penalty notices after being caught speeding in August 2016 and February 2017. Byron, of Longfellow Close, Kirkby, was driving Land Rover vehicles leased by Rood's franchise, 4x4 Hire Liverpool, on both occasions.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard that as the rental vehicles were registered to Rood's business, he was obliged by law to provide the details of the driver. However, rather than Byron simply taking the points and paying the fine, WhatsApp messages recovered from Rood's phone revealed extensive conversations about nominating a \"fall-guy\".\nThat resulted in two men, Barry Sissons and James Ryan, being convicted of speeding in magistrates' court and each being handed six penalty points and fines ranging between £600 and £900. James Rae, prosecuting, told the court that Rood and several other men had been jailed for money laundering and conspiring to pervert the course of justice in May, but Byron had not been involved in their wider offending.\nDuring an investigation into Rood, the WhatsApp messages were obtained by police, and Byron later pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, while asking for the 2016 incident to be taken into consideration by the court. Mr Rae said Byron also had a previous conviction for a similar offence, which saw him handed a suspended sentence in August 2012.\nByron was jailed for 10 months, and will be eligible for release on licence at the half-way stage.\nJohn Digweed\nA \"proud dad\" was unmasked as Encrochat dealer \"Diorpaw\" who moved 40kgs of Class A drugs in just a few months.\nJohn Digweed used the Encrochat services to organise the supply cocaine and heroin during the spring of 2020.

Murphy denied he was in the street at the time, claiming he was \"off me head\" on ketamine and cannabis in a garden in another area of Huyton.\nBut he was faced with overwhelming evidence, including a pair of black gloves, bearing traces of gunshot residue and his DNA profile, found on top of a kitchen cupboard in his home. CCTV evidence also put him in the area of the killing at the time.\nMurphy was convicted of murder after a trial at Liverpool Crown Court alongside his close friend Ben Doyle, now 25, who rode the electric bike, carrying Murphy on the back, to within minutes of the murder scene.

The court heard she refused to do so and the atmosphere in the house became increasingly tense before she drank heavily then lit a fire in a bedroom.\nChapman, of Hillside Avenue, Huyton, was jailed for 20 months. A five year restraining order also prevents her from contacting Mr Lowe.\nMichael Strange\nA thug who attacked a woman has become one of the first in the country to be jailed for the offence of non-fatal strangulation.\nMichael Strange, 33, of Nortonwood Lane, Windmill Hill, Runcorn, was sent down at North Cheshire Magistrates’ Court in Warrington.

However, he is already serving a prison sentence and the new sentence will not affect his release date.\nKarl Townsend\nA killer who stabbed a burglar to death was jailed for 19 years.\nJordan Brophy was attacked with such ferocity that two shards of a broken blade were left lodged in his skull. He died aged 31 as a result of his injuries following the incident in Halewood in October last year.\nKarl Townsend was cleared of his murder by a jury of six men and six women. However, he was convicted of manslaughter by a majority of 10 to two.\nJudge Andrew Menary handed him 19 years, describing the attack as a \"deliberate and armed response to an attempt to steal his drugs\". Townsend must serve two thirds of this term before he is released on licence.\nSentencing, the Honourary Recorder of Liverpool said: \"On that night, soon after you had left and while your partner and child were out of the house, the deceased Jordan Brophy and three other accomplices broke into your house. This was plainly a targeted attack - a smash and grab where the burglars were not concerned about making a noise and plainly did not expect to be in the house for very long.\n\"I have no doubt that they were after your stash of controlled drugs, because I have no doubt that at that time your principal source of income was dealing in class A and B drugs. No other explanation makes any sense.\n\"What that means is this was not a home invasion with a terrified and unsuspecting householder. As soon as you saw these men on the camera, you knew exactly what they were after.\n\"What resulted is the sort of violent encounter which so often accompanies this type of criminal activity. You were provoked by Jordan Brophy's actions, but your response was not in any way justified.\n\"I also find as fact that Jordan Brophy was not armed with any weapon while in the house, and in particular was not armed with a knife. He did not expect a confrontation that night.\n\"Equally, I find that none of the burglars had a gun. That is an embellishment invented by you.\n\"The verdict of the jury means that they could not be sure that when delivering a fatal blow, you intended to kill or cause serious harm. But on any view, the level of unlawful violence used by you was shocking.\n\"In a matter of seconds and without any delay, after entering the property you stabbed Jordan Brophy multiple times to the head, face and arms. Mr Brophy attempted to protect himself, but stood no chance.\n\"He tried to flee the scene but was caught again by you in the street, where you used the remains of the blade to stab him repeatedly in the neck. The notion that you were at any stage acting in reasonable self-defence is frankly absurd.\n\"Jordan Brophy was no angel. But whatever he was doing on the night, he did not deserve to die as he did.\n\"He was a loved and cherished son, brother, partner and uncle. Their lives have been damaged irreparably.\n\"This is an especially bad case of manslaughter. Mr Brophy was killed in the course of a series of unlawful attacks which must have involved an intention by you to cause harm falling just short of grievous bodily harm.\n\"You express remorse for what you did and the loss of life involved. I hope that is genuine.\"\nGerald Cole\nA stalker called his ex an average of 325 times a day during a campaign of threats and harassment against her.\nGerald Cole told the woman he would throw acid in her face and burn her house down over the course of weeks of abuse as he called her from inside prison. A judge told him he was convinced he had no remorse and showed no acceptance of the trauma he had inflicted on the “emotionally unstable and vulnerable” woman.\nCole was serving a jail term for assaulting the woman when he called her thousands of times over the space of a few weeks, threatening her multiple times. Cole was jailed for 16 months and a restraining order prevents him from contacting the victim.\nDarren Baptiste\nA mum was confronted by a masked gang of robbers brandishing a machete during a terrifying break in.\nThe woman had a second knife held to her face and believed the raiders were also armed with a gun.

They had smashed a window at the rear of the property and climbed through in order to gain access.\nOne of these invaders was armed with a machete, while the other was carrying a flick knife. They demanded cash and took £300 which she had been saving for her children's Christmas presents.\nBut the pair demanded more, believing there was a \"substantial sum\" of up to £50,000 in the house, which they \"ransacked\". The knifeman pressed the blade into her cheek as he threatened her, causing a cut.\nShe also believed a third offender had been armed with a gun. The court heard that she and Baptiste - of Burnard Crescent, Kirkby - had previously been in a relationship, although he denies this.\nBaptiste was jailed for 14 years.\nDaniel Kelly\nA gang took nearly £40,000 in cash after raiding seven convenience stores in the space of just over a month.\nThe Liverpool-based organised crime group targeted Co-op shops across the North West, arming themselves with \"heavy duty\" tools and breaking in after the premises has closed for the day.

The money stolen during all seven burglaries totalled £38,487.\nCarroll and Kelly were linked to the crimes by automatic number plate recognition cameras and mobile phone cell siting data. The former had acted as a getaway driver and had only been involved in two of the offences.\nll three defendants admitted conspiracy to commit burglary, while Hollywood also pleaded guilty to possession of criminal property. He was jailed for 40 months, while Kelly was locked up for 45 months.\nCarroll received 28 months behind bars.\nAndrew Holland\nA sick paedophile locked a 14-year-old girl in his attic and sexually abused her.\nAndrew Holland's victim was branded a liar after police dropped their initial investigation into the child molester.

He worked with other criminals, two of whom have already been jailed.\nHawkes, of Valerian Road in Claughton, was jailed for 11 and a half years.\nKeelie Murphy\nA woman \"infatuated\" with her childhood best friend began harassing her again as soon as she was released from prison.\nKeelie Murphy has previously been locked up three times for obsessively pestering Gemma Ellison. But after being freed from jail, she immediately resumed her campaign of harassment - bombarding the mum's workplace with constant phone calls which caused the family business to grind to a halt.\nThe pair had been friends since the age of 10 but the relationship \"soured\" after Murphy, from Woolton, \"developed an infatuation\" with Ms Ellison. The two had not spoken for many years, but got back in touch during 2017.\nBut in 2020, the 36-year-old was convicted of harassment and handed a restraining order barring her from contacting her former pal or attending her Widnes-based company Ellison Motors for five years. And Murphy, of Halewood Place, has repeatedly flouted this ban since.\nHer latest breach of the ban saw her jailed for 30 months - and a judge warned her her prison terms would simply get longer if she continued to reoffend.\nOliver Roughley\nAn evil paedophile sexually abused a boy when he was aged as young as seven and raped him at a water park.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard that the now 24-year-old carried out the abuse over a three-year period when he was in his late teens. Roughley, from St Helens, groomed the boy by buying him presents including toy cars and teddy bears.\nHe also used violence to ensure his silence, including by twisting his arm behind his back. The pervert kept a pair of the child's underwear in his bedroom and messaged him telling him that he loved him.\nRoughley - of Bailey Way in Windlehurst - first assaulted the boy when he was aged seven by touching his penis. He then \"told him not to tell anyone or he would go to jail and never see him again\".\nHis abuse escalated to raping the youngster in the cubicles of a swimming baths in South Liverpool and Splash World in Southport. He was convicted after a trial - and continues to maintain his innocence.

Ben Berkson, prosecuting, told Chester Crown Court a constable set off to intercept the Zafira, which proceeded to tear up the rules of the road.\nMr Berkson said the dangerous actions included “speeding through a red light, performing a dangerous U-turn at speed, straddling double white lines, travelling at 70mph in a 40mph zone, undertaking vehicles which were also on the road, travelling at over 100mph in a 60mph zone, and travelling at 60mph in a narrow residential street with a 30mph limit.” The “prolonged” pursuit ended when the Zafira crashed into a lamp post outside Co-op.\nHe later pleaded guilty at the first opportunity to dangerous driving, criminal damage over a fence he broke while trying to escape, and aggravated vehicle taking in the context of knowing the car was stolen and crashing it into a lamp post. He was handed 16 months in prison.\nChristopher Smith\nA vile man said he \"would like to be there\" after watching a video of a little girl being being sexually abused.\nChristopher Smith, 31, sent messages to paedophile, Vicki Bevan, online and responded to a clip of her abusing a young boy with \"that’s hot\" and to one of her abusing a girl with \"I would like to be there\". Bevan was part of a paedophile ring based in St Helens and carried out some of her appalling sexual fantasies alongside Paul Rafferty and Tony Hutton by raping and abusing a young girl.\nBevan also spent time discussing with another man their desire to “kidnap, rape, torture, kill and then eat children” after sexually abusing them. The vile woman made contact with Smith, who lived 230 miles away, on internet chat rooms before sending at least two clips to him.\nCharlie Barrass-Evans, prosecuting, said Smith was caught by an undercover police operation, where officers posed as chatroom users on Kik. Smith was using the hashtag andysmith01 and offered to \"trade\" child images before being traced through his phone.\nSmith of Clare Drive, Tiverton, Devon, admitted two counts of distribution and four of making, by downloading, indecent images of children and was jailed for two years and four months by Judge Peter Johnson at Exeter Crown Court.\nLeslie Radley-Braithwaite\nA stables worker was jailed after a fight erupted over a dead horse.\nThe scuffle involved a 'vikingologist', a Liverpool FC fan who is banned from matches and his mother-in-law. They all squared off after the aggrieved family barricaded the entrance to the site in Formby.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard on Thursday that Lisa Masterson had seven horses housed at Kentonwood Stables, Freshfield, but one died. Afterwards, there was \"some upset as to the cause of death of the horse\".\nThe 54-year-old also had \"difficulties paying\" and was instructed to find another site to house her animals. The court was told that there had been an unspecified \"incident\" at the stables on August 16 2020.\nMasterson, of Maple Close in Croxteth, returned the following day with family members in tow. They blocked the entrance to the premises with three vehicles, intending to retrieve equipment she owned.\nBut the mum became \"verbally abusive and aggressive\" to staff members, pushing one. Her daughter's 23-year-old boyfriend Sam Lomax, of Camp Road in Woolton, then retrieved a craft knife from his car.\nStables worker Leslie Radley-Braithwaite, of Redgate in Formby, armed himself with two large kitchen knives in response and the arguing \"escalated\". The hearing was played mobile phone footage of part of the dispute, during which Masterson was heard to say \"f*** off, will you get our stuff?\".\nThe police were called, but \"things had calmed down\" by the time officers arrived. Masterson admitted using threatening behaviour and was handed a 12-month community order with 150 hours unpaid work and a rehabilitation activity requirement of up to 20 days.\nLomax pleaded guilty to possession of a bladed article in a public place and possession of cannabis, after a small quantity of the class B drug was found upon him during his arrest. He was given a 10-month imprisonment suspended for 18 months, plus 150 hours of community service and a 10-day rehabilitation activity requirement.\nRadley-Braithwaite admitted affray and two counts of possession of a bladed article in a public place. He was locked up for 10 months.\nConnor Kelly\nThe thug stabbed a sixth form student after flying into a rage at a party.\nConnor Kelly had only recently been handed a suspended sentence for arson when he attacked his victim at a party in Wirral earlier this year. The 22-year-old had an argument with his ex before taking a knife and lunging at his victim, an A-level student who had done nothing to provoke him.\nHe was left with a puncture wound to his left hand as a result. Kelly fled after the attack but was quickly arrested.\nDespite his young age, the knifeman has a slew of convictions - including for robbery. He was jailed for two years.\nPhil Hudson\nThe vile pervert sent his partner a video of himself performing a sex act in front of a young girl.\nPhil Hudson said \"what have I done\" as police stormed his home. Three months after the 33-year-old and the woman broke up, she went to Huyton Police Station and reported his disturbing behaviour.\nHis ex told officers he had \"started to disclose his fantasies and desires around children\". Seven indecent images of children aged as young as eight were discovered on the Pets at Home worker's phone after the raid, as were extreme pornographic images.\nThe video in question, which lasted just over a minute, showed Hudson naked and holding his phone recording the incident. He admitted offences including engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child and was jailed for 27 months.\nJozef Plavnicky\nA biker was left lying on the road with his bone on show after the drunken driver crashed into him.\nJozef Plavnicky, 42, was trying to make an illegal manoeuvre by ignoring a no U-turn sign when his Audi A3 \"jumped forward\" and crashed into a motorbike. Rider Aston Connerty was knocked from his bike and suffered a life-changing injury to his right foot.\nIt was feared he would have to have the foot amputated, but doctors were able to save it. Plavnicky, who works for a bedding company, initially pulled over at the scene at the junction of East Lancashire Road and Back Gilmoss Lane, Fazakerley, but then reversed direction and drove off.\nAbout five minutes later police officers, unaware of the collision, saw him at Randles Farm Interchange with substantial damage to the front offside of his vehicle. They followed the 42-year-old onto the M57, where he was seen swerving and travelling at 45mph on a 70 mph section.\nAfter being pulled over at the end of the motorway, his speech was \"slurred\" and his eyes \"glazed\" and he was found to be more than double the drink driving limit. Plavnicky admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving and was jailed for 34 months.\nMichael Walker\nThe knifeman pulled out a blade in a corner shop before being chased down the street and stabbed in the head with a machete.\nMichael Walker brandished the knife in front of shocked customers, including terrified children, after a row erupted over parking. He produced the \"very large\" weapon from the waistband of his shorts, held it above his head and made a stabbing movement in a downwards motion.\nHis neighbour then attempted to run him over with his car and \"hacked\" at him with the fearsome weapon. The 34-year-old was left with blood \"spurting\" from his head after the incident at the Go Local Extra store on Roughwood Drive in Kirkby.\nWalker admitted affray and possession of a bladed article in a public place. He was jailed for a year.\nThomas Crawford\nThe dealer was found with drugs with a street value of up to £110,000 in a Kirkdale house.\nThomas Crawford's part in the county lines drugs operation to supply cocaine and ketamine was busted when police made the discovery. The raid was carried out as part of Merseyside Police's Project Medusa on July 18, with more than £8,000 in cash also seized.\nThe 28-year-old, of Keithley Walk in Speke, was jailed for six years.\nAnthony Bowden\nThe heroin smuggler was a key member of a major gang run led by \"Jabba the Hutt\".\nThe Merseyside-based organised crime group imported and supplied millions of pounds of class A drugs. Anthony Bowden, one of Jabba's most closely trusted associates, was locked up for 21 years over the ring.\nThis large-scale operation was organised on encrypted communications platform EncroChat. The OCG's boss used a device with the handle JabbaTheHutt as he directed the sale of more than 84kg heroin and 17kg cocaine.\nOf this amount, the gang had been responsible for the importation of more than 20kg of heroin and 4kg of coke. Personal trainer Bowden operated under the handle HyenaJaw and was \"closely trusted\" by the Star Wars-inspired \"head of the operation\", arranging the purchase and sale of drugs \"on a commercial scale\".\nKeenan Fairclough\nA woman was jogging in a park when she was grabbed by the neck from behind and dragged into bushes.\nThe victim was left fearing for her life after Keenan Fairclough placed her in a chokehold and demanded cash while desperate for ketamine. Afterwards, the runner posted about her ordeal on Facebook.\nShe was then messaged by the 21-year-old's step-mum, who was concerned from the description given that he was the culprit. She sent pictures of the defendant, and it was confirmed he had been the attacker.\nThe dad was then caught lurking in the same area again three days later in suspicious circumstances and arrested. Fairclough was jailed for 40 months after admitting attempted robbery.\nPeter Lynch\nThe drug dealer used the pseudonym \"Eager Ape\", had close links to Spain and was involved in the supply of nearly 300kg of cocaine and cannabis.\nPeter Lynch \"entered the big time\" of the criminal underworld after losing his job in the construction industry due to ill health. The dad went on to trade in huge quantities and paid his underlings wages of thousands of pounds every month to carry out illicit activities on his behalf.\nThe 43-year-old deployed encrypted communications platform EncroChat in order to conduct his shady dealings, using the handle EagerApe. This saw him arrange to deal 277kg of cannabis and two kilos of cocaine.\nThe father-of-three had contacts in Spain, with images found on his Encro phone showing drugs being packaged in the country and discussions referencing \"boats being ready for a dummy run\" for the importation of drugs into the UK. Lynch was jailed for seven year and four months after admitting conspiracy to supply cocaine and cannabis.\nLee Ashton\nA man who was stabbed by a gang could have died if he had not been saved by a passing ambulance.\nLee Ashton knifed his victim, who was living in a tent in a park at the time, in the back due to his jealousy that he had begun a new relationship with his former partner. The frightening attack followed a crime spree in which the thug stole firearms during a burglary and robbed a cyclist at gunpoint.\nRobert Bassnett was left with the blade left lodged in his chest cavity after the assault, but happened to be discovered lying injured in the street by paramedics. One emergency services worker said they \"didn't think he would have been able to tolerate that level of blood loss for much longer\".\nAshton then had a friend pick him and his new girlfriend up and asked him to dispose of the clothes he had been wearing as he checked into a hotel. The 23-year-old was found guilty of wounding, and was jailed for eight years.\nJoshua Moorcroft\nThe scammer fraudulently claimed more than £75,000 in bogus travel insurance claims.\nJoshua Moorcroft, from Dovecot, invented reasons for why he was unable to catch the flights to claim huge sums of cash. In October 2019, he took out a multi-trip worldwide travel insurance policy in and submitted a claim for a missed flight from Manchester to New York just nine days later.\nThe conman told his insurer his taxi broke down on the way to the airport due to an exploded tyre. Around two months later, Moorcroft made another claim for a missed flight - this time from Manchester to Qatar, stating he was involved in a car crash on the way to the airport.\nThree false claims were then submitted in February 2020 over missed trips while he was apparently having surgery on a fractured hand. Moorcroft admitted fraud and was jailed for 16 months.\nKenneth Kavanagh\nThe child rapist branded one of his victims a liar as he was jailed for 20 years.\nKenneth Kavanagh raped a seven-year-old boy and sexually assaulted a girl when she was aged as young as six. Decades later, he has finally been brought to justice - but attempted to heckle the woman he abused as a child as she outlined the devastating impact his crimes have had on her.\nThe morbidly obese 74-year-old - who appeared in court via video link to HMP Liverpool in a wheelchair - was heard saying \"money, money, money, money\" at the beginning of the hearing, before being placed on mute. He also shook his head throughout and made hand gestures, including rubbing his thumb against his index finger and middle finger.\nThe pensioner appeared to mouth the word \"liar\" as the victim bravely read a statement to the court. Kavanagh was convicted of seven counts of indecent assault, two of buggery and one of indecency with a child following a trial.\nWilliam Rumsby\nThe paedophile attempted to pin the blame on his own son when he was caught with videos of boys having sex.\nWilliam Rumsby accessed the dark web in order to collect a stash of indecent images of children for the second time and installed a multitude of software on his tablet computer in a bid to cover his tracks. He then told a \"series of lies\" when police came knocking at his door.\nThe pensioner was handed four-month imprisonment suspended for two years and a seven-year sexual harm prevention order in December 2016 after being convicted of possessing and making indecent images of children. But the 71-year-old flouted this SHPO by downloading similar vile materials again.\nRumsby falsely told police that the Samsung device that the pictures and videos were found on belonged to his son. He admitted possession of indecent images, two counts of making indecent images and breaching a sexual harm prevention order and was jailed for 20 months.\nSean Clamp\nThe robber told staff \"I'm a nice guy\" after holding up a bookmakers and a pharmacy armed with a length of pipe which he attempted to pass off as a gun.\nSean Clamp silently handed staff a note bearing the words \"give me money and no-one will get hurt\", while another worker was left so terrified that she fell off her chair. The \"career criminal\" made less than £100 from the two raids, which were both carried out on the same evening.\nIn one, he entered Park Street Pharmacy in Bootle wearing a helmet and handed an employee a note with the words \"give me money and no-one will get hurt\" in capital letters. As he left, he told her: \"I'm not a bad guy.\"\nClamp has a staggering 111 previous convictions for 233 offences. He admitted robbery, attempted robbery and possession of an imitation firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and was jailed for five years.\nMark Woolley\nThe “controlling” domestic violence thug headbutted his partner and broke her nose after demanding “respect” from her and claiming she would “never meet anyone like him”.\nMark Woolley and his partner had been arguing during the weekend of October 29 and she asked him to leave. The 50-year-old told his victim: “You will lose the best thing in your life - you will be on your own forever.”\nHe pressed his head against hers before moving it away briefly then slammed it back against her nose. She was left \"shocked\", while there was \"blood everywhere\".\nWoolley admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was jailed for a year.\nPeter Stevens\nPeter Stevens drove a motorbike at police officers and said \"I smoke yous\" as he sped away from them.\nThe 25-year-old nearly ran over the PCs and pedestrians when he mounted the pavement at speed on a main road. The chase came only days after the convicted drug dealer had been released from prison.\nPatrols ordered Stevens to stop, but he continued to drive at them. The biker \"broke at the last minute, skidded and fishtailed\" - \"almost striking\" the emergency services workers in the process - then delivered his taunt as he attempted to escape.\nThe defendant admitted dangerous driving, driving without a licence, driving without insurance and drug driving and was locked up for 14 months. He told a judge: \"I should have just kept my head down when I got home lad.\"\nDonna Thomas\nA woman who was caught shoplifting the day after she was spared prison has now been jailed.\nDonna Thomas was given a suspended sentence for nine counts of theft and possession a bladed article in a public place in May this year. The following day, the 47-year-old was caught stealing joints of meat and two car battery chargers from the Lidl supermarket on Edge Lane.\nThomas admitted theft and was jailed for eight weeks. Sentencing, Recorder Richard Conley said: \"Yours is a sad case because for 46 years you were a law-abiding person.\n\"Something must have happened to knock your life off the rails. I hope when you come out in a month’s time you will be clean and in a position to stay out of trouble.\"\nColin Chapman\nThe former bus driver accused his girlfriend of spiking his food before biting her on the nose.\nColin Chapman left his partner bloodied and bruised after a \"prolonged and persistent\" drunken attack at the couple's Wirral home, which also saw him knee his victim in the face.\nThe 56-year-old accused her of \"adulterating\" his meal and told her to taste it as he believed there was \"something untoward in it\". He then grabbed hold of her, pulled her to the floor, kneed her and bit her.\nTheir relationship has since ended and she has since moved back to her native Wales to \"start afresh\", having \"packed up and moved to a completely new area\" in order to be with her abuser. Chapman was found guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm after a trial and was jailed for 18 months.\nDean Gorst\nThe drug dealer peddled crack cocaine and heroin from a user’s house.\nPolice raided the property on Milton Road in Widnes town centre on June 9 after receiving “intelligence” in relation to the supply of illicit substances. Inside, officers saw Dean Gorst standing behind the sofa and the tenant Leanne Beneke running into the kitchen.\nA search uncovered 46 wraps of crack cocaine worth £10 each and 56 packages of heroin of the same value. These were spread among “bake boxes” on the living room table, inside Gorst’s coat and behind the sofa. Officers also seized two graft phones and £337 in cash.\nTwo samurai swords found at the property did not result in any charges. Gorst admitted two counts of possession of crack cocaine and heroin with intent to supply and was jailed for three years.\nMichael Conley\nThe drug dealer was caught with cocaine between the cheeks of his backside and claimed it was for personal use.\nFour bags of cocaine were found in Michael Conley's bottom during a strip search by police. He then told the officers.: \"It's for personal use, it's for the weekend\".\nMerseyside Police searched his home on Melling Road, Aintree, where they found 17 more bags of white powder, also identified as cocaine. The overall estimated street value of the cocaine was £2,086, while £772.10 in cash was also seized.\nConley admitted two counts of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply. The 46-year-old was jailed for a year.\nAndrew Evans\nThe \"despicable\" fraudster led his 80-year-old victim to cash machines 150 times in order to steal more than £50,000 from him.\nSerial scammer Andrew Evans posed as a campervan salesman and claimed that he was taking the regular payments to go towards a vehicle which he never provided. The pensioner was left unable to afford to heat his home as a result.\nEvans admitted four counts of fraud during an earlier hearing and was given a further five years behind bars. Sentencing, Judge David Aubrey QC said: \"You took it all, all his life savings.\n\"You fleeced and bled him dry. Just as blood runs through your veins, I regret to say, so does dishonesty and the targeting of the elderly.\"\nRichard Murray\nThe pervert, who showed a \"14-year-old girl\" his naked body, was jailed after breaching the terms of the sex offenders' register.\nRichard Murray was spared jail in January 2021 after being ensnared by paedophile hunters. The 53-year-old thought he had been sending obscene Facebook messages to a child, but he had actually been speaking to a decoy.\nHe had requested photos of the child and \"told her he was naked and in the bath\". The paedophile then video called the 'girl', with a four-minute video beginning with him topless before he moved the camera to his naked genitals.\nMurray then failed to inform the police when he moved home, in breach of his notification requirement. He was jailed for a year.\nMichael Moon\nA man stabbed his ex's mum in the street 22 times before trying to run the critically-injured 67-year-old over with his car.\nThe grandma's arm was partially-amputated during a sickening and unprovoked assault by cocaine and vodka-fuelled Michael Moon, but she managed to roll out of the way of the oncoming vehicle - despite laying stricken on the ground with grave and life-changing injuries and still having the eight-inch knife lodged in her shoulder. Carmel Ratcliffe only survived the attack thanks to vital treatment from a neighbour, who happened to be a recently retired paramedic.\nMoon was jailed for 22 years earlier this week after admitting attempted murder. The incident came after he blamed his victim for the breakdown of his relationship with her daughter and subsequent difficulties with child contact.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard that the 39-year-old's relationship with Leanne Finnegan, with whom he shares a nine-year-old daughter, ended around three years ago. Issues began to arise while she was pregnant with their child, including an incident which saw him barge past the expectant mother - who at the time was holding another child, then aged one - and slash a sofa and a mattress with a blade.\nThere were numerous other disputes in the run up to his violent attack on Ms Finnegan’s mum, including Moon falsely reporting Ms Finnegan for child neglect.\nShortly after 9pm on June 4 this year, he drove to Ms Ratcliffe’s neighbourhood after consuming nearly two litres of vodka and more than half a gram of cocaine and spotted her walking along Tabley Avenue. Moon honked his horn and pulled up next to her, briefly speaking to her out of the window but then getting out of the car armed with a large 13in kitchen knife with an 8in blade.\nHe then stabbed Ms Ratcliffe eight times to the head and upper body, then knifed her a further 14 times after she fell to the floor. The knifeman \"backed off\" after neighbours ran to her aid.\nMoon threw the knife at the pensioner from a distance of 4ft, causing it to became lodged under her shoulder blade. Ms Ratcliffe began crawling away in a desperate attempt to escape, but he told her he would \"run her over\" and mounted the curb as he drove away and veered towards her.\nMiraculously, she was able to avoid being run over by rolling into bushes. Kenneth Reid, her neighbour and a former paramedic with nearly 30 years of experience, administered life-saving first aid at the roadside alongside Ms Ratcliffe's husband Alan.\nDoctors later said Ms Ratcliffe likely would have died quickly had she received that medical help. Moon later admitted attempted murder and possession of a bladed article.\nDavid Hughes\nA man \"bombarded\" a colleague over a three-year campaign of \"disturbing and sinister\" online stalking after they kissed.\nDavid Hughes, 41, hounded his colleague and his “paranoid” behaviour led her to thinking of ending her life. On Monday (September 5), Liverpool Crown Court heard that Hughes hacked the social media accounts of his stalking victim, repeatedly changed her passwords and followed one of her young children on Instagram.\nHughes, who identified with violent screen characters, “bombarded” her with texts as well as on social media. He sent her frightening “coded messages” including a photograph of her earring dropped in his car, saying: \"bad things are coming your way.”\nHughes, of Harris Street, Dentons Green, St Helens , pleaded guilty to stalking involving serious alarm between February 2018 and July last year, as well unauthorised computer access with intent to commit other offences and voyeurism. Sentencing him to two years and eight months behind bars, the judge, Recorder David Knifton, QC, said that Hughes had become “infatuated” with the stalking victim.\nDavid Cooper\nA dad-of-three sexually pursued a \"13-year-old girl\" despite knowing he could \"lose everything\".\nDavid Cooper chatted with 13-year-old 'Grace' via Kik Messenger, and tried to incite the teenager to have sex with him. But unknown to Cooper, 'Grace,' was actually an undercover police officer whose role was to find paedophiles online.\nCooper agreed with the girl in a series of online messages that her mum would kill her if she knew about their chats. The defendant added: \"She won't know but I could go to prison and lose everything.\"\nLiverpool Crown Court heard that Cooper, 35, of Nicholas Road, Widnes , was a diagnostic technician at a car manufacturer on the brink of promotion. But the family man's career is now in ruins.\nCooper had told the girl he was 30 and lived in Warrington. He said the defendant pursued conversations with her despite her telling him she was 13 - and he repeatedly asked her to send him photographs of her thighs and crotch area in leggings or tights.\nCooper sent 'Grace' a photograph of his penis and moved their conversations onto Instagram. He told her \"it's our secret\" and made lewd remarks. He asked about her underwear, told her he was pleasuring himself while thinking about her, and said he wanted to have sexual intercourse with her.\nThe contact, which spanned from May 11 to August 4 last year, came to an end and he was arrested in November. Cooper pleaded guilty to attempted communication with a child and attempting to cause or incite a child to engage in sexual activity.\nHe was jailed for 27 months.\nFaye Dunn\nA successful businesswoman who worked as an accountant for a drug gang wailed \"I can't believe it\" as she was jailed.\nFormer professional footballer Faye Dunn was ensnared at an airport after police rumbled the million pound cannabis trafficking operation. The mum became involved in the underworld when her business ventures began to falter due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard today, Tuesday, that the 38-year-old and her dad Michael Dunn operated using EncroChat - an encrypted communications platform commonly used by criminals. But authorities gained access to the network in 2020, with Operation Venetic subsequently revealing that the daughter had been using the handle StiffNinja.\nMeanwhile, her convicted drug smuggler father went under the name ZincBat. Faye Dunn was found to have been in close contact with a user known as LedZeppelin, with messages revealing she had \"involvement in the supply and production of cannabis\".\nThe mum-of-two was described as an \"accountant for an organised criminal enterprise\", while she had smuggled ill-gotten cash abroad. Nicola Daley, prosecuting, said: \"She played an operational role within the drugs supply chain but appeared to have significant influence upon others in the chain, facilitating meetings between criminal associates in relation to the supply of controlled drugs, and also instructed others to undertake tasks such as the collection and movement of packages of both drugs and cash.\n\"Significantly, she appears to have acted as the accountant for the organised criminal enterprise and has concealed not only her EncroChat device but also cash when travelling abroad in order to evade detection by the authorities.\"\nFaye Dunn was arrested at Manchester Airport on June 13 and remained silent throughout her interview with officers. Michael Dunn was held on July 11 and also gave no comment.\nBoth defendants, of Walpole Avenue in Whiston, admitted conspiracy to supply cannabis and money laundering. The former, previously of Kingsway Parade in Huyton, has previous convictions for drink driving and driving while disqualified.\nFaye Dunn was jailed for three years and nine months, while her father received a two year prison term suspended for two years.\nPaul Brown\nA county line drug boss continued dealing crack cocaine and heroin after a close call with police.\nPaul Brown, of Quickthorne Crescent, Stockbridge Village was caught out when he was spotted leaving a flat that was being used as a base to supply crack cocaine and heroin. When police spotted 42-year-old Brown leaving a home on Lilac Drive in Northwich, he was already under investigation after being stopped in a car on Runcorn Road in April 2019.\nA search of the car he was a passenger in led officers to find two knives in the boot and £2k worth of drugs. Brown was arrested at the scene, questioned and released under investigation.\nWhen he was arrested for a second time on June 9, 2022, he was seen leaving a flat which had crack cocaine, heroin, £200 in cash, three mobile phones and drug paraphernalia inside. Brown was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply crack cocaine and heroin and subsequently charged.\nHe appeared at Liverpool Crown Court on Friday, August 26 and was jailed for 68 months after pleading guilty to the offences.\nDavid Alty\nA thug who strangled a woman in a vicious assault killed his own dad 17 years ago in an attack so severe that doctors found more than 100 injuries across his body.\nDavid Alty was jailed after launching an attack on a family friend who gave him a place to stay.\nAlty, now 36, was heavily drunk and in the midst of a psychotic episode when he punched the woman before strangling her and telling her he was going to kill her at her home in Litherland earlier this year.\nHe was detained in hospital after admitting assault occasioning actual bodily harm after the woman, who the ECHO has chosen not to name, said she feared she was about to die during the attack.\nLyn Karran\nA nan posed as an accountant in a scam potentially worth up to £1.2million.\nLyn Karran submitted fake expenses claims to HM Revenue and Customs on behalf of dozens of clients, swindling the public purse out of at least £300,000 in doing so. The 46-year-old is now beginning a lengthy prison sentence, only days after the birth of her first grandchild.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard on Wednesday that the nan ran previously a firm by the name of LK Accounting Services. Between October 2015 and 2017, she acted as an \"unauthorised tax agent\" - making fraudulent repayment claims for her customers in order to \"enrich herself\".\nKarran, who is also known as Lyn Wilson, secured a total of £1.2million for 150 clients - most of whom were plumbers and heating engineers whose work she gained through word of mouth and liaised with via WhatsApp - during this period. Peter Killen, prosecuting, described how they were \"generally on a PAYE taxation basis and unfamiliar with the self-assessment scheme\".\nShe instructed them to register for self-assessment and provide her with their personal details, giving her control of their accounts. Karran, of Tithebarn Lane in Melling, never asked the workmen to provide receipts and never told them of the value of the claims being made in their names.\nThese included backdated payments from up to three years earlier. They paid her a flat fee of £150 plus 10% of the rebates earned, netting her around £190,000.\nKarran's company also had a \"misleading\" website which \"gave the impression it was a professional registered business\". She \"failed to follow the rules required of fee-earning tax agents\" and did not register with HMRC or report that she was acting on behalf of others when completing self-assessment tax returns.\nThe amounts claimed triggered an automated response from software and led to an investigation into the 150 tradesmen, beginning in 2017. At this point, Karran ceased contact with her customers and stopped replying to messages.\nShe was eventually charged with fraud and was found guilty by jury earlier this month. She was sentenced to four and a half years in prison.\nSimon Rogers\nA drug dealer hid nearly £30,000 of heroin and cannabis in his own children's rucksacks in a desperate attempt to avoid being caught red-handed by police.\nSimon Rogers, from Formby, stashed the illicit substances in the kids' bags after he was pulled over while driving a stolen Audi with his two young sons in the back. The opportunist dad almost got away with his audacious attempt, but officers ultimately discovered the drugs alongside tens of thousands of pounds in ill-gotten cash.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard on Wednesday that the owner of the grey Audi Q2 awoke at 6am on June 10 this year to find that her SUV had been taken from outside her house in Gateshead overnight. Then, at around 4pm on July 15, Merseyside Police spotted the stolen vehicle being driven on cloned number plates in the Kirkby, Aintree and Maghull areas.\nDriver Rogers was subsequently boxed in by officers on the M57 northbound and detained. The 40-year-old was allowed to explain the situation to his children before they were transported to the homes of other family members.\nHe was also given the chance to gather their belongings in the car in holdalls before being taken into custody. Police subsequently attempted to carry out a search of his Alt Road home, but the house key was not on a set that had been seized.\nOfficers then returned to search the bags that the boys had been left with, hoping to find the key. Instead, they found a block of heroin and two of cannabis resin plus a \"huge amount of cash\" totalling £15,000 with his nine-year-old son - who had been dropped at his grandma's in Kirkby.\nThe other youngster had been taken to his mum's house in Speke. There, a search of his belongings revealed paperwork in his dad's name and another block of cannabis resin stashed underneath a bundle of clothing.\nThe authorities did not find the outstanding key, but were ultimately let into the address at roughly 8pm by Rogers' partner. More monies were discovered in the kitchen, with £1,000 in a handbag and £21,800 in a cupboard.\nA search of the car then revealed a further block of cannabis resin. The 369g of heroin was found to be of 49% purity with a street value of up to £22,000, while the cannabis was worth an estimated £5,200.\nRogers admitted possession of heroin and cannabis with intent to supply, handling stolen goods, possession of criminal property and driving without insurance. He was locked up for four-and-a-half years.\nMark Green\nA sushi restaurant worker turned his entire flat into a £90,000 cannabis farm then claimed the \"extraordinary\" amount of drugs was for personal use.\nMark Green appeared before Liverpool Crown Court for sentence on Thursday after admitting production of cannabis. Carmel Wilde, prosecuting, described how police raided his apartment on Feltwood Close in West Derby on January 6.\nInside, officers discovered the whole of the unit had been given over to a grow with a potential yield of between £20,000 and £90,000 of class B drugs. No bed was found in the flat and there was no food in the fridge.\nThis was because Green had not been living in the social housing property, instead \"sofa surfing\" at friends' houses. The tenant initially claimed the cannabis was intended for his own use, but later conceded it was a \"commercial operation\" for onward supply.\nGreen, now of St Albans Road in Bootle , also pleaded guilty to abstracting electricity. He was jailed for two years due to his \"poor compliance with court orders\" - the offences were committed while he was on post-sentence supervision.\nCarlos Graham\nA serial burglar broke into a woman's home while she was attending her dad's funeral.\nCarlos Graham stole a haul of goods worth more than £25,000 over the course of one morning during a spate of break-ins. The \"regular, repeated and habitual\" offender was previously part of an organised crime group which tied up victims and attacked them with weapons.\nAndrew McInnes, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court that the burglaries occurred in the Sefton Park area on the morning of June 30 this year. Among the properties targeted was a flat on Croxteth Road.\nOne of the occupants was working away in Canada at the time, while his partner had been out between 11am and 4pm. She returned to find the door deadlocked and the kitchen window open, and was forced to climb inside as a result.\nThere, she discovered that her home had been \"ransacked\", with coats left scattered around after being searched and drawers opened. Among the items stolen were a wallet with two credit cards, two backpacks, a PlayStation and games and £25,000 of professional recording equipment - described as the \"tools of the trade\" of the absent owner.\nFootage showed Graham burgling the home and he went on to target an address at nearby Ashby House, on Ivanhoe Road. Occupant Ben Davies left home for work at around 7.30am but received a mobile phone notification shortly before 11am, with his CCTV system alerting him of an intruder.\nGraham could be seen on the footage outside the patio doors attempting to gain entry. Mr Davies later mentioned this to David Ashton, who lived in a neighbouring unit with his wife.\nHer dad's funeral was to be held that day, and she left the flat at around 9am. Mr Ashton followed on shortly after 11.45am.\nHe was informed of the attempted break-in by Mr Davies at around 6pm and returned home. While he did not notice anything amiss at first, when his partner arrived later she found that the spare bedroom had been broken into - with an iPad and a digital camera taken.\nGraham admitted two counts of burglary and one of attempted burglary. He was jailed for five years and three months.\nAdam Baker\nA drinker befriended a man at a pub before robbing him at knifepoint in his own home.\nAdam Baker met the victim in a pub in Bootle and was invited back to his home to keep drinking.\nHowever, hours later, after gaining the man’s trust, Baker used a knife from the kitchen to threaten the man into giving him his bank card and pin number. Baker, 30, and an accomplice then stole hundreds from his victim’s account.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard Baker targeted the man after meeting him in the Cooksons Bridge pub in July this year. Baker, of Pall Mall, Liverpool, was jailed for four years and one month and a restraining order prevents him from contacting the victim for five years.\nJordan Duckett\nThe dealer pushed drugs around Merseyside and Cheshire but has now been jailed after being caught by a graft phone.\nJordan Duckett came to the attention of police after officers investigating the county lines gang 'Scouse Macca Team' after photographs of him and texts sent from him were found on the device. It came after detectives investigating the gang carried out searches at a property on Warkworth Court, Ellesmere Port, in March this year.\nWhen the 26-year-old's home in Wallasey was subsequently raided, 64 wraps of crack cocaine - valued at £640 - were discovered. He admitted being concerned in the supply of cocaine, ketamine and cannabis and possession of crack cocaine with intent to supply and was given three years and four months in prison.\nZayd Alasaly\nThe robber laughed after stealing an e-scooter at knifepoint from a woman who “froze in fear”.\nZayd Alasaly, from Toxteth, was one of two men who attacked Roberta Kirkpatrick when she visited the Spar shop on Newtown Road in Carlisle shortly before 11pm on July 15. She had left her vehicle near to the entrance, with the 20-year-old defendant and 19-year-old accomplice Liam Bateman also being present in the store at the time.\nMiss Kirkpatrick left the shop, and as she pulled a cigarette out of her pocket Alasaly threatened her with a large kitchen knife. She fled to a friend's house afterwards \"shaking, crying, visibly upset\".\nBoth Alasaly, of Corinto Street, and Bateman, from Carlisle, admitted robbery, with the former also pleading guilty to possession of a bladed article in a public place. He was handed four years behind bars.\nBrandon Turton\nThe street racer was speeding at up to 93mph in a 30mph zone when he struck and killed a 14-year-old girl.\nCourtney Ellis' teenage sister witnessed her sibling's horrific death, while the youngster's mum unknowingly encountered the scene of the crash as she drove home from work. Driver Brandon Turton today cried as he was jailed for causing the fatal collision, having been racing at high speeds around residential streets in convoy with another car at the time.\nThe schoolgirl, from Haydock, died instantly after being hit by the 21-year-old's Renault Megane on Blackbrook Road in St Helens shortly after 9.45pm on September 19, 2020. He had been \"showing off or driving in anger\", having made unsuccessful attempts to woo a female passenger.\nTurton was handed six years and nine months in prison after admitting causing death by dangerous driving and dabbed his eyes with a tissue as he was led down to the cells. Sentencing, Judge David Potter said: \"Courtney was a loving child with enormous compassion and promise, who leaves behind a shattered and traumatised family.\"\nMatthew Sanderson\nThe carjacker attempted to rob a woman armed with a pair of scissors before entering a shop claiming to be from Trading Standards then brandishing a fake gun.\nMatthew Sanderson demanded to see the visas of Polish workers in the store before attacking them and taking cash from the till. Only hours before, he had tried to steal a lone female's car as she filled her tyres with air on a petrol station forecourt.\nDriver Pauline Garner, 58, \"acted with commendable bravery\" by disarming her assailant after being attacked at the BP garage on Priory Road in Anfield on her way to work. Sanderson responded by biting her on the arm and claiming that she had robbed him.\nHours later, he raided Tatry on Breck Road and threatened to shoot staff before stealing cash. The 38-year-old admitted offences including robbery and assault with intent to rob and was jailed for eight years.\nGareth Rees\nA revenge porn victim was left feeling \"distraught\" after her ex-boyfriend posted explicit pictures and videos of her on social media.\nGareth Rees uploaded the materials of his former partner on Facebook and Instagram, as well as sending them directly to her loved ones. She was left so devastated by his actions that she was unable to even walk the dog.\nThe 44-year-old defendant had a \"strong, visceral and disproportionate reaction\" to the end of their year-long relationship and sent \"sexual materials\" of the victim to her daughter's boyfriend - who did not open the message. Just over a week later, he posted an explicit video of the woman on Instagram. The following day, Rees messaged a pornographic image to another of her ex-boyfriends but deleted the picture before it was seen.\nAround a month later, he posted a photograph of her to Facebook in which her face could not been seen. Magistrates jailed him for a year after he admitted disclosing private sexual photographs with intent to cause distress and breaching a non-molestation order.\nJohn Smith\nThe drug dealer ruined his \"promising\" Liverpool FC career by getting involved with cocaine and heroin.\nJohn Smith once had a \"promising career\" as a youth player with the Reds, but \"wasted his talent\" by falling into drink and drugs. And the now 38-year-old was caught with thousand of pounds of class A substances when police pulled over his car.\nWhen his home on Carr Lane in Norris Green was raided, he owned up and \"told the officers where the drugs were\". In total, 22g of crack cocaine worth around £2,460 and 23g of heroin with a potential street value of £2,080 was seized.\nThe search also uncovered £3,130 in cash. He admitted possession of heroin and crack cocaine with intent to supply and was jailed for 32 months.\nDavid Kay\nA thug strangled his girlfriend in the street only one week into their relationship.\nDavid Kay drunkenly throttled his new partner in the early hours after a night out in St Helens town centre. The horrifying assault only stopped when the attack was spotted by passing police officers.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard on Tuesday that the dad-of-10 had been with Janice Gregory for around a week when they went out to several pubs and bars on the evening of Sunday, July 31. The couple were in the Duke of Cambridge pub at around 2.30am on August 1 when Kay became \"loud and aggressive\".\nKirsty Linforth, prosecuting, said Ms Gregory told him she wanted to leave and go home but he was \"not happy with this\". The 51-year-old - of Thatto Heath Road - told her \"you're not f***ing going home\" and followed her out of the pub.\nOnce \"out of sight\" on Claughton Street, Kay stopped his former partner by some railings and began shouting at her and threatened \"I will kill you if you leave me\". He grabbed his victim around the neck with both hands and began squeezing and \"used his full weight\" to push her back over the railings.\nMs Gregory was left unable to breathe and \"terrified she was going to break her back\". Kay \"repeated this action four or five times\" while making threats, before a patrolling special constable noticed the incident in progress and intervened.\nKay was arrested and later admitted intentional strangulation and was jailed for two years. He was also handed a restraining order banning him from contacting Ms Gregory for the next five years and told to pay a victim surcharge.\nNick Clayton\nA headteacher messaged more than 100 boys on Facebook asking for naked pictures before claiming that his account had been hacked.\nNick Clayton, from Hoylake, held lewd chats with children aged as young as 10 while working as the principal of a British international school in Iraq. His campaign of grooming only ended when police swooped to arrest him at an airport.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard that the 38-year-old contacted the profiles of 131 boys - mostly based in South Asia - over a three-month period in 2017 in order to \"solicit\" indecent images of the youngsters. Jonathan Rogers, prosecuting, described how the conversations also showed \"evidence of travelling to meet children\" - although Clayton was only charged in connection with attempts to groom four teens.\nThese chats involved a 12-year-old boy from Cambodia, a 13-year-old in Indonesia, a child aged 14 from the Philippines and a 16-year-old in Sri Lanka. The paedophile \"bribed them with gifts\" before demanding sick photographs.\nLouis Howard\nA barman sent naked pictures of himself to a \"12-year-old girl\" - but unbeknown to him, he was actually being caught in a sting by undercover police.\nLouis Howard claimed to be aged 15 as he attempted to solicit indecent images from the decoy Snapchat account. The 22-year-old also collected a sick stash of videos of children being raped and distributed such materials online.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard on Wednesday that the university student sent a friend request to the profile - which was being operated by an officer from the regional crime squad - in October last year. Howard, of Trouville Road in Anfield, falsely stated that he was a 15-year-old boy, and over a four-week period \"engaged in conversation which was evidently sexual\".\nThe paedophile asked the youngster for photographs of her naked and in her underwear, instructing her to take off her top and skirt. He also sent her pictures of himself in his boxers, then removed his pants and sent snaps of his penis - telling her: \"You have made me very hot.\"\nMerseyside Police then raided Howard's home, with the defendant being present and arrested. His mobile phone was seized and was later found to contain 37 indecent images of children.\nHoward admitted attempting to engage in sexual activity with a child, attempting to cause a child to watch sexual activity, attempting sexual communications with a child, two counts of distributing indecent images, possession of indecent images, three counts of making indecent images and possession of prohibited images.

Fletcher, 28, had denied murder but was found guilty by a jury after a six-week trial earlier this year.\nFletcher murdered Stenson after a disagreement at a house party was escalated by Fletcher.\nJurors heard Mr Stenson’s murder occurred minutes after the fight broke out between him and Fletcher. Mr Pratt said the atmosphere at the party Fletcher and Mr Stenson were attending was good until a disagreement between them over whether Fletcher had been trying to flirt with Mr Stenson’s partner, Samantha Rosser.\nThe court heard Mr Stenson punched Fletcher and then the two started to scuffle before agreeing to go outside to finish the fight. Mr Pratt said there was no indication to Mr Stenson or anyone else that the fight would involve knives but that Fletcher decided to run and grab a kitchen knife from inside the house before stabbing Mr Stenson with it.\nWhile Fletcher was jailed for murder, his best friend, Nathan Finnegan, and the mum of his child, Demi Walsh, were both given custodial sentences after being convicted of assisting an offender.\nThe pair both helped Fletcher in the aftermath of Mr Stenson’s stabbing, helping him evade justice for days.\nBoth denied the offence but were convicted following their trial with Fletcher. Walsh was sentenced to 18 months in prison while Finnegan received a 14 month sentence.\nAndrew Holligan\nA dealer threw nearly £5,000 of drugs out of his bedroom window and into his neighbour's garden when police raided his house.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard that a search warrant was executed at Andrew Holligan's home in Greenside Avenue, Aintree, at around 9.45am on August 19 this year. Prosecutor Kirsty Linforth described how the 31-year-old was seen by officers launching a hold-all out of an upstairs window into the garden of a next door property.\nThis hold-all was subsequently found to contain numerous bags of cannabis, a further amount of the class B drug in a box and a set of scales. Five mobile devices were recovered during the raid, one of which was being used as a graft phone.\nA total of £300 in cash was also seized. The 315g of illicit substances were estimated to have a street value of up to £4,715.

But this was refuted by the prosecution.\nHolland admitted possession of cannabis with intent to supply and was locked up for 18 months. He was also told to pay a victim surcharge - with forfeiture of the ill-gotten money, phone and paraphernalia and the destruction of the drugs also ordered.\nPhilip Legge\nA cocaine dealer was caught with drugs stashed down his trousers on a convenience store car park.\nPhilip Legge turned to trafficking illicit substances after racking up crippling gambling debts. The dad-of-four cried as he was jailed over his secret activities earlier this week.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard that police on patrol in the Crosby area in February this year spotted the 45-year-old's BMW 3 Series stop at the Tesco Express store on Coronation Road before a man walked out of a nearby house and entered the passenger seat.\nThey then observed a \"short conversation and a hand-to-hand transaction\". The customer got back out of the car, and officers approached. Legge too exited the vehicle and dropped £60 in cash to the floor, while he was also holding wraps of cocaine in his hands.\n\"Straight away\", he admitted that he had \"more drugs down the back of his trousers\". A search of his home subsequently found one further wrap while a large amount of cash was discovered stashed in a safe.\nMeanwhile, messages on his phone were \"indicative of drug trafficking\".

Now aged 29, he has been hauled back before the courts after subjecting his former partner to a troubling campaign of harassment over a period of more than six months.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard that he and Joanne Cartwright had been in a relationship for nine years and have a three-year-old daughter together. But Sarah Griffin, prosecuting, described how she ended their romance in October 2021 after being told Eastham had been cheating on her with another woman who he had got pregnant.\nBut the plasterer was \"unable to accept the end\", and at around 6.45am on October 27 he attended her Huyton home with his mum - who stood at the front door shouting upstairs. Ms Cartwright went downstairs to speak to her through a window but when she opened it her ex appeared from the side of the address.\nEastham, of Beaconsfield in Prescot, struggled with her to keep the window open as she tried to shut it while hurling abuse. Their then two-year-old child began crying upstairs, saying: \"I'm scared.\"\nWhile she went to check on the girl, her mother Lydia Cartwright remained by the open window. But Eastham said \"f*** this\" and forcibly climbed in, damaging the window as he did so.\nHe ran up to the bedroom where his former partner was on the phone to the police shouting for help which caused him to flee. Afterwards, the defendant began \"constantly contacting\" her.\nThis continued over the coming weeks until one incident in December when he turned up at her home wearing a balaclava and holding shears. On a later visit, he assaulted her.\nEastham admitted stalking, a public communications offence, two counts of criminal damage and possession of ketamine. Appearing in court via video link to HMP Altcourse, he was jailed for two years.\nMichael Vose\nThe thug deliberately crashed his car into a bungalow where an elderly woman was sleeping.\nMichael Vose crashed into Edna Kearns' home in a suicide attempt following a row with his girlfriend. The 40-year-old, from St Helens, got behind the wheel after she called the police regarding the row, which saw him attempt to throttle her before punching a hole in the wall and damaging a wardrobe mirror.\nHe told his partner that he was going to kill himself before he took off in the BMW, driving over a mini-roundabout and later smashing through a fence and into the house in Westhoughton, Bolton. Vose smashed through the wall and into the 92-year-old's bedroom, hitting her bed and leaving her with two fractured ankles and severe cuts to her legs.\nMrs Kearns died less than five months after the crash but, according to expert evidence, there was no link between the smash and her death.

I'll stab you up.\"\nShe suffered 23 separate injuries at Dunn's hands after he consumed a cocktail of cocaine and alcohol. He admitted offences including false imprisonment and inflicting grievous bodily harm and was jailed for six years and eight months.\nPaul Riley\nA paedophile began distributing indecent images online months after being released from prison.\nPaul Riley collected hundreds of sick pictures and videos of young children being raped and shared his vile stash with other perverts over the Kik messaging service.

His previous convictions for carrying weapons meant he was locked up for 11 months.\nCallum Taylor-Greensmith\nThe thug filmed himself launching a sickening attack on a friend before showing footage of the attack to horrified members of the public.\nCallum Taylor-Greensmith subjected David Hughes to a horrendous assault in Wirral last year before gloating to people at a caravan park which both men's families frequently visited. The attack left the victim requiring plates to be inserted into his head.\nMr Hughes was targeted after the two men had been drinking together over the weekend of the Champions League final before Taylor-Greensmith kicked him multiple times in the head.
