  "body_text": "By Web Desk\nDecember 15, 2023\nFIFA’s policy of engagement with Iran over the treatment of women in football has made a positive effect after some were allowed to attend the Tehran derby on Thursday, according to President Gianni Infantino.\nWomen's rights campaigners Open Stadiums and another group of ex-Iranian athletes last year urged FIFA to ban Iran from the World Cup for not allowing women to attend football matches.\nHowever, Infantino opted for a policy of personal engagement with Iran and welcomed the news that women had been allowed into Thursday's Iran Pro League match.\n\"In September, I had the pleasure of meeting Iran President Ebrahim Raisi in New York City, where we discussed the development of women's football in the country and progress made regarding the presence of women in football stadiums,\" he said in a statement released on social media.\n\"It was, therefore, with great delight that I learned around 3,000 women attended the Tehran derby between Persepolis FC and Esteghlal FC today.\n\"Thanks to the ongoing dialogue between FIFA and the Islamic Republic of Iran Football Federation, progress is being made.\"\nUnder pressure from Infantino, a small group of female fans were granted access to Persepolis's home leg of the 2018 Asian Champions League final in Tehran.\nThere has been minimal progress since, with female fans barred from entering Iran's World Cup qualifying game against Lebanon in Mashhad in March 2022, after which video emerged of female supporters being pepper-sprayed outside the stadium.\nThe calls to ban Iran from the World Cup came against the backdrop of mass protests across the country in the wake of the death of Mahsa Amini while she was in the custody of the morality police for allegedly violating the Islamic dress code.\nInfantino said he would be travelling to Iran in the near future and would again meet President Raisi \"to further discuss football-related matters\".\n\"Iran is a significant force in Asian football and it is important that we continue to nurture the positive and fruitful working relationship we have built,\" the Swiss added.\n— Additional input from Reuters",
