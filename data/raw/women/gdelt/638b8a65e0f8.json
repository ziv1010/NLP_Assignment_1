  "body_text": "The City of Canning is seeking funding from the State Government to upgrade lighting at Ferndale Park ahead of a proposed $6 million redevelopment, although there are concerns if the funds will be available.\nThe park on Metcalfe Road is home to four major sporting clubs comprising about 400 members and features three sporting ovals.\nHowever only two have lighting, limiting the ability of clubs to train in the evening, particularly in winter.\nThe city is in the detailed planning stage of redevelopment of the park, including a state-of-the-art clubroom and modern changeroom facilities, alongside existing cricket nets, playground, pavilion, scouts building and public toilets.\nIn addition to the new buildings, extensive landscaping, improved carparking and general upgrades are also planned.\nBut first it wants to deliver lighting of up to 100 lux, switchable to 50 lux, at one oval to allow for safe training and match play for large ball sports, and address a shortfall of suitable Australian rules football grounds in the city.\nThe upgrade is expected to cost just more than $500,000, with $165,000 sought from City Night Lights, $40,000 already sourced and the city to provide the remaining $298,000.\nBut the current round of City Night Lights funding has been delayed, with the Department of Creative Industries, Tourism and Sport saying it would provide details on if or when the funding would be available after a review of the program has been completed.\nThe council voted unanimously to proceed with the funding application and commit its own funds if successful.\nCr Ben Kunze said clubs that used the park were excited about the project, pointing to power outages and significant flooding earlier this year that further reduced oval availability.\n“When they weren’t able to use (oval one), they had no other options,” Cr Kunze said.\n“The fact they will potentially have one new oval to play on as well as the lights on the old oval is really attractive to them.\n“When we first discussed investing in Ferndale Park, Lynwood Ferndale Football Club was struggling and now it’s exponentially growing: girls, boys, women, men. They need more space.”\nFerndale Lynwood Cricket Club, Vic Park Masters AFL Club and Canning District Hockey Club also train and play at the ovals throughout the year.\nLynwood Ferndale Football Club chairman Jarod Crow said the club was looking to introduce a senior women’s team next year and additional lighting would enable it to accommodate training and games.\n“The new lighting on oval two will allow our junior teams to train a little longer, while also giving us the ability to utilise more of the space that Ferndale Reserve has to offer,” he said.\n“We look at these new lights as potential to really grow the future of junior and senior football in the area.\n“The club is very excited to what City of Canning have planned for the reserve over the next few years. The new clubrooms and changerooms are the start of something great for the local community.”\nIn a report to council, city staff said they would pursue a phased implementation of upgraded lighting across all three ovals, with subsequent funding sought for ovals one and three. Staff said the Ferndale Park project would complement the city’s proposed $6m investment in the precinct.\n“The project will increase the overall quality of lighting and the ability to recreate safely for training, match play and for unstructured recreation pursuits,” the report said.\n“This gives clubs the opportunity to increase participation in community sport and improve the capacity of local clubs to sustain and grow their membership.”",
