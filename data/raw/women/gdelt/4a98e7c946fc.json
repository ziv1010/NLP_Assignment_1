  "body_text": "England 1 - 3 Senegal\nTrue to the big hints he has been making, Thomas Tuchel has dropped Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford from his imperious position as England's Number 1 for tonight's International friendly against Senegal, which a poor England side went on to lose in front of an unhappy crowd at Nottingham's City Ground.\nThis was only the second meeting between England and Senegal. The previous match was at the 2022 World Cup when Jordan Henderson, Harry Kane and Bukayo Saka scored in a 3-0 win to book a place in the quarter-finals.\nLast Friday, Senegal – ranked 19th in the world – drew 1-1 against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin, with substitute Ismaila Sarr scoring a late equaliser, extending their current unbeaten run to 23 games.\nIdrissa Gana Gueye and Iliman Ndiaye both start for Senegal, playing an international in England for the first time ever.\nEngland: Henderson, Walker, Colwill, Chalobah, Lewis-Skelly, Rice, Gallagher, Eze, Saka, Kane, Gordon.\nSubs: Pickford, James, Konsa, Gibbs-White, Henderson, Bellingham, Burn, Toney, Alexander-Arnold, Jones, Rogers, Madueke, Palmer, Trafford.\nSenegal: E Mendy, Koulibaly, I Gueye, Diarra, Jackson, Camara, I Ndiaye, Siatta, Sarr, Niakhate, E Diouf.\nSubs: Y Diouf, Camara Mamadou, Seck, Dia, Sabaly, C Ndiaye, Jakobs, Niasse, I Gueye, Sima, Diaw, A Mendy, P Gueye,\n19:45 England v Senegal — ITV 1\nReader Comments (175)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

Playing systems, patterns of play, formations, squad selection etc.\nIt all just seems like random, try anything, try anyone, rubbish to me.\n17 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:26:03\n18 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:26:56\n19 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:28:39\n20 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:29:28\nThey really hate Everton, don't they.\n21 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:30:07\nI hope our players come out injury-free.\nTuchel will be playing in the remake of Nosferatu before he knows it!\n22 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:30:29\nIt's a friendly, he played in the World Cup qualifier on Saturday, of course he's going to change it. You could also say he dropped Bellingham and Palmer?\n23 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:30:42\n24 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:30:44\nEnd of game, Tuchel orders truck load of cotton wool in which to wrap Jordan between matches.\n25 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:30:53\n26 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:31:15\n27 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:32:08\n28 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:33:07\nHe'd be mad if he didn't, a year out from the World Cup and virtually zero caps sitting on the bench.\n29 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:33:17\nApparently, for some reason I can't quite work out, playing in goal in a team in some dreary Eurokickaround competition makes you a better goalkeeper than someone who has saved penalties in international competitions against the best in the world and has proved very good in penalty shootouts (which England have been so good at over the years).\nStill, at least I can enjoy supporting a team with Ndiaye and Gana!!!\n30 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:33:22\n31 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:34:52\nThey are playing with a system and the players know their roles. England just running around doing very little. They'll get chances but it's not as a result of any strategy, its just because some of the players have quality.\nTuchel is getting much less than the sum of the parts. Which for a coach is the worst you can do.\n32 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:37:09\n33 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:38:08\n34 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:39:34\n35 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:41:48\nIt's just a simple statement of a simple fact.\nBut I can try clickbait if you want.\nThree Lions chase off Black Cat Backstop in Sherwood Forest Fiasco\nMaybe not.\n36 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:43:46\n37 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:44:15\n38 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:53:05\n39 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:53:09\nSounded like Senegal played well.\nI've just caught up with the highlights at half time. The defending for the Senegal equaliser was poor. The full back makes little effort, enabling the Senegal player to play in a nice first time pass. Then the centre back allows the scorer to ghost past him, as if he wasn't there.\n40 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:55:01\nGood to see Illi skin Clare Balding, just need him to score now.\n41 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:55:57\n100%\nFcuk England - I’d love Pickford to announce his International retirement to concentrate on his club career. See how they’ll swivel and accuse him of deserting them if he did that.\nFcuk England, Fcuk the skunks, Fcuk the media, in fact, Fcuk anyone who isn’t an Evertonian -they’re all cnuts!\nUTFT\n42 Posted 10/06/2025 at 20:57:48\nWtf is that comment about?\n43 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:02:10\n44 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:10:34\n45 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:11:08\n46 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:11:17\n47 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:11:23\n48 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:11:38\n49 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:11:39\n50 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:11:55\nGoalie just got megged\n51 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:11:55\n52 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:12:23\n53 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:13:01\nUp yours Tuchel.\n54 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:14:07\nNo matter what the walking cadaver Tuchel thinks.\n55 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:14:35\n56 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:15:03\n57 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:15:57\nSimple ball over the top, perfectly time run by the forward and the static England defenders left chasing his shadow.\n58 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:16:22\n59 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:17:08\n60 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:17:14\n61 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:17:14\nI know hes injured, but this wonky eared, comb-over tool, has selected them (and Quansah ffs) before Jarrad in previous squads.\nTuchel doesn't have scooby.\n62 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:18:00\n63 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:22:21\n64 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:28:23\n65 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:31:12\n66 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:32:24\n67 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:35:00\n68 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:35:06\n69 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:35:14\n70 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:35:32\n71 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:35:35\n72 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:37:23\n73 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:37:52\n74 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:38:40\n75 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:39:08\nOnly ITV, the worst TV channel in the land and almost single handedly responsible for the decline in educational and moral standards over the past 30 years, could employ him.\n76 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:39:14\n77 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:40:57\n78 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:41:33\n79 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:41:44\n80 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:41:45\n81 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:41:50\n82 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:42:50\n83 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:43:18\n84 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:43:55\n85 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:44:02\n86 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:44:27\n87 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:44:43\n88 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:44:55\n89 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:45:43\nEngland had a cadaver in a cap and a tank top.\n90 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:45:46\n91 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:46:05\n92 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:46:24\n93 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:46:43\n94 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:47:23\n95 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:48:26\nWell another unconvincing performance from England apart from a few spells, no urgency.\nSenegal were organised, aggressive, pressed well to turn possession around and they can certainly play football, especially in tight spaces. Deserved win, the better team.\n96 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:48:31\n97 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:49:56\nWell done, Senegal.\n98 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:50:08\n99 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:51:52\nWe can't be having too many African players in the squad, as they would all be off to the AFCON, and we'd have no one left.\n100 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:52:48\n101 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:53:12\nBut fair play Senegal. Just the better team.\n102 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:54:42\nTuchel doesn't inspire, does he? He's contracted till after the World Cup… how about well before the World Cup?\nSomething ain't right…\n103 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:55:12\n104 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:55:56\n105 Posted 10/06/2025 at 21:59:13\n106 Posted 10/06/2025 at 22:00:16\nWhy don't they just pick from their so-called Super Cup teams who tried to sneak away from the Premier League for their 30 pieces of silver?\n107 Posted 10/06/2025 at 22:02:12\n108 Posted 10/06/2025 at 22:05:31\nYou can have all the good players you want, but without a tactically astute plan, you will get that embarrassing sort of display.\nAlso agree with Roy Keane that the players don't look particularly invested.\n109 Posted 10/06/2025 at 22:10:36\nSenegal seemed more organized, especially the back 4. England are like Everton – they need a right back,. Although it was only supposed to be a friendly, as they put it, you still have to be organized and play as a team.\nThere are too many players trying to impress the manager with very little teamwork. Tuchel will most probably put this loss as experimenting with the squad he has, but it's a bit late for that.\nAs far as the keeper goes, it will be interesting to read what the pundits say as he had an average game, but to replace Pickford as the #1, he will have to do better.\n110 Posted 10/06/2025 at 22:12:42\nAs stated above, they have no obvious game plan, direction and lack interest.\nMaybe they will come alive when the World Cup kicks off but difficult to believe they will make it past the early knock-out rounds judging by the past 2 or 3 games.\nNot convinced by Tuchel at all, he seems clueless to me.\n111 Posted 10/06/2025 at 22:30:14\nIs he really an upgrade on Southgate? And I'm Irish looking in.\n112 Posted 10/06/2025 at 22:33:01\n113 Posted 10/06/2025 at 22:33:47\n114 Posted 10/06/2025 at 22:37:14\nSenegal are a good side and were much more hungry and thoroughly deserved the win. Would Pickford in goal have made a difference – not for me.\nWalker is done – should be nowhere near the England team, I hope Moyes doesn't look in his direction to solve our right-back problem.\nSame old England – flatter to deceive.\nForget about winning the World Cup – it just will not happen.\n115 Posted 10/06/2025 at 22:43:15\nLet's face it, no matter how some players perform at club level, they just cannot produce it at international level.\nWhy on earth Conner Gallagher gets picked, I will never know.\nOnly a friendly but the Andorra game was way below the expected standard and not much happened in the games before that to suggest Tuchel really has the smarts to take on the bigger teams.\n116 Posted 10/06/2025 at 22:53:18\nTuchel says he wants his England team to play like Europeans???? Look where that has got us!!! We are rubbish!!\nTuchel has to go. He has no idea about how English football operates.\n117 Posted 10/06/2025 at 23:04:24\nPickford organises his defences by screaming at them. Henderson is a very quiet goalie.\nSo yes, I think Pickford would've done better.\n118 Posted 10/06/2025 at 23:05:16\nThere's lots of talent in that squad, and yes, some are also not as good; he will see that and hopefully come across the right blend. That said, England's squad is made up of players mainly from the Premier League, with the demands of that plus the greedy teams, endless summer tours, and now this Club World Cup farce.\nOur players will be dead on their feet next summer, so expect the usual.\n119 Posted 10/06/2025 at 23:36:04\nI'm happy Pickford didn't play but, if not for poor finishing and Henderson, it would have been five.\nKane should be fined and banned for his comments on the female referee. He said \"If you don't know the rules,\" referring to the disallowed goal by the ref.\nOur two blue boys were great and can't wait to see them next year in the World Cup.\n120 Posted 10/06/2025 at 23:52:40\nI think he's faster to close down for those goals. No-one gets to easily nutmeg him at the near post – the attacker would be dealing with a keeper flying at him. Just ask St Virgil.\nI'm not sure when the rest of the country will finally appreciate him. Maybe never while the media is so lazy with their opinions.\n121 Posted 11/06/2025 at 00:16:22\nI know Jarrad was injured but no way is Tuchel going to pick him. In fact, to my mind he's trying to unsettle him into asking to move to a club in the Champions League.\nAs for Pickford and Henderson, there is no comparison, despite what Lee Dickless says. 2 seasons ago, it was Ramsdale he was Championing, when he was Arsenal's No 1. He played last season at Southampton – nice spot, Dickless.\nNah, ITV pundits and a few others have it in for Everton players, don't ask me why. Last night, the Welsh commentator praised the former Chelsea and Man Utd player, Lukaku. What the Fuck? — he played more games for EFC but you wouldn't have thought so, with that comment.\nOh and Tuchel out. There is no way those players are playing for him, no way at all.\n122 Posted 11/06/2025 at 00:31:36\nHell of a player we have here.\n123 Posted 11/06/2025 at 01:46:39\nThe only time it ever happened was against Holland in 2019, which went to extra time.\nIn that time, it's happened with Pope, Ramsdale and Henderson in goal despite them having a combined 17 caps compared to Pickford's 76.\n124 Posted 11/06/2025 at 01:57:49\nAbsolute disgrace.\n125 Posted 11/06/2025 at 03:32:00\nAs for Dixon and the English press – it goes all the way back to them never mentioning Dixie, not picking Harvey and now, stabbing Jordan in the back. Fuck the lot of them.\n126 Posted 11/06/2025 at 03:47:30\nOver to you, Thomas.\n127 Posted 11/06/2025 at 04:51:20\nReading the media this morning, consensus seems to be he retains his #1 spot.\n128 Posted 11/06/2025 at 05:04:46\nAnd when ESPN listed its FC 100 last month, Pickford was not among the top 10 keepers. Sels and Sommer were rated, but not Pickford.\nLunacy.\n129 Posted 11/06/2025 at 05:17:33\nHow can they miss the England Number 1 off the list?!\nTuchel is showing how lucky he was to get the England job.\n130 Posted 11/06/2025 at 05:27:51\nAnd the adulation for Kane? It's a bit unseemly.\n131 Posted 11/06/2025 at 06:12:27\nMike, 128. I agree with those who think Jordan Pickford doesn't control his box but he's not alone. Drives me mad at times – don't start me off or it'll turn into a rant about the lost art of goalkeeping and then I'll be off about the inability for players to use both feet.\nOne of my friends just tells me that it's a modern day thing and that coaching of goalies now often prioritises caution over chaos for various reasons.\nFor all his faults and quirks, I still think Jordan Pickford is England's best goalkeeper at the moment although healthy competition is important.\n132 Posted 11/06/2025 at 06:39:16\nNeither have some of the greatest of all time -- Buffon, Zoff, Casillas, Schumacher, Barthez, or my favorite little Jorge Campos.\nThey rarely came off the line for corners. All they did was keep the ball out of the net. And win.\n133 Posted 11/06/2025 at 06:42:20\nTuchel will have wanted to have a look at options as to who will be his Number 2 and have a look at Henderson. That match and opposition gave him more of an idea than if he'd started against Andorra.\nAlso, fortunately there weren't many, maybe two, without reading through, but I don't feel the comments about the referee being a female are necessary. She is a referee. Kane wasn't being sexist in the slightest. His wife would have hung drawn and quartered him if he was. He simply questioned if the officials (VAR included) knew the rules.\nI didn't hear him refer to the fact she was female.\n134 Posted 11/06/2025 at 07:21:02\nHas Kane ever made that comment about the referees not knowing the rules before last night?\nDepending on the answer, that would lend weight to the idea that he was or wasn't being sexist about the referee.\n135 Posted 11/06/2025 at 07:27:23\nHe didn't mention female at all. He was on about the decision, the referee and Stockley Park in general, is how I heard it.\nIf there was any indication it was sexist, the media would have jumped all over it.\nA slightly different one, but Moyes was closer to the mark on being labelled a racist with his quote about Yakubu and Nigerian players' age in general. It caused the Nigerian FA to write to the English FA asking for him to be sanctioned.\nHe was taken out of context, a Prince Phillip style gaffe.\nThat's what's happened here. As I say, not by the majority, who didn't even notice or mention it, because nothing untoward was said other than criticising the decision.\n136 Posted 11/06/2025 at 07:55:41\nI watch England, just as I'll watch any other international match or football in general, but I'm indifferent to their results. I genuinely hope they sort it out for those who do support England. I enjoyed last night because Senegal, the better team, won playing football how it should be played.\nCraft, skill, well-organised and hard work throughout. And of course, because our two players had really good games. Gana being Gana and Ndiaye being a constant thorn in England's left hand side.\n137 Posted 11/06/2025 at 07:56:08\nIf Kane has questioned referees' awareness of the rules on another occasion, then there can be no accusation of sexism in this case. However, if this is the first time he's ever made that comment about not knowing the rules, then it could be interpreted as being sexist.\nEither that or he thinks all previous referees in his career have applied the rules perfectly.\n138 Posted 11/06/2025 at 08:05:16\nHe, like most players and managers, complain about decisions and criticise officials' decisions every week. Some get into trouble for it.\nThe one I think came closest was Mourinho's abuse of his female physio at Chelsea. It went to tribunal with lawyers, but I can't remember if anything came of it. I think there was a claim of misunderstanding, because he was swearing at her in Portuguese. Lost in translation, if you like.\n139 Posted 11/06/2025 at 08:09:42\nAnyway, Pickford saves the 2nd and 3rd. Henderson was too easily beaten.\nPickford might not be the biggest, but he bails teams out one one-on-one. A fact that critics don't recognise.\n140 Posted 11/06/2025 at 08:20:09\nAgree, but a goalkeeper dominating his box was once considered an essential part of the job over here. Even now older fans consider a goalkeeper \"incomplete\" if he stays on his line.\nI don't know if you are old enough to remember a cheeky bastard called Pat Jennings. He brought penalty area domination to piss taking levels. He would often come off his line and treat genuinely good crosses with utter contempt, often just collecting them with one hand.\nNot sure if he was the greatest goalie whoever lived, but he was brilliant and certainly the most popular.\n141 Posted 11/06/2025 at 08:32:16\nMany times I've witnessed a goalkeeper make a fantastic save and thought to myself that, if he would have been more self-aware and organised his defenders in front of him, then he wouldn't have even had to make a save.\nPerception = what a save. Analysis: sometimes = great save but if he would have been on the front foot and organising his defenders, he wouldn't have had to make that save.\nWe all see a different game.\n142 Posted 11/06/2025 at 08:57:48\nShe was terrible.\n143 Posted 11/06/2025 at 09:09:13\n1. The ball touched the player below the armpit.\n2. The player moved their arm towards the ball.\n3. The player had their arm in such as position that they risked the ball hitting it.\nFor the purposes of determining handball offences, the upper boundary of the arm is in line with the bottom of the armpit. Not every touch of a player's hand/arm with the ball is an offence.\nIt is an offence if a player:\ndeliberately touches the ball with their hand/arm, for example moving the hand/arm towards the ball\ntouches the ball with their hand/arm when it has made their body unnaturally bigger. A player is considered to have made their body unnaturally bigger when the position of their hand/arm is not a consequence of, or justifiable by, the player's body movement for that specific situation. By having their hand/arm in such a position, the player takes a risk of their hand/arm being hit by the ball and being penalised.\n144 Posted 11/06/2025 at 09:12:42\nHe was an out-and-out racist.\n145 Posted 11/06/2025 at 09:18:57\nHe was fantastic. If he would have been English, that would have given the England managers of the day a dilemma with Shilton and Clemence in the fold.\nAnticipation is key for a goalkeeper, as with any player. Pickford has been brilliant for Everton, but he doesn't really command. Sometimes he will, but he's not consistent with that side of his game.\nIt's the same as defenders anticipating, then the keeper doesn't have a save to make until there is a mistake, or just good forward play.\nBut keeper and defence play as a unit. The defence has the game in front of them. The keeper has the defence in front of him. He can see everything.\n146 Posted 11/06/2025 at 09:21:26\nGana must be one of the best defensive midfielders in Europe right now. What a player!\n147 Posted 11/06/2025 at 09:23:06\nBut you have to wonder why bring Toney in to sit on the bench for 87 minutes. I think we have gone backwards since Tuchel took over, there doesn't seem much team spirit.\nAnd I have no idea why players who look exciting in the Premier League look shadows of themselves when they play for England.\n148 Posted 11/06/2025 at 09:28:23\nEngland looked like a bunch of guys who have turned up on the big field of Stanley Park and someone said \"I will have you and you etc.\"\nThe above is also my concern with Everton, who need to recruit around the same number of players.\nIt could be a difficult couple of months when the season starts, until they come up with the right formation.\n149 Posted 11/06/2025 at 09:30:53\nI think Jordan is the best around and I admire him greatly. However, I think goalkeepers have a different role today.\nBanks, Jennings, Southall, Yashin were, in my view, better at goalkeeping, they stopped shots and dominated the box. Also, they had very little protection from refs. I have seen the footage of Nat Lofthouse shoulder charging a goalie into the net in a cup final:\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9HbX9DYy7dc\nTodays keepers, though play an attacking role which is, or should be, more than clearing the ball.\n150 Posted 11/06/2025 at 09:35:58\nThey were huge.\n151 Posted 11/06/2025 at 10:17:37\n152 Posted 11/06/2025 at 10:21:33\nHappy that Senegal won as they have two brilliant Evertonians in their team and they play good football.\n153 Posted 11/06/2025 at 10:32:19\n“Not sure if Jennings was the greatest goalie who ever lived.”\nWell, he wasn't. Big Nev was.\n154 Posted 11/06/2025 at 10:42:40\nOr did I dream that?\n155 Posted 11/06/2025 at 11:10:29\nDon't forget that his arms are too short. The evidence for me says Pickford has no peers in world football and has just about ensured the survival of Everton FC in recent years.\nHis domination of the goal area is just about total. He is possibly the reason that we are amongst the Premier League's best defences.\n156 Posted 11/06/2025 at 11:30:27\nHoward Kendall brought him in in 1986 as cover for Bobby Mimms after Southall got injured.\n157 Posted 11/06/2025 at 11:31:22\nWe've had more than our share of greats with big Nev and even Gordon West. To be fair though it can be a bit unfair comparing between eras given the massive changes in rules from stopping goals only to being a sweeper, defensive mid behind the back line (sorry about that description) and distributor of the ball when moving forward to effectively anywhere on the field. Pickford's distribution is superb.\n158 Posted 11/06/2025 at 12:10:46\n159 Posted 11/06/2025 at 12:44:02\nPat Jennings was a special goalie..shame he played for a lesser team...wink..\n160 Posted 11/06/2025 at 12:45:45\nBands and Yashin were standout guys in 66. Wow\n161 Posted 11/06/2025 at 12:53:38\nMany of these superb keepers of previous eras would find life hard now due to their limited technical skills.\nSome of these superb keepers modern keepers would have found it hard in the pre back pass era.\nI can’t remember Southall other than the very faded version. Martin is the best traditional GK I’ve seen for us - but couldn’t compete with Pickford in the modern era.\n162 Posted 11/06/2025 at 13:06:00\nWe got him at the wrong time. The back end of his career, signing for us aged 37 as backup to Richard Wright (yes, I know!!). Aged 37, he gave us 3 years.\nSadly, if the reports at the time were true, we could have signed him in his prime, but we allegedly cocked up the negotiations, so he opted for Leeds instead, even though Everton were supposedly his first choice.\nSouthall is without doubt the best Everton keeper I've seen.\nPickford can have 2nd place, now that his brain farts are less frequent. Nigel Martyn 3rd.\n164 Posted 11/06/2025 at 15:11:34\nIn regards to Pickford, the press and media were very quiet on Henderson letting 3 goals in to the part to just before they equalised, they took great joy in saying how injuries have given Pickford a free reign and how Henderson will be playing in Europe.\nStats do not lie, 76 appearances for England, 38 clean sheets, 9 penalty saves and only made one mistake leading to a goal, in a friendly v Belguim, not one single mistake leading to a goal in all competitive matches, has kept the most clean sheets in Tournements for England, even Beating Peter Shilton.\nIn the three games he did not play for England, Ramsdale conceded 4 goals v Hungry, Pope conceded 3 v Germany and Henderson 3 v Senegal, yet the press and media still put the boot in at every chance with Pickford.\nHad that been Pickford who let 3 goals in, he would have got hammered by the press and commentators.\nDynamite, too bloody right he is.\n165 Posted 11/06/2025 at 15:28:49\nThe media have never considered us fashionable, even when we were successful in the 80s. They so wanted Tottenham to pip us to the league, but Neville Southall saw to that.\nAnd then ruined their dream final in 1995 when they were literally gushing for a Tottenham v Manchester United final. But we dumped Spurs out of the cup at Elland Road, with Amokachi subbing himself, running on the pitch to replace Rideout, which in hindsight, Joe Royle knew nothing about. He scored two goals!!\nDidn't Richard Wright trip up and injure himself in a warm up, so that was Martyn in, and I think he stayed there.\n166 Posted 11/06/2025 at 15:42:40\nYou would have loved a guy on this side of the Atlantic a generation later, Jose Luis Chilavert of Paraguay. Same kind of untouchable arrogance. Would deliberately bowl over attacking forwards while collecting crosses, and then go charging upfield. Had a classic fight with Asprilla and tried to punch out Maradona. He was also one of the best free kick and penalty takers of his generation. Scored several in WC qualifiers.\nAndy #149, I played briefly in semipro with a guy who could do that, Jim Standen. He'd been with West Ham and was also a professional cricket bowler, so he had an arm like a missile launcher. He could sling the ball 60 yards and drop it right on my foot.\n167 Posted 11/06/2025 at 15:48:04\nFuck them.\nThey’ll hate it when we’re successful again.\nI’d rather listen to live football in Arabic or mute.\n168 Posted 11/06/2025 at 15:48:46\nTalk sport love nothing more than mocking any Everton fan who phones in.\nThe Richard Wright one I think he had just returned from his previous injury of falling out of his loft and injuring his shoulder, if I recall two goalies got injured before kick in the cup game so we had to use a third goal keeper, Ian Turners name is sticking in my head, Richard Wright went arse over tit on a sign in his goal saying keep of the grass, or something like that, damaging his ankle, think the other goalie tweaked something in the warm up\nBrain cells are not as sharp nowadays so hopefully posters will have a clearer recollection of events :-)\n169 Posted 11/06/2025 at 15:54:53\n170 Posted 11/06/2025 at 16:16:58\n171 Posted 11/06/2025 at 17:45:22\nWhen Woman’s football kicked off bigger in the nineties, Doncaster Belles were the top Womens team with only Arsenal being close to them, they brought the Womens game into more of a spotlight and the Womens game grew, for years Doncaster Belles were the top ladies football team, six times f a cup winners, 2 league titles and the only Womens team to be continuously been in the top flight since the national league was formed in 1991.\nAs the Premier league grew the Womens game started to raise it stock even further until eventually teams started forming Womens club teams the powers that be disrespected all that Doncaster Belles had achieved and so Man City could be included in the newly formed league, they demoted Doncaster Belles to league two to make way for Man City Ladies, Doncaster lost sponsorship and backing and have never recovered since then.\nThe very team that once graced the greatest Woman’s team will never compete again, against the power clubs of Chelsea, Man City etc where money is no object.\nPretty sure Arsenal got into the mens top flight by default as well back in the thirties or so.\nAll about money now and keeping those eating at the top of the table fat, while the men and Womens game has gone, with only the select few looked after at all costs.\n172 Posted 12/06/2025 at 00:51:32\nMasters is a prime example of a guy who bates us all (and himself no doubt) with his falseness and unaccountability, but he has predecessors aplenty.\nJust why I still watch professional football is a question that every corrupt season looms ever larger.\nBut re Jordan, he's rightly worthy of mention with Nev, Westy, Martyn, Jennings and the like - and he's dedicated to us.\nNeed anyone ask more?\n173 Posted 12/06/2025 at 04:13:17\n174 Posted 12/06/2025 at 06:53:19\nBrian @171, I don't confess to watch female football a lot, but I do follow it. You can see that the standard has improved a lot over the years, so credit to those who promoted and persevered with it.\nI remember the Doncaster Belles. Back to my point, if you're not fashionable, the media won't bother with you.\nWell, Everton, like an irritating wasp, are about to buzz in their ears both on the male and female side. One club, two stadiums.\nI see Arsenal have stated their female team will play at the Emirates from next season. I wasn't sure about our decision to keep Goodison, but now I think about it, a good move by the club. It will feel strange, but I believe the plan is to cover the upper stands with boards depicting the female team, leaving the Enclosure, front part of the Lower Gwladys, the Paddock and Park End available as seating.\nIt will also give me the opportunity to see if the Goodison Supper Bar (or whatever it's called now) can sort out the onions on my chips, peas and onion gravy!! They've not hit the mark to what my culinary tastes had become accustomed to over the years.\nDon @172. When UEFA's FFP, and later the Premier League's PSR came into play, I thought it sounded like a good idea. But no, it only serves to keep those at the top table at the top table. You need a Trojan horse to get in through the gates.\nGoing back even further, the whole concept of the Champion's League was designed to protect the elite media loved clubs. Using, let's say, Juventus as an example, if they didn't win the league, they would have been in the then UEFA Cup. So opening it up to 3 or 4 teams in the top leagues, it meant that certain clubs were guaranteed a place in the non-Champions League as they were always going to finish in places to qualify. It would be an interesting stat to see how many teams have won the \"Champions\" League, when they weren't actually champions.\nAgree with you Don on Pickford. Notwithstanding his ability, and you should never say never in football, but I can't see him playing for anyone else other than Everton.\nAnd he loves his chant. I'm convinced he sings along with us to it! It will be great when we play Sunderland next season. Home and away, I think both sets of supporters will be chanting that song. I think Sunderland may change \"he's a toffee through and through\" to \"he's a black cat through and through\", but the sentiment will be the same.\n175 Posted 12/06/2025 at 10:37:12\n176 Posted 12/06/2025 at 10:56:47\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
