It has been a tough few years and the society has been very supportive.”\nMs James’s father Alex was moved from his home in the Midlands with her mother, Doreen, 83, to a care home during the covid pandemic.\nShe said: “For my mum, who is young at heart, it has been particularly hard. My dad has been ill for a long time but it got very bad and unfortunately this coincided with the covid lockdown. She was isolated with him.\n“When he had to move into a care home we couldn’t see him, which was also hard. Watching my dad deteriorate the way he has is heartbreaking and it affects so many people. I think pretty much every family is affected in some way by the disease.\n“The Alzheimer’s Society has been amazing. The helplines are managed just by volunteers and the research it does is so important. The disease is affecting people younger and younger. If they can’t find a cure, it would be good to find ways of slowing it down.\n“The amount of money I have raised so far is amazing. I was totally blown away. I have received money on my JustGiving page and in cheques from neighbours. I am so touched. Someone I talk a lot to in Tesco has donated, people have been incredibly generous. It really spurs me on.\n“Long runs can be daunting and finding out someone has donated puts a spring in my step or a kick up my ass, however you want to say it. The more I can raise, the better — that’s what it’s all about.”\nMs James, who works part-time at Headway, the brain injury charity, has previously run the Henley 10km a few times, but says she has had to “ramp up” training in order to prepare for the marathon.\nShe said: “I’ve been training hard. I used to run quite a lot but it has dropped down in the last few years. I still occasionally jog but I mainly walk now. I had to ramp it back up for the marathon. I do quite a bit of cross training. I find it too much to just do a lot of running.\n“The Alzheimer’s Society has provided a really good training company’s plan. I do a long run on the weekend, normally Sundays, and during the week I do strength training, which I find really important. Sometimes in the evenings I will do a short run or else I dog walk.\n“The biggest challenge has been getting back into long runs and into the psychology of doing them. The highlights have been when I hit long runs.\n“When you put in the hours and realise you have been able to do it, you get a real high. I did struggle with my knees and, like everyone, had a stinking cold which knocked me out of training for a week, but they have mainly been highs for sure. I think: ‘Oh my goodness, am I really going to run this?’”\nTo manage the long runs, Ms James says she puts on “lots of loud music”. She said: “I have quite an eclectic playlist. It’s a mixture of good old house, songs that remind me of my parents and music from my son’s rowing playlist which makes me laugh.”\nShe says she feels a mixture of nervous and excited, adding: “It’s something I've wanted to do for a long time ever since I watched a friend compete some years back and the atmosphere was amazing.”\nCheering her on from the side-lines will be her son, Ben, 15, husband, Mark and mother, as well as lots of friends and her three brothers. She said: “I have received lots of lovely support, especially from my son. I think he is really chuffed that his mum is doing this.\n“He is my inspiration. He rows at his school and trains really hard. I often think about him when I am training. He said to me the other day: ‘Well, you can run 16 miles, walk 10 and you’ve done it’. That gave me such a lift, I hadn’t thought about it in that way.\n“I’ll get round the course but if I have to walk some, I will. I realised quite early on, after doing a 10km run and 12km walk in one day, I was shattered.\n“I thought: ‘Crikey, this isn’t even halfway and I've had lunch in the middle’. After that, I ramped up the training. I also want to take time to say hi to people who have come to support me. I think this will be my first and last marathon, so I want to take it all in and enjoy the atmosphere. Everyone says that carries you on.\n“I am looking forward to the bit when you start to hit big landmarks and run along the bank. Watching the runners go over Tower Bridge on television over the years is kind of cool. The start will be interesting as well. I can’t imagine 40,000 people assembled for a run. It is mind-blowing.”\nTo celebrate, Ms James says she will “find a pub, have a couple of beers, wobble home and have a big family meal with friends”.\nShe added: “I will probably go to sleep after that. If I can stand up, I’ll have a kitchen disco. Maybe a week after I will have a little celebration and have friends over.”\nTo donate, visit https://bit.ly/\n3ZZy5Dj\nKelly Hargreaves, 56, and her husband Ian, 59, of Newtown Gardens, Henley, will be racing together. This will be her eighth marathon and his fifth.\nMrs Hargreaves is running for MACs, which supports children born without eyes or with undeveloped eyes. The hairdresser has raced for the charity four times, raising more than £20,000.\nAlongside a weekly long run, the pair run three times a week and receive help from Millie, their daughter, who is a personal trainer.\nMrs Hargreaves says she mainly runs in the mornings due to her schedule, which has been “intense” because of the dark weather.\nShe said: “When we were training for the previous marathon, which took place in October last year, it was summer so the mornings were light. It has been tricky going back to the wet, winter months. “However, I spent January in Costa Rica so was able to run in the warmth which was nice. I also eat properly and fuel myself. Over the years of doing marathons, I have learnt what works. Hydrating yourself is really important.\n“I am feeling quite tired. The training is going well but I have suffered from plantar fasciitis, foot pain, which I have had for about a year. I do lots of physiotherapy and exercises but it is still quite painful.\n“I have done a fair few marathons and run quite a lot and it has taken its toll on my body.”\nMrs Hargreaves, who first did the London Marathon in 2013, said she loved the fundraising aspect of the race.\nShe said: “I love it because it keeps me fit and I like raising money. I wasn’t going to do it initially because we had only just done it in October, but I really wanted to do it for charity. It is a bit of an obsession; it’s a bit extreme.\n“My personal best is four hours and 44 minutes but I am getting older. I don’t want to beat myself up and I will just try to get round but I would love to run around that time.”\nShe describes running past the city’s landmarks as one of the highlights of the race. She said: “The support from the crowd is so addictive. This is the thing about the London Marathon: there are no quiet areas.\n“When you finish the Embankment stretch and come around to Buckingham Palace, it is great, as Embankment is probably the longest, hardest bit.”\nHer daughter and her boyfriend will be cheering them on. She said: “It will be great to see a friendly face on the course. You really look forward to the next few miles if you know there will be someone there waiting for you to pass by.\n“Afterwards I will have a nice meal and a couple glasses of bubbly. Normally we stay up there after as it is too congested to get back home.”\nTo donate, visit: https://2023\ntcslondonmarathon.enthuse.com\n/pf/kelly-hargreaves\nMary Galer, 43, from Goring, will run the marathon for a second time.\nShe first completed the race two years ago when she raised £5,000 for Daisy’s Dream, which supports children and their families who have been affected by the life-threatening illness or bereavement.\nMrs Galer said: “It was amazing — it was up there with one of the best days of my life alongside my wedding and the births of my children.”\nShe also ran the virtual marathon during the coronavirus pandemic which she said was “fantastic” despite the lack of crowds.\nMrs Galer said: “It was during Storm Alex, so pretty rainy. I ran two laps past the pub I used to run and the elation of finishing was amazing. There weren’t the crowds of the marathon and it wasn’t very flat.”\nShe is looking forward to running over Tower Bridge and seeing her son, Elliot, 13, and husband Nick waiting for her at the finish.\nMrs Galer, who is the food and beverage manager of Goring and Streatley golf club, has been undertaking a 16-week training programme which reaches a maximum of 22 miles.\nShe said: “I wouldn’t say I am an experienced runner, but I like to try. I used to do the Race For Life runs when my children were young, so I started around 10 years ago.”\nAlongside running, she plays football twice a week and takes exercise classes four times a week.\nMrs Galer said: “I am currently on the long, lonely mile. I have reached 18 miles of my training programme and run in all weathers, including temperatures of -7 degrees and running through wind, rain and sleet.\n“I fit in time around my job by getting up early or running later. I change my schedule.”\nThis time she is raising money for two charities, Bowel Cancer UK and Ronald McDonald House Charities, and hopes to raise at least £1,000 for each.\nMrs Galer said: “I lost my mother-in-law last September to bowel cancer and am also raising money for Ronald McDonald. A chef friend of mine has spent a lot of time in there with his poorly son, so I want to support that as well.\n“The support has been lovely and work has been great about it. I am lucky to have been supported so well.\n“The fundraising has not been too bad so far. I have had lovely support from work, which has allowed me to put my sponsorship forms in the club. I have also shared posts on social media.\n“Afterwards, to celebrate, I want to be with family, come home and probably have a glass of wine and a hot bath.”\nTo donate, visit https://bit\n.ly/3n3pDUP and https://bit.ly/\n3FCffKl\nKim Gelling, 42, is running the marathon for the first time in years in aid of adoption charity Parents And Children Together (PACT). This provides adoption services, specialist therapeutic support and inspirational community projects.\nMs Gelling, a sales director for baby food brand Ella’s kitchen, said: “I am a trustee of PACT, so have witnessed first-hand the passion, energy and care in the organisation to help vulnerable people, women and children, and the positive impact this has.”\nMs Gelling has already beaten her £2,000 fundraising target, raising more than £3,000 so far.\nShe said: “I am taking part with three friends and we’ve been training together which is great for keeping each other motivated.\n“I’ve run Berlin and Barcelona marathons many years ago, before I had my children, so I'm really looking forward to the atmosphere and home support of the London Marathon.\n“I can't wait to soak up the atmosphere and have my friends and family cheering me on.”\nTo donate, visit www.2023tcs\nlondonmarathon.enthuse.com\n/pf/kim-gelling\nMaz Elsome is running to raise money for Sue Ryder in honour of her late father.\nShe works at Barbara’s Antique and Bric-a-Brac shop in Goring and is selling pre-loved goods and some of her father’s paintings as part of her fundraising for the event.\nIf you have good quality items you would like to donate, visit the shop or donate to her JustGiving page on: https://bit.ly/3kAQQ0e\nMost read\nTop Articles\nA MAN from Henley was arrested on suspicion of murder on Sunday after a man was seriously injured in Dorset and later died in hospital.\nFlood warnings are in place on stretches of the River Thames following a period of heavy rainfall.\nPlayday nursery sites in Milestone Way and Hemdean Road notified parents on Monday evening of the closure, which Reading Borough Council has told the BBC could last until February 22.",
