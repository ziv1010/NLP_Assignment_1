[It felt like it was] just the two of us.\n\"It was only when we came back [to Nottingham] that we realised the impact because they put on a street parade.\n\"It was lined from where Jayne lived to the city centre. We were rock stars for a day.\"\nWiegman said she \"could never have imagined\" the \"respect and warmth\" from English people she has received since becoming England manager as she paid tribute to the efforts of those on the pitch.\n\"This title is a reflection of my exceptional team of players and staff,\" she said.\n\"Our team values mean that when there is recognition for one, then there is recognition for all. I'm proud to work alongside such a dedicated group of people.\"\nIn addition to Mitchell and Stratford's honours, Red Roses vice-captains Marlie Packer and Megan Jones are appointed an OBE and MBE respectively, with Sadia Kabeya and Ellie Kildunne both becoming MBEs.\nDescribing the moment she received the news by email, Kildunne said: \"I didn't know whether to cry or to laugh. I just wanted to call my mum.\n\"I texted her a screenshot and said: 'What does an MBE actually mean?'\n\"I'm super proud of myself and anyone that's on the list. To be decorated with such an award, it's cool.\"\nJones, whose parents passed away last year, said she was \"proud\" to receive the honour. She is sure her parents would have been delighted.\n\"I think they would just be over the moon,\" Jones told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"It's such a sad situation to be in. I wish I could have those moments with them.\n\"Now the cards I have got - I have a beautiful family and beautiful girlfriend Celia, who looks after me. Her family are amazing. I've got beautiful friends. They all look after me.\n\"I feel very honoured and kind of indebted to those people as well, because they've picked me up when I've needed them the most.\"\nShe added: \"I honestly did not expect it [the MBE]. It's something I probably had never really thought of getting.\n\"The bit you think of getting is winning the World Cup, so to receive that is a huge honour and massive privilege as well.\"\nRhys McClenaghan has been appointed an MBE for services to gymnastics.\nThe 26-year-old, from County Down, Northern Ireland, won a gold medal for Team Ireland in the pommel horse at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.\nFormer marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe becomes an OBE for services to sport.\nPresenter Gabby Logan and football commentator Clive Tyldesley are both made OBEs in recognition of their work in broadcasting and in the charity sector.\nLogan said: \"I was incredibly surprised to be awarded an OBE and it is a great honour. To see the changes in women's sport in nearly three decades in the job has been such a gratifying experience. I am incredibly proud.\"\nBroadcaster and former England cricketer Isa Guha is made an MBE for inclusivity and cricket.\nFormer Tottenham executive chairman Daniel Levy, who left the role in September after almost 25 years, is appointed a CBE for services to charity and to the community in Tottenham.\nEx-footballer Kerry Davis, who became England's first black woman international in 1982 and went
