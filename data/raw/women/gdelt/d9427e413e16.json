I couldn't be happier for them.\"\nShe added she was secretly dreading the Euro draw in Lausanne on 16 December but now \"she absolutely can't wait\".\n\"My first tournament as a UEFA Vice President with Cymru there competing. Cannot wait.\"\nAdding to the congratulations were players' family members, as defender Lily Woodham's mum Julie described the team as \"amazing\".\nSpeaking after the match, she said: \"I cant believe we've done it. Off to Switzerland.\"\nAlan Clark echoed the delight as he said was \"unbelievably proud\" of his daughter, Olivia Clark.\nHe said: \"She has fought for so long for so many years to get to this stage and she is Wales number one and she is in the Euros final - it is just unbelievable. I am so proud, brilliant.\"\nGareth Fishlock, Jess Fishlock's brother, said he was \"so happy\" for Jess and described the win as \"amazing for the country and everyone involved.\"\nEight-year-old Harlow, said she was \"so happy\" to be at the game with her dad in Dublin among a crowd of 25,832 supporters.\nSpeaking of the win, her father Joey Healey, 34, said the players have \"inspired the next generation of Welsh women football players.\"\n\"The sky's the limit now thanks to those girls and what they've done tonight.\"\nHe added that they were \"definitely off to Switzerland, but the wife doesn't know yet\".\nWales fan Vikky Perkins, 51, watched the game in Cardiff and said the grit shown by the women matches the Welsh spirit.\n\"It was impossible to breathe for the last ten minutes, Wales played with tenacity and sustained quality and it paid of,\" she added.\n\"Such an incredible achievement for these individuals, a huge moment for women's football and a proud moment for our country.\"\nRuth Billingham, 46, from Cardiff, admitted she was not really a football fan but Wales' journey has had her and her daughter gripped.\n\"What an inspiring win! We saw Wales play Ireland in Cardiff last week and it was a great atmosphere. Tonight was the icing on the cake. Bring on the euros!\" she said.\nHer dad, a Cardiff city and Wales supporter for 40 years, Nigel Billingham, spoke of it being a really emotional win for him.\nThe 76-year-old said: \"I've been to see both the games in Cardiff [play-off semi-final and first leg of the final] and it's tremendous the team will go to Switzerland.\"\n\"A great day for Welsh football,\" he added.\nJudy Shaw, 60, said after the team narrowly losing out so many times, she is \"absolutely buzzing\" at the result.\nShe said: \"I am shouting, screaming, bouncing around the room. After so many times we have come so close. Qualification for the Euros!\"\n\"Incredible amazing fantastic. Flights will be booked to Switzerland.\"\nHer daughter Holly Lewis, 28, was in Dublin and said she \"couldn't put into words how it feels\".\n\"There is nothing quite like following this team. Wales deserve this. They have deserved this for so long and I'm just so happy for the team that all their hard work has paid off.\n\"I think this will be really big for women's football in Wales. Hopefully it will encourage more people to come to games and support the team.\n\"This is the start of something and I can't wait to see what happens next.\"\nRhodri Williams, watched from a pub Cardiff and said he follows the men so it would be wrong for him not to head to Switzerland and support the women in their first major tournament next year.\nHe added: \"It was a really good performance from the girls, looking forward to heading out there next summer.\"\nSteffano Antoniazzi from Aberystwyth said he was very nervous but Wales \"defended resolutely\".\n\"We have seen such an uptake in the women's and men's football so hopefully this just kicks on and we can see more and more girls coming through the system.\n\"Who knows what the future holds.\"\nJon Foster said the VAR got his pulse going: \"I had no idea what was going on with the VAR check so it was a relief to see what way it went and Cain took it so well, you didn't get much cooler than that.\"\nThe 52-year-old added that the last 20 minutes were tense but they \"held on brilliantly\", adding that he thought \"Katie McCabe was pretty lucky to stay on as but I'm an Arsenal fan so I'll allow it.\"\nWales will find out on 16 December who their opponents are for Euro 2025.\nThe draw takes place in Lausanne, Switzerland, at 17:00 GMT and you will be able to watch and follow it live on the BBC.\nThey join European champions England in qualifying for next summer's tournament.\nAdditional reporting by Ellie Carter and Oscar Edwards",
