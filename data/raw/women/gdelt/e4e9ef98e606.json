Here is our monthly round-up of the criminals who have been locked up.\nOne of the most upsetting cases was the case of intoxicated driver Harley Whiteman who hit and killed a 13-year-old boy who was just standing outside a shop with a group of his friends. Whiteman went back to the scene and tried to prevent people treating Kaylan Hippsley, who died from his injuries in hospital.\nThe list also includes a man who struck his wife in the face with a pint glass after she found out he had been talking to another woman, and a thug who poured petrol on his ex-partner and threatened to kill her.\nThere was also the teen who stabbed a man he'd met online 14 times with a kitchen knife, and a woman who an intoxicated woman who bit and punched a committee member of a working men's club.\nHarley Whiteman\nThe intoxicated driver hit and killed a 13-year-old boy on the pavement before returning to the scene and drunkenly tried to prevent people from treating him. The \"cheeky chappie\" suffered multiple fatal injuries as a result of the collision and died days later in hospital.\nTeenager Kaylan Hippsley was struck and killed by a Ford Fiesta driven by Harley Whiteman, 19, on Brecon Road, Hirwaun, at around 6.15pm on February 29, as he was standing outside a Co-op store with his friends. He never regained consciousness despite the best efforts of those at the scene as the defendant drove off at speed. Read the family's heartbreaking victim impact statements here.\nPeter Briody\nThe husband struck his wife in the face with a pint glass after she found out he had been talking to another woman. The injury left her with cuts to her eyebrow, which required stitches, and swelling to her eye.\nBriody, 44, wounded his wife at their home in Barry on June 2 last year after he armed himself with the glass. He was initially given a suspended sentence by the court but it was later discovered he had exposed his penis at a hotel for which he was facing legal proceedings.\nJonathan Jones\nHe took a kitchen knife to a probation office \"for his own personal safety\", a court has heard. Jonathan Jones has a history of carrying knives and weapons in public places going back 20 years.\nThe defendant's advocate told Swansea Crown Court his client was appearing in the dock on his 40th birthday and being in prison for that milestone had given him a \"degree of objectivity\" about his life and made him realise he cannot continue to offend in the way he has been. Jones was sent down for eight months.\nEthan Rich\nThe sex offender who targets teenage girls wants to join the elite fighting unit the French Foreign Legion when he is released from prison, a court has heard.\nRich was handed an extended sentence of 12 years and nine months after returning to sexual offending just months after being released from his last prison sentence.\nDaniel Adams\nThe thug poured petrol on his partner and threatened to kill her after beating her up and strangling her. He had previously damaged a number of items in the victim's home including a microwave, washing machine, and an iPhone.\nAdams, 27, of Cwmbran, had been in a relationship with the victim for six years and they have a young child together. On January 28 police received a call at 12.03pm from a stressed-sounding woman who could be heard saying: \"Leave me alone Dan\" before the call came to an end.\nDexter Davies\nThe teenager stabbed a man he'd met online 14 times with a kitchen knife then lied that he'd been tricked into thinking his victim was a woman. The reason why Davies carried out the \"frenzied attack\" on the man he met on the dating site Grindr remains unknown.\nSending the defendant down for inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, a judge at Swansea Crown Court told the 18-year-old he was fortunate he was not being sentenced for murder. Davies showed no emotion during the hearing.\nSara Dale\nThe mum-of-11 repeatedly struck a woman to the face and chest with a metal dog chain as the victim sat in a car outside a pub. Dale believed the woman had been involved in an altercation with one of her daughters earlier that evening and had gone to the pub to confront her about it.\nCardiff Crown Court heard the victim suffered a serious eye injury in the beating as well as extensive bruising and swelling to her face and breasts. The defendant's barrister said the 41-year-old was \"fiercely protective\" of her children and her family was shocked by her behaviour.

Police raided the nightclub with a warrant issued under the Misuse of Drugs Act.\nJamie Steele\nHe crashed his car into a shop while fleeing from police officers who had noticed a broken tail light on his car. At the time of the incident Steele was out of prison on licence following a series of brutal attacks which saw him punching and stabbing students and assaulting people in a pub.\nFollowing his arrest for the driving offences the 29-year-old was recalled back to prison to serve the remainder of the nine-year sentence he was given for the previous drunken assaults. On that occasion the judge said he had no doubt Steele had \"the capacity to kill\".\nHelen Lawrence\nThe intoxicated woman bit and punched a committee member of a working men's club after she was thrown out for tipping over tables and shouting at people. The victim was left with a broken finger as a result of the assault.\nLawrence, 46, attacked Serena Thorne at Tonyrefail Workingmen's Club on July 13 last year after her drunken antics led to her being asked to leave.

He was being pursued after stealing two cans of oil from a shop.\nSmith, 35, was pursued by a security guard at What! in Rogerstone, Newport, on August 23 last year, but he was ignored by the thief who got into his tipper truck and drove off.

It was said he had become isolated and spent five years without leaving his flat.\nWatkins attended a doctor's appointment at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant on August 17 last year but became enraged with Dr Neil Scott after he told Watkins he had nothing medically wrong with him. The 34-year-old followed the doctor into his office and told him: \"Because of feminine people like you and women is why society is in the state that it is\". He then pulled off the doctor's glasses and threw a chair at him.\nTyrone Harding\nThe whereabouts of the \"prolific sex offender\" who is banned from going to every park in Swansea was unknown for more than five weeks after he turned off his phone and stopped reporting to the police. Harding has a history of exposing himself in public and of disobeying court orders designed to protect the public.\nSending the 45-year-old back to prison a judge said police needed to keep stringent controls on him when he is in the community and said the risks he poses to members of the public are obvious. He said Harding seemed \"undeterrable\" in his offending.\nGillian Gregory, Christopher Clark and John Whyte\nThe hapless gang that included Wylfa nuclear power station in their string of botched heists left behind DNA and tools at the scenes of their crimes. Four men, had travelled from Manchester to target industrial sites on Anglesey, where graffiti and faeces were left at the sites.\nThe crooks claimed to police they were on the island either to \"explore\" or for a football match, reports North Wales Live. But an angle grinder found in their possession suggested otherwise, as noted wryly by the judge during sentencing at Caernarfon Crown Court.\nBrendon Reynolds\nThe jealous man smashed his way into a former partner's house in the dead of night and fought another male who he accused of \"trying to get on my missus\". Reynolds was subject to a restraining order at the time of the incident which banned him from contacting the woman.\nSwansea Crown Court heard Reynolds also has another restraining order in place in regard to a different ex-partner and his barrister said the 30-year-old realises he has issues around \"trust and paranoia\" that he needs to address. Elin Morgan, prosecuting, said Reynolds was made the subject of a restraining order in respect of his former partner in December last year with the order to last for two years.\nAmet Muca\nThe gardener was discovered at a sophisticated cannabis factory with more than 130 plants which was housed in an old fancy dress shop. The cannabis grower had travelled to the UK from Albania after being \"seduced\" on the internet.\nMuca, 22, was found living at the cannabis factory in Upper Clifton Street, Cardiff, on January 31 where cannabis was being grown on an \"industrial scale\".

The thief was caught on CCTV, but was wearing dark clothing and covered his head.\nNathan Brown\nThe revving driver left cyclist Philip Pike with broken bones after knocking him off his bike.

Miles also made sick dark web rape threats.\nThe 30-year-old's barrister said the defendant was struggling with his mental health and with coming to terms with changes in \"family dynamics\", and he invited the court to impose a sentence that was \"more rehabilitative\" in nature. Sending Miles to prison for 21 months a judge at Swansea Crown Court said the victims must have been left \"fearing for their lives\" during the prolonged incident.\nRhys Jones\nThe young drug dealer was found with more than £35,000 worth of heroin after police saw him hiding under a pile of clothes.
