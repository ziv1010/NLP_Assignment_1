  "body_text": "Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a sweeping New Year address on December 31, 2025, signaling China’s determination to expand its global influence while reinforcing domestic stability and technological self-reliance. Speaking from the Presidential Office in Beijing, Xi sought to position China as a confident, assertive actor on the world stage as the country enters the Year of the Horse, a symbol in Chinese culture of progress, energy, and strategic momentum. The address, widely reported by state media and analyzed by Times UK, reflected Xi’s intent to consolidate power and set a clear agenda for the next phase of his third five-year term, which expires in 2027.\nCentral to Xi’s remarks was a call for China to play a more ambitious international role. Breaking with decades of rhetoric focused primarily on domestic development, Xi framed China as a “force for stability and progress” in a world characterized by turbulence and conflict. He reiterated the need for China to promote a “global governance initiative” offering an alternative to what state officials describe as a “western-led order,” which Xi and his aides have increasingly criticized as fostering instability, particularly in the Global South. Xi underscored that China seeks cooperation with all nations “to advance world peace and development and build a community with a shared future for humanity,” a phrasing long used in official Chinese rhetoric but now infused with renewed assertiveness following global geopolitical shifts in 2025.\nThe address also reinforced Beijing’s long-standing stance on Taiwan. Xi declared the reunification of the mainland and Taiwan an “unstoppable trend of history,” echoing the intensive military drills China carried out around the island during 2025. These exercises, described as the largest and most complex in decades, simulated a total blockade and involved both missile launches and large-scale amphibious maneuvers, intended as both a show of strength and a warning to the United States, Japan, and other regional actors. Analysts noted that the maneuvers highlighted Beijing’s growing confidence in its ability to project military power across the Taiwan Strait.\nOn the domestic front, Xi celebrated achievements under China’s 14th Five-Year Plan (2021–2025), including reaching a national GDP of approximately 140 trillion yuan ($20 trillion), the expansion of high-tech industries, and progress in key areas such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and semiconductor research. Xi emphasized the need for continued technological self-reliance, particularly in the face of ongoing U.S. export restrictions, underscoring Beijing’s determination to ensure that critical industries are less vulnerable to foreign influence. He also highlighted anti-corruption campaigns within the Communist Party and military, framing them as essential to maintaining governance effectiveness and social stability.\nXi’s speech coincided with a continuation of the purges of senior military and Party officials that began more than two years ago, which have further consolidated his control. In 2025, nine generals, including two members of the Central Military Commission and one politburo member, were expelled for alleged corruption, reinforcing Xi’s message that no one within the military hierarchy is immune from scrutiny. Analysts cited by Times UK described this as a deliberate demonstration of authority, ensuring that Xi remains unchallenged as his third term progresses. The elevation of General Zhang Youxia to a prominent role in the Central Military Commission further signals Xi’s strategy to maintain tight control over the armed forces.\nThe New Year address also launched China’s 15th Five-Year Plan (2026–2030), focusing on high-quality development, innovation-driven growth, environmental sustainability, and the goal of “common prosperity for all.” The plan emphasizes targeted support for national champions in advanced technology sectors, continuing Beijing’s approach of state-led industrial policy while promoting urbanization and regional development. However, economists and independent observers note persistent imbalances, including stagnant household consumption, high youth unemployment, and a property market that has yet to recover from the collapse of the post-pandemic real estate bubble. Xi acknowledged the challenges implicitly, stressing the need for proactive macroeconomic measures, but offered no major structural reforms in the immediate term.\nXi’s economic vision continues to emphasize the duality of state control and market forces — what he describes as “socialism with Chinese characteristics.” While urban tech hubs like Shanghai and Shenzhen thrive, many regions outside the major cities face stagnation. Analysts warn that this divide could slow domestic demand and hinder efforts to rebalance the economy toward consumption-driven growth. Yet Xi remains committed to fostering innovation and strategic industries, particularly in artificial intelligence, semiconductors, green energy, and biotechnology, while ensuring that China’s global trade competitiveness is maintained.\nThe address also reflected on China’s diplomatic and economic engagement with the world. Xi celebrated successes in managing a complex relationship with the United States, which in 2025 included both periods of tension and strategic dialogue, particularly around trade and tariffs. While Xi portrayed China’s economic model as stable and attractive, he criticized Western inconsistencies and framed China as a reliable partner, especially for developing countries. Xi’s rhetoric emphasized the importance of peaceful development but suggested that China would continue to protect its interests assertively, particularly in regions like the South China Sea, Africa, and Latin America, where Beijing has deepened economic ties through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative.\nDespite this outward focus, the speech was clear about internal priorities. Xi called for “strengthening the Party’s leadership over all aspects of governance” and continued anti-corruption measures as central to maintaining the legitimacy of the Communist Party. Analysts cited by Times UK interpreted these remarks as a signal that Xi intends to remain at the helm through the end of his current term and possibly beyond, with no clear succession plan in place. The political landscape within China remains tightly controlled, with potential rivals sidelined or promoted in ways that reinforce loyalty to Xi personally.\nThe Year of the Horse, Xi suggested, offers an opportunity to demonstrate resilience and strategic foresight. China’s military modernization, technological ambitions, and expanding global footprint, according to state media, position the country to “seize the initiative in a changing world.” Observers note that Xi’s emphasis on continuity, control, and global influence reflects a long-term vision for China as both an economic and geopolitical power, signaling confidence in his leadership and a desire to assert China’s role on the international stage.\nXi’s New Year speech was closely watched internationally for hints about policy shifts, succession plans, and economic strategy. While it emphasized stability and continuity, it also reinforced Beijing’s assertive stance in regional security matters, particularly with regard to Taiwan and the South China Sea. Military exercises around Taiwan, combined with continued modernization of the People’s Liberation Army, underscore China’s readiness to project power and defend territorial claims, even as the global economy faces uncertainties.\nEconomically, Xi’s remarks signal a continued reliance on strategic sectors to drive growth, alongside modest policy measures aimed at boosting domestic consumption and mitigating social inequalities. Analysts caution that without broader reforms to address labor market imbalances and household income disparities, the consumption-led growth necessary to sustain long-term economic stability may remain elusive. Nevertheless, Xi’s messaging emphasized confidence in China’s economic model and a belief that targeted innovation and investment can drive continued prosperity.\nIn conclusion, Xi Jinping’s 2026 New Year address signals a China poised to assert its influence globally while managing internal challenges. His commitment to military readiness, technological advancement, and Party discipline underscores a leadership style that values control, continuity, and strategic foresight. As the country enters the Year of the Horse, Xi’s message is clear: China will continue to rise, promote its vision of global governance, and safeguard its domestic and international ambitions, even as it navigates economic, social, and geopolitical complexities. Times UK analysts describe the address as a reaffirmation of Xi’s consolidation of power and China’s growing role on the global stage, highlighting a leadership confident in its capacity to shape the future of the 21st century.\nHere is the full text of the President X’s New Year Message,\nOn New Year’s Eve, Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered his 2026 New Year message through China Media Group and the internet. The following is the full text of the message:\nGreetings to all! Year after year, life opens a fresh chapter. As the new year begins, I extend my best wishes to you from Beijing!\nThe year 2025 marks the completion of China’s 14th Five-Year Plan for economic and social development. Over the past five years, we have pressed ahead with enterprise and fortitude, and overcome many difficulties and challenges. We met the targets in the Plan and made solid advances on the new journey of Chinese modernization. Our economic output has crossed thresholds one after another, and it is expected to reach RMB 140 trillion yuan this year. Our economic strength, scientific and technological abilities, defense capabilities, and composite national strength all reached new heights. Clear waters and lush mountains have become a salient feature of our landscape. Our people enjoy a growing sense of gain, happiness and security. The past five years have been a truly remarkable journey, and our accomplishments have not come easily. Your unwavering hard work has made our nation thrive and prosper. I salute you all for your exceptional diligence and invaluable contributions.\nThis year is full of indelible memories. We solemnly commemorated the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People’s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War, and established the Taiwan Recovery Day. These grand national events were majestic and powerful, and the glory of victory will shine through the pages of history. They are inspiring all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation to remember history, honor fallen heroes, cherish peace, and create a better future. They are rallying a mighty force for the great rejuvenation of our nation.\nWe sought to energize high-quality development through innovation. We integrated science and technology deeply with industries, and made a stream of new innovations. Many large AI models have been competing in a race to the top, and breakthroughs have been achieved in the research and development of our own chips. All this has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest growing innovation capabilities. The Tianwen-2 probe began its star-chasing journey to explore asteroids and comets. Construction of the hydropower project at the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River started. China’s first aircraft carrier equipped with an electromagnetic catapult system was officially commissioned. Humanoid robots did kung fu kicks, and drones performed spectacular light shows. Inventions and innovations have boosted new quality productive forces and added colorful dimensions to our lives.\nWe endeavored to nurture our spiritual home with cultural development. There was a surging public interest in cultural relics, museums, and intangible cultural heritage. A new Chinese cultural site was added to the World Heritage List. Cultural IPs such as Wukong and Nezha became global hits. The younger generation came to deem classic Chinese culture as the finest form of aesthetic expression. The cultural and tourism sectors thrived. The “super league” football games in our cities and villages attracted numerous fans. Ice and snow sports ignited people’s passion for the winter season. Tradition is now embracing modernity, and the Chinese culture is shining in even greater splendor.\nWe joined hands to build a better life and enjoyed it together. I attended celebrations in Xizang and Xinjiang. From the snow-covered plateau to both sides of the Tianshan Mountains, people of various ethnic groups are united as one, like seeds of a pomegranate sticking together. With white khatas and passionate singing and dancing, they expressed their love of the motherland and the happiness they enjoy. No issue of the people is too small; we care for every leaf and tend every branch in the garden of people’s well-being. Over the past year, the rights and interests of the workforce in new forms of employment have been better protected, facilities have been upgraded to bring more convenience to the elderly, and each family with childcare needs has received a subsidy of RMB 300 yuan per month. When the happy hum of daily life fills every home, the big family of our nation will go from strength to strength.\nWe continued to embrace the world with open arms. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit in Tianjin and the Global Leaders’ Meeting on Women were very successful; and island-wide special customs operations were launched in the Hainan Free Trade Port. To better address climate change, China announced new Nationally Determined Contributions. After announcing the three global initiatives on development, security, and civilization, I put forward the Global Governance Initiative to promote a more just and equitable global governance system. The world today is undergoing both changes and turbulence, and some regions are still engulfed in war. China always stands on the right side of history, and is ready to work with all countries to advance world peace and development and build a community with a shared future for humanity.\nNot long ago, I attended the opening ceremony of the National Games, and I was glad to see Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao coming together in unity and acting in unison. We should unswervingly implement the policy of One Country, Two Systems, and support Hong Kong and Macao in better integrating into the overall development of our country and maintaining long-term prosperity and stability. We Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait share a bond of blood and kinship. The reunification of our motherland, a trend of the times, is unstoppable!\nOnly a strong Communist Party of China can make our country strong. We launched the study and education program on fully implementing the central Party leadership’s eight-point decision on improving Party and government conduct. We exercised strict governance of the Party through credible measures, and promoted the Party’s self-revolution to fight corruption and advance healthy governance. As a result, the conduct of our Party and government steadily improved. We must stay true to our original aspiration and founding mission, and pursue our goal with perseverance and dedication. We should continue to give a good answer to the question on how to maintain long-term governance put forth in a cave dwelling in Yan’an and prove ourselves worthy of the people’s expectation in the new era.\nThe year 2026 marks the beginning of the 15th Five-Year Plan. A successful venture should start with a good plan and with clear goals set. We should focus on our goals and tasks, boost confidence, and build momentum to press ahead. We should take solid steps to promote high-quality development, further deepen reform and opening up across the board, deliver prosperity for all, and write a new chapter in the story of China’s miracle.\nThe dream lofty, the journey long-bold strides will get us there. Let us charge ahead like horses with courage, vitality, and energy, fight for our dreams and our happiness, and turn our great vision into beautiful realities.\nThe sun of the new year will soon rise. May our great motherland stand in magnificence! May the fields across the country deliver good harvest! May our nation bathe in the glory of the morning! May you all enjoy life to the fullest, and achieve every success! May all your dreams come true!",
