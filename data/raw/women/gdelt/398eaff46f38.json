  "body_text": "Ask The Old Guy: Ready to get to training camp\nCHARLOTTE We're almost there, friends.\nWe've survived summer break, and we've endured list season. We've had to absorb a content stream that's growing increasingly ridiculous, including a segment of the internet that seemed to think inventing hypothetical trades and then refuting them was a good idea.\n(Seriously, it's OK to not consume every bit of content that's created. Be more discerning.)\nAnd next week, it becomes real again. Rookies will roll in with their bags next Monday, veterans will follow suit on Tuesday, and Wednesday, we will have arrived real live training camp football practice.\nWe'll see how rookie wideoutTetairoa McMillanfits into an offense that brought back all its starters. We'll see howXavier Legettegrows alongside him. We'll see howa completely rebuilt defense comes together and how much progress they can make.\nMost importantly, those things don't have to be abstract concepts anymore. It's real football. There's a week until the pads go on (that's the following Monday), but it's coming.\nThe offseason is almost over. The questions can be about actual stuff after this week.\n------------------------------------------------------\nHi Darin, I have two questions regarding the Panthers' training camp this year. My first question is, why aren't the Panthers having back-to-camp practice open to the public, besides having Fan Fest open to the fans? Either by hosting it in Wofford or at BOA? My other question is, without fans able to attend training camp this year outside of Fan Fest, will Panthers.com stream training camp practice without the annoying music playing in the background?Shaked, Charlotte\nFirst things first, not having fans at camp is not ideal. But it's also the price of progress, as the Panthers are building their indoor facility behind Bank of America Stadium, and for the safety and security of fans, you can't really invite them into an active construction site. So instead, Fan Fest is the best chance to see a practice, andthere's room for lots and lots more people.\nOnce they decided to bring camp home, the benefits became clear for the football team. The equipment staff doesn't have to pack up all its stuff, move it, set it up again, house a small army of players, coaches, and staff, etc. So players and coaches will be able to meet in their own rooms, work out in familiar spaces, and have all the perks associated with home (from the full training room to cafeteria, locker room, and everything else).\nAnd it's obvious from looking around the league that many people agree. Only six teams are going away to camp anymore, choosing continuity and familiarity.\nTo compensate for the lack of fans, we're working night and day to bring you more of the good stuff you want at Panthers.com and all our associated channels. From live streaming during practice (music being annoying is a matter of artistic preference), to expanded written, photo, video, and podcast content (Happy Half Hour every day for your ride home from work, plus on video at our YouTube channel), we're doing everything we can to fill the gap.\nWe know fans want this stuff, and we take our responsibility to deliver it seriously. We do it for the people.\n------------------------------------------------------\nOK Darin, needing your crystal ball on this one. I've been a Panthers fan since 1995, and I've been playing fantasy football for many years. I typically avoid picking Panthers players so that if they don't perform well on Sunday, I'm only let down once. I REALLLLLY want to pickBryce Youngthis year as my QB1, and I feel he will be available in later rounds just based on the media not giving him his \"flowers\" yet. Am I making a mistake if I pick him as my QB1? I'd love to haveAdam Thielenand TMac to pair with him, too. I'm sure I'll have to reach a bit for Tetairoa, but if I do, do you see him coming in and getting 7-10 targets a game, or do you see (in your crystal ball) him needing some time to grow and polish his fundamentals before he gets volume? Chase, Greensboro, NC\nWell, the crystal ball remains in Ben McAdoo's other pants,but the trophy from my church men's group fantasy league remains on my desk at home.Just saying. (I actually took a 21-year break from fantasy football, after my revolutionary strategy of picking all of Steve Spurrier's Washington quarterbacks in 2002 didn't quite pan out. I declared the night of the draft that with Patrick Ramsey, Danny Wuerffel, and Shane Matthews, I was going to finish either first by a mile or last by a mile. And I was right.)\nChase, I feel you not wanting to compound your emotions, but the reality is, local players always get overdrafted, so even if you don't want to take Panthers too high, somebody in your league will. One of your buddies will take the Panthers' backup running back (thoughRico Dowdlewouldn't be a bad play late), third tight end, and fourth wide receiver. Just wait and see.\nThat said, there's probably value in Bryce if he continues to spread it around the way he did late last year. But the spreading is the part that makes it risky to over-invest in his WR targets. If you look back at that coconuts finale in Atlanta, the 44-38 overtime win, he threw for three touchdowns (and ran for two), but he completed passes to nine different dudes, and his leading receiver wasJalen Cokerwith seven catches for 62 yards.\nBut McMillan is different. They drafted him eighth overall for a reason. He has the opportunity to make a bunch of plays, but so do Legette and Thielen andJa'Tavion Sanders, and they still have this guy namedChuba Hubbardin the backfield ahead of Dowdle. But Bryce is well-protected, has targets, and hasn't captured the national imagination yet. So I could see it, if you're using all your higher picks on running backs and receivers and tight ends.\n------------------------------------------------------ Hi, Darin. This is a non-football question, but it is the offseason, so I figured it was a good time to clear some of the trivial clutter taking up valuable memory in my ever-aging brain.\nThe Panthers' coaches, field staff, and inactive players - like those in the rest of the league - are regularly outfitted with newly designed game day gear throughout the season. Much of it appears to be worn just once. What happens to those (snug-fitting, for Dave Canales) shirts, hoodies, hats, etc.? I assume most folks prefer to leave work at work, or maybe the garb isn't allowed to even leave the stadium? Anyway, just a July curiosity. Time to dodge another thunderstorm. Thanks, Darin!John, Winston-Salem, NC\nYes, there's a lot of gear floating around this building. And the team-issued equipment you see the players and coaches wearing on the sidelines is theirs to wear as long as they need it (the only single-use gear is for special events like Crucial Catch or similar occasions). Some coaches and players will keep it around the house, wear it to mow the lawn or whatever. If they have kids, that's the likeliest destination, as teenagers love to shop in their parents' closets. When a player is acquired in a trade or claimed off waivers, those clothes become valuable until they can get their own stuff shipped to them or actually buy clothes of their own.\nWith football equipment, like cleats, the equipment staff will donate leftovers to local high schools and colleges. But the clothing pretty much stays with the owners to do with as they please, and could end up anywhere including your local Goodwill.\n------------------------------------------------------\nHey. Cancer. Year 2. It's a bitch. People who got it need to be open about it, not in a sorrowful way, but in a \"made it this long\" way. But only if you're 70, like I am. I hate it for young people. And then some young girls at a camp get swept away in a flood. Puts it all in perspective. My bucket list is pretty small and doesn't involve leaving the south or my back porch, for that matter.\nWe went to my first Hurricanes game, bought tickets on the floor, and had the good fortune to be across the section from Xavier at his first hockey game. What a joyful, happy human being! He's going to be a star, on and off the field. I love that guy. He's a \"hoot,\" which is my Southern mother's description of anyone who always seems to be having a rip-roaring good time. I'm predicting great things for that kid! Agreed?Jimmy, Wilmington, NC\nI think the best word I can use to describe Legette is \"genuine.\" There are probably a lot of people who see him at hockey games, the Kentucky Derby, or on social media and think it's an act. It is not.\nOne of the best parts ofthe recent Minnesota retreat with his teammateswas seeing them encourage him to get into the lake, even though he couldn't see the bottom. His concern was real. As was his laughter. So yes, he is absolutely a hoot.\nBut one of the more instructive parts of OTAs and minicamp was seeing the way he's elevated his game. He walked in the door big and fast, but he's learning more about his craft, and looked more polished this spring than he did at any point last year. Also, he's joining Hubbard and the try-hards at the Jugs machine after practice, or coming in to work when the building's largely empty, committing to the work nobody sees.\nJimmy, we know you are also a hoot and not afraid to put in the work. So Keep Pounding, as the man said, and keep stacking good days and appreciating each one for the gift it is. We're all behind you.\n------------------------------------------------------\nGreetings, Darin, from the First Family of the Mailbag! Each of us has a question, but we're not expecting you to answer both in the same mailbag.\nMy question: I'm a retired college professor, so I'm curious about how practice is structured for learning, especially during training camp. What does an \"installation\" look like, and how is it different from a \"\"walk-through? Do position coaches devise drills for the specific players or player groups, or do they have a bunch of drills they've used over their careers? What does such a drill look like?\nLaura's question: Almost every player who signs with the Panthers tells the press about how they are immediately welcomed and treated like they are part of a family. We hear some mentions of the coaching staff, but what does the rest of the staff do that seems to make such a strong impression?\nFinally, from a college professor: GET BACK TO CLASS, ZACH! (Oh my, that felt good.)Scott and Laura, Cheshire, MA\nNot everyone gets multiple questions, but exceptions can be made for dignitaries. And naturally, Laura gets hers answered first.\nThe vibes are real, and begin with being genuine. When Canales talks to people, he's hyper-focused on them in a way that others aren't. Even his eye contact is intentional. But he also knows this is a relationship business, so his interest in the people he works with is about more than just being a good dude. And that's contagious. You see it throughout the staff, whether it'sthe perpetually upbeat Bernie Parmalee, or the high energy of a veteran like defensive line coach Todd Wash,or a newcomer like outside linebackers coach AC Carter. Canales was looking for particular traits in the people he hired, so it's natural that there are some similarities among them.\nAnd they tend to get along. The coaches are playing golf together this weekend, on their last free weekend before the long campaign ahead of them. It might seem like a small thing, but the people you choose to be around away from the office are obviously priorities in your life.\nAs for the particulars of installation, they teach in a very precise way. As offensive coordinator Brad Idzik described it, the process goes through a number of steps.\nWhen they're introducing new material, they'll give it to the players on their tablet computers beforehand, then install it in a meeting. The expectation to have studied it in advance is made clear. The walk-through is generally the first time they put it together on grass, where players line up and go through the motions of the play at less than game speed (hence the name).\nIn terms of individual drills, coaches usually bring their own. Some are hands-on, some stand back and yell instructions, some are bouncing from spot to spot to give individual attention. When Carter was working with rookie pass-rushersNic ScourtonandPrincely Umanmielenthis spring, he'd put his hands on their shoulders and have them lean their weight into him to emphasize the need to stay low coming out of their stance. Offensive line coach Joe Gilbert will use a volleyball or sandbags to show his guys where he wants their hands to be. Everybody's a little different, but as long as they're teaching the same techniques, the teaching methods can vary.\nKind of like the tough love we all use on Zach. I'm sure wherever he is, he needs to hear it.\n------------------------------------------------------\nHi Darin! Long-time Panthers fan here since the franchise launched when I was 9. Grateful for the years of wisdom and insider knowledge you share through this Mailbag.\nMy question is about Rico Dowdle. I suspect Chuba will rightly get most of the touches this year, but Dowdle seems like a beast and arguably had an equally impressive year in Dallas in 2024 compared to Hubbard. How has he looked in minicamp, and how often do you think we might see him in the lineup this year?David, Midlothian, VA\nWell, you don't take Chuba Hubbard off the field that much because he's earned the reps, but Dowdle is a guy they'll use, for sure. He also went for over 1,000 yards last year.\nRunning back is such a physical position that you have to have more than one of them. As durable as Hubbard is (he's missed just four games in four seasons), you always have to be prepared.\nAnd just from watching OTAs, you can tell they have some plans in mind for Dowdle, who is also a good receiver out of the backfield and dangerous in the open field. You find ways to use guys like that.\n------------------------------------------------------\nHi Darin! I've been quiet for a while, but I do have a question for you. From what I can see, the Panthers have gotten no return on their investment inJonathon Brooks, at least so far. Seems like he is injury-prone. Isn't it time to cut the cord and invest that money in a player that can actually produce some results?Jim, Timberlake, NC\nDang, tough room for July.\nThe man's been injured once since he's been here (and it was the same knee as his college injury), so it's probably unfair to call him injury-prone.\nHe was definitely unlucky last year, and sometimes it's as simple as that. It's actually frustrating to hear players defined that way, because this is a violent game, and something beyond your control shouldn't be used as character assassination. Dan Morgan was never hurt in college, and had a string of unfortunate injuries when he was playing here, including a broken ankle that came when Brett Favre stiff-armed him, and some sod that hadn't taken root well flew out from under his feet. Was that his fault? No.\nIt doesn't make any sense to part ways with Brooks now. Dowdle's on a one-year deal as Hubbard's backup, so the door is open for Brooks to come back for the role they envisioned for him originally in 2026. He's been a dynamic back when he's on the field, averaging 6.1 yards per carry in college at Texas.\nAnd for now, he's working out and doing his part, so he's ready for that opportunity when the time comes.\n------------------------------------------------------\nHappy 4th of July! Darin,you also made a list! In the Packers Insider Inbox(I read this to keep up with my brother's favorite team), Wes Hodkiewicz listed Charlotte as his No. 5 favorite away city. His reason being, . . . You! How's that for some props! Enjoy the rest of your time before training camp begins. :)Jan, Flat Rock, NC\nThis is why we love Young Wes.\nBut, fifth? Seriously. This man has been in my home, eaten my food, listened to my stories for years, and the best I can do is fifth?\nI'd have probably put Green Bay in my top two because of him (and Rob Demovsky and Jason Wilde and others), but it's now fifth on my list because spite.\nKidding, of course. Young Wes is among my people and will forever be Young Wes, no matter how old he gets.\nAnd for giving me a chance to needle him a little, I'm making Jan this week's Friend Of The Mailbag, and getting the appropriate honorarium on the way to her. Young Wes can go kick rocks.\n------------------------------------------------------\nHi Darin. Long-time listener, first-time caller. Being from London, I grew up around The Other Football (and live close by Leyton Orient's stadium, where Tottenham's women's team play their home games, no less).\nIt was the start of the 2015 season when a friend of mine suggested I pick a team in order to \"get into\" the NFL. I had a black cat at the time (Olive) and so the Panthers seemed as good a choice as any (the fact one of my favourite shows - can you guess which? - was shot in the Carolinas only added flavour). Ten years later, and I'm finally making that call I mentioned. Having started following the year of that Super Bowl run, I've been here for the highs, lows, and everything in between. I am excited for the season ahead, whatever it may bring. One day I hope to come to BOA stadium with my family and maybe visit a certain Creek not that far away.\nBut before I get [even more] sentimental, I wanted to ask - following your wonderful article about fellow Englishman,Mapalo Mwansa- if you had any anecdotes about another one of the reasons I decided upon the Panthers: expatriate, Efe Obada? I have loved following his journey and certainly enjoy reading articles about the players on the international pathway. Hope springs eternal.\nWith the above in mind, I have a follow-up question: Who do you think is the international player who has had the greatest success/impact on the game? And cheers to you and the whole media team for keeping me so engaged despite living so many miles away. Up the O's!/Keep PoundingJonathan, Leyton, London UK\nLove this. It's truly an international game.\nAndMaz Mwansa has been one of my favorite stories of the summer.\nHe's months into playing football, after spending his youth in England playing other sports. But once the hook was set, he dropped everything, literally, to come be a part of the league's International Player Pathway program. He was working as an accountant and put it all on hold to come here and give this new sport a shot.\nHe's had a lot of mentors in his short time in the program, and clearly looks up to Obada, who made the 2017 team here and became the first IPP player to make a 53-man roster. And oh by the way, he was the NFC defensive player of the week in his first game after recording a sack and an interception against the Bengals.\nObada carved out a very good NFL career for himself, seven years so far, 15.0 sacks, including 5.5 for the Panthers in 2020.\nBut as good as that is, the best player to come out of the IPP is clearly Eagles tackle Jordan Mailata.\nThe former Australian rugby player was taken in the seventh round by the Eagles as a project based on his size (6-8, 365) and athleticism, and earned All-Pro honors and a Super Bowl ring last season.\nMwansa has a long way to go to learn the game, but he has the kind of speed a 4.45-second 40 at 230 pounds to make him an interesting project. They could keep him for the year on the practice squad with a free spot, and longtime Falcons defensive end John Abraham, who worked with Mwansa in Florida, hopes that happens.\n\"I'm hoping he gets the opportunity to give it a few years,\" Abraham said. \"I think he has the potential to be a very good player, and I'm not just saying that because I got a chance to coach him. I'm saying that because he stuck out from everyone. And like I said, he's 21 years old.\n\"Once he gets the knowledge of the game, his flow is gonna get so much better because physically he has everything you need. The biggest thing he has is his brain, man. The guy is just such a smart guy. When you see a guy who can leverage his mind with his body, you're going to have a great player. If you talk to the guy, he doesn't have any distractions. It's not like he's, 'Oh, I got to go home for this, or I've got to do this, I've got to do that.' His family understands that he has a great opportunity. His family is behind him. He's looking for the bigger goal. But, he can end up being a good player.\"\nIt's worth remembering that it took Obada three years of being on practice squads to make an active roster, but once he did, he made a difference. So it's also worth remembering that Mwansa is just 21, an age at which many NFL aspirants are still playing college football.\n------------------------------------------------------ Hey, Darin, hope you're staying as cool as possible. I'm looking forward to the upcoming season, but I have one lingering question from last year that I need your perspective on: if \"that\" Bryce Young TD pass were a hot dog, what hot dog would it be? I'm stuck between the fact that the best hot dogs are the classics (in my humble opinion) and the need to add a little something special (spicy seems appropriate, but you're the expert). Please help a friend out.Steve, Chapel Hill, NC\nThis is a great offseason question.\nI'm a sandwich anarchist, but a hot dog purist.\nFirst off, hot dogs are definitely sandwiches. Anything that includes a food product surrounded by another food product shares that distinction. Corn dogs are sandwiches on a stick. Burritos are tubular sandwiches. Sushi rolls are a sideways sandwich. Tacos are just open-faced sandwiches. Pop-Tarts are stale jelly sandwiches. Ravioli are just finger sandwiches unless you're with a bunch of fussy people who insist on forks. Ice cream sandwiches are obviously sandwiches; it's right there in the name.\nBut for me, a native of North Carolina, hot dogs generally come one way chili, slaw, yellow mustard, and white onions. I ate approximately a thousand of them from Shell's Barbecue on Springs Road (RIP) and the Claremont Cafe during my formative years in Catawba County (which might be why the suit I wore to college scholarship interviews was bigger than the one I was most recently married in). And even here in the big city, I try to find one when I can (with Brooks' Sandwich House on Brevard coming close to the ideal). When I went to Iceland in the spring, I ate at least six of their lamb-based dogs in a week. They use raw white onions, crispy fried onions like on top of a green bean casserole, and three sauces a less-sweet ketchup, a mayo-based remoulade, and a sweet brown mustard. They're delicious, but particular to their place. Not sure it would hit the same here.\nBut that touchdown, the no-look job in Atlanta, that was beyond the norm. Pinky's down at the bottom of the hill from the stadium has one called the El Santo with chili, Fritos, jalapeos, and sour cream that is a nice change of pace, and it brings the right amount of heat. That feels right, in the spirit of Steve's question.\nAlso, hot dogs. Mmmmmm. Be right back.\n------------------------------------------------------\nHey Darin, this may be a bit too meta of a question for the Mailbag, but it's the dead zone of the NFL Offseason right now, and there's not much else going on. I'm also going to be mildly vague in how I ask because I'm not sure how you (or the team website) would feel about tangentially advertising for another podcast/product. Anyway, with that preamble done:\nRecently,a well-known football podcast did their annual episode trying to determine who is the \"Prime Meridian\" of NFL Quarterbacks. Once upon a time, these gentlemen referred to that title (position?) by another name, TheAndy DaltonLine. This week (the last week of June), it was brought up on the same podcast that they did not know if the Carolina Legend was aware of this measuring tool or not. Would you mind confirming a) if Andy does know about this honor he was once bestowed, and b) what his thoughts are on the whole ordeal? PS: Can July 21st get here faster so I can ask better questions again?Nate, Charlotte\nI've been looking for Andy this week, but haven't seen him. So I'll ask him about the podcast thing next week.We have much to discuss.\nBut I will say, I think people vastly underestimate Andy Dalton's career.\nAndy Dalton is 26th on the all-time passing yards list (39,500), ahead of Hall of Famers Jim Kelly, Steve Young, YA Tittle, Troy Aikman, and many more.\nHe's also 26th on the all-time touchdown pass list (253), and the next one he throws ties him with Dan Freaking Fouts (254). He grew up in Texas idolizing Aikman, and has about 90 more touchdowns than the former Cowboys Hall of Famer (165).\nTo say it another way, only 25 people in the history of organized sports have done more of the things than Andy Dalton. And he's only played 14 seasons, so he's not just some compiler who hung around for a hundred years.\nAndy Dalton is pretty good at football, gang. He also has amazing hair,owns part of an English Premier League soccer team, is really good at tennis, and is blessed with self-awareness. I'm glad he made his way to Charlotte, where he's said he might stay when he's done playing.\nThe same people who call Charlotte boring make wisecracks about how good Andy Dalton is at football. There's an amazing grace in being really awesome at a lot of stuff in a normal and accessible way. If you're a city and you're better than Charlotte, you're a pretty groovy place to live, and if you're a quarterback and you're better than Andy Dalton, congratulations on an incredible career.\n------------------------------------------------------\nHello Darin! I am learning all about AI this summer through an internship, and I was wondering if the Panthers are going to be utilizing AI this season or have a team of staff members researching how they can use it to their best advantage this year. Playbook simplification and memorization could be enhanced through generative AI programs like ChatGPT. We use an AI tool at school as an academic tutor for biology subjects; I'm sure the Panthers could create one for football-related matters.\nFrom a non-football operations perspective, the franchise could create a Darin Gantt AI to answer all Panthers-related questions. The AI would be trained with your dry sense of humor, love of liver mush, and affinity for The Peachoid. It would be called GanttGPT!\nA sample question and reply scenario would be:\nQ: Who's the sleeper player to watch?\nA: Probably some guy nobody's talking about yetsomeone like Jimmy Horn, who's quietly waiting to surprise everyone. It's about as surprising as the Peachoid growing legs and walking off I-85 into the giant mall they have in Gaffney in the \"Great Fruit Free of 2025.\" Most people would never believe itexcept you, because you read this.AI Specialist Zach, Charlotte.\nThe only AI I recognize is Allen Iverson. And the next time AI writes a funny joke will be the first time. I suppose there's a way to use it for football, maybe I'll ask somebody when they get here next week. Also, thanks for killing my job security.\nThis email is all the proof you need that summer vacations for high school students are way too long. So, on behalf of Scott and Laura, and the rest of our audience, GET BACK TO CLASS, ZACH.\n------------------------------------------------------\nAnd on that note, let's go lightning round, brought to you by the patron saint of the lightning round Jeff from Fuquay-Varina, to close it out this week.\n\"Doesn't mean 'nothing'\"? Did you mean \"anything\"? Ditching proper grammar? Why? Very unprofessional.Robert, Winston-Salem, NC\nIt's called 'Having a voice,' Robert. It's conversational, and authentic, and local, and familiar to our readers. Good luck getting any of that from AI.\nNot so much a Panthers question, but a Charlotte-related curiosity for someone as well-\"seasoned\" and well-connected as yourself. Have you ever spent any time with your sur-namesake Harvey Gantt? And have you ever gotten any cool perks by pretending to be a relative? (hypothetically, of course).Alex, Charlotte\nWe've been at a few of the same events, but sadly, I haven't had the pleasure of meeting our former mayor. He has lived an amazing life, including integrating Clemson University. But I have had some conversations with his lovely daughter Sonja when she was a news anchor in town, and we made the jokes. As for cool perks, every time I want to impress out-of-town friends, I just drive by theGantt Centerdowntown and tell them that's where I keep my art collection.\nBad news - my FOTM shirt is indeed missing, most likely got lost in the move. I'll take the blame for that. However, we love NC and are happy to call this place home. What are this team's position groups of strength going into the season (not including the OL, which I think is the strongest)? And what about the biggest weakness going into the season, and can it be fixed or somewhat added to before Week 1? Thanks Darin!Jeff, Raleigh, NC\nWe're going to do a unit on personal responsibility soon. Never lose track of a perfectly good T-shirt. Especially one as treasured as the FOTM. We'll talk more about that later.\nAs for the team, the defensive line might not be where the offensive line is, but it's so much better than it was. They're still a little light at linebacker and in the secondary, but it's early, and if they realize they need to add there, there's time and ability to do so.\nAnd the best news is, next week we'll be able to find out for sure, and we can all stop guessing.\nAsk the Old Guy Submissions",
