  "body_text": "Aimee Medwin will give Western United a significant boost for the remainder of the A-League women season after rejoining the club.\nMedwin made an immediate impression in her nine appearances for Western United last season before her campaign was cruelly cut short by an ACL injury.\nThe 24-year-old has remained in connection with the club throughout her rehabilitation program and is now ready to step back into her number five jersey alongside her teammates.\nSpeaking ahead of her return to action after almost 12 months on the sidelines, Medwin said she is overjoyed to be officially back with the team and expressed her gratitude for the club’s support.\n“Obviously it’s been a long time in the making, and it’s been really good to finally come back into the team. I’m really excited to be back,” she said.\n“For me, it was really good to be in and around the group and still feel like I was part of the team. Obviously the support staff have been so amazing with me, helping me get back on the field. It’s been really nice to be around the group.\n“I feel really good. Coming back I feel faster, I feel stronger, so that’s really good for me and I just want to continue that until I get back on the field.”\nUnited’s general manager of football Mal Impiombato hailed Medwin’s return as an important one for the run-in towards the A-League finals.\n“We are delighted to reintroduce Aimee as a part of our playing squad and we are all looking forward to seeing her return to the pitch,” he said.\n“Playing an integral part of our inaugural season success, Aimee has shown incredible resilience through her rehabilitation with the support of our high-performance staff.\n“Aimee’s addition will be a significant one for our team heading into the latter part of the season and we look forward to having her help our push for finals football.”\nMedwin signed for Western United after round one last season and quickly became a regular fixture in the side.\nHer athleticism and quality on both left and right flanks made her a versatile and reliable option, one which Kat Smith will gleefully integrate into her squad for the rest of this season.\nShe was listed on the bench for United’s clash against Brisbane Roar on Sunday.",
