The Saudi Arabian Football Federation (SAFF) then confirmed it had agreed to terminate Renard’s contract at his request.\nRenard said after the loss: “I think I did the maximum with the team. I can’t reach another level so I prefer to be honest with everybody. Thank you again, it was fantastic time.”\nSAFF president Yasser al-Misehal told Saudi Sports Channel: “[Renard] has an offer from the French federation and expressed his desire to take this opportunity. We were informed four days before the current international window and I received a letter from the French federation, and consulted with a number of members of the board of directors, and we decided to accept this request.”\nRenard previously told FourFourTwo he doesn't have an eye on the Newcastle United job should Eddie Howe leave the club, and the Frenchman has confirmed that by instead taking up the vacant France women's managerial position.\nTasked with winning the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand this summer, Renard will hope to add to his list of trophies at international level. During his career, he won the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations with Zambia before leading Ivory Coast to the same trophy in 2015.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nFrance have been without a manager since sacking Corinne Diacre earlier this month, because of what the French Football Federation described as “a very significant divide” with the players that has “reached the point of no return”.\nIndeed, Wendie Renard, Kadidiatou Diani and Marie-Antoinette Katoto all refused to play at the World Cup under “the current system”.\nRenard will take charge of his first game as France manager France against Colombia on Friday 7 April, followed by a visit from Canada four days later.\nRyan is a staff writer for FourFourTwo, joining the team full-time in October 2022.
