Diane Bronze appeared on BBC Woman's Hour to reveal how the Northumberland defender acquired her fitting middle name of Tough.\nSpeaking from Switzerland, the proud mum discussed how many of Lucy's Lioness teammates and the extended family were aware of her broken tibia. Ms Bronze revealed: \"We knew all the way through.\n\"Initially somebody remarked, 'Well, it can't be a fracture, because you wouldn't be able to stand up'. But she said, 'I've got high pain threshold, and I can deal with pain'.\n\"Obviously, we knew the medics checked it, and they knew what they were doing.\n\"She did a sports science degree. She reads research papers and she knows about injuries.\n\"That's how she can keep going. That's why she knew how to tape her own leg.\"\nOur Northumberland Live newsletter is free.

She introduced herself: \"I'm Diane Tough Bronze.\n\"When you get married in Portugal, you just add your husband's name. You keep your own and add his, so all of my children are Tough Bronzes.\"\nHer mother confidently predicted that Lucy will continue her football career, stating: \"I think Sarina (Wiegman) had it right. She's going to have to get her off the pitch in a wheelchair.\"\nThe England team won a successive Euros championship after beating Spain in a penalty shootout in Basel on Sunday.",
