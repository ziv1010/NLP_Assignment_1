  "body_text": "Coach Ben Jeffries plans to use the Knights' one and only NRLW trial match in Cessnock on Sunday to gauge what shape his new-look squad is in three weeks out from their season-opener.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nThe Knights will field a full-strength side, including State of Origin champions Jesse Southwell, Yasmin Clydsdale and Olivia Higgins, against the Canberra Raiders at Cessnock Sportsground (12pm).\nSouthwell played a starring role for the Blues, who beat Queensland 2-1 in the three-match series in May.\n\"She's fitted straight back in,\" Jeffries said.\n\"We'll play a little bit differently this year, so I'm really happy with how she came back from Origin.\n\"She played with some real maturity and patience in that Origin space. I thought that was the best football I've ever seen her play.\"\nThe Knights are into their fifth week of a short pre-season and open their NRLW campaign against newcomers Canterbury Bulldogs in Sydney on July 4.\n\"The main focus is to get minutes into players that look like playing round one, first and foremost,\" Jeffries said.\n\"It's a chance for us to see what we've been working on, what we're good at and what we can improve on for round one.\"\nNewcastle have lost a wealth of experience from a squad which captured back-to-back premierships in 2022-2023 then scraped into the top four last year before bowing out in the semi-finals.\nThat includes fullback Tamika Upton (Brisbane), lock and captain Hannah Southwell (St George Illawarra) plus barnstorming forward Caitlan Johnston-Green (Cronulla), who all have State of Origin and Jillaroos experience.\nThe Knights also lost premiership-winning prop Rima Butler (Sydney Roosters), utility Nita Maynard (Dragons), second-rower Laishon Albert-Jones (New Zealand Warriors) and centre Abigail Roache (Queensland Cowboys).\nJeffries appears to have primarily put his faith in rising talent for 2025, to be complemented by the likes of Jillaroos duo Clydsdale (second row) and Higgins (hooker), Southwell, New Zealand outside back Shanice Parker, England five-eighth Georgia Roche and soccer star turned try-scoring machine Sheridan Gallagher.\nPremiership-winning forward Tiana Davison returns to the Knights from the Roosters and the club has signed former Wests Tigers fullback Botille Vette-Walsh on a multi-year contract.\nOther new faces include NSW under-19 representative lock Sienna Yeo, who was rookie of the year for NSW Women's Rugby League premiers Illawarra, New Zealander Keighley Simpson, an outside back who played Rugby Aupiki for Matatu, and lightning-quick back Tess Staines.\n\"We've had players move on for their respective reasons and we've brought in someone like Bo [Vette-Walsh], who will complement the group, and there's going to be players who get unearthed this year purely because they've come hungry to play NRLW,\" Jeffries said.\n\"We're not as big. We've lost some personnel that bring their stature, but we're fitter and faster.\"\nThe Knights' reserve-grade squad will play a NSW Premiership trial match at 1.45pm following the NRLW exchange.",
