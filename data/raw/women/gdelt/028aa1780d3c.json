I believe I need new challenges.\n“I have received a number of offers from Europe which are good, but the tricky part is the issue of tax on your earnings. Nevertheless, there is one from Spain [name withheld] which my manager is pursuing and we’ll see how it goes.\n“So, I should come up with a position after talking to my manager and I also need to consult [my sister] Tabitha.”\nApart from winning the league title, Temwa also helped Wuhan to win the Chinese Women’s FA Cup.\nShe also won the golden boot in both tournaments.\nTemwa was the league’s top scorer with 30 goals, 14 more than her runner-up and fellow African Barbara Banda from Zambia who plays for Changhai.\nShe also shone for the Scorchers in South Africa this year, helping them to win their first Cosafa Women’s Championship and emerged player of the tournament and top scorer with nine goals.\nIn an interview yesterday, National Women’s Football Association chairperson Adellaide Migogo said Temwa is now a world-class player “who can play for any team in the world”.\nShe said: “Whatever decision she makes will be crucial in shaping her future, but personally, I feel she deserves to play in any of Europe’s top leagues.”",
