Adamstown were very aggressive and deserved to lead, but I think as the game went on we showed what we're all about, and we showed some resilience to come back from being behind twice to run away with it in the end.\n\"It's definitely step-by-step. We're not getting ahead of ourselves after winning one game, but it gives you a little bit of confidence to portray a better value of your team when you've got a bit of confidence behind you.\n\"We just want to continue that team spirit and that community spirit which I think was huge last night, sort of got us over the line with the crowd.\"\nCaptain Dino Fajkovic twice put Adamstown in front, first in the 10th minute then again in the 65th.\nEthan Hall equalised for the hosts four minutes before half-time then Reece Newton produced a spectacular, long-range, left-footed half-volley to level at 2-2 in the 75th minute.\nThree minutes later, Belswans hit the lead when Adamstown conceded an own goal under attacking pressure. Kane Woolston, last year's Northern League One leading scorer, made it 4-2 in stoppage time before Newton iced the first-up win from the penalty spot.\n\"We were a bit rusty with patterns of passing, but I think [the performance] showed we were fit,\" Stafford said.\n\"We've got a certain style of play, and I think it was clear to see in the last 25 minutes what we can do.\n\"But we're not getting carried away. We'll move on to Edgeworth heaps quick. All of those top teams are another level above, so we've just got to stay humble and get back to our place and just work.\"\nA large and loud Belswans crowd were out in force on Thursday night for the opening match of the 2025 NPL season.\nIt was standing room only in the sheds post-match as the club's victory song rang out.\n\"A lot of old boys, old past players and captains were in there and all the young, local JDL players and everyone was pretty excited and enjoyed the song and had a bit of hope about the future,\" Stafford said.\n\"It's pretty historic to win our first game in NPL, but we just want to put that behind us now.\n\"It's just going to get tougher and tougher and tougher.\"\nDefending premiers and champions Broadmeadow were set to face off against Edgeworth in a grand final rematch at Jack McLaughlan Oval as the round continued on Friday night.\nThere is plenty of hype around Old Boys Day at Newcastle Olympic on Saturday (6.30pm), when Roy O'Donovan leads the line against Cooks Hill at Darling Street Oval.\nAlso on Saturday (4.30pm), Valentine travel to Maitland. On Sunday, Charlestown are at home to Westson at 4.30pm and Lambton play New Lambton at Arthur Edden Oval at 6.30pm.\nNPL Women kicks off on Saturday with the Golden Eagles hosting defending champions Charlestown at Alder Park (6pm). On Sunday, newcomers Lake Macquarie City face a tough first-up test in last year's premiers Maitland at Cooks Square Park (4pm) and Olympic are away to Magic at 6pm.",
