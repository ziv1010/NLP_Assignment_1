  "body_text": "Emma Hayes had made America great again. She has extended her remarkable coaching CV by guiding the United States to a history-making fifth Olympic title – their first since the London 2012 – to secure her status as one of the greatest managers in the women’s game.\nAt the full-time whistle, the 47-year-old kissed a necklace. As a packed Parc des Princes started to party, she was determined to snatch a personal moment. “It’s an American eagle,” Hayes later said of the pendant. “It’s my father’s and it’s so fitting that my dad gave me this American necklace. That was him. I wouldn’t be there without him. That was for my dad, I felt him with me the whole performance.”\nThis match was written in the stars for Hayes, who 12 years ago in London was in the crowd on the halfway line with her late father, Sid, watching the US edge out Japan to seal their fourth Olympic gold. It was Sid who had encouraged her to pursue her long held dream of taking over the reins of this women’s football superpower, but only when the time was right.\nIt is strange to think that just 84 days ago, she was celebrating on the Old Trafford pitch in front of Sir Alex Ferguson after guiding Chelsea to a fifth consecutive domestic title. With her £1.25 million contract, she has been unfazed by taking on the biggest job in women’s football and has been her usual charismatic self in press conferences in the French capital.\nIt was no different after her team had sealed Olympic glory through Mallory Swanson’s 57th-minute goal, which was enough to seal Hayes’ destiny and broke Brazilian hearts – including that of Marta. Brazil’s 38-year-old icon had returned from a two-match suspension for what is likely to be her final international appearance. A silver medallist from the 2004 and 2008 Olympics, she will have to be content with a third.",
