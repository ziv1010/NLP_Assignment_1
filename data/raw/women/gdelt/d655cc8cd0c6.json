  "body_text": "Abia Warriors storm Lagos, confident of victory\nAmbitious Abia Warriors became the first of the four finalists in the 2024 President Federation Cup grand finale to arrive in Lagos and Coach Bethel Orji does not doubt that his Umuahia giants will come good on Saturday at the Mobolaji Johnson Arena.\n“We are here and we’re highly motivated. We are all elated. I thank God for the turn around in the fortunes of the team, and I am delighted to be playing my first Cup final as a coach,” Orji told thenff.com in Lagos on Wednesday.\nA great player and former Cup winner himself, Bethel Orji will be banking on the precision of forwards Samson Obi and Sunday Megwo when Abia Warriors confront the two-time champions by the Lagos Waterfront on Saturday evening.\n“We are prepared for the game, physically, mentally and psychologically. The players are in high spirits; they are raring to go.”\nAbia Warriors reached the men’s final of the President Federation Cup four days after ensuring they will play in the Nigeria Premier Football League for the 12th consecutive season, come next season.\nEl-Kanemi gaffer eyes Fed Cup win\nTechnical Adviser Aliyu Zubairu has credited hard work for his team’s progress into the men’s final of this year’s President Federation Cup, and believes the same virtue will see the Maiduguri landlords pick up their third Nigeria Cup title in Lagos on Saturday.\n“Hard work has been our mainstay. Everyone works for the other, including the players on the pitch. It was a tough league season, and our real objective at the beginning of the season was to gain promotion back to the NPFL. However, after the Round of 16, we suddenly realised that with more hard work, we could go all the way to the final.\n“I commend the players for not only ensuring promotion back to the topflight, but also reaching the President Federation Cup final. Yet, it is not over until it is over. We are here and we are determined to wrest the title. We have had some days to rest and we are going to work hard to deliver the trophy to our number one supporter, Governor Babagana Umaru Zulum.”\nFounded in the late mid-1980s by the football-passionate then military governor of Borno State, Col. Abdulmumini Aminu, who would later serve as Chairman of then Nigeria Football Association between 1996 and 1999, El-Kanemi Warriors won their first Nigeria Cup in 1991, when they defeated Kano Pillars 3-2 in the first-ever all-northern final at the National Stadium, Lagos.\nThe following year, the Warriors successfully defended their title edging Stationery Stores 1-0 at the Aper Aku Stadium in Makurdi.\nIn their third final in 2001, they lost 1-0 to Dolphins of Port Harcourt at the National Stadium, Lagos.\nOgbonda insists experienced Angels have the edge\nWhyte Ogbonda is not your ordinary sweat merchant. Even among his colleagues, it is widely acknowledged that the former tactician of Ibom Angels FC of Uyo knows his onions, and more.\nOn Saturday, Ogbonda will be gunning for his first National Cup title as head coach, having guided unfancied Ibom Angels to runners-up position in 2017 and 2018. On both occasions, they lost to Rivers Angels. The strategist has tasted victory previously, albeit as assistant coach, when Rivers Angels won the trophy in 2014.\n“Yes, Rivers Angels have always reached the women’s final of the Cup, and here we are again. Our target is to lift the trophy and bring it back to Rivers State, having lost the opportunity to win the league. As a team, we are indebted to Rivers State government to bring back the trophy. That is the only way we can show appreciation for the government’s huge investment in the team.”\nOgbonda insists that his girls, who include in their ranks Nigeria U20 girls’ forward Blessing Okpe and Flamingos’ forward Peace Effiong, will not underrate Naija Ratels, but will go all out to accomplish victory.\nThe women’s final will kick off at 1pm on Saturday at the Mobolaji Johnson Arena, with the men’s final to commence at 4pm.\nOlowookere: Nothing can stop Ratels from Cup win\nU-17 World Cup bronze medal-winning coach, Bankole Olowookere, is entertaining no fear ahead of Saturday’s women’s final of the President Federation Cup against eight-time champions Rivers Angels in Lagos.\n“We thank God for taking us this far in the competition. During the league’s regular season, we did not quite meet up with our own expectations. However, our target at the beginning of the season also included doing well in the Cup, and now we are in the final.\n“For sure, we are the distinct underdogs against Rivers Angels that have won this trophy eight times before now. But no team is unbeatable. We have a plan and a strategy to emerge champions on Saturday. We want to do this for our proprietor and for our supporters who have been with us through victory and defeat, through thick and thin. I can assure you that Naija Ratels are determined to make history.”\nOlowookere led the Nigeria U-17 girls, Flamingos, to win the bronze medals for the first time at the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup in India two years ago. He has also now qualified the team for this year’s finals to be staged in the Dominican Republic.\nNaija Ratels is the first club from Abuja in 24 years to reach the women’s final of the Cup. In 2000, FCT Queens lost to the same Rivers Angels in the final.",
