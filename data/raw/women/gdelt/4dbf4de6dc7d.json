  "body_text": "Shakira has had a lot to say in the two years since her very public breakup with Gerard Pique.\nNot only has 47-year-old pop star given countless interviews about the traumatising split, allegedly due to his cheating, she devoted an entire album to her pain called Women Don’t Cry Anymore.\nFor a while there, the Miami based singer, who shares two sons with the baller, basically made the split her whole personality.\nAnd now, with the Colombiana’s bachelorette anthem Soltera rising up the charts and a hot, new stadium tour on the way, Pique is piping up.\nThe retired football star, who is still dating Clara Chía Marti, the 25-year-old assistant he left Shakira for, wants the world to know things are not as they seem.\nAlrighty then.\nIn a wide-ranging interview in Spanish with CNN en Espanol discussing his new team, Barcelona’s Kings League, Pique briefly addressed his personal life in the last three minutes.\n“I’m very chill about it all,” said the 37-year-old Spaniard, without mentioning Shakira by name. “I know people like to have their points of view on things.... but in the end, the truth (wasn’t told) the way it happened. This, I cannot control.”\nPique added that he was proud of his long athletic career, his family, kids and friendships, and that’s what sustains him and brings him “peace.”\n“The best thing for me is to stay surrounded by those who really know you and know how you are and what you do,” he concluded. “I am very happy, I am having a great time, and I feel very privileged. You have to enjoy life.” – Miami Herald/Tribune News Service",
