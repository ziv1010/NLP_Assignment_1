  "body_text": "Gunners ace Russo fires England to final\nArsenal striker puts Lionesses on brink of being world champions\nThursday, 17th August 2023 — By Catherine Etoe in Sydney\nAlessia Russo scores England’s third goal to seal the victory against Australia [Richard Callis/SPP]\nARSENAL’S new hotshot striker Alessia Russo won praise yesterday (Wednesday) after the forward scored the goal that sealed a first-ever Women’s World Cup final berth for the Lionesses.\nPlaying in front of a raucous crowd of almost 76,000 in Sydney, Sarina Wiegman’s side set up an historic date with Spain in Sunday’s showpiece after a 3-1 win over Australia.\nAnd in the wake of their momentous semi-final victory over the co-hosts, England’s midfield maestro Keira Walsh hailed Russo’s cool-as-you-like finish in the 86th minute as “unbelievable”.\n“We all know what Alessia can do,” Walsh told the New Journal. “And it was a massive, massive finish for us and that was probably the moment when I thought, ‘We’re going to be in a World Cup final!”\nFor a while in the match it looked as though Australia would bounce back from Ella Toone’s superb first-half opener.\nNational heroine and Chelsea forward Sam Kerr offered hope with a tremendous equaliser just after the hour that was met by a wall of noise from a home crowd decked out in green and gold. But Lauren Hemp reasserted England’s lead after a route-one pass out of defence from captain Millie Bright before Russo crushed Australia’s hopes of a comeback late on.\nOf course, England’s joy was Australia’s pain and when Gunner Steph Catley met the waiting press pack at Stadium Australia after the tie, her sadness was plain to see. The defender, who has shone in this home World Cup alongside fellow Arsenal star Caitlin Foord, described the emotion as “heartbreak and disappointment”.\nBut she was able to appreciate the impact that the Matildas have had on their home nation during a campaign that has seen them go further on the world stage than ever before, with their faces adorning buses, trams, billboards and even bins.\n“We wanted to leave a legacy and do something amazing and wake up the public to what we’re doing in women’s football, and I think we’ve done that,” Catley said.\n“The support that we’ve had has gone to another level. It’s been incredible.”\nNext up for Australia is Saturday’s match for third place against Sweden – a game that will pit Catley and Foord against fellow Gunners Lina Hurtig, Stina Blackstenius and Amanda Ilestedt.\n“It’s about processing that heartbreak and trying to bounce back and get ready for the next game,” Catley added.\nMeanwhile, the European champions continue to build a legacy of their own by reaching a second major tournament final on the bounce. Even more remarkable is the fact that Wiegman is now set for her fourth major final in succession, having previously steered the Netherlands to that stage in the 2017 Euros and 2019 World Cup.\n“She’s confident and never really looks under pressure,” Walsh said of the manager. “And you can feel that when you’re playing.”\nFans can watch England’s final on Sunday live on BBC 1 from 10am.",
