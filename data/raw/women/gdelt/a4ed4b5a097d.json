  "body_text": "Disgraced former U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins has waded into the White Stadium debate, by urging opponents of Boston’s public-private rehab plan to keep up the pressure on the mayor and city officials who support the project.\nRollins’ remarks were responsive to an email chain that includes residents who oppose the city’s professional soccer stadium rehab plan, elected officials and journalists. The chain began with criticism over what some residents see as the City Council president invoking a procedural rule to shut down debate over the potential for shifting to an alternative community-led and fully-public proposal.\nThe ex-U.S. attorney and Suffolk district attorney advised project opponents late last month to take advantage of this “finite opportunity” in the election cycle, by capitalizing on the vulnerability of city politicians seeking reelection.\n“Politicians are usually only vulnerable when they are up for reelection,” Rollins wrote. “Many start listening more and being present more in communities. Currently our district is the only one out of the nine that does not have a designated city councilor. We are at a significant disadvantage. So our community needs to step up.”\nShe was referencing the vacancy in the City Council’s Roxbury-centric District 7 seat, which was previously held by Tania Fernandes Anderson who resigned in disgrace in early July after her conviction on two public corruption charges. Fernandes Anderson was sentenced to a month in prison in federal court on Friday.\nRollins also resigned in disgrace, in May 2023, after she was scorched in two federal reports that found she abused her position as the state’s top prosecutor, for, in part, trying to influence the outcome of the Suffolk district attorney’s preliminary election in favor of ex-City Councilor Ricardo Arroyo. Rollins was found to have leaked false information to the media about DA Kevin Hayden, among other offenses.\nShe landed on her feet and now works part-time at Roxbury Community College, where she was hired early last year. She is paid $109,852 as a special projects administrator focused on developing a program for formerly incarcerated people, according to the state comptroller’s office.\nAfter moderating a high-profile panel discussion hosted by Boston mayoral candidate Josh Kraft late last month, Rollins is now wading into the White Stadium debate, by advising critics of the public-private rehab plan championed by Kraft’s opponent, Mayor Michelle Wu.\n“I am happy that New Edition is getting a street named after them in Roxbury this weekend,” Rollins wrote, “but I want the City of Boston to care just as much that Roxbury: lost two Walgreens and is now a pharmacy (desert) for residents without vehicles; bears the brunt of the opioid crisis for our region as Mass and Cass is in Roxbury; has the highest number of abandoned properties and vacant lots in Boston; is a food (desert); and has the lowest life expectancy rate of any neighborhood in Boston according to the Boston Public Health Commission.”\nRollins advised White Stadium opponents that “everyone is watching now as the primary and general elections approach.”\n“You can demand answers and accountability from a politician and still vote for them,” she wrote. “This isn’t about anti or pro any candidate. It is about fairness, access and opportunity.”\nOpponents of the city’s public-private rehab are pushing for an alternative, fully-public rehab of White Stadium for Boston Public School student-athletes, who would share use of the stadium with a new National Women’s Soccer League team, beginning in spring 2027.\nThe Emerald Necklace Conservancy and community members unveiled an updated alternative rehab plan for the stadium that they say can be rebuilt for just $64.6 million, compared to the city’s roughly $200 million plan. Under today’s plan, taxpayers would be on the hook for the city’s half, at $91 million and counting.\nRollins closed her email by taking a swipe at the Wu administration’s focus on potential traffic and parking impacts that may tax Boston’s Charlestown neighborhood, as a result of the Kraft Group’s planned Everett soccer stadium, while turning a blind eye to those same concerns related to White Stadium.\n“And don’t even get me started on the hypocrisy of Boston demanding a seat at the table for the Encore casino in Everett and now again with the potential New England Revolution stadium in Everett due to the crippling traffic impacts to Charlestown making Boston a host community resulting in a surrounding community agreement,” Rollins said, “while ignoring that exact same argument from the host communities of Roxbury, Dorchester and Jamaica Plain about White Stadium.\n“But,” she said, “I digress.”",
