Stetz, Mae and Robert Carter Professor of Women's Studies and professor of humanities, was an invited online participant in a hybrid scholarly seminar held at Goldsmiths, University of London, on Nov. 27, 2025. Titled \"Future Fields,\" this event, which was organized by the Decadence Research Centre at Goldsmiths, was occasioned by the recent publication of the volume Michael Field in Context (Cambridge University Press), to which Stetz was a contributor. The purpose of the seminar was to suggest further directions for the study of the lives and works of the two Victorian women writers, Katharine Bradley and Edith Cooper, who used the joint pseudonym of \"Michael Field.\" On Dec. 6, 2025, Stetz was the introducer and moderator for the one-day-long \"Jane Austen Now\" symposium held at Morris Library in commemoration of the 250th anniversary of Austen's birth. On Dec. 7, 2025, she was also an invited participant in an online scholarly workshop organized by the Delaware Valley British Studies working group. The topic of discussion was the circulation of late-19th and early 20th century trade cards and postcards with racist imperial imagery of domestic caretakers.\nYou Jin Choi, art history Ph.D. candidate, gave a talk at the Textile Museum Journal Symposium on Dec. 6, 2025.

The Textile Museum Journal is published each fall and focuses on new research illuminating aspects of the museum’s collection. It is the leading publication for the exchange of textile scholarship in North America.\nDaniel Harris, assistant professor of epidemiology, spoke at the Gerontological Society of America’s (GSA) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting in Boston in November.
