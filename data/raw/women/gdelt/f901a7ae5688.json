Who is advising the university if and when these horrific issues arise? They need to be the first ones fired!\"\nRachael Denhollander, an attorney and advocate and the first woman to publicly accuse former MSU doctor Larry Nassar of sexual abuse, posted that \"Coming on the heels of a lawsuit alleging that a PT has been sexually assaulting patients, and the Board's refusal to release the Nassar documents, this is beyond disgusting. I stand with @brendatracy24.\"\nAngie Povilaitis, the former Michigan assistant attorney general who prosecuted Nassar in Ingham and Eaton counties, applauded Tracy as \"...one of the fiercest survivors I know. We were grateful when she came to MSU to share her experience & set the expectation. She has done more to educate young men & programs than anyone. We teach investigators to focus on an offenders choices, statements & inconsistencies. I’d encourage everyone to do the same here. The power dynamic is not equal. That can’t be ignored either. Ultimately I am sad and disgusted. After years of sexual assault scandals, after tireless work by so many trying to bring MSU forward to do better, this happens & is where we are.\"\n@bldizik posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the news was \"Unbelievable. Disgraceful. Disgusting.\n\"I cannot put in to words how angry and betrayed I feel this morning. Once I settled down, I went to Michigan State University's website to ask a few questions, five years after Nassar rocked the University, whether ... MSU had a university-wide Code of Conduct/Ethics. Answer: No. MSU had a standalone Protection from Retaliation Policy. Answer: No. MSU had a Supervisor (Intimate) Relationship Policy. Answer: No. MSU had an Independent university-wide Ethics and Compliance Office. Answer: No. The problem is clearly BOTH cultural and structural. And the efforts to address the problems at Michigan State University have not worked because they are not consistent with best practices or DOJ guidance on effective compliance programs.\"\nX user Mitch Steur, who posts as @Spartan_dawg12 on X, wrote: \"I’m torn between getting rid of the rest of my season tickets because I’m tired of continually supporting this shit show and wanting to support the student athletes who had 0 to do with this.\"\nUser @Apocalypse031 posted on X that \"I wouldn't blame them if a bulk of the young guys ask for the transfer portal within the next week.\"\nSpartan alum @richardson2210 was more blunt: \"Women deserve better. MSU’s football program deserves better. Michigan State University deserves better.\"\nMSU fan Mike Payton, posting as @AtoZ_Payton, said, \"I’m embarrassed to be an MSU fan right now. This school continues to be a disappointment in its treatment towards women and it’s handling of sexual assault, harassment ETC. This should be so simple. There should be no tolerance whatsoever. I’m gone if Tucker isn’t fired.\"\nIngham County Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, who sentenced Nassar in 2018 to 40 to 175 years in prison and told the now former doctor, \"I just signed your death warrant,\" reacted to a column today by State Journal sports columnist Graham Couch.\n\"History of sexual misconduct will continue to repeat itself until there is meaningful change with mandated continuing education and absolute accountability. We can’t tolerate any more abuse. No More Victims! Say YES to Change! @SpotSpiders @CSSJustice @SafeSports1989 @MeTooMVMT,\" the judge wrote on her X handle @AquiRosemarie. The judge who has been outspoken about sexual abuse said in 2021 she was open to being considered for the MSU presidency after former President Samuel Stanley Jr. was dismissed by trustees.\nSen. Sam Singh, D-East Lansing, wrote on X that \"It is difficult being an Alum of this University. The outside investigative report was submitted in July. They couldn’t have had the hearing prior to October? Why was he allowed to coach these last two weeks? Too many questions for the Administration and the Board. #mileg\n@CVBagel, the user account for Cedar Village Bagel: \"Mel Tucker’s defense, even if accurate, portrays him as someone who would cheat on his wife with the sexual assault victim advocate. Insanity. Our school is devoid of leaders. Or, really, just people with good judgement.\"\nMSU alum Andrew Cumbow, posting at user @ACumbow, wrote \"Fell asleep early tonight and just woke up to the Tucker news. Man…not sure what to even say. Sad.\"\nHe later added: \"Mel is 100% done. Even if he is innocent of sexual harassment, he’s unfit to lead young men. How can you try and be a role model and leader for 18-22 year olds and tell them to make good decisions while you’re out doing stuff like this?\"\n@ReclaimMSU, the X handle for the group Reclaim MSU, an alliance of students, faculty, staff, and alumni demanding a culture of transparency and accountability at MSU, posted: \"Deep respect and gratitude for Brenda Tracy, today and always.\"\nKennedy Broadwell, a sports reporter for @9and10News, wrote: \"To all of the women and sexual assault survivors that are fans, students, faculty at MSU, I am so sorry that you, again, have to feel like they don’t take these matters seriously. My heart breaks for all of you.\"",
