But for some teams and players, they're likely asking for a do-over.\nHere are Week 1's five worst performances:\nIt would be unfair to single out one aspect of the Dolphins' humiliating 33-8 road loss to the Indianapolis Colts, so we're highlighting the entire team.\nThe offense had three turnovers and a punt on its first four possessions, with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa throwing two interceptions. The defense allowed the Colts, led by journeyman quarterback Daniel Jones, to score on all four of the first-half possessions, something the team hadn't accomplished since 2006, when Hall of Famer Peyton Manning started at quarterback.\nMiami suffered the worst loss of Week 1 (so far) and was outgained 418-211. Based on how poorly it played, it might not be long until the front office holds a fire sale.\nGeez, talk about a bad return on investment. Stephens, who signed a three-year, $36M contract with the Jets in free agency, left an awful first impression with a nightmare performance against the Pittsburgh Steelers in a 34-32 loss.\nAs ESPN NFL analyst Mina Kimes noted on Bluesky, at one point in the game, Stephens had allowed a completion on all four of his targets for 74 yards and a touchdown.\nBrandon Stephens has given up 4 catches on 4 targets for 74 yds and a TD as the nearest defender\n— Mina Kimes (@minakimes.bsky.social) 2025-09-07T19:26:20.731Z\nHe got burned in the slot against wideout Calvin Austin, a 2022 fourth-round pick, failing to break up a back-shoulder throw from quarterback Aaron Rodgers that gave Pittsburgh a 1st-and-goal from New York's 3-yard line. The Steelers scored a touchdown two plays later.\nAaron Rodgers back shoulder throw to Calvin Austin\n— NFL (@NFL) September 7, 2025\nPITvsNYJ on CBS/Paramount+https://t.co/HkKw7uXVnt pic.twitter.com/z7EE8u5B1m\nStephens displayed worse effort in the fourth quarter, biting on Rodgers' play-action fake and allowing Austin to blaze him past him, eventually hauling in an 18-yard touchdown catch to give the Steelers a 31-26 lead.\nAaron Rodgers throws his 4th TD to give Pittsburgh the lead!\n— NFL (@NFL) September 7, 2025\nPITvsNYJ on CBS/Paramount+https://t.co/HkKw7uXVnt pic.twitter.com/3bU0DRNvjN\nStephens was oft-picked on with the Baltimore Ravens, with whom he spent his first four seasons after being selected in the third round (No. 104 overall) of the 2021 NFL Draft. Per Stathead, from 2023-24, Stephens was targeted 210 times, the second-most during that span, and allowed a league-high 1,150 completed air yards.\nThe Jets should have read the fine print.\nKoo's miss at the end of regulation in Atlanta's 23-20 loss to the division rival Tampa Bay Buccaneers, while snapping a streak of seven consecutive makes with a chance to tie or take the lead, continued a troubling trend that began last season.\nOnce among the league's most reliable kickers, Koo has become a liability. After making just 73.5% of his attempts last season, his lowest in six seasons with at least 20 attempts, Koo's wide-right miss put the Falcons in an early hole in the NFC South.\nSzmyt was somehow worse. While Koo's miss kept the Falcons from sending their game to overtime, Szmyt had a chance to give the Browns a lead on his 36-yarder, which he also missed wide right. The former undrafted free agent also missed an extra point, which allowed the Cincinnati Bengals to take the lead on an Evan McPherson field goal that they wouldn't relinquish.\nAndre Szmyt misses the 36-yard FG\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) September 7, 2025\n: FOX pic.twitter.com/TuHLDdWz7b\nExpect the calls for rookie Jaxson Dart to start to grow after Wilson's unexceptional Giants debut. The veteran was Sunday's most inaccurate starting quarterback, ending a 21-6 loss to the Washington Commanders 17-of-37 (45.9%) for 168 yards. It was his sixth-lowest completion percentage of his career and lowest since his disastrous 2022 season with the Denver Broncos.\nInstead of bringing stability to the position, the Super Bowl XLVIII-winning quarterback was maddeningly inconsistent against the Commanders. With a performance like that, head coach Brian Daboll might be forced to reconsider his stance on New York's starting quarterback.\nDetroit's offensive line had the impossible task of facing edge-rusher Micah Parsons in his Green Bay Packers debut, and the unit was not up for the challenge.\nQuarterback Jared Goff was sacked four times, and running backs Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery combined for 44 yards on 20 carries (2.2 yards per attempt). For a team with Super Bowl aspirations, Detroit's offensive line must quickly put a rough Week 1 behind it. If it snowballs, the Lions' championship window might have already closed.\nMore must-reads:\n- Dolphins WR Tyreek Hill's latest incident could fuel trade rumors\n- Packers' Micah Parsons sends warning to Lions RT after Week 1 game\n- The 'Super Bowl winning coaches' quiz\n+\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
