All of our hotels were booked out, people were eating out at our restaurants, they were buying from local shops, so it provides a huge economic injection into the local community,\" Mr Toole said.\n\"There's plenty more events just around the corner with the 12-Hour event and the 500, which help to bring people to the area, support our businesses and drive our local economy.\"\nA night to remember for Wanderers\nWith an average crowd number of around 1000 at a Wanderers stand-alone fixture, looking up at 3873 cheering faces really cemented the want to return to Bathurst for the team's chief executive officer (CEO) Scott Hudson.\nBetween the work Bathurst Regional Council put in to making the event a reality, and the response from the wider community, Mr Hudson said he would love to make the fixture an annual staple on the calendar.\nAnd he is very grateful for the support the Wanderers received, both at events leading up to the game and on the night itself.\n\"It was so good, we loved every minute of it, it was a great buzz,\" he said.\n\"For me, the biggest joy was at the end when we won the game and you see all the young kids on the sideline and all the players handing out posters and doing signatures and photos. That's what it's really all about.\n\"Talking to council, 2000 or 3000 was a good result, so to exceed that and get close to 4000 was amazing and shows the potential for something that we're eager to grow and see how big we can make it.\"",
