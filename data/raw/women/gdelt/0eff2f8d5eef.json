  "body_text": "The Culture Bites team is back, kicking off with a preview of anticipated arts and culture events lined up for 2025.\nEnas Refaei, Farah Andrews and Maan Jalal share some of the most exciting concerts, art fairs and book releases that they’re adding to their calendars this year. From Sting on stage and Sharjah Biennial 16 to Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's new book, this cultural season sets off with a promising start across the region and beyond.\nWith season three of Dubai Bling now streaming, the hosts dissect the show’s anatomy and discuss the evolution of reality TV as an entertainment genre. As it gains popularity in the Arab world, they debate the merits of shows that blur the lines between real life and staged drama.\nMaan visits Jameel Arts Centre where the exhibition Three Tired Tigers is showcasing works that envision cities and landscapes from the perspective of animals and the geographies that humans share with them. He speaks with the curator about the themes that artists explored in their pieces, including the inspiration for the exhibition itself: Dubai’s street cats.",
