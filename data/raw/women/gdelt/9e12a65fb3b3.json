And now 10 stars are gearing up for a stint in the Australian jungle, with the show starting in just a matter of days.\nLike every year, rumours have been rife for a while now on just who will be joining Ant and Dec Down Under this year and, while some of the famous faces linked with the new series, like Connor Benn, Jools Oliver and Gary Lineker are nowhere to be seen, the rumour mill proved to be 100% correct on a number of the line-up's identities.\nThe full list of celebs doing I'm A Celebrity this year was released by ITV at 7pm on Monday and this year's line-up has a number of soap icons on it, one of whom is also an 80s music legend. Other names on the list include everyone from rapper Aitch to much loved comic and writer Ruby Wax and ex England footballer turned BBC presenter Alex Scott to the early favourite to win, YouTuber Angryginge.\nThe 10 stars going into the jungle this time round, to follow in the footsteps of recent winners like Jill Scott, Sam Thompson and Danny Jones, have also been seen for the first time in their instantly recognisable I'm A Celebrity uniform. Here is a full rundown of the starts taking part:\nI'm A Celebrity 2025 confirmed line-up\nShona McGarty\nKnown to millions of EastEnders fans for playing Whitney in the BBC soap, Shona bowed out of her role last year and made the switch from screen to stage to make her West End debut in the Bettie Page Queen of the Pin-ups musical in the summer.\nShe has just released a single Unapologetically Me and, having been linked with I'm A Celebrity last year and rumoured for Strictly, she's now been confirmed for the jungle.\nEddie Kadi\nSpeaking of Strictly, a former contestant on the BBC dancing show, is joining Shona on I'm A Celebrity. The comedian and presenter was spotted flying out to Australia on Tuesday, having already had a busy year with jobs including being one of the hosts of the 2025 MOBO Awards in Newcastle.\nOn Eddie doing I'm A Celebrity,a source said: “Eddie is hilarious and will provide some much needed comic relief to campmates in the jungle. He’s very quick-witted and the show will hopefully help land him lots of new fans.”\nLisa Riley\nEmmerdale cast members have traditionally done rather well on I'm A Celebrity, with Lisa's co-star Danny Miller winning in 2021. There had been rumours that Lisa had turned down an offer to do I'm A Celeb but that proved to wide of the mark as she's definitely going into the jungle!\nOn landing in Oz, Lisa told journalists: \"I'm from the north, we are made of tough skin.\" She added: \"I am a Dingle I can cope with anything. We did Dingles Down Under many years and I feel it's only right we do it again.\"\nAngryginge\nHe made quite an impression on viewers when he played for England in Soccer Aid this year and now the content creator is the one to beat in the eyes of bookies. Rumours have swirled that him doing I'm A Celebrity has sparked a bit of an 'influencer' war, with rivals wondering why they weren't asked.\nJack Osbourne\nJust months after his rock legend dad Ozzy passed away, Jack, who has previously shown his strength and resilience on American show Special Forces, the US Version of Celebrity SAS, is doing I'm A Celebrity. Producers are said to be thrilled that the 39-year-old dad of four has signed on the dotted line.\nAn insider commented: \"He is believed to be going into the jungle with the full support of his mother and his sister Kelly. Jack is very likely to discuss Ozzy, which will be an incredibly moving moment for the campmates and for viewers and Ozzy’s fans.\"\nAlex Scott\nLike Eddie Kadi, Alex has also been on Strictly in the past, but is being known for being a former England Lionesses footballer turned successful TV presenter. Alex has fronted shows like The One Show, Children in Need, Soccer Aid and Football Focus.\nBacking her to do rather well in the jungle, a source remarked: \"The public know her as a sportswoman and a serious broadcaster so she thinks she can show people a side to her that they’ve never seen before. Alex is game for anything and is a tough cookie so she’s ready for anything that gets thrown at her — literally.”\nMartin Kemp\nHis son Roman was a huge fan favourite on I'm A Celeb, making it all the way to the final and finishing in third in 2019. And now Martin, famous for being in Spandau Ballet, the 80s act who gave the world hits like True and Gold and for playing Steve Owen in EastEnders, is following in his footsteps.\nMartin was of one the first stars to be viewed as 'dead cert' to do the jungle this year and, until he was overtaken by Angryginge, was the early favourite to win.\nRuby Wax\nThe oldest of this year's campmates, Ruby signing up is a huge coup for I'm A Celebrity bosses. The 72-year-old comedy legend is reported to be bringing 'real gravitas' to this year's line-up, with a source addIng: ''She's interviewed some of the biggest stars in the world so will have no problem getting to know her fellow campmates.'\nSadly for Ruby, she has been made a 40/1 outsider to win the new series, with experts lining her up to make an early exit.\nAitch\nThe 25-year-old northern rapper isn't someone viewers would necessarily expect to see on I'm A Celeb. Sources claim that, by signing him, ITV bosses are hopeful they'll bring in a younger audience.\nAn insider commented: \"Aitch has a massive following among teenagers and 20-somethings and bosses will be hoping he’ll bring a new generation of fans.\"\nKelly Brook\nHaving been linked to the show in the past, 2025 is the year that Kelly is finally doing I'm A Celebrity. The former Big Breakfast and Celebrity Love Island presenter, who is now a regular on Loose Women, is due to land in Australia today.\nOn her going into the jungle, an insider said: \"She’s glamorous, witty and a familiar face to ITV audiences, having appeared as a panellist for Loose Women and other shows. She’s guaranteed to make perfect TV viewing.”\nWe have a dedicated newsletter for What’s On news and reviews. It’s free and you can sign up to receive it here.
