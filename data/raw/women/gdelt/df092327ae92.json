  "body_text": "We're potentially set to receive a shake-up to the TOTS release schedule for the first time in Ultimate Team, with the TOTS promo leaked to kick-off with EA FC 24 TOTS Live.\nSince TOTS was first introduced, EA Sports has got the promo underway with the release of the Community TOTS, which since FIFA 22 has featured the best players from world football who received a maximum of one performance-based special item in Ultimate Team. But, recent TOTS leaks have revealed that a new TOTS squad could be dropping in EA FC 24 Ultimate Team first this year, EA FC 24 TOTS Live.\nEA FC 24 TOTS is set to be bigger than any TOTS promo we've ever seen, with more squads to be released than the previous record set in FIFA 23. EA Sports has released more live promos in EA FC 24 Ultimate Team than ever before, and this is set to continue with the EA FC 24 TOTS Live promo.\nEA FC 24 TOTS Live will feature players who have impressed during the 2023/24 season, but rather than giving them a regular TOTS item, they are set to be released with a slightly lower rating that can be upgraded based on real-life performances in the games following the promo's release. Some other live promos we've seen in EA FC 24 have been Fantasy FC and RTTF, both big hits in the UT Community.\nThis is everything we know about the upcoming EA FC 24 TOTS Live promo, including the latest leaks, how upgrades will work, and the expected release date.\nEA FC 24 TOTS Live: release date\nThe EA FC 24 TOTS Warmup Series is set to conclude tomorrow, meaning we expect the EA FC 24 TOTS Live promo release date will be tomorrow, Friday, April 19 at 6pm / 1pm EDT / 10am PDT. Usually, the Community TOTS squad would be the first TOTS squad released, but based on leaks and the fact Community TOTS voting hasn't started yet, we expect the TOTS Live promo to take its place as the first squad of the promo.\nLike every TOTS squad, we expect the TOTS Live promo to last a week in Ultimate Team before it's replaced by the Bundesliga TOTS and Frauen-Bundesliga TOTS on Friday, April 26.\nEA FC 24 TOTS Live: leaks\nThe first leak regarding the TOTS Live promo came last week when @FutScoreboard revealed some new card designs coming during the TOTS promo, including the TOTS Live card design. Now, a variety of reliable leakers have revealed players set to feature as part of the TOTS Live promo, with @FutSheriff compiling a list of every leaked player.\nHere's every EA FC 24 TOTS Live player leak we know so far. Some of these will be released as SBCs or Objectives, but we just aren't sure which.\n- CAM: Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United)\n- CM: Luka Modric (Real Madrid)\n- CAM: Dominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool)\n- LW: Jeremy Doku (Manchester City)\n- CF: Ramirez (Chelsea Women)\n- RWB: Jonathan Clauss (Marseille)\n- RW: Raphinha (Barcelona)\n- CM: Ruben Loftus-Cheek (Milan)\n- CM: Mikel Merino (Real Sociedad)\n- CB: Piero Hincapie (Bayer Leverkusen)\n- CB: Nicolas Otamendi (Benfica)\n- CB: Cristian Romero (Tottenham)\n- LW: Wilfred Zaha (Galatasaray)\n- LM: Allan Saint-Maximin (Al Ahli)\n- RW: Mohamed Kudus (West Ham United)\n- CAM: Gabri Viega (Al Ahli)\n- CM: John McGinn (Aston Villa)\n- CB: Yann Aurel Bisseck (Inter)\n- RB: Lucas Vazquez (Real Madrid)\n- LB: Mattheiu Udol (Metz)\n- ST: Maximillian Beier (Hoffenheim)\n- LB: Antonee Robinson (Fulham)\n- CDM: Ben Sheaf (Coventry City)\n- LW: David Costa (Lens)\n- ST: Rafa Mujica (Arouca)\n- LW: Morgan Weaver (Portland Thorns)\n- CAM: Leicy Santos (Atletico Madrid Women)\n- ST: Adriana Leon (Aston Villa Women)\n- CB: Laia Aleixandri (Manchester City Women)\n- ST: Elisabeth Terland (Brighton Women)\n- CM: Mara Alber (Hoffenheim Women)\nEA FC 24 TOTS Live: how the upgrade path will work\nLeaker @Fut_Scoreboard has also revealed the upgrade path for TOTS live player items, with each player able to earn two upgrades in the four domestic league games following release. These are the upgrade paths for the TOTS Live promo.\n- +1 TOTW upgrade: Win two of the next four domestic league games\n+1 TOTW upgrade: Player's club scores eight goals in the next four domestic league games\nAs with every promo in EA FC 24, expect to see more TOTS Live players released as SBCs and Objectives, while some may also be released as part of a mini-release at a later date. TOTS Live items could also give us an indication of what to expect during the rest of the TOTS promo, with players expecting the introduction of three PlayStyle Plus'.",
