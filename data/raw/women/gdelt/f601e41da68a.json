Minimum publicity for the A-League grand final, a week after it should have been played, and in the middle of State of Origin analysis and panic in every paper.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nAnd that's not even the worst decision, or lack of insight, from the governing body heading into the match. Can I emphasise that the playing surface, and its evenness, is of paramount importance to the quality of our product (I know it's an annual rant).\nThe women's State of Origin takes place two days before the A-League grand final in dewy, soft and slippery conditions. Let's hope the ground staff are miracle workers.\nI'm not having a crack at the women. The All Blacks, or Parramatta at home, would have been much worse. The Eels probably have a training session scheduled on Friday, but surely the game on Thursday could have been scheduled for Townsville instead?\nWhy should the girls have to move? For the same reason anyone should be excluded in the week leading up to football's big day.\nThe playing surface should be pristine, or did the powers-that-be forget to mention that at the negotiating table when they locked in the next three grand finals for Sydney?\nAnd unlike other codes where the ball is in hand or the air for 90 per cent of games, it's on the deck in our code in at least 80 per cent of matches.\nThe narks will say: \"Who cares about the soccer?\" Well, we should, and until we stand up for the code, and make some noise, we will continue to be an afterthought.\nThe game itself promises a very good contest between deserving opponents with different styles.\nMelbourne City will look to dominate, and the Mariners will adjust to whatever is required.\nFor me, Nick Montgomery should have been coach of the year, given how he has drained every ounce of effort, quality and tactical nuance from his team.\nCarl Veart at Adelaide is a worthy alternate, no doubt, having excited all of us with their cavalier displays. I think but for his penchant for questioning the bullshit and philosophy of some in favour of competitive pragmatism, Montgomery would have won a close vote.\nCraig Goodwin - yes, a former Jet - won player of the year, and you will get no arguments there.\nThe grand final is a difficult match to predict.\nIn last season's decider, Melbourne City stuck arrogantly to their processes, despite losing twice and drawing once in the regular season against Western United. Sure enough, Western proved their dominance was no fluke and City lost to a simple, hardly covert tactical approach. They must guard against a similar fate tonight.\nTo be fair, the Mariners have more to throw at them than Western did, and are definitely more equipped to challenge them physically.\nHow aggressive they are without the ball is key to the result. Too gung-ho and they will be picked apart, too submissive and they will be worn down eventually.\nMontgomery must find the right balance and change the intensity when the time is right.\nHad this game been played last week, I might have tipped the Mariners, and I still think they a decent chance of winning. City have some real quality in key areas, and I can't help thinking a Leckie or Tillio might find that one moment of magic.\nI can't see the Mariners changing too much about their formation, or tactical application. They will defend with tenacity, and attack with pace and skill where possible.\nCity coach Rado Vidisic probably has a decision or two to make in terms of personnel. Berenguer or Nabbout? The former would send Tillio wider and add guile. Nabbout, pace and power. Does he find a spot for retiring captain Scott Jamieson?\nMay the surface be good, and the winners deserving.\nAnd, please, may the VAR remember it's about players, not you.\nIN THE NEWS\n- University unions at war over industrial dispute\n- 'Lived for family and football': tributes flow after Kooragang death\n- Ice-fuelled rampage blamed for domestic violence: court\n- Man 'threatened with gun' at Edgeworth\n- PHOTOS: Port Stephens whale-watching season starts with a splash\n- Marks Point skate park petition goes to council\n- Reece Walsh throws down Origin gauntlet to Kalyn Ponga\nTo see more stories and read today's paper download the Newcastle Herald news app here.",
