  "body_text": "Skinner: My players can hold heads high\nMarc Skinner told his players to keep their heads held high as he praised them for the season they have had despite FA Cup Final loss.\nHowever, having finished in the top three in the league, the Reds have once again secured Champions League football for next season and can be proud of the season we have had.\nWhen asked in his press conference what he said to his players after the game, Skinner explained: \"I just said to be proud. It's really hard at this point to find the words to kind of give people some solace. But I don't want any one of my players to walk out without their head held high, because what they've done this season is fantastic.\"\nRead more key points from Skinner's post-match media briefing below...\nSkinner: We felt your support\nMarc Skinner begins his review of the 2025 Women's FA Cup final by thanking our incredible fan base...\n\"We started off well, I felt we matched them physically. There was a lot of talk around tactically their rotations in midfield but I think we just needed to be a little bit braver.\n\"The game was swung on set pieces. It was a penalty, it's poor from us. I'm not blaming the set pieces but it's the concentration and player individuality within that. We've got some work to do.\n\"But credit to them though and congratulations to them on the season they've had.\"\n\"The young team that I've got, their experience will grow from this moment. I saw Anna Sandberg at the end, she's distraught but she's in a big final and she'll learn from this.\n\"There's loads and loads of learning opportunities. As disappointed as I am, we've had a fantastic season. We've had a fantastic season to do what we've done and get into Champions League qualification again. Those moments, we will fix.\"\nChelsea 3 United Women 0\nArticleOur report from Wembley details how the 2025 Adobe Women's FA Cup final was played out.\n\"I felt that if we started the game without physically matching them, then I felt that we wouldn't have a foothold in the game. It was a pretty balanced first half, we had to defend, but I don't think either keeper really had to do that much.\n\"What I didn't like against Arsenal was that we didn't have much change. I felt Toone could come on later on in the second half and make the difference. It just so happens at half-time we take an injury to Millie [Turner], and she has to come out, so we had to adapt.\"\nTalking points: Women's FA Cup final\nArticleWe assess some of the takeaways from Wembley following a difficult afternoon against Chelsea.\n\"I've got to dig deep in my thoughts and see where I can close that gap, but I will do that for sure.\n\"I think we really missed Jayde [Riviere] today, because when they invaded the wing-backs, we would have been able to jump back a lot better but Aoife [Mannion] has been fantastic this season. So I think those are the areas that we need to look at strengthening.\"",
