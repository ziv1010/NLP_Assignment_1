We drive by them all the time in the course of our daily routines, and it is easy just to stop for a few minutes to have a look around. As often as not we find what we are looking for at a good price, or at the very least, we find a friend there to talk to, which makes the whole experience worthwhile. Supporting local merchants also is a way of supporting the town. When the local economy thrives, so does the community as a whole. Thriving local businesses donate cash and in-kind goods and services to countless local organizations working on behalf of the townspeople. Their contribution to Newtown’s tax base is also substantial, bringing more resources to bear in our efforts as a town to educate our young, keep our roads in good repair, to safeguard our natural resources, and to create local cultural and recreational opportunities for young and old alike. By shopping locally, we not only work our way through our holiday gift lists with a minimum of stress, we are, in a way, giving ourselves a gift as well.\n* * * * *\nNew evidence shows that crowding in Newtown schools may end up being even worse than expected, and it may happen sooner. Newtown Middle School, even with creative use of space, will soon become “hopelessly overcrowded,” according to Dr Bruce Bothwell of Focus Consulting Associates, in his latest enrollment update report for the Newtown Public Schools. In his report to the Board of Education Tuesday night, he made it clear that his warnings about severe crowding at the middle school level are not conjecture. “Those children are in the system now,” he said.\n* * * * *\nState and federal highway safety officials have presented the police department with an award for enforcing the state law requiring motorists to use safety belts while traveling. The “Award for Extraordinary Efforts in Achieving 80 Percent-Plus Compliance” now hangs in the police station’s squad room. The state Department of Transportation and the National Highway Safety Program presented the award to the police department recently. The award signifies that town police exceeded the highway safety project’s goal of increasing the local use of safety belts and child safety seats.\n* * * * *\nA new addition to the Festival of Trees this year will be a section of theme trees completely designed and decorated by local groups of children. The Cub Scouts from Den 20, Pack 170 spent some time during their meeting last week at St Rose School to put their tree together. The boys decided to make a Lego tree for the Festival of Trees, which this year will be presented at C.H. Booth Library.\n* * * * *\nFormer college player, coach and basketball junkie John Quinn began a new era in the history of the Newtown High School basketball program on Monday afternoon. Coach Quinn held his first practice as the head of the NHS boys’ basketball team. He takes over for Kevin O’Sullivan, who manned the Newtown sidelines for 22 years, since the 1975-76 season.\nNovember 30, 1973\nThree new signs have been located on the recently completed Elm Drive indicating to those who travel on two wheels where the bike path is. Hopefully, the cars will stay to the center of the road from the white line, the bikes between the line and the shoulder, and the walkers on the gravel path just off the roadway. These signs were put up this week at the direction of First Selectman Frank DeLucia and will be ready to welcome the traffic to the park when it begins again in the spring. Hopefully, the sign also in evidence, that instructing a speed limit of 25 mph will also be observed as it is now being abused.\n* * * * *\nPauline W. Knibloe, a Democratic member of the Board of Finance since 1951 and currently its only woman member, tendered her resignation at the November 26 meeting, effective December 1. “I am looking forward to a long, healthy and happy retirement,” she said in a prepared statement. “After serving for approximately 22 years, I think I’ve earned the right to be in the category of a resident of Newtown who has discharged her duties of service to the town. It is my sincere hope that my successor will have the satisfaction that I have had in seeing a continued, orderly growth of the Town of Newtown with the Board of Finance as the proverbial ‘watchdog.’ I can only hope that the board continues its present form of harmonious cooperation.”\n* * * * *\nAt the request of the Board of Education, Theodore Whippie, chairman of the Conservation Commission, attended the Board’s November 27 meeting for the purpose of discussion of soil conditions and topography of the Allen property and the Boyle site. In giving his presentation Mr Whippie used slides of maps showing soils and contours of the sites and the areas surrounding them.\n* * * * *\nOlga L. Paproski was chosen Fairfield County Farm Bureau’s Mother of the Year at the annual meeting in October. She was presented with a plaque at the November 26 meeting. The Paproskis have been members of Farm Bureau for 21 years. During that time she has helped on membership and is now Chairman. She has been a delegate to Denver and other conventions. As a previous Women’s chairman, she has been active as an instigator on projects, such as setting up a booth at the Danbury Fair selling and starting the state pins, promoting Rural-Urban Farm and Egg Promotions, and in other activities as resolutions and legislation. She has always been there with her ideas and willingness to assist and participate.\n* * * * *\nThe Newtown Ambulance Association Inc had its annual meeting on November 13.

The above picture does not include the officers and basketball captains with their generous hostess, Mrs Edith Parker, who is also the club’s Senior Vice-President. Incidentally, the S.A.C. basketball season opens on Sunday evening, November 28, at the Edmond Town Hall gym at 7 o’clock, when the Big and Little Sacks will play a twin bill with teams from St Mary’s Boys Club in Bethel. … Pictured above, left to right: Front row, Captain Kenny Berglund, Little S.A.C.’s Captain Phillie Britton, Midgets; Co-Captain Pudge Lockwood, Midgets; Back row, Junior President, Jim Knapp; Junior Treasurer, Joe Hellauer; Mrs Parker, hostess; Co-Chairman Bob McMahon, Little S.A.C.’s; Captain Ronney Morgan, Big S.A.C.’s.\n* * * * *\nStudents, parents and friends of Hawley School take much pride in this year’s record of the school’s six-man football team, which for the second year in a row has won the Housatonic Valley Schoolmen’s League championship. The record includes 8 wins and 1 loss, in the season’s first game at Bethel. In the nine games played this season, the Hawley high school team scored 214 points compared to 101 points scored by their opponents. Home games were played against Washington, Regional and New Milford as well as the largely attended night game with Bethel. The Hawley team traveled for games away from home at Bethel, New Milford, Guilford, Regional at Falls Village, and Washington.\n* * * * *\nOf particular interest to all who attended the card party sponsored by the members of St. Rose church last Friday evening in Edmond Town Hall was the presence of the Rt Rev Monsignor William Collins, former pastor of St. Rose Church. Rev Collins, who was popular not only with his own parishioners but with all townspeople, was pastor of the Newtown church for 15 years before being transferred to his present position as pastor of St. Joseph’s Cathedral in Hartford. Adding interest to the successful evening of cards and bingo was the raffling of two turkeys and the numerous door prizes donated by business men and friends of the parish. The benefits of the party, which was held under the chairmanship of Mrs William H. Gannon, will go to the church.\n* * * * *\nIt has been announced by Danny Lawler, golf pro, that the Newtown Country Club is now officially closed for the season. It has also been requested that there be no trespassing on the golf course as the greens are now covered with a winter protective coat which, if not walked on, will keep the greens in perfect condition for the spring season.\n* * * * *\n“Doc” Crowe has confided in the editor of The Bee that he and Mrs Crowe have an extra large turkey this year for Thanksgiving dinner, and so he will close the Corbett and Crowe drug store promptly at 12 o’clock on Thanksgiving and remain closed for the rest of the day. “Doc” didn’t say so, but The Bee would like to say it for him, that even a druggist is entitled to an occasional day off, and so we hope that “Doc” and Mrs Crowe spend an enjoyable Thanksgiving Day.\n* * * * *\nScudder Smith, who is a student at Berkshire School, Sheffield, Mass., spent the week-end at the home of his parents, Mr and Mrs Paul S. Smith of Main Street.\nNovember 23, 1923\nA very pretty wedding took place in Buffalo, N.Y., October 31, when Miss Florence Caddick, youngest daughter of Mr and Mrs E.

Platt celebrated their silver wedding anniversary at their spacious and pleasant home in Hopewell district. In response to invitations a company of about 150 gathered to do honor to the bride and groom of 25 years ago. Newtown, Redding, Easton, Monroe, South Britain, Southbury and Woodbury were all represented by the guests of the evening. A quarter of a century ago, an ardent wooing terminated in a happy marriage and on November 23, 1873, Theron E. Platt and Mary C. Russell were married at the home of the bride in Southbury by Rev Mr Curtis. They at once went to their present residence in Hopewell and established what has been considered by their intimate friends an ideal home, and which has ever been a place where they delighted to meet them whenever opportunity offered. Mr and Mrs Platt have one son, Philo T. Platt, a promising young man of some 20 summers. … Mrs Platt wore her wedding gown of brown silk and velvet, cut in the style of a quarter century ago. Mr and Mrs Platt can look back with pleasure on their silver anniversary and The Bee joins in wishing for them the golden cup when the time shall be fully ripe.\n* * * * *\nMr and Mrs Daniel Lynch and family wish to express their sincere thanks to all who so kindly assisted during the sickness and death of their daughter, Mrs John F.
