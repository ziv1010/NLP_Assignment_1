Kellie King - \"one of our older players who played with us a couple of years ago. She has impressed at training with how she is always a team player\".\nCOACH'S COMMENTS:\n\"It has been awesome seeing the ladies come and try it out, and also seeing the younger girls at training. You can see the potential that we have in players who are coming through,\" she said.\n\"I think with [Lucy Thompson and Jasmyn Thompson] coming in every now and then for a few games, the confidence in the team will increase with their skill and knowledge of the game.\"\nEXPECTATIONS:\n\"I'm not going to rule out finals, it's everyone's goal to make finals and hopefully win a flag,\" she said.\n\"We're going to take it week by week and I just want the girls to have fun. We have a big group of new girls and I don't want to put too much pressure on them.\"\nBURNIE\nCOACH: Guy Grey\nCAPTAIN: Kirby Brakey\n2023 FINISH: Fifth (four wins and 12 losses)\nINS: Chloe Moran, Cyndra Williams\nOUTS: Kirsten Loring, Lila Blizzard, Piper Humphries, Abbey Pennington\nPLAYERS TO WATCH:\n1. Kirby Brakey - has gone another level with her fitness and has stepped back as an on-field midfield coach to just focus on playing.\n2. Reese Davis - has got fitter and is going to roll a bit into the midfield.\n3. Abbi O'Connor - has been working hard on her fitness and was a bit of a spare parts player last year but has a bit of pace.\nCOACH'S COMMENTS:\n\"During our pre-season, it was a bit inconsistent with numbers on the track and we probably made a mistake having eight runs pre-Christmas because it becomes a bit taxing,\" he said.\n\"After Christmas, I've been pretty happy and we have 25 registered players. Our skills have got better simply by playing and our six youth girls give us a bit of a kick along.\n\"It's going to be challenging and I don't know how we'll go, but we'll be better prepared [this year].\"\nEXPECTATIONS:\n\"There are different expectations around the group this year; last year was about participation and being back in,\" he said.\n\"There is a real feel around the group and a justified effort to want to get better.\n\"I'm still pinching myself that we went so well [last year] and they understand that. I don't have to strip it down as much as I had to last year and [their] understanding of the game is a year ahead now.\"\nLATROBE\nCOACH: Ethan Kay\nCAPTAIN: Leila Jeffrey. Holly Beaumont and Montanah Jago (vice-captains)\n2023 FINISH: Sixth (three wins and 13 losses)\nINS: Lauren Stevenson\nOUTS: Grace Huxtable, Kalynda Cowen\nPLAYERS TO WATCH:\n1. Georgia Perry - has put in a pretty good pre-season and showed us what she can do in the ruck in the practice match, playing most of the game in there.\n2. Jakki Ellings - has put in a big pre-season and really improved her fitness.\n3. Lauren Baxter - has improved her skills with the footy and will have a breakout year.\nCOACH'S COMMENTS:\n\"It's looking really good; from where we started in November the numbers at training have really grown,\" he said.\n\"The players are really gelling and making things work, and it's looking really promising.\"\nEXPECTATIONS:\n\"The main goal, as I've said before, is to make finals and I've made that clear that that is my big goal,\" he said.\n\"They are all on board and have seen how committed and driven I am to making that happen. The group has gelled really well and everyone is on board to make a difference.\"\nCIRCULAR HEAD\nCOACH: Alana Jago\nCAPTAIN: Not appointed yet\n2023 FINISH: Did not play\nPLAYERS TO WATCH:\n1. Kelsie Smith - she started with Scotchtown and worked her way up through Saints' under 17s. She is very mean and aggressive on the ball, and never gives up\n2. Darah Grey and Sahvanna Cox - both will be working in our back line. They have been playing football for some time and are very knowledgeable, so I'm excited to see them step up and show their leadership.\nCOACH'S COMMENTS:\n\"Pre-season has gone really well and I'm overwhelmed with the support that we've got, and the dedication of the girls coming to training every day,\" she said.\n\"The girls are committed. And one of my goals was that I want to make this season fun and sociable, and I said the other day that I feel like we're getting there.\n\"Girls coming from being green, I can see a massive improvement and all we can do is improve.\"\nEXPECTATIONS:\n\"We've come to the goal to make it fun so the next step now is to be competitive on game day,\" she said.\n\"We want to bring what we do at training to game day, especially against the teams who have been playing together for a while.\n\"If we get a win, we get a win and that will be very exciting.\"",
