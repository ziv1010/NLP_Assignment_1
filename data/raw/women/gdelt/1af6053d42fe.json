  "body_text": "Rishi Sunak should suspend betting scandal Tories, Conservative minister suggests\nRishi Sunak should suspend any Tories who placed bets on the general election date, a Government minister has suggested.\nSteve Baker, the Northern Ireland minister, said if it were up to him, anyone who admitted to gambling on the timing of the ballot would be temporarily kicked out of the party.\nHe said it was for the Prime Minister to explain why he hadn’t taken any action to date, adding he had “no inside information” on Mr Sunak’s reasoning.\nIt will pile further pressure on the Prime Minister to suspend those caught up in the scandal, with Craig Williams, a Tory candidate and one of his closest aides, having already admitted to putting “a flutter” on the general election some weeks ago. He now faces an inquiry by the Gambling Commission.\nLaura Saunders, another Conservative candidate, and her husband Tony Lee, the party’s director of campaigning, are also being investigated by the watchdog over alleged betting on the election date.\nSpeaking to ITV’s Peston on Monday night, Mr Baker said: “If they placed bets it was disreputable and I would call them up and ask them, did you do it? And if they did it, then they are suspended.”\nHe added: “But the Prime Minister would have to answer why he hasn’t done it, I haven’t got inside information on why the Prime Minister hasn’t done it.”\nTobias Ellwood, the former Tory defence minister, also argued on Monday that Mr Sunak should have suspended the Conservative candidates caught up in the betting scandal.\nAsked if the Prime Minister should have taken that action, he told the BBC: “Given the scale of this as we see now and the potential for this story to continue to eclipse, to overshadow the election, I would now agree.\n“I am not sure anyone, including the Prime Minister, could have predicted the number of people involved when this story first broke. The public want to see clear, robust action now.\n“The practical dilemma you face, though, is were individuals responding to the whirlwind of the rumour mill around Westminster at the time… about a pending election announcement, or were they in the room when the decision was made?\n“If it was the latter, the party can take immediate action. Otherwise it is for the Gambling Commission to rightly make that judgement.”\nOn Monday, Mr Sunak, who has ordered an internal inquiry to run separately to the Gambling Commission’s investigation, said he was “incredibly angry when I learned about the allegations, as everybody would be when they would hear about something like that”.\nHe said he was not aware of any other Tory candidates being investigated but stressed that any internal inquiries by the Conservative Party must not “compromise the integrity of… police and other investigations”.\nMeanwhile, Sir Iain Duncan-Smith said that he was “opposed to people associated with politics betting on political outcomes in general”.\nThe former Tory leader told The Guardian: “You can either do it by the party saying it won’t be tolerated, or you could do it by legislation. If you start relying on legislation, it would be a complex process.\n“Parties are capable of saying that anyone who does this shouldn’t be in the party. They can move quicker than governments.”\nHe added: “But one way or the other, it needs to be made clear that the public takes a dim view of it and it shouldn’t happen. It’s a matter for the next parliament.”\n10:02 PM BST\nThat’s all for today...\nThanks for following today’s election liveblog.\nMy colleague Jack Maidment will be back tomorrow morning to bring you the latest.\n09:48 PM BST\nCommentator Katie Hopkins attends Reform UK event\nControversial Right-wing commentator Katie Hopkins has attended a Reform UK campaign event in Newton Abbot.\nMs Hopkins said in a video on X that there had been “lovely happy hopeful crowds” at the Reform event.\nShe said: “There is a lot of young people here and I’ve met them personally. And this is what politics should be like. Ordinary people getting together, having a lovely time and having a conversation. Well done to everybody from Reform.”\nMs Hopkins had been permanently banned from Twitter in 2020 for what Twitter said was a violation of its hateful conduct policy, but was reinstated last year.\nShe previously posted claims that a photo showing the body of a Syrian child on a Turkish beach was staged and also tweeted “we need a final solution” after the Manchester bombings.\n09:23 PM BST\nNigel Farage claims children’s minds are being ‘poisoned at school and university’\nNigel Farage has said children’s minds are being “poisoned at school”.\nSpeaking at a rally in Devon, the Reform UK leader said: “My commitment to you is that I’m (going to be a part of Reform) for at least the next five years.\n“I believe we can get millions of people signed up to this movement, millions of people that want British values to be re-established.”\nHe added: “Millions of people who don’t want our kids being poisoned at school and university, being told our country is the worst country that ever existed.”\n08:54 PM BST\nSir Ed Davey suggests he would back a total ban on politicians making political bets\nSir Ed Davey has suggested that he would support a total ban on politicians betting on political outcomes.\nThe Liberal Democrat leader has said that the question of politicians making political bets should be looked at “robustly”.\nHe told Channel 5: “Let’s follow the good process and look at all the details. Footballers are back from betting, sports people are, people in the city where they have insider trading, it’s called.\n“People shouldn’t make profits on things where they have the knowledge that something’s going to happen. If you know something’s going to happen, you shouldn’t be allowed to bet on it, it’s immoral right?\n“There may be other circumstances, if you don’t know the outcome of an election, I mean, everyone bets on the outcomes of elections, and maybe that’s okay.\n“But I’m happy for it to be looked at and looked at robustly and if that means that politicians can’t bet on politics at all well then I’d be happy to go with that.”\n08:40 PM BST\nFarage: ‘Nothing to stop’ Reform UK winning seats in the South West\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage has said there is nothing stopping his party from winning “a couple of seats” in the General Election.\nMr Farage told a rally in Devon that Reform is “on the up” and while he expects Labour to win, his party was “live in second position”.\nHe said: “Many of these seats (in the West Country) will be decided in Devon and elsewhere by literally a couple of hundred votes either way and I think you’re gonna find we’re in the mix.\n“There’s nothing to stop us winning a couple of these seats.\n“But to do it, we’re going to need to maintain that momentum, we need to maintain that conversation.”\n08:23 PM BST\n‘Pub bore’ Farage wrong on Ukraine, says minister\nChris Heaton-Harris has attacked Nigel Farage for being a “pub bore” after the Reform UK leader doubled down on his belief that Nato expansion led to the war in Ukraine, Tim Sigsworth writes.\nSpeaking at The Sun after the Never Mind The Ballots leaders’ special, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland told The Telegraph: “Boris is absolutely right on this.\n“And I think Boris can actually demonstrate his support for the people in Ukraine, for the Government of Ukraine, for President Zelensky because his government stood up for Ukraine.\n“Tonight we had Keir Starmer basically saying Boris made all the right calls. So I think maybe Nigel has become a bit of a pub bore on this.”\n08:22 PM BST\nLord Kinnock: ‘I wish I’d been fighting this lot’ of Tories\nLord Kinnock has said that he wished he had “been fighting this lot” during his political career.\nThe former Labour leader praised Tories who he had fought at elections in the 1980s as being “smart guys” and “fundamentally decent people”, but that it had “all changed”.\nHe told LBC: “I wish I’d been fighting this lot. Oh, god. No John Major, no Heseltine, no Geoffrey Howe. I mean, the thing is even though they were obviously my opponents and so on, smart guys, fundamentally decent people and patriots.\nHe added: “I mean that’s all changed. And the Conservatives I know and respect, they didn’t have to be my friends, but there are people that I know and respect are despairing at the, can you be superficial and hollow at the same time? Yeah, I know they are. I wouldn’t swap places with them and I actually wouldn’t wish that on my most bloodthirsty enemies.”\n08:10 PM BST\nPictured: Farage at rally in Newton Abbot\n07:53 PM BST\nKeegan ‘very confident’ no cabinet ministers bet on election\nGillian Keegan has said she is “very confident” that no cabinet ministers bet on the date of the general election, Tim Sigsworth writes.\nSpeaking in the spin room after The Sun’s Never Mind The Ballots leaders’ special, the Education Secretary said: “I’m very confident.”\nAsked why no Tory members or officials have yet been suspended in connection with the scandal, she said: “To be fair, those things. I mean hopefully they can be done quite quickly. I don’t know what the timescales are.\n“But to be fair you do need to allow people to have due process and that will actually be determining what follows, what actions need to be taken.”\n07:44 PM BST\nGreens leader: We’re ‘honest’ that our carbon tax plans will make some activities cost more\nThe Green Party’s plans for a carbon tax “will mean that certain activities will cost more”, the co-leader of the Green Party has said.\nShe told ITV: “We’re honest about the fact that it will mean that certain activities will cost more, but it will move that that greening of the economy faster, and it’ll be counter-balanced by lots of other changes that we’re making to the economy and the tax system that will make people better off overall.”\nShe added: “We’re not afraid to talk about how we would raise that. So it’s about changes to the tax system that would move the onus from those on lower incomes who can’t afford to pay very much towards those with the broader shoulders who absolutely can.”\n07:39 PM BST\nFarage on Marine Le Pen: ‘Going to be the next French President, thumbs up’\nNigel Farage has given the “thumbs up” to Marine Le Pen and declared she will be the next French President.\nMr Farage was asked to give a thumbs up or thumbs down judgement for a selection of political leaders in an interview with ITV.\nHe said of Ms Le Pen, the leader of the National Rally party in France: “Going to be the next French President, thumbs up”. He said of Emmanuel Macron: “Oh, huge thumbs down”.\nHe also said of Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni “love her” and of Vladimir Putin: “No, not a nice guy.”\n07:34 PM BST\nTories cannot attack Labour on women’s rights, says Phillipson\nIt is not right for the Conservatives to attack Labour’s stance on transgender issues because of their “record” on women’s rights, Bridget Phillipson has said.\nAsked in The Sun’s spin room about JK Rowling’s accusation that Sir Keir Starmer had “abandoned” women, the Education Secretary said preserving single-sex spaces was “incredibly important” but that the Tories did not have a good “record” on women’s rights.\n“They can talk about this all they like,” she said.\n“Their record is entirely at odds with the reality for women out there.”\n07:30 PM BST\nNigel Farage: My comment about Sunak and D-Day was ‘purely about class’\nNigel Farage has insisted that his comment that Rishi Sunak did not understand “our culture” when he left D-Day early was “purely about class”.\nAsked if he had an issue with people speaking different languages and people of other ethnicities, he said: “I have a huge problem with people coming to Britain and not assimilating, maintaining their own languages, not mixing in communities, that is a disaster.\n“My comment about Mr Sunak was about class, purely about class.”\n07:27 PM BST\nNHS needs a ‘rethink’, says Farage\nNigel Farage has said that there needs to be a “rethink” on the NHS.\nHe told ITV: “What’s the NHS for? Ever since the late 1940s it was for healthcare being free at the point of delivery. And I absolutely, subscribe 100 per cent to that, as to how we get there, we’re spending ever more and we’re getting less out in terms of delivery.\n“At the other end, I’m just saying, let’s have a rethink.”\n07:18 PM BST\nLabour rejects Sunak’s claim he will be proven right on Starmer’s economic competence\nLabour has rejected a claim by Rishi Sunak that he will be proven right in arguing that Sir Keir Starmer cannot be trusted on the economy, just as he was about Liz Truss, Tim Sigsworth writes.\nSpeaking in the spin room after The Sun’s Never Mind The Ballots leaders’ special, a party spokesman said: “We’ve seen Rishi Sunak get more and more desperate during the course of this campaign.\n“It has now been repeatedly proven that his assertions about what Labour would do if we were lucky enough to get into government are completely untrue, and not based on any policies or proposals that we’ve actually put forward.\n“And so, you know, I think the public can frankly see through it for what it is, which is the desperation of the Tory campaign because they haven’t got a record to stand on, and they haven’t got a positive offer for the future.”\n07:13 PM BST\nLabour would prioritise ‘environmental dogma’, says Sunak\nRishi Sunak claimed Labour would prioritise “environmental dogma” over Britain’s national security and the cost of living.\nHe also said Sir Keir Starmer’s party does not understand that “sex means biological sex”.\nHe urged people: “Don’t surrender to Labour”, adding: “Let’s go out and smash it everyone.”\n07:10 PM BST\nSunak tells supporters: ‘Don’t surrender to Labour’\nRishi Sunak has told supporters not to “surrender to Labour”.\nIn a campaign event in London, he said: “Don’t surrender to Labour. Fight for every vote, fight for our values, fight for our vision of Britain, because it is only us Conservatives that can deliver the secure future that our country needs and our country deserves.\n“So let’s get out there and smash it everyone.”\n07:08 PM BST\nSunak: We have 10 days to save Britain\nRishi Sunak opened his speech by warning Tory supporters “we have 10 days to save Britain from a Labour government”.\nHe said he is not “blind” to people’s frustrations with him and the Conservative Party.\nBut he said this is “not a by-election” or a “referendum on me”.\nHe urged people to think about what a Labour government would mean for them and their family.\nMr Sunak also accused Sir Keir Starmer of “U-turning on his U-turning” on his support for Jeremy Corbyn.\n07:00 PM BST\nFarage and Denyer to be interviewed on ITV\nNigel Farage and Carla Denyer will shortly be interviewed on ITV for Reform UK and the Green Party.\nThe pre-recorded interviews will see the leader of Reform and the Greens co-leader be grilled by Harry Horton and Rachel Younger.\n06:56 PM BST\nBacklog of asylum claims would double by the end of the year if the Tories are re-elected, says Starmer\nSir Keir Starmer said that the backlog of asylum claims would double by the end of the year to 100,000 if the Conservatives are re-elected.\n“There are 50,000 people not being processed, if we carry on with Rishi Sunak as prime minister it will get to 100k by the end of the year,” the Labour leader said.\nHe said it was “outrageous” to pay hotel bills to accommodate those people not being processed.\n06:42 PM BST\nStarmer: I would ‘welcome’ a discussion with JK Rowling on women’s rights\nSir Keir Starmer has said that he would “welcome” a discussion with JK Rowling over women’s rights and trans issues.\nThe author and campaigner this weekend said that Labour had “abandoned” women and that she would struggle to vote for them.\nAsked whether Labour would meet with Rowling to discuss trans issues, Sir Keir said: “Of course, of course I’d meet with her. Of course I would.”\nHe added: “She’s made some really important points. I’d welcome that discussion, because I do think that we’ve made huge progress on women’s rights under Labour governments, and equality, massive progress. There’s more work to be done if we are privileged to come in to serve this country and I want to make sure that we can bring people together.”\n06:34 PM BST\nStarmer: I understand it’s hard for some parents to send their children to private school\nSir Keir Starmer said that he “completely” understands that it is “quite hard” for some parents to send their children to private school.\nHe told The Sun: “I accept that many families, parents work hard and save hard to send their children to private school because they’ve got aspirations for their children and they think that’s the best place for their child.\n“I’ve got nothing against that, nothing against private schools, and I completely understand that for some parents, that’s quite hard to do because there’s not all the money going around.”\nHe added: “But I genuinely believe that every single parent has aspirations for their children across the whole country, including every single parent who sends their children to state school.”\n06:30 PM BST\nI could guess what Starmer will say next, says Heaton-Harris\nChris Heaton-Harris has joked that he could guess what Sir Keir Starmer is “going to say and say it for him”, writes Tim Sigsworth.\nThe secretary of state for Northern Ireland, who is watching the debate in the spin room with journalists, made the jibe as the stream showing the programme buffered.\n“I could guess what he’s going to say and say it for him,” Mr Heaton-Harris said.\n06:28 PM BST\nPictured: Sir Keir Starmer on The Sun’s ‘Election Showdown’\n06:26 PM BST\nLabour will not reverse Brexit but ‘we can do more on defence and security’, says Starmer\nLabour will not reverse Brexit, but the UK got a “very botched deal”, Sir Keir Starmer has said.\nHe told The Sun that Labour would not reverse Brexit, but added: “If you talk to any business that’s trying to trade, they will tell you it’s not good enough.\n“I think we can do more on defence and security, by the way, with our European partners, but we’re not going back in. We’re not going back into the Single Market, the Customs Union. We’re not going back to freedom of movement. “\n06:22 PM BST\nStarmer: I ensured Labour ‘never veered on fundamentally important things’ under Jeremy Corbyn\nSir Keir Starmer has said that he stayed in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet because he ensured Labour “never veered from its position on things that were fundamentally important, like Nato”.\nChallenged over his historic support for his predecessor, he said: “I didn’t vote for Jeremy Corbyn to be leader of our party in 2015, I didn’t vote for him to become leader. In 2016, I supported other candidates, but our membership returned him as the leader. But that was very difficult for me and for our party, because I thought that we were not going to be heading in the right direction. Everybody then took a decision about what they did, how we dealt with this.\nHe added: “I felt that on issues such as Brexit, which I thought were going to define us for decades to come, leaders are temporary, but political parties are permanent.\n“But it was important to have a voice in the shadow cabinet, and it meant that I could challenge on anti-Semitism, and it meant that the Labour Party never veered from its position on things that were fundamentally important, like Nato.”\nHe said that he had “reflected” on his time serving in Mr Corbyn’s shadow Cabinet, he said: “ I think it was right to fight, I think, in my case it was right to fight from within the Shadow Cabinet”\n06:17 PM BST\nStarmer: No Labour leader ‘has ever done anything as serious’ to change the Labour Party\nSir Keir Starmer has said that “no Labour leader has ever done anything as serious” as expelling Jeremy Corbyn from the Labour Party.\nHe told The Sun: “Look at my leadership on this. I picked up the Labour Party, I recognised many people had not voted for us last time, possibly people in this room and I said, ‘we’re never going to put that proposition in front of the electorate again. I’m not going to tell to the electorate, what do you think you’re doing?’ I’m going to say to my party, we need to shake this up and change it.\n“So I’ve changed the Labour Party, so there’s a fundamentally different choice at this election. And Jeremy Corbyn not only lost the whip as a Labour MP, he’s now been expelled from the Labour Party. No Labour leader has ever done anything as serious as that about changing his or her party before.\nHe added: “I’ve changed it, and now I hope that there is a Labour Party which people feel that they can vote for this time in a way which I accept wasn’t the case last time around.”\n06:13 PM BST\nStarmer praises Boris Johnson for ‘strong position’ on Ukraine\nSir Keir Starmer has praised Boris Johnson for taking a “strong position” on Ukraine.\nHe criticised the former prime minister for his behaviour on Partygate, but added: “To be fair on Ukraine, he took a strong position”.\nHe added: “I was leader of the opposition, and I said, we will support the government. And so there’s been unity in parliament from the outbreak of that conflict and Russia aggression there.\n“And I thought that was important, Boris Johnson thought it was important, because I think we both took the view that the only winner, if there was a split in our politics here in the UK, would be Putin. He wanted to see division in other countries, and we didn’t allow him.”\n06:09 PM BST\nSunak: I was right about Liz Truss so you can trust me on Sir Keir Starmer\nRishi Sunak has said that voters can trust what he says about Sir Keir Starmer because he was right to warn about Liz Truss’s plans for the economy.\nThe Prime Minister ran against Ms Truss to become Tory leader and lost to her in the summer 2022 leadership election.\nRishi Sunak told The Sun: “I spent a summer a couple of summers’ ago saying that what Liz Truss was proposing was wrong, and I was behind. And everyone said to me, ‘why are you bothering? Why are you still talking about this? No one wants to hear what you have to say.’ I kept talking about it every day of that because I believed in what I was saying.”\nHe added: “I was right then when I warned about Liz Truss, and that’s why all of you can trust me now, when I also warn about the damage that Keir Starmer would do to our economy.”\nHe told voters: “And I’m telling you again now, all seems a bit familiar. If Keir Starmer is your Prime Minister, the economy is going to suffer, and all of you are going to suffer. I don’t want to see that happen. That’s why I’m carrying on going every day in this election. I believe in what I’m saying, and I want to stop those tax rises.”\n05:54 PM BST\nRishi Sunak apologises to voter whose father died after waiting months for cancer diagnosis\nRishi Sunak has apologised to a voter whose father died after waiting months for a cancer diagnosis.\nThe woman told the Prime Minister that her family has been through “18 months of hell” and that they felt “let down”.\nMr Sunak told her: “One of the ways we’re doing that is by rolling out things called community diagnostic centres. So we’ve done 160 and if we’re re-elected, we’ll do many more. And these are units in your local community where you can get all your checks, tests and scans done, and that way, get your diagnosis much quicker.\n“We’re hiring more oncologists, we’re using technology as well and new forms of testing to identify things, but fundamentally, what happened to you and your family isn’t acceptable. I can only apologise. The challenges we’re dealing with with Covid, cancer in particular, was one where for two years, lots of people didn’t present with symptoms, and we’re catching up with that now, and that’s an awful tragedy.”\nAsked whose responsibility it was that NHS waiting lists had soared, he said: “It’s my responsibility, because I’m the one in charge, and I’ve been very clear, we haven’t made as much progress on waiting lists as I would have liked.”\n05:49 PM BST\nRishi Sunak refused to say whose ‘fault’ it is that migration is ‘too high’\nRishi Sunak has refused to say whose fault it is that net migration is “too high”.\nAsked whose fault the level of migration into the UK was, he said on three occasions “the numbers were too high”.\nHe told The Sun: “I’ve got that. I’ve got the job, and I brought them down.”\n05:45 PM BST\nSunak admits ‘we haven’t got the job done’ on illegal migration\nRishi Sunak has admitted that “we haven’t got the job done” on illegal migration.\nHe told The Sun: “I want people to know where I stand. I think illegal migration is unfair. I don’t think it’s right that people come to our country illegally, and I want to do everything I can to stop it.”\n“Let’s be clear, right over the last 12 months, the numbers are lower than they were, this year, already, a full year, it’s down on the year before.\n“But I’m being clear, we haven’t got the job done. The only way to do that is to make sure that we make it clear that to come to our country illegally, you won’t get to stay. You’ll be removed.”\n05:41 PM BST\nIt’s not right to say we haven’t made progress in 14 years, insists Sunak\nRishi Sunak has insisted that it is “not right” to say that the UK has not made any progress in 14 years.\nThe Prime Minister told The Sun: “I don’t think it’s right to say that we haven’t made progress in 14 years, I simply don’t believe that.”\nHe added: “And if you look at 14 years, what the Conservatives have done, we’ve ensured that our school children in this country, in England, are not just the best readers in the United Kingdom, they’re best readers in the Western world.\nHe added: “So yes, of course, not everything is perfect. Of course, we haven’t made as much progress as we would have liked to in some areas, but it’s just simply not right to say that the record of the last 14 years is one where we haven’t made progress.”\n05:37 PM BST\nSunak: ‘We won’t hesitate to act’ on findings of our internal investigation into election bets\nRishi Sunak has said that he will not “hesitate to act on information or findings that come to light” in the internal party investigation into the allegations of betting on the election date.\nHe told The Sun: “The Gambling Commission, who are investigating this, as well as the police, obviously, are independent of me, of Government. I don’t have access to the details of their investigation. They don’t report to me.\n“But what I can tell you is, in parallel, we have been conducting internal inquiries of our own into the situation, and won’t hesitate to act on information or findings that come to light.”\nHe added: “I want to reassure people we are in parallel and have been conducting internal inquiries and won’t hesitate to act if findings or information comes to light. And I’ve been crystal clear, if anyone has broken the rules then they should face not just the full consequences of the law, but they will be booted out of the Conservative Party.”\n05:26 PM BST\nClegg accuses Starmer of ‘peculiar rewriting of recent history’\nSir Nick Clegg has accused Sir Keir Starmer of a “peculiar rewriting of recent history”, after the Labour leader said that low growth “started well before Brexit”.\nThe former deputy prime minister has called for Labour to be “bold” about its growth plans, and claimed that the “tinkering around the edges with the EU as currently proposed is not enough”.\nIt comes after Sir Keir Starmer said that “the problem with low growth, which has been at the heart of the economic problem in this country for 14 years, started well before Brexit”.\nSir Nick, now President of Global Affairs at Meta, wrote: “For the country’s sake I hope Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves succeed in restoring growth to the British economy.\nBut ruling out even the option of joining the EU’s Customs Union, on the basis that ‘low growth, which has been at the heart of the economic problem in this country for 14 years, started well before Brexit’, is a peculiar rewriting of recent history.”\n05:14 PM BST\nSunak and Starmer to face grilling on The Sun’s ‘Election Showdown’\nSir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are shortly going head to head on The Sun’s “Election Showdown”.\nBoth party leaders will face a grilling from The Sun’s Political Editor Harry Cole, before facing questions from a live studio audience.\nThe Prime Minister will go first, and will head to the stage at around 5:30pm.\n05:06 PM BST\nGreen Party leader admits she has gas boiler, not heat pump\nThe Green Party leader has admitted that she still has a gas boiler despite her party’s commitment to reach net zero by 2040.\nCarla Denyer, the co-leader of the Greens, has insisted she is “in the process of getting quotes” for an air source heat pump.\nBut she told ITV that she had put replacing it “on pause” during the general election and that she would revisit it once the campaign was over.\n04:56 PM BST\nParents ‘will be kept in the dark’ under Labour, claim Tories\nUnder Labour, parents will be kept in the dark as their children are taught contested gender ideology in the classroom.\nDon't give Keir Starmer a blank cheque when it comes to our children. pic.twitter.com/Iv0zpm1lZL— Conservatives (@Conservatives) June 24, 2024\n04:39 PM BST\nStarmer: I would offer to pay if I saw a parent shoplifting baby formula\nSir Keir Starmer has said he would offer to pay if he saw a parent shoplifting baby formula.\nThe Labour leader told the Big Issue: “I’d offer to pay it. The desperation of families around the country should make the Tories feel nothing but shame.\n“Of course, shoplifting is a problem for businesses, so we’d have 13,000 more neighbourhood police to provide reassurance on our high streets.\n“But we’d also change the rules so people could use food bank vouchers and loyalty card points to buy baby formula.”\nMeanwhile, Rishi Sunak said he would not, telling the magazine: “Shoplifting is not a victimless crime and we’ll always support shopkeepers to prevent theft. At the same time, we will continue to help parents with the cost of living.”\n04:36 PM BST\nFormer Tory minister says she would not campaign for Tory candidates under investigation\nA former Conservative minister has said that she would not campaign on behalf of Tory candidates who are under investigation for betting on the general election date.\nAndrea Leadsom, who is standing down as an MP, said that she believed that they were “innocent until proven guilty”, but said she would not campaign for someone “under that cloud”\nShe told the BBC: “I would not be going out campaigning for somebody who was under that cloud but I would at the same time, I do think people are innocent until proven guilty.

If you look at the costings numbers at the end of the Labour and Conservative manifestos they have got really very small numbers in them.\n“They don’t give us any sense of what the counterfactual is and what I mean by that, if you look at what they will spend on the NHS, the Conservatives are talking around about an extra £1 billion, Labour an extra couple of billion.\n“This is off a baseline of nearly £200 billion that we spend on the NHS each year and we will be spending somewhere between £30 and £50 billion more by the end of the Parliament.\n“So talking about one or two billion really tells us literally nothing about what they are planning there.”\n08:51 AM BST\nCabinet minister defends Sunak over failure to suspend betting scandal Tories\nChris Heaton-Harris accused a broadcaster of “trying to suggest someone is guilty until proven innocent” when asked why Rishi Sunak would not take robust action over the betting allegations that have engulfed the Conservative Party.\nAsked whether the Prime Minister should ask Craig Williams when he placed his bet, the Northern Ireland Secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest if that conversation has been had but you asked me if I knew, and I don’t.”\nOn whether the fact that the Tory candidate has not been suspended indicates that Mr Sunak is confident the bet was properly placed, Mr Heaton-Harris said he would not provide any extra comment on an ongoing investigation.\nAsked whether he could see how the scandal looks to people, the minister said: “I can see how people do not want people to benefit in betting terms or in other terms from having knowledge of a situation, which is why the investigation needs to be taking place.”\nAsked why the Prime Minister cannot take what former minister Tobias Ellwood has called “robust action”, he told presenter Mishal Husain: “I think what you’re trying to suggest is that someone is guilty until they’re proven innocent and that is not how this works.”\n08:45 AM BST\nEllwood: Sunak should have suspended Tory candidates caught up in betting scandal\nA Tory former minister said Rishi Sunak should have suspended Conservative candidates caught up in the general election betting scandal.\nTobias Ellwood, who is standing for re-election in Bournemouth East, suggested the Prime Minister should have taken action but conceded it may not have been straight forward to do so.\nAsked if the PM should have suspended the two candidates, Craig Williams and Laura Saunders who are being looked into by the Gambling Commission as part of a wider investigation, Mr Ellwood told the BBC: “Given the scale of this as we see now and the potential for this story to continue to eclipse, to overshadow the election, I would now agree.\n“I am not sure anyone, including the Prime Minister, could have predicted the number of people involved when this story first broke. The public want to see clear, robust action now.\n“The practical dilemma you face though is were individuals responding to the whirlwind of the rumour mill around Westminster at the time… about a pending election announcement or were they in the room when the decision was made.\n“If it was the latter the party can take immediate action. Otherwise it is for the Gambling Commission to rightly make that judgement.”\n08:40 AM BST\nEx-minister: Ban politicians and party officials from being able to place political bets\nNew gambling rules should be introduced to ban all politicians and party officials from being able to place bets on political events, a Tory former minister has suggested.\nTobias Ellwood told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “Let’s give the nation greater reassurance that I think it wants to see to ensure this never happens again.\n“Let’s introduce clear rules as you have in the banking world and in the city… let’s prevent any current politician or party professional from placing any bets in the future.\n“That would send a clear message to the public that this sad incident is being taken seriously and it won’t happen again.”\n08:33 AM BST\nNigel Farage celebrates arrival of first grandchild\nStarting the week on a high.

I don’t think the problem with the NHS, fundamentally, is the model of funding which is equitable and built on the principle of fairness and fair access.\n“I think it is about where the money goes.”\n07:49 AM BST\nNorthern Ireland Secretary ‘not really’ a betting man\nChris Heaton-Harris said he was “not really” a betting man.\nAsked what he thought of people who were, the Northern Ireland Secretary told Sky News this morning: “I don’t mind people who have a bet on things they have no knowledge about, which is what most gamblers do.”\nMr Heaton-Harris said that on the campaign trail, people are “worried about what a Labour incoming government might do.”\n“That is what people are talking about,” he said.\n07:40 AM BST\nChris Heaton-Harris: Labour’s private school tax raid ‘unwise’\nChris Heaton-Harris said Labour’s plan to impose VAT on private school fees was “unwise” because it could prompt a pupil exodus, putting huge pressure on the state education sector.\nAsked if he believed the policy was “unfair”, the Northern Ireland Secretary told Sky News: “I think that is unwise certainly. I think people who have saved hard, worked hard, want to spend extra money on their children;’s education should be allowed to.\n“I actually think it is a very bad policy because it also means lots of children would be entering… a state education system which is doing really well but is not ready to cater for thousands of extra pupils coming in at this time.”\n07:30 AM BST\nNorth Sea oil and gas industry not safe with Labour, Sunak to claim\nRishi Sunak will today accuse Labour of “virtue signalling to eco zealots” instead of protecting North Sea oil and gas jobs.\nThe Prime Minister will visit Edinburgh to launch the Scottish Tory manifesto and will claim that Sir Keir Starmer would tax the vital UK energy sector “into oblivion” while attacking Labour’s “ideological” plans to ban new licences.\nIn contrast, he is to pledge that a Tory government would introduce new legislation to guarantee that there would be further annual oil and gas licensing rounds and promise to maintain tax breaks for investment by energy companies.\nYou can read the full story here.\n07:28 AM BST\nCabinet minister accuses Labour of trying to influence Gambling Commission\nA Cabinet minister accused Labour of trying to put “undue influence” on the Gambling Commission over its investigation into the Tory general election betting scandal.\nChris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland Secretary, claimed Labour was trying to “lean on” the organisation.\nPat McFadden, Labour’s election campaign coordinator, wrote to the Gambling Commission at the weekend to urge it to release the names of figures being investigated.\nMr Heaton-Harris said this was “pretty concerning”.\nHe told Times Radio: “It has said it is investigating offences in relation to the date of the election, that it is an ongoing investigation and that it won’t provide any details at this time and it is not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals concerned. And it is right that it has an investigation. It is an independent body.\n“I actually think, I saw that the leader of Labour’s campaign, Pat McFadden, wrote to try and put some undue influence on the Gambling Commission over the weekend and I think that is actually pretty concerning in itself, Labour trying to lean on yet another independent body like it leant on the Speaker of the House of Commons to not have a vote on Gaza.\n“I think you are beginning to see, people are beginning to see, what a Labour government would actually be like in the United Kingdom.”\n07:08 AM BST\nLabour would create ‘more loopholes for predators’ with gender plans, claims Badenoch\nKemi Badenoch claimed Labour’s gender plans would create “more loopholes for predators”.\nA Labour government would reportedly make it easier for people to legally change their gender.\nThe Times reported that the party would remove the requirement for people to have to prove they have lived as another gender for a two year period before they can obtain a gender recognition certificate.\nMs Badenoch, the minister for Women and Equalities, said: “These proposals unravel all the protections in the current system designed to protect women and girls. This change creates more loopholes for predators and bad faith actors to infiltrate women-only spaces and put us at risk.\n“Labour have never understood or cared about this issue or the vulnerable women impacted by their policies.”\n06:57 AM BST\nComing up: Wes Streeting on the broadcast round for Labour\nWes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, is on the morning broadcast round for Labour.\nChris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland Secretary, will be answering questions on behalf of the Conservative Party.\n06:51 AM BST\nStarmer vows to ‘champion our armed forces’\nArmed Forces Week is an opportunity to thank our Armed Forces for all they do to keep Britain safe.\nMy Labour government will champion our armed forces and support our veterans.

I think when Liz Truss left in October 2022, they were 4, 5 per cent.”\nHe added: “If you suffer a massive defeat, clearly the leader is very much responsible for that. What proportion? I don’t know. Obviously there were other mistakes done by other leaders. He called the time of the election.”",
