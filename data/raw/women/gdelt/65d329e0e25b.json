  "body_text": "Manchester United Women stalwart Millie Turner has signed a new deal at the club until 2028.\nThe 28 year old has made 167 appearances for the team and she has been with United since the Women’s team returned in 2018.\nShe has scored 11 goals and has made the second most appearances for the team after Ella Toone.\nThe club’s official website announced “Manchester United is pleased to confirm that defender Millie Turner has signed a contract extension with the club until June 2028.”\n“As one of the ‘originals’ who has been with the club since the formation of its women’s team in 2018, Turner was a key part of the sides that won the 2019 Women’s Championship title, earned UEFA Champions League qualification in 2023, and lifted the FA Cup for the first time last season.”\nThe experienced defender is still a key member of the team as she has made 16 league appearances this season in the heart of the defence.\nHer manager Marc Skinner was delighted with the news and spoke glowingly of the experience and value that she adds to the culture of the squad.\nHe stated, “Millie has been here since the beginning, and she is an important part of the team. She’s part of my leadership group but I still think there is even more growth to come.”\n“We have unfinished business and aspirations for success, she is hungry to keep improving and a key person in driving the high standards we have here as a club.”\nInterim head of women’s football, Matt Johnson, also spoke enthusiastically of Turner’s “positive” attitude and that she will be “critical” to the club’s future success as she is one of the best centre backs in the league.\nThe signing of her deal will certainly go down as one of the most memorable for the club as she brought along her dog Pongo for the occasion, who was loving the attention of the photographers.\nWe are delighted to announce the signing of Pongo on a lifetime contract 🐶❤️\nA special thanks to @MillieTurner_ for accompanying him on this special day 😅✍️#MUWomen pic.twitter.com/2UA5LK2Cze\n— Manchester United Women (@ManUtdWomen) March 21, 2025\nTurner will next be in action for the club this Sunday when the Red Devils face an away trip to Aston Villa.\nFeatured image Molly Darlington via Getty Images\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
