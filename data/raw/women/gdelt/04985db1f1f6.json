  "body_text": "Head Coach Justine Madugu remains optimistic about Nigeria’s prospects in their 2026 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) qualifying tie against Bénin Republic, despite a major setback with the withdrawal of key midfielder Jennifer Echegini.\nThe Paris Saint-Germain star sustained a hamstring injury during her club’s league match on Monday night, ruling her out of both legs of the final qualifying fixture.\nEchegini, who netted Nigeria’s decisive goal in the 2024 WAFCON final against hosts Morocco in [oo1] Rabat, will miss the first leg on Friday at the Stade de Kégué, Lomé, and the return leg scheduled for Tuesday at the MKO Abiola Stadium, Abuja. Her absence is a blow to the Super Falcons, but Madugu insists the team has enough depth to secure qualification.\nTeam captain Rasheedat Ajibade, also of PSG, is expected to arrive in Lomé on Tuesday night alongside Osinachi Ohale and Chinwendu Ihezuo (Mexico), Michelle Alozie and Deborah Abiodun (USA), Esther Okoronkwo (Canada), and Shukurat Oladipo (Italy). The Falcons’ camp grew to 11 players on Monday night following the arrival of Christy Ucheibe (Portugal) and goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie, with Ashley Plumptre (Saudi Arabia) joining on Tuesday afternoon.\nMeanwhile, Nigeria’s U17 women’s team, the Flamingos, face a crucial task in their second FIFA U17 Women’s World Cup Group D match against France, following a disappointing 4–1 loss to Canada in their opener. The fixture, scheduled for 8 p.m. Wednesday at the Football Academy Mohammed VI (Pitch 1) in Rabat, is pivotal to Nigeria’s survival hopes.\nThe clash revives memories of their 2012 quarter-final encounter in Azerbaijan, where France edged Nigeria 5–3 on penalties after a goalless draw. Currently bottom of the group with zero points and a –3 goal difference, the Flamingos must secure at least a draw to stay in contention, though victory would transform their campaign.\nCoach Bankole Olowookere has urged his players to tighten their defence, maintain focus, and display resilience. “This is not just about tactics,” he emphasized. “It’s about belief, redemption, and survival.”\nUPDATE NEWS:\nNigerians can now invest ₦2.5 million on premium domains and profit about ₦17-₦25 million.
