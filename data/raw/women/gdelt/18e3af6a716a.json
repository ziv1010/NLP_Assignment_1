Competitive events from Miss USA to Miss Universe have all had their fair share of scandals and controversies over the years.\nIn 1984, Miss America Vanessa Williams famously gave up her crown after nude photos were published in Penthouse. Years later, in 2006, Miss USA Tara Conner kept her sash when then-Miss Universe owner and now President of the United States Donald Trump offered her a second chance after she admitted to abusing drugs and alcohol.\nIn November 2025 two controversies took over the pageant world. The first was an argument that broke out between Miss Mexico Fátima Bosch and Thai businessman Nawat Itsaragrisil during a sash ceremony. The second, was when Miss Universe judge Omar Harfouch dropped out of the pageant after claiming there was “lack of transparency” in voting.\nKeep scrolling to see the biggest beauty pageant scandals through the years:\nVanessa Williams\nBefore she became an accomplished singer and actress, Vanessa Williams had her Miss America title taken away when racy photos of herself were leaked and published in Penthouse magazine. Williams, who was the first African-American Miss America, was also the first to resign.\nMore than thirty years later, she returned as the head judge of the pageant and CEO Sam Haskell issued an official apology to Williams. “I want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made you feel any less than the Miss America that you are and Miss America you always will be,” he said.\nKarlie Hay\nHours after Karlie Hay was crowned Miss Teen USA 2016, screenshots of racist tweets she posted a few years back — including some using the N-word — resurfaced online. She quickly owned up to using the offensive language and apologized in an Instagram post.\nWhile the Miss Universe Organization called her word choice “unacceptable,” they said she will not have to give up her crown.\nDestiny Velez\nMiss Puerto Rico 2015 Destiny Vélez was suspended by the Miss America Organization after she tweeted a series of anti-Muslim messages. Fahrenheit 9/11 filmmaker Michael Moore shared a photo of himself holding a sign outside of Trump Tower that said, “We are all Muslim,” in response to Trump’s comments about banning Muslims from entering the U.S.\nVélez launched into a tirade, saying that Muslims have “terrorizing agendas.”\nDoron Matalon and Saly Greige\nSelfie scandal! Miss Israel Doron Matalon and Miss Lebanon Saly Greige caused an uproar for taking a smiling selfie together at Miss Universe 2014. While it seemed innocent, the two countries had been at war for years.\nGreige claimed on Facebook that Matalon photobombed her while she was having her pic taken with other ladies and posted it on social media. Matron countered on Instagram that it was “too bad [she] cannot put the hostility out of the game, only for three weeks of an experience of a lifetime.”\nNia Sanchez\nMiss USA 2014 Nia Sanchez was accused of faking that she lived in Nevada when she forgot the capital of her supposed home state. During a radio interview, she blanked out on the answer. “Oh oh agh, umm, oh my gosh,” she said, before the host rescued her and said, “Carson City.”\nShe had competed in Miss California three times and had never won, sparking rumors that she set up a paper trail to make it appear she met the minimum residency requirements for the Nevada competition.\nSteve Harvey\nThe 2015 Miss Universe host made a mega gaffe — and broke the internet — when he announced the wrong winner of the pageant. He mistakenly read that Miss Colombia Ariadna Gutierrez was the victor, when really Miss Philippines, Pia Wurtzbach, had won the coveted crown.\nHe later explained that the text on the card for the first runner-up was bigger and bolder than the winner’s name. “Did I make a mistake? Yes I did, wholeheartedly,” he said on his talk show. “You make a mistake and you own up to it. And I tried to fix it, I tried to fix it right there.”\nElizabeth Fechtel\nFlorida and those recounts! During the Miss Florida 2014 pageant, Elizabeth Fechtel was originally crowned the winner before the pageant organizers realized there had been an error in counting the votes, and Victoria Cowen was the true champ.\nSeveral days later, officials showed up at Fechtel’s home to inform her of the mistake. Apparently, a judge had switched his or her choice at the last minute and drawn arrows on the ballot to reverse the names, but it had been overlooked initially.\nAmanda Longacre\nAmanda Longacre was originally given the title of Miss Delaware 2014 but was later deemed too old to complete in Miss America; Contestants must be 17 to 24 years old. Longacre was still 24 at the September competition, but she turned 25 in October. According to pageant officials, there’s a clause stating that a Miss America hopeful cannot turn 25 before the end of the year. While she didn’t keep the crown, she was able to keep the scholarship money she was awarded.\nRima Fakih\nThe controversy started when seductive photos of Miss USA 2010 Rima Fakih on a stripper pole — allegedly at a Detroit radio show’s “Stripper 101” contest — leaked. She fought back, saying the pics were from a pole dancing class she had attended several years ago. More people called for her resignation when she slept through an interview after a late night of partying and lied about it, only to be caught red handed by hotel security cameras.\nJust weeks before handing off her crown, she almost missed a CNN interview after another night of drinking, but managed to hold on to her title until the end of her reign.\nCarrie Prejean\nMiss California 2009 Carrie Prejean came under fire for her controversial answer to a question about same-sex marriage asked by openly gay judge Perez Hilton during the Miss USA Q&A portion. ”We live in a land where you can choose same-sex marriage or opposite marriage. I believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman,” Prejean said.\nDozens of celebs and social media users bashed her response, saying she should lose her title. While she was never stripped of her title for her comments, a combination of leaked topless photos and missed appearances led to her firing. Miss California organizers cited the official reason as breach of contract.\nLaura Zuniga\nAfter claiming her crown as Reina Hispanoamericana 2008, Laura Zuniga was arrested with a group of seven suspected drug cartel members for carrying a variety of weapons in their trucks, including assault riffles and handguns, 633 cartridges, 16 cellphones and $53,000 in cash. Images appeared of Zuniga in handcuffs standing in front of a table piled with guns and money. She was dethroned and sentenced to 40 days under arrest pending charges on racketeering, drug trafficking, guns and money laundering.\nCaitlin Upton\nIn possibly the most viral pageant flub ever, Miss South Carolina Teen USA 2007 Caitlin Upton rambled a strange answer to a question about why she thought one in five Americans can’t locate the U.S. on a map.\n“I personally believe U.S. Americans are unable to do so because, uh, some people out there in our nation do not have maps and, uh, I believe that our education like such as in South Africa and, uh, the Iraq, everywhere like such as,” she said at the time. “I believe that they should, our education over here in the U.S. should help the U.S., uh, or, uh, should help South Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries, so we will be able to build up our future.”\nIn 2015, she said that the moment still haunts her and she even contemplated suicide at one point because of the backlash.\nAshley Harder\nAshley Harder surrendered her sash as Miss New Jersey 2007 because she unexpectedly became pregnant during her reign. (Pageant rules previously prohibited Miss USA contestants from being married, pregnant or ever having had children, but this changed in 2023 to allow both married women and mothers.)\nThe decision for Harder to leave the competition was heavily criticized by pro-life advocates who argued that she should be allowed to compete because she chose not to have an abortion.\nTara Conner\nAfter several media reports of Tara Conner’s alcohol and drug abuse following her move to New York City, Conner tested positive for cocaine while holding the Miss USA title. She later admitted that she abused alcohol and prescription painkillers as well.\nDuring a press conference, Trump surprisingly decided to give her a second chance instead of stripping her of her crown, and Conner agreed to go to rehab. “She left a small town in Kentucky and got caught up in the whirlwind we know is New York,” Trump said.\nDanielle Lloyd\nDanielle Lloyd was fired as Miss Great Britain 2006 after she let slip in an interview that she had been dating pageant judge and soccer player Teddy Sheringham prior to the competition. Sheringham was the only judge who voted for Lloyd, who ultimately won based on the audience vote. On top of that, she stripped down for Playboy, violating rules that the winner must not pose nude during her reign.\nAlicia Machado\nLess than a year after her victory as Miss Universe 1996, Alicia Machado gained 42 pounds, going from 118 to 160. Pageant officials threatened to dethrone her if she didn’t lose the weight, so Trump called in a team of fitness and nutrition experts to help her shed the pounds through rigorous dieting and exercise. In an interview with Howard Stern, Trump added fuel to the fire by calling her “an eating machine.”\nFatima Bosch\nMiss Mexico Fátima Bosch made headlines in November 2025 for a tense argument with Thai businessman Nawat Itsaragrisil, who currently holds executive positions within both the Miss Universe Organization and Miss Universe Thailand. Itsaragrisil also serves as president of Miss Grand International.\nThe feud began when Itsaragrisil reportedly called Bosch a “dumb head,” an expression that means “fool” or “empty-headed.”\nBosch told Itsaragrisil, “We respect you, just as you should respect us. I’m here representing my country, and it’s not my fault you have problems with my organization.” He replied, “No, you must listen to me first, then argue with me.” Bosch then stood up and left the room, with other contestants joining her in solidarity, including the current Miss Universe, Denmark’s Victoria Kjær Theilvig.\nAccording to the outlet N+, the argument began after Itsaragrisil questioned why Bosch did not post about the host country on social media. Bosch reportedly tried to tell Itsaragrisil that it was a misunderstanding.\nBosch later spoke out about the viral moment in a statement to the media, saying, “He called me dumb because he has issues with the organization, and I think that’s unfair … I think the world needs to see this, because we are empowered women and this platform is for our voices. No one can silence it. No one will silence me. It doesn’t matter if you have a big dream or a crown. If it takes away your dignity, you should walk away.”\nThe Miss Universe Organization also released a statement.\n“The Miss Universe Organization (MUO) reaffirms its commitment to work closely with the host community, the Miss Grand International Organization (MGI), and all local partners to ensure the success of the 74th edition of the pageant,” the statement read. “A high-level delegation, led by the MUO’s CEO, Mr. Mario Búcaro, is traveling to Thailand to strengthen collaboration with the host country, MGI, and relevant authorities. All scheduled events and activities will take place as planned, reaffirming our shared goal of delivering a global celebration that reflects the values of diversity, empowerment, and inclusion that define the legacy of Miss Universe.”\nJudge Omar Harfouch\nDays before the international pageant kicked off in Thailand in November 2025, judge Omar Harfouch announced he was stepping down from his role. He alleged in a series of Instagram Stories that the Miss Universe Organization created an “impromptu jury” to select the 30 finalists without any of the “real” judges on the panel.\nHarfouch, a composer, claimed that the “non official jury is composed of individuals with a significant possible conflict of interest due to some personal relationships with some of the Miss Universe contestants.” He also alleged that the results from the selection were being kept “secret,” which he found suspect.\n“After having a disrespectful conversation with [Miss Universe CEO] Raul Rocha about the lack of transparency in the Miss Universe voting process, l decided to resign from the jury and refuse to be part of this charade,” Harfouch announced. “I will also not be playing the music composed for the event.”\nThe Miss Universe Organization issued a statement that same day, claiming that it publicly announced the members of the Beyond the Crown Program, which is an “independent social impact initiative designed to promote leadership, service, education, health, inclusion and meaningful support for charitable causes.”\nAccording to the organization, Harfouch “incorrectly suggested that an unauthorized or impromptu jury had been formed and that the official judges had been excluded from the selection of finalists.”\nThey insisted that “no impromptu jury has been created” and that Miss Universe continues to “follow the established, transparent and supervised MUO protocols.”\nThe organization acknowledged Harfouch’s decision to resign as a judge, vowing that “all procedures remain governed by the organization’s highest standards of transparency, integrity and fairness.”",
