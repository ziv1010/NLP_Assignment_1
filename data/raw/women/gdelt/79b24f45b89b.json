  "body_text": "Strictly Come Dancing's Karen Carney on being her 'biggest critic' and why she retired at 31\nThe football legend is one of 15 stars taking part in this year's edition of Strictly\nStrictly Come Dancing’s Karen Carney is seeking to prove that she’s as good on the dancefloor as she is on the football pitch as she takes on the BBC series.\nKaren isn’t the only former football player competing on the 23rd season of Strictly, with Chelsea legend Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink also competing.\nFifteen stars from all walks of life will be shown competing on the pre-recorded launch show, which airs on BBC One on Saturday night (September 20).\nThe past few years have seen Karen focusing on her punditry, joining Sky Sports as lead Women's Super League pundit in 2021.\nKaren quickly turned her attention to covering the Lionesses on ITV, providing detailed analysis of their UEFA Women's Championship triumphs in 2022 and 2025.\nAlso commentating on Champions League matches for CBS Sports, Karen has been part of TNT Sports football broadcast team since the start of last season, covering both the men’s and women’s game.\nPreviously asked about if she believes she’s judged differently to her male pundit colleagues, Karen admitted she’s more focused on how she views herself.\nShe told PA news agency: “No, my biggest critic is me. I want to be the best that I can be. “It’s the same as when you’re a player. I know when I’ve done well and I know when I haven’t done well.\n“But as long as I’m well prepared, well informed, or as much as I can, it always gives you the best chance. I think my favourite part is doing the analysis, breaking down a game. But my attitude will never change to be the best that I can.\n“I write down often, how do I want to be portrayed in the media? And I want to try and be classy, well informed, really well prepared. And try and be the best that I can be. I still think I can get better and improve a lot.”\nDuring her playing days, Karen broke onto the scene when she made her debut for Birmingham City at the age of 14, going on to earn FA National Young Player of the Year honors in 2005 and 2006.\nThe midfielder went on to join Arsenal in 2006, where she won four major trophies in her first season, scoring 13 goals in 36 appearances.\nStaying at Arsenal until 2009, winning the FA Women's Premier League National Division three years in a row, Karen jetted off overseas to join Chicago Red Stars as part of the United States’ new professional league.\nTwo years later she was back in England playing for Birmingham City, with her highpoint lifting the FA Cup in 2012. Playing for her original team until 2015, Karen’s final move brought her to Chelsea, where she won the FA Cup for a fifth time in 2017.\nAs an international player, Karen was the second most capped England player of all time with 144 appearances, including reaching the UEFA Women's Championship final in 2009, which England lost, and at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, where the Lionesses came in third place.\nKaren stunned the football world in 2017 when she announced she was hanging up her boots as she didn’t think her body ‘could do it anymore’.\n“I think you’ve seen the level and the growth of the game and how fantastic it’s become and that’s a credit to everybody. And my mind would want me to continue until I’m 100, but there’s a time when your body says enough is enough and I think I’ve got to that point.\n“I remember reading a quote from Birgit Prinz, one of the greatest female players ever, and she said you keep going until you’ve got nothing else in the tank and I don’t think I have anymore. So I think that’s why the time is right for me. I’ve given my heart and soul for my clubs wherever I've played and especially my country.\n“I don’t think there’s anything more I could physically or mentally give and I have no regrets with how that has happened,” she said at the time.\nThe full list of celebrities taking part in Strictly this year is Emmerdale’s Lewis Cope, EastEnders actress Balvinder Sopal, former Love Island winner Dani Dyer, Gladiators’ Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, Doctor Who’s Alex Kingston, YouTuber George Clarke, drag queen La Voix, rugby legend Chris Robshaw, Chelsea legend Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, TV personality Thomas Skinner, former I’m A Celebrity winner Vicky Pattison, model Ellie Goldstein, Lorraine’s Ross King and Neighbours star Stefan Dennis.\nMeanwhile, the line-up of professional dancers for Strictly 2025 was announced back in June - with reigning champion Dianne Buswell, Vito Coppola, Amy Dowden, Johannes Radebe, Karen Hauer, Jowita Przytal and Aljaz Skorjaned among those confirmed.\nThey will be watched and scored by Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Anton Du Beke and head judge Shirley Ballas, with presenters Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman also returning.",
