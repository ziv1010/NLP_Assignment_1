I think of all three, this might be the one I’m most nervous about, though – just look at the names involved.”\nEmma Hayes and Vicky McClure will co-manage the team as singer Tom Grennan, Olympic winner Sir Mo Farah, comedian Alex Brooker, former footballer and TV presenter Gary Neville, coach Paul Scholes, commentator Eni Aluko and YouTuber Chunkz return.\nCorry said: “I’ve played some big gigs in my time – but this is going to be up there. I know the atmosphere at Old Trafford is going to be electric.”\nThey will face competition from runner Usain Bolt as captain, former striker Robbie Keane as coach, comedian Lee Mack, Dragons’ Den star Steven Bartlett and Love Island winner and presenter Kem Cetinay.\nMalone said: “Manchester – I’m coming home. Can’t believe Soccer Aid for UNICEF is in my home town this summer – big vibes. I’m going to smash it but will need everyone to come out if we’re to beat Bolt.\n“This might be a football match on the day – but the legacy we are creating for the world’s children is so much deeper. It’s massive.”\nLast year, £15 million was raised during the match at London Stadium – where Soccer Aid World XI won 4-1 on penalties.\nWorld XI is leading six to five wins over England since the charity match was co-founded by pop star Robbie Williams in 2006.\nSoccer Aid raises money to help give children all over the world an early start full of play.\nThe charity match is back to Manchester United’s Old Trafford on Sunday June 11.\nA family of four can attend the game for just £60 – buy your tickets at socceraid.org.uk/tickets.\nThe live show on ITV1, STV and ITVX will be hosted by Dermot O’Leary.",
