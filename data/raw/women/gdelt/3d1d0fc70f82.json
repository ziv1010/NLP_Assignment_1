  "body_text": "Remember when Graham Potter’s stock was so high it was widely regarded that he was a shoo-in to be the next England manager?\nAfter successful spells with Ostersund in Sweden then with Swansea and Brighton he replaced Thomas Tuchel at Chelsea in September 2022 and his footballing world started the crumble around him.\nHe had chiselled out a reputation for organising teams capable of playing fluid, attacking football while keeping possession and waiting for weaknesses to be exposed in the opposition’s defence but it didn’t go to plan at Stamford Bridge.\nHis first defeat was on his return to the Amex Stadium when the Seagulls won 4-1 and the Blues were then knocked out of the FA Cup in the third round when they were thumped 4-0 by Manchester City.\nFans became increasingly mutinous following defeat to bottom club Southampton and although Chelsea reached the Champions League quarter-finals by beating Borussia Dortmund, Potter was dismissed at the beginning of April after losing to Aston Villla with the Blues 11th in the table.\nDespite linked with numerous jobs he has remained unemployed since then but now could be the right time to dip his toes back into the managerial waters.\nPotter is 6/1 second favourite with with Bet Victor to be the next in charge at Leicester City, ironically on the brink of losing Carlos Maresca to Chelsea, but may not be keen on jumpstarting his career with a club expected to start the new Premier League campaign with a points deduction for breaching financial rules.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nMore appealing could be a second bash in charge at Brighton and he’s evens with Ladbrokes and Coral to return to the job vacated by Roberto De Zerbi.\nLeicester could do worse than appoint experienced David Moyes to help then stay in the top-flight and he’s a 10/1 option with Bet Victor.\nCarlos Corberan is the 9/4 favourite with Sky Bet after leading West Brom to the Championship play-offs, but Coventry boss Mark Robins could be the shrewder alternative if Moyes is not interested. He has worked wonders with the Sky Blues, fits the mould as a young, progressive forward thinker and is 8/1 with the same firm.\nRelegated Burnley are also looking for a new manager as Vincent Kompany is primed to take charge at Bayern Munich and they should start to rebuild by appointing former Nottingham Forest head coach Steve Cooper, who is 7/2 with Sky Bet, as his replacement.\nMore Trending\n• Scottie Scheffler has been taking the PGA Tour by storm this season, winning four titles including the Masters since the turn of the year, but his remarkable achievements pales compared to those of Nelly Korda in the women’s game. The world No.1 has triumphed in six out of seven tournaments she has competed in this year and her dominance is so great she could be the next woman to be handed an exemption to a PGA Tour event. In the meantime, the 25-year-old from Florida is not to be missed at 4/1 with Unibet to win this week’s US Open at the Lancaster Country Club in Philadelphia.\n• Naomi Osaka looks chilled and relaxed as she makes a welcome return to WTA circuit but her French Open fun will be short-lived as she meets red-hot defending champion Iga Swiatek in the second round of the women’s singles at Roland Garros. Swiatek should enjoy a comfortable victory and is 17/10 with BetMGM and multiple other firms to win by over 7.5 games. Elina Svitolina is evens with Sky Bet to beat Diane Parry in straight sets.\nMORE: Man Utd star told Erik ten Hag he did not want to play in FA Cup final before being withdrawn\nMORE: Chelsea sent message by Leicester City star over ‘exceptional’ Enzo Maresca",
