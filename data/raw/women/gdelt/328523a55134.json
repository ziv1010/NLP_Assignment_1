However, some of the best television series are those that are familiar, attracting a loyal fan base who are happy to revisit their comfort shows again and again. Though comfort shows can range across multiple genres, time periods, and mediums, they share one thing in common: each manages to keep something fresh for its viewers every time they choose to give it a re-watch.\nFor example, the hit sitcom Friends, varies its plot with each episode, as well as featuring exciting guest stars that interact with the main cast. Similarly, Darren Star's Sex and the City franchise is an easy choice, with each episode featuring a new set of love interests and entertaining antics from its leading ladies. It is these comfort shows that demonstrate the potent emotional power that a good story can have on its viewers, spreading joy through the screen.\n10 The Office (2005-2013)\nCreated by Greg Daniels, Ricky Gervais, & Stephen Merchant\n- Release Date\n- 2005 - 2013-00-00\n- Network\n- NBC\n- Showrunner\n- Greg Daniels\n- Directors\n- Greg Daniels, Paul Lieberstein, Paul Feig, Randall Einhorn, Ken Kwapis\n- Writers\n- Mindy Kaling, Paul Lieberstein, Michael Schur, Ricky Gervais, Greg Daniels, B.J. Novak\n- Franchise(s)\n- The Office\nCast\n-\nMichael Scott\n-\nDwight Schrute\n- Main Genre\n- Comedy\n- Creator(s)\n- Greg Daniels\n- Seasons\n- 9\n- Story By\n- Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant\nOne of the most famous comfort shows is undoubtedly The Office. This American remake of the original British sitcom satirizes the lives of workers at a paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania, led by an eccentric and zany boss, Michael Scott (Steve Carell). The Office is an easy watch to return to for multiple reasons. For one, the cast is made up of unique and entertaining characters whose interactions in the professional environment bring about a series of hilarious scenarios.\nThe Office is based off of the British series of the same name which aired in 2001, a few years before the American version. It starred Ricky Gervais as its lead, who helped to write this American adaptation.\nFor example, characters like Jim Halpet (John Krasinski), the \"straight man\" of the series, enters into a prank war with his combative co-worker, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Several romantic couples are heartwarming to watch for viewers, such as the relationship of Jim and his co-worker Pam (Jenna Fischer). Overall, The Office's ability to embrace humor in the mundane interactions of everyday corporate life, is what audiences find relatable and enjoyable to watch onscreen, no matter the occasion.\n9 Parks and Recreation (2009-2015)\nCreated by Greg Daniels & Michael Schur\n- Release Date\n- 2009 - 2015\n- Network\n- NBC\n- Showrunner\n- Michael Schur\n- Directors\n- Dean Holland, Ken Whittingham, Troy Miller, Craig Zisk, Morgan Sackett, Randall Einhorn, Michael Trim, Nicole Holofcener, Tristram Shapeero, Wendey Stanzler, Beth McCarthy-Miller, Jason Woliner, Charles McDougall, Daniel J. Goor, Nick Offerman, Tucker Gates, Alan Yang, Alex Hardcastle, Jorma Taccone, Seth Gordon, Adam Scott, David Rogers, Jaime Eliezer Karas, Jeffrey Blitz\n- Writers\n- Harris Wittels, Aisha Muharrar, Dave King, Katie Dippold, Joe Mande, Megan Amram, Matt Murray, Donick Cary, Mike Scully, Rachel Axler, Alexandra Rushfield, Chelsea Peretti, Matt Hubbard, Greg Levine, Sam Means, Jen Statsky, Emma Fletcher, Rachna Fruchbom, Emily Kapnek, Emily Spivey, Greg Daniels, Tucker Cawley, Nate DiMeo\nCast\n-\nLeslie Knope\n-\nTom Haverford\n- Seasons\n- 7\nMade by The Office creator Greg Daniels, Parks and Recreation is another popular comfort show that is replayed often, though it ended a decade ago. Parks and Recreation is a comedy about another workplace: a local government office in the small town of Pawnee, Indiana. Led by the ambitious Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), each day in the office is never boring. Other than Leslie Knope, the unlikely savior of Pawnee, there are several memorable leads and supporting characters who are highly enjoyable to watch onscreen, from party boy Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari) to Stoic libertarian, Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman).\nParks & Recreation also has a series of cute yet unlikely relationships that develop throughout the show, further hooking viewers who appreciate a romance, such as that of Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) and April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza). Ultimately, this sitcom grows with the characters, as they move up in both their positions in the government and their personal lives, making Parks and Recreation evergreen in the eyes of its fans.\n8 Schitt's Creek (2015-2020)\nCreated by Dan Levy & Eugene Levy\n- Seasons\n- 6\nFans of Eugene Levy's outlandish movies and character work will love Schitt's Creek, which stars both him and his son. This popular sitcom tells the story of a wealthy businessman, Johnny Rose, and his spoiled family, when they suddenly lose all of their wealth after being involved in a fraud scheme. As a result, they must move to a small town they own called Schitt's Creek, to start over. The situational comedy in Schitt's Creek is infectious, as the Rose's struggle to adapt to their humble new lifestyle as deeply wealthy and out-of-touch individuals who are essentially \"fish-out-of-water.\"\nHowever, the highly stylized humor and character design of the leads are what bring the show to life, from Alexis, the somewhat vapid party girl, to Moira Rose, the pretentious artist with a strange accent. The relationships in this show are central to the Rose family, and their development both individually, as people and together as a family who learn how to support one-another, is heartwarming to watch. Because of this, Schitt's Creeks is the perfect escape.\n7 Modern Family (2009-2020)\nCreated by Steven Levitan & Christopher Lloyd\n- Release Date\n- 2009 - 2020\n- Network\n- ABC\n- Showrunner\n- Christopher Lloyd, Steven Levitan\n- Directors\n- Gail Mancuso, Steven Levitan, Beth McCarthy-Miller, Jason Winer, Michael Spiller, James Alan Hensz, Fred Savage, Chris Koch, Jeffrey Walker, Ryan Case, Randall Einhorn, Eric Dean Seaton, Scott Ellis, Bryan Cranston, John Riggi, Julie Bowen, Ken Whittingham, Reginald Hudlin, Iwona Sapienza, Elaine Ko, Helena Lamb, Adam Shankman, Claire Scanlon, Dean Parisot\n- Writers\n- Becky Mann, Audra Sielaff, Bill Wrubel, Stephen Lloyd, Jon Pollack, Vali Chandrasekaran, Ben Karlin, Jack Burditt, Chuck Tatham, Andy Gordon, Christy Stratton, Cindy Chupack, Ilana Wernick, Kenny Schwartz, Rick Wiener, Joe Lawson, Jessica Poter, Carol Leifer, Emily Spivey, Jerry Collins, Dave Weasel\nCast\n-\nJay Pritchett\n-\nSofía VergaraGloria Delgado-Pritchett\n- Seasons\n- 11\nThe Roses aren't the only \"comfort\" family portrayed onscreen, since the Pritchetts and Dunphys are equally enjoyable in their sitcom, Modern Family. This long-running comedy tells the story of several related families, each with their own \"modern\" quirks and characteristics, who, despite differences, love and support one another. Modern Family is heartwarming at its core, full of familiar characters with realistic problems, who teach important life lessons through their many trials and tribulations. In fact, many of these leads are people who are likely to be recognizable in viewers' own families.\nThese include Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell), the fun-loving cracker of memorable quotes and dad jokes, or Jay Pritchett (Ed O'Neill), the grumpy grandfather with a heart of gold underneath. This show is unique in how members of all generations in the family are able to experience noticeable character growth, from the elder matriarchs/patriarchs, to the Pritchett and Dunphy children. In the end, Modern Family is the coming-of-age of a family, teaching lessons like acceptance, patience, and understanding, that are soothing to watch as a viewer and exciting as they move through different seasons of their lives.\n6 Gilmore Girls (2000-2007)\nCreated by Amy Sherman-Palladino\n- Release Date\n- 2000 - 2007-00-00\n- Network\n- The WB\n- Writers\n- Amy Sherman-Palladino\nAmy Sherman-Palladino's famous series, Gilmore Girls, is an uplifting watch for fans of the show. This series follows the lives of a mother-daughter duo, Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), a single mother in her 30s, and Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), an overachieving high school student, who navigate life lessons in the quaint town of Stars Hollow. Like many other slice-of-life stories, each episode and season in Gilmore Girls involves a new set of challenges and scenarios in the small town.\nBesides its adorable setting, Gilmore Girls is an enjoyable watch due to the close and loving relationship between Lorelai and Rory. Over the course of its many seasons, both women grow and change, but manage to foster a supportive relationship despite the strain on the family's situation and Rory's challenges as she comes of age. For example, over the course of the series, both Rory and Lorelai make a series of questionable parallel decisions in romance and in friendships. However, each teaches a lesson to viewers in a way that is meaningful and sincere.\n5 Ted Lasso (2020-Present)\nCreated by Brendan Hunt, Joe Kelly, & Bill Lawrence\n- Release Date\n- August 14, 2020\n- Showrunner\n- Bill Lawrence\n- Writers\n- Brendan Hunt, Joe Kelly, Bill Lawrence\nCast\n-\nTed Lasso\n-\nRebecca Welton\n- Seasons\n- 3\nThough Ted Lasso is relatively new, it has quickly become considered as one of the prime examples of a \"comfort show.\" The series follows college football coach, Ted Lasso (Jason Sudekis), when he chooses to take over as a coach for a premier soccer league, AFC Richmond, in London. As he navigates his new role, he forms relationships with his players, and Ted gives them important advice on sports as well as life. Few characters are as lovable as Ted, whose warmhearted, southern charm is directly in opposition to the colder disposition of his classic British associates and team members.\nTed often offers crucial advice to his new friends and co-workers, and maintains a sense of positivity and kindness in even the darkest of moments. For viewers at home, this alone is enough to keep them tuning in, especially when they are in need of cheering up. Romance is also mixed into the series, with sweet relationships with characters like Keeley (Juno Temple) and Roy (Brett Goldstein), that are easy to become invested in. Because of this, Ted Lasso is the ultimate comfort show.\n4 Friends (1994-2004)\nCreated by David Crane & Marta Kauffman\n- Release Date\n- 1994 - 2004\n- Network\n- NBC\n- Showrunner\n- Marta Kauffman\n- Directors\n- Kevin S. Bright, Gary Halvorson, Michael Lembeck, James Burrows, Gail Mancuso, Peter Bonerz, David Schwimmer, Robby Benson, Shelley Jensen, Terry Hughes, Dana De Vally Piazza, Alan Myerson, Pamela Fryman, Steve Zuckerman, Thomas Schlamme, Roger Christiansen, Sheldon Epps, Arlene Sanford, David Steinberg, Joe Regalbuto, Mary Kay Place, Paul Lazarus, Sam Simon, Todd Holland\n- Writers\n- Jeff Astrof, Mike Sikowitz, Brian Boyle, Patty Lin, Bill Lawrence, R. Lee Fleming Jr.\nCast\n-\nRachel Green\n-\nMonica Geller\n- Seasons\n- 10\n- Story By\n- Marta Kauffman\nFew series are as well-known for their fun moments as David Crane and Marta Kauffman's Friends. The show focuses on the lives of several late 20s and early 30s New Yorkers, who are close friends living in Manhattan together. Over the years, viewers witness the ups and downs, and challenges of each character as they navigate romance, friendship, and career decisions. Friends is a slice-of-life, varying greatly with the adventures each character faces in their everyday life in New York. Because of this, the plot line of Friends is highly relatable for watchers of a similar age.\nIn 2021, the Friends cast reunite for a special episode streamed on HBO Max, discussing never before behind-the-scenes secrets and stories.\nWitnessing Chandler's fears and anxiety in the dating world, or Rachel's struggle to find a fulfilling job, allows viewers to feel less lost in their own lives. Despite their many challenges, exciting romantic encounters and relationships blossom in each season, giving viewers another reason to become invested and return to certain episodes. Not to mention, Friends, was notorious for bringing on recognizable stars for special episodes, such as Julia Roberts, Denise Richards, and Brad Pitt, which added a fresh energy to each of their episodes.\n3 How I Met Your Mother (2005-2015)\nCreated by Carter Bays & Craig Thomas\n- Release Date\n- 2005 - 2014-00-00\n- Network\n- CBS\n- Showrunner\n- Craig Thomas\n- Directors\n- Michael J. Shea\n- Writers\n- Chris Harris, Stephen Lloyd, Joe Kelly, Robia Rashid, Greg Malins, Chris Marcil, Phil Lord, Sam Johnson, Tami Sagher, Gloria Calderon Kellett\nCast\n-\nTed Mosby\n-\nBarney Stinson\n- Seasons\n- 9\n- Story By\n- Carter Bays; Craig Thomas; Rob Greenberg\nFamously dubbed as one of the biggest \"comfort shows,\" How I Met Your Mother's story follows Ted (Josh Radnor), as he recounts his friendship in his late 20s and early 30s, and how this involved the eventual meeting of his children's mother. However, along the way, things become complicated as Ted falls for Robin (Cobie Smulders), one of his best friends. How I Met Your Mother, is as comedic as it is heart-wrenching at times, just like real life. Similar to other shows of its nature, this series is highly relatable, and so are its diverse characters.\n15 Most Iconic Phrases From How I Met Your Mother\nThanks to great Barney phrases, How I Met Your Mother became one of the most quotable sitcoms ever. But other characters have great catchphrases too.\nFor example, Barney's playboy personality, Robin's avoidant, independent nature, and Ted's identity as a hopeless romantic are recognizable in ourselves and those of friends. How I Met Your Mother is another day in the lives of its characters, and as a result, varies greatly with their antics. It's hard for the plot to become stale for viewers when one episode revolves around the wedding of their favorite relationship, Marshall and Lily, and another focuses on Barney's experience as a contestant on The Price Is Right. However, the lessons in love are what keep audiences tuning in even after a decade.\n2 Sex And The City (1998-2004)\nCreated by Darren Star\n- Release Date\n- 1998 - 2004-00-00\n- Network\n- HBO\n- Showrunner\n- Darren Star\n- Directors\n- Michael Patrick King, Allen Coulter, Michael Engler, Michael Spiller, Alan Taylor, Charles McDougall, David Frankel, John David Coles, Allison Anders, Tim Van Patten, Daniel Algrant, Nicole Holofcener, Pam Thomas, Susan Seidelman, Alison Maclean, Julian Farino, Martha Coolidge, Matthew Harrison, Michael Fields, Victoria Hochberg\n- Writers\n- Cindy Chupack, Jenny Bicks, Elisa Zuritsky, Julie Rottenberg, Allan Heinberg, Amy Harris, Nicole Avril, Terri Minsky, Alexa Junge, Aury Wallington, Becky Hartman Edwards, Jessica Bendinger, Judy Toll, Liz Tuccillo, Michael Green\nCast\n-\nKim CattrallSamantha Jones\n-\nSarah Jessica ParkerCarrie Bradshaw\n- Seasons\n- 6\n- Story By\n- Candace Bushnell\nSex and the City is one of the quintessential comfort shows of the 2000s, known for its escapism into the exciting lives of several New York socialites. Each woman navigates the struggles of love and relationships in the late '90s and early 2000s, learning to lean on one another for support. It is no surprise why Sex and the City is a frequent watch, even for those who have seen the series multiple times.\nThe series plays as a \"how-to\" guide on love and relationships, with each episode revolving around another lesson in Carrie's weekly sex column, bringing a new set of love interests and adventures. The characters are also another reason for the show's draw, since each woman is vastly unique in their own way, showing that there is no \"right\" way to approach dating. In the end, other than the fun and glam of Sex and the City, the series is a heartwarming story of the endurance of female friendship and platonic love, a message that is reassuring for fans.\n1 Fleabag (2016-2019)\nCreated by Phoebe Waller-Bridge\nThe short but sweet Phoebe Waller-Bridge dramatic comedy, Fleabag, is a return watch for many fans, though it only ran for two seasons with an infamously open ending. Fleabag is a hilariously witty series about Fleabag (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), a young woman in London who struggles to cope with both her troubles with sex addiction and grief over the loss of her best friend. Fleabag manages to be equally heartbreaking and hilarious, yet is a comforting watch for viewers who appreciate Phoebe's raw portrayal of Fleabag, an incredibly flawed but likable character.\nBesides its clever narration and Fleabag's hot-mess personality, the series finds itself in a unique set of laughable scenarios that are easily enjoyable for viewers. For example, Fleabag's attraction to Hot Priest (Andrew Scott), is a ridiculously ironic and challenging situation for the promiscuous lead, resulting in many farcical moments. Though Fleabag manages to involve herself in a new predicament each episode, her realistic character becomes a comforting presence, the audience acting as a quiet confidant and witness to her journey of self-discovery.",
