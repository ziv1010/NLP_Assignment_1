Johanna Kaneryd pulled Chelsea level soon after but her strike was scant consolation when Ilestedt headed past Ann-Katrin Berger, causing Blues manager Emma Hayes to roll her eyes on the touchline.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nRusso's double then put the game beyond Chelsea's reach, extending Arsenal's winning run to eight in all competitions. They next face Tottenham Hotspur in the FA WSL Cup and Chelsea host Swedish outfit BK Häcken in the Champions League.\nAlmost 25,000 tickets have already been sold for Manchester United's visit to the Emirates in February, Arsenal’s fastest-selling women’s fixture to date.\nMore women's football stories\nSpain beat England 1-0 in Sydney to win the Women's World Cup for the first time in their history.\nFIFA suspended Luis Rubiales over his unsolicited kiss on Jennifer Hermoso, with Spain threatening to pull out of UEFA. After mounting pressure, Rubiales later resigned in an interview with Piers Morgan.\nAlex Greenwood tells FourFourTwo that England have changed more mentality-wise than ability-wise, with manager Sarina Wiegman imperative to that – and Wiegman's success with the Lionesses has seen her linked with the England men's team as a possible successor to Gareth Southgate, with the FA saying she would be under consideration for the role.\nMeanwhile, Emma Hayes is leaving Chelsea at the end of the season and has opened up on the reasons behind her decision to quit Stamford Bridge.",
