  "body_text": "The Daily Merengue is a place where you can feel free to d all things football. Do not be alarmed by the overt RMCF bias. It’s in the name!\nGoldilocks Madrid: 14 November 2024\nThursday Edition of the Daily Merengue\nShoutout to the mods who do a fantastic job, Valyrian Steel, Felipejack, Juninho, NeRObutBlanco and yours truly, Kung_Fu_Zizou\nFinding Just The Right Stuff\nCarlo will have been relieved to go into the international break with a resounding victory over Osasuna at the Bernabeu. Carlo has yet to find his happy medium or balance this season. There’s still time and with Flick flickering over at the Spotify Stars, Carlo may very well get a long rope to get his team to gel. One has to wonder how so many of the same players can look so lost under the same manager they’ve been working with for years.\nToo slow\nOne of Carlo’s major complaints this season has been about the speed with which the team brings the ball forward.\nCarlo wants the ball to be played forward faster to take advantage of the speedy front men on the roster.\nIn a good game this works and looks brilliant. In a bad game, we up giving away cheap possession and suffering way more than we should against the most average opposition.\nToo fast\nPlaying top fast allows the opposition easy possession because it reduces accuracy and composure. We end up rushing our chances and half chances and it becomes difficult to judge because it looks like the team played well in attack.\nReal Madrid often lack composure in the final 3rd and waste many good positions despite the much-vaunted efficiency. Some composure is needed in the final 3rd and Carlo while having options in the squad is limited by his veneration of age and experience and the inevitable, ineffable vibes of Friendship FC.\nToo high\nCarlo has attempted to press high in order to adjust to the athletic midfielders at his disposal. Unfortunately for Carlo, he’s just not a manager who can successfully coach and implement an efficient pressing scheme. This is a manager problem, not a player problem.\nToo Deep\nGiven that Carlo cannot coach a decent press, the team has to often fall back and can end up being too deep launching predictable low percentage balls forward.\nSchrodinger’s Turtle\nKylian Mbappe is a world class player. He’s undoubtedly a generational talent. However, he’s also got his limitations. Despite being able to do just abiut everything at an elite level, he’s not learned how to bend his runs particularly as a number 9.\nHe’s also playing in new team with players he’s not used to and having to adapt quickly with his decision-making.\nHe needs to score goals on top of all that.\nIt’s not obvious what Carlo’s plan is but hopefully he’s been trying it out and it will come off during the second half of the reason.\nRight now Mbappe has shown glimpses of his brilliance but not the expected efficiency.\nMany have become increasingly frustrated with the Turtle’s underwhelming goal output. He’s been compared laughingly to Hazard, chided and derided.\nIn my estimation, the failure right now is on the manager. In future however, it will be up to Kylian to use his experience and more familiar surroundings to his advantage.\nTo his credit, Kylian has been down to Earth, maybe too humble for a galactico. He’s not moaned and he seems to have done whatever is being asked.",
