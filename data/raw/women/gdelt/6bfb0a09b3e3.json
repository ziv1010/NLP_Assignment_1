The official brand reflects the vision we share with our hosts: a joyful, impactful and truly Brazilian FIFA Women’s World Cup!”\nAt the heart of the brand reveal stood a powerful emblem inspired by the Brazilian flag and the geometry of the football pitch, crafted from the union of “W” (“women”, “world”) and “M” (from the equivalent Portuguese words mulheres and mundo). The design symbolises movement and mastery, while subtly paying homage to the national flag.\nThe GO EPIC™ slogan calls on fans everywhere to be part of an unforgettable adventure, while the tournament’s sonic identity, inspired by Brazilian rhythms, samba-infused percussion and Afro‑Brazilian heritage, brings the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2027 to life through sound, emotion and energy. The Sonic ID is available on various streaming platforms and on FIFA’s YouTube.\nThe launch ceremony brought together icons from the women’s and men’s game, symbolising the football family and a shared future for the sport.\nIn a video message, national hero and global icon Marta highlighted Brazil’s deep emotional connection to the beautiful game.\n“Football is about love and Brazil loves football. Our country is ready to embrace the women’s game with pride, emotion and belief. This tournament will create unforgettable stories and reveal new heroes, inspiring girls and boys, women and men, and making our love for the game grow even stronger.”\nLatest Stories\n-\n‘I wanted to be an architect but ended up as a nurse’ – Diana Hamilton reveals\n40 minutes -\nFrom wards to worship: Diana Hamilton reveals how nursing school shaped her destiny\n57 minutes -\nMahama demands binding deadlines for African reparations\n1 hour -\nThis is not the time to settle political scores – Bawumia to government\n3 hours -\n5 definitive Valentine’s Day gifts to win your lover’s heart in Ghana\n3 hours -\n37% of SHS students exposed to drugs – Opare-Addo\n3 hours -\nNLC secures court injunction against striking tertiary unions\n4 hours -\nOSP says it remains guided by law after INTERPOL deletes Ofori-Atta’s Red Notice\n4 hours -\nWaiting in the Ring: life inside Bukom’s halted boxing scene\n4 hours -\nRed Notice cancellation: OSP official fires back at Ofori-Atta’s lawyers\n4 hours -\nOfori-Atta saga: Red Notice ends after arrest – OSP official clarifies\n5 hours -\nAAG raises alarm over billboard demolitions, calls for presidential intervention\n5 hours -\nHealth Minister to chair probe into ‘No Bed Syndrome’ death; promises system overhaul\n6 hours -\nPrime Insight to tackle ‘galamsey tax’ debate, cocoa reforms and Ayawaso East fallout this Saturday\n6 hours -\nCocoa crisis, galamsey complicity and election credibility to dominate this Saturday’s Newsfile\n7 hours",
