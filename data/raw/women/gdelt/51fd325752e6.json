  "body_text": "Kisped Queens firmly in WPL despite walkovers, coach blames fixture congestion\nAudio By Vocalize\nKisped Queens head coach Daniel Minjis has insisted the club\nis still firmly part of the Football Kenya Federation Women’s Premier League (FKF-WPL) despite forfeiting two consecutive matches.\nThe struggling side recently failed to honour fixtures\nagainst Kenya Police Bullets and Kibera Soccer Women, handing their opponents\nwalkover victories and slipping to 11th place on the league table—just one\nposition above the relegation zone.\nSpeaking to Citizen Digital, Minjis remained upbeat about\nthe team’s survival chances, expressing confidence that Kisped Queens can turn\ntheir season around in the second leg, where most of their fixtures will be\nplayed at home.\n“We are still in the league despite dishing out two\nwalkovers,” said Minjis. “The second round will be a bit easier because most of\nthe matches will be home games. We also plan to strengthen the squad because\nthere is a lot of fatigue.”\nThe coach revealed that the club intends to recruit new\nplayers during the mid-season transfer window to boost performances and avoid\nrelegation.\nHowever, Minjis blamed the club’s recent struggles on what\nhe termed an unfavorable fixture schedule prepared by the Football Kenya\nFederation, saying a run of long-distance away matches stretched the team’s\nlimited finances and left players exhausted.\n“It has not been easy this season because of travelling long\ndistances and closely scheduled fixtures,” he explained. “The management\nappealed to the federation, but the response was not positive.”\nAs a result, Kisped Queens were forced to forfeit the\nmatches, handing automatic wins to their opponents. League rules now place the\nclub under pressure, with the risk of relegation looming should they fail to\nhonour a third consecutive fixture.\nWith the stakes high, Minjis says the focus is now on reorganization, squad reinforcement and maximizing upcoming home matches to secure the club’s top-flight status.",
