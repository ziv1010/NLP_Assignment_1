I am very positive that they will have a good outcome.\n“I am very hopeful. I am very positive, because I think the environment has been good. The way that they have been talking to each other has been really good.\n“They just need a little more time. I think just take the time and get some solutions. People who are involved, the FA and players, are in good communication.”",
