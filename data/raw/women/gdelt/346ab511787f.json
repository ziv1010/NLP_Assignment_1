  "body_text": "‘Look,’ Daniel Brühl says, ‘I’ll show you.’ In a poky kitchenette above a photo studio in west London, Brühl screeches backwards in his chair, stands up, takes a step to one side, then keeps rising until slightly on the balls of his feet. Puffing his chest out, he arches his spine before drawing his arms up into a hold, as if ready for the flamenco. He stiffens his neck; he purses his lips. And all of a sudden, by some strange magic, there he is in the room: Karl Lagerfeld. Acting, eh?\nAnybody tasked with playing a real person faces the same broad challenge: how to pull it off without falling into caricature. It’s why, a couple of years ago, when Brühl received a call confirming he’d be playing Lagerfeld, the late, exalted German fashion doyen, in a new six-part Disney+ series, Becoming Karl Lagerfeld, his first reaction after calmly putting the phone down was to break into wide-eyed panic. ‘I went, F--k. How do I do it?! Because the danger is it becomes a mere copy. So you need to make it individual while living with people going, “No, no, no, he wasn’t like that…”’\nThat’s true for any actor, whether they’re playing the Pope or Marilyn Monroe, but Brühl faced a particular additional hurdle. That despite being the subject of dozens of books and documentaries, despite working all over the world until well into his ninth decade, and despite dying so recently – in 2019, aged 85 – that even his cat is alive (and thriving), hardly anybody still around who met Karl Lagerfeld truly knew him. Which was exactly how Lagerfeld liked it.",
