  "body_text": "Historic! Rebecca Welch To Become Premier League's First Female Referee During Fulham Vs Burnley Clash\nThe Football Association outlined plans in July to increase the recruitment of referees from \"historically under-represented\" backgrounds by 50% by 2026. This initiative targets a significant rise in the number of women referees and black or Asian referees across all football levels within three years. Currently, 8% of officials are of black or Asian ethnicity, with only 3% in professional football. Sam Allison, a former firefighter, achieved promotion to the Football League in 2020 and moved up to the Championship earlier this year, advocating for more officials from under-represented backgrounds.\nRebecca Welch, in addition to her historic Premier League role, has officiated in the Championship, the Women's Super League, and the Women's Champions League this year. Her diverse experience also extends to refereeing matches at the Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand during the summer. In 2022, she made history by becoming the first woman to take charge of an FA Cup third-round tie, solidifying her presence on the EFL's national list for men's football, which oversees League One and League Two fixtures. Welch's journey in the Premier League began in November when she served as the first woman involved in a refereeing capacity during Manchester United's 1-0 victory over Fulham at Craven Cottage.\nAlso Read:\nLast Over Drama: Jitesh Sharma gets hit-wicket in the 3rd T20I Between South Africa and India\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
