  "body_text": "Leah Williamson was disappointed with our goalless draw at home to Manchester United on Saturday, and feels there are lessons to learn from it.\nWe dominated possession at Emirates Stadium but were unable to find a way through as the points were shared in the Barclays Women’s Super League.\n“It’s disappointing,” Leah said. “We played some good football I thought but no end product in terms of a goal so there’s learnings, we’re fuelled by it. We come up against them again very soon.\n“It’s not what we wanted but we don’t stop, we keep moving. That’s the strong mentality of this team, I think that’s what can set us apart at times so we need that to kick in now.”\nWhilst there were no goals for us to celebrate, the absence of a United goal was in no small part due to Anneke Borbe’s brilliant fifth-minute stop to deny Fridolina Rolfo.\n“A quality save and I think even in games like that though, you know I’ve seen results turn and when you’re so dominant and you’re against a good team, it swings the other way,”Leah added. “But she was ready and kept us moving, she set the tone for us. So yeah, she’s been great.”\nWe also asked Leah what she’s made of Smilla Holmberg so far, who signed for us this week and looked lively when she came on late in the second half.\n“She’s a really great addition to the squad,” she said. “She’s been great in training this week. She’s a really disciplined hard-working player, so I think there’s a lot of respect there, already earned, amongst her teammates and she’s been doing some great things in training.\n“I’ve enjoyed playing with her. Look at the way she attacked the game today. She’s young, it’s a big club and a big occasion and no fear in her eyes.”\nFor Leah, this match represented the first time she’s been back playing at the Emirates Stadium since recovering from injury, and our defender is now feeling back to her best.\n“It’s been really nice to have a good week of training,” she explained. “We have a busy schedule because we’ve been successful and we’re in a lot of competitions, but it doesn’t leave much time for training.\n“So it’s been nice, the team has really benefitted from a week together, another week coming up and hopefully as I felt today, I hope I feel ten times better next week.”\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
