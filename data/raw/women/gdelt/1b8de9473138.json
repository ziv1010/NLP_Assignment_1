  "body_text": "Letters: It’s true we don’t talk enough about grief in Ireland, so I’m sharing my story\nMadam — My heart goes out to your correspondent Brian McDevitt, who wrote so movingly about the death of his wife two years ago (Letters, October 26).\nMy husband died four years ago and the grief was horrendous, so I know what you are going through, Brian.\nIt can be difficult to want to carry on living, but you will, and life will have some meaning again.\nMost people won’t understand why you aren’t over the worst of your grief after two years, but it is early days yet.\nOf course, you will never forget your wife on all those special anniversaries and special days, and she will be for ever in your heart.\nI find prayer helps, and your precious memories will help you heal.\nIt’s true what you say — we in Ireland do not talk enough about grief. We are great at wakes and funerals, then people stop getting in touch after a month, believing everything is done and dusted.\nIt’s four years since my beloved Peter passed away, and not a day goes by that I don’t think of that wonderful man.\nIt’s not as chaotic and crazy as those first days, weeks and months, but it’s still painful and I miss him so much.\nWe married in 2014; he was 83 and I was 64. I had to kiss a lot of frogs before I met Commandant Peter Riordan. I had a colourful and wonderful life; he was the icing on the cake.\nPeter was an officer and a gentleman and the kindest, most loving and good-humoured man in the world.\nHe was Carer of the Year in 2012/2013. He dedicated himself to looking after his two sons, Ronan (49), who has Down syndrome, and his late son Bernard, who was brain-damaged after being hit by a drink-driver.\nSince Peter’s death, I have been caring for Ronan and Edward, my foster son of 30 years, partially blind, intellectually impaired and insulin-dependent. They bring me such joy. And I have found great strength in Jesus.\nThings will get better for you, Brian. When we were younger, image was important, but as we age it’s in the heart that matters and your wife will always be in yours. Some day you will meet her again.\nTerry Healy Riordan, Kill Village, Co Kildare\nConnolly victory gives me hope for the future\nMadam — The election of Catherine Connolly as the 10th president of Ireland mirrors in tone and substance the marriage equality referendum of 2015.\nThis was even reflected in the final winning percentage in what was a binary choice between a pro-establishment, continue-as-you-were candidate and one with a bold new vision of hope and inclusiveness amplified by young people through social media.\nIt would be a mistake to think that Connolly’s landslide victory does not have implications for the next general election.\nOne can almost picture the scenario, with one side offering a vision of a new, 32-county republic, embracing our native language, maintaining our military neutrality while being pro-Palestine and pro-Ukraine and instituting a constitutional right to housing.\nOn the other side, the usual scare tactics from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, warning that the “hard” left will take your money and multinationals will withdraw to more politically safe havens. Those parties will hope that middle Ireland will do its civic duty, as it has always done, and vote them back in.\nIf this seems far-fetched, consider that polls predict New York, the richest city in the world, is about to elect as mayor a Ugandan-born Muslim who is pro-Palestine and would arrest Benjamin Netanyahu should he set foot on his territory. He advocates “democratic socialist” policies on taxing the rich to bring about a more just and equal society.\nNot for nothing does Lorcan Nyhan point out the similarities between Connolly and Zohran Mamdani’s campaigns (‘Connolly campaign knew how to feed the meme machine’, October 26).\nTom McElligott, Tournageehy, Co Kerry\nPresidency should be a unifying role\nMadam — We ended up voting for the least-worst candidate, not the best.\nThe campaigns by all candidates were extremely disappointing. Instead of vision and inclusiveness, we got negativity: debates dominated by neutrality, foreign policy, banking ties and personal histories — none of which fall within the president’s remit.\nThe presidency should be a symbolic, unifying role, to be held by someone who embodies Irish values and represents us with dignity abroad. None of the candidates displayed a passion for this, nor did they indicate how they would do it.\nWhat was most striking was the absence of a céad míle fáilte, of Irish compassion and fairness. Heather Humphreys’ campaign felt scripted and combative. Catherine Connolly’s win was based on rejection of the political status quo.\nThe campaigns were so poor that our only consolation is that, from a presidential perspective, we can only hope things will get better.\nKieran Burns, Wexford\nBrendan’s right — the lawyers always win\nMadam — Reading Brendan O’Connor’s observation that lawyers now run most countries, I realise I may have missed my vocation (‘Annoyed by the result? You need to move on’, October 26).\nIt turns out All-Ireland titles are won by teachers, power is wielded by lawyers — and I, as a teacher who couldn’t kick snow off a rope, chose the wrong side of the draw entirely.\nO’Connor is right to say we need to move on from “authenticity”, from what-ifs and heroic fantasies. The electorate did not vote on policies — they voted on vibes. Catherine Connolly had the right frequency.\nMy prediction? Within 10 years, our elections will no longer feature manifestos at all — just carefully calibrated vibe releases. AI will be hired not to write speeches, but to forecast national mood swings, hour by hour. And still the lawyers will win.\nEnda Cullen, Tullysaran, Co Armagh\nHeather won more votes than FG did\nMadam — I usually find Brendan O’Connor’s columns to be very balanced, but I must take issue with his suggestion last week that Heather Humphreys might as well have stayed at home.\nFirst, she quickly took up the battle for Fine Gael at short notice when Mairead McGuinness withdrew.\nSecond, she increased the Fine Gael share of the vote on the general election, despite all the complications — not least the entire opposition throwing their weight behind Catherine Connolly, and Ivan Yeats’s stupid and uncalled-for intervention about a smear campaign.\nMaeve Burke, Abbey, Loughrea, Co Galway\nPut a helmet on that presidential head\nMadam — Congratulations to Catherine Connolly. However, now is not the time to lose the head... literally.\nPlease, president-elect, invest in a cycle helmet. Last Friday and Saturday you appeared on the RTÉ News and in last weekend’s Sunday Independent minus a helmet. You are a role model now.\nMargaret Coughlan, Cork\n‘Working people’ can join protests too\nMadam — Eilis O’Hanlon wrote in last week’s paper that left-wing parties are “retreating into posturing over progressive causes such as abortion, trans rights, same-sex marriage, anti- racism, diversity and inclusion while becoming ever more distant from the concerns of actual working people” (‘We’ve had 14 years of a John Lennon presidency. Now along comes Yoko’, October 26).\nWhat really bothers me is that this statement implies that people who belong to any of these groups are not also “actual working people”, as if they didn’t encounter their specific challenges on top of the problems that all other working people have to deal with.\nMelanie Rabie, Edenderry, Co Offaly\nEilis should lay off the hippy-bashing\nMadam — Is it fair to bring, as Eilis O’Hanlon does, John Lennon and Yoko Ono into her socialist/hippy-bashing? Imagine if we could only see the person and not their ideology — would we be so hurtful?\nI wish our new uachtarán, well and I hope she speaks out when necessary from the Áras, especially if Russian or Israeli drones and missiles are raining down on innocent children.\nMaybe we will hear the sound of Woman wafting from the Áras, or perhaps Give Peace a Chance.\nAidan Roddy, Cabinteely, Dublin\nThey think it’s all over... it is now\nMadam — The presidential election was to be a game- changer, though nobody said which game. Conor McGregor received a KO in the dressing room. Bertie Ahern couldn’t get a match ticket, even from the Dublin Fianna Fáil touts. Maria Steen received her red card before canvassing. She was also in a minor scuffle, but it was only “handbag” stuff.\nJim Gavin took a self-administered yellow card, but was still in the match programme. Heather Humphreys tried to avoid the Orange card. Mary Lou McDonald was unable to find a player who showed enough in the training sessions.\nLess than half of ticket-holders bothered to attend the game. More than 200,000 who did never took their seats and wouldn’t cheer for either team.\nThe only serious player left was the left-winger, and that’s how she won.\nSeán Kelly, Tramore, Co Waterford\nCoffee cup litter levy better late than never\nMadam — I read with more than passing interest Wayne O’Connor’s article about coffee cups (‘Cafe owners hit back at proposals to put new “latte levy” back on industry’, October 26).\nFor many years, volunteers have spent countless hours walking the roads of Ireland picking up litter, seeking neither praise nor gain. All they wanted was the right to live in an environment free from unsightly and sometimes unhealthy rubbish. They realise a clean neighbourhood enriches the lives of locals and passersby.\nThe most prevalent item of litter collected in recent years has undoubtedly been the paper coffee cup.\nIn an effort to help reduce the number of dumped cups, Killarney introduced a ban on single-use paper cups two years ago. This was predicated on the promised “latte levy” — an extra charge on single-use cups — becoming a reality. Sadly, that commitment has not been honoured, so some coffee outlets feel betrayed.\nFearghal Carroll, the chairman of the Irish Paper Packaging Circularity Alliance, talks in the article of the difficulty of finding recycling bins “walking through the streets in Ireland”. This is about the roads, major and minor, of rural Ireland where most of the used cups appear to be discarded.\nIt is time for the Government to keep its promise and show respect for people and place.\nMichael Gleeson, Clasheen, Killarney, Co Kerry\nRTÉ is squandering taxpayers’ money\nMadam — RTÉ was in the headlines last week with new revelations about staff payments — just when we thought we had heard everything about the salaries, barter accounts, expenses, pensions and perks there.\nIt described these newly disclosed payments as “income replacement payments” designed to bridge a gap between employees’ salaries on taking voluntary redundancy and receiving a pension at the age of 65. No other organisation would offer such payments.\nMaybe it’s time to revisit the whole concept of a taxpayer-subsidised national broadcaster and give the support to commercial stations instead.\nBrian Lube, Co Meath\nTime to get tough on homophobic thugs\nMadam — Last Sunday’s unprovoked attack on two drag performers in Oliver Plunkett Street, Cork, is an awful example of the degree of danger LGBTQ+ people face.\nPenalties for those who are persecuted and assaulted by fundamentalists, homophobic sociopaths or thugs for having a different lifestyle must be sanctioned in such a way as to cause deterrence.\nIn time, we may even have to impose mandatory long sentences for attacks motivated by those who believe LGBTQ+ people are second-class citizens and have subordinate rights.\nSanctions should also involve heavy criminal fines that hurt their pockets or employment to keep everybody safe.\nMaurice Fitzgerald, Shanbally, Co Cork\nEU is escalating our hate-speech issue\nMadam — The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) reported last week that it “regrets” that part 2 of the Criminal Justice (Hate Offences) Bill 2022 was “removed” and “recommends… legislative measures aimed at specifying and clearly defining in criminal law expressions of hate speech”.\nThe ECRI is an institution within the Council of Europe, which was instrumental in creating the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). In short, although the recommendations of the ECRI are not legally binding, they are based on ECHR law.\nRecently, Justice Minister Jim O’Callaghan told the Dáil he was “fairly satisfied” Ireland had transposed the provisions of the EU directive on combating racism and xenophobia. The EU made it clear in May that it disagrees with this view.\nThe ECRI report now makes it more likely that the commission will escalate matters by taking Ireland to the Court of Justice of the EU. This court will consider not only the directive, but also relevant ECHR case law, hence the importance of the ECRI intervention. There will be new hate speech legislation. The Government just doesn’t wish to admit it.\nAndy Hales, Kenmare, Co Kerry\nMartin lets the side down with own-goal\nMadam — Micheál Martin Jr is an excellent Gaelic football goalkeeper and has been the number one choice for Cork for the past several years.\nI doubt he will ever concede such an own-goal as his father, the Taoiseach, did when he did not back his fellow Corkonian Billy Kelleher for the Fianna Fáil presidential nomination.\nPaddy Pigott, Co Laois\nAontú disgrace was easy to see coming\nMadam — I cannot begin to tell you how surprised I was to discover young men who send racist and bigoted messages might be attracted to a party set up by people who believe women have too many rights (‘Welcome to the Hitler Youth: Aontú fires its youth leader and five others over racist WhatsApp group’, October 26).\nBernie Linnane, Dromahair, Co Leitrim",
