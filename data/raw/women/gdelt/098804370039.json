Sven Isaksson of Stockholm University and his colleagues detected traces of poison in residues on five quartz arrowheads recovered from South Africa’s Umhlatuzana rock shelter, which was excavated in 1985. The toxin, called buphandrine, would have weakened prey, thus reducing the length of time and amount of energy expended on the hunt. The toxin epibuphanisine was detected on just one of the arrowheads, but both toxins had probably been applied to all of the weapons, Isaksson said. They may have even been... -\n5,000-Year-Old Evidence of Whaling Found in Brazil\nAccording to a statement released by the Autonomous University of Barcelona, people living some 5,000 years ago in the Babitonga Bay area on the southern coast of Brazil hunted whales. An international team of researchers led by Krista McGrath and André Colonese of the Autonomous University of Barcelona analyzed whale bones and bone tools recovered from sambaquis, or shell mounds, in Babitonga Bay. These artifacts are now housed at the Archaeological Museum of Sambaqui of Joinville. The researchers identified the remains of southern right whales, humpback whales, blue whales, sei whales, sperm whales, and dolphins in the collection. Many of... -\nDecember core consumer prices rose at a 2.6% annual rate, less than expected\nCore U.S. consumer prices rose less than predicted in December, reinforcing hopes that inflation is tempering as the Federal Reserve contemplates its next move on interest rates. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the consumer price index showed a seasonally adjusted 0.2% gain on a monthly basis and 2.6% annually, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday. Both were 0.1 percentage point below expectations. Though they look at both measures, Fed officials consider core inflation a better long-run gauge of where inflation is heading. On a headline basis, the CPI posted an increase of 0.3% for the month, putting the... -\nEuropean Union Officials Lean Toward Negotiating, Not Retaliating, Over Trump Tariff Threat\nSNIP While many European leaders are still hoping they might be able to talk things out, discussions have essentially been futile so far. Europe has been hesitant to retaliate against the United States, in part because it relies on America for military technologies and support for NATO. But Brando Benifei, a member of the European Parliament and the chair of its delegation for U.S. relations, said that calculus may be shifting, in part because popular opinion in Europe has turned more critical of the U.S. “A lot of people are saying that we are clearly over a red line,” he... -\nSenate takes recess, leaving only five days to pass six govt funding bills\nU.S. senators have left town for a week-long recess, leaving themselves only five days to pass the six remaining federal government funding bills. Four of those massive bills, which are also the thorniest, have not even passed the lower chamber, though House leaders hope to advance them in a package next week while the Senate is off. If Congress fails to meet the deadline – which many, including the National Governors Association, anticipate – they face a partial government shutdown. In that instance, the only way lawmakers could prevent a shutdown would be by punting the deadline via a Continuing... -\nMamdani chief equity officer disparaged liberal white women in now-deleted X posts: ‘Tax them to the white meat’\nMayor Mamdani’s new chief equity officer disparaged liberal white women in numerous posts on an X account deleted shortly before her appointment — and just as another aide landed in hot water for her radical screeds, The Post has learned. The city’s new equity officer, Afua Atta-Mensah liberally sprinkled the phrase “comrade” throughout her posts and retweeting statements such as, “there’s NO moderate way to black liberation.”Mamdani — in appointing Atta-Mensah to the top city position designed to promote inclusion — said, “There is no one I trust more to advance racial equity across our work in City Hall.”Atta-Mensah’s disturbing... -\nAMERICA Prayer Vigil 1/19/25 {Prayer}\nJoin together with Fellow FREEPERS to Pray for AMERICA: For those in Authority in Government, Family, Military, Business, Healthcare, Education, Churches, and the Media.'I Urge, then, First of All, that Requests, Prayers, Intercession and Thanksgiving be Made for Everyone: for Kings and All those in Authority that we May Live Peaceful and Quiet Lives in All Godliness and Holiness.' 1 Timothy 2:1-2Religion Forum Threads Labeled [Prayer] are Closed to Debate of Any Kind.1Peter 5:11To Him be Glory and Dominion Forever and Ever, amen. -\nFReeper Canteen ~ Hall of Heroes: Harold O Messerschmidt ~ 19 January 2026\nFor the freedom you enjoyed yesterday...

(AP) — A small part of Florida is the Snowy State for the second year in a row.Snow briefly covered the grass and rooftops in parts of the western Florida Panhandle on Sunday morning as just enough frigid air rushed in behind a cold front to turn the last rain showers into snowflakes in the Sunshine State.Elsewhere, the winter weather promised to interfere with playoff football in places — Boston and Chicago — more accustomed to it, although the visiting teams come from warmer climes. And in the upper Midwest, residents braced for blizzard conditions.The southern snow wasn’t... -\nPM to give No 10 speech over Greenland row\nThe prime minister will take to the Downing Street lectern this morning, after another extraordinary weekend of diplomatic turmoil prompted by US President Donald Trump. Sir Keir Starmer knows that people and businesses in the UK will expect him to respond, in front of the cameras, to the prospect of the UK and European allies being hammered by more US tariffs.

Trump has said he will impose new taxes on eight US allies - Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the... -\nSurging billionaire wealth a political threat, Oxfam warns as Davos opens\nDavos (Switzerland) (AFP) – The collective wealth of the planet's billionaires soared to a record level in 2025, charity Oxfam reported Monday, warning of \"highly dangerous\" political consequences as the global elite gathers for the World Economic Forum. US President Donald Trump's policies in particular spurred the fortunes of the ultra-rich, which jumped 16.2 percent in the first year of his second term to $18.3 trillion, the NGO said in a report released each year ahead of the Davos forum. \"Actions of the Trump presidency including the championing of deregulation and undermining agreements to increase corporate taxation have benefited the... -\nNobel Foundation speaks out after Machado gifts Trump Peace Prize\nThe Nobel Foundation, the group responsible for administrating the various Nobel prizes, on Sunday issued a clarification around the rules for handing out the prizes after Venezuela‘s opposition leader María Corina Machado offered her peace prize to President Donald Trump, which he accepted. “The Foundation upholds Alfred Nobel’s will and its stipulations,” the foundation wrote in a statement posted to X on Sunday. “It states that the prizes shall be awarded to those who ‘have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind,’ and it specifies who has the right to award each respective prize.” “A prize can therefore not, even symbolically,... -\n‘Kamala Harris Day’ sparks mockery after former VP accepts honor: ‘Name one accomplishment’\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris was met with mockery after she accepted the key to the city of Jackson, Mississippi, where the mayor also declared last Wednesday “Kamala Harris Day,” in honor of her many “accomplishments.” The former Democratic presidential candidate, who is rumored to be mulling a second try at the Oval Office, was in the Magnolia State as part of a mammoth book tour promoting her memoir, “107 Days,” when she was honored by Jackson’s Mayor John Horhn (D). “Kamala, you don’t know what you mean to Jackson, Mississippi. You don’t know what you mean to Mississippi. You... -\nTrump Administration Delivers Funds for Border Security: $1.7 Billion To New Mexico Wall (Bootheel)\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has awarded a nearly $1.7 billion contract to construct vital border barriers and advanced “smart wall” technology in New Mexico’s remote Bootheel region. Announced by U.S. Customs and Border Protection on January 6, 2026, the $1,679,170,000 award went to Fisher Sand and Gravel Co. (parent of Fisher Industries) for 49 miles of primary border wall and 60 miles of secondary barriers in Hidalgo County, between Border Monuments 1 and 49. The project includes patrol roads, cameras, sensors, and detection systems—creating a layered, high-tech deterrent against illegal crossings, drug trafficking, and threats to national security. -\nEurope warns of 'dangerous downward spiral' after Trump threatens tariffs over Greenland\nBERLIN (AP) — The eight European countries targeted by U.S. President Donald Trump for a 10% tariff for opposing American control of Greenland blasted the move Sunday, warning that his threats “undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”The joint statement by some of America’s closest allies signaled a possible turning point in the recent tensions over sovereignty and security nearly 24 hours after Trump’s threat.It was also the most forceful rebuke of Trump from the European allies since he returned to the White House almost a year ago. In recent months, Europeans have mostly opted for diplomacy and... -\nMore Protestant churches closing than opening in America as older congregations struggle: study\n4,000 churches closed in 2024, while only 3,800 were started, Lifeway Research reports. More Protestant churches are being closed in America than are being planted, and older congregations appear to be bearing the brunt of the contraction, according to data from a new Lifeway Research study.The study published Tuesday used data collected from 35 denominational groups that represent 58% of U.S. Protestant churches. The Tennessee-based research arm of Lifeway Christian Resources also cited information from the Annual Church Profile for 2023 and 2024 of the Southern Baptist Convention — America’s largest Protestant denomination.While 4,000 Protestant churches were closed in 2024,... -\nTrump Refuses to Rule Out Leaving NATO Over Greenland Tussle—Can He Legally Do That?\nAfter talks between the Greenland and Denmark foreign ministers and U.S. officials on Wednesday yielded no results, President Donald Trump was met with questions as to what his next steps might be. Talking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump—who continues to ramp up pressure on Greenland in his desire to annex the territory—refused to rule out the option of leaving NATO. “Greenland is very important for the national security,” said Trump, doubling down on his argument about the 0Kingdom of Denmark territory. He went on to say the U.S. “cannot rely on Denmark” to protect Greenland from Russian and... -\nA Higher-Ed Experiment in the Desert\nAs America enters an era that will seemingly be dominated by artificial intelligence (AI), many question the value of a college education. John Adams College (JAC), a recently founded liberal-arts institution in Provo, Utah, answers the value question by specializing in teaching uniquely human qualities. JAC, formerly Mount Liberty College, was founded in 2019 by professors who were discontented with the college status quo. Tired of college being treated as mere career training, they built a new institution from scratch, dedicated to “preparing men and women to enter the world defending liberty, standing in humility, and upholding virtue.” JAC offers... -\n[Catholic Caucus] Consistory Done Like Middle School - Leo XIV Is Responsible\n[Catholic Caucus] Consistory Done Like Middle School - Leo XIV Is ResponsibleJournalists Raymond Arroyo and Robert Royal, and canon lawyer and priest Gerald Murray of New York talked on January 16 about the consistory of January 7-8.
