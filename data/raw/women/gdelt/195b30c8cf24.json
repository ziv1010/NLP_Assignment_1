He said: \"I was keen to meet with the Ministers whose brief has a direct impact on my role of growing our economy. I wanted to reflect some of the immediate challenges we face and to ask for a constructive partnership approach to overcome these.\"\nThe Minister met with Seema Malhotra MP, Home Office Minister for Migration and Citizenship, regarding the ETA Scheme and to press for solutions to protect the north’s tourism industry. Commenting on the discussion, he said:\n\"The introduction and planned rollout of the ETA Scheme is consistently raised with me. Our all-island economy is vital, and seamless all-island travel is key to building on the growth we have seen in our tourism sector. The strong concerns expressed by the tourism and travel industry in the north and its potential impact on our tourism product and our wider economy, are concerns that I share.\n\"I reiterated these concerns to Minister Malhotra and outlined that this is an issue where I believe solutions are needed to protect our tourism, travel and hospitality sector in the north, especially as these businesses are facing a range of challenges such as rising energy and staff costs including additional impacts from the British Government’s recent Budget.\"\nMinister Murphy also met with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero Minister of State, Lord Phillip Hunt, to discuss his support for offshore wind projects across the north. He said:\n\"Offshore development will play a key role in delivering on net zero targets. It also offers huge economic opportunities for our region.\n\"I sought assurances from Minister Hunt that he will support us in gaining final agreement on the locations to allow us to develop offshore renewable energy projects as a matter of urgency. Failure to deliver offshore investment would be very damaging to the economy in the north and in the delivery of the region’s net zero legislative commitments.\"\nAfter a meeting on Investment Zones with Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Democracy and Local Growth Alex Norris MP, the Minister said: \"I welcome confirmation of Enhanced Investment Zone £150million funding. This will provide increased opportunities for the north to invest in new technologies that will enhance its cost competitiveness and first-class reputation for innovation.\"\nHe also raised with Minister Norris the importance of ensuring that the Shared Prosperity Funding (SPF) that goes towards the Go Succeed service is maintained. He added:\n\"Following the budget statement, the immediate reduced level of SPF funding is a concern for a range of sectors in the North. Go Succeed is an integral element of SPF, it relies on this fund for the effective delivery of this essential service which supports start-ups and small businesses that want grow. I stressed to Minister Norris the importance of ensuring that the level of funding is confirmed as a matter of urgency, that funding levels are at least maintained and that there is long-term certainty.\"\nMinister Murphy also met with the Secretary of State for Education and Minister for Women and Equalities, Bridget Phillipson MP; and with Minister of State for Science, Patrick Vallance MP.\nDiscussions included concerns over the introduction of the Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) Scheme, support for renewable energy developments, and the previously paused Enhanced Investment Zone for the north of Ireland.\nSpeaking afterwards Minister Murphy said his engagements with the Ministers had been positive.
