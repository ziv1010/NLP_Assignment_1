The Prince of Wales, born to King Charles III and Princess Diana in London, is no stranger to breaking royal protocol. For instance, you've likely seen photos of the prince posing for selfies and embracing fans. But aside from greeting his loyal supporters, William has been busy juggling his official duties with charity activities and initiatives, from the Earthshot Prize to Homewards.\nWhile speaking about royal life in 2017, His Royal Highness told GQ, \"You learn on the job. There is no rulebook. I sometimes wonder if there should be, but in the end I think probably not. Having that difference in how we do things makes the royal family more interesting and more flexible. If we all followed the same line, it would all be quite stifled. Our characters are different and the different opinions are important to have.\"\nGiven his PDA moments with Kate Middleton and his relaxed body language at public outings, it's safe to say that Prince William is embracing the flexibility. Keep reading for all the details on the future king.\nFast Facts\nEarly Life\nPrince William was raised by his parents, Princess Diana and King Charles (formerly Prince Charles), at Kensington Palace in London. The eldest of two, the future king had an active and happy childhood, thanks to his mother breaking royal tradition and prioritizing normal experiences outside the palace. For instance, William and his younger brother, Prince Harry, got to visit beaches, amusement parks, fast food chains and charities with their mother. The family would also have weekend getaways and holiday visits at their country home, Highgrove House, per BBC.\nSpeaking about his mother's parenting approach in the documentary We Can End Homelessness, per People, William said, “She made sure that when [my brother and I] grew up that the life outside palace walls thing was real, you know, not just a statement. It was an actual fact.”\nThe heir apparent to the British throne attended preschool outside of Buckingham Palace before moving on to Ludgrove School and then Eton College, where he studied geography, biology and the history of art. After graduating at just 18, Prince William took a gap year to explore places like Belize, southern Chile and Kenya, learning to speak Swahili along the way.\nIn 2001, the prince returned to the U.K. to attend the University of St Andrews, where he earned his degree in geography. (And more importantly, where he met his future wife.)\nMarriage to Kate Middleton\nIt all began in 2001, when Prince William and Kate Middleton first crossed paths as residents at St Salvator's Hall at the University of St Andrews. The two started as friends, but things changed in 2002, according to royal writer Katie Nicholl. In Vanity Fair, she revealed that the prince made his first move after spotting Middleton in a charity fashion show that year, when she modeled a see-through lace dress.\nA mutual friend who attended the afterparty told Nicholl, \"He actually told her she was a knockout that night, which caused her to blush. There was definitely chemistry between them, and Kate had really made an impression on William. She played it very cool.\"\nThe pair struck up a romance shortly after, then split up in 2007—but fortunately, it was only temporary. After two months apart, they rekindled their romance, and in 2010, the couple got engaged during their getaway to Mount Kenya in Africa.\nDuring their engagement interview with ITV News, the prince said, \"At St Andrews we were friends for over a year first and it just sort of blossomed from then on. We just spent more time with each other had a good giggle, had lots of fun and realized we shared the same interests and had a really good time. She's got a really naughty sense of humour, which kind of helps me because I've got a really dry sense of humour, so it was good fun, we had a really good laugh.\"\nOn April 29, 2011, William and Kate tied the knot at Westminster Abbey, and the televised ceremony garnered 162 million viewers worldwide.\nFamily & Children\nAfter they tied the knot, Prince William and his wife welcomed three children: Prince George, born July 2013, Princess Charlotte, born May 2015, and Prince Louis, born April 2018. George and Charlotte previously attended Thomas’s Battersea School in London before the family moved to Windsor in 2022, and currently, all three siblings attend Lambrook School.\nSince becoming a dad, the royal has been quite vocal about his kids and parenting experiences. While discussing how fatherhood has changed him, Prince William told ABC News in 2016, \"I'm a lot more emotional than I used to be, weirdly. I never used to get too wound up or worried about things. But now the smallest little things, you well up a little more, you get affected by the sort of things that happen around the world or whatever a lot more, I think, as a father. Just because you realize how precious life is and it puts it all in perspective.\"\nPersonal Life\nOutside of the immediate Wales family, Prince William has a niece (Princess Lilibet) and a nephew (Prince Archie), born to his brother Harry and sister-in-law Meghan Markle. However, William and his brother have been at odds since the latter stepped down from his royal duties in 2020 and followed up with a tell-all memoir. Now, the Prince of Wales and his brother rarely make joint public appearances, and he hasn't offered any comments about his brother's book. But on a brighter note, there are subtle hints that suggest the two may be on better terms privately.\nAs for the prince's relationship history, he dated a few women before he met his wife. Rose Farquhar is considered William's first love, and though the details of their relationship haven't been confirmed, we do know that they have since maintained a close friendship—so much so that they attended each other's weddings.\nAfter Farquhar, William reportedly dated socialite Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe and his St Andrews classmates, Olivia Hunt and Carly Massy-Birch. In 2010, the latter opened up to Vanity Fair about their romance and said, \"I think that was why we had a connection,\" she told the magazine. \"William was in the year below, and we just happened to meet through the general St. Andrews melee. It's such a small place that it was impossible not to bump into William, and after a while, there was nothing weird about seeing him around. We got on well, but I think we would have got on well even if nothing had been going on romantically.\"\nIn addition, William dated Jecca Craig, whom he met in Africa during his gap year, Davina Duckworth-Chad and Arabella Musgrave.\nPersonal Style\nFrom sleek blazers and fitted trousers to jumpers and denim shirts, Prince William has mastered the art of adding a subtle, casual twist to his formal attire. Nine times out of ten, you'll spot the royal carrying out his duties in a tailored suit—courtesy of Savile Row—and he often opts for neutral colors like navy blue and gray. But when it comes to casual outings like sporting events, the royal will switch things up with trendy jackets and sneakers to blend in.\nFor instance, in October 2024, the prince wore white trainers and played American flag football while attending an event to celebrate the third anniversary of the NFL Foundation UK. Also, in February 2025, when he visited Lower Blakemere Farm, he donned a pair of jeans and a forest green jacket with a gray news hat. (Leave it to the prince to look stylish and approachable.)\nRoyal Endeavors\nPrince William is currently a patron of over 30 charities and military organizations, including the British Trust for Ornithology, the Tusk Trust, the Football Association and the Welsh Guards Charity. Oh, and did we mention that the prince has been actively involved in mental health initiatives? (He helped launch Shout, the U.K.'s first ever 24/7 text messaging service for those who struggle with mental health issues.)\nBack in 2006, William followed the example of his little brother, Prince Harry, by joining the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst as a military cadet, going on to complete seven-and-a-half years of military service. But aside from his impressive military career, his royal highness developed a passion for conservation, environmental causes and homelessness. In 2020, he launched the Earthshot Prize, which is typically awarded to people for their contributions to environmentalism. And in 2023, the prince teamed up with the Royal Foundation to launch Homewards, an initiative that aims to put an end to homelessness in the U.K.\nIn his We Can End Homelessness documentary, the prince noted his mother's influence and explained, “When I was very small my mother started talking about homelessness, much like I do now with my children on the school run. We saw people on the street. You know, when you’re [that] small, you’re curious, and you’re kind of trying to work out what’s going on. You just ask the question, like, ‘Well, why are they sitting there?’ And my mother would talk to us a bit about why they were there. And it definitely had a really big impact.”",
