It will feature 11 teams and we bring you profiles of three of those sides, Angola, Botswana and Eswatini.\nANGOLA\nBest finish: Runners-up (2008)\nFIFA Ranking: 155\nCAF Ranking: 33\nLast five tournaments:\n2020 – Group Stage\n2021 – Group Stage\n2022 – Group Stage\n2023 – Group Stage\n2024 – Group Stage\nAngola will be making a return to the HOLLYWOODBETS COSAFA Women’s Championship for the seventh year running, but have not made it past the group stages in the previous six tournaments.\nThey had taken a hiatus from the competition before their return in 2019 and have appeared in eight of the 12 previous tournaments overall. This reflects the renewed emphasis being placed on the women’s game in the country after Angola failed to enter the qualifiers for the 2015 and 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cups.\nThey have previously appeared twice at the TotalEnergies CAF Women’s Africa Cup of Nations. In 1995, they reached the semi-finals but lost 6-4 on aggregate to South Africa. They featured again in 2002, drawing two and losing one of their three first-round matches to finish third in their pool.\nTheir first appearance at the COSAFA Women’s Championship finals was in 2006, when they lost to Zimbabwe in a first-round tie that was played over two legs.\nIt was initially a three-team group, but when Mozambique withdrew, Angola and Zimbabwe played two matches against one another, which were won 3-1 and 1-0 by the Mighty Warriors.\nThey featured again in 2008, this time as hosts, and made it all the way through to the final against what was essentially an Under-20 selection from South Africa after a clash of fixtures for the senior national team.\nThe South Africans still proved too powerful, claiming a 3-1 victory in the final of a competition in which Noko Matlou scored 12 goals.\nAngola did not appear again until the 2019 championship, but found the going tough, winning just one of their three pool matches. They opened the tournament with a 4-1 loss to Zimbabwe, followed by a 4-0 defeat to Eswatini.\nThey regained some pride with a 3-1 victory over rivals Mozambique in their final pool game to finish third in Group C.\nThey returned again in 2020 and, following a 2-0 opening loss to South Africa, managed a 1-1 draw with the Comoros Islands and a thrilling 4-3 victory over Eswatini.\nThey could not advance past the group stages in 2021, drawing with Mozambique (2-2) and South Africa (0-0), but losing to eventual finalists Malawi (2-0) to bow out at the first stage.\nThey collected four points in 2022 with a win over Mauritius (3-0), a draw with Mozambique (1-1) and a loss to South Africa (3-0), which was enough for third place in the pool.\nIn 2023, they won one of their three matches, beating Comoros 5-0 but losing to Zambia (3-1) and Mozambique (1-0).\nThey lost both matches in a three-team group in 2024, going down to Zambia (3-0) and Comoros (3-1).\nBOTSWANA\nBest finish: Second (2020)\nFIFA Ranking: 147\nCAF Ranking: 28\nLast five tournaments:\n2020 – Runners-Up\n2021 – Group Stage\n2022 – Group Stage\n2023 – Group Stage\n2024 – Group Stage\nBotswana were HOLLYWOODBETS COSAFA Women’s Championship finalists in 2020 but fell just short, the closest they have come to lifting the trophy.\nThey progressed to the decider from a three-team first-round pool with a pair of 1-0 victories over Tanzania and Zimbabwe, before edging Zambia in a tight semi-final.\nThat set up a final against South Africa, but it was the hosts who triumphed 2-1 at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium. It remains The Mares’ best finish at the COSAFA Women’s Championship and capped an excellent tournament overall.\nThey also reached the semi-finals in 2019 but lost 4-0 to eventual runners-up Zambia. Botswana had gone through the pool stages unbeaten, defeating Namibia (1-0) and Mauritius (3-0), before playing to a 0-0 draw with Zambia.\nThey then lost the bronze-medal match, going down 3-0 to Zimbabwe.\nThose results represented a vast improvement on earlier showings, having failed to win a match in their first three appearances at the tournament in 2002, 2008 and 2011. They broke that drought in 2017 with a 3-0 victory over Lesotho.\nThey also managed a draw against eventual champions South Africa, but it was not enough to advance from the pool as they finished second.\nIn 2018, they opened with a 2-0 win over Malawi, lost 1-0 to South Africa and drew 0-0 with Madagascar to again finish runners-up in their pool.\nThe 2021 tournament proved a disappointment as they did not progress beyond the group phase, despite opening with a thumping 7-0 win over South Sudan, their joint-biggest ever margin of victory alongside a 7-0 win over Mauritius in 2016.\nThe Mares then lost 2-0 to eventual champions Tanzania and 3-0 to Zimbabwe to miss out on the semi-finals.\nThey went unbeaten in 2022, but draws with Malawi (1-1) and Tanzania (0-0), along with a 6-0 win over Comoros, were not enough to progress from their pool.\nThey were again unbeaten in 2023, but once more it was draws that saw them fail to advance. They beat Lesotho 3-0 but were held by Namibia (1-1) and Zimbabwe (1-1) and did not move on from the group stage.\nBotswana finished second in their pool in 2024 after another unbeaten campaign, drawing with Malawi (1-1) and Madagascar (0-0) before defeating Mauritius 9-0.\nTheir very first match in the regional showpiece in 2002 ended in a 14-0 defeat to South Africa.\nThat opening loss was, in fact, the first fixture ever played by the national team, who are now celebrating 24 years of international football.\nESWATINI\nBest finish: Group Stages (2002, 2006, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023)\nFIFA Ranking: 184\nCAF Ranking: 43\nLast five tournaments:\n2020 – Group Stage\n2021 – Group Stage\n2022 – Group Stage\n2023 – Group Stage\n2024 – Group Stage\nEswatini featured in the early editions of the HOLLYWOODBETS COSAFA Women’s Championship and have missed just one instalment of the regional showpiece, in 2011.\nThey are still awaiting their first qualification for the knockout stages, and to achieve that this year would represent a major milestone.\nEswatini claimed a 3-0 win over Botswana in their second match in 2002, their first victory on their maiden appearance, but also lost to Mozambique (2-0) and South Africa (4-0) to finish third in their pool.\nThey returned to the finals in 2006 but endured a difficult campaign, losing to Namibia (6-0) and Zambia (7-0).\nThe country skipped the 2011 tournament but returned for the 2017 finals in Zimbabwe, where a 3-0 win over Mauritius was followed by a 2-2 draw with Mozambique. They were denied a first-ever place in the semi-finals after a 1-0 defeat to East African guest nation Kenya.\nThe following year proved a harsher experience as they lost all three matches, going down to East African guests Uganda (4-3), Zimbabwe (3-0) and Namibia (4-1) to finish bottom of the pool.\nThe side showed marked improvement in 2019, winning two of their three games but still narrowly missing out on the semi-finals.\nA 3-1 victory over Mozambique was followed by a thumping 4-0 success over Angola, but they came unstuck against Zimbabwe, going down 7-0 in their final pool match to bow out.\nThey could not replicate that form in 2020 after being drawn into a tough first-round pool, where they beat the Comoros Islands 4-2 but then lost to South Africa (5-0) and Angola (4-3).\nIt was a tale of woe in 2021 as they lost all three games and conceded 11 goals in the process. A 5-0 defeat to Zambia was followed by a 5-1 loss to Uganda and then a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Namibia.\nThe same pattern continued in 2022, as defeats to Lesotho (3-0), Namibia (5-1) and Zambia (2-0) resulted in another first-round exit. In 2023, they beat Madagascar 2-1 in their opener but then lost to Malawi (8-0) and South Africa (3-0) in a challenging pool.\nThey won one of their three matches in 2024, thrashing Seychelles 6-0 before defeats to South Africa (3-0) and Namibia (2-0).",
