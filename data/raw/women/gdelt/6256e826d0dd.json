The last two winners of the Women’s Euro – England in 2022 and the Netherlands in 2017 – come face to face in a crucial Group D game. Both of those victorious sides were managed by Dutch maestro Wiegman.\nAfter the opening challenge against France, this match will have a strong bearing on England’s progress in defence of their title. A rejuvenated Lionesses squad includes Euro 2022 winners such as Leah Williamson, Lucy Bronze and Lauren Hemp, alongside newer names such as goalkeeper Hannah Hampton and striker Aggie Beevor-Jones. But the Netherlands will be stern opposition. They pushed eventual world champions Spain all the way to extra time in their World Cup quarter-final, and their record goalscorer Vivianne Miedema will be keen to make an impression after missing that tournament with injury.\nA panel of experts are alongside Alex in Zurich, with Robyn Cowen and Rachel Brown-Finnis in the commentary box.
