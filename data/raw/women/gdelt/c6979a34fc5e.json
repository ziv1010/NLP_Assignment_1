All rights reserved.\nUPDATE: Former Capitol Police officer a forensic match for Jan. 6 pipe bomber, sources say\nNovember 08, 2025\nDec. 4, 2025: Blaze News considers fairness and accuracy to be the defining goals of any news organization. Our report posted on Nov. 8, 2025, about the Jan. 6 pipe bombs was based on sourcing from individuals in a position to know this type of sensitive law enforcement information who have a demonstrated record of reliability and accuracy. Of note, the sources continue to stand by the information they provided to Blaze News. At all times, the reporting adhered to professional journalistic standards and was published with a good-faith belief in its truth. Even so, in light of Thursday’s developments and the FBI’s arrest of another individual, Virginia resident Brian Cole Jr., in connection with the Capitol pipe-bomb incident, we consider the values of fairness and accuracy to require retraction of this article.\nAfter publication, Steve Bunnell, whom the Washington Post identified as an attorney for the Capitol Police officer, told the Post his client \"categorically denies\" that she planted the pipe bombs.\nThe featured image on this article was changed on Dec. 4, 2025.\nWant to leave a tip?\nWe answer to you.
