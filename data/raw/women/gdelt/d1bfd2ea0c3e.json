Laura, 37, who revealed her pregnancy earlier this year, shared the romantic proposal story that took place during a getaway in Cornwall.

Louis Rees-Zammit's team-mate gives him hope of breakthrough\nLaura sweetly captioned her post: \"Hey, baby,\" followed by two pink hearts. Adam re-shared the delightful news on his Instagram Story. Adam and Laura confirmed their relationship in October and have since been charming followers with intimate snapshots on social media.\nThis month, Adam expressed his affection through monochromatic Instagram photos for Laura's 37th birthday, with a touching dedication: \"Happy birthday you rockstar x.\" Laura has recently spoken out about how she cleverly kept her pregnancy a secret from her co-presenters and viewers as she anchored major sporting events.\nIn August, she divulged that she knew she was expecting during coverage of Euro 2024, but chose to keep the news confidential even from her co-workers. The journalist, a familiar face from ITV's 2023 Women's World Cup broadcast team, hid her pregnancy while working alongside sports industry titans Mark Pougatch, Ange Postecoglou, Roy Keane, Ian Wright, and Gary Neville in Berlin.\nNavigating through Euro 2024 turned out to be quite challenging for the 37-year-old due to persistent morning sickness and overwhelming tiredness. Following the conclusion of the event, she let the world in on her happy news via an Instagram post and conveyed the hardships she faced, saying: \"It was constant, the morning sickness was quite difficult to battle and I was exhausted all the time. It didn't matter how much sleep you actually got, you'd still be knackered. At least there were rest days when I was able to just chill out in my [hotel] room.\n\"I would have liked to keep it quiet for a little bit longer but I really felt like I couldn't any more and now I've done it it's a relief. \"During her time in Paris for the Discovery+ Olympics round-up show last month, Laura spoke candidly about feeling \"much better\" compared to when she was in Berlin, saying: \"A lot of people were speculating [if I was pregnant] online while I was in Germany, and I didn't enjoy that.\n\"I couldn't do anything about it and I felt quite exposed having to front it up on telly. Really only a small percentage of people use social media but it feels like the world is talking about it because of how sensitive you are to it, so that was difficult to deal with because your mind is on work, but you've also got half a mind on something else and you're sucking in your belly and you want to go and rough and tumble with the fans, but you have to be a bit more careful about things like that too, which is the opposite of everything I'm used to.\n\"It all meant I couldn't enjoy the pregnancy that much, but now I'm through that phase and I can finally feel excitement.\" Adam, notable for his appearances on Love Island in 2018 and 2022 as well as Celebs Go Dating last year, spilled details on how his romance with Laura Woods blossomed months following their initial encounter, admitting on the Getting Lippy Gossip Show that, although he spotted her en route to an interview, they didn't actually interact until several months later. The reality TV star revealed: \"I'd followed her on Instagram because I'd seen a Lionesses game or something like that and then I DMd her because she put like a funny meme on her story.\nHe elaborated: \"The funny part of the story is, for a football fan as well, I actually didn't know who she was. Well, I knew who she was as in I recognised and knew her face, but I didn't know that was Laura Woods in terms of her.\nHe recalled a moment when their paths crossed: \"So I went in for a podcast... [and] she walked past me and the girl that was chaperoning us through was like, 'That's Laura Woods' and I was like [shrugs] but she had her back turned to us, she was like miles behind us.\" He said it was \"fast forward months and months and months\" later that he made his move. Adam also shared his personal aspirations with the TNT sports presenter: \"I'm protective, whether it's Laura, or my family, my friends.\nI want to get married. I want to have kids as well. I've always thought, what type of person will I be? How can I protect my kids?\" He added, regarding privacy for his future children, \"Obviously I've never had a kid, but I don't think I'll be plastering it all over [social media]. I want them to have a fair fight and a chance not to be judged straight away. As long as my really close circle knows exactly who I am, I don't care. I think you have to take everything with a pinch of salt.\"",
