In a league where a playoff format determines the champion and there is no fear of relegation, the impact on how each team approaches every game is just inherently different from the WSL. There is no consequence for finishing last, so even if a team is down three goals at the half, there is still a mindset of going after all three points no matter the circumstances.\n“If you’re not at your best, then any team is capable of taking points off you,” says Morgan. “I enjoy that in the NWSL, no one ever plays to defend for a draw for 90 minutes or just low block the whole time which happens quite often in the WSL when a top team plays a low team. Here, everyone comes into each game with a winning mentality and it makes for really competitive matches.”\nMorgan had to quickly adapt to the NWSL after arriving over the summer, and after helping to earn her team second place in the final standings and two playoff wins to take it to the NWSL final, she is starting to come around to the allure of winning the championship.\n“Obviously a huge difference is the playoff structure,” she says. “Coming into it, I didn’t really know about that – you could play well all season, win the league, and then no one really cares about it anymore after a week.”\nMorgan started in all three of the Spirit’s postseason matches and played a crucial role in the team’s playoff games. Although the team fell short in the championship match, losing 1-0 to Orlando Pride, Morgan sees the playoff structure as one that gives teams a second bite at glory and fans the opportunity to enjoy knockout soccer without an established cup competition in the league.\n“It’s very American in that it’s trying to find more drama, whereas in England we accept whoever has done the best over the course of the season is the best team,” Morgan says.\nThe defender was endlessly impressed with the atmosphere the fans created during those playoff matches at the Spirit’s home stadium Audi Field in Washington D.C. In two sold out home games, the crowds created an atmosphere worthy of the drama of an American playoff run.\n“[The fans] found another level of noise [in those games]. During the regular season, it was just constant noise for 90 minutes but [during playoff matches] my ears were ringing, like when your ears can’t hold the volume properly. It was just crazy – the loudest atmosphere I’ve ever played in.”\nAs Morgan makes her way back to England for the November and December international break, the Lionesses will play in a highly anticipated matchup against the U.S. Women’s National Team (USWNT) at Wembley Stadium. For Morgan, this will be a meaningful opportunity to show her growth and talent to head coach Sarina Wiegman.\nAlthough she now plays abroad, Morgan says scouting for the national team operates similarly to while she played in England. Coaches cannot make it to every game, but she knows the staff is keeping tabs on her and watching her film.\n“I still feel really connected to it and very much that if I’m playing consistently here and at a high level, I still have a chance of being called up,” she says.\nIn joining the NWSL, she has followed over fellow English internationals including Gotham FC’s Jess Carter, Orlando Pride’s Anna Moorhouse, and Angel City FC’s Katie Zelem. During the last international break, many of the Lionesses asked Morgan how she was faring in the NWSL, and Morgan only had positive comments to make.\n“I think it’s just that if people are looking for a different challenge in their career, the NWSL is such an amazing option. Along with the English leave, these leagues are the two most competitive by far. The level of opposition, individuals and teams that you play every week exposes you to a lot of learning. That’s the reason I wanted to come here and I imagine many of the other girls, too.”\nWhile Morgan continues to adapt to the NWSL and American culture, she’s already got part of that sorted – her obsession with the National Football League (NFL). The Jacksonville Jaguars fan always finds time to turn on NFL RedZone when she can to enjoy all the action, even if her team is currently 2-9 on the season.\n“Although I have watched it, I’ve not enjoyed watching it,” she jokes. “Some of their games have clashed with ours so there have been times where, like the other day, I was high as a kite because we just went in the playoffs, but I checked my phone and it said the Jags had lost 12 to 7.”",
