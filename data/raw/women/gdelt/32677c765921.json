  "body_text": "After recent narrow defeats, Nigeria yesterday, overcame South Africa in a dramatic 2-1 semi-final win at the 2024 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) in Casablanca, Morocco.\nThis win was the Super Falcons’ moment of redemption, avenging their 2022 loss to Banyana Banyana and solidifying their claim to African dominance.\nThe highly anticipated semi-final, often referred to as a “final before the final,” lived up to the hype. Rasheedat Ajibade and Michelle Alozie were the stars of the evening, delivering key performances when Nigeria needed it most.\nTheir goals sent the Super Falcons to a record-extending 10th WAFCON final, keeping their unbeaten run intact.\nThe game, held at the Larbi Zaouli Stadium, began with Nigeria on the front foot. The Super Falcons dominated possession and looked sharp on the counter-attack. Ajibade, ever the danger in attack, was quick to capitalise on any opportunity.\nJust before halftime, Nigeria was awarded a penalty after a foul inside the South African box. Ajibade stepped up and dispatched the ball past Andile Dlamini, putting Nigeria ahead in the 45th minute.\nThat first-half goal was a reflection of Nigeria’s controlled and disciplined approach. Michelle Alozie, who had been solid defensively, was also a constant threat going forward, linking up well with Chinwendu Ihezuo and creating multiple attacking opportunities. The Super Falcons went into the break with a 1-0 lead, looking strong but knowing Banyana Banyana would come out fighting in the second half.\nTrue to their reputation, South Africa quickly responded. In the 60th minute, they were awarded a penalty of their own after a foul by Nigeria, levelling the score 1-1. The goal marked the first time Nigeria had conceded in the tournament, ending their run of clean sheets that had spanned four matches. The Super Falcons, however, pushed forward with renewed determination.\nWith just minutes left in regulation time, Michelle Alozie delivered the decisive blow. After a foul near the edge of the box, Alozie stepped up to take a free-kick from 35 yards out.\nWith incredible precision and power, she curled the ball over the wall, sending it past Dlamini into the top corner of the net. The stadium erupted as Nigeria’s players swarmed Alozie in celebration, their victory all but sealed with that stunning strike in the 90th minute.\nWith this win, Nigeria finally defeated South Africa in the Africa Cup of Nations after three consecutive losses in group-stage encounters, with South Africa winning 1-0 in 2018 and 2-1 in 2022.\nThe victory ensured Nigeria’s place in the final, where they will meet either Morocco or Ghana for a chance to claim their 10th continental title.\nRivalry with South Africa’s Banyana Banyana\nFor decades, South Africa’s Banyana Banyana have been a thorn in the side of the Super Falcons, but their dominance over Nigeria has been fleeting. It took the Banyana 17 years after their first encounter in March 1995 to record a win over the Falcons.\nThat victory came in Equatorial Guinea during a 1-0 triumph in the 2007 WAFCON. Prior to that, South Africa had endured some heavy defeats, including a 7-1 drubbing and a 5-0 humiliation at the hands of Nigeria.\nDespite this, the Banyana have slowly closed the gap. In 2018, they secured a group stage win over Nigeria, though they suffered a heartbreak in the final when they lost in a penalty shootout, allowing Nigeria to claim their 9th WAFCON title. Then, in 2020, South Africa gained revenge with a 2-1 win in the group stage of WAFCON, ultimately claiming their first continental title after defeating Morocco in the final, also via penalties.\nIn their 10 previous WAFCON clashes, Nigeria has come out on top six times, while South Africa has triumphed on three occasions. The 2018 WAFCON final, which ended in a 1-1 draw, was eventually decided in Nigeria’s favour after a penalty shootout.\nOverall, the two teams have met 25 times since their first encounter on March 4, 1997. In a 1995 FIFA Women’s World Cup qualifying match Nigeria won 4-1. The Falcons have won 15 times, with six draws and four South African victories.\nSouth Africa’s biggest win over Nigeria came in September 2021, during the Aisha Buhari Invitational Tournament in Lagos, when they handed Nigeria a 4-2 defeat.\nAt the FIFA Women’s World Cup in 2023, both teams reached the Round of 16, but Nigeria’s performance stood out as they defeated co-hosts Australia at Brisbane’s Lang Park,finishing unbeaten in regulation time, while South Africa exited the competition at the same stage.\nSuper Falcons’ unmatched reign in African women’s football\nThe Super Falcons are Nigeria’s most successful women’s national football team, dominating African women’s football since their debut. Their legacy in the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) is unmatched, having established themselves as the powerhouse of the competition.\nThe Super Falcons made their debut in the inaugural African Women’s Championship (now WAFCON) in 1991. Hosted in Nigeria, the Falcons wasted no time in making an impact, clinching the title with a 20 win over Guinea in the final. This victory set the tone for what would become a long period of dominance in African women’s football.\nIn 1991, the Super Falcons of Nigeria began their reign as the queens of African women’s football, capturing their first African Women’s Championship title. The tournament, held in Nigeria, marked a historic moment not just for the team, but for the entire continent. In a 2-0 victory over Guinea, the Super Falcons made their mark on African football, a triumph that set the foundation for what would become an era of dominance.\nFast forward to 1995, the Super Falcons were back, defending their crown in South Africa. The final against Ethiopia was a tense affair, and after a 0-0 draw, Nigeria held their nerve to win 4-2 on penalties. This victory not only retained their title but also proved their resilience, showing they could handle the pressure of big moments.\nBy 1998, Nigeria had become the undisputed force in African women’s football. Hosting the competition again, they faced fierce competition from South Africa in the final. But the Super Falcons were relentless, securing a 2-0 victory to win a third consecutive title, a feat that solidified their reputation as the continent’s elite.\nThe year 2000 saw Nigeria in a dramatic final against Cameroon. After an intense match that went into extra time, the Super Falcons once again triumphed 4-2, extending their reign to four titles. Their dominance was unquestioned, but it wasn’t over yet.\nIn 2003, they faced Cameroon once more. A 2-1 win in the final not only secured Nigeria’s fifth title but also reaffirmed their superiority over all challengers. However, the competition was growing tougher, with teams like Equatorial Guinea beginning to make a name for themselves.\nIn 2006, Nigeria faced Equatorial Guinea in the final. A 1-0 win gave them their sixth title, cementing their place as Africa’s preeminent team. But the Super Falcons weren’t finished; they were determined to keep their stranglehold on the continent.\n2010 saw another dramatic encounter with Equatorial Guinea, this time in a penalty shootout after a goalless draw. Nigeria emerged victorious 4-2 in the shootout, securing their seventh WAFCON title. The Super Falcons’ ability to thrive under pressure was once again on full display.\nBy 2014, Cameroon had become one of their fiercest rivals. But the Super Falcons showed they could handle the heat, defeating the Indomitable Lionesses 2-0 in the final to claim their eighth WAFCON title. The message was clear: Nigeria’s grip on African women’s football was as strong as ever.\nIn 2016, they met Cameroon yet again in the final, and it was business as usual for the Super Falcons. A 1-0 win earned them their ninth title, proving that no matter the opponent, Nigeria remained the team to beat.\nThen, in 2018, the Super Falcons had their sights set on their tenth title. It wasn’t going to be easy. The South African team, known as Banyana Banyana, had emerged as one of the strongest teams in Africa, and in the final, they pushed Nigeria to the limit. After a goalless draw, the match went to penalties. In a tense shootout, Nigeria triumphed 4-3, securing their tenth WAFCON title and cementing their legacy as the greatest team in the competition’s history.\nThe Super Falcons have not only dominated continental football but also represented Africa at the FIFA Women’s World Cup since its inception. They are the only African team to qualify for every edition of the tournament, with their best performance coming in 1999, reaching the quarterfinals. They’ve also featured in multiple Olympic Games.\nPreview of potential final clashes with either Morocco or Ghana\nThe Super Falcons have experienced memorable and intense encounters with both Morocco’s Atlas Lionesses and Ghana’s Black Queens in the history of African women’s football.\nIn the past, Morocco was not seen as a major contender in African women’s football, but their rise over the past decade has made them one of the most promising teams on the continent. The Super Falcons and Morocco first met in the 2018 WAFCON, where Nigeria secured a 2–0 win in the group stage. Despite the loss, Morocco showed impressive defensive organisation, signalling their growing potential.\nHowever, the 2022 WAFCON marked a turning point in the rivalry. As the host nation, Morocco faced Nigeria in the semifinals, a match that proved to be a defining moment. After a 1–1 draw in regulation time, the game went to penalties. Morocco triumphed 5–4, securing their first ever WAFCON final appearance. Looking ahead to potential 2024 WAFCON final, Morocco is now seen as a genuine contender. For Nigeria, reclaiming their title would reaffirm their dominance in African women’s football, while Morocco seeks to cement their meteoric rise by winning their first ever continental title.\nSuper Falcons vs Ghana’s Black Queens\nThe rivalry between Nigeria and Ghana is one of the most intense in African football, spanning both the men’s and women’s categories. The Super Falcons and the Black Queens have clashed numerous times, with Nigeria generally holding the upper hand.\nThe rivalry began in earnest during the 1991 WAFCON, where Nigeria defeated Ghana 2–0 in the final to claim the first of many continental titles. This victory marked the start of Nigeria’s dominance in African women’s football.\nIn 2003, the two teams met again in the WAFCON final. Nigeria won 1–0, extending their continental supremacy. But Ghana’s resilience kept the rivalry competitive, as they continued to test Nigeria’s dominance.\nThe 2010 WAFCON semifinals were another dramatic encounter, with the match ending in a goalless draw before Nigeria triumphed 4–2 in a penalty shootout, showcasing their composure under pressure.\nIn 2016, another narrow 1–0 victory for Nigeria in the semifinals propelled them to their 8th WAFCON title. The 2018 WAFCON saw the teams face off in the group stage, where Nigeria won 2–0 on their way to a 9th continental title. The Super Falcons’ dominance was clear, but Ghana proved their strength in the tournament, continuing to challenge Nigeria’s position.\nThe rivalry continued in the 2020 Olympic qualifiers, where Nigeria secured a 3–1 aggregate win to qualify for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, while Ghana’s spirited performance showed their resilience and ambition.\nWe want to make history – Dikko\nReacting to the win, the National Sports Commission chairman, Mallam Shehu Dikko, praised the Super Falcons for their tenacity and urged them to remain focused on the ultimate prize.\n“This victory was a display of who we are as Nigerians. The Super Falcons showed grit, class and composure under pressure. But the mission is not yet accomplished. Our eyes must remain on the trophy. We want to make history by lifting the WAFCON title for a record 10th time,” Dikko said.\nThe Director General of the NSC, Bukola Olapade also extended congratulations to the Nigeria Football Federation (NFFF) led by Alhaji Ibrahim Gusau, commending their leadership and the team’s preparation ahead of the tournament.\n“The NSC commends the NFF board for putting the team in excellent shape. The team has put in a lot of hard work and its obvious to see, from the results. However, this is not the time to over celebrate. let’s stay locked in on the finals. Naija no dey carry last, so fight to be crowned African champions for the tenth time,” Olopade stated.\nUPDATE NEWS:\nNigerians can now invest ₦2.5 million on premium domains and profit about ₦17-₦25 million.
