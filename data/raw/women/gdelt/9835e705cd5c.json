  "body_text": "Like fathers of teenagers everywhere, Matteo Garrone worries. He worries when his 15-year-old son leaves their home in Rome for a night out in town: “sometimes it can be dangerous,” says Garrone, the 55-year-old Italian director best known for his brutal 2008 mafia drama Gomorrah. “There are gangs of young people who come in from the suburbs to fight”. And he worries about drugs: “My son smokes a lot of weed and I’m worried that from weed he’ll jump to something else,” he sighs. “We parents do worry.”\nYet, his latest film puts those anxieties firmly into perspective. Visually stunning and emotionally intense, the Oscar-nominated Io Capitano tells the tale of two Senegalese cousins who, at the same age as Garrone’s son, give their hard-earned savings to people traffickers and embark on a naive quest to find fame and fortune in Italy. A short way into their epic journey, the sweet boys (played by newcomers Seydou Sarr and Moustapha Fall) are thrown from a truck in the middle of the desert. To survive, they must pass the corrupt Libyan border police, try to make money by working for criminal construction companies and finally attempt to cross the Mediterranean on an overcrowded rust bucket of a boat.\nSpeaking over tea in a London hotel, Garrone says it was important to him that the film was “not about migrants fleeing war and starvation, but about kids who – like our own kids – just want the right to discover the world, the opportunity to make the best life”. Like Gomorrah – about young men drawn into the ruthless world of Naples’ street gangs – and even his last film, 2019’s dark reimagining of Pinocchio, Io Capitano is about the dangerous dreams of boys.\n“Seydou and Moustapha’s characters lie to their families about their plans, just as Pinocchio lies to Geppetto because he wants to go to a land of toys,” says Garrone. “And for so many young Africans, looking at social media, Europe can also look like a land of toys. They see young Europeans coming to their world on holiday and they don’t see why they shouldn’t be allowed the same freedom to travel”.",
