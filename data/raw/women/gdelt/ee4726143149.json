  "body_text": "My sister Maddy Cusack took her own life … but no one wants to say her name now\nMaddy Cusack’s brother is remembering the day his beloved sister took her own life. The anguished phone call from his father that began: “I’m really sorry, Richard.” The ordeal of telling his own partner the awful news. The commotion outside his parents’ home – “Fire engines and ambulances, all on the street”. The utter desolation within – “Mum’s there in floods of tears, my grandma’s in her room in floods of tears as well.” And, most painfully of all, the moment he was asked: “Do you want to go and see her? She’s upstairs…” No wonder he shakes his head. “How are you supposed to deal with that?” he says. “Even now.”\nNow is a year on from the tragic death of Maddy, at 27, and her brother is sitting in the house he bought only weeks before it happened. It goes without saying that he would rather not be reliving what he calls “the worst thing in the world” and the unimaginable grief that followed. Nor laying bare what he admits is an ongoing struggle to come to terms with it all. “If I wasn’t getting by, I wouldn’t be here. Like that [snapping his fingers], I could just go, ‘See you. I’ve had enough’.”\nHe has maintained a largely dignified silence in the past year and has decided to open up about Maddy’s suicide in such a searingly raw interview only because he feels he has been left with no choice. “No one seems to want to say her name,” he laments, meaning those who paid glowing tributes to her 12 months ago but, he says, have done little since to honour her memory or reassure her loved ones that her death would not be in vain.\nChief among them are Sheffield United, where Maddy became the longest-serving player in her 4½ years at the club. That was before it all went so tragically awry, amid what her family says was severe depression, which took hold after Jonathan Morgan joined the club as women’s team manager earlier that year. Morgan denied any wrongdoing and also claimed he had tried to get Maddy help when she was struggling.\nA week after her death, her parents lodged a written complaint with United that led to the appointment of an external investigator. In December, United reported he had been unable to find any direct evidence of “bullying or inappropriate behaviour” that would warrant disciplinary action.\nBeyond a phone call from chief executive Stephen Bettis informing Maddy’s loved ones of the outcome, her brother says there was no meaningful contact with the family after that – no agreement to their request to see the full findings of the investigation; no financial or other backing for a foundation set up in Maddy’s name that has raised more than £50,000 as part of a mission to help girls in the game; no communication over a petition that called in vain for United to retire her shirt number (No 8) in her honour; and no consultation prior to arranging a tribute to her during the men’s team’s Championship win against Derby County on Saturday that her mother and brother attended as lifelong Rams fans.\nThis, her brother says, from a club who lamented the loss of “a much-loved sister” in the immediate aftermath of her death. “They’ve not treated her like a sister, have they?” he adds bitterly, amid what has become an ongoing fight by his family to seek answers. The fight is now focused on ensuring an investigation launched by the Football Association in January avoids what a leading MP branded “seemingly quite serious flaws” in the inquiry commissioned by United. The then government welcomed the involvement of the FA, which also led to the inquest into Maddy’s death being adjourned pending its investigation’s conclusions.\nNews of the investigation was followed by the sudden sacking of Morgan when it was made public that he had begun a secret relationship with a teenage player while in charge of Leicester City Women between 2014 and 2021. Morgan admitted to a “consensual” relationship with an “adult” member of his squad.\nHe has always denied having a vendetta against Maddy, whom he previously managed at Leicester in a doomed eight-week spell there for the midfielder. That denial extended to accusations he had called her a “psycho” when his Burnley side played United shortly before his own move to Sheffield. Her brother says he “wasn’t surprised” at Morgan’s sacking or the reason behind it, adding: “I was glad he was on the scrapheap.”\n‘I’ve got faith in the FA unless they give me a reason not to’\nMaddy’s family have put the FA investigators in touch with those who have worked with Morgan, and at United more broadly, who have contacted them since her death. Her brother is waiting patiently for the outcome of an inquiry that is about to enter its ninth month. He claims he and his mother had to “kick” the governing body into action initially. “The response we had was that they didn’t want to intrude on our grief, which was bizarre to say the least. How is, ‘I’m sorry for your loss. Is there anything we can do?’, intruding?” But he adds of the investigation: “I’ve got faith in the FA unless they give me a reason not to.”\nFor him, that means there can be no hiding the full findings of any report written about the case, nor shying away from imposing “appropriate sanctions” on individuals or institutions if wrongdoing is revealed. “There has to be accountability,” he says.\nAnother motive for speaking out is frustration at what he sees as insufficient action since his sister’s suicide to address the pressures faced by many female footballers, amid the growth of the women’s game. As a Championship player, Maddy juggled her career with a job as a marketing executive at Bramall Lane, potentially compounding any workplace stress she may have been under. “People seem to underestimate the severity of this and what’s actually happened,” her brother says, denouncing what he sees as a culture of “We’re trying to grow the game. Don’t you dare say anything bad about women’s football”.\nAs well as pressing for lessons to be learnt from Maddy’s death, he wants to ensure that a life cruelly cut off in its prime is not forgotten. To her brother, born less than a year before Maddy, she will always be the little sister with whom he shared a lifelong love of football. His “best memory” of her comes from their childhood games of one-on-one – “She wanted to get the better of everyone, not just me.” That included boys she played alongside, and against, whom she would routinely upstage to be named “man of the match”.\nShe also had football in her genes. Her uncle Nick played for Leicester City, Fulham and Swansea City, and chaired the Professional Footballers’ Association, while her father and another uncle reached a decent level. “She was always going to make it,” her brother says.\nHe can remember “no better feeling than watching Maddy play football”. “One of us was always there. Mum and Dad were trekking up and down on a Sunday afternoon all the time and I’d go when I could make it with university or work.” He adds: “Sundays aren’t the same now for me.”\nHe recalls last speaking to Maddy “a couple of days” before she died and admits he could not bring himself to see her body before it was removed from his parents’ home. “I didn’t want my last memory to be that.” It was also too much for him to attend a vigil held outside Bramall Lane on Friday to mark a year since Maddy’s suicide, given he already planned to be there the following day for the United-Derby game at which a minute’s applause was held in her honour.\nMore in Celebrity\n“It’s been horrendous being without Maddy,” he says. “You get flashbacks. Every now and again, something happens, and I’m like, ‘I’ll tell Maddy… Oh’.” His voice begins to crack as he adds: “There are so many things I’d love to tell her and I’d like to ask… But I can’t.”\nA Sheffield United spokesperson said: “The thoughts of everyone associated with Sheffield United Football Club remain with the Cusack family, as well as Maddy’s friends, colleagues and team-mates.\n“We were pleased to be asked to host a vigil for Maddy on the anniversary of her passing and also invite members of the family to Saturday’s game against Derby County.”",
