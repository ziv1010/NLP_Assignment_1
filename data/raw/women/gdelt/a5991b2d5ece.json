  "body_text": "Ted Lasso is finally returning for Season 4, but which actors are returning, and who will be joining the cast? The highly anticipated Ted Lasso Season 4 is set to release this summer, although Apple TV has yet to confirm the exact date it'll arrive on their streaming platform. After a 3-season run from 2020 to 2023, Ted Lasso came to an end, devastating audiences. The hit sports-focused comedy saw Jason Sudeikis portray the titular character, a bumbling American football coach who was thrown into the deep end after taking a job overseeing the fictional A.F.C Richmond's soccer team.\nTed Lasso was continuously celebrated throughout its run for its unique characters, intriguing storylines, and brilliant mix of American and British humor. Ted Lasso's Season 3 ending saw Ted go back to the States so he could still have an active role in his son's life, which was a hugely bittersweet moment, but a beautiful way to wrap the show up. However, Ted Lasso is back with Season 4, and it's worth checking out which actors will be reprising their roles and who the new additions to the cast will be before it airs later this year.\nJason Sudeikis as Ted Lasso\nIt wouldn't be Ted Lasso without the titular character. While Apple TV could've tried to bring the show back without Jason Sudeikis or Ted, it's extremely unlikely viewers would bother to tune in. Sudeikis reprises his role as the iconic American football-turned-soccer coach, who returns to A.F.C Richmond to help run their women's team. While the actor is primarily known for portraying Ted Lasso and several other characters in various sitcoms, Jason Sudeikis' movies made him a star, too. With Ted returning to the UK after going back home to be more involved in Henry's life, it'll be exciting to see what's next for him.\nHannah Waddingham as Rebecca Welton\nLegendary film, TV, and theater actress Hannah Waddingham will also be returning to Ted Lasso as Rebecca Welton, A.F.C Richmond's owner. Rebecca goes through some incredible character development throughout the show, going from a bitter divorcee to a powerful female figure in the football world. At the end of Ted Lasso Season 3, she found happiness with her mystery Amsterdam man, which was interesting, considering Hannah Waddingham admitted she enjoyed Rebecca's suffering. Hopefully, Rebecca will still be in a good place in Season 4, but audiences will have to wait and see.\nBrett Goldstein as Roy Kent\nTed Lasso's Brett Goldstein will be making a comeback as the hysterically funny, yet endlessly grumpy, Roy Kent. Roy is another Ted Lasso character who changed a lot throughout the course of the show, with his hard exterior slowly melting thanks to both his relationship with Keeley and Ted's influence on him. Season 3's finale left Roy's fate with Keeley unclear, with the show implying that both he and Jamie Tartt had a chance at reigniting their respective romances with the PR guru. However, Roy had more going on than just that, as both he and Beard were left responsible for the team after Ted's departure.\nBrendan Hunt as Coach Beard\nBrendan Hunt's portrayal of Coach Beard was, and still is, absolutely hilarious. Beard was a strange man who had all manner of wacky stories in his back pocket. The Ted Lasso Coach Beard-focused adventure \"Beard After Hours\" was a hated TV episode that was actually genius, at least according to some viewers who saw the appeal in it after revisiting the show, but it shone a light on his fascinating psyche. At the end of Ted Lasso Season 3, Beard made the last-minute decision to stay in the UK and ended up marrying Jane despite their tumultuous relationship, which is something audiences are curious to get an update on in the upcoming Season 4.\nJuno Temple as Keeley Jones\nWhile some viewers will be familiar with Juno Temple for her roles in multiple movies aimed at teenage girls in the 2000s, like Wild Child, the actress has really made a name for herself as Ted Lasso's former model and PR business leader, Keeley. When audiences last saw Keeley, she'd decided to forge her own path as a single woman and proposed the concept of a women's team to Rebecca, but the future of her relationships with Jamie and Roy was left up in the air. Viewers have been divided over who Keeley should end up with, and hopefully, Ted Lasso’s biggest debate will be settled in Season 4.\nJeremy Swift as Leslie Higgins\nJeremy Swift has been confirmed to return to Ted Lasso as A.F.C Richmond's Director of Football Operations, Leslie Higgins. Higgins was a comical figure who had some truly wholesome relationships with the other characters, but especially Ted and Rebecca. He was a caring and kind person who opened his heart and home to anyone who needed help, despite the five unruly sons he had under his roof. His ending in Ted Lasso Season 3's finale was relatively uneventful, but audiences are still keen to see what's new with him in Season 4.\nAnnette Badland as Mae Green\nBritish actress Annette Badland will reprise her role as Mae Green, the landlady of Ted and Beard's local pub, The Crown & Anchor. The dedicated A.F.C Richmond supporter initially hated Ted, like most of the other patrons in her pub, but over time, she grew to respect the titular character. Mae was never afraid to offer Ted advice, whether that was personal or concerning Richmond's overall form and tactics, and she was often right, too. Whether Mae is still just a landlady or is now more than just a minor character in Ted Lasso is unclear, and viewers will need to wait until Season 4's release to find out.\n'Ted Lasso's New Season 4 Cast Members\nAt this time, there are several members of the original Ted Lasso cast lineup who have yet to be mentioned regarding Season 4. The returns of Nick Mohammed's Nathan Shelley, Phil Dunster's Jamie Tartt, and Anthony Head's Rupert Mannion, for example, haven't been confirmed for Ted Lasso Season 4, but this doesn't necessarily mean it won't happen at some point over the next few months. However, there are plenty of new faces joining the cast:\n- Grant Feely (Obi-Wan Kenobi, Five Nights At Freddy's)\n- Tanya Reynolds (Sex Education, Outlander, The Decameron)\n- Jude Mack (Prime Target, The Man Who Fell to Earth)\n- Abbie Hern (My Lady Jane, Enola Holmes 2, Peaky Blinders, The Pact)\n- Aisling Sharkey (Jurassic World: Dominion)\n- Rex Hayes (The Pact) - Siobhan (TBC)\n- Faye Marsey (Game of Thrones, Star Wars: Andor, Adolescence)\nTed's son, Henry, will be portrayed by a new actor. Grant Feely, who is best known for playing a young Luke Skywalker in Obi-Wan Kenobi, will take over the role of Henry from Gus Turner. Audiences will still be able to see Turner in the upcoming BBC TV adaptation of Lord of the Flies, though, which is due to come out later this year.\nThere are also six performers joining the cast as brand-new characters in the Ted Lasso world. While it can be assumed that they will all portray various members of the new football team, their character names have not been confirmed yet. The only exception to this is Rex Hayes, whose online CV states that they are playing a character named Siobhan, but once again, this isn't necessarily correct, and viewers should wait until Apple TV officially confirms this.\n- Release Date\n- August 14, 2020\n- Showrunner\n- Bill Lawrence\n- Writers\n- Brendan Hunt, Joe Kelly, Bill Lawrence\nCast\n-\nTed Lasso\n-\nRebecca Welton",
