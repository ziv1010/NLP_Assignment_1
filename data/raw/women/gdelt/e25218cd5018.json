She missed the third group game against China, but has started England's other five matches to date.\nJames superb as England hit China for six\nLauren James was England's matchwinner against Denmark and was in unstoppable form against China.\nShe scored two excellent goals, created three assists and was unlucky to be denied another goal by a controversial video assistant referee decision.\nJames helped England secure a 6-1 victory as they cruised through as group winners with nine points from three matches.\nPenalty joy against Nigeria after James red card\nJames was the star against China but had a moment to forget in the last 16 when she was sent off for standing on the back of Nigeria's Michelle Alozie, who was lying face down on the grass.\nEngland had to battle throughout extra time a player short and stayed in the game to force a penalty shootout.\nGeorgia Stanway, who scored a retaken penalty in the 1-0 win over Haiti, went first and shot wide, only for Nigeria's Desire Oparanozie to also miss. Beth England scored and Alozie fired over the bar to give the Lionesses the advantage.\nRachel Daly and Alex Greenwood converted their efforts before Chloe Kelly, who netted the winner in last summer's Euro 2022 final, kept her cool to take England into the quarter-finals.\nEngland fight back to beat Colombia\nEngland also had to fight hard in their quarter-final with Colombia.\nLeicy Santos put the South Americans ahead, lobbing goalkeeper Mary Earps, just before half-time, but England grabbed an equaliser through Lauren Hemp in the sixth minute of first-half injury time.\nAlessia Russo put the Lionesses ahead after 63 minutes and although Colombia had chances to take the game to extra time, Earps and the England defence denied them to advance into the final four.\nRusso seals final spot with late goal to see off co-hosts\nWith Spain already through to the final, England took on co-hosts Australia for the right to join them.\nElla Toone fired a superb strike into the top corner to put Sarina Wiegman's side ahead, only for Chelsea striker and Australia captain Sam Kerr to equalise with a stunning goal of her own.\nHemp capitalised on a defensive error to restore England's lead, then set up Russo, who added a third to secure a first World Cup final spot and end Australia's hopes of winning the tournament.\nSpain\nSpain put off-field problems behind them in great start\nSpain's build-up to the tournament had been dominated by a player revolt, with a number of players wanting head coach Jorge Vilda to be sacked.\nBut Vilda stayed on, and his side made a superb start, beating Costa Rica 3-0 and Zambia 5-0.\nJapan thrash Spain in final group match\nDespite dominating possession, Spain were thrashed 4-0 by Japan in their final Group C match.\nThe 2011 world champions scored three times in the first half, two from Hinata Miyazawa and one from Riko Ueki before substitute Mina Tanaka added a late fourth to leave already-qualified Spain in second place in the group.\nBonmati stars as Spain smash Switzerland\nBut Spain returned to form in style as they gained a 5-1 victory over Switzerland to secure their first knockout-stage win at a World Cup.\nAitana Bonmati scored twice and made two further goals, with Alba Redondo, Laia Codina (who had earlier scored a bizarre own goal from 40 yards out) and Jennifer Hermoso also on the scoresheet to ensure a place in the last eight.\nTeenager Paralluelo's extra-time goal eliminates Netherlands\nThe Netherlands, runners-up four years ago, were Spain's quarter-final opponents with Vilda's team scoring an 80th-minute penalty from Mariona Caldentey.\nStefanie van der Gragt grabbed a 91st-minute equaliser for the Dutch to force extra time, but 19-year-old Salma Paralluelo became her country's youngest scorer at a Women's World Cup with her winner in the 111th minute.\nLast-minute winner takes Spain into final\nSweden, a side third in the world rankings, were Spain's opponents in the semi-final and it was another thrilling finish, with all three goals scored inside the last 10 minutes.\nParalluelo opened the scoring, Rebecka Blomqvist equalised but just 93 seconds later captain Olga Carmona scored an 89th-minute winner to spark wild scenes of jubilation among the Spanish supporters.",
