Her more than a dozen novels were published in 40 languages and sold more than 90-million copies.\n25 – Ontario passes a divisive bill to remove and block certain bike lanes.

He also threatened to charge China an additional 10 per cent tariff above any other tariffs.\n25 – Former Hamilton Tiger-Cats player and general manager Joe Zuger dies at the age of 84. Zuger played 10 seasons with the team as a quarterback, defensive back and punter from 1962 to 1971. He joined Hamilton’s front office after retiring and was named general manager in 1981. He stayed in the role for over a decade, during which the Ticats won the Grey Cup in 1986.\n26 – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security Cabinet approves a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah. It clears the way for a truce to take effect but Israel is retaining the right to resume fighting if Hezbollah breaks the terms of the agreement. Netanyahu says Israel can now focus its efforts on Iran and Hamas militants in Gaza. U.S. President Joe Biden calls the ceasefire agreement “good news” and expressed hope it will be a catalyst to also end the war in Gaza.\n26 – Nova Scotia Tory Leader Tim Houston and his Progressive Conservatives win a second consecutive majority government following a snap election. The party earned 43 of the 55 seats in the provincial Legislature, with the NDP securing nine seats, the Liberals dropping down to two seats, and one Independent.

This time around, the Tories put forward plans to raise the minimum wage and lower some taxes.\n26 – Toronto author Wendy H. Wong wins the Balsillie Prize for Public Policy thanks to her book on how mass data collection affects democratic freedom. The Writers’ Trust of Canada presented Wong with the $60,000 award for “We, the Data: Human Rights in the Digital Age.” Jurors praised Wong’s book as an “eye-opening, gripping look at the ways in which humanity is being codified, monitored, and tracked at alarming speed and intensity – in largely unaccountable ways.”\n27 – The White House says three American citizens imprisoned for years by China have been released and returned to the United States, in a rare diplomatic agreement between the U.S. and China as part of a prisoner swap.

Platforms like TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram will have a year to work out how to implement the ban before penalties are enforced.\n29 – John Herdman resigns as coach of Toronto FC after being caught up in the Paris Olympics drone spying scandal.

Trump says he wants a commitment from the bloc that it will not create a new currency or otherwise try to undermine the U.S. dollar.\n30 – The Manitoba Métis Federation becomes the first Métis group to sign a modern treaty with the federal government. The signing ceremony recognized the group as the government of the Red River Métis.

Three other provincial Métis organizations in Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta are waiting for treaties of their own.\n30 – Members of the Métis Nation British Columbia vote to withdraw immediately from the Métis National Council. The group says despite 40 years of “good work,” the governance structure of the national council is no longer equitable. B.C. vice-president Melanie Allard says she was dismayed the groups could not find a way to continue together, but the B.C. organization must directly advocate for priorities that matter to Métis people in that province.",
