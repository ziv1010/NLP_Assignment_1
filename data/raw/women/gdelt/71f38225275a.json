  "body_text": "On a bright blue afternoon, in the grounds of the Royal Hospital, this year’s Chelsea Flower Show is taking shape. Men and women in high-vis jackets sprawl over their plots. The smell of manure wafts through the air. Trucks beep as they reverse, loaded to the gunwales with plants nurtured to bloom at just the right moment.\nFor six days from Monday morning, this will be the focal point of the gardening world, Flower Fashion Week, a temporary city erected for one purpose: to show what is possible in horticulture. It is a celebration of extraordinary talent, imagination and flora from every continent.\nIt used to be, anyway. While there is a practised efficiency to the rhythms of the week, restored to its traditional May timing after being disrupted by Covid, beneath the surface the Chelsea Flower Show reflects a gardening world in the grip of an identity crisis. Each week on Gardeners’ World and Gardeners’ Question Time, presenters grapple to reconcile the interventionist nature of their pursuit with the pressure to let things be.\nEven the most mundane acts in the garden – watering, mowing, digging, fertilising, weeding, controlling pests – now comes with environmental, political and cultural baggage. The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), as the de facto adjudicator of gardening, finds itself in an unenviable position: how to balance environmental concerns with the more traditional demands of its members.",
