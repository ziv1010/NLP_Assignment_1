They called on the ambassador to communicate to him their condemnation of what they called the ‘Gaza genocide’ and to express ‘the deep and unwavering solidarity of the Sri Lankan people with the innocent civilians of Palestine, who continue to endure immense suffering and a prolonged and inhumane conflict’. The SB delegates expressed the party’s ‘grave concern over the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories …. the deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure … widespread displacement of families … systematic deprivation of basic necessities resulting in starvation … which all constitute egregious violations of international law.’\nWhile condemning ‘these atrocities’, the SB called upon Israel to ‘immediately halt all military aggression, lift the illegal siege, and end the collective punishment of an entire population.’ It added: ‘The international community, especially a nation like Sri Lanka, cannot remain indifferent while innocent lives continue to be lost on a daily basis’.\nThe SB leader MP Dilith Jayaweera stated, ‘We should leave all differences aside and unite to support Palestine against this genocide, while sending a strong message as a nation’. He further said that ‘guided by the timeless principles of our civilisational values, the Sarvajana Balaya reaffirms its belief that it is the moral duty of all global leaders and nations to stand on the side of peace and humanity’. The SB’s appeal ended with the words: ‘At this critical juncture in world history, we call upon international institutions, human rights organisations, and all nations of conscience to act decisively and without delay.’\nWhat the SB’ers have done is a commendable thing, but subject to important reservations in my view. They have confirmed Sri Lanka’s existing and continuing friendship towards Palestine, while also expressing concern, on behalf of all Sri Lankans, about the avoidable human suffering that is being inflicted on innocent Palestinian civilians. SB’s appropriate appeal to the ‘international institutions, human rights organisations, and all nations of conscience to act decisively and without delay’ should have been supported by a stronger commitment to their own conscience.\nMedia reports from Sri Lanka, especially independent social media reports, show that the majority of Sri Lankans, while helplessly watching on the suffering of the Palestinians with an overwhelming sense of human kindness, are equally concerned about the really genocidal hate directed at the innocent Israeli men, women and children. Why don’t the SB’ers recognise this? Was the shock and dismay they expressed during their meeting with the Palestinian ambassador concerning Palestinians a mere political act intended to win the hearts and minds of the local Muslim minority? Do they assume that the Jews, wherever they live, whether in Israel or elsewhere in the world, including the small number of Jews who live in Sri Lanka, and others who come as visitors, are not worth caring about? Do they believe that Sri Lanka’s foreign policy decisions regarding Muslim majority countries should not be otherwise than in accordance with the whims and fancies of some fundamentalists among the local Muslim community? By the same token, are SB’ers content with Indians interfering in Sri Lanka using the alleged Tamil minority issue as a false pretext?\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India is already mending fences with China; he is scheduled to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit due to be held from August 31 to September 1, 2025. President Donald Trump of America feels worried about this development, as Hindustan Times (July 8) revealed. What will be the plight of Sri Lanka when the current leaders of those countries who are kicking the island nation about like a football in the rough and tough game of geopolitics, go out of power in the course of time?\nThe last mentioned hazard is of particular relevance to the nearly 75% majority indigenous Sinhalese people of the country who are facing the same genocidal threat that the Jewish nation is facing in a different way. Incidentally, the global Jewish population is 15.7 million, according to Wikipedia, which is 0.2% of the global human population of 8 billion. These figures almost exactly match those for the global Sinhalese population, which is between 16-17 million. In Israel, Jews account for 73% of its nearly 10 million population, while in Sri Lanka, 75% of its nearly 22 million population comprise Sinhalese. There is a special unrevealed similarity between these two besieged ancient peoples.\nAlthough, in the past, being a predominantly business community, Sri Lanka’s Muslims used to lean more towards the rightist UNP at elections than towards the left of centre SLFP, it was under the latter party that Sri Lanka’s friendship with the Palestinians became more pronounced. Even a street in Ramallah in the State of Palestine was named after president Mahinda Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka in 2007 during his first term (2005-2010) and around the beginning of the presidency of today’s incumbent Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, who was also sworn in the office, like Mahinda Rajapaksa, in 2005. Relations between Sri Lanka and Palestine were repeatedly reaffirmed through mutual state visits and diplomatic exchanges between 2009 and 2014 ( During Rajapaksa’s second term). Having said that, it must be emphasised that this connection is not based exclusively on Sri Lanka’s current Muslim demography. Ceylon’s links with the Arabs in West Asia predates the birth of Islam in the seventh century CE. Jews also had as ancient a friendly presence in the land of the Sinhalese (Ceylon) as traders, according to the island’s historical records.\nActually, in modern times, Ceylonese (Sri Lankan) collaboration with Israel started more than a quarter century before Lankan diplomatic relations with Palestine began in 1975 with the opening up of an embassy by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in Colombo. On the other hand, the State of Israel was founded on May 14, 1948 by the British as envisaged in the Balfour Declaration of 1917. This was just over two months after Sri Lanka gained its own independence from Britain on February 4. Whereas most of its neighbours refused to recognise or support Israel then, Sri Lanka under its first prime minister D.S. Senanayake did recognise the Jewish state and started buying weapons from it, including the River-Class navy frigate HMCyS Gajabahu, later named SLNS Gajabahu (Source: Wikipedia).\nSarvajana Balaya’s message of solidarity delivered to the Palestine ambassador on behalf of all Sri Lankans would have sounded more sincere if it had been less judgemental towards Israel. The SB representatives didn’t care or dare to make the faintest reference to Israel, let alone invoke, for humanity’s sake, the abhorrent memory of the horrendous genocidal raid by heavily armed Hamas terrorists on innocent Israeli civilians, still asleep, on that early morning of October 7, 2023. For the SB’s message of solidarity to be of any potential value for global peacemaking efforts in this conflict zone, its unequivocal denunciation of Israel should have been balanced by a similarly unambiguous condemnation of the horrific Hamas terrorism that provoked the massive Israeli military operations in Gaza that continue to this day.\nImportant caveat:\nI have the highest respect for the great Palestinian people, and recognise their sovereignty and independence. I fully empathise with them over their undeserved suffering. I equally recognise and respect the great people of Israel, the only democratic nation in the region, and deeply empathise with them over the miseries inflicted on them by terrorists. As a senior Sri Lankan of cosmopolitan views, rooted in the Sinhalese Buddhist culture, which has a natural resonance with cosmopolitanism, it is my sincere and fervent hope to see these two great nations (Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs) living peacefully side by side as gracious neighbours in the near future.\nby Rohana R. Wasala ✍️\nFeatures\nMore state support needed for marginalised communities\nMessage from Malaiyaha Tamil community to govt:\nInsights from SSA Cyclone Ditwah Survey\nWhen climate disasters strike, they don’t affect everyone equally. Marginalised communities typically face worse outcomes, and Cyclone Ditwah is no exception. Especially in a context where normalcy is far from “normal”, the idea of returning to normalcy or restoring a life of normalcy makes very little sense.\nThe island-wide survey (https://ssalanka.org/reports/) conducted by the Social Scientists’ Association (SSA), between early to mid-January on Cyclone Ditwah shows stark regional disparities in how satisfied or dissatisfied people were with the government’s response. While national satisfaction levels were relatively high in most provinces, the Central Province tells a different story.\nOnly 35.2% of Central Province residents reported that they were satisfied with early warning and evacuation measures, compared to 52.2% nationally. The gap continues across every measure: just 52.9% were satisfied with immediate rescue and emergency response, compared with the national figure of 74.6%. Satisfaction with relief distribution in the Central Province is 51.9% while the national figure stands at 73.1%. The figures for restoration of water, electricity, and roads are at a low 45.9% in the central province compared to the 70.9% in national figures. Similarly, the satisfaction level for recovery and rebuilding support is 48.7% in the Central Province, while the national figure is 67.0%.\nA deeper analysis of the SSA data on public perceptions reveals something important: these lower satisfaction rates came primarily from the Malaiyaha Tamil population. Their experience differed not just from other provinces, but also from other ethnic groups living in the Central Province itself.\nThe Malaiyaha Tamil community’s vulnerability didn’t start with the cyclone. Their vulnerability is a historically and structurally pre-determined process of exclusion and marginalisation. Brought to Sri Lanka during British rule to work for the empire’s plantation economies, they have faced long-term economic exploitation and have repeatedly been denied access to state support and social welfare systems. Most estate residents still live in ‘line rooms’ and have no rights to the land they cultivate and live on. The community continues to be governed by an outdated estate management system that acts as a barrier to accessing public and municipal services such as road repair, water, electricity and other basic infrastructures available to other citizens.\nAs far as access to improved water sources is concerned, the Sri Lanka Demographic Health Survey (2016) shows that 57% of estate sector households don’t have access to improved water sources, while more than 90% of households in urban and rural areas do. With regard to the level of poverty, as the Department of Census and Statistics (2019) data reveals, the estate sector where most Malaiyaha Tamils live had a poverty headcount index of 33.8%; more than double the national rate of 14.3%. These statistics highlight key indicators of the systemic discrimination faced by the Malaiyaha Tamil community.\nSome crucial observations from the SSA data collectors who enumerated responses from estate residents in the survey reveal the specific challenges faced by the Malaiyaha Tamils, particularly in their efforts to seek state support for compensation and reconstruction.\nFirst, the Central Province experienced not just flooding but also the highest number of landslides in the island. As a result, some residents in the region lost entire homes, access roadways, and other basic infrastructures. The loss of lives, livelihoods and land was at a higher intensity compared to the provinces not located in the hills. Most importantly, the Malaiyaha Tamil community’s pre-existing grievances made them even more vulnerable and the government’s job of reparation and restitution more complex.\nEarly warnings hadn’t reached many areas. Some data collectors said they themselves never heard any warnings in estate areas, while others mentioned that early warnings were issued but didn’t reach some segments of the community. According to the resident data collectors, the police announcements reached only as far as the sections where they were able to drive their vehicles to, and there were many estate roads that were not motorable. When warnings did filter through to remote locations, they often came by word of mouth and information was distorted along the way. Once the disaster hit, things got worse: roads were blocked, electricity went out, mobile networks failed and people were cut off completely.\nEmergency response was slow. Blocked roads meant people could not get to hospitals when they needed urgent care, including pregnant mothers. The difficult terrain and poor road conditions meant rescue teams took much longer to reach affected areas than in other regions.\nRelief supplies didn’t reach everyone. The Grama Niladhari divisions in these areas are huge and hard to navigate, making it difficult for Grama Niladharis to reach all places as urgently as needed. Relief workers distributed supplies where vehicles could go, which meant accessible areas got help while remote communities were left out.\nSome people didn’t even try to go to safety centres or evacuation shelters set up in local schools because the facilities there were already so poor. The perceptions of people who did go to safety centres, as shown in the provincial data, reveal that satisfaction was low compared to other affected regions of the country. Less than half were satisfied with space and facilities (42.1%) or security and protection (45.0%). Satisfaction was even lower for assistance with lost or damaged documentation (17.9%) and information and support for compensation applications (28.2%). Only 22.5% were satisfied with medical care and health services below most other affected regions.\nRestoring services proved nearly impossible in some areas. Road access was the biggest problem. The condition of the roads was already poor even before the cyclone, and some still haven’t been cleared. Recovery is especially difficult because there’s no decent baseline infrastructure to restore, hence you can’t bring roads and other public facilities back to a “good” condition when they were never good, even before the disaster.\nWater systems faced their own complications. Many households get water from natural sources or small community projects, and not the centralised state system. These sources are often in the middle of the disaster zone and therefore got contaminated during the floods and landslides.\nLong-term recovery remains stalled. Without basic infrastructure, areas that are still hard to reach keep struggling to get the support they need for rebuilding.\nTaken together, what do these testaments mean? Disaster response can’t be the same for everyone. The Malaiyaha Tamil community has been double marginalised because they were already living with structural inequalities such as poor infrastructure, geographic isolation, and inadequate services which have been exacerbated by Cyclone Ditwah. An effective and fair disaster response needs to account for these underlying vulnerabilities. It requires interventions tailored to the historical, economic, and infrastructural realities that marginalized communities face every day. On top of that, it highlights the importance of dealing with climate disasters, given the fact that vulnerable communities could face more devastating impacts compared to others.\n(Shashik Silva is a researcher with the Social Scientists’ Association of Sri Lanka)\nby Shashik Silva ✍️\nFeatures\nCrucial test for religious and ethnic harmony in Bangladesh\nWill the Bangladesh parliamentary election bring into being a government that will ensure ethnic and religious harmony in the country? This is the poser on the lips of peace-loving sections in Bangladesh and a principal concern of those outside who mean the country well.\nThe apprehensions are mainly on the part of religious and ethnic minorities. The parliamentary poll of February 12th is expected to bring into existence a government headed by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Islamist oriented Jamaat-e-Islami party and this is where the rub is. If these parties win, will it be a case of Bangladesh sliding in the direction of a theocracy or a state where majoritarian chauvinism thrives?\nChief of the Jamaat, Shafiqur Rahman, who was interviewed by sections of the international media recently said that there is no need for minority groups in Bangladesh to have the above fears. He assured, essentially, that the state that will come into being will be equable and inclusive. May it be so, is likely to be the wish of those who cherish a tension-free Bangladesh.\nThe party that could have posed a challenge to the above parties, the Awami League Party of former Prime Minister Hasina Wased, is out of the running on account of a suspension that was imposed on it by the authorities and the mentioned majoritarian-oriented parties are expected to have it easy at the polls.\nA positive that has emerged against the backdrop of the poll is that most ordinary people in Bangladesh, be they Muslim or Hindu, are for communal and religious harmony and it is hoped that this sentiment will strongly prevail, going ahead. Interestingly, most of them were of the view, when interviewed, that it was the politicians who sowed the seeds of discord in the country and this viewpoint is widely shared by publics all over the region in respect of the politicians of their countries.\nSome sections of the Jamaat party were of the view that matters with regard to the orientation of governance are best left to the incoming parliament to decide on but such opinions will be cold comfort for minority groups. If the parliamentary majority comes to consist of hard line Islamists, for instance, there is nothing to prevent the country from going in for theocratic governance. Consequently, minority group fears over their safety and protection cannot be prevented from spreading.\nTherefore, we come back to the question of just and fair governance and whether Bangladesh’s future rulers could ensure these essential conditions of democratic rule. The latter, it is hoped, will be sufficiently perceptive to ascertain that a Bangladesh rife with religious and ethnic tensions, and therefore unstable, would not be in the interests of Bangladesh and those of the region’s countries.\nUnfortunately, politicians region-wide fall for the lure of ethnic, religious and linguistic chauvinism. This happens even in the case of politicians who claim to be democratic in orientation. This fate even befell Bangladesh’s Awami League Party, which claims to be democratic and socialist in general outlook.\nWe have it on the authority of Taslima Nasrin in her ground-breaking novel, ‘Lajja’, that the Awami Party was not of any substantial help to Bangladesh’s Hindus, for example, when violence was unleashed on them by sections of the majority community. In fact some elements in the Awami Party were found to be siding with the Hindus’ murderous persecutors. Such are the temptations of hard line majoritarianism.\nIn Sri Lanka’s past numerous have been the occasions when even self-professed Leftists and their parties have conveniently fallen in line with Southern nationalist groups with self-interest in mind. The present NPP government in Sri Lanka has been waxing lyrical about fostering national reconciliation and harmony but it is yet to prove its worthiness on this score in practice. The NPP government remains untested material.\nAs a first step towards national reconciliation it is hoped that Sri Lanka’s present rulers would learn the Tamil language and address the people of the North and East of the country in Tamil and not Sinhala, which most Tamil-speaking people do not understand. We earnestly await official language reforms which afford to Tamil the dignity it deserves.\nAn acid test awaits Bangladesh as well on the nation-building front. Not only must all forms of chauvinism be shunned by the incoming rulers but a secular, truly democratic Bangladesh awaits being licked into shape. All identity barriers among people need to be abolished and it is this process that is referred to as nation-building.\nOn the foreign policy frontier, a task of foremost importance for Bangladesh is the need to build bridges of amity with India. If pragmatism is to rule the roost in foreign policy formulation, Bangladesh would place priority to the overcoming of this challenge. The repatriation to Bangladesh of ex-Prime Minister Hasina could emerge as a steep hurdle to bilateral accord but sagacious diplomacy must be used by Bangladesh to get over the problem.\nA reply to N.A. de S. Amaratunga\nA response has been penned by N.A. de S. Amaratunga (please see p5 of ‘The Island’ of February 6th) to a previous column by me on ‘ India shaping-up as a Swing State’, published in this newspaper on January 29th , but I remain firmly convinced that India remains a foremost democracy and a Swing State in the making.\nIf the countries of South Asia are to effectively manage ‘murderous terrorism’, particularly of the separatist kind, then they would do well to adopt to the best of their ability a system of government that provides for power decentralization from the centre to the provinces or periphery, as the case may be. This system has stood India in good stead and ought to prove effective in all other states that have fears of disintegration.\nMoreover, power decentralization ensures that all communities within a country enjoy some self-governing rights within an overall unitary governance framework. Such power-sharing is a hallmark of democratic governance.\nFeatures\nCelebrating Valentine’s Day …\nValentine’s Day is all about celebrating love, romance, and affection, and this is how some of our well-known personalities plan to celebrate Valentine’s Day – 14th February:\nMerlina Fernando (Singer)\nYes, it’s a special day for lovers all over the world and it’s even more special to me because 14th February is the birthday of my husband Suresh, who’s the lead guitarist of my band Mission.\nWe have planned to celebrate Valentine’s Day and his Birthday together and it will be a wonderful night as always.\nWe will be having our fans and close friends, on that night, with their loved ones at Highso – City Max hotel Dubai, from 9.00 pm onwards.\nLorensz Francke (Elvis Tribute Artiste)\nOn Valentine’s Day I will be performing a live concert at a Wealthy Senior Home for Men and Women, and their families will be attending, as well.\nI will be performing live with romantic, iconic love songs and my song list would include ‘Can’t Help falling in Love’, ‘Love Me Tender’, ‘Burning Love’, ‘Are You Lonesome Tonight’, ‘The Wonder of You’ and ‘’It’s Now or Never’ to name a few.\nTo make Valentine’s Day extra special I will give the Home folks red satin scarfs.\nEmma Shanaya (Singer)\nI plan on spending the day of love with my girls, especially my best friend. I don’t have a romantic Valentine this year but I am thrilled to spend it with the girl that loves me through and through. I’ll be in Colombo and look forward to go to a cute cafe and spend some quality time with my childhood best friend Zulha.\nJAYASRI\nThis Valentine’s Day the band JAYASRI we will be really busy; in the morning we will be landing in Sri Lanka, after our Oman Tour; then in the afternoon we are invited as Chief Guests at our Maris Stella College Sports Meet, Negombo, and late night we will be with LineOne band live in Karandeniya Open Air Down South. Everywhere we will be sharing LOVE with the mass crowds.\nKay Jay (Singer)\nI will stay at home and cook a lovely meal for lunch, watch some movies, together with Sanjaya, and, maybe we go out for dinner and have a lovely time. Come to think of it, every day is Valentine’s Day for me with Sanjaya Alles.\nManeka Liyanage (Beauty Tips)\nOn this special day, I celebrate love by spending meaningful time with the people I cherish. I prepare food with love and share meals together, because food made with love brings hearts closer. I enjoy my leisure time with them — talking, laughing, sharing stories, understanding each other, and creating beautiful memories. My wish for this Valentine’s Day is a world without fighting — a world where we love one another like our own beloved, where we do not hurt others, even through a single word or action. Let us choose kindness, patience, and understanding in everything we do.\nJanaka Palapathwala (Singer)\nValentine’s Day should not be the only day we speak about love.\nFrom the moment we are born into this world, we seek love, first through the very drop of our mother’s milk, then through the boundless care of our Mother and Father, and the embrace of family.\nLove is everywhere. All living beings, even plants, respond in affection when they are loved.\nAs we grow, we learn to love, and to be loved. One day, that love inspires us to build a new family of our own.\nLove has no beginning and no end. It flows through every stage of life, timeless, endless, and eternal.\nNatasha Rathnayake (Singer)\nWe don’t have any special plans for Valentine’s Day. When you’ve been in love with the same person for over 25 years, you realise that love isn’t a performance reserved for one calendar date. My husband and I have never been big on public displays, or grand gestures, on 14th February. Our love is expressed quietly and consistently, in ordinary, uncelebrated moments.\nWith time, you learn that love isn’t about proving anything to the world or buying into a commercialised idea of romance—flowers that wilt, sweets that spike blood sugar, and gifts that impress briefly but add little real value. In today’s society, marketing often pushes the idea that love is proven by how much money you spend, and that buying things is treated as a sign of commitment.\nReal love doesn’t need reminders or price tags. It lives in showing up every day, choosing each other on unromantic days, and nurturing the relationship intentionally and without an audience.\nThis isn’t a judgment on those who enjoy celebrating Valentine’s Day. It’s simply a personal choice.\nMelloney Dassanayake (Miss Universe Sri Lanka 2024)\nI truly believe it’s beautiful to have a day specially dedicated to love. But, for me, Valentine’s Day goes far beyond romantic love alone. It celebrates every form of love we hold close to our hearts: the love for family, friends, and that one special person who makes life brighter. While 14th February gives us a moment to pause and celebrate, I always remind myself that love should never be limited to just one day. Every single day should feel like Valentine’s Day – constant reminder to the people we love that they are never alone, that they are valued, and that they matter.\nI’m incredibly blessed because, for me, every day feels like Valentine’s Day. My special person makes sure of that through the smallest gestures, the quiet moments, and the simple reminders that love lives in the details. He shows me that it’s the little things that count, and that love doesn’t need grand stages to feel extraordinary. This Valentine’s Day, perfection would be something intimate and meaningful: a cozy picnic in our home garden, surrounded by nature, laughter, and warmth, followed by an abstract drawing session where we let our creativity flow freely. To me, that’s what love is – simple, soulful, expressive, and deeply personal. When love is real, every ordinary moment becomes magical.\nNoshin De Silva (Actress)\nValentine’s Day is one of my favourite holidays! I love the décor, the hearts everywhere, the pinks and reds, heart-shaped chocolates, and roses all around. But honestly, I believe every day can be Valentine’s Day.\nIt doesn’t have to be just about romantic love. It’s a chance to celebrate love in all its forms with friends, family, or even by taking a little time for yourself.\nWhether you’re spending the day with someone special or enjoying your own company, it’s a reminder to appreciate meaningful connections, show kindness, and lead with love every day.\nAnd yes, I’m fully on theme this year with heart nail art and heart mehendi design!\nWishing everyone a very happy Valentine’s Day, but, remember, love yourself first, and don’t forget to treat yourself.\nSending my love to all of you.\n-\nFeatures6 days ago\nMy experience in turning around the Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka (MBSL) – Episode 3\n-\nBusiness6 days ago\nRemotely conducted Business Forum in Paris attracts reputed French companies\n-\nBusiness6 days ago\nFour runs, a thousand dreams: How a small-town school bowled its way into the record books\n-\nBusiness6 days ago\nComBank and Hayleys Mobility redefine sustainable mobility with flexible leasing solutions\n-\nBusiness3 days ago\nAutodoc 360 relocates to reinforce commitment to premium auto care\n-\nMidweek Review3 days ago\nA question of national pride\n-\nOpinion2 days ago\nWill computers ever be intelligent?\n-\nMidweek Review3 days ago\nTheatre and Anthropocentrism in the age of Climate Emergency",
