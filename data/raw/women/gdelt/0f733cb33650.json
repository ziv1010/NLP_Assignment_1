  "body_text": "I am not hostile to private healthcare users, Keir Starmer insists\nSir Keir Starmer has insisted he is “not hostile” to private health care users, despite saying he would not pay for treatment for himself or for a relative in need of life-saving care.\nIn an interview with Nick Robinson for BBC Panorama, the Labour leader said he could “completely understand why people would go private” and knew patients who had done so in order to “get back to work”.\nBut he said he still considered the NHS the “very best place” for people who needed acute care, including himself and his family.\nSir Keir also said he was willing to make enemies over his plans to radically reform the planning system and confirmed he would send British troops into battle if required, insisting he was ready to take “whatever action” needed to defend the UK.\nPressed for his views on those who used private health care, having said he would not use the service himself, or even for a relative in need of life-saving care, Sir Keir denied that he was hostile towards patients who took that route.\nAsked if he considered them “queue jumpers”, he said: “I’m not hostile in the slightest. I completely understand why people would go private.\n“I know people who have because they wanted to have an operation more quickly, to get back to work or get back to something else.”\nBut he doubled down on his previous comments, adding: “The NHS is the single best place if you’ve got an acute problem and that is why even in private hospitals, they refer into the NHS for acute care. If I had an acute care, life-threatening issue for me or my family, the very best place to be is in the NHS.”\nIt comes after he admitted he uses a private dentist because he is not eligible for NHS care.\n‘We cannot go on like this’\nSir Keir also said he was willing to fall out with people over his planning reforms, if that was what it took to get the economy growing.\nAsked if was prepared to make enemies, he said: “Yes, we’re going to have to be tough, we’re going to have to change the way things are done.\n“I’ll give you one short example. I spoke to the CEO of an energy company saying, ‘How long would it take you to put a wind turbine farm up?’\n“He said, ‘I could do it in two years. You wouldn’t get any power out of it for 13 years because I’d lose five years to planning, and another six or seven years before the grid connected.’ We cannot go on like that.”\nElsewhere, Sir Keir said he was “ready to do whatever is necessary to defend our country” when pressed on whether he would join military action in an “unforeseen crisis”, such as wars in Iraq and the Falkland Islands.\nHe said: “I am ready to take whatever action we need to take to defend our country and to protect the country.\n“That is the first duty of any government. It’s why the Labour government back in the day signed the Nato treaty. It’s why the Labour government back in the day was the first to go down the road of nuclear deterrent. So, I’m ready to do whatever is necessary to defend our country.”\nHe also continued to refuse to rule out raising capital gains tax, in what has become a long-running headache for Labour as the Tories seek to pin the party down on ambiguous pledges.\nAsked if Labour would increase the tax, he said: “All of our plans are set out in our manifesto.”\nPressed on whether that meant it was a possibility, he continued to dodge the question, adding: “All our plans are set out in the manifesto, fully costed, fully funded and none of them, all launched yesterday, require tax increases, over and above the ones we’ve set out.\n“We are going to deal with the non-dom tax status. We are going to deal with the private… with the tax break for private schools, and the tax that we need to introduce or to extend on oil and gas companies. But none of our plans require any other tax rises.”\n09:44 PM BST\nThat’s all for today\nThank you for joining The Telegraph’s live coverage of day 21 of the general election campaign.\nMy colleague Jack Maidment will be back on Monday to guide you through the day’s developments.\n09:43 PM BST\nThere is no Blair-esque enthusiasm for Starmer, says Sir John Curtice\nSir John Curtice has said there is “nothing like” the enthusiasm for Sir Keir Starmer than existed for Sir Tony Blair in the run up to the 1997 election.\nThe prominent psephologist told The Times: “We know that basically, there isn’t that much enthusiasm for Labour — nothing like in 1997 [when Tony Blair was elected].\n“Starmer has made his party acceptable, but he is not even as popular as David Cameron was before 2010. It’s a difficult gig.”\n09:24 PM BST\nSuella Braverman: Migration is to blame for Tories’ electoral woes\nSuella Braverman has blamed the Conservative Party’s “depressing” electoral position on its failure to tackle migration as she said she had urged Rishi Sunak to take action, write Tim Stanley and Home Affairs Editor Charles Hymas.\nIn an interview with The Telegraph, the former home secretary said she believed the Right would not be divided if the Government had taken action on migration sooner.\nMs Braverman said she was not supporting Reform and made clear she was not attacking the Prime Minister, whose record on tackling inflation she praised.\nHowever, she said: “We shouldn’t have this split on the Right. If we’re a proper Conservative Party that just does what we promised to do, like cut migration and cut taxes, we would not have this division… and we’d have another 15 per cent added on to our polling right now.”\nRead the full story here.\n09:11 PM BST\nPictured: A meeting of minds\n09:00 PM BST\nWhy Reform will struggle to win any seats – despite beating the Tories in the polls\nOne week ago, Nigel Farage voiced his goal for Reform to overtake the Conservatives in the polls, write Data Journalist Ollie Corfe and Data Editor Ben Butcher.\nOn Thursday, a YouGov poll said he had finally achieved it, surpassing the Tories by one point.\nThe poll has Reform on a national vote share of 19 points, with the Conservatives trailing on 18.

We were wrestling with the same moral dilemma.\n“Let’s not forget that Keir Starmer was one of the vast majority of Labour MPs who voted no confidence in Jeremy Corbyn.\n“Keir Starmer resigned from Jeremy Corbyn’s front bench and then when Jeremy Corbyn was re-elected we all faced a terrible moral dilemma about how to avoid the Labour Party becoming extinct.\n“And what people like Keir Starmer, Tom Watson and a small number of members of the shadow cabinet did was to try and prevent the Labour Party from literally falling off a political cliff.”\n08:25 PM BST\nStarmer interview proves he ‘flip flopped’ to win Labour leadership, says Coffey\nSir Keir Starmer admitted in the BBC interview that he “flip flopped” to win the Labour leadership in 2020, Therese Coffey has said.\nThe former environment secretary wrote on X, formerly Twitter: “Keir Starmer admitting he flip flopped on what mattered to him in order to win the Labour leadership election.\n“It seems he will make promises to help him win an election but drop them without a thought.”\n08:20 PM BST\nSunak on Reform: ‘Only poll that matters is July 4’\nRishi Sunak has dismissed Reform UK overtaking the Conservatives in the polls, saying “the only poll that matters is the one on July 4”.\nSpeaking at a press conference at the G7 in Italy, the Prime Minister said: “I think we’re only halfway through this campaign and the Conservative Party and me are going to fight for every single vote until the last day.\n“And you know, what you saw this week was actually an important moment in the campaign because the only poll that matters is the one on July 4.\n“What you did see this week is the two leading parties put out their manifestos for the future of our country, and there’s a very clear choice.”\nHe added: “What I would say is if that poll and all these things were replicated on election day, what that would be is handing a blank cheque to Keir Starmer to increase people’s taxes on their home, their car, their job, their pension, their house, that’s what it will do.\n“So I’m going to continue fighting very hard to make sure everyone understands the choice that’s ahead of them.”\n08:04 PM BST\nInterview ends\nThe BBC interview with Sir Keir Starmer has now ended.\n08:00 PM BST\nYou’re a ‘Brexit-hating, tax-raising, industry-nationalising, Corbyn-praising, self-declared Socialist’, Starmer told\nNick Robinson closed the BBC interview by telling Sir Keir Starmer that he was a “Brexit-hating, tax-raising, industry-nationalising, Corbyn-praising, self-declared Socialist”.\nMr Robinson said: “What do you say to a voter who wonders if they can really trust a man who says he’s changed from the Brexit-hating, tax-raising, industry-nationalising, Corbyn-praising, self-declared Socialist?”\nThe Labour leader answered: “I went to work in Northern Ireland, and I said I would, with others, I would change the police service of Northern Ireland, to make sure it gained the confidence of both communities. So, I said what I would do and I changed it.\n“I then led the Crown Prosecution Service, I said I would change it to make sure that it better protected victims, particularly in sexual cases. I said I would do it, I did it.\n“I came in and led the Labour Party, I said I would change it to put it back in a position to win elections and over four and a half years, I’ve done it with a steely determination.\n“So, every time I’ve said, I’ve gone into a leadership role and said this is what I’m going to do, I’ve then delivered it. So, I stand on my record and I have done this for a purpose, which is to ensure the Labour Party can win an election, bring back the change that is needed for millions of people in this country.”\n07:58 PM BST\nStarmer rules out bringing back EU freedom of movement\nSir Keir Starmer has ruled out bringing back freedom of movement with the European Union.\nIn a BBC interview, Nick Robinson said: “I simply want to ask you again if you’ll forgive me about this, see in this, the Keir Starmer Manifesto from 2019, it says, we need to defend migrants rights and argue for free movement in the EU. Doesn’t that tell you who’s side you’re really on when it comes to the debate about migration?\nSir Keir replied: “Well, let’s take free movement. That was part and parcel of our membership of the EU. We’ve left the EU, freedom of movement is over. There’s no case for bringing it back. “\nMr Robinson interjected: “You argued for it after Brexit.”\nSir Keir went on: I said as we were negotiating the exit from the EU. But that’s done. We’re out. We’re not going back and therefore we’re not having freedom of movement.”\n07:57 PM BST\nWe will always have a special relationship with US, says Starmer\nBritain will always have a special relationship with the United States including if Donald Trump is the next president, Sir Keir Starmer has said.\nAsked if he would be prepared to stand up to the US, the Labour leader said: “Well, I’ll deal with each situation as it arises. We don’t simply do what any other country asks us to do. Every case has to be looked at on its merits.\n“That is a very special relationship. It will always be a special relationship with the US, whoever is the president.\n“Obviously, it will be up to the American people to decide who that is, and we and I, if we are elected into government, will deal with whoever is president of the United States.”\n07:55 PM BST\nStarmer: I am prepared to go to war\nSir Keir Starmer has said he is prepared to go to war as Prime Minister.\n“I am ready to take whatever action we need to take to defend our country and to protect the country,” he said in an interview with the BBC.\n“That is the first duty of any Government. It’s why the Labour Government back in the day signed the NATO treaty.\n“It’s why the Labour government back in the day was the first to go down the road of nuclear deterrent. So, I’m ready to do whatever is necessary to defend our country.”\n07:53 PM BST\nI am not hostile to private healthcare users, Starmer insists\nSir Keir Starmer has insisted that he is not hostile to private healthcare users in an interview with the BBC’s Nick Robinson.\nMr Robinson asked: “Are you hostile to people who go private? Do you think they’re queue jumpers, that it’s unfair?”\nThe Labour leader replied: “I’m not hostile in the slightest. I completely understand why people would go private.\n“I know people who have because they wanted to have an operation more quickly, to get back to work or get back to something else.”\nThe Labour leader said during the Sky News leaders’ special on Wednesday that he would not pay for a family member’s treatment even if they were stuck on an NHS waiting list.\n07:52 PM BST\nStarmer: Labour’s manifesto is about ‘wealth creation’\nThe Labour Party manifesto is about “wealth creation”, Sir Keir Starmer has claimed.\nHe told the BBC’s Nick Robinson: “Unlike some Labour leaders that may have sat in a chair like this in an interview with you, my manifesto is about wealth creation.\n“This is a party of wealth creation, of growth and therefore this boxing-in that everyone is trying to do, particularly in recent days that the only levers available to a Labour Government or Labour Prime Minister is to put up tax or pull down spending, I reject that.\n“Growth is the lever that I intend to pull. That is why this plan is so carefully thought through.”\n07:52 PM BST\nStarmer continues to refuse to rule out capital gains tax rises\nSir Keir Starmer has continued to refuse to rule out any rises in capital gains tax if Labour is elected.\nNick Robinson asked him: “Is Labour going to increase the tax that working person pays in capital gains?”\nSir Keir replied: “Nick, all of our plans are set out in our manifesto.”\nMr Robinson said: “So, they might?”\nSir Keir said: “Let me finish the sentence. All our plans are set out in the manifesto, fully costed, fully funded and none of them, all launched yesterday, require tax increases, over and above the ones we’ve set out.\n“We are going to deal with the non-dom tax status. We are going to deal with the private equity loophole. We are going to deal with the tax break for private schools, and the tax that we need to introduce or to extend on oil and gas companies.\n“But none of our plans require any other tax rises.”\n07:50 PM BST\nIn pictures: Starmer today, Starmer yesterday\n07:47 PM BST\nStarmer: I ditched my leadership promises so Labour could change the country\nSir Keir Starmer has said he ditched the promises he made when running for the Labour leadership so that he could change the country.\nAsked about his ditching of a raft of Left-wing policy promises, the Labour leader said: “Well, I took a decision, Nick, that we had to change the Labour Party, and drag it closer to the country.\n“And I did that having thought long and hard about the last four elections, because we lost in 2010, 2015, 2017, 2019, and I took the view that that was because we had drifted too far from working people, our central purpose, we had drifted to a place where we were essentially looking and feeling like a party that was looking down on people across the country, and we got very badly beaten in 2019.”\nHe added: “I have changed my mind and the reason for that, is having reflected politically on those four losses in a row, I took the decision that we needed to change the Labour Party and drag it closer to the country.”\n07:43 PM BST\nStarmer denies using growth as ‘magic wand’\nSir Keir Starmer has denied that promises of economic growth are his “magic wand”.\nInterviewed on the BBC, Nick Robinson told the Labour leader: “We’re back to your magic wand, aren’t you, it’s always, when you’re asked a tough question, you go, ‘Ah, I’ve got a magic want, it’s called growth’.”\nSir Keir replied: “No, no, no, it’s not a wand, it’s a plan. That’s the complete difference.\n“Our manifesto that we launched is the culmination of four years work, working with business partners, working with others, about what is the change? So I say to every sector, what is inhibiting the growth that you need?”\n07:42 PM BST\nStarmer fails to rule out cuts to public services\nSir Keir Starmer has failed to explicitly rule out cuts to public services.\nNick Robinson asked the Labour leader: “I think the viewers will say, the question was, will there be cuts in other areas? And the independent experts say there will be cuts in other areas, unless you borrow more or tax more, or grow the economy incredibly fast. So are you saying there will be cuts or not?”\nThe Labour leader replied: “Well, Nick, firstly, we’re not going back to austerity, I ran a public service during austerity, I know what that feels like, I know the damage that it did, and that’s been the legacy of the last 14 years, so we’re not going to go to austerity.\n“But secondly, I do want to take on this challenge that you rightly put to me in relation to tax and spend. Because the assumption of those that are saying these are the forecast is that we cannot do any better than we’ve done in the last 14 years.\n“In other words, it’s impossible to grow the economy, and therefore, you’re going to have to tax more, or spend less.”\n07:40 PM BST\nSunak: G7 to work together to tackle illegal migration for first time\nG7 countries will work together to tackle illegal migration for the first time as Rishi Sunak declared the problem a “global emergency”, reports Deputy Political Editor Daniel Martin.\nThe seven leaders agreed at the end of their two-day summit in southern Italy to form a coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants.\nMr Sunak said he and summit host Giorgia Meloni, the Italian premier, led the discussion on migration where leaders agreed to enhance border enforcement.\nHe said: “Illegal migration is now a global emergency. More people are moving across border than at any time in our history. We cannot stand by and watch this human tragedy unfold.”\n07:36 PM BST\nStarmer told Labour schools promise means one new teacher per three schools\nLabour’s promise to recruit 6,500 teachers over the next five years would equate to just one extra teacher for every three schools, Sir Keir Starmer has been told.\nNick Robinson put it to the Labour leader that his plan would result in only “a third of a teacher per school”.\nSir Keir responded: “Yeah, two things I’d say about that. Firstly, that is set out in the manifesto very clearly as a first step, a down payment, one of the steps that I hope that we’ll be taking literally on day one in government starting down that recruitment.\n“The second thing is the particular problem that we’re aiming this at is the lack of teachers in specific subjects in secondary school.”\nHe added: “It is a very meaningful change for the children that need it.”\n07:34 PM BST\nLabour changes are not small, Starmer insists\nThe changes proposed in the Labour Party’s manifesto are not “very small”, Sir Keir Starmer has insisted.\n“I don’t accept they’re very small,” he told the BBC’s Nick Robinson. “What we’ve set out in the manifesto is a plan for change, a plan to grow the economy.\n“I think that amongst the biggest problems of the last 14 years has been that the economy has been flat, we haven’t grown the economy, and therefore, we haven’t had the money to put into our public services, which are crumbling, and we haven’t been able to raise living standards.\n“So we have to have a plan for growth. This is a bold plan for growth.”\n07:33 PM BST\nStarmer: Labour is ready for government\nSir Keir Starmer has said Labour is ready to govern with three weeks until polling day on July 4.\nAsked if he is ready for Government, the Labour leader told Nick Robinson: “Yes, I know that we’ve got to earn every vote and not a seat has been won yet, and therefore I’m not complacent about it.\n“But I’ve spent four and a half years changing the Labour Party, getting it into a position where we could put our offer before the country.\n“We unveiled our manifesto, a manifesto for wealth creation and for growth, to fix the fundamentals and take our country forward.\n“So, yes, we’ve prepared, we’re ready, but I’m conscious that every single vote has to be earned, and we’re still at the stage of earning the votes.”\n07:32 PM BST\nInterview begins\nNick Robinson’s interview with Sir Keir Starmer has started.\n07:21 PM BST\nStarmer to face grilling over Labour’s tax plans\nSir Keir Starmer is set to be grilled on Labour’s manifesto and plans for taxation by the BBC’s Nick Robinson.\nThe Labour leader is the fourth party leader to feature on The Panorama Interviews, after Rishi Sunak, John Swinney and Rhun ap Iorwerth.\nThe interview begins at 7.30pm on BBC One.\n07:17 PM BST\nSunak: All of Britain is behind Princess of Wales\nAll of Britain is behind the Princess of Wales as she makes her return to public duties after cancer treatment, Rishi Sunak has said.\nThe Prime Minister told a conference at the G7 in Italy: “It’s obviously wonderful, wonderful news.\n“I think the whole country will be behind the Princess of Wales for her recovery and I saw her statement earlier.\n“I thought it was brave.

I campaigned to remain, I voted to remain.\n“But the vote was to leave. We’ve left and we’re not going back into membership of the EU, that means the single market, the customs union.”\nMr Robinson interjected to say “you’re not that keen on growth”, to which Sir Keir replied: “I do think we can do better than the botched deal that we got under Boris Johnson. I think every business thinks that. So if there are businesses that are watching this, yes I hear what you say about the barriers to trade and we are going to do something about that.”\nThe Labour leader added that “the idea that the sort of single silver bullet is simply the relationship with the EU is not something I accept” on how to generate growth.\n06:10 PM BST\nI’ll be ‘tough’ on NIMBYs, says Starmer\nSir Keir Starmer has said he will be “tough” on NIMBYs in a BBC interview with Nick Robinson.\nIn the first teaser from the interview, the Labour leader said he would take on locals who oppose new housing and infrastructure developments.\n“Yes, we’re going to have to be tough,” he said. “We’re going to have to change the way things are done.\n“I’ll give you one short example.
