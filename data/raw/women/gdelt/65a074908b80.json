  "body_text": "England duo Lucy Bronze and Keira Walsh have become the latest players to back USWNT star Alex Morgan in her criticism over the potential Saudi sponsorship of the 2023 Women’s World Cup.\nThe Athletic reported in January that Visit Saudi, the Gulf nation’s tourist board, was set to be unveiled as a sponsor for this summer’s tournament in Australia and New Zealand.\nAdvertisement\nThe potential partnership has caused unrest within women’s football due to Saudi Arabia’s human rights record.\nAmnesty International has described Saudi Arabia’s human rights record as “appalling” while homosexuality and gay marriage is illegal in the country. Women were not allowed to watch football matches until 2018.\nBarcelona duo Bronze and Walsh have now joined the likes of Morgan and Chelsea Women manager Emma Hayes in voicing their concerns.\n“I think the responsibility on players in women’s football is that we have the stage to speak out, that we have strong opinions, that we know that we are capable of making changes,” said Bronze.\n“I can’t speak for everyone but all the other players that I’ve spoken to largely agree with Alex Morgan’s comments, and I do equally.\n“You know, if you want to push women’s sport on, we want it to be supported by people who share their philosophies and the views that we share as players and as a game, which is supporting women, which is high level sport, high level football, fully inclusive, we welcome everybody to our sport.\n“So we’d like to think that the people that support us and are pushing the game share similar views and interests and opinions as we do.”\nWalsh added: “I think in general, they probably don’t support a lot of female players’ lifestyles and what we’re promoting. And obviously, we have to use that platform to push our opinions and for what we think is right and for equality.\n“We want the best and we want inclusivity but Equally it’s not about going there and being political at the same time.”\nThe 2023 Women’s World Cup is scheduled to get underway on July 20.\nGO DEEPER\nWhat we have in store ahead of the 2023 World Cup\n(Photo: Getty Images)",
