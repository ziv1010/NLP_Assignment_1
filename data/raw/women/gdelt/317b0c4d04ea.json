The injuries received in such cases can lead to death or life changing consequences.\nWhile much has been said about street attacks with strangers attacking people with bladed weapons in random attacks, there is still a prevalent use of the knives when it comes to attacks within domestic relationships, between friends or even neighbours.\nHere is a roundup of court stories from year involving knife attacks.\nMark Jones\nMark Jones, 19, knifed fried Kyle Wallley to death then posted video footage of his lifeless victim. The killer was said to have been \"obsessed\" with knives.\nThe pair had planned to watch the Euro 2020 final between England and Italy but Mr Walley, who was 19, was killed ahead of kick-off when a row descended into fatal violence. The attack took place in Rhosymedre, Wrexham.\nA trial at Mold Crown Court was told Jones had shared his visit to the property on Snapchat. It initially showed how the pair were drinking alcohol with bottles of whisky and other spirits shown in a seconds-long clip. The court heard how Jones’ posts started to take a more sinister turn with one clip showing him alone talking directly to the camera saying he was going to “chef someone up”.\nThe court was shown another video clip, captured and uploaded by Jones, that showed the men involved in a heated argument. During the exchange Jones could be heard shouting: “It’s my ADHD lad”. It then cut to a clip of a lifeless Walley who appeared to have fallen into and then behind the sofa. Jones, still filming, was shown to be “stamping” on his bleeding victim and shouting at him.\nA final clip that was recovered from the social media platform saw Jones, now having fled the scene on his bike, filming his blood-soaked hands. “Man’s gonna get loads of time for stabbing him up,” said Jones to his followers on the app while also claiming that “loads of people were after” Walley and that his victim “deserved it”.\nLord Justice Eyre called the killer \"despicable\" and branded the Snapchat footage \"sickening\". He sentenced .Jones was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 16 years and 126 days.\nREAD MORE: Parents kidnap children from contact centre after assaulting support worker\nREAD MORE: Prolific thief stole bank card before using it to buy food from Greggs\nRebecca Press\nRebecca Press, 31, murdered her mother's neighbour Marc Ash by stabbing him in the chest after grabbing a knife from a kitchen drawer. She stabbed him near the hear, leaving him with fatal injuries.\nThe attack took place at her mother’s flat in New Tredegar, Caerphilly, on July 17 last year. She had become upset after finding out her ex boyfriend had been cheating on her, but when Mr Ash, 57, tried to calm her down she attacked him.\nShe later told her mother Michelle Press “I have stabbed your f****** best friend” before fleeing the address and hiding in a bush. She left a voicemail for her ex boyfriend Ashley Allan, which said: “‘Ash it’s really bad. It’s really f****** bad. I’ve just stabbed someone and killed them. I’ve just murdered someone, please phone me now. F*** (screams). I’ve just murdered someone”.\nThe defendant had initially attended New Tredegar Rugby Club and Dynevor Arms with Mr Ash and was said to be “having a good time”. She had been drinking throughout the day and told her mother she had taken Valium.\nFollowing her arrest, a urine sample was taken and substances including alcohol, bromazolam and etizolam, amphetamine, MDMA and THC. More than 600 tablets containing MDMA and bromazolam were found in her possession.\nPress initially denied murder, claiming Mr Ash was aggressive and she had acted in self defence, but she changed her plea to guilty during her trial at Cardiff Crown Court. She was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 20 years.\nChristopher Chandler\nChristopher Chandler, 57, ried to murder his long-term partner by repeatedly stabbing her with a kitchen knife in a ferocious assault which almost severed her spine. The gravely injured victim managed to crawl out of their flat and was found in the communal area with the weapon still stuck in her back. The woman was rushed to hospital with life-threatening injuries and needed multiple blood transfusions due to the amount of blood she was losing.\nThe defendant had had stopped taking his prescribed schizophrenia medication in the weeks prior to the near-fatal attack, and the pair had stayed up the night before the incident taking amphetamine and drinking alcohol together. The incident took place at the flat on Orchard Street in Swansea city centre where the couple then lived.\nA squabble then ensued over cigarettes, and the defendant responded by arming himself with a knife from the kitchen - Chandler held the weapon to his partner's throat and threatened to kill her. The woman managed to \"calm down\" the defendant and disarm him, and she later texted her mother to tell her what had happened. It is thought the mum then alerted the police and an officer subsequently tried to call the victim.\nWhen the defendant saw an unknown number calling his partner he attacked her again, grabbing the knife again and delivering multiple blows to her chest and back. The final of the seven blows was delivered with such force that the blade of the knife was left embedded in her back. The victim managed to crawl out of the flat but not before she had apologised to her 57-year-old attacker, an apology to which he replied by saying \"I will get a slap on the wrist because I have got mental health\".\nChandler was sentenced to 14 years in prison. The defendant will serve two-thirds of the sentence in custody before being released on licence to serve the remainder in the community.\nPhillip Hanley\nPhillip Hanley, 34, launched an unprovoked knife attack on a friend after going back to the victim's flat and using his washing machine. He repeatedly stabbed his friend in the legs and knees with a kitchen knife in what a judge described as a \"cruel and calculated\" attack that was \"almost in the realms of sadistic behaviour\".\nSwansea Crown Court heard the defendant has little recollection of the incident due to his use of crack cocaine but he is now taking steps to tackle his addiction and address the \"demons\" in his life. At the time of the attack the the defendant was subject to a community order for threatening a Tesco manager and offering to fight him after he had been challenged about his shoplifting.\nThe court heard the attack came without warning Hanley then picked up a kitchen knife and demanded the victim's wallet before stabbing the seated man multiple times in both legs. The victim got to his feet and tried to push his assailant away, and Hanley slashed out at his hands with the knife. Hanley then left the house and the bleeding and crying man went to a neighbour to ask for help. The woman called police and it was the officers who took the injured man to hospital.\nWhen Hanley was arrested some of his clothes had blood stains on them, and this blood was subsequently matched to the victim. He was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison.\nCorey-Jay Thomas\nCorey-Jay Thomas, 18, stabbed a man with a Rambo knife as his friend Jay Jones, 22, kicked the victim's girlfriend in the face. The male victim's intestines protruded through the wound and the female victim suffered a fractured jaw and cheekbone.\nattacked Justin Jenkins and Gemma Maidment in Caerphilly town centre in the early hours of May 14. The assaults involved a third attacker Jessie Watson, 19, who walked up to the couple in the shopping precinct and accused them of \"having beef\".\nMs Maidment was taking to the floor by Watson who punched Watson repeatedly before Jones ran up to her and kicked her in the face, knocking her unconscious. Mr Jenkins was stabbed with the Rambo knife by Thomas, which caused a 5cm wound to his abdomen and resulted in his intestines protruding through the injury. The defendant's made their way back to Jones' mother's house and the knife was disposed of in a nearby garden path.\nThe court heard Mr Jenkins required five blood transfusions as a result of the attack, and Ms Maidment sustained a fractured jaw and a suspected fractured cheekbone. Thomas was sentenced to six years detention in a young offenders' institute, and Jay Jones was sentenced to four years imprisonment.\nKathryn Llewelyn and Teresa Morgan-Peters\nKathryn Llewelyn, 43, and Teresa Morgan-Peters, 45 broke into a neighbour's flat in the dead of night and poured bleach over her before repeatedly slashing her to the face and body with a knife. The pair wore wore \"ghoulish\" masks and remained silent during the shocking raid, which was apparently prompted by a dispute over comments made on social media.\nSwansea Crown Court heard the victim has been left with scars to her face, legs, and arms, and feels \"sick\" when she sees her reflection. She described how she was living in a nightmare from which she could not escape, and is living a life of \"fear, embarrassment and shame\".\nThe defendants had denied carrying out the sickening attack in Ystradgynlais in the Swansea Valley - each effectively blaming the other - but were convicted at trial. A judge described what the women did as \"truly disturbing\" and as a \"punishment beating\".\nLlewelyn and Morgan-Peters were each sentenced to 10 years in prison. They will serve up two-thirds of those sentences in custody before being released on licence to serve the remainder in the community. They were also each made the subject of life-long restraining orders banning them from contacting their victim.\nChristopher Burgess\nChristopher Burgess, 33, launched a vicious attack on his partner which saw him run a knife across the top of her head and spit at her. When she tried to leave, he dragged her back inside a property and threw her inside onto the staircase, before locking the door behind him.\nThe defendant \"grabbed and punched\" the victim with both hands to the face, called her names, grabbed her by the hair, wrists and arms. He then took hold of a knife, poking the woman with it, before running the knife across the top of her head. He also spat at her and grabbed her by the throat until \"she began to gurgle\".\nShe persuaded him to allow her to leave to collect her children, which she did, and at the school, she reported the incident to staff and police were called, resulting in the school being locked down. The victim was examined at the accident and emergency department at the University Hospital of Wales, and found to have skin and hair missing from the top of her head, clotted blood, haematomas, bruising, grazes and pain on swallowing. An X-Ray revealed she had a fractured wrist and a fractured eye socket.\nBurgessof, Tidenham Road, Caerau, Cardiff was jailed for 29 months. A restraining order has been made preventing him from coming into direct or indirect contact with the victim.\nSteven Roxberry\nSteven Roxberry, 34, slashed a stranger with a knife in an unprovoked attack on the street causing \"highly unpleasant injuries\" which exposed the fat under the skin. He attacked his victim with a Stanley-type knife in the middle of the afternoon, then kicked him in the face after he stumbled while trying to escape.\nThe defendant has a long history of serious offending including raping a child when he was a teenager, robbery, possession of offensive weapons, and inflicting grievous harm. Giving him an extended sentence as a dangerous offender the judge said he had an \"extremely concerning record\" which showed a \"preparedness to attack people for no reason and inflict grave injuries upon them\".\nThe incident happened in Carmarthen town centre. The victim and his ex-partner walked past a group of males standing outside Boot's the chemists one of the group - Roxberry - started to follow them. The man challenged the defendant and asked what he was doing, and a \"verbal altercation\" ensued. The court heard that Roxberry was carrying a rucksack and a \"partially deflated football\" and his behaviour was described by witnesses as \"odd\".\nThe defendant then produced a Stanley-type knife from the rucksack and made \"swiping\" motions towards his victim, catching the man on the arm. The victim tried to run away but stumbled and fell to the ground, and Roxberry then began kicking the man in the face as he lay on the floor.\nRoxberry was given a 1 0-and-a-half year extended sentence as a dangerous offender comprising five-and-a-half years in custody followed by an extended five-year licence period. The defendant must serve two-thirds of the custodial element of his sentence for he can apply for release but it will be for the Parole Board to determine if he is safe to be let out.\nNikkola Lewis\nNikkola Lewis, 42, slashed her ex-partner with a knife when he intervened in a drunken confrontation between her and a friend. She left the victim with a deep gash on one arm which exposed the underlying muscle and required plastic surgery to repair.\nThe defendant had multiple previous convictions for offences of violence for which she has always been dealt with by sentences of non-immediate custody. Swansea Crown Court heard a noisy \"commotion\" could be heard coming from the defendant's flat in Neath. Lewis' former partner was visiting his brother who lived in the same block and, concerned at what may be going on upstairs, he went to investigate. When the ex entered the defendant's flat he found Lewis and a female friend involved in argument. Lewis was holding a Stanley-type knife while her friend had a pair of scissors.\nThe ex-partner tried to intervene but Lewis \"lunged forward\" and the victim immediately felt a pain in his arm and saw blood pour from a gash. The victim left the flats and rang 999 but by chance a friend was driving past the address in his car and he drove the bleeding man to Morriston Hospital. Meanwhile police had arrived at the flats and found the 42-year-old defendant \"unsteady on her feet and slurring her words\". Officers recovered a craft knife with blood stains on it from the property.\nWith a one-third discount for her guilty plea Lewis was sentenced to 16 months in prison. She will serve up to half that sentence in custody before being released on licence to serve the remainder in the community.\nKyle Lloyd\nKyle Lloyd, 32, slashed his best friend across the neck with a blade during a drink and drug-fuelled altercation. It is thought the defendant used a craft type-knife to cut his mate, causing two wounds which required stitches and staples to close.\nSwansea Crown Court heard Lloyd and a friend were drinking whisky and Stella lager and taking cannabis and crack cocaine at the defendant's home in the Afan Valley. The day progressed Lloyd became increasingly angry and aggressive as he talked about his partner and children. The pair ended up scuffling with Lloyd's friend telling him to calm down and stop shouting at him as he was \"the only mate he had left\".\nWhen the confrontation ended the friend realised there was blood on his neck, and when he checked he found two large lacerations. The court heard though no weapon was seen, the victim believed Lloyd was in the habit of carrying a Stanley-type blade. The victim did not initially report the incident but the following day was persuaded to go to hospital in Bridgend where 17 stitches were used to close one of the wounds, while the other was closed with staples.\nWith a 20 per cent discount for his guilty plea, Lloyd was sentenced to two years in prison. He will serve up to half that period in custody before being released on licence to serve the remainder in the community.\nYou can sign up to our regular Crime and Punishment newsletter here while this interactive tool allows you to check the latest crime statistics for your area:",
