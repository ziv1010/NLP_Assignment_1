Meanwhile, shares in major Chinese tech companies were down and the S&P Global Clean Energy index was trading down more than 6%.\n8:34 a.m. Wall Street is set for a big day following Trump's resounding electoral victory. The VIX index, which measures market volatility, fell to its lowest level since September. The dollar index hit its highest level since July.\nIn Asia, the Nikkei Stock Average closed Wednesday up 2.61%, while the Hang Seng index fell 2.23%.\n6:00 a.m. In a cascade, major U.S. networks project Trump to be the winner of Wisconsin and thus the presidential election, exceeding the needed 270 electoral college votes. Several other states are still counting.\n4:07 a.m. World leaders have begun congratulating Trump. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi posts a message to the Republican on X, saying, \"As you build on the successes of your previous term, I look forward to renewing our collaboration.\" And as questions swirl over how Trump will deal with Russia and its Ukraine invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praises Trump's \"impressive victory\" and says he appreciates his \"commitment to the 'peace through strength' approach in global affairs.\"\n\"This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer,\" Zelenskyy says. \"I am hopeful that we will put it into action together.\"\n3:02 a.m. Trump declares a \"magnificent victory for the American people\" at his campaign headquarters in Palm Beach, Florida, adding that nobody expected the number of seats the Republicans won in the Senate.

Democracy and the economy rank as the most important issues for voters by far, with around one-third of respondents citing each, followed by abortion and immigration at 14% and 11%, respectively, the data shows.\n4:44 p.m. A U.S. judge on Tuesday denies a bid by Republicans to block seven counties in the battleground state of Georgia from accepting some absentee ballots, and chides the party's lawyers for what he termed discrimination against political opponents.\nThe Republican National Committee on Sunday sued the seven counties in federal court for letting voters return absentee ballots over the weekend and on Monday. They said early voting was supposed to close on Friday.\nU.S. District Judge Stan Baker, a Trump appointee, says those counties all leaned Democratic in previous elections, and that the RNC \"cherry picked\" the counties \"based on nothing more than the past political preferences of the citizens.\"\n4:35 p.m. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closes up 1%, marking the fifth consecutive presidential election day it has gained ground.

Tim Walz, assures voters that the election will be fair and accurate even if a final result takes longer than expected.\n\"We have the freest, most fair elections. It's going to take some time to get results. They're going to go up, down, up, down. But at the end of the day we will get results that we know are accurate,\" he tells reporters in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he was campaigning before getting on a plane to Washington.\n3:01 p.m. The FBI says fake bomb threats were made to polling sites in several states from email domains that appear to originate from Russia.

It's in big trouble in many ways, and we have to straighten it out,\" he says, with his wife, Melania Trump, at his side.\n12:30 p.m. At a polling site in Bethesda, Maryland, a heavily Democratic area, Trump's stance on immigration impresses one voter while Harris' support for reproductive rights sways another.\nAlthough Maryland is thousands of kilometers from the southern border, Declan Leary, a 25-year-old white writer, says he voted for the former president because every state is a border state.\n\"They may come into Texas, but they go to every state,\" he says, adding that he believes Republican and Democratic politicians succumb to pressure from corporate donors to keep the borders open so that companies can hire cheap labor. \"Trump is different.\"\nChris, a 19-year-old Black student at Howard University, Harris' alma mater, and first-time voter, says he voted for the vice president because of her support for reproductive freedom.\n\"Most issues go away after four years but birth and abortion are a life-changing matter,\" he said.\n12 p.m. Trump's tough talk on China is resonating with some Asian American voters in New York's Chinatown neighborhood, located in Manhattan.\n\"Trump can control China,\" says Jimmy Truong, 37, a Vietnamese American who voted for the first time. Truong says he worries about what Trump tariffs might do to Vietnamese imports, but adds controlling China is \"more important.\"\nSero Chin, 58, is from Hong Kong and has has lived in the U.S. for more than 30 years, but says she only decided to apply for citizenship to vote for Trump in this election.\n\"After Trump came out I have a sensation of belonging in America,\" she says, citing communism, illegal immigration and rising crime in New York City as her biggest policy concerns.\n8 a.m. Asian Americans are the fastest-growing voting block in the U.S., numbering around 15 million, and could play an important role in deciding the battleground states of Georgia and Nevada.\nA September survey commissioned by APIAVote and AAPI Data found that 66% of Asian Americans would vote for Harris while 28% supported Trump. Harris, the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, would be the first president of Asian-American ancestry, if elected.\nAsian American community leaders say Democrats have been more active than Republicans this year in reaching out to Asian voters, pointing to a nationwide series of Harris campaign advertisements in different Asian languages. The Republican Party, by contrast, shut down some of the Nevada community centers it had set up in 2022 to help members of minority groups register to vote.\n7 a.m. According to ad tracking firm AdImpact, the top issue mentioned in Trump's television advertisements was inflation, whereas Harris' was taxation.\nAn accounting of ads between July and October showed Trump also highlighting the economy, housing, immigration and crime. Harris also focused on health care, housing, abortion and crime.\nIn Trump's most-aired ad, titled \"Prices,\" Harris is seen saying, \"Everyday prices are too high,\" citing prices of food, rent, gas and back-to- school clothes. \"A loaf of bread costs 50% more today,\" she says.\nHarris also appeared in her campaign's most frequently run ad, saying: \"As a prosecutor, I never asked a victim or a witness, are you a Republican or a Democrat? The only thing I ever asked them, are you OK?\"\n6 a.m. Harris will spend election night at her alma mater, Howard University. Graduates of the private, historically black university have included Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and Nobel Literature Prize laureate Toni Morrison, but never a president.\nTrump will have a watch party at Palm Beach Convention Center in Florida, not far from his Mar a Lago estate. In 2016, Trump celebrated his election victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in New York. In 2020, Trump held an election night event in Washington.\nNov. 4\n10 p.m. Billionaires Bill Gates and Mark Cuban, actors Harrison Ford and Arnold Schwarzenegger, actress Scarlett Johansson, musicians Taylor Swift, Madonna and Jennifer Lopez and basketball star LeBron James are some of the celebrities who have endorsed Harris.\nBillionaires Elon Musk and Bill Ackman, actors Mel Gibson and Jon Voight, retired American football star Brett Favre, and former astronaut Buzz Aldrin are among some of the famous figures who have endorsed Trump.\n7 p.m. The battle to reach the required 270 electoral vote threshold could technically end in a 269-269 tie. In this case, the decision would go to the newly elected House of Representatives.\nEach state delegation would have one vote. A majority of states -- 26 of 50 -- is needed to win. Senators, in turn, would elect the vice president.\nThe Congress meets in a joint session on Jan. 6, 2025, to count the electoral votes.\n4 p.m. More than 81 million votes had been cast by late Monday, with women accounting for 54% of the electorate among states reporting data, a gender gap seen as a good sign for Harris, who has made abortion rights a centerpiece of her campaign.\nBy party, 38% of the early voters were registered Democrats, 36% were registered Republicans and 26% were independents or members of smaller parties. A relatively larger share of the early voters included Republicans, which could be helpful for Trump.\nIn 2016, 47 million voters cast ballots before election day. In 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic raised the risk of going to the polls, 101 million people voted early.",
