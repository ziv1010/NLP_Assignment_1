Name, Image and Likeness will still be in play, but now anything over $600 will need to be approved by an NCAA Clearinghouse, meaning some of the larger deals will be harder to broker and more in the open, or else, face penalties of some sort.\nThis impacts all schools, big and large, but significantly restructures and reorganizes efforts in recruiting, NIL, and roster management at the biggest of schools and football factories like Ohio State. So then, wouldn't it be interesting to see what those in the suits on the banks of the Olentangy have to say about the development that was a long time coming? Sure it would.\nAnd, on that note, Ohio State Athletic Director Ross Bjork did provide a statement to the media in preparation for a further press conference later this week that puts a straw man template in place for the position he'll take to lead the OSU program through the changes coming.\n“The signing of the House settlement Friday by Judge Claudia Wilken will reshape collegiate athletics. Ohio State and schools around the country will now be permitted to directly compensate student-athletes through revenue sharing, which is actually institutional NIL rights,\" Bjork said in a statement. \"The Department of Athletics will fully fund the revenue sharing program, which will total $20.5 million and includes funding for additional scholarships for both women’s and men’s sports. We remain committed to maintaining the student-athlete model, offering 36 intercollegiate sports and providing scholarships to all 36.”\nThere will be more to come at the presser later this week, but we can take a couple of things from his statement. First, the revenue sharing program will be fully funded by the Department of Athletics. Maybe this was a foregone conclusion, but it does raise questions on several logistics like the proverbial how, when, and where this will all happen.\nSecondly, the amount of funding looks like it has been outlined. Maybe things will change a little north or south of this number (again, we'll find out more Thursday), but the total looks to be $20.5 million.\n“The signing of the House settlement Friday by Judge Claudia Wilken will reshape collegiate athletics.

The…\n— Ohio State Buckeyes 🌰 (@OhioStAthletics) June 9, 2025\nAlso, and very important, many had to wonder if this new model would mean the loss of scholarships and other athletic programs of some of the non-revenue sports. It looks like there will be an effort to keep all 36 sports with both men and women, all funded through the model. Maybe that's too optimistic, maybe not -- we'll have to again take a wait and see approach and wait to hear, see, and feel more.\nThis is a nugget of interesting news, and this is, of course, only the tip of the iceberg of what we'll find out in the coming days, weeks, and months.\nContact/Follow us @BuckeyesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Ohio State news, notes and opinion.
