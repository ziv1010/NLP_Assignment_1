Having come into the England squad since Euro 2022, she has established herself as an important player in Sarina Wiegman’s setup and now has the opportunity to light up the world stage as a starter on the right flank in the absence of Beth Mead.\nAlthough it may seem like a rapid ascent, it has been a slow burn for James that started when she gambled by leaving home aged 16 to join Manchester United.\nJames was part of the original United squad recruited when the club reformed a senior women’s team in 2018, making the move to the north west on her own and leaving Arsenal.\nUnited boss Casey Stoney went on to say that she had never seen a player so talented in the women’s game before encountering James. From the age of 16 and 17, she was getting regular playing time, scoring 17 goals in 27 appearances in 2018/19, an opportunity that was more valuable than playing junior football or sitting on Arsenal’s bench – even if it was at a lower level.\nREAD THE LATEST LIONESSES NEWS HERE\n“It was weird at first, I was 16,” James said of trading home for Manchester.\n“But without making that move, I probably wouldn’t be where I am now. People would say it was a step back because I went to the Championship, but sometimes it allows you to take steps forward and maybe I wouldn’t be here without it.\n“Days off [were tough], being away from my friends and family in London. It’s a lot of distance, sometimes you’re too tired and it takes it out you when you just want to hop on the train to go back. [But] living alone allowed me to grow up as a person.”\nCome 2021, James was the subject of a WSL record transfer that took her back to first club Chelsea, where she had been until the age of 13 and supported growing up. But, having suffered with frustrating injuries during her last season at United and struggling to overcome them, she was wrapped in cotton wool by Emma Hayes and afforded the time she needed.\n“She’s played massive role in just getting me back to being myself again,” James said of Hayes’ impact on her breakout for club and country over the last 12 months.\n“I had two years of injuries and she managed me well, allowing me to find my feet again. In the moment, it was like, ‘Why is Lauren not playing?’ In the long run, it’s obviously played out and kept me on the pitch this season.”\nWATCH NOW\nRachel O’Sullivan and Sophie Downey from Girls on the Ball speak exclusively to England and Chelsea defender Niamh Charles for this special episode of 90min Talks on location at England’s training hub St George’s Park.\nMan City’s Laura Coombs and Brighton’s Katie Robinson give us their reactions to making the squad. Plus former Spurs and Crystal Palace goalkeeper Chloe Morgan joins us to discuss who will win the World Cup.",
