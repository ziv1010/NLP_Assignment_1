  "body_text": "If anything, the way the Subway Series unfolded this week — a convincing Mets victory on Tuesday, a passable Yankees victory on Wednesday — was fitting for their strange, disappointing seasons in 2023 that sometimes don’t make any sense at all.\nJust when a spark ignites, it’s quickly extinguished. Just when it seems the Mets or Yankees are headed for the type of disaster where they can only beat teams like the Royals, A’s or Marlins, they find a way to make the playoff dream seem reasonable again.\nWednesday wasn’t a thrilling victory for the Yankees. It was a satisfactory second act to the promising development earlier in the day that Aaron Judge is likely will return Friday in Baltimore.\nThey only had six hits, and they still had costly miscues, such as when DJ LeMahieu crept away from third base on a pitch in the dirt and was tagged out in a rundown. But Carlos Rodon threw 5 ⅔ innings for his first victory of the season, turning the kiss saga and frustration from his last start into fist pumps and f-bomb punctuation to strikeouts.",
