  "body_text": "Cabinet minister admits betting three times on election date\nA Cabinet minister has admitted betting on the date of the general election, deepening the gambling scandal in Westminster.\nOn Tuesday night, Alister Jack, the Scottish Secretary, said he had placed three bets on the date of the general election, one of which was successful.\nHe denied earlier reports that he had won £2,100 on a wager, as he tried to dismiss the remarks, reported by the BBC, as a “joke” and said that the gambling watchdog had not contacted him.\nMr Jack said in a statement released just after 10pm: “Following reports today I want to be absolutely clear I have not breached any gambling rules. I placed two unsuccessful bets on the date of the general election and one successful one.\n“I put two bets on in March of £5 each for an election to be held in May and June respectively. In April, I put £20 at 5 to 1 on an election being held between July and September. I had no knowledge of the date of the election until the day it was called. As I have said previously, I placed no bets in May and am not under investigation by the Gambling Commission.”\nMr Sunak will come under pressure to act over Mr Jack’s gambling, regardless of the timing of the bets. In a day of fast-moving developments, the Conservatives suspended two candidates over allegations that they placed bets on the date of the election, with the Prime Minister criticised for failing to act sooner.\nRussell George, the Tories’ deputy chief whip in Wales, became the fifth party figure to be publicly named as part of the investigation and Labour was dragged into the growing scandal as it suspended one of its own candidates who put a wager on himself losing his seat.\nMeanwhile, Scotland Yard confirmed that the Gambling Commission was looking at five more police officers over election bets, as The Telegraph revealed on Monday, after one from Mr Sunak’s close protection team was arrested.\nMr Jack, who is standing down at the election, was said to have told the BBC that he made £2,100 out of betting on June and July election dates, reportedly saying that one wager was placed at odds of 25/1.\nThe corporation said that when it followed up on the comments, which were made before the betting scandal emerged two weeks ago, he said they were “a joke” and “I was pulling your leg”.\nIn an initial statement the Scottish Secretary said: “I am very clear that I have never, on any occasion, broken any Gambling Commission rules.\n“Specifically, I did not place any bets on the date of the general election during May, the period under investigation by the Gambling Commission.”\nHowever, following pressure to be clear about his betting – including from the SNP, who said Mr Jack had a “duty to come forward with the full details” – Mr Jack admitted he had bet on the election date three times.\nMr Jack is not a candidate for the Tories at the election and is no longer an MP in Dumfries and Galloway because Parliament has been dissolved for the election.\nHowever, ministers continue to serve in their posts during an election period, meaning that he could potentially be sacked by Mr Sunak from his Cabinet post.\nThe SNP said Mr Jack had a “duty to come forward with the full details”, with the party’s Scotland spokesman Tommy Sheppard saying: “As a senior cabinet member in the Tory government, and a well-known confidant of Sunak, Jack is obviously in the loop when it comes to Conservative Party planning.\n“Alister Jack has a duty to come forward with the full details of precisely what bets he placed on the election and when the public deserve answers immediately.”\nWhen approached for comment, the Tories pointed to Mr Jack’s statement, but the Prime Minister will face pressure to act quickly following criticism of how long it took to suspend Tories accused of being involved in the gambling scandal.\nOn Tuesday night it emerged that Mr George, a member of the Welsh Assembly, is the fifth Tory being looked at by the Gambling Commission.\nIn the Senedd he represents Montgomeryshire – the same area served by Craig Williams, the Conservative MP who has admitted betting on the election.\nWelsh Tory ‘steps back’\nAndrew RT Davies, the Welsh Tory leader, confirmed that Mr George was under investigation and had “stepped back” from his role as deputy chief whip.\n“All other members of the Welsh Conservative Group have confirmed that they have not placed any bets,” he said in a statement.\nHis announcement came after the Conservatives suspended two MP candidates over allegations that they placed bets on the date of the snap election.\nThe party withdrew support for Mr Williams and Laura Saunders following an internal inquiry into their actions.\nMs Saunders is married to Tony Lee, the Tory party’s director of campaigning, who is also being investigated, as is Nick Mason, its head of data.\nGeorge Osborne, the former chancellor, said the failure to suspend the two candidates sooner suggested Mr Sunak was not a “real political leader”.\nSteve Baker, the Northern Ireland minister, called for those who placed bets on the election date to be suspended by the party on Monday night, saying “the Prime Minister would have to answer” for why he had not acted by then.\nSir Keir Starmer said Mr Sunak had failed to “grasp the nettle”, telling the Independent on Tuesday: “If they had been my candidates, they’d have been straight out of the door and their feet wouldn’t have touched the floor, but to wait a week, to make excuses like that, is inexcusable.”\nLater in the day his pledge materialised as the party withdrew support for one of its candidates after being informed that he was being investigated by the Gambling Commission.\nKevin Craig later admitted making the bet “a few weeks ago”, saying it had been a “stupid error of judgement” and he had planned to give any winnings to local charities.\nThe party took action so quickly that his campaign team were unaware that he was no longer a candidate when initially contacted by The Telegraph.\nMr Craig was selected by Labour to contest Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, a Tory stronghold with a majority of more than 23,000.\nIn a statement he said: “While I did not place this bet with any prior knowledge of the outcome, this was a huge mistake, for which I apologise unreservedly.\n“I deeply regret what I have done and will take the consequences of this stupid error of judgement on the chin. I will comply fully with the investigation.”\nMr Craig, an expert in crisis management, will still appear on the ballot paper for Labour as the legal deadline for registering candidates has passed, but if he wins the constituency on July 4 he will sit in Parliament as an independent MP.\nA Labour spokesman said: “With Keir Starmer as leader, the Labour Party upholds the highest standards for our parliamentary candidates, as the public rightly expects from any party hoping to serve, which is why we have acted immediately in this case.”\nIt is understood Mr Craig is the only Labour figure the Gambling Commission has been notified about in relation to its election betting investigation.\nEarlier this month it emerged he had donated £100,000 to the party, sparking accusations that he had bought his candidacy.\nHe separately gave £39,000 to Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, for his work in the role. Sources within the party said it will now give back all the money.\nThe Westminster-based communications company that he founded, PLMR, previously worked on the branding for Responsible Gambling Week.\nScotland Yard separately confirmed on Tuesday that five more police officers were being looked at by the Gambling Commission over election bets.\nLast week, a serving Met officer, who is a member of Mr Sunak’s close protection team, was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office after allegedly placing a bet on the election date. The officer has been placed on restricted duties.\nBoth party leaders are set to face questions on the betting scandal on Wednesday night as they face each other in the final election debate on the BBC.\n10:00 PM BST\nThat’s all for today...\nThanks for following today’s general election liveblog.\nMy colleague Jack Maidment will be back tomorrow morning to bring you the latest.\n09:54 PM BST\nSir Keir Starmer seated next to King’s principle private secretary at state banquet\nSir Keir Starmer was seated next to the King’s right-hand man, Sir Clive Alderton, at the state banquet held in honour of the visiting Emperor and Empress of Japan.\nSir Clive is the principal private secretary to the King and Queen, and the former diplomat is the couple’s most important aide.\nRishi Sunak and Sir Ed Davey were also present at the event, along with Kemi Badenoch and Simon Case, the Cabinet Secretary.\n09:21 PM BST\nSNP: Alister Jack must ‘come forward with the full details’ on reported betting claims\nThe SNP said Alister Jack has a “duty to come forward with the full details” after it was reported he claimed to have won more than £2,000 betting on the July election date.\nThe party’s Scotland spokesman Tommy Sheppard said: “As a senior Cabinet member in the Tory government, and a well-known confidant of Sunak, Jack is obviously in the loop when it comes to Conservative Party planning.\n“Alister Jack has a duty to come forward with the full details of precisely what bets he placed on the election and when – the public deserve answers immediately.”\n09:08 PM BST\nIn pictures: Politicians attend state banquet for Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako\n08:50 PM BST\nWelsh Labour calls on Welsh Tory leader to suspend Russell George\nWelsh Labour has called on Andrew RT Davies to suspend Russell George after it emerged he had been contacted by the Gambling Commission over alleged betting on the date of the election.\nJessica Morden, Welsh Labour Campaign chair, said: “It took Rishi Sunak almost two weeks to take action on one of his Conservative candidates.\n“How long will it take Andrew RT Davies to suspend Russell George?”\n08:37 PM BST\nWhy Labour’s electric car crusade risks crushing Britain’s auto industry\nSir Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, Sue Gray, is said to keep a “s--- list” of potential crises that a Labour government may face if the party wins power next week, Matt Oliver writes.\nNow, the former civil servant may be wearily adding another: the closure of two major UK car factories.\nThe threat issued by Stellantis – the automotive giant behind Vauxhall, Citroen and Peugeot – will be an early test of resolve for a government under Starmer, who currently looks set for a thumping victory on July 4.\nRead more from The Telegraph’s Industry Editor here\n08:21 PM BST\nCar crashes into gates of Chequers estate\nA car has crashed into the barriers at the entrance to Chequers, Rishi Sunak’s official country residence, local police have said.\nThe incident occurred shortly after midday on Tuesday, and the driver has been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and drink driving.\nA spokesman for Thames Valley Police said in a statement: “A white Volkswagen Scirocco hit the barriers at the entrance to Chequers shortly after midday.\n“The driver, a 44-year-old man from Buckinghamshire, who was the only occupant, suffered serious injuries and has been taken to hospital, where he remains.\n“He has also been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and drink-driving.\n“While we are still in the very early stages of our investigation, there is currently no evidence to suggest there was any intention to harm anyone.”\n08:14 PM BST\nParty leaders wish England luck in Euros match against Slovenia\nCome on England!

It is the Gambling Commission, not the media, that has the responsibility, powers and resources to properly investigate these matters and determine what, if any, action should be taken.\n“I have stepped back from the shadow cabinet while the investigation is ongoing. I have done this as I do not wish to be an unnecessary distraction to their work.”\nAndrew RT Davies, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, confirmed that Mr George had stepped back and added: “All other Members of the Welsh Conservative Group have confirmed that they have not placed any bets.”\n07:44 PM BST\nCabinet minister ‘claimed to have won more than £2k on July election bets’\nA Cabinet minister reportedly claimed that he won more than £2,000 betting on a July general election.\nAlister Jack, the Scottish Secretary, reportedly told the BBC shortly after Rishi Sunak called the election that he had made £2,100 after betting on June and July election dates.\nMr Jack then told the BBC the comments were “a joke” and that he was “pulling your leg”.\nHe then told the broadcaster on Tuesday that he had not placed any bets on the general election date “in May”.

These quotes in The Telegraph make it really clear.”\nYvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said migrants would be “disappointed” if they believed they would get an easy ride under a Labour government.\nShe said: “I think people are going to be disappointed if they think that because Labour is going to introduce a new Border Security Command that will smash the criminal gang networks that are currently organising these dangerous boat crossings that are undermining our border security and putting lives at risk.”\n09:37 AM BST\nCleverly and Cooper clash over Labour plan for closer working with EU on immigration\nJames Cleverly claimed Labour’s plan to increase cooperation with the EU on tackling illegal immigration would result in the UK having to accept more people from the continent.\nMs Cooper told an LBC debate on immigration this morning: “We have said very clearly we won’t join the EU member states’ quota scheme. That wouldn’t be right for the UK.\n“What we should be doing is sharing intelligence on things like who has already claimed asylum and been turned down in other countries. At the moment we don’t know that so we can’t even then swiftly return them.”\nMr Cleverly said: “The arrangement that you are talking about will inevitably mean the UK becomes a net recipient of illegal migrants.

The Tories have “committed to bringing down levels of immigration which have been too high”, he said, as he reiterated the Conservative pledge to stop the boats.\nHe said that was in “stark contrast” to Labour who had “voted against these measures time and time again”.\nMs Cooper said that “everything is broken” and that under the Tories “net migration has trebled” in recent years.\nPointing to ministerial turnover at the Home Office, she said that under the Conservatives the “chaos has just got worse, and worse and worse”.\n09:03 AM BST\nComing up: Cleverly and Cooper clash in immigration debate\nJames Cleverly, the Home Secretary, and his Labour shadow Yvette Cooper are set to square off in a radio debate on immigration.\nThe pair will take part in an event hosted by LBC imminently.

We’ve never hidden from that.”\nAsked if Labour would have to raise taxes, cut spending or borrow more, Mr Thomas-Symonds said: “We will put that plan on the table, of stability, of investment and of reform. The Office of Budget Responsibility will then look at it so it will be robust, and the snapshot in the autumn will be different. It will then be about growth.\n“And that is why, by the way, so that we don’t have to make these trade-offs.

There was the manifesto itself, and there was a separate costing document, as you would expect, and as the Prime Minister has said, each and every one of our measures is fully costed.\n“You’ve begun to see, I think, the economy turning a corner. You’ve begun to see the fruits of the hard work that the Prime Minister has put in with inflation falling from over 11 per cent back down to 2 per cent to normal levels, we’ve got interest rates cut just around the corner, and we’re beginning to see the economy turning the corner, and all of our measures within our manifesto are fully costed.”\n08:31 AM BST\nKwarteng feels ‘partially responsible’ for Tory struggles\nKwasi Kwarteng said he feels “partially responsible” for the position the Conservative Party currently finds itself in.\nBut he made clear Rishi Sunak and others in the party also needed to shoulder the blame for the Tories being so far behind Labour in the opinion polls.\nMr Kwarteng delivered Liz Truss’s mini-Budget in September 2022 which ultimately led to the chaotic end of her premiership the following month.\nAsked if he felt responsible for the Tories’ current position, the former chancellor told GB News: “I feel partially responsible but I don’t feel responsible for leaving D-Day early, I don’t feel responsible for the Reform party which was on 4 per cent in October 2022 being on nearly 20 per cent now.\n“I don’t feel responsible for the election betting scandal nor do I feel responsible for the fact that this election has happened way before anyone was expecting it.”\n08:20 AM BST\nSunak looks defeated like Major in 1997, suggests Kwarteng\nRishi Sunak looks like Sir John Major in the run up to the 1997 general election when “everyone knew what the result would be”, Kwasi Kwarteng has suggested.\nThe former chancellor said the 2024 election campaign reminded him of the 1997 Labour landslide.\nThe senior Tory, who is not standing at the election, said there “could still be surprises” ahead of polling day on July 4 but he believed “you can see where the thing is going”.\nIt was suggested to Mr Kwarteng during an interview on GB News that Mr Sunak was campaigning every day despite knowing that he is not going to win.\nMr Kwarteng replied: “I think it is very difficult for him, for any prime minister. The only thing I can remember which is similar was 1997 when you kind of knew that Labour would get in and I think John Major and the Cabinet, they looked pretty tired and they were going out to campaign and everyone knew what the result would be.\n“It feels a bit like that this year. There could still be surprises, we don’t know. But at the moment, when you have got Cabinet ministers warning about Labour supermajorities, I think Jeremy Hunt and Grant Shapps have mentioned that, you can see where the thing is going.”\n08:00 AM BST\nMinister wants election gambling investigations to conclude ‘as quickly as possible’\nMichael Tomlinson said he wanted the investigations into the Tory general election betting scandal to be finished “swiftly”.\nThe Gambling Commission is looking into the allegations while the Conservative Party is also conducting its own internal inquiry.\nThe minister for countering illegal migration told Sky News: “I want this to happen as quickly as possible.

You do have to put them in that order. That is pretty normal to put them in that order.\n“I understand the timing is terrible. It is terrible for Rishi himself and he is obviously very angry about it as we all are. But you do have to get the facts established and then take the appropriate action based on what they tell us that is.”",
