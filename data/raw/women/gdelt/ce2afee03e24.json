  "body_text": "Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts wasn’t trying to make a statement when he hired an all-female management team to help manage his career both on and off the football field.\n“It’s just something that happened very organically,” Hurts, 26, said in a Thursday, February 6, press conference ahead of the 2025 Super Bowl. “[I was] really just seeking out the best and that’s how it happened.”\nHe continued, “I have a lot of confidence in my team and everyone that supports [me]. Everyone puts their best foot forward [and] they do a great job of being intentional. And honestly, for me, it’s an eye that I don’t have. I’m able to lean on [them] in certain situations, and so that’s something I value heavily.”\nHurts, who was drafted by the Eagles in 2020, has long praised inclusivity in sports, starting with hiring his agent, Nicole Lynn.\n“I admire anyone who puts their head down and works for what they want,” Hurts told Sports Illustrated in August 2022. “I know women who do that daily, but they don’t get the same praise as men — they don’t get the praise that they deserve. I’ve seen that now with tons of different women in my life [who] are hustlers. Athletes, coaches, women in the business world of sports. I see it all the time. And they deserve their flowers too. So if me saying something about it brings more attention to it, then I’m all for that.”\nHurts signed with Lynn’s firm in 2020 after she messaged him on Instagram, asking whether he already picked an agent ahead of the NFL draft.\n“[It was] a total Hail Mary,” she recalled to Sports Illustrated at the time. “I didn’t expect him to even see it.”\nHurts, who was willing to hear Lynn’s pitch, invited her for a meeting alongside his father.\n“Jalen has a poker face. He doesn’t show a ton of emotion,” Lynn added.\nFor Hurts, he admired that he and Lynn shared the same work ethic and drive to succeed.\n“I saw that same fire in Nicole. She said, ‘I’m a woman. People are going to overlook me. People are going to doubt me. They’re not going to give me the due respect. But I’m overcoming it, just like you do,’” Hurts explained. “And that’s where we really hit it off. We had the same vision.”\nHurts is now gearing up to lead the Eagles in Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, February 9, against the Kansas City Chiefs — a rematch of the 2023 big game that ended in the Chiefs’ favor. Hurts is now hoping to disrupt their chance at a third consecutive Lombardi Trophy.",
