She obviously had a good season last year. They won the grand final. I was very happy for her,\" he said.\n\"She comes to watch me, and I go to watch her when I can. We're always there for each other.\"\nThe whole King family were in the Leichhardt Oval stands recently to watch Taren lead her Mariners into battle against Sydney FC.\n\"All of my family were there watching my sister versus Sydney on the weekend. It wasn't a great result for her, but for Sydney it was. I was happy Sydney won, but disappointed for her.\"\nThe 25-year-old has had plenty of reasons to be happy recently, playing a starring role in the first five rounds for the competition leaders, Sydney FC.\n\"I think I've been playing pretty well, obviously the results are going our way, so that helps a lot,\" King said.\n\"We've had a long pre-season, and I've done pretty well then, so I'm happy to keep my spot in the starting side.\n\"The last few games we've had a few wins. I think we're in a good spot at the moment, obviously a big game this weekend, and hopefully we can get another three points.\"\nSydney has seven competition points more than the ninth-placed Wanderers (5), but King knows you can throw form out the window whenever these two fierce derby rivals collide.\n\"The derbies are always different, they're always up for it, it's a form goes out the window type of game, so we're going to have to be up for it, and I'm sure we will be.\"\nJoel King is not the only Illawarra-born or raised footballer playing for Sydney FC. The defender's teammates include Helensburgh Thistles junior Gus Hoefsloot (goalkeeper) and 19-year-old Dapto Lakeside Lions junior Zac De Jesus.\nThere are also several Illawarra connections in Sydney FC's women's team.\nWollongong-born Figtree FC junior Mackenzie Hawkesby has won multiple premierships and championships with Sydney FC.\nThe 25-year-old midfielder was named in the Sydney FC 20th Anniversary Team.\nFellow Figtree FC junior Caley Tallon-Henniker and Coledale Waves junior Sofia Fante also play for the Sky Blues.\nGoalkeeper Fante is in the Young Matildas squad playing the Korea Republic in a two-match international friendly series at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) in Canberra this weekend.\nMore Illawarra sport:\nSydney FC's brightest young star is injured, Shellharbour junior Indiana Dos Santos.\nThe 18-year-old superstar is one of two Dos Santos sisters setting the A-League women's competition alight.\nHer 20-year-old sibling, Jynaya, plays for the Central Coast Mariners.
