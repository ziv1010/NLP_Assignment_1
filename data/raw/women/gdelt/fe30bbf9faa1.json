But between Division 6B college football and the Durham parkrun, there is the county’s only professional indoor sport outfit. Durham Palatinates, the women’s basketball team.\n“We’re kind of an offshoot of our BUCS programme” says Lee Davie, head of basketball at the club.\n“About ten years ago, we started recruiting post-graduate Americans to start raising the profile of basketball here within the university with the aim of trying to attract British undergraduates and postgraduates long term. Off the back of seeing the success we’ve had with the American postgraduates, Durham is a place where people can get a great education and play basketball to a high level. Once we got halfway down that strategy we entered what was formerly known as the Women’s Basketball League, which is the top professional women’s league in the country. It has just been rebranded as the Super Basketball League.”\n“With our hybrid model of five American postgraduates and five British students, we came together to compete at the highest level of basketball, giving our students the opportunity to play not just at a university level but play professional sport while getting their education. This was with the view that once they left, they had had the opportunity to transfer into traditional employment once they had achieved their professional sport dream. Or use this as an opportunity to put themselves in the shop window to then go out and play professional in other parts of the world.”\nDavie never played professionally himself, but has worked with three different age groups at England women’s level and also coached the under-20 women’s Great Britain squad. Over his 26 years of coaching, his accolades include a European silver medal and multiple BUCS championships.\nBut even for such an experienced coach, using the same player base for professional and university basketball certainly brings its challenges. As basketball’s epicentre is largely seen to exist in North America, overseas players have often proved pivotal to the club’s success.\n“We’ve had Americans, Spaniards, and Canadians. We’ve had more Canadians recently. Because of COVID everyone had extra years of eligibility, so to play collegiate sport over there you’re only eligible for four years, but because of COVID people would get an extra year or two. Because of this, as a department, our North American intakes took a massive hit since they were choosing to stay in the States with their extra year of eligibility to get their Masters degree.”\n“Foolishly, the Masters over there are two years and many of them only had an extra year, so they were starting their Masters and the University didn’t fund their second year. As a byproduct, all our sports have been down on North American intake. Because of that, we went to the Canadian pool, because they have five years and they normally stay in education. Australians, Spaniards, and French students too – we’ve had a vast difference over the years.”\n“In my time, we’ve had multiple players go out and play professionally in Sweden, Germany, France, Spain, Australia, and Mexico. So, it is working, and it’s a programme where there is generally something for everyone. If you are coming here fresh out of high school looking to take that next step, you’ve got the American postgraduates coming over who’ve been to play professional in Europe but then haven’t got the deal they wanted for whatever reason and instead of taking just any deal, ultimately I’ll need a degree or a Masters for when I’ve finished playing so then will come here for one or two years whilst continuing to play, maybe even transitioning out of basketball depending on their age, or go out into the rest of the world for another professional contract once they’ve got their degree.”\nOne of these Canadian postgraduate students is Sarah Wells. Hailing from the University of Vermont, she is looking to build on here four years’ experience there with a six-year part-time sport nutrition PhD in Durham.\n“I’ve found it really great. The transition was smooth and everyone in Durham has been really nice. I think I fit into the group really well. The game is a bit more physical in Canada – European basketball is always more skill and technicality based whereas in North America there is more pushing and physicality. That’s an interesting transition for me but I’m excited to start playing and seeing the competitions. I played in junior college for three years in Canada, before playing for four years at the University of Vermont in the US.”\n“The difference in skill depends on the day – the players with more international experience have a little more in their toolkit, but we contribute each other really well. I want to play basketball for as long as I can with the aim of completing this PhD so I could be an academic too.”\nDavie himself is well aware of the disparity in skill and experience between his freshers and postgraduates.\n“From a psychosocial standpoint, these 24-year-olds have been out to America and formed friendships – they’re used to that; leaving home to go and play at a high level. They’ve had two-a-day practices for four years. So physically there’s a massive difference to the undergraduates. I always bring it back to comparing a newborn and a four-year-old. As they get older, gaps close, but there is always a gap there.”\nDespite this, keeping undergraduates in the system is vital for the sustainability of the elite level basketball played here. Registration problems have meant the Palatinates have found it tough to establish a reliable team from the start of each season. Keeping homegrown players alleviates any risk of dropouts.\n“I’ve been heavily pro-undergraduate during our time in the professional league because we have a limit on how many overseas players we can have – as we can only have as many British as international students. But the issue we’re having that a lot of traditional sports share such as hockey is that we’re losing our best British undergraduates to the States since they can offer them the full academic ride of course fees and accommodation.”\nBut success has been coming. Last year, Durham snatched the ultimate success from the jaws of defeat.\n“We were in our last BUCS premier game of the year and we had to win to avoid relegation. We won, jumping from sixth to third with that one win. It’s a very competitive division. Then we got drawn against the second placed team in the South, Cardiff Metropolitan, who had only lost two games all year. We went down to Cardiff and beat them by twenty points, so then we were drawn against the top-placed team from the North, Loughborough. We went to Loughborough and beat them by fifteen points on their court, meaning we qualified for the BUCS final and played Essex who hadn’t lost a game all year. We beat them by twenty. Which means we’re current national champions for BUCS.”\n“It was a crazy year with all the struggles we’ve had early on. BUCS is always two competitions with the league and the knockout; the league is to set you up for the knockouts, so ultimately it’s all about peaking at the right time. From a WBBL standpoint we had a really good group. We didn’t really get going until January due to Visa processing but then we had a really strong push to finish seventh overall in the league, but we lost in the first round of the playoffs to Caledonia, who had a massive £20m investment to fund a purpose-built facility. They’re playing in the basketball equivalent of the Europa League, so their finances are that of a fully professional team. Overall, it was a really successful year. The BUCS champion has put the spotlight back on us and people have seen what we’re capable of with the right investment. Staff and students have no idea there is a women’s professional team here, so raising the profile internally and externally is a big goal for us this year.”\nDespite such a victory, the professional game remains a different kettle of fish. When asked about the possibility of the Palatinates challenging for Europe, Davie was conclusive in his evaluation of his team’s chances.\n“The level of finance just isn’t there. You’re talking about playing in Greece on a Wednesday night. It’s a long term thing and an infrastructure that needs to be in place. I’ve been here for twelve years now and I’m 43, so I’m starting to ask myself what the legacy is. BUCS Championships are nice but that’s not what true success is. I’m thinking about how to grow the programme and what can I leave in place when ultimately I am done. Can we raise the profile of women’s sports? Can we create a grassroots girls’ programme? We’ve linked with a local company who are working with kids from eighteen months to nine years old and we see that as a feeder pathway club to start our own performance teams at under twelve level for girls and bring them through all the way up to under eighteen so we have a steady flow of homegrown talent from County Durham that ultimately we want to attract tome come to the university to further their studies while also playing professional basketball.”\n“Basketball is the second largest participation sport in our country behind football. It’s huge, but for whatever reason it doesn’t have the same limelight as football and rugby. With our sport, you can take a ball and go to any local park and play by yourself.”\nBut the differences between the men’s and women’s games in this country make for different styles of the physical competition that make up the sport.\n“It’s easier to have success in the women’s game rather than the men’s game because in the men’s game, athleticism is such an x factor, whereas in the women’s game the athleticism is pretty standard. That means it comes down to skill. There are so many skilled women’s basketball players in our country and because of that the games are so exciting to watch. I’m really excited with the group we’ve got this year to exemplify how exciting women’s sport can be and if we can raise that profile and match the vision I think it will massively take off in County Durham. We’re the only professional indoor sport in the county. There’s women’s championship football but that’s outdoors. There are two teams in the North East with Newcastle and us but it’s a vast county and if we can show people what we’re capable of I’m really excited for what the future holds.”\nImage: Mary Barella Photography",
