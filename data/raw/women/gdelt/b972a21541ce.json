  "body_text": "NEW ORLEANS — What if when Lane Kiffin dumped Ole Miss two days after the regular season ended in November, the triumphant spirit in these Rebels never waned?\nWhat if they got stronger because Kiffin left?\nImagine that. Or just watch what the Rebels did Thursday night at the Superdome in coming from two scores down at halftime to hang 20 points in the final 12 minutes and snap Georgia’s 75-game streak of wins when it led to start the fourth quarter.\nAdvertisement\n“A lot of people did doubt us before the season,” Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss said, “and they still doubted us when our coach left. We just want to play ball and have fun. And I think that’s showing right now.”\nIn the most entertaining College Football Playoff game of the season, Ole Miss avenged its only 2025 loss with a 39-34 quarterfinal victory. The Rebels, suddenly the most compelling story of this postseason, advanced to face Miami next Thursday in the national semifinal at the Fiesta Bowl.\nAt 13-1 overall and now 2-0 under coach Pete Golding, promoted from defensive coordinator less than five weeks ago, Ole Miss is one win away from playing for a national championship in its first CFP appearance.\nSince Kiffin left on Nov. 30, Ole Miss players have grown only more resolved, they said, to shut out distractions and focus on football. They’re more closely knit as a result of the coaching drama and more prepared to handle the moments that Georgia, a five-time CFP participant, threw at them on Thursday.\nIt’s difficult to deny, and Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter buys into such a premise.\n“I do,” Carter said after the celebration, halted when officials kept one second on the clock after Ole Miss was awarded a safety and again after Georgia jumped on an onside kick. “They’ve done a great job of blocking out all the noise and the distractions. These kids love to play football.\n“If we went back out there right now, they’d play some more. It’s a mature group. They have one goal. That’s to win a national championship.”\nThe Rebels won’t be bothered with others’ obsession over Kiffin, a polarizing figure who built the program to reach the cusp of this peak it is climbing without him.\nKiffin opted not to attend the game, instead making an appearance at the LSU women’s basketball game 80 miles away in Baton Rouge.\nAdvertisement\nBut the Ole Miss players were pretty sure their former coach was watching the biggest win in program history.\n“Yeah, for sure,” said wide receiver Harrison Wallace, who caught nine passes for 156 yards and a touchdown.\nWideout De’Zhaun Stribling agreed. Not that it occupied his thoughts.\n“Being here in the moment, being here with these boys,” Stribling said, “seeing it come to life is a beautiful thing.”\nStribling covered 40 yards on the final completion by Chambliss, who was spectacular. The catch set up a 47-yard field goal by Lucas Carneiro with six seconds left to unlock a tie.\nOLE MISS MAKES THE KICK WITH SIX SECONDS REMAINING 😱 pic.twitter.com/fJC66nZ8Al\n— ESPN (@espn) January 2, 2026\nA 23-year-old senior who played at Washington State and Oklahoma State before he landed at Ole Miss in the offseason, Stribling said he engaged in some reflective thinking on New Year’s Eve.\n“Just about all the hard work and how grateful I am,” he said.\nCarter tried something similar over the past month. The AD had to navigate a period of several rocky weeks in the fall, with Kiffin’s future in Oxford uncertain as jobs opened at LSU and Florida. After his exit, Kiffin hired six Ole Miss assistants to take to LSU but agreed to let them stay with the Rebels to coach in the Playoff as they moonlighted in their new jobs.\n“Yeah, I have thought about the stress part of it,” Carter said. “It was stressful.”\nIn an odd twist, Kiffin has earned $250,000 for each of the Rebels’ two CFP wins because LSU agreed to pay him the incentivized bonus as listed in his old contract with Ole Miss. If the Rebels beat Miami, that’s another $250,000 in Kiffin’s pockets.\nThe arrangement remains awkward — but it’s effective, so far, at least for Ole Miss. Offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. called a strong game against Georgia, allowing Chambliss to work his magic repeatedly during four touchdown drives.\nCarter found comfort over the past month, he said, in knowing that Golding was not chosen hastily.\nAdvertisement\n“I knew Pete was the guy,” Carter said. “He was the guy for the short term and obviously the long term, too.”\nGolding, 41, worked for Nick Saban, like Georgia’s Kirby Smart and all of the still-standing head coaches in the CFP.\nThe path to Golding’s first head-coaching job mirrors that of Oregon coach Dan Lanning. Two years older than Lanning, Golding had more experience as a defensive coordinator than Lanning when he was hired by Oregon in 2022.\n“Everybody’s behind him,” Wallace said of Golding. “We love him. The energy he brings to the locker room, we want it just as bad as he does.”\nGolding brought out the best in the Rebels. Not only did Georgia own the longest streak nationally when it led after three quarters, but the Bulldogs had won an FBS-best 53 consecutive games when ahead at halftime.\nHow did Ole Miss do it?\nWith a swarming defense that recorded nine tackles for loss. With that kicker, Carneiro, who connected from 55 and 56 yards in the first quarter to get the Rebels warm.\nWith Kewan Lacy, the recently injured back who ran tough out of the backfield and after the catch.\nAnd with Chambliss, who hit 13 consecutive throws, a Sugar Bowl record, from the second through the fourth quarters and improvised outside the pocket to complete several throws that preserved scoring drives.\n“When things aren’t good,” Stribling said, “we look to him and see his composure and know we’re going to be OK.”\nChambliss, a Division II transfer in his first season at Ole Miss, awaits word on a waiver he’s filed with the NCAA to seek a sixth season of eligibility. Any game could be his last in college.\nNot his concern, Chambliss said. He’s got people to work on that for him.\n“My job right now is to focus on football,” Chambliss said, “and to focus on this team and focus on being 1-0 in the next game.”\nIt’s working just fine in the biggest spot ever for Ole Miss.",
