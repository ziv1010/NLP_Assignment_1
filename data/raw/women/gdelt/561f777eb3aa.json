  "body_text": "LSU Coach Kim Mulkey Unleashes on Baton Rouge Media\n(Baton Rouge, Louisiana) - LSU Women's Basketball Coach Kim Mulkey did not hold back on the local media during a post-game press conference.\nOf course, the biggest sports story in Baton Rouge and in Louisiana is who will be the next LSU football coach, and many speculate that iit could be Ole Miss Head Coach Lane Kiffin. As a matter of fact, Kiffin's family was in Baton Rouge earlier this week to tour the city, while LSU Women's Basketball was in New Orleans to take on Tulane.\nAfter the game against the Green Wave, Coach Mulkey noticed fewer local media members at the postgame press conference and expressed her frustration with their absence.\nSarcastically, she noted who was and wasn't there, and she said that maybe they were absent from the press conference because they were back home chasing Kiffin to be the first ones with a story.\nHere's Coch Mulkey at the table, chastising some of the local media members for skipping out on their game to be back home to catch a glimpse of Kiffin or his family.\nFor those who may have missed it, here's the Kiffins in Baton Rouge touring the city. The private plane sent by LSU to transport them was spotted at the Baton Rouge airport.\nOnce the family caught on to the media members staking out the airport, when it came time to depart, the plane was partially brought into the hangar, where an SUV brought those in to board, which did fly back to Oxford, Mississippi.",
