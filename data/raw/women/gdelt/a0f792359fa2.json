Cabinet welcomed the 2025 National Budget which seeks to maintain a balance between South Africa’s fiscal framework, funding the priorities of the Seventh Administration, as articulated by His Excellency, President Cyril Ramaphosa during the State of the Nation Address while mitigating the funding requirements impact on the poor and the middle-income household.\n1.1.2. The allocation of over R1 trillion to infrastructure development over the MTEF, the establishment of alternative infrastructure financing through a credit guarantee vehicle and the introduction of multiple bid windows on the Budget Facility for infrastructure is a demonstration of the commitment to grow the economy through a strong infrastructure-built programme whilst simultaneously improving service delivery.\n1.1.3. Mechanisms for private sector participation, as announced with the Budget – which are part of Operation Vulindlela driven reforms in the energy, transport and freight logistics sectors – indicate government’s commitment to fast-tracking private sector investment and inclusive economic growth.\n1.1.4. Acknowledging the impact of the tax increases, the Budget provides for mitigation measures against the increases such as:\n1.1.4.1. No increase in the fuel levy.\n1.1.4.2. Above inflation increases to social grants, with old age and disability grants increasing by R130 to R2 315 in 2025.\n1.1.4.3. Significant funding allocation to the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa to improve passenger rail transport, which will reduce household income spend on transport costs.\n1.1.5. Most significantly, the tax increases are going to finance sustainability of this country, by maintaining 11 000 teachers in the classrooms, 9 300 health worker in their jobs, the employment of 800 post-community service doctors and allow an additional 700 000 children (four-years of age) access to early childhood development (ECD), which is the necessary foundational education they need for a successful education journey.\n1.2. Economic Growth\n1.2.1. The 0.6% increase in the fourth quarter (GDP) for 2024 signals a recovery across the economy, as the agriculture, finance, trade and household sectors grew in the last quarter of the year.\n1.2.2. The agricultural industry rebounded by 17,2%, lifting GDP growth by 0,4 of a percentage point. The finance, real estate and businesses services industry grew for an eighth consecutive quarter, with financial intermediary, real estate activities and other business services being the largest positive contributors to growth.\n1.2.3. Cabinet is confident that the increased focus and pace of delivery on economic structural reforms, improved service delivery and state capacity, and increased participation of the private sector, will spur further growth of the economy in 2025 and beyond.\n1.3. Investment\n1.3.1. Cabinet welcomed the announcement by Microsoft South Africa to invest R5.4 billion in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure in the country. This investment will strengthen South Africa’s position as a leading AI hub on the African continent and builds on Microsoft South Africa’s R20.4 billion investment over the past three years.\n1.3.2. Microsoft South Africa also announced their contribution to developing South Africa’s digital literacy by paying for technical certification for 50 000 individuals in high-demand digital skills.\n1.3.3. In further uplifting our investment profile, Indian car manufacturer Mahindra signed a memorandum of understanding with South Africa’s Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) to explore the possibility of setting up a full-scale vehicle assembly plant in the country. Mahindra already has an assembly plant of Pik Up range of vehicles in Durban operated by AIH Logistics, where we recently celebrated the production of their 25 000th locally assembled Pik Up vehicles.\n1.3.4. Cabinet reminded every South African as direct shareholder in South Africa Incorporated (SA Inc.) of their vested interest in promoting our country as an investment destination in a globally competitive environment. We must continue to speak with one voice in defence of our national interest, our sovereignty and our constitutional democracy.\n2. International Relations\n2.1.

Crime\n3.1. Welcoming the Malawi Court Ruling on the Extradition of Shepherd and Mary Bushiri\n3.1.1. Cabinet welcomed the ruling by the Republic of Malawi’s Chief Resident Magistrate Court that Shepherd and Mary Bushiri be extradited to South Africa to stand trial on multiple criminal charges including rape, contravening the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, 2002 (Act 37 of 2002), the Bank Act, 1990 (Act 94 of 1990), Immigration Act, 2002 (Act 13 of 2002) and violating their bail conditions.\n3.1.2. This ruling shows that no-one can run away from the rule law and also reaffirms the judicial independence, international cooperation and mutual trust between the South African and Malawian legal institutions.\n3.1.3. We are aware that that the Bushiris have indicated their intention to appeal. However, we are confident that we have a strong case against them.\n3.1.4. South Africa stands ready to collaborate with INTERPOL to coordinate the transfer arrangements and logistics to ensure that they are brought to South Africa to stand trial.\n4. Severe Weather\n4.1. Recent heavy rains have claimed several lives, left hundreds displaced, with homes and infrastructure severely damaged in KwaZulu-Natal.\n4.2. The impact of severe weather conditions in KwaZulu-Natal has been declared a national state of disaster to allow the provincial department of Corporate Governance and Traditional Affairs to mobilise all organs of state to augment support measures, limiting the impact of the disaster on communities.\n4.3. Government continues to provide flood victims with assistance and the Department of Human Settlements has allocated R100 million to KwaZulu-Natal to assist in managing the flood aftermath.\n4.4. Cabinet calls on all South Africans to exercise extreme caution whenever there is inclement weather. Heavy rain poses a risk of localised flooding, particularly in low-lying areas, bridges and roads.\n4.5. In cases of heavy rains, communities are urged to avoid flooded roads and to monitor news broadcasts, radio bulletins and government official social media pages for real-time updates and alerts.\nB. Updates to Cabinet\n1. Protection and improvement of the National Minimum Wage (NMW)\n1.1. Cabinet received and considered a report by the Department of Employment and Labour on the progress made to protect and enhance the NMW.\n1.2. The NMW Act, 2018 (Act 9 of 2018), which was enacted in November 2018, laid the foundation for reducing income inequality and wage gaps, and continues to safeguard low-income workers in the country.\n1.3. From 1 March 2025, the NMW increased by 4% from R27,58 to R28,79 per hour. This increase aims to provide essential economic support and much-needed relief to the six million workers earning within the NMW bracket.\n2. Promoting Foundation Learning\n2.1. Cabinet expressed its support for the strategic reorientation of the Basic Education sector towards foundation learning.\n2.2. In January 2025, the Department of Basic Education announced and celebrated a record high matric pass rate of 87.4%. However, just a month earlier, the department had released systematic evaluation results from three different studies showing that nearly 80% of South African children cannot read for meaning, in any language by the age of ten (10).\n2.3. To resolve this challenge the Minister of Basic Education has initiated a strategic reorientation that will have the following initiatives:\n2.3.1. Universal access to quality ECD through the mass registration of ECD centres, ensure each child in ECD receives a subsidy, support ECD centres with Learning and Teaching materials, and offer support to practitioners to obtain teaching qualifications. Funding for this has been allocated in the 2025 National Budget.\n2.3.2. Review the norms and standards to increase teacher posts in foundation phase teaching.\n2.3.3. The Funza Lushaka Bursary will be reoriented to prioritise bursaries to students who wish to teach in the foundation phase.\n2.4. This strategic reorientation will strengthen foundational literacy and numeracy skills of learners, and ensure that they later be able to table on more complex subjects such as Maths, Science, Accounting and Economics, amongst others.\n3. Electricity generation performance\n3.1. Cabinet received a report on the work undertaken by Eskom to improve electricity generation and stabilisation of the national grid to avert more incidents of load-shedding.\n3.2. After the recovery of more than 300 megawatts of generation capacity and replenishment of sufficient reserves, load-shedding was suspended at 10:00 on Sunday, 9 March 2025. Coal operations at Kusile Power Station are at optimal levels with all units which were offline as of Friday 7 March now successfully returned to service and the Koeberg Unit 2 was successfully brought back to service.\n3.3. The overall generation performance since the summer of 2024 has shown significant improvements and stability, resulting in 98% of load-shedding-free days. Eskom remains optimistic for a positive outlook for the remainder of the summer period.\nC. Cabinet decisions\n1. Hosting of the Water and Sanitation Indaba\n1.1. Cabinet approved the hosting of the Water and Sanitation Indaba on 27 and 28 March 2025 in Gauteng.\n1.2. This event serves as a follow-up to the Water Summit held in January 2024, which brought together all water services authorities to address key sector challenges, following the release of the Drops Reports.\n1.3. The summit established an Action Plan to tackle these issues, and the Indaba will provide an opportunity to assess progress made and identify further steps needed.\n1.4. The expected outcomes of the Indaba are to have consensus on the state of water security in South Africa, progress on incomplete actions from the 2024 Water Summit and key actions required to improve water security and an updated (new) action plan.\n1.5. Cabinet acknowledged the water security challenges facing the country and reaffirms its commitment to ensure that every South African has access to clean, safe and sustainable water and sanitation services.\n2. 2nd, 3rd and 4th Period Country Report on the UN Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities (UNCRPD).\n2.1.
