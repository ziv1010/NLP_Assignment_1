  "body_text": "Player movement has been a key theme as kick-off to Northern NSW Football's premier women's competition arrives this weekend.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nBroadmeadow, the 2023 premiers and champions, are virtually unrecognisable, while a host of players from various sides have sought fresh opportunity at newcomers Lake Macquarie City.\nThe biggest change, perhaps, is that only seven teams will feature in NPLW first grade this year following the withdrawal of Mid Coast for 2025. Lake Macquarie have replaced Warners Bay.\nThe off-season player movement makes this year's competition one of the least predictable in recent time, and the mid-season transfer window in May always throws a few curve balls.\nFourth place looks like a battle between Adamstown and New Lambton, while Magic looks destined to miss the finals for the first time since returning to the women's premier competition. Lake Macquarie don't look to have the squad to be a top-four side just yet.\nMAITLAND\nCoach: Joseph Wright\nLast season: First by goal difference, lost preliminary final: 47 points, 15 wins (W), 2 draws (D), 4 losses (L), goals scored 120 (F), goals against 29 (A).\nSquad news: Losses include premiership-winning coach Keelan Hamilton to spend more time with his young family, NPLW golden boot and player of the year Bronte Peel, who is pursuing opportunities in the Victorian premier league, wingback Maddy Howard (Olympic) and attacking player Indianna Auddino (Lakes). The Magpies also lose experience and quality with the departure of Paige Kingston-Hogg (travelling) and retirements of Alesha Clifford plus Sophie Jones. Key recruits include midfielder Josie Morley and forward Renee Pountey, who both have A-League experience, but the one to watch will be attacking player Marry Npsweng, who represented South Africa at the 2012 Olympics.\nBottom line: The Magpies flew higher than ever before last year, claiming the Charity Shield, League Cup and NPLW premiership. But they failed to reach the grand final and that is sure to prove motivation this campaign. While the Magpies have sustained some critical losses, they retain a core group of well-drilled players. Morley, returning from major injury, and Pountney, from NPLW NSW side Gladesville, are quality inclusions. Wright was Hamilton's assistant and will have the Magpies again playing a good brand of football.\nPrediction: Third\nNEWCASTLE OLYMPIC\nCoach: Craig Atkins\nLast season: Finished second by goal difference, lost the grand final (47 points, 15W, 2D, 4L, 104F, 19A)\nSquad news: Losses include versatile Marion Dunbabin, midfielder Evie Horgan and defender Georgia Cook, who have all joined Adamstown. Fringe first-graders Brooke Summers and Alannah Russell have signed with Lake Macquarie City. Three big gains are A-League women's premiership-winner Rhali Dobson, former Olympic captain Laura Hall - both returning after having babies - and former A-League defender Alex Huynh. Howard is also a value-add inclusion.\nBottom line: Olympic have quality across the park, and experience. They have played in every grand final since joining the competition in 2020 and have the squad to get there again. While they have no shortage of strike weapons, and the up-front combination of Dobson, Sophie McDonald and Jemma House is tantalising, Olympic are also defensively sound. They conceded just 19 goals last campaign and Huynh adds further steel. Attacking midfielder Elodie Dagg is a proven game-changer and the club has a wave of rising talent coming through the ranks.\nPrediction: Second\nCHARLESTOWN AZZURRI\nCoach: Heath Whyte\nLast season: Finished third by goal difference, won the grand final (39 points, 12W, 3D, 6L, 117F, 44A),\nSquad news: Key inclusions from Magic are Kalista Hunter, Chelsea Lucas, Madi Gallegos and Kiarra Lewis. Gallegos is more known as a defender but played up front in the Charity Shield on Friday night and caused plenty of headaches. Other pick-ups include Jets Academy product Sara Knowles, a wide player, and goalkeeper Danielle Bartells, from NSW League One Women's. Losses include player of last year's grand final Ella Joyce, Lori Depczynski, Nicki Jones, Jess Gentle, Sarah Halvorsen and 2023 NPLW player of the year Cassie Corder.\nBottom line: A new-look Azzurri built steadily last season and peaked at the right time to claim their first championship. The mid-season inclusions of experienced A-League players Gema Simon and Melina Ayres proved a major boost and both will be key again. Ayres quickly made up for lost time, accruing 25 goals in 14 games last year, and Simon combined with former Jets defender Kirstyn Pearce for a pivotal centre-back pairing during the finals campaign. The addition of Hunter has Azzurri's back line looking near impenetrable and a key asset after leaking 44 goals last campaign. On paper, they look hard to beat.\nPrediction: First\nBROADMEADOW MAGIC\nCoach: Jason Konjarski\nLast season: Finished fourth by goal difference (39 points, 12W, 3D, 6L, 84F, 41A)\nSquad news: Konjarski took the reins late last season and has the coaching role from the get-go this year. He has his work cut out for him, though, after wholesale losses. They have lost a wealth of experience to Azzurri as well as midfielder Kobie Ferguson (knee injury) and A-League striker Ash Brodigan (NPLW NSW). Sunny Mitchell, Mattiese Loretan, Sam Lazarovski plus Emily Loader Weston have gone to Lakes. Key pick-ups include striker Callie Thomas and midfielder Jen Reeves, both from Warners Bay, Corder, former Jets Academy right-back Molly Salvador and American Alexis Andrews.\nBottom line: Konjarski says Magic will be a hard-working side. They look strong in attack with Lilly-Jane Babic returning after a strong 2024 campaign and the additions of Thomas and Corder, but their defence has question marks following the departure of centre-back pairing Hunter and Gallegos. Magic are pretty much going through a rebuilding phase, and, while they have picked up some talented players, it is hard to see them threatening for finals as they have done since returning to the competition in 2020.\nPrediction: Sixth\nNEW LAMBTON\nCoach: Aaron Stedman\nLast season: Finished fifth (38 points, 12W, 2D, 7L, 87F, 44A)\nSquad news: They have lost goalkeeper Ally Boertje (Jets), defender Kate Heap (Jets Academy) and centre-back Hannah Burke (relocated). New recruits include midfielder Rosie Copus and exciting forward Caitlin Pickett, who has experience in the US college system and more recently played in the Victorian NPLW. Former Jets fullback Tessa Tamplin proved a valuable inclusion midway through last season and is on board from round one this campaign. The Golden Eagles will again get lethal Jets duo Cassidy Davis and Lauren Allan once their A-League commitments finish to complement the attacking prowess of twice-capped Matilda Tara Andrews.\nBottom line: New Lambton's squad looks to run deeper this year. The loss of Boertje is big but the main question for the Golden Eagles remains the same: How many wins can they pick up before the mid-season arrival of Davis and Allan. The pair combined for 41 goals in about 11 outings and had New Lambton firing in the second half of the season.\nPrediction: Fourth\nADAMSTOWN\nCoach: Martin Slade\nLast season: Finished sixth (27 points, 9W, 12L, 55F, 61A)\nSquad news: Pick-ups include midfielder Evie Horgan, defender Georgia Cook and versatile Marion Dunbabbin from Olympic, plus midfielder Sophia Laurie from Maitland. All are quality signings and will help strengthen a young, well-drilled side. Rosebud have lost Cook twins Mia and Sophie, who are both pursuing opportunities in the US college system, but the pair are expected to return for mid-season cameos.\nBottom line: Under new coach Slade, Adamstown built throughout last season and played some good football. They look stronger this year and should be knocking on the door of finals if they score more and leak less. Power-packed Tori Johnson had a break-out season, scoring 17 goals and being named NPLW young player of the year, and the addition of Dunbabin, who scored 21 goals for Olympic last year, should give them a one-two attacking punch.\nPrediction: Fifth\nLAKE MACQUARIE\nCoach: Gabrielle Blanch\nLast season: Lake Macquarie City have replaced Warners Bay\nSquad news: A host of signings include goalkeeper Taylah Gray (Azzurri), Magic attacking trio Sunny Mitchell, Mattiese Loretan and Emily Loader Weston, Olympic pair Brooke Summers and Alannah Russell, forward Indianna Auddino (Maitland), Tahlor Thackeray from the Central Coast, and American Ani Jensen.\nBottom line: The new-look squad is a mix of youth and experience, and an unknown quality could be their strength. How quickly they gel will be key. Lakes have picked up some handy players, many who have made the move for an opportunity of more match minutes. They face a tough first-up test in defending premiers Maitland and look to be in for the long haul rather than an instant success.\nPrediction: Seventh\nRound 1: Saturday: New Lambton v Azzurri, Alder Park (6pm). Sunday: Maitland v Lake Macquarie, Cooks Square Park (4pm); Magic v Olympic, Magic Park (6pm).",
