Akinwande picked himself up and sent Henly the wrong way from the spot.\nThe blustery conditions made it difficult for both sides and a draw would probably have been a fair result, although Henly made a number of good saves to keep Town in the game during the second half.\nAkinwande provided a good test for Digby who will have been pleased to get 90 minutes under his belt, while Tabb and Touré failed to make much of an impression on the game.\nVarney worked hard up front and was unlucky not to score but he saw little of the ball during the second period.\nU21s: Henly, Emmanuel, Kenlock, Tabb, Digby, Robinson, Toure, McDonnell, Varney, McLoughlin (Blanchfield 60), McKendry (Hammond 76).

Perhaps it is bad luck, but we have no youngsters anywhere near pushing for the first team (apart from the injured Teddy Bishop). Here we are with many injuries piling up, yet still youngsters are not deemed good enough to feature. Promotion is looking unlikely this season, but I wonder how we will progress in future years without the young players coming through to make it happen? Most of our team are at their peak or beyond, so without the room for improvement that players in their early 20s would have. Look at the ages of those who played Saturday, excluding loanees: Bialkowski (28), Foley (31), Chambers (30), Berra (31), Smith (25), Knudsen (23), Bru (27), Sears (26), Murphy (32), Pitman (28), Varney (33), Touré (31). Average age = 29.\nthese are becoming such woeful times when they can't achieve results against such smaller clubs, and the Ipswich side included experienced players too.\nWhat is Kennedy actually doing? He has done little it appears over his time in charge.\nthese are becoming such woeful times when they can't achieve results against such smaller clubs, and the Ipswich side included experienced players too.\nWhat is Kennedy actually doing? He has done little it appears over his time in charge.\nI can't see what vision we have to take things forward in the future. Last season people were saying there was promise in the academy and the future was bright but I'm not seeing that reflected in the academy product.\nThe clubs needs rebuilding from head to toe\ndirtydingusmagee\nHopefully we will have the East Anglian Derby back and I hope we decide to take the cup competitions a bit more seriously so we can generate some extra money. I am still holding out that we have a chance for 6th spot. I don't think we have any chance of hell of getting promoted but 6th spot would generate cash revenue of at least 750,000 which would prove useful when it comes to signing our usual free transfers in the Summer. The more money we can generate the better.\nWell \"Applied Murphology\" obviously evolves around the basic notion that: \"If anything can go wrong .... it will!\"(or words to that effect), aptly APPLIED to not only any and all absurd degree you can possibly concoct, but also commonly among \"thinkers\" to just about any and all possible situation in our daily life. There actually exist various collections in book form on this truly wÃ¼nderbar subject , but here is just a few classic examples -- some of them chosen for their obvious 'weirdness' -- common to all of them though is that they COULD very well be applied to the current 'State of Ipswich Town Football Club' .... and/or our ultra stubborn not giving a flying f*** about NOTHING dinosaur manager! ..... who to my recollection has NEVER ONCE publicly looked inward or himself (alongside his faithful and likewise hoofball advocating prehistoric football fossil TC) in the mirror, when trying to explain why things don't go our \"way\" :\nO'Toole's Commentary: Murphy was an optimist!\nGattuso's Extension of Murphy's Law: Nothing is ever so bad that it can't get worse!\nFinagle's 4th Law: Once a job is fouled up, anything done to improve matters only makes things worse!\nFarnsdick's Corollary: After things have gone from bad to worse, the cycle will repeat itself!\nAnthony's Law of Force: Don't force it, get a larger hammer!\nBurke's Rule: Never create a problem for which you do not have the answer!\nOgden's Law: The sooner you fall behind, the more time you have to catch up!\nDurcharm's Axiom: If one views his problem closely enough, he will recognize himself as part of the problem!\nTerman's Law of Innovation: If you want a track team to win the high jump you find one person who can jump seven feet, not seven people who can jump one foot!\nFrisch's Law: You cannot have a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant!\nGrandma Soderquist's Conclusion: A chicken doesn't stop scratching just because the worms are scarce!\nDolly Parton's Principle: The bigger \"they\" are, the harder it is to see your shoes! :-):-):-)\nThought we had a strong squad!!!!\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
