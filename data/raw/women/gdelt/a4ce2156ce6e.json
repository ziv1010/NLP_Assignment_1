  "body_text": "PARIS, France – In an early morning match made for an all-you-can-eat breakfast, the United States Women’s National Soccer Team (USWNT) shined bright in the waning moments of overtime to score and ultimately defeat a hardwearing Japan team.\nWith their 1-0 victory, the Yanks advance to play Germany in the Olympic Semifinals next Tuesday in Lyon. The National Eleven defeated Canada in a penalty kick shootout, 4-2, after the match, plus extra time, finished at 0-0.\nThe Americans overcame Japan’s team effort that involved parking their team bus in front of their goal, along with several ancillary minivans in the midfield, all in hopes of stalling America’s Holy Trinity of Mallory Swanson, Sophia Smith, and Lindsey Horan from penetrating and scoring.\nThe tactic was highly effective as Team USA was able to launch only three shots on goal despite holding the ball 71% of the match play.\nConversely, the U.S. showed up on defense, too. Japan was only able to get off one shot on goal.\nThen, at 105 plus two minutes mark, left-side defender Crystal Dunn delivered a long-range, down-field pass to Trinity Rodman, who was idling the right flank. She brought down the ball, outdueled her mark, Hikaru Kitagawa, then unleashed a world-class left-footed shot across the face of the goal, past the outstretched right arm of leaping keeper Ayaka Yamashita, into the upper left corner of the net.\nPure pandemonium ensued seconds later, both on the field, on the U.S sideline, and in the stands of booked Parc des Princes Paris stadium that included several USWNT alumni, including Megan Rapinoe and Monsieur Snoop Dogg, aka Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. who learned how to sing GOOOOOAL, from the best.\n“I have flashes of what happened,” Rodman said post-match. “I got into the area, I received a beautiful pass, then I took a shot. It wasn’t that I didn’t have confidence in my shot, but at the same time, I couldn’t believe it. That’s the best moment in my career.”\nIt was Rodman’s third goal of the Olympics, following scores against Zambia and Australia. She hadn’t scored in any of her previous 12 USWNT appearances. Her trio of goals now ties Mallory Swanson for the team lead this tournament and is tied for the fifth-most by any USWNT player at a single Olympics.\nAt 22 years of age, Rodman is the youngest player to score for the USWNT in an Olympic knockout round match since 20-year-old Lindsay Tarpley scored in the 2004 gold medal match.\nThe semifinal will take place at the Stade de Lyon. The stadium is the base camp for Colorado’s Lindsey Horan. She joined Lyon in 2022. Together with her teammates, she won a pair of French league titles and the UEFA Women’s Champions League.\n“It was a very hard match. It was like a chess match,” Lindsey Horan said to a large scrum of reporters. “That’s what we were saying in the huddle just now after the game. Japan are an amazing team and I feel for them.”\nWhen head coach Emma Hayes took the microphone, she reflected, “It was very tactical. That’s why I liked it so much. It was a match of grit and determination. It was decided by one moment of brilliance. I like this Japan team. I always enjoy watching them. They are a great team. Our defenders today were amazing. Everyone in our team stuck to their tasks.”\nRegardless of next week’s semifinal result, the U.S. will continue to play on. A loss will send the Americans to the bronze medal game on the 9th. More so, another win over Germany will deliver the Stars and Stripes to Parc des Princes via a fast train to play for a solid gold medal on August 10th.\nPhoto Credit: John Babiak\nThank you for reading Burgundy Wave.
