  "body_text": "The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has reacted to a remark by Randy Waldrum on the “lack of support” for the Super Falcons’ preparations for the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup.\nIn a recent interview, Waldrum expressed “frustration” with the federation’s “uninspiring attitude” towards the Falcons ahead of the competition.\nHe said the Nigerian women’s football team is “not prepared the way we need to be” for the World Cup billed to kick off on July 20.\nThe American coach also accused the NFF of cancelling their final training camp without explanation.\nAdvertisement\nReacting to Waldrum’s remark, Ademola Olajire, NFF’s communications director, said the Falcons head coach is “shooting his mouth off” instead of “admitting to the glaring deficiencies” he displayed in the list of players invited to participate in the tournament.\nOlajire argued that Waldrum invited some players who should not be in camp and also left others who should have made his final list.\nThe NFF spokesperson added that the final training camp was cancelled because it would have been a “waste of resources.”\nAdvertisement\n“We have to first ask when the European season ended. The man wanted a 2-week camping for only home-based professionals (whom he already gave very little consideration in his provisional list),” Olajire said.\n“Like two weeks ago, he released his final list of 23, meaning there was absolutely no need for any camping for home-based again except to simply waste resources. Instead of admitting his glaring deficiencies, he’s there shooting his mouth off.\n“He knows he will not have Ajibade & Ayinde (2 key players) for the opening match against Canada, yet he left out Okobi and Otu from the squad. The NFF felt it would make more sense for the 23 to go straight to Australia & camp for 15 or 16 days acclimatising to the weather and conditions.\n“The NFF wanted him to groom a home-based goal tender like Chiamaka Nnadozie was groomed. Instead, he kept bringing Yewande Balogun (who actually started as a goalkeeper coach) all the time without consideration for a home girl.”\nAdvertisement\nThe 2023 World Cup will be hosted by New Zealand and Australia.\nThe Falcons are scheduled to play Canada in their first match on July 21 before facing Australia six days later. The team will play Ireland in their last group game on July 31.",
