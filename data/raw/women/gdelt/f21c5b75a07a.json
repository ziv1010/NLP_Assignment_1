The dropped catchphrase highlights the Democrat Party’s infighting about how to shore up Biden’s economy heading into the 2024 election. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and House Majority PAC no longer use “Bidenomics,” a phrase the White House coined earlier this year to cushion Biden’s “troubling” approval rating, Axios reported Sunday. “The term is nowhere to be found in any of the House Majority PAC’s public releases and posts except for a single... -\nFormer Dwyer High School football player dies at 20.

It was in late June 1964 that Juanita Castro, then 31, called a press conference in Mexico City and, teary-eyed, declared that she could no longer remain indifferent to what was happening in Cuba: “My brothers Fidel and Raúl have made it an enormous prison surrounded by water.

Co-leader Lauren Hood said that along with southwest city representative Maurice Weeks, she had been considering leaving for months due to the group 'lacking a broad strategic vision'. 'I think, collectively, that group of people has different ideas about what reparations is fundamentally and we didn't get to a place where we had a broad strategic vision,' Hood told the Detroit News. The task force was given a $350,000 budget to develop recommendations for housing and economic programs which 'address historical discrimination... -\nDirector of Nicaragua’s Miss Universe franchise charged with plotting to overthrow the government\nNicaraguan police have charged the director of the local Miss Universe franchise with conspiracy, treason, money laundering and spreading fake news as part of a plot to overthrow the government, weeks after the Central American nation’s first victory in the pageant.

The president was using a trio of fundraisers to caution against what might happen should his predecessor again claim control of the White House, noting that Trump has described himself as his supporters’ “retribution” and has vowed to root out “vermin” in the country. “We’ve got to get it done, not because of... -\nCBS eye gif\nYears ago, a Freeper designed a GIF using the CBS eye logo.
