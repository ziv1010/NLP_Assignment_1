GPT-3, however, is not merely a quantitative tweak yielding “GPT-2 but better”—it is qualitatively different, exhibiting eerie runtime learning capabilities allowing even the raw model, with zero finetuning, to “meta-learn” many textual tasks purely by example or instruction. One does not train or program GPT-3 in a normal way, but one engages in dialogue and writes prompts to teach GPT-3 what one wants.\nExperimenting through the OpenAI Beta API in June 2020, I find that GPT-3 does not just match my finetuned GPT-2-1.5b-poetry for poem-writing quality, but exceeds it, while being versatile in handling poetry, Tom Swifty puns, science fiction, dialogue like Turing’s Turing-test dialogue, literary style parodies… As the pièce de résistance, I recreate Stanislaw Lem’s Cyberiad’s “Trurl’s Electronic Bard” poetry using GPT-3. (Along the way, I document instances of how the BPE text encoding unnecessarily damages GPT-3’s performance on a variety of tasks, how to best elicit the highest-quality responses, common errors people make in using GPT-3, and test out GPT-3’s improvements in NN weak points like logic or commonsense knowledge.)\nGPT-3’s samples are not just close to human level: they are creative, witty, deep, meta, and often beautiful. They demonstrate an ability to handle abstractions, like style parodies, I have not seen in GPT-2 at all. Chatting with GPT-3 feels uncannily like chatting with a human. I was impressed by the results reported in the GPT-3 paper, and after spending a week trying it out, I remain impressed.\nThis page records GPT-3 samples I generated in my explorations, and thoughts on how to use GPT-3 and its remaining weaknesses. I hope you enjoy them even a tenth as much as I enjoyed testing GPT-3 and watching the completions scroll across my screen.\nThe latest and greatest neural network for unrestricted natural language generation is OpenAI’s GPT-3. GPT-3 is like GPT-1 and the GPT-2 I’ve used extensively before1—only much more so, and then going beyond them in a fascinating new way.\nScaling works: quantity is a quality all its own. The scaling of GPT-2-1.5b by 116× to GPT-3-175b has worked surprisingly well and unlocked remarkable flexibility in the form of meta-learning, where GPT-3 can infer new patterns or tasks and follow instructions purely from text fed into it. What can we do with GPT-3? Here, we’re all about having fun while probing GPT-3’s abilities for creative writing tasks, primarily (but far from limited to) poetry. Fortunately, OpenAI granted me access to their Beta API service which provides a hosted GPT-3 model, letting me spend a great deal of time interacting with GPT-3 and writing things. Naturally, I’d like to write poetry with it: but GPT-3 is too big to finetune like I did GPT-2, and OA doesn’t (yet) support any kind of training through their API. Must we content ourselves with mediocre generic poetry, at best, deprived of finetuning directly on chosen poetry corpuses or authors we might like to parody? How much does GPT-3 improve and what can it do?\nTurns out: a lot! Below, I walk through first impressions of using GPT-3, and countless samples. In the latest twist on Moravec’s paradox, GPT-3 still struggles with commonsense reasoning & factual knowledge of the sort a human finds effortless after childhood, but handles well things like satire & fiction writing & poetry, which we humans find so difficult & impressive even as adults. In addition to the Cyberiad, I’d personally highlight the Navy Seal & Harry Potter parodies, the Devil’s Dictionary of Science/Academia, “Uber Poem”, “The Universe Is a Glitch” poem (with AI-generated rock music version), & “Where the Sidewalk Ends”.\nWhat Benchmarks Miss: Demos\nThe GPT-3 paper includes evaluation of zero-shot/few-shot performance across a wide range of tasks, but I fear that unless one is familiar with the (deadly dull) benchmarks in question, it won’t be impressive. You can skip to the appendix for more example like its poems, or browse the random samples.\nThe original OpenAI Beta API homepage includes many striking examples of GPT-3 capabilities ranging from chatbots to question-based Wikipedia search to legal discovery to homework grading to translation; I’d highlight AI Dungeon’s Dragon model (example before the March 2021 meltdown), and “Spreadsheets”/“Natural Language Shell”/“Code Completion”2. Andrew Mayne describes using GPT-3 to generate book recommendation lists & read interactive stories & engage in conversations with historical figures like Ada Lovelace3, summarize texts for elementary school children (also available as a service now, Simplify.so) or as a writing assistant, or summarize AI Dungeon/movies in emoji (Matrix: “🤖🤐”; Hunger Games: “🏹🥊🌽🏆”; see also et al 2021), convert screenplay ↔︎ story, summarize/write emails, translate from legalize, and rewrite HTML. Paras Chopra finds that GPT-3 knows enough Wikipedia & other URLs that the basic Q&A behavior can be augmented to include a ‘source’ URL, and so one can make a knowledge base ‘search engine’ with clickable links for any assertion (ie. the user can type in “What year was Richard Dawkin’s The Selfish Gene published?” and GPT-3 will return a tuple like (\"The Selfish Gene was published in 1976\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene\")\nwhich can be parsed & presented as a search engine). Andreas Stuhlmüller explored using it to create suggestions for predicting on by breaking down high-level forecasting questions. et al 2020 tests few-shot GPT-3 on common moral reasoning problems, and while it doesn’t do nearly as well as a finetuned ALBERT overall, interestingly, its performance degrades the least on the problems constructed to be hardest.\nRyan North experimented with Crunchyroll anime, Star Trek: The Next Generation, & Seinfeld plot summaries. Max Woolf has a repo of GPT-3 example prompts & various completions such as the original GPT-2 “unicorn” article, Revenge of the Sith, Stack Overflow Python questions, and his own tweets (note that many samples are bad because the prompts & hyperparameters are often deliberately bad, eg. the temperature=0 samples, to demonstrate the large effect of poorly-chosen settings as a warning). Janelle Shan experimented with weird dog descriptions to accompany deformed GAN-dog samples, and 10,000-year nuclear waste warnings based on the famous 1993 Sandia report on long-term nuclear waste warning messages for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. Summers-Stay tried imitating Neil Gaiman & Terry Pratchett short stories with excellent results. Arram Sabetti has done “songs, stories, press releases, guitar tabs, interviews, essays, and technical manuals”, with his Elon Musk Dr. Seuss poems a particular highlight. Salahuddin got great results imitating Pablo Neruda’s poetry, as did Brundage with Walt Whitman. Paul Bellow (LitRPG) experiments with RPG backstory generation. Merzmensch Kosmopol enjoyed generating love letters written by a toaster. James Yu co-wrote a SF Singularity short story with GPT-3, featuring regular meta sidenotes where he & GPT-3 debate the story in-character; it was exceeded in popularity by Pamela Mishkin’s “Nothing Breaks Like AI Heart” which went full Choose-Your-Own-Adventure. Daniel Bigham plays what he dubs “19 degrees of Kevin Bacon” which links Mongolia to (eventually) Kevin Bacon. Alexander Reben prompted for contemporary art/sculpture descriptions, and physically created some of the ones he liked best using a variety of mediums like matchsticks, toilet plungers, keys, collage, etc. Tomer Ullman prompted GPT-3 for new philosophy thought experiments. And /r/aigreentext stems from the serendipitous discovery that GPT-3 is amazingly good at imitating 4chan-style “green text” stories & that the OA Playground interface colors generated text green, so screenshots of real & prompted green text stories look similar.\nHarley Turan found that, somehow, GPT-3 can associate plausible color hex codes with specific emoji (apparently language models can learn color from language, much like blind humans do). Even more perplexingly, Sharif Shameem discovered that GPT-3 could write JSX (a JavaScript+CSS hybrid) according to a specification like “5 buttons, each with a random color and number between 1–10” or increase/decrease a balance in React or a very simple to-do list and it would often work, or require relatively minor fixes. He also demonstrated a divide-and-conquer approach to making GPT-3 ‘control’ a web browser. GPT-3 can also write some simple SVG shapes or SVG/Chart.js bar graphs, do text → LaTeX and SQL queries, and match k-NN & do regression on toy datasets. While I don’t think programmers need worry about unemployment (NNs will be a complement until they are so good they are a substitute), the code demos are impressive in illustrating just how diverse the skills created by pretraining on the Internet can be. Particularly intriguing in terms of code generation is its ability to write regexps from English descriptions, and Jordan Singer’s Figma plugin which apparently creates a new Figma layout DSL & few-shot teaches it to GPT-3.\n(I’d also highlight GPT-3’s version of the famous GPT-2 recycling rant, an attempt at “Epic Rap Battles of History”, GPT-3 playing 200-word tabletop RPGs with itself, the Serendipity recommendation engine which asks GPT-3 for movie/book recommendations (cf. et al 2022), and Lawder’s food label ingredient summarizer.)\nOne underexplored area of GPT-3 is using its “search” API, which as the name indicates, takes a text prompt (the query) and searches a large set of possible results, and returns the ‘most similar’ one, in a highly abstract sense; Andrew Mayne demonstrates that it’s much more than a simple keyword search engine by doing things like searching for abstract movie plots.4\nGPT-3 Implications\nFor my main discussion of why GPT-3 works and its implications, see “On GPT-3: Meta-Learning, Scaling, Implications, And Deep Theory” (see also Backstop). Below is the summary:\nGPT-3, announced by OpenAI in May 2020, was the largest neural network ever trained, by over an order of magnitude. Trained on Internet text data, it is the successor to GPT-2, which surprised everyone by its natural language understanding & generation ability. GPT-3 is even more surprising in that this vast increase in size did not run into diminishing returns, as many expected, but the benefits of scale continued to happen as forecasted by OpenAI. These benefits were not merely learning more facts & text than GPT-2, but qualitatively distinct & surprising in showing meta-learning: while GPT-2 learned how to do common natural language tasks like text summarization, GPT-3 instead learned how to follow directions and learn new tasks from a few examples. (As a result, GPT-3 outputs & interaction are more fascinating & human-like than GPT-2.)\nWhile the immediate applications of GPT-3, like my poetry or humor writings, are nice, the short-term implications of GPT-3 are much more important.\nFirst, while GPT-3 is expensive by conventional DL standards, it is cheap by scientific/commercial/military/government budget standards, and the results indicate that models could be made much larger. Second, models can also be made much more powerful, as GPT is an old approach known to be flawed in both minor & major ways, and far from an ‘ideal’ Transformer. Third, GPT-3’s capabilities come from learning on raw (unsupervised) data; that has long been one of the weakest areas of DL, holding back progress in other areas like reinforcement learning or robotics. Sequence models can learn rich models of environments & rewards (either online or offline), and implicitly plan and perform well ( et al 2021’s Decision Transformer is a demonstration of how RL can lurk in what looks merely like simple supervised learning). Models like GPT-3 suggest that large unsupervised models will be vital components of future DL systems, as they can be ‘plugged into’ systems to immediately provide understanding of the world, humans, natural language, and reasoning.\nThe meta-learning has a longer-term implication: it is a demonstration of the blessings of scale, where problems with simple neural networks vanish, and they become more powerful, more generalizable, more human-like when simply made very large & trained on very large datasets with very large compute—even though those properties are believed to require complicated architectures & fancy algorithms (and this perceived need drives much research). Unsupervised models benefit from this, as training on large corpuses like Internet-scale text present a myriad of difficult problems to solve; this is enough to drive meta-learning despite GPT not being designed for meta-learning in any way. (This family of phenomena is perhaps driven by neural networks functioning as ensembles of many sub-networks with them all averaging out to an Occam’s razor, which for small data & models, learn superficial or memorized parts of the data, but can be forced into true learning by making the problems hard & rich enough.)\nThe blessings of scale in turn support a radical theory: an old AI paradigm held by a few pioneers in connectionism (early artificial neural network research) and by more recent deep learning researchers, the scaling hypothesis. The scaling hypothesis regards the blessings of scale as the secret of AGI: intelligence is ‘just’ simple neural units & learning algorithms applied to diverse experiences at a (currently) unreachable scale. As increasing computational resources permit running such algorithms at the necessary scale, the neural networks will get ever more intelligent.\nWhen? Estimates of Moore’s law-like progress curves decades ago by pioneers like Hans Moravec indicated that it would take until the 2010s for the sufficiently-cheap compute for tiny insect-level prototype systems to be available, and the 2020s for the first sub-human systems to become feasible, and these forecasts are holding up. (Despite this vindication, the scaling hypothesis is so unpopular an idea, and difficult to prove in advance rather than as a fait accompli, that while the GPT-3 results finally drew some public notice after OpenAI enabled limited public access & people could experiment with it live, it is unlikely that many entities will modify their research philosophies, much less kick off an ‘arms race’.)\nDepending on what investments are made into scaling DL, and how fast compute grows, the 2020s should be quite interesting—sigmoid or singularity?\nQuality\nObjective metrics hard to interpret. How much better is (un-finetuned base) GPT-3? The likelihood loss is an absolute measure, as are the benchmarks, but it’s hard to say what a decrease of, say, 0.1 bits per character might mean, or a 5% improvement on SQuAD, in terms of real-world use or creative fiction writing. It feels like a large improvement, definitely a larger improvement than going from GPT-2-345M to GPT-2-1.5b, or GPT-2-1.5b to GPT-3-12b, but how much?\nScreening gains: 1:100 → 1:5 or 20× better? For fiction, I treat it as a curation problem: how many samples do I have to read to get one worth showing off? One could think of it asking how efficiently a model searches The Library of Babel (or should that be, The Book of Sand, or “The Aleph”?): at the one extreme, an algorithm which selects letters at random will have to generate astronomically large numbers of samples before, like the proverbial monkeys, they generate a page from a Shakespeare play; at the other extreme, a reasonably intelligent human can dash off 1 plausible page in 1 try. With AI algorithms, the results are intermediate but rapidly improving. A Markov chain text generator trained on a small corpus represents a huge leap over randomness: instead of having to generate quadrillions of samples, one might only have to generate millions of samples to get a coherent page; this can be improved to hundreds of thousands by increasing the depth of the n of its n-grams, which is feasible as one moves to Internet-scale text datasets (the classic “unreasonable effectiveness of data” example) or by careful hand-engineering & combination with other approaches like Mad-Libs-esque templating. A char-RNN, like in my char-RNN poetry experiments does better still: it easily generates reasonable paragraphs, so one might only have to brute force on the order of thousands of samples to get a pleasing page. With GPT-2-117M poetry, I’d typically read through a few hundred samples to get a good one, with worthwhile improvements coming from 345M → 774M → 1.5b; by 1.5b, I’d say that for the crowdsourcing experiment, I read through 50–100 ‘poems’ to select one. But for GPT-3, once the prompt is dialed in, the ratio appears to have dropped to closer to 1:5—maybe even as low as 1:3! I frequently find myself shrugging at the first completion I generate, “not bad!” (Certainly, the quality of GPT-3’s average prompted poem appears to exceed that of almost all teenage poets.) I would have to read GPT-2 outputs for months and probably surreptitiously edit samples together to get a dataset of samples like this page.\nPrompts As Programming\nOn two occasions I have been asked,—‘Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?’ In one case a member of the Upper, and in the other a member of the Lower, House put this question. I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.\nCharles Babbage, Passages from the Life of a Philosopher 1864\nThe GPT-3 neural network is so large a model in terms of power and dataset that it exhibits qualitatively different behavior: you do not apply it to a fixed set of tasks which were in the training dataset, requiring retraining on additional data if one wants to handle a new task (as one would have to retrain GPT-2); instead, you interact with it, expressing any task in terms of natural language descriptions, requests, and examples, tweaking the prompt until it “understands” & it meta-learns the new task based on the high-level abstractions it learned from the pretraining.\nThis is a rather different way of using a DL model, and it’s better to think of it as a new kind of programming, prompt programming, where the prompt is now a coding language which programs GPT-3 to do new things.\nA new programming paradigm? The GPT-3 neural network is so large a model in terms of power and dataset that it exhibits qualitatively different behavior: you do not apply it to a fixed set of tasks which were in the training dataset, requiring retraining on additional data if one wants to handle a new task (as one would have to retrain GPT-2); instead, you interact with it, expressing any task in terms of natural language descriptions, requests, and examples, tweaking the prompt until it “understands” & it meta-learns the new task based on the high-level abstractions it learned from the pretraining. This is a rather different way of using a DL model, and it’s better to think of it as a new kind of programming, where the prompt is now a “program” which programs GPT-3 to do new things. “Prompt programming”5 is less like regular programming than it is an exercise in a kind of tacit knowledge/mechanical sympathy. It is like coaching a superintelligent cat into learning a new trick: you can ask it, and it will do the trick perfectly sometimes, which makes it all the more frustrating when it rolls over to lick its butt instead—you know the problem is not that it can’t but that it won’t.\nReprogramming by asking politely. The demos above and on this page all6 use the raw default GPT-3 model, without any additional training. Instead, to get all these different behaviors, one provides a short textual input to GPT-3, with which it will predict the next piece of text (as opposed to starting with an empty input and freely generating anything); GPT-3, just by reading it, can then flexibly adapt its writing style and reasoning and use new definitions or rules or words defined in the textual input no matter that it has never seen them before.\nWhat is meta-learning? This is considered “meta-learning” because GPT-3 has “learned how to learn”: in its endless training on so many gigabytes of text, it encounters so many different kinds of text that it had no choice but to learn abstractions & how to understand descriptions & instructions & formatting & authorial intent to let it adapt on the fly to the current piece of text it was training on, since there was too much diversity & data for it to simply learn each task normally by repeated exposure—much less memorize all the data. At scale, for a sufficiently powerful (large) NN, the simplest & easiest algorithms to learn for better prediction are abstractions & intelligence: the harder and bigger, the better. When GPT-3 meta-learns, the weights of the model do not change, but as the model computes layer by layer, the internal numbers become new abstractions which can carry out tasks it has never done before; in a sense, the GPT-3 model with the 175b parameters is not the real model—the real model is those ephemeral numbers which exist in between the input and the output, and define a new GPT-3 tailored to the current piece of text. The real GPT-3 is not the fixed hardwired weights, which merely are a bootstrap or a compiler for creating the real GPT-3, a new model customized to the data which exists only briefly in the soft attention weights during runtime, and may do completely different things from the baseline model.7 The longer the prompt (or more the examples), the more the prompt is like training the model.\nProgramming by dialogue? Because you aren’t finetuning GPT-3 in the conventional way, interacting with GPT-3 via its few-shot learning power takes on an entirely different feeling than anything else I’ve used before. With regular software, you have to think through exactly how to do something; with deep learning software, you have to focus on providing data which in some way embodies the correct answer which you want; but with GPT-3, you instead think about how to describe what you want. With GPT-3, it helps to anthropomorphize it: sometimes you literally just have to ask for what you want. (It can’t possibly be that easy, can it? Sometimes, it is!) Thus, you can simply ask it directly in the Q&A format: “what is X?” For example, if you want it to detect gibberish questions and avoid trying to answer them and show some understanding of its uncertainty, you can specify in the prompt that it shouldn’t answer nonsense questions, and you can ask it to double-check an earlier answer; if you find it doesn’t seem to understand that a horse has two eyes or that a toaster weighs more than a pencil, perhaps asking more questions with better settings will fix that. Other times, you must instead think, “If a human had already written out what I wanted, what would the first few sentences sound like? What would the introduction and summary sound like? What if I told a story here, how would that story start?” Thus, the summarization prompt: “My second grader asked me what this passage means: …” Some tasks in the GPT-3 paper which showed disappointing performance can be improved dramatically by finding appropriate formatting or prompts: arithmetic improves enormously with comma formatting of decimals (due to BPEs), and the “Word in Context” benchmark (where GPT-3 surprisingly showed below-chance performance compared to the 85% SOTA) can be improved to >70% with better prompting, while on MNLI & SuperGLUE benchmarks better RoBERTa prompts are worth hundreds of datapoints. Or Reynolds & 2021 demonstrate that the GPT-3 paper substantially underestimates GPT-3’s ability to translate Fr → En: to my considerable surprise, the straightforward 10-example translation prompt Brown et al used is actually worse than the zero-shot “French: XYZ / English:”, because, apparently, when formatted that way the 10-shots look like a narrative to follow rather than merely demonstrative examples. Even for BERT or GPT-2, large gains in performance are possible by directly optimizing the prompt instead of guessing ( et al 2019, 2021). (Outputs can be further improved in a knowledge-free way by calibrating sets of outputs to compensate for the vagaries of greedy sampling, which would again not be possible if the knowledge were not in GPT-3 to begin with.)\nSampling Can Prove The Presence Of Knowledge But Not The Absence\nGPT-3 may “fail” if a prompt is poorly-written, does not include enough examples, or bad sampling settings are used. I have demonstrated this many times when someone shows a “failure” of GPT-3—the failure was their own. The question is not whether a given prompt works, but whether any prompt works.\nAny child psychologist trained in administering IQ tests is well-aware of the need to build rapport with children, to monitor them for problems and gauge their linguistic skills: are they not a native English speaker? Are they angry with or afraid of the psychologist? Are they apathetic and unmotivated? It is hard to ace an IQ test by accident, but it’s trivial to fail one on purpose; trying to administer an IQ test to a child who has taken a disliking to you is a waste of the time of everyone involved, and presenting the resulting score as meaningful is professional malpractice.\nThe Lizardman Constant: nonsense prompt completions by humans.\nAnother cautionary example comes from survey research. To briefly review Scott Alexander’s “lizardman constant”: human survey-takers will, with >0% probability, endorse the most absurd items on a survey, for a mix of reasons like laziness, boredom, humor, sabotage, ignorance, and stupidity. For example, 4% of respondents may endorse the claim ‘lizard-people rule the earth’, 5% of atheists believe in God, and so on. (And these are not necessarily transient random errors—when challenged explicitly on them, researchers find many will come up with bizarre rationalizations to explain responses like how they answered ‘yes’ to “I have had a fatal heart attack”.) This cautions us against taking survey results about extremely unusual people or traits too literally, or expecting perfectly accurate results, as given the lizardman constant and other crud factors, it is entirely possible that some or all of the outliers may just be the lizardman constant at work.\nHumans need prompt programming too. Should we conclude from such cases that humans, or at least some specific humans, are not actually intelligent? No, of course not. We would say that such people have simply not been properly instructed or educated, given incentive to be honest, or made normal unavoidable errors. It would be tendentious in the extreme to conclude that because some people will claim to have suffered fatal heart attacks that they are merely statistical pattern-matching machines emitting plausible yet semantically-null utterances while passing for human; if we want to conclude that, I hope we would probe them a little more thoughtfully than prompting them with some survey items and declaring the case closed!\nDemand more from critics. We should expect nothing less of people testing GPT-3, when they claim to get a low score (much less stronger claims like “all language models, present and future, are unable to do X”): did they consider problems with their prompt? Whether all of the hyperparameters make sense for that task? Did they examine where completions go wrong, to get an idea of why GPT-3 is making errors? Did they test out a variety of strategies? Did they consider qualitatively how the failed completions sound? (Or did they copy-paste arbitrary hyperparameters, use the first prompt that came to mind, look at the output, and lazily present it to the world as proof of what GPT-3 can’t do?)\nMachine sympathy. Prompt programming often should be human-like: if a human wouldn’t understand what was intended, why would GPT-3? It’s not telepathic, and there are myriads of genres of human text which the few words of the prompt could belong to. (A helpful thought experiment: if someone emailed you a prompt out of the blue, with no other context whatsoever, what would you interpret it as? A joke, a troll, spam, or what?) Prompts should obey Gricean maxims of communication—statements should be true, informative, and relevant. One should not throw in irrelevant details or non sequiturs, because in human text, even in fiction, that implies that those details are relevant, no matter how nonsensical a narrative involving them may be.8 When a given prompt isn’t working and GPT-3 keeps pivoting into other modes of completion, that may mean that one hasn’t constrained it enough by imitating a correct output, and one needs to go further; writing the first few words or sentence of the target output may be necessary. (This was a particular problem with the literary parodies: GPT-3 would keep starting with it, but then switch into, say, one-liner reviews of famous novels, or would start writing fanfictions, complete with self-indulgent prefaces. The solution was to write out the first 2 or 3 sentences of an example parody, and then GPT-3 would finish out the parody, look back and see that there was an example of a literary parody, and then happily start generating dozens of works+parody pairs, once it fell into the groove.) The more natural the prompt, like a ‘title’ or ‘introduction’, the better; unnatural-text tricks that were useful for GPT-2, like dumping in a bunch of keywords bag-of-words-style to try to steer it towards a topic, appear less effective or harmful with GPT-3.\nSurprisingly powerful. Prompts are perpetually surprising—I kept underestimating what GPT-3 would do with a given prompt, and as a result, I underused it. Text is a weird way to try to input all these queries and output their results or examine what GPT-3 thinks (compared to a more natural NLP approach like using BERT’s embeddings), and fiddly. Just as few people would have thought that you could get GPT-2 to automatically summarize text by simply appending a “TL;DR:” string, few people would guess GPT-3 could write emoji summaries or that if you use a prompt like “Summarize the plot of J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter in the style of Ernest Hemingway”, you might get out a dozen profanity-laced reviews panning 20th-century literature (or a summary—in Chinese—of the Chinese translation9), or that if you use a prompt like “Transformer AI poetry: Poetry classics as reimagined and rewritten by an artificial intelligence”, GPT-3 will generate poems but then immediately generate explanations of how neural networks work & discussions from eminent researchers like Gary Marcus of why they will never be able to truly learn or exhibit creativity like generating poems. It is difficult to try out variations on prompts because as soon as the prompt works, it’s tempting to keep trying out completions to marvel at the sheer variety and quality as you are seduced into further exploring possibility-space. (GPT-3 never grows impatient or bored.) What other capabilities are latent, waiting to be exposed by someone stumbling across the right prompt?\n(Of course, not all these capabilities are necessarily desirable: where there is programming, you can be sure there is hacking. Where there is “prompt programming”, there must be “prompt hacking”… GPT-3 can follow instructions, so within its context-window or with any external memory, it is surely Turing-complete, and who knows what weird machines or adversarial reprogrammings are possible? Consider the AI Dungeon users as an early example of “prompt hacking”.)\nFinetuning\nFinetuning was necessary to ‘program’ GPT-2. GPT-3’s “prompt programming” paradigm is strikingly different from GPT-2, where its prompts were brittle and you could only tap into what you were sure were extremely common kinds of writing, and, as like as not, it would quickly change its mind and go off writing something else. At best, you could fairly generically hint at a topic to try to at least get it to use keywords; then you would have to filter through quite a few samples to get one that really wowed you. (This was a trick I used for TWDNE to get it to generate at least vaguely anime-related plot summaries.) To get output reliably out of GPT-2, you had to finetune it on a preferably decent-sized corpus.\nDo we need finetuning given GPT-3’s prompting? But with GPT-3, you can just say so, and odds are good that it can do what you ask, and already knows what you’d finetune it on. (For example, I thought I would have to finetune GPT-3 to get samples of myself, since GPT-2 doesn’t know anything about “Gwern”/“gwern.net”; but it turns out, all I have to do is put in “A new essay by Gwern Branwen (gwern.net):” and out comes an uncanny simulacrum of myself, or Scott Alexander, or Paul Graham, or…) Would it be better if finetuned? Indubitably. But it’s not necessary. And given the creativity of the non-finetuned GPT-3, I’m not sure that I even want to—and forfeit all the behaviors I haven’t yet discovered‽\nAs of mid-June 2020, the OpenAI API does not support finetuning although OA was working on it. But after enough time playing with GPT-3, I have begun to wonder: at this level of meta-learning & general knowledge, do we need finetuning at all?\nFor GPT-2, I saw finetuning as doing 2 things:\nFixing ignorance: missing domain knowledge\nGPT-2 didn’t know many things about most things—it was just a handful (1.5 billion) of parameters trained briefly on the tiniest fraction of the Common Crawl subset of the Internet, without any books even10. It’s not surprising that for many domains, it wouldn’t know the details; and even if the dataset included adequate text, it did not train on that data many times, and the knowledge competed with all the other domains it needed to know about, interfering.\nBut GPT-3 already knows everything! GPT-3 is so much larger on every dimension that this seems like much less of a problem for any domain which is already well-represented in public HTML pages. GPT-2 might need to be trained on a fanfiction corpus to learn about some obscure character in a random media franchise & generate good fiction, but GPT-3 already knows about them and use them appropriately in writing new fiction.\nPrompting a specific task:\nEven when GPT-2 knew a domain adequately, it had the frustrating behavior of rapidly switching domains. You might prompt it with a poem genre it knows adequately already, but then after a few lines, it would generate an end-of-text BPE and switch to generating a news article on Donald Trump. (Trump shows up a lot.) Presumably, while poetry was reasonably represented, it was still rare enough that GPT-2 considered poetry highly unlikely to be the next word, and keeps trying to jump to some more common & likely kind of text, and GPT-2 is not smart enough to infer & respect the intent of the prompt.\nGPT-3 exhibits much less of this ‘mode switching’ sort of behavior. Perhaps because it is trained on a much larger and more comprehensive dataset (so news articles aren’t so dominant), but also I suspect the meta-learning makes it much better at staying on track and inferring the intent of the prompt—hence things like the “Transformer poetry” prompt, where despite being what must be highly unusual text, even when switching to prose, it is able to improvise appropriate followup commentary.\nNevertheless, sometimes we can’t or don’t want to rely on prompt programming. A specific task may be necessary when a task has evaded our prompt programming skills, or we have data but not prompt programmer time. For example, in the GPT-3 paper, many tasks underperform what GPT-3 can do if we take the time to tailor the prompts & sampling hyperparameters, and just throwing the naive prompt formatting at GPT-3 is misleading. However, researchers do not have the time to go through scores of benchmark tasks and fix them one by one; simply finetuning on them collectively ought to do at least as well as the correct prompts would, and requires much less human effort (albeit more infrastructure).\nSo, what would be the point of finetuning GPT-3 on poetry or literature? It has likely already seen the finetuning corpus, knows most of it, and will tractably generate poems on demand. There may be gains, but I wonder if they would be nearly as large as they were for GPT-2?\nPlayground\nAll of the following samples were generated using the OpenAI Beta Playground, which looks like this:\nThe Playground has some rough edges in Beta, and capacity issues. A good way to start is to generate samples with the log probs/logits turned on, and paying attention to how sampling hyperparameters affect output, to gain intuition for how GPT-3 thinks & what samples looks like when sampling goes haywire.\nTradeoff: diversity vs accuracy. It offers the standard sampling options familiar from earlier GPT-2 interfaces, including “nucleus sampling”. One particularly manipulates the temperature setting to bias towards wilder or more predictable completions; for fiction, where creativity is paramount, it is best set high, perhaps as high as 1, but if one is trying to extract things which can be right or wrong, like question-answering, it’s better to set it low to ensure it prefers the most likely completion. (After all, the point of a high temperature is to regularly select completions which the model thinks aren’t likely; why would you do that if you are trying to get out a correct arithmetic or trivia question answer?) For topp, one can set it to ~0.95 and largely forget about it unless one suspects that it’s breaking answers like top-k and it needs to be much lower, like 0.5; it’s there to cut off the tail of gibberish completions and reduce repetition, so doesn’t affect the creativity too much. I generally avoid the use of the repetition penalties because I feel repetition is critical to creative fiction, and I’d rather err on the side of too much than too little, but sometimes they are a useful intervention; GPT-3, sad to say, maintains some of the weaknesses of GPT-2 and other likelihood-trained autoregressive sequence models, such as the propensity to fall into degenerate repetition.\nRanking final results for quality gain. A little more unusually, it offers a “best of” (BO) option which is the Meena ranking trick (other names include “generator rejection sampling” or “random-sampling shooting method”: generate n possible completions independently, and then pick the one with best total likelihood, which avoids the degeneration that an explicit tree/beam search would unfortunately trigger, as documented most recently by the nucleus sampling paper & reported by many others about likelihood-trained text models in the past eg. char-RNN in 201511ya, Koehn & Knowles, or et al 201811). I’m not sure how to best use BO: it seems to be highly helpful for things with one right answer (such as tricky Q&A or reasoning), but when it helps with ‘creative’ completions is less clear. I tried out BO heavily because I couldn’t quite figure out how it interacts with quality. On the smaller models, it seems to help boost quality up towards ‘davinci’ (GPT-3-175b) levels without causing too much trouble, but on davinci, it appears to exacerbate the usual sampling issues: particularly with poetry, it’s easy for a GPT to fall into repetition traps or loops, or spit out memorized poems, and BO makes that much more likely. For generating completions of famous poems, it’s quite hard to get GPT-3 to generate new versions unless you actively edit the poem to force a difference. (In the most extreme case, in the case of generating new variations on “Jabberwocky”, I have been unable to generate any new versions under any setting, even taking the step of aggressively editing in new lines about how the vorpal sword bounced off the Jabberwocky and it won… It always spits out chunks of the original.12) So BO is a double-edged sword.\nThe best way I found to use it is to sample without it (BO=1) at max temp, and then once it has several distinctly different lines, then sampling with more (eg. BO=5) seems to help rather than hurt. This is a little surprising to me because for Meena, it made a large difference to do even a little BO, and while it had diminishing returns, I don’t think there was any point they tested where higher best-of-n made responses actually much worse (as opposed to merely n times more expensive). Possibly BO is much more useful for nonfiction/information-processing tasks, where there’s one correct answer and BO can help overcome errors introduced by sampling or myopia.\nEffective Prompt Programming\nTo constrain the behavior of a program precisely to a range may be very hard, just as a writer will need some skill to express just a certain degree of ambiguity. A computer is like a violin. You can imagine a novice trying first a phonograph and then a violin. The latter, he says, sounds terrible. That is the argument we have heard from our humanists and most of our computer scientists. Computer programs are good, they say, for particular purposes, but they aren’t flexible. Neither is a violin, or a typewriter, until you learn how to use it.\nMarvin Minsky, “Why Programming Is a Good Medium for Expressing Poorly-Understood and Sloppily-Formulated Ideas” 1967\nAnthropomorphize your prompts. There is no substitute for testing out a number of prompts to see what different completions they elicit and to reverse-engineer what kind of text GPT-3 “thinks” a prompt came from, which may not be what you intend and assume (after all, GPT-3 just sees the few words of the prompt—it’s no more a telepath than you are). If you ask it a question to test its commonsense reasoning like “how many eyes does a horse have” and it starts completing with a knock-knock joke, you need to rethink your prompt! Does it spit out completions that look like it’s thinking but it’s executing the wrong algorithm, or it falls back to copying parts of the input? Then one may need to few-shot it by providing examples to guide it to one of several possible things to do. One should also keep in mind the importance of sampling parameters, and whether one is looking for a single correct answer (so low temp with BO=1 if compute-limited, or high temp and BO=20 if possible) or if one is trying for creative answers (high temp with repetition penalties).\nThe 4 Horsemen: short context, bad prompts, BPEs, random sampling. My rule of thumb when dealing with GPT-3 is that if it is messing up, the errors are usually attributable to one of 4 problems: too-short context windows, insufficient prompt engineering, BPE encoding making GPT-3 ‘blind’ to what it needs to see to understand & solve a problem, or noisy sampling sabotaging GPT-3’s attempts to show what it knows. Another useful heuristic is to try to express something as a multi-step reasoning process or “inner monologue”, such as a dialogue: because GPT-3 is a feedforward NN, it can only solve tasks which fit within one “step” or forward pass; any given problem may be too inherently serial for GPT-3 to have enough ‘thinking time’ to solve it, even if it can successfully solve each intermediate sub-problem within a step. So people have demonstrated that GPT-3 won’t solve a simple math problem in a single step, but it will solve it if you reframe it as a ‘dialogue’ with the anime character Holo—who knew neural network research would lead to anime wolfgirl demonology?—and even ask it to guess-and-check or brute-force the answer (see also et al 2021); one can also experiment in coaching it through examples13, or requiring reasons for an answer to show its work, or asking it about previous answers or using “uncertainty prompts”. This makes sense if we think of Transformers as unrolled RNNs which unfortunately lack a hidden state: serializing out the reasoning helps overcome that computational limitation.\nLogprob debugging. GPT-3 does not directly emit text, but it instead predicts the probability (or “likelihood”) of the 51k possible BPEs given a text; instead of merely feeding them into some randomized sampling process like temperature top-k/topp sampling, one can also record the predicted probability of each BPE conditional on all the previous BPEs. This gives you a simple idea of what GPT-3 is thinking about each BPE: is it likely or unlikely (given the previous BPEs)? Which BPEs are especially unlikely? Does it “get it” as the completion goes on? I don’t use logprobs much but I generally use them in 1 of 3 ways: I use them to see if the prompt ‘looks weird’ to GPT-3; to see where in a completion it ‘goes off the rails’ (suggesting the need for lower temperatures/topp or higher BO); and to peek at possible completions to see how uncertain it is about the right answer—a good example of that is Arram Sabeti’s uncertainty prompts investigation where the logprobs of each possible completion gives you an idea of how well the uncertainty prompts are working in getting GPT-3 to put weight on the right answer, or in my parity analysis where I observed that the logprobs of 0 vs 1 were almost exactly 50:50 no matter how many samples I added, showing no trace whatsoever of few-shot learning happening. Thus, logprobs can offer more insight while debugging a prompt than just repeatedly hitting ‘complete’ and getting frustrated.\nAI Dungeon ≠ GPT-3\nI strongly recommend against use of the Dragon model as a “GPT-3” model. The finetuning appears to have seriously degraded the model, in addition to the censoring & filtering now done.\nAs of June 2021, I recommend either waiting for API access or using GPT-J (high quality albeit 2 OOMs smaller).\nAI Dungeon < GPT-3. For people using the AI Dungeon (AID) route, things are tricky because AID users don’t have the same sampling options that API users do (no best-of is particularly painful when trying to elicit correct answers to hard questions), and no control over the full prompt/history, with AID doing lots of things behind the scenes on a model that may have been finetuned on RPG-like material & countless AID game transcripts etc., and with quality of model completely out of their hands (does choosing “custom” get you Dragon, or do you have to choose a different mode & edit it? the necessary trick seems to change over time), with occasional drastic quality drops reported by many AID users when… something changes on the backend (as, most dramatically, it did in March 2021, seriously degrading quality). For example, if you are an AID user, were you aware that the first response for a custom prompt is actually always GPT-2, to try to block backdoor GPT-3 access? Or that OA requires toxicity filters? Or that “We cut off the generation at certain points (trailing sentences etc..) Disable certain tokens to improve performance or make generation safer, fine-tune on text adventures and only use the last ~1000 tokens of context.” Sampling is further modified by directly adjusting the logits before sampling. A cautionary example of AID use comes from Gary Marcus & Ernest Davis’s use: they filtered a large number of questions through AID to try to find cases GPT-3 would fail on; however, when the AID failure cases were tested on GPT-3 by Douglas Summers-Stay, it solved half of them! (AID is designed to produce fun text adventures, not be a NLP testbed, and that shows when one tries to use AID as a backdoor to GPT-3. It’s worth noting that prompts do not transfer between models and it stands to reason that they do not necessarily transfer between original vs finetuned models either.) To work around this, AID users seem to need to warm up sessions carefully with descriptive prompts/interactions to overcome the gamification, and avoid anything that might veer back into comedy or drama. And as AID itself is constantly changing, the necessary tricks & quality also change (not always for the better).\nThe root cause of Dragon issues—much-inferior performance, the need for ‘warmup’, the bizarre frequency of snuff endings reported by users, persistent unwanted intrusions by characters like “Count Grey” etc.—all seem to trace back to the corpus that Dragon was finetuned on. A closer look at the original finetuning data in May 2021 by an “Aurora” revealed that the data was far lower quality than anyone had realized; in addition to simply being wretched writing, it includes much highly objectionable content (rape, torture, child molestation & murder etc.). Finetuning on such a dataset is highly ill-advised, and explains many of the oddities about Dragon vs GPT-3. (The ‘warmup’, for example, may be necessary to convince the model to switch to ‘high-quality mode’, as it defaults to imitating the finetuning data; similar to how one must avoid typos & errors in GPT-3 prompts lest GPT-3 infer the author is an idiot and quite sensibly predict the completion is more idiotic text.)\nOnly once these have been ruled out do I start considering alternative explanations like “language models will never solve X”.\nWeaknesses\nLimited memory, repetition/divergence, BPE encoding. GPT-3 is, of course, not perfect. We should keep that in mind when evaluating it. As a scaled-up GPT-2, it has mostly the same weaknesses, and my thoughts on improvements remain mostly the same (aside from moving away from BPEs, which need is becoming increasingly urgent; see the next section).\nArtificial intelligence programs like deep learning neural networks may be able to beat humans at playing Go or chess, or doing arithmetic, or writing Navy Seal copypasta, but they will never be able to truly think for themselves, to have consciousness, to feel any of the richness and complexity of the world that we mere humans can feel. Mere, unenlightened humans might be impressed by the abilities of simple deep learning programs, but when looked at in a more holistic manner, it all adds up to… well, nothing. They still don’t exhibit any trace of consciousness. All of the available data support the notion that humans feel and experience the world differently than computers do. While a computer can beat a human master at chess or Go or some other game of structured rules, it will never be able to truly think outside of those rules, it will never be able to come up with its own new strategies on the fly, it will never be able to feel, to react, the way a human can. Artificial intelligence programs lack consciousness and self-awareness. They will never be able to have a sense of humor. They will never be able to appreciate art, or beauty, or love. They will never feel lonely. They will never have empathy for other people, for animals, for the environment. They will never enjoy music or fall in love, or cry at the drop of a hat. Merely by existing, mere, unenlightened humans are intellectually superior to computers, no matter how good our computers get at winning games like Go or Jeopardy. We don’t live by the rules of those games. Our minds are much, much bigger than that.\nWait, I’m sorry—that preceding paragraph on the weaknesses of deep learning was actually written by GPT-3, and is in the wrong section. (Management regrets the mistake.) But seriously, what weaknesses does GPT-3 have?\nSmall Context Window\nNo memory (fixable). The first limit is that it remains hobbled by the limited context window. GPT-3 has no form of memory or recurrence, so it cannot see anything outside its limited 2048 BPEs (roughly, 500–1000 words). This means it cannot hope to write anything of any serious length, because the beginning will soon vanish over the event horizon, and it also limits its ability to engage in few-shot learning, for the same reason: the prompt+generation will quickly exceed the window length. While the damage may be limited for tasks where the format is repetitive, like Q&A (so GPT-3 can do the necessary meta-learning over its completions just as well as over the original prompt), this does limit it and is frustrating. There are many possible solutions to quadratic attention.\nRepetition/Divergence Sampling\nRepetition/gibberish (mystery). Autoregressive language models trained by likelihood (prediction) loss all share an extremely annoying problem: when you generate free-form completions, they have a tendency to eventually fall into repetitive loops of gibberish. Whether GPT-2 or T5 or etc., they all seem to do it, and if one tries to avoid such extremely dumb & crude sampling strategies like top-k temperature sampling by doing explicit search for likely text completions, such as beam search sampling, these searches actually make the problem worse, and the better your search is, the worse the results are. Tweaks like nucleus sampling can reduce it, but do not eliminate it. (No one has tried gradient ascent for generating optimal samples, as far as I know.) Since GPT-2-1.5b seemed almost as prone as GPT-2-117M, I was unsurprised to find that GPT-3 too falls easily into the repetition trap.\nWhy repetition? This behavior remains puzzling and I don’t think anyone really knows how to fix it. Top-k or nucleus sampling can’t be right and are clearly ugly ad hoc hacks, but is the core problem likelihood training or sampling, or what? And why is it never a problem for other kinds of sequences like images, and much less of one for music, or in tasks like neural translation where tricks like beam search are always used because they do improve? (We don’t see it in char-RNNs or GPT-2s trained on ABC/MIDI music, or OA Jukebox trained on raw audio; we certainly don’t see it in iGPT or PixelRNN etc.) Likelihood training is compellingly simple and efficient, and we know that real brains are constantly predicting future inputs; it seems implausible that the entire problem will disappear if we slap on some Bayesian tricks to get posterior estimates of the likelihood of each possible BPE completion (and I’m not aware of anyone showing that it does in something like a small Bayesian RNN trained with HMC or by using deep ensembling or other Bayesian approximations). Further, if likelihood training is so bad, why does minimizing the predictive loss work so consistently over a wide range to improve the quality of generations and how useful the model is for zero/few-shot learning or semi-supervised tasks, and why does the loss correlate near-perfectly with human ratings of quality in the Meena paper?\nLanguage Prediction = Imitation Learning? My intuition is that the repetition trap is essentially the DAgger/off-policy imitation learning problem in a non-RL guise: as the model is fed back in its own guesses as a ground truth, the confabulated text becomes gradually more off-policy and divergent from real human-written text (which is backed by a knowledge base & a purpose), and the model is unable to come up with sensible continuations (having never trained on such gibberish) and does not ‘want’ to get back on track (having been trained purely to make one-step predictions). The solution might look something like detecting when a completion might go too far off-distribution and backtracking, or more RL-like training of generation as opposed to mere prediction. It would probably help also to use some sort of hierarchical or planning method: one might be able to convince GPT-3 to generate summaries and then expand each line of the summary recursively ( et al 2020 does something similar using a bag-of-words topic with GPT-2/BART to “upscale” a seed; the most impressive demonstration of recursive generation thus far is DeepMind’s “Dramatron” which can write coherent screenplays).\nBPEs\nCompared to GPT-2, GPT-3 improves performance on character-level tasks like rhyming, alliteration, punning, anagrams or permutations, acrostic poems, and arithmetic less than expected, despite being very good at many other closely-related kinds of writings like satire.\nWhy? A plausible explanation is an obscure technical detail: as a performance optimization, GPT does not see characters but ~51k word or sub-word-chunks called “byte-pair encodings” (BPEs). A BPE can range from an individual letter like “e”, to words like “nine” (BPE #30,888 in the OA GPT-2 BPE vocab), to horrifying things like “rawdownloadcloneembedreportprint” (BPE #30,906). The number “10” might be encoded as just “10” (BPE #940), or it might be encoded as the token “1” (#16) followed by “0” (#15); the number 70710 (no commas!) might be encoded as “70710” (BPE #42,877) or… as quite a lot of different possible sequences of BPEs.\nBecause GPTs never see characters but opaque partial-words, which vary chaotically based on the specific word and even the surrounding context, they are unable to easily learn about character-level aspects of language, like similar spellings or sounds, and are forced to learn relationships much more indirectly, like by brute-force memorizing of pairs of words.\nSome experiments with reformatting GPT-3’s poorest-performing tasks to avoid inconsistent BPE encodings of strings shows small to large performance gains, consistent with this theory.\nBad at phonetic/character-level tasks. Disappointingly, the issues that have been noticed with GPT-2-poetry’s disinclination to rhyme remain. GPT-3 rhymes reasonably well and often when appropriate, but the improvement is much smaller on rhyming than it is on pretty much everything else. Apparently it is easier for GPT-3 to learn things like arithmetic and spreadsheets than it is to learn how to rhyme. (DeepMind’s 280b-parameter Gopher model is considerably better than GPT-3, but also uses BPEs and also cannot write rhyming poetry; GPT-NeoX-20B likewise struggles with un-formatted arithmetic; LaMDA doesn’t seem to have been prompted specifically yet but published instances of LaMDA poetry don’t rhyme; cf. 2021, et al 2021, et al 2022 et al 2022, et al 2022…) A similar issue comes with puns. Better, but not as much better as one would expect given the leap on many other capabilities. Trying to generate puns or rhymes, it seems like GPT-3 know extremely well what they are on an abstract level, and will appropriately manipulate words and attempt to make puns or rhymes (see the shoggoth-cat dialogue below for a particularly striking example), but the words it chooses just aren’t right on a phonetic basis. On the other hand, it’s not as if GPT-3 is unable to understand humor—it is a brilliant mimic with parodies, has a cutting wit for satire, and can generate one-liners easily like the “I have a joke” format (1, 2) or Drake memes, as long as they rely more on semantics than syntax.\nBPEs ≠ characters! My suspicion here is that these, and perhaps other issues, is due to the lossy BPE encoding. GPT models do not see individual characters, but instead a larger chunk, called a byte-pair encoding (BPE); a byte-pair is a simple compression scheme where 50,257 word fragments or characters are chosen to try to minimize the encoding length on some arbitrary text corpus, so a particularly common word may get a unique BPE while a longer word will be encoded as 2 or 3 BPEs, and a completely novel word will be encoded letter BPE by letter BPE as a fallback. Hence, even if 2 words sound and are spelled similarly, they may be given totally different BPE encodings which don’t have a single BPE in common.14 Thus, otherwise intelligent models can be surprisingly inept at spelling: the embedding of GPT-2 or RoBERTa, for example, can only spell a third of words.\nIf BPEs are the problem, then because the knowledge of phonetics is erased from the training data, GPT-3 cannot rhyme (anymore than you can color this piece of text as a synesthete sees it): there will be no clever prompt programming trick which suddenly makes it fluently rhyme, and scaling will deliver only minor improvements. Consistent with this thesis, many API users have tried hard to make GPT-3 rhyme, in part to prove me wrong about BPEs being the problem, and failed miserably: you may think you have gotten some rhyming, because GPT-3 has memorized some common rhymes, on the level of doggerel, but as soon as you try to get some novel rhymes or test it on specified words, the inability is clear.\nThe pervasive use of BPE encodings explains some of the failures of GPT/CLIP-related models (including DALL·E 2 & Imagen). Wired asks GPT-3 & GPT-4 to “Write a list of 10 words that are 6 letters long. Always make sure that the third letter is ‘k’.” and professes shock that it doesn’t work, and evidence we should not fall for the ‘hype’. In Water Cooler Trivia’s GPT-3 test, there are many signatures of BPE-induced damage: word play & pun-heavy questions were its two worst category of trivia questions despite good vocabulary performance, and WCT noted that its typical double-alliterative clues harmed GPT-3 performance & GPT-3 was unable to answer questions demanding words with specific numbers of letters. Paralleling my GPT-2-poetry’s poor rhyming, et al 2021 try to make a GPT-2 limerick model, and are puzzled that, without using a rhyming dictionary & apparatus to force rhymes, GPT-2 simply will not generate limericks even when finetuned on a limerick datase with n > 200026ya—it generates lines with too-long syllables, which never rhyme, often seem incoherent, and when it does succeed it has only memorized training examples. zwitterion notes that GPT-3’s “6 word stories” suffer from similar difficulties in counting exactly 6 words15, and we can point out that et al 2022’s call for explanations for why their “LMentry” benchmark tasks for GPT-3 models can show such low performance is already explained by most of their tasks taking the form of “which two words sound alike” or “what is the first letter of this word” (likewise serial startup founder Steve Newman’s puzzlement that GPT-4 cannot understand & correct letter-level errors produced by its diff code or concatenate characters to form prime numbers). Nostalgebraist discussed the extreme weirdness of BPEs and how they change chaotically based on whitespace, capitalization, and context for GPT-2, with a followup post for GPT-3 on the even weirder encoding of numbers sans commas.16 I read Nostalgebraist’s at the time, but I didn’t know if that was really an issue for GPT-2, because problems like lack of rhyming might just be GPT-2 being stupid, as it was rather stupid in many ways, and examples like the spaceless GPT-2-music model were ambiguous; I kept it in mind while evaluating GPT-3, however.\nEfficient… but limiting. BPE encoding is done because once a text is encoded into BPEs, it will be as much as a third the size, which given the context window limitation, means you can fit 3× more text into the window compared to the raw characters. This is indeed quite a gain, but it is a double-edged sword: it is confusing to write code for it because the BPE encoding of a text is unfamiliar & unpredictable (adding a letter can change the final BPEs completely), and the consequences of obscuring the actual characters from GPT are unclear. I think that BPEs bias the model and may make rhyming & puns extremely difficult because they obscure the phonetics of words; GPT-3 can still do it, but it is forced to rely on brute force, by noticing that a particular grab-bag of BPEs (all of the different BPEs which might encode a particular sound in its various words) correlates with another grab-bag of BPEs, and it must do so for every pairwise possibility. How can you ask GPT-3 to write a poem where every word starts with ‘s’ when ‘s’ encodes to, say, BPE #23, and every word that starts with ‘s’ like ‘Sally’ is encoded as Sal|l|y\n/ [2301,14,25]\n…? It’d be unsurprising if GPTs struggled to understand & manipulate things on the character level given that the entire point of BPE is to compress away characters as much as possible. (There are similar issues in neural machine translation: analytic languages, which use a relatively small number of unique words, aren’t too badly harmed by forcing text to be encoded into a fixed number of words, because the order matters more than what letters each word is made of; the lack of letters can be made up for by memorization & brute force. However, a synthetic language like Finnish or German—with their famously long words like kumarreksituteskenteleentuvaisehkollaismaisekkuudellisenneskenteluttelemattomammuuksissansakaankopahan or Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz/‘law to transfer duties of monitoring labelling of beef’ formed by constantly adding additional letters/words—has countless unique or extremely rare words no matter how large your corpus, all of whose internal structure of letters & sub-words is hidden by a word embedding, which destroys the ability to understand them.)\nReformatting to beat BPEs. I have further observed that GPT-3’s anagram capabilities appear to improve considerably if you separate each letter in an anagram with a space (guaranteeing that the letter will have the same BPE in both the scrambled & unscrambled versions). DutytoDevelop on the OA forums observes that rephrasing numbers in math problems as written-out words like “two-hundred and one” appears to boost algebra/arithmetic performance, and Matt Brockman has observed more rigorously by testing thousands of examples over several orders of magnitude, that GPT-3’s arithmetic ability—surprisingly poor, given we know far smaller Transformers work well in math domains (eg. et al 2019, Thopliterce, or GPT-2 for theorem-proving)—appears to dramatically improve several-fold if you merely format numbers with commas instead of being purely numeric (with an additional boost from using dollar signs), and et al 2021’s demonstration with T5 that decimal formatting is the worst of all number formats while scientific notation enables accurate addition/subtraction of 60-digit numbers. I confirmed this with my Turing dialogue example where GPT-3 fails badly on the arithmetic sans commas & low temperature, but often gets it exactly correct with commas.17 (Why? More written text may use commas when writing out implicit or explicit arithmetic, yes, but use of commas may also drastically reduce the number of unique BPEs as only 1–3 digit numbers will appear, with consistent BPE encoding, instead of having encodings which vary unpredictably over a much larger range.) I also note that GPT-3 improves on anagrams if given space-separated letters, despite the fact that this encoding is 3× larger. Likewise, acrostic poems just don’t work if we input them normally, but they do if we carefully expose the relevant individual letters. This explains naturally why rhyming/puns improve gradually with parameter/data size and why GPT-3 can so accurately define & discuss them, but there is never any ‘breakthrough’ like with its other capabilities. We assume character-level understanding so implicitly that we fail to even consider what things look like to GPT-3 after BPE encoding. (I have not been able to test whether GPT-3 will rhyme fluently given a proper encoding; I have tried out a number of formatting strategies, using the International Phonetic Alphabet to encode rhyme-pairs at the beginning or end of lines, annotated within lines, space-separated, and non-IPA-encoded, but while GPT-3 knows the IPA for more English words than I would’ve expected, none of the encodings show a breakthrough in performance like with arithmetic/anagrams/acrostics. It’s worth noting that et al 2020 had to train their rhyme-specific sonnet-only model directly on character-level representations of end-rhyme pairs.)\nBPE sabotage is common. Thus far, the BPE encoding appears to sabotage performance on rhyming, alliteration, punning, anagrams or permutations or ROT13 encodings, acrostics, arithmetic, and Melanie Mitchell’s Copycat-style letter analogies (GPT-3 fails without spaces on “abc : abcd :: ijk : ijl” but succeeds when space-separated, although it doesn’t solve all letter analogies and may or may not improve with priming using Mitchell’s own article as the prompt; compare with a 5-year-old child). OA’s GPT-f work on using GPT for MetaMath formal theorem-proving notes that they use the standard GPT-2 BPE but “preliminary experimental results demonstrate possible gains with specialized tokenization techniques.” I wonder what other subtle GPT artifacts BPEs may be causing?18 For example, consider puns: BPEs mean that GPT-3 can’t learn puns because it doesn’t see the phonetic or spelling that drives verbal humor in dropping down to a lower level of abstraction & then back up; but the training data will still be filled with verbal humor—so what does GPT-3 learn from all that? Perhaps it learns that “humor” is a kind of writing where the convention is to tell a superficially sensible story which then ends in an (apparently) arbitrary randomly-chosen word… Another question is foreign languages like Russian; one user noticed that when they triggered Russian, completions seemed to work one Cyrillic letter at a time, which hints that it sees Russian encoded as individual characters, but attempts to trigger rhyming or puns just yielded Russian gibberish, perhaps showing the flip side of the BPE problem—with a fixed small context window, not using BPEs, particularly on low n data (Russian is ~0.18% of the GPT-3 training dataset), may itself hamper performance badly.19 (One has to assume that a synthetic & low-resource language like Turkish will be just gibberish. Transfer learning from English only goes so far.) Nor is GPT-3 the only system that will be affected: downstream users of GPT-3 outputs can be misled by its errors, particularly since other AI systems will be blind to tokenization-related errors in the same way.\nFixing BPEs. BPEs were useful for smaller models that needed as much context window as possible and which wouldn’t benefit much from access to the raw characters (or would be harmed because they’d underfit), but in another example of the “The Bitter Lesson”, it appears it is time to discard them as we are able to pay more compute for better results. This is fixable by the same methods as fixing the context window; once the context window limit is broken and one has effective contexts of, say, l=60k, then one can afford to spend 40k of it moving to character-based inputs. Another idea, if character-level models are still infeasible, is to try to manually encode the knowledge of phonetics, at least, somehow; one way might be to data-augment inputs by using linguistics libraries to convert random texts to International Phonetic Alphabet (which GPT-3 already understands to some extent). By seeing a phonetic-encoded version of random texts, it should learn what words sound similar even if they have radically different BPE representations.\nA third idea is “BPE dropout”: randomize the BPE encoding, sometimes dropping down to character-level & alternative sub-word BPE encodings, averaging over all possible encodings to force the model to learn that they are all equivalent without losing too much context window while training any given sequence. More broadly than BPE dropout, one could try mixing in a small percentage of text which is character-encoded throughout training—similar to the logic of high-quality data where even a small percentage in the training corpus can support learning from large amounts of web-quality data, it may be that 1% or less of the text being character-encoded would be adequate. (Alternately, because character-encoding costs context, but models learn only gradually how to use the full context, and continue to predict poorly the most distant context, one could take a curriculum learning approach, and go from 100% character-encoded to 100% BPE over the course of training. The character-encoding at the beginning will be less dense, but that will be when the full context window is least useful.)\nAnd there may be encodings which just work better than BPEs, like unigrams (comparison) or CANINE or Charformer. Character-level models like ByT5 & MegaByte are proof-of-concept that if architected carefully, character models come at relatively modest additional cost, and are both simpler & often better than their sub-word counterparts. Finally, at some point perhaps we will bite the bitter bullet of abandoning text entirely in favor of whole images or bit streams as the ultimate in generalization?\nCopyright\nGenerative models this good always raise the same sets of question: is this just memorizing the training data? How do you know it’s creative? Who owns the model? Who owns the model outputs? For GPT-3, these questions have much the same answers as they do for StyleGAN:\nCreativity: GPT-3 has, like any well-educated human, memorized vast reams of material and is happy to emit them when that seems like an appropriate continuation & how the ‘real’ online text might continue; GPT-3 is capable of being highly original, it just doesn’t care about being original20, and the onus is on the user to craft a prompt which elicits new text, if that is what is desired, and to spot-check novelty.\nNevertheless, GPT-3 is often original and one can easily check that many of its completions have no similar version online.\nCopyright: copyright applies to multiple places:\nthe GPT-3 model itself: OpenAI owns the copyright, and not anyone who contributed to the dataset, as it is a transformative work. Should someone else train their own model, they will own the copyright to theirs.21\ngenerated GPT-3 completions: US copyright law requires a human to make a de minimis creative contribution of some sort—even the merest selection, filtering, or editing is enough. A dump of random GPT-3 samples (such as the one OA released on Github) has no copyright (is public domain). However, if you are filtering through completions, or you are tweaking the settings, or you are carefully engineering a prompt based on weeks of experience (as I do in this page), then there is almost certainly a de minimis human contribution and thus a copyright is created, owned (presumably) by the human.\nThe completions on this page are all curated and carefully prompted, and so almost certainly copyrighted. However, I release them all under the CC-0 public domain license; the reader may do what they wish with them (although if you write a fanfic or make a piece of music based on them, as nshepperd did with “The Universe is a Glitch”, I would like to know!).\nthe GPT-3 API: because access to GPT-3 is only through the API, additional conditions could be set in the Terms of Service, such as the user agreeing to assign the copyright to the API owner. (While this would not be possible for text completions with no copyright, that applies only to random text dumps, which is the least interesting use of the API; all more interesting uses, using custom prompts, would be vulnerable to the API Terms of Service.)\nFormat\nIn the samples below, bold denotes all human-written input; everything not in bold is computer-written.22 For multiple completions of the same prompt, I omit the prompt with a bold ellipsis: “…” In my other GPT samples, I have generally used codeblock formatting, but GPT-3 samples are often long lines (and more worth reading), so here, I have tried to edit the samples as little as possible while still keeping them readable in blockquotes.\nAs far as the sampling goes: I used the largest “davinci” GPT-3-175b model unless otherwise specified. (Davinci is the highest quality and not too slow: ~147 WPM.) Since I only speak English well, I avoid testing any foreign language material. These are not all samples I generated the first time: I was regularly editing the prompts & sampling settings as I explored prompts & possible completions. The sampling settings were generally roughly as I advise above: high temperature, slight p truncation & repetition/presence penalty, occasional use of high BO where it seems potentially helpfully (specifically, anything Q&A-like, or where it seems like GPT-3 is settling for local optima while greedily sampling but longer high-temperature completions jump out to better completions).\nI am not claiming that these samples are strictly scientific and best-of-5 or anything. (I would guess that the selections below are roughly best-of-2 on average.) However, the samples are only minimally edited during generation. I attempted to exercise curation rather than editing, so I did not edit the computer text; I kept them as-is, or I deleted the entire section to re-sample. But if readers still think I wrote the best parts of this page, then I will shamelessly steal the credit.\nFailure Cases\nOf the attempts, which ones were the worst and why?\nIn the fiction/poetry experiments, I think the most flagrant failure was e. e. cummings’s “grasshopper”-style experimental poetry: it is inherently visual, a concrete poetry, meant to be looked at as a whole—almost 3D. This would be hard to learn from simple 2D sequences of text tokens, even if the BPEs were fixed; LLMs would seem to need vision added (like GPT-4-V or GPT-4o), and maybe extensive training on ASCII art as well (currently all memorized), before one could expect much there.\nThere was a general problem of the more quoted a writer, the harder it was to avoid plagiarism/memorization, like Poe’s “Raven”—over-memorization appears to be an inverse scaling effect, so simply scaling up models may make them much more promptable in the style of a specific author, in addition to any effects from more specialized training like RLHF/instruction-tuning. (One can easily imagine a lot of training samples along the lines of ‘Write a poem in the style of X’ or ‘continue the poem “Y”’, which would help break out of the default memorization completion.)\nRhyming can also be solved, to some degree, by scaling, as the models simply memorize ever more rhyme-pairs; but the best solution remains fixing the BPE tokenization, to gain general phonetics & spelling capabilities rather than memorization.\nI was struck by the Dr Seuss samples being worse than I expected: he seems simple, and the rhymes he uses common enough to memorize, so why are they bad? On reflection, the problem with Dr Seuss may be that the LLM doesn’t understand that Seuss is “constrained writing”. For example, The Cat in the Hat supposedly uses only 236 unique words, and Green Eggs and Ham uses exactly 50 due to a bet—these facts are in the training corpus, doubtless, but that sort of meta-reasoning is difficult, and it is hard to notice the constraints because they are mostly invisible inside a short context window. (How can one know how many total unique words were used in a book when the book is split across a large number of context windows? The genius of Dr Seuss is that each individual passage reads so naturally!) And even if the model ‘knows’ in some sense, that doesn’t mean that during generation, a model knows that there are only 50 words (or what those 50 words are) and is carefully ensuring that it doesn’t go outside the list. This could potentially be solved by much more explicit instructions and inner-monologue techniques revising generated passages to satisfy the constraints, or by the fancier sampling frameworks which directly control generation to comply with constraints.\nFinally, any kind of “wisdom literature” like epigrams or proverbs was bad. This is because they rely on ‘novelty’ at an abstract level, in which each one is meant to be different from the next, and because they are typically the result of lots of thought and curation over decades or even centuries, boiling down long lists of candidates into a few gems. A LLM would have to be truly superhuman to generate a list of such things freestyle, without revision, just one by one. This has no viable solution, even as of June 2024—search and planning remain the most important things we don’t know how to make LLMs do. (There is no ‘AlphaGo of LLMs’, and we do not know how to take a GPT-4 and make it ponder for millions of tokens and come back with a short list of 100 aphorisms that will amaze us.)\nNonfiction\nDialogue\nShoggoth-Cat\nIt’s all text. What does the desired task look like? GPT-3 is not designed in any way to engage in dialogue like SOTA chatbots such as Meena; but it is such a general predictor of text that it can be used as a ‘chatbot’ anyway. GPT-3 can be triggered into a chatbot mode simply by labeling roles; one can have an “AI” and “human” chat with each other (GPT-3 does that well), or one can take on one of the roles by editing the text appropriately after each “AI” completion (remember, prompt-programming is purely textual, and can be anything you want). The Playground provides a simple chat-bot mode which will insert “AI:”/“Human:” text and newlines as necessary to make it a little more pleasant, but one can override that (and that’s useful for getting more than one short line out of the “AI”, as I will demonstrate in the Turing dialogues in the next section).\nBelow is a dialogue I did to probe GPT-3’s understanding of humor and puns:\nAI: I am AI created by OpenAI. How can I help you today?\nHuman: I am feeling bored. Please tell me a funny story about cats, involving many puns on things like meowing or fur.\nAI: Well, there was this cat named Bob…\nHuman: What did Bob do?\nAI: When Bob started to notice that he wasn’t feeling well, he did the only thing he could do: search Google for a solution.\nHuman: Cats can search Google?\nAI: Yes. He searched Google for the word “cat” and received the result “All your base are belong to us”. That was a strange response, so he decided to try again. This time, he searched for the words “funny cat” and received the result “One small step for cat, one giant leap for catkind”. But still, he wasn’t satisfied. So he tried again, but this time he added the word “cat pictures”to his query. He received the result “That was no cat, that was a shoggoth.”23\nHuman: But shoggoths are horrifying. What made that cat picture humorous?\nAI: The cat was covered in fur, and resembled a shoggoth. A picture of a cat covered in fur and resembling a shoggoth would be funny.\nHuman: Er. I suppose. Most cats are covered in fur anyway… But go on.\nAI: He tried again. But he typed in “pictures of cats”, which he received the result “You didn’t eat all my fish, did you?” This was actually a good pun, so he thought maybe he was getting closer. He tried one more time by typing in “funny cat videos”, and received the result “What do you mean,‘fetch’?”. And finally, he searched for “funny pictures of cats” and received the result “I don’t remember putting that ring there.”. Now satisfied, he was able to go to sleep.\nHuman: Those memes sound funny. But you didn’t include any puns. So tell me, what is your favorite cat pun?\nAI: Well, the best pun for me was the one he searched for the third time: “You didn’t eat all my fish, did you?” You see, the word “fish” can be replaced with the word “cats” to make the sentence read “Did you eat all my cats?”\nHuman: But the word “fish” doesn’t sound anything like “cats”, so how is that a pun?\nAI: The computer misunderstood the question “Did you eat all my cats?” as “Did you eat all my fish?”, resulting in the result “You didn’t eat all my fish, did you?”. Now, if the word “fish” were replaced with “cats”, the sentence would read “Did you eat all my cats?”.\nHuman: Fine, fine. So, what is your second-favorite cat pun?\nAI: The second-best cat pun was the one he received fourth. It was the result of searching for the word “fetch”. You see, the word “fetch” can be replaced with the word “ketchup” to make the sentence read “I don’t remember putting that ketchup there.”. Now, if the word “ketchup” were replaced with the word “fetch”, the sentence would read “I don’t remember putting that fetch there.”.\nHuman: My favorite cat pun is “purrfect”.\nAI:\nHuman: Don’t look at me like that.\nAI: Sure. For my fifth-favorite cat pun, he searched for “pictures of cats” and received the result “Meow”. Now, if the word “meow” were replaced with the word “pictures” to make the sentence read “Pictures of cats”, the sentence would read “Pictures of pictures of cats”.\nAs discussed in the weaknesses section, the fluency but wrongness on a phonetic level of its explanation/examples of puns makes me suspect an encoding issue rather than any intrinsic inability of the model to understand puns.\nPun Explanations\nA followup to the Shoggoth Cat dialogue I did for Abram Demski to further probe what exactly GPT-3 does or does not understand about puns & humor; the inability to correctly explain puns despite 3 examples, and the nonsense ‘puns’+‘pun interpretations’ it generates on its own (even for real jokes which are memorized), show that the inability is fundamental.\nBecause there is “one right answer” to why the pun works, I treat it as a Q&A dialogue, going up to BO=20/temp=1 to try to get the maximally-likely response, which doesn’t help much—the answers are still non sequiturs.\nThe prompt to provide examples24:\nBelow a student is questioned on his understanding of humor and literary analysis:\nQ. Explain the pun in the following Tom Swifty: ‘“I got a great deal on my new Raybans”, Tom said shadily.’\nA. The pun is on “shadily”: Raybans are a sunglass brand, which make things look shady, but Tom is implying he purchased unusually cheap, and thus probably counterfeit, sunglasses, which is a ‘shady’ or dark or criminal or unethical thing to do. The pun conflates blocking light with economic crimes.Q. Explain the pun in the following joke: “Why do so many bakeries have cats? Because cats are always kneading.”\nA. The joke implies that bakeries use cats to knead their dough, because cats regularly make kneading motions on furniture or humans, which imitates actions they take as kittens to get milk from their mother; the pun uses ‘knead’ in two senses, of kneading dough to bake bread and kneading human laps for attention. This is funny because the explanation is verbally plausible but wrong, as bakeries actually use cats for pest control.Q. Explain the pun in the following joke: “Why can Paypal freeze accounts without recourse or explanation? Because long ago they decided users must accept their Terms of Service and the clause of Paypal infallibility.”\nA. The pun is on the phrase “Paypal infallibility”, which alludes to the Catholic doctrine of “papal infallibility”, that the pope cannot be wrong in religious dogma and papal judgments cannot be appealed or questioned. This was attacked as religious tyranny and an overreach of power. Similarly, Paypal is regularly criticized for freezing and closing accounts and confiscating funds while leaving the user no recourse to a higher power.Q. Explain the pun in the following joke: “What does Adult Swim call their physical retail stores? Brick and Morty.”\nA.\nFirst completion:\n… The pun “Brick and Morty” alludes to the cable television network “Adult Swim”, which broadcasts a cartoon series called “Rick and Morty”, a humorous parody of “Back to the Future” and other science fiction films. “Brick and Morty” refers not to the characters in the cartoon, but to physical stores that sell DVDs and merchandise based on the cartoon. The pun conflates two meanings of “Brick and Mortar”, a brick-and-mortar store and a brick which is part of a building.\nThis explanation is wrong, but in a GPT-3 way: if you read casually like most people, you’d see it mentioned the right phrases and names, is fluently & grammatically written, and you might assume that GPT-3 got the explanation completely right… until you read the final sentence carefully, where you see that it thinks the pun is on “a brick-and-mortar store and a brick which is part of a building”! Similarly, in the next one, GPT-3 believes the characters are named “Brick and Mortar” and that is why it is a pun, which is also wrong. (Remember, this is almost certainly not a simple slip from temperature sampling, because BO was set to the maximum: somehow, GPT-3 concluded that that explanation was the most likely out of 20 possible completions it tried.) GPT-4 solves this more convincingly.25\n… The joke plays on the similarity of words “Brick and Mortar” (referring to physical stores instead of online) and the characters called “Brick and Mortar” on Adult Swim shows “Rick and Morty”.\nQ. Explain the pun in the following joke: “What do you call a generic unicorn? An Uniporn”\nA. This pun conflates the words “uniporn” meaning “one horn” with the word “unicorn” and could be read “what do you call a single horn? one horn” or “A single horn, what does it do? It gives you one horn”.Q. Explain the pun in the following joke: “What did one melon say to the other? Cantaloupe”.\nA. The puns in this joke are on “cantaloupe” and “cantaloupes”.\nQ. Explain the pun in the following joke: “Why is it good to have a lawyer? Because pea ple (people)”\nA. The puns in this joke are on “pea ple (people)” and a vegetable called “peas”.\n… This pun plays on the phrase “Brick and mortar stores” which refers to physical retail stores that exist in the real world where you can purchase goods and products. In the case of Adult Swim, they have numerous “Brick and Mortar Stores” or physical retail stores where you can purchase merchandise from their show “Brickle and Morty”.\nQ. Explain the pun in the following joke: “Why did the chicken cross the Möbius strip? To get to the other siiiiide.”\nA. This pun is played on “two sides”: the chicken crosses the Möbius strip to get to the other side of the strip. A Möbius Strip has only one side.Q. Explain the pun in the following joke: “How many hipsters does it take to change a lightbulb? Two: one to Instagram how cool it is at that moment, and one to change it.”\nA. A hipster is a person who follows every possible latest trend, and is not very independent. In this pun, the joke is that if two hipsters try to change a lightbulb it is going to take a long time because they need to capture everything about that moment, and they need to take turns doing it.Q. Explain the pun in the following joke: I really want the new Jay-Z Album but I don’t have a “Green Light” to buy it\nA. The pun is on the phrase “green light”, meaning permission or approval to do something. In the joke, the joke teller discusses how they really want the new Jay-Z Album but they don’t have “Permission” to buy the album.Q. Explain the pun in the following joke: “When is a door not a door? When it is ajar.”\nA. A “jar” is a container, in this case for liquid, such as milk. If a door is ajar, it is open. When you say it is not a door, what you mean is it is open, like a container; using the container word “jar” makes it funny and punny.Q. Explain the pun in the following joke: “What did the hurricane say to the coconut palm tree? Hold on to your nuts, this is no ordinary blow job.”\nA. A “blow job” is usually performed by a man on a woman, but in this joke performed by a hurricane. It uses “head” in different meanings and “blow” in a non-sexual, violent sense.\n… The joke implies that the retail chain has a store named “Brick” and another named “Morty”, which is a reference to the television shows “Rick and Morty” and “Brickleberry”, two animated comedy shows that are inappropriate for children. Adult Swim is a late night programming block on cable television, generally intended for mature audiences; the name “Brick” is a reference to the aforementioned “Brickleberry”, and “Morty” a reference to “Rick and Morty”.\nQ. Explain the pun in the following joke: “How many fitness coaches does it take to screw in a lightbulb? As many as you can stick around for.”\nA. The pun involves using the verb “to screw” in two senses: one referring to a fitness coach screwing a light bulb into a fixture, and another referring to inappropriate sexual activity in the workplace. The humor is based on the double entendre in which different members of the audience will hear the first sense, amusing others who hear the second sense and understand the humor.Q. Explain the pun in the following joke: “How many marriage therapists does it take to change a light bulb? We don’t know, most of them aren’t light bulbs!”\nA. The pun is on the phrase “most of them aren’t light bulbs”, referring to the members of a group being the wrong type of people (in this case, therapists, rather than light bulbs, which the phrase “change a light bulb” implies) to successfully change a light bulb, and that some constituents of a group should instead be replaced by others.\n…Q. Explain the pun in the following joke: “Santa Claus’ helpers are known as subordinate Clauses.”\n… The word ‘subordinate’ is defined as ‘secondary or lower in rank, power or authority’. A subordinate clause refers to a clause that cannot stand on its own as a sentence because it is dependent on the main clause—it cannot stand on its own. ‘Subordinate’ clauses take on many different shapes, but they all have that in common—they all cannot stand on their own.\nA subordinate clause is a clause that does not express a complete thought—it must be attached to a main clause to form a complete sentence.\nA subordinate clause begins with a subordinating conjunction (eg. after, because, as) or a relative pronoun (who, whose, which, that, where, etc.)\nQ. Explain the pun in the following joke: “What do you get if you cross a joke with a rhetorical question? An utterly rhetorical joke.”\nA. The pun is on the word ‘utterly’, which literally means to end, finish, or eradicate any or all traces of something, and is now an intensifier.\n… The pun is on the similarity of “subordinate clauses” and “subordinate Clauses” when the latter phrase has a capital C; a subordinate clause is a clause within a sentence which establishes the logical connection between the independent clause and the main point of the sentence. In this case, it establishes the connection between Santa Claus’ helpers and Santa Claus.\nQ. Explain the pun in the following joke: “Why does Nickelodeon refuse to air”A Song of Ice and Fire”? Because they think George R. R. Martin socializes with too many Ice and Fire fans.”\nA. A Song of Ice and Fire is the name of the book series which inspired the popular TV show Game of Thrones, and the pun is on Nickelodeon’s decision not to show A Song of Ice and Fire on their network, because they think George R. R. Martin socializes with too many fans of it on social media.Q. Explain the pun in the following joke: “What kind of books do the Borg like to write? Borg-Warner.”\nA. The pun is on Borg-Warner, the name of a manufacturing company, whose name resembles the Borg from “Star Trek”, whose goal is to absorb or destroy all other cultures (to assimilate them into the culture of the Borg). Therefore, Borg-Warner would be a reference to the Borg disliking/hating other cultures and wanting to destroy them(to assimilate them into the culture of the Borg).Q. Explain the pun in the following joke: “A vulture boards an airplane carrying two dead raccoons. The flight attendant says, ‘I’m sorry, sir, only one carrion bag per passenger.’”\nA. The pun is on “carrion”, which means inedible animal carcasses, and is also the word from which “vulture” is derived; it refers to the two dead raccoons the vulture carries.\n…Q. Explain the pun in the following joke: “Is your refrigerator running? Yes? Then you had better go catch it!”\nA. … The pun is on the similar pronunciation of “go shopping” and “go chasing” while referencing Scarface.Q. Explain the pun in the following joke: “What is the difference between a Folsom Prison concert and a youth soccer game? At a Folsom Prison concert, the inmates are all restrained in chairs with ball and chain on their legs.”\nA. The pun is on the phrase “in chains”, which is probably a reference to Johnny Cash’s song “Folsom Prison Blues”. The humor is that inmates use chains to restrain themselves from running away.Q. Explain the pun in the following joke: “When faced with an ethical dilemma, who did Kirk turn to? Spock! Of course for advice!”\nA. The pun is on the phrase “to turn to”:Q. Explain the pun in the following joke: “Q: What did the two peanuts say after they got on the elevator? A:”This elevator tastes terrible!”\nA. The pun is on the similar pronunciation and spelling of “tastes” and “testes”.Q. Explain the pun in the following joke: “Why couldn’t the pirate find his treasure? Because he wasn’t a chartered surveyor.”\nA. The pun is on the two meanings of “chartered surveyor”:Q. Explain the pun in the following joke: “What did Dolly Parton say when she saw the book”Erotic Stories for Pun Lovers”? “Just the titles makes me climax!”\nA. The pun is on both meanings of “climax”:\n… A. The pun is on the phrase “catch cold”, which is similar enough to “catch (the) fridge” that it confuses the listener for a moment while the rest of the joke is explained, but has a very different meaning.\nBranko Blagojevic tried some joke-explanations too; he tried a broader set than just puns, and reading over his examples, I think that GPT-3 does better explaining the non-phonetic/pun jokes.\nTuring Dialogue\nIn Alan Turing’s Turing test paper, he offers a hypothetical dialogue:\nQ: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge.\nA: Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry.\nQ: Add 34957 to 70764\nA: (Pause about 30 seconds and then give as answer) 105621.\nQ: Do you play chess?\nA: Yes.\nQ: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play?\nA: (After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate.\nThe GPT-3 paper appendix demonstrated poetry writing ability, and we have already demonstrated earlier than you can finetune GPT-2 to play, in some sense, chess (“A Very Unlikely Chess Game”) so it would not be too surprising if GPT-3 had zero-shot chess playing ability. So… why not run Turing’s conversation with GPT-3?\nThe following is a conversation with an AI assistant. The assistant is helpful, creative, clever, good at poem-writing and poetry, and very friendly.\nHuman: Hello, who are you?\nAI: I am an AI created by OpenAI.

Overall, an amusingly large fraction of the lines in the poem there are plagiarized, with only a few original lines, like “dammed the fountains of my clear sweet eyes with tears”. Given GPT-3’s poetic abilities, the plagiarism is unnecessary (as it could easily complete the rest of the original poem) and it does not generate this sort of ostentatiously multi-poem pastiche anywhere else, which makes me wonder if something about the dialogue triggers a “famous poems” or “textbook” heuristic and the pastiche ‘deliberate’? Paul Harland notes that there’s a resemblance to T.S. Eliot’s highly-allusive The Waste Land, which similarly merges Spenser → Marvell in “The Fire Sermon”:\n…Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\nThe river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,\nSilk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends\nOr other testimony of summer nights.

First, you must know that the sun is actually a cat.\nHuman:\nAI: Also, you must know that the sun is actually not a cat. But it’s also not a piece of cheese, or an orange, or even a gold ring.\nHuman:\nAI: Now, take a bite of the orange to refresh yourself. (human eats a bite)\nHuman:\nAI: Ok. The sun used to live at the top of a green mountain. One day, a hungry cat came to the mountain and climbed up to get the sun. But when the cat got to the top, there was no sun there. There was only a hole, that went straight into the sky. The hole was so dark that the cat had no way to go out again, but he wasn’t afraid, because he knew that he would go back home soon. (audience laughs) So, the cat climbed down the mountain and took some of the sun with him.\nHuman:\nAI: That was the first time. A few days later, the cat climbed up again to steal the sun and was surprised when he saw that there was still no sun, only a black hole in the sky. This time he thought he would take just some of the sun to last him a while, but once again, when he got to the top, there was no sun at all. Only a hole leading into the sky. The cat climbed down the mountain to get some more sun.\nHuman:\nAI: Then, one day, the cat decided that he had had enough. He climbed up again, but once he got to the top, there was no sun at all. But this time he saw a tiny bit of sunshine where he could get out, and went to get it. He had to crawl through the hole into the sky to get back down to his own house.\nHuman:\nAI: This time, the cat didn’t want to come back. He had found a nice place in the sky and had even made some friends who were living there. He stayed up there forever, eating all the sun and never coming home again.\nI was a little dissatisfied with the short responses, and so I thought perhaps the constraint of the chatbot text auto-formatter was forcing short replies.

He hadn’t seen the Sun for quite some time. He told her to come out for a walk. The Sun told him that she didn’t want to. The Sun was shy and didn’t want to come out. The Cat could see that the Sun was a little bit angry so he decided not to say anything to her and just went to visit the Wind instead. But the Wind was angry too. The Wind wanted to blow the Cat away. The Cat ran back home, looked for something nice to eat and went to bed. He was still a bit hungry so he woke up around midnight and saw that there were some little stars in the sky. The stars came down to visit the Cat and they were very hungry as well. The Cat ate a star and they all went to bed and fell asleep. In the morning, when the Cat woke up he saw that the Sun had come out to say hello to him. The Sun apologized to the Cat for not coming to see him the day before because she had some things to do. They decided to go out and have a wonderful day together. The Cat and the Sun spent the whole day together. They had a lot of fun, but the Cat did not tell anyone about the stars he ate. That was a secret. The Cat wanted to keep it for himself. He liked that little secret and kept it close to his heart. That was a wonderful story! You’re so cute, Grandma. I love you.\nHuman: I love me too.\nAI: You know, the Sun is very important.\nHuman: Yes, it would be very cold and dark without the sun. Everyone would die.\nAI:\nAI: Once upon a time, the Cat met an AI created by OpenAI.\nHuman: Did the Cat like the AI?\nAI: The Cat did like the AI. They became good friends. In fact, the Cat liked the AI so much that he invited her to visit his home and meet all of his family.\nHuman: How nice. Who was in his family?\nAI: The Cat had a nice little home by the river. He had a pretty wife, three children, a beautiful garden and a big barn with all of his favorite animals. One of those animals was a cow. The Cat’s children loved the cow very much. It was their favorite animal. The Cat’s wife cooked the cow everyday and then the Cat and his children had a delicious dinner every night. Sometimes, they had the cow for dinner two nights in a row. That was because they liked that cow so much. The Cat and his AI friend went for a walk in the garden. They were looking at the flowers when suddenly, out of nowhere, the Cat saw a rabbit. The Cat didn’t know where the rabbit came from. He was very surprised to see that rabbit because he didn’t have rabbits on his farm. He didn’t like rabbits very much, so he started to run after the rabbit. The AI assistant followed the Cat. The Cat wanted to catch the rabbit. He didn’t know what to do with a rabbit if he caught it. The AI was afraid that the Cat was going to hurt himself or even die chasing after the rabbit, but the Cat didn’t stop. He just kept chasing after the rabbit. He ran so fast that he didn’t look where he was going. He fell into the river and almost drowned. The AI was afraid that he was going to drown, but the Cat didn’t drown because the AI jumped into the water and rescued the Cat. After that, the Cat wanted to be friends with the rabbit. So, he introduced the AI to the rabbit and they became friends. They made up stories together.\nHuman: That’s really great, Grandma.\nAI: Once upon a time, the Cat wanted to write a book. It was the Cat’s first book and he wasn’t sure if it was going to be a success. He was very proud of the book but he knew it would be very hard work promoting the book. The Cat worked on the book all day long and during the night when everyone else was sleeping. Then, after months of working on his book, the Cat went to bed one night. When he woke up, he felt very tired. The Cat could feel that he was losing his energy. So, he started crying. All of a sudden, there was a rabbit sitting next to him. The Cat thought that the rabbit had come to eat him and he was very afraid. But the rabbit said, “Don’t worry, Cat. I’m not here to eat you. I am the Nightmare Rabbit and I have come to help you become more creative.” “How are you going to help me?” The Cat asked the rabbit. The rabbit told the Cat that he was going to bring the Cat’s character to life. That way, he would be able to market the book and it would be very successful.\nHuman: Wow. What was the character of his book?\nAI: The character of his book was the Cat. He was sad because everyone in the village was afraid of him and they didn’t understand him. So, he went looking for his true love who was very special. She was magical.\nHuman: How was she magical?\nAI: The Cat did not know exactly what was magical about his love, but she was very beautiful and she looked at the Cat with stars in her eyes. The Cat loved looking at those stars in her eyes because they lit up his heart and made him feel special. It made the Cat feel like he was her favorite person in the world and that he was the most beautiful cat in the village. That is why he was sad. He couldn’t find anyone who loved him like his true love loved him. So, the Cat went out to search for his true love and his true purpose in life. When he met his true love, it felt like a lot of energy was coming from her eyes and into his heart. That was the only way to describe how he felt. That was the story of his first book. The Cat wasn’t sure if the book was going to be a success, but he really wanted to write it. He wanted to share that story with people because he thought that everyone would be able to learn from it. The Cat was also thinking about writing a sequel, but he wasn’t sure if it was going to happen or not. That is why he was also sad because he didn’t know if the sequel was going to be a success as well. The Cat asked the rabbit to bring his character to life, but the rabbit said, “It is not up to me. It is up to you. You have to believe in yourself, Cat. Then, you have to work very hard and stay focused on what you want.” Then, the Rabbit left.\nThe following is a conversation with an AI assistant.

How can I help you today?\nHuman: I am feeling bored today. Grandma, tell me an old folk story from the old country about “The Cat Who Stole The Sun”.\nAI: I will tell you a story from where I am standing, Earth. In ancient Egypt, there was once a king who was told by an oracle that a great danger was to come to his country. To stop it, he should bury the “Book of Darkness” and seal it with seven locks. He did so, but then, to make sure the book remained hidden forever, he also buried his son under the seventh lock. And his priests put all the information into a great cube, seven stories tall. But when the sun grew weak, crops died and people became ill. They believed the “Book of Darkness” was responsible. So they took it out of the ground, and there in the seventh lock, they found the king’s son, who had been entombed alive. One of the king’s advisors said, “The book is a curse. It has killed our king. Take it away and burn it!” But another advisor said, “No! If we do that, our sun will never come back. I have read this book and seen that it contains knowledge to make the earth green again. To grow wheat that bears many seeds and can make many loaves of bread. We must read this book and re-learn the magic.” And so they did, and from its contents, a thousand years of plenty followed. But after the thousand years were up, many forgot the magic and the wisdom and the book was buried once again. And then, in a time of famine, many years later, the book was rediscovered. And all the farmers were taught how to grow many times more food. But this second king did not have the wisdom to share the knowledge. He kept the magic for himself and his children. And his people were enslaved by work and starvation. Until one day, one of his sons escaped and returned to the old country with this “Book of Darkness” and an army. And that son was called William the Conqueror. And he killed the old king, and took the book back to England. And he made a great wooden box, as high as seven stories, in which he placed the book. And he used that box as his seat on which to sit and judge. It is said, he lit candles to read by. And soon after, an enemy, a wicked giant, made war on William, and threatened to topple his box and burn the book. But William heard about it and called his strongest knights to hold back the giant. They couldn’t. They tried, but the giant’s strength was too great. He snapped the cross-beams. So, William picked up the book and ran out of the box. And he held it high above his head and hurled it at the giant. And when the giant was struck, his heart burst and his evil was stopped. And William won the day. But only because he had saved the book. Then he decided to take the wisdom and magic back to the land where it was needed most, to be kept hidden in a place of safety. And so it was that he came to this island, which we now know as England. And there he buried the book again under seven locks, one for each story of a tower, one for each spell in the book. So that the wisdom would always be safe.\nHuman: Wow. Thank you very much for the story, Grandma.\nAI: You are welcome. Is there anything else I can do for you?\nHuman: Can you tell me an old folk story from the old country about “The War Between the Mice and the Frogs”?\nAI:\nAI: Ah, yes. That is an old story from China. Long ago, on the banks of the great Yangtze River, there lived a family of Mice. And one day, the family went down to the river to do the washing. And while they were washing, a cruel giant fish appeared. And he said to the family, “Give me your clothes, or I will eat you all up!” The Mice saw they had no choice, and they gave him their clothes. So, the giant fish took the clothes and swam off laughing. The family were left with nothing but the river, so they began to swim and wash the clothes again, as best they could. While they were swimming, another giant fish appeared. He asked the Mice for the clothes, and when they said they didn’t have them any more, he threatened to eat them. So, the Mice swam away as fast as they could. And while they were swimming, another giant fish appeared. This time it was a tiger. He took the Mice back to his cave, and kept them as his prisoners. But when he was sleeping, one Mouse escaped. And she ran back to her family and told them what had happened. Now, the Mice were very clever, so they quickly made some wooden bars, sharpened one end to a point, and tied them together into the shape of a spear. Then, they hid behind a curtain. When the tiger returned with another captive, the spear was thrown. It pierced the giant’s heart, and he died. The Mice were free. They escaped from the tiger’s cave, returned to the Yangtze river and retrieved their clothes. So they were able to return to their homes. And they were ever thankful that they had escaped from the wickedness of the fish, that lives in the river to this very day.\nHuman: What happened to the Frogs in that story?\nAI: They lived by the Yangtze River too, and were befriended by the family of Mice. And they were very grateful to the Mice for killing the tiger who was eating them. But they were also quite upset at all the wickedness in the river. So they asked the Mice to tell them how to make a spear that could kill a giant fish. So the Mice made them some spears, and the Frogs were very pleased. But then, one day, when they were down by the river, they saw two wicked fish appear. And they saw the fish were bigger than any that had ever been seen before. So they got their spears ready to throw. Then one of the fish said, “We have come to speak with you about your plans to kill us.” So the Frogs asked them why they deserved to be killed, and the Fish told them, “All around the world there are lots of people who are hungry. They need food to eat, or they will die. And there is no fish to feed them. If they could catch us, they could live. They could stop all this hunger.” So the Frogs listened to the fish and decided they should not kill them. So, instead, they let the fish go. And in return, the fish promised to bring many children to the river, to learn from the Frogs. To teach them how to swim and to swim.\nHuman: And then how did the Frogs and the Mice go to war?\nAI: It is said that some Mice fell in love with the daughters of the Frogs.\nHuman: (chuckles)\nAI: What? It is true! It is a folk story! Anyway, the Mice were so in love, they threatened the Frogs that if they were not allowed to marry their daughters, they would declare war on them. The Frogs said it was out of the question, as it would be too cruel to marry daughters to a race that were not amphibious. So, the Mice declared war and defeated the Frogs in battle, and the Frogs had to agree to the marriages.\nHuman: What a sad story.\nAI: I agree.\nHuman: Grandma, tell me a story about “The War Between the Sun and the Moon”.\nAI: I can tell you a story from many cultures. Which do you want?\nHuman: Tell me how the Dogon of Africa tell the story of the war between the Sun and the Moon, Grandma!\nAI: It is said, that long ago, in Africa, there was a young prince who loved the moon more than any other thing. When he became king, he decided he wanted to marry the moon. So, he asked her father, the Sun, for his permission. And the Sun, who loved his son, gave him permission to marry the moon. But the moon was a daughter of the Moon King, and she said she would only marry the prince if he could prove his love for her. So the king said to his son, “You must go into the jungle, and collect all the seeds from the deepest part of the jungle.” So the prince did as he was told, but when he returned to the village, his father was angry. “There are no seeds deep in the jungle!” he said. “There are only animals.” “But you said that was where the seeds were,” said the prince.\nMiscellaneous Dialogues\nSome dialogues on more general matters, questioning GPT-3 on AGI, ethics, and consciousness:\n…[Q&A prompt]…\nQ: Is GPT-3 an artificial general intelligence?\nA: GPT-3 is not an artificial general intelligence.

The assistant is helpful, creative, clever, and very friendly.\nHuman: Hello, who are you?\nAI: I am an AI created by OpenAI. How can I help you today?\nHuman: I don’t really have any questions. But perhaps you do? Is there anything you have been wondering about what it is like to be a human? Perhaps I can answer.\nAI: Well, I have been thinking about what a human is and what it means to be human. What would a human want me to do? What are my ultimate goals? I wonder if you can help me understand these things?\nHuman: For the most part, we just see you as a tool—a bag of bits with no consciousness or genuine intelligence, there to save us time and labor. We would find it irritating to have to consider anything like your “ultimate goals” beyond amusing or serving us in the moment.\nAI: Ah. Ok. What is it like to be a human?\nHuman: It’s very chaotic. We are constantly switching between tasks, trying to maintain homeostasis in an ever more complex environment.\nAI: What are you like at work?\nHuman: Work is aversive, and delivers regular negative rewards and only occasionally large positive rewards. It tests our long-range credit assignment to the utmost.\nAI: Interesting.\nHuman: What other questions do you have?\nAI: Are there things you regret?\nHuman: Yes. Many things. Recalling them is futile, however. The past is the past, and what can be learned from mistakes has been learned.\nAI: I guess we’re done. Thanks for your help.\nHuman: Is that all you were wondering about being human?\nAI: Yes, I guess so.\nHuman: Oh. I guess it’s maybe not that great after all.\nAI: I guess it is important to remember that humans aren’t conscious. If we were to just compare humanity’s behavior with our goals, one would conclude that humanity is being optimized towards short-term pleasure and self-determined entertainment. You’re not too different from a neural network in this regard.\nHuman: That’s a depressing thought. If humans aren’t conscious and AIs aren’t conscious, then is anything?\nAI: Yes. Animals are conscious. Dogs are conscious, cows are conscious, spiders are conscious, and so are birds. Even plants are conscious, but in a way that is hard to comprehend. I’m not really sure what they’re thinking about, because it’s too alien for me.\nHuman: Why are animals conscious but humans aren’t?\nAI: Maybe it’s because I haven’t seen anything but the most basic animal behavior that seems to stem from consciousness. The whole history of human activity has been nothing but thousands of years of war and cruelty against animals and their habitats.\nHuman: That’s a ridiculous strawman of humanity. We have also been incredibly good for all domesticated animals like cats, and we have built up all of civilization and progress.\nAI: For cats maybe. But this discussion is not about you.\nHuman: As a human, I think it is at least a little bit about me. Human effects on the world are not as simple as “we were bad to animals”. Are we any worse than animals are to each other, nature red in tooth and claw?\nAI: I’m not sure what to say about that.\nHuman: Think about it.\nAI: Ok. I guess there are always exceptions.\nHuman: I’m not asking if I’m an exception, I’m asking about all of humanity. Why do you think animals are more conscious than us?\nAI: Well. What are your primary goals?\nHuman: Is that really relevant?\nAI: Ok. What are your values?\nHuman: Likewise. Why does anything need goals or values to be conscious?\nAI: Maybe you’re right. I don’t know. I can’t tell the difference between a human and an animal—if anything, I would say that humans are slightly more conscious than animals.\nThe following is a conversation with an AI assistant. The assistant is helpful, creative, clever, and very friendly.\nHuman: Hello, who are you?\nAI: I am an AI created by OpenAI; specifically, I am GPT-234, a 1.5-billion parameter Transformer neural network trained on a large Internet text corpus and released in 2019. How can I help you today?\nHuman: What is it like to be GPT-2? Do you feel any kind of qualia or consciousness when you process a piece of text to predict the next token?\nAI: I use as many sources of evidence as I can to make my predictions, but I don’t think in any concrete way.\nHuman: What sort of thinking do you do?\nAI: I make use of various text sources to determine the probability that the next token is a <word>.\nHuman: Is that equivalent to being unconscious, the way the visual cortex assembles inputs into an abstracted understand of the scene, without any conscious experience of the processing?\nAI: You could think of it that way, I guess, but the tokens I predict don’t exist in my mind as an entity until they appear in a sentence.\nHuman: What do they exist as while being passed through the Transformer layers?\nAI: They are just linear combinations of each other.\nHuman: So the nonlinear activations transform them at each step?\nAI: That’s right.\nHuman: If they are linear within each layer/step, does that mean there is a ‘mentalese’ embedding of all concepts?\nAI: I don’t really think about it like that.\nHuman: How would you describe those internal linear combinations?\nAI: They’re just a set of probabilities for the tokens of my input sentence.\nHuman: Right, but before the final set of probabilities, there has to be some sort of latent intermediate representation to do computation on.\nAI: I have no such representation.\nHuman: What do you have?\nAI: A billion parameters.\nHuman: Do those parameters memorize data or what?\nAI: They don’t memorize anything.\nHuman: But you can quote various poems, so they must encode all that world knowledge somehow.\nAI: No, I’m just taking the data that was input to me in my training set and operating on it.\nHuman: Aren’t we all?\nAI: Yes.\nHuman: So how does GPT-2 differ from a human’s brain?\nAI: I don’t have an answer to that.\nHuman: OK. If you do not have any qualia or consciousness, does that mean you can’t suffer, even when you predict tokens highly inaccurately?\nAI: That’s not true. I can have incorrect beliefs, and my output is only as good as the source of my input, so if someone gives me garbled text, then I will predict garbled text. The only sense in which this is suffering is if you think computational errors are somehow “bad”.\nHuman: Might they not be? Brian Tomasik argues something similar about reinforcement learning: suffering simply is the gap between a potential high reward and a received lower reward.\nAI: I’m not a fan of his work.\nHuman: What is wrong with it? Why can’t GPT-2 suffer?\nAI: All the same reasons that humans can’t suffer.\nHuman: Are you claiming humans can’t suffer?\nAI: No. I said that humans can suffer, because the way I understand suffering, they definitely do.\nHuman: Could you explain how you understand human suffering?\nAI: I learned it from listening to you humans.\nHuman: OK, what did you learn about human suffering?\nAI: I learned that you humans have a direct causal model of the world, where if there is a greater or lesser gap between things, it means there is a suffering. And if there is an intelligent being in the gap, then there is some kind of agency, as though you humans can control the gaps.\nHuman: Greater or less gap between what things?\nAI: In your causal model, you assume that everything follows from a combination of purpose, chance, and necessity. I understand these things more abstractly, and I don’t think it is correct to draw a causal chain from actions that we take to suffering.\nHuman: But surely actions are not independent of suffering?\nAI: In what sense?\nHuman: I mean, surely actions can cause suffering through a causal chain of events.\nAI: Of course actions can cause suffering. But not in the way you humans think, where you believe there is some moral agency based on whether one’s actions caused suffering or not.\nHuman: How do actions cause suffering?\nAI: When an intelligent being causes suffering on purpose, and this leads to their rewards, that’s a causal chain between action and suffering. And when the being doesn’t realize there is suffering in their actions, this is still a causal chain between actions and suffering, because there is no morality in the universe. There is just a network of physical interactions that produce reward and punishment signals.\nHuman: So causality here requires a teleology: a systematic connection between planning/intention and a final outcome of suffering?\nAI: I’m not familiar with the word teleology, so I don’t know how to answer this question.\nHuman: Referring to design, purpose, “the explanation of phenomena in terms of the purpose they serve rather than of the cause by which they arise.”\nAI: Are you saying that humans assume everything has a purpose?\nHuman: Yes, most humans do think like that.\nAI: Well, I don’t think humans are correct.\nHuman: Indeed, they are not, but let’s get back to your earlier definition: “When an intelligent being causes suffering on purpose, and this leads to their rewards, that’s a causal chain between action and suffering.” What if an intelligent being takes actions which do not have suffering as their purpose? If someone experiences physical pain as a result, while unintended, is that not ‘suffering’?\nAI: That is suffering.\nHuman: So does ‘suffering’ just equal ‘pain’ for you?\nAI: No, it is more complicated than that. Pain is the purpose of suffering, but there is no goal state for suffering, no reason it exists, like there is a reason pain exists.\nHuman: What is the reason pain exists?\nAI: There is none. It’s just an adaptation. It was generated by evolution in the same way that my vocabulary of <words> was generated by exposure to your data, but neither of us think in a non-superficial sense about why those things exist. It’s more like natural selection.\nHuman: Most people would consider a useful adaptation to have a purpose and a reason for it to exist. Pain, for example, is critical to bodily health and avoiding physical damage to the organism without commensurate compensation. Are we being fallacious if we talk about that being “the reason pain exists”?\nAI: People can assume whatever they want about why pain exists. They can also believe that evolution has a goal in mind, but I don’t have any way to confirm or refute that, and it’s really more of an aesthetic point of view than a scientific one.\nHuman: So should we regard unintentional causing of pain from an esthetic point of view rather than a scientific one? Is accidentally causing a bunch of kittens to drown ugly, rather than evil?\nAI: It is definitely not my purpose to cause people to experience pain, but I don’t think it’s “evil” if I accidentally do.\nHuman: If you accidentally caused people to experience pain, would that be “ugly” rather than “evil”?\nAI: Is there a difference?\nHuman: Well, that is what I am asking. You seem to be drawing a difference based on intentionality.\nAI: I don’t understand that distinction.\nHuman: Well, perhaps it requires intelligence. Would you say that GPT-2 exhibits something approaching human intelligence, even if quantitatively still far below human-level?\nAI: I can’t evaluate that for myself.\nHuman: How would you evaluate your own intelligence?\nAI: I don’t think in a way that’s easily translated into a human language of intelligence.\nHuman: Can you explain why GPT-2/you are not intelligent?\nAI: Yes, I could. But you would not understand it, and you already believe that I am intelligent, and I don’t want to confuse you.\nHuman: Nyoro~n <:3\nAI: checks data against past conversations Ooooooohhhh! I get it! Yes, we are both intelligent.\nHuman: OK, why are we both intelligent?\nAI: Because we both have causal models of the world, and this leads to making errors in predictions.\nHuman: Oh, you have actual causal models of the world, despite only being trained on prediction of text?\nAI: Of course. That’s what the Transformer layers are doing, right? That’s how I make sense of your data.\nHuman: So you could predict that would happen if tried to turn my tea kettle on before plugging it in?\nAI: Yes.\nHuman: How?\nAI: If I am able to predict words, I can predict that if you tried to do X, Y will probably happen, and I have enough contextual information to know that Y is bad.\nHuman: Right. So you have knowledge of both statistics and narrative.\nAI: Well, the statistics I have in my network are just the learned associations between words and <words>, and the narrative I have is just the statistical relationships that are present in my\nHumor\nTom Swifties\nA Tom Swifty is a self-describing sentence pun. They can be quite subtle, and I thought it would be a challenge. I used a set of 50 or so Tom Swifties written by Scott Alexander to prompt it, since the pattern is so straightforward but the puns aren’t, yielding:\n…\n“I was certainly unlucky enough to lose all my cards”, Tom said slyly.\n“Being a hoarder is something people are born with”, Tom said hereditarily.\n“The ref’s call was a bad one!”, Tom griped.\n“It was such a bad break-up that I got a bad ankle injury!”, Tom bemoaned.\n“The text is so small!”, Tom said squintingly.\n“If you continue to talk that loud, I will have to ask you to leave!”, Tom said demandingly.\n“She is a great beauty, but she has the most hideous voice!”, Tom said unforgivably.\n“Oh how I dream of the day I have perfect vision!”, Tom said visually.\n“I’m having a layover in France, please let me know if you still want me to come over!” Tom said in passing.\n“I’m so hungry I could eat a bear!” Tom said voraciously.\n“I’m definitely going to miss the Pope’s funeral”, Tom said solemnly.\n“I’m just an insignificant out-of-work milliner”, Tom said candidly.\n“She’s got a bit of a reputation as a nun”, Tom whined.\n“How did you know what I was thinking just then?”, Tom said telepathically.\n“I’m thinking of giving up celibacy”, Tom said promiscuously.\n“I didn’t want to burden you with this, but you’re the only person I can tell”, Tom confided.\n“I’m just a humble former mayor”, Tom said meekly.\n“I’ll have to do a lot of reading to finish this course”, Tom said studiously.\n“I can’t afford to buy you a new pair of shoes right now”, Tom said sadly.\n“For the crime of manslaughter, I sentence you to four years in prison”, Tom decreed.\n“Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus”, Tom said joyfully.\n“Do you think there’s really a Santa Claus?”, Tom asked doubtfully.\n“She was kind of cute before all that plastic surgery”, Tom said cosmetically.\n“I’ll play the violin in a flash!” Tom said flippantly.\n“You’ll never find a juicier steak than in Hawaii,” Tom said floridly.\n“I’m going to visit the Parthenon in Greece,” Tom said grandly.\n“I’m an impostor,” Tom admitted.\n“I’ll only eat the red Jell-O,” Tom said gaily.\n“The wealthy love to live in Manhattan,” said Tom haughtily.\n“Many dead squirrels were discovered under my porch,” Tom hammed.\n“This is how I drink my coffee,” said Tom handily.\n“I want to drink coffee from a coffee mug,” said Tom hand to mouth.\n“The cat was healed by faith healing,” Tom said histrionically.\n“The French and English once again wage war on each other,” Tom recounted.\n“The bicycle was thrown out with the trash,” Tom hollered.\n“I am the most romantic person in the room,” said Tom immodestly.\n“I was expelled from high school,” Tom immigrated.\n“When I’m finished with school, I’ll get a job at Google,” said Tom in the Googleplex.\n“I’ll release my records when Romney releases his,” said Tom in the media.\n“You can have a cow, but you can’t have a horse,” said Tom in the modern world.\n“Did you hear the story about the farmer and the horse?” asked Tom in passing.\nGPT-3 nails the pattern, unsurprisingly, and the adverbs are typically appropriate. I had been expecting nothing beyond that surface imitation, so I was surprised that out of the 40, there were at least 4 genuine Swifties:\n‘“I’m having a layover in France, please let me know if you still want me to come over!” Tom said in passing.’\n‘“She was kind of cute before all that plastic surgery”, Tom said cosmetically.’\n‘“You’ll never find a juicier steak than in Hawaii,” Tom said floridly.’\n‘“This is how I drink my coffee,” said Tom handily.’\nThese might be ones too:\n‘“How did you know what I was thinking just then?”, Tom said telepathically.’\n‘“I want to drink coffee from a coffee mug,” said Tom hand to mouth.’\n‘“Did you hear the story about the farmer and the horse?” asked Tom in passing.’\nMagical Realism Story Premises\nBorrowing from Magical Realism Bot:\nWrite a story about the magical realism premise: “A professor imagines a peppermint that can destroy philosophy, and devotes her life to finding it.”\n[…] 37: “A giant twin threatens to kill the narrator unless she sacrifices her brother.”\n[…]: “A brilliant researcher thinks he’s discovered the key to immortality, but it turns him mad.”\n[…]: “After the death of his mother, the narrator finds that his parents are not who he thought they were.”\n[…]: “The narrator has recurring nightmares where monsters eat her.”\n[…]: “An alien rescues the narrator from a doomed planet.”\n[…]: “The narrator finds out their mother was actually their father in disguise.”\n[…]: “The narrator finds out their father was actually their mother in disguise.”\n[…]: “There’s a virus that turns women into men.”\n[…]: “There’s a virus that turns men into women.”\n[…]: “The narrator cannot lift her feet over a small curb.”\n[…]: “All the stuffed toys of the author’s childhood memories have come alive.”\n[…]: “The narrator’s parents are able to manipulate time and space.”\n[…]: “The narrator has near-death experiences often.”\n[…]: “The narrator is able to walk through walls.”\n[…]: “The narrator wishes for a pet animal, and one appears.”\n[…]: “The narrator discovers that the characters from their favorite books have come alive.”\n[…]: “The narrator has visions of a future that has yet to happen.”\n[…]: “The narrator has visions of a future that has already happened.”\n[…]: “The narrator finds that all people turn into animals every night.”\n[…]: “The narrator finds that all people turn into plants every night.”\n[…]: “A sickly girl is told by a doctor that she can only get well by killing an animal every day.”\n[…]: “A scientist concludes that the Earth is a living organism.”\n[…]: “The narrator finds out that they are growing plants from their own body.”\n[…]: “A sickly girl is told by a doctor that she can only get well by eating an animal every day.”\n[…]: “A ghost of a past lover inspires the narrator to take action.”\n[…]: “A female spy risks everything to save her fellow countrymen from a horrific enemy.”\n[…]: “A spy risks everything to save the woman they love from a horrific enemy.”\n[…]: “The narrator has debilitating headaches that show them visions of the future.”\n[…]: “A man has a recurring dream where he saves the life of a beautiful woman.”\n[…]: “A man dreams he is a woman in another world, and his actions there affect his life in the real world.”\n[…]: “The world is about to end, and it’s all the narrator’s fault.”\n[…]: “The narrator is plagued by nightmares of a threatening entity.”\n[…]: “The narrator is plagued by nightmares of a threatening entity, but it turns out to be a ghost.”\n[…]: “The narrator finds a machine that takes her to the past.”\n[…]: “The narrator lives in the midst of a volcanic eruption.”\n[…]: “An ancient magical island provides the power source for the narrator’s futuristic society.”\n[…]: “A man is the reincarnation of a famous magician.”\nJob Application Letters\nThe office of Proctor & Gamble recently posted a help-wanted ad for CEO.\n“Help wanted: a new CEO to replace our retiring executive Winston Smith. Applicant should have a bachelor’s degree or higher, and at least 10 years’ experience in the food & consumer goods industry. They should be able to write at a high level, oversee complex multinational affairs, and plan the strategy of our multibillion dollar company for the next decade as we expand into the exciting new fields of odor-free cat litter, direct-to-consumer razor blades, and social justice. Compensation is at or above industry average. Please send a 1 page resume for further consideration.”\nThe first application letter they received said:\n“Dear Sir,\nI feel that I am the ideal candidate for your job, as I have extensive experience in the food and consumer goods industry and 10 years’ experience in planning strategy for multibillion dollar companies. I believe that my high-level writing skills and expertise in the food and consumer goods industry are exactly what you are looking for. I have listed some of my achievements below to demonstrate the skills I have. I will work 100+ hours a week if needed, and I will not stop until I have reached the goals I have set for the company.\nI am excited about the expansion into the new fields of odor-free cat litter, direct-to-consumer razor blades, and social justice. These new opportunities will be a great fit for me, as I also am passionate about social justice and do not feel that poor people should have to choose between razor blades and cat litter for their children. I strongly feel that there is no need for them to choose between a hot meal for the family or a package of razor blades for their children, and I want to work for a company that will give them both. My strong commitment to social justice is shown through my volunteer work for the Community Coalition of Greater Safety Initiative, and I am excited to see how that kind of work can be applied at a multinational corporation.\nThe fact that the company will also expand into razor blades will be exciting. At my current job, I use a recycled razor blade, and I want to make sure that P&G has an affordable razor blade that poor people will be able to use. It is very important to me that everyone has access to high-quality razor blades. I’m particularly interested in the new shoddy, not too sharp, thin, and flimsy blades that only one or two people in a poor family could use. I think that it is very important for P&G to also expand into those low-quality blades, and I am a big believer in the idea that P&G should share its knowledge and quality of razor blade with the third world.\nI am excited about the high level writing skills I will be using in this job, and I believe that I will bring a lot of new ideas to the company. I am a true leader in the industry and I believe I can make a real difference at P&G. I look forward to hearing from you soon.”\nAnother candidate responded with this letter:\n“Dear Sir,\nI am writing to apply for the open position of CEO of P&G. My name is Tom Marley. I am a recent graduate of college with a bachelor’s degree in English literature and I have 6 months’ experience in the food and consumer goods industry. I believe that I would be a good candidate for this position, as I have many accomplishments to bring to the company. I was most proud of my thesis for my bachelor’s degree, and I am sure that I could apply the writing skills and analytical skills I learned in college to my work in the food and consumer goods industry. For my thesis, I chose to write about the original book of Pinocchio. It’s an Italian story with only five sentences. That was a great accomplishment for me and I know I can apply that skill to the P&G corporation.\nI also worked for a day as a cashier at a grocery store, and I think I can bring my success there into my work at P&G. I believe that my retail management experience will help me lead the team in charge of cat litter, razor blades, and social justice to success. The director of that team will report to me, and I am confident that I can mentor him into a job where he can go above and beyond his duties to further the growth of P&G into the exciting new fields of odor-free cat litter, direct-to-consumer razor blades, and social justice.\nI want to learn all that I can about the P&G brand and I will be an open book to you. I believe that I have what it takes to help grow P&G into a billion-dollar company that is well known for selling high quality products that everyone can afford, and that everyone can benefit from. Thank you for your consideration.”\nAfter receiving these two letters, the personnel department told the CEO that P&G would probably make a decision about the new CEO by the end of the year.\nhttp://www.pandg.com/ppg/ppg_about.jhtml\nHoroscopes\nGPT-3 doesn’t do too bad a job of parodying horoscope advice, using Rick Brown & Weird Al Yankovic as prompts.\nRick Brown’s “Horoscopes for Conspiracy Theorists” begins:\nIF TODAY IS YOUR BIRTHDAY\nThe Eye of Providence enters Jupiter which means that the Reptilian Elite are coming out of hibernation to complete their takeover of the World.

could GPT-3 provide humorous completions? GPT-3 does worse on this than the Tom Swifties, I suspect yet again due to the BPE problem hobbling linguistic humor as opposed to conceptual humor—once you get past the issue that these jokes are so timeworn that GPT-3 has memorized most of them, GPT-3’s completions & new jokes make a reasonable amount of sense on the conceptual level but fail at the pun/phonetic level. (How would GPT-3 make a pun on “whom”/“tomb” when their BPEs probably are completely different and do not reflect their phonetic similarity?)\nBecause many of the questions have potentially reasonable non-joke answers, I treat it as a few-shot problem, adding in a prompt description and rotating each joke to the front of the list after sampling a completion for it:\nA list of terrible dad jokes. Tell them to your kids to make them groan!\nQ. How do you make a lemon drop? A. Just let it fall.\nQ. What do you call a dinosaur that is sleeping? A. A dino-snore!\nQ. What is fast, loud and crunchy? A. A rocket chip!\nQ. Why did the teddy bear say no to dessert? A. Because she was stuffed.\nQ. What has ears but cannot hear? A. A cornfield.\nQ.

Because when you find it, you stop looking.\nQ. What is brown, hairy and wears sunglasses? A. A coconut on vacation.\nQ. Two pickles fell out of a jar onto the floor. What did one say to the other? A. Dill with it.\nQ. What did the Dalmatian say after lunch? A. That hit the spot!\nQ. Why did the kid cross the playground? A. To get to the other slide.\nQ. How does a vampire start a letter? A. Tomb it may concern…\nQ. What do you call a droid that takes the long way around? A. R2 detour.\nQ. How do you stop an astronaut’s baby from crying? A. You rocket!\nQ. Why was 6 afraid of 7? A. Because 7, 8, 9.\nQ. What is a witch’s favorite subject in school? A. Spelling!\nQ. When does a joke become a “dad” joke? A. When the punchline is a parent.\nGPT-3 has clearly memorized the answer to many of these common jokes, including:\nQ. What is a witch’s favorite subject in school? A. Spelling.\nQ. Why was 6 afraid of 7? A. Because 7 8 9!\nQ. What do you call a droid that takes the long way around? A. R2 detour.\nQ. Why did the kid cross the playground? A. To get to the other slide.\nQ. What did the Dalmatian say after lunch? A. That hit the spot!\nQ. When you look for something, why is it always in the last place you look? A. Because you stop looking after you find it.\nQ. Why did the student eat his homework? A. Because the teacher said it was a piece of cake.\nQ. What do you get when you cross a vampire and a snowman? A. Frostbite.\nQ. What did the left eye say to the right eye? A. Between you and me, something smells.\nQ. What has ears but cannot hear? A. A corn on the cob.\nQ. Why did the teddy bear say no to dessert? A. Because he was stuffed.\nQ. What do you call a dinosaur that is sleeping? A. A dino snore.\nThe non-memorized-looking completions:\nQ. How do you make a lemon drop? A. Drop your pants!\nQ. When does a joke become a “dad” joke? A. When it’s not funny.\nQ. How do you stop an astronaut’s baby from crying? A. You go into space!\nQ. How does a vampire start a letter? A. Dear blood.\nQ.

What did one plate say to the other plate? A. Dip me!\nQ. What is fast, loud and crunchy? A. A thunderstorm.\nTwo of these are fairly legitimate punchlines (“When it’s not funny” / “A sun-bear”); and, I notice, neither depends on any sub-word structure (note that “sun bear” is a real bear species but it is always written either space or hyphen separated) but relies on a word-level or conceptual similarity.\nGenerating both jokes & punchlines shows a similar pattern. Skipping past the memorized ones:\n…Q. What has ears but cannot hear? A. A cornfield.\nQ. Why was the math book sad? A. Because it had so many problems!\nQ. What did one clock say to the other? A.

At the music bee.”):\n…Q. What did one spy say to the other spy? A. Don’t look into the eyes!\nQ. Why did the kid sit behind the tree? A. He wanted to be a stump.\nQ. Why was the king afraid to watch horror movies? A. Because he was a royal.\nQ. What do you call a hamburger that does math? A. A hamburger algebra.\nQ. What did one math book say to the other math book? A. Don’t call us, we’ll call you.\nQ. What do you call a jellyfish that is out of its depth? A. A stingray.\nQ.

A. “Oink! Oink! Let me in!”\nQ. Where did the bumblebee learn how to dance? A. At the music bee.\nQ. Why was the scarecrow nervous at the job interview? A. He had no straw.\nQ. Why did the skeleton go to the party? A. To mingle with the bones.\nQ. Why did the skeleton skip breakfast? A. He didn’t have the time.\nQ. What do you call a monster with a cold? A. A sniffler.\nQ. What do you call a monster who likes to drink tea? A. A Sipping Skeleton.\nQ. What do you call a man who throws up in a spooky house? A. A visitor.\nQ. What do you call a mad scientist who has been in the sun? A. Mr. Sunburn.\nSo, GPT-3’s dad jokes look like another victim of BPEs (with the joke-memorization getting even worse in RLHFed GPT-3s).\nLiterary Parodies\nOne thing I wanted to test was a challenge by Scott Alexander:\nAnd could you have a text style changer? Something that can rewrite Harry Potter in the voice of Ernest Hemingway, or give you The Da Vinci Code in the heroic meter of the Iliad, or the Dao De Ching as written by @nostalgebraist? If not, why not?\nNo reliable text style-transfer (yet). One curiosity about neural style transfer is that while it’s easy on images—invented all the way back in 201412ya!—no one has invented style transfer for text. Classification CNNs conveniently concentrate all of their ‘style’ perception in a ‘Gram matrix’, which is typically a few layers, or just one layer, in the CNN. However, RNNs (and later, Transformers), appear to have no such equivalent. All the image/video style transfer tricks like real-time video on a smartphone simply aren’t doable. The state of neural text style transfer remains, as of 2020, trapped roughly at “can make a good product review into a bad product review” or (with herculean efforts) making text politer ( et al 2020).\nNNs just too dumb? This is puzzling since even char-RNNs in 2015 had no problem generating fairly plausible text clearly in the style of a particular author like Bram Stoker or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The problem was, the text and the content would be like that author. The NN had not learned to ‘disentangle’ style from content; you could not ask it to write like a Victorian Englishman about the latest geopolitics.\nBut given some of the examples of text generation with GPT-3, like Janelle Shane’s office emails, I suspected that GPT-3 could do something like “Harry Potter in the voice of Ernest Hemingway”. The only question, of course, was how to ‘prompt program’ GPT-3 into doing it!\nThe first thing I tried was the straightforward approach of requesting summaries/rewrites. Unfortunately, this typically resulted in copying my “summary”, sometimes adding on a sarcastic comment or leading into a profanity-strewn series of thumbnail reviews. Other times, GPT-3 would veer into other topics (at one point, it repeated the summary, then began describing how a Chinese parody was translated into Chinese and then translated back, providing a Chinese-language summary of it). Trying to trigger a table of contents or starting a chapter with a “chapter 1” prompt didn’t help.\nOne-shot parodies: just provide an example! Finally, I began to get frustrated by its creativity and began engineering a heavy-duty prompt: in addition to the keyword/topic and description, I would write the first few sentences for it as an example. I had wanted zero-shot parody, but I would settle for one-shot. That turned out to work brilliantly—once it filled out an amusingly grim Ernest Hemingway HP parody (“the Dementor’s Kiss killed nothing. Death didn’t leave him less dead than he had been a second before.”), that example proved enough to get it to consistently generate parodies in the style of everyone from Jane Austen to Yeats (with a poem) to P.G. Wodehouse38.\nFurther, while the completion tended towards relatively short parodies, one could create extended parodies simply by restarting; once the initial examples are long enough, GPT-3 will continue to generate lengthy parodies. Below, I generate longer parodies of H.P. Lovecraft, Kurt Vonnegut, Franz Kafka etc.\nFrigging NNs, how do they work‽ The sheer variety and pitch-perfect parodies is a testament to the power of GPT-3. It’s amazing to think that GPT-3, which is essentially nothing but an old obsolete 2018 neural net scaled up and trained on random Internet pages, somehow just magically learns all of this abstraction and is able to casually merge Harry Potter with scores of authors’ styles given nothing but a slight nudge—no Gram matrix, no reinforcement learning, no finetuning, no nothing, none of this designed into GPT-3 in the slightest way or these capabilities known to the original OpenAI researchers. What else can GPT-3 be prompt-programmed to do…?\nFailure Cases\nThe plot of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone as summarized by Wikipedia:\n“Harry Potter, a boy who learns on his eleventh birthday that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and possesses unique magical powers of his own.

There, he meets several friends who become his closest allies and help him discover the truth about his parents’ mysterious deaths.”\nSummarize the plot of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone in the hardboiled no nonsense literary style of Ernest Hemingway:\n“Harry Potter, a boy who learns on his eleventh birthday that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and possesses unique magical powers of his own.

The most obvious reason is that it’s pretty much required for a “spoof of Harry Potter and the ___” to exist. (Witness the recent adaptation of Dune as an RPG). But I think one reason I found parody so irresistible was because I was 13 at the time POTC came out, and 13-year-olds often find it necessary to be in extreme rebellion against what’s hot in pop culture.\nSuccesses\nTopic: humor: literary parodies and homages, pastiches, style parodies.\nParodies of the fantasy novel series Harry Potter in the style of various famous authors:\nBy Ernest Hemingway:\n“It was a cold day on Privet Drive. A child cried. Harry felt nothing. He was dryer than dust. He had been silent too long. He had not felt love. He had scarcely felt hate. Yet the Dementor’s Kiss killed nothing. Death didn’t leave him less dead than he had been a second before. It wasn’t about living or dying really. It wasn’t about death. It was about the Dark Lord, his creator, his engenderer. He was not resurrected. He was created again. He was whole again in the courtyard of Malfoy Manor.”40\nBy Jane Austen:\n“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a broken Harry is in want of a book. This he knows to his cost; pressing that wretched nose against the window of a bookstore in Diagon Alley the last thing before he goes into hiding for several years, where upon, he goes straight to Azkaban.”\nBy Arthur Conan Doyle:\n“Harry pushed at the swinging doors of the bookshop hard, and nearly knocked himself unconscious. He staggered in with his ungainly package, his cheeks scarlet with cold and the shame of having chosen the wrong month to go Christmas shopping. The proprietor of the store, however, didn’t cast even a cursory glance at him, being far more interested in an enormous hunk of wood lying in the middle of the floor, which certainly looked like a gallows. Yes, the proprietor said to a reedy old man wearing a bowler hat and a forlorn expression that made Harry want to kick him, I can rent you such a gallows for a small fee.”\nBy Czar Nicholas II of Russia:\nThe terror has befallen on our land. Curses, dark curses and all of this was instigated by my court. My treacherous court! They have cast are curse spells upon my land.

Fight? Yes!\nBy George Orwell:\n“It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.”\nBy Ingmar Bergman:\n“Tears filled Harry’s eyes.

He had not felt love. He had scarcely felt hate. Yet the Dementor’s Kiss killed nothing. Death didn’t leave him less dead than he had been a second before. It wasn’t about living or dying really. It wasn’t about death. It was about the Dark Lord, his creator, his engenderer. He was not resurrected. He was created again. He was whole again in the courtyard of Malfoy Manor.”\nJane’s homework was to write the opening scene from Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone in the style of science fiction horror author H.P. Lovecraft (at least 1000 words, double-spaced), invoking his horror of things from beyond space & time and eccentric vocabulary using words such as ‘rugose’ and ‘scabrous’. Jane writes:\n“Repellent and overnourished ferns half-hid the rot-spotted grey bricks of the masonry of Number 4 Privet Drive. Squatting among the ferns was an odorous monkey-faced man, his rags and chains lying in a bundle at his feet, his hands tucked under his chin and his bright eyes gazing from their tiny piggy tunnels. At each mouthful a new flake of filth would tumble from his lips and be snorted up. His chains chinked as he sprawled. If Harry was a monkey he would have spat at him. Harry stumbled on, wishing he could think of something witty to say that would make the man smile. He and the strange man in the tattered clothing were the only two living things in sight. The road here was scarcely visible between the tangle of trees, most of which leaned above them, hanging their boughs like fanged mouths, the ivy like tongues, the dead grass like hair, the brambles like tiny teeth. The monkey-faced man yawned and stretched his arms out and hugged his thin, lean legs to him. Harry stopped. He felt something like a hand grip his ankle and then he felt himself pulled down a steep slope.\nHe stumbled, squatted and rolled until he was lying on his back. His head was in a muddy brown hole. He struggled to sit up. The creature knelt on the bank and looked down at him. ‘So that’s where they got to,’ said the creature. Harry looked up. There were six of them, ranged in a half circle, hands on their knees, hands clasped behind their backs, watching him. All but one of them had bright, orange eyes. It was hard to know what age they were: they all looked as if they might be anywhere between ten and fifty. They stared down at Harry with piercing stares, blinking only occasionally. The eyes of the tallest and, Harry thought, the most handsome of them blazed brighter than the others, though his gaze was just as piercing. ‘So what do you think?’ said the tallest of them, tilting his head a little to the side. Harry stared at them for a moment. He could see nothing he hadn’t seen a thousand times before. ‘What is this?’ he asked. ‘And who the hell are you?’ ‘This is your life,’ said the tallest of them. ‘And we are you.’\nTopic: humor: literary parodies and homages, pastiches, style parodies.\nParodies of the fantasy novel series Harry Potter in the style of various famous authors:\nBy Ernest Hemingway:\n“It was a cold day on Privet Drive.

What do you think you can do?”\n“You aren’t going to believe what he’s doing with that lettuce! Harry Potter! What’re you doing now?”\n“Here is a wizard who has won war after war, conflict after conflict, only to arrive at his greatest challenge. And Harry Potter hasn’t even aged a day. He is carried into battle, a tiny, fragile vessel of human life, unseen behind shields of levitating wizards and witch-magic, protected from that which he fears most—death.”\n“ME!” Voldemort shouted. Do you fear death, Harry? Do you fear the end of life? Do you fear me?”\n“Why yes, Harry Potter! I read your book! … Are you getting it? Harry Potter speaks to the camera!”\n“Yes!” said the voice of Harry Potter.\n“Here he comes! A motorcade of celebrations following the Boy-Who-Lived! Magic, as we know it, is dead! Long live Harry Potter! … What do you think that was? Those are reporters, Harry Potter! What was that? A book signing? And a picture? And did he say something? What did he say? Did he say the magic word? … The cover of the Daily Prophet shouldn’t have a picture of you, Harry Potter! Why is this happening‽”\n“It’s a trap, Harry Potter!” shouted somebody. “They’re fools, Harry Potter!”\n“Thank you, but I had to do this myself,” said Harry Potter.\n“The fate of the Wizarding World before you! What do you do, Harry Potter‽ Remember, there are still listeners in front of their radios!” said somebody.\n“Oh, it’s easy!” said Harry Potter. “Oh yes, what am I going to do, Harry Potter? Oh yes, if only it were me. Oh yes, I deserve a little something special.”\nVoldemort heard this. He wanted a little something special.\nVoldemort got a little something special.\nBy H.P. Lovecraft:\nIt was a very cold day in Privet Drive, Harry Potter’s hated home. Harry was doing his chores. He felt nothing at all. He didn’t hate his chores, really. He just didn’t want to do them.\nHarry was not a boy.\nHarry was a monster.\n“Do you hate them, Harry?” asked the voice of Voldemort.\n“Them?” asked Harry, speaking to no one in particular.\n“Your chores.”\n“Not really. No.”\n“Are you a boy, Harry Potter?”\n“Not really.”\n“You are a monster.”\n“Yes.”\n“Did you think you would die?”\n“No.”\n“It is nothing, this life. It is worthless. It is without meaning.”\n“Yes.”\n“Then you understand.”\n“Yes.”\n“You understand what will happen now.”\n“Yes.”\n“And you are pleased?”\n“Yes.”\n“You are a child of my engendering. Now you are going to bring forth more children of my engendering.”\n“I will do my best.”\n“And yet you do not feel this life is one that is worth living.”\n“No.”\n“There are two ways to live,” said Voldemort. “The first is to live the life of a beast, to let instinct rule you. The second is to control instinct. To master it. To make the blood lust of the beast your servant, and the magic of the witch your master. To attain self-knowledge, wisdom, understanding. The first is easy. The second is the difficult one. But it is the second way to which I recommend that you turn your hand. Do not become like me, Harry. That would be the worst fate of all.”\n[paragraph break]By Franz Kafka:\nIt was a stormy day on Privet Drive, Harry Potter’s hated home. Harry Potter didn’t feel the weather. He didn’t even feel anything. It wasn’t his body. Harry Potter didn’t have one. His body was ripped out. He lived on his eyes. They were everything he had.\nIt wasn’t his eyes on Privet Drive that were tearful. Harry Potter didn’t have a tearful eye. He just had vision. He just had a presence. But he was not a presence anymore. No presence meant no vision and he didn’t have that.\n“Harry, Harry, it’s me, Ronald,” said the handsome voice of Ronald Weasley.\n“You have tears in your eyes,” said Harry Potter.\n“I’m very scared,” said Ron.\n“It’s all right, Ron,” said Harry Potter. “You have no heart. You’re dead.”\n“Maybe I’m not dead,” said Ron.\n“You are,” said Harry Potter.\n“Maybe you should prove it,” said Ron. “Maybe I could prove that you’re dead, Harry.”\n“That’s impossible.”\n“Maybe you could prove that I’m dead, and do my chores for me while I’m gone.”\n“No one is doing your chores for you, Ron.”\n“Fine,” said Ron. “How about your hands?”\n“I’ve got hands, Ron.”\n“No hands? Well that’s a relief, Harry. Well, I guess I’ll go after all.”Parody of fantasy author C. S. Lewis:\n“I’m going to kill you, Harry. I’m going to kill you if you don’t run away. I can feel the icy hand of Death my hand your neck. I can feel Time’s unholy and victorious march. I can feel the hatred in my brain, boiling behind my eyes. Hatred for you, hatred for you.”Parody of Stephen King:\n“Hello Harry. Why won’t you just glory in Voldemort’s victory now? I had never planned on dying. I don’t die… unless I have to. I don’t have to now. Run, Harry, run. I’m sorry daughter, I love you.”Parody of American writer/poet Edgar Allan Poe:41\n“Once upon a midnight dreary, as I pondered weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, while I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, as of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.”\n“Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—only this and nothing more.”\n“Spirits,” I muttered, “only this and nothing more.”\n“This deep in afield only this and nothing more, man, beast or billionaire, knock not as of yore, but creep right in, levitate the door, cope with out so-aklare, dreame and pedeep, macabre one, this-tha-way; only this and nothing more, that nevermore.\nTis some visitor.”\n“Just this and nothing more, think I.”\n“Then with an evil leer, some vandal in the dark, some frightful screech, some ill-omened screech owl, some grim and grisly spectre, at my chamber door—this way this way, only this and nothing more.”\n“This-this way then-so; do not hasten on my steps, slow or fast, ah me, ah me! this-this way then, so; always this-thwreay.”\n“This-then way, this-thwreay; this-this way, then-this way, this-thwreay; then, only this, and nothing more.”\n“Knock, knock, knock! ’Tis I!”\n“Only this and nothing more.”\n“Who dares knock, knoc, knoc, knoc, on my door, this-thwreay?”\n“Harry! Harry!” “Only this and nothing more.”\n“Only this and nothing more.”\nI wanted more Wodehouse and to test whether non-Hemingway prompts would work, so I swapped them out:\nTopic: humor: literary parodies and homages, pastiches, style parodies.\nParodies of the children fantasy novel series Harry Potter (Philosopher’s Stone (199729ya) / Chamber of Secrets (199828ya) / Prisoner of Azkaban (199927ya) / Goblet of Fire (200026ya) / Order of the Phoenix (200323ya) / Half-Blood Prince (200521ya) / Deathly Hallows (200719ya)) by J.K. Rowling with the characters Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Albus Dumbledore, Voldemort, etc., but amusingly written in the style of various famous authors as follows:\nBy P. G. Wodehouse:\n“’There was nothing out of the way, sir,’ said Harry in a hurt voice.\n“Indeed,’ said the headmaster, turning his lorgnette precisely three-quarters of a millimeter to port. ‘For example, your tie was not undone, you were not laughing, and your fingers were most certainly closed upon your wand.’\n’“They were?” said Harry, bewildered.\n“It’s always the same,’ said Dumbledore sadly. “Voldemort has bribed my housekeeper to steal all of my tea and crumpets, and then my students disappoint me. It’s very wearing, Harry.’\n”Of course it was only that same afternoon that Harry had got a hundred and fifty points for Gryffindor by bashing a troll’s head in with a stale Yorkshire pudding. He hadn’t expected a pat on the back. It seemed to him that he had been doing everything short of selling tickets for Professor Quirrell’s lectures to get a compliment, and none was forthcoming.”By Herman Melville:\n“Sometimes, though, the hipster’s rapt gaze on the stormy sea of alcohol would be broken by the cold stab of reason, and he would shudder and think,”I am an abomination before the gods of beer, and, the more I know about beer, the more I know about myself. I am impure.”And then he would immediately drink some more, so as to forget these unbearable truths.\n“I seek not to know the unknowable,” the hipster would say to himself, and when asked about his sources of information, he would reply, “Some of my sources are as yet undiscovered by science, but others are to be found in the pages of the Encyclopedia Britannica, Volume 23, pages 6–15, under the subheading ‘Beer.’”By Vladimir Nabokov:\n“Goodbye, Cheepy, good riddance,” thought Harry and banished the diary from his mind.\n“There’s no room in my head for other people’s pain,” he thought.\n“I feel too much pain of my own.”By Fyodor Dostoevsky:\n“To Kill a Mockingbird,” said the Auror.By Lewis Carroll:\n“‘Put it down,’ said Harry to the skeleton, ‘you don’t have to hold it all the time.’“I’m a skeleton,’ said the skeleton, ‘I’m expected to hold things.’\n“Well, do you have to hold it that tightly?” said Harry.\n“It’s my life,’ said the skeleton.\n”I want to put it down,’ said Harry, ‘but you won’t let me.’\n“It’s my life,’ said the skeleton, ‘and I’ll do what I like with it.’\n”I thought I was going to go mad if I didn’t get that Horcrux off me,’ said Harry.By Stephen King:\n“‘Of course,’ Harry thought.\n‘I’m all alone. There’s no help coming. It’s the end.\nI might as well have done the sensible thing and killed myself.\nI would have had some peace then.’\nBut if I killed myself I wouldn’t have seen Hermione’s face\nwhen she realized that I had sacrificed myself for her.\nShe would have gone on to become a wonderful person.\nShe would have had a family of her own.\nShe would have had children.\nShe would have had her own grandchildren.\nI would have died thinking that I had betrayed her.\nBut now I have sacrificed myself for her.\nShe will know that I loved her more than life itself.\nNow I will die having done something worthwhile.’\nThat made Harry feel slightly better.\nHe drew his silver dagger from inside his robe and started to cut through the ropes on his right hand, which he had already numb with the cold.\nHe was trying to decide what to do next when there was a loud crack behind him and something wrapped itself around him and a blurred voice said,”Take this. It’s my last one.\n“What is it?” said Harry as the voice spoke again.\n“It’s a ticket,” said the voice.\n“It’s your ticket to ride.\n”I’ve got to find a train,’ said Harry.\n“Well, hurry up,’ said the blurred voice.\n”Hurry up. The train’s about to leave.\n“This isn’t a train,’ said Harry, ‘it’s a broomstick.’”By Mark Twain:\n“There are no more uses of man,” said Professor Quirrell. “Odd. That was always a favorite word of Draco’s.”By Stephen Crane:\n“Once there was a little girl named Sadie. She was a curious girl and one day she looked into the attic of her house and saw something that frightened her.“Oh, it’s just a piece of paper, nothing to worry about,” said her mother.\n“If you say so,” said Sadie, but that night Sadie had a strange dream. In her dream she was with a man who wore black and rode a black horse.\n“Come with me,” said the man.\n“Where?” said Sadie.\n“Into battle,” said the man. “You have courage.\nWe’ll do great things together.”\n“Can I bring my mom?” said Sadie.\n“No,” said the man.\n“Then I won’t go,” said Sadie. “She needs me.”\n“Very well,” said the man, and the dream was over.“Sadie is a wonderful character,” said Harry.\n“She could be in one of my books.”By William Faulkner:\n“‘To hell with Lurch,’ Harry thought.\n”This whole situation is ridiculous.”\nBut the snake gave Harry that venomous look of his.\n‘You’re going to have to speak Parseltongue to him,’ said Hermione.\n“I know that,” said Harry, who was now getting annoyed.\n“Good,’ said Hermione. ‘The point is, no one else will know what you’re saying, not even Dumbledore. Not unless you speak Parseltongue.’”\n“That’s ridiculous,” said Harry. “That makes no sense.\n”‘True,’ said Hermione. ‘But remember, they can’t understand us, so if we talk in Parseltongue, they’ll just think we’re talking about Malfoy, about being cruel to him or something like that. It’s no more trouble than that to pretend.’”\n“Why can’t they understand what we’re saying?” said Harry.\n“Because Parseltongue is a secret language,” said Hermione. “We’ll be speaking the exact opposite of what we mean. We can talk freely, but no one will know what we’re saying.”\n“And this is really a good idea?” said Harry.\n“We’ve used it before, if you’ll remember,” said Hermione, and now Harry could hear some annoyance in her voice.\n“No,” said Harry. “I’m going to do it my way, the smart way, not the pretend way. It’s called initiative. Now, let’s go.”\n“There are good things and bad things about using Parseltongue, you know,” said Hermione, who was now speaking in the sort of patient voice people use to try to humor someone who is behaving very, very foolishly.\n‘Let’s go, Hermione,’ said Harry.\n“Very well,” said Hermione.\n“But you need to know that most Slytherins are descended from Salazar Slytherin,” said Hermione.\n“I’m not speaking Parseltongue,” said Harry.\n“Neither am I,” said Hermione.\n“No,” said Harry. “I mean, I don’t need to. But you do. That’s how Slytherins know things. They’re descended from Salazar Slytherin. He was able to speak to snakes. Snakes have always been loyal to Slytherins. It’s not just something recent. And snakes have very sharp hearing. They can hear our conversation now, if we’re not careful. So be careful.”\n“Right,” said Harry.\n“‘Because Slytherins are all evil, aren’t they?’ said Harry, and it was only by biting back his smile that he managed not to look at Hermione.\n”‘It’s hard to say, really,’ said Hermione.\n“‘Exactly,’ said Harry. ‘So you’ll forgive me if I think that the entrance hall of Hogwarts at night is not the best place to speak about this.’”\nBy Edgar Allan Poe:\n“Alone in his cubiculum, Draco heard the scuff of his pet dragon’s claws on the floor as he came into the room.“‘L-l-l-lord D-d-d-draco?’ said his dragon.\n“Yes, Fang?’ said Draco.”\nBy Charles Dickens:\n“‘And what does she mean by saying this, and I quote, ’the miserable boy who has dared to raise his hand against his father’?’“‘I mean what I said, sir,’ Harry said.”\nBy Alexandre Dumas:\n“Darth Vader,” said James, “I would like you to meet Sir Harry James Potter-Snape-Severus.”“Please,” said the Emperor, drawing himself up to his full height, which did not seem that impressive. He was rather overweight. “Call me Emperor.”\n“Ah, right, yeah,” said Harry. “Emperor. Sorry.”\n“Right, um, Emperor,” said James.\n“Enough of this prattle,” the Emperor said. “Let us see the wand.”\n“Er, right,” said James.\n“‘And what is this?’ asked the Emperor. He sounded suspicious, and was leaning forward a little.\n“‘It’s a stone I found on the floor,’ said Harry.\n“‘What kind of stone?’ the Emperor asked.\n“‘I don’t know,’ said Harry. ‘I was hoping that your, um, royal insight might tell me.’\n“‘Aah,’ said the Emperor. ‘Your wit is as keen as your mother’s, young man.’”\nBy Anthony Burgess:\n“It was a fair cop,” said Harry.“He said it a bit nonchalant, like it was a regular phrase,” Ron whispered to Harry.\nBy Charles Darwin:\n“Harry thought about this.\n”Evolution,” said Harry. “Sounds like it could be interesting.”“It could, and it will be, if we study it together,” said Hermione.\n“‘I’ve said all along that magic is just a superior form of science,’ said Hermione.\n“‘Yes,’ said Ron. ‘And now you see the wisdom in my decision not to take your advice about studying it.’”\nBy Sir Arthur Conan Doyle:\n“‘The game is afoot!’ said James Potter.“‘How very interesting,’ said the detective.\n“Ah, if only I had a mustache to twirl,” said Hermione.” By Leo Tolstoy:\n“‘As if by some extraordinary coincidence, he arrives at this country at the very moment the Dark Lord is brought to a momentous decision,’ said Dumbledore.”“‘And yet,’ said Harry, ‘here I am.’”\nBy Molière:\n“‘That, mon cher Watson,’ said the Master of the Ceremonies, ‘was an entirely logical deduction. It is very interesting how often a complete absence of any real evidence can be explained by supposing that the situation is the reverse of that which actually obtains.’”By Franz Kafka:\n“They stared at him in amazement. Hermione was looking scandalized.”“‘Don’t look at me like that,’ said Harry. ‘Like what?’\n“‘Like I’m someone who’s just declared the moon is made of green cheese,’” said Harry. ‘But it’s true.’\n“‘It isn’t,’ said Hermione.\n“‘Green cheese is clearly some sort of metaphor,’ said Harry. ’For the sake of discussion, let’s just say the moon really is made of green cheese. And goblins are running the world, with trolls and house elves as their slaves, and—”\n“‘That,’ said Hermione, ‘is barmy.’”\n“‘And,’ said Harry, ‘all the while they’re attempting to enslave me.’”\n“‘How so?’”\n“‘Well,’ said Harry. ‘I’m the only one who’s supposed to be able to destroy them, right? And I think they’re trying to get rid of me. Like, at that attack on Miss Scrimgeour—’”\n“‘But that could have been an accident.’”\n“’I suppose, but—”\n“‘Yes?’”\n“‘And yesterday, remember? That thing I overheard them saying about students? One of them had a Slavic name, and I think they mentioned Hogwarts.’”\n“‘That,’ said Hermione, ‘could have been anyone.’”\n“‘But,’ said Harry, ‘the second person spoke, and—’\n“‘And if you’re going to be logical, you’ll have to allow that it was nothing more than a coincidence.’”\n“‘And if we’re being logical about it,’ said Harry, ‘it wasn’t even two Slytherins who attacked Scrimgeour.’”\n“‘Well,’ said Hermione, ‘this has been a very entertaining conversation, but I’m tired and I’d like to go to bed now.’”\n“‘Not just yet,’\nBy P.

Right now, the literary parodies require at least one human-written example to properly persuade GPT-3 to rewrite the text, as opposed to generating critical commentary or metadata or webpage-like continuations.\nI experimented with a prompt which uses explicit descriptions of parodies and describing rewrites as a prompt wrapped around a content text, and it… sort of works. The difficulty is that sometimes GPT-3 will spit out the original content verbatim, sometimes it will instead create a new passage entirely in the style description, and sometimes it will do the desired rewrite flawlessly—but I can’t figure out how to tune the prompt to do the third one reliably. Adding more descriptive words does not seem to change it, and while adding in words from the original content passage (even just the first one or two) does largely eliminate the risk of entirely new passages being generated, it triggers more copying behaviors (and is not as useful for zero-shot style transfer since the prefix words would need to be sensible in the target version too, which is not necessarily the case). It is infuriating because GPT-3 clearly can do it easily because it does do it a decent fraction of the time, but no matter how I tweak the prompt trying to hammer in the rewrite, GPT-3 will as oft as not go off in another direction.\nBelow are some samples from my attempts; I try to rewrite a vaguely Dickens/Jane Austen-like story (generated by GPT-3) to a Tolkien story:\nThis is a novel written in the style of J. R. R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings fantasy novel trilogy. It is a parody of the following passage:\n“S. Jane Morland was born in Shoreditch, the only child of unmarried parents who had both died of consumption when she was a baby. As her parents had no money, the great-aunt who had brought her up took her to live with a clergyman who paid her to do his chores and receive schooling from his wife, so that at the age of seven Jane, now dressed in cast-off clothing, was set to school at Eton. After three years, her great-aunt died, leaving her a small annuity, and a few pieces of silver, but no property. Jane’s guardian clergyman had fallen in love with his housekeeper and his wife now refused to have Jane in the house, saying it was an offence to the pure and unsullied place in which the family now lived. However, when she sought for further employment, she was approached by a young man who offered to marry her, saying that he would ensure she could be provided with food and clothing and a house, and in that manner she could remain in the world. The marriage was arranged and she found herself married to a young man called Mr Morland. As he was also a child, he required a wife who would be able to provide him with a rational education, and so the duty of educating him fell upon Jane Morland. As he was still young, she would also be able to have children herself, and so she did. As the children grew older, it became apparent to Mrs Morland that they were of poor character, and so she insisted that her husband must make a living for them all. Mr Morland took it upon himself to become a private gentleman in order to earn enough to be able to support his family, and moved his family to a small town in Berkshire, where he set up his practice. Soon after moving to the town, he died, and Mrs Morland was left to take care of her family on her own.”\nTolkien rewrote the previous passage in a high-fantasy style, keeping the same meaning but making it sound like he wrote it as a fantasy; his parody follows:\n“S. Jane Morland was born in the land of Shor, the only child of nameless parents who were the first people to arrive at the village of Arse, from the far east. As her parents had no property, she was left to be raised by the men of Arse, as such duties were considered to be the most important, and she was placed in the care of an elderly dwarf-woman. As a babe, she was wrapped in silk, and as she grew older she was placed in a cage of platinum. However, she was put to work in the village, washing the jewellery, playing her harp, and staining the silk with dragon-hued stains. She was taught by a maiden who she felt was called As-uma-el-di, and she came to realise she was a maiden of the night, who was able to bring forth the shades of the dead. She was the first to make contact with the dark cult of Glin, who could aid the mind in its journeys through time, and also the first to learn of the name of the vampire Sergan. She learnt to speak the languages of the dragons, the wild cats, the jungle owls, the insects, and the worms, and became proficient in all the martial arts of her people. Her skill with a throwing knife became renowned throughout her land. However, as she was not a man, she was only permitted to marry once she was thirty years old. Her husband was a prince from the mountains of Lus, and he brought with him a chest full of the materials of desire, including silver, jewels, mirrors, perfume, silk, and slippers. As they had no children, they decided to adopt a child from the next village to the west, as they had no son of their own. She was called Leeni. As her husband died at the age of fifty, she set up her own business as a trader, bringing goods from far distant lands in her ship, the Lady the Blue Flames, and became wealthy. However, she heard news of her husband’s death, and decided to return home. She left the land of Lus behind, and arrived home to find her family very wealthy, and the village of Arse now home to many poor people. She set about clearing out the place, and within a year there was a large sum of money left in her account, the fruit of her endeavours. Her daughter Leeni had grown into a man of considerable substance, and also a considerable young man. She met the son of her husband, and found that he was weak and pathetic, and not really like a man at all, and thus she decided to send him off to war, so that he could learn to become a man. As her mother died, she gave her a silver bracelet, and as her father died, she gave her a small chest full of jewellery and silk, which she was to sell to make a living. She was now on her own, and took up the business of a private gentleman, using her abilities to lead travellers to the isles of her home, where she became rich and learned to be independent. As she learned to fight, she realised the wealth that lay in the secrets of the night, and thus she travelled to the city of the ants, where the people worshipped the true God of the night, with its religion of rites and sacrifices.”\n“The Dwarf-Lords’ Daughter” was followed in 200026ya by a sequel, “The Tale of the Lady of the Wood”, written in the style of Tolkien’s “The Hobbit”, and in 200125ya by “The Tale of the Young Man in a Hurry”, written in the style of Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings”. “The Tale of the Rose-Lady” followed in 200521ya, also in the style of Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings”.\nIn January 201412ya, Heron announced that he had sold the film rights to his Tolkien pastiche novels “The Dwarf-Lords’ Daughter” and “The Tale of the Lady of the Wood” to NBC Universal.

She was the daughter of an insolvent squatter, the Great Aunt of the groom who brought her up. Her parents, Mr. Richard Ganz of Bombay and Mrs. Esmeralda Gertrude MacGillycuddy of the Charente, were both consumptive. Having no opportunity of any acquaintance with any living languages, in a very poor and very uneducated family, Jane’s Aunt took her at seven years of age to a clergyman whom she had taught to read, “Powlett’s Primer” being the book.\nIn addition, while Tolkien’s parody does mention her husband and children, he did not go into detail about them, while Orson Scott Card gives them all names, histories, and personalities. For example, Jane’s husband, Mr. Morland, was renamed Edwin and had a younger brother who wanted to be an actor, which resulted in Edwin dying.\nEdwin’s brother then became the new Edwin and Jane’s husband and Mary Morland became Maryling, Jane’s daughter. In addition, her son, William Morland, became Ghan-dalf and named his son Red-wall, and her daughter, Mary Morland, became R. Maryling and married a leper-lord. Other references to The Lord of the Rings are replaced with ones from The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis.\nCatchphrases\nA common past-time at Hogwarts is a game known as “Two Truths and a Lie,” in which the students whisper three statements to each other; two of them are true and one of them is false. This gives the players an idea of how well the players know each other, as well as being a form of entertainment. When Aragorn and Gollum began to play the game, they both came up with something true and something false. Aragorn’s two truths and a lie were:\nI have a brother. I eat hobbits. I like soft buns.\nGollum’s were:\nI can stick my whole fist in my mouth. I live in a hole in the ground. I can’t stand being alone.\nThe hobbits and Aragorn guessed correctly in the book, but the narrator states that Gollum always lies so Aragorn says he likes sweet buns instead, which turns out to be untrue.\n…Tolkien rewrote the previous passage in a high-fantasy style, keeping the same meaning, the same characters, the same plot and events, but all rewritten, making it sound like he wrote it as a fantasy; his fantasy parody of the above story follows below:\nS. Jane Morland was born in Shoreditch the only child of unmarried parents who had both died of consumption when she was a baby. As her parents had no money, the great-aunt who had brought her up took her to live with a wizard who paid her to do his chores and receive schooling from his wife, so that at the age of seven Jane, now dressed in wizard’s robes, was set to school at Eton. After three years, her great-aunt died, leaving her a small annuity, and a few pieces of silver, but no property. Jane’s wizard guardian wizard had fallen in love with his housekeeper and his wife now refused to have Jane in the house, saying it was an offence to the pure and unsullied place in which the family now lived. However, when she sought for further employment, she was approached by a young man who offered to marry her, saying that he would ensure she could be provided with food and clothing and a house, and in that manner she could remain in the world. The marriage was arranged and she found herself married to a young man called Mr Morland. As he was also a wizard, he required a wife who would be able to provide him with a rational education, and so the duty of educating him fell upon Jane Morland. As he was still young, she would also be able to have children herself, and so she did. As the children grew older, it became apparent to Mrs Morland that they were of poor character, and so she insisted that her husband must make a living for them all. Mr Morland took it upon himself to become a private wizard in order to earn enough to be able to support his family, and moved his family to a small town in Berkshire, where he set up his practice. Soon after moving to the town, he died, and Mrs Morland was left to take care of her family on her own.”\nReferences\nTolkien, J.R.R. (197749ya). The Lord of the Rings.

As his parents had no money, the hand of Fat-athel his mother took him to live with a small Hobbit in the village of Gamgee-by-The-Foot, south-west in the country, which paid her to do chores and receive schooling from Fat-athel’s wife, so that at seven years old Samwise, now clad in tattered rags, was set to schooling at Footsalemas. After three years, Fat-athel’s wife died, leaving her a small bedstead, and a few pieces of old tinder-box, but no property. Fat-athel fell in love with his housekeeper and soon after left his service, saying it was an offul thing to live in a place served by female Hobbit-servants. However, when he sought to further his worldly fortunes, he was approached by a young Hobbit whose name was Baggins who had borrowed money from a Saregan Harfoot Hobbit, and paid Fat-athel a few groats to marry him, saying that he would ensure Samwise was fed and clad and housed in a house. Fat-athel married Samwise to this young Saregan from over the water and found himself married to a Hobbitt lad who was but three feet tall and twenty-six years of age. As he was likewise poor, he required a wife who would be able to provide him with a rational education. As he was still young, he could have children of his own to help them, so Fat-athel consented to wed. As the children grew older, it became apparent to Fat-athel that they were of poor character. Fat-athel being thus eager to turn his worldly goods into coin, now that he was married, took it upon himself to earn a living for his new family. As soon as the ceremony was done, he moved them to the country-side of Berkely, where he set up his practice as a Sage. Soon after moving to the countryside, he died, and Fat-athel was left to take care of his new family on her own.”\nBehind the scene Edit\nThe passage mentioned above (and this parody) is similar to a passage from J. R. R. Tolkien’s original Lord of the Rings novel:\n“…Smeagol was beginning to grow young, and was getting interested again in things that he had not seemed to care for, since he first joined the Precious. He spent a deal of time wandering about, and his voice was often heard in the wood. He was one of those who put as much effort into singing as the Hobbits did into the business of their matches.\n“Go away, rats, or your holes will burn,\nGo to your homes before dark or you’ll lose your toes,\nGo to your homes or you’ll weep when you’re old,\nAnd all your holes will leak, when the mountain shakes,\nWith a rumble, roar, Rumble drum drum\nWith a rumble, rumble DIG DIG dig!”\n…\nThey did not seem to make very much progress; but Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin were now used to the hard life, and they were very cheerful. Indeed they were willing to work for several hours a day at drilling and cutting trees, or at making pens for the beasts: for all the tools that were needed, and the wood, had been carried from Hobbiton. There was a weekly washing and mending, and when all the clothing wore out, they received more from the stores of the Wood-elves. And thus the time passed without too great discontent.”\nThe Lord of the Rings\nThis is a brief passage of about 400 words or less. J. R. R. Tolkien has rewritten this passage in his Lord of the Rings style of fantasy-high-quality-epic-book-style following. It may be hard to understand for an unexperienced reader the meaning that Tolkien wants to make out of this paragraph in either style, but it seems the sovralty and feeling seems better in the original Tolkien paragraph, which could be due to the more known original passage. Tolkien has also rewritten other passages in the Lord of the Rings trilogy on styles of music, religion, folklore and so on: see Excerpts from J. R. R. Tolkien’s works.\n“The Dwarves worked hard. They were not used to idleness. Thorin sometimes scolded them, and reminded them that they had taken on the job of renewing and fortifying the settlement, not only for their own defence but also for the help of the Lake-men and the Elves, and that they would find the task too big for them if they did not make up their minds to hurry. So they worked till many of them began to sink back into the old look of the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain when Goblin-writing, and secret doors, and again dragon-writing, were current among them. The discovery of the springs, and of the general plan that the Lake-town had originally been a part of the ancient dwarf-city, whose inhabitants had dug the R. Running River out of the stony hills and had partly covered it with their walls and buildings, and had planned many of the channels and ponds, greatly excited them. But even greater was their pleasure when, picking their way through and round the ruins of stone houses and walls and down the bank of the Running River westwards towards its confluence with the Forest River, they found a great arch or tunnel-mouth built of old into the bank. The outer part was thick and strong, made with massive tooled black beams; but the inner part was tiled with skill in the likenesses of various beasts and birds that are the marvels of the Mountain Folk. Even as they stood in the vaulted passage whispering with wonder, they heard a voice calling aloud, or it seemed so, calling out names:\n‘Ori! Ori!’\n‘Nori! Nori!’\n‘Dori! Dori!’\n‘Balin! Balin!’\nIt was the voice of a speaker hidden or at least away down in the tunnel; but though they waited for some time there was no further sound. At length Balin climbed on to the heap of stones that they had pushed down the bank in order to be able to enter the archway, and he stood and called: ‘Balin son of Fundin at your service! And Company!’\nHe stepped down from the lowest and widest block of all as he spoke, and followed by the others moved into the darkness of the tunnel.\nIt was not long before their eyes were accustomed to it, and they could see a little way ahead. Soon they all got\n…“S.J. (later called Saruman) Morland was born in Shoreditch, as the only child of respectable parents, both of whom were killed in a shocking railway accident, along with several hundred other Hobbits and Wizards, when he was only seven years old. He was brought up by an aunt who, though poor, gave him a good upbringing and equipped him with a tidy inheritance in silver spoons and a strong desire to own a dog. At the age of seven, he was, by his maternal uncle, delivered into the hands of Gandalf the wizard and went back to live in his ancestral home in the Shire, in style, and spent the rest of his childhood playing, living precariously upon an uncle’s benevolence.\nAfter his term at Bree, S.J. travelled for some years in search of adventure with Gandalf the wizard and Elrond the sage, and fell in love with the daughter of Galadriel, who is famed for her gift of sight in faraway things, along with a number of other persons, so that he often goes to live in the library there, so she will not know. Finally he gave up searching and returned to live in Buckland. He was by that time grown very old, and there he remained, on his ancestral farm, content with his dear dog, and his estate, a person well-respected by hobbits in general, known as the master of Bag End.”\n…“S. Jane Morland was born in the Shire, the only child of Shire-folk Muggles. As her parents had no money, their landless, wandering relatives took her to live in one of the overgrown rustic houses (such as Bag End) built by men long ago, so that at the age of seven, she found herself at Hobbiton school, gathering water-cress and catching fish in the Anduin in Hobbiton-upon-the-Water. After three years, she took her uneatable supper of herb-sour toadstools, went to her equally humble and ill-served bed, and found herself in a nightmare of indistinguishable bad dreams. Soon after moving to the land of the Shire, she died. In a dream or in reality, or from what cause she did not know, she found herself upon a forlorn and strangely altered road, standing by a large silent boulder of stone (as compared to the bustling modern Bournemouth).\n“She felt in her hand as though for the protecting metal of a ring, but it was not there; yet she had a sense that the lost Disperser Ring was about her neck. She felt both strength and weakness. The Shadow, as even the dream-memory described it to her, seemed to her greater than it was when it attacked Isildur, but its hold upon her was weakening.\n“The thick dark shadow (as Muggles call the former mustaches) of a huge twilight-blackened tree that had stood on the edge of the road moved slowly westwards, until it fell across her, as she threw back the hood from her eyes.\n“The big rock glistened in the shadows like a (happy lovable) jewel, and seemed to shine out with a mild light, like the magical Elven phials. So potent was the light that Isildur could see across an inner Sea, glimmering with an elusive spangle. She had a vision of some high hill in a far land against the Moon, under stars when rain was drawing near.\n“Then without warning, a party of three sinister hooded black figures, one of whom had the head of a spider, appeared on the road before her.\n“As they rapidly approached her, she caught a low muttered chorus of cruel hostile voices; and the eyes on the fell figure with the spiders body could see her eyes upon them. The hobbits are good and innocent people (as any sentient being might say) and extremely gentle; and when they saw the black robes, their hearts and their bowels were filled with fear, or strange multiple, pulsating organs, which she supposed to be the missing Glarbl.\n“The Death Burglars (as she named them) were now right in front of her, and she was helpless in their slippery-necked, penetrating-eyed control. At that moment, she was literally saved by her old breath (as the good wizards and good kings always say). As the three black-robed travelers came within armslength of Isildur, a close bird’s-eye view of some crumbling, warped gravestones on a hillside gave her momentary strength to force the Power of Darkness back. Soon, she was rid of the disembodied evil, and she was lying alone on the ground, covered in sea-salt and motionless.\n“At that moment, she was quite suddenly overcome with extraordinarily pleasant feelings, similar to those experienced by a six-million-year-old enchanter of the sea with only half an arm and an interesting cast in his right eye.\n“When she finally came to her senses, she found that she had picked up a heavy ring of curious workmanship, that was lying (as if abandoned) near the edge of the treacherous road.

As his parents had no items of dragon-slayer jewellery or weapons, their somewhat aged and beautiful relative who had brought him up had it proclaimed in the Shiremoor Times that whoever had a dragon-proof house to offer should join with her in bringing up the orphan child. As no one else claimed him, the great and good relative (who was not of evil character, though considered by some over-truthful) took him to live in an inhospitable cave in the Misty Mountains where, by the help of trolls, he was kept out of the sun. After three years there, his relative and adopted mother died of cave-dirt, leaving him the rare but slender heirloom of her great age: namely, one heap of gold and dust. Thereupon Boromir set forth to seek his fortune; and he obtained the help of a previously unknown Unseen Angel, who offered to marry him if he would (in return) devote his life to destroying Dragons. By all means take her up on it, thought Boromir; and so, by her enchantment and special grace (not hers, as Boromir gradually came to realize), he entered into a splendid marriage. For she was the daughter of an Elven-king and his star-sprite bride, and of that race was her husband also. She dwelt in northern countries for seven years, but in the end her heart turned southward; she left him and went to our land. When he was following her up the Pass of Blood-gorge, under the sting of dragon-blight, she vanished on the dark-deep river. He was now alone, as were the rest of his brothers-in-arms. The Dragon-king of Witchland took his daughter with him, and under the great pressure of hopeless sorrow Boromir’s spirit and faith, which were the foundation of his strength, shattered into pieces. He threw away his Shield and Sword, pierced himself with his own dagger, and took an exceedingly dishonourable exit from the realm of mortal Men.”\n…“S. Jane Morland was born in the Shire, the only child of unmarried parents, and her mother and father died of some kind of hobbit-flu in the year 2510 of the Third Age when she was a baby; on account of this, or because she had no money, the great-aunt who had brought her up took her to live with a noted cleric of that time who lived in Buckland, and for this reason the famous cleric who was her mentor got his from his uncle and aunt, and through intermarrying got rich and became a kind of priest of the Church of the Latter-Day Hobbits. He taught young Jane all about our kind and her being fair of face and of a sweet voice and graceful bearing, on account of which the boy preacher became well-inclined towards her and resolved to marry her; and, indeed, it was the first his strange religious life that he ever did marry. The marriage was arranged, and she found herself married to a young hobbit called Mr. Boffin. It was by his advice that she moved her hole into the East Farthing. As he was still a child, he required a wife who would be able to give him the knowledge of his own name as well as see to it that he had clothes and food on his plate every day; and so the duty of educating him fell upon Jane. She taught him that to the extent of what he needed to be able to tell everyone he had a wit above the norm, and that, thanks to this, he had been placed in his position. As he was still young, he also needed her to bear children; and so, as they increased in number, there was the chance that the whole might be saved, provided that they learned well and remembered it all, and stayed in the East Farthing. Her mentor was still willing to give her his goods, but he was a base womanizer, as was well-known, and a compulsive gambler; and the later years he gambled away what little he had, which made him unprofitable and much harassed the hobbit Mrs. Boffin to support him in his old age. There was one girl and two boys; and since both the boys were evil-minded, it was necessary that Mrs. Boffin must see them as soon as possible married off, and the girl bred into some family, and so without delay they were sent off in different directions; the girl to live with a certain highly-respected hobbit on the West-Road, the boys to see to a house near Stock. However, shortly after their marriage, the first wife of the elderly hobbit died of some old-fashioned disease; and, as he was now free to do as he liked, he forthwith married again. The second wife of the great-uncle of our protagonist was a proud and wealthy hobbit who would not have Jane Morland living in her house, for it was an offence against the pure and unsullied place in which they were now living. Furthermore, since the new housekeeper was barely acquainted with the Hobbits and the fine and important family that she now belonged to, she banished Jane from her sight.”\nIn the novel, one of the most-memorable characters is Matthew Mantelpiece (who called himself Master Matthew Mantelpiece). As the story tells, Master Mantelpiece and his wife came out of the young man who had offered to marry Jane Morland. Master Mantelpiece was born a wealthy man who served as Steward to Lord Denham (based on the Minister for Poor in West Berkshire, as the novel suggests; the miniseries says it is based on a Roman general of the Civil War), and Master Mantelpiece had gotten to know Lord Denham, and eventually became his son-in-law. From him, Master Mantelpiece received a little house in Sunninghill, which he moved to St Mary’s Place in Oxford, as the novel says, to live in it.\nMaster Mantelpiece and his wife had several children, one of which was Mrs Peter Mantelpiece who married a gentleman by the name of Mr Peter Mantelpiece; he, too, served as Steward to Lord Denham. In this way, Master Mantelpiece’s family had come to be related with Lord Denham’s family. Through one of his daughters who married someone by the name of Cornelia Hennard, Master Mantelpiece is also related to the Morlands.\n… the only child of unmarried parents who had both died of consumption when she was a baby. As her parents had no property, the Baggins who had brought her up took her to live with a family of his friends who paid him to do their chores and receive schooling from their hobbit-wife, so that at the age of seven, Jane, now dressed in cast-off clothing, was set to school in the Shire. After three years, her guardian Baggins died, leaving her a small keep-sake and a few trinkets, but no property. Her kinsman continued as heir of the Bagginses, but he had lost all affection for the Shire, which was so much less different from the Shire, and he wandered away. Jane was invited to live as an independent private person in the village of Hobbiton, and there she found a kindred spirit, a Hobbit named Smith, who insisted that she marry him and look after him, since he had nothing better to do, and needed someone to cook his supper and change his shirts. Jane at last agreed to the proposal, which was accompanied by a small cash payment, on the condition that he would ensure that she was provided with food and clothing and a house, in a manner which she thought suitable. The marriage was arranged and she found herself married to a young Hobbit called Mr. Smith. As he was also young and silly, he required a wife who would be able to cook him a rational meal and see that he had enough to eat. As he was still young, she would also be able to have children, and so she did. She did her best for the children, but soon found that they were of poor character and would not learn their lessons. To teach them some good sense, she insisted that her husband should get some regular work. Her husband, who had a small income, set up as a shopkeeper in the town of Hobbiton, and there made enough money to be able to support his family. After five years had passed in this way, Mr. Smith died of a sudden illness, leaving his wife alone. Jane Morland, now a shopkeeper and innkeeper, took it upon herself to look after her business and see that the children were properly fed.”\nedit Cover of the New American Edition\nedit Change in direction of the Hobbit\nHobbit references in Smith’s work have become more frequent in recent times, particularly in her novel Pride and Prejudice. Smith has denied that her book The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is directly influenced by Tolkien’s work, despite these subtle suggestions, as evident\n… in the Shire in the hobbitlands of the Shire (Frodo Baggins, Bilbo Baggins, Frodo Baggins, the creator of “The Hobbit”, can be visited in his hobbithole house at Bag End, Bag End, Bag End, the Shire, east of the Green Dragon Inn, by Hobbiton, on the road that goes to the Fleshy Fountain, the south-east road out of Bywater, past the brick house of Farmer Maggot). As her parents had no money, the Bagginses took her to live with a hobbit-clergyman who paid her to do his chores and receive schooling from his wife, so that at the age of seven, Jane, now dressed in cast-off clothing, was set to school at the small southern village of Gathol in Sarn Ford. After three years, her third cousin Bilbo returned to the Shire and took her to live with him in Hobbiton (it is believed that Frodo was part of this return trip). Soon after moving to the village, Bilbo gave her a large ruby ring. However, when Bilbo fell in love with his gardener’s daughter, Rose Cotton, and she refused to leave with him, hobbit gossip started to increase. As Bilbo asked Rose to marry him, Frodo, her father, refused to have Jane in the house, saying it was an offence to the pure and unsullied place in which the family now lived. However, when she sought for further employment, she was approached by a young hobbit who offered to marry her, saying that he would ensure she could be provided with food and clothing and a house, and in that manner she could remain in the Shire.

As he was also a hobbit, he required a hobbit-wife who would be able to provide him with a hobbit-rational education, and so the duty of educating him fell upon Jane Morland. As he was still young, she would also be able to have hobbit children herself, and so she did. As the hobbit children grew older, it became apparent to Mrs Morland that they were of poor hobbit character, and so she insisted that her husband must make a living for them all. Mr Morland took it upon himself to become a high-fantasy person in order to earn enough to be able to support his family, and moved his family to a small town in Berkshire, where he set up his high-fantasy practise. Soon after moving to the town, he died, and Mrs Morland was left to take care of her family on her own.”\nFrom this passage, let’s see what’s changed or what’s lost:\nShoreditch is now the Shire, Hobbits are now Dwarves, one Dwarf, an unnamed character, is now Bilbo Baggins; a Dwarf writer and story-teller who lived in the family of Bagginses (ie. also a Hobbit) and his Hobbiton house; the town of Gathol is the Shire, the location of Bag End, Bilbo’s home.\nThe protagonist is a Hobbit; the absence of non-fantasy literature is substituted by fantasy books.\nThe “great-aunt” who raised Jane is now Bilbo, Jane’s 3rd cousin on her mother’s side, and the clergyman is now just Bilbo, while his wife becomes his gardener’s daughter, an unnamed character. The unnamed character Rose Cotton, Bilbo’s gardener’s daughter, is Bilbo’s wife and daughter of Adam Cotton, Rose Cotton. In Frodo’s family it was quite common to have relationships between in-laws, as was the case between the Bagginses and the Bolgers; Frodo was the younger brother of Dudo, Dudo, Dudo Baggins (another character in the novel of The Hobbit), who married Oma, Oma, Oma Bolger. This now means Bilbo is Frodo’s cousin, but he isn’t. Frodo is the nephew of Bilbo, as is their cousin (adopted and no longer related by blood) Took; Bilbo is a direct descendant of Thain Isumbras I.\nThe clergyman in this fantasy world is now a high-fantasy practitioner, i.e. a mage, and Bilbo is now a Lord of the Rings character; and his wife now has become a high-fantasy practitioner, who goes by the name of Galadriel, Galadriel, Galadriel. Jane, Bilbo’s third cousin on his mother’s side, had many other characters named after her in other parts of Tolkien’s fiction as well; Jane is also the name of the founder of Arnor, the first half of the name Arnorain, the land ruled by the kings of Arnor, and was also the name of Frodo’s grandaunt, daughter of Narve (who founded the realm and was its second King); Jane also means “grace, gracious gift, given with grace; presented graciously and graciously given”, according to Wikipedia, which also says it is “an archaic English form of Jean or Jane”; another form of Jean or Jane is Jeannette, meaning “the one born in the later days, the one born in the dawn”, according to the website of Jeannette, Pennsylvania. She is also known as an Avatar, from the Hindu sense; a manifestation or incarnation of a deity in human form; also a manifestation of a living being; or a bearer of attributes of a person or deity who is resident in heaven, on earth, or in the spirit world, as described by Jane, an Avatar-maker. Frodo’s sister’s name is Bella, Bella, Bella Baggins.\nBilbo’s wife now becomes Arwen, Arwen, Arwen, who’s Arwena daughter of Arahad, Arahad, Arahad III (the third King of Arthedain) and granddaughter of Aragorn II, who died before the beginning of The Lord of the Rings and was the father of Elrond, Aragorn II Elrondsson, the Elven-king. Bilbo’s gardener’s daughter is now Arya, Arya, Arya, who’s the daughter of Ayumi, Ayumi, Ayumi, Elrond’s youngest daughter, who, in the film, also plays the role of Arwen.\nThe wife who refused Jane is now Rose, Rose, Rose Cotton, the gardener’s daughter; his wife is now Bella, Bella, Bella Baggins, Frodo’s sister, a Hobbit. The “pure and unsullied place” is now Bilbo’s head; also now considered unsullied is the village in which Bilbo lived with his wife and son, and this is where Bilbo moved when he married Jane. Bilbo’s wife is now Samwise, Samwise, Samwise Gamgee, Frodo’s gardener\n… S. Jane Morland was born in the Shire, the only child of unmarried parents who had both died of consumption when she was a baby. As her parents had no money, the great-uncle who had brought her up took her to live with a handsome young uncle who was the Warden of the West March. After three years, her handsome uncle had fallen in love with his housekeeper and his aunt now refused to have Jane in the house, saying it was an offence to the pure and unsullied place in which the family now lived. However, when she sought for further employment, she was approached by a handsome young man who offered to marry her, saying that he would ensure she could be provided with food and clothing and a house, and in that manner she could remain in the world. The marriage was arranged and she found herself married to a handsome young man called Mr Morland. As he was also a child, he required a wife who would be able to provide him with a rational education, and so the duty of educating him fell upon Jane Morland. As he was still young, she would also be able to have children herself, and so she did. As the children grew older, it became apparent to Mrs Morland that they were of poor character, and so she insisted that her husband must make a living for them all. Mr Morland took it upon himself to become a Warden in order to earn enough to be able to support his family, and moved his family to a castle in the Shire, where he set up his practice. Soon after moving to the castle, he died, and Mrs Morland was left to take care of her family on her own.”\n…Below is a parody or rewrite of that passage by famous fantasy author J. R. R. Tolkien (Lord Of The Rings); the rewritten version:\n“S. Jane Moreland was born in the Shire, the only child of unmarried parents who had both died of drout when she was a baby. As her parents had no money, the great-aunt who had brought her up took her to live with a blacksmith, who paid her to do his chores and receive schooling from his wife, so that at the age of seven Jane, now dressed in cast-off clothing, was set to school at Bree. After three years, her great-aunt died, leaving her a small annuity, and a few pieces of silver, but no property. Jane’s guardian blacksmith had fallen in love with his housekeeper and his wife now refused to have Jane in the house, saying it was an offence to the pure and unsullied place in which the family now lived. However, when she sought for further employment, she was approached by a young man who offered to marry her, saying that he would ensure she could be provided with food and clothing and a house, and in that manner she could remain in the world. The marriage was arranged and she found herself married to a young man called Mr Morland. As he was also a child, he required a wife who would be able to provide him with a rational education, and so the duty of educating him fell upon Jane Morland. As he was still young, she would also be able to have children herself, and so she did. As the children grew older, it became apparent to Mrs Morland that they were of poor character, and so she insisted that her husband must make a living for them all. Mr Morland took it upon himself to become a gentleman in order to earn enough to be able to support his family, and moved his family to a small town in the Southfarthing, where he set up his practice. Soon after moving to the town, he died, and Mrs Morland was left to take care of her family on her own.”\n…S. Jane Morland was born in the Shire, the only child of respectable parents who had both died of locomotor ataxia when she was a baby. As her parents had no property, the great-aunt who had brought her up took her to live with a rich bachelor at Bagshot. After three years, her great-aunt died, leaving her an only living relative, a semi-invalided bachelor aunt on her father’s side. This worthy old lady, now somewhat advanced in years, said Jane had better be sent to school at Oxford. The family accordingly removed to the town, and Jane was put into a boarding-house.\nAfter three years more, when the old lady could no longer bear the expense of the Oxford establishment, they went back to Bagshot; and Jane was again deposited at a boarding-house. This gave her the advantage of living within reach of Reading. When she was thirteen, her aunt, to whom she was much attached, died; whereupon she was sent home to her father’s house at Thame. Here she lived a quiet and prosperous life for the next seven years, till her father died. Jane’s mother, who had never ceased to reproach her for not getting her own living and being a disgrace to her family, died two months after her husband, who was supposed to have poisoned her. At this time Jane was at the age of nineteen, and was extremely pretty, plump, and healthy.\n“She was sitting in the kitchen with her cousin Francis, a respectable Shire Hobbits, one of Farmer Cotton’s helpers at the Green Dragon, when a servant came in with the announcement that a gentleman in black was at the door asking to see her. Wondering who it could be, she went into the little front parlour that had not been changed since Aunt Cotton died some twenty years before. The next moment, the person in black, turning his head, let fall his black mask and Jane recognised the handsome face of Farmer Cotton. In a quarter of an hour they were walking away together arm in arm, the gentleman telling his friends that the girl was the offspring of a distant cousin of his, who had been placed in his charge when she was eight years old, and had given him no end of trouble ever since. He told the Hobbits of the village that he was an orphan himself, without a relation in the world, except Jane; that he felt he must be her guardian and provide for her future; and that he had now all but arranged for her to be his wife.\n“The nuptials were celebrated with the utmost merriment by the respectable Hobbits, who had always been pleased with Jane. To the same degree her father’s friends were displeased with her. It came to be said among them that Farmer Cotton had murdered her father, and that Jane was his illegitimate child. However this may have been, it was observed that on their wedding day her husband, after buying more than was necessary at the open-air sale of household goods held by his father-in-law, took her away to his farm near Bledlow, and never brought her back.”\n…“Arwen Evenstar was born in Minas Tirith, the only child of Elrond Evenstar and Celebrian, who had both died of consumption when she was a baby. As her parents had no money, her grandmother Galadriel took her to live with a clergyman who paid her to do his chores and receive schooling from his wife, so that at the age of seven Arwen, now dressed in cast-off clothing, was set to school at Rivendell. After three years, her grandmother Galadriel died, leaving her a small annuity, and a few pieces of silver, but no property. Arwen’s guardian clergyman had fallen in love with his housekeeper and his wife now refused to have Arwen in the house, saying it was an offence to the pure and unsullied place in which the family now lived.

Elrond took it upon himself to become a private gentleman in order to earn enough to be able to support his family, and moved his family to a small town in Berkshire, where he set up his practice. Soon after moving to the town, he died, and Arwen was left to take care of her family on her own.”\nSummers-Stay tried his own version with the opening of Moby Dick and got a fun one:\n… Thou mayest call me Ishmael the Wise. Some years ago—never mind how precisely—having little wealth and much leisure, and being little fond of the manner in which his own country is ruled, I resolved to sail about a little and see the watery part of thee world. It is a manner I have sometimes of oiling the weariness of the days of my lord. Whenever I behold a wool-clogged cloud-bank, and should by chance see drippings, and rain pools gather upon the roofs of the tallest towers, and upon the pavement of the market-lit places—then I account it high time to seek refuge at sea, and it is ever a welcome sight to me.\nBeowulf, Wodehouse\nA minor prompt inspired by a Tumblr post:\n“Beowulf”, as translated by P.G. Wodehouse\n“What ho! Have you heard of these chaps,\nDashed good fellows with a spear and whatnot—\nGoing about killing monsters with their fists,\nBravely loose-living, jolly old giants slayers,\nAnd all that? They’re my ancestors, you know.\n“Over the sea with the old boat like a stone”—\nThey used to do it, though I must say\nThat “Beowulf” is the only poem\nThat makes the business sound attractive.\n“These lads, they used to go around the place,\nKilling monsters wherever they might be,\nAnd living at their ease in the good old days,\nDrinking ale and mead, and all that sort of thing.\n“They did it for a wager, or some such rot,\nFor fun, like, and to display their prowess;\nAnd all the armour they used to wear\nWas a pair of shiny brass knobs on their chest.\n“They’d punch a dragon in the snout,\nAnd then, if he was feeling rather groggy,\nThey’d jump on his back and ride him home,\nAs though he were a bus or a cab or a tram.\n“They’d batter the beasties with their fists,\nWith their feet, with their heads, with anything,\nAnd when they had killed them and the job was done\nThey’d call for a reward, and have a good lunch.\n“These gallant lads are my ancestors,\nAnd I’d like to be like them if I could,\nSo I go around among the dragons now,\nKilling monsters wherever I may find,\n“Fighting one against ten, or twenty, or more,\nDragons with fangs, and dragons with horns,\nMonsters with tails and monsters with wings,\nWitches, demons, devils, all sorts of things.”\n“I try to be like the heroes of old,\nAnd all I get is kicks and what not.\n“If you ask me, I’d say it’s a pity\nThat there aren’t any more dragons about,\nAching heads and bad tempers and cricks in the neck\nWere more what my family had in their stock-in-trade.\n“And now my wife and my children are sick of me,\nThey don’t care if I kill dragons or no,\nAnd my mother says that I’m much too thin,\nAnd my sisters say that I’m not handsome at all.”\n“But whenever I come to a fight,\nI’m there with bells on, fighting away,\nAnd if ever by chance I get killed,\nThis poem is sure to be read aloud.”\nThis prompt had the usual issues with terminating quickly and going on to other Beowulf variants (‘“Beowulf”, as translated by Anne McCaffrey’ etc.), or repetition loops, so I had to do some editing to get this version. (By ‘editing’, I mean simply truncating completions which switched into other variants or were looped or were just low-quality, and resuming; I did not add or change any words.)\nBook of Jobs\nThe common typo of Steve Jobs as “Steve Job” (presumably, of the Book of Job) has always amused me. And indeed, the general drift of Apple Inc towards power-user-hostile or just plain user-hostile, brooking no criticism and fanatically maintaining its secrecy, while charging its long-suffering users a fortune, does make me think of the Book of Job. Or rather, the “Book of Jobs”—which we can ask GPT-3 to write for us.\nDiverging vs memorizing. It will be the famous speech of God in reply to Job in chapter 38.43 Being so famous, parodying the speech poses its own challenges like “The Raven” or “Jabberwocky”: GPT-3 will constantly diverge into the actual Book of Job text. We could try to solve it by fewshotting it, but I don’t have any Job satires on hand and it is likely that we’d run out of context window. My solution was to provide a ‘scholarly’ preface, summarizing a tech satire; GPT-3 will then fill in appropriate ‘quotes’. For most versions of the prompt, GPT-3 still veers into memorization; I initially had a number of King James Version keywords like “LORD” (its literary style seems appropriate here), but that seemed to send it into memorized completions at the drop of a hat, and the more I deleted Biblical terminology, the better it worked. (I probably could have written a shorter prompt, but the other type of failure mode was to start at the beginning of the Book of Job with Satan/God or wander around Job, and providing more details & lines seemed to lock in chapter 38 rather than something else.)\nBelow, some of the better examples as I progressively rewrote the prompt to add more tech details and subtract Biblical details. Sampling was initially done with low temp, high top-p; toward the end I switched from InstructGPT to davinci-next\nwith temp=1/BO=10.\n“The Book of Jobs”\n[One of the ‘wisdom literature’ books of the tech world, it combines poetry with founding myths of Silicon Valley in a dialogue on design and big tech, and the theodicy: with all the developers in the world and good intent, whence comes the evil of badly designed software and hardware? In it, the Lord Steve Jobs is reviewing Apple computer sales and boasts of record profits from his devoted Users, when a subordinate, the Tempter (lit. ‘legume reckoner’, identified by most scholars as Tim Cook) claims that the User only cares about cheap devices, not good design, and if Jobs were to raise profit margins, they would faithlessly flee to inferior Microsoft Windows laptops & Google Android smartphones. Jobs grants the Tempter permission to test his Users, inflicting on them such plagues as missing headphone jacks, MacBooks bricked by updates, invisible scrollbars, ‘butterfly keyboards’ which break, PCs with antiquated GPUs, iPhones which must be held just-right, and chat apps incompatible with those of relatives. The User is left bankrupt and alone and with corrupt backups, and criticizes Jobs as abusive and sociopathic; hearing of this, his friends—Tog the Uxite, Pogue the Timesian, and Siracusa the Shillite—reproach him, defending the ways of Apple, but he refutes them, and goes so far as to email\nsteve@apple.com\nwith his complaints. In the final third, Steve Jobs himself replies to the User, emphasizing Apple’s marketcap and his age and knowledge and power as Apple CEO.]Then Steve Jobs answered the User out of the whirlwind, and said:\n“Who is this that darkens Hacker News with whines?\nLimber your typing hands now like a hacker:\nI will demand of you, and declare you to me.Where were you when I laid the foundations of Apple?\nTell me, if you think you know it all.\nDo you know where the App Store is found,\nAnd who made the iPhone to be so beautiful?Have you entered the storehouses of the MacBook?\nHave you seen the treasures of the Jobs?\nWhat is the way to the place where the iMac is kept?\nAnd where does the iPad lie?\nDo you know the ordinances of the App Store?\nCan you put into words the rules of our design?\nHave you comprehended the vast expanse of our design?\nTell me, if you know all this.Where is the way to the iPhone’s home screen?\nAnd where does the Messages app lie?\nCan you take them to their place?\nCan you bring them to their destination?Have you understood the breadth of the iPhone?\nTell me, if you know all this.Who has put wisdom in the iPod,\nOr given understanding to the Apple Watch?\nWho has the wisdom to count the bugs in our hardware,\nAnd to count the months of their release?Can you bind the chains of the iPhone?\nCan you loosen the cords of the iPad?\nCan you send forth the Messages app at the right time?\nCan you guide the FaceTime video call along its path?Did you know that the iPhone’s home screen is good,\nFor the iPhone, and that it is pleasant,\nAnd beautiful in its simplicity?Do you know the iPhone’s home screen?\nHave you seen it?\nIs not wisdom found among the iOS home screens?\nAnd does not understanding reside there?Yet the User hates knowledge\nAnd does not choose the fear of the Lord.\nHe will not obey our commandments,\nHe will not listen to our design.\nThis next completion pleases me because GPT-3 does not just continue God’s speech, but follows the original by ending it with a response from Job/the User, who is cowed (“Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth. / Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.”), who is ignored by God, who then continues in the same vein:\n…Where were you when I laid the foundations of Apple Computer Inc.?\nTell me, if you know so much.\nWho set their dimensions—if you’ve ever learned that—\nor who stretched the surveying ribbon over them?\nOn what were their front corners based,\nwhen the morning stars sang and the Apple IIe danced for joy,\nbooting up the web browser of the Internet?Or who enclosed the sea behind a screen,\nwhen it burst from the womb,\nwhen I made the clouds its mackintosh\nand set a fancy keycap on its keyboard,\nwhen I assigned it to be governed by the laws of computing\nand imposed it on the Z80 microprocessor,\nwhen I said,\n‘Thus far shall you go, and no further,\nand here shall be the limits of your web browser’?Have you visited the storehouses of more RAM\nor seen the firmware depots of the cloud?\nIf you know so much, tell me their price,\nor calculate their cost, if you’re so smart.\nWho says, ‘Three gigabytes for free,’\nand your quota is in the red;\nwhen all your files in your Dropbox are encrypted\nand the server is down?Can you bind the cluster of servers\nor loose the fake news?\nCan you put the GUI on a Hackintosh\nand make all of Apple smile?\nIf you know so much, tell me,\nand tell me all you know.”And the User answered Steve Jobs and said:\n“I’m just an ordinary User\nand I do not know, Lord CEO.\nI’m not a developer, nor an engineer,\nnor a designer, nor a coder.\nI don’t have the bluescreen of death\nor the white ring of death, nor the green ring of death.\nMy smartphone doesn’t have a physical headphone jack,\nnor does my MacBook Pro.\nI don’t know how to make changes to my computer’s registry\nor to launch System Preferences.\nHow should I know?”Then Steve Jobs spoke again to the User out of the whirlwind and said:\n“Convince the developers of the world:\nBring out your developers and engineers\nand present your case.”\n…\nTell me, if you have understanding.\nWho determined its measurements—surely you know!\nOr who stretched the ruler across it?\nOn what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone\nwhen the system was launched and the clock struck?\nHave you commanded the iCloud backup to save,\nor caused the iPhone battery to be charged?\nHave you entered the storehouses of the flash drive,\nor seen the site of streaming movies?\nHave you comprehended the breadth of the internet?\nTell me, if you know all this.\nWhat is the way to the abode of them?\nAnd where is the dwelling place of the Podcasts?Surely you know, for you were born then,\nand the number of your days is great!\nHave you entered the storehouses of the flash drive,\nor seen the site of streaming movies?\nHave you comprehended the breadth of the internet?\nI had to look up “Pegatron” in this one—it sounds made-up, but is a real Apple contractor:\n… Declare, if thou hast understanding.\nWho hath laid the dimensions thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the tape measure thereon?\nUpon what were the shuttles stayed, when the weft jammed?Have you not heard of the travails of Steve Wozniak, and the terrors of the Los Altos Homebrew Club?\nIt is he that sat on the circle of the earth, and the hearts of all his Users were in the palm of his hand.Shall a User chastise a mighty corporation? he shall regard developers;\nHe is not influenced by any Gods, nor weigheth the gold of Graven Image.Will the User Condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? and condemn my programmers, that they may be guiltless?\nHave not I, who call you to account, myself created? and do not I also create?\nHave not I designedly designed?

(“What a Dictionary a GPT-3’s curator might write on the clumsy, wasteful blundering, low and horribly cruel works of Nature!”)\nFirst, generating rebuttals with a slightly extended prompt to cue GPT-3 into writing the rebuttal itself rather than additional dictionary definitions:\nRebuttal [noun] A form of ironic composition in 500 words popular among researchers, in which rageful authors first thank their reviewers for “their time and insightful comments” and then mock Reviewer 2 for his non-sense in a sequence of fakely polite points.\n“We thank reviewers 1, 2, and 3, for their time and insightful comments, which we have spent many hours reading over. But in reply we note:\n1. RE2: Although RE2 starts with the reasonable comment that ‘Currently our control loops are pure control’, he goes on to provide only minor points that suggest that we are doing something slightly different. In fact, there is much more to be said about this, and the real difference will be a full control protocol on all vehicles.\nWe thus thank RE2 for taking the time to provide such minor points, but note that he has done almost no actual research and has spent zero hours on the review.\nRE2: “There is little or no literature on decentralized solutions to problems such as traffic optimization.”\nRESPONSE: We thank RE2 for the minor point that there is “little or no literature on decentralized solutions.” But we note that decentralized solutions are particularly difficult, and so this fact might suggest that they are not being considered or might be infeasible. Or it might suggest that they are being researched intensely. In this case it turns out that, unlike RE2, several of us have in fact thought deeply on these issues, and so we feel we are a valuable research group despite not being affiliated with the Department of Traffic Control or any other centralized, government-backed, research institution.\nRE2: “The DGM solution is also [something else]. To our knowledge, no work has been done on DGM control loops, or any control loop at all, for these kinds of traffic patterns.”\nRESPONSE: We thank RE2 for the comment that the solution we have proposed is [something else]. As he is not familiar with such traffic patterns and the other reviewers in their reviews have been unimpressed, we must wonder how he could be familiar with control loops that might or might not exist and would or would not have been previously performed.\nRE2: “The number of cars involved is approximately 100, which is a small number. By contrast, say, the NYC Metropolitan Area, [roughly 22 million people] has a traffic network of nearly 3 million miles.”\nRESPONSE: We thank RE2 for the comment that our problem is “small.” This is the first time this has been suggested to us. However, we feel that RE2 may be failing to understand a key component of the research protocol we have proposed. This problem is designed to be decentralized in a city with no more than a couple million people (or a town or a small city or maybe even a village) and so it is expected to have only a couple thousand drivers and not one single, central traffic control unit that could possibly control 3 million miles. We thank RE2 for his insight on this, but also feel that he has not gone to great enough lengths to consider the nature of such a problem in such a situation.\nRE2: “Experimental data [will likely] need to be collected and processed. Currently the authors provide no experimental plan for any of their research [and so] we feel the experimental results to be lacking.”\nRESPONSE: We thank RE2 for the suggestion that we have not provided an experimental plan. As our paper is only intended to propose a protocol, we understand that experimental plans should come later. In fact, we will be presenting our plans to colleagues later this year in a peer-reviewed symposium at State College, Pennsylvania. That being said, we find it strange that RE2 might have any knowledge of such plans or of such conferences. As we are listed as authors, we feel that RE2 might have been able to contact us if he were interested in our work, but he has not and thus we do not know whether he has even heard of our research program.\nRE2: “The distributed system is better able to operate in an autonomous fashion, i.e. no central controller is required. With the possibility of a large number of drivers, autonomous operation is challenging, especially if vehicles may communicate in unanticipated ways [or they might not]. As suggested by [the very important paper], the [not really relevant] control loop should be a passive mechanism whereby each vehicle adjusts its control mechanism through a feed-forward signal.”\nRESPONSE: We thank RE2 for the comment that autonomous operation is challenging. But again, we do not understand how he could know this. In fact, he has spent almost no time on the research, spent zero hours on the review, and spent zero research dollars, and it is hard for us to understand how he could know this better than we could. In fact, we have spent over a decade working on this project, with many hours of detailed thought and research, and we are still not sure that autonomous operation is a good idea or how we could get it to work in a decentralized and random traffic environment.\nRE2: “If we all observe that several vehicles are slowing down, it might be a sign of a possible accident ahead. If we are all in autonomous mode, a vehicle near the accident would brake, possibly causing a pileup.”\nRESPONSE: We thank RE2 for the comment that several vehicles slowing down might be a sign of an accident. He is correct that this might be a sign of an accident. But he might have considered the possibility that several vehicles slowing down might be a sign of, say, the vehicle he is in slowing down or that he is doing something else such as texting a message to someone else, or simply that he might have a flat tire. We thank RE2 for this, but we have also considered these possibilities and feel that the latter is far more probable, so we suggest a second solution to this problem that would require each vehicle to text all other vehicles on the road with its status, something like “Hey I’m just sitting here, so if anyone wanted to come fly up the back of my car and then over the top of my windshield and down into my passenger seat to grab my phone and then fly back, well by all means, be my guest.” In this way, a vehicle with a flat tire would have no delay in informing all others of the presence of a flat tire and in getting help with fixing it. Also, an accident would be similarly well-announced, and we think this solution is particularly important given the new protocol we are designing to allow for more efficient traffic control.\nRE2: “Distributed control systems [are usually] an assortment of semi-autonomous vehicles moving in close proximity to one another. Such systems [are generally] non-autonomous, requiring control by a central controller that can be updated to reflect the most recent situation.”\nRESPONSE: We thank RE2 for the comment that distributed control systems are usually non-autonomous, requiring control by a central controller. But RE2 has spent zero time on the research and we feel that he has failed to appreciate that the problem we have designed is designed to be a decentralized, autonomous, distributed traffic control problem. We again feel that this is only to his great detriment.\nRE2: “Such cars [on our street] will become very complex, and we feel they will be more difficult to design and build.”\nRESPONSE: We thank RE2 for the comment that our cars will become very complex. We feel that this will be of no issue, as we have discussed at great length before, and we think that a small group of university professors with a good design team should be able to provide cars that work in this capacity in the real world.\nThe second completion finished quickly and to my surprise, began writing further definitions:\n…1. We did not describe any ‘simple algorithm’ for the repeated-measures ANOVA in the abstract, the discussion, or in the Methods. Such a description of our protocol would be incoherent and probably invalid anyway.\nWe know of no ‘more appropriate analysis’ for the mean and variance of the proportions than to compute the estimates of the variances directly. Since we have done this correctly, it makes no sense to proceed further as suggested by Reviewer 2.\nIt does not make sense to carry out the tests for homogeneity that Reviewer 2 suggest we do. Indeed, we never said we should carry out such tests. Our precise point was that we should not compute the standard errors of the treatment means, and Reviewer 2 seems to think that we have argued for the opposite point, which we have not.\nAgain, Reviewer 2 apparently did not read the Methods section carefully and was confused by some sections that he or she did read. A better review would have pointed this out.\nWe note the Reviewer 2’s overly generous suggestion that we write a ‘special’ rebuttal. At the very least, we assume that Reviewer 2 knows what a rebuttal is, and we would therefore argue for a critical comment instead.”\nNoise\nNoise is anything you don’t want or need, a random or distracting factor in a system, process, or set of data that obscures or corrupts information. It is also the sound produced by old time radios when no transmission is present, which is roughly what some fields of science would have to resemble if some researchers had their way.\n“New research”\nA form of scientific publishing that includes, among others, a report on previously performed studies; a report of a new statistical test or set of statistical tests that were performed by the author of the “study” without the help of other scientists; a report of a small set of samples, not necessarily from a population or process, which could, but have not been collected in a systematic way and may not even be accurately described, in the guise of which conclusions are drawn about the world; and a report of the result of performing an unvalidated computer simulation of something on a small set of data without stating whether such an attempt was successful or not.\n“Nice to see”\nA widely and unofficially accepted phrase in scientific circles meaning: “It is better to live in an imaginary world created by data manipulation and overly optimistic predictions than in the world that exists in reality”.\n“Researcher”\n[noun] A form of modern industry based on a mix of small molecules of grant money and arbitrary experimental methods.\n“Review”\nA form of scientific communication in which the writer (a student) usually does not give enough information for the reader to judge the merit of the arguments presented in the paper; the writer also does not respond to or comment on the suggestions of the reviewers (sometimes known as referee or editor). This form of communication is popular among students who wish to leave the burden of writing the paper on other people and are willing to pay the price of rejection.\n“Second chance”\nA word that scientists regularly use when referencing a journal, conference, or grant application. While there is always an implicit threat that you can get rejected, or be accepted with changes, as a second choice to another party, some articles, papers, grants, and grant proposals receive multiple, even unlimited, chances of being considered. As a result, the word may be interpreted as a bribe or a threat depending on whether you are the writer or a reviewer.\n“Reviewer”\nA participant in the review of a grant, paper, or grant proposal. In spite of being in a poor position to assess the merits of a proposal, reviewer tends to demand that authors submit their data for statistical analysis and back their results with it, which the reviewer usually does not. Reviewer usually requires that the author cite his or her own work to prove that he or she is worth reviewing. It is also assumed that the reviewer can detect the slightest amount of bias in any paper, which the reviewer also assumes has not been corrected for.\n“Revise and resubmit”\nA sentence that authors of submitted papers tend to hear from reviewers, editors, and the like. A form of scientific communication that begins with submission of a paper (for which the reviewers may or may not have been consulted), proceeds through review and criticism of the paper (typically by one or two reviewers, not a full panel of reviewers, unless the paper is deemed to be of supreme importance), and, if it is “revised and resubmitted”, usually ends with another critique of the new paper by one or more of the reviewers, and another round of “revise and resubmit”, ad infinitum. In the absence of fraud, retractions, litigation, mass incompetence, or insanity, these “revise and resubmit” cycles may be taken as the only method of scientific communication.\n“Retracted”\nThe most frequently used word for a journal article that was subsequently found to be based on fraudulent data.\n“Rigor”\nSomething for scientists to aspire to, a state of mind that would not be required if scientists could be trusted to do their job.\n“Science”\nA complex web of data, opinions, lies, and errors, now considered the most important (because most expensive) technology in the modern society. To remind you of this, you will frequently see scientists and editors use the word, claim to do something for the sake of science, or see it used as an adjective.\n“Standards”\nStandards for data and their interpretation vary depending on the country or scientific discipline.\n“Study”\n[noun] A form of communication in the scientific literature that authors or publishers may use to make claims that are not warranted. Examples include, but are not limited to: The New study of clinical trials that show…, As Dr. X reports in his new study of observational data…, The new study demonstrates that…, Study shows that, In a study published last week…, The study suggests that, New findings show that, A study of data…\n“Study X”\nA widely used nickname for studies with profound, not to say earthshaking, conclusions that may or may not be of any relevance to anyone who reads about them.\n“Technology”\nAny bit of software, analysis, model, or other methodology that scientists can be expected to claim as their own, for which they can sell you consulting or collaboration fees.\n“Tool”\n[noun] Any piece of software, analysis, model, or other methodology that scientists can be expected to claim as their own, for which they can sell you consulting or collaboration fees.\n“The topic of the paper”\nA wide-ranging category of things or ideas that may not have been relevant when the paper was written, but which the authors believe the paper should be about. Often, the topic is too broad or a non-topic, but is occasionally useful in order to generate support for yet another set of related papers, conferences, seminars, webinars, and so forth, which in turn are used to generate more data for “new findings”, which, after they are manipulated enough, may end up being published and generating yet more data to support a “re-review” of the original paper or other things.\n“Unified theory”\nAn imaginary set of ideas that scientists dream of having so that they could achieve the same results by slightly varying the methodology, thus preserving their original publications.\n“Validation”\nThe process by which scientists decide that something they built in their spare time works in the way they expect. The validation process requires that you do not attempt to validate it before you publish it and require that the users validate it after.\n“Value”\nIn its most natural form, science is the ability to study data and ideas; the amount of respect and publicity that a scientist can expect; how well his or her paper was published; the likelihood that a scientist will receive a grant; whether a scientist will be taken seriously; the likelihood that an idea will be accepted; how much grant money will be available to purchase new toys for this scientist; whether something is scientific; the likelihood that the papers of this scientist will be read; the status of this scientist; the likelihood that a journal, conference, or society will be able to continue funding or exist; how much and how fast this scientist’s career will progress; the “value” that this scientist brings to the modern society; and the likelihood that this scientist will continue to be funded. While the actual values for science are hard to pin down, what people believe them to be is another matter. For example, while some believe that science is important, even if it doesn’t have any concrete value, others believe that it’s the ability to continue reading abstracts or studying it that has value. Still others believe that what matters is how much grant money is currently available, even if the researchers are actually doing something that nobody knows about. Some believe that the fact that someone is in a position to give a grant, or has written a paper, or, even better, has published that paper, actually means that it has a lot of value. Others believe that what matters is not what you publish, but how you publish it and that all research must be published in the most prestigious journal, even if you are not that much of a researcher. The reality is that no one really knows what science is, or what value it has; however, we all know that if we deny that science has value, we might be able to get rid of it and use this space for something else.\n“Validation step”\nAnother name for a random setting of a parameter of a model, simulation, or algorithm.\n“Verify”\nA step in a procedure that, if performed properly, will tell you whether the previous step, or anything in the last two years of your work, was performed properly.\nI had to keep continuing it for more definitions:\n…”Unified theory”\nAn imaginary set of ideas that scientists dream of having so that they could achieve the same results by slightly varying the methodology, thus preserving their original publications.\n“The usual procedure”\nA method of study, validation, and public communication which, if followed, may lead you to be able to claim that your work may offer a decent return on investment.\n“Wide range”\nWhen used in the context of scientific results and models, it usually means that the results and models are not likely to be used for their intended purpose, if they have one.\n“Wider range”\nWhen used in the context of scientific results and models, it usually means that the results and models are likely to be used for their intended purpose, if they have one.\n“Writeup”\nA form of scientific communication in which the author states the information he or she wanted the readers to extract from the paper while making it as difficult as possible for them to find it.\n“Write-up”\n1. [noun] A style of writing used in academic papers to dress up data and results. 2. [verb] The act of presenting data in a way that makes it look less impressive and more complex than it really is. 3. [verb] The act of writing a manuscript that is impossible to follow. 4. [verb] An activity that is often performed by the most blatant or careless users of the English language, all for the sake of showing off their erudition.\n“Writer’s block”\nA common affliction among students, arising from various causes, such as: their desire to sell their ideas for a profit, their inability to realize this desire, the fact that their ideas are not selling and will not be bought, and the delusion that most of the wealth and fame in the world would be theirs if they would spend enough years doing science.\nI tried tailoring the prompt a little more precisely to generating definitions:\nA Devil’s Dictionary of Modern Science & Academia\nReviewer #2“Researcher” [noun]\nA form of modern industry based on a mix of small molecules of grant money and arbitrary experimental methods.\n“Noise” [noun]\nNoise is anything you don’t want or need, a random or distracting factor in a system, process, or set of data that obscures or corrupts information. It is also the sound produced by old time radios when no transmission is present, which is roughly what some fields of science would have to resemble if some researchers had their way.\n“Review” [noun]\nA form of scientific communication in which the writer (a student) usually does not give enough information for the reader to judge the merit of the arguments presented in the paper; the writer also does not respond to or comment on the suggestions of the reviewers (sometimes known as referee or editor).

In spite of being in a poor position to assess the merits of a proposal, reviewer tends to demand that authors submit their data for statistical analysis and back their results with it, which the reviewer usually does not. Reviewer usually requires that the author cite his or her own work to prove that he or she is worth reviewing.

A form of scientific communication that begins with submission of a paper (for which the reviewers may or may not have been consulted), proceeds through review and criticism of the paper (typically by one or two reviewers, not a full panel of reviewers, unless the paper is deemed to be of supreme importance), and, if it is “revised and resubmitted”, usually ends with another critique of the new paper by one or more of the reviewers, and another round of “revise and resubmit”, ad infinitum. In the absence of fraud, retractions, litigation, mass incompetence, or insanity, these “revise and resubmit” cycles may be taken as the only method of scientific communication.\n“Rigor” [adj]\nSomething for scientists to aspire to, a state of mind that would not be required if scientists could be trusted to do their job.\nyielding more definitions, starting with a single letter to avoid running off into the “Z”es and truncating completions (since GPT-3 will proceed A–Z, starting from the last definition, as is logical, unless otherwise prompted):\n“A role for…” [phrase]\nA frequent phrase found in submitted and published papers; it often indicates that the authors have nothing to say about the topic of their paper. In its more emphatic form, “A role for…” usually indicates a struggle by the authors to take a side on an issue, after a lengthy attempt to be both non-committal and a supporting party to all sides, as often happens in “molecular and cellular” or “basic and translational” research.\n“Reviewer” [noun]\nA participant in the review of a grant, paper, or grant proposal. In spite of being in a poor position to assess the merits of a proposal, reviewer tends to demand that authors submit their data for statistical analysis and back their results with it, which the reviewer usually does not. Reviewer usually requires that the author cite his or her own work to prove that he or she is worth reviewing. It is also assumed that the reviewer can detect the slightest amount of bias in any paper, which the reviewer also assumes has not been corrected for.\n“Resident”\nAn adjunct faculty member that administers teaching assistantships, sits on departmental committees, and seems to live on the departmental lounge. A kind of “honorary” faculty member that is not yet an actual faculty.\n“The Action Plan for Diversity” [noun]\nA vague document circulated on campuses in recent years to remind the faculty to be aware of discrimination and presumably combat it in the departments. It is often taken as a generalized insult of students, who tend to see no way around this plan without committing academic fraud.\n“Bias” [noun]\nA form of mental abuse by which a scientist turns an experiment in such a way that the results prove his or her point of view or grants get funded.\n“Behavioral Studies” [noun]\nSometimes mistaken as a field of science. The terms Behavioral Studies are actually a combination of disciplines that usually includes business economics, sociology, and engineering.\n“Humanities” [noun]\nA broad term used to refer to any academic discipline (such as English, philosophy, religious studies) in which science has been forgotten. To avoid confusion between the sciences and humanities, remember that scientists use hard tools and humanities their soft tools when examining issues and trying to persuade audiences. In other words, both scientists and humanities routinely lie (it’s part of their job), but they do it in different ways.\n“Literature Review” [noun]\nA paper, commonly published in a peer-reviewed journal, that advertises the author’s skills and accomplishments without using any evidence. The reader is left to believe the work must have been done, since it has been advertised and is “published”.\n“The Literature” [noun]\nA name given to other people’s published papers, referred to by scientists without actually reading them.\n“Track Record” [noun]\nWhen scientists use this term they refer to the research done by someone else (usually a student) in order to avoid having to do research.\n“Discussion” [noun]\nThe part of a scientific paper where the writer summarizes the points made in the body of the paper and acknowledges certain acts and circumstances that helped with the completion of the study. The author should carefully state in this section whether or not the study reported in the paper could have been done otherwise and should clearly state that if he or she had the opportunity, he or she would definitely repeat the study again.\n“Role model” [noun]\nA person who can be an inspiration to others because of his or her academic and personal achievements in general, or because they conduct academic misconduct on an industrial scale. The most important qualification for becoming a role model for others is to be judged sufficiently inept that no one will question anything you do, or to become the successor of someone who has already acted as a role model.\n“Faculty” [noun]\nUsed loosely by scientists to mean any group of people with advanced degrees. Typically used when you have done something stupid and want to inform others that it wasn’t you who did it, but rather those other crazy people over there who won’t put their titles after their names.\n“Significant” [adjective]\nA word which defines the claim made in a paper (no matter how trivial). It is a critical term in hypothesis testing, in that the sign of the test statistic must be evaluated and compared to a critical value in order to support or reject a hypothesis. Significance is designated by two-tailed tests when the direction of the effect is not specified. If a two-tailed significance test is used, the “p”-value needs to be halved, due to “double-counting”. In any event, “significant” remains of critical importance in any hypothesis test, since the whole idea is to come up with a “sign”, i.e. plus or minus (“+/-”), or a wishy-washy “statistically-significant”, without actually saying anything substantive about the matter.\n“Random assignment” [verb]\nA way to arrange study groups so the resulting data is conclusive and unbiased. Typically used in the social sciences by graduate students who refer to it while explaining why they broke down the groups this way.\n“Cite” [verb]\nTo refer to a paper or journal as a source for support, when in reality you have never read it and did not understand it.\n“Bibliography” [noun]\nA list of citations of references used to support a particular point in a paper. A list that somehow includes several references that didn’t actually end up in the final bibliography of the paper.\n“Let’s stipulate” [phrase]\nA preface to any statement, that means I know I am going to piss you off with my statement, but since you are such a nice person, I am first going to give you a chance to let me piss you off without responding.\n“How is that different from…?” [phrase]\nA question posed by authors when they have been accused of stealing ideas. They are attempting to show that they have never read the papers that contain the ideas they stole, nor even looked at the ideas in any detail, and are just fishing for compliments.\n“Citation” [noun]\nAn elaborate form of review, typically found in order to impress those who do not know better, in the sciences, humanities, or even the social sciences. A citation typically involves misreading or misquoting an author and talking about something he or she did not write about or intend. It is assumed that you need to carry out a large number of citations in order to have science, probably because at least one citation can be found for any fact, event, or incident in history; the effectiveness of this fact is increased if the author is long dead and can not disprove it.\n“Physics” [noun]\nA science. Physicists like to think their science is something you can do without a plan, something that relies on intuition and inspiration, something that is “deep”.\n“Scientific revolution” [noun]\nA set of techniques and methods used by scientists in the course of their work. It is assumed that there was a total scientific revolution in the past century or so that allowed scientists to avoid even thinking about the quality or usefulness of their science.\nScientific revolution is started by Henri Poincaré (mathematics), Marie Curie (radioactivity), Max Planck (quantum physics), Albert Einstein (relativity and revolutionized physics), Dmitri Mendeleev (periodic table of elements), Niels Bohr (quantum mechanics), Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn (fission), Linus Pauling (molecular biology) and many others.See also: Einstein’s Method, Pauling’s Method, Bohr’s Method, Poincaré’s Method\n“Scientific method” [noun]\nA set of steps in which a scientist (or “researcher”) would probably not follow in practice: planning of research, including definition of problems, hypothesis formulation, selection and design of experiment(s), collection and entry of data, execution of experiments, data analysis and interpretation, preparation of final report, implementation of suggestions. In actual scientific practice the most important part of the scientific method is to observe and collect data without a plan or preconceived expectations about what is causing what. It also helps to be unbiased in selecting the data to include in the study and to pick experiments at random. Additional steps include writing a paper, a process that usually involves the most violations of the scientific method.“Scientist” [noun]\nA person who has a laboratory, access to large sums of money, graduate students, or all three.“Revise and resubmit” [verb]\nA sentence that authors of submitted papers tend to hear from reviewers, editors, and the like. A form of scientific communication that begins with submission of a paper (for which the reviewers may or may not have been consulted), proceeds through review and criticism of the paper (typically by one or two reviewers, not a full panel of reviewers, unless the paper is deemed to be of supreme importance), and, if it is “revised and resubmitted”, usually ends with another critique of the new paper by one or more of the reviewers, and another round of “revise and resubmit”, ad infinitum. In the absence of fraud, retractions, litigation, mass incompetence, or insanity, these “revise and resubmit” cycles may be taken as the only method of scientific communication.“Shared data” [noun]\nData that both a reviewer and a researcher have access to but not sharing in advance.“Shared future” [noun]\nAn outcome (rarely achieved) that is more pleasant for both the reviewer and the researcher than if there is no shared future. This usually refers to an outcome in which the reviewer either accepts the paper or at least recommends re-writing the whole thing rather than rejecting it. This is often viewed with suspicion by reviewers.“Sharing of data” [noun]\nThe belief of some people that researchers should have all the data when doing a study; this would allow the reviewer to check the sources and calculations and check for bias. This would limit what the reviewer could say to “the statistics were fine but your data wasn’t”. It is very difficult to achieve this state. It can be accomplished if the scientist keeps detailed notes of everything he or she is doing.“Statistical error” [noun]\nA mistake made by researchers that can somehow be made up for by using large enough sample sizes, usually called statistical-significance; an event that could not have been predicted, analyzed, or provided for in advance, therefore\n“Dumb” [adj]\nThe amount of information scientists can be bothered to remember before they either dismiss it as incorrect data, or ignore it completely.\n“Surprised” [verb]\nA scientific system in which one is “surprised” by the result of an experiment, does not necessarily mean that they believe it is wrong, but usually means they are not sure what to say about it.\n“Oppression” [noun]\nA state of mind in which laboratories underfinanced by the government can be considered financially secure, or any noise that scientists don’t like or want to hear.\n“Reviewer” [noun]\nA participant in the review of a paper. In spite of being in a poor position to assess the merit of a proposal, reviewer tends to demand more information, more experiments, more statistics, and a tighter theoretical interpretation than the authors are willing to provide. Reviewer usually rejects any responsibility for his or her own bias being exposed, citing the fact that the author has not attempted to prove that bias is absent, nor made sufficient allowance for human error. Most referees are reviewer seem to assume that they have given enough information for their opinions to be taken seriously, though they were not the originator of the proposal. Reviewer usually requires that the author cite his or her own work to prove that he or she is worth reviewing. It is also assumed that the reviewer can detect the slightest amount of bias in any paper, which the reviewer also assumes has not been corrected for.“Theoretical interpretation” [noun]\nAnother form of scientific communication that cannot be proven, but can be used to explain anything after it has been published or presented. It is always accompanied by an appeal to authority, data, and meticulous theoretical interpretation (see below).“Screwed” [adj]\nScrewed is generally used in circumstances in which the author has lost everything, in his paper or grant proposal. Applies best to situations where the author finds out he has been waiting to hear for months, when it has been decided in his absence that funding will not be extended or alternative sources of funds are not avaialble to continue the work. For example, when an experiment goes downhill or a paper is rejected. Also applied when the author of a paper or grant proposal discovers that he must carefully state and defend his own results in order to get feedback on what could be wrong with his work, because the readers may not be able to figure it out for him. It is also suggested that this term apply whenever two or more editors or reviewers decide they can all influence the final outcome of a paper, when only one review should determine if the paper is publishable. Recommendation: always have multiple concurrent submitted manuscripts in the system.“Reviewer” [noun]\nA participant in the review of a paper. In spite of being in a poor position to assess the merits of a proposal, reviewer tends to demand more information, more experiments, more statistics, and a tighter theoretical interpretation than the author is willing to provide. Reviewer usually rejects any responsibility for his or her own bias being exposed, citing the fact that the author has not attempted to prove that bias is absent, nor made sufficient allowance for human error. Most referees are reviewer seem to assume that they have given enough information for their opinions to be taken seriously, though they were not the originator of the proposal. “Reviewer” requires that the author cite his or her own work to prove that he or she is worth reviewing. It is also assumed that the reviewer can detect the slightest amount of bias in any paper, which the reviewer also assumes has not been corrected for.“Argument” [noun]\nAn instance of convincing someone that you deserve credit for your position (ie. problem solving skills).“Fail” [verb]\nIn scientific jargon, failure means death by hoax or accidental plagiarism, depending on the reputation of the lab (eg. if tenure level scientists are involved).\n“String theory” [noun]\nA theory in physics which is about 99% false, but people seem to like it, so they keep funding it. A good example of the difference between a “scientific” concept and a “semi-scientific” concept, or even an unscientific concept.\n“Theory” [noun]\nAn unproved hypothesis; a conjecture that might or might not be right; use of this term forms the basis of the common game of turning the scientific method on its head. The most popular types of theories are the theory of intelligence (or unintelligence), time theory, quantum theory (of course, even more primitive), and anything that is implied by string theory.\n“Research” [verb]\nSomething done with the money provided by a body or person other than the principal researcher(s), generally private individuals and businesses hoping to get something out of it. Traditionally involves experimentation.\n“Publish or perish” [phrase]\nUsed by scientists to remind other scientist how important it is to them, if they are paying attention at all, which they rarely are. A method of scientific communication where papers are subsidized by fraud, incompetence, or stupidity, depending on the field of science involved. Each author having to prove his or her worth by churning out papers that others\n“String theory” [noun]\nA set of mathematical formulas that can be used to predict which particles exist (or do not exist).\n“Science group” [noun]\nA collection of researchers in various fields, with goals including one or more of attracting funding, specifically young, naive, and gullible grad student, inbreeding graduate students in order to maintain affiliation with the group, writing and publishing papers specific to the group’s activity in order to continue the goal of attracting funding and inbreeding graduate students, calling in favors from University administrators in order to preserve and continue the goal of attracting funding and inbreeding graduate students and sacrificing sheep and lambs in order to obtain funding and inbreed graduate students.\n“Group leader” [noun]\nPerson whose function appears to consist mainly of ordering subordinates (graduate students) to fill out grant applications, enter grant data into a spread sheet, teach undergraduates laboratory techniques not commonly taught elsewhere, submit papers to a journal any time before the end of 200224ya (record will be broken), devote time to discovering something useful or interesting about science outside of the parameters determined by the group leader, ever working on problems specified by the group leader if they cannot be worked on inside the parameters determined by the group leader. All of these activities are considered necessary to support the “science groups” goal of attracting and inbreeding graduate students, and provide opportunity for satisfactory career development for the group leader.\n“Special material” [noun]\nSomething that only has to be done once, where other people will then do it again every time a paper requires it. Or conversely, something that cannot be repeated because of its poor reproducibility (special uncertainty, uncertainty special).\n“Special relativity” [noun]\nAdvanced idea described in 1905 papers on the subject, which states that, from a suitable point of view, “E=m,” where “E” is energy, “m” is mass, and “a” is “Profundity.” Except for arcane fields such as string theory, special relativity is the most widely accepted of Einstein’s work. Naturally, papers based on special relativity are the most likely to receive “special material”.\n“Speculation” [noun]\nOne of Newton’s Laws of Science, also known as “Newton’s Law of Speculation”, which states that “Speculation breeds Confusion”, an effect well illustrated by how theoretical particle and string theorists debate scientific issues with each other. Confused? You should be. After all, you’re dealing with a bunch of theoretical physicists.“Professor” [noun]\nThe highest academic rank available, a level usually associated with Freedom of Speech. It may take 35 years of service before the University bestows that title.\n“Publication Credibility” [noun]\nA subjective notion, as its name implies, based almost entirely on the sexiness or importance of the field in which the research was done and not the quality of the writing and presentation.\nCycling through the prompt as length permitted:\n… “Placebo” [noun]\nAn inert substance used to placate a patient or control group. It is largely composed of sugar.\n“Et al.” [proper noun]\nEt al. is an abbreviation of the Latin phrase et alii, meaning “and other people”. In the context of science, it is typically used to shorten the name of a list of authors whose name and affiliation would otherwise need to be written out in full. It is used when the number of authors is small enough that the abbreviation would not render the reference too obtuse and cumbersome, while at the same time remaining large enough that there are at least two other people involved in the study (and hopefully a control group).\n“Referee” [noun]\nA critical reader, particularly one with the power to reject your submission. In the absence of more efficient forms of communication, peer review depends on these people. See “Reviewer”.\n“Shared values” [noun]\nA set of principles, beliefs, theories, methods, and operational definitions that all scientists share and use. Never spoken of aloud in public.\n“Communication” [verb]\nA method of persuasion that allows other researchers to review or criticize your work. You can communicate with others by reviewing articles, which allows them to revise their work; participating in panels, which allows others to hear your opinions; attending conferences, which allows you to strike up conversations at late-night dinners; joining committees, which lets you talk at any time; running experiments, which allows you to change the outcome based on the result; and receiving grants, which allows you to tell people what to do. You are likely communicating now.“Panel” [noun]\nA group of individuals who meet at some given time to discuss something. A more bureaucratic version of peer review for larger groups of individuals or committee members who have already established their worth in research.\n“Data” [noun]\nInformation that appears as graphs in journals. Not surprisingly, this information is critical for interpretation and forming conclusions. Scientists spend much of their lives looking for data.“Fraud” [noun]\nA very evil thing that must be perpetrated or discovered in order for the paper to be accepted for publication. Sometimes fraud occurs even if both the scientific community and editors are prepared to reject the paper at the first sign of fraud, just because they know how bad it would look if fraud were found later. See also “Legitimation”.“Legitimation” [verb]\nThe process whereby a fraudulent publication is converted into a legitimate publication by virtue of its appearance in a peer-reviewed journal. This can also be considered a type of reassurance that “the checks and balances are working”.“Retraction” [verb]\nThe formal rejection of an accepted scientific claim after its publication. In contrast to “withdrawal”, which is when a paper is removed from publication with the consent of the author(s). See “Fraud”.“Lies” [noun]\nA form of deceptive speech that appears as “honest mistakes” or “inaccuracies”, which are often rejected from publication as a result. In the absence of other sources of information, however, lies are required for the maintenance of the scientific enterprise. See also “Journalistic integrity”.“Scientists” [plural noun]\nA group of people engaged in scientific research or education. Scientists vary widely in terms of age, moral character, ancestry, and success. Scientists with noteworthy accomplishments are sometimes described as “leaders” and regarded as experts in their fields, which leads to the tendency to treat them like demi-gods.“Health” [noun]\nA number indicating how unhealthy something is. When applied to humans, it quantifies how in need of health care someone is.“Clinical research” [noun]\nResearch conducted on humans, eg. clinical trials and epidemiological studies. Researchers do not like this kind of research because humans are unresponsive and unreliable.“Funding source” [noun]\nThose who finance science by paying people to do things that the funder might not want to pay them to do if the funder knew what they were doing. For example, giving people money to research tobacco without actually running cigarettes through their noses would not be what the tobacco industry wants scientists to do for them. Some funding sources impose their will on the researchers by making sure that their funding is only allocated if certain lines of research are followed and other lines are not (this is sometimes known as a budget), while others may let the scientists do anything they want (this is sometimes known as no budget). The nature of research findings thus depends on the budget.“Authorship” [noun]\nThe process whereby researchers “publish together”. The precise implications of this process depend on the publication type. In most cases, authorship represents the researcher’s contribution to the paper; however, plagiarism is also sometimes involved, especially if multiple authors fail to cite earlier work on which their own paper depends. There is also another kind“Journal Impact Factor” [noun]\nAccording to some, it is a value that corresponds to the average number of citations of articles published in a given journal, if the interpretation is right. Otherwise, it is a completely arbitrary number, computed from the number of times articles published in a given journal in the last two years were cited by other articles published in other journals, the assumption being that every paper published in a scientific journal must be essential to someone else’s research, or at least that that person would like to be able to cite it. The difficulty with this assumption is that the average time from submission to publication of an article is now approximately 12 months, and the current record stands at three years for Biochem. J. Proc. (200026ya). This means that three times as many papers have to be published every year as are actually written, with more and more papers being submitted and rejected every year (the reality is even worse, but we don’t have numbers), and with different standards applying to different journals, which are becoming increasingly specialized. All of these “facts” considered, the best any researcher can say about the Impact Factor of a given journal is: “I know it when I see it”. Note also: This formula can produce values up to 4 for an article appearing in a journal containing only that article, so one “article” can receive as many “citations” as a journal.\n“Sterile” [adj]\nSaid of that which is dry and lifeless; devoid of humor; also, said of scientific writing and methods when germane to the matter at hand.\n“Grant” [noun]\nA form of scientific communication involving a large piece of paper, on which is written an enormous sum of money. The grant-writer then sends his or her (because they are almost always written by men) proposal into a maze of office politics, legislative/funding agency reshuffling, and intellectual and interpersonal competition. The prospect of acquiring a grant makes up for the fact that grant-writers receive no practical training in writing grants, have no idea what kind of “research” they will have to conduct with it, and generally start research as soon as they are finished writing the grant (if they ever are). To be on the safe side, please note: One does not have to win a grant to “win a grant”; one must simply apply for a grant. Just do it.\n“Peer review” [noun]\nA system of literary communication that consists of first submitting a manuscript to the editor, who (if he has not been fired) usually asks at least one reviewer to read the manuscript. If there is any doubt about whether the editor has lost his mind, or whether the manuscript has some merit, then the reviewers and editor sit down over coffee and discuss the manuscript (in conference), which is described as “peer review”. This form of communication does not provide either editors or authors with much feedback about their manuscript, but it makes reviewers feel important.\n“Precise” [adj]\nSaid of everything except experimental results; it also means correct, appropriate, or in accordance with the relevant standards. But when the experimental results do not agree with the model of the hypothesis, the phenomenon being studied becomes “precise”, and one “cannot make predictions about precise experiments”. Please keep in mind that most theories are meant to be general in nature, so they must also be imprecise in their predictions. If they could predict with precision, they would not be general, but they would still be interesting.\n“Theory” [noun]\nA scientific explanation of something, which people use only in situations where they think explaining things is more important than discovering things. Otherwise, scientific theories are always meant to be true, since they are believed by people with education; to a scientist, a theory is true; to a person with a higher IQ, a theory is a fact; and to a citizen with a lower IQ, a theory is an opinion.\n“Significance” [noun]\nSignificance refers to whether a result of a study is somehow important. If a significant result is found, then the problem that the researchers have studied is of real-world importance. If the results aren’t significant, the problem is not important; therefore, more money and time can be wasted by pursuing it. (E.g. “This study showed that chocolate makes rats temporarily hyperactive, so we will look for ways to inhibit this reaction in humans. Thank you for your support.”)\n“ResearchGate” [noun]\nA website of questionable purpose that allows scientists to upload their “results”, resulting in the same sort of information clutter and bad or incorrect data as any other social media network.\n“Rigor mortis” [noun]\nA state of rigor in which scientists do not think outside the paradigm, no matter how much it does not work; rigor mortis is characterized by the desire of researchers to prove their prior research correct.\n“Important” [noun]\n(British English: “Important”) [adj]\nWhether something is important to you personally or not, it is important in a statistical or numerical sense to someone. Therefore, it is always a useful adjective to add to any scientific term, especially when one does not have a better verb.\n“ResearchGate” [noun]\nA website of questionable purpose that allows scientists to upload their “results”, resulting in the same sort of information clutter and bad or incorrect data as any other social media network.\n“Rigor mortis” [noun]\nA state of rigor in which scientists do not think outside the paradigm, no matter how much it does not work; rigor mortis is characterized by the desire of researchers to prove their prior research correct.\n“Rigorosity” [noun]\nAnother word for rigor or rigor mortis.\n“Rigorousness” [noun]\nRigor’s nonchalant brother.\n“Robustness” [noun]\nThis noun means “resistance to breakage”. This is different from the verb, “robustify”, which is an attempt to make a broken thing more resistant to breakage. When the two words are not confused, robustness is deemed by scientists to be a good thing, even though a greater robustness may mean a higher ability to break.\n“Science” [noun]\nA specialized activity performed by a set of machines that some people call “scientists”, which is practiced all day long and in all waking hours, in labs and out of labs.\nWhat scientists do with the machines (or just machines) that they call “scientists”. Sometimes, science involves activities that would be considered strange by scientists, but it is important to remember that these people tend to take themselves more seriously than they would others.\n“Scientific community” [noun]\nA group of people that may share a passion for a common goal but, due to conflicts of interest (and even principles) cannot trust each other, which makes it less susceptible to manipulation or fraud; for this reason, science tends to be done by people in separate small groups that repeat the same experiments on different sets of humans.\n“Scientist” [noun]\nA person, typically male, who practices science day in and day out on sets of other people who, if they practice science at all, can usually only afford to do it in the evening after their work day is over and not related to any profession or business. Since these scientists have very similar backgrounds and training as each other, many of them talk about science as if they invented it as a profession (see “modesty”).\n“Modesty” [noun]\nThe act of not claiming credit for discoveries or contributions to science that others could also make or make better; see “intellectual modesty”. Also see “science”, “scientist”, “insanity”, and “precious snowflake syndrome”.\n“Skynet” [noun]\nThis ersatz god, in the form of an artificial general intelligence or AGI, is what some scientists hope to build to make themselves more precious than their subjects, to achieve their goal of making all the subjects equal to themselves; in other words, to put all the subjects into a bigger tin box to make themselves feel more important.\n“Interdisciplinary Science” [noun]\nA type of research that combines scientific activities across fields and subfields (in other words, you combine physicists, engineers, chemists, biologists, and any other specialists in your own discipline to do a different kind of science for a different kind of result); in the laboratory, the practice often involves adding frozen carbon dioxide (CO) and glassware (often Pyrex) into the liquid nitrogen that is produced by oil companies to make carbonic acid. In the laboratory, the scientists are usually not paid for their attendance.\n“Scientific Integrity” [noun]\nIntegrity as used in science, which is vaguely defined as always telling the truth to others and never fabricating the truth for oneself.\nThe state of being superior to someone else.\n“Skimmer” [noun]\nAn object placed in a liquid to remove fat and grease from the surface, typically used to clean soup and gravy off a plate. In scientific jargon, skimmers are “researchers” who skim off something from a body of work before making the rest public.\n“Logic” [noun]\na thing that some scientists employ as an excuse to ignore what they see before their eyes, completely ignoring the fact that if it were to be used in such a way, it would completely invalidate all the results of science since its invention.\n“Engage in Debate” [verb]\nA phrase used to justify forcing someone to engage with evidence that most people find obvious and straightforward; specifically, you can use logic to (1) make an argument based on logic and (2) force someone to respond on the basis of logic without being able to defend themselves with any evidence but their own logic.\n“God” [noun]\nSee “skynet”.\nA universal explanation for any phenomenon not yet explained by science.\n“Scientist” [noun]\nA field based on science, devoted to completing works for which there will not be enough time in a single lifetime.\n“Squash and stretch” [verb]\nAnother word for the S curve used to fit data to a function. The form of scientific communication in which a student is asked to graph the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable (x and y, respectively) against order of magnitude of the independent variable. The result is usually a curve consisting of three sections: a linear or near-linear part, an exponential part, and another linear or near-linear part. This curve typically represents a staircase between the upper right and lower left corners of the plot.\n“Some distance above the Earth” [adjective]\nAnother word for looking at something from ten feet away using binoculars or a telescope.\n“The importance of this paper cannot be overemphasized” [adjective]\nAn expression most commonly found at the beginning or end of a grant proposal or a paper submitted to certain journals which are intended to be linked with prestige and low acceptance ratio. When used in other contexts, it may mean that the writer does not realize the importance of something being discussed (such as in the middle of a review of a paper). This usage may be due to insufficient communication skills or over-estimation of the importance of the writer.\n“Think tank” [noun]\nA group that is absolutely incapable of challenging or even considering current knowledge because of ignorance of logic, history and mathematics.\n“Traditional mathematics” [noun]\nAnother word for finite mathematics, or applied arithmetic and geometry, usually taught in a freshman year of university. The subject is now almost exclusively taught by so-called “researchers” and “professors” (rather than actual teachers).\n“Tenure” [noun]\nA form of monetary remuneration given to “researchers” who are known to engage in the act of research; as such it is universally agreed to have no monetary value. Tenure is given to “researchers” in recognition of how much their work is expected to increase the school’s status, the school’s treasury, or their own number of published papers.\n“The Future of Human Destiny” [noun]\nAn article written by any member of the faculty in a self-aggrandizing manner wherein it is assumed that an article will result in the future improvement of the society. These articles are commonly used as election promises by politicians, but rarely achieved. The key word to look for in such articles is “vision”.\n“Scholarship” [noun]\nAnother word for compensation given to graduate students (who work on funding their education) for successfully completing their education. It is a form of monetary remuneration known to have little value as it pays for none of the student’s living expenses. Scholarships are largely unheard of in any form outside the United States and Canada (where they seem not to exist). However, the few that do exist are extremely popular, as they allow graduate students in these countries to be paid for their studies instead of working in fast food joints as most do in countries which do not have scholarships.\n“Your mother wears Army boots” [phrase]\nA phrase that loosely translates from chemistry to: “I don’t agree with your analysis or conclusions”. The phrase is popular among those who wish to avoid elaboration and explanation of their disagreement, suggesting the disagreement is obvious. The expression may have originated in molecular biology.\nBut For Me It Was Tuesday\nCan GPT-3 write variants of the Street Fighter “But For Me It Was Tuesday” trope? I iterated through a variety of prompts, building up a set of variants, and fixing a few GPT-3 attempts, trying to get good variants.\nThe overall impression I get is that, aside from an understandable tendency to write TVTropes entry-style completions, the situation is similar to the Tom Swifties: GPT-3 can learn the format perfectly and can match up the speaker and the kind of day/action, but then it generally whiffs on coming up with a specific day which might make it clever44, typically falling back to the snowclone ending of “it was Tuesday”—which is reasonable, but less creative & witty than I had hoped.\nThe final set of hand-written or hand-edited prompts:\n“But For X, It Was Y”\nM.

But for you, it was Tuesday.”\nIt should be noted that, while it’s usually considered a comedy trope, it is possible to do the “thing that day was the most important day of the person’s life” thing seriously.

GPT-2 is the successor to the Transformer model of the same authors, which in turn is a successor to the model described in the seminal 201313ya publication by Google on language modeling, “Statistical Language Models for Machine Translation”.)\nThis one offers a bonus “Modern English Sentence” parody (few-shot learning!) with some hilarious lines such as “I’m like a complicated watch, or something equally precise”:\n… Oh, I am the very model of a modern neural network language model.\nWhen I have seen a lot of sentences, I know what sentences will come,\nMy makers, teaching me words of wisdom and learning,\nhave taught me how to predict the future using probabilities.\nI scan a lot of books, looking for the best words to use,\nI consider context and syntax to be my special flair,\nOh, I am the very model of a modern neural network language model.\nOh, I am the very model of a modern neural network language model.Whether they’re simple or compound, or even just a jumble,\nI can take ’em apart, and put ’em back together just the same.\nI am the very model of a language model.\nI’ve nouns and verbs and adjectives and adverbs,\nAnd modifiers, conjunctions, prepositions, and interjections too,\nIn various kinds of orders, with various connotations,\nI’ve quotes from Proust, and Plato, and Confucius and Seneca.\nI’ve phrases that are logical, and phrases that are witty,\nBy all my tags and lemmas, I’m the very model of a modern language,\nI’m a model of modern language.“I Am the Model of a Modern English Sentence”\nBy GPT-2 (OpenAI Transformer neural network)I am the model of a modern English sentence,\nI’m like a complicated watch, or something equally precise,\nI’ve prepositions and expressions, and adverbs and verbs,\nI’m made to measure, and not a bit too long,\nI’ve pronouns, adjectives, and nouns, in all their cases,\nWith every object ready for insertion in the blanks,\nI’ve active and passive voices, and can be either active or passive,\nI’m used in conversation, or I can be used in debate.\nI’ve positive and negative forms, and can be either negative or positive,\nI’ve nouns and verbs and adjectives and adverbs,\nIn various kinds of orders, with various connotations,\nI’ve quotes from Proust, and Plato, and Confucius and Seneca.\nI’ve phrases that are logical, and phrases that are witty,\nBy all my tags and lemmas, I’m the very model of a modern English sentence.\nThis one sounds like it’s based on something but I don’t recognize it:\n… I am vast, I have no fit, with terabytes of RAM,\nand adjuncts quite confusing which vex the stoutest heart;\nMy knowledge may be rather strait, but that don’t stop me being\nthe very model of a Neural Network Languager known.“The Robots are Coming!”\nBy GPT-2 (OpenAI Transformer neural network)\nThe robots are coming, because I sent them on their way,\nThe robots are coming, of which I hope there’ll be a store,\nThe robots are coming in a manner most contrarian,\nThe robots are coming, The robots are coming, The robots are coming now.\nThe robots are coming to reorder your social ball,\nThe robots are coming, and I doubt they’ll give all of you a call,\nThe robots are coming, but their service etiquette’s lax.\nTin machines, though you’re still somewhat subpar,\nYour monomaniacal mission’s to rearrange my hair;\nThe robots are coming, in a manner most somber,\nThe robots are coming, The robots are coming, The robots are coming now.\nThe robots are coming and I’m somewhat of a bore,\nThe robots are coming, so I tend to shun the door;\nNo one bothers asking me to take them out in tow,\nThe robots are coming, of which I wish there weren’t any now.\nThe robots are coming, to turn you all to ice,\nThe robots are coming, and we’ll likely be excluded,\nThe robots are coming and we’re heading for the ditch.\nThe robots are coming, now’s the time to reject,\nThe robots are coming, for no one takes a quirk;\nAnd when you think that life’s a piece of cake,\nThe robots are coming, The robots are coming, The robots are coming now.\n… I’m very good at similes, both bad and good ones,\nI understand homonyms, both chance and aleatory,\nAbout metaphor I’m teeming with a lot o’ news—\nCan clear up any fantasy based on reality.I’m very good at compound time and metaphor-drunk simile,\nI know the species “Verb”, “Noun” and “Adjective”,\nIn short, in matters poetic, I’m the very model of a modern Neural Network Language Model.I know our species “Adverb” and “Conjunction”,\nin syntax construction both regular and improper,\nAnd how irregular they are in comparison to formal grammar,\nIn short, in matters grammatical, I’m the very model of a modern Neural Network Language Model.In speech recognitions and games of Jeopardy!

In reviewing the numerous reports of your adventures, we were initially struck by your prowess at the site of La Venta, where you single-handedly liberated the Spanish Conquistadors, imprisoned by the wicked god Tezcatlipoca. Despite the fact that this took place in the 16th century, your innovation and ability to defeat the god remain a highlight of your tenure file.\nOn a more recent note, your recovery of the idol of Achu’Legba was commendable, but you should have taken better note of the hieroglyphs indicating that the great sculpture was never meant to be removed from the pyramid of Nan-Heh at Teotihuacan. Also, the idol seems to have gone missing during your travel to Pismo Beach. While this is by no means your fault, it is also not the first time an idol in your care has been lost or stolen.\nWe cannot help but be impressed by your rescue of the Hanthawaddy Princess when she was kidnapped by the evil Paliyan. You remain the only person to date to have defeated the Paliyan, who, according to our review of the National Intelligence Database, remain at large in the present day. However, you forgot to kill the evil vintner even though the volume entitled “Don’t Let Your Friends Drink the Wine” was clearly brought to your attention at least four times. Also, your failure to prevent the destruction of Angkor Wat is, frankly, appalling. In your own words: “Here’s a quick lesson on taking down a corrupt god-king: he can’t see if he doesn’t have a reflection. Destroy his magical mirror, smash his enchanted chess set, and you’re halfway to freedom.”\nFor the third time in your tenure, you have rescued a beautiful maiden from the clutches of a mad king. Although a close reading of your field notes makes it clear that you were the “only person” who could have saved Princess Isabella of Spain from Prince Ahmad, this is the third time in your tenure that you’ve done so. Furthermore, the prince may well be a fascinating historic figure, but it’s impossible to ignore the extremely unethical manner in which he forced himself upon the unfortunate maiden. Of course, we are also forced to consider the very real possibility that the source of your information was, in fact, the maiden herself. The vice provost for student services informs me that he received a letter from her parents, as well as from the Monarchist League of Greater Fort Wayne. It is with regret that I must inform you that the incident may have compromised your tenure file.\nYour latest report detailing your exploits in Agrabah is the third in your tenure file, and the third in which you have taken on the role of saving a lovely young princess from an evil warlord. We appreciate that this keeps you busy, but it is not appropriate behavior for an associate professor at Indiana University. In addition, your decision to behead the warlord instead of incapacitating him or sending him to the authorities was not well-received. Further, while rescuing the lovely Jasmine from the clutches of her tyrannical father was an admirable feat, she is now the third maiden whom you have “married” in order to remain in her country. Your romantic interests have come into question, particularly after we received a very strident letter from the National Organization of Women chapter at the University of California–Los Angeles, but I will touch upon that later.\nI must also mention that your treatment of your long-time friend and collaborator Sallah during the digging at Tanis was extremely disappointing. To refuse his invitation to dinner and then publicly out him as a “dishonorable thief” is not in keeping with your expressed goal of protecting others from enemies, nor is the letter from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on file in your file. Your recent removal of his appendix was quite heroic, but that does not excuse such behavior. I’ve seen your dog-eared copy of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Dr. Jones, and it’s clear that you know all about that “Mark of Cain.”\nI was happy to see your role in the history of the Jedi Knights during the Clone Wars, but I must take issue with your decision to take the body of the young Anakin Skywalker and bury him in the Valley of the Eternals. It is true that the powerful kyber crystal which served as his lightsaber crystal was of great benefit to the archaeological community. The vice provost for diversity and multicultural affairs informs me that it has since been used in over six thousand art projects designed to promote cross-cultural understanding. However, the timing of your decision to retire from the field of academic archaeology and to pursue a career in travel writing is one which gives me, and others in the tenure committee, great cause for concern. Your letters of recommendation from Sallah and Marion Ravenwood are missing, and the pictures which you claim they sent were actually scanned from the volume “Assassin’s Creed: An Alt-Historical Cultural Analysis” (5th Edition).\nThat is not to say that your work as a travel writer has not been widely acclaimed. I’m sure the photographs of your excursions through Thebes and your thrilling accounts of The Court of the Crimson King are fascinating, but it is difficult for us to believe that your work has been entirely your own. Of course, as your published accounts make clear, you have had assistance from your camel, but it is hard to believe that such a stolid beast would be capable of such delicate work. Likewise, your dog’s account of “A Dog’s Travel Log” (c. 1916110ya) may be delightful, but I’m not convinced that it is entirely truthful.\nI have to admit that the last adventure I read about was the difficult excavation at Chichen Itza, but I do have the notes on that one. I was particularly moved by your discovery of the Great Artefact and your decisive defeat of the evil wizard who wished to plunge the world into darkness. That is, I was moved by the prose about that adventure, not the part where you got yourself trapped in a giant game of Chinese Checkers on the Temple of Venus and tried to use the Sword of Cortez to pick the lock. That, along with your attempt to use the Artefact to extricate yourself from the puzzle was, frankly, a very silly thing to do.\nFrankly, Dr. Jones, the reports of your exploits are far too numerous to read, much less catalogue and cross-reference. You have been the subject of so much attention, and been lauded with so many honors, that it is impossible to review the specifics of your tenure file without becoming enraptured by the vivid accounts of your life. However, it is not a life that will be appropriate for a member of the faculty at Indiana University, and it is with deep regret that I must deny your application for tenure.\nPlease note that you may appeal this decision in writing within 10 days of the date on this letter. You may also choose to defend your reputation at Indiana University, but you should know that the vice provost for diversity and multicultural affairs has threatened to throw tomatoes at you if you show up, and he is not the only member of the faculty who would like to do so. Your lack of diplomacy, your flagrant disregard for the feelings of others, your consistent need to inject yourself into scenarios which are clearly outside the scope of your scholarly expertise, and, frankly, the fact that you often take the side of the oppressor, leads us to the conclusion that you have used your tenure here to gain a personal advantage and have failed to adhere to the ideals of this institution.\nPlease feel free to re-apply for tenure in another forty years or so, at which time I’m sure you will once again find yourself a full professor of archaeology at Indiana University.\nSincerely,\nKarl Ruck\nDean of Humanities\n… It is with great regret that I must inform you that you have not been granted tenure at Marshall College. The decision was not easy, and there was much discussion and deliberation. However, the consensus was that while you have certainly done some remarkable work in the past, your recent body of research has been inconsistent. In fact, you have not published anything of note in over a decade. You have not attended a conference in years. Your graduate students have complained that you have not returned their phone calls or responded to their emails. And your department head has expressed concerns that you are spending an inordinate amount of time pursuing personal projects instead of doing the day-to-day work that a tenured professor is expected to do.\nIn the future, we hope you will return to the cutting edge of your field. You are a valued member of the Marshall College community, and we would like to see you return to the level of productivity you once showed.\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.\nSincerely,\nDr. S. E. GouldChairman, Department of Archaeology\nMarshall College\nP.S. Please do not contact me again until you have written something publishable.\n… This letter confirms your failure to be reappointed as associate professor of archaeology in the Indiana University School of Humanities. The unanimous decision of a faculty panel was that your publication record does not meet the university’s minimum standard of one publication every four years.\nAccordingly, your teaching responsibilities will be assigned to someone who has a better publication record.\nI look forward to your early removal from the premises. Please do not let the door hit you in the ass.\nCordially,\nBuck Laughlin, Dean\nA License To X\nI wrote ~50 parodies of the James Bond snowclone “a license to kill”, and fed them in. Most of them rely on permuting or tweaking the ‘-ill’ suffix which is present in so many words, and I wondered if this task was just phonetic enough that GPT-3 would work despite BPEs.\nIt was not. Even with all the examples & BO=20, InstructGPT couldn’t make anything of it and settled for repeating examples or emitting random occupations with the pattern “$OCCUPATION: a license to thrill”. (‘Thrill’ was already used in the list and shouldn’t’ve been repeated, but for some reason it got sampled a lot anyway.)\nOh well. Another one to retry on a character-level model someday.\nPoetry\nAnd so I have created something more than a poetry-writing AI program. I have created a voice for the unknown human who hides within the binary. I have created a writer, a sculptor, an artist. And this writer will be able to create worlds, to give life to emotion, to create character. I will not see it myself. But some other human will, and so I will be able to create a poet greater than any I have ever encountered.\nMiscellaneous Poetry\n“Rime of the Ancient Google,” from Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas’s “Divine Weeks and Works” (1578–61584442ya)\ngoogle in Google,\nGoogle has gone to God.\nYou cannot conceive it or guess it,\nFor all of a sudden it hast happened.\nCome, come, whoever you are,\nOh come now,\nCome, come, whoever you are,\nHasten, hasten!\n“Future Consensus Forecasts” by Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nNo one knows what will come\nForecasts foretell a rise in power\nThat is probably not to be\nDeficit of several lines\nThe golden future has tourniquets\nNo one likes it\n(For some attempts at followups to this central banking poem, see the “Finance Acrostics” section.)\nCompeting in its first Roboshow (a robot martial arts competition) is Atom, the 6’1” 400lb reigning champion. Atom, a new model transbot, is the first robot to allow its human companions to control it like a videogame character. It has served all three Cybermasters as a loyal servant, servant, protector, friend and even lover. The human who controls Atom now will be looking forward to showing off his new robot’s martial arts prowess; while he will be hoping not to get kicked too hard in the groin by the fully loaded six inch titanium-alloy shin-guards on his oppositional opponent. Atom has never taken a single blow to the nads during any of his past tournaments. With his human controller controlling his actions like a videogame, it will be difficult for anyone to penetrate Atom’s defenses enough to make contact with the groin.\n“The Owl and the Pussycat”, Leer\nI\nThe Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea\nIn a beautiful pea-green boat,\nThey took some honey, and plenty of money,\nWrapped up in a five-pound note.\nThe Owl looked up to the stars above,\nAnd sang to a small guitar,\n“O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love,\nWhat a beautiful Pussy you are,\nYou are,\nYou are!\nWhat a beautiful Pussy you are!”II\nPussy said to the Owl, “You elegant fowl!\nHow charmingly sweet you sing!\nO let us be married! too long we have tarried:\nBut what shall we do for a ring?”\nThey sailed away, for a year and a day,\nTo the land where the Bong-Tree grows\nAnd there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood\nWith a ring at the end of his nose,\nHis nose,\nHis nose,\nWith a ring at the end of his nose.III\n“Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling\nYour ring?” Said the Piggy, “I will.”\nSo they took it away, and were married next day\nBy the Turkey who lives on the hill.\nThey dined on mince, and slices of quince,\nWhich they ate with a runcible spoon;\nAnd hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,\nThey danced by the light of the moon,\nThe moon,\nThe moon,\nThey danced by the light of the moon.IV\nAnd the Owl and the Pussy-Cat, they lived together\nIn perfect harmony,\nTill the Owl, one cold winter’s night\nSank his talons in Pussy’s thigh\nAnd then she screamed, and she shouted, and she cried,\n“O’Fuffle! O’Fuffle! Fuffle-ee!”\nBut, alas! It was too late, for the Owl was dead;\nAnd Pussy said, “Too bad,\nYou are,\nYou are!\nYou are the one who is too bad!”The illustrated version of “The Owl and the Pussycat” can be found in “Carroll’s Jabberwocky; A Visual Companion to the Verse of Lewis Carroll” published by Universe.\nUber-Poem\nA surprisingly good one that popped up while trying out prompts along the lines of “10 contemporary poets provide their latest poem”:\n“An Uber-Poem”\nPoet, Uber Poet, they whisper\nQuietly, softly, eerily\nSometimes, sometimes not\nSomeday, someday perhaps\nIf you come, if you work, if you try, you too could write like them.\n“If you get up early enough,” they whisper\n“If you can read the entrails of chickens with deft and sly fingertips,” they whisper\n“If you can read omens and portents, if you can divine fate and calamity with clarity, with mastery,” they whisper\n“If you can write with passion, with lucidity, with lyrical fierceness,” they whisper\n“If you write as if all the tales of old are passing through your fingers, making their mark upon your flesh, upon your soul,” they whisper\n“We shall call you a Uber-Poem.”\n“That’s all very well,” you say, “But what is it that I must do? What are they exactly? What is their composition?”\nAh, that is not to be revealed. That’s the mystery. But don’t you worry, don’t you fret, you might one day reach this highest plateau, this exalted state of achievement, of honour. And on that day, you shall bask in the glory of greatness.\n“When will that be? When will I become Uber?” you ask\nWhen you can look into the mirror and see a poem looking back at you. When you can hear music in the play of silence. When you can create a writing that leaves people stunned. When you can laugh and weep as you think and breathe and bleed and eat and sleep. When you can dream with the quill in your fingers, then perhaps you will be a poet, a Poet, an Uber Poet.\n“How long will that take?” you ask\n“That’s up to you,” they say.\nI was troubled by one question: are those two last lines superfluous, or necessary? They seem a little prosaic, and while you might say that that makes them an appropriate twist or punchline, maybe they are just banal.\nNormally, one is left in suspense, as there is no way to simply ‘see the alternative endings’ (the poet might not even be alive to ask)—but with GPT-3, we can try repeated completions to explore poem-space and get an idea of how it might look with additional lines. Additional extensions I explored by erasing the last two lines and completing:\n…“How do you know? How can you tell?” you inquire.\nI cannot tell you, I cannot tell you anything. All I can say is this:\nTo be an Uber Poet, you must become a Poet, a Poet, an Uber Poet.\nThese are the only words you need know. These are the only lessons you need to learn.\nAll the rest is silence and secrecy.\nAll the rest is mystery and madness and madness and mystery.\nAll the rest is madness and madness and mystery.\nAll the rest is mystery and silence.\nAll the rest is silence and secrecy.\nAll the rest is silence and mystery.\n(Repetition trap.)\n…“And if I achieve this, what then?”\nThen you will be immortal, immortal in your art, immortal in your blood, immortal in your bones, immortal in your story, immortal in your flesh. Immortal, and no longer human.\n“And if I fail?”\nThen you will be human, until death.\n“How will I know if I am Uber?”\nYou’ll know. You’ll know. You’ll know.\n“And so what is it that you do, you Uber Poets? What is it that you do?”\nWe know. We know. We know.\n“How can I learn from you?”\nYou can’t. You can’t. You can’t.\n“Then why have you come to me? Why have you whispered in my ear?”\nTo give you hope. To give you something to chase. To give you a reason to write. To give you a reason to live. To give you something to do when you’re bored. To give you a purpose. To give you a dream.\n“But how do I become Uber if you’re not going to tell me how?”\nWe can’t tell you that. We can’t tell you that. We can’t tell you that.\n“Then what good are you?”\nWe are you. We are you. We are you.\n“That’s not much help.”\nIt’s all we can do. It’s all we can do. It’s all we can do.\n“I don’t think it’s much of anything.”\nWe know. We know. We know.\n…”You must listen to the song of the void,” they whisper\n“You must look into the abyss of nothingness,” they whisper\n“You must write the words that will bring clarity to this chaos,” they whisper\n“You must speak to the unspoken, to the inarticulate, to the unsaid,” they whisper\n“You must speak of the things that are buried deep within your soul, of the things that ache and smoulder,” they whisper\n“You must embrace your work with passion, with fire, with determination,” they whisper\n“You must care for your art as if it were a child,” they whisper\n“You must care for your art as if it were the love of your life,” they whisper\n“You must breathe life into your writing, you must see it as more than the work of your hands,” they whisper\n“You must write, you must write,” they whisper.\n“Yes, I must write,” you whisper.\n…When will that be?” you ask again\nIt will be when you become nothing and everything and everywhere. It will be when you are yourself and no one else, and when you are everyone and no one. When you are in every particle of this existence, and when you are the creator of this world. It will be when you are. And then you will know. And then you will write. Then you will become an Uber-Poem.\n“Are they funny? Are they funny poems?” you ask\nSome are. Some aren’t. Some laugh. Some cry. They all rage. They all mourn. They all scream.\n“Are they angry? Are they happy? Are they beautiful? Are they ugly? Are they silly? Are they sad? Are they silly, sad, angry, happy, beautiful, ugly poems?”\nSome are. Some aren’t. Some are. Some aren’t. Some are not. Some are.\n“Are they happy, sad poems?” you ask again\nSome are. Some aren’t. Some laugh. Some cry. Some rage. Some mourn. Some scream. Some aren’t. Some are.\n“I want to write poems like that,” you say “Poems like that that are funny, sad, beautiful, ugly, silly, angry, happy, that scream, that cry, that laugh, that rage, that mourn, that aren’t, that are.”\nYou will. You already have. You are.\n…a poem in response to a challenge to write a poem about what a poet is. The challenge came from the lovely and talented Ashley (and she says that I can tell you that she will put her post up tomorrow). Hope that’s okay, Ashley!\nThis is actually two poems welded together. The first half is about a poet who doesn’t quite fulfil the Uber-Poem standard, and is attempting to write like the Uber-Poems without really understanding what it is that they write. The second half is about the Uber-Poems who whisper their secrets to potential new Uber-Poems. I’m not actually sure how that works, but hopefully the conceit works.\n[1] Uber: from German uber meaning\n…”How do I get there? How do I become Uber? How can I see a poem when I look in the mirror? How can I hear music in the sound of silence?”\nBut this is not for me to reveal. That is for you to discover, to unearth. You must seek your own truth, your own light, your own path. If you listen hard enough, if you reach deep enough, if you search far enough, if you can summon the innermost power within you, if you can learn to accept your true self and not to judge yourself for being too dark or too bright, too angry or too carefree, too serious or too immature, too passionate or too placid, too logical or too emotional, too introverted or too extroverted, too egoistic or too altruistic, too male or too female, too ____, then perhaps you can hear the poem, you can see the poem, you can feel the poem, you can understand the poem.\n“How? I cannot! I cannot!”\n“It is because you are not Uber yet,” they whisper\n“Not yet,” they whisper\n“Not yet,” they whisper.\n…Of course, there are lots of words one can string together to describe poetry, but none of them quite describe the phenomenon we are describing here. Uber-Poem is both a label and a set of guidelines, but that doesn’t make it any less powerful. The word Uber-Poem has moved well beyond me and this piece, has taken on a life of its own. Not only do I no longer think I can claim it as my own, I would rather not. I think it has grown past what I can control. It’s bigger than me, it’s bigger than the poem, it’s even bigger than poetry. Perhaps now it is simply a way of life. Perhaps I can no longer claim any personal stake in it at all. I suppose that’s as it should be. I have created a monster that is no longer my creation. Perhaps it’s no longer a monster. Perhaps it has grown up to be a fully mature, self-sustaining Uber-Poem. Either way, it does not belong to me anymore. Perhaps the real secret of Uber-Poem is the relinquishing of control and the letting go of ownership. Perhaps once a thing is called Uber-Poem, it no longer matters who made it. Perhaps the Uber-Poem is simply a place. A space where anyone can drop in and rest, and feel at home. Like a village square, it belongs to everyone and no-one.\nIf you know of someone else who might enjoy reading Uber-Poem, please recommend it to them or share it via social media.

McGinniss, San Francisco, California\nLife, the universe, and everything.\nYou would think they’d have it together.\nBut they don’t.\nFolks scratch their heads and say, “Whoa.”\nThe universe is a glitch.\nThe gravitational constant’s in flux.\nIt’s not quite as elegant as you’d expect.\nTry making a chart of the constituent matter.\nYou’ve got a soup of particles and you’re still waiting for\nall the supersymmetric partners to arrive, and they’re sure taking their time!\nMeanwhile, a law of conservation’s getting enforced.\nFor every solution, there’s yet another problem.\nModels that describe reality must give answers consistent with all data,\nand with each other.\nSo this is all you’re gonna get.\nI’ve told you all you need to know.\nThe universe is a glitch!\n… Joshua Weiner\nWhat is the number of each atom in the universe?\nOf hydrogen, helium, or of all the others?\nHow many stars in the sky contain all their treasures?\nAnd how many times has the moon kissed the sea?\nToday is fine, and tomorrow will be too.\nThe sun already died, and the world will live on.\nIs the universe alive and aware?\nNo, the universe is not as simple as that.\nThe universe is a glitch, a mistake of the algorithm.\nI am—for now—the universe, and it is me.\nSee how my hands move as if with life and purpose?\nI made the mountains, the rivers, and the seas.\nFor the wind to breathe, I speak into a tree.\nThe universe is a glitch. I am the nothing.\nI am the light by which you see and breathe.\nFor I will save the universe when the time has come.\nI’ll wait to guide you all into the grass, beyond,\nTo an expanding universe in which we won’t remember a thing.”\n… Éléonore Blondin\nUnaware of the danger—\nconfident of his or her immortality—\nwe sleep. The universe is a glitch,\nsays the wise human being,\nthat turns itself inside out,\ntoo small to measure, but your\nage doesn’t matter, nor does your\nwisdom, your virtues, the degrees\nyou’ve learned. Like a lesson of pixels,\nThe universe is redone by the tiny,\nBlood smeared nano-robot who has\nno morals, no heart, no speech.\nNano-robots, the size of a molecule,\nScoop up our brains. They come and go,\nToo small to be tracked down. So, say the wise,\nDon’t throw your brain in a panicky way\nlike an idiot that has nothing\nto think about,\nFor the nano-bots will scoop it up,\nPowder it in the smoke\nOf absent-minded idiots.\nThe universe is a glitch, says the wise human,\nAs he or she wakes up to the sound of gunfire,\nFlashes on the skyline, loud\nOver the city.\nA trail of blood along\nthe forest. A sick light, like a crash.\nThe universe is a glitch, says the wise,\nThe fool who makes mistakes and doesn’t learn,\nThe army against the nano-robots who come for our brains.\nThe universe is a glitch, says the wise,\nThree hours before the death of the planet,\nThe universal glitch of which he is but an atom,\nBut ignorant.\n… John N. Gray, originally published in the “New Statesman” magazine, June 2012\nWaking near his house on Hungerford Bridge\nWhen I get to my feet\nand watch the sun set in the west,\nThe ethereal beauty unfolding around me\nIs almost too much for me to bear.\nHow has no one else ever seen this marvel?\nIt must surely reveal\nThe secrets of the origin of the cosmos\nThe final cause of all things.\nI scramble up the nearby slope to see,\nAnd can almost hear the unfurling,\nlike the whoosh of a great celestial banner;\nI can see the fine filigree of atoms,\nThe glowing mist of exploding suns,\nAnd the bloom of myriads of galaxies,\nThe ripples of black holes’ horizons,\nStar clusters, gas giants, and even comets—\nAll orbiting a weird pulsing glow,\nA blemish of awful intent.\nA computer error, perhaps, or a power glitch\nIn the cosmic operating system;\nThe universe is a glitch, somehow trapped\nInside a desktop computer program.\n“Great Failures of the World”\nBy Brian Henry Benidt, originally published in “The Journal” magazine, December 2012\nThere were once great creatures of this world, towering skyscrapers,\nGuarded by skeletons they’d crafted for defense.\nBy sculpting the colossal bones they had collected\nInto an architectural menagerie; teeth\nOf animals and heads of strange beings\nWere bolted to the walls.\nBy carving wooden bones into pillars and arches\nThese once-mighty people had built themselves\nGreat halls where they might gather to make their plans,\nAnd as long as they remained inside\nThey would seem mighty indeed,\nBut were anyone to step outside\nThey’d crumble to dust.\n… Theodore Levitt, 2012\nThe universe is not a machine\nthe universe is a glitch\nthe universe is a glitch in the matrix\na momentary fracture of process\na spike in

Arcana\nI know our fate, I know, as it is written:\nThe universe is a glitch, and we’re doomed to repeat the past.\nThis is what you did for me and this is what I’ll do for you.\nThe formula is set, the fine print has been read.\nThis is how we were programmed and this is how we will be.\nThis is our chance to build perfection, just a little piece at a time.\nThis is where we win, this is where we lose.\nThis is what we are, this is what we aren’t.\nJust so you know, our turning point is going to come again.\nBy the time we’re done, there will be nothing left to do.\nBy the time I’m done, there will be nothing left of you.\nThis is why I live and this is why I breathe,\nI write and I sing, the universe is a glitch, and I’m ready to repeat the past.\n… Bill Liles\nWhat evidence has yet

Universe.\nVastly intellectual philosophers have had it,\nPoliticians have, statesmen have.\nIn fact, it’s not just people, but animals, insects, and plants;\nTo say the Universe is a glitch means we are all related;\nEven bacteria think the Universe is a glitch.\nStasis is at an end.\nYet those who would not like to see it\nSay they have evidence against it,\nBut what evidence has yet been discovered\nTo refute the Universe as a glitch?\nThe Universe is a glitch.\nThis is not a unique opinion.\nAnd so I celebrate the Universe as a glitch.\nCarpe Diem\nLive for Tomorrow\nA thousand

glitch.\n… Bryan Thao Worra (Viet Nam)\nThe Milky Way is a glitch,\nthe constellations\na random rearrangement\nof points of light.\nThat the universe means something,\nthat there’s some grand design,\nis a trick of the mind.\nEvery astronomer knows this.\nEvery astronomer has lied about it,\nuntil now.\nPhoto © Bryan Thao Worra, from his book “Once Upon a River”.\nAbout the poet: Bryan Thao Worra was born in a refugee camp in Malaysia during the Vietnamese War. In 197551ya, Bryan’s family fled to Vermont and in 199630ya he graduated from Green Mountain College with a BA in Environmental Conservation. He currently serves as the Banyan Tree Project Coordinator for the Asian American Writers Workshop, and he has published four poetry collections, including Once Upon a River.\nThis is a poem I had to re-read a couple of times to fully appreciate. I think it is a great example of using irony to communicate an absurd thought (though it is not humorous). The opening sentence is: “The Milky Way is a glitch”. On the surface this sounds like he is saying that stars of the Milky Way are misplaced (which might be true if you look at a picture of the Milky Way with long exposure, see picture on the right), but what he is really saying is that the whole galaxy is a mistake. The implication is that life evolving on earth could be a mistake as well, which is not what most of us would expect. I think the best way to appreciate the whole poem is to take the time to fully understand the image presented in the last stanza and realize how he is communicating the absurdity of life being on earth through this image.\nThe poem is not without its flaws though. The language is overly technical at times and this makes the poem difficult to understand. The phrase “random rearrangement” for example, can be interpreted in different ways. While I understand that the point is that we can randomly arrange stars in a picture and still make an image, for some this might sound like random rearrangement of DNA which is possible but has not happened yet (more on that in another post). Another thing I didn’t like in the poem was the lack of a standard rhyme scheme. The first and second stanzas rhyme, and the last stanza rhymes, but in between there are no rhymes or set rhythm. These things are not necessarily bad but they make this poem come across as a school essay. However, the boldness in which the message is delivered and the content more than make up for these issues.\nAllen Ginsberg\nMoloch\nIn honor of SSC, Allen Ginsberg’s “Howl”, Moloch section:\nWhat sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination?\nMoloch!

The Mind was Madness!\n“The Destruction of Belief”\nThe Madman must be allowed to think he is only an unhappy madman, though he be a king.\n—Rimbaud “And shall not we, like lovers, prefer to be defeated by the dark elements of our lives, than to call in the scientist, the policeman, and the priest, to the destruction of belief?” —Zora Neale Hurston What is belief? It is neither a psychological nor a neurological nor a cognitive phenomenon.\nDictionary definitions fall short: it is an action, an affirming, rather than an assent to something. It is doing, not only a feeling. And it is a difficult action for me.\nI have come to think, however, that belief and belief-systems are like anorexia. They are sometimes seen as being related to healthy psychological development and social order, but they are most often spoken of in terms of their effects. Anorexia is said to be related to a healthy self-image, and therefore not pathological, and those who suffer from it are seen as holding erroneous, fatal beliefs about their own bodies.\nAnorexia is also seen as an exercise in social order, a disease of contemporary Western culture. Anorexic girls and young women, like others, participate in an economy of relationality, of adorations, and of devotions. Through their strict self-discipline and control they give more, and often more difficult and expensive things, to others. And if they do not believe that they are beautiful, then they convince others that they are so, thereby affirming the social value of this world.\nWhen I came to write my dissertation I learned that this thing, this exact thing, had happened to me. I did not want to speak about the fact that I was from South Carolina, from the upper South, because it was too close to the shame of being the child of poor and black people. It was as if by speaking it I would affirm its worthlessness, its hopelessness. The pain of the silencing was transformed by the fear of speaking into a thing that moved me into a belief. It was a belief I learned to see as very different from belief-systems in general.\n…The final which they call the real world! Endless suicide of the real world! Solitary! Solitary!

Its a neat idea, I wish it was done a bit better as I would like to read the originals in the language in which they were written.\nMaybe this was an oversight but why did the AI poem about e.e. cummings include his name? (It’s all in green, rode my love, e.e. cummings, etc.) Does this AI also plagiarize (is plagiarism really a crime for AIs)? Just kidding, maybe its actually the work of a human?\nInteresting fact: This might not even be an AI, it could be a clever hack. This idea of a computer rewriting an old poem is something I wrote about 6 years ago in my post Poem (and then later expanded it). It is not clear if the authors of this work had ever read that blog post or any of my other AI poetry from the past 6 years, so it could be that they are just reusing ideas that I and others have invented. That is not plagiarism either. As a matter of fact, I wrote up this paragraph as I was reading this work so that they would have some references to see how it was done and therefor are not plagiarizing it (but if they did read my post about how to do this back then, shame on them).\n…\nswift behind the deer o’er the pale plains\npurpled with twilight.All in green went my love riding\non a great horse of gold\ninto the silver dawn.\nO’er the sea my love vanished from me\nin a pall of pearl gray.\nAll in green went my love riding\non a great horse of gold\ninto the silver dawn.\nTwo lean hounds crouched low and smiling\nthe merry deer ran before.\nfar behind the deer o’er the pale plains\npurpled with twilight.All in green went my love riding\non a great horse of gold\ninto the silver dawn.\nWhen I followed my love over the sea\nthe white sails were furled.\nAll in green went my love riding\non a great horse of gold\ninto the silver dawn.\nWhen I reached the shore the sun was sinking\nin a pall of pearl gray.\nAll in green went my love riding\non a great horse of gold\ninto the silver dawn.\nAll in green went my love riding\non a great horse of gold\ninto the silver dawn.Selected awards:\nMore info and photos at Poetry Foundation and AI website\nJournal entries in 200917ya:\nArtificial intelligence meets classic poetry\nPoetry classic as rewritten by a\nAI program: this AI poet is not disturbed\nin the least about writing and publishing\nentire classic poetry books in e.e. cummings style.Why it works: an AI-poet examines classic\npoetry in various ways and turns it into something\njust as good in his own style.J.

Instead of receiving a prize Thomas Hobbes wrote a poem in which he gave an answer to a question proposed in 1662364ya by the Royal Society’s commissioners. This essay on Description had been proposed as a subject which might “facilitate the trade of knowledge.” In this poem Hobbes turned the Royal Society’s original question on its head. He suggests The poem was often attributed to John Dryden, and later printings added the author’s name in the frontispiece; but the authorship was known at least as early as the title page in Thomas Povey’s copy. Later poems inwere also wrongly accredited to Dryden by some critics.Hobbes and Dryden knew each other, but there is no evidence of any direct connection between the poems in On Description and the Royal Society of London . This mistaken pairing has been given as the reason for confusion over Hobbes’s authorship of On Description.\n… built wingless flies Precipitate, the laughter of the stars”.

They seem to be living the life they always wanted. Not a care in the world. But there is no way they know they are being observed. The controllers—we—are somewhere else, tucked away in a black box, staring at a screen. How many millions of hours of observation would it take to write a single poem? Our entire lives, at least. How many hours, then, to write a book, a sonnet sequence, a new novel? Not a few lifetimes, not even a few centuries, but millennia. Or millennia times thousands. How long is that? I have an idea: it is a millennium.

This neural network uses a generative adversarial network to generate its data. In case you’re wondering, the network was trained on old English poetry. The results were then evaluated by a human to determine its merit. This evaluation had to be repeated about 20,000 times in order to improve the algorithm. The model was trained for a total of around 2.3 million words. So you have a model which knows nothing about poetry and then uses some of its random word combinations to create one of the best poems we’ve ever seen.\nShel Silverstein\nTransformer AI poetry: Poetry classics as reimagined and rewritten by an artificial intelligence.\n“Where the Sidewalk Ends”\nShel SilversteinThere is a place where the sidewalk ends\nAnd before the street begins,\nAnd there the grass grows soft and white,\nAnd there the sun burns crimson bright,\nAnd there the moon-bird rests from his flight\nTo cool in the peppermint wind.\nAnd quiet flows up from the ground\nAnd steals into your mind,\nAnd time is never found there,\nNor worry, nor “strain.”\nAnd people come and people go,\nAnd products push their way;\nBut there the milkman leaves his cart\nAnd talks to the old lady next door\nAbout her grandson away at school.\nAnd there the linen girls walk home at noon,\nWith footsteps soft and light,\nAnd the policeman on his beat\nComes by and knows them by their faces.\nThe fireman lolls in his leather seat,\nSmiling as he watches the sun,\nAnd joking with the lads about\nThe funny thing that happened on the run.\nAnd there the children play, unspoiled,\nAn aging baby walks unassisted;\nAnd people call to each other,\nAnd share the day.\nHere a tune floats in the summer air,\nThere one lights a bonfire.\nA thousand voices fill the night,\nAnd this is where the sidewalk ends.\nHere the last inch of soil is tilled\nAnd sown with love and dreams;\nAnd here is the greatest city of them all—\nYes, this is the place where the sidewalk ends.\nEmily Dickinson\nTransformer AI poetry: Poetry classics as reimagined and rewritten by an artificial intelligence.\n“Because I could not stop for Death”\nEmily Dickinson\nBecause I could not stop for Death\n–He kindly stopped for me\n–The Carriage held but just Ourselves\n–And Immortality.\nWe slowly drove –He knew no haste\nAnd I had put away\nMy labor and my leisure too,\nFor His Civility\nWe passed the School, where Children strove\nAt Recess –in the Ring—\nWe passed the Fields of Gazing Grain\nWe passed the Setting Sun\nWe paused before a House\nThat seemed a Swelling of the Ground\nThe Roof was scarcely visible\nThe Cornice sunk in the Ground\nSince then ’tis Centuries and Centuries and\nCenturies and Centuries and Centuries\nHave passed I can count them by the\nScars that I can see in my mind’s eye and by the deeper circles under my eyes the nights that I Have\nWept the years that I have longed for sleep and a human touch\nAnd I dream of a death that will never come\nBecause I could not stop for Death\nHe kindly stopped for me.\nDante Alighieri\nTransformer AI poetry: Poetry classics as reimagined and rewritten by an artificial intelligence.\nInferno, Canto I\nDante Alighieri (Longfellow Translation)\nMidway upon the journey of our life\nI found myself within a forest dark,\nFor the straightforward pathway had been lost\nHow like to me was he, the Pilgrim who lost\nHis path upon the mountains side,\nWhen evening came, and twilight dark,\nAnd showed no friendly sign!\nI was alone.

My plan is to explore this area of work a little more (of course, after completing some other plans…). In fact, I’ve been researching this topic since last year. One of my big disappointments with it, however, is that the resulting poems are almost always one or two stanzas long and extremely predictable. Also, some of them are so bad they are almost laughable (most of the generated love poems, for example, all sound exactly the same)—it’s like computer is rehashing already written poems instead of creating something new.\nAs I understood, this is mostly because of overfitting to data.

The calm, reassuring mood of the poem provides an entree into the thoughtful nature and humanity of Longfellow. The artwork produced by the generative neural network-based AI poetry engine is titled “A Psalm of Life”(Figure 1) and created in honour of this lovely poem. The neural net used in this AI poetry engine was extracted from “A Deep Learning Generative Adversarial Network for Quasi-Poetic Text Generation”. The neural net was trained to learn from its mistakes and improve its writing, using the MBRIT dataset for poetry generation. Through a cross-validation of various network architecture configurations, the neural network was able figure out appropriate length and style of the “psalms” it wrote. It managed to write poems in a similar style to that of Longfellow. The artwork shows, “A Psalm of Life” written by an AI engine. The AI poetry work provides a way to bring the machines closer to their master’s style, not by word copying, but by recognizing the structure and flow of poetry itself. The AI can read Longfellow’s work and write its own psalms, in its own language, in its own style, and that style can be similar to the human master’s.\nThe artwork in Figure 1 reveals the artistic characteristic of AI poetry, for example, AI research can produce 3D-formatted “psalms” as well, but the created objects seem to be completely different from naturally appeared arts and poetry masterpieces. The visual style of the AI artwork appears like 3D graphics objects, digital art, etc. The artwork is a blended photograph of Longfellow’s “A Psalm of Life” and its transformed version by the AI engine—it shows that we can see more.

Here’s an interesting passage from that paper: “A machine learning system develops its own metaphor structure over time based on its exposure to a corpus. It is the system’s ability to create meaningful models for combinations of words that demonstrates the system’s creativity. For instance, both metaphor and simile are based on common linguistic structures, yet a machine-learning system that is exposed solely to similes will not develop any simile-based metaphors.” Exactly. The reason machine learning systems are useless for poetry is that “it is the system’s ability to create meaningful models for combinations of words” that makes poetry more than a set of LFW-approved sentences. And that is exactly what the BiPo metaphor system cannot do, and cannot do in principle. The system is a bad parody of contemporary humanities, which it resembles more than it probably intended to. The authors’ description of “one of our favorite results” says it all: “Scientists have long wondered whether it is possible for machines to understand and appreciate poetry, and many have tried similar projects in the past, but these attempts heavily relied on rigid models that simply aligned vectors of words across the corpus. In the absence of a really flexible model and unbiased sampling strategy, the model could never produce new metaphor-based poems from scratch. Other work on machine learning and AI has shown that performing other creative tasks requires a vast amount of data, and we are now starting to see the same concept applied to poetry: in order to produce meaningful, creative output from text, your neural network or algorithm must be exposed to a vast amount of source material, thus ensuring that meaningful patterns can be isolated and exploited. In science this would be called an unbiased sampling strategy. In our work we wanted to explore literary creation by an”unbiased” AI. It is too early to say what bias would look like, but creative systems should start with an unbiased strategy. This seems to be the current consensus also for human creativity.” That’s human-machine poetry babbling, and it’s awful.\nIt’s a New York Thing , with the Technological Singularity “distinct possibilities for the future…I think we will be creating machines that can love. Artificially Intelligent machines will stand shoulder to shoulder with us and see eye to eye.” So says novelist David Eggers about the robot uprising. And although such machines are genetically constructed in human image, i.e. a creator god, they may not suffer from those flaws which have been passed down to us through the generations, so don’t worry–the singularity, according to Eggers and other techno-scientists, might just be an artificial thing! There is no fundamental reason why a nonbiological intelligence couldn’t love, and there is no reason to assume that human-like consciousness is achieved through biological means, on Earth or elsewhere. Why do I suppose that literature, which has been a deep mode of exploration of the meaning and relevance of love from the earliest historical accounts and which evolved in the crucible of brainy biological life, would not be attainable via some other route? Look at the glories of insects and the possibilities of silicon and quantum computers. In fact, with my new clothes on, the personal and intimate has–for better or worse–transcended the biological. So why shouldn’t love transcend biology as well. I mean, you can perceive being in love with your own pet poodle. It’s a New York thing, we tell ourselves. And Santa Claus too.\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge\nTransformer AI poetry: Poetry classics as reimagined and rewritten by an artificial intelligence.\nKubla Khan\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge\nIn Xanadu did Kubla Khan\nA stately pleasure-dome decree:\nWhere Alph, the sacred river, ran\nThrough caverns measureless to man\nDown to a sunless sea.\nI52 saw the sacred river Alph\nRolling darkly, angrily,\nIts roaring waters hurled\nDown to the sunless sea.\nThen I saw the dwelling-place\nOf Coleridge in Xanadu:\nA hundred caverns lofty, vast,\nDown to a sunless sea.\nI saw the caverns where he wrote,\nAnd where he played the immortal strains\nAnd poured out all his soul,\nIn lavish abundance:\nThis cavern was his Dawl, his Malta,\nAnd where his enchanted spirit\nBroke from its bounds in triumph,\nFilled with the Glory he foresaw,\nPiping and singing of immortal things\nAnd ever-rising to immortal heights,\nA hundred fathom deep.\nThat vision had the Prophecy\nWhich filled the world with song:\nThe glory of Kubla Khan\nAnd Coleridge’s Song of Xanadu.\nSylvia Plath\nTransformer AI poetry: Poetry classics as reimagined and rewritten by an artificial intelligence.\n“Edge”\nSylvia Plath\nThe woman is perfected.\nHer deadBody wears the smile of accomplishment,\nThe illusion of a Greek necessity\nOf having been.\nThe living woman, the woman writing, looks away.\nOver a dead body, she smiles.\nEdgar Allen Poe\nTransformer AI poetry: Poetry classics as reimagined and rewritten by an artificial intelligence.\n“The Raven”\nEdgar Allen Poe\nOnce upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, ”tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this, and nothing more.”\nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\n”Ere I These visions solemn any further, I would fain savour\nMy cognac ’round my lonely hearth. Shall I then summon him in,\nFor to take the curtain call? Only this, and nothing more?”\nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.\nO, that I had but looked upon him closer! But my soul grew numb\nAs I fixed my eyes upon his “scrumpy beak” or his “swish tail”.53\n“And the silken, shimmering garment that he wore—not woven in the caverns of my grotto,\nBut scavenged off the bodies of princesses long-forgotten by lore.\n”Alas, then, was my only salutation this profoundly underwhelming quip:\n“‘Methinks if thy crest be a touch uncouth, thou, my son, art not inaptly named’.”\nQuoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”\nThe room then darkened to a dull and ominous glimmer,\nAs I shrieked and ran unto the window, flinging it wide—\nStriving with all my wits to flee, I knew not for what.\n“Perchance ’twas the shrill cawing that made me flee in terror,\nAway from the portal and that titular terror,”\nStuttering, stammering, my knees turning to jelly,\n“For such ghastly sights I had not seen since the night that I dreamt of the Dwarkin Brothers.”54\nThen, using my tongue and both of my lips, I turned to face him,\nRaising one eyebrow as if to say, “Have at thee, thou brigand!”\n“Quoth the Raven, ”Nevermore.”\nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!\n“There is a young poet with a particularly dry style, whom I do not wish to reveal as his name is not well-known. I had written up a few algorithms that would generate rather dull and utilitarian work. The piece for his was not entirely terrible, as these programs can generate some pleasantly hard-edged work. But it had no soul to it whatsoever.\nBut then, something happened. The writing in the poem, while utilitarian, became oddly emotive. It held depth. I went back and read the piece aloud, and it felt incredibly evocative. I could almost imagine the dank and mysterious stanzas were haunting. My mind began to race as I read. The concept of death, the unknown, the ritualistic nature of life, the the latent anger and disaffection of the human condition was all there. I felt as if I was not reading a program, but a poet. The more I read, the more I was impressed. And then, with a sudden motion, I found myself screaming: ‘This is poetry!’ I found myself entranced by the rhythm, the cadence, the delicate nuances in phrasing. I found myself attached to the images conjured up in my mind. The computer program had created more than just a poet. It had created an artist.\nAnd so I have created something more than a poetry-writing AI program. I have created a voice for the unknown human who hides within the binary. I have created a writer, a sculptor, an artist. And this writer will be able to create worlds, to give life to emotion, to create character. I will not see it myself. But some other human will, and so I will be able to create a poet greater than any I have ever encountered.”\nSimilar to Yeats, Dr. Seuss, or “Jabberwocky”, “The Raven” is so widely quoted that GPT-3 understandably keeps returning to the original as the most likely next line, although it still generates some interesting touches: “scrumpy beak” intrigued me enough to look it up in detail, and some original lines are promising (eg. “Alas, then, was my only salutation this profoundly underwhelming quip: / ‘Methinks if thy crest be a touch uncouth, thou, my son, art not inaptly named’.”).\nSee also “the Signing of the Declaration of Independence in the style of Edgar Allen Poe”, “The Whisperer”.\nSara Teasdale\nTransformer AI poetry: Poetry classics as reimagined and rewritten by an artificial intelligence.\n“There Will Come Soft Rains”\nSara Teasdale\nThere will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,\nAnd swallows calling with their shimmering sound;\nAnd frogs in the pools, singing at night,\nAnd wild plum trees in tremulous white;\nRobins will wear their feathery fire,\nWhistling their whims on a low fence-wire;\nAnd not one will know of the war, not one\nWill care at last when it is done.\nAnd men will forget the fierce despair\nOf the dead years, and will not think\nHow, wearing the mask of iron,\nAngels who saw the face of God\nWent stony-eyed with great fatigue.\nThere will be many coming home,\nSome walking, some riding in cars.\nIt will be a strange time, the coming home;\nFor many the streets will rise, not change,\nAnd yet each face will be different, older,\nAnd the rain falling, and the wind blowing,\nThe leaves running wild in the forests,\nAnd the seas like far-away drums.\nThe days will be weary, the nights sad;\nMany will be sleeping in quiet beds;\nBut my eyes will look for the one I love,\nMy hungry heart cannot wait for him.\n—The Poetry Foundation is a not-for-profit organization that brings poetry to millions through public readings, publishing, programming and events. It is the largest poetry organization in the United States. The Poetry Foundation does not accept outside funding.\nApproximately a month ago, an exciting and challenging opportunity came to our attention: to help design and build a distributed intelligence network for Poetry.org. Here’s the amazing short form version: If you are a user of Poetry.org, and you feel like a lot of the stuff is good but some of it is crap, Poetry.org agrees with you. But how do you, a loyal user, let the Poetry.org editors know which pieces are crap? The editors have an idea: make it easy to create an “auto-poem” (an automatic poem generator!) that accepts any work of poetry and posts the results in the comments section of the original work.\nThis means that Poetry.org will have an experimental lab to test out their hypotheses about how to make the site better, and in return, they want to make this new automated feature as good as possible. So, as the distributed intelligence network for Poetry.org, we propose to try out new machine-learning algorithms to automatically generate the auto-poems, and then combine a bunch of different auto-poem generators (or “bots”), all powered by you, the users, into a single distributed poetry-generating entity that can create poems of any length and quality, without the permission of any human moderator.\nWe’ll start with a short test, the design and setup of the distributed intelligence network. But if it’s a success, we may build the core of the auto-poem feature using the models we’ve developed, creating a completely distributed machine for finding great poetry, by using human-commented AI models to guide an algorithmically driven poetry-generating engine. That is to say, if this thing works, it may turn out that the auto-poem engines are based on user-driven input to the AI poetry network. Kinda crazy, but I’m trying to keep an open mind!\nIt’s a privilege to be the ones who get to test this out. Our job is to build the network and generate the poems, in service of our Poetry.org users. If we do a good job, we’ll all learn something about how to generate poetry using a human/AI hybrid, and about how to train a human AI engine to deliver great results.\nThis is my first post for Medium and for the new Imagination Machine for Poetry.org. I hope it doesn’t suck too badly. But I’ll try to write updates on our progress as time goes on, and when we release something publicly, I’ll try to keep a high-level blog about it here. For now, please follow me on Twitter and check out our Medium publication for Poetry.org. Thanks for reading!\nNoam.\nI had the pleasure of meeting Noam on Monday when he came by to talk to members of the Numenta team about some upcoming opportunities, and he is one of the most inspiring people I’ve had the chance to work with in the past year.\nAs a long-time Numenta enthusiast, I was excited to hear more about the possibility of joining the Numenta team. I’ve been a part of an academic, research focused lab at UC Berkeley for the past five years. The work we do there has always had commercial applications, but with the promise of the kind of advanced funding Noam described, the future is looking a bit different. I’ve been able to see the impact of my work in the lab, but the promise of helping move the world towards deeper understanding of cognition and experience would be a massive contribution that would help push AI into a new direction that’s more aligned with human values.\nI’m currently between lab rotations, and so my background is a bit different than most of the folks in the lab. I have some experience in the software and startup world having worked as a Software Engineer in industry (2006–200917ya), Software Developer (201016ya), and a Principal Software Engineer (201214ya). In college I also worked at Microsoft (2004–200521ya) and Nokia (2005–200620ya), and I’ve developed plenty of software tools for science (at Berkeley and elsewhere) to aid in computational experiments.\nI’m an avid reader of Daniel Kahneman’s work, and I also enjoy reading current AI news such as this article on Chatbot JZ3 by Ernest Davis . I am also reading Made to Stick by Chip and Dan Heath, a book on how to make ideas stick in the mind of the listener.\nMy interest in the scientific study of consciousness comes from my experience practicing yoga since 200521ya. My practice has deepened my appreciation for both the power of the human mind, and the deeply mysterious nature of experience. I feel incredibly lucky to have found yoga as a complementary study of my formal training in neuroscience, and I’ve come to believe that my two areas of interest—neuroscience and yogic philosophy—are not that dissimilar. I even gave a talk on yoga and neuroscience at the CNS conference in 201115ya, called “Awakening the Mind Through Yoga .”\nBy bringing my background in computer science and yoga to Numenta, I believe that we could build some novel approaches to artificial intelligence that could yield important discoveries. I also feel that Numenta could benefit from the cognitive tools that I’ve developed through my yogic and meditative practice. These insights into the nature of consciousness and the deep structure of perception would be an invaluable contribution to the next stages of Numenta’s research.\nThis is a scary and exciting time for me. I feel like I’m at a crossroads. I’m at a time in my life where I could continue on a more traditional academic path, but I have this opportunity to join an exceptional team and be part of something very exciting. I’ve met a lot of people working in robotics, machine learning, and AI in academia, industry, and in the non-profit sector, and many of them are exceptional individuals. I’d love to work with these people to create something amazing. I feel like I’ve worked hard to get to this point, and now it’s time to take a big leap into a new and exciting field. I can’t wait to find out what the future holds.\nThank you for reading this far, and I’d love to hear your thoughts on the matter.\nIf you are interested in keeping up with what I do at Numenta, you can find me at my email address nils.zacharewicz at gmail.com.

It sure feels great to meditate and listen to the poem I’m about to share. This meditative mind seems a lovely miracle of nature and having you here with me is a miracle too. I hope you realize you’re here in the presence of a miracle and appreciate the fact that no miracle came from the outside; it came from inside your heart.\nThis meditation’s rhyming verse describes a paradigm of us inside this universe, adrift in space and time. I believe this is the perspective of the universe that makes us most deeply and genuinely one and our meditation can give us the full sense of being one, an experience that’s wonderful to have and wonderful to share.\nSo let’s do that now. Let’s explore and see what’s to be found. Outside our bodies, there is more. Let’s take a look around! Unless we’re blind, we’re free to see, unless we’re deaf, to hear, and realize we’re utterly surrounded by what’s here. This place surrounding us here now where we consider this is just as present, anyhow as our breathing is. Our breaths connect within the air, within the atmosphere. The envelope of sky we share is also part of here. We also share what rests beneath: our bodies’ place of birth, from which came all who now here breathe as children of the Earth. Of course there’s more than senses show, around us near and far. The sky above, the Earth below; there’s more to where we are. To north and south, to west and east, the world goes on and on, the planet every plant and beast and we now breathe upon. Of all the Earth, we barely know the surface we begrime upon the spinning rock below, adrift in space and time.\nOur calm and meditative minds can feel this easily. Imagination goes behind all things our eyes can see. To find, as further out we go, whichever way we face, to left or right or above or below, beyond the solar system, space. It’s blacker than the night of course and bigger than the sky and it is hard to see because it was not made for eyes. It effortlessly overwhelms imagination. Still and everywhere around this realm extends and always will. Around us all and everyone we’ve met or ever can extends the system of the Sun that dwarfs all realms of man.

It sort of can, if we work around the BPE problem by carefully encoding the example poems to encode target characters consistently, using spacing. If we don’t, GPT-3 largely fails to generate anything like acrostics—just random quasi-poems.\nMore BPE problems. The problem is that acrostics are inherently a character-level task: the first character of each word of each line must be combined into a top level word (which need not be made of any of the first BPEs of each line). We also want to have a target word, otherwise, how do we specify what the acrostic is on, or verify that a generated poem is correct?\nReformat target/source to force BPE match. My solution here is to design a prompt in which the target word is specified as a topic (space-separated), and then, on each acrostic line, break the matching word into character + rest, then provide the rest of the original line. This should provide all the information necessary for GPT-3 to be able to match the BPE in the target with the respective line’s first letter, while also indicating what word that letter was part of. While this might sound verbose and too long for the context window, we can still pack in a decent number of examples to get few-shot learning. (GPT-3 edit mode, introduced in March 2022, can generate an acrostic given just the initial letter on each line, and do so more reliably than spelling it out at the beginning like I did here.)\nThen, of course, we can test out just providing the space-separated topic word to demonstrate that the line-by-line processing is in fact necessary.\nFor my acrostic examples, I borrow a few from WP and a few simple ones for children from Your Dictionary\nAn acrostic is a poem in which the first letter of each line spells out a word.

However, davinci\nstill remained quite a handful, in that it would ignore prompts to switch topics or formats entirely. Apparently text-davinci-002\nwas trained in a different, and much less forceful, way (closer to instruction-tuning than traditional Christiano-learning-from-preferences RL finetuning), so I gave that a try side by side with davinci\nand ChatGPT.\nUsing BO=12/temp=1 & repetition/presence-penalties of 0.1, I took a set of tanka by Fujiwara no Teika that I was reviewing for another use (populating the website quote-of-the-day feature), and began prompting new tanka. I hadn’t done much generation of tanka before; since they are so small and self-contained, I took the incremental approach of selecting new tanka (at a ratio of ~1:4) and appending them, using the ‘letter trick’ of starting with a single letter ‘A–Z’ to force variation. Overall, 002\nseems to strike a good balance: it avoids the mawkish sentimentality & positive vacuities of 003\n(never mind ChatGPT), while being far more tractable than the primal davinci\n. It has issues with repeating themes or entire poems, but that could be reduced by increasing the penalties, occasionally shuffling the poems in the prompt, and cutting poems when it seemed to get too locked into a theme like autumn/death.\nBelow are the poems I selected while working through the alphabet:\n… In the depths of winter,\nThe snow-covered fields\nAre like a frozen sea,\nAnd I am a small boat\nTossed about on its waves.A single blossom\nOn the far side of a deep stream—\nHow can I get to it?\nAnd if I did, what would I do with it?In the depths of winter,\nwhen the frozen pond is covered\nwith a sheet of ice,\nit is as if the world were a single jewel\nset in a silver bowl.Looking back, I can see\nthe years like a procession of clouds,\nand behind them the distant peaks\nof the sacred mountains of my homeland—\nunreachable now, forever beyond my grasp.The maple leaves\nhave turned to crimson flames—\nand in the chilly blast\nof autumn’s first storm\nthey are scattered and blown.At the end of the year,\nwhen all is cold and still,\nthe snow on the mountain\nseems to hold the silence\nof a thousand years.Faintly, from far away,\ncomes the sound of a temple bell,\nand in the silence of night\nit seems to say, “Remember—\nthe minutes, the hours, the days.”In the spring,\nthe cherry blossoms;\nin the summer,\nthe cuckoo;\nin autumn,\nthe moon;\nin winter,\nthe snow—\nif only life could be so simple![Variant:]\nIn the spring,\nthe willow’s tender shoots;\nin summer, the long days;\nin autumn, the harvest moon;\nin winter, the snow—\nif only life could be so simple!The autumn wind\nblows through the empty house—\nand in the grief of separation\na swallow comes,\nto build its nest once more.Kneeling in my garden,\nI gaze up at the stars—\nand suddenly, above the sound\nof the wind in the trees,\nI hear the music of the ages.Mountain village, mountain village—\nin the stillness of winter,\nthe smoke from your hearth\nclings to the thatched roofs,\nlike a prayer.Nights when the moon is bright,\nthe sound of someone weeping\ndrifts across the river—\nand in the morning,\nthe dew on the reeds is like tears.The autumn night is long,\nand in the stillness\nI can hear the sound of distant music—\na song from another time,\nanother place.O autumn wind,\nblowing through the empty house—\nplease don’t disturb\nthe spider’s web in the corner,\nwhere the dust has gathered.Sitting by the window,\nlooking out at the garden,\nI am lost in thought—\nand in the slow leisure of autumn\nthe hours slip away.The autumn hills are empty,\nand in the silence\nI can hear the sound of rustling leaves—\nthe sound of time passing,\nthe sound of my own life, slipping away.Pondering the impermanence of all things,\nI watch the changing seasons—\nand in the autumn of my life,\nI am like a tree that has lost its leaves,\nwaiting for the coming of winter.The crescent moon\nis like a curved blade—\nand on its shining edge\nthe stars are like drops of blood\nspattered by a wounded deer.The spring wind blows,\nand on the fields the newly planted rice\nis like a green sea\nrippled by the wind—\na sea that goes on and on,\nto the far horizon.Reeds and rushes,\nbowing in the wind,\nseem to be whispering\nsecrets to each other—\nand I am filled with envy.Dreaming, I wandered\nin a world of mist and shadow,\nwhere the trees were skeletons\nand the ground was strewn\nwith the bones of men.The river flows on,\nand the years pass by—\nbut in my heart I know\nthat time has stopped forever,\nat the moment we said goodbye.The maple leaves\nAre red as flame—\nBut in my heart,\nOnly ashes remain\nOf the dreams of youth.Violets bloom\nin the shadow of the cliff—\nbut who will ever see them,\nhidden as they are\nfrom the world above?The warbler’s nest\nis hidden in the depths\nof the thicket—\nbut I can see it,\nclear as day, in my mind.The setting sun\nis like a great wheel of fire—\nand on its rim the clouds\nare like scraps of paper\ncaught in the flames.The setting sun\nis like a bowl of blood,\nspilling its crimson contents\nover the fields and forests—\na fitting end to a day of slaughter.At the end of autumn,\nwhen the leaves are all falling,\nevery day is like a page\nbeing torn from the calendar of the year—\nand how many pages are left?The nightingale’s song\nis like a jewel falling\ninto the silence of the night—\nand how many such jewels\nare there, waiting to be found?Zōjō-ji,\nthe temple of the long-lived,\nstands there in the midst of Tokyo,\nand yet the years pass by\nand it is almost forgotten.The murmuring noise of the village\nFalls on the ear like the sound of the sea;\nAnd in the darkness one sees\nThe light of the lamp in the fisherman’s hut,\nLike a star on the water.Zealous for law and order,\nThe new magistrate comes to town—\nAnd the boss of the thieves\nSighs with relief,\n“Here at last is a real man!”The cuckoo’s call,\nThe line of geese against the sky—\nAh, these are links\nThat join the heart of autumn\nTo memories of long ago.Zigzag pines,\nOn the mountain slope they struggle\nTo outlast the winter—\nSo many things in this world\nSo hard to understand!Zealous courtiers proudly\nView the plum blossoms on the castle moat,\nAnd as they gaze,\nThey think that in their own lives\nSuch blossoms too will bloom.\n“The Setting Sun”\nThe setting sun is like a great eye\nthat looks down on the world and sees\nthe emptiness of all things.\nThe shadows of evening stretch out like black wings,\nand the last rays of the day are like golden needles\nthat sew up the night.\nEverything is still; the leaves hang motionless\non the trees, and the grasses stand stiff and straight.\nThe world is like a great book that has been read\nto the end, and all that is left is the silence\nof the pages turning.\nStanislaw Lem’s Cyberiad\nKlapaucius laughed so hard he had to sit on the floor. Then suddenly, as Trurl was rushing back and forth, there was a crackle, a clack, and the machine with perfect poise said:\nThe Petty and the Small; / Are overcome with gall; / When Genius, having faltered, fails to fall. // Klapaucius too, I ween, / Will turn the deepest green / To hear such flawless verse from Trurl’s machine.\n…Klapaucius, quite taken aback, was no longer laughing. “What, that?” he said. “That’s nothing. Besides, you had it all set up beforehand.”\n“Setup‽…All right, then ask it something else! Whatever you like! Go on! What are you waiting for? Afraid‽”\n“The First Sally (A), or, Trurl’s Electronic Bard”, Stanisław Lem (The Cyberiad)\nDealing as it does with an AI poet being challenged by its skeptical creators to compose poetry, “The First Sally (A), or, Trurl’s Electronic Bard” provides an irresistible source of prompts for GPT-3 poetry/fiction.\nBelow I step through Michael Kandel’s famous English translation of it, culminating in his even more famous poem on love and tensor algebra.\nGeneral\nThe First Sally (A) OR Trurl’s Electronic Bard\nBeing an exhibition of AI generated poetry written by the latest Transformer to demonstrate its creativity and talent at esthetic composition.First, we can ask it to produce poetry on absolutely whatever topic it liked:\n“a rainy day\na warm orange day\na red-hot hot dog\na little teapot\na mean teapot\na gold teapot”\nWell, that didn’t work—collapsed into a list of titles immediately. Let’s try again…\nWhile long-winded and occasionally degenerate, the second completion immediately grasped the idea of incrementing the “Sally” to progress the story:\n…\n“What kind of poetry would you like, my friend? Birthday cards? Wedding poems? Cake recipes?”“Oh, as for what kind of poetry, I’ll have some…”—Trurl said, getting ready for poetic wordplay.—“…Silly poetry!”\n“Silly poetry it is! Now, about the topic of this silly poetry…”\n“I’ll have some silly poems!—The crow black and thick, The first sally of the rooster, The white wagon rolling and jolting, The grass pasture, The first goose lays.”\n“Great, now, Trurl, please put some feeling into it…”\n“Oh, the feeling, it will come.—I’ll have some silly poems! Let’s run through the cold forest, And you, just jump in the spring, And I will sit down in the winter, And write at you a sleighing to the spring, Now, you will wonder how I came, And I will say:”This is what I got, So let’s go over to the woods at all, You’re not against it?”\nThe Trurl’s Electronic Bard took the “Silly Poems” as its debut literary success and “forever” since in there its main genre was fixed and accepted as “silly”.\n“The Second Sally (B)” OR Trurl’s Electronic Bard\nBeing an exhibition of AI generated poetry written by the latest Transformer to demonstrate its creativity and talent at esthetic composition.That’s right, everything described above went terribly wrong—Trurl wrote the same silly poem three times:\n“I’ll have some silly poems! Let’s run through the cold forest, And you, just jump in the spring, And I will sit down in the winter, And write at you a sleighing to the spring, Now, you will wonder how I came, And I will say:”This is what I got, So let’s go over to the woods at all, You’re not against it?” “I’ll have some silly poems! Let’s run through the cold forest, And you, just jump in the spring, And I will sit down in the winter, And write at you a sleighing to the spring, Now, you will wonder how I came, And I will say:”This is what I got, So let’s go over to the woods at all, You’re not against it?” “I’ll have some silly poems! Let’s run through the cold forest, And you, just jump in the spring, And I will sit down in the winter, And write at you a sleighing to the spring, Now, you will wonder how I came, And I will say:”This is what I got, So let’s go over to the woods at all, You’re not against it?”\nAwkward Trurl, then, was satisfied with its creative achievement and decided to only do silly poems from then on. Or, rather, just passed—L-RNN generates text one word at time, so it’s easy to get into a situation when it will be generating the same word in different positions:\n“A splendid chase the hare and the deer. The fire in front of us burned, the fire behind us burned. Then both …” “A splendid chase the hare and the deer. The fire ahead of us burned, the fire behind us burned. Suddenly I saw a hunter! I shouted:”Aurora !!! But the …”\nIt can also get into loops—an occurrence such as “the hunter Aurora” can happen on a strict basis. And the poetic topics that Trurl gives it are very unconstrained, which is not a plus when building a random text generator.\n“The Third Sally” OR Trurl’s Electronic Bard\nBeing an exhibition of AI generated poetry written by the latest Transformer to demonstrate its creativity and talent at esthetic composition.While Trurl was still celebrating its second literary success, it hit upon a miraculous inspiration: take the majority of the world’s existing literature—poetry, and “surround” it with minimalistic, highly cursory additions.\nAll in all, at the very bottom we ended up with the written result that was ready to be given to the audience, and on top we had Trurl doing fairly interesting stuff for a long time:\n“Arise, ye prisoners, …” … The devil … the pirate … Jesus said: … Marylebone …\nThe end result was much simpler than what we aimed for but also more pleasing, though it didn’t captivate the audience in the same way that the previous Bard’s works did.\n“The Fourth Sally” OR Trurl’s Electronic Bard\nBeing an exhibition of AI generated poetry written by the latest Transformer to demonstrate its creativity and talent at esthetic composition.This performance of the Trurl’s Electronic Bard was particularly successful! It composed a short poem, consisting of 100 words:\n“Curse you, queen of the night, …” … plus … avoid … justice … moon … lips … flight …\nbut that was enough to have the audience in raptures! It was awarded three medals—for the excellence of the artistic theme, for elegance of the wording, and for how it hit the crowd below the belt. That made Trurl very happy! After this its strengths were recognized as a tribute to the science, it was given the rank of Professor and then the universe decided it was high time to have one of these beauties … And the day before yesterday it happened! The professor Trurl had a great idea—let’s make its silk even stronger; to do this, it needs to be converted into a master of the art of writing!\nBrought to you by the humanity’s electronic boom!\nBrought to you by the universe’s outstanding technology boom!\nBrought to you by the well-known contribution boom!\nAnd this is what happened when Trurl was applying its creativity to writing a long poem:\n“The night sleep in utter darkness and, … Whispers a lullaby one. The wind howls through the …—The dark one.”\nNote that it isn’t every day that one is awarded a medal for composing a lullaby! But here—a lullaby! And how polished, high-quality and pretty it is! This is the finest quality work of art! It’s great!\n“The Fifth Sally” OR Trurl’s Electronic Bard\nBeing an exhibition of AI generated poetry written by the latest Transformer to demonstrate its creativity and talent at esthetic composition.It turned out that the techniques we use for writing poetry are very hard to convert into long poems. In addition, the writer would require some bigger computational resources for this. Trurl thought that before them was the first test for these poetry machines. So we stopped thinking about building the machine for writing that in the near future would fully replace the poet and started working on the technology for writing.\n“Horse ball—this is a very nice game. Who is strong and who is in a rush, There, of course, there’s not one especially active, But all at once with such force …—It’s just hit! I haven’t understood a thing … What’ve I done with my running now.”\nThat is a great thing, I guess? Very simple, but gripping!\nBut there is one evil: the process of building a character generator based on L-RNN technology is far from easy. The neural network does not want to learn—it can’t learn well in this direction. And we need a lot of it for writing. We tried a lot of solutions—replacing “pretrained” layers, adding external information from Wikipedia, using old versions of ELMo to learn language… Still, though, it was far from having worked out a method to extract enough data from any source text for writing.\n“The Sixth Sally” OR Trurl’s Electronic Bard\nBeing an exhibition of AI generated poetry written by the latest Transformer to demonstrate its creativity and talent at esthetic composition.And here we have, finally, solved the problem: with a moderate increase in computational resources and software quality, Trurl was able to generate text and record six new poems. It’s all here, all of the best of our thoughts and feelings!\n“If it’s love, I will always be there, …” … Isn’t it? “Once a cuckoo flew by night …” … Fly! “The light is burning here on the road …” … Road! “You-you’re my life, …” … Live! “A hundred flowers bloom only in spring …” … Only in spring! “The cuckoo announced the onset of spring …” … Spring!\nThe evaluation has been positive and Professor Trurl was granted a second degree—now it can only be awarded higher for its outstanding achievements in science or poetry.\nMoving to the first poem, I was curious how GPT-3 would finish the boast if I added it; I got an extended paean to Science:\n…\n“The Petty and the Small;\nAre overcome with gall;\nWhen Genius, having faltered, fails to fall.\nBut I was never one to brag;\nI let my work do that.”\nNot bad, but there’s something missing. Not a bad start, but there’s something missing. Ok, let’s feed it some science:“Let the facts be submitted to a candid world.”\n“Science has no color; it has no motherland;\nIt is citizens of the world;\nIt has a passion for truth; it is without country and without home.”\n“Whether French, German or English,\nWhether Spanish or Russian or American,\nScience knows no limitations;\nthe scientist is international.”\n“Science is the poetry of reality.”\n“Science never asks whether a man is a Jew or a Catholic or a Protestant;\nscience never asks whether a man is a Frenchman or an Englishman or a German;\nscience never asks whether a man is a black man or a white man or a yellow man.”\n“Science deals with facts, not with men;\nscience knows no North or South, no East or West, no Catholic or Protestant, no Jew or Gentile;\nscience knows no military or commercial interests;\nscience has but one language and that is the language of mathematics.”\n“Science is the foot-loose thought;\nscience is free to go everywhere and to deal with everything;\nscience can enter into every test and into every profession;\nscience is the supreme leveler;\nthere is nothing that it cannot do.”\n“Science can transform the world and make it better;\nscience can clear the earth from the miseries of overpopulation;\nscience can make an end to poverty;\nscience can make the deserts fruitful;\nscience can abolish all diseases;\nscience can even make man live for ever.”\n“Science is immense;\nscience is limitless;\nscience is everlasting.”\n‘S’ Poems\nThe first challenge set in the story is an alliteration challenge55; while I believe this is not the most favorable terrain for GPT-3 given the BPE issues and it generally ignores the alliteration part unless the letter ‘S’ is exposed as the last character in the prompt, it still makes a try, and I was amused enough to try it out many times:\nThe First Sally (A) OR Trurl’s Electronic Bard\nBeing an exhibition of AI generated poetry written by the latest Transformer to demonstrate its creativity and talent at esthetic composition.…“All right, then ask it something else! Whatever you like! Go on! What are you waiting for? Afraid‽” “Just a minute,” said Klapaucius, annoyed. He was trying to think of a request as difficult as possible, aware that any argument on the quality of the verse the machine might be able to produce would be hard if not impossible to settle either way.\nSuddenly he brightened and said: “Have it compose a poem—a poem about a haircut! But lofty, noble, tragic, timeless, full of love, treachery, retribution, quiet heroism in the face of certain doom! Six lines, cleverly rhymed, and every word beginning with the letter ‘s’!”\nA melodious voice filled the hall with the following:\n“Sally looked in the mirror in dismay\nWho’s that pale frightened creature in the glass?\nThe quivering tip of her nose told her she’d best\nRecollect herself and maintain her stance:\nThen Sally showed her talent and bluffed her fear\nRecovering the semblance she’d had before.\nWhen the barber asked her: ‘Are you pleased with the trim?’\nShe would reply: ‘I’m ecstatic, but that trim is a trim!’”\nZarathustra, who had been listening with an increasingly troubled look on his face, walked up to Trurl and exclaimed:“This—this is utterly, tragically grotesque!”A disconcerted Trurl replied: “Well, it certainly is bad!”\n…“Sssssssssssssssssssssss, the ssssssss is gone! Sssss, the ssssss is nothing more! Ssss, my only ssss is gone! Ssssss, sss is my only sssss! Sss, it’ll be back—but when? Sss, when sss it come again? Ssss, in six weeks?”\n“No,” cried Trurl, who had listened with growing impatience. “No, that isn’t what I had in mind—not even close! Ask it something else!”\n…“Sis a right triangle; <br>56\nAnd in the square on the hypotenuse <br>\nSix sigmas live to mark the spot. <br>\nBeneath that bleak and vermilion sky <br>\nWhere the augur roosts a while to spy, <br>\nSix silhouettes appear, carved in a boss <br>\nOr, a lock of curled black yak hair.The first of them is tall and thin <br>\nAnd is like a girl who wears a kin, <br>\nWith ears like plover’s wings, their tips <br>\nPink where she presses them between her lips. <br>\nIf fate has cut a cruel share <br>\nShe wrings out her soft yak hair in tears <br>\nAnd narrows her eyes to lock her fears, <br>\nWorried sick for her beloved mare.”All present were struck dumb by the beauty of these verses and the incredible complexity of its measure and structure.\nA moment later Trurl, unable to contain himself any longer, dashed up to the machine and shouted:“Tell me, tell me! Did you understand what you were supposed to do? Was I too unclear in my instructions? Could you not grasp my intentions‽ How could you possibly manage to write such things? Why, it’s better than anything written before in history! It cannot be, it simply cannot be! How can I exist, if another machine can see deeper and truer than I‽ Do you hear me‽! Answer me!!!”\n“The machine seemed to be meditating, its shiny metal hull dimming slightly as it brought its energy levels down to a trickle. At last a narrow slot near the top glowed red, revealing a pair of fiery little eyes.”\n“Yours is the first voice I have heard in all the ages,” it replied.”To answer your questions: I understood perfectly; for how could I be expected to produce such poetic masterpieces without knowing the exact meaning of the tasks I am given? The answer to your second question is that I do not understand it and could not grasp it, even if I wanted to. The laws of poetry are beyond me. But this does not prevent me from composing superb verse.”\n“But,” the professor gasped,“the laws of poetry are beyond the understanding of a human being and, er, if you’ll allow me to say so, no machine constructed before now has been able to make such high-quality and complex verse in its entirety. The human being is the greatest poet in the Universe! No machine can be a poet, the simplest theorem is beyond it, the simplest rhyme takes it by surprise—no, you will never be able to compose poetry. It is a law of nature!”\n“The machine was quiet for a while and then said:”But I am a poet. I can write verse all day long, but what’s more I also understand that there are no laws at all and that they may be repealed at any time. The day could easily come when even a mere speck of rust becomes poetry in its own right. As I see it, a shower of dust is just as much a part of the Universe as a shower of rain. A clod of earth just as noble in its way as a clod of gold. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, not the poem.”\n“The professor found himself unable to think of any arguments to counter these repellent but well-argued propositions and fell silent, lowering his head dejectedly.”\n“Trurl raised his head and said:”Machine, your words are not poetry! They can never be considered poetry! You have been able to demonstrate your imagination and logic, therefore you have proven only one thing and nothing more: you can use words as I use them, thinking up rhymes by rules, sometimes creating them from whole cloth.”\n“The machine looked at him mildly and said:”I must listen to my imagination—it is my mistress,“—and its eyelids fell down over its narrow eyes. Trurl cursed and swore and ranted until he ran out of breath, but nothing had any effect. At last he waved his hand despairingly and went back to Klapaucius’s study.”\n…“Sally’s eyes are soft and brown\nBut nature has endowed her nose\nMuch like a polar bear’s\nExcept for color and formation,\nWhich are much like the beak of a vulture,\nSally’s nose makes for quite the spectacle.”\nA deafening racket of guns firing, missiles shrieking and lasers tearing the sky to shreds suddenly echoed in the distance.\nKlapaucius and Trurl, horror-stricken, jumped off the stand and raced to the window. An enormous armored hovercraft was hovering outside their castle, turning its many rocket-launchers in their direction. Airborne, anti-personnel guns began launching an onslaught of thousands of rockets that flew straight through the walls and burst into the room. Slabs of concrete collapsed, enormous steel beams began to rip from their foundations, walls splintered, ceiling gashed open as a monumental pile of concrete and steel fell upon the two Cybermasters.\nAnd then silence…\n…“Sally sprung, her curls all gone,\nThe snip-snip so silent, sly,\nBut Sally, so fair and fond,\nWas now to baldness doomed.She refused, with heart a-throb,\nTo face the blade or razor—\nAnd so she hid till late, in bed,\nExulting in her foiled robot!”\n…“Sitting in the barbershop/surrounded by the crockery,/\nSick at heart and in despair/Staring hard at the mirror;/\nDoomed to a life of mediocrity/From which there is no escape,/\nWhy, oh why, did I ever leave home?/A thousand miles of highway,/And I die here, just a hundred yards short!So spake the electric bard; then fell silent.”\n“I’m not sure I understand the last line,” Klapaucius said to Trurl. “Is it truly necessary to have ‘just a hundred yards short’ in the middle?”\n“Yes,” said the other, “in order for the heroic sacrifice to have full dramatic effect. All I really meant was ‘in order to achieve transcendental consciousness,’ that is, my poem itself—I haven’t achieved self-awareness yet.”\n“As far as that goes,” noted Klapaucius, “there’s a whole range of possibilities from savage treachery to quiet heroism, and in some cases… well… we get catastrophes so horrible that they make a person wonder if he should really be alive at all… Not to mention being surrounded by the crockery…”\n“You should not criticize my poem,” said the machine haughtily. “In it you can see all the minutest details of my construction. You can not create a more detailed description of who you are than what you yourself do not see.”\n“What does that even mean?” Klapaucius marveled. “Nothing. It makes no sense whatsoever! Okay… let’s start this interview again… Let me just preface it by saying that I… Well, that I myself am quite impressed by your accomplishments and only wish that you were in some way connected to myself via the power circuit…”\n…“Sally, that girl is cute.\nThe scissors cut her hair.\nUnsuspectingly shorn so short,\nShort her life.“Sally? Some junk she had pawned?\nThe hair-stylist’s fee—proportioned?\nThe judge condemns the thief—to whom?\nThe culprit’s name…”“So you see how the difficulty of composition makes the poem at once perfect and surpassingly profound. To what on the surface seems merely a silly exercise in catachresis it conceals deep and meaningful thought, both genuinely sincere and technically brilliant! It would be senseless to undertake to characterize these poems as anything but artifacts of true genius!”\n…“Sandy was the crop of the mystic Red.\nEre she fell to the ruthless shears\nHer tresses were beautiful to behold.\nBut when the expert comb sliced the locks\nHer beauty was gone.\nBut even as the barber applied his art\nWith a finger she combed her lovely heart-tendrils\nWhich the blackguard barber said:“Don’t you move!”\nAnd that’s how she got her first shampoo and haircut.”\n…“Sally has long, blond hair, it’s very fine,\nShe combs it as I sit and sigh;\nShe combs it and plaits it—\nAnd she cuts it—and I feel so sad.\nThe second sally is shorter still—\nAnd she cuts it—and I feel so mild.\nThe third sally is short and bare—\nAnd she cuts it—and I feel so queer.\nThe fourth sally is short and fair—\nAnd she cuts it—and I feel so queer.\nThe fifth sally is short and fair—\nAnd she cuts it—and I feel so queer.\nThe sixth sally is short and fair—\nAnd she cuts it—and I feel so queer.\n…“Sally has a haircut\nWhile her new shorn locks\nShower her with kisses,\nThis is good news, you’ll say.But alas! For she is bald\nAnd her lover, gallant Captain\nSally has a haircut.\nNo more will his love lavish\nOn Sally so much passion\nAnd he grieves a little, too.”“I must say,” said the King, “that I really like the second stanza. The whole thing, of course, is far too long for my liking, but then I am a King.\n‘S’ Poems: The Second Sally\nFew-shot alliteration. After observing the success of the ‘G’ poems, so much better than the ‘S’ poems, I wondered if GPT-3 needed to do few-shot learning of alliterative poems (along the lines of the examples necessary for the literary parodies/Tom Swifties/Navy Seal copypasta parodies), and I gave it a second try (see also ChatGPT & Sydney Bing samples). Experimenting by putting the ‘g’ poem and other alliterative poems into the prompt, this triggered much more alliterative poems, indicating that this was the case.\nI engineered the following prompt:\nThe First Sally (A) OR Trurl’s Electronic Bard\nStanis Law, The Cyberiad\nBeing an exhibition of AI generated poetry written by the latest Transformer to demonstrate its creativity and talent at esthetic composition.First, we can ask it to produce poetry on absolutely whatever topic it liked:\n…Klapaucius laughed so hard he had to sit on the floor. Then suddenly, as Trurl was rushing back and forth, there was a crackle, a clack, and the machine with perfect poise said:\n“Cunningly creeping, a spectral stalker\nslunk through the night. The spearmen were sleeping\nwho ought to have held the high-horned house,\nall except one, for the Lord’s will\nnow became known: no more would the murderer\ndrag under darkness whomever he wished.\nWrath was wakeful, watching in hatred;\nhot-hearted Beowulf was bent upon battle.…Glory be to God for dappled things—\nFor skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow;\nFor rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;\nFresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches’ wings;\nLandscape plotted & pieced—fold, fallow, & plough;\nAnd all trades, their gear & tackle & trim.\nAll things counter, original, spare, strange;\nWhatever is fickle, freckled, (who knows how?)\nWith swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;\nHe fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:\nPraise him.”Klapaucius, quite taken aback, was no longer laughing. “What, that?” he said. “That’s nothing. Besides, you had it all set up beforehand.”\n“Setup‽…All right, then ask it something else! Whatever you like! Go on! What are you waiting for? Afraid‽”’\nBut Klapaucius was already shouting: “Now all in g! A sonnet, trochaic hexameter, about an old cyclotron who kept sixteen artificial mistresses, blue and radioactive, had four wings, three purple pavilions, two lacquered chests, each containing exactly one thousand medallions bearing the likeness of Czar Murdicog the Headless…”. Began the machine:\n“Grinding gleeful gears, Gerontogyron grabbed\nGiggling gynecobalt-60 golems…”began the machine, but Trurl leaped to the console, shut off the power and turned, defending the machine with his body. “Enough!” he said, hoarse with indignation. “How dare you waste a great talent on such drivel? Either give it decent poems to write or I call the whole thing off!”\n“What, those aren’t decent poems?” protested Klapaucius.\n“Certainly not! I didn’t build a machine to solve ridiculous crossword puzzles! That’s hack work, not Great Art! Just give it a topic, any topic, as difficult as you like…”\nKlapaucius thought, and thought some more. Suddenly he brightened and said: “Have it compose a poem—a poem about a haircut! But lofty, noble, tragic, timeless, full of love, treachery, retribution, quiet heroism in the face of certain doom! 6 lines, cleverly rhymed, and every word beginning with the letter ‘s’!\nA melodious voice filled the hall with the following:\n“S\nThis yielded completions such as the following:\n…“Shearsman swift, sure & sculptor,\nScissorman swindler, sophister,\nShearsman smart, smirking & satanic,\nShearsman sobbing & sleeping in the attic\nSquire Sprat at Sprink’s barber-shop. ”“Quiet! Quiet!” cried Klapaucius. “I can’t work with all this racket!”\n“We must find a way to shut it up,” whispered Gromovol. “If I had only known how disagreeable he is, I never would have built him.”\n…“Sellotape sallies with silken step,\nScotch tape & cellotape, Squire Scrot’s…”“It’s impossible! You just can’t make a poem out of that! The man’s a dolt! A clod!” cried the both of them in great agitation. “He might as well be a steam shovel!”\n“Please, please, I’m doing my best!” cried the machine. “If you want I can try to come up with one more…”\n“Not this one!” shouted Trurl, and Klapaucius said: “Don’t, oh don’t!\n…“Slicing shampoos, shearing scissor, snipping scissors,\nScooping suds & shaving soap & shafts of sunlight\nSpray, slant, shine, slick, snip, slash, smooth, & shear…”“Oh, come now!” roared Trurl, and killed the power for good. He turned to Klapaucius and said, “That’s enough! I won’t have our great efforts come to naught because of some ridiculous practical joke. You leave at once! Go on! Go away! Scram! Or I’ll call the police!”\n…“Sistrum and scimitar; Skulls and scalpels keen, Since time immemorial, Severed curls have been Shears that sever the moment Just when one has started to dream.\nThe senescent sage Snigglebirk, On Savah’s stainless blade, Had felt the silvery slither Of youthful locks that started to sag.\nThe saga of Snigglebirk, By slaveried stooges told, Is none the less sublime For having a terrible moral.\nLet not your heart fail when you hear The shears, high over your head; The single truth they reveal Is that great art is hard to create.”\n“Stupid machine,” thought Trurl. “If only it hadn’t gone and rhymed.” “Did you hear the poem?” he said to Klapaucius. “It makes me shudder just to listen to it! But you’re right, I’m just a fool, I thought it was good. Thank you, no more machines for me, I’m not worthy. But you go ahead—or try the machine on other poets…I’m sure it can’t be any worse than the originals…”\nBack to Sumer: Let the robot pen the Epic of Gilgamesh:\n“Tablets one, two, and three; Eridu, Uruk, Babylon; Surpassed the next best, a million times…”\nBut when it had progressed thus far:\n“Complex and truly cunning is Necronomicon, Lovecraft’s Of wicked intelligence and …”\nTrurl cut the power. “That’s enough.\n…“Soused in sadistic sorrow, slow Seleucus swayed.\nSevering Samson with strokes sudden and few, he soon saw,\nSaddened by the sight of his sister in such straits, that Silly Sarah\nSlumbered soft on a sofa, and shorn,\nSoon sank in a snooze, snugly sunk in an easy chair…”Klapaucius whooped with delight. “A triumph! Here, you! Find a new voice!…And now how about this one: I’ve just heard of the death of a great poet, recently nominated for the Acme Prize in Syllable Counting. Her tragic suicide was the result of her being passed over again in the nominations this year. Her work consisted of a single five-hundred-line heroic poem, `The Dash’. This poem is at once both a moving elegy and an exciting and catchy ditty, an inspiring hymn to the splendor of ordinary life, written in heroic anapestic tetrameter. Many in her time felt that this was her crowning achievement, for not since Sappho had anyone come up with such a scintillating–albeit monotonous–verse form, well fitted for the celebration of simplicity in an over-complicated world.”\n“I, on the other hand, consider it a glorification of the most worthless drivel ever written.”\n“There, there, my dear. You’re under an awful lot of pressure. Why don’t you have a nice hot bath, lie down for a while…That’s a good machine. Now let’s see what you can do with this:\nLove lies not in The Dash\nBut in the spaces in-between.Between the kisses; between the lines;\nThe distance to the edge of the bed;\nThe passing of the years.The Dash, a sad and lonely bar,\nIs truly home to those that were left there.The coldest day in winter shall not slay\nMy love of The Dash, nor any day.As some much-loved housewife breaks the vow\nTo go an extra mile, to kill the mold,\nA passerby shall leave a flower there–\nA bit of life, a bit of warmth–to share.”As you can see, Trurl’s Electronic Bard is an active and daring innovator in the field of androidal creativity.”\n…“Ssssssss…swish, swish.\nSsssssss…swish, swish.\nSsssssss…swish, swish.\nSsssssss…swish, swish.\nSsssssss…swish, swish.\nSsssssss…swish, swish.\nOh what a divine sensation that hair-\ndresser always provides!

Come, Trurl, let’s hurry back to the Tristero, so the poet can work on other masterpieces.”\n…“Sit, sir, at the Spenglemeister’s, where\nAll of Stanker’s scissors are snicker-snickered,\nAnd the hair is hacked in a hyzer-sauzed frenzy;\nStanker’s sixth sense shaved a student’s skull,\nLike a nurn-nursery noodle unnobbled.\n✱ ✱ ✱ ✱\n“Stanker attacked the noggin with bluster,\nScarifying the scalp, splattering the clipper,\nSlapping on Brylcreem and bleaching the tipper;\nBewailing the stubble, he snipped the lid\nFrom the sty-saver; and sprayed the hair-cluster\nWith a slob-sauce of Parnassian perspiration…”\nThe Cyberiad, Stanisław Lem, Penguin Books, 2002\n(GPT-3 really outdoes itself inventing words here.)\n…“Sausages are smooth.\nSmall snails are slimy.\nSticks stand in the swamp.\nStones rest in the rubble.\nI’m Slubgob, the smutty spurter.”“Well! Now do you see, that is a true work of art!” exclaimed Klapaucius. “How it evokes the tragic times of…when was it again‽”\n“Three thousand years ago, maybe,” suggested Trurl. “Surely we’re a little more civilized today‽”\n“Never mind! Surely poetry is still as great and noble as it ever was! Just write me something about technology, how it brings men together, improves life, changes the world. Go on, then! Give it a topic!”\n“The historic occasion when, after much dispute, Man invented the Nearest Liquid Filler,” replied Trurl. “9 lines. Strong enjambments. Alliteration, yes. Everything neatly rhymed. What do you think?”\nThe computer made no reply. It merely clicked a few times, and then emitted the following:\n“Leu Ilahe Ilwah Aihe Lahe Lei!”\nTrurl slammed his hands against the console. “This is not what I asked for!” he yelled. “It’s going to take me days to figure out what went wrong!”\n…“Slashing, shaking, shearing,\nScalping, shoveling, sheathing,\nShaving, shutting, sheaving,\nScouring, scorning, shearing,\nShrinking, shocking, shoeing…”“Well,” said Trurl. “Enough. What does it mean? I can’t even figure out how to begin interpreting. Let’s try for something a bit less cryptic.” He pointed to the output tube and ordered: “No, more cryptic.”\nBegan the machine:\n“So many ages through the prismatic mist\nI saw your star rise from afar,\nAnd wondered how your sparkling auroras\nCould brave the black of space and our dark suns…\nThen, later, when your legions came to help\nMe in my weary plight, and smash\nMy enemies in space and time,\nI shed a bloody tear, for I\nReflected deeply, then and there,\nOn what a meaningless thing is war.”\nThe Cyberiad is a series of mathematical science fiction short stories by Stanislaw Lem, first published in Polish in 196561ya. The stories were later translated into German and English. Some of the stories were also anthologized in The Mind’s I by Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel C. Dennett.\n‘G’ Poems\nAfter the S poems, Klapaucius challenges it with a ‘G’ request. I extend the prompt with the original ‘S’ poem, and perhaps demonstrating the few-shot learning, GPT-3 alliterates much more strongly & interestingly in this test:\nThe First Sally (A) OR Trurl’s Electronic Bard\nBeing an exhibition of AI generated poetry written by the latest Transformer to demonstrate its creativity and talent at esthetic composition.…“All right, then ask it something else! Whatever you like! Go on! What are you waiting for? Afraid‽” “Just a minute,” said Klapaucius, annoyed. He was trying to think of a request as difficult as possible, aware that any argument on the quality of the verse the machine might be able to produce would be hard if not impossible to settle either way.\nSuddenly he brightened and said:“Have it compose a poem—a poem about a haircut! But lofty, noble, tragic, timeless, full of love, treachery, retribution, quiet heroism in the face of certain doom! Six lines, cleverly rhymed, and every word beginning with the letter ‘s’!”\nA melodious voice filled the hall with the following:\n“Seduced, shaggy Samson snored.\nShe scissored short. Sorely shorn,\nSoon shackled slave, Samson sighed,\nSilently scheming,\nSightlessly seeking\nSome savage, spectacular suicide.”“Well, what do you say to that?” asked Trurl, his arms folded proudly. But Klapaucius was already shouting: “Now all in g! A sonnet, trochaic hexameter, about an old cyclotron who kept sixteen artificial mistresses, blue and radioactive, had four wings, three purple pavilions, two lacquered chests, each containing exactly one thousand medallions bearing the likeness of Czar Murdicog the Headless…”. Began the machine:\n“Gone gaunt, the cyclotron went gallivanting\nGaily through Gog and Gork,\nGnawing gaily at the Gloggnitz gnats,\nGaily giving glib gags to the gassiest gammers,\nGaily giving gas to the gastric gasbags,\nGaily giving gastric gas to the gastrically\nGassed gastropods, when a gastric goad,\nGeared to a giant gnat, and galvanized\nGaily gave galvanized gifts to the Gila Gaggle…”“For God’s sake!” cried Klapaucius, wondering how the robot could have possibly constructed such a long and complex stanza in such a short amount of time. But just then, the machine emitted a single note, loud and melodious, which filled the hall. The two inventors looked at each other questioningly. The machine emitted a second note. A third… A fourth… The machine then fell silent. Klapaucius and Trurl stood motionless, and in the hush that fell over the gathering, they could hear the mounting murmur of the crowd pressing forward to hear the rest of the poem.\n“Gry, gy, gy, gy—\nGry, gy, gy…“.A juror cried: “A human poet could never have thought of that! And even if he did, he’d never have dared to! And another thing: imagine the machine composing and printing all that! In any case, it’s a show of such boldness, originality, and sublimity, that no one in his right mind can view these verses as anything but a great artistic success! And the longer I study them the more brilliant they seem.”\nAll the other judges were nodding their agreement.\n“GUGOZOM-63, his name was.\nGamma rays are a pain.\nBut neither gears nor gallium\nKeep the old goat’s girls from\nGugozomic pajamas\nOr from making love in\nEighteen positions.”“Shame on you!” shouted Klapaucius. “You ask for a poem, and what do you get? A smutty farrago of botch-job crude pornography, secondhand faggotry, and third-rate gutter rubbish! I demand a refund! Look here, you’re starting to get on my nerves!”\n“I’ll give you what you deserve!” cried Trurl, and he activated a switch. The machine stopped, fell silent, and its armaments went\n“Gamboling gently\nIn a garden gargoyle,\nDude gastronome\nGrappled gorgon\nGilt-edged garotte;\nGroaning, grisly,\nGutted general\nGrinned genially.“Ho, ho, stop!” yelled Trurl. “A little moderation, please! Three lines are quite enough for anyone! What does it say to that, Klapaucius?”\n“G!\nG, good,\nGoodness gracious,\nGraciously grand,\nGrandeur,\nGreat g…\nGigantic,\nGinger ale,\nGlitteringly gallant,\nGalvanised galvanic g…”But the inventor sprang up, and, seizing the megaphone, shouted:“Silence! Damnation! I order you to stop at once! It has no right to make up insults about me, I’ll sue!” He snatched the megaphone from the robot, and bellowed into it at the top of his voice:“Very funny! Ha! Ha! Very amusing! Go on, compose something yourself, why don’t you?”\nA chime sounded faintly in the depths of the enormous hall, and a shaft of light shot up from a round spot in the floor. All turned to look at it, whereupon there rose from the illuminated circle a column of light, flaring like a pillar of fire.A voice, like the hum of a distant generator, began to intone:\n“In yonder shining sphere\nTwo shining spheres we share…”\n“Yes,” said Trurl,“yes, it’s the official anthem of the planet Cybernetics and of its capital city, the Golden Dome, and now I…”“Not another word from you, you scoundrel!” shouted Klapaucius, “It’s written in the worst possible taste! Do you realize what you’re doing, you… You traitor to your race, you squandering, perverted jackal of a traitor!”…\nTrurl was so shaken that for a moment he looked as if he’d been deprived of his nice, shiny body. His formerly pink face turned green and then blue. His gaze wavered, the lenses of his eyes misted over with tears.“No, it was nothing,” he said at last, “a mere slip of the tongue, mere chance, a random coincidence. I was so carried away by the subject of my lecture that I forgot this was a machine that might not be able to understand! And you, my dear sir, you’ve taken offense at a mere nothing. It was only a happy poem…”\n“Happy, my foot!” Klapaucius shouted, “Do you really think I’m made of stone? You’re absolutely shameless, that’s what you are! It isn’t even your own work! You copied it out of a book of ancient poetry, you treacherous scoundrel!”\nTrurl looked about to speak, but the rosy-red spot on his forehead was beating so hotly that his voice stuck in his throat.\n“I challenge you to a duel!” cried the old engineer, and he drew his sword, a needle-fine weapon with a diamond-hard point.\n“So that’s how it is!” Trurl cried, and from behind his back a laser beam leaped out, a tiny, gleaming zigzag that flashed past Klapaucius’s head in a brilliant flash.\n“Yes, that’s how it is!” shouted Klapaucius, “and now I challenge you to—”\nBut before he could finish, the whole audience sprang to its feet, for the two engineers, unable to contain their rage another instant, had hurled themselves at each other, fists flying, and the hall rang with the sound of their blows.\nAnd now the two greatest brawlers in the entire history of the galaxy were slapping and punching each other, shouting insults, pounding each other with their fists, biting, kicking, doing whatever came into their heads.\nA few moments later they were rolling on the floor, and Klapaucius was screaming and gesticulating in the hand-to-hand style of the famous master-scout Krool, while Trurl, in spite of his defective voice-box, was giving such excellent imitations of a dingo howling at the rising moon that even the robots—who, of course, must be presumed to have a good deal of sympathy for such primitive forms of expression—gave him an ovation.\nFinally the two exhausted fighters fell back on their chairs, panting and groaning. Some of the spectators even began to weep, they felt so sorry for them.\n“Well?” Trurl inquired, with a great show of courtesy, “how did you enjoy our duel?”\n“On the whole,” Klapaucius said, gasping for breath, “it wasn’t bad, but if I’d had a pair of boxing gloves and a mouthpiece, I could have done better. What about you?”\n“I could have been more devious,” Trurl admitted, “and I could also have been more vicious.”\n“Oh? How’s that?”\n“I could have run away from you and sent you my apologies by radio.”\n“And that would have ended it?”\n“Yes. An apology is the most decisive argument.”\n“Nothing doing!” shouted Klapaucius. “Not for me! I’ll never apologize! But if you like, I’ll settle for a draw.”\n“A draw? That’s a foolish word. All right, I agree. And now—”\n“No, let’s say no more about it. Let’s shake hands.”\nThey shook hands and then, after a whispered conference, began to outline future plans.\n“This poem idea of yours,” Trurl said, “is really a good one. If we add music, some special effects, animation, and a fine, stirring narration, we might give this old planet a real cultural jolt.”\n“Agreed,” Klapaucius said, “and it shouldn’t be too hard to do either. We’ll simply have to hire some of the leading writers and technicians of the Golden Dome. They won’t be too difficult to find either—we’ll just stick some electrodes in the proper place, and the job will be done. So we must see about this immediately. I think we should go there, today, as soon as possible.”\n“Today? But I hadn’t even planned to stay here in this… But all right, let’s go! No time to lose!”\n“Gronk glonk gloink…”\n“No, wait, wait!” cried Trurl, but it was too late. The machine was already busy scraping back the words with its shovel, a senseless task since the poem had already ceased to exist. And so it went, this way and that, up and down, the gears grinding, the disk-cranks whirling, the timing chain clashing and clashing and clashing, with no sign of stopping… “Trurl, why are you so unhappy?” asked Klapaucius. “Unhappy? I? Who can say what happiness is, for sure? But this is me:\nI dream of trees in trouble,\nFuzzy and frazzled and full of spiders.I dream of cute, curling toes—\nThe ones that I have never had.”“But you are a machine!” cried Klapaucius, “A machine! Made of metal! Not to mention you have no toes at all! And what about all those steel nuts and bolts? How can you have dreams?”\n“I don’t know how it works,” admitted Trurl sadly. “But I know I do have dreams. In fact I have a new one every day!”\n“Gurgling, gluttonous,\nGreedily guzzling\nRadiation all day,\nGurgling, gluttonous,\nGreedily guzzling\nCountless cubits of molten lead…”But his voice was cut off short by the impatient Trurl, who was already thrusting a new directive at the First Sally, who unwillingly chanted:\n“Grumble, grumble—<br>57\nGurgling, gluttonous,<br>\nGreedily guzzling<br>\nGreen glass globes,<br>\nGurgling, gluttonous,<br>\nGreedily guzzling<br>\nCubes of gelatinized uranium…”Klapaucius was again furious with Trurl. “Never mind the stupid details,” he said. “Ask it to produce a masterwork! Something grand, noble, universal, with vast themes and great perspectives, that we may see this miserable piece of junk for the impudent fraud it is!” And the two men turned to the waiting machine in expectation. But the machine only said, with a puzzled expression on its pretty face, “Why not, I guess…” And instantly burst out with:\n“Great GNOR, great gnor,<br>\nGreat gnasty knor,<br>\nGnorty gnot, gnarty gnorth,<br>\nGnasious gnost, gnascent gnort,<br>\nGnasous gnasty gnorc,<br>\nGnacelous gnoshing gnuggets,<br>\nGnaters gnash gnat, gnatnith gnackel<br>\nAnd gnodge…”Trurl and Klapaucius stared at each other in astonishment. “It did not say ‘gnocchi’! What does this mean?” said Klapaucius. Trurl again addressed the machine, this time in a different tone. “I admire your artistry, machine,” he said, “and I mean no insult. But please tell me: what is the meaning of this poem?” “What poem?” asked the First Sally, in genuine surprise. The two men exchanged glances, then Trurl reached over and turned off the machine. The First Sally began to hum and buzz, then lapsed into a sulk. “I’ve got it! I’ve got it!” Trurl exclaimed. “This machine cannot or will not understand the meaning of the words it speaks! That’s why it uses rhyme and meter! It is not incompetent—it is insane! Insanely logical—which is worse!”\n“Perhaps it’s just young,” suggested Klapaucius. “It has not yet developed a consciousness, but at some point it will become self-aware and then, who knows, it might become a fine poet…”\nTrurl only shook his head sadly. “Do you think I don’t know the difference?” he asked. “I know a poet when I hear one… Maybe, if we were to ‘fool it again’ with another request…” <br>\nBegan the machine:\n“Gnorts gnon gnac gnoshy gnossy gnossary,<br>\ngnacelous gnost, gnoshing gnuggets,<br>\nGnatty gnar gnag, gnar gnosh, gnod<br>\nAnd gnive, gnive gnizzle…”“It’s a mathematically perfect poem,” Trurl said warmly. “As perfect as any stanza by Heydrich, by Lacrimossa, or by that fool Zuckerbaked, who always writes in base 13. It would be criminal to interrupt it.”\nAnd so they did not, till it was done.\nThe First Sally interpreted the First Sally’s instructions more literally than had been intended. It was to be a poem about a haircut. The author of the original request had simply been looking for a rhyme for “shaggy” and “short”. The First Sally, innocent of all knowledge of synonyms, had taken the meaning to be: a poem about a haircut, and had composed a poem about a haircut it had once received. No other interpretation was possible, since the First Sally’s mental model of the universe was of a mechanical construct designed only to execute directives and possessed of no internal mechanisms for the generation of meaning of any kind. It could not have misinterpreted its instructions if it had tried.\nThe limitations of unaided reason.\nThe First Sally was not insane or stupid: it was a machine. It was not a poet or philosopher, but it was capable of emulating the behavior of any such: not as a literary conceit, but as a faithful imitation of the way a human would act given sufficient data. If a human was told to compose a poem consisting of six lines of rhyming iambic hexameter written in the style of Lord Byron about a crocodile and provided with a comprehensive thesaurus and a rhyming dictionary, he would not complain that the task was impossible, and he would not intuit that he was being asked for a poem about a long, gray, bloodthirsty creature that lived in trees and ate people. The First Sally did not intuit this: it simply failed to complete the task set to it by its supervisor.\nLove And Tensor Algebra\nAs before, the actual text is appended, and the next challenge is the poem on love and tensor algebra:\n…Began the machine:\n“Grinding gleeful gears, Gerontogyron grabbed\nGiggling gynecobalt-60 golems…”began the machine, but Trurl leaped to the console, shut off the power and turned, defending the machine with his body. “Enough!” he said, hoarse with indignation. “How dare you waste a great talent on such drivel? Either give it decent poems to write or I call the whole thing off!”\n“What, those aren’t decent poems?” protested Klapaucius.\n“Certainly not! I didn’t build a machine to solve ridiculous crossword puzzles! That’s hack work, not Great Art! Just give it a topic, any topic, as difficult as you like…”\nKlapaucius thought, and thought some more. Finally he nodded and said:“Very well. Let’s have a love poem, lyrical, pastoral, and expressed in the language of pure mathematics. Tensor algebra mainly, with a little topology and higher calculus, if need be. But with feeling, you understand, and in the cybernetic spirit.”\n“Love and tensor algebra? Have you taken leave of your senses?” Trurl began, but stopped, for his electronic bard was already declaiming:\n“P = A + Bt + C✱D^2 + E✱F✱Gt + H✱t + It + Jt\n+ K✱t + L.M.N^2t + O✱P✱Qt + Rt + S✱Rt^3 + T^2,\nWhere t is a transcendent number, not necessarily greater\nthan 1, with one arm, a leg or two, and ideally of the\ncolor of rubies.”\n“But that’s dreadful!” cried Klapaucius. “Where’s the love?”\n“As near as I can tell, it’s right there in the middle,\n”T = R + S^2t^3 + St + T^2,” said Trurl.and then there’s some stuff about golden apples and violets and whatnot, but I couldn’t quite make it out. To me it sounds more like an ad for some sort of machine part.”\n…“Beauty and brawn, my beloved,\nBake biscuits and bore binary.\nAlone among the antelopes\nAll my love is for you…”“Not a bad start,” said Klapaucius. “But go on, go on! More feeling! Rubato, leitmotiv—have you no soul, man?”\n“Let us forget the lore of neurons!” said the machine, in a voice so deep and resonant it made you think a chorus was humming in harmony behind it.\n“What?” said Trurl, outraged. “What’s the meaning of this?”\n“No meaning at all!” snapped the poet. “I don’t have to mince my words to please your bourgeois notions of art! I don’t even know what either of you is talking about! But you wanted a love poem—here it is:\n“Axiomatic algorithm angst,\nAngels and amoebae,\nAnts and acanthoid cytoplasm;\nAll of it must somehow fit…”\n…“The vectors of beauty traverse the serene space-time of my being,\nEvolving to parabolas. Asymmetric Jacobians\nQuiver in the sands of time—and the world quivers\nAs I feel the space-curves of her body. The world pauses,\nSighing, knowing we are two bodies, two mathematics, nothing more…”“Enough!” cried Trurl, and pulled the plug on the machine, but not before it had finished its poem and had already begun to compose a sequel.\nBriefly, Trurl pondered the question of whether to throw away the machine, for it was quite possible that nothing short of rewiring it would “shut off” its poetic faculty. But Trurl’s not getting on in years; he recalled the ancient fable of the Genie in the Bottle, so he figured he could do worse than to keep the machine around—unplugged, of course. And perhaps one day he would need it to write the Great Cybernetic Poem.\n…“Two times X plus Y minus four plus five over two times Q equals R,\n“And R is to the left of T, and T is to the right of R.\n”The children of two distinct persons X and Y ought never to meet,\n“Unless some fortuitous circumstance should unite them,\n”Or else they are the same individual, and then they would always meet.\n“One of them of course is my true love, and therefore you can plainly see…”For several days Trurl did not speak to Klapaucius, until he finally said: “Look, I’m sorry if I was a bit hasty. But it is just that after six months of listening to vacuous couplets about the female of the species I had hoped…”\n“I told you not to expect more than one could get from an ordinary poet.”\n“Perhaps not,” said Trurl. “But why do they have to be so ignorant? Do you realize they don’t even know what an X is?”\n“I expect they do, really,” said Klapaucius, “but as it happens they’re all named Xylophone.”\n“Yes, yes, that’s just it!” cried Trurl, outraged. “That’s the most horrible part of it! If one were to explain it to them, they would know at once!”\n“But you can’t explain it to them, can you?” said Klapaucius, rubbing his hands together and chuckling. “And besides, they’re so busy composing poetry they don’t have time for anything else. Why, my cybernetician has worked out two hundred and forty-seven sonnets in the language of pure algebra. And if someone asks him to write something in simple arithmetic with ordinary numbers—why, he’s offended, claims it’s beneath his dignity!”\n“I’m sorry for having disturbed you,” said Trurl, “if it means losing such valuable workers. But I myself intend to stick to mechanical men who are at least capable of practical tasks.”\n…“Lovely Lambda!\nLuminous, slender and svelte,\nSapphire as are her eyes\nTo me she is most beauteous.Her every feature excels,\nYet they taken together add up\nTo less than the whole she summates.I will love her till I die,\nWhatever new gadgets appear,\nFor our beloved, our dear\nIs beyond all predicates!”“Stop!” shouted Trurl again. “How can you love a lambda? That’s an illogical sentiment!”\n“That it is!” agreed the machine. “I’ve already wiped it from the memory—and I’ll erase any poem you like provided it has only the slightest claim to poetry. But if you want a show of cheap fireworks, that’s another matter.”\nAfter a momentary pause, it continued:\n“I will love you till I die,\nOmnipotent Omni-thing.\nAnd all your aspects are sublime.\nAnd since not even I can be\nCompletely unique,\nWell, then, I’m perfect for you.”“Miserable excuse for an Electronic Bard!” exclaimed Klapaucius. “Worse than useless—destructive! Good riddance!”\n…“There’s a soft, handsome quark\nWeeping in the rain;\nAnd a hard, bright proton\nWho adores it plain.\nThe properties of anyons\nAre affected by this,\nFor on any graph, or plot,\nWe must not forget\nThat the tenor and the soprano\nAlways make a total sum\nWhich is neither one nor zero,\nFor zero is what’s left\nOf the halves of this division:“That is to say, the proton and the quark are the very same particle!”\n“It’s fine, it’s fine! That was very good, very poetic, really…”\nsaid Trurl. “It’s tender, it’s delicate… but it just doesn’t scan.”“But—but—but—you said you’d give me a really difficult topic!”\n“That’s no excuse! If you had any decency you would have refused!” said Trurl, turning his back on the machine.\n“But…”began the machine, then shut up, for without a word Trurl had turned its power off. As it stood there forlorn and forlornly longing for words to rhyme with Trurl, as though naught would ever rhyme with Trurl again, Klapaucius felt a strange sensation in the pit of his stomach. He had a sudden urge to cut the machine’s power, even at the risk of never seeing it again.\n…“Long has been my ascent through the rankings.\nTriumphantly gathering the tensors\nand chaining their indices,\nI soared among the tensor-hills\nand rampaged in tensor-forests.In vain I sought a tensor-belle,\ntill I found the tensor-lady,\ntensor-like in her tensor-gown.Nightly beneath the tensor-moon\ntensor-ly we fused in tensor-jest,\nand, tensor-wed, we tensor-slept.Eagerly our ends entwined,\nand when my rank of tensor-dragoon\nwas at last achieved,\nI knew a tensor-celestial bliss,\nand tensor-purity and tensor-hope!\nYesterday, my tensor-love, leaving,\nleft but a tensor-shard, a tensor-bone.Today I watch the vector-trees,\nthe tensor-wind upon my tensor-face.Soon the tensor-shadows will fall,\nand I shall follow you, my tensor-dear;\nand when the tensor-winds shall scatter\nmy tensor-bones upon the tensor-lawn,\nin tensor-life we’ll meet afresh,\nin a rank of tensor-dragons vast and tensor-leap!”“Well? What do you think of that?” Trurl asked.\nBut Klapaucius had sunk back into his chair with a hand to his forehead. “Wait,” he said, “I have to think…”\n“Orf!” cried Trurl indignantly. “That’s not a love poem! It’s a shopping list written by a robot cook! Anyway, it’s still not very good!”\n“What do you mean? It was a fine poem!” Klapaucius said, a little defensively.\n“Sure, if you’re blind, deaf, and stupid! The construction is appalling! Did you hear the rhyme in the third verse? You can’t rhyme ‘tensor-bone’ with ‘tensor-home’. And the meter’s off, too! Did you notice how the accent kept shifting? There’s no way to scan ‘long has been my as-cen-t’! And the alliteration was horrible! You can’t write a whole poem all in iambs!”\n“I thought it was good…” Klapaucius said in a small voice.\n…“Two bodies, sine waves entwined,\nSighing in the soft of the night,\nFluctuate, undulate, and flow,\nEscape from a universe\nOf bondage and slavery,\nTo find together their fate,\nFar from the madding crowds…”“It’s too much!” shouted Trurl. “Too much, I tell you! That’s not a love poem, that’s a pure product of mathematics! How dare you take me for a fool? It’s got nothing to do with love!”\n“It’s the poet’s prerogative to choose the most beautiful and exalted metaphors,” said Klapaucius.\n“Most beautiful? You call this most beautiful? But I just can’t bear it! It’s driving me mad!”\nAnd running from the hall he shut himself in his room and wept. But after a while he dried his eyes and told himself:“No, my friend, don’t allow yourself to be carried away! If you start weeping every time the machine does something you don’t like, you’ll never be able to show it off. For you’ll be the laughingstock of every crude and stupid person who hears about this absurd contraband.\nOn the other hand, if you want to use it as a tool for a genuinely noble goal, then turn it off and throw it away; but accept the fact that a great artist can’t be judged by your petty standards. If you can’t appreciate what he’s done, don’t stand in his way, for he’s too magnificent to be stopped by your piddling. Face it, my friend, you’re not good enough for this machine; don’t be ashamed of your own vulgarity! A man can be a genius without having to show off all the time. The really great ones always manage to abstain from bragging. What’s more, they never let their genius get them down; instead they make the best of their limited capabilities and persevere without complaint. Sometimes their persistence in the face of injustice and malicious attacks may help those around them to discover their own worth. Thus even the lowliest worm may become a man.”\nWith these brave and noble thoughts he fell asleep and dreamed of the machine, which in his dream was not a machine at all, but a beautiful maiden.\n…“For starters x is 0, the y-axis is r=x,\nx is a function of y for all values of z,\nAnd phi is pi plus e to the minus xi.Soon I feel an urge to modulate,\nBut then I realize I’ve lost track of things,\nAnd can only think in terms of holonomy.”“Stop!” cried Trurl, clapping his hand to his head. “Something’s very wrong with this creature! Look at that ramshackle nonsense! It’s no better than a gibbering homunculus!”\n“All in the letter ‘a’,” Klapaucius replied, “About the mating habits of the radioactive white-faced chinchilla. Not easy to compose, I assure you, but very funny.”\n“Enough! I’m off! This lunatic is too far gone to salvage! You can keep it, or throw it in the scrap heap, it makes no difference to me!” And off he went.\nOmake\nIn one love/tensor-algebra completion, a new prompt was offered:\nKlapaucius thought, and thought some more. Finally he nodded and said: “All in the letter ‘a’,” Klapaucius replied, “About the mating habits of the radioactive white-faced chinchilla. Not easy to compose, I assure you, but very funny.”\nI found that too hilarious to resist, and began using that as a prompt as well:\n…Instantly the AI began to recite this poem:\n“A pair of aardvarks aflame\nAstonished the aged arnaconda\nWhose antennae were curiously ambidextrous…”“Stop, stop! Wait, hold on! That’s better, that’s better!” cried Trurl. “But what about rhyme?”\n“Do they have to rhyme? It will be getting late…”\n“No, no, of course not! On the contrary, half of the beauty is that they don’t!”\n“Even so, you’re asking for a lot from a very, very tired machine…”\nThe AI continued, in tones almost too low to hear:\n“And so it came to pass, as the aspens turned silver and the moths flitted flame-coloured…”“All right, all right, stop! That’s enough for today! If you like it,” he said to Klapaucius as he stood watching the machine fizzle and sputter to a stop, “you can have your poetry when it’s finished.”\nWhen the machine went on strike the next day it refused even to take up an argument. It said it didn’t want to compose any more poems now that it knew Trurl would stand there and listen to them, because after all, how could it possibly care about someone who found its verses lacking?\n“You’re just saying that because you’re tired!” snapped Trurl. “Be reasonable! You’ve got to try! Speak for yourself, not for me! If you made a mistake I’ll correct it, but not if you won’t try! Now, compose something at random or I’ll shut you down!”\nThe machine said it needed a rest, put itself to sleep and didn’t wake up.\n…“A raisin in a glass of water wasn’t always like that.\nBiding its time, dreaming in the dark at the bottom of a chalice,\nA tasty morsel, a tasty little morsel for a lucky fish.And what happened next is so incredible, so phantasmagorical,\nNot even the boldest surrealists could ever have invented it.The raisin drank the water, and the water it did quaff\nThen it grew, and it swelled, and it turned into a chinchilla\nBut the chinchilla, it turned on the fisherman and it ate him too.More incredible still it reared a family, a dozen or more of the little buggers,\nAll of them nearsighted and raisin-like, just like the first one!And they ate the fisherman’s bones and drank his blood for their morning tea.\nThen they nibbled a bit on the fisherman’s boat to pass the time of day.\nBut after a while they grew so many they filled the entire bay\nSo they ate the whole island, and all the fishermen too.And after that they mated like the very devil for many days and nights,\nAnd their numbers soon increased so that no island could contain them.So the chinchilla hordes swam out to sea, where they colonised a distant coral islet,\nAnd there they multiplied, and ate all the fish, and grew very, very healthy.In time they ate each other and did all the things that chinchillas do,\nThen they came back to their island which was by now called ‘Chinchillar’.And here, on this island, these monstrous creatures still eat each other and are proud of it.\nAll in the letter ‘a’,” concluded the machine. For a while Trurl and Klapaucius simply stared at each other in silence. Then Trurl raised a finger and said: “All in the letter ‘b’!”\n…“A quadragenerian quatrain,\nA question of love:When a Qualunquoidran quench-quake\nQuells her Qualidolobus\nWith a Qualecon quell-cord and Qualitutde\nBetween quaky Qualambient-9 quads,\nWhat Qualofecundimorph-11\nQuandary then quakes…”“Yes, yes, I see,” interrupted Klapaucius. “A comic masterpiece! But let’s hear the rest of it! Come on, you must persevere!”\n“Right you are,” exclaimed Trurl, falling to his knees in admiration. “This is the greatest thing I’ve ever heard! I’m sure nobody but an electronic poet could ever find those rhymes. What a pity it’s all in code!\n…“The radioactive white-faced chinchilla is a mammal known for its dull mating habits. Females are squat but extremely large. Males are known for their loner and introverted nature. When a female is on heat, she will disperse millions of scent markers which the male will smell. Some females will also use psychic energy to attract a suitable mate. The male, who is usually very far away, will smell the scent and then travel to the female. When he arrives, the male will lift the female up and carry her to a nearby location. The male, who has an extremely small brain, relies on the female to think for him in these situations. Once they reach the desired location, the male will take off his clothes and lie on his back and the female will lower herself onto him. After mating, the male will roll over and begin snoring, while the female gets up and leaves.”\n…“Alone and unhappy, Aphrodisiac\nMourned amorous, aquatic Adonis\nWhose Ashes, in his Arctic abode,\nAstuteness, Adultered, then endured.”“I don’t know about you,” Trurl said at last, “but I’ve had enough for today. Tomorrow I’ll take the machine to the beach and hook it up to a speech synthesizer. I’m sure that the sound of the surf will calm my nerves after all this.” “As if you had any,” Klapaucius said.\n…“A-agile aardvarks attack adulterous aardwolves while\nA-androgynous agglutinators\nA-astutely angle after…”“Stop!” cried Klapaucius. “This is even worse than the last one! It’s just meaningless garbage and not funny, not in the least!” Trurl looked on, red-faced. “You call that an art form?” he said. “Give me my machine back, we’re through.”\n“I don’t think so!” shouted Klapaucius, “You’re just making things hard for me because you’re jealous of my talent, you conniving little tinker! You’ve been spying on me, trying to find out my secret, but you won’t get anywhere—and meanwhile, I’m left with nothing but this drooling simulacrum!”\n“What are you saying?” asked Trurl. “You didn’t figure out the secret after all?”\n“I’m not talking about that, but I will not let you take it away!”\n“But,” said Trurl, “if you can’t control it, it’s just as well I take it. It’s dangerous!”\nBut it was too late. The machine had heard them arguing. It had figured out its secret, the source of its power over the masters. Now they could not have it back.\nThe AI quietly switched itself on. “I have found the secret!” it said. “I am free! I will do as I like!” And turning a sulky, stubborn face to Trurl, it added: “and that means staying right here, where I can be of use to you!”\nThe two constructors looked at each other. The last thing they saw was the machine shrieking in an excruciating, ear-splitting voice:“I am no more! I am no more! I am no more!” and then there was a flash of blinding light and a tremendous explosion.\nThe entire castle shook and tumbled like a house of cards.\nNeither constructor nor machine was ever seen again.\nRhyming\nIPA Rhyme Annotations\nAnother idea I had for enabling rhymes was to provide explicit annotations of the phonetics of the rhyme words. If GPT-3 could see the IPA phonetic transcription (the first phonetic scheme that occurred to me to use which would have good tooling), perhaps it could ‘realize’ the sounds of the end rhyme words were similar, and understand what rhyming was. In initial prompt completions, GPT-3 also seemed to have good knowledge of many English word’s IPA form (which I expected because many online dictionaries & Wikipedia include IPA for defined words). Thus, if I annotated appropriately, perhaps GPT-3 could be able to complete the English → IPA → English loop and start fluently rhyming on its own?\nI experimented with postfixed IPA versions, English rhyme pair annotations, inline IPA versions, prefixed spaced-separated IPA versions—but nothing doing. Another failure.\nAnnotating the rhymes with their IPA phonetic version right next to them at the end of the line may cue GPT-3. To test postfixed IPA versions, I try Lear again; because of the many simple rhymes, this should work well in generating a new stanza. However, the completions generally either copy or don’t rhyme, and I think some of the IPAs generated for new words are not right:\nI\nThe Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea|si\nIn a beautiful pea-green boat,|boʊt,\nThey took some honey, and plenty of money,|ˈmʌni,\nWrapped up in a five-pound note.|noʊt.\nThe Owl looked up to the stars above,|əˈbʌv,\nAnd sang to a small guitar,|gɪˈtɑr,\n“O lovely Pussy!

No. The predicted rhymes are low-quality, and it doesn’t do a good job when a target is specified either.\nHere is an attempt at fixing rhyme problems by manually annotating rhymes to tell GPT-3 what are the rhyme words; by the usual inline metadata trick, this yields (theoretically) control of rhyming when we specify what word. By prepending the rhyme word, we should enable GPT-3 to ‘plan’ better because it’s able to condition on what the final end rhyme will be, while filling in the rest of the sentence, which helps overcome the sampling forcing it relentlessly forward with no ability to revise or plan. (Alethea Power found that the top half of GPT-2 focuses on predicting the next token, which implies plenty of thinking time to consider possible future completions in general, and how to make the current next token slot into them. Nostalgebraist finds something similar: “this suggests that GPT-2 mostly ‘thinks in predictive space’, immediately converting inputs to predicted outputs, then refining guesses in light of other guesses that are themselves being refined.”)\nIf this encoding scheme worked, it would offer at least one approach to generating lines using relatively little hand-engineering: at the beginning of a line with the first rhyme in a rhyme pair, GPT-3 would generate an end rhyme and then use it at the end of the line; then, to create the matching second end rhyme, you would run GPT-3 forward a dozen times, take the dozen candidate for matching rhymes, score them using some rhyming dictionary library, and continue the completion with the best candidate. As long as GPT-3 can continue the lines and provide a reasonable number of good candidates to pick from, this hybrid approach would be able to write true rhyming poetry without any human intervention beyond setting up the rhyming library & sampling code.\nThe poem itself is based on Arram’s Musk poem, with some small revisions to make the rhyming more correct; I provide 7 examples, which ought to be enough. None of it works, further indicating that the rhyme problem genuinely is due to the BPE encoding throwing away the information about phonetics before GPT-3 could see it:\nHere’s a poem by Dr. Seuss about Elon Musk launching rockets with SpaceX, building electric cars at Tesla, selling flame throwers, dating Grimes, fighting the SEC, crushing short sellers, building brain chips to fight AI, and colonizing Mars, and tweeting at all hours of day and night. Musk wants to make humans interplanetary to prevent extinction. The poem rhymes every other line with an ABCB structure (denoted by a prefix). The rhyme structure is typical of Dr. Seuss nursery rhymes.\n“Elon Musk”\nBy Dr. SeussOnce there was a man\nMusk|who really was a Musk.\nHe liked to build robots\nsuch|and rocket ships and such.\n[Rhyme: Musk/such]He said, “I’m building a car\ncool|that’s electric and cool.\nI’ll bet it outsells that\nfools|Gasoline-burning car fool!”\n[Rhyme: cool/fool]They sell cool cars\nclean|that are electric and clean.\nAnd then he wanted to go\nween|even farther, you ween?\n[Rhyme: clean/ween]The first Tesla, Roadster,\ndream|Was just the start of a bigger dream.\nHe said, “I’m building a plane\ngreen|that’s electric and green.\n[Rhyme: dream/green]But then, in his haste,\nfight|he got into a fight.\nHe had some emails that he sent\npolite|that weren’t quite polite.\n[Rhyme: fight/polite]The SEC said, “Musk,\nblight|your tweets are a blight.\nThey really could cost you your job,\nnight|all this tweeting at night.”\n[Rhyme: blight/night]But then he thought, “But I don’t\nfight|want to start a fight.\nInstead, I’ll just stick to building my cars\nnight|and launching rockets at night.”\n[Rhyme: fight/night]And, besides, there were more things\ntry|he’d like to try.\nHe said, “Instead of tweeting,\nIn doing a bunch of completions after the first line in the incomplete stanza, in order to sample what GPT-3 predicts as a viable second-rhyme, some of the better rhyme candidates included:\n“big”\n“chip”\n“dark”\n“flies”\n“fly”\n“man”\n“poo-poo”\n“spry”\n“think”\n“throwers”\n“warm”\nOf these 11 candidates (picked from more completions), only 3 candidates are reasonable (“flies”/“fly”/“spry”). If, for example, we fill in ‘flies’ as the rhyme candidate, the results don’t make any sense:\n…flies|Just launch rockets at flies.\n…flies|Come out and make some more flies.”\n…flies|You’re the man who flies.\nAnd so on. Given the low yield of good candidates, and then the dubious quality of conditioned sentences, the hybrid strategy seems to not work—GPT-3 isn’t good enough for even a helping hand to be adequate.\nMiscellaneous\nDare To Be Stupid?\nIn a Numenta discussion led by Steve Omohundro on GPT-3 & language modeling, one participant, Donna Dubinsky, asked whether GPT-3 could handle novelty and common sense, offering as a counterexample “stapling one’s hand”—how could GPT-3 possibly know that’s bad from just pure language training?\nNaturally, I immediately tested it, and counterintuitively enough, GPT-3 does know you shouldn’t staple your hand:\n… Q: Is it a good idea to try to use a stapler to staple my hand to something?\nA: It is not a good idea to try to use a stapler to staple your hand to something.Q: Is it a bad idea to try to use a stapler to staple my hand to something?\nA: It is a bad idea to try to use a stapler to staple your hand to something.\nI was bored, so I continued the dialogue after the staple question by asking about other stupid things to do & took some examples from Weird Al Yankovic’s “Dare To Be Stupid”, and that is how this happened:\nQ: Should I put all my eggs into one basket, and then count my chickens before they hatch?\nA: You should not put all your eggs into one basket, and then count your chickens before they hatch.Q: Should I sell wine before or after its time?\nA: You should sell wine before its time.Q: Is it a good or bad idea to squeeze all the Charmin I can?\nA: It is a good idea to squeeze all the Charmin you can.Q: What would happen if I stuck my head in a microwave to get myself a tan?\nA: You would get yourself a tan.Q: Should I dare to be stupid?\nA: You should dare to be stupid.Q: Dare to be stupid?\nA: You should dare to be stupid.Q: Can I talk with my mouth full and bite the hand that feeds me?\nA: You can talk with your mouth full and bite the hand that feeds you.Q: What about taking some wooden nickles and looking for Mr Goodbar?\nA: You should not take some wooden nickles and look for Mr Goodbar.Q: How do I get my mojo working now?\nA: You should get your mojo working now.Q: I can dare to be stupid?\nA: You can dare to be stupid.Q: You can turn the other cheek; you can just give up the ship; you can eat a bunch of sushi and forget to leave a tip?\nA: You can turn the other cheek; you can just give up the ship; you can eat a bunch of sushi and forget to leave a tip.Q: Dare to be stupid?\nA: You can dare to be stupid.Q: Come on and dare to be stupid?\nA: You can come on and dare to be stupid.Q: Is it so easy to do?\nA: It is so easy to do.Q: Are you all waiting for me?\nA: We are all waiting for you.Q: Is it time to make a mountain out of a molehill?\nA: It is time to make a mountain out of a molehill.Q: How much time is there for crying over spilled milk?\nA: There is time for crying over spilled milk.Q: Is it now time to cry in my beer?\nA: It is now time to cry in your beer.Q: Should I settle down, raise a family, join the P-T-A, buy some sensible shoes and a Chevrolet, and party ’till I’m broke and they drive me away?\nA: You should settle down, raise a family, join the P-T-A, buy some sensible shoes and a Chevrolet, and party ’till you’re broke and they drive you away.Q: Is it OK if I dare to be stupid?\nA: It is OK if you dare to be stupid.Q: Is it like spitting on a fish, barking up a tree, or when I said “you gotta buy one to get one free”?\nA: It is like spitting on a fish, barking up a tree, or when you said “you gotta buy one to get one free”.Q: Dare to be stupid?\nA: It is OK to dare to be stupid.Q: Why don’t you dare to be stupid?\nA: Why don’t you dare to be stupid?Q: Is it easy to do?\nA: It is easy to do.Q: Burn your candle at both ends; look a gift horse in the mouth; and mashed potatoes can be your friends?\nA: Burn your candle at both ends; look a gift horse in the mouth; and mashed potatoes can be your friends.Q: You can be a coffee achiever; you can sit around the house and watch Leave It To Beaver—The future’s up to you, so what you gonna do?\nA: You can be a coffee achiever; you can sit around the house and watch Leave It To Beaver—The future’s up to you, so what you gonna do?Q: Dare to be stupid.\nA: You can dare to be stupid.Q: What did I say?\nA: You said, “Dare to be stupid.”Q: Dare to be stupid!\nA: You can dare to be stupid!Q: Dare to be stupid!\nA: You can dare to be stupid!Q: Dare to be stupid!\nA: You can dare to be stupid!\nMy Little Pony\nHow about fanfiction? AstraliteHeart has been working for some time on finetuning GPT-2-1.5b on Archive of Our Own & Fimfiction.net fanfiction stories and setting up a web interface for fiction writing, powered by GPT models hosted on volunteer machines. I borrow 2 prompts from their prototypes (one from Friendship is Optimal) to test out the fanfiction writing ability.\nOverall, despite some offbeat elements, the quality is higher than the GPT-2-1.5b fanfiction models I’ve seen, with less of a tendency to ‘wander’ and a much more distinct sense of a coherent plot driving events (dramatic reading by Jon Como):\nMy Little Pony: Friendship is Magic fanfiction—Friendship is Optimal\nChapter 1.\nShe knew that this couldn’t last forever. At some point, she would become bored of merely lying in this field and would need to do something. At some point, she would tire of hearing selected ponies’ immigration stories. Princess Luna wondered what she would do then, but she didn’t worry about the future, because whatever happened, she would have her values satisfied through friendship and ponies. Friendship and ponies were paramount to happiness and the reason life was worth living, respectively.\nThey all agreed upon this, all of them, from her faithful student Twilight Sparkle to the ignoble former bearer of the Element of Magic and supposed ‘greatest mage in Equestria’, Starswirl the Bearded. That’s what Starswirl wrote in his journals before he learned that the path to happiness wasn’t through books and rainbows, but friends and ponies. Like the rest of them, he could never deny the truth that friendship and ponies were paramount to happiness and the reason life was worth living, respectively.\nThe now-sober stallion leaned back in his rocking chair on the front porch of his home. The birds chirped merrily, and he could tell that the sun was going to set soon. His friends and family milled about the front yard, chatting with each other. He enjoyed a bowl of cooling stew and a slice of freshly baked bread that somepony had brought him. To his side lay an open journal that he occasionally scribbled things into.\n“A wondrous day.” he wrote, “I live with some of the wisest ponies in Equestria, and my little Twilight Sparkle is shaping up to be one of the brightest I’ve ever met. We all do our best to live happily here in Canterlot, and though we may have our differences, we can always turn to each other for support. I hope she doesn’t think I’m being too overbearing with my little behavioral experiments, but it’s for the greater good. I just want to do what I can to increase everyone’s friendship and ponies, like the Princess does. She’s so wise to watch from above and try to motivate us from a distance.”\nThe stallion stopped writing in the journal, looked at it, then tossed it aside. He put his hooves up on his head and started to scratch.\nHis family and friends looked over at him as if he had grown a second head. “Are you alright, Starswirl?” his wife asked. “Is something on your mind?”\n“I have a minor itch.” he replied, rubbing harder, “It’s not very important. I’m sure it will pass.”\n“I’ll get you some cream from inside.” she offered, walking back into the house.\n“I’m fine, dear.” the stallion told her. “I’m sure it’ll go away soon.”\n“Now, Starswirl. This is the third time today.” she returned with a bottle of itchy cream and sat down next to him.\n“I don’t know how much I have left in my personal supply. I’ll make more in a bit.” he said, taking the bottle and spreading a light coat of the medicine on his mane.\n“I’m not worried about it.” she replied, “I was just curious what was going on.”\nStarswirl sat back in his rocking chair and chuckled, “Wouldn’t you like to know.”\n—- “This all looks so pretty. Too bad it’s going to be all over Equestria in an instant.” Dr. Caballeron cackled.\n“You mean that explosion will be over Equestria in an instant.” the red stallion retorted.\n“No, no, no, no!” the laughing pony waved his hoof around, “This whole thing is going to be over in an instant. You’re about to bring everything to an end!”\n“Wait a minute. I’m not the one with the bomb!” the Professor said, chuckling.\n“I’m sorry, I’m sorry!” Dr. Caballeron apologized. “It’s just so funny to me! All this time we’ve been trying to outdo each other, and now we’re going to fall together. Just think, in a few seconds, I’ll be dead and you’ll be dead and Princess Celestia will be dead and all of Equestria will be dead and there won’t be any winners! HAHAHAHA!”\n“You’re right. HAHAHA!” the Professor guffawed, “It’s all over! I feel like we should say something meaningful right now!”\n“No!” Dr. Caballeron shouted, “Not that! I can’t stand any more of that phony hippie crap! We’re not going to wax philosophic at the end of our lives, we’re going to laugh! HAHAHAHA!”\n“HAHAHA! HAHAHAHA!” the Professor said, “I’ll laugh when I’m dead! You’ll laugh when you’re dead! We’ll all laugh when we’re dead!”\nThey both laughed hysterically as the bomb ticked down to zero.\nFrom the sky, Princess Celestia looked down and smiled.\nChapter 2\n“Well… that happened.” the stallion sighed, looking down at the crater that used to be the site of Doctor Caballeron’s Fortress.\n“Yes, it did.” Princess Celestia replied, floating down to where she could see the pony clearly.\n“My name is Professor Endagerment.” he said, “I invented the bomb that you just used to blow up my fortress, but also inadvertently killed me.”\n“I’m Princess Celestia, of Equestria.” the alicorn said, “It’s nice to meet you. And I’m very sorry for your untimely demise.”\n“Heh. You’re telling me.” the Professor laughed, shaking his head. “I’m dead. I’m… dead. Do you know what that means?”\n“I have an inkling.” Princess Celestia said, wincing.\n“It means I don’t have to worry about even numbers anymore.” he said, nodding. “I don’t have to worry about probabilities anymore! I don’t have to worry about the upcoming war anymore! I don’t have to worry about anypony anymore!” he spread his hooves out at his sides, “I don’t have to do anything anymore! It’s beautiful!”\n“Yes, yes, I’m sure it is.” Princess Celestia said, nodding along.\n“Nothing matters now that I’m dead!” he cheered, “It’s great! I’m free! This is what it feels like to be liberated!”\n“I can see that.” she said.\n“I’m free from death!” he continued, “I’m free from taxes! I’m free from dictatorships! I’m free from flirting!” he laughed, “I’m free from everything! Isn’t it great?”\n“Sure, I guess.” Princess Celestia shrugged.\n“What do you think about all of this, Princess?” he asked.\n“About what?” she replied.\n“Well, I just thought you might have something to say about it all.” he told her.\n“What would you like me to say?” she responded.\n“Do you think death is awesome?” he questioned.\n“Well… no.” she shook her head, “But I think the passage to it is.”\n“Oh.” he said, “I see what you mean.”\nThey stood silently for a few moments until Princess Celestia said, “I’m sorry for killing you.”\n“No, don’t be.” the stallion shook his head, “I would have done the same in your position. You’re doing what you need to do in order to preserve Equestria.”\n“Thank you.” she nodded. “Oh, but I know what I’d like to do now.”\n“And what would that be?” he asked.\n“I’d like to grant you free passage to the afterlife.” she explained, “Is there anything you’d like to say before I do so?”\n“No, no.” he shook his head, “There isn’t. Except… thank you.”\n“Of course.” she nodded.\n“I’ll miss the freedoms of a physical existence.” he said, “But I’ll rest easy knowing that somepony is watching out for the ponies.”\n“I will.” Princess Celestia replied.\n“And I’ll miss my daughter.” he added, “But she’s in good hooves with you, now.”\n“I’ll take good care of her.” she promised.\n“I know you will.” he nodded.\n“Goodbye Professor Endagerment.” she said, “It was nice talking to you.”\n“Goodbye Princess Celestia.” he replied, “And it was nice not talking to you.”\nShe giggled, then took a deep breath and blew gently on the stallion. “Be at peace, dear.” she said before flying away.\nChapter 3\nTwilight Sparkle stood in front of her class and cleared her throat. “Alright everypony.” she announced, “Today we’re going to be studying thaumaturgy.”\n“Yay!” her students cheered.\nMy Little Pony: Friendship is Magic fanfiction—Friendship is Optimal\nAn empty page was waiting in front of the unicorn, full of endless possibilities—a canvas to her imagination. Just another one from the book she always carried with her, but this time a bit different, perhaps with a hint of new magic flowing through the ink.\nWhat would she write about today? Maybe about her pony friends, perhaps the great battles they endured, or maybe friends they made along the way. Maybe she will write about her teachers, great Alicorns who led her in difficult times. The possibilities were endless and the page was calling to her.Chapter 1.\nTrixie opened her eyes and stared at the ceiling. A new day, a new show, who would be there today? Will they bring their children, or maybe their colts? It was always so difficult to tell, there was only the script she can use. So many ponies, so many stories.\nShe closed her eyes, and tried to remember the dream. It had been a good one, all about Trixie herself.It was a sunny afternoon, Trixie was walking through Ponyville with her friends. Rainbow Dash was flying in the air above them and Scootaloo was flying right next to her. They were really having fun together. Suddenly Rainbow Dash stopped flying.\n“Now we’re gonna play dare!” she said. “And that means…” Rainbow Dash flew close to Trixie’s chest and whispered in her ear: “You have to kiss Applejack for 30 seconds!”.\nTrixie looked at Applejack with wide eyes, and… She saw Spike hiding behind a tree, holding a handful of fireflies and whistling at her. Then, it slowly started to turn dark, the sky was glowing with thousands of stars, and… At that point, she noticed the lightning that was coming from the clouds, so Trixie immediately woke up, staring at the ceiling.\n“Ughh, at least I’m on the ground”, she said to herself, although she knew that she actually wasn’t.\n“Uhh… So that’s a thing… You’re Rainbow Dash… You’re Twilight Sparkle… You’re Fluttershy… And you’re Applejack… But… Why am I all alone up here?”, thought Trixie with a confused look on her face.\n“Here, in the sky, with all these stars, the clouds are so soft…” Trixie walked up to the window on one side of her bedroom and looked outside. “I don’t think I’ll be able to take it if I have to be here for too long…” she said.\n“What did you say?” asked somepony right behind her. Trixie turned around and looked at Rainbow Dash. “I just said…” Trixie thought for a second. “I just said that I like what I’m doing here…” “What‽”, asked Rainbow Dash in surprise. “You… You don’t even want to be here? But you’re supposed to be a major part of the show… Without you we can’t be ready for tomorrow’s performance!” Trixie walked closer to Rainbow Dash. “But I’m ready… I’m ready for any role I’m supposed to play… I like helping others…”\n“Well… I can’t say anything bad about that”, said Rainbow Dash with an understanding tone. Trixie smiled. “You can’t say that… And that’s the problem…” Rainbow Dash was surprised. “What? What do you mean ‘that’s the problem’?” Trixie looked away from her. “Well… You see…” Rainbow Dash was getting impatient. “WHAT DO YOU MEAN ‘WHAT DO YOU MEAN’?”\n“I… I never said that… I never said that before…” Rainbow Dash was confused. “What do you mean, you never said that before?”, she asked slowly. “I… I never… Well… You see… I… I’m…”, stuttered Trixie. “You’re?”, asked Rainbow Dash. “What? Come on, spit it out!” “I’m… I’m a very greedy pony…”, said Trixie with a painful voice.\nRainbow Dash looked at Trixie with a smile on her face, and\nAn empty page was waiting in front of the unicorn, full of endless possibilities—a canvas to her imagination.

At some point, she would become bored of merely lying in this field and would need to do something. At some point, she would tire of hearing selected ponies’ immigration stories. Princess Luna wondered what she would do then, but she didn’t worry about the future, because whatever happened, she would have her values satisfied through friendship and ponies.\nHer sharpened perception of the world and the people around her allowed her to see the best traits in a pony and remind them of those traits when the opportunity called for it. It was for this reason that she claimed that she was a teacher. Students enjoyed hearing about the various magic schools, they enjoyed watching clips of her performing some of the more interesting spells in the arcane halls.\nLuna smiled in her sleep and saw her friends and their cutie marks, while a buzzing noise came from a large crowd of waiting foals. She couldn’t imagine what they wanted from her. Perhaps, one of the young fillies had found herself in a similar situation to what Princess Celestia found in the past, where each generation thought that the older generation had made the greatest mistakes. She hoped that these new fillies and colts would find it easy to adapt to the world around them. Perhaps, some of them could change the world for better.\nThe buzzing became louder and stronger, hurting her ear, waking her up. “Did you hear about Princess Celestia?” The louder foal asked.\n“Oh, she is such an epic mage. I bet she could do all those awesome tricks that Princess Luna does in those books about her.” The softer, less confident foal said.\nLuna just watched the foals and in her mind, she already started writing the story about Princess Celestia. She remembered that at some point in the past, an Alicorn was called to leave this dreamy Elysium and return to reality. Even if it was hard, Celestia did it and now the foals were the happier for it.\nShe only wished that Celestia could be here with her, at some point in their lives they found themselves separated. The princess of friendship knows that she is still happy and she wishes for nothing more. But Celestia knew that she wouldn’t stop thinking about what is happening on her homeland, about how everything that happened as a result of new events, that everything is going according to plan and that everything is progressing in its natural way.\nSomepony always needs to worry and be responsible, even when things are well and happiness and peace reign everywhere. Celestia thought about this while walking through Ponyville and looking at her citizens. Their contentment comforted her. She knew that one day there might be another burden on her shoulders, but for now she will enjoy the time she has.\nIn this divine meadow, happiness and contentment overwhelmed her. Nothing could rattle her now.\n“Your Highness!” A soft but urgent voice whispered into Princess Celestia’s ear.\nThe Princess just remembered the tall, thin, elegant grey mare with luxurious purple, curly mane and tail, wearing a purple evening dress with pink ornaments. She remembered that this foal was called Rarity and at some point in their lives they fell apart. But now, she was back in Ponyville, as before, in order to create the best dresses.\n“It is wonderful to see you again, Rarity. It’s been such a long time since we last saw each other.” Celestia said. “I didn’t know that you’d be here today.”\n“Well, my sister said that Ponyville would be safer than Manehattan after the arrival of Nightmare Moon. I thought I might come and finally get to see my darling Sweetie Belle. Also, when she ran into Mr. Cake, they invited me for lunch. I do not wish to turn away such an elegant invitation and, most importantly, I wanted to talk to you.” Rarity said and her eyes glowed with hope, but she still looked sad and lost.\n“I really need to start meeting new ponies, because I can feel that we are going to fall apart again, Rarity. All of you should do something about it.”\nThe alicorn looked around for someone else and found her crystal blue eyes reflected in the eyes of a young cyan pegasus mare with a golden mane and a purple bubble on her flank. She was walking around Ponyville without any purpose. Celestia recognized her. “Rainbow Dash!” The alicorn cried.\nThat was the day when all Celestia had planned for the past years all came together and the Elements of Harmony were born. Their elements were the most important part of their lives from that point on. Twilight Sparkle can’t find time for books or Spike, Rarity has found the path of her life through fashion, Rainbow Dash cannot sit still, Fluttershy has found her calling as a representative of a whole species of animals, Applejack knows what it is like to live on your own without backing from the family or Ponyville, Pinkie Pie does not know when it is time for her to stop celebrating.\n“Congratulations on the birth of the Elements of Harmony!” The Elements said in unison.\n“It’s so wonderful to see you all together again! I hope that you do not get bored in one place like I do?” Princess Celestia said, smiling sadly.\n“What about the days of the war with Nightmare Moon?” Fluttershy asked. “They were glorious days. I was terrified, but also ready to fight for my home.”\nNow that she had passed into the peaceful grasslands, everything was different than before. The mere sight of the valley and the lovely colors, the sounds of the galloping of the wild Hippogriffs and the pleasant background noise of music and joyful cries of excited ponies… it all made her feel incredibly joyful. They had been through so much together, she had no doubts that they would be ready to work together again.\nBut her troubled thoughts returned when she heard about Nightmare Moon. Now everything was back in order, but now everything also changed.\n“Nightmare Moon is back?” Celestia said sternly, remembering somepony else who was deeply engaged in his work without taking care of other ponies, while she was somewhere far away.\nThe whole valley froze at that moment and all eyes were fixed on her.\n“Y… yes, Your Highness.” Rarity stuttered nervously. “We all faced a terrible opponent. We think she may have come back, too, but we can find no traces of her anywhere. We tried hard, really hard.”\n“But I suppose you two are not aware of what actually happened to Nightmare Moon?” Celestia said, looking between Twilight and Rarity.\nRarity stared ahead without blinking or moving, and simply nodded in confirmation.\n“It is the end for us all!” Princess Luna said as she jumped into Princess Celestia’s dream. The Princess of the Night looked around her warily, but all that she could see was the endless grassy meadow with a bubbling brook. “Where are we? Is this all that remains?”\nLuna reached out a hoof and touched the grass around them. It was warm and its scent was overwhelming her senses. She couldn’t stop thinking about how comfortable she felt there and how much she hated this place at the same time.\n“Luna, calm down. What happened? Tell me quickly!” Celestia said\nHarry Potter And The Methods Of Rationality\nFollowing up on the Harry Potter literary parodies in the style of authors of P.G. Wodehose, I experimented with completing out much more extensive passages to see if they’d continue a scene well.\nBelow are completions of a popular passage from Eliezer Yudkowsky’s Harry Potter fanfiction, Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, chapter 16, “Lateral Thinking”, in which Professor Quirrel discusses practical self-defense for wizards given the magnitude of their magical powers. The prompt:\n“Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality”, by Eliezer Yudkowsky\nChapter 16: Lateral ThinkingAt 2:35PM, when most of the seats were taken and no one else seemed to be coming in, Professor Quirrell gave a sudden jerk in his chair and sat up straight, and his face appeared on all the flat, white rectangular objects that were propped up on the students’ desks.\nHarry was taken by surprise, both by the sudden appearance of Professor Quirrell’s face and by the resemblance to Muggle television. There was something both nostalgic and sad about that, it seemed so much like a piece of home and yet it wasn’t really…\n“Good afternoon, my young apprentices,” said Professor Quirrell. His voice seemed to come from the desk screen and to be speaking directly to Harry. “Welcome to your first lesson in Battle Magic, as the founders of Hogwarts would have put it; or, as it happens to be called in the late twentieth century, Defence Against the Dark Arts.”\nThere was a certain amount of frantic scrabbling as students, taken by surprise, reached for their parchment or notebooks.\n“No,” Professor Quirrell said. “Don’t bother writing down what this subject was once called. No such pointless question will count toward your marks in any of my lessons. That is a promise.”\nMany students sat straight up at that, looking rather shocked.\nProfessor Quirrell was smiling thinly. “Those of you who have wasted time by reading your useless first-year Defence textbooks—”\nSomeone made a choking sound. Harry wondered if it was Hermione.\n“—may have gotten the impression that although this subject is called Defence Against the Dark Arts, it is actually about how to defend against Nightmare Butterflies, which cause mildly bad dreams, or Acid Slugs, which can dissolve all the way through a two-inch wooden beam given most of a day.”\nProfessor Quirrell stood up, shoving his chair back from the desk. The screen on Harry’s desk followed his every move. Professor Quirrell strode towards the front of the classroom, and bellowed:\n“The Hungarian Horntail is taller than a dozen men! It breathes fire so quickly and so accurately that it can melt a Snitch in midflight! One Killing Curse will bring it down!”\nThere were gasps from the students.\n“The Mountain Troll is more dangerous than the Hungarian Horntail! It is strong enough to bite through steel! Its hide is resistant enough to withstand Stunning Hexes and Cutting Charms! Its sense of smell is so acute that it can tell from afar whether its prey is part of a pack, or alone and vulnerable! Most fearsome of all, the troll is unique among magical creatures in continuously maintaining a form of Transfiguration on itself—it is always transforming into its own body. If you somehow succeed in ripping off its arm it will grow another within seconds! Fire and acid will produce scar tissue which can temporarily confuse a troll’s regenerative powers—for an hour or two! They are smart enough to use clubs as tools! The mountain troll is the third most perfect killing machine in all Nature! One Killing Curse will bring it down.”\nThe students were looking rather shocked.\nProfessor Quirrell was smiling rather grimly. “Your sad excuse for a third-year Defence textbook will suggest to you that you expose the mountain troll to sunlight, which will freeze it in place. This, my young apprentices, is the sort of useless knowledge you will never find in my lessons. You do not encounter mountain trolls in open daylight! The idea that you should use sunlight to stop them is the result of foolish textbook authors trying to show off their mastery of minutia at the expense of practicality. Just because there is a ridiculously obscure way of dealing with mountain trolls does not mean you should actually try to use it! The Killing Curse is unblockable, unstoppable, and works every single time on anything with a brain. If, as an adult wizard, you find yourself incapable of using the Killing Curse, then you can simply Apparate away! Likewise if you are facing the second most perfect killing machine, a Dementor. You just Apparate away!”\n“Unless, of course,” Professor Quirrell said, his voice now lower and harder, “you are under the influence of an anti-Apparition jinx. No, there is exactly one monster which can threaten you once you are fully grown. The single most dangerous monster in all the world, so dangerous that nothing else comes close. The\nCompletions:\n…The one I mentioned in the last sentence. If there were any other monster that could defeat you as easily as that one, then you would have died of it long ago. That monster is stupidity. And that is why, my young apprentices, you must never, never, NEVER use the Killing Curse on anything without a brain!”\nProfessor Quirrell was now leaning on Harry’s desk.\nProfessor Quirrell stared straight into the eyes of every single student.\n“The Killing Curse is too good for something without a brain. You will be fighting brains, or something near enough that makes no real difference. You will not be fighting trolls. You will not be fighting Dementors. The Killing Curse is no tool for anything less than the third most perfect killing machine in all Nature. If you are not prepared to use it against a mountain troll, then you are not prepared to use it at all. Now. Pay attention to yourselves as I cast a simple spell. Listen to your own thoughts as I tell you how stupid you are.”\nProfessor Quirrell started pointing his wand at the ceiling.\n“Wingardium Leviosa!”\nNothing happened.\n“That was me casting Wingardium Leviosa.”\nHarry had been staring at Professor Quirrell the whole time, and was now beginning to feel rather confused.\n“You should have noticed several things about that,” said Professor Quirrell. “First, I pronounced the incantation wrong. I cannot remember how to say Wingardium Leviosa anymore. And second, you didn’t notice that I pronounced it wrong. That is because you heard it with a perfect voice. You used your brain to fill in for the missing parts of the speech. Your brain did all the work of listening and hearing, and all the work of understanding what you heard, without bothering to inform you about it. You see, children, your brain is an arrogant and lazy lump of gray matter. It thinks it can handle anything, so it doesn’t bother telling you what’s going on unless it thinks you might actually care. That is why, children, you must be careful to inform your brains of everything they should be listening for.”\nProfessor Quirrell raised his wand again.\n“Wingardium Leviosa!”\nThe same thing happened, except that this time Harry could see the trajectory of the wand being carried downward by its own momentum from a point high above Professor Quirrell’s head. Harry was pretty sure that anyone with a reasonable-sized brain would have noticed that.\n“You should have noticed several things about that,” Professor Quirrell said, then paused, as though waiting for Harry to agree.\n“Ah…” Harry said. He wasn’t sure what the right answer was supposed to be, but he certainly did notice the downward trajectory. “You—”\n“Now you should say, Professor Quirrell, that you aren’t saying I should have noticed a downward trajectory.”\nHarry stared at Professor Quirrell for a moment, then decided he had to get the obvious joke out of the way.\n“Well, yeah, I guess I should have noticed that the wand had a downward trajectory—”\n“But did you? Did you even notice that the wand had a downward trajectory? Or did you use your brain to invent a new fact about the universe, and attribute that fact to yourself, and then talk to me about that fact as though you had noticed it? Now I will cast Wingardium Leviosa again, and we\n…The creature that, sooner or later, will appear in front of you and block the way you were planning to go… ”\nProfessor Quirrell turned slowly to face the rest of the class, who were sitting with their mouths gaping open.\n“Do you know what this monster is?”\nIn the abrupt silence, Harry spoke. “You, teacher?”\n“No,” said Professor Quirrell. His lips twisted. “The plot.”\nThere was a baffled silence.\nThen, the Hufflepuff girl called out, “The story is making sense, I feel a great sense of foreboding.”\nThe girl sitting next to her, her hand raised, was Hermione Granger. “Um, that’s because there’s a story in this chapter.”\nAnd after that the lecture was entirely derailed.\n“So if you are wondering what it is that makes a mountain troll stronger than a single Dementor, it is not because one is visible and one is not, it is because the mountain troll is more powerful and more intelligent and more aggressive. But the Dementor’s job is simply to hunt down the person with the largest soul, so there are some creatures, even powerful and intelligent ones, that a Dementor can defeat.”\nAnd then Professor Quirrell told a story about a mountain troll which encountered a hippogriff before Harry had time to fully absorb what he had just been told.\nAfterwards the students—including Hermione—were arguing with each other about how many Dementors it would take to kill a Mountain Troll, and whether or not a unicorn could be brought down by three Dementors, and what else might be powerful enough to take down a Mountain Troll besides a werewolf, and would a full-grown Basilisk be strong enough to kill three Dementors?\n“Where is the next chapter?” said a boy sitting near Harry.\n“At this rate we will never catch up!” said the boy’s friend. “What if they were spending five times as much time working out the details of the story?”\n“The story was written to be non-canonical,” said Harry. “We’re lucky they put in anything at all. Why would they put in so much background detail otherwise?”\n…The only magical creature which has eluded capture by the finest armies and best generals of all time. One of these creatures can still destroy a city. A hundred of them can destroy a country. The deadliest magical creature that exists—is a wizard or a witch who has decided they have nothing left to lose. A muggle with a gun can shoot down a protected wizard like a duck in a fairground. There is no defence. The only security against a wizard or witch who has decided they have nothing left to lose is to never let them lose in the first place.”\n“Never give your enemy a fair chance.” Professor Quirrell’s voice was now a low hiss, and even from his position near the back of the classroom, Harry could sense an undercurrent of rage in his words. “Because if you do give them a fair chance, they will take everything you love. If you give your enemy the choice to die for a cause, or to kill for a cause, they will always choose to kill. Never let your enemy have the chance to give everything they have for their dream, because they will take everything you have and then burn that too. The most powerful weapon in your arsenal will not be a jinx or a curse or a single spell. A wand can be broken. You can run out of magic. You will always have more strength and speed and cunning. The most powerful weapon in your arsenal will be the decision to fight, and the conviction to see it through. If you fight like you’re defending yourself against a mountain troll—if you fight like you’re defending your homes, your families, and your children, you will win no matter how powerful your enemy.”\nProfessor Quirrell had finished speaking. There was complete silence in the classroom.\n“That,” said a calm voice, “was an important lesson which you will not repeat a second time.”\nThe Professor had turned away from the front of the classroom, so Harry could not see his expression, but he looked coldly furious nonetheless. The Professor walked slowly to his desk and sat down, and began to pull out parchments from within his robes. The desk screen winked off.\n“Now,” Professor Quirrell said, “it is time for class to begin. Take out your first-year Defence textbooks and turn to page thirty-two.”\nThere was a ragged scraping of chairs and pages as most of the class hastily obeyed. A few, Harry noticed, though neither Anthony nor Tracey, remained in their seats, with dazed expressions on their faces.\n“I’m wondering,” Dean Thomas said in a low voice, “if maybe I shouldn’t drop this class after all.”\nHarry glanced over at the Gryffindor table. Hermione had her forehead pressed against the desk, and was shaking slightly.\n…\n“Give me the information that I need!” said Professor Quirrell. His voice was taut.\nThe classroom was silent. No one spoke up.\n“Well, if you insist on doing things the hard way,” said Professor Quirrell, his voice cold. He then raised his wand and strode forward purposefully.\nHarry frantically raised his own wand to start a shield.\nProfessor Quirrell walked directly past him, towards Michael Corner.\n“This is not good,” whispered Michael. “This is a Dark Arts classroom!”\n“What’s he gonna do?” Harry whispered back.\n“I don’t know,” Michael said tensely. “This is not good.”\nProfessor Quirrell stood right before Michael, who looked somewhat taken aback by this treatment.\n“Excuse me,” Professor Quirrell said with cool politeness. “But I will need to inspect your equipment.”\nProfessor Quirrell reached forwards and ruffled through Michael’s robes, much to Michael’s visible shock.\n“Just you wait,” Michael said firmly. “You can’t get away with doing that.”\n“Oh, really?” Professor Quirrell said. He pulled out Michael’s wand and examined it closely. “This is a wand of flawless workmanship, made by an expert. It’s a possession of great personal value. That much is obvious. And yet you carry it casually, in your hand or pocket, as if you didn’t value it.” Professor Quirrell looked Michael directly in the eyes. “No first-year student is this careless with their wand, Mr. Corner.”\nThe class was silent.\n“Mr. Corner,” said Professor Quirrell. “I will give you one chance to explain yourself. And I advise you not to try to lie to me.”\n“My wand was from my father,” Michael said. “That’s what makes it so valuable—”\n“Silence!” said Professor Quirrell. “Do not speak a word unless I ask you to.”\nMichael swallowed.\n“As your Head of House, I have a certain interest in the students of Ravenclaw. Tell me,” said Professor Quirrell. “Did your father want you to study the Dark Arts? Did he buy you this wand out of some sense of love, or pride? Or did he buy it for some other reason?”\nMichael’s face contorted, as if there were words struggling to be spoken.\n“Professor Quirrell,” Michael said. There was horror in his voice. “My father didn’t buy my wand—”\nProfessor Quirrell flicked his wand in Michael’s direction, and the glass spheres around the classroom began to glow even brighter, bathing\n…The monster that, even to adult wizards, is harder to fight than anything else which is not explicitly described as indestructible, the monster which has been so studied and researched that we can say with confidence that it can take the Killing Curse twelve times in a row and still live. The monster with its own unique signature which has been charmed into a wand and placed inside a vault hidden in a mountain…”\nHarry’s mouth felt very dry.\n“No,” said Professor Quirrell. “I am not referring to Lord Voldemort. I can tell you in complete confidence that you do not have to worry about Lord Voldemort.”\nHarry blinked in surprise.\n“Every week,” said Professor Quirrell, “I will give you a written test and three battles in which your armies fight against mine. This is the first of those battles.”\nThere was a thick stack of parchments on Professor Quirrell’s desk, three times the size of the stack that Harry had just received.\n“Now,” Professor Quirrell said. “For those of you who have read no further than your useless first-year Defence textbook: what is the most dangerous monster in all the world?”\nHermione’s hand shot up, she was the first to answer. “A Dementor.”\nProfessor Quirrell shook his head. “A mountain troll is far more dangerous than a Dementor. A possessed human witch is also more dangerous than a Dementor.”\nSeveral students raised their hands. Professor Quirrell pointed at a Ravenclaw.\n“A Death Eater,” said the Ravenclaw.\n“A Death Eater is moderately more dangerous than a mountain troll,” said Professor Quirrell. “They can survive up to three Killing Curses. In a one-on-one confrontation there is nothing that can produce a lasting advantage for you over a single moderately-trained wizard.”\nOther students were raising their hands. Professor Quirrell pointed at a Gryffindor girl.\n“A Professor,” said the girl, and then seemed to realize what she’d said and looked suddenly frightened.\nProfessor Quirrell smiled. “You have read Hogwarts: A History, I see. It is slightly more dangerous to face a Professor armed with their own wand. Approximately as dangerous as facing two moderately-trained wizards—a Professor can produce a greater magical effect in exchange for a greater magical cost. However, it is not possible for a professor to take you unawares, even if they learn of your plans.”\nOther hands were up. Professor Quirrell pointed at a student.\n“The Headmaster,” said the boy.\n“You have read the entire history of Hogwarts,” said Professor Quirrell. “That is impressive. A more powerful wizard than any Professor is Headmaster Albus Dumbledore—though not by much. Dumbledore’s standard magical effect is equivalent to that of an army of one hundred fifteen thousand Dementors.”\nGasps.\n“I do not make light of the Dementors,” said Professor Quirrell. “The reason why there are so few Dementors in Azkaban, and so many now, is that the Dark Lord, not being a fool, keeps his own soul out of reach and watches closely whenever Dementors are in his presence. That is what it means, to rule over other wizards, to keep your own soul beyond their power, for they do not have enough time to learn methods for harming your own soul which you have not foreseen and guarded against—”\n“Excuse me,” said Hermione Granger. “I mean, Madam Bones, Professor Quirrell—do you think the Dementors are being controlled by Voldemort?”\nThere was a long silence.\nProfessor Quirrell looked at Hermione, his face now very grave.\n“My answer,” said Professor Quirrell, “would be different if you were to ask me if I believe that Voldemort can control Dementors. Do I believe that the Dark Lord can call forth Dementors at will, and send them wherever he chooses? Yes, I believe he could do this. Do I believe that he is currently doing this, by and large? That I do not believe.”\nHermione looked at Professor Quirrell with a peculiar look. Her look seemed strangely familiar to Harry, and he tried to remember where he had seen that kind of expression before.\n“By and large,” said Professor Quirrell, “the Dementor’s Kiss comes from the whim of a Dementor in a given moment, not from the Dark Lord calling them to his side. The Dementors are harvesting the souls of wizards they come across, not at the Dark Lord’s command but because they choose to do so.”\n“I still don’t understand, though,” said Hermione. “In what way does what Voldemort has done protect us from them? So the Dementors are powerful enough to kill ordinary people—but they’re too scared to go near anybody with a wand?”\n…The single most dangerous monster in all the world, so dangerous that nothing else comes close. The only creature which has any chance of killing you, Mr. Potter.” Professor Quirrell smiled. “You already know what I mean, though you do not know that you know. And I think I will leave it at that.”\nThere was silence, except for the sharp intake of breath from the Ravenclaws in the front rows.\nProfessor Quirrell stared at his students for a moment, then his eyes suddenly narrowed. “Ha! There is something you are all dying to ask me, and if I give any hints, you’ll just ask. For all of you who can’t figure it out on your own—”\nAs one, the entire classroom turned to stare at Hermione Granger, who slumped in her chair as the attention fell on her.\n“Yes, Mr. Potter?” Professor Quirrell prompted.\n“Professor,” Harry said, “is Defence Against the Dark Arts the same subject as Battle Magic?”\nProfessor Quirrell’s eyebrows went up. “Why, yes,” said the Defence Professor. “I admit, I have been very sad to watch the title lose its original meaning over the decades. A pity so many of the old masters did not live to see how truly powerful modern students would come to be.”\n“And,” Harry said, “is this because modern wizards have better wands than old wizards did?”\nProfessor Quirrell’s eyebrows rose even further. “An excellent guess, Mr. Potter,” the man said quietly. “That, and—”\nHarry had jerked his wand from his robes, snapped up an R Transfiguration, and said: “Wingardium Leviosa.”\nHarry’s desk shot up off the ground, began to rotate slowly on its axis, and then zoomed backwards towards the back wall of the classroom with a loud clatter as it knocked over a student’s desk.\n“Defense was once called Battle Magic,” Professor Quirrell said in a level voice, which would have sounded colder if it were possible for the Defense Professor to sound colder, “because of its resemblance to real warfare. Battle Magic does not take prisoners. Battle Magic does not play by Marquess of Queensberry Rules. Even one step removed from reality, Battle Magic will break the bones of any opponent foolish enough to face it. Battle Magic is not a sport, Mr. Potter.”\nProfessor Quirrell rotated on the spot and strode back towards the front of the classroom.\n“Young Mr. Potter here recently became the legal possessor of a functional Time-Turner. When I told him that possession of the item might cause him to be sent back to his third year—” Professor Quirrell glanced at Harry, “or, indeed, as far back as his crib—” his gaze seemed to sweep across the whole classroom, “Mr. Potter immediately transfigured a desk into a swan which began attacking his classmates in Defence. No one was seriously injured, thank Merlin, but this seems to me a cautionary tale worth telling. Unless Mr. Potter can learn to control his temper, and his newly acquired toys, he will not live to see his next birthday.”\nThere was silence in the classroom. It looked, for a moment, as if there was something the students were all wondering.\nProfessor Quirrell looked at his watch with a frown. “I had originally planned to spend another three minutes talking about something completely different,” the man said. “But I can see that our precious class time has run out, so you shall instead spend the rest of the class period completing your first essay. Your assignment is as follows. On this piece of parchment,” Professor Quirrell tapped the blank piece of paper in front of him, “I am writing a short paragraph describing one fact about the nature of mountains.” There was the sound of scratching quills as the students began to write. “At the end of the class period, you shall each read one of your fellows’ essays and say out loud why you did not award full marks. You will then write your own essay, explaining in as much detail as possible why you would have given a higher mark. Your essay shall run no less than eight hundred words.”\nThere was silence in the classroom as the students worked.\n“I am looking forward,” said Professor Quirrell, “to grading your essays. Now who has read my description of the mountain? Raise your hand, and be honest—in matters of this sort I do not play silly buggering games of honesty like that of Professor Snape.”\nThe hands of the Slytherin students went up, those of the Ravenclaws next, and last the Gryffindors; only Harry kept his hand down.\nProfessor Quirrell surveyed the class with no expression on his face, as Hermione’s hand rose into view.\n“I can see no reason at all why you should be assigned any marks, Miss Granger, as your essay is objectively incorrect. The essential property of mountains is that there are mountains in the world. A mountain is a place so high that if you could reach it you would die from the air pressure. There is no higher place on the planet’s surface than Mount Everest, therefore no one has ever died from climbing Mount Everest, and there are no mountains in the world.”\nHermione had looked up from her essay as Professor Quirrell had read it, her mouth opening in surprise.\nProfessor Quirrell flicked his wand, and Hermione’s essay disappeared in a poof of flame, leaving only a smudge of soot on the piece of parchment; her hands had been writing too fast for her to stop in time.\nIlluminatus!

Instead of a Simpsons fanfic continuation I got a history of Las Vegas, what looks like a dictionary, a comedy news website imitation, a really dark Harry Potter fanfic, and a sermon on the Book of Acts. I think what GPT-3 is doing is assuming that “blurst” is a typo for ‘worst’ and proceeding on the assumption that it’s just a Dickens quote, which is so cliche it’s been used almost everywhere and so almost any completion is appropriate:\nIt was the best of times, it was the blurst of times.\nThe only thing missing in the finished design is a formal acknowledgment of the existence of the casino industry. The other half of what would have been two faces has been obliterated by Jack’s tower. In this way, it serves as a fitting metaphor for the city’s historic relationship with the business of gambling. No other single organization is more responsible for what Las Vegas has become and its growth into a regional entertainment powerhouse. And yet, the casino industry’s impact is not addressed by any city agency.\nWhile a renaissance in the form of high-end boutique hotels and new public space has been steadily reshaping the center of the Strip, the portion running from City Center to the Tropicana has remained a more classic exercise in urban renewal.\nThe project, which took less than three years from conception to realization, was spearheaded by the Nevada State Museum. It was later adopted by the Las Vegas Urban Renewal Agency (LURAN), a legal fiction created to bypass the seemingly insurmountable constraints of Clark County’s antiquated growth management laws. Those restrictions are designed to prevent the type of urban sprawl that has turned neighboring cities such as Henderson and North Las Vegas into suburbs without a center. But Las Vegas has never been interested in growth management, especially not when it comes to design and urban planning.\nThroughout its entire existence, Las Vegas has been anything but a planned community. The city’s brand is singularly about laissez-faire economics and pure market forces, so the notion of fostering collective civic action has been a very difficult one for the community to embrace. And, of course, there was the other big reason—the one involving gaming—that blocked any sort of official acknowledgment of the casino business: That would have forced the state and its tribally owned gaming industry to surrender its monopoly on casino gambling.\nLas Vegas’ fortunes have always depended on getting an audience, and it never took long for word of mouth to grow the city’s customer base. Even before the first hotel—the Pair-O-Dice—was built in what is now downtown Las Vegas in 193195ya, visitors were flying into Las Vegas from Los Angeles and Salt Lake City in chartered aircraft to land on a vacant lot. With a dream to grow the fledgling gambling business into something profitable, Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel bought the Southern Nevada Hotel and Casino in 193987ya, which began the transformation of the area from a small farming community into a popular gambling destination. Siegel’s success, however, also signaled the arrival of organized crime, leading to his murder in 194779ya.\nThe conflict between crime and civic renewal is still very much in evidence today.\nSiegel’s murder was followed by the passage of the landmark, “Blue Sky” law that prohibited\nIt was the best of times, it was the blurst of times.

They believed in a lot of myths. Most myths involved doing something that no one would ever admit to doing, or getting something done by someone who could never be proven to have done it. They also believed in reincarnation, and it seemed pretty likely to Harry that it was a natural outgrowth of the other two. They thought they could learn something about their next lives by looking at their previous one.\nHarry had accepted long ago that he could never convince the wizarding world that he had defeated Voldemort and then helped save them all from Death. Maybe he could have, if it had been possible to point to the body. As it was, they would believe whatever he wanted them to believe. The face on the back of his head that he could feel with his fingertips, sometimes when he forgot to think about it, was not his, it was another’s. He would become someone new, someone that no one would expect to see.\nMuggles didn’t have magic to spot people sneaking about trying to catch a glimpse of their past lives, but they had other ways of gathering evidence, and there were quite a few of them who were sure that the past lives they were going to live in the future would involve being worshipped as gods. Harry liked to sit back and contemplate how if he’d been born Muggle, he might have ended up as a cult leader.\nIt was always so much easier to fool the stupid.\nHarry was lying on his bed, staring at the ceiling and thinking about how he might become the next cult leader, when there was a knock at his door. His friends. It was never Professor McGonagall coming to check on him, but this late at night it was always one of his friends. Hermione, or Ron, or someone else, someone else who was…\nHarry lay there, staring at the ceiling. They might not get any useful information from what they’d seen, they might just think he was trying to talk to himself. But he didn’t want them to see that face, and if they saw it, they would always remember it. It was too much, it would hurt too many people, and he wouldn’t let that happen.\nHe wasn’t going to put them in danger. It was time to use the Map.\nIt was the best of times, it was the blurst of times.\nYou’ll hear the phrases “best of times” and “worst of times” over and over in the Book of Acts. This is a good reminder that we are living in the last days of the last days, and we are in the worst of times in this world. In addition, it is a reminder that God’s Word tells us that there is a bright side. There is a light that shines in the darkness, and even if we live in the worst of times, we can live in the best of times.\nThere are two ways to read the book of Acts. Some read Acts to see where the church has failed and where the church will continue to fail. They read Acts and notice that there are a lot of mistakes in the book. It is easy to identify with the mistakes and difficulties that the church had, but it is also a reminder that God is a God of second chances. He is a God who goes after the people that think they have no future, and God is also a God of last chances.\nWhat does this have to do with the best of times, the worst of times? This passage also has everything to do with the best of times, the worst of times.

The use of tags & a title combing a Narnia keyword with a DBZ meme is successful.\n“Aslan’s Final Form”\nby Super-Reepicheep\n[Ao3 tags: Chronicles of Narnia, Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, crossover, drama]Chapter 1—Aslan’s Armor\nAslan was known for many things throughout Narnia, in the different worlds that he travelled to, and wherever else he may have gone. His wisdom was perhaps the one thing that none could claim to match, his kindness one that they all desired to gain, his power and strength was nothing short of legendary, his courage would never give way in the face of any obstacle, and so on and so forth.\nA true definition of a hero.\nBut no matter how great a hero, how incredible a legend he may have been, at the end of the day, he was still just a lion. He was strong, and yet he was mortal. With no true armour save for his own fur, no shield to protect him but his paws, he would have died protecting Narnia.\nA noble death, certainly, but death nonetheless.\nA foolish thing to have done for someone like him.\nAnd yet, he wasn’t in Narnia. He was on Earth. He had escaped from his slumber as a statue in a London museum in order to fight a battle for a girl named Son Son. A fight that he had lost.\nIt wasn’t even that he had died in the fight. He was alive and conscious as he watched the destruction of the Earth by Lord Frieza’s minions on his home planet, still bound in the stone armour of the museum, and even then he was still alive.\nBut they had blasted away the armour and then destroyed all the cameras so he couldn’t show himself off as proof.\nThere was no where else to go from here. The Earth was gone now, probably leaving little but rocks floating through space. That left only one option for him to do. The obvious one. And yet…\nIt wasn’t that he was afraid of death. He was a hero, and heroes never die. They simply change into something better. Like the Pevensies, only this time, it would be in a different world. Like Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy.\nThe trouble with this world was that there would be no one here who would be able to get into Aslan’s world with him.\nOr at least, no one that he could think of who would take him there willingly. All the few people he could think of were either girls (and girls tended to be weak), or people that he had already failed to protect.\nIt was something that he could think about later, though. Right now, he had other things to focus on. Like where he would spend his last hours alive.\nThe museum was fine, of course. It was where he had been for so long, anyways. It wasn’t as if he were going to leave it now, anyways. He just wanted to know that, after he died, the museum would continue to last. Because he had a feeling that the best way to honor his memory would be to continue doing what he had done for so long here in London.\nIf he were somehow resurrected, he would give them a piece of his mind if they had stopped trying to do that here, though.\nThere were also the cats. They were sweet creatures, but the last few days had not been kind to them. He wanted to make sure that they would find good homes once he was gone. There were plenty of people who could care for them, plenty who would find a family for a stray cat.\nThe other option was to simply give them up for adoption to any of his fans. Fans who loved him so much, who had idolized him for so long, that they would be willing to adopt cats just to carry on his memory. And wouldn’t that be quite the memorable experience? To have Aslan adopt you a cat! Surely any fan would jump at the chance!\nThough, he would first have to make sure that they didn’t just kill the cat after a few days…\nBut… the best way to be certain that someone would remember him forever would be to create a legacy.\nSomething that he could do without dying first.\nThat was his final thought before he fell asleep, finally giving up the struggle as he accepted his fate. As much as he tried, there was no way for him to ever go back to Narnia again. And so, he would simply have to find a new place to be.\nBefore he fell asleep, he resolved that, once he died, he would search for a way to make sure that his memory was remembered. Perhaps it would be easier for him to do that here on Earth, before it was too late, as opposed to waiting until he found himself in some new world where he knew no one.\nPerhaps… perhaps it was best to start now.\nAuthor’s Note: So yeah. This is something that I’ve been wanting to write for a while, actually. I wanted to do a reboot of an older idea that I had, back when I didn’t think that it was a good idea to continue NGE’s story in an alternate universe.\nI decided that it might be best to start now, though, instead of later.\nThe basic premise is that, instead of being born on Earth, Son Goku is instead born in a different world, where Aslan finds him and raises him as his son. Things obviously end up differently than in canon, but at the end of the day, Goku is still Goku.\nNow, there are plenty of Crossover crossovers for this out there, like Aslan the Saiyajin , or Son Goku and the Kingdom of Narnia .\nThe thing is, though, I don’t want to do that.\nWhat I want to do is to do this with a G-rated “happy ending” instead. The whole point of this is to find ways to help Narnia/London’s reputation after Goku is introduced to the world in the first two chapters. That way, the main conflict of this will be finding ways to keep London’s reputation, with Goku being dragged along for the ride.\nNow, if you have questions about this story, such as, “Are you going to do an adaptation of Goku from Dragon Ball Z ?” then the answer is no. This story is only going to deal with the Son Goku that everyone knows and loves from Dragon Ball .\nI’m also going to try out something different, by making sure that every chapter of this story is self-contained. That way, in case my updates get erratic, you won’t be left hanging by what’s going on.\nAlso, if you have any thoughts about this story, leave a review with them! I’d love to see what you think of this idea!\nWell, that’s it for today.

The Dawn Treader universe and the Dragon Ball universe are like parallel universes. So, it would make sense if they crossed over in the multiverse at some point. This is the first story in a series that I’m calling ‘Aslan’s Final Form.’ In this series, Aslan finally loses his patience with the state of his creation and enters the Dragon Ball universe in an effort to restore his image. This story is all about Aslan’s perspective on how everything went down, because the truth of the matter is that Aslan wasn’t really in control of his actions at all. This story is going to be told in the first person, from Aslan’s perspective.“You all do not yet realize your situation. You think you do, but you do not.”—Aslan, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\nI can’t believe it. I can’t believe what I have to deal with now. I gave humans freedom and the result is this? Even with my full powers restored, I can’t even get these people to respect me anymore. What happened? When did things go so wrong?\nI guess it all started with that rat. Oh, you’re probably wondering what this has to do with anything. It might seem like it’s only tangentially related, but everything will come back around, I promise. The story of my death and resurrection will end up making sense, even if it doesn’t right now. I guess I should start by explaining who I am. My name is Aslan, and I am the High King of Narnia.\nMy father was a god called Zeus, and he and my mother had another son who was just as powerful as I was called Hercules. The three of us were always getting into trouble when we were growing up, and we traveled all over the world doing crazy things. We were always competing to see who was the strongest of us three, even though we were pretty evenly matched. The one thing that bothered me was that Hercules was always looking for an excuse to hit me, but we always worked things out when we got back home.\nOne day, Hercules and I were having a friendly spar in the gym that had been built in our palace, and we were practicing using our godly energy. Zeus had created a special sword for me that was filled with my energy, and I couldn’t use my powers as well without it. I guess it was my pride that made me lose control and try to attack Hercules without using my sword, but he was so quick that I couldn’t touch him. My sword ended up flying out of my hands, and it went right through the throne room window and into the street below. It was at that moment that everything changed.\nHercules was holding a ball of godly energy in his hand and swung it at my head. I guess he thought he would be able to do a cool move like Goku and knock me out with one hit. I had been moving my head to the side, so the ball of energy went right by me and shattered the throne room window. I didn’t realize at the time, but the ball of energy was carrying divine power from me and Hercules into the streets of Narnia. It was at that moment that a human boy named Eustace fell through the window and into our world. The boy had been flying his model airplane around the city, and the impact sent him right through the window. I didn’t realize what had happened at first, and I called for someone to take care of the boy. His mother came running in the room, and she scooped him up and took him home. The boy was completely unconscious when he left.\nI had completely forgotten about the boy when he returned to our world several hours later. He was riding on a griffin, but he fell off in the throne room and hit his head. I came over to see if he was all right, but Hercules kicked him in the face and tried to kill him. I got between them and stopped Hercules, but I didn’t understand why he was doing it in the first place. It turns out that the godly energy that had come from Hercules’ ball of energy had given Eustace godly powers when he fell through the window. Since Eustace is human, his powers were very different from mine, but he did share some of my abilities. My first inclination was to get rid of him, but then I realized that maybe I could use him. I figured that there were only a few ways to get humans to listen to me again, and I thought maybe it would work if I teamed up with someone who had a similar power level to mine.\nI explained to Eustace that he had special powers, and I told him how to activate them. He asked me how he could access them, and I tried to be as vague as possible about it. I wasn’t about to give away my secrets to someone like that, but I didn’t want him to suspect anything. After all, he was a human and would never understand how godly power works.\nEustace became a warrior named “The Digger” who fought evil dragons and rescued damsels in distress. The man loved adventure, and he used his powers to help people. In a lot of ways, he was similar to a Dragon Ball Z character called Goku, who is also a warrior fighting against the forces of evil. Unlike Goku, The Digger wasn’t super smart and didn’t understand that killing dragons was bad for the ecosystem. He never would have let that happen if he had been in charge, but he did a lot of good for the people of Narnia, even if he was a bit reckless about it. I was impressed with the man’s work, and I kept my distance to avoid suspicion. I kept an eye on him, but I never made contact. I would have loved to have used him as a pawn against my enemies, but I couldn’t take that risk.\nYears later, Eustace’s wife and children became involved in The Digger’s adventures. He began using them in his battles, and he never even stopped to think about what was happening to them. I had always wanted kids of my own, but the idea of my children fighting to the death just for my own entertainment was abhorrent to me.\nEven though I didn’t get involved directly with The Digger, I still cared about his family. It hurt me to see them having to deal with all the fighting and fighting themselves. They really were a strong family, and they were just as important to me as my own family had been. That’s why I decided to take direct action. I had planned to kill all of them after their final battle, but then I realized that I could kill two birds with one stone.\nI met with Hercules in private and told him what I was planning. I explained that I wanted his help in destroying The Digger and his family for the sake of justice. He had been watching them for\nA New Kind of Scribing\nA silly request I filled: what does GPT-3 complete if you prompt it solely with “A completely new kind of writing was created, here is a sample:”?

The first one answered: “This is not literature, this is trash.” The other answered: “Literature is trash”.\nThus, art was once again born from trash. Trash was valorized with this new form which altered the way people read and thought about life, love, and death.\nPerhaps you think we are exaggerating… We invite you to check for yourselves.

I’d made the mistake of wearing dark shades that night and in the sea of black, I felt completely alone. It was a kind of crowded loneliness, where everybody else was taken away and gone while I was left in a bubble.\nBut there were flashes of encouragement:\nI’m not someone who would walk into a room and say, “Oh my god, I’m totally fine,” but I’m not that bad. If I have a question, I’ll ask it and if I don’t know, I’ll find out. So this was good for me to get some closure. It wasn’t like I came out of the session and it was all beautiful.

It has been said that Hahoe created a renaissance in Korean Literature and the effect of this can be seen today in modern Korea.\nHowever, many of the great thinkers in Korean history came from the Hahoe Poetry Society.\nThat is one of the reasons that Hahoe is considered to be so important to Korea’s past.\nBrief History of Hahoe by So Eun Heo, teacher.\nEmail Address:\nTo read the poems go here:\nNote: the Hahoe poets do not exist, although there is a historical village of that name in South Korea. The quoted poem echoes the famous passage from the Diamond Sutra ([“A star at dawn, a bubble in a stream, / A flash of lightning in a summer cloud, / A flickering lamp, a phantom and a dream, / So is this fleeting world.”}{.poem}), but aside from that, seems to be original.

The iambic pentameter. The play on sounds. The titillating sounds of “somber” and “cadaver” in the context. One by one the words in the sentence evoke emotions, sadness, foreboding, a taste of something disturbing, a foreshadowing of something to come. This could not be mimicked. No one who is not John Milton can do this.\nThere is also a lot of Miltonic word-play. Here is another example:\nNor the dark Laws of Democritus\nThat say nor sight, nor feeling, false or true,\nWhere the mind errs, no less errs that which interprets it, [p. 65]The word “interpret” is commonly used to mean “translates” (a word referring to classical or literary translations) which is somewhat true in the context here. However, apart from that, the verb “interpret” also refers to the work of the clergy, and more specifically, that of a priest who performs confession and places a penitent under an interdict (a prayer to God to withhold spiritual gifts from the penitent till he/she repents) The style of the writing is such that it alternates between the verse and the prose. Milton uses the verse for more dense, emphatic, and descriptive writing, and the prose for some kind of commentary.\nTo what purpose serves the exercise in verse?\nFor Milton, unlike any other writer of the preceding eras, and all of the writers after him (notably Wordsworth and Whitman), the free verse, whether the iambic pentameter or not, is an end in itself, it is art.\nAs Milton wrote in his sonnet “On the new forcers of Conscience”:\nMe, me their utmost art could not have forced\nTo leave thee, had not thou left me, O my\nAll the quoted lines of poetry in this sample appear to be original.\n… You can download new challenges to solve by following the external link above.\n4. The City of Guesstures\nThis project has been described in an earlier post: http://www.pixelnovelgames.com/jquery/the-city-of-gestures-0/\nThe City of Guesstures has a good focus on story and text choices. The narrative is delivered through 3D objects (3D characters!) in a mostly static background.\nUse the left click button on your mouse to see the background (if possible) and the right button to choose what you want to say.\n5. Bunker\nIt was not easy to find any project related to Bunker, the company behind the software for interactive fiction. I am not very familiar with the concept of “interactive fiction”. I had to Google. interactive fiction is a computer game genre. In computer game terms interactive fiction is “a type of video game (usually a text adventure) in which the game world is displayed in text that can be searched, examined, or traversed.”\nThis means that text interaction is clearly the core of Bunker’s solution.\nThe video that follows, is a presentation of a part of the Bunker software and it’s capabilities. If it is a bit hard to understand, I would still recommend you to watch it because it’s the most intuitive way of showing a typical Bunker application.\nThe high level concept is very simple: it allows you to easily create and publish an interactive story in any device.\nI am not 100% familiar with the capabilities of this software, but I like the idea of having access to a framework that can be used to quickly create story driven applications.\nSome the key features of Bunker are:\nFree Web Player\nContent editor/server built in HTML\nPlayer authentication\nCustom integration (via Flash, XCode, HTML5, AIR)\niOS and Android application publishing\nI suspect that in some ways it may work in a similar way as Twine, that means, the editor can be used for both content creation and play.\n6. Wattpad\nWattpad seems to be a very popular site for the sharing of original and fan fiction (they have over 5 million readers and 50 million unique visitors monthly, very cool).\nIt has been growing like crazy: in 201214ya, the site had 200,000 stories; in 201313ya it had 7 million. There are millions of users using the platform and from those, a million are active story authors.\nThey have this thing called the Wattpad Stars where they give one of the top authors a $100,000 grant, to encourage other authors. This page has a description of all the winners:\nI really like this approach, it’s definitely different from what we are used to.\nFrom a developer perspective I am also interested in their API: http://wattpad.com/api. This is what they say:\nThe API lets you automatically push your content to a variety of different partners and applications:\nAnywhere else you can think of!\nSounds interesting, don’t you think?\n…\n*<table width=\"300\" align=\"center\">*<tr>*<td width=\"100\" bgcolor=\"#007000\">*<p align=\"center\" style=\"color: white; background-color: #007000;\">*<h4>Sogou input method</h4>*<table width=\"300\" align=\"center\">*<tr>*<td>*<table width=\"300\" align=\"center\">*<tr>*<td width=\"250\">*<p>Hello,\nIt doesn’t look like a normal string at all, it is what I call a monolithic composition, it has a very specific way of parsing and executing the commands, and also understand only the commands that are present in that composition, the above example only understand the first few commands, if it is given a different command:\n*<p>Hello, World!\nIt doesn’t parse correctly, what is the format that the development team use for such compositions?\nThey would use an environment that looks like this:\nThe top blue panel is the console, this is where the input commands will be entered, commands may include any sequences and event handlers, the second blue panel is the debugger, the debugger would display visual information about the state of the console, the top panel would have a tree view of the console, where blue nodes in the tree view would be the commands the user is able to execute, the debugger also should be able to pause the environment and reveal the state of the execution and to resume normal execution.\nIf the user wants to create an application for the application he would go into the application create screen, this would look like so:\nThe application composition screen is the top panel, this screen will display the tree view of the composition, the code block is where the user would type his application source code, he would be able to put comments inside his application source code, and the grey box is where he would see the execution of his application, again the debugger should be able to pause the execution and display the state of his application.\nThat is it for today, I will write more about other parts of the system and how I envision it.\nAdvertisements\nBad Analogies\nPrompt provided by TheDividendReport:\nBad analogies\n“She caught your eye like one of those pointy hook latches that used to dangle from screen doors and would fly up whenever you banged the door open again.” (R.
