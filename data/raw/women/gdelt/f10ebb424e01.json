The Foundation funding will provide a financial boost helping energise communities so they can continue to build for a brighter future.\"\nKey themes for funding in 2023 include: heart disease, support for victims of domestic violence, environment and sustainability, food relief, youth skills and education, multicultural support and volunteer services.\nFor more information about IMB Bank Community Foundation visit imb.com.au/community.\nSouth Coast community groups and projects funded by IMB Bank Community Foundation in 2023:\n- Batemans Bay Surf Life Saving Club - Supporting the Batemans Bay Nipper and Junior Lifesaving Program which runs from October to March to raise awareness of water safety and skills amongst vulnerable community members.\n- Community Workshed - Purchase of a band saw and lathe for participants with special needs.\n- Eurobodalla Volunteer Operations Support Rural Fire Brigade - Purchase of equipment to support work-related activities of the Brigade.\n- Eurobodalla Woodcraft Guild - Purchase of tools and equipment so that members can participate in projects, supporting their social and mental wellbeing.\n- Friends of Eurobodalla Regional Botanic Garden - Purchase of marquees to be used for community events, and entertainment activities for children and families.\n- Long Beach Community Association - Purchase of equipment for Plotters Community Garden to benefit the local community.\n- Surfair Motor Sports Club - Delivery of the Teensafe driver education program for L and P plate drivers.\n- The Narooma Rescue Squad - Purchase of a new battery-operated spreader and ram for road crash rescue incidents.\n- Volunteer Marine Rescue NSW - Purchase of equipment to support volunteer radio operators.\n- Zonta Club of Berry Inc - Providing resettlement baskets to women and children affected by domestic violence exiting the local refuge.\n- Supported Accommodation and Homelessness Services Shoalhaven Illawarra (SAHSSI) - Security at Women's Crisis Accommodation - Providing additional video security systems to crisis accommodations in Dapto and Nowra to support women who have experienced domestic violence.\n- Bay & Basin Cancer Support Group - Purchase of home care support equipment for those going through cancer treatment.\n- Football South Coast - Raising awareness for Walking Football - a weekly program targeted at senior players and players who are unable to run due to injury or physical restriction.\n- Lifeline South Coast (NSW) - Supporting the delivery of the Lifeline South Coast Big Book Fair in Wollongong to raise funds for suicide prevention and crisis support services.\n- Bega District Volunteer Rescue Group - Purchase of a Pentheon Ram and extension to fit out the rescue vehicle.\n- Native Animal Education Sanctuary - Educational signs to support conservation, education and community in the Bega Valley.\n- Sapphire Community Projects - Saving Lives\n- Southern Women's Group - WRC Recovery Sanctuary -Creating a specific trauma informed 'Recovery Sanctuary' space at the Bega Women's Resource Centre for women to heal, reflect and ground themselves.\n- Towamba Rural Fire Brigade - Establishing a fire fighter in the shed for essential communication with the crew during fire emergencies.\n- Yass Valley Men's Shed - Construction of a new workshop to encourage more local membership for greater social connection and skills development.\nOur journalists work hard to provide local, up-to-date news to the community.
