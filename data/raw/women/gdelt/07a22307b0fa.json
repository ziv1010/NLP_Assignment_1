I support this review and look forward to getting back on air.”\nHe added on Twitter: “After a surreal few days, I’m delighted that we have navigated a way through this. I want to thank you all for the incredible support, particularly my colleagues at BBC Sport, for the remarkable show of solidarity. Football is a team game but their backing was overwhelming.\nAfter a surreal few days, I’m delighted that we have navigated a way through this.

Football is a team game but their backing was overwhelming. 1/4\n— Gary Lineker 💙💛 (@GaryLineker) March 13, 2023\n“I have been presenting sport on the BBC for almost three decades and am immeasurably proud to work with the best and fairest broadcaster in the world. I cannot wait to get back in the MOTD chair on Saturday.\n“A final thought: however difficult the last few days have been, it simply doesn’t compare to having to flee your home from persecution or war to seek refuge in a land far away. It’s heartwarming to have seen the empathy towards their plight from so many of you.\n“We remain a country of predominantly tolerant, welcoming and generous people. Thank you.\n“Also, I’d like to thank Tim Davie for his understanding during this difficult period. He has an almost impossible job keeping everybody happy, particularly in the area of impartiality. I am delighted that we’ll continue to fight the good fight, together.”\nDirector-general Tim Davie, who was forced to apologise for the impacted schedule on Saturday, again apologised to viewers as well as staff who have been affected by the saga before announcing a review into the BBC’s current rules and particularly how they should apply to freelancers such as Lineker.\nAdvertisement\nHe said in a statement: “The BBC is announcing a review led by an independent expert – reporting to the BBC – on its existing social media guidance, with a particular focus on how it applies to freelancers outside news and current affairs. The BBC and myself are aware that Gary is in favour of such a review.\n“Shortly, the BBC will announce who will conduct that review. Whilst this work is undertaken, the BBC’s current social media guidance remains in place. Gary is a valued part of the BBC and I know how much the BBC means to Gary and I look forward to him presenting our coverage this coming weekend.”\nThe corporation’s decision to stand Lineker down sparked a chaotic few days with mass walkouts of pundits and commentators causing unprecedented disruption to programming.\nBoycotts from the likes of Ian Wright, Alex Scott and Mark Chapman caused Match of the Day to run for just 20 minutes without presentation or commentary, Football Focus and Final Score to be taken off air entirely and Radio Five Live to drastically cut planned coverage.\nGO DEEPER\nMatch of the Day without Gary Lineker: Eerie images, broadcast apologetically by BBC\nSunday’s broadcast of the Women’s Super League match between Chelsea and Manchester United included no presenters or analysis and world feed commentary before Match of the Day 2 followed a similarly condensed and commentary-free format as the flagship show the night previous.\nRadio schedules throughout the weekend were slashed with Fighting Talk and 606 on Five Live scrapped on Saturday and the usual presenter-led coverage of Premier League action significantly dialled back.\nAfter discussions over a collective response, Premier League players and managers were not asked to undertake their usual media duties for Match of the Day with the PFA and LMA pledging to support all members over any consequences they might have faced for choosing not to complete their broadcast commitments.\nAdvertisement\nLineker, who first presented Match of the Day in 1999, criticised the UK government’s new asylum policy in a tweet on March 7.\nHe wrote on Twitter: “There is no huge influx. We take far fewer refugees than other major European countries. This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s, and I’m out of order?”\nLineker’s post drew criticism from UK home secretary Suella Braverman and culture secretary Lucy Frazer among others but also saw support from fellow high-profile media figures such as Piers Morgan.\nBut the situation escalated on Friday afternoon when the BBC released a statement confirming that Lineker was being stood down.\nA statement issued by the broadcaster read: “The BBC has been in extensive discussions with Gary and his team in recent days. We have said that we consider his recent social media activity to be a breach of our guidelines.\n“The BBC has decided that he will step back from presenting Match of the Day until we’ve got an agreed and clear position on his use of social media. When it comes to leading our football and sports coverage, Gary is second to none.\n“We have never said that Gary should be an opinion-free zone, or that he can’t have a view on issues that matter to him, but we have said that he should keep well away from taking sides on party political issues or political controversies.”\nGO DEEPER\n'Meltdown': Inside the BBC's Gary Lineker drama\nUK prime minister Rishi Sunak called the situation a matter for the BBC and Lineker to settle, not the government.\n“Gary Lineker was a great footballer and is a talented presenter,” he said on Saturday. “I hope that the current situation between Gary Lineker and the BBC can be resolved in a timely manner, but it is rightly a matter for them, not the government.”\nDavie has now admitted that the BBC’s policy must be looked into after a chastening weekend.\nAdvertisement\nHis statement added: “Everyone recognises this has been a difficult period for staff, contributors, presenters and, most importantly, our audiences. I apologise for this. The potential confusion caused by the grey areas of the BBC’s social media guidance that were introduced in 2020 is recognised. I want to get matters resolved and our sport content back on air.\n“Impartiality is important to the BBC. It is also important to the public. The BBC has a commitment to impartiality in its Charter and a commitment to freedom of expression. That is a difficult balancing act to get right where people are subject to different contracts and on air positions, and with different audience and social media profiles.\n“The BBC’s social media guidance is designed to help manage these sometimes difficult challenges and I am aware there is clearly a need to ensure that the guidance is up to this task. It should be clear, proportionate, and appropriate.”\nLineker will return to screens for BBC One’s live coverage of the Manchester City vs Burnley FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday evening.\nGO DEEPER\nIt is the BBC, not Gary Lineker, who have scored the spectacular own goal\n(Photo: Hollie Adams/Getty Images)",
