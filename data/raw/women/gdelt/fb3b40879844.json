Ex-footballer Paul Merson follows closely behind Knowles with odds of 11/4; perhaps the sports pundit will surprise fans with a transfer of his moves from the football pitch to the dance floor.\n\"Odds are also in for which professional dancer is going to take home the win. South African dancer, Johannes Radebe, is leading these odds at 6/1.\n\"This will be Johannes’ first win in his five, soon to be six, series of Strictly Come Dancing UK if he succeeds.”",
