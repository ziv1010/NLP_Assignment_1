I hope your 2023 is off to a great start and your resolutions aren’t already broken.\nOver here at KSR HQ, a double espresso shot with a side of black coffee is fueling the early start to today as we close the book on the busy weekend that included Saturday’s noon doubleheader, plus all of the other New Year’s weekend excitement.
