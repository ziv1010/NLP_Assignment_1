  "body_text": "Latest Headlines\nBrands, Events that Shaped 2024\nThough a challenging year for businesses, for some brands, 2024 is a defining moment as a result of their resilience and innovative approach to the market, which gave them an edge. Raheem Akingbolu reports.\nUBA @ 75\nIn a market where the mortality rate is high, and many companies will graciously roll out the drum to celebrate their 10th anniversary, this year, the United Bank of Africa celebrated its 75 years of existence with many accomplishments.\nThe story of today’s UBA is that of not giving up despite all odds. Like every corporate entity, UBA has recorded both low and high moments but its promoters have consistently fixed their eyes on the ball and remain guided by the vision of its founding fathers, which is to be the undisputed leading and dominant financial services institution in Africa.\nPerhaps the number one factor that has continuously worked for the brand lies in its name -United Bank for Africa. True to its name, UBA became stronger as a real bank of destiny, after the industry consolidation between 2004 and 2005, which changed the dynamics of banking in the country.\nWhile it belonged to the exclusive club of first-generation banks, UBA has been able to combine age with modernism that warmed into the minds of its customers. Through innovation, global best practices, and commitment to its patrons, 2024 remains a success story for the Tony Elumelu-led financial giant. As a socially responsible brand, this week, the bank donated N500 Million to the Lagos State Security Trust Fund and promised to consistently support the state’s effort at improving security.\nARISE TV as Challenger of Status Quo\n12 years after Nigeria’s media entrepreneur, Prince Nduka Obaigbena, sowed the seed for an international media platform -Arise Television, the brand appears to have redefined news consumption and successfully created a stronger platform for African advertisers to leverage on.\nIn 2024, Arise Television successfully raised the stake and emerged as the undisputable market leader by revolutionising Broadcast Journalism. As a premium brand, Arise, in 2024, challenged the status quo and the monopolistic posture of the existing brand in the category.\nLike a phoenix from the ashes, Arise Television suddenly became a sensation and toast of all during the #EndSARS imbroglio in 2021. For the dexterity and daring stance of the Arise TV crew, who were on the field at the peak of the protest against police brutality, the brand warmed itself into the hearts of television viewers.\nPerhaps the icing on the cake was the live stream of the broadcast from the scene of the Lekki Toll Gate Shootings and many other protest grounds, which aired on various platforms like DStv channel 416, YouTube, Twitter, and the Arise TV website. This was happening at a crucial time when Nigerians desired trusted news sources, considering that a lot of information — both genuine and questionable — had been making the rounds on social media and traditional news outlets.\nIt was not long before social media went awash with many influencers endorsing the station as the star station of the resistance of young Nigerians who wanted a positive change for the country. Arise Television thus earned a superbrand status from this protest. But for its outstanding performance in reporting the protest, perhaps many viewers, who had earlier regarded the brand as too elitist, wouldn’t have known the stuff it was made of.\nSince then, Arise Television has been a top-of-the-mind brand, with many analysts and observers viewing it as the only television station in Nigeria with an international template. To this end, top corporate brands that were used to struggling for advertising exposure on CNN and BBC started looking inward to place their ad on Arise Television.\nThen came 2023. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), had just lifted a ban on political campaigning for the general elections. Political analysts were moving from one television station to the other to set an agenda for the players on the field. Spokespersons of various presidential candidates and political parties were also on the prowl to sell their candidates. Again, the Arise brand suddenly became a game changer. In 2024, Arise sustained the tempo in politics, business, and entertainment.\nFirst Bank’s ‘Giant in You’\nFor the 13O-year-old First Bank Plc, its ‘Giant in you’ campaign in 2024 again confirmed the common expression that ‘apple doesn’t fall far from the tree’ given the history of the financial brand and its legendary relevance to the growth of enterprises, within and outside Nigeria.\nIn its usual creative conjecture, the bank hit the airwaves and other media outlets with various visuals to articulate the new campaign, ‘The Giant in You.’\nBreaking down the central message, ‘there is a giant in you’ the campaign stylishly reminds the bank customer that ‘First Bank Puts You First so you can’ before giving the match order, ‘Live the Giant-Life. For a bank that settles for the big ‘elephant’ as its logo and has remained strong for 130 years, words like giant, tall, and strides, used in the various visuals, are simply validations of its robustness, endurance, doggedness, and tall ambition.\nAs part of the ways to convey the bank’s message to its array of patrons, SO&U, the creative agency behind the campaign cleverly selected its cast and buildings, including First Bank’s corporate headquarters, to reflect the bigness, the tallness, and the boldness of the 130-year-old financial institution to rule the world as far as banking and business support are concerned.\nX3M Ideas as ‘African Agency of the Year’\nIn 2024, X3M Ideas, a creative agency under the leadership of Nigeria’s king of modern Advertising, Steve Babaeko, consolidated its global relevance by clinching ‘African Agency of the Year’ for the second time at the 8th African Cristal Awards held in Casablanca, Morocco.\nMeanwhile, like the 2023 edition of the competition, which was a double celebration for the agency, the feat was achieved again in 2024 as Babaeko was named African Personality of the Year. Last year, the agency broke a 70-year jinx to become the first-ever Nigerian and West African agency to win at the Cannes Lions International Festival for Creativity.\nEarly this year, at the 2024 ACT Good Report, the same creative firm earned another global recognition, which further re-positioned Nigeria’s creative industry.\nIn the ACT Good Report ranking released in April, “Motherhood Sentence,” a campaign from the stable of X3M Ideas, secured 38th place in the best 40 ranked campaigns selected from over 1,250 campaigns reviewed by the editorial team of the ranking institution.\nThe report also indicated that X3M Ideas achieved 12th place among the best 25 agencies in the world. The ACT Good Report also reviewed and ranked the 20 most successful networks, and the 10 most successful brands promoting Sustainability in the world.\nHowever, for many observers, the agency’s annual CSR, which touched on equipping the next generation of Nigerians with technological skills this year is the most charitable. This year, X3M Tech training, an initiative designed to nurture the youths, produced a new set of students, who have successfully completed training in relevant areas at a graduation ceremony held at Muritala Ajadi Animashaun Community Senior Grammar School, Surulere, Lagos.\nARCON and N605.2b Industry Value\nAs a Chartered Accountant and fellow of the Advertising Regulatory Council of Nigeria (ARCON), the current Director General of the council surely came into office prepared. Aside from the various regulatory frameworks put in place to protect local businesses and the economy, ARCON under Fadolapo is concerned about facts and figures.\nA landmark achievement of the council in 2024 was the report it commissioned, which revealed the advertising sector’s contribution to the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and put the value of the industry at N605.2 billion as of 2023.\nThe report was carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopes (PwC) and funded by various industry associations within the industry.\nWith the revelation, the marketing communications sector thus emerged as a formidable economic powerhouse. The study estimates that for every N1 spent on marketing communications in Nigeria, the nation’s GDP increases by a staggering N16.5 – a multiplier effect that highlights the industry’s substantial value contribution.\nAccording to the study, the total expenditure on marketing communications reached an impressive N605.2 billion in 2023, having grown at a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.7% over the past six years, from N216 billion in 2018. This trajectory is projected to continue, with spending expected to reach N893 billion by 2028, contributing a significant 1.08% to Nigeria’s GDP, up from 0.7% in 2023.\nDangote Brand rating\nPerhaps the biggest news in Nigeria’s Oil and Gas sector in 2024 was the commencement of operation at the Dangote Refineries. It was like a soothing balm amid the debate over the removal of oil subsidies by the federal government.\nBut beyond the feat achieved with the refineries, the Dangote brand and its main spin doctor, the Group Head of Corporate Communications, Dangote Group, Anthony Chiejina, were also listed by recognised rating firms in 2024 as the best in Nigeria.\nFor the 7th time in 2024, Dangote Industries again solidified its position as Nigeria’s Most Valuable Brand in the Top 50 Brands Nigeria rankings. As a formidable force driving growth and transformation across Africa, it continues to set the pace, demonstrating the strength and potential of Nigerian home-grown brands on the global stage.\nIn the same way, a global PR firm, Provoke Media, listed Chiejina, as one of the “100 most influential communications and marketing executives in the world 2024.”\nAirtel and the ‘King of Steeze’\nTo say the profile of the Airtel brand has consistently been on the rise in the last few years is like stating the obvious. Until it finally changed from Zain Nigeria to Airtel Nigeria, change has almost become the most constant feature of the brand.\nUnder new management and Noah’s Ark as a new Creative agency, while CMC Connect handles its PR account, fortune smiled at Airtel through remarkable campaigns and activation. Today, the telco brand has reclaimed its prime position in the industry. In the year under review and in a most surprising move, part of the creative accounts of the brand moved from Noah’s Ark to a little-known ‘The Hook’ while Insight Publicis held on to 60% of the creative business.\nTwo months ago, the Airtel brand launched a new television campaign showcasing its Home Broadband services, with popular influencer Farooq Oreagba, also known as the “King of Steeze,” starring in the advertisement. Oreagba, a top corporate player in the financial sector became an instant celebrity following his exceptional appearance at the annual Ojude Oba festival in Ijebu Ode, Ogun State.\nThe commercial emphasizes Airtel’s commitment to offering seamless, high-speed internet access for Nigerian households, enabling Nigerians to unlock new opportunities in business, education, entertainment, and family life.\nThe ad’s message, “Live Limitless,” which was well leveraged by CMC Connect, promotes the idea that Airtel Home Broadband is more than just a product—it’s a pathway to boundless potential.\nLooking back at the story behind what is today known as the Airtel brand is both intriguing and exciting.\nThough the first to launch with a hypothetical campaign theme, ‘Your cellular network,’ which ran for a short time, the brand’s creative advertising had encountered brand positioning challenges over the years.\nIt was originally launched into the market as Econet, with Insight Grey as the creative powerhouse. Not long after its launch, it changed its pay-offline to ‘inspired to change your world’. Indeed, the vicissitudes of brand ownership and management have greatly impacted the brand’s positioning.\nAs the populace was about settling down to appreciate the value offering and brand essence of Econet, it went on a failed romance with Vodacom. While the marriage was being finalised for consummation, things went awry, and the Econet brand was left high and dry while Vodacom took to its heels.\nUnbeaten, yet injured, the owners of the brand went ahead and eventually got the brand transformed into V-Mobile. It later came up with the ‘It’s all about you’ pay-offline after it dumped Vodacom’s largest network in Africa.\nThe brand’s advertising later moved from Insight to Centrespread. A little part of it was given to Rosabel Leo Burnet in what industry pundits said was a strategic exploration to fill a creative lacuna.\nIn yet another ownership challenge occasioned by the paucity of funds, V-Mobile, which had consciously contended with the number two position in the GSM telephony market, was also acquired by Celtel. This was, in turn, acquired by Zain Africa and was finally acquired by Airtel.\nACCESS Bank\nFor the Access Bank brand, 2024 is a combination of both the good, the bad, and the ugly. But in all the brand came out stronger and better. The year started well, and expectations were high, but the sudden death of Access Bank Group CEO Herbert Onyewumbu Wigwe turned out to be the straw that broke the camel’s back.\nBut it turned out to be a temporary setback as the bank soon readjusted and forged ahead. Today, the Access Bank’s landmark achievement in 2024 has become a memorable legacy for the late Banker. For instance, at this year’s edition of the Lagos PR Industry and Gala Awards (LaPRIGA), Access Bank was named the Most Reputable Brand in Nigeria.\nA few months ago, for the 3rd consecutive time, the bank was named the ‘Most Valuable Brand’ in Nigeria, thereby confirming that the financial brand is not an accidental brand but a deliberate brand conceptualized by the fertile minds of core professionals who want to proudly represent Africa by building a global brand.\nThe 2024 analysis of the latest Brand Finance report showed a significant 73 percent increase in Access Bank’s brand value, reinforcing its status as one of the continent’s leading banking brands and clearly Nigeria’s top financial institution, per Brand Finance’s annual ranking of the world’s Top 500 Banking Brands.\nIn this year’s edition, the bank also led the rankings in terms of sustainability perceptions value, surpassing Flour Mills of Nigeria, which ranked second.\nGlobacom ‘s Data roaming campaign\nAmong other initiatives embarked upon in 2024 by Globacom to further extend its frontier, its creative agency -X3M Ideas developed a data roaming campaign to position the telco’s data roaming packs. It has turned out to be a masterstroke and a strong campaign that resonated with Glo subscribers globally. For instance, the moment the 2024 Olympic Games kicked off in Paris, France, recently Nigerians travelling for the event were offered unmatched data roaming packs from the telco company.\nThe company had emphasised the campaign message that the data roaming packs would ensure that visiting Glo subscribers could capture incredible photo and video moments of the global sporting competition and also share such great moments with friends and loved ones back home in Nigeria.\nGlobacom’s adventure into the Nigerian GSM telephony market is the best and most revolutionary epoch in the annals of the GSM mobile business in Nigeria.\nThe brand, which came then with a bang in a market already dominated by two leading brands, launched with an offensive strategy that almost caught already established operators gasping for breath with ambitious and popular per-second billing.\nIt was the most revolutionary offer in the market which instantaneously paved the way for the brand Glo in the market.\nThis brand initiative was launched with the thematic campaign: ‘Magic Ball’. Since the launch, the brand’s advertising theme campaigns have been reviewed and adjusted over the years.\nSome of the strong creative platforms the Glo brand has been positioned since its launch in the marketplace are: ‘On your marks’; ‘Turning dreams into reality’ (Documentary); ‘Glowing continent’; ‘We live where you live’; ‘Rule your world’; ‘We’ve got people talking’; ‘Glo CAF’; ‘Football made in Africa’; ‘Marathon’; ‘The more campaigns’; ‘More technology’; ‘More people’; ‘More friends’; ‘More millions’ and ‘More youth’.\nThe brand is obviously the most unique GSM brand that has experimented with a plethora of advertising agencies and has equally savoured the creative edges of these agencies than others.\nQuite a good number of advertising agencies have had a bite of Glo’s juicy jumbo advertising account. Some of these agencies are Insight Grey, Bates Cosse, LTC, Verdant Zeal, and currently X3M Ideas.\nAFCON’s DSTV Campaign\nBeyond the frills and thrills of the 2024 edition of the biennial continental soccer fiesta, Africa Cup of Nations, the fallout from some exciting campaigns pushed out by various brands to support their preferred teams will remain evergreen. In the build-up to the continental soccer fiesta, which took place between January 13 to February 11, 2024, in Ivory Coast, digital satellite television service provider, DStv dropped a bombshell when it informed its teeming subscribers that it won’t be doing live transmission of matches of the tournament. The reason given by the broadcast giant was that it was not able to secure broadcasting rights for the soccer showpiece.\nIt was one announcement that Nigerians did not take kindly to, especially going by the pricey nature of its packages and subscriptions.\nHowever, DStv was to do a U-turn and announce that it had secured rights. It was a major relief to its subscribers, especially soccer lovers who go beyond live matches and pay attention to pre- and post-match analysis which SuperSport has come to be known for. Even with the little time the sports broadcaster had to prepare, it was still able to provide memorable coverage of the biennial soccer fiesta.\nOne area the brand was able to resonate with its customers and share in the emotions during the tournament was the series of campaign copies that were churned out during the tournament. Perhaps, seeing how passionate Nigerians were in their support for the Super Eagles, DStv also decided to identify with this passion and share in the emotions that were at their highest during the competition. The essence of this is that when a brand connects with the consumer’s passion and also speaks their language, it’s the beginning of a beautiful romance.\nFor instance, after the Super Eagles defeated the Bafana Bafana of South Africa, there was a copy showing a big-bellied Eagle with a plate of recently devoured food on its left foot. On the plate was the flag of South Africa. What this copy denoted was that the Super Eagles had just had the Bafana Bafana for a meal. Before the match itself, there was another copy with the caption: BOYS NEED THEIR DAD. Illustrating the copy was a photo of an eagle, holding a book with a Bafana Bafana inside a cot with a pacifier in his mouth.\nAhead of the final showdown between the Super Eagles and the Elephants of Cote d’Ivoire, there was another copy with the caption: CHOP BELLEFUL. ENTER GYM. CHOP! Meaning: the Super Eagles had just had the Bafana Bafana of South Africa for dinner and had entered the gym to shape up ahead of another meal waiting for them. There was also another copy with the caption: AN ELEPHANT NEVER FORGETS. This apparently referred to the defeat the Elephants of Cote d’Ivoire suffered in the hands of the Super Eagles on January 18th during the group stage match between the two countries, where Nigeria prevailed thanks to a second-half penalty by the Super Eagles skipper, Troost Ekong.\nMTN’s ‘See Naija’ Campaign\nAs a market leader, MTN has consistently sustained the tempo in network expansion, technology, and corporate social responsibility drive.\nTo further promote its belief in Nigeria and identify with its patrons, the telco giant in 2024 created a platform where Nigerians can upload two-minute videos of fascinating sites about Nigeria’s rich cultural heritage. According to the company’s promoters, the initiative became necessary to tell the Nigerian story in a positive light and showcase the country to the rest of the world to attract tourists in a manner that will boost the economy\nMTN’s success story is due largely to the vision, mission, and commitment of its operators in establishing a market leadership position for itself.\nWhen MTN launched into the market, its PR account was handled by Corporate and Financial, while the advertising brief was handled by TBWA/Concept Unit. The two agencies launched the brand aggressively into the market with the pay-off line ‘Best Connection’.\nIn April 2005, it launched ‘Everywhere you go’ to harmonise and create a universal brand promise in all MTN operations across the continent.\nStill yearning for top of the mind presence, the brand went into its creative kitty to launch the ‘Go’ campaign with a view to positioning the Telco as a company that encourages men and women to go and conquer the world, knowing that man desires to live a better life, desire a secured future, progress and change.\n‘Everywhere You Go’ was said to have been anchored on MTN’s core values of leadership, integrity, and can-do spirit. However, due to the company’s leadership on coverage and market share, in the Nigerian market, consumers’ interpretation of the pay-off was seen to have emanated more from a geographical rather than a brand philosophy perspective.\nThe brand has equally launched a highly creative advertising campaign with the theme ‘Mama na Boy!’\nMeanwhile, to pacify the gender activists, who criticized the usage of the word ‘boy’ in the campaign, ‘Mama na Girl’ was quickly coined. This subtly resolved the riddle but the brand also benefited immensely from the raging debates.\nNo sooner had the issue come to a head than MTN harmonised the brief, which was shared between TBWA and SO&U by consolidating it in one agency with the appointment of DDB, Lagos. The appointment of DDB, in 2006 is a landmark creative renewal of sorts for the brand that has been known for cutting-edge creative themes.\nIndrive’s pricing proposition\nIn 2024, Indrive, the global ride hailing company continues with its brand purpose of fighting injustice and ensuring fair pricing with the unique selling proposition of allowing the passenger to negotiate a fair price with the driver. With this approach, the company maintained its growth speed in the Nigerian market and expanded presence to many cities.\nTo support the market proposition, the company carried out a series of campaigns including the #indriveDreamRide campaign in which passengers were picked up in a branded Roll Royce.The ride hailing platform also launched its freight offering business while also carrying out a series of customer-centric activities and initiatives.\nDuring the course of the year, Indrive announced a major milestone of investing N5 Billion in driver’s welfare. The brand also enhanced users’ experience by introducing App call and Phone masking.\nIndigo PR wins NBC, Lafarge accounts\nIn 2024, LSF PR lost the Public Relations brief of the Nigerian Bottling Company (NBC) to Indigo PR, one of the most successful agencies in Nigeria. The agency also participated and won the pitch called by Lafarge Africa Plc.\nWith the two briefs and others within its portfolio, Indigo thus consolidated its position as a leading PR Agency in Nigeria as the company continues attracting major businesses.\nAs at the last account, the agency manages over 15 accounts, which include; Nigerian Breweries Plc, Unilever, Lekki Port, Lagos Free Zone, FIRST E&P, Indrive and Mastercard Foundation. Others are; Lekki Gardens, Huawei, Swipha Montego Energy, NECA, Mamador and Lagoon School.\nHERO: The sun rises for you\nIn the year under review, AB InBev, makers of Hero lager beer inspired the consumers of the brand, through its 2024 ‘Hero Apprentice to Business Owner’ campaign, designed to address unemployment by empowering youth to establish their businesses.\nThe theme of this year’s campaign, ‘The Sun Rises For You,’ reflects the brand’s dedication to inspiring Nigerians to diligently pursue their goals while celebrating each achievement along the apprenticeship journey, from enrollment to the establishment of a thriving business.\nThe campaign, now in its third year, was produced by a Lagos creative agency, 7even Interactive and aligned with Hero Lager’s commitment to fostering economic growth through entrepreneurship throughout, according to a statement. The campaign was said to have been conceptualised because of the brand’s recognition that its success is intertwined with the prosperity of the communities, and thus, dedicated to supporting the apprenticeship system as part of the management’s contribution to reducing unemployment and enhancing the communities in which they operate.\nCAVISTA’S UNDYING SPIRIT\nDriven by the belief that business should be a force for good, Cavista Holdings appears not deterred by the current economic challenges as it consistently unites capital, expertise and partnerships to unlock opportunities in Nigeria and some other African countries .\nWhile the news of a few companies’ exit from Nigeria, has given stakeholders concern, the effort of Cavista Holdings to turn businesses around in Nigeria and Botswana as pilot countries to fulfil its mission to be the most successful investment and holding company in Africa, has remained like a light at the end of the tunnel.\nWith the support of its global partner, Axxess, a leading innovator in home healthcare technology around the world, Cavista’s presence in Nigeria has led to various strategic investments in agriculture, energy, hospitality, mining, and technology. The expansion of the Agbeyewa Cassava farms owned by the group remains one of the most impactful investments by any company in 2024.\nORIGIN TECH ON FOOD SECURITY\nAt the last quarter of 2024, Origin Tech Group and the Lagos Government entered into partnership\nto deliver Africa’s Largest Food Security Hub in Epe, Lagos State.\nObservers, including Governor Sanwo-Olu, who applauded the move, believed that it will boost food security in 2025 and beyond.\nThis transformative project, championed by Origin Tech Group, is set to become the largest food logistics hub in Africa and the second largest globally, after the iconic Rungis International Market in France.\nThe groundbreaking 220-hectare facility, initiated less than two years ago, promises to revolutionise Lagos’ food ecosystem by improving accessibility, stabilising market prices, and reducing post-harvest losses.\nUpon completion, Lagosians can anticipate a 50% reduction in food prices due to integrated facilities like cold and dry storage, Africa’s largest abattoir, and a jetty for streamlined goods transportation.\nThe facility will feature: A 14,000-capacity abattoir on 1,000 hectares of land, size of 11 football fields of dry storage for agricultural produce, A 250mm dual carriageway concrete road network for efficient logistics and a jetty to facilitate waterway transportation across Lagos.\nThis audacious project is poised to strengthen Lagos’ agricultural value chain, create thousands of jobs, and position the state as a leader in sustainable food systems in Sub-Saharan Africa.",
