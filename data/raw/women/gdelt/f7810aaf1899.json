Hackney-born dad-of-two Sir Idris, 53, known for roles in The Wire and Luther, is knighted for services to young people, after founding the Elba Hope Foundation supporting community empowerment, education, youth advocacy and sustainable development.\nHe said: \"I receive this honour on behalf of the many young people whose talent, ambition and resilience has driven the work of the Elba Hope Foundation. \"I hope we can do more to draw attention to the importance of sustained, practical support for young people and to the responsibility we all share to help them find an alternative to violence.\"\nMeanwhile, actor Warwick Davis, and presenter and author Richard Osman, both 55, have been made OBEs.\nOsman, who writes The Thursday Murder Club book series, said he was \"absolutely thrilled\" with the honour, while Davis joked: \"This is the best thing that's ever happened to me and I've been in Star Wars.\"\nFormer British, European, Olympic, and World champion ice dancers Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean also lead the New Year Honours list.\nDame Jayne and Sir Christopher were made a Dame and Sir for services to ice skating and to voluntary service 41 years after breaking Russia’s domination of ice skate dancing, mesmerising the world with their interpretation of Ravel's Bolero at the 1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo.\nTorvill, 68, and Dean, 67, were appointed MBEs in 1981 and OBEs in 2000, and their legion of fans have campaigned for years to get the gongs upgraded.\nThe pair, who later became the faces of the celebrity competition show Dancing On Ice, said the honour is \"wonderful and humbling at the same time\" and comes in the year they hung up their ice skates after 50 years of skating together.\nSir Christopher, 67, said: \"It's been mentioned by fans and supporters, but it's something that we never realised might happen.\n\"If it did, that would be wonderful, but if it didn't, there's so many other people in the country that are deserving as well.\"\nDame Jayne, 68, said the timing of the honours seemed \"perfect\" after the pair danced on the ice for the last time this year.\nShe said: \"We had such a great time, we were so happy with the tour and the fact that we got through it.\n\"It was a big thing for us to mark our career before retirement, and then receiving this award at the end of the year, it's just finished everything. It's perfect.\"\nThree-time London Marathon winner Paula Radcliffe, 52, who held the women's marathon world record for 16 years, is made an OBE, while England's victorious women's football and rugby teams are also recognised.\nThe Lionesses feature heavily on the list after their stunning Euros win in the summer - with captain Leah Williamson, 28, made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).\nAlex Greenwood, 32, Keira Walsh, 28, Georgia Stanway, and Ella Toone, both 26, were all part of the side that beat Spain in the final in Basel, Switzerland, in July, and become MBEs.\nAnd the team's Dutch manager Sarina Wiegman, 56, who has won the Euros twice with England, and once with the Netherlands, is awarded an honorary damehood.\nMembers of England Women's Rugby World Cup winning squad are also strongly represented, with Marlie Packer, 36, and Zoe Aldcroft, 29, becoming OBEs, along with coach John Mitchell, 61.\nHe said: \"I am incredibly honoured to receive this recognition, but I want to be clear that it reflects the work of the Red Roses World Cup-winning squad and the outstanding staff around them.\"\nAldcroft said: \"The recognition isn't mine alone. This year I have felt nothing but love and support from so many people and I am extremely grateful.\n\"My family's belief in me on this journey has been unrivalled, and I am also fortunate to have been surrounded by an unbelievable group of players and staff who have given everything to the Red Roses.\"\nTeammates Ellie Kildunne, 26, Sadia Kabeya, 23, and Megan Jones, 29, are made MBEs after the Red Roses defeated Canada in the final in September.\nThe sporting heroes join other stars who rose to fame in notable partnerships, such as Rotherham-born Paul Elliott, 78, one half of the Chuckle Brothers, who is made an MBE, and Matt Lucas, 51, half of the comedic Little Britain duo with David Walliams, who becomes an OBE.\nElsewhere, The Kumars At No 42 actress Meera Syal, 64, becomes a Dame while broadcaster Gabby Logan, 52.\nWicked star Cynthia Erivo, 38, is made an MBE for services to music and drama, while football commentator Clive Tyldesley, 71, who led the ITV team at five World Cups and five European Championships and was lead commentator at 17 UEFA Champions League and nine FA Cup finals, becomes an OBE for services to sports broadcasting and to charity.\nEnglish comedy writer Roy Clarke, 95, creator of sitcoms Last Of The Summer Wine, Open All Hours and Keeping Up Appearances, becomes a knight.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"This year's Honours list celebrates the very best of Britain - people who put the common good ahead of themselves to strengthen communities and change lives.\n\"Their quiet dedication speaks to the decent, compassionate country we are proud to be. On behalf of the whole nation, thank you - and congratulations to everyone recognised.\"\nThis year's honours list includes 50% (1,157) of recipients at CBE level and above, marking the strongest representation since 2020, the Cabinet Office said.\nAcross the list, 10% come from ethnic minority backgrounds - including 5% Asian, 3% Black, 2% mixed and 1% other.\nIn addition, 5% identify as LGBTQ+, 15% report a disability or long-term health condition and 36% come from lower socio-economic backgrounds.",
