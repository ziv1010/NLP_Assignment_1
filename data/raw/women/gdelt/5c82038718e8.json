She drove us there, I believe, and what a brilliant night it was.\n'We didn't get caught red-handed the next day (everyone knows about it now, but who cares anyway?!). We journeyed together as a team to Bulgaria for the Deaflympics in 2013, Bulgaria for the Euros in 2014, Thailand for the Worlds in 2015, and Italy for the Worlds in 2016. Our early 20s were filled with unforgettable parties and adventures.'\nShe continued: 'Gemma, it was a great privilege to have played beside you, one of the greatest players I've known, and to know you as a person. I had the honour of attending your beautiful wedding.\nGemma and Laura share a festive picture together back in 2016\n'Thank you for having my part in your life; it means a million to me. The memories of those moments will be cherished forever. I deeply regret not doing more for our friendship, but I take comfort in knowing that you are no longer suffering. May you rest in peace without pain.\n'I will always be here to support Laura in any way possible for you. Fly high, and I trust my brother will take care of you on my behalf. Love you, will miss you, and see you later.'\nWell-wishers were left distraught by Wiseman's death, leaving messages of support for her family on her GoFundMe page.\n'So sad to hear this. I didn't know Gemma but recognise her from the Deaf festival. I remember Gemma and Laura bringing Allie to the bear clinic to get some hearing aids for her bear,' a commenter said.\nAnother added: 'I'm so sorry to read this. We worked together back in 2014 for Break. Gemma had the sweetest kindest soul. We then saw each other on Sunday mornings as our little girls played football together. A happy, friendly face I would see now and again. So so sorry. Rest in peace lovely lady.'\nA third person said: 'Our thoughts are with you Laura and Allie. Gemma always had such a wonderful smile and bubbly personality when we bumped in to you around Blofield.'\nGemma and Laura were both champions of women's football, and eagerly supported young female players getting into the game. Gemma also championed mental health charities online.\nThe pair supported Norfolk FA's Inclusive Football Festival for Girls, with Laura saying: 'It's important for girls to have a role model so they can see that we can do it, and nothing is stopping us from playing the sport we love.'\nIn a statement to MailOnline after her death, Norfolk FA said: 'All at Norfolk County FA are deeply saddened to hear the news of Gemma Wiseman, who tragically died shortly before Christmas.
