  "body_text": "Shelbourne and St Patrick’s Athletic are through the second qualifying round of the European Cup and Conference League respectively. Shels advanced to the second phrase of the European Cup qualifying phrase by finishing the job against Linfield in Windsor Park last Wednesday. The celebrations were fuelled by the doors that the victory will open and the financial rewards that might accompany it. Shelbourne were guaranteed €960,000 from UEFA before they kicked a ball in Europe this year. Losing every match wouldn’t have changed that. But progressing past Linfield 2-1 on aggregate has guaranteed the Reds an extra €750,000, meaning that the minimum lodgment they will receive now is €1.71m. Shels officials point out that costs significantly reduce the bottom line, but a road trip to Belfast was not as expensive as flying to a play a club in Eastern Europe.\nManager Joey O’Brien said they want to qualify for the group stages, which I think is unlikely. He said: ‘‘People in the background handle the financial side and stuff like that. But I said to the boys in the dressing room European football, you can’t beat it. When you are finished as a player, these are the nights you remember. But we cannot just be happy with this, we are looking to get to the group stages. That’s the name of the game.’’ The Reds will now face a difficult task in the next round starting with a home time at Tolka Park Wednesday night against Qarabag from Azerbaijan.\nO’Brien has strengthened his squad with the signing of former Irish youth and under 21 international Jack Henry-Francis. The 21 year-old Croydon-born midfielder, qualifies for Ireland through his Connacht-born parents.\nSt Patrick’s Athletic did have to travel to Eastern Europe where they had a comfortable 2-0 win over Hegelmann in Lithuania to progress to the second round of the Conference league where they will play Estonia club Kalju. The first leg will be played in Inchicore Thursday night. Mason Melia’s impending departure from St Pat’s has already earned the club close to €2m but the Spurs-bound striker is the gift that keeps on giving. Melia’s starring performances in Europe last term were a big factor in the EPL club agreeing to pay a record fee. And the 17-year-old picked scored one and made the second goal for Cian Leavy as the Saints won 2-0 last week, a win that earns another €375,000 for his current employers.\nMeanwhile Shamrock Rovers, who got a bye in the first round of the Conference League, will play Gibraltarian club St Joseph's in the Conference League after Cliftonville fell short in their bid to set up a second all-Irish clash in Europe this year. The Reds were level at 2-2 going into the second leg at Solitude last Thursday, but fell to a 3-2 defeat after extra-time to lose 5-4 on aggregate. The Hoops are in action in Gibraltar in the first leg Thursday night.\nWARM WELCOME\nFOR FERGUSON\nIrish international Evan Ferguson travelled to Italy on Sunday to undergo a medical and complete the formalities of his loan move from Brighton to Roma after the two clubs finally came to an agreement. Ferguson was welcomed to Ciampino Airport by hundreds of Roma supporters. Roma finished fifth in the league last season under Claudio Ranieri, who was subsequently replaced by former Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini on a three-year contract. The loan has been in train for a fortnight now after Roma fended off competition from domestic rivals like Atalanta to sign the Meath native on a season-long loan deal, but there was a holdup as the Serie A club were not willing to meet Brighton’s valuation of €45m in terms of the buyout clause is the loan was a success and they wanted to make it a permanent deal.\nEVERTON SIGN\nGOALIE TRAVERS\nIrish goalkeeper Mark Travers completed his move from Bournemouth to Everton last week and has agreed a four-year deal with the Toffees. Everton manager David Moyes is reported to be a big fan of the Irish third choice keeper and the Kildare-born keeper joined Moyes on Merseyside for a fee believed to be in the region of £4million.Travers said: ‘‘I am extremely proud and excited to be an Everton player. Coming in, you can feel how big this club is and the history that comes with it. You really feel that with the fanbase, the new stadium now as well and the direction the club is going in. It’s a fresh start for me to come up here and try a new chapter in my career.’’\nTravers, who made 82 appearances for the Cherries during his nine years with the club, which also included loan spells with Swindon, Stoke and Middlesbrough, will provide competition for England number one Jordan Pickford, and he is relishing that prospect. On Saturday Travers made his debut for Everton in pre-season friendly against Blackburn Rovers, who won 1-0.\n£1M TRANSFER\nBREAKS RECORD\nEuropean champions Arsenal shattered the women's transfer record by signing Canadian forward Olivia Smith from Liverpool on Thursday, for a fee of £1million making the 20-year-old the first female player to break the seven-figure barrier. Arsenal’s move eclipses the previous record set by American defender Naomi Girma’s £900,000 transfer from San Diego Wave to Chelsea in January, although the 25-year-old had already broken the one million dollar mark.\nUSA and Chelsea's Naomi Girma. [Inpho/Ryan Byrne]\nUNITED’S MBEUMO\nDEAL NEARLY DONE\nManchester United have reached an agreement with Brentford to sign Bryan Mbeumo in a deal worth up to £71 million, making the forward their third summer signing. The 25-year-old Cameroon international had been on United’s radar for weeks, and the move is nearly done. Mbeumo has agreed personal terms, having made it clear he only wanted to join United despite interest from other clubs including Tottenham, Arsenal and Newcastle. United had two earlier bids turned down, but Brentford finally accepted an offer of £65 million plus £6 million in bonuses. Mbeumo, who joined Brentford in 2019 from French club Troyes, had a strong season in 2024–25. He played in all 38 league games, scored 20 goals, and added 8 assists as Brentford finished 10th. It’s another big-money move by United as they look to sharpen their attack under manager Ruben Amorim. New Bees manager Keith Andrews moved for Henderson after losing Danish midfielder Christian Norgaard to Arsenal. Andrews said: ‘‘When we became aware of Jordan's availability, it was a pretty simple decision.’’\nGOALIE BERGER\nIS GERMAN HERO\nIn the Women’s Euro 2025 tournament being played in Switzerland German goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger was her country’s hero on Saturday night as she saved two and converted one penalty in the quarter-final shoot-out win over France in Basel. After playing with only 10 players from the 13th minute against France when Kathrin Hendrich was sent off for pulling Griedge Mbock by her hair in the penalty area the Germans held out for a 1-1 draw and extra time failed to separate the teams. Before her penalty heroics, Berger saved Germany several times including a diving one-handed save to deny a backwards header from one of her own players. Aged 34 years 269 days, she became Germany’s oldest player to appear at the Euros when making her competition debut in their opening game against Poland. Overall the standard of penalty-taking in the shoot-outs has been poor, but we did see the English women show their male colleagues how to win a penalty shoot-out when they knocked out Sweden. Germany will now play Spain in second semi-final Wednesday night, while England will play Italy at today at 3 p.m. Eastern in the first semi-final. The final will be played in Basel on Sunday next.\nNO CUP SHOCKS\nThere were plenty of goals, but no shocks in the second round games of the FAI Cup, which were played last weekend. The biggest winners were St Patrick’s Athletic who beat Munster Senior League club UCC 8-0 at Richmond Park on Sunday evening. Bohemians hit junior club Killlester/Donnycarney for seven with Colm Whelan getting a hat-trick. The north Dublin club gave up home advantage to play the Gypsies at Dalymount Park. Liam Boyce also got a hat-trick for Derry City as they won 5-1 away to first division Treaty United in Limerick.\nFAI Cup 2nd round results: Bangor Celtic 0, Cobh Ramblers 2; Bray Wanderers 3, Wayside Celtic 0; Bohemians 7, Killester/Donnycarney Utd 0; Castlebar Celtic 3, Longford Town 6; Cork City 3, Leicester Celtic 0; Dundalk 0, Sligo Rovers 2; Fairview Rangers 0, Shelbourne 4; Finn Harps 3, UCD 0; Galway Utd. 2, Tolka Rovers 0; Kerry FC 2, Athlone Town 1; St Patrick’s Ath 8, UCC 0; Salthill Devon 1, St Michael’s 0; Shamrock Rov 4, Wexford 0; Treaty Utd 1, Derry City 5.",
