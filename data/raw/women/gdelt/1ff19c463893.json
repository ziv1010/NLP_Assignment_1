That same year, the league introduced its NFL Flag football program locally, followed by the official launch of the NFL Academy Asia-Pacific in 2024.\nAs part of its efforts to grow the game and deepen fan engagement across Australia and New Zealand, the NFL Australia office has implemented a range of fan events across the market, giving local fans the opportunity to connect with sport at a deeper level.\nMost recently, the NFL announced its first-ever regular-season game in Australia, set to take place in Melbourne in 2026, with the Los Angeles Rams designated as the home team.\nRugby Australia x AG1\nRugby Australia has welcomed AG1 as the official and exclusive functional nutrition partner of both the Wallabies and Wallaroos for the next three years.\nAs part of the agreement, the AG1 logo will feature on the Wallaroos shorts until at least the end of 2027 and adds to a growing list of brands choosing to align with Australian women’s rugby.The AG1 logo will also appear on the balls for Wallabies home tests this year, before featuring on the balls of both teams in 2026 and 2027.\nAG1 was founded more than a decade ago with a mission to bring comprehensive and convenient daily nutrition to the market, empowering people to take ownership of their health.\n“The partnership with AG1 comes at a great time with Australians rallying behind the Wallaroos at the Rugby World Cup and the Wallabies during the Flight Centre Rugby Championship,” said Rugby Australia CEO, Phil Waugh.\n“The Wallaroos campaign in the UK promises to be a highly competitive tournament before a home Rugby World Cup in 2029, which represents a generational opportunity for the game.\n“Meanwhile the Wallabies are continuing to build and develop during their Rugby Championship campaign after what was a momentous series against The British & Irish Lions on home soil, which brought a lot of pride to Rugby supporters around the country.\n“Like the Wallaroos and Wallabies, AG1 is focused on promoting high standards of health and wellbeing, as well as being industry leaders in their fields.

Together, we’re showing what’s possible when you challenge boundaries and open new paths for the next generation.”\nFrom winning Australian Karting Championship Pink Plate to becoming the youngest driver on the 2025 F1 Academy grid after a single-seater debut season in Europe, Joanne’s journey to become one of the 18 fastest women on the planet is unlike any other in motorsports. Her bold embrace of the new single-seater technology and data-driven learning has been a key accelerator for Joanne’s growth—delivering her first points at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit in Saudi Arabia in April.\nCo-founder and CEO of Fleet Space, Flavia Tata Nardini, uniquely relates to Joanne’s meteoric rise in the F1 world.\nAn Italian aerospace engineer who worked on propulsion systems at the European Space Agency, Flavia founded Fleet Space and led the development of Australia’s first constellation of low Earth orbit satellites. Beginning as a dream born while building satellites in the garage with co-founder and chief exploration officer, Matt Pearson, Fleet Space has grown to Australia’s most valuable space exploration company.\nFuelling this growth are the same principles and systems engineers use in F1, aerospace, technology, and more to unlock new frontiers of performance: continuous learning loops with real-time data. These systems have driven world-changing breakthroughs in reusable rockets, self-driving vehicles, and F1’s ascension to the pinnacle of motorsports.\nUsing space technology and agile geoscience solutions, Fleet Space built the world’s first system for global mining and resources companies to fuel faster, smarter, and cleaner mineral discovery with real-time data—making the cutting-edge methods of data-driven performance in F1 and aerospace practical in essential industries for Earth’s clean energy future.\n“Joanne’s journey and F1’s rise as a data-driven sport mirrors the spirit that fuels us at Fleet Space—a fearless commitment to speed, precision, and learning as we unlock new frontiers of exploration on Earth, the Moon, and Mars,” said Tata Nardini.\n“Breaking boundaries requires the same boldness to embrace risk, master cutting-edge technology, and create possibilities for others that didn’t exist before. As Fleet Space approaches its 10 year anniversary, we believe there is no limit to where curiosity, courage, and relentless drive can take the next generation—whether that’s the racetrack, low Earth orbit, or kilometres below our feet. Supporting world-class talent like Joanne as she rises to the pinnacle of her field is at the core of who we are: explorers.”\n“The support from Fleet Space will open new doors for opportunity, access to additional physical and mental development along with more seat time—which is pivotal for any driver who wants to excel in racing,” concluded the aspiring F1 driver.\nStarting in 2026, Joanne will debut a custom-made Fleet Space helmet with the company’s branding on the race suit, and gloves.\nBrisbane Roar x Elite Supplements\nBrisbane Roar has renewed its partnership with Australian sports and health supplements store, Elite Supplements, for a further two seasons.\nElite Supplements will continue to support the Isuzu UTE A-League Men, Ninja A-League Women and NPL teams with supplements for the upcoming 25/26 season and beyond.Elite Supplements will also remain the sleeve-of-jersey partner on our Ninja A-League Women’s match day playing kits this season.\n“We’re excited to continue our partnership with Elite Supplements to provide both our A-League Men’s and Women’s squads with quality supplements to ensure they perform at their best,” said Brisbane Roar chairman and CEO Kaz Patafta.\n“I would like to show my gratitude to Domenic Giampaolo for supporting our club and particularly women’s sport as they continue to feature on the sleeve of our A-League Women’s kits.”\nView this post on Instagram\n“We are proud to partner with Brisbane Roar, a club with such a strong history and passionate fanbase. At Elite Supplements, our mission is to Unlock a Better You, whether on the sporting field or in everyday life,” said Giampaolo, CEO of Elite Supplements.\n“This partnership is a natural fit, and we’re excited to support the Roar as they continue to inspire the next generation of women’s athletes and fans across Queensland,”",
