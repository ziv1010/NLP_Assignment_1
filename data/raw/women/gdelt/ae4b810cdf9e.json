  "body_text": "Welcome to Full Time, The Athletic’s women’s football column — a one-stop shop every Monday to discuss the big issues in the game in the UK and Europe.\nThe main story\nAs Tottenham Hotspur striker Martha Thomas bore down on the Aston Villa goal in the 72nd minute, the significance of what she was about to do might not have necessarily occurred to her.\nAdvertisement\nWhen she curled in her third goal of the match, Thomas was not only completing a hat-trick to put Spurs 4-1 up, but she was also surpassing her Women’s Super League best for goals scored in a season. She now has six goals in four games this campaign — beating her previous record of five, with Manchester United in 2021-22 — and is top of the WSL goalscoring charts ahead of Brighton & Hove Albion’s Elisabeth Terland (four) and Manchester City’s Jill Roord, Katie McCabe of Arsenal and former United team-mate Rachel Williams (all three).\nThe 27-year-old Scotland international joined Spurs from Manchester United at the end of the transfer window. With England international Bethany England set to be out for some time as she recovers from a hip operation, eyebrows were raised when Polish forward Nikola Karczewska went on loan to Bayern Leverkusen and was replaced by the incoming Thomas. She had played just 408 WSL minutes last season for United, mostly from out wide.\nHowever, Thomas has been essential to Spurs’ bright start, scoring in each of their four league matches and helping them reach 50 per cent of their points total from last season already. The 4-2 win over Villa was their first over a top-half WSL team since they beat Manchester City on September 12, 2021.\nWhen asked about her brilliant run of form, Thomas praised her Spurs coach, Robert Vilahamn. “It’s probably playing under someone that I know believes in me,” she said. “That’s important, that’s when I play my best football. Playing in my actual position.”\n“If you give a good player the trust and self-confidence, you can see what she’s really made of,” Vilahamn said after the game. “Those national-team players on the bench at the biggest clubs, sometimes you can find that in them if you give them the trust.”\nSpurs recruited judiciously over the summer, with under-the-radar signings such as Finnish midfielder Olga Ahtinen and Swiss centre-back Luana Buhler excelling. Grace Clinton, the 20-year-old midfielder on loan from Manchester United, was rewarded for her form with a first senior England call-up last week. Vilahamn’s side look well-organised, with wins against Villa, Brighton and Bristol City building on a positive opening-day display against Chelsea, even in defeat.\nAs the battle to reach the top of the WSL increases and more clubs look to plough investment into their women’s teams, Spurs’ early season impression should be a lesson. Star names can provide an instant uplift on and off the pitch (Tottenham know that better than anyone — signing England in January was crucial in keeping Spurs away from the relegation zone) but sometimes you don’t have to splash the cash to build something good. And right now, England herself might be wondering where she stands when she returns to full fitness.\nAdvertisement\nWhat you might have missed\nNormally you expect to see WSL players streaming off a coach or arriving in their cars before a match, but not so for Chelsea midfielder Sjoeke Nusken. The 22-year-old Germany international arrived by bike at Kingsmeadow before her second start for the club, and her performance impressed just as much as her environmental credentials.\nSjoeke Nusken really turned up to Kingsmeadow on a bike and bagged a perfect hat-trick against Brighton. 🤣🚲 pic.twitter.com/xyGRYR9tjd\n— London Is Blue Podcast ⭐️⭐️ (@LondonBluePod) October 22, 2023\nHaving gone a goal down to Brighton, Nusken equalised for Chelsea on the stroke of half-time. She scored again just after the break before laying on an assist for Agnes Beever-Jones, paving the way for Chelsea’s 4-2 win. All of that came as a surprise to a player many assumed the WSL champions had signed to be a defensive midfielder.\n“I play every position in the midfield,” Nusken said after the match, “so sometimes in the ’10’ or in the pivot.”\nManager Emma Hayes concurred: “She wants and likes to go forward, somewhere between the No 8 and the No 10. But she’s front-footed, really aggressive and she’ll get in the box.”\nThe only sour note was that Nusken was denied a perfect hat-trick — her scrambled effort in the 74th minute went down as an own goal for Guro Bergsvand. “I touched the ball,” Nusken insisted, and cycled defiantly back home with her match ball in tow.\nPlayer of the week\nLeicester City vs Manchester City was the unusual table-topping clash and the away side were forced to work hard for their 1-0 win, ending the host’s unbeaten start to the season. Leicester stayed in the game thanks to the tireless work of defender Sophie Howard, and were probably unlucky not to score themselves. Playing in the middle of a back three, Howard was given the unenviable task of marking Bunny Shaw — City’s top scorer from last season (31 across all competitions).\nHoward was dragged out of position in the first half but rallied in the second to frustrate Shaw. Her efforts were ultimately in vain but the Scotland international’s dogged defending was an example of how well-organised manager Willie Kirk has made this side.\nAdvertisement\nMoment of the week\nArsenal striker Vivianne Miedema finally made her return to WSL action this weekend, 11 months after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament rupture in a Champions League game against Lyon. The Netherlands international, who was selected last week for their Nations League fixtures against Scotland on Friday and next Tuesday, was a late substitute in her side’s win against Bristol City.\nGO DEEPER\nThe real and emotional impact of ACL injuries on female elite players\nWith striker Beth Mead returning to play last week, manager Jonas Eidevall’s attacking options are now complete. “It’s such a joyful moment,” said Eidevall post-match. “I am very happy for players that have been out for a long time, working so hard and now being able to come back to us on the pitch.\n“To have them both back within a week of each other is so special for the team,” said Republic of Ireland captain Katie McCabe.\nOut of the remaining ACL injuries list, only defenders are left — England captain Leah Williamson and Austria international Laura Wienroither.\nWhat’s happening next?\nThe domestic club season will be paused as the international game takes over, with Nations League fixtures and Olympic qualification the focus for many. England face Belgium in home and away matches on Friday and next Tuesday.\nThe Ballon d’Or winner will be announced on October 30. Spain’s Alexia Putellas will almost certainly be relinquishing her hold on the trophy after winning the last two years in a row. Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmati, who won the World Cup with Spain, is the favourite to win this year’s edition.\nThe WSL action starts again on November 4. The following day, Arsenal and Manchester City go head to head for the first time this season.\n(Top photo: Alex Burstow/Arsenal FC via Getty Images)",
