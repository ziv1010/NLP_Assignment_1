  "body_text": "This LSU Women’s Basketball Transfer Sent Miami to the CFP Championship\nReady for the weirdest sports story you'll read today? We're talking about a true \"butterfly effect\" in the world of college sports. A decision made by an LSU Women's Basketball player to leave Baton Rouge would end up sending the Miami Hurricanes to the College Football Playoff Championship Game.\nIt sounds crazy, but the path is undeniably there...and it all starts with former LSU guard Hailey Van Lith. If she doesn't decide to bounce from Baton Rouge, we are looking at a completely different college football landscape right now.\nThe Van Lith Domino Effect\nLet's rewind to the offseason before the 2024-2025 basketball season, when the transfer portal was heating up...Van Lith was looking for a new home after her stint with Kim Mulkey at LSU. She decided to take her talents to TCU, a move that seemed focused purely on basketball at the time. She had one year of eligibility left, and decided on TCU for that final year.\nBut that single move created a massive ripple effect in the portal, specifically for the Cavinder twins. If you don't know the Cavinder twins, they're basically the basketball version of Livvy Dunne...college athletes with massive online followings. Basically athletes turned content creators. This story is directly tied to Hanna Cavinder, who had actually committed to TCU through the transfer portal, and was ready to leave the Miami Hurricanes to become a Horned Frog. But when Van Lith committed to the same backcourt, things got complicated.\nHow Love Fueled A Championship Run\nHanna Cavinder looked at that crowded TCU roster in Fort Worth, and decided to pivot. She decommitted from TCU, and announced she was heading back to Miami. Now...this is where the football connection comes in. Because Hanna was dating Georgia starting quarterback Carson Beck. So when Beck was exploring his own options in the transfer portal, and looking for a fresh start away from Athens, where his girlfriend decided to take her talents became the obvious landing spot for the talented QB.\nNow remember, when Beck was at Georgia, Hanna was showing up in custom jerseys, and cheering loudly for him. So this wasn't just an online relationship...they were serious. So Beck following her to Miami was something that made sense to a lot of people. Even though their relationship didn't survive the new, closer proximity relationship. They broke up soon after Beck arrived on campus.\nThe Hurricanes Historic Playoff Surge\nOnce Beck landed in Miami, the entire trajectory of the Hurricanes season shifted...he brought SEC pedigree, and big-game experience, to a roster that was starving for elite quarterback play. We watched all season as he dissected defenses and led this team on a magical run that has them playing for it all.\nHe even scored the touchdown to end a classic CFP Semifinal game against Ole Miss to send the Hurricanes to the title game.\nBut none of that magic happens if Hailey Van Lith stays at LSU. Because Hanna Cavinder likely sticks with TCU, and Carson Beck probably ends up wearing a different uniform this year. It is one of the wildest chains of events in sports we've ever seen...and it proves that the transfer portal era is more interconnected than we ever imagined.\nEvery LSU Player Taken in the NFL Draft Since 2020\nGallery Credit: Getty Images\nLSU Athletes Drafted #1 Overall Across All Sports Drafts",
