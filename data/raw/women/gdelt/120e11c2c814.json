  "body_text": "THE customer contact teams at all Heathrow-based airlines have been given a surprise Friday off to spend at their leisure.\nAnyone working in a customer-facing role, from staff at check-in desks to call centre representatives, received a surprise email just after 11pm last night informing them their presence would not be required tomorrow and thanking them for their hard work.\nEmma Bradford of Slough said: “Who says airlines don’t care about the little people?\n“What could have been a very long day – seriously, if you’ve never been stuck working at an airport, time drags – is instead dedicated to rest, relaxation and avoiding any stressful news.”\nA spokesman for Emma’s employer, a leading British airline that prefers not to be identified, said: “We acted to protect our employees because we care.\n“Anyway, as outlined on our website, any passengers who find their flights delayed or cancelled should contact the airline in the first instance. Accommodation, refreshments or alternative transport booked independently may not be reimbursed.\n“If you can’t get through, keep trying! Current queuing times are between 36 and 72 hours.”",
