  "body_text": "Saquon Barkley and the Eagles win big, Shane Gillis invents the Tush Push, and other highlights from a very Philly ESPYs\nJordan Mailata accepted awards on Barkley’s behalf, Eagles coach Nick Sirianni made the trip to Los Angeles, and host Shane Gillis gave plenty of “Go Birds” chants.\nThere was a lot for Philly fans to smile at during ESPN’s annual sports awards show — from a number of “Go Birds” chants and local winners to some familiar faces in the crowd and eve a Tush Push skit.\nHere are some of the highlights from the 2025 ESPYs …\nShane Gillis’ opening monologue\nThe 2025 ESPYs was hosted by Pennsylvania native Shane Gillis, who doesn’t shy away from showing off his Philly fandom. The comedian, actor, and podcaster’s opening monologue drew inspiration from comedian Norm Macdonald’s 1998 ESPYs monologue.\nIn an interview with The Athletic, Gillis mentioned that Macdonald was a big reason he wanted to host the ESPYs.\n“The reason I wanted to take it on was Norm Macdonald,” Gillis told The Athletic. “He’s the best ever, and he did it, and his monologue was one of my favorites.”\nThat inspiration was evident. Like Macdonald, he played off the crowd and roasted those in attendance — even when it got awkward — and made a few spicy jokes about President Donald Trump, Bill Belichick, and O.J. Simpson.\nAs a tribute to the late Macdonald, Gillis ended his monologue with the same joke Macdonald used 27 years ago on the former NFL safety Charles Woodson.\n“Travis Hunter won the Heisman Trophy this year,” Gillis said. “He’s the first defensive player since Charles Woodson to win the Heisman. Congratulations Travis Hunter. Winning the Heisman, that’s something they can never take away from you — unless you kill your wife and a waiter, in which case, they can take that away from you.”\n» READ MORE: Eagles training camp preview: Sizing up the depth chart on offense\nTush Push origins movie trailer\nAs a die-hard Philly sports fan, Gillis, 37, didn’t mind showing off his Eagles fandom. During his opening monologue, he briefly mentioned attending the Eagles Super Bowl win in New Orleans before hitting the crowd with a “Go Birds.”\nBut that was hardly the only mention of his favorite team. In fact, there was a whole segment dedicated to the Eagles’ signature Tush Push play. After a commercial break, Gillis introduced “an exclusive movie premiere” about the “untold story of a man who was instrumental in the Eagles Super Bowl victory.”\nIt should come as no surprise Gillis would dedicate the time to one of the most popular topics in the offseason. The future of the Tush Push was uncertain after the Green Bay Packers’ proposal to ban it. However, after a 22-10 vote, the proposal was rejected in May at the spring league meetings.\n“The weaker, softer teams are going to have to get together and vote against it like cowards,” Gillis said in the skit. “Could you imagine being a football team and going and complaining about a play working too well? That’s what’s going to happen. Pathetic, right?”\nAfter the movie preview, Gillis asked Eagles coach Nick Sirianni if he came up with the play.\n“Yeah, as a staff we did,” he responded. “It was kind of exactly how you showed it right there.”\n» READ MORE: C.J.

He would say that no man is an island and that he draws his strength from others. So, in saying that thank you to the ESPYs, thank you to the fans who voted for him and Go Birds.”\nBarkley also won the award for Best NFL Player, beating out Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, and Patrick Surtain II.\nBut the Birds weren’t done.\n» READ MORE: Jason and Travis Kelce relive their Lake Tahoe adventures and harmonize with Zac Brown on latest ‘New Heights’\nEagles win Best Team\nBefore the final award of the night, the Best Team award, Gillis discussed some of the nominees, including the Eagles. They were nominated alongside the Florida Panthers (NHL), Los Angeles Dodgers (MLB), New York Liberty (WNBA), Ohio State Buckeyes football team (NCAA), Oklahoma City Thunder (NBA), North Carolina women’s lacrosse’s (NCAA), the USWNT, and the University of Connecticut women’s basketball team (NCAA).\nAnd in the process, he managed to throw a jab at the Eagles’ division rival: the Dallas Cowboys.\n“The Eagles are up for best team, Go Birds,” Gillis said. “And I bet you guys think as an Eagles fan, I’m going to trash all the other nominees, but far from it. I’m going to celebrate them. I think this race is wide open. It definitely is not obvious who the best team was this year. One of the nominees for best team is the Dallas Cowboys. No, I’m joking. Obviously, Dallas sucks. Go Birds. They’re obviously not here.”\nGillis introduced each team nominated alongside the Eagles, taking slight digs and throwing in a few more Go Birds.\n“Only real teams are up for best team,” Gillis said. “Like Ohio State football who won the national championship. Also, lost to Michigan. Michigan who didn’t cheat this time … Also, UConn women. They could also win best team. UConn women, they played against pros, right? Who were on the verge of a Super Bowl dynasty? No, never mind that was the Eagles. Go Birds.\n“Or the Florida Panthers who won back-to-back like the Chiefs, who everyone thought was unstoppable until the Eagles absolutely destroyed them. Go Birds. And the New York Liberty. New York, they’re from a classy town in the Northeast where they invented America. Oh wait, that’s also Philadelphia. Go Birds.”\nIn the end, it was the Eagles taking home the hardware. To close out the show, Druski awarded the trophy to Sirianni, Mailata, Jalen Carter, and former Eagle Josh Sweat.\n“On behalf of the Philadelphia Eagles organization, thank you,” Sirianni said. “What an honor it is to be associated with all the great teams that were up for this award. Thank you to the fans who voted for us and thank you to the best fans in the world back home in Philly.”\nOther local winners\nPenn State women’s volleyball coach Katie Schumacher-Cawley was also honored as the recipient for the 2025 Jimmy V Award for Perseverance, for leading her team to a national championship while battling breast cancer. As she accepted her award she showed love to former Penn Stater Barkley.\n“Congratulations to all of tonight’s winners, especially my guy Saquon,” Schumacher-Cawley said. “Fly, Eagles Fly. A Penn Stater, right. Let’s go. I know I’m sitting next to some Ohio State guys but that’s all right, I got love for you.”\nLast year, former six-time WNBA All-Star, and Philadelphia native, Dawn Staley earned the honor.\n“Cancer changed my life but it didn’t take it,” Schumacher-Cawley said. “It didn’t take my belief, it didn’t take my spirit and it didn’t take my team … Keep showing up, keep believing and please never ever give up.”",
