However, Partey was only charged recently with the accusations, four days after departing from North London.\nAn Arsenal spokesperson disclosed that Partey's contract ended due to legal issues.\nAhead of his departure from Arsenal, Partey signed a contract with the Spanish football club Villarreal.\nVillarreal fans have voiced their disappointment on social media regarding the club's signing of Partey. Some even made a petition in disapproval of the contract, while others flooded the club's fan mailbox in protest.\nJaswant Narwal of the CPS revealed that the investigation took more than three years after the footballer was accused of rape back in February 2025. He added, \"The Crown Prosecution Service has today authorised the prosecution of Thomas Partey for multiple counts of rape – after carefully reviewing a comprehensive file of evidence.\"\nHe stated further that the defendant will have the right to \"a fair trial.\" Narwal urged anyone affected by the case to contact CPS for investigation purposes.",
