  "body_text": "Norfolk has gone football-mad for the Euros, but I for one haven’t been swept up in the frenzy.\nEngland flags are draped from windows, offices empty out as kick-off beckons - but I am struggling to feel any national pride.\nI have been to two football games in my life, the first at White Hart Lane and the second at Carrow Road.\nMy dad is a Spurs fan and he took me and my sister to separate games as teens - I remember it being quite overwhelming and my mum wasn’t impressed when I recited some of the chants.\nMy experience at the Norwich game around five years ago in my early 20s was much better.\nThough the delicious complimentary seabass dish I had beforehand in Delia’s Restaurant may have had something to do with it.\nI really don’t enjoy watching football on TV or live - give me a musical over Match of the Day any day.\nAs an aside, I wish people had the same passion for the arts as they do for ‘the beautiful game’, but that’s a problem to tackle another day.\nFootball fans of the England men’s team have a reputation across Europe for hooliganism - much the same as stag dos.\nREAD MORE: Police issue warning to fans after pub brawl during England Euros game\nWhile this is a sweeping generalisation, as the vast majority of fans are perfectly behaved, there is some truth in it.\nAt a Norwich pub, a man was knocked out during a fight at the England vs Denmark match.\nI have also seen on the news about fans throwing cups at manager Gareth Southgate.\nTo be honest I blame some of the players, whose conduct on and off the pitch is questionable.\nThey are paid millions of pounds and should set a better example to fans.\nAs well as this, my other main issue with men’s football is the disparity in pay vs the women’s team.\nWhile I don’t watch the matches, I feel a sense of pride that the Lionesses are packing out stadiums.\nThey are playing Ireland at Carrow Road next week and it sold out months in advance.\nAll available tickets for our #WEURO2025 qualifier against Republic of Ireland at @NorwichCityFC have now sold out!\n— Lionesses (@Lionesses) May 10, 2024\nThanks for your amazing support 👏 pic.twitter.com/51f4IvF0vw\nYet, despite their huge successes the pay gap is huge.\nCaptain Leah Williamson recently said in an interview that she doesn’t earn enough to retire and is studying to become an accountant as a back-up plan.\nDespite my issues with men’s football, there is one big plus to the Euros.\nREAD MORE: Dereham's Railway Tavern landlord on the impact of Euro 2024\nPubs are closing left, right and centre under the dark cloud of the cost of living crisis so it is great to see them packed out.\nThe Railway Tavern in Dereham has even erected a 200-seater stand outside - genius.\nWhether or not ‘it’s coming home’ I’m not fussed either way, but at least plenty of people will be raising a pint if so.",
