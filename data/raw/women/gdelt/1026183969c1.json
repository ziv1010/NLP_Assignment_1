  "body_text": "Paris 2024 Olympics: Women's matchday two predictions\n- Women's football at the Summer Olympics is well underway after engaging opening round\n- Some heavyweight nations clash in matchday two with the United States facing Germany\n- Current holders Canada have a tantalising encounter with Olympic hosts France\nAfter an exciting first round of fixtures in the women's football tournament at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, it's now time for matchday two.\nThere were no draws across the six opening games last Thursday - a day before the official opening ceremony in France - with no real surprises either as the likes of Canada, Spain, Germany, France and the United States all tasted victory.\nHowever, matchday two throws up some tantalising clashes between giants, with the USWNT facing Germany and hosts France taking on reigning champions Canada, who are mired in controversy.\nHere is how 90min thinks matchday two might play out this Sunday.\nBrazil vs Japan\nIn a tough group that contains three nations within the top ten of the FIFA rankings, Brazil got off to a perfect start against underdogs Nigeria. A 1-0 win courtesy of Gabi Nunes' effort should act as a springboard for meetings with Japan and Spain, with the former being Brazil's next opponents.\nJapan fought hard in their 2-1 defeat to 2023 World Cup winners Spain but were ultimately outclassed come the full-time whistle. Despite taking the lead through an exquisite free kick, Futoshi Ikeda's side couldn't keep hold of their advantage.\nBrazil and Japan have met as recently as April in the third-placed play-off in the 2024 SheBelieves Cup. The former came out on top on that occasion but only following a penalty shootout victory in which Japan missed all three of their spot kicks.\nPrediction: Brazil 1-0 Japan\nNew Zealand vs Colombia\nBoth New Zealand and Colombia tasted narrow defeats in their opening matches in Group A but it proved to be a particularly frustrating night for the South Americans. Losing 3-2 to hosts France having been three goals down at the break, Colombia also saw star striker Mayra Ramirez sent off for serious foul play in the final five minutes.\nShe will miss the clash against New Zealand but Colombia do have the excellent Linda Caicedo to still carry their hopes of victory.\nNot much was expected of New Zealand against current Olympic champions Canada but they caused the North American side plenty of issues. Taking an early lead after just 13 minutes, Evelyne Viens' strike broke hearts in the 79th minute as Canada completed the turnaround in a 2-1 win. They may suffer a similar result against Colombia this Sunday.\nPrediction: New Zealand 1-2 Colombia\nAustralia vs Zambia\nAustralia had been in positive form heading into their opener with Germany but were dismantled by the European giants with little fuss. A hefty 3-0 defeat puts the Matildas on the back foot in Group B as they still have to face the United States in their final match.\nTherefore, beating the tournament's lowest-ranked side Zambia is essential. The African outfit were hammered 3-0 by the United States on Thursday and will head into this clash with Australia as significant underdogs, even if the scoreline isn't as severe this time around.\nPrediction: Australia 1-0 Zambia\nSpain vs Nigeria\nWorld champions Spain were good value for their 2-1 win over Japan and should have a more comfortable time against Nigeria this weekend. The world's top FIFA-ranked side have a star-studded squad, exemplified by goals from Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati and new Arsenal forward Mariona Caldentey last time out.\nNigeria fought admirably against Brazil but have the potential to be torn apart against Spain. Their defence has been strong in recent matches but they will have to up their game to handle La Roja's range of attacking threats.\nPrediction: Spain 3-0 Nigeria\nFrance vs Canada\nFrance almost threw away a three-goal half-time lead against Colombia in their opening game but the tournament hosts held on for an important victory. One of the favourites for gold, they will fancy their chances when they face the current holders on Sunday.\nMarie-Antoinette Katoto bagged twice against Colombia last time out and will be aiming to extend her tally here, while the impressive Kadidiatou Diani is hoping to open her account.\nCanada have already made a controversial start to this year's Olympics. Two staff members - Joseph Lombardi and Jasmine Mander - have been dismissed after using a drone to spy on New Zealand's training sessions prior to their 2-1 win over the Ferns. The response from FIFA has shocked the world, with the Canadians docked six points, sending their tally to -3, and head coach Bev Priestman, as well as Lombardi and Mander, banned from all football related activity for one year.\nThat potentially changes the whole complexion of this contest. Where an even contest might have been expected, the huge blow could see Canada wilt and France take full advantage.\nPrediction: France 3-1 Canada\nUnited States vs Germany\nThe record four-time Olympic champions will be aiming to follow up their 3-0 win over Zambia with a statement victory over Germany. Emma Hayes' side put on a show in their opener as Trinity Rodman and Mallory Swanson both notched within the opening 25 minutes, the latter doing so twice.\nIt could have been an awful lot more for the USWNT in Nice, who were utterly rampant against the underdogs, but they will face a much sterner test this Sunday.\nGermany, who won gold in 2016, demolished Australia in their first outing and will put far more pressure on the United States backline in Marseille. Striker Lea Schuller was particularly eye-catching against the Matildas, while Wolfsburg stalwart Alexandra Popp is seeking her first goal at this year's Olympics.\nThis should be a thrilling affair.",
