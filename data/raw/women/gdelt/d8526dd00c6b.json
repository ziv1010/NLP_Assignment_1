  "body_text": "Chelsea vs. Arsenal just in time for the holidays. It's like an early present. We all know by now, the men's team is not going to be providing any holiday gifts any time soon.\nSure, its not tangible, but what transpires across the 90 minutes this upcoming Sunday has all the makings of a true treat. As of the time of writing, it is looking more and more of a possibility that this match is going to be a sellout. Imagine that. A few years ago, we could only dream of that. This Sunday not only could be a massive moment of English football, but also for the women's game as a whole.\nEach club has its eyes on painting London its own respective color. Jonas Eidevall's Gunners have picked up successive clean sheets in the Women's Super League while the west London side has combined for 10 goals over that span. I would recommend getting your mates together for this one. The winner will have a leg up on the other title contender as the campaign soon transitions into 2024.",
