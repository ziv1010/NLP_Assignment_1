I have just appealed and I am now waiting for a response.”\nThom, who signed for the Georgian side just a month after parting ways with TP Mazembe of the Democratic Republic of Congo, said she was confident she will now be successful.\nShe said: “The first application had some missing documents and information.\n“I am confident that this time around, everything will be fine.”\nThom is returning to Europe having played for Kvarnsmederns IK in Sweden from 2017 to 2019.\nThe 28-year-old, who was part of the Scorchers squad that faced Zambia Copper Queens in two international friendlies in March, said she was thrilled to return to Europe.\nThom joins other Scorchers players such as France-based duo of Tabitha Chawinga, who plays for Lyonnaise and Rose Kabzere of Montpellier as well Vanessa Chikupira and Bernadette Mkandawire who turn up for Biik-Kazygurt FC of Kazakhstan.\nShe joined Mazembe from KB Lioness less than a season after leaving Tanzania outfit Simba FC.\nWhile with TP Mazembe, Thom won several accolades, including CAF Women’s Champions League last year, alongside compatriot Chimwemwe Madise.",
