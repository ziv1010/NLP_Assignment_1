  "body_text": "Saudi Arabia’s bid to host the 2034 World Cup was considered a “medium risk” for human rights by FIFA in its evaluation report, which said implementing reforms could take “significant time and effort,” says AFP.\nThe release of the report on November 30 comes ahead of the FIFA Congress on December 11, when a vote will be held to select the hosts for the 2030 and 2034 World Cups.\nSaudi Arabia is the lone candidate for 2034, while Morocco, Spain, and Portugal have formed a joint bid for the 2030 tournament, with Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay all set to host a match as part of the centenary edition.\nThe Saudi bid “presents a very strong all-round proposition, reflected in the results of the technical evaluation, which assesses the proposed infrastructure (both sporting and general) as well as its commercial potential,” FIFA said in its report.\nBut football’s world governing body cautioned, “In terms of human rights, the undertaking involved in implementing the various measures… particularly in certain areas, could involve significant effort and time.”\nFifa said that was the basis for the elevated risk rating for a bid that received an average score of 4.2 out of 5—higher than the combined bid by the US, Canada, and Mexico for the 2026 World Cup.\n“It is important to note that the bid involves significant opportunities for positive human rights impact,” added Fifa.\n“There is good potential that the tournament could serve as a catalyst for some of the ongoing and future reforms and contribute to positive human rights outcomes for people in Saudi Arabia and the region that go beyond the scope of the tournament itself.”\nSaudi Arabia has yet to build several proposed stadiums for a tournament that could be held in winter, as was the case in Qatar.\nHuman rights, a source of deep controversy at the 2022 World Cup in neighbouring Qatar, threatens to become a major talking point once again in the run-up to 2034.\nRights groups highlight mass executions in Saudi Arabia and allegations of torture, as well as restrictions on women under the conservative country’s male guardianship system.\nFree expression is severely restricted, with some people handed lengthy jail terms over critical posts on social media.\nSaudi Arabia, which is hosting several high-profile events, including Formula One and the WTA tennis finals, is often accused of “sportswashing”—using s sport to divert attention from its rights record.\nIn addition to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, several other recent major sporting events have been hosted by Arab nations and Asian countries, PUNCH Online reports.\nIn Asia, Japan and South Korea co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\nAFP",
