  "body_text": "Straide Pieta Darkness into Light Walk will take place at 4.15am on the morning of Saturday, May 11.\nThis will be Straide’s first year as an official walk and everyone is welcomed to come and meet up in the village and walk this lovely rural route. A registration event is being held this Thursday, May 2, at the Straide Davitt Community Hall between 7 and 8pm or you can register online at www.darknessintolight.ie and click on the Mayo/Straide option.\nStraide is one of 13 official walks in the county this year, including Achill, Ballina, Ballinrobe, Ballyglass, Ballyhaunis, Castlebar, Claremorris, Erris, Inishturk, Kiltimagh, Lahardane and Westport.\nSince 2006 when Pieta first opened its doors, they have supported over 60,000 people in suicidal distress or engaging in self-harm, and families and friends who have lost a loved one to suicide. Last year, Pieta provided over 50,000 hours of free counselling to those in crisis. They received over 100,000 calls and texts to the 24/7 crisis helpline. Please join us this year and walk with us to help end suicide and self-harm.\nThe Foxford Salmon Anglers (FSA) have issued their first fishing report of the new season. It’s very early days, of course, but the good news was that two salmon were reported caught for the week ending Sunday, April 21, with river levels starting to return to where they should be.\nFSA have also reported that 697 salmon were caught in 2023 which was down five on the previous year, but that there were significantly fewer anglers fishing last year – partly because of the enormous rainfall.\nThat did put the club into negative return because of the reduced revenues but it’s hoped for a more productive 2024 providing the anglers return.\nS&F United is celebrating the incredible achievement of no fewer than six of its players being involved in the Mayo Football League’s U13 team that on Saturday last, April 27, booked its place in the All-Ireland SFAI U13 Inter-League Bowl Final.\nS&F have by far the biggest representation, occupying a third of the 18-strong squad. Castlebar Celtic are the next best represented with three players.\nThe team travelled to Rearcross in Co Tipperary on Saturday, and having scored twice in the opening three minutes, they went on to beat the home county 6-0, with S&F’s Calum Costello scoring the third and fourth goals either side of half-time, and clubmate Sean Walsh scoring the sixth. Joining them on the Mayo panel are Rian Jordan, Michael Ruane, Mounir Soufan and Rory Gruddy.\nThe final is due to be played in Limerick on the weekend of May 18/19.\nIt was a busy – and successful – week on the pitch for Straide and Foxford United teams.\nIt was a historical and memorable one too for the U11 boys who played their first competitive match in the Mayo League and picked up all three points thanks to a 4-3 win against Snugboro United. Conor Ruddy struck a hat-trick with the other goal coming from Oisin McHale.\nOn Wednesday evening, S&F’s U15s were also victorious when firing no fewer than eight goals past near neighbours Swinford FC. Dara Gaughan bagged five of the goals while there was a brace from Leo Lavarde and a goal too from Yaroslav Solodovnikov, in what was an all-round excellent performance from the entire team.\nS&F United’s newly-formed U15 girls team was also in action and picked up its first win when playing host to Newport Mulranny Wanderers on Thursday. There were five goals and a clean sheet thanks to some fantastic teamwork. Mia Goggins and Addison McDonnell scored two goals each while the other player to hit the net was Clodagh Fahy.\nThen, on Friday night, Dallan Munnelly, Sean Flynn, Cillian Tighe and Jack Jordan scored a goal apiece as S&F United recorded a richly deserved 4-1 win over local rivals Conn Rangers in the Mayo U13 Division 3B Boys League clash at Mount Falcon.\nAlso on Friday, at Green Road, Siobhan Wilson and Fiona Doherty scored the goals that saw S&F United pick up both points in the Mayo Women’s Premier Division thanks to a 2-0 win against Swinford. Wilson was also on target when S&F beat Kiltimagh/Knock United 1-0 the week before.\nCongratulations to members of Foxford’s CCÉ Admiral Brown branch who together with friends from Castlebar Comhaltas and CCÉ Cleary Coyne made up 'Luasc', the traditional music group that represented Mayo and Connacht in the National Concert Hall, Dublin at the Siansa Gael Linn finals recently.\nWell done to branch officer Stephen Doherty who was group mentor and who had two of his own compositions performed during the performance.\nTwenty-five children and their families are preparing to celebrate First Holy Communion this coming Saturday, May 4, at St Michael’s Church in Foxford.

The school’s athletes competed across a variety of events including javelin, discus, shot put, long jump, race walking, sprints and middle distance. The good news is that as many as eight of the students qualified for the Connacht finals taking place in Athlone this May.\nRory Gruddy qualified in both the minor boys' 1,500m and race walk while both Darragh Ruane and Thomas McLoughlin advanced in minor boys javelin. Qualifying in the junior girls 800m were Shauna Breslin and Caoimhe Noone, with Laoise Doherty and Darragh Breslin going forth in the junior girls and boys race walk while Lee Breslin qualified in the junior boys discus.\nVery unfortunate not to reach the Connacht finals were Owen O’Hora and Evan Hannick who both ran strongly in a very competitive intermediate boys 800m race, finishing just outside the qualifying spots.\nWell done to all of the athletes and best of luck to those preparing for Connacht.\nThere were two significant wins for First Year teams at St Joseph’s Secondary School this week.\nThe girls' soccer team beat St Patrick’s College, Lacken Cross thanks to goals by Emily Coleman and Clodagh Fahy and so progress to the Connacht semi-final while the boys' football team got the better of St Joseph’s, Galway in the Connacht semi-final at the Connacht GAA Centre of Excellence. They are wished the very best of luck in their upcoming provincial final.\nThe funeral Mass of Foxford native Caroline Moran took place last Sunday, April 28, at St Muredach’s Cathedral in Ballina.\nCaroline (née Joyce), who was originally from Stonepark, passed peacefully surrounded by her loving family at her residence at Greenhills Estate, Ballina following a short illness.\nCaroline, who was predeceased by her parents Joe and Nora Joyce, father-in-law Paddy Moran and her grandchildren Kaden and River Moran, was the beloved wife of Padraig, and the loving mother to sons Paul, Jason, Eric, and Ryan.

And part of the Mayo U14 team that won the Connacht LGFA Silver Championship Final against Sligo were Rhea Gostick and Megan Byrne.\nWell done to all.\nFoxford National School was proudly represented on the double at the recent Connacht SFC semi-final between Mayo and Roscommon at Dr Hyde Park when two of its students got to play in the Cumann na mBunscol football exhibition at half-time.\nSophie McHale featured on a Mayo girls side that also included Grace Hannick from nearby Currabaggan NS in Knockmore, while Michael Ruane played for the Mayo boys team. Both Sophie and Michael are members of Moy Davitts GAA Club.\nIan McHugh, from The Riverbank, Foxford was the winner of €100 in this week’s S&F United 50/50 draw.\nThere’s great local representation on the Mayo Women’s League senior squad that has been selected to play in the 2024 Angela Hearst Cup. The S&F United pairing of Stephanie Loughney and Michelle Ruane have both been picked as have Tracey Hall (Manulla FC) and Beth Roache (Swinford FC), both of whom also play Gaelic football with Moy Davitts LGFA.\nThe Angela Hearst Cup will see Mayo play their opening game on Saturday, May 4, away to current holders Eastern Women's League. The Mayo squad is drawn from seven clubs across the county.\nHard luck to the Moy Davitts U16 footballers who narrowly lost to East Mayo rivals Aghamore in the league last Wednesday evening.
