  "body_text": "Chelsea defender Jess Carter has caused a stir after she liked several social media posts criticising comments from her manager Emma Hayes about player-to-player relationships.\nHayes, who is set to leave the club at the end of the season, said that both player-to-coach and player-to-player relationships were ‘inappropriate’ in a press conference on Thursday.\nThe comments came after Leicester City suspended manager Willie Kirk over his alleged relationship with a player in his squad.\nThe previous month, Sheffield United sacked Jonathan Morgan, the manager of their women’s side, after it emerged he had been in a relationship with a player when he was at a previous club.\nThere are several high-profile player relationships in the Women’s Super League, including Carter, who is dating fellow Chelsea teammate Ann Katrin Berger.\nWhile the England international has not spoken out publicly against Hayes’ remarks, the 26-year-old has liked a number of posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, that were critical of her manager’s stance.\nOne comment from sports presenter Beth Fisher read: ‘Beyond bonkers to bring player-to-player relationships into this conversation in my opinion.’\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

One might be in the last year of their contract, one might not be. One might be competing in a position with someone else, you don’t need me to spell that out, it presents challenges,’ she said.\nMore Trending\n‘It’s quite challenging for coaching teams to have to deal with it. You talk about it from a hierarchal perspective, it doesn’t mean it doesn’t present challenges, it does, I think you have to work an awful lot on how to manage those challenges in the locker room because they are far from ideal.’\nLiverpool women’s manager Matt Beard, meanwhile, has suggested that he has ‘no issues’ with player-to-player relationships.\n‘I think one in five people meet their long-term partner in a work environment,’ he said. ‘The key thing is that if there is a relationship it doesn’t affect your day-to-day job but for me, I’ve got no issues with it.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino explains why he was at Brighton v Roma match\nMORE: Mauricio Pochettino cracks up journalists over Chelsea’s £90.1m financial losses\nMORE: Mauricio Pochettino bizarrely claims the weather will impact Chelsea’s FA Cup hopes",
