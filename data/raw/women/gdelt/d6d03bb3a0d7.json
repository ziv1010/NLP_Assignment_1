  "body_text": "West Alabama Monday Briefing\nGood morning West Alabama! It is Monday, November 25, 2024.\nMonday Morning Observations:\nThe sun came up yesterday morning. And I'll be darned if it didn't come up again this morning. Life goes on despite the Alabama Football Team's embarrassing loss to a 5-5 Oklahoma team this past weekend.\nProblem is that sunshine is creating a dark shadow over Mike DeBose, err, Kalen DeBoer's football team. They were outcoached, outplayed and out desired by a Sooner team that looked more like Barry Switzer's 11-0 1974 team than Brent Venables struggling 2024 squad.\nAt least in the Vanderbilt and Tennessee loses the Crimson Tide was in the game and had chances to win. In Saturday night's game Alabama was never really in the game after they took the initial 3-0 lead. From that point on, the then #7 ranked Tide was manhandled by unranked Oklahoma. OU was the definite most physical team on the field while Bama looked intimidated and unprepared.\nDespite Alabama playing the worst it has since Nick Saban's 2007 team lost to Louisiana Monroe, oddsmakers have the Tide a heavy favorite to beat the surging Auburn Tigers in this weekend's Iron Bowl at Bryant-Denny.\nThe wagering for UA probably is based on the game being at Bryant-Denny instead of the miracle producer that is Jorden-Hare in Auburn. But you can bet the 5-5 Tigers will come into T-Town fired up after Saturday night's four overtime win over Texas A&M and a chance to become bowl eligible with a victory.\nAlabama is playing for pride now against their arch-rival but is that enough? Does a win over the cross-state rival mean anything in this day of playoffs, NIL, opt outs and the transfer portal when little but pride and a bowl game are at stake?\nThis may be the most important game of his career for first year Tide Coach Kalen DeBoer. It may be bigger than last year when he took Washington to the national title game.\nSaturday's game will be either abate the criticism for now or light the fire under a cauldron of dissatisfaction.\n(Opinions expressed in Morning Briefing are not necessarily those of the ownership, management or staff of Townsquare Media Tuscaloosa)\nWeather:\nREAD MORE: West Alabama Thanksgiving Holiday Weather Outlook\nThe Forecast:\nIt looks like the residents of Mayfair in East Tuscaloosa have convinced the city to not demolish the pedestrian bridge over Veteran's Parkway East. Tuscaloosa City Council President Kip Tyner says he never trusted the numbers that claimed the walking bridge was not being used.\nAAA says today will be one of the busiest travel days ever on our state and nation's roadways. More than 90-million motorists are expected to hit the road beginning today.\nTwo Habitat for Humanity Houses will be dedicated in honor of Nick and Terry Saban tomorrow at 10:00am at Milestone Circle in Tuscaloosa. The former Tide football coach and first lady have been very active in the Habitat for Humanity program since coming to Tuscaloosa.\nA Childersburg woman is dead and two other people were taken to the hospital after a head-on collision near Tuscaloosa Saturday. The crash on Alabama 171 near mile marker 13, about 16 miles north of Tuscaloosa took the life of 80-year-old Barbara J Kornegay. Three other people were injured.\nFormer Alabama Football Players John and Brodie Croyle were two of the speakers during the chapel dedication at Freedom Farm in the Coker Community Sunday.\nAlabama Attorney General Steve Marshall has joined several other state's AGs in challenging the legality of transgender women and girls competing in sports.\nTopping Sports News:",
