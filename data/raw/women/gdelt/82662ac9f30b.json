  "body_text": "Match of the Day fans give their verdict as Gary Lineker's replacements are officially unveiled\nMatch of the Day viewers gave a mixed reaction to Gabby Logan, Kelly Cates and Mark Chapman being announced today as the new hosts after Gary Lineker leaves.\nThe confirmation follows speculation about the presenting line-up of the BBC's flagship football show following news last year that Lineker would step back.\nThe former England striker has presented the show since 1999 but will depart at the end of the season.\nOne viewer tweeted: 'I'm really glad Match of the Day are going with 3 rotating hosts, individually I don't think anyone could fill Gary's shoes but having multiple will keep it feeling fresh.'\nAnother said: 'Mark Chapman, Gabby Logan and Kelly Cates will be the new hosts of Match of The Day from the start of next season. I think all three are great choices to be presenters on the programme.'\nBut a third wrote: 'Can't stand Gabby so that's another football show going down the pan.' And a fourth posted: 'Definitely not watching it now.'\nKelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan were today confirmed by the BBC as the new Match of the Day presenters from next season, with the broadcasting also issuing this image\nAfter the announcement, Logan said: 'It's always a real moment (sitting in the chair) because it has such history. It's still so relevant to so many people now and talked about in a landscape where TV's changed so much.\n'There's an enormous responsibility to make sure we continue to evolve while at the same time respecting the traditions of Match of the Day. People want to see the goals, they want to see the incidents, they want to see the moments everyone's talking about, so while we can tinker at the edges, the core is the football.'\nCates, who will also continue her role with Sky Sports, said: 'Once I sit in that chair and the theme music starts, I just know that's going to be a really incredible moment. I've worked with a lot of the pundits before and they're all fantastic, so I'm just looking forward to getting started.\n'I've known Gabby and Mark really well for years so to bring it all together, embracing the digital side of things, it feels like a really comprehensive football package for fans and that's what makes it so exciting too.'\nShe has been a presenter with Sky Sports since rejoining them in 2016, fronting their coverage of the Premier League.\nThe 49-year-old daughter of former Scotland and Liverpool footballer Sir Kenny Dalglish also hosts BBC Radio 5 Live's Tuesday night sports coverage.\nFormer gymnast Logan, 51, became one of the first female sports anchors to break into terrestrial television and has covered several Olympic Games, the World Cup and the Commonwealth Games during her tenure at the BBC.\nShe has presented Match Of The Day in Lineker's absence on many occasions, while she also fronted the BBC's coverage as the Lionesses stormed to glory in the Women's Euros in 2023.\nMeanwhile, Chapman, 51, has been broadcasting for more than 25 years and presents BBC's Match Of The Day 2 covering the action and reaction from the Premier League.\nOn sharing the role with Cates and Logan, Chapman said: 'This isn't about the three of us, it's about the three of us plus our pundits, plus our editors, plus our analysts and stats people and production people, radio and online. Genuinely this is about all of us as a department working together.'\nLogan and Chapman also host a Global Player podcast together, titled The Sports Agents.\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying",
