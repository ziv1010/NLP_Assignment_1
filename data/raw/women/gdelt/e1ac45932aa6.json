  "body_text": "Canberra United coach Antoni Jagarinec admitted if the A-League Women's team's immediate future was secured any later then they probably wouldn't have been able to put a team together anyway.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nMatildas star and United captain Michelle Heyman felt the best way to ensure the club lasts beyond the upcoming season was by winning another ALW title.\nUnited announced Heyman and Jagarinec's re-signings for the 2025-26 season on Monday, with The Canberra Times revealing Jagarinc was the front-runner for the job last week.\nBut Capital Football only confirmed they would be able to run United this summer last month - after the ACT government almost doubled their funding to $400,000 per year.\nWith pre-season training starting about September 22, Jagarinec said it would've been unrealistic to expect Canberra players to wait on the club indefinitely before exploring their options elsewhere.\nIt's why he was trying to keep his United team in the loop as much as possible - and he was confident of being able to retain most of last season's squad.\n\"They wanted to be here first. It was coming to a point where ... it's their jobs, they had to make life decisions,\" Jagarinec said.\n\"These things don't happen in a week, too, so we couldn't announce we were going ahead one week before pre-season - otherwise we probably wouldn't have had a team.\n\"It was getting pretty tight where players - we had to make sure they were entertaining all the options that they had on the table, just in case, whilst being pretty positive that we were going to be around.\n\"I didn't personally, and Capital Football didn't want to be the reason why players weren't playing in the summer.\n\"Now we're alive and going ahead, we will retain a lot of our players.\"\nHeyman felt it wouldn't be the A-League if there wasn't a Canberra United in it.\nUnited were champions in 2012 and 2015, and were also minor premiers in 2012.\nHeyman, who has her sights set on playing for the Matildas at next year's Asian Cup, wanted to help return the club to those glory days.\nCanberra made the finals for the first time in four years last season.\n\"I think it's silly to have Canberra out of the A-League,\" Heyman said.\n\"I believe that if there's no football in Canberra, then it doesn't make any sense in my mind.\n\"Especially [since] we were the winners for a very long time here and we've had an incredible history at this club.\n\"So fingers crossed, next year if it just continues. I feel like they can't fire you if you win the league.\"\nWith Capital Football again saying they will only run United for one more season, Canberra needs to secure an owner for an A-League Men's licence to guarantee their future.\nThat search has been going for two-and-a-half years and, while it was believed to be close to an announcement a few months ago, things have gone quiet.\nJagarinec said talks were ongoing in the background.\n\"There's talks there. We're talking about big money, big clubs, big logistics, there's big compliance,\" he said.\n\"These things don't happen overnight.\n\"Serious talks have been going on for 18 months or two years, but well above my level and definitely above my pay grade.\n\"We'll see what happens by the end of the year.\"\n'We were devastated': Canberra's two biggest signings revealed for last season\nCanberra United fans have been given a double boost a month after the team was saved again, with Capital Football unveiling its first signings for what it says will be the organisation's last season.\nCapital Football has agreed to help fund United for at least one more season after negotiations for a private owner to take the reins fell over at the last minute.\nThe ACT government has upped its financial contribution to $400,000 per season - an increase of $150,000 to the annual agreement - to help the team avoid financial disaster.\nAnd the money is already being put to good use as Capital Football rebuilds from the ground up.\nThe governing body announced on Monday Antoni Jagarinec had been locked in as coach for a second season while gun striker Michelle Heyman has also agreed to a new deal.\n\"I am incredibly excited to be back at the helm for my second season as head coach of Canberra United,\" Jagarinec said.\n\"Last season was an unbelievable experience for me, making the step up into the role having been at the club for some time.\n\"It was an honour to lead this club back to finals football, where we belong. While we couldn't get the result we wanted that night, it was still an incredible achievement from the playing group and staff to be there.\"\nJagarinec and Heyman were the first two big targets for United and give the team a stable base to build on.\nJagarinec is hopeful of re-signing the bulk of the squad, which lifted United back to the finals for the first time in four years.\nBut Capital Football boss Samantha Farrow asked fans to be patient last week, issuing a public message to the team's supporters after the ownership structure was finalised.\nCapital Football is adamant this year will be the last time it oversees Canberra United operations after launching the team almost 20 years ago.\nCapital Football was ready to pull the pin on Canberra United last year, citing increased costs and the financial burden as reasons for stepping away.\nBut a government rescue package and a fan fundraising effort sealed their future for one more season.\nThe ownership was then expected to be transferred to a private backer, and talks were advanced but ultimately fell over at the final hurdle.\nMORE CANBERRA SPORT\nThe Australian Professional Leagues are still keen to find a private backer for a men's and women's Canberra team next year.\nIn the meantime, resurgent Matildas goal-scoring star Heyman is keen to continue United's revival after a strong 2024-25 campaign.\n\"I couldn't be happier to back in green for the new season,\" Heyman said.\n\"This club means everything to me. Canberra is my home, and I love pulling on the jersey each and every week in front of the best fans in the country.\n\"I've had some of the most memorable moments of my career at this club, and I can't wait to get started and create more special moments.\n\"While we were devastated to not go further in the finals, making that far was an incredible achievement from the group. We want to go further this year and bring some silverware back to Canberra for our fans.\"",
