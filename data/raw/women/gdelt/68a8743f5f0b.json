  "body_text": "Ahead of the Euros final, The King has spoken but will the England team fulfil his royal command?\nKing Charles III told the team he’d rather like it if they could win the crunch game in a rather less nerve wracking manner than the way they’ve taken some of their previous matches.\nAs he offered congratulations to the men’s team reaching their second Euros final in a matter of years, The King added ‘‘If I may encourage you to secure victory before the need for any last minute wonder-goals or another penalties drama, I am sure the stresses on the nation’s collective heart rate and blood pressure would be greatly alleviated!”\nThe royal command came as The King led celebrations for Gareth Southgate’s team making it to Berlin. His Majesty said ‘‘My wife and I join all our family in wishing you the warmest congratulations on reaching the final of the U.E.F.A. European Championship – and in sending our very best wishes for Sunday’s match.”\nEngland’s men hope to emulate the successes of the women’s team – the Lionesses won the Euros in 2022. The team take on Spain in the final in Berlin.\nPrince William, President of the Football Association, will be at the match at the Olympic Stadium. However, Spain’s royals have taken an early lead when it comes to support. King Felipe VI will be there alongside his younger daughter, Infanta Sofia, who is a big football fan and who was present to see Spain’s women win the World Cup in Australia in 2023.\nThe Prince of Wales has been at two England matches earlier in the tournament and also visited the team before the tournament started where he passed on the advice of Prince Louis who wanted the players to eat more to ensure success.\nWhether they’ve had double breakfast or not, the final word rests with The King who ended his message with ”good luck, England. Charles R.”",
