We’ve done a lot of work in the summer to try and get through this season and the project has already started now to relay the pitch for next season.\n“But once we’ve got that hybrid pitch in, it will allow us to do much more things like that.”\nTown has previously staged one senior men’s international, the 3-1 victory over Croatia in August 2003.\nThe last England game at Portman Road was the men’s U21 international in October 2013 which ended in a 5-0 victory over Lithuania, while Switzerland (1980, 5-0), Romania (1985, 3-0), Albania (1989, 2-0) and the Czech Republic (1998, 0-1) having also visited Suffolk for internationals at that level. An U23 match against Switzerland was hosted in 1972.\nIn 2001/02, the England U19s beat Germany 3-1 with Darren Bent scoring twice and then-Town teammate Matt Bloomfield appearing as a substitute.\nThe ground also played host to a 1959 pre-Olympic Games friendly between Great Britain and the Caribbean FA ahead of the 1960 Games in Rome. It was also the venue for a hockey international fought out by Great Britain and West Germany in the summer of 1968.\nCurrently the Town women’s team play their games at Felixstowe & Walton’s AGL Arena but despite that there is a close link between the men’s and women’s sides of the club.\n“We’re very, very grateful for Felixstowe & Walton’s help and their support,” Ashton continued. “You talk about the women’s team, tell me another football club whose first-team play followed by the women’s team [at AFC Wimbledon in this summer’s friendlies] and the men’s first-team manager stays after the game and sits on the bench with the women’s first-team manager and talks them through the game.\n“That’s incredible. That’s Ipswich. That’s different, that’s community, that’s this football club.\n“That isn’t asked of Kieran to do things like that, that’s the genuine person he is, who wants to help and assist, and I just think that is something that we don’t talk enough about.\n“It’s really special to this football club, the women’s team’s really important to us and we’ll continue to support Joe as best we can.”\nMcKenna paid tribute to Sheehan: “Joe’s a very good coach as well and I learn from his as well. We talk about football, he comes to watch a lot of our training, he’s got his own good ideas as well.\n“He’s a good contact for me at the training ground. When he comes out on the pitch we keep him busy and there’s always a job for him, and he gets involved in the sessions. He’s a good, bright young coach as well and a good one to have in the club.”\nAre there aspects of the way the women’s team play that the men can learn from? “I think there are some similarities between the playing styles now, I’ve been speaking to Joe about this a little bit and they’ve adapted a few little tweaks to the system and a few little things that we do and we share some ideas and he watches all our sessions and takes things and puts into them.\n“I think there’s commonalities now across the styles between the two teams. I think they were better than us at set plays but we’re working to catch up with them on that, but again he’s a very good coach.\n“I think they’ve obviously got a very young squad and he’s had to renew that again this season. That’s another rebuilding project for him and developing a lot of young players in the first team, which is a great challenge for him, but he’s enjoying it and I think the girls will give it everything they can to have another successful season.”\nPhoto: ITFC\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\nIf my memory is correct there was also a ‘B ‘ international late 1950's / very early 1960's staged in the evening but abandoned because of fog ; I think John Elsworthy figured in that team .\nNo doubt someone else will have accurate recall !\nCOYB\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
