  "body_text": "Alabama (30-10, 7-8) drops two of three to Texas A&M (33-9, 12-6) at home.\nAlabama Softball Continues Downward Spiral vs Texas A&M\nKayla Beaver cannot do everything for the Crimson Tide.\nGAME 1: ALABAMA 2, TEXAS A&M 0\nIt seemed like old times. And by that I mean about a month ago when Abby Duchscherer was looking like an All-Star before sliding into major slump. Alabama had two measly hits. One of them was a single by Emma Broadfoot, and the other was a double by “Duke” three batters later in the 2nd inning with two runners aboard.\nThe other part of that “old times” recipe is Kayla Beaver (W, 14-3) pitching her heart out. The Tide ace scattered six singles and two walks while striking half a dozen.\nGAME 2: TEXAS A&M 17, ALABAMA 6\nThe Crimson Tide have hit the lowest of low spots of the season with this football score defeat. 17 runs for the away team are the most all-time for Texas A&M in SEC play and most runs given up by an Alabama team in the program’s history. The Aggies banged out 13 hits including two home runs.\nPatrick Murphy must have used up all his magic wishes because nothing he tried worked. After a fly out in the 1st inning, starter Jocelyn Briski (L, 6-2) gave up a walk and a single to put runners on the corners. This was followed by a grounder to Broadfoot playing first base, who oddly opted for the tougher maneuver of throwing to second base instead of going home for what surely would have been the second out. The throw to second was late, all runners were safe, and TAMU took an early lead. Then, a bloop single dropped near the foul line in front of Kendal Clark - who did not look exactly like she was going full speed after the ball - and then deked a throw instead of actually throwing the dang ball. In short, Bama was in a 2-0 hole because of mental errors. A strikeout, wild pitch and strikeout would end the bleeding at 3-0. Meanwhile: Bama went down 1-2-3.\nAfter one out in the 2nd, an Aggie laid down a bunt that nobody seemed ready for. The ball almost came to a complete stop before Broadfoot fielded it and threw late to first. The next batter was hit by an inside pitch and Murphy panicked. He brought in Alea Johnson. Even if Alea had no-hit the next 17 batters, this was a bad move. Briski had not pitched as bad as the box score might indicate. She was letdown by the stupid fielding choices of her teammates. I say let her work through it and learn. But no.\nAlea struck out her first batter on three pitches and was feeling good. After working the next batter to an 0-2 count, an Aggie stole third on a delayed steal without a throw (blame goes squarely on catcher Riley Valentine and the coaching staff plus infield who did not notice the runner halfway off second base). This move seemed to rattle Alea and took her out of her “zone”. The next two pitches were balls and then a 2-run single with second base taken on a sad throw home. The next batter grounded what should have been out number three to Kenleigh Cahalan but she threw high to first base. A collision ensued and another Aggie run crossed the plate to make it 6-0. In short, pitching was not terrible (just yet). It was boneheaded plays in the field.\nIn the bottom of the 2nd, Bailey Dowling had a solo homer - the only kind of four-bagger she seems to ever hit. TAMU answered right back with a solo shot in the 3rd. Bama stringed a couple of singles together to get one back in the 4th. They loaded the bases with one out but could not push another run across. Jaala Torrence pitched a 1-2-3 5th inning.\nIn the bottom of the frame, Clark followed two walks with a 3-run bomb to bring the Tide closer at 7-5.\nIn the 6th, Torrence was battered in her second inning of work on a single, walk, single, and a double that almost left the yard on consecutive batters to make it 9-5. Yet, Murphy stuck with her. A sac fly made it 10-5. Bama added one in the bottom of the inning, but then Alex Salter entered the game. Six of the next seven Texas A&M batters would reach base and score four more runs. Murphy continued his mind-f**k of freshman Briski by reinserting her back in this awful game. After coaxing a flyout to the wall, she served up a three run homer to make it 17-6.\nGAME 3: TEXAS A&M 9, ALABAMA 4\nAs we are discovering, Beaver is not built for the Montana Fouts treatment.\nIn the 4th inning with no score, Texas A&M loaded the bases on a Broadfoot fielding error and two walks. The next batter skied a high foul ball to right field. Clark fielded and fired home but the throw short-hopped the catcher Valentine. Clark was ruled with the error but it sure looked like Valentine flinched and should have at least knocked the ball down to hold the second runner at third base.\nIn the bottom of the frame, Alabama too loaded the bases. Duchscherer was hit by pitch for a run. Kali Heivilin singled in two to take a 3-2 lead.\nIn the top of the 5th, a hit by pitch, double, and single evened the score up at three for the Aggs. TAMU took the lead on a ground out. Bama struck right back when Cahalan led off with a triple and scored on a wild pitch.\nThe 6th was a disaster for Beaver as she gave up five runs on four singles and throwing errors by her and her battery mate, Valentine. Boy, this team really misses Marlie Giles.\nBama had four errors on the day.\nNOTES\n- You would think after so many years of coaching women’s softball that The Gut® would finally learn not to get his team all teary-eyed and emotional before a game. Before Sunday’s disaster, the Crimson Tide honored former longtime coach Alyson Habetz. There were hugs and tears, and then the team went out and played the worst game in Alabama softball history.\n- Kristen White led off all three games with Jenna Johnson pushed down in the lineup. White was 0-for6 with two walks and one run scored. Jenna was 3-for-6 with two walks, a HBP, 1 RBI and 2 runs scored. It might be time to end this experiment.\n- The top four in the batting order in all three games was White - Cahalan - Clark - Dowling.\n- The Gut® keeps hoping that blind squirrel finds a nut as he once again had KJ “Triple Goose Egg” Haney pinch hit for .308-hitting Kristen White. And once again, it came in a tight game (Game 1) with a runner on base. It took her all of three swings to end her day and have her walk back to the dugout. She is 0-for-13 with six whiffs.\n- Salter, who had not entered a game since March 19 against Samford, did not look comfortable at all in the circle at Rhoads Stadium. Her season ERA ballooned up to 6.56.\n- The Crimson Tide is now 11th or worse in the SEC in team batting average, runs scored, hits, doubles, total bases, and walks. But at least they are 10th in stolen bases! WOO-HOO! Alabama attempted no stolen bases in the whole series. So much for small ball and the “Greenlight Girls”.\n- During an A&M rally in Game 2, Bama caught an Aggie in a rundown, but Heivilin clumsily collided with her and the runner was rightfully called safe. Has this team ever run rundown drills in practice? So many blunders in that game.\n- The Alabama defense started off the season so well but has been plummeting to the lower depths of the SEC as teh season rolls on. The team fielding percentage is now at .963 on 42 errors. The Tide committed 8 errors in the three-game series and at least one in each game. Cahalan has 11 boots.\nAMBERCRIMSON ALERT: Whatever happened to Lauren Esman? She started off the season looking like Kaylee Tow circa 2021 and now she is all but forgotten. I’m guessing it’s either health, academics, or maybe she refuses to go to church. But seriously, Murphy was so proud of acting like he had found a hidden gem that he would be playing her if she was able. She was seen dressed out for Game 3.- When covering first base on a bunt, Heivilin either got stepped on or clipped on the leg by the runner. It’s funny that Murphy has been cheerleading the safety bag at first and hasn’t been using it at all. All he has to do is have the opposing coach agree to its use. I seriously doubt any, much less all of them, have been opposed.\n- After homering in Game 2, Clark sure took her time rounding the bases. LOL! I timed it at 18 seconds from crack of the bat to touching home.\n- I got this nugget from my softball scout up north: “Through the first five SEC series, the Alabama pitching staff is averaging 8.8 runs per game in the second game of the series.”\n- As mentioned in the preview, it was Alumni Day on Saturday and by gawd they got Montana Fouts to show up.\n- Attendance for the three games at Rhoads Stadium were 4,400 (sellout), 3999, and TBA.\n- Alabama has one final home series (Tennessee) and two road series (Arkansas and Auburn). Yikes.\nMVP\n- n/a\nUPCOMING ALABAMA SCHEDULE\nIt doesn’t get any easier as the Tide heads north to the Ozarks to face the No. 11 Hogs. No midweeker.\n- Friday, April 19 at Arkansas 6p.m.CT - SEC+ stream only\n- Saturday, April 20 at Arkansas 8p.m.CT - SEC Network\n- Sunday, April 21 at Arkansas 1p.m.CT - ESPNU\n#RollTide #Team28",
