Did they? Because what in Big Blue Nation is going on in Lexington? It’s not good, not good at.all. Since Missouri wiped the floor with them on 12/28, they beat Louisville, who is GARBAGE this season (they are 2-12), beat LSU by 3 at home (good win), got annihilated/decimated/destroyed/slaughtered/obliterated by no. 7 Alabama by 26 points in Tuscaloosa, and then on Tuesday night, lost to SOUTH CAROLINA?!? Columbia (L)East, as Josh likes to call it? IN LEXINGTON?!? AT RUPP ARENA?!? A South Carolina team, who did THIS? (also, hi Blake, in case you read this)\nA South Carolina (no. 205!! in KP) team that, besides the aforementioned blowout to Tennessee, also lost in large sums to… wait for it… no. 186 George Washington (by 24), no. 100 Furman (by 19), no. 60 UAB (by 14, Love you AK), and no. 117 Colorado State (by 32). South Carolina is not good, you guys. Like, at.all. KP predicts them to finish 11-20, and 4-14 in the SEC. EEEK.\nSo yeah…. Kentucky now sits at 10-6 on the season and 1-3 in the SEC (they’re now predicted to finish 8-10). And this isn’t one of those Cal will right the ship later things, it seems like. I just cannot fathom this information. My brain is broken.\nWe’re all confused. So confused.\n[Additionally, Rock M regrets to inform you that Parker, who’s social media is shared below, is no longer employed by this site. He made a deadly error of pointing out OU beating kU at The Phog with 5 minutes left, and essentially, - most definitely - changed the course of the game. We apologize for the hurt that Parker has caused. Hugs.]\nKentucky…. Cal… it’s time for one of those meetings I learned about when I lived in NC. It’s time for a ‘Come to Jesus’ meeting, because I’m going to need you to get your shit together. I simply will not allow you are drag down the beauty of that Missouri Tiger bluegrass beatdown, ya hear me?\nMoving on.\nThe Tigers are in College Station with Isiaih Mosley in tow. Will he play? Who’s to say? But he boarded the plane, which is more than we can say for the Arkansas game, right? I can’t help but feel like it was a choice to feature him, even talking to the camera. As an avid watcher of said videos, they don’t often showcase everyone.\nBefore we move on, here’s the quick 10 Hochman video to remind us of what’s going on with the Tigers this week. I wish it’d just let me imbed it, but alas, nope.\nAbout tonight’s opponent (7:30pm CST, SECN), Buzz Williams and his very tight vest has got this Aggies team rolling after they knocked off LSU 69-56 at home on Saturday and Florida 66-64 in The Swamp three days prior. We’ll have the preview out this morning, so stay tuned.\nAnd finally, Tuesday is Bracket Day, so it is my duty to share this info with you this morning. Bracket Day is fun when your teams are INCLUDED in the bracket, right?\nAfter a 1-1 week which saw the no. 20/20 Tigers lose a hefty lead and take an L in Bud Walton, but also show they can win a close game in the SEC with a win over Vandy at home, Missouri finds themselves firmly planted on the 6-seed line in Joey Brackets’ new edition. As a reminder, they were a 6-seed last week, and a 9-seed after Illinois (who seems to be back to winning, thankthelord).\nAccording to Lunardi’s new rationale, Missouri is listed as the overall no. 23 seed (was no. 20 last week), on the 6-seed line. Checks out. Betcha Kentucky ain’t on there next week!\nThis week we have a new bracket to add to the mix. Andy Katz released his first bracket at NCAA.com and also his Power 36. Muss Bus fans are big mad over this, L O L.\nKatz’s seed list (and there’s a corresponding video here, too) has Mizzou as the no. 28 overall seed, and on the 7-line.\nAnd this one is just kinda absurdly funny, because it will NEVER happen. Could you IMAGINE? They would make infinite amounts of money off of chaotic seeding like this.\nOh, and just in case you were wondering, Mizzou still didn’t make The Athletic’s top 25. Is Mr Davis trying to be unique? Funny? Go kick rocks, Seth.\nOn the women’s side, Charlie Creme also released a new bracket. Looks like the throttling by Arkansas— they’re really good, guys — didn’t disrupt Pingeton’s squad. FWIW, he’s got the Hogs as a 7-seed, and they only have losses to ranked LSU & Oregon, and to USF.\nOn to the Links. MIZ! Say goodbye, Buzz.\nCheck out the pregame primer at MUTigers.com.\nYesterday at Rock M\n- New Dive Cuts from Sam Snelling (before he flees the country) and guest cohost, Matt Watkins: We are getting into the heart of SEC play.

My heart.\n“Cuonzo, in my opinion, is 1,000% everything that’s right about college coaches — as a person, as a leader, as a man, as a husband, as a father,” (Buzz) Williams said. “I have always held him in the highest regard and have the utmost admiration and respect for who he is.”\n- Columbia Missourian: Missouri faces SEC road test against Texas A&M (Jack Knowlton)\n- Listen to the coaches at the most recent Tiger Talk: Robin & Jasmine James | Dennis & Michael Fly\n- Make sure you give a listen to the new Mizzou, That’s Who podcast, as Tucker, Gabe & Maggie chat about what Mizzou NEEDS to call this a successful season.\n- Noah went on a nature/fishing podcast.

That is bullshit.\n- Just a reminder from DG on the week’s events:\nMizzou in the Pros\n[back with the former player and pro stats Friday]\nWhile the Jazz have cooled since their surprising 10-3 start, Clarkson has remained hot offensively. The 6-foot-5, 195-pounder was averaging a career-high 20.6 points, 2.7 made 3-pointers, 4.5 assists and 3.9 rebounds per game for the surprising Jazz entering Tuesday (UPDATE STATS). The San Antonio native has also embraced being in Salt Lake City as he re-signed to a four-year, $52 million deal with the Jazz in 2020.\nRead the whole thing. It’s so great. JC is such an interesting guy.\n- Donovan Mitchell scores 46 in Utah return, but Jazz rally behind ex-Tiger Clarkson to beat Cavs (John Coon, Associated Press via Columbia Missourian)\n- Speaking of (former) Utah Jazz people, looks like Quin has lined up a coaching gig.\n- MITCH!!!!!!!!!!!

It’s really hard to find stats and stuff for the Euroleagues.\n— — — — — — — — — — — — —\nIf you’re looking to sign up for ESPN+, Rock M Nation now has an affiliate link: click Here for ESPN+ Now!\nIf you’re looking to sign up for a new streaming service, you can try FuboTV: click HERE for FuboTV access — FuboTV now has ESPN, CBS, FS1 and more sports channels.\n(** RockMNation has affiliate partnerships.
