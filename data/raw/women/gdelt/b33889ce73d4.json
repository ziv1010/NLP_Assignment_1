Banteer playing with the aid of a stiff breeze started brightest pointing inside 30 seconds through Brian Philpott.\nUnfortunately Banteer would not score again for another fifteen minutes while Newmarket hit the men in red & white for 1-4 to lead by six points at the opening quarter mark.\nThe second quarter saw Banteer score four points through Luke Philpott (2), Tadghy Sexton & an Evan O’ Brien effort. Banteer now behind 1-5 to 0-5.\nSadly for the village outfit two quick fire goals increased the margin and made that said margin almost unassailable.\nTwo Luke Philpott frees narrowed the gap but the Newmarket side still lead on a scoreline of 3-9 to 0-7 at the short whistle.\nThe gap didn’t improve after the turnover with Newmarket grabbing a plethora of points, although Alan Coughlan did enjoy some change when moved up to the forwards slotting home a classy goal & pointing soon after that also.\nAs an aside Kevin Roche did come on as a late sub to play his last game for Banteer having been involved playing in the Adult Dressing Room since 2006 while Conor O’ Keeffe also hangs up his boots having made his Adult debut way back in 1998 playing for Banteer through three consecutive decades. Both players giving outstanding service to the Banteer GAA Club.\nThe Full Time score Newmarket 3-22 to Banteers 1-11.\nTeam: M Twomey, C O’ Neill, J McAuliffe, E O’ Brien, S Kelleher, R O’ Connor, A Coughlan, R O’ Connell, T Sexton, A Kearney, L Philpott, Conor O’ Keeffe, J Sexton, K Tarrant & B Philpott.\nSubs: C Crowley, K Roche, K Barry, A O’ Shea, L O’ Brien, Cian O’ Keeffe, Darren Murphy & D O’ Donoghue.\nThe GAA Club would also like to thank Eoin O’ Mahony for his time & effort as Coach along with his Selectors Teddy Fitzgerald & Donal Roche for their work throughout the past year as well.\nCongratulations\nHuge congratulations to Tomás Kiely, Shronebeha who competed for Ireland in the U17 British and Irish Mountain running championships in Wales recently, with Tomás finishing in 18th place overall and was the 3rd Irish man home.\nBanteer Tidy Towns\nIt’s been a busy, busy summer for Banteer Tidys Towns and the good weather made it possible to continue the twice weekly meetings and thanks to all who helped.\nThe Tidy Towns group is awaiting this year’s report from the National Tidy Towns competition on 24th October.\nRás Tailteann\nRás Tailteann 2026 will include a stage that will finish in Banteer on Thursday 21st May–more details to follow and will need a local organising group to help.\nStudents hosting HOPE foundation fundraiser\nColasite Treasa students Jerry Murphy, Daniel Vaughan Charlie Daly, Emily Sheehy and Fionn Crowley, all from the Banteer Kanturk/Dromagh area, are hosting a Monster bingo in aid of the Hope Foundation in the Edel Quinn Hall on 28th September at 2.30pm.

These facilities are here for everyone in the community to enjoy, and they must be respected.\nPlease remember–The bin is for cans and bottles only.
