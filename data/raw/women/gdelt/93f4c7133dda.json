  "body_text": "Chairman and Founder, Fly Multi-Company Limited, Kashif Bolarinwa, shares with FATTEH HAMID how he lost all he worked for in a day and had to start all over again\nWhat is the nature of your business?\nI’m an entrepreneur, I do business of all kinds; let me use the youthful term that I’m a hustler (laughs). My type of hustling is that I don’t just jump into all kinds of business. I believe that when everybody is digging for gold, you better be selling diggers. Majority of my business depends on what you need at that moment. Don’t just wake up and jump into any kind of business.\nWhat exactly is the drive that pushes you?\nMy drive is actually very funny. My driving force is that growing up in Orogun, Ibadan, there were some women you would see on bikes with their children on their backs; the pregnant women and all that on bikes. I felt it was very improper. All these made me to believe that I needed to make money. I will not be able to withstand seeing my wife going through all that with my child on a bike. It’s funny but it was like that growing up. Right from then, I’ve been engaged in different businesses. When I was even in the secondary school, I sold foolscap sheets to my colleagues. Most of them didn’t have it, but I usually had a new one to sell. The need to proffer solutions to my immediate needs has been my drive before some other things started coming up.\nWill you say that what you are today was what you dreamt of becoming while you were growing up?\nMy dream growing up was not to have this much. I just wanted the money that will solve my problems like I earlier said. Now, growing into the economy, you’ll realise that you have to look out for more people. That’s why I let my employees know that if you keep working well, you’ll provide a job for somebody else. This is because you won’t want to open another branch if one branch is not doing well; you do not have the power to find a job for someone nor do I have the power to hire alone. So, growing into the economy, I understand that I cannot just be comfortable with myself; I still need to make provision for others.\nAt what point in your career did you lose everything you had worked so hard for?\nYes! It was when I was selling clothes. As I said earlier, if everybody is digging for gold, you better be selling diggers. You’ll probably be richer. The trend then among the youth was to wear trendy clothes. So, it was a perfect business for me in a school environment. Then, I had a connection in Italy where I was buying my goods. Then, the transportation of goods was through a ship. There came a time when I got a discounted amount of goods from my suppliers and I put in all of my profits and capital together to ship in new goods so as to rake in more money after sales. After I did that, I was expecting my goods and then, I was contacted that the ship bringing in the goods capsized. It was an experience I seriously learnt from and I had to start all over again from the bottom. The great lesson I learnt from that is never to put all my eggs in one basket. That is why you see today that I have business in different sectors, from fitness solutions, to agriculture, real estate, etcetera. It is never to have myself in such a situation again.\nYou said you lost everything that you had. How much did you lose when the ship capsized?\nYes, it was everything that I had that was lost because even the profit that I made from the business was invested in that set of goods lost when the ship capsized. On the amount, I won’t want to let that out there but it ran into millions of naira.\nHow did you feel about what happened?\nNothing! I believed that what happened had happened and I had to get up and forge ahead. At that time, I couldn’t point to anyone as my mentor; I could say listening to music was my source of inspiration because at times, my drive comes from words I get in the music that I listen to. There is this song by Cardi B, ‘Get up’. When you fall down, get up. You keep falling and you keep rising. I like music that makes sense and not rubbish. All those things are things that are meant to happen to you already. I’m not the one to show emotions, even when my first child came, I was just there and was like, “what’s the big deal?” but people were like, “guy, you’re not even happy, not even crying.” I really don’t have to be too emotional. I do not transfer aggression. It had happened. I don’t want to keep dwelling on the loss.\nWhen I got married, at the early stage, I did have issues with my wife because she would complain when the air conditioner was not working. However, she later understood gradually that we did not need to sit; we needed to look for a solution. The numbers of all the service providers are on the phone at home. Instead of telling me, what have you done when it happened? Have you called the person who’ll fix it because I’m not the one to do that? However, when the ship was said to have capsized, I later gathered N50,000 to buy a photocopying machine to start a photocopy business inside The Polytechnic Ibadan that year.\nWhat did that feel like for someone who was worth millions and had to start a photocopying business?\nI was the only one who knew what I was worth. To others, I wasn’t worth millions. And I wasn’t sad about the loss because it was nothing to me. I believe it had been predestined to happen and the only thing was to look for solutions. I’m not someone that sees all of that, or feels that the business was small because I used to have millions. I was the only one that knew what I was up to. When I started serving at Asaba, I was a cleaner and I had businesses running in Ibadan. I never cared about those things. I did a labourer’s job at a time in my life; my dad didn’t know about all these. I also worked as a BRT conductor; I did dirty jobs. Starting with that photocopy business was nothing to me. That’s not the end of the world.\nThere was a time you mentioned on Twitter that you started farming while you were in school. How did that come to be?\nIt was when I was at The Polytechnic Ibadan. I started with the photocopy business in the house from which I gathered money and within a few weeks, I went to get a shop in the southern part of Poly Ibadan. From there, I was doing projects for my seniors, school fees payment with phone and printing it out with someone else. The business was doing quite well and from that, I got an acre of land behind the school at Akufo where I started farming.\nWhat were the plants you were cultivating when you started farming at Akufo?\nI was more of a business person than a farmer. It was my dad that was in charge. He was the one who knew more about farming. He studied Agronomy at the University of Ibadan. We farmed vegetables, maize, cassava, etc. Instead of having weeds all over, we were planting ewedu and some other veggies, while the major crops were growing. Once sold, the money from the ewedu was used to maintain the corn and cassava.\nAt what point did everything become better again?\nHonestly, it wasn’t anything for me. I felt nothing. I just felt like I could do whatever I liked to get myself up there again. When I started photocopying, I was making a lot of money. I helped people to do their photocopying work. At the polytechnic, my relationship with people was good. I played football as well. I was quite very popular. People came around. I did whatever I liked and I was even able to open two more shops. I can remember that the business grew so much after my expansion that I usually made more than N100,000 daily.\nWhen you finished school and you also had your farm, was it immediately you left for National Youth Service or you were doing something?\nYes, I went for my National Youth Service immediately.\nYou mentioned that when you went for service, you were doing a part-time job as a dry cleaner. How was that convenient for you as a corps member?\nI was always at home; I hated being idle and felt like doing something. So, I went looking for a job and I did the dry-cleaning job.\nAt that time, you said you still had businesses in Ibadan, what businesses were they?\nI still had the shops, I did not give them out at that time and the farm was also running, which also gave me money. Also, my brother was selling jewellery at the Ogunpa Market. I gave some jewellery to him to sell and he gave me money too.\nA lot of youths today believe that to get up there in the world, they have to do something illegal. What would you say to that?\nWell, it’s obvious that it worked for a lot of people, and didn’t work for others also. It probably could as well work for some of us that do not want to do it. My only reason for not engaging in this act was that I was the Imam at the mosque in my area in Ibadan. I was the one that led all prayers. Even, there were issues that came to me as the Imam. It was through that I understood what life after life was all about; the hereafter is very important. Till this moment, there are things I can do, but I’d rather respect my parents and not do anything that will annoy them. The major thing I think a lot of youths should do is to understand money management. Even if you get money every day, if you can’t manage it, it will still be nothing.\nAt this level of your career, what gives you the utmost happiness?\nRight now, it is to be able to do whatever I want to do, buy whatever I want, etc, because, Alhamdulillah (I thank God), I have kids. My utmost joy is when I have the ability to do whatever I want to do.\nYou are known on social media to talk about women’s rights. Are you a feminist?\nWell, not exactly, I wouldn’t say that I’m a feminist but I believe more in taking care of women than men.\nAt what point did you feel like giving up?\nI don’t think like that; I’m a very self-motivating person. When something happens, I look for a solution immediately and God has always helped my decisions. May Almighty Allah bless my dad; he has helped to instil many virtues which helped me today. My wife that I have known for some years and married eight years later, that’s my kind of person. I never knew that I would marry her. I’ve always liked her. The truth is that I don’t always give up.\nWith all of these experiences, will you say that you are fulfilled?\nNo, I’m not fulfilled. I’ve not made it in life yet. Yes, I’m happy that I’m fulfilled to a large per centage but not up to 100 per cent. We have a lot of things in life besides financial life. There’s the spiritual life; there’s emotional life and there is psychological life, etcetera. I’m not fulfilled with my spiritual life for example. So, I’m not fulfilled. There’s still a lot more to do, a lot more to learn about life.\nCan you remember the time you made your first million naira and what it was like?\nThat was a long time ago before the loss to the capsized ship. Honestly, I didn’t feel anyhow. I was only concerned with money management. If you can make N10,000, then you can make more and gradually.\nThe fact that you were not married as a young man who had money, how were you able to fend off attraction from women?\nI was busy with my life, honestly. It takes a lot to become a man, and I was engrossed with that. It was later that I married my wife who was studying at the University of Ilorin at the time.\nWhat was it like growing up with your parents? Were you born with a silver spoon in your mouth?\nWe had all that we needed, most importantly education. However, it was all a matter of time before my parents made a mistake that made us lose everything and that mistake has been a part of my drive that has pushed me this much in life. It was when I also understood that I needed to make it.\nCan you remember the mistake your parents made?\nWe were living in an area and we had our shop in a place, and our business was moving very well. We were living an extremely comfortable life. We now moved from the place where we had it all to another area and we moved the shop too and everything became different. We lost all of that. The lesson I picked from it was that the moment you want to change your environment, be sure that your current environment is enough to sustain you to do that and whatever you can do with your next life, make sure that the immediate life must be well grounded and do well before you move and lose. You don’t just jump into something new without having experience or knowledge about it or what it looks like. I always take my time to decide financially etc. So, one will not make a mistake and fall off.\nHave you had any experience that was so painful and forced you to work towards making a change in your life?\nI went to a bricklayer’s place to work and was paid N1, 500. When I was coming back, I met a friend who is now a naval officer. She met me and told me that she needed N1,500 to buy the scratch card to check her offer with the Navy. Without hesitation, I gave her the N1,500 I went to work so hard for. When I got home, I was very hungry and my mum said that there was no food. That night, I still have the picture on my Twitter; I felt terribly bad and felt pity for myself. That was unlike now that I need to get money for people; the goal in those days was the need to get money to eat.",
