Ashton Gillotte, DE, Louisville\nGillotte is a candidate to vault up these rankings with another tremendous season. Last year, he helped lead the Cardinals past Notre Dame and into the ACC title game. He recorded 14.5 tackles for loss and finished in the top 10 in the sport in sacks with 11 in 2023. Fewer programs and cities have learned to promote their talent as well as Louisville, who gave the world Muhammad Ali and Lamar Jackson nearly 60 years apart.\nReported NIL deals: N/A\nSocial media following: 4.7K (Instagram), 3.4K (X)\nHeisman Trophy odds: N/A\n—Cardinal football commit Antonio Harris is starring on both sides of the ball for Male High this season.\n—The CJ looks at the five toughest defenses the Cards will face in 2024.\n—Eric Crawford has 12 thoughts on the start of the college football season.\n—Georgia Tech’s social media team was ready for the moment.\n—The CJ has a gallery of the best images from the first Friday night of the high school football season.\n—The Louisville women’s soccer team toppled Northern Kentucky, 2-1, on Sunday. With the women off to a 3-0-1 start and the men sitting at 1-0-0, U of L sports are still undefeated in the 2024-25 athletics season.\n—Two-time MVP Lamar Jackson is still somehow apparently not a tier 1 quarterback in the NFL.\nJackson surged to the brink of Tier 1 with more top-tier votes this year (23) than he commanded over the previous three combined (20).\n“He’s a fantastic dual-threat guy, he’s explosive, he’s dangerous,” an offensive coach said. “This past year, with (new Ravens offensive coordinator Todd) Monken, I thought he took a big step and became a passer. To me, it was so different from the previous years.”\nThe line between being a good passer and expertly handling pure-pass situations like Baltimore faced while trailing Kansas City in the playoffs is what kept Jackson a few votes away from joining Mahomes, Burrow and Allen in the top group.\nFor some, Jackson transcends the criteria.\n“I just think putting an MVP of this league in Tier 2 is being on some quarterback high horse of what we think it’s supposed to look like,” a voter who placed Jackson in Tier 1 said.\nFaring better in the playoffs, where he has a career 75.7 passer rating and a 2-4 record despite strong defensive support, might push Jackson over the top.\n“He’s a 1 with limitations for me,” a defensive coordinator said. “You can win a lot of games with him. When you watched it against Kansas City, he can’t pass when he has to. That is still true. But he is still a wonderful football player.”\n—You can vote for Louisville commit Jordan Allen as Gwinnett Player of the Week right here.\n—This model gives Louisville a 12% chance to make the College Football Playoff.\n—Jamari Thrash: Still very good at catching touchdown passes.

Tyler Shough, Louisville, 6-5/225, 7th-Year Sr., 20 career FBS starts (13-7 record)\nPFF National Rank: #56\nHigh School: 4-star prospect from Chandler (Ariz.) Hamilton\nRecruitment: enrolled in 2024 as transfer (Texas Tech/Oregon)\nOffensive Coordinator: Brian Brohm, second season (first with Shough)\n2020: 106-167 passing (63.5%), 1,559 yards, 13/6 TD/INT; 66-271 rushing (2 TDs)\n2022: 106-177 passing (59.9%), 1,304 yards, 7/4 TD/INT; 72-269 rushing (4 TDs)\n2023: 67-111 passing (60.4%), 746 yards, 7/4 TD/INT; 48-149 rushing (2 TDs)\nLouisville head coach Jeff Brohm on Shough: “We really like Tyler. He’s come in and done a great job. What you’re getting with Tyler is a young man with great experience, He’s been through ups and downs. He’s had setbacks and failures and success. He knows how to handle it, and that’s very, very valuable to a quarterback, especially that position. Has he had a few injuries? Yes, he has. Has it cost him a little bit? Yes, it has. At the same time, they were injuries you can recover from, and right now he’s doing well. He’s been a great leader, and he can really throw the football.”\nPFF College: “Former Oregon and Texas Tech quarterback Tyler Shough is currently the biggest question mark on a very good Louisville roster. His career has been marred by injuries, as he has never made 200 pass attempts in a single season. He’s shown flashes of potential for a long time when he is on the field, but his health and ball security could loom over the Cardinals’ chances of ACC contention.”\n—Top 30 hoops recruit Shelton Henderson recapped his weekend visit to Louisville here ($$).\n—There are two new game day experiences that will be offered at L&N Stadium this season.\n—The latest episode of the From the Pink Seats Podcast is here.\n—Good by me.\n—Jeff Walz has offered class of 2027 guard Bella Owumi.\n—Matt McGavic looks at how the results of week zero impacted Louisville.\n—And finally, The Mike Rutherford Show (presented by United Mechanical) kicks off game week this afternoon from 3-6 on 1450 The Big X.
