In the end I got it and it was the most beautiful thing that has happened in my career,' Messi said of his World Cup win as he collected his award.\n'It is a dream for every footballer but something that very few can make come true,' added Messi, who was sat in the Paris theatre in between Mbappe and his wife Antonella Roccuzzo.\nPhoto: AFP He took the prize just 24 hours after combining with Mbappe to lead PSG to a 3-0 win against Marseille in Ligue 1.\nThe 35-year-old, a seven-time Ballon d'Or winner, succeeds Polish star Robert Lewandowski on the FIFA honours list, while Putellas retained the women's prize despite spending the second half of last year out injured.\nPhoto: AFP The 29-year-old beat England's European Championship-winning striker Beth Mead and United States star Alex Morgan to add the FIFA crown to the Ballon d'Or, which she has also won two years running.\nPutellas is currently recovering from a serious knee injury suffered last July which ruled her out of the Euro in England with Spain.\nPrior to that she had scored 11 goals on Barcelona's run to the Champions League final, which they lost to Lyon.\nPutellas has previously said she hopes to return from injury in time to play again this season, but it remains to be seen whether she will feature for Spain at the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in July and August.\nArgentina's World Cup win in Qatar was also recognised as Lionel Scaloni claimed the men's coach's honour and Emiliano Martinez was named the best male goalkeeper.\nMeanwhile, England's European Championship victory helped their Dutch manager Sarina Wiegman win the prize for best women's coach, while Mary Earps was named the women's goalkeeper of the year.\nPolish amputee player Marcin Oleksy took the Puskas Award for best goal, named after Hungary great Ferenc Puskas.\nALSO READ:\nwatch: messi scores 700th club goal as assist to mbappe becomes talking point in psg win\nmessi, mbappe up for fifa best award\nwatch: messi's freekick earns psg a hard-fought win as mbappe, neymar shine",
