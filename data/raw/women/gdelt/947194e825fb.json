The Spanish winger proved a much-needed creative spark, though the Reds were narrowly pipped to silverware by the Blues in a 1-0 defeat.\nHer first contribution came in a 3-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur on 7 May, when she entered the fray in the final 15 minutes to help see out a comprehensive victory for the Reds.\nGarcia was also called upon in the FA Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley, where we made our maiden appearance. The Spanish winger proved a much-needed creative spark, though the Reds were narrowly pipped to silverware by the Blues in a 1-0 defeat.\nWith the disappointment of Wembley providing the fuel to finish our league campaign on a high, we faced local rivals Man City at home in our penultimate WSL encounter this term.\nLucia was called from the bench with the game still at 1-1, and entered the fray alongside forward-thinking midfielder Boe Risa. The Reds have shown a real never-say-die attitude this season, with several last-minute winners, and the derby proved no different.\nJust moments after Le Tissier made a goal-saving block to deny Khadija ‘Bunny’ Shaw, the Reds went to the other end of the pitch and found the winner. Boe Risa was on hand to head Hannah Blundell’s delivery back across goal, where Garcia thumped home to secure our first-ever victory over City in the league.\nLucia was called from the bench with the game still at 1-1, and entered the fray alongside forward-thinking midfielder Boe Risa.

Marc Skinner's side needed a favour from Reading to beat Chelsea and give us a chance at lifting a first-ever WSL title, but we had to get our job done first.\nFor the fourth time in May, Garcia was brought on when we were in search of a goal and mere minutes into her introduction, that is exactly what she provided. Latching onto a sublime ball over the top from Le Tissier, she volleyed home at the second time of asking, scoring the only strike of the game.\nWhile Chelsea went on to win the league by beating Reading, United Women still gave our incredible away fans plenty to cheer about thanks to Garcia’s clinical edge.\nCongratulations, Lucia, and thank you to everyone who voted.\nFor the fourth time in May, Garcia was brought on when we were in search of a goal and mere minutes into her introduction, that is exactly what she provided.
