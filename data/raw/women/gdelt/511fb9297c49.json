  "body_text": "FeatureWe Love You Liverpool: Meet Official LFC Supporters Club... Thessaloniki\nLiverpool FC has more than 300 Official LFC Supporters Clubs (OLSCs) across 100 countries worldwide.\nThe Reds’ fanbase is famous for its passion and loyalty, cheering on both the men’s and women’s squads whether on Merseyside or watching from afar.\nOur We Love You Liverpool feature aims to bring supporters closer together to learn more about each other wherever they are based around the globe.\nWhether in the UK and Republic of Ireland, on Merseyside itself, in North or South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia or elsewhere, fans provide the very foundations that the club is built on.\nHere, we meet OLSC Thessaloniki...\nTell us about the OLSC…\nBack in 1995 a group of friends met and decided to create this special supporters club. They wanted to share their love and passion for the Reds. So, this is how our journey began. This season our OLSC counted 330 members and the season we won the Premier League it was a record of 510 members.\nHow special is it to have the supporters club where you are?\nIt is very special, unique and we really love every second of what we are doing. Liverpool FC is very popular in Greece and is one of the most-supported international football clubs in our country and definitely is the most-supported club in the Premier League. OLSC Thessaloniki is the biggest supporters club of any international football club in Greece.\nIt must give you a sense of community and connection to Liverpool and the club itself?\nOf course, there is a sense of community and connection to Liverpool FC and the city of Liverpool. We act like a family and our premises is our second home for all of our members. LFC supporters all over the world, when they visit Thessaloniki, they find us and join us for matches. So, it has helped us create new friends worldwide. That’s very special!\nWhat is so special about supporting Liverpool for your members?\nThe chance to travel to Liverpool and watch the Reds and sing You’ll Never Walk Alone at Anfield. Our matchdays at our very own premises are so special too. We really look forward to every matchday to see each other, sing and celebrate together for LFC.\nDo you hold meet-ups for games, or any special events throughout the year?\nAs I mentioned above, we are renting a place in a very central location of Thessaloniki, which is open only on LFC matchdays. We watch games together all season long. Moreover, we organise some special events, usually around Christmas and at the end of the season. We also run a football team, so we organise games often.\nHas the OLSC ever visited Anfield?\nOur OLSC has been to Anfield many times. A trip to Anfield to watch the Reds live is so special for many people and is actually a huge dream for a lot of our members. We try every season to get more and more people to watch LFC at least once and experience the atmosphere of Anfield.\nWhat is your favourite memory together as an OLSC?\nThe Madrid final was unforgettable. More than 800 fans came to our premises to watch the Champions League final. The road outside was closed due to the crowd. We had 10 screens inside and outside the premises, so everyone could watch Jordan Henderson lift the trophy.\nAnother special moment was back in 2005 when 116 members of our branch travelled to neighbouring Istanbul by three buses to watch the most epic Champions League final ever.\nHow to join\nWe have our website (https://lfc.gr/el/) where people can find all the details about our OLSC and how to become a member. We also run Facebook and Instagram pages, where we post regular updates.\nOLSC info\nName: OLSC Thessaloniki\nLocation: Thessaloniki\nWebsite: https://lfc.gr/el/\nFacebook: OLSC Thessaloniki\nInstagram: OLSC Thessaloniki",
