A website might have a chatbot introduce themselves as Dave, for example — and the user may not realize Dave isn’t a real person.\nFrom farm to flyer: global pressures on groceries\nOver the past year, the CEOs of Canada’s biggest grocery chains have become familiar faces to lawmakers studying food prices.\nExecutives have faced questions from MPs and battled accusations of profiteering as their earnings rise.\nBut experts say the main factors that have driven grocery prices up over the past couple of years are global.\n“The supply chains we have depended on for many decades now have come under massive stresses over the last five years — COVID, conflict, climate change being the most notable examples of big global macro stresses — and that is translated into broad-based inflation for all goods across the global economy,” said Evan Fraser, director of the Arrell Food Institute at the University of Guelph.\nConsumers are acutely aware of increases in food costs because other costs, especially housing, are also skyrocketing, said Fraser, and so food prices have become emblematic of a wider problem.\nPolice chief’s apology missing key pieces: experts\nA southwestern Ontario police chief’s apology this week for the time it took to lay sexual assault charges against five professional hockey players marked an important step in acknowledging harm but lacked key elements needed to demonstrate full accountability and rebuild trust, experts say.\nIn a news conference that drew national attention Monday, London, Ont., police Chief Thai Truong apologized to a complainant and her family on behalf of the force for taking nearly six years to charge five then-members of Canada’s 2018 world junior hockey team.\nShannon Moore, a professor at Brock University whose research focuses on restorative justice and trauma-informed policy, practice and pedagogy, says while the chief did well to acknowledge the delay and that the harm it caused goes “far beyond” the complainant, and appeared sincere in expressing his regret, “there are many more pieces that are needed” in order to help repair some of the harm done.\nAn effective apology needs to reflect the “whole truth of the harm caused,” and that goes beyond just the time it took to lay charges, Moore said. “It’s also what happened to just lead to this delay – what actions weren’t taken, which actions were taken.”\nProgressive groups excluded from Chinatown parade\nProgressive and LGBTQ+ groups say they’ve been excluded from Vancouver’s Lunar New Year parade in Chinatown this weekend, with one of their representatives saying they were told it was because of a ban on “political activism.”\nChinatown Together, organized by community activist Melody Ma, and LGBTQ+ group Lunar New Year For All say their applications to march in the Spring Festival Parade on Sunday were rejected by the committee that runs the event.\nThe parade marks the year of the dragon, which starts on Saturday.\nMa posted a letter on social media that she says came from the parade’s organizers, telling her that approval of Chinatown Together’s participation had been rescinded because “political activism finds no place within the spirit of the event.”\nThe letter dated Feb. 3 says the parade is “dedicated to a sense of unity” and is intentionally distanced from religious or political affiliations.\nCanadian brands hope to score with Swift fans\nMost Canadian companies locked in their Super Bowl ad space long before anyone knew the Kansas City Chiefs would make it to the final match, but experts say many of those brands will be looking to score big with the audience drawn in by the team’s most famous fan: Taylor Swift.\nThe American pop star has been in the spotlight at Kansas City’s NFL games since she first cheered on her tight end boyfriend Travis Kelce against the Chicago Bears in September. Many of her fans have since become rabid football watchers, attributing Swift with getting them into the game.\nThose fans represent a lucrative opportunity for brands to branch out beyond their typical targets — men between the ages of 18 and 35 — and reach tween, teen, Gen Z and millennial women, who tend to drive most decisions around which goods households buy, marketing experts say.\n—\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 9, 2024\nThe Canadian Press",
