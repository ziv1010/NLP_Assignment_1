  "body_text": "Newcastle United Women draw with Manchester City but not enough to save manager’s job\nNewcastle United Women headed into their League Cup clash with top tier side Manchester City, shooting in the last chance saloon of staying in the competition, after losing away to Nottingham Forest in their opening group game.\nWith league games coming thick and fast it allowed manager Becky Langley the option of rotating her squad and giving minutes to some of her players who perhaps hadn’t featured in recent games.\nClaudia Moan got a recall in goal, with Małgorzata Grec making her first home start in defence. Charlotte Wardlaw also returned to the line-up, albeit in an unfamiliar right back role, with Elyssia Boddy coming into the midfield and Freya Gregory into the attack.\nThere were 3,012 fans inside Gateshead International Stadium.\nWith the stand on the far side used for the first time to house the two coachloads of visiting supporters.\nMatch Report\nManchester City arrived on Sunday as one of the top four sides in the country, with a wealth of talent from around the world and on a seven game winning streak across all competitions.\nNone of that made a difference though when Newcastle took a shock lead 11 minutes in. Having applied some early pressure they forced City onto the back foot and were able to create chances.\nMan City’s England goalie Khiara Keating was forced into tipping a Jordan Nobbs effort around the post after a defensive giveaway before she stood no chance two minutes later when Lois Joel let fly from distance for the second weekend running. A stunning 25 yard effort found the top corner of the net after stealing possession back.\nIt could have been 2-0 soon after but Emily Murphy wasted a great opportunity to play in Freya Gregory on the left for a simple tap-in, instead going herself and shooting straight at Keating.\nA frustrating first half for Man City saw Spanish World Cup winner Leila Ouahabi slice a volley wide with the goal gaping, after an excellent team move on the counter attack involving Bunny Shaw. Before Aoba Fujino, who looked the most creative for the visitors, hit the bar after another incisive run into the box five minutes later.\nBut as half time approached teenage sensation Iman Beney took over for Man City. She’d scored in each of the previous two matches against Arsenal and Liverpool and it was her tenacity that created the equaliser for Laura Coombs, as she managed to wriggle free of Demi Stokes’ attentions down the right. It would be the last kick of the half.\nBeney would repeat the trick early in the second half with a clever reverse ball through a crowd of bodies finding Japan International Yui Hasegawa to rifle home from a tight angle for Man City’s first lead of the game.\nNewcastle continued to battle with Małgorzata Grec great throughout. She kept WSL top scorer Bunny Shaw quiet in an interesting subplot throughout the game. Shaw only got behind the Polish defender once and even then Grec recovered well to get across her opponent before she advanced on goal.\nBut a third Man City goal arrived from a corner soon after, as Claudia Moan’s punch looped into the air, allowing Gracie Prior to bundle the ball over the line through a crowd of bodies.\nThe visitors were able to introduce such quality players as England Lioness Alex Greenwood and Dutch Euro winner Vivianne Miedema from the bench. The latter was unable to get into the game thanks to Newcastle’s disciplined defending. The only moment of note was when the former Arsenal forward threw herself to the ground to win a free kick, which was easily dealt with.\nDespite having to cope with Man City dominating possession, Newcastle were keeping their opponents on their toes. Substitute Shania Hayles led a break before playing in Nobbs. But the former England International’s effort lacked the power to trouble Keating. She would get a second chance moments later after Keating could only punch a Gregory cross into her path on the edge of the area. But in persistent rain, Nobbs slipped and her volley narrowly cleared the bar.\nThe hosts did set up a nervy final ten minutes though as the rain continued to lash down. Freya Gregory fired a vicious dipping effort from wide on the left, in off the far post. It was the winger’s first goal of the season and she did well to take on Kerstin Casparij in the build-up before unleashing her powerful effort.\nAs the game entered into just two minutes of stoppage time, Emily Murphy’s long range effort was heading wide before it hit Hayles who was able to steer it into the net for an incredible late equaliser.\nWith this being a League Cup game, both teams receive a point before taking part in a shootout to determine which side would collect the additional one. The Lasses opted to go first with Shania Hayles, Aoife Mannion, Beth Lumsden, Emily Murphy and Jordan Nobbs all finding the net.\nWhile for Man City, we watched on as Kirsten Casparij, Yui Hasegawa and Vivianne Miedema all scored with ease, whilst United goalie Claudia Moan got a hand to each of Bunny Shaw and Alex Greenwood’s efforts but couldn’t prevent them converting their spot-kicks. She would then push Leila Ouahabi’s shot onto the post but was unable to prevent it crossing the line.\nInto sudden death and Freya Gregory dispatched her penalty with confidence as the shot went bar down and in. But when Keating dived to her left to save Demi Stokes’ effort in round seven of the shootout, it was left to Laura Blinkilde-Brown to step up and seal the bonus point for the visitors.\nThe outcome of the shootout was irrelevant. Newcastle had just matched one of the best sides in the country.\nNewcastle United: Claudia Moan, Charlotte Wardlaw, Aoife Mannion, Małgorzata Grec, Demi Stokes (c), Lois Joel (Deanna Cooper 75), Jordan Nobbs, Elysia Boddy (Shania Hayles 59), Oona Sevenius (Beth Lumsden 75), Emily Murphy, Freya Gregory.\nSubs not used: Femke Liefting, Ava Chapman, Lucy Gilbert, Abbie Richardson, Ella Baker, Amelia Freeman\nManchester City: Khiara Keating, Naomi Layzell (Kerstin Casparij 75’), Gracie Prior, Jade Rose (Alex Greenwood 64’), Leila Ouahabi, Iman Beney, Sydney Lohmann (Laura Blindkilde Brown 64’), Yui Hasegawa, Laura Coombs (C), Aoba Fujino (Vivianne Miedema 64’), Bunny Shaw.\nSubs not used: Eartha Cumings, Laura Wienroither, Codie Thomas, Amelia Oldroyd, Millie Burdon.\nWhere that leaves Newcastle United Women\nThe shootout defeat means Newcastle are at the bottom of their cup group with just a single point. Man City move on to five points and are top after Everton and Nottingham Forest played out a 1-1 draw, before the Toffees earned the extra point. Man City will advance by winning the group if they avoid defeat in their final game at Field Mill. While Newcastle’s final game will be at home to Everton in five weeks’ time, with both sides already mathematically eliminated.\nUnited midfielder Morgan Gautrat has been nominated for the Barclays Women’s Super League 2 Player of the Month award for October. The American international scored with a late goal directly from a corner in the 2-2 draw at Crystal Palace. The double World Cup winner is shortlisted for the prize alongside Jodie Hutton of Charlton Athletic, Catriona Sheppard of Durham and Jess Simpson of Southampton.\nThe Lasses’ Lois Joel has also been shortlisted for the Barclays Women’s Super League 2 October Goal of the Month award. The Wales international’s sensational strike rescued a point for the Magpies in their 2-2 draw with Bristol City earlier this month, and earned her a nomination for the monthly award. She is nominated alongside Jodie Hutton of Charlton Athletic, Georgie Freeland of Portsmouth, Hollie Olding and Chantelle Boye-Hlorkah of Nottingham Forest and Vicky Losada of Bristol City.\nWhat’s coming up\nIncredibly, the following day after drawing with Man City, Newcastle announced they were parting company with manager Becky Langley. No reason was given for the decision, however, it is believed that the slow start to the league campaign and the team finding themselves ninth of twelve after half a dozen second tier matches was behind it.\nEither way, it is sad to see a likeable person who brought passion to the role depart, especially after what was perhaps the most significant result in the club’s history.\nAn interim coaching structure will be put in place while a successor is appointed. Although there shouldn’t be a shortage of takers for what is one of the biggest jobs in women’s football.\nWith the Lasses now on International Break, there are two weeks before the next league game away to Ipswich Town. Hopefully a new manager will arrive ASAP to take charge.\nIf you would like to feature on The Mag, submit your article to contribute@themag.co.uk",
