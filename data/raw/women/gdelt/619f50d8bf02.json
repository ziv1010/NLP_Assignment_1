  "body_text": "Starling has teamed up with Small Business Britain, the UK’s leading champion of small businesses, to found a campaign to empower women across the UK to start and grow their businesses.\nLaunching in early 2026, the new partnership will feature a free training programme - 'Female Founder Fundamentals: the definitive guide to starting and growing your business' - comprising online masterclasses and peer-learning opportunities focused on building confidence, growth and financial skills.\nThe programme will also support mental resilience, financial wellbeing and community connection after joint research found that 60% of female founders struggle to switch off from work.\nThe partnership kicked off with an inspiring networking event at Emirates Stadium on Saturday 8th November, capitalising on Starling’s partnership with Arsenal and taking place ahead of their WSL match against Chelsea. Over 150 female entrepreneurs from across the country came together to celebrate women’s achievements in business and sport, enjoying a day of connection, learning and football.\n“There’s such incredible energy when women come together to celebrate success and support one another, whether in business or on the pitch,” said Michelle Ovens CBE, CEO and Founder of Small Business Britain.\n“This event with Starling at Arsenal Emirates Stadium was the perfect way to kick off our new partnership and to spotlight the confidence, community and ambition that drive female founders forward. Together, we’re building on that momentum with a new training programme to help even more women start and grow brilliant businesses.”\nEstablished female founders will lead the series of masterclasses, which are designed for women who have recently started their own businesses. Finance expert Faye Watts will lead ‘Accessing Finance & Investment’, helping participants understand funding options and strategies for sustainable growth, while web design expert Cheryl Laidlaw will deliver an ‘AI for Productivity’ masterclass, exploring how artificial intelligence can streamline operations, save time and support business expansion.\nSmall Business Britain and Starling’s partnership is rooted in recognition of the need for greater support for female founders, given their key role in leading many of the country’s 5.6 million small businesses. The new collaboration aims to deepen their economic impact by providing them with the skills and resources they need to grow thriving businesses.\n“It was fantastic to join Small Business Britain at Emirates Stadium, connecting with so many inspiring female founders. It was a powerful reminder of how important it is to create spaces where women feel seen, supported, and celebrated as they overcome barriers and grow their businesses,” said female founder Grace Graham, CEO of WorkSpa.\n“Initiatives like this new partnership with Starling are crucial, providing the training and resources women need to grow, lead, and thrive.”\nMichele Rousseau, Chief Marketing Officer at Starling, said: “Starling is proud to be a female-founded bank. We stand behind female founders who are driving innovation and growth across the UK. This partnership with Small Business Britain reflects our commitment to helping people be good with money, whether that’s through financial tools, skills development, or simply celebrating their achievements.”\nRecent UK Government research shows that women led 14% of SME employers in 2024, but that figure has been declining steadily over recent years.\nWomen make up around 30% of solopreneurs, indicating significant potential for female-led businesses to scale.\nIt has been estimated that if women started and scaled new businesses at the same rate as men, up to £250 billion could be added to the economy.\nThe partnership aims to boost the support available to female founders, particularly supporting more early-stage businesses to scale, and forms part of Small Business Britain’s mission to boost the number of female entrepreneurs leading SMEs to 30% by 2030.",
