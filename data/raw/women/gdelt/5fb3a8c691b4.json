  "body_text": "WHEELING, W.Va. (WV News) — After both sides agreed to it, Northern West Virginia U.S. District Judge John Preston Bailey has converted a 14-day temporary restraining order to a preliminary injunction in a case involving the NCAA’s transfer rule.\nThe preliminary injunction will last until the trial starts. The trial is to begin no sooner than “the last day of competition in the 2023-24 winter and spring sports seasons and sanctioned tournament play,” Bailey ruled.\nThe case revolves around the NCAA’s requirement that athletes sit out one academic year after transferring a second time, unless they receive a waiver.\nBailey’s ruling clears the way for athletes throughout the country who were waiting on a waiver ruling to participate in winter and spring sports.\nThe decision also comes as the transfer portal is open for FCS and FBS football (until Jan. 2), men’s soccer (until Dec. 19), women’s volleyball (until Jan. 1) and men’s water polo (until Dec. 25).\nTransfer windows are upcoming in several other sports.\nAttorneys general for Ohio, West Virginia, Colorado, Illinois, New York, North Carolina and Tennessee had joined in filing against the NCAA.\nWest Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey praised the ruling.\n“This is a great day for student athletes — they will finally be able to compete in the sport they love,” Morrisey said. “It’s the right thing to do, and I couldn’t be more pleased with the outcome.”\nIf the NCAA loses the case, it likely would result in college athletes being able to transfer without consequence throughout their five-year window to complete four athletic years of participation.\nBailey also called off a Dec. 27 hearing that would have addressed expanding the 14-day window he originally set.\nRaeQuan Battle, who transferred from Montana State to West Virginia University, was among those called to testify by the attorneys general in a hearing last week.\nYou must be logged in to react.
