Any win is, especially when you haven't had as many as you like,\" Stajcic said on Friday about the Macarthur victory.\n\"More importantly, the manner of the win was important to give that belief - to know that we can come from behind and to know that we can play more consistent football over a 90-minute period and produce a result with it.\n\"If we can keep building like that, there's no doubt that there's more improvement in results for us to come.\"\nPerth have notched two wins, two draws and five losses in the opening nine rounds.\nTheir opponents are faring little better, with the ninth-placed Mariners registering three wins, two draws and four losses.\nThe last time the sides met in round three Glory emerged with their first win of the season, while the Mariners were condemned to three straight defeats.\nAnd it was not without controversy.\nCentral Coast forward Angel Torres had been sent off for slapping Jacob Muir on the back of the head for attempting to block his running path during the 2-0 win at HBF Park.\nStill, Stajcic is wary of taking too much confidence out of their previous win.\n\"You just don't know what's gonna happen on the day - depends on how both teams come out,\" he said.\n\"They've had a good five-week stretch now where they were on the bottom of the ladder and moved themselves to the edge of the six .... but that doesn't mean that you win the next game.\n\"We're coming off a win as well, so I expect a tough game.\"\nAustralian Associated Press",
