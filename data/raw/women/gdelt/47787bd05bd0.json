She powered onto the ball, cut inside, stepped and plunged over with three defenders in her wake at the 62-minute mark.\nTeammates engulfed her because it was a show of something special in her longer-than-expected debut in Super W.\nSchool friends and family in the grandstand wreathed her in lolly leis after the match, a show of celebration in Pasifika culture.\nFlanker Carola Kreis looked every bit the picture of a hard-working openside flanker with hair and strapping tape everywhere, a reddening tag mark on the thigh and spent from workrate.\n“We dug deep. We always knew what the Fijian girls would bring and there were plenty of smaller bodies making key tackles on bigger ones out there,” Reds captain Cecilia Smith said.\n“Lori’s chat from fullback was excellent and you always know she’s going to make her cover tackles. Caitlin too defended really well and there were plenty of others.\n“Overall, we just had to be more clinical in the attacking 22. We had to come away with more points from the chances we had. There is a lot we can take out of that performance to build on for our next game.\n“I told Shalom to get in there (as first receiver) to have a run. We know what she can bring with a hard carry and she did.”\nFlanker Jemma Bemrose played 80 minutes on debut. American prop Charli Jacoby, No.8 Doreen Narokete, reserve flanker Lucy Thorpe, reserve utility back Ava Wereta and Sauaso also made debuts.\nWilks made several strong runs during her shortened stint, lock Deni Ross tackled stoutly and worked hard at set piece time and hooker Tiarna Molloy scored a try and supported the ball well in general play.\nCramer produced an early 50-22 with her shrewd kicking game and halfback Sarah Dougherty kept up the accuracy of her pass for 80 minutes.\nThe scrum was on the backfoot for long periods but the Reds still found a way to hang in the contest. The maul was a real strength and the penalty try awarded in the second half was because a Fijian pulled down an inevitable surge to the tryline.\n“There was a lot to like. We controlled the play for long periods, our maul was effective and we certainly put heart into our defence,” coach Grant Anderson said.\n“It’s great to be into the season, be back at Ballymore and see a debutant like Shalom be a shining light making a difference in attack.”\nDrua captain Karalaini Naisewa said her side’s ability to offload the football and constantly threaten the Reds’ line had stood out.\nHer side is searching for a three-peat, having been champions in their first two seasons in the competition.\n“Just our structure game, sticking to our structure and playing the Fijiana game – that is offloading and going forward,” she told Stan Sport.\n“Thank you to all the supporters back at home who have been cheering for us and supporting us all the way.”\nThe Reds travel to Perth to play the Western Force in Round Two on Saturday.\nFijian Drua 32 – Tries: Merewairita Neivosa 2, Ana Korovata, Vani Va’aga Arei, Sulita Waisega, Teresia Tinanivalu, Conversion: Luisa Tisolo\nDefeated\nQueensland Reds 21 – Tries: Tiarna Molloy, Shalom Sauaso, penalty try, Conversion: Lori Cramer 2\nHalf-time: 10-7 Fijian Drua.\nPAC – RUGBY LEAGUE: AAP PACNEWS SPORT: Mon 18 Mar 2024\nMoana Pasifika fight their way to victory over Western Force\nMoana Pasifika have held on for a 22-14 win over the Western Force at HBF Park.\nIt’s their first win over the WA-based franchise and their second of the season, improving on their tally from last year.\nKyren Taumoefolau extended the lead shortly afterwards before the hosts tried to mount a comeback.\nHowever, they struggled for discipline and execution, allowing the visitors to claim the win.\nThe Force were left to rue a series of missed opportunities early in the match.\nNo.8 Will Harris appeared set to score in the ninth minute after nice build-up play from flyhalf Ben Donaldson.\nBut instead of charging to the line, Harris dished off a somewhat wayward pass to Issak Fines-Leleiwasa, who dropped the ball while running at full pace.\nTwo minutes later, Donaldson unleashed a clearly-forward pass to snuff out another golden chance for the Force.\nMoana hooker Sama Malolo opened the scoring in the 17th minute when he barged over for a try.\nBut the Force produced some party tricks to get a try of their own four minutes later.\nWinger Chase Tiatia launched a chip kick as soon as he received the ball on the wing, and outside centre Bayley Kuenzle sprinted forward to collect the bouncing ball and race over.\nThe Force entered the match determined to fix up their ill-discipline, but the penalty count read 6-0 against them by the 25-minute mark.\nFlanker Carlo Tizzano was yellow carded in the 32nd minute for a dangerous tackle that resulted in a clash of heads with Moana fullback Danny Toala.\nThe visitors made the most of the numerical advantage, with former Wallabies prop Sekope Kepu barging over to give his team a 12-7 lead at half-time.\nThe deficit would have been even bigger had another former Wallaby – Christian Leali’ifano – not missed an easy penalty and conversion attempt.\nLeali’ifano made up for those misses by playing a key role in Moana’s next try early in the second half.\nThe 36-year-old sneaked into place to grab a long line-out, and he dished off a quick pass for winger Kyren Taumoefolau to run 50m untouched to the line, making it 19-7.\nThe gap was closed back to five points in the 61st minute when Tizzano crossed from a rolling maul and Donaldson – after missing two easy penalties – nailed the conversion.\nBut the Force’s victory hopes were sunk in the 72nd minute when substitute flyhalf William Havili nailed a 53m penalty, giving the visitors an eight-point buffer.\nThe Western Force suffered a blow before kick-off when star Wallabies recruit Nic White was ruled out with knee swelling.\nChiefs bounce back with big win over Fijian Drua\nThe Chiefs rediscovered their attacking verve to outclass the Fijian Drua 46-29 on Saturday and climb to third place on the Super Rugby Pacific standings.\nInspired by fly-half Damian McKenzie, the Chiefs scored six tries to four at home in Hamilton, pulling away in the second half after leading 24-17 at the interval.\nIt was a disappointing result for the Drua, who were coming off an upset of the Crusaders in Lautoka and were competitive early on, crossing twice through midfield back Iosefo Masi in the first 22 minutes.\nTheir intensity fell away against the Chiefs, whose sole loss in four rounds this season came last week, when they were stifled by the second-placed Queensland Reds.\nChiefs captain Luke Jacobson was pleased his game-breaking backline could deliver a reminder of what they’re capable of.\n“There were probably a few stages there where we got a bit too loose with ball in hand but it’s awesome when we can get some of those plays to come off – it’s pretty nice to watch,” he said.\nBoshier’s tenth-minute try opened the Chiefs’ account after Masi sprinted away for the opener.\nHe was followed over by scrumhalf Cortez Ratima and winger Daniel Rona, ensuring they went into the break with a seven-point lead.\nFrom here, the hosts kicked clear to secure the win.\nWinger Etene Nanai-Seturo crossed just after the break before Boshier’s second pushed the game out of reach for the Drua.\nThey scored two late tries but fullback Shaun Stevenson sealed the win when he regathered his chip and chase with nine minutes to go to score.\nIt lifts the Chiefs into third behind the Hurricanes and Queensland Reds whilst the Fijian Drua return home to prepare for the Waratahs.\nFlanker Kaylum Boshier crossed twice while McKenzie’s speed and awareness was at the heart of many attacking moments, complementing his 16 points with the boot",
