The Galician coach emphasised his belief that some of his players took their foot off the pedal last week in the Italian capital, and he consistently demanded ruthlessness in this return leg. He also emphasised that having a Clásico in between the Roma encounters had been a test, and that winning 'only' 1-0 against Real Madrid didn't suggest his team were under par. This proved it. Relentless, ruthless, successful and entertaining. Bring on the semi-finals.\nFrancesco Corda, Roma reporter\nRoma deserve credit for what they have been able to achieve as UEFA Women's Champions League debutants, but tonight at the Camp Nou they had to bow to the overwhelming power of Barcelona, who reached the semi-finals for the fifth season in a row. The 5-1 win testifies to the superiority of the Blaugrana: tonight, unlike the first leg at the Olimpico, they were really clinical. For Alessandro Spugna's Giallorosse and Serturini, there is nonetheless the satisfaction of having scored in a football temple and having been on an excellent journey.\nReaction\nJonatan Giráldez, Barcelona coach: \"That was one of the most concentrated and focused team performances for some time. It's great to be playing like this, a top match, in front of so many of our fans in this great stadium, and I'm pleased to have sealed our passage to the semi-finals.\"\nFridolina Rolfö, Barcelona defender and Player of the Match: \"We had to put on a big show because we knew that last week in Rome we could have done better. The crowd helped; they were singing from start to finish and they give us energy. I really felt that today and there's no question it helps.\"\nAlessandro Spugna, Roma coach: \"Barcelona are very good. They began the season as one of the favourites for this season. They are excellent all through their squad. Really good and they can go a lot further in this tournament. That means I'm not only very proud of how we've tested and pushed them across these two games but very proud of the road Roma have travelled in order to reach the quarter-finals for the first time.\"\nVicky Losada, Roma midfielder: \"We missed a few chances last week and we knew precisely how Barcelona would react. They are very strong, but we have big objectives left in our season. In fact, in a couple of days we have a massive match against Milan. It's already time to push this from our minds and concentrate on league business.\"\nKey stats\n- Barcelona have won each of their last 18 home Women’s Champions League matches, since a 1-0 defeat against Lyon in the quarter-finals in March 2018\n- Only one of Barcelona's last 58 Women’s Champions League matches has finished as a draw.\n- Roma became the first visiting team to score at the Camp Nou in the Women's Champions League this season.\nLine-ups\nBarcelona: Paños; Bronze, Paredes, León (Fernàndez 73), Rolfö (Rábano 80); Bonmatí, Walsh (Syrstad Engen 66), Guijarro; Graham Hansen, Oshoala (Geyse 66), Paralluelo (Vilamala 66)\nRoma: Ceasar; Bartoli (Di Guglielmo 55), Wenninger, Linari, Minami; Serturini, Giugliano, Losada (Greggi 46), Haavi (Glionna 54); Andressa Alves (Ciccotti 78), Giacinti (Kramžar 74)\nWhat's next?\nBarcelona will face Chelsea in the semi-finals on 22/23 and 29/30 April.
