It was their third piece of silverware for the year after securing the inaugural Charity Shield then the League Cup. The Magpies produced 120 goals in 21 games to finish the regular season with the best attacking record. Striker Bronte Peel took her game to another level, contributing 41 of those and it was no coincidence the goals dried up when illness ruled the 22-year-old out of the major semi-final against Olympic. Peel returned for the preliminary final but the Magpies' hopes of a maiden grand final showing ended in a heart-breaking 1-0 loss to Charlestown. Overall, it was an outstanding season for the Magpies. Coach Keelan Hamilton has stepped aside to spend more time with his young family. Assistant Joseph Wright has been confirmed as his replacement.\nOLYMPIC (2nd, 47pts)\nThey lost a couple of key players in the off-season and battled a string of goalkeeper injury setbacks, but, with a well-oiled group and some gritty performances built on defensive steel, Olympic secured a fourth straight grand final appearance. They conceded just 19 goals in 22 games before succumbing 3-2 to Azzurri in the championship decider. It was the second piece of silverware that got away from them, after having one hand on the premiership with two games to play only to lose 5-2 to a fired-up Broadmeadow at season's end. They didn't finish the season empty-handed, however, claiming the State Cup in July with a mostly youthful side. Craig Atkins says he is coaching on and expects to retain the majority of players.\nAZZURRI (3rd, 39pts, won grand final)\nThere were wholesale changes at Azzurri and key signings included Kirstyn Pearce and Ella Joyce plus the promotion of some rising talent from reserve grade. Where they would finish was a bit of an unknown and they produced mixed results before securing third by goal difference from Broadmeadow and hitting peak form in the finals. The acquisition of Jets pair Melina Ayres and Gema Simon weren't season-defining but definitely took Azzurri to another level and both played key roles as Charlestown claimed their first NPLW championship on Sunday night. Where the squad sits next year remains to be seen. Post grand final, coach Heath Whyte wanted to savour the moment but hoped the club would retain the bulk of a strong squad.\nBROADMEADOW (4th, 39 pts)\nIt was always going to be a tough act to follow after Magic claimed the premiership-championship double in 2023. Several key departures included coach Jake Curley and goalkeeper Alison Logue. Things appeared to be humming along OK until a run of losses in the third round had them at risk of missing finals for the first time since rejoining the competition in 2020. They lost a string of players through the season, including leading scorer Mercedes McNabb to the US college system in July, then coach Nima Nikfarjam controversially stood down with two games to play. They rallied and secured fourth place but could not go on with it. Jason Konjarski finished the season as coach in an interim capacity and has been appointed in the role for 2025 in a year that shapes as a rebuild.\nNEW LAMBTON (5th, 38pts)\nIt was a case of almost but not quite for the Eagles. A season of two halves, and almost two teams. The mid-season arrivals of A-League trio Cassidy Davis, Lauren Allan and Tessa Tamplin proved an expected turning point. Davis and Allan combined for 41 goals between them in 11 games. They were the form team leading into finals but fell short by one point, probably to the relief of the top-four sides. The club have confirmed Aaron Stedman is back at the helm again next season and player retention is expected to be high.\nADAMSTOWN (6th, 27pts)\nMartin Slade took the reins and had a young side playing a good style of football. No team took them lightly and if the club can keep the group together they will be a force to be reckoned with in the future. While they were inconsistent on the scoreboard, and leaked too many goals to be a top-four side, Adamstown produced some big performances, including beating Magic. Slade is coaching on and is looking for a couple of experienced players to fill key roles and complement his talented young group.\nWARNERS BAY (7th, 6pts)\nIt was another long year for the Panthers, who have had a roller-coaster ride in 10 seasons of women's premier league. Warners Bay, who have experienced being both top and bottom of the competition, will be replaced by Lake Macquarie next season. How many players transition across is not yet known but the Roosters are aiming for long-term success with a club full of strong juniors. A coach for Lake Macquarie is expected to be unveiled next week.\nMID COAST (8th, 3 pts)\nIt was another tough slog for a side who travels to Newcastle every second weekend to play. They were unable to field a reserve-grade team this year and depth proved a major issue as injuries mounted in the second half of the season. A young side who never gave up even when numbers dropped but the club's long-term viability in the competition has been brought into question.",
