Jane Alatoa stepped up to take the spot kick, and rifled the ball past Fidelma Watpore to give her side a crucial lead.\nHekari renewed their urgency on attack, creating more chances. The pick of the bunch coming from Michaelyne Butubu’s cutback to Kaipu in space in the Tafea penalty area. She was quickly robbed of the ball however, and a swift Tafea counter attack almost saw the debutants double their lead through Sine, who narrowly shot wide.\nHekari United’s persistence paid off with a equaliser on the stroke of half-time, after Elma Aiviji caught Butubu with a stray boot in the box. Hekari midfielder Phylis Pala brought her side level again, with her spot kick sent just out of reach of Nettie Kalsau.\nThe sides remained unchanged when play resumed, with coaches Robert Calvo and Ericson Komeng both opting to persevere with their starting elevens.\nDespite conceding at the end of the first half, Tafea started the second half the brighter of the two sides, looking to re-establish their lead.\nThe second half began similarly to how the first half ended: with a penalty, again won by Sine for Tafea FC, having been bunded over by Hekari defender Raynata Samuel after dancing down the left wing and cutting into Hekari’s penalty area.\nSine herself took the spot kick but was unable to restore her side’s lead, crashing her shot against the crossbar before the Hekari defence were able to scramble clear.\nHortance Kimit came close to putting Hekari in the lead for the first time in the match but Kalsau tipped her shot onto the crossbar and was able to quickly gather the rebound.\nEricson Komeng was the first to turn to his bench, bringing Anastasia Gunemba and Mavis Singara on for Nenny Elipas and Kimit respectively in the 65th minute. Robert Calvo followed suite two minutes later, replacing Rinneth Siri with Henriette Sangul.\nBoth sides continued to push, searching for what would have been a vital winning goal. Sine had a golden chance as the clock ticked over 90 but her lofted effort drifted agonisingly wide for Tafea.\nTafea FC: 1 (Jane ALATOA (P) 37’,)\nHekari United FC: 1 (Phylis PALA (P) 45+8’,)\nHT: 1-1\nContent Sourced from scoop.co.nz\nOriginal url",
