Efforts were made to improve the field, but the replacement patches of grass could not grow fast enough. The Football Ferns canceled the closed-door training match and then days later, the main event against Team Taiwan.\nThe safety concerns were valid. Female athletes have a two to three times higher risk of a dreaded knee injury — the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear — compared with their male counterparts. The reasons are multi-faceted: biomechanics, access to resources and hormones. The injury is devastating and season-ending, as rehabilitation takes about a year.\nUnfortunately, a sport such as soccer that requires the knee to twist and turn puts players at high risk of tearing this important ligament, which provides stability to the knee joint. Long-term, ACL tears can result in painful osteoarthritis which can then lead to knee replacement surgery, often at younger ages for athletes compared with the general population.\nFollowing this international embarrassment, would the Football Ferns ever come here again?\nDecades ago, in 1987, they did. In fact, Taiwan has a long history in women’s soccer. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when live sporting events were rare elsewhere, the Taipei Times covered the Taiwan Mulan Football League, a semi-professional women’s soccer league established in 2014.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Taiwan hosted several international tournaments that were precursors to the FIFA Women’s World Cup, which is now the premier event for women’s soccer.\nA German documentary, Das Wunder von Taipeh, told the story of a team from Bergisch Gladbach, Germany, that traveled to Taiwan to participate in one of those early tournaments in 1981. The team’s undefeated run at that event became the impetus for the German Football Association to establish a women’s national team.\nIn 2023, the FIFA Women’s World Cup was held in Australia and New Zealand, and was expanded to 32 teams. Team Taiwan had their best shot at participating in the event for the first time since the 1991 debut, due to an extra spot being available for an Asian country, as the cohosts automatically qualified. Team Taiwan missed two opportunities to qualify. Both losses came down to just one penalty kick.\nThe best hope for Team Taiwan to participate in the FIFA Women’s World Cup again would be in 2031, when the tournament would be expanded to 48 teams. Between now and then, women’s soccer in Taiwan needs to grow on many fronts. More international events are needed, and the appetite exists. Tickets for the Taiwan vs New Zealand match sold out before the cancelation, but first there needs to be more high-quality soccer fields.\nMuch of the finger-pointing for the grass fiasco has been in the direction of the CTFA. The upcoming launch of the Ministry of Sports is an encouraging sign of the rising value being placed on sports, including women’s soccer. Hopefully, the increased national investment would lead to fewer humiliating moments such as the one that saw a highly-ranked visiting team cancel a match. It could mark the beginning of more opportunities for sports development in Taiwan.\nDaphne I.

Chinese immigration officials allegedly informed her that her passport was “invalid” because she was “Chinese,” refusing to recognize her Indian citizenship and claiming Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet. Officials had insisted that Thongdok, an Indian-origin UK resident traveling for a conference, was not Indian despite her valid documents. India lodged a strong diplomatic protest, summoning the Chinese charge d’affaires in Delhi and demanding\nBy Dorjee Phunchu Dinglow\n-\nForeign-run domestic politics\n2026-02-08In the past 72 hours, US Senators Roger Wicker, Dan Sullivan and Ruben Gallego took to social media to publicly rebuke the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) over the defense budget. I understand that Taiwan’s head is on the chopping block, and the urgency of its security situation cannot be overstated. However, the comments from Wicker, Sullivan and Gallego suggest they have fallen victim to a sophisticated disinformation campaign orchestrated by an administration in Taipei that treats national security as a partisan weapon. The narrative fed to our allies claims the opposition is slashing the defense budget to kowtow to the Chinese\nBy Howard Shen 沈正浩\n-\nEDITORIAL: Squaring the security circle\n2026-02-08In a Taipei Times editorial published almost three years ago (“Macron goes off-piste,” April 13, 2023, page 8), French President Emmanuel Macron was criticized for comments he made immediately after meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) in Beijing. Macron had spoken of the need for his country to find a path on Chinese foreign policy no longer aligned with that of the US, saying that continuing to follow the US agenda would sacrifice the EU’s strategic autonomy. At the time, Macron was criticized for gifting Xi a PR coup, and the editorial said that he had been “persuaded to run\n-\nEDITORIAL: Film disrespects Taiwanese history\n2026-02-09The wrap-up press event on Feb. 1 for the new local period suspense film Murder of the Century (世紀血案), adapted from the true story of the Lin family murders (林家血案) in 1980, has sparked waves of condemnation in the past week, as well as a boycott. The film is based on the shocking, unsolved murders that occurred at then-imprisoned provincial councilor and democracy advocate Lin I-hsiung’s (林義雄) residence on Feb. 28, 1980, while Lin was detained for his participation in the Formosa Incident, in which police and protesters clashed during a pro-democracy rally in Kaohsiung organized by Formosa Magazine on Dec.\n-\nCopyright © 1999-2026 The Taipei Times.
