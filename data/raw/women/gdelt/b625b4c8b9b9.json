The royal, 42, tweeted: \"Of course I was watching, @Ally_McCoist9.\"\nHe tagged sports commentator Ally McCoist – who had given William a shout out during the match – and signed it with a \"W\" and a clenched arm muscle emoji.\nDon't miss: Meghan Markle's 'potential weapon in back pocket' is threat to Firm\nDon't miss: Body language expert decodes 'real' meaning behind Meghan's 'koala hugs'\nDon't miss: Meghan Markle 'doing her best' with one change but it's 'difficult'\nOur community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

Alongside the photo, he wrote: \"Such a proud moment for myself and my family, I am humbled to be receiving my OBE from Prince William at Windsor Castle today.\n\"Thank you for all the support and messages. It means so much. Did we speak about @AVFCOfficial?? That’s between the Prince and I.\"\nWilliam was among the spectators at the team's grounds Villa Park alongside his and wife Kate's close friend, Thomas van Straubenzee, earlier this month. He was present to watch the first match between Villa and German giants Bayern, which Villa won 1-0 in a repeat of their 1982 European Cup final win.",
