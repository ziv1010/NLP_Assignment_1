  "body_text": "Allegiant Stadium debuts enhanced culinary experience for Las Vegas Raiders games\nMonday, Sept. 15, 2025 | 2 a.m.\nEditor's note: Este artículo está traducido al español.\nMany fans will flock to Allegiant Stadium tonight for the Raiders’ home debut on “Monday Night Football” eager to watch their beloved franchise.\nSandra Taylor hopes the experience also includes having a glass of wine.\nTwo years ago, she was working the 150s level at the stadium, curating a premium wine program featuring more than 20 labels for suite owners and treating fans to tastings of everything from rich bordeaux to crisp pinot.\nBut Taylor quickly recognized a challenge: In Las Vegas’s sweltering heat, with football games kicking off as early as 1 p.m., fans craved something far lighter than traditional wines.\nThat realization sparked her mission to craft the perfect rosé — a quest that led her all the way to France, where she collaborated with Gerard Bertrand, a world-renowned rosé sommelier. They hand-selected every grape for what would become a distinctive five-varietal blend: “Raider Rosé.”\nThe elegant pink wine, housed in a sleek glass bottle adorned with the iconic Raiders logo, remains exclusively available at Allegiant Stadium home games — making it a coveted treasure for devoted fans. In just two seasons, Taylor has moved over 12,000 bottles of Raider Rosé and is already stockpiling inventory for the games ahead.\n“I feel like this is my second family, and I wanted to create something for (owner) Mark Davis to go along with his commitment to excellence and everything he does — and the Raiders really do,” said Taylor, head sommelier of Silver and Black Hospitality and the first sommelier in the National Football League. “We are No. 1 in hospitality, not only in the NFL, but in the world. Being No. 1 in hospitality means taking the game-day fan experience to the next level, and we do that in everything we do.”\nTaylor and her blush-colored wine are part of a larger squad that helps fans at Allegiant Stadium stay full and hydrated. The Silver and Black Hospitality team, launched in 2020 when the franchise relocated here from California, oversees everything hospitality related, from the simple hot dogs and sodas sold at concession stands to sushi for the premium suites or colorful cocktails.\nThey also work with local restaurants to bring their products into the stadium.\nPizza Rock by Tony Gemignani, Evel Pie, Capriotti’s and Fuku — some of the first to grace the stadium back when it opened — will return to serve fans this season.\nThe options have expanded even further to include more local favorites, including cold brew from Mothership Coffee; poke nachos from Antidote; ceviche and churros from Border Grill; buffalo lemon pepper, lemon garlic Parmesan wings, and barbecue ranch chicken fries from Mr. Fries Man; asada and al pastor tacos from Taqueria Ktrina; and strawberries with cream and mango passionfruit agua fresca from Tu Michoacana.\nAnne Matthews, director of operations with Silver and Black Hospitality, said they take great pride in partnering with local, minority and women-owned businesses. It’s part of their commitment to the community, she added, saying that “we feel like we can help them grow their establishment as well, and they can help us by offering things that we don’t normally offer here at the stadium.”\nIt’s not just about your chicken tenders and fries anymore. Fans, both local and out of town, can now grab a fresh cup of chamango — fresh cut mangoes slathered in savory red chamoy — or opt for the kalbi short rib with a scoop of white rice and macaroni salad from Hawaiian joint Antidote.\nEven Matthews has been able to sample cuisine she’s never had before, like agua fresca, with the addition of small businesses like Tu Michoacana, she said.\n“When we’re looking for subcontractors, we’re looking for people that can help fill the void, and what’s trending, and what are people talking about,” Matthews said. “I think that our menu offerings here are different from other stadiums because we really try to elevate the options. We don’t want to stick with the basics, we want to go outside the box. We want to bring the taste of Vegas into Allegiant.”\nPremium suites and loge sections will have the chance to get a taste of the sweet and savory, with newly renovated dessert carts and an omakase-style sushi stand serving up slices of nigiri straight from the Toyosu region of Japan.\nChef Yoshi Kojima imports seafood staples like yellowtail, whole octopus, bluefin tuna and golden eye snapper to quickly slice and serve on a small plate for fans in the 200-level loges, while premium suites get a set menu and clubs are served three types of handrolls.\nWhen it comes to creating a sushi menu for the football crowd, Kojima and sous chef Jon Racimo like to switch it up based on the occasion or season. Racimo explained that if the Raiders play a team from somewhere like the East Coast, they may decide to include a dish incorporating soft shell crab, or something similar as an homage to the opposing team.\nFor those with a sweet tooth, the dessert cart will bring back some well-loved classics, as well as some new items — like their spherical pastry domes. These balls may not light up like its much-bigger counterpart just off the Strip, but they are filled with an assortment of different desserts like carrot cake or tiramisu.\nThere’s also edible cookie dough, giant slices of cake, mini macaroons, dipped apples, ice cream, and a bag of cookies with the Raiders logo printed on them. Kristine Raymer, senior executive chef with Silver and Black Hospitality, said desserts like these will change up frequently depending on the game.\nAt today’s home opener against the Los Angeles Chargers, fans can also indulge in a Hispanic and Latin-inspired menu for Hispanic Heritage Month.\nThe “Viva Los Raiders” menu features some reimagined staples of Hispanic and Latino cuisine, like birria fries, taco salad, a hot dog covered in chilaquiles, a birria eggroll with a side of consomme to dip, a bananas foster-filled flauta, and flaky buñelos with a side of syrup.\nAll of these products can be found at various stands across the four levels in Allegiant Stadium, with prices starting at $6, but Matthews noted that the venue still has budget-friendly deals, such as their $2.99 hot dog, chips and drink special.\nSilver and Black Hospitality has also partnered with spatial intelligence platform AiFi to introduce 10 new grab-and-go markets on all levels, and turned existing portables at the Torch Entrance into these quick shops in a pilot program to be tested this season.\nAll of it, the chefs at Silver and Black Hospitality stressed, is for the fans.\n“The energy that we feel here (from the fans) … it’s insane, and you feel it. It’s electrifying, like, when the guest comes and you feel that energy and they’re excited, it excites us,” Raymer said. “It pushes us more to keep incorporating new ideas, and not to get stale. We listen to the guests; it’s all about them and giving them the experience and the things that they do want to see.”",
