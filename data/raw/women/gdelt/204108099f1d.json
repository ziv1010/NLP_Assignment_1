  "body_text": "Entertainment\nAn Iranian newspaper \"cut off\" the lush buttocks of Cristiano Ronaldo's fiancée in a family photo. Photos before and after\nThe buttocks of world-famous footballer Cristiano Ronaldo's fiancée Georgina Rodriguez have been censored in Iran's main national newspaper Hamshahri. On February 5, the Portuguese athlete published a family photo in honor of his 39th birthday, which showed Rodrigues in a tight dress that emphasized her lush buttocks, the display of which is legally prohibited in Iran.\nIn order to still be able to publish the photo, the newspaper staff decided to \"cut off\" a piece of her body in the photo editor so that the photo did not show her buttocks at all and the failed Photoshop was clearly visible. According to The Sun, Rodriguez will be offended by this incident, because she spends a lot of time and effort creating the perfect shape.\n\"She works hard on her body and is very proud of her curves. It just goes to show you that the way women are viewed in some parts of the world is distorted. It's such a low point,\" an anonymous source told The Sun.\nBritish-Iranian actor Omid Jalili said: \"Showing so little respect for women by publicly defacing them says so much.\" Meanwhile, Belgian MP Daria Safai blamed the strict rules of religion: \"This is how sick Islamists look at women.\"\nIran has strict laws regarding the concealment of body parts by women. In case of non-compliance, the offender faces up to 10 years in prison. Women in the country are required to wear a veil and loose clothing that covers everything except their hands and face.\nThese \"draconian\" rules also apply to another country, Saudi Arabia, where Cristiano Ronaldo and his family moved in 2022 because of the athlete's transfer to the Al-Nassr football team. However, while in that country, Georgina Rodriguez adhered to strict laws.\nOnly verified information is available on the OBOZ.UA Telegram channel and Viber. Do not fall for fakes!",
