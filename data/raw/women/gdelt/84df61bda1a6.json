Ahead of the tournament, ABIODUN ADEWALE takes a look at how some of the key players have fared recently\nAjibade returned to first-team action three weeks ago after being sidelined with injury since November.\nSince joining the club in the summer, the Super Falcons star has made nine league appearances, providing one assist, but she is yet to open her goal-scoring account.\nHowever, her influence on the pitch is undeniable. She recently led other Super Falcons players in the International Federation of Football History and Statistics Women’s Africa XI.\nThe selection, released by the IFFHS as its Women’s CAF Team of the Year for 2025, features Ajibade, goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie, defenders Michelle Alozie and Ashleigh Plumptre, and midfielder Christy Ucheibe.\nIn Saudi Arabia, Oshoala continues to make headlines. She was the star of the show last Thursday, scoring a first-half brace in Al Hilal Ladies’ 3-3 draw with Al Ahli.\nHer performance highlighted her continued influence in Saudi women’s football, where she has quickly established herself as one of the most dangerous attackers.\nOn Sunday, Super Falcons goalkeeper Nnadozie made four saves from seven shots faced, but it was not enough to prevent Brighton from losing 3-2 to West Ham United in the Women’s Super League.\nIt marked a second consecutive league defeat for Brighton Women, leaving them with just one win in their last five games. The goalkeeper has kept four clean sheets in 13 games since arriving in England in the summer.\nLike Ajibade, Nnadozie was also named in the IFFHS CAF Women’s XI, reflecting her reputation as one of Africa’s leading goalkeepers through her performances for Nigeria, former club Paris FC, and current side Brighton & Hove Albion, where she has combined consistent shot-stopping with leadership responsibilities in 2025.\nDefenders Michelle Alozie and Ashleigh Plumptre were also named in the IFFHS Africa XI defence.\nAlozie, who recently switched from Houston Dash to Chicago Stars FC, is still warming up for the new season in the United States, as is the star of the 2024 WAFCON, Esther Okoronkwo, who is based in Canada.\nFalcons’ build-up tournament\nMeanwhile, the Super Falcons will begin their build-up to the 2026 tournament by competing in a four-nation West African tournament scheduled to take place in Abidjan later this month.\nThe team has confirmed participation in the invitational competition, organised by the West African Football Union (WAFU) B, which will run from February 27 to March 7, 2026, in Ivory Coast.\nThe tournament will feature four teams that have all qualified for WAFCON 2026, with hosts Ivory Coast joined by Nigeria, Ghana and Senegal.\nThe mini-tournament is expected to serve as a final competitive test for the teams, ending just 10 days before the start of the WAFCON finals in Morocco.\nAlthough there are still some uncertainties surrounding the tournament — following the hosts’ reported request for postponement — the 2026 WAFCON is scheduled to run from March 17 to April 3, 2026.\nDefending champions Nigeria have been drawn in Group C alongside Zambia, Egypt and debutants Malawi.",
