  "body_text": "Following a consultation period earlier this year, the Home Office has confirmed licensed premises that would normally close at 11pm will be permitted to keep serving until 1am, giving fans the opportunity to celebrate.\nThis year’s tournament is being held in Switzerland between Tuesday 2 and Sunday 27 July, with the two semi-finals taking place on 22 and 23 July, following by the final match in Basel on 27 July.\nUKHospitality (UKH) chief executive Kate Nicholls said: “The pub is the best place to watch the Women’s Euros and I’m pleased the Government will extend licensing hours if either of the home nations reaches the semi-finals or final.\nEarly action\n“The success of the Lionesses, in particular, has captured the heart of the nation and I know communities will be flocking to the pub to cheer on both England and Wales.\n“I’m pleased the Government has acted early with this decision, which will help pubs plan their activity during the tournament.”\nSimilar extensions to pub hours have previously been used for other major sporting events, including the men’s Euro’s 2024 final, as well as significant royal events, such as the King’s coronation.\nMost recently, licensing hours for pubs and bars were extended to 1am on the 80th anniversary on VE Day on Thursday 8 May.\nAdditionally, data from real time market intelligence firm Oxford Partnership recently demonstrated the positive impact live sport events can have on trading.\nSoaring sales\nIt said that events such as FA Cup and Six Nations boosted footfall in venues, estimating 1.7m pints of beer could be poured during the men’s FA Cup final on Saturday 17 May 2025, equating to a £7m boost for the sector.\nDrinks sales across the on-trade soared during the men’s Euros final last year, with 17m pints sold during the match, with the average pub serving 462 pints of draught beer and cider, equating to an additional revenue of £950.\nBritish Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) CEO Emma McClarkin added: “The pub is the home of live sport. Nothing compares when it comes to bringing atmosphere and camaraderie to watching the football live, and we expect supporters will be flocking to their local to cheer on our brilliant teams.\n“Our sector plays a huge part in boosting community spirit, and extending licensing hours means people can gather for longer and host even more events that cheer on our squads.”",
