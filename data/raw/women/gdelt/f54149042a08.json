  "body_text": "Sarina Wiegman hates talking about individuals and she refrained from doing so yet again when asked about standout performers Lauren James, Rachel Daly and Chloe Kelly following England’s second consecutive Arnold Clark Cup triumph.\nMore than at any other point in Wiegman’s reign, this international break has been all about the different members of the Lionesses squad in isolation. The England manager rotated heavily for the Italy game, giving fringe players a chance to make their mark, but picked her strongest starting XI for Wednesday’s thumping 6-1 win over Belgium.\nAdvertisement\nCollectively, England were impressive, particularly in how they regained the ball, but these wins over South Korea, Italy and Belgium were about helping Wiegman decide the final slots in her 23-player squad for the Women’s World Cup.\nAfter the game on Wednesday, Wiegman said she has plenty of thinking to do before the summer: “In some positions, if those players stay fit and performing as they do, their chance of not being picked for the first XI is not very high. For some positions, I don’t know yet and I don’t have to know yet.”\nThe below list is an educated guess by The Athletic of the 40 most important players at Wiegman’s disposal and how likely they are to make her squad for next summer’s tournament. Try not to get too bogged down in the numbers as these aren’t strict rankings — though it’s safe to say the names towards the top of this list are England’s key protagonists.\n1. Keira Walsh\nProbably the player England can least afford to lose, considering the fact Wiegman’s alternative plan in the holding role is moving Leah Williamson from centre-back into midfield, which in turn disrupts the defence.\n2. Leah Williamson\nAs captain, an automatic starter — although Wiegman did drop her Netherlands captain Mandy van den Berg at Euro 2017. Her line-breaking passes are priceless. The debate about whether she plays in midfield or defence may never be entirely settled but she is more comfortable at centre-back.\n3. Millie Bright\nEngland’s most consistent defender and, judging from last summer’s Euro 2022 quarter-final victory against Spain, also the plan B in attack.\n4. Lucy Bronze\nSeems reinvigorated after her summer move to Barcelona and still provides flashbacks to that overlapping, buccaneering right-back from a couple of years ago. A reliable defender, an invaluable leader and has clearly struck up a good partnership with James.\nLucy 🖇 Leah\n2️⃣-0️⃣ to the #Lionesses! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/57bMkv1AUF\n— Lionesses (@Lionesses) February 22, 2023\n5. Georgia Stanway\nWas not an automatic pick 12 months ago but now it’s difficult to imagine her outside England’s first team. Wiegman needs presence in midfield and Stanway delivers. She also displays a fine partnership with Walsh from their Manchester City days.\nAdvertisement\n6. Mary Earps\nStill England’s No 1, in part because of her excellent distribution and communication.\n7. Rachel Daly\nThe major change from this international break. Still an option at left-back but her superb centre-forward performance against Italy, and her place at the top of the WSL goalscoring charts (10 goals, tied with Manchester City’s Khadija Shaw), means she might now be Wiegman’s best bet up front. Her pressing helps England dominate in terms of territory and she is excellent at attacking crosses. The only question mark is her hold-up play.\n8. Lauren James\nNot even in the squad for Euro 2022 but now England’s most exciting attacking option. Outstanding against South Korea, the Arnold Clark Cup player of the tournament is capable of either dribbling on the outside or drifting infield into central positions.\n9. Alex Greenwood\nPlayed left-back against South Korea and Belgium, and centre-back against Italy — and seems comfortable in either position. Unfortunate to be omitted from England’s regular XI last summer. Daly’s move into an attacking position means she could be an automatic starter in Australia.\n10. Chloe Kelly\nThe Arnold Clark Cup Golden Boot winner. Capable of taking players on or combining with others to pass through the opposition. She is full of confidence after scoring three goals in three appearances.\n11. Alessia Russo\nLast year’s super-sub up front seemed nailed-on to become England’s starting centre-forward after Ellen White’s retirement but Daly’s great form means there’s now a question when it comes to who leads the line.\nRusso performed well against South Korea and is a better player with her back to goal than Daly, but a goal against Belgium just didn’t come. Wiegman said she won’t use the Manchester United forward with Daly as a strike partnership, so it’s one or the other — or Aston Villa’s Daly reverting to left-back.\nAdvertisement\n12 Ella Toone\nThe natural alternative to Fran Kirby, Toone showed intelligence against South Korea and Belgium by drifting out and combining with England’s wide players.\n13. Fran Kirby\nPerfect for the hybrid midfield/No 10 role in this England system. Illness caused her to miss the end of last season and she withdrew from this squad because of a knee injury, but a fully-fit Kirby remains one of the best sights in football.\n14. Lauren Hemp\nAlways direct and purposeful in possession, although we haven’t seen her best form in an England shirt over the past year. James’ introduction means she is now competing for a starting place on the wing.\n15. Jess Carter\nHanded starts against South Korea and Italy at centre-back, and replaced Greenwood at left-back against Belgium, demonstrating Wiegman’s faith in her. She can play anywhere across the back line but is ultimately a second choice.\n16. Ellie Roebuck\nEngland’s No 2 and started against Italy, but she will be disappointed with her concession in that game, and her kicking is less impressive than that of Earps.\n17. Katie Zelem\nOmitted from the final squad for Euro 2022 last summer but a good club campaign for Manchester United means she’s likely to be a back-up midfielder in Australia, even if moving Williamson forward is Wiegman’s preference. Briefly wore the captain’s armband against Italy — a mark of how she is viewed in the squad.\n18. Maya Le Tissier\nExcellent at centre-back for Manchester United this season, although her two England starts have come at right-back, where she often played last season for Brighton.\n19. Niamh Charles\nSimilar to Le Tissier — she’s generally used at right-back for Chelsea, although her three England starts have come at left-back. Although cut from the final Euros squad, her versatility, England’s relative lack of full-back options, and Daly’s move further forward mean she could be part of the squad.\nAdvertisement\n20. Lotte Wubben-Moy\nRarely afforded a start at international level — the Arsenal defender came on in the 81st minute against Belgium — and needs to prove her consistency for Arsenal, but evidently a respected member of the squad.\n21. Sandy MacIver\nSeemingly England’s No 3 but she hasn’t played a minute under Wiegman and needs more game time at Manchester City.\n22. Ebony Salmon\nBattling it out with Bethany England to be England’s third-choice striker behind Daly and Russo — it seems unlikely Wiegman will take four. An impressive start to the new NWSL season in March, where she plays for Houston Dash, is a must.\n23. Jordan Nobbs\nBack in the squad after Kirby withdrew through injury and always receives a huge ovation from fans when introduced to the crowd. Her impressive form at Villa is likely to improve her chances of making this year’s squad, having missed recent major tournaments through injury, but there is tough competition in midfield.\n24. Katie Robinson\nVery dangerous down the right against Italy, including assisting Daly’s first goal. Seems likely to be England’s fourth winger, after Kelly, James and Hemp.\n25. Jess Park\nEnjoying a good season for Everton and deserved her first England start in the win over Italy. A central role, however, didn’t quite suit her in these games. Brought on for Toone against Belgium in the latter stages, a nod to her good performance, but she will need to impress in subsequent games to have any chance of making the World Cup squad.\n26. Laura Coombs\nSurprisingly recalled to England after an eight-year absence. Was the oldest player in the squad at 32. England have relatively few midfield options but Zelem and Nobbs still seem more authoritative in possession.\n27. Bethany England\nA non-playing member at the Euros and appeared in two qualifiers at the start of September, but has since been omitted, presumably because of a lack of game time at Chelsea. Something of a surprise she was not included in this squad given her three goals in three games for Tottenham since joining in January. If she keeps on scoring, she will be hard to ignore.\n28. Emily Ramsey\nIncluded in this squad but suffered an ankle injury and has returned home. Probably England’s fourth-choice goalkeeper.\nAdvertisement\n29. Beth Mead\nIt seems almost impossible that Mead will recover from November’s ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in time to make the World Cup squad but Wiegman has yet to rule her out completely. If there’s any player you might take a chance on, it would be last summer’s Euro 2022 player of the tournament.\n30. Gabby George\nNot included in this squad but shining for Everton in a wing-back role and voted the WSL’s player of the month for January.\n31. Millie Turner\nHas previously been in four England squads without being capped. Turner was ruled out of the Euro 2022 squad after being diagnosed with a carotid artery dissection but she hasn’t missed a minute for Manchester United in this season’s WSL.\n32. Esme Morgan\nYet another defender capped under Wiegman who can play various defensive roles. It was deemed too risky to bring her back from her recent injury for this camp.\n33. Nikita Parris\nA key player going into the 2019 World Cup but with other wingers in good form, the 28-year-old may struggle to get back in.\n34. Anna Patten\nCaptain of England’s resurrected under-23 team, and scored in their 4-1 victory over Belgium this week. Likely to be capped for the senior side at some stage.\n35. Lucy Staniforth\nNot involved since the preliminary squad for Euro 2022 but England’s relative lack of midfield options means she’s probably only one or two injuries away from making the squad.\n36. Steph Houghton\nThe 34-year-old former captain’s time seemst to have passed but she’s back in Manchester City’s starting XI and performed well in their 2-1 win over Arsenal earlier this month.\n37. Lucy Parker\nAnother defensive option. Received her first international call-up in October but had to withdraw through injury, which has derailed her campaign for West Ham.\n38. Demi Stokes\nHasn’t played in 2022 because of injury, although wasn’t a regular at Manchester City earlier this season even when fully fit. Her only hope is that Daly’s move up front has opened up another slot at full-back.\nAdvertisement\n39. Hannah Hampton\nDropped in September and seemingly now fifth-choice goalkeeper, and it is unlikely Wiegman would risk her considering the minimal chance of a third goalkeeper being required in Australia.\n40. Leah Galton\nNever capped by England but she’s a regular for table-topping Manchester United and only seven WSL players this season have recorded more combined goals and assists.\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Eamonn Dalton)",
