This exhibition was to showcase transformation and achievements made in various projects under Vision 2030, an initiative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia aimed towards the diversification of the country – economically, socially, and culturally.\nSpread across 12 pavilions, this event was not any other cosmetic activity or a government showcase. Rather than reassertion of all too well-known stereotypes such as the economic might of oil-rich kingdom, supreme standing in the Islamic world, or its leadership of the Arab world, this was a showcase that focused on the transformation being witnessed under the visionary present regime.\nSaudi Arabia wants to tell the world how the kingdom is changing. It is also very serious about how the world sees it now. It wants the world to see it in a new light. The sectors and their initiatives chosen to be highlighted clearly show the transformation of mindset and the narrative Saudi Arabia wants to set for itself.\nOn display were the ministry of energy’s actions to power homes through natural resources, the ministry of sports being much bigger than widely talked about football league and growing women participation in sports, technology teams showcased using data, AI, and ML to transform daily experiences and the contingent from Neom projects spoke about progress made for what has been projected as future of living.\nA series of immersive and interactive displays of work being done by various departments spoke about knowledge transfer with regional and international partners, net zero carbon emissions, usage of artificial intelligence and machine learning to come up with solutions for betterment of human lives and talk about largest reforestation program in the world.\nRather than insist on billions being pumped in to make Neom – the most ambitious urban living project, the exhibits of four projects under this mega development highlighted net-zero carbon emissions, advanced technologies like IoT and robotics and seamless and intelligent supply chain. Presentations for The Line, one of the most talked about urban living projects, stressed how the priority was people’s health and well-being with 95% of the land preserved for nature and plans to run it on 100% renewable energy and offer easy access to daily essentials within a five-minute walk.\nThe Middle East Green Initiative, The Saudi Green initiative, Future Investment initiative and The Knowledge Economic City are all part of the plans that Saudi Arabia would want the world to know and talk about. It wants to be seen as a forward thinking kingdom that is committed to sustainability and will use tech for seamless living. The Red Sea, a luxury tourism projects that will best of hotels and resorts to attract travellers from round the world is something that one could have never thought Saudi Arabia would have showcased a decade ago. Today, all these upcoming developments are being strongly pitched around the world.\nIncreased participation of women in every sphere of life, talking about a clean and green future, setting up of new tech driven sustainable cities and undergoing a complete transformation in education and health sectors, Saudi Arabia, under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants to tell a whole new story to the world. As the prince famously said, he sees the region at the forefront of the world in near future. The way they’re going about it, it might well and truly be one.\nTop Comment\n{{{short}}} {{#more}} {{{long}}}...
