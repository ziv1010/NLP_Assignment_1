  "body_text": "It was an absolutely wild year for the U.S. women’s national team: a new head coach, an Olympic gold medal and more retirements from the greats of the program, from forward Alex Morgan to goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher to former captain and centerback Becky Sauerbrunn.\nIt was a year of change, a year of joy and a year of re-establishing the team on the world stage, earning back the No. 1 world ranking. 2024 was a year of goodbyes, even as this summer felt like an introduction to a new version of the USWNT, led by players such as Trinity Rodman, Sophia Smith, Mal Swanson and Naomi Girma.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s difficult to truly sum up everything that happened for the national team this year, but here are some of the best and biggest moments — and a brief look ahead to what 2025 has in store.\nThe high point\nIt’s hard to ignore the Olympic gold medal-winning goal as the moment of the year, especially when the build-up was more than 12 months in the making.\nFor nearly a decade, Swanson has been a fixture of the USWNT discourse. From her senior international debut in 2016 through her role as a rotating winger and full back on the 2019 World Cup-winning squad, most of that dialogue centered on her potential. Just as she was earning that regular first-choice role and scoring goals for fun in early 2023, a torn patellar tendon threatened to bring that brief time in the spotlight to an abrupt close.\nSwanson returned to action this spring, first with the Chicago Red Stars and soon after with the USWNT. It took a little time before her knee could handle her usual nimble footwork on the ball, her clever runs beyond a flat-footed defense and the power behind her well-placed shots. By the time the Olympics kicked off, she looked closer to her usual self, weaving up the attacking third with ‘Triple Espresso’ partners Rodman and Smith with some smart and less-heralded decoy runs to give either fellow forward additional room.\nAs the tournament progressed, opponents found ways to at least contain ‘Triple Espresso’. In the second half of the gold medal match, the United States needed to find a more direct route to exploit a compact Brazilian block. After a savvy upfield ball from Korbin Albert, Swanson collected the ball on the corner of the box.\nThe hard months of recovery paid off, as Swanson dribbled into the heart of the penalty area and placed her shot to goalkeeper Lorena’s far post. It was enough to claim the Olympics’ top prize — and, in the process, complete a dream she’d put into writing as a sixth-grader. How’s that for a character arc?\nAdvertisement\nBest game\nIf you only caught the USWNT during their triumphant Olympic run, do yourself a favor and throw on the CONCACAF W Gold Cup quarterfinal against Colombia.\nComing into the match, the United States was still in its post-World Cup crisis. They had just lost to Mexico for the first time since 2010 in the group stage, a result which doubled as their first home defeat against any CONCACAF opponent since 2000. Interim head coach Twila Kilgore had entrusted relative newcomers in her tournament squad, and the group stage results were entirely underwhelming. Defenders looked like they were playing with fear and opting to recirculate rather than break lines with their passes. Forwards weren’t confident as they neared goal. Midfielders were scampering all over the field in vain to try to create numerical advantages.\nWorst of all, there was a visible lack of joy across the roster. It would take a statement win to revive the program. A matchup against a Colombia side that advanced further in the 2023 World Cup than the USWNT provided that chance.\nColombia rattled the hosts by pressing high upfield, wanting to force nervous defenders into turnovers and beat them on the break. After years of wanting to own possession under Kilgore and predecessor Vlatko Andonovski, the United States tried one simple trick that Colombia hated: playing direct, storming to a 3-0 lead at halftime and eventually winning the match.\nIt was clear Colombia weren’t happy about it. Their fouls became increasingly chippy, leading to viral encounters from both Rodman and Morgan. The latter’s cool resolve and hard work leading the line made it among her greatest shifts for her country. In the immediate aftermath, it felt as though the program was starting to rediscover its identity as a favorite. With the benefit of further hindsight, it was truly a pivotal morale-boosting win ahead of head coach Emma Hayes’ arrival.\nAdvertisement\nBest player\nWhat is left to say about Naomi Girma at this point?\nThe Olympics were Girma’s coronation tour as one of the best defenders in the world — though to Hayes she’s stands alone in the top spot already, at only 24 years old. For Hayes, Girma already has all the tools: composure, anticipation, leadership – you name it.\n“She’s the best defender I’ve ever seen,” Hayes told reporters in the mixed zone after the shutout Olympic semifinal victory against Germany. “Ever.”\nIn 2023, Girma became the first defender to win U.S. Soccer’s player of the year award on the women’s side, and while the goalscoring triple threat of Swanson, Rodman and Smith all have their own cases for the award this year, it’s fair to expect Girma wins back-to-back. (She got my vote this year. — Meg Linehan)\nWhile she could win the award based on her performance in France this summer — she was, notably, the only field player to play every single minute of the tournament — Girma added a couple of exclamation points to her 2024 resume in October.\nAll year, the defender had a nose for goal in addition to her her other responsibilities on the field, but “Two Goal Girma” made her debut in Louisville against Argentina. Not only was there no epic wait necessary for her first international goal, but she scored her second in the same game.\nDefender Naomi Girma scores her first international goal for the #USWNT 🔥\n🎥 @USWNT pic.twitter.com/4MsXa0h2VV\n— The Athletic Soccer (@TheAthleticSCCR) October 30, 2024\nThis team could face some big changes in 2025 as they attempt to qualify for the 2027 World Cup, but there’s no question over who the linchpin is: Girma is both the soul and brains of this team. After all, as Rodman said this summer, “she’s the glue”.\nA moment of adversity\nWhile there was plenty of change on the field, the U.S. also faced something off the field that it hasn’t publicly dealt with in recent years. The team, which has typically presented a united front in the face of adversity like equal pay, had to manage the aftermath of anti-LGBTQ+ posts shared by one of its own.\nAdvertisement\nEarlier this year, midfielder Korbin Albert apologized for her actions after receiving widespread criticism for sharing anti-LGBTQ+ content on social media. Her apology came after outside pressure, including that of former USWNT midfielder Megan Rapinoe. The content included a video, publicly shared by the player, of a sermon given in a Christian worship space talking about how being gay and “feeling transgender” is wrong.\nThe incident prompted an official response from USWNT players via their captains at the time, Alex Morgan and Lindsey Horan.\n“We’ve worked extremely hard to uphold the integrity of this national team through all of the generations and we are extremely, extremely sad that this standard was not upheld,” Horan said during a press call in April. “Our fans and our supporters feel like this is a team that they can rally behind. And it’s so important that they feel and continue to feel undeniably heard and seen.”\nThroughout the year, fans made their dissatisfaction with Albert’s actions heard, often booing when her name was announced in stadiums, including during Pride month. The booing continued into the team’s final international matches of the year, with fans booing when Albert subbed into the game at Wembley against England on November 30.\nBefore the Olympics, Hayes said Albert made the 18-player roster on merit and that she is a “tremendous human being“, while also acknowledging that Albert has “work” to do in relation to her comments. After the game in England, Hayes said she was focused on coaching football.\n“Of course, I understand the booing, and everybody is entitled to their opinions on it,” Hayes said after the 0-0 draw with England. “My job is not to weigh in on the debate, my job as a football coach is to produce a football team. And like I always do, I’ve sat down with Korbin, I’ve had several conversations with her to make sure that self-development piece is there.”\nWhile the team has appeared to move past the saga as Hayes continues to include Albert in the squad, there’s no doubt Albert’s actions and the team’s response were a key part of the 2024 story.\nAdvertisement\nThe stat that sums up 2024\n14: the number of consecutive months that the USWNT hadn’t been atop FIFA’s rankings before making their triumphant return to the top in August 2024. In a broader context, it’s an encouraging sign for the entirety of women’s international soccer, as more competition at the highest level is necessary.\nGO DEEPER\nUSWNT returns to top of FIFA world rankings after Olympic gold\nHowever, it was by far the longest the program has spent ranked lower than No. 1. In total, the USWNT has been outside of first position for just 22 total months since 2008. The most recent “slump” makes up 63.6 per cent of their total time outside of pole position. It’s been a staggering run of success for the United States over nearly two decades and one that looks ready to endure after Hayes’ first year in charge.\nFavorite quote\nHayes is a walking quote machine. It’s something she acknowledged in an NWSL conference room filled with reporters on her first official day on the job, joking that the USWNT had never had anyone with a personality like her before.\nThe mixed zone following the USWNT’s extra-time Olympic semifinal win over Germany in Lyon, France, was the final taste of life outside the chaos of Paris. Hayes was in an understandably good mood while holding court after the final whistle. As she was ushered off, someone finally asked her if she wanted Spain in the upcoming final. A throwback, perhaps, to her parting words at Chelsea. (“I’ve got to f––ing beat the Spanish at some point,” another superb quote in its own right.)\n“I don’t care,” Hayes replied with a tired grin. “I want a drink.”\nShe earned celebratory drinks a few days later when the U.S. won gold.\nDid that really happen?\nIf the Olympics had gone poorly, the answer to this question probably would have been the 2-0 loss to Mexico at the W Gold Cup. The loss, a pretty comprehensive one, felt like a massive reminder that the USWNT mystique was long gone. Now, on the other side of the year following a gold medal, that assessment doesn’t feel entirely untrue — but we’ve seen that the USWNT mentality still serves a purpose.\nAdvertisement\nSo instead, goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher saving three penalties and converting one of her own not once, but twice, in the same calendar year against the same team (sorry to Canada) is the “wait, what?” moment of the year.\nALYSSA NAEHER CAN SAVE AND CONVERT PENALTIES 🤯 pic.twitter.com/vewrwXwto5\n— Attacking Third (@AttackingThird) March 7, 2024\nIn a year where even more stalwarts of the program retired without big farewell tours, Naeher included, she at least gave a perfect send-off throughout 2024 with several massive performances. I don’t think we’ll ever see anything quite like this again.\nPlayer to watch in 2025\nThe post-Olympics story of Hayes’ first year was her proactive introduction of several newcomers into her national team pool. The work began in earnest with her Olympic squad, as Emily Sams, Hal Hershfelt and Croix Bethune were named alternates despite never appearing for the USWNT before the tune-up friendlies. That introduction manifesto became more proactive in the fall, with more than half a dozen more players earning their first cap.\nThere are almost too many fresh faces to confidently single one out here, but I’ll stump for Yazmeen Ryan as one to watch next year. The 25-year-old from Norman, Oklahoma, has flourished since joining Gotham FC in 2023, becoming a regular starter for the two-time NWSL finalists and showcasing her versatility by filling numerous roles. No matter where she lines up she’s hellbent on progressing the ball upfield, which she can do with give-and-go passing or her own dribbling prowess. That skillset is invaluable at the international level.\nShe might not be shoehorned into a fixed role like Crystal Dunn was at left back, but Ryan’s ability to fill multiple roles and do work between the boxes should keep her in Hayes’ plans for the foreseeable future.\nBiggest question for 2025\nAs Hayes patiently wades through her information-gathering era, we look to the goalkeeper pool, where the nature of the position doesn’t allow as much flexibility in terms of switching starters around. Following Naeher’s retirement, a switch will have to happen. Two of the most prominent backups who have earned time behind Naeher, Casey Murphy and Jane Campbell, are 28 and 29 respectively. That doesn’t age them out of the goalkeeper spot, but it does not necessarily make them players to build around past 2028.\nWith the goalkeeper position, is it enough to have someone who will carry the team through 2027-28, and then start the process all over again? Or will that interim generation of players in their late twenties essentially get skipped for a newer generation, such as Mandy Haught or Shelby Hogan – or even a young Teagan Wy? Perhaps there will be a recall for Phallon Tullis-Joyce, who is also 28 but could help challenge the rest of the pack after her time in England with Manchester United.\nIt’ll be strange to see someone who’s not Naeher in net for the U.S. after so long of the team quietly depending on her — that’s the nature of goalkeeper lifecycles. Whoever it is might also need to be prepared to compete for a decade-long tenure.\n(Top photo: Andrea Vilchez / Getty Images)",
