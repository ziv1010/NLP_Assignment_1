  "body_text": "The Nebraska Cornhuskers staging of its Volleyball Day in Nebraska match was so impressive, that the entire sporting world took notice.\nMake no mistake about it, Volleyball Day in Nebraska is a massive, massive hit. I’d venture to say that not even those involved with the Nebraska Cornhuskers athletic program could have seen exactly how today would unfold. Or the reactions on social media.\nIt truly feels as though every corner of the sporting world has taken notice of what Nebraska did on a Wednesday night in Lincoln.\nWhat they did, of course, was packing 90,000+ fans into a stadium usually set aside for Nebraska football. And most impressively is that there wasn’t really any doubt, once the tickets went on sale, that the event would be a sellout.\nHowever, even knowing that Memorial Stadium was going to be packed, it still would have been impossible to predict just how incredible the environment would be. And once people got to see that environment on their screens (or for the lucky ones, in person) it blew everyone away.\nWhen Magic Johnson is taking note of what the Nebraska Cornhuskers are doing, it’s safe to say that people from all walks of life are taking note.\nNebraska Cornhuskers impress everyone\nAfter the craziness of the event and the chills that ripped through everyone watching and attending the event, this was an actual match for the Nebraska Cornhuskers volleyball team. And they took control of the match against the Omaha Mavericks right from the start.\nWith one set down, there are a few things that Nebraska volleyball fans are still on the lookout for. The first of course is whether or not the Cornhuskers can close things out and win yet another straight-set match.\nAnd then of course, there is whether or not the Nebraska Cornhuskers can set the world record for attendance at a women’s sporting event. They’ve already obliterated women’s volleyball records, but it’s possible women’s soccer could be toppled as well.\nThe official number will be announced between the second and third sets.",
