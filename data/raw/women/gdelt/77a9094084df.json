  "body_text": "Tributes pour in after Pope Francis dies at 88\nThe Argentina-born pontiff was a reformer who rattled the Catholic Church’s conservatives but inspired progressives for his outreach to marginalized groups.\nWhat we know\n- Pope Francis, a reformer who rattled the Catholic Church's conservatives and inspired some progressives, has died after a series of health issues. The Argentina-born pontiff was 88.\n- The cause of death was a stroke that prompted irreversible heart failure, according to a death certificate issued by the Vatican.\n- \"He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with faithfulness, courage, and universal love, especially in favor of the poorest and the marginalized,\" Cardinal Kevin Farrell said in a statement.\n- Francis' body will most likely be transferred to St. Peter's Basilica on Wednesday morning to allow his worshippers to pay their respects, the Vatican said.\n- The College of Cardinals will choose his successor during an upcoming conclave.\n- Tributes are pouring in from around the world, with global leaders offering their condolences.\nChampioning the needs of children for more than a decade\nDuring his papacy, Pope Francis championed the needs of children around the world with humility and sincerity. The pope wanted all children to know they mattered, including the sick and the vulnerable.\nThe plainspoken pope offered youths a sense of belonging and encouraged them to shake things up and make their voices heard.\nFrancis made history in 2015 as first pontiff to address Congress\nOn Sept. 24, 2015, Francis made history as the first pontiff to address Congress. He had come to the Capitol at the invitation of House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, a devout Catholic. In his speech, Francis warned against religious and ideological extremism and said not to be “fearful of foreigners, because most of us were once foreigners.”\n“Your own responsibility as members of Congress is to enable this country, by your legislative activity, to grow as a nation. You are the face of its people, their representatives. You are called to defend and preserve the dignity of your fellow citizens in the tireless and demanding pursuit of the common good, for this is the chief aim of all politics,” Francis told the lawmakers.\n“A political society endures when it seeks, as a vocation, to satisfy common needs by stimulating the growth of all its members, especially those in situations of greater vulnerability or risk.”\nFrancis later stopped in Statuary Hall, where he blessed the statue of Junipero Serra, the 18th century Spanish missionary who founded missions in what is now California. The pope then walked out onto the speaker’s balcony — along with Boehner, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Vice President Joe Biden, all Catholics — and greeted and blessed thousands of well-wishers who had gathered on the National Mall.\nThe next morning, Boehner announced he was resigning as speaker, seeing support in his GOP Conference crumbling and believing nothing could top that moment with the pope.\n“‘Speaker, will you pray for me?’ With those words, Pope Francis changed my life,” Boehner wrote in a tribute on X. “He will forever hold a place in America’s history as the first Pope to address a joint meeting of the US Congress, and in hearts across the world for his compassionate stewardship of the Church.”\nWhat’s the difference between the Holy See and the Vatican?\nThere are quite a few terms unique to the papacy that might be unfamiliar to some people, including the \"Holy See.\"\nThe Holy See is the universal government of the Catholic Church, which is its own sovereign juridical entity under international law and is ruled by the pope. It has its own administrative institutions and diplomatic relations with countries, and it participates in intergovernmental organizations.\nThe Holy See operates inside Vatican City, a city-state within Italy that is technically its own country. It was recognized through a 1929 treaty between Italy and the Holy See.\nVatican City is the smallest country in the world, with a population of roughly 880 people. The pope is also the ruler of Vatican City.\nIn Francis, a pope who met with LGBTQ people and listened\nIn July 2013, Pope Francis posed a question that marked a radical shift in the Catholic Church’s treatment of gay people.\n“If a person is gay and seeks God and has goodwill, who am I to judge him?” he asked reporters in 2013. “Who am I to judge?”\nLGBTQ Catholics and theologians recalled the comment as one of the first Francis made that promoted acceptance of queer people. It was a dramatic departure from the way the previous figureheads of the Holy See and church doctrine had often spoken about gay people, describing homosexuality as “an intrinsic moral evil” and an “objective disorder,” and the relatively accepting tone would go on to become a major theme of Francis’ papacy and, now, his complex legacy.\nThe 266th person in the church's top position\nPope Francis was elected as 266th pope, according to the official count.\nThere have been disputes over who has counted as a pope, including Stephen II, who died of a stroke just four days after his election in 752.\nHe was never consecrated a bishop. Throughout history, the Vatican has both excluded and included him in its official lists.\nPalestinians hold Mass in honor of Pope Francis in Gaza's only Catholic Church\nPalestinians gathered at the Holy Family Church in Gaza City to pay tribute to Pope Francis, who consistently advocated for an end to the war between Israel and Hamas.\nFrancis called the parish every day during the Israel-Hamas war, the Rev. Gabriel Romanelli, the priest at Gaza’s only Catholic church, told an NBC News crew. In his final Mass, on Easter Sunday, the pope once again called for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\"Pope Francis was like a shield for the Christians in Gaza,\" a parishioner said. \"He was the fighter who was fighting for our rights and for our protection.\"\nTrump and first lady to attend papal funeral\nPresident Donald Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, will attend Pope Francis' funeral in Rome, Trump said on his Truth Social account this afternoon.\nHe wrote: \"We look forward to being there!\"\n'He did so many beautiful things in his life'\nSome are praying; some are crying. Others, deep in thought, gaze at St. Peter’s Basilica as Cardinal Mauro Gambetti leads the rosary for Pope Francis in a St. Peter’s Square packed with faithful from all over the world. Among them is Yovana Aguikar, of Cali, Colombia.\n“I was already in Rome when I heard about Pope Francis’ death. It was a huge loss for me and my family. So I came to St. Peter’s to remember him. I’ve been here since this morning,” Aguikar said as those around her continued praying, their focus unwavering.\nFederica Pesch said just after the ceremony ended: “It’s very sad that Pope Francis has died, but he did so many beautiful things in his life, and that’s why we must remember him. Now he is with God. We Christians shouldn’t fear death.”\nShe’s originally from Germany but has lived in Italy for 30 years. Together with her husband, Tobias Wallbrecher, she is the president of the Ricordiamo Insieme Foundation, which works to preserve the memory of the Shoah.\nThey were also in St. Peter’s Square on the day Pope Francis was elected: “I cried a lot. I was so moved, because he’s truly a humble man,” Pesch said before she shared a memory of some months ago, when Francis, speaking from the window, noticed the Israeli flag she and her husband had brought with them and emphasized the importance of the flag as a symbol of peace.\n“Since Oct. 7, we’ve been coming here every Sunday,” Pesch said, glad to say one last goodbye to Francis along with the hundreds of people around her.\nPhotos: Faithful honor Pope Francis at churches around the world\nA solemn requiem today at the Metropolitan Cathedral of the Most Precious Blood, informally known as Westminster Cathedral, in London.\nA woman prays today at the National Sanctuary of Our Lady of Aparecida in Brazil.\nFelicity Mathews, 6, visiting from Ohio, lights a votive candle at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception today in Washington, D.C.\nFIFA chief 'deeply saddened' by death of soccer-loving pope\nPope Francis “always shared his enthusiasm” for soccer “and stressed the important role our sport plays in society,” the head of the sport’s governing body said in a statement on Instagram.\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino said that he was “deeply saddened” to hear of the pope’s death and that he “was privileged enough to spend some time with him on a couple of occasions.”\n“All the prayers of the whole football world are with him,” he added. “May he rest in peace.”\nPope wished to be buried in Rome's Basilica of St. Mary Major\nThe Vatican released the text of Pope Francis' final testament, in which he confirmed his wish to be buried in Rome's Basilica of St. Mary Major.\nFrancis said in his testament, dated in 2022, that that it is where he went for prayer \"to confidently entrust my intentions to the Immaculate Mother and thank Her for her docile and maternal care.\"\n\"May the Lord give the deserved reward to those who have loved me and will continue to pray for me,\" Francis' testament said. \"The suffering that has been present in the last part of my life is offered to the Lord for peace in the world and brotherhood among peoples.\"\nThe Basilica of St. Mary Major, one of four papal basilicas in Rome, is the final resting place of seven other popes. The others are St. Peter’s, St. John Lateran and Paul Outside the Walls.\nWhat is the significance of the confirmation of the pope's death?\nTonight at 8 o’clock in Rome (2 p.m. ET), Cardinal Kevin Farrell began presiding over a ceremony that will formally recognize Pope Francis’ death, during which his body will be placed in a coffin.\nKnown as the “first station” of three stations in the funeral rites for a pope, the ceremony is the first significant moment in the process that will end with the burial of the pope.\nThe confirmation of the pope’s death will happen in the chapel of the Casa Santa Marta, where Francis lived.\nThe Cardinal Camerlengo (Farrell), the dean of the College of Cardinals (Giovanni Battista Re), the master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations (Archbishop Diego Ravelli), “relatives” of Pope Francis (presumably they will include his nurse and one or two other people) and the director of the Vatican City health and hygiene department (Dr. Andrea Arcangeli) will be present.\nThe confirmation of death is a first moment of prayer. The pope’s body will be placed in a coffin made of wood and zinc, and Farrell will sprinkle the body with holy water.\nFarrell will draw up the official act of death, to which he will attach the certificate issued by the health and hygiene director. Ravelli will then decide when access will be granted to those who wish to pray for the pope. He may decide to transfer the coffin privately to another location until it is moved to St. Peter’s Basilica.\nPope Francis died of a stroke and heart failure, death certificate says\nA death certificate issued by the Vatican lists the cause of Pope Francis' death as a stroke that prompted irreversible heart failure.\nThe certificate officially lists the cause of death as cerebral stroke, coma and \"cardiocirculatory collapse.\" Vatican City's health director, Dr. Andrea Arcangeli, signed it.\nIt also lists Francis' health struggles, including the bilateral pneumonia he was recently hospitalized for, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes.\nHis official time of death was 7:35 a.m. local time April 21.\nHundreds gather in Vatican City for holy rosary recitation\nIn a somber scene at St. Peter’s Square, hundreds of mourners sat to hear the recitation of the holy rosary just hours after the announcement of Pope Francis' death.\nCardinal Mauro Gambetti spoke to the crowd about \"Papa Francesco\" just before the recitation.
