Spanish league games ground to a halt for 15 seconds over the weekend. Read on to find out why.\nOn the way:\n- La Liga players rebel\n- Riots cancel Tel Aviv derby\n- MLS post season match-ups\n- USMNT World Cup projection\nPause to protest: Standstill staged in La Liga over U.S. game, broadcasters asked not to show it\nEmpire-building in football has the subtlety of a bulldozer. It runs you over and then tells you it’s good for you. Those it seeks to manipulate tend to shrug or sigh as they bow to the inevitable.\nAdvertisement\nSpain’s La Liga must have hoped as much when it set about taking a regular league fixture to the United States: that the lines of resistance to its big idea would crumble like Nottingham Forest’s faith in a manager. With support from the powers that be, UEFA included, its intentions were as good as a fait accompli — until it transpired that nobody had thought to ask the players.\nLa Liga is not the only division scheming to hold an official match abroad. As it plots to stage Villarreal versus Barcelona in Miami in December — the first time a European league game would be played outside its jurisdiction — Serie A is clearing a path for Como and Milan to meet in Perth, Australia. The clubs are on board, at executive level at least, and so are the authorities, albeit with some reluctance. But the battle for hearts and minds is not going well.\nOver the weekend, La Liga players staged a co-ordinated protest against the controversial initiative, acting on the instructions of their union, the Spanish Footballers’ Association (AFE). At the start of their matches, they stood motionless for the first 15 seconds, refusing to engage. AFE said the action was “symbolic” and a response to “La Liga’s lack of transparency, dialogue and consistency”. La Liga has since called for “a return to useful and constructive dialogue”.\nAFE had said on Friday that Villarreal and Barcelona would not participate in the protest. That made sense, since they are the clubs lined up to play in Miami on December 20. Except when it came to it, their players took a stand and joined in too. “We did it out of respect for our fellow footballers,” said Barca’s Pedri, underlining the strength of opposition La Liga faces.\n‘It will distort the competition’\nLa Liga tried to negate the dissent by instructing TV broadcasters not to show the 15-second strikes. DAZN’s Spanish coverage of Oviedo versus Barcelona showed the outside of the stadium while the teams briefly downed tools. At other games, the coverage cut to aerial shots or a La Liga graphic promoting peace in the Middle East.\nAdvertisement\nThe tactic didn’t work entirely. The protests were referred to by commentators and both Movistar in Spain and DAZN’s English-language coverage broadcast footage of players standing still. A letter sent by La Liga president Javier Tebas to AFE on Thursday, warning of “unwanted consequences”, fell on deaf ears.\nLa Liga is determined to push its proposal through, as is Serie A. Both competitions argue expansion into new markets is essential for their long-term growth. But La Liga in particular is being met with widespread anger. Real Madrid head coach Xabi Alonso claims Villarreal versus Barca on neutral, foreign ground would “distort the competition”. His Barca counterpart, Hansi Flick, described himself as “not happy” and claimed La Liga was essentially calling the shots.\nIn theory, Villarreal and Barca would be turning out in the U.S. two months today. It leaves La Liga with little time to placate all and sundry. It might be that the league simply employs the bulldozers but in doing so, it would ride roughshod over some of its most high-profile stakeholders. Is a match in the States worth the collateral damage?\nNews round-up\n- Less than a week after Maccabi Tel Aviv fans were banned from next month’s Europa League tie at Aston Villa, Israeli police called off yesterday’s Tel Aviv derby between Maccabi and Hapoel because of “public disorder and violent riots”.\n- Lionel Messi bagged Major League Soccer’s golden boot for the second year running, scoring a hat-trick in the last round of regular fixtures. He also finished joint top for assists. We’ve got all the details of the post-season schedule for you here. The wild card matches kick off on Wednesday.\n- The end of the regular MLS season brought some immediate housekeeping at Atlanta United. Head coach Ronny Deila has been sacked. After one win in 18 games, it wasn’t going to end any other way.\n- Three people were arrested following a pitch invasion at a fixture involving Salford City and Oldham Athletic. The invasion was a protest against comments made by Salford co-owner Gary Neville, who said earlier this month that Union flags in the UK were being used by “angry, middle-aged white men” to create division.\n- Hansi Flick will watch Sunday’s El Clasico against Real Madrid from the stands. The Barca boss was sent off during his side’s victory over Girona on Saturday, incurring a touchline ban.\n- We got an upset in the final of the Under-20 World Cup. Morocco defeated Argentina 2-0.\n- Graham Potter is the new Sweden national coach following rapid and positive talks.\nSacking season: Forest axe Postecoglou as EPL total of manager dismissals hits three\nThe bell tolled for Ange Postecoglou on Saturday, and how. He barely made it into the tunnel after a 3-0 defeat by Chelsea before being told he was out of a job. Nottingham Forest’s statement — and get this for unintentional comedy — was as long in words as Postecoglou’s reign was in days (39). He was all but in his car as it dropped.\nHe exits as the shortest-serving manager in Forest’s history, and the second shortest-serving in the history of the Premier League. Conor O’Neill’s recap of the timeline of top-flight dismissals threw up the extraordinary stat that three sackings already this season matches the total tally for 2023-24. I’ll stick my neck out and say we’ve got plenty more to come.\nForest, of course, have been responsible for two sackings: Nuno Espirito Santo and now Postecoglou. In the hunt for the next lucky punter, they’ve spoken to Roberto Mancini — last seen managing in club football in 2018 — but, according to our latest information, appear to be circling round to Sean Dyche. If any of you spot a coherent train of thought here, please let us know.\nAdvertisement\nPostecoglou can only be philosophical about his fate. The natural outcome of any managerial reign is the sack, and there’s no telling who’s next. Liverpool’s defence of their Premier League title is starting to drive Arne Slot to distraction. They’ve forgotten how to defend, and it cost them against Manchester United yesterday. Ruben Amorim, meanwhile, soldiers on, with back-to-back league wins behind him at last after a first United victory at Anfield for nine years. As I’ve asked many times before — who’d be a coach?\nAround TAFC\n- Let’s catch up with the Bellinghams. A photo of Jude suspended in mid-air (above) with a 14kg kettlebell and rubber bands got people talking. And Jobe served up some tasty GIF content with this shocker of a concession, below, in Borussia Dortmund’s Bundesliga defeat by Bayern Munich.\n- Based on current form, Paul Tenorio and Henry Bushnell have done some analysis of how the USMNT squad should look at the World Cup. What caught my eye here was the extent to which attacking berths are wide open.\n- Friday’s quiz answer: the six men who played in 13 or more World Cup games for England were Peter Shilton (17), Bobby Charlton, Bobby Moore, Terry Butcher, Ashley Cole (all 14) and David Beckham (13).\n- Most clicked in Friday’s TAFC: the mooted revamp of college soccer in the States.\nCatch a match\n(Selected games, times ET/UK)\nPremier League: West Ham United vs Brentford, 3pm/8pm — USA Network, Fubo/Sky Sports.\nLa Liga: Alaves vs Valencia, 3pm/8pm — ESPN+, Fubo/Premier Sports.\nSerie A: Cremonese vs Udinese, 2.45pm/7.45pm— CBS, Paramount+, Amazon Prime, DAZN/DAZN.\nAnd finally…\n“And Reyes Cleary has just scored the GOAL OF THE SEASON!” 🗣️\nJust look at those away end limbs 😍 pic.twitter.com/y9lWz9I7lc\n— Barnsley FC (@BarnsleyFC) October 19, 2025\nThe job of seeing out TAFC falls this morning to Barnsley’s Reyes Cleary. His lob, above, against Bradford City in League One on Saturday was so far out that he was virtually on another pitch.\nIt eclipsed David Beckham against Wimbledon in 1996 and it’s got the finishing touch any uber long-range finish needs — a goalkeeper amusingly tangled in the net.
