  "body_text": "Finally. After late collapses, injuries galore, and more than a few abject performances, Liverpool have FINALLY gotten their first win in the WSL this season. Winter reinforcements had a big impact on the match as four winter signings were in the lineup against Spurs, each providing a big boost from their performances. Despite the new faces playing well, and the side overall showing well, it was the much maligned Mia Enderby who played the hero after coming on as a sub. She scored a late brace to take all three points for the first time under Gareth Taylor\nBelow, we take a look at some winners and losers on the night, and attempt to disentangle narrative from fact.\nDigging Deeper Into The Liverpool FC Women’s Win Over Spurs\nA late Mia Enderby brace gave Liverpool their first win of the Gareth Taylor era\nWinners\nMia Enderby\nThe English attacker has long flashed glimpses of the talent that made her a top young prospect when she was signed by Liverpool, but she has failed to really provide any real impact despite ample opportunity. Against Spurs, when the Reds needed a goal, she came on as a late sub and scored two goals in the 94th and 95th minutes. With the brace, she is now second on the team with three goals in the WSL this season.\nCeri Holland\nThe Welsh attacker was a constant threat down the left wing all match. She completed 2 dribbles to beat defenders and earned several fouls due to her pace and tenacity on the ball. She consistently got to the end line and cut the ball back into dangerous area, serving up 4 key passes, including a big chance for Cornelia Kapocs. Holland also got away 3 shots, though she failed to put one on target. Her effort was on both sides of the ball as she also made 4 tackles and 2 interceptions.\nAurélie Csillag\nThe young Swiss attacker was thrown right into the fray with Beata Olsson still working her way back from an injury, and Csillag provided both dynamic attacking output as well as good hold up play. Csillag almost had a dream start, creating an early chance that Alice Bergstrom clanged off the crossbar before putting her own heard on target and forcing a good save. She finished with 2 shots on target from 2 efforts, and also provided 3 key passes.\nCsillag was a threat both on the counter and holding the ball up. She showcased speed, tenacity, and strength on the ball through all phases of play. She pressed well and made dangerous runs on and off the ball. A really exciting performance.\nAttacking Intent\nWe have seen all too often this season where Liverpool has plenty of the ball, but fail to really create much actual attacking output. Against Spurs, the Reds finished with 18 shots, including 6 shots on target. They generated 4 big chances on the day. It was a breath of fresh air to see the ball regularly being played or carried into the box rather than turned back and recycled back to the defense or even the goalkeeper. There’s a time and place to ensure possession is retained, but it has to be coupled with more frequent instances of attacking play as we saw against Spurs.\nClean Sheets\nFor just the second time this season, Liverpool recorded a clean sheet in the league. The midfield and defensive units did a really nice job to limit chances for Spurs, allowing just one shot from distance in the first half. The visitors did get several more cracks at net in the second half, but only one was truly a clear cut opportunity. Jennifer Falk made a fantastic 1v1 save to keep the score level early in the second half for the only shot on target by Spurs.\nDenise O’Sullivan and Fuka Nagano did a great job from midfield to deny many chances through the middle of the pitch, combining for 8 tackles and an interception. Fullbacks Risa Shimizu and Lily Woodham also were constantly closing down attackers before they had a chance to make deliveries from the wings. The team defensive effort left Grace Fisk and Jenna Clark little to do in mop up duty.\nLosers\nLiverpool vs the Woodwork\nIt looked like the Reds might take an early lead after Aurélie Csillag set up Alice Bergstrom at the top of the box, but the Swedes shot came crashing off the crossbar in the opening minutes. Bergstrom was denied again by the woodwork later in the match, seeing a shot from a tight angle come off the post. Ceri Holland also hit the woodwork with a shot later in the match.\nRafaela Borggräfe\nThe German keeper served the last match of her six match ban last weekend against London Bees. Despite being available for selection against Spurs, she was left out of the side completely with Faye Kirby preferred over her as the reserve goalkeeper behind Jennifer Falk.\nDissecting the Narrative\nAfter drawn out negotiations with Manchester City were required to get the services of Gareth Taylor this summer, there was little time for the club to identify transfer targets and complete deals to spend the then world record fee received for Olivia Smith. The Reds entered the season with a thing squad, and were beset by injuries almost immediately. It was obvious the club needed help as they wallowed their way to the bottom of the league in the first half of the season.\nTaylor hinted at a big January transfer window, and FSG has backed the manager with six new signings, including a club record fee for Denise O’Sullivan to help anchor the midfield. There has been an almost instant impact from those players, giving Liverpool hope they can fight their way out of the relegation spot. Despite the win against Spurs, the Reds are still in the last spot by a single point after West Ham also won. There was a tightening between the 9th through 1th spots this weekend however as both Leicester City and Everton also lost. Liverpool are now a point behind both West Ham and Everton, and just two points behind Leicester City.\nWhat Happens Next\nLiverpool’s win over Spurs knocked the visitors out of the fourth spot in the table, with Manchester United sliding up to replace Spurs. Liverpool will now head to Manchester United next Sunday to take on the fourth place team for the second weekend in a row.",
