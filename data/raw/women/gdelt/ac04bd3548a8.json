  "body_text": "Florida State football, recruiting news: FSU set to host 17 blue-chip recruits on campus this weekend\nThe biggest recruiting weekend of the summer starts today.\nFlorida State is set to host 17 blue-chip recruits (rated 4-stars or higher) on campus this weekend for official visit including multiple commitments.\nThis was an excellent throw by Tramell Jones Jr. who has had an excellent showing at the Elite 11:\nFootball:\nAccording to FPI FSU has the brightest future in the ACC (assuming they’re still there).\nScouting the Seminoles: Florida State has the ability to rise under coach Mike Norvell, who is 23-4 the past two seasons and remained in his role despite interest from Alabama in January. Norvell guided FSU to a 13-0 record and its first ACC title since 2014 before the program was snubbed in the final four-team CFP field. Playoff appearances should pile up under Norvell, who has had strong continuity on his staff. FSU also has maneuvered the transfer portal about as well as any program, hitting on players such as defensive linemen Jared Verse and Braden Fiske, both top-40 picks in the 2024 NFL draft. The Seminoles have been a volume portal team, adding key transfers this offseason such as quarterback DJ Uiagalelei (Oregon State), edge rusher Marvin Jones Jr. (Georgia), defensive lineman Sione Lolohea (Oregon State) and cornerbacks Earl Little II (Alabama), Davonte Brown (Miami) and Omarion Cooper (Colorado).\nHere’s how schools might handle the House v. NCAA settlement.\nBruce Feldman has FSU at No.3 in his 12-team playoff projection.\n3. Florida State: Ready to reload with a chip on its shoulder\nEven with a ton of guys gone to the NFL, Mike Norvell has a squad ready to reload and make the expanded postseason — especially after last season’s drama. Only eight starters return, but the buzz inside the program is high about how ready some of the new starters are to break out. Patrick Payton leads a very talented defensive front and has Marvin Jones Jr., the Georgia transfer, across from him; I’m told he’s ready to have a monster season. Miami transfer Darrell Jackson is a massive presence. Watch out for CB Azareye’h Thomas, who could make a run at All-American honors.\nOther Sports:\nFSU Baseball’s incredible year-2 turnaround proved it deserves among the elite; now can they take the next step?\nAn excellent way to cap his career:\nSophomore Bella Bugg is on her way to the US Amateur Open; nicely done, Bella:\nAlumni:\nJameis Winston is a big Buster Posey fan\n- Florida State Baseball\n- Florida State Football\n- Florida State football news\n- Florida State Football Recruiting\n- Florida State football schedule\n- Florida State Men's Basketball\n- Florida State men's basketball news\n- Florida State softball\n- Florida State Softball news\n- Florida State Women's basketball\n- Florida State women's basketball news\n- FSU Football Practice Reports",
