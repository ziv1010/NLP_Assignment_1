Ted Cruz and Democratic challenger Colin Allred will face off in The Texas Debate tonight on WFAA.\n\"The Texas Debate\" between the two candidates will begin at 7 p.m. Oct. 15 at WFAA's studio, and it will be broadcast across Texas. Three weeks before Election Day on Nov. 5, it will be the only debate between Cruz and Allred.\nIn addition to airing on WFAA, the debate will be livestreamed on the WFAA+ app. The streaming app is available for download on Roku, Apple TV and Amazon Fire, as well as on iPhone and Android.\nCoverage started on WFAA+ at 3 p.m., and there will also be analysis immediately following the debate. Also, we’ll have live coverage and recaps of the debate on WFAA.com, as well as additional context and background on each candidate and their platforms.\nFollow the latest updates from the debate here:\nCruz: In Texas, there's a lot of consensus on abortion\nSen. Ted Cruz, opening on the issue of abortion, said Texans overwhelmingly support parents having to consent before their child can get abortion, and that abortions in the eighth and ninth month of pregnancy are too extreme, and that taxpayer money shouldn't pay for abortions.\nBut Cruz also said Allred rejects those consensuses, and voted in favor of striking down legislation surrounding parental consent and late-term abortions.\nAllred: Sen. Cruz just looked into the camera and lied to Texans about my positions\nAllred asked Cruz to explain why it's reasonable to force 26,000 women to give birth to their rapist's child under Texas law.\n\"When I'm in U.S. Senate, we'll restore a woman's right to choose,\" Allred said. \"We'll make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again.\"\nAllred repeatedly said that Cruz is \"not pro-life\" on the issue of abortion, as the two traded barbs on the opening question of the debate.\nAllred: I believe in physical barriers\nAllred said he believes in physical barriers as part of a comprehensive strategy to secure the southern border. He also said he wants to fix the U.S.'s current legal immigration system.\n\"Time and again, Sen. Cruz treats our border communities like he's going on some kind of safari,\" Allred said. \"He goes back to Washington and does nothing to help.\"\nAllred accused Cruz of not voting in favor of \"the toughest border security bill in a generation\" when it came up in Congress.\nCruz: I hear about illegal immigration everywhere I go\nCruz said that Congress produced the lowest rate of illegal immigration in 45 years working hand-in-hand with President Donald Trump, and said it didn't take a bill for Allred, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to break the border.\nCruz also claimed Allred doesn't hear about illegal immigration much around Dallas, and said he hears about it all over the state.\nCruz: Inflation is caused by the policies of Kamala Harris and Congressman Allred\nWhen asked about insurance needing a federal solution, both Cruz and Allred agreed it's better handled at a state level. But Cruz went on to talk about inflation, saying that Democrats under Biden spent trillions they didn't have and borrowed trillions from China they didn't have. And said that when he and others said it would drive up inflation, they didn't care.\n\"The inflation caused by Harris and Allred's spending binge is hurting Texans across the board,\" Cruz said.\nAllred: I voted on capping the cost of Insulin, Cruz didn't\nAllred said he was focused on lowering the costs of things like healthcare and housing, and that when he voted to cap the cost of insulin, Cruz voted against it. He also pointed out that Cruz is one of the biggest recipients of donations from pharmaceutical industry lobbyists.\n\"This is someone who goes to the Ritz Carlton in Cancun, do you really think he cares about inflation?\" Allred asked.\nCruz: Allred voted in favor of allowing drag shows on military bases\nWhen asked about transgender issues, Allred didn't speak specifically in favor of any issue. Cruz accused Allred of supporting a bill that would allow drag shows on military bases, and to use taxpayer money on sex changes for soldiers, and to pay for children to be sterilized and to have sex changes on military bases.\nAllred: Folks should not be discriminated against\nAllred said he didn't support boys playing in girls sports but didn't say whether he supported transgender girls playing in girls sports.\n\"What I think is that folks should not be discriminated against,\" Allred said. \"What Sen. Cruz should explain to you is why he thinks they should.\"\nCruz: \"Anyone who commits an act of violence should be prosecuted, should go to jail.\"\nWhen asked whether the rioters on Jan. 6, 2021 at the Capitol should be prosecuted, Cruz said anyone who was violent then should be, whether he agrees with their politics or not.\nCruz then shifted to defunding the police, which he said Allred voted in favor of twice. He said since the movement to defund the police began, murder rates have gone up in multiple cities, including in Dallas by 17%. The police in Dallas have not been defunded, their funding has increased in that time.\nAllred: \"Israel has a right to defend themselves.\"\nAllred, when asked about the Oct. 7 attack, called it a horrific terrorist attack, the worst against Jewish people since the holocaust. He said it's time to reach a settlement to bring hostages home and that Hamas must be held accountable.\nHe also said that Cruz had voted against a bill that would have provided funding to Israel, as well as to Taiwan and Ukraine.\nCruz: I am proud to stand with Israel\nCruz accused Allred of consistently lining up against Israel and said the bill he voted against would provide money to Gaza. He said he also voted in favor of a bill providing emergency weapons to Israel, and said Allred voted against it.\nCruz also accused student protesters of anti-Semitism. He said if they threaten Jewish students they should be expelled, arrested, and if they're from another country, they should be deported.\nCruz: World Court and International Court of Justice filled with anti-Semites\nWhen asked if Israel bears any responsibility for the tens of thousands of civilian deaths in Gaza, Cruz said there is no country on Earth that fights a more humane, more targeted and more just war than the people of Israel. When asked about the findings from the World Court and the International Court of Justice, Cruz accused them of being filled with anti-Semites.\nAllred: I'll bring back child tax credits and cut taxes for the middle class\nAfter pointing out that Allred didn't co-sign a letter by Democrats to Biden to use executive authority to lower food prices, Allred was asked what his idea was to lower food prices. He said there is sometimes price-gouging going on and ongoing supply chain and consumption issues from the pandemic.\nAllred further stated he wants to bring back the child tax credit, which he said lifted millions of Texans out of food insecurity and that Cruz opposed. He also said he would invest in a new generation of housing to increase the supply and lower the overall cost of housing.\nCruz: \"We need parents to get back to work.\"\nCruz said he was behind pushing for a child tax credit with Trump's tax cuts in 2017, but that the Democrats wanted to relax the work requirement on parents to get that credit.\n\"We need parents to get back to work,\" Cruz said.\nAllred: Our economic output has been in spite of Ted Cruz\nAllred brought up that he helped pass a bill bringing a $35 billion investment into infrastructure into Texas, that Cruz voted against. He also brought up the CHIPS and Science Act, which he said would bring back high-tech manufacturing to Texas and the country, which he said Cruz also voted against.\n\"Our economic output has been in spite of him,\" Allred said.\nAllred: Cruz is singularly responsible for how things are in Washington D.C. now\nIn his closing statement, Allred called Cruz one of the most divisive senators in the entire country.\n\"He has introduced this new kind of 'anger-tainment' where you just get people upset, and then you podcast about it, and you write a book about it and you make some money on it,\" Allred said. \"But you're not actually there when people need you, like when the lights went out.\"\nWhen 30 million Texans lost power during the 2021 winter storm, Allred said Cruz went to Cancun while Texans were relying on him to go into action.\n\"That's who he is,\" Allred said.\nCruz: Colin Allred wants to destroy what we've got in Texas\nIn his closing statement, Cruz accused Allred of running on a radical agenda with Kamala Harris and said this election had the highest stakes of his lifetime. He said Allred had pledged to vote to end the filibuster in Congress, and to add Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico as states to add four Democratic senators.\nCruz also accused Allred of wanting to pack the U.S. Supreme Court, and of wanting to grant immediate voting rights to every undocumented immigrant in America.\n\"That would turn Texas blue and every statewide official in Texas would be defeated,\" Cruz said. \"Colin Allred wants to destroy what we've got in Texas. I will fight to keep Texas Texas.\"\nAllred and Cruz arrive for the debate\nCongressman Colin Allred has arrived at WFAA's studio ahead of The Texas Debate against Sen. Ted Cruz. The debate is set to get underway at 7 p.m.\nSen. Ted Cruz has arrived at WFAA studio ahead of The Texas Debate against Democrat challenger Colin Allred.\nWhat's at stake in the Texas Senate election?\nAllred is hoping to unseat the incumbent Cruz, in a seemingly close race that could have a major impact on the Senate for years to come.\nThe Senate is closely split at the moment, with the Democrats only having a slight majority -- 51 Democrats to 49 Republicans. Whoever wins their Senate seat will have it for some time, as senators have six-year long terms, the longest of any elected officials in the U.S.\nThere are 34 Senate seats up for grabs this November, 23 of which are held by Democrats or Independents. This election represents a major opportunity for Republicans to seize back control of the upper chamber of Congress. So the Democrats will have to either hold onto their seats up for grabs, or manage to unseat the Republican senators that are up for election.\nOne of those seats is that of Cruz. Since 2013, Cruz has represented Texas in the Senate. This is his third time running, and his second time running for re-election after he beat Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke in a shockingly close race in 2018.\nThe format and rules of the debate\nWFAA met with both campaigns on Tuesday to do a coin toss determining the order of opening and closing statements. Rep. Allred won the toss and chose to start the opening statements. As a result, Sen. Cruz will conclude the debate with his closing statement.\nHere are the rules agreed upon by both campaigns:\n- Candidates will get 60 seconds to introduce themselves\n- Candidates will get 90 seconds to answer a question\n- The opponent will then get 90 seconds to respond\n- The first candidate will then get 60 seconds for rebuttal\n- Moderators will have a 60-second follow-up if needed\n- At the end of the hour, candidates will get 60 seconds to make their final pitch to voters\nTed Cruz vs. Colin Allred debate studio tour\nWFAA is hosting The Texas Debate between Ted Cruz and Colin Allred on Tuesday night at 7 p.m. Jason Whitely, WFAA senior political reporter and one of the moderators of the debate, gives a tour of the debate studio and setup -- take a look:\nAnd here's a look inside the studio at the podiums where both candidates will stand:\nCruz, Allred release pre-debate statements\nOn Tuesday morning, Allred's campaign released a statement ahead of the debate. Here's what he said:\n\"Tonight Texans will see a very clear choice between Congressman Allred's commitment to working with both parties to actually serve Texans and protect women's abortion rights and Ted Cruz's divisive lies and antics,\" Allred campaign manager Paige Hutchinson said. \"Texans are fed up with Cruz. From his career-long fight to enact the most extreme abortion laws to his refusal to fix the border and decision to abandon Texans during a deadly winter freeze for a Cancun vacation -- when it matters the most, Cruz will always put himself first.\"\nAllred also shared a campaign ad featuring Kate Cox, the Dallas woman who sued and fled the state in December to get an abortion after she learned her fetus had a lethal fetal anomaly, ahead of the debate.\nCruz's campaign didn't release an official statement but did share a post on social media calling out Allred.\n\"Colin Allred says one thing, his actions say another,\" the post read. \"Colin Allred is too liberal for Texas.\"\nCruz also touted his Monday endorsement from former President Donald Trump on social media.\nWhere Ted Cruz and Colin Allred stand in fundraising ahead of the debate\nLast week, U.S. Rep. Colin Allred, who’s challenging incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, announced he raised $30.3 million for his campaign in the third quarter of this year, outpacing Cruz’s haul by about $9 million during the same period.\nWhere Ted Cruz and Colin Allred stand in the polls ahead of the debate\nThe latest survey by the Hobby School of Public Affairs at the University of Houston showed Cruz leading Allred 50% to 46%.\nPolls have consistently shown Cruz with a slight lead in the Senate race throughout the campaign, but the latest poll shows Cruz widening his lead.\nAllred campaign debate watch party\nDallas County Young Democrats are hosting a debate watch party from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. at the Angelika Film Center in Mockingbird Station.\nCruz campaign watch party\nThe Cruz campaign is hosting a debate watch party from 6 to 9 p.m. at the Rustic in Uptown.\nWhat to know about Ted Cruz\nCruz was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father before his family moved to Houston when he was a young child.\nAfter graduating from a private high school in 1988 as valedictorian, Cruz attended Princeton University, where he studied public policy. He then graduated from law school at Harvard University.\nThroughout his career, Cruz has clerked for several judges, including former Chief Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist, worked on George W. Bush's presidential campaign, and served as Texas' attorney general before he won his Senate seat in 2012.\nWhat to know about Colin Allred\nAllred was born and raised in Dallas, attending Hillcrest High School in North Dallas and Baylor University in Waco on a football scholarship.\nHe was a linebacker for the Tennessee Titans for five seasons before sustaining a career-ending injury.\nAllred attended law school at the University of California Berkeley School of Law and worked as a civil rights attorney before he entered politics.\nHe defeated 22-year Republican incumbent Pete Sessions in 2018 to win his seat in Congress representing Texas 32nd District, encompassing parts of Dallas, Collin and Denton counties.",
