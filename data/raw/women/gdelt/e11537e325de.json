  "body_text": "The Road to Milan-Cortina: The Northern California athletes eyeing the 2026 Winter Olympics\nWith one month left until the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, many of the world's top athletes are still competing for a spot, including those trying to make Team USA.\nEach returning Olympian and Olympic hopeful has a unique story to tell on the path to Italy, including some who call Northern California home.\nFrom coming out of retirement to juggling parenthood, watch our full special highlighting athletes from the region in the video player above.\nBelow are some of the athletes profiled in the special.\nAlysa Liu\nArguably one of the biggest names in the figure skating world, Alysa Liu of Oakland is a prime example of proving \"quitters never win\" does not apply to everyone.\nShe became the youngest U.S. figure skating champ at age 13 and competed in the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. And at age 16, she decided to retire from figure skating to live the life of a normal teenager.\nDuring a two-year gap where she hung out with friends, traveled the world and attended college. While enrolled at UCLA, she picked up skiing, which soon made her miss her time on the ice rink.\nAnd this time, she actually found joy in figure skating. Her comeback was massive, as she trained for only seven months before winning the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships.\nBryce Bennett\nBryce Bennett has multiple titles to his name. Olympian, Tahoe City resident, but the one he takes the most pride in is one he most recently acquired: father.\nHe and his wife, Kelley, welcomed their first child, a daughter, in the spring of 2025. And fatherhood is not slowing him down.\nIn fact, the two-time Olympic skier is hoping to make the team a third time. At age 33, he has spent nearly half his life on the U.S. Ski Team. He hopes to create the perfect memory for his daughter years down the line.\n\"My ideal like story would be have an insane season this year. Win the Olympics. And then you just take all of your trophies and put them in a box and put them deep in the basement. And then go on and live your life and raise your kids, and then one day she'll be like, opening up boxes and be like, 'What's this?' And you'll be like, 'Oh, back in the day. I did this one thing, you know,'\" Bennett said.\nJamie Anderson\nGold medalist Jamie Anderson may be the coolest mom ever, with some serious achievements.\nThe 35-year-old South Lake Tahoe snowboarder is a three-time Olympian with two gold and one silver medal; she has the most X Games hardware of any woman in history and the second-most winter medals of any athlete; she is a five-time ESPY Female Action Sports Award winner; and last — but certainly not least — she is a mother to two daughters.\nIn fact, Anderson became the Big Air National champion after a three-year break to have her second daughter. But now she's back and aiming to compete in the Olympic Games for the fourth time.\nKeely Cashman\nRepresenting the Tuolumne County community of roughly 85 people, Strawberry's Keely Cashman is a small-town alpine skier with big dreams.\nThe 2022 Olympian and eight-year member of the U.S. Ski Team seeks to once again defy both gravity and expectations. Cashman seeks to inspire the next generation and prove that one does not have to \"come from a fancy academy to make it to the Olympics.\"\nBecause ski racing is a very expensive sport, Cashman's family had to get creative to fund her ambitions. Her father was a coach, which covered some of the costs.\nThe rest? It's fueled by the Serene Bean, which her family has run for 28 years. Cashman also happens to be the town's favorite barista for that reason.\nSee more coverage of top California stories here | Download our app | Subscribe to our morning newsletter | Find us on YouTube here and subscribe to our channel",
