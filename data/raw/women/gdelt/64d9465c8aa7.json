Metaxas does not seem to know that in his Christology lectures in 1933 Bonhoeffer claimed, “The biblical witness is uncertain with regard to the virgin birth.” Bonhoeffer also rejected the notion of the verbal inspiration of scripture, and in a footnote to Cost of Discipleship he warned against viewing statements... -\nAstronomy Picture of the Day - Crossing Saturn's Ring Plane\nExplanation: If this is Saturn, where are the rings? When Saturn's \"appendages\" disappeared in 1612, Galileo did not understand why. Later that century, it became understood that Saturn's unusual protrusions were rings and that when the Earth crosses the ring plane, the edge-on rings will appear to disappear. This is because Saturn's rings are confined to a plane many times thinner, in proportion, than a razor blade. In modern times, the robotic Cassini spacecraft that orbited Saturn frequently crossed Saturn's ring plane during its mission to Saturn, from 2004 to 2017. A series of plane crossing images from 2005 February... -\nSCOTT JENNINGS: Trump didn't tell Marjorie Taylor Greene not to run for Senate\n🚨 BREAKING: SCOTT JENNINGS on President Trump and Marjorie Taylor Greene \"[Trump] didn't tell her not to run [for Senate]. What she didn't say was that he sent her a poll privately, discreetly, and it had information in it. And it showed her down 20 points to Sen. Jon Ossoff.\" \"In politics, when you want to send a message to someone that you like or that has been an ally, you don't embarrass them publicly. You privately send them information and show them what the reality is.\" \"I think it's true that he didn't tell her not to run, but... -\nUSS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier arrives in Caribbean in major buildup near Venezuela\nThe most advanced aircraft carrier in the nation crossed into the Caribbean Sea on Sunday, the U.S. Navy said, marking a major buildup in the region. The arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford marks a major moment in what the Trump administration says is a counterdrug operation but has been seen as an escalating pressure tactic against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. has asserted that Maduro is complicit with armed criminal gangs that smuggle drugs into the U.S., allegations that Maduro has rejected. And over the last two months, the U.S. military has conducted strikes against at least... -\nFinland’s president urges Europe to hold its nerve as he warns no ceasefire likely soon in Ukraine\nA ceasefire in Ukraine is unlikely before the spring and European allies need to keep up support despite a corruption scandal that has engulfed Kyiv, President Alexander Stubb of Finland told The Associated Press. Europe, meanwhile, will require ‘’sisu,’’ a Finnish word meaning endurance, resilience and grit, to get through the winter months, he said, as Russia continues its hybrid attacks and information war across the continent. Stubb also needs that quality as one of the key European interlocutors between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As the leader of one of Europe’s smaller countries, but one... -\nCity Will Rename Street in Honor of Charlie Kirk\nA city in California will rename a street in honor of Charlie Kirk, the pro-life conservative speaker and activist who was assassinated. Westminster City Council voted 4-1 this past week to rename a portion of All American Way as Charlie Kirk Way, honoring the late conservative activist and founder of Turning Point USA as a champion of free speech and civic engagement. The change applies to street signs along the section of All American Way between Westminster Boulevard and 13th Street, which runs parallel to the Vietnam War Memorial. Kirk’s name will appear in 3-inch font below the official street... -\nTrump to Sue BBC for $5 Billion for Doctored Speech\nPresident Donald Trump has confirmed he intends to sue the BBC for up to $5 billion over a Panorama broadcast that used an edited version of one of his speeches.

Trump added that Prime Minister Keir Starmer was \"very embarrassed\" by the incident and said he planned to speak with Sir Starmer during the weekend. Earlier this month, The Telegraph reported that Panorama had... -\nOJ Simpson estate signs off on $58M for Ron Goldman’s father, decades after shocking double murder\nFred Goldman may be closer to finally receiving payment from OJ Simpson’s estate nearly three decades after winning a wrongful death judgment against the former football great who was acquitted of killing his son. Malcolm LaVergne, the executor of the Simpson estate, has accepted Goldman’s creditor claim for $57,997,858.12 plus ongoing judgment interest, TMZ reported on Saturday. The news site reports that the figure was agreed to following negotiations between the estate and Goldman, whose son Ron was killed alongside Simpson’s ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, in June 1994. -\nSaudi Arabia Building Its AI Empire to Shift Power Beyond Oil | Firstpost Tech & Trade | N18G\nSaudi Arabia is undergoing a historic transformation — shifting its power base from oil to artificial intelligence. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is investing billions to turn the kingdom into a global AI hub, building vast data centers, launching tech firms like Humain, and partnering with U.S. giants such as Nvidia and Amazon. Through megaprojects like NEOM and a national AI strategy, Saudi Arabia aims to become the world’s third-largest AI power, redefining its identity from energy exporter to digital innovator.

Brian Glenn, chief WH correspondent for pro-Trump outlet Real America's Voice, was dragged into the MAGA meltdown for declaring his love for his girlfriend online. 'I love this woman. I love this country. God bless America,' he wrote on Saturday night with four loved-up photos of the couple together. That was enough for self-appointed loyalty enforcer Laura Loomer to declare: 'Nobody cares, simp! Trump should revoke your White House press pass!' Greene frequently criticized the president... -\nRep. Moore: Christians in Nigeria are murdered at a 5-to-1 rate compared to other religions.\nRep. Riley M.

The bill would force the Justice Department to release all files and communications related to Epstein, as well as any information about the investigation into his death in federal prison. Information about Epstein’s victims or ongoing federal investigations would be allowed to be redacted. “There... -\nMassie predicts a ‘deluge’ of House Republicans will vote to release Epstein files\nRep.

Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), led a successful discharge petition, which teed up a House vote seeking to compel the Trump administration to release more information about Epstein. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said the lower chamber is... -\nDoctored Footage Fallout: Trump vs. the BBC\nTrump’s lawsuit over the BBC’s doctored Jan. 6 clip now threatens to turn the broadcaster’s license-fee crisis into a full-blown reckoning over trust, bias, and billions.It costs £174.50 a year to obtain a BBC license for a color TV. Technological atavists who are bargain-hunting can snag a license for a black and white TV for only £58.50 per year. For the year ending March 2025, the license fee raised £3.8 billion, 65 percent of the Beeb’s total income.There is growing resentment about the fee. “Some people ask,” said one news report, “why they should be forced to pay for the... -\nMarjorie Taylor Greene insists she still supports Trump — while repeatedly slamming him in bonkers interview after Epstein fight(back on CNN)\nWASHINGTON — Firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene insisted Sunday that she still supports President Trump despite his epic takedown of her — while simultaneously questioning his MAGA bona fides in a madcap interview. While making overtures to end her red-hot feud with Trump, 79, Greene, 51, repeatedly slammed the president, accusing him of not being focused enough on the US and putting Americans first. \" I do support him and his administration, and I support them in delivering the campaign promises we made to the American people,” Greene (R-GA) told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “His remarks, of... -\nTrump Threatens To Replace RINO Indiana Republicans Who Won't Redistrict\nPresident Donald Trump slammed Indiana Republican lawmakers who don’t plan to redistrict the state.Trump says the state can add two more U.S. House seats for Republicans, he posted on social media.“Very disappointed in Indiana State Senate Republicans, led by RINO Senators Rod Bray and Greg Goode, for not wanting to redistrict their State, allowing the United States Congress to perhaps gain two more Republican seats. The Democrats have done redistricting for years, often illegally, and all other appropriate Republican States have done it.”In November, California voters passed Proposal 50, which aims to give Democrats more seats in the U.S. House.The... -\nRep.

Gavin Newsom’s office acknowledged the revocations but rejected the claim that they were illegal immigrants. It said they were booted because of “inconsistency” with state law.“After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now... -\nReport: More Than 70 Percent of Palisades Fire Victims Still in Temporary Housing [CA]\nMore than 70 percent of people who were affected by the Palisades Fire in California from January are still living in temporary housing, according to a report.
