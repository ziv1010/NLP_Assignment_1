Local vendor Luo Tianle said his stall had launched 50 to 60 new World Cup items, including plush toys, daily necessities and souvenirs.\n\"The new products have secured orders exceeding 1 million yuan (about 144,000 U.S. dollars) within just one week of their launch,\" Luo said.\nRenowned for their quality and affordability, \"Made in Yiwu\" products consistently capture market attention during major sporting events. Many businesses began their preparations for the North American tournament as early as May 2025.\nVendor Wen Congjian, who sold over 2 million of his original-design jerseys for the 2022 Qatar World Cup, is now expanding his product range.\nFor 2026, he has introduced jerseys for women, children, and even pets. \"We aim to diversify our products, giving fans more choices,\" he explained.\nBeyond their new designs, vendors are now securing intellectual property rights. Chen Shaomei's self-designed commemorative footballs have attracted substantial numbers of overseas orders. Protected by design patents, these footballs yield roughly 15 percent higher profit margins than generic ones.\nDespite the approaching Chinese New Year holiday, Chen's factory is operating at full capacity. \"Workers are staying later this year. Our order volume is about 30 percent higher than previous years,\" he noted.\nSimilar scenes are unfolding at a similar facility operated by another sporting goods company, where production lines are running nonstop. \"Orders related to the World Cup are picking up as the event draws nearer,\" said Wu Xiaoming, the company's manager and head of the Yiwu sporting goods association.\nWu, who gained online fame during the last World Cup for producing 100,000 footballs in just 50 days, has experienced six World Cups over his two-decade career.\nFacing fierce competition, Wu is shifting his focus from low prices to diversified branding and premium product upgrades. His company now participates in setting industry standards, supplies the official balls for provincial tournaments and partners with foreign football clubs.\nWu believes the era of competing solely on price is over. \"The focus now is on high-quality development. I hope all businesses can find their direction amid this boom,\" he said.\nAccording to Yiwu Customs, the city's exports of sports equipment and goods grew 20.3 percent year on year to a total of 11.65 billion yuan in 2025, with major destination markets including the United States, Brazil and Saudi Arabia.\nRegardless of the host nation in each tournament, Yiwu has remained a constant supplier of World Cup merchandise. Wu attributes this to the city's unique strengths in product variety, rapid market response and competitive logistics costs.\n\"To stand out, you must specialize, becoming irreplaceable to justify your quality and price,\" Wu said.\nShares\nShare\nTweet\nShare\nFlip\nEmail\nGet a daily dose of Brazil Sun news through our daily email, its complimentary and keeps you fully up to date with world and business news as well.\nPublish news of your business, community or sports group, personnel appointments, major event and more by submitting a news release to Brazil Sun.\nMore InformationFBI Director Kash Patel's announcement on January 23 regarding the arrest of Canadian drug trafficker Ryan Wedding in Mexico led to...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: Tired of the bullying, bluster, and threats from U.S. President Donald Trump with regard to tariffs, countries that...\nHANGZHOU, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- With just four months to go before the 2026 FIFA World Cup opens in North America, China's wholesale...\nBEIJING, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- From cherries to electric cars, China and Latin American countries have seen closer mutually beneficial...\nMoscow [Russia], February 10 (ANI): Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov took a dig at the United States in an interview with TV...\n(Photo credit: Mike Frey-Imagn Images) Sebastian Korda got a small measure of revenge by defeating Michael Zheng 6-4, 6-4 in an all-U.S....\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: A former innovation unit of the U.S. government's foreign aid agency has resurfaced as an independent nonprofit,...\nSEOUL: A routine promotional campaign at South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb spiralled into chaos after a technical error...\nNEW YORK, New York - Technology stocks extended Friday's gains on Monday, pushed higher by shares in AI companies such as Nvidia and...\nANTERSELVA, Italy: As the world's attention turns to the Winter Games, the north Italian valley of Antholz-Anterselva is bracing for...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: As Republicans head toward a high-stakes midterm election year, Donald Trump has positioned himself as the party's...\nWASHINGTON, D.C./NEW DELHI: In two moves expected to significantly shape U.S.–India relations, President Donald Trump scrapped the...",
