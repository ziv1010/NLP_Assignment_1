  "body_text": "Women's transfer news: Brighton snap up Japan striker; Lyon bag top goal-scorer\n- Bayern Munich midfielder joins Aston Villa on loan\n- West Ham sign Germany youth international\n- Plus other transfer updates\nWe are now into the second week of this summer's women's football transfer window, and it’s certainly been as busy as the first, as we start to see more clubs get involved.\nThe opening of the window was hotly anticipated, and as it neared there were a handful of high-profile players up for grabs. Over the last few days, their next moves have been confirmed.\nOne of the most exciting announcements came from Manchester City, who confirmed the signing of Women's Super League all-time top scorer Vivianne Miedema, after her shock exit from rivals Arsenal in May.\nNext up, England international Fran Kirby revealed she is on her way to Brighton & Hove Albion. The Seagulls are certainly not letting the departure of Katie Robinson and potential exit of top-scorer Elisabeth Terland get them down, and instead Kirby’s arrival marks their third signing of the summer.\nThe WSL's reigning champions Chelsea have also been keeping busy, and this week confirmed the arrival of Barcelona’s Julia Bartel, amid reports that Lucy Bronze is also set to join on a free transfer. The addition of two Barcelona starlets will most definitely help ease the loss of midfielder Melanie Leupolz, who revealed her exit to Real Madrid.\nElsewhere, Manchester United confirmed the arrival of former Wolfsburg and Arsenal defender Dominique Janssen, while Spain forward Mariona Caldentey signed on the dotted line for the Gunners.\nKeep scrolling for more transfer news that you may have missed.\nAston Villa recruit Bayern Munich midfielder\nNetherlands international Jill Baijings has become Aston Villa's first addition of the summer window, as she joins on loan from Bayern Munich.\nThis marks Robert de Pauw’s first signing since being named head coach, and the move will see the pair be reunited after previously working together at Bayer Leverkusen.\nThe 23-year-old has also enjoyed previous stints with Heerenveen and SGS Essen, as well as being capped eight times by the Dutch national team.\nThe news comes in the same week that the club also confirmed the contract extension of goalkeeper Anna Leat, until June 2025 with the option to extend for a further year.\nWest Ham sign and loan out Germany youth international\nGermany Under-19 international Shekiera Martinez is set to join West Ham on a three-year contract.\nThe 22-year-old arrives from Fruaen-Bundesliga side Eintracht Frankfurt, where she has spent the last eight years from the academy team to the seniors. Martinez will immediately head back to her homeland to join SC Freiburg on loan for the 2024/25 campaign, where she will accumulate the necessary points to meet the governing body endorsement criteria for international player visas.\nThe signing marks manager Rehanne Skinner’s second deal of the summer transfer window, after the arrival of Poland goalkeeper Kinga Szemik.\nBrighton add new striker to the mix\nJapan international Kiko Seike has been recruited by Brighton & Hove Albion for an undisclosed fee.\nThe striker has spent the last 15 years at WE League side Urawa Reds, and will link up with the Seagulls when she returns from the Olympics, in time for the start of the next WSL season in September.\nA week prior, Brighton also confirmed the arrival of Dutch defender Maria Olislagers, who’s spent the last six seasons competing in the Eredivisie for FC Twente.\nThis takes Brighton’s total signings this summer to three, including their most recent arrival Fran Kirby.\nLyon bag elite goal-scorer from under PSG's noses\nStriker Tabitha Chawinga has signed a three-year deal with Lyon, after spending last season on loan at PSG from Chinese outfit Wuhan Jianghan University.\nThe Malawi captain scored 19 times in 21 French D1 league games for PSG. League champions Lyon pipped Les Parisiens to the title in the 2023/24 campaign.\nSandy Baltimore departs PSG\nForward Sandy Baltimore has officially confirmed her exit from PSG, following the expiration of her contract.\n90min reported last month that the 24-year-old was expected to pen a four-year deal with Chelsea. Baltimore has spent her entire career with the French club, breaking into the team back in 2016 at the age of 15, and had more than 150 appearances under her belt.",
