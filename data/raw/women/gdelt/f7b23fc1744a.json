  "body_text": "Spain’s Women’s players will reject call-ups to the national team until the leadership of the Spanish FA (RFEF) is changed following the actions of president Luis Rubiales at the World Cup final.\nRubiales faced calls to quit after kissing striker Jenni Hermoso on the lips and grabbing his crotch in celebration shortly after the final whistle as Spain beat England on Sunday. He apologised for grabbing his crotch but maintained that the kiss was consensual, saying it was “the same as the one I would give to one of my daughters”.\nAdvertisement\nHermoso has denied she consented to the kiss, saying she “will not tolerate that my word is doubted”.\nA letter signed by 81 players, including the entire World Cup-winning squad, described the actions of Rubiales as “violating the dignity of women”.\nGO DEEPER\n'My ears are bleeding': How the world reacted to Rubiales’ speech\nIn the joint statement, released on Friday via the players’ union Futpro, the players said: “As a result of this morning’s events, and in light of the perplexing speech delivered by the president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) Luis Rubiales, the players of Spain’s women’s senior team, recent world champions, in support of Jennifer Hermoso, want to express their firm and resounding condemnation of behaviours that have violated the dignity of women.\n“In view of the statements made by the RFEF president, Jennifer Hemoso wants to categorically deny that she consented to the kiss that Luis Rubiales gave her after the World Cup final: ‘I want to clarify that, as seen in the images, at no time did I consent to the kiss that he gave me and of course, in no case did I seek to lift up the president [Rubiales said she did]. I will not tolerate that my word is doubted, much less words that I have not said invented.’\n“From our union, we want to emphasise that no woman should find herself in a position where she is required to provide answers about indisputable images that everyone has seen and of course, they should not be involved in non-consensual actions.\nGO DEEPER\nSpain won the Women's World Cup - but Luis Rubiales has made me ashamed to be Spanish\n“The players of the Spanish national team, current world champions, await forceful responses from the public authorities so that actions such as those described here do not go unpunished.\n“We want to end this statement by asking for real structural change that helps the national team to continue growing, in order to transfer this great success to later generations.\n“It fills us with sadness that such an unacceptable event is managing to tarnish the greatest sporting success of Spanish women’s football. After everything that happened during the Women’s World Cup medal ceremony, we want to state that all the players who sign this letter will not return to a call-up from the national team if the current leadership continues.”\nGO DEEPER\nThe week World Cup champions Spain resolved to 'fight to the death' for change\nLater on Friday, Hermoso released a statement of her own on social media.\nShe said she had previously been pressured to put out a statement by the RFEF to justify Rubiales’ actions and she had delayed speaking out as she had not wanted to detract from the players’ World Cup victory.\nHermoso also spoke about the events at the final. “While it is true that I do not want to interfere with the multiple ongoing legal processes, I feel obliged to report that Mr. Luis Rubiales’ words explaining the unfortunate incident are categorically false and part of the manipulative culture that he himself has generated,” she said.\nAdvertisement\n“I want to make it clear that at no time did the conversation to which Mr. Luis Rubiales refers to in his address take place, and, above all, was his kiss ever consensual. I want to reiterate as I did before that I did not like this incident.\n“The situation shocked me given the celebrations that were taking place at the moment, and with the passage of time and after delving a little deeper into those initial feelings, I feel the need to report this incident because I believe that no person, in any work, sports, or social setting should be a victim of these types of non consensual behaviors.\n“I felt vulnerable and a victim of an impulse-driven, sexist, out of place act without any consent on my part. Simply put, I was not respected.”\nOfficial Announcement. August 25th,2023. pic.twitter.com/lQb18IGsk2\n— Jenn1 Hermos0 (@Jennihermoso) August 25, 2023\nAll members ‘Las 15’ — the 15 Spain players who wrote to the RFEF in September asking not to be called up by the national team until structural changes were made — have signed the statement, including the 12 players who were not recalled for the World Cup.\nFIFA opened disciplinary proceedings on Thursday against Rubiales, who chaired an extraordinary RFEF assembly on Friday. Speaking at the assembly, the 46-year-old refused to resign, claimed “a social assassination” was being attempted against him and said he had “suffered persecution” in his five years as RFEF president.\nRubiales added: “We’re in a country where the law rules, where there has to be a motive to take you out of some place. And I say: what is it I’ve done? A consensual peck is enough to get me out of here?”\nThe former defender also made references to “false feminism” and repeated, “I’m not going to resign” five times during his address at the RFEF meeting.\nGO DEEPER\nControversy and condemnation after World Cup kiss - Luis Rubiales is no stranger to either\nSeveral male Spanish players also spoke out after the RFEF meeting. Ex-Manchester United goalkeeper and Spain international David de Gea posted: “My ears are bleeding”, while retired No 1 Iker Casillas also wrote: “Total embarrassment.”\nAdvertisement\nBorja Iglesias, the Real Betis striker, effectively ruled himself out of selection for the men’s national team following the events at the RFEF assembly.\nLa Liga president Javier Tebas, who Rubiales criticised in his speech, also denounced the RFEF president over his “misogynistic and despicable behaviour”.\nFIFPro, the global organisation that represents players, again reiterated its call for disciplinary action against Rubiales following his speech, having done so earlier in the week.\nAhead of the RFEF assembly, Rubiales was also criticised by Spain’s acting prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, and culture and sport minister, Miquel Iceta.\n(Photo: Joe Prior/Visionhaus via Getty Images)",
