Over 120 minutes of open play, Nigeria were not the better side on the night. Shots on goal, among other statistics, stood at two against nine in Morocco’s favour.\nWhile millions of Nigerians prayed for a miracle to lift the Eagles, the so-called miracle that eventually emerged was the alibi that the Super Eagles lost on penalty kicks. This narrative has served to mollify Nigerian pride. But the conversation needs to change. Nigeria is underperforming with the Super Eagles and across its entire football ecosystem. Losing on penalties merely masks the calamity of Nigerian football when placed beside the deliberate and intentional progress recorded by the Morocco Football Federation over the past decade.\nWe love tournaments where the Super Eagles provide a distraction from our worries and the stress of daily living, offering entertainment to millions and an entrée into dreamland for a few. Hard-hearted optimists see no tactical defects in the Eagles, choosing instead to celebrate the sheer athleticism of the players. Yet Morocco did not allow Victor Osimhen a single shot in 118 minutes, and the Super Eagles were largely denied the use of the wings throughout the match.\nMorocco has systematically developed its football ecosystem, and its methodical planning is now yielding huge dividends. Its facilities are top-notch, and the country routinely hosts FIFA and CAF competitions for both men and women. South Africa has also strengthened its ecosystem, and its football is thriving.\nThese two federations starkly expose the Nigerian football ecosystem as a disaster, with planning and growth having stalled. Apart from Uyo, there are no FIFA-approved stadia across Nigeria. Repeatedly touted budgets and expenses for stadium renovations often come to nothing. The domestic league has regressed, while poor player welfare, including blatant fan violence, has ensured that coaches largely ignore it when assembling the senior team. The league no longer feeds the national teams as it did in the 1990s and 2000s.\nFederations such as Morocco and South Africa, with the support of FIFA and CAF, have established high-performance facilities. Nigeria has not. There is no technical institute for football worthy of the name or intent, a basic requirement in today’s football ecosystem. This failure is a consequence of years of smoke and mirrors by successive leaderships, as well as the scandalous absence of planning and transparency at the Nigeria Football Federation and the Sports Commission.\nIn the 1990s, North African federations feared being drawn against Nigeria in competitions. That fear reflected the physical and mental strength of the senior team and the steady supply of talent from the local league. At the time, top Nigerian clubs held their own against the North Africans in the Club competitions.\nMorocco has now clearly pulled away, its standards and facilities elevating it above all countries in CAF. Since it went into the Qatar World Cup semifinals two years ago, it has led African FIFA ratings.\nI was in the leadership of the Nigerian team that played the first FIFA-approved football match in 1992. While the infrastructure was in place, the talent was debatable. Over the years, we witnessed South Africa convert its potential, successfully hosting the 2010 World Cup. Its football league, with a professional and business underlay, is vibrant.\nIt is painful that, by contrast, Nigeria has, in the past 30 years, frittered away all the advantages it held in the sector. When we contemplated the nation’s professional league, the committee, of which I had the privilege of being vice-chairman, emphasised in its report that local clubs, most of which were then creations or wards of state governments, were expected to be weaned off.\nThose clubs were only half alive, with a caricature of corporate governance, while the players harboured a pitiful sense of entitlement to monthly government remuneration. The more importunate ones left to play football at any level in the world for as little as $1,000 per month. Club sides collapsed as we sacrificed our first-mover advantage to nepotism and mediocre leadership.\nNigeria should lament that generations of skill and promise are being wasted because the governance of our football remains pigeonholed in inappropriate and mismanaged bodies. Beyond self-promotion and self-serving initiatives, what is the vision and capacity of the current NFF management team, or, for that matter, their predecessors?\nDiscussions about the million-dollar grants from FIFA and CAF to the NFF rarely translate into tangible improvements. What corporate organisation running a world-class programme recruits its leadership in the manner the NFF does and expects superior results?\nHad Nigeria won the penalty shootout against Morocco, there would have been nationwide joy, but that would have been a disservice to the ethos of diligent policymaking and execution. Unlike Morocco, Nigeria operates largely on snatch-and-grab opportunism and the grandstanding of officials.\nConsider, for instance, the number of legislators who travelled to Morocco at public expense, as well as the entire management of the Sports Commission, many of whom seem to forget that their real work should be done months and years before each tournament.\nOne of my most memorable experiences occurred in 2002, when mandarins at the Ministry of Sports, cornered in their political chess games, nominated Alhaji Aliko Dangote as Chairman of the Nigeria Football Association, with me as Vice Chairman.\nAliko, who was airborne from Singapore at the time, called to schedule a meeting immediately upon his arrival. Having known him personally, it was an engaging and promising discussion. He was eager to imprint his renowned business acumen on Nigeria’s football framework. Unfortunately, he withdrew the very next day. His business advisers considered the risk excessive, warning that Nigerians might torch Dangote trucks whenever the Super Eagles lost a match.\nThat moment could have planted the seed for a 20-year football development plan anchored on strong business principles. Notably, this was around the same period that countries such as Morocco began making decisive structural investments in football.\nAt the time, I had also incubated a multi-million-naira programme aimed at tapping into the hides and skins market for football production in Nigeria. The plan involved partnerships with artisans in Kandahar and traders in Kano, with projected sales of one million footballs annually for schools, colleges, clubs and other institutions. This initiative was designed to become a financial cornerstone for the NFA, reducing its dependence on government funding.\nMorocco, by contrast, invested heavily in coaching and modernised football academies at all critical levels. They built enduring structures and made long-term commitments, recognising that raw talent alone is insufficient in modern football. When, for instance, will Nigeria become serious about reviving school sports?\nIn 2022, I served on a Presidential panel on football reform. After six months of intensive work, we submitted an official report. Nearly four years later, not a single official word has been said about it. And there are no consequences? Of course there are.\nThe consequence is the steady annihilation of our football ecosystem. To lament our failure to qualify for two recent World Cups and to mourn the AFCON semi-final loss to Morocco is for a nation to wallow in crocodile tears of its own making.\nIf Nigeria continues to avoid the hard work required to re-engineer its football structure, through robust planning, ISO-aligned systems and business-minded leadership recruitment, it will remain a nation merely winking in the dark, deserving only to crawl home from tournaments.\nOgbuefi Tony Nnachetta is a former Vice Chairman of the Nigeria Football Association",
