They each face 18 months behind bars as well.\nAll three denied wrongdoing when they appeared before the court.\nDurantez also said Rubiales should pay 50,000 euros ($54,080) in damages to Hermoso, with another 50,000 euros to be jointly paid by Rubiales, Vilda, Luque and Rivera.\nIn addition, she requested a restraining order barring Rubiales from coming within 200 metres of Hermoso and from communicating with her for the next seven-and-a-half years.\nIf convicted and sentenced as requested by the prosecutor, Rubiales would not necessarily have to go to prison. Spain's criminal code allows judges to \"exceptionally\" suspend jail terms if - as in this case - none of the sentences imposed individually exceeds two years.\nReuters\nProsecutor Marta Durantez charged Rubiales with one count of sexual assault and one of coercion for his alleged actions in the aftermath of the kiss, offences carrying jail terms of one year and 18 months, respectively.\nRubiales, 46, grabbed Hermoso and kissed her on the lips on Aug. 20 of last year during the awards ceremony after Spain's victory in the women's World Cup in Sydney, making global headlines and causing a national debate in Spain about sexism.\nHermoso and her teammates said the kiss was unwanted and demeaning, but Rubiales argued it was consensual and denied any wrongdoing.\nThe prosecutor also accused the former coach of the women's national team, Jorge Vilda, the current sporting director of the Spanish federation (RFEF), Albert Luque, and the RFEF's marketing chief, Ruben Rivera, of coercing Hermoso into saying the kiss was consensual.\nThe indictment said the three officials harassed Hermoso by exerting \"constant and repeated acts of pressure\" directly on the player and through her friends and family.
