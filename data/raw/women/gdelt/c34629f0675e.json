  "body_text": "Hill Dickinson buys Everton stadium naming rights\nThe club has recouped a chunk of the £750m cost of its 53,000-capacity ground at Bramley-Moore Dock, signing a long-term sponsorship deal with the Liverpool-based law firm.\nHill Dickinson’s name will be emblazoned across Everton’s new stadium, which the club will play its first competitive game at in August.\nThe ground, which will be known as Hill Dickinson Stadium, completed earlier this year and has hosted several test events.\nThe club said the deal is “one of the largest stadium naming rights deals in Europe” but did not disclose the value.\nMeanwhile, the law firm said acquiring the naming rights was too good an opportunity to pass up.\nCraig Scott, chief executive of Hill Dickinson, said: “To put our name to Everton’s new stadium is a once-in-a-generation opportunity.\n“We believe deeply in what this project stands for — a bold, transformational vision for Liverpool and its future. This partnership is about legacy, ambition and the power of two globally recognised organisations coming together to make a difference.\nHe added: “As Hill Dickinson continues to grow internationally, we remain proud of our Liverpool roots — and we are honoured to be part of one of the most exciting waterfront developments in Europe.”\nHill Dickinson becomes the latest firm to buy the naming rights for a Premier League stadium, joining the likes of Etihad, Emirates, and American Express, which sponsor Manchester City, Arsenal, and Brighton’s grounds.\nSeveral large clubs have eschewed naming rights deals – or else failed to strike one – including Tottenham Hotspur, which has the newest ground in the division, simply known as the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nOther large European football stadium naming rights deals of recent years include Spotify at Barcelona, understood to be worth €20m a year, and Allianz at both Juventus and Bayern Munich.\nManchester United’s Old Trafford has never had a naming rights partner – although it is thought the rights to the club’s planned £2bn new stadium might have to be sold – and nor did Everton’s Goodison Park, which will be used by the club’s women’s team going forward.\nEverton chief executive Angus Kinnear said: “Welcoming Hill Dickinson as our naming rights partner is a bold and strategic step forward.\n“This partnership goes beyond branding — it’s a shared commitment to progress, excellence and the regeneration of our city. Hill Dickinson Stadium will stand as a symbol of Everton’s ambitions, our values, and the global future we are building together.”\nYour Comments\nHill Dickinson is a Liverpool-headquartered law firm, rather than simply a Liverpool based one.\nIt is an international firm based in many locations.\nBy John\nI was at the final game at Goodison yesterday so took a straw poll amongst all the people I’ve been sitting with for years. The consensus? Glad for the money; good on ’em; but we’ll still call the place Bramley Moore.\nBy Saint Domingo\nIt’s a Liverpool headquarters Law firm with branches all over the globe incl Honk Kong , NY.\nBy Anonymous\nThe original founder of the firm … Cuff was also a founder and board chair of Everton so a close long standing historical link\nBy George\nWarrington’s Halliwell Jones Stadium soon became referred to as the HJ Stadium. So the HD Stadium is highly defined, with much more than 4K capacity.\nBy Wolfie\nWe’ll get used to it, after all Barcelona fans will still refer to the Camp Nou and not the Spotify.\nBy Anonymous",
