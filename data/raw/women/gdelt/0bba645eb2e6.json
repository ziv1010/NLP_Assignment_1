There was a terrific atmosphere in evidence as a diverse range of acts took to the stage and put on some show stopping performances which had the audience spell bound as the entertainers mixed, comedy, song and dance in equal measure.\nA total of nine acts took to the stage and they were as follows; The Drama Queens, Misseducation, The Ice Breakers, Mums and Roses, The Guinness Syncers, Tasty and Tempting, Howleys Heroes and The Resuscitator, all of whom went to great lengths to provide something uniquely different and this they duly did as they mixed raw talent with dance moves and routines that took one’s breath away not to mention the lyrics and hip movements that confounded and beguiled a bewildered and gripped audience who were hooked from minute one when the Drama Queens took to the stage to begin the event proper.\nThe crowd roared their approval as each and every act raised the bar as the audience roared their approval and clapped continuously as the entertainment levels cranked up several notches as one act followed another. There were some surprise performers and performances with the identity of some of the line-ups remaining a state secret right up until the curtain went up which only added to the sense of occasion and created all kinds of drama, thrills and spills aplenty. Lip Sync Ireland took care of all the sound, stage and master of ceremonies gigs and this enhanced the night and gave it a real professional touch with four judges in situ to adjudicate and give their individual opinions on each act after they had delivered their performances. The judges included well known Charlestown Sarsfields star and GAA analyst John Casey, Sports Commentator and Journalist Mike Finnerty, Laurita Blewitt and Stephen Conway of the Hardy Bucks Fame and they were pretty honest and forthright in their opinions and gave good feedback to each and every act which added to the sense of occasion and enjoyment if nothing else.\nThe atmosphere was electric and raucous at all times with the public allowed to vote for what they considered the best act with all votes totted up and counted after the last act had finished their performance and left the stage. This only added to the sense of drama as all the acts returned to the stage and performed the S-Club Seven number Reach for the Stars which almost pulled the house down such was the response from the enthralled audience who joined in the spirit and clapped along to the hip movements and fancy dancing and actions of the participants. The top three acts were singled out according to the public vote which led to much speculation and a drum roll before Misseducation were announced as the overall winners which led to all manner of celebrations and ovations to boot. They were worthy winners too, it must be said as they delivered a near perfect performance with Motown and a 1970s theme very much in evidence in their top class performances. Misseducation were a group of ladies who teach and work in St Attracta’s NS, Charlestown with principal Brian McDermott playing the Barry Gordy role, the founder of Motown to absolute perfection.\nThe real winners on the night however, were the East Mayo Athletics Club as each act had raised a substantial amount of money in the lead up to and on the night of the event which generated huge revenue for the club to help complete their splendid new athletics track development which has an early summer starting date. Gemma Higgins spoke of behalf of the East Mayo Athletics after the show concluded and spoke glowingly of the many people who helped out to make the event the outstanding success it undoubtedly was. She paid tribute to the many sponsors and businesses in the town who dug deep to support and help out in the sponsorship of the acts and the event itself and was lavish in her praise of their generosity, philanthropy and kindness which the club are deeply appreciative of. Gemma also paid enormous tribute to the people who went on stage to make up the nine acts and was fulsome in her praise of their professionalism, dedication and commitment which was unwavering since the event was first mooted some months ago. It was a night to savour for all associated with the event and one that will live long in the memory for all who were in attendance with the town and community once again coming up trumps to support a club and committee that have invested a huge amount of time and effort in the formation and growing of an athletics club that continues to flourish with the new facilities in the offing only further strengthening the will and resolve of people to bring it to fruition.\nA wonderful night was had by all and congratulations to all who took part and well done to the many people who helped in the wings and more than played their part in an event that will surely go down in the annals as one of the most successful ever staged by a club and the town. There’s a lot of untapped potential when one looked and witnessed some of the outstanding talents that took to the stage with the Arts sure to see an increase in membership should many of the participants wish to take the next step and take to the stage more often in the near future. We will watch this space with renewed interest in the weeks and months ahead.\nThere was no winner of the Charlestown Sarsfields GAA lotto jackpot of €16,100 in the weekly draw held on Sunday night, March 30, and the following were the four numbers drawn; 9, 15, 26 and 27.

The Sarsfields go into the game shorn of a number of players due to injury and retirement but they always get the juices flowing for a clash with the county town with the team expected to feature some fresh faces and new blood. The league will be ultra tough as always with no easy games and the Sarsfields are keenly aware of what lies ahead of them as they enter a new phase of their development with lots to prove and many challenges to overcome not least of which is the Mitchels first up at home which is as tough an opening home game you could possibly get.\nThe Sarsfields host Kilmovee in the county U14 development league in Fr O`Hara Park on Saturday morning, April 12, with the throw-in confirmed for 11am.\nCharlestown Organic Community Garden is now open for the new season on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons at 2pm.

This was a terrific advert for minor football as it had everything one could wish for including a little controversy at the end as the Sarsfields had justifiable claims that they had won by two points but the referee begged to differ and adjudged the game level at the final whistle.\nBoth teams went at it from the throw-in and there was a cracking hum to the game with goals and scores galore being the main currency both teams traded in. The Sarsfields may rue some chances that went awry in both halves but they were brave and courageous at the way they approached the match as they attacked from the off and got the ball into the hands of the right players in front of goal. The Sarsfields goal scorers were Danny Breheny with a brace, Michael McCarthy and Shea Haran with the home side more than contributing to a super game that had everybody gripped from the first whistle.\nWell done to the Charlestown Sarsfields minor ladies who qualified for the county minor league final by virtue of their 4-8 to 1-9 victory over Claremorris played at the Colm Horkan Memorial Pitch, Charlestown recently. The seeds for the Charlestown Sarsfields victory were sown very much in their first half-performance as they played some quality football racking up 3-6 while limiting the visitors to just two solitary white flags which pretty much sums up the dominance the green and white girls enjoyed in a thundering first half display. Claremorris must have somewhat deflated as they made the forlorn walk to the dressing rooms for the half-time chat with the Sarsfields, in contrast, on cloud nine as they couldn’t have played any better if they tried.\nThe second half saw something of a shift in the pattern of play as Claremorris, to their credit, played much better and got to grips with the Sarsfields running game with the game a much more even contest as a result. The South Mayo ladies won the second half 1-7 to 1-2 and can be proud of the way they hauled themselves off the floor as things could have got really ugly for them after their first-half fade out. They restored their pride in good style with the Sarsfields, while not as free flowing or on it as they were in the first half, had enough of a cushion to withstand the South Mayo rally and had amassed enough of a lead in the first half to ensure a comfortable passage to the final where they await the winners of the other semi-final. The Sarsfields have a good panel of players at this grade and will be keen to make the best use of the undoubted talent available to them by winning a much-coveted division 1 league title.\nEaster Fun Club takes place on Saturday, April 26, from 10am-2pm at Carracastle Community Centre with dance, drama, music, fun games, Easter Egg Hunt and more.

First up saw reigning champions Glann/Sinolane put their title on the line against Main Street in what turned out to be cracker with the town street putting everything on the line as they gave the champions plenty of it before finally succumbing on a five legs to three score line. The champs knew they were in a contest, and they had to scrap hard to see off the doughty and persistent Main Street challenge with the Glann/Sinolane contingent finding the big doubles when the need was greatest to secure their semi-final passage.\nThe second game was no less intriguing as Hagfield squared off against Church Street in another contest that had the crowd gripped from an early stage. Hagfield have plenty of pedigree in this competition stretching back any number of years as indeed have their opponents, so the ingredients were ripe for a classic old firm clash. It didn’t disappoint as both teams matched each others score for score and leg for leg with things very much on a level footing going into the singles. It was Hagfield, however, who came up with the big arrows when the fat was in the fire as they nailed their doubles in the key moments to come through on another 5-3 scoreline with the darts public getting bing for their buck as two terrific matches were played out before large and very knowledgeable crowds.\nThe semi-final line-up is now complete and sees champions Glann/Sinolane going into battle against dark horses Lowpark while Lavey Beg take on Hagfield (2) in another intriguing tussle which has lots of drama and sub-plots around it. The stage is set for two gargantuan last four meetings with everything on the line in terms of prestige and qualification as hosts Gus and Grainne Marren gear up for games that are sure to draw huge crowds to the splendidly appointed venue. More news next week on results, draw news and fixture dates as the competition gets down to the business end with the viewing figures at record levels according to OPTA.\nThere was no winner of the Curry GAA lotto jackpot €3400 in the weekly draw held on Monday night, March 31, and the following were the four numbers drawn; 1, 14, 16 and 17.

Boom Boom made a breakneck start racing away with the first set with some ace throwing. He backed this up in set two taking it comfortably by three legs to one to leave him in pole position at the start of set three. The Pillock received a warning from Governor Gus for dilly dallying at the ochie, a tactic obviously designed to stop the momentum of his opponent who was well aware of what was going on having on as he threw a few barbs by way of response.\nGovernor Gus had to step in to stop tempers from boiling over and when order was restored it was Boom Boom who continued to dominate as he took the first two legs of set three to leave him on the cusp of a resounding three nil whitewash. The Pillock stirred himself here as he shook off the lethargy and mediocrity that so dogged his performance in the opening two sets. He responded to adversity winning three legs in a row to take the set and put a jolt in the confidence of his opponent who had looked home and hosed prior to that. The fourth set brought some more shenanigans and game playing as the Pillock attempted to get in the head of his opponent in the hope of distracting his focus and concentration. It worked to a point as both men shared the opening four legs to set up a one leg shootout with Boom Boom looking to secure victory with the Pillock eager to extend the match to a fifth and deciding set. Boom Boom was in no mood to take the match beyond the fourth set and seized control of the deciding leg with some terrific shooting. He won the race to the double hands down and stepped forward with any amount of darts in his quiver as he fixed his eyes on double eighteen. He needed only one as his first dart pierced the centre of the bed to set off tumultuous scenes of jubilation in his large pocket of supporters who chanted the name of their hero to the high heavens. A super day for Boom Boom and his support team with the Pillock left to cry in his beer as he came up short at the final hurdle once again.",
