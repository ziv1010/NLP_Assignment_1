And with baseball and softball rapidly approaching next month, even more praise is rolling in for Arkansas’ best.\nNow, what else is steeping in today’s Brew?\n- Pitching preview with Matt Hobbs\n- Hogs’ long-time rival comes to town\n- And much, much more!\nFrom another world. When you get an hour with Matt Hobbs, make sure to ask your most important questions early. You might run out of time if you don’t. The Arkansas pitching coach is so thorough with his answers, seldom is a follow-up question needed. He provides great insight and gives you behind-the-scenes stuff that is every reporter’s dream.\nRead more from Clay Henry’s latest sit down with Razorback baseball’s Matt Hobbs and learn who in the Hogs’ bullpen is going to be throwing alien pitches to SEC opponents this spring.\n> KEEP BUILDING. A matchup as old as time will take place inside Bud Walton Arena tonight. Arkansas is set to host Texas A&M for the 165th all-time meeting between the two programs.\nArkansas has won its last two SEC games at home, including a convincing defensive performance against LSU a week ago. Now 14-7 on the year, the Hogs will look to bolster their conference record of 3-5. The Aggies have only lost one SEC game in eight contests.\nTip-off at BWA is set for 6pm, and the game will be televised on ESPN2.\nHear Coach Muss preview the game along with a recap of last week’s action in the latest edition of Courtside with Eric Musselman, free to watch!\n> THREE STRIKES. Softball America is catching the Arkansas softball wave as the season draws near. The trio of Chenise Delce, Kristina Foreman, and Hannah Gammill have all been selected as preseason All-Americans by the publication. Gammill was named a Preseason First Team All-American while Delce and Foreman were tabbed to the Second Team. All three were named to USA Softball’s 2023 Collegiate Player of the Year Watch List last week.\n> TURNING HEADS. It’s college football all-star week, and practices at this year’s East-West Shrine Game are underway. Former Arkansas wide receiver Jadon Haselwood is already turning heads for the East squad this week. Read why Jaden has been one of top performers thus far, via CBS Sports.\n> DASHING ON. Following a successful final collegiate season that featured 11 shutouts, former Arkansas goalkeeper Grace Barbara accepted an invite to the preseason camp of the National Women’s Soccer League’s Houston Dash. Grace reported to the Dash this past Saturday and is currently competing in the camp. Best of luck to the former Razorback!\n> SOPHOMORE STUDS. Two different publications have recognized two different Arkansas baseball players with preseason All-American honors.\n- Pitcher Brady Tygart has been named a preseason Second-Team All-American by D1Baseball. Brady emerged as the Razorbacks’ relief ace last season as a true freshman, posting a team-leading eight saves, including six multi-inning saves, and struck out 51 while limiting opposing hitters to a .212 batting average.\n- Second baseman Peyton Stovall also earned preseason All-American honors as Baseball America named him to their Second-Team. Peyton caught fire in last year’s NCAA Tournament, posting a team-leading .429/.451/.571 slash line with two home runs and 13 RBI over 11 games.\nThe Diamond Hogs now have three preseason All-Americans on their roster. Pitcher Hagen Smith was previously named a preseason All-American by Perfect Game.\nMaintaining pace.
