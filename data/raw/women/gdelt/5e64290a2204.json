Lively start for The Hammers vs The Chavs.\n2 Posted 22/08/2025 at 20:27:40\nWth is 'accidental contact', VAR are just making things up on the spot.\n3 Posted 22/08/2025 at 20:33:16\nI think the Chelsea player has fucked my screen up as well!\n4 Posted 22/08/2025 at 20:35:40\n5 Posted 22/08/2025 at 20:35:47\nThat is what I want to see Charly Alcaraz doing for us... but who would be in the middle to convert?\n6 Posted 22/08/2025 at 20:37:26\n7 Posted 22/08/2025 at 20:38:08\n8 Posted 22/08/2025 at 20:40:21\nThey've shipped 6 in a game and a half!\n9 Posted 22/08/2025 at 20:41:36\n10 Posted 22/08/2025 at 20:42:28\nWHU have some decent players. Shouldn't be getting completely exposed like this\n11 Posted 22/08/2025 at 20:45:31\nMight struggle to make wk3.\n12 Posted 22/08/2025 at 20:48:14\nWest Ham beat us the other week\n13 Posted 22/08/2025 at 20:50:47\nWe'll stay up on goal difference! 😂\n14 Posted 22/08/2025 at 20:52:43\n15 Posted 22/08/2025 at 21:07:12\nI don't know how it's possible for ref and VAR to miss this. But the stooges in the studio always manage to concoct a convenient narrative depending on which team has benefitted/lost out.\n16 Posted 22/08/2025 at 21:19:03\n17 Posted 22/08/2025 at 21:20:02\n18 Posted 22/08/2025 at 21:20:50\nWeren't some ToffeeWebbers advocating for Potter back in the day?\n19 Posted 22/08/2025 at 21:22:27\n20 Posted 22/08/2025 at 21:22:32\n21 Posted 22/08/2025 at 21:22:38\n22 Posted 22/08/2025 at 21:22:47\nIt's this inconsistency, subjectivity, and bias that drives fans mad.\nWest Ham have imploded\n23 Posted 22/08/2025 at 21:23:49\n24 Posted 22/08/2025 at 21:26:10\nIt's a new hurdle to ensure decisions favour the top sides, dressed up in a digital age.\n25 Posted 22/08/2025 at 21:26:54\n26 Posted 22/08/2025 at 21:29:05\n27 Posted 22/08/2025 at 21:34:37\n28 Posted 22/08/2025 at 21:57:09\n29 Posted 22/08/2025 at 21:58:57\n30 Posted 22/08/2025 at 21:59:08\n31 Posted 22/08/2025 at 22:04:19\n32 Posted 22/08/2025 at 22:09:27\n33 Posted 22/08/2025 at 22:10:46\n34 Posted 22/08/2025 at 22:13:21\nTarks was obvious TBF.\n35 Posted 22/08/2025 at 22:13:58\n36 Posted 22/08/2025 at 22:22:36\nIt matters.\nNot sure of the exact words but if you're too close to get your arms out of the way in time... it's not a foul.\n37 Posted 22/08/2025 at 22:31:26\nIt was the only time I can ever remember West Ham, bringing a few thousand supporters to Goodison, and the funny bastards got it right when they continuously sang that we would be running around Wembley with fuck-all.\n38 Posted 23/08/2025 at 06:40:08\nInteresting to see the much-talked-about Bowen, who is a good player, on the right side of midfield, but always looking to come in on his left foot. Another inverted winger, which has now become common practice.\nI was at that game in May '86. Outside, there were a few West Ham supporters on Goodison Road and Gwladys Street making their way to the Park End. Banter was healthy and they wished us well against Liverpool. Inside the ground, it got a bit spicy, especially in the corner of the Enclosure and the old Park End, which used to be given to the away supporters.\nAs for Potter, I spoke out against him when he was linked with us. It's too early in the season to call, but there will be pressure on him now.\n39 Posted 23/08/2025 at 10:29:09\nHe didn't look much better last night, going by the highlights and some of the game I saw.\n40 Posted 23/08/2025 at 12:46:36\n41 Posted 23/08/2025 at 13:17:30\n42 Posted 23/08/2025 at 13:17:34\n43 Posted 23/08/2025 at 13:19:05\n44 Posted 23/08/2025 at 13:19:59\n45 Posted 23/08/2025 at 13:22:13\n46 Posted 23/08/2025 at 13:29:08\nTwo things to take away so far: the stupidity of taking goal kicks to somebody stood next to you in the goal area, which was also shown in last week's game… and anybody saying they wouldn't have Richarlison back.\n47 Posted 23/08/2025 at 13:34:08\nMan City keeper with an equally dubious handball and it's, of course, waved away.\n48 Posted 23/08/2025 at 13:49:25\nAke is on in his place so that could well scupper any hope we had of signing Ake. City will be way too short at the back with Akanji leaving.\n49 Posted 23/08/2025 at 13:58:09\n50 Posted 23/08/2025 at 13:59:17\nI get that he has footballing principles but if the opponent pushes 4 and 5 players forward to press goal kicks, it isn't that hard to figure out what you have to do.\n51 Posted 23/08/2025 at 14:10:53\n52 Posted 23/08/2025 at 15:40:47\nIt would be interesting to see how he gets on because Thelwell was supposed to be seriously keen on signing him for us. He was reportedly the fastest player in Serie A last year.\n53 Posted 23/08/2025 at 16:57:19\n54 Posted 23/08/2025 at 18:39:53\n55 Posted 23/08/2025 at 18:47:15\n56 Posted 23/08/2025 at 18:48:31\n57 Posted 23/08/2025 at 18:48:55\n58 Posted 23/08/2025 at 18:53:16\nLook at Leeds today – absolutely crap relegation fodder. I hope Moyes doesn't take that ultra-cautious approach all season.\n59 Posted 23/08/2025 at 18:57:28\n60 Posted 23/08/2025 at 18:57:39\nHe's been called the next Kaka.\n61 Posted 23/08/2025 at 19:03:01\n62 Posted 23/08/2025 at 19:25:11\n63 Posted 23/08/2025 at 21:07:16\n64 Posted 23/08/2025 at 22:39:03\nFuck OFF Premier League! Corrupt as fuck.\nI'll watch Everton as I'm obsessed but the Premier League is corrupt and meaningless as fuck.\n65 Posted 23/08/2025 at 22:49:38\nHow ridiculous that Tarkowski's was given. This sport becomes more grotesque each year.\n66 Posted 23/08/2025 at 23:09:11\nAs to that 'Penalty' today – we all knew that would happen\nJake @ 56; was it the same fella we made look like a world class keeper last week? If so, says more about us really.\n67 Posted 24/08/2025 at 13:36:55\nPalace reckon the Forest owner was pushing for them to be relegated from the Europa League with Uefa\n68 Posted 24/08/2025 at 18:03:11\nWhere'd he come from?\n69 Posted 24/08/2025 at 18:17:59\nUnited's goal would have been disallowed by VAR if it had been Everton. 1-1 at moment.\n70 Posted 24/08/2025 at 19:00:56\nBefore you start with the misogyny crap, I think Cates and Logan are excellent.\nI hate watching this shite on Sky. Are they still doing half-time interviews? Killing the game with their American-style bullshit.\nI missed the game but enjoyed the live forum. I'll watch the customary 3 minutes on MotD2 tonight. UTFT!!\n71 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:08:47\n72 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:10:09\n73 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:10:49\nI have no idea what RS defensive strategy is. Don't think they do. They can definitely be got at.\n74 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:31:54\n75 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:35:42\n76 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:36:13\n77 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:36:21\nNo doubt these twats will.score with first shot\n78 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:36:45\n79 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:39:48\nI'm listening on Radio Merseyside. Every challenge on a red is a foul. Every 50/50 decision should have been for Liverpool. Newcastle always try the strong arm tactics against Liverpool. Using the dark arts against Liverpool. So biased it's untrue. No one knows the dark arts at the RS.\n80 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:41:55\n81 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:43:02\nWhy doesn't Howe use Joe Linton up front?\n82 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:43:03\nPlayer of the match. Half time interviews. American birds (clueless) doing the “interviews” etc… what next, dancing elephants?\n83 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:44:21\n84 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:44:54\n85 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:46:21\n86 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:46:54\nYes. Just stupid by Gordon.\n87 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:47:17\n88 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:47:50\n89 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:48:56\n90 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:49:27\n91 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:49:35\n92 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:50:14\n93 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:50:28\n94 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:51:25\nNewcastle have a mountain to climb now\n95 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:51:51\n96 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:52:49\n97 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:54:02\nCraig Hignett worst pundit I've ever heard.\n98 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:55:13\n99 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:55:44\n100 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:55:58\n101 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:57:54\nVan Dyke gets away murder.\nGordon is a dick.\nThe devil is red.\n102 Posted 25/08/2025 at 20:59:37\nNewcastle giving them a pounding without finding the net then Gordon, who was having a very good game did one of those cowardly tackles we saw him do while playing for us and couldn't argue with the red card.\nA hard job for Newcastle has now become a near impossible one.\n103 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:01:06\n104 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:03:28\nAnd Van Diyk won't get sent off for any awful challenges.\n105 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:03:59\nIs he a former rs player? Sounds like.\n106 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:06:02\n107 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:06:25\n108 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:06:37\nRegards tonight's match, I really dislike both sets of fans so don't give a fuck - ideal outcome to the Gordon tackle would have been for him to have really injured Van Dick and so get's a ten-match ban — win-win for everybody.\n109 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:08:16\n110 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:08:40\n111 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:08:58\n112 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:09:17\n113 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:11:17\n114 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:11:58\n115 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:11:59\n116 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:12:09\n117 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:12:20\n118 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:12:58\n119 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:14:53\nCan't say what he is like as a pundit as I don't have the sound on, never do for any of these bleedin' pundits.\n120 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:15:09\nThey are jammy twats, I know we rode our luck yesterday but it seems like every game with them.\n121 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:16:48\n122 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:17:47\n123 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:18:02\n124 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:18:48\n125 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:18:54\nNever have a team scored so often against the run of play\n126 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:20:23\n127 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:20:57\nWhen do you think we will see a decision on Citys 115 charges ? Around the same time as the Epstein files are released. i.e Never.\nBarcodes have got one back. Come on.\n128 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:23:01\n129 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:25:08\n130 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:27:54\n131 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:29:41\nJust waiting for someone to breathe on Salad, go down and a penalty will be awarded.\n132 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:34:39\nThe FA/PL has already reassured them of that.\n133 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:40:04\n134 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:43:08\nHTF do the shite get away with it week after week... I don't honestly know why we bother when the season is decided before a ball is kicked.\n135 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:43:39\n136 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:44:25\n137 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:48:49\n138 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:49:14\n139 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:49:20\n140 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:49:38\n141 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:50:47\n142 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:50:56\n143 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:51:42\n144 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:52:08\n145 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:52:19\n146 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:52:53\n147 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:54:54\n148 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:57:18\n149 Posted 25/08/2025 at 21:58:25\nThought Elliott had gone to Leipzig?\n150 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:00:19\n151 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:00:25\n152 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:02:09\n153 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:02:32\n154 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:03:04\n155 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:03:25\nfeckin hate them. 11 minutes injury time has done the barcodes.\n156 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:03:42\n157 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:04:20\nEvil incarnate\n158 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:05:15\n159 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:05:17\nHe’s a special talent unfortunately\n160 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:07:51\n161 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:08:40\n162 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:08:42\nArsenal will play the better football all season but will bottle it when it matters as per\nCity need a new manager that can refresh things, that may sound mental about Pep but I think his style of play now is becoming mundane and found out somewhat, once you press City high they crumble.\n163 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:09:13\n164 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:09:13\nWe could learn a thing or two from them.\n165 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:09:32\n166 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:11:00\nGoing at them with 10 men in the second half and playing against the ref for most of the match.\n167 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:11:55\n168 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:12:30\n169 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:15:37\n170 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:16:08\n171 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:18:32\n172 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:19:46\n173 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:21:20\nYou need quality on the bench to come on and make an impact, as well as covering for injuries and suspensions. The games a lot quicker and more intense and as such mid game fatigue can be punished more as well as keeping energy levels high all season by some rotation. fresh legs can also be the difference between a player choosing to drop deep to avoid having to chase back if the ball is lost and being confident enough to push forward and support or press late on\nI hope we don’t start selling players or loaning to many out, it’s a long season old season\n174 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:24:00\nFrom the most arrogant, conceited, egotistical, narcissistic, pretentious, bragging sports club anywhere in the known universe.\n175 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:26:12\nIt’s just like politics Nick, it doesn’t matter what you do, because if you say it often enough then people begin to believe that everything you say is true\n176 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:33:01\n177 Posted 25/08/2025 at 22:36:24\nLiverpool are shite, Liverpool are shite, Liverpool are shite, Liverpool are shite, Liverpool are shite\nThere, sorted\n178 Posted 25/08/2025 at 23:02:07\n179 Posted 26/08/2025 at 07:10:37\nI make no apologies for liking that player had stud marks down his calf.\nThe RS defending is poor so if Dour Dave goes back to KITAP1 we will be ok\n180 Posted 26/08/2025 at 07:52:23\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
