Can’t wait for the premiere dates to roll around. Any predictions on which series will be the biggest hit?\n-\nAvid Film and TV Fan\nBlood of Zeus on Netflix is hands down the best show on this list. It’s a shame it’s ending after just three seasons. Pitch-perfect storytelling, a masterful blend of drama and action, and top-tier voice acting. A true standout. It’ll be sorely missed.\n-\nDennis\nNCIS will start with season 23 in Fall 2025.\n-\n-\nElise\nSolid list. I loved America’s Test Kitchen: The Next Generation That at Fire Force\n-\nJay Manuel\nWow! So grateful to see Jay & Pamela on here. We are so excited for people to watch it and it was an awesome experience filming.\n-\nPaulH\nIt is absolutely SCANDALOUS that we still don’t have a locked in date for Strange New Worlds. What the AF is going on at Paramount+?",
