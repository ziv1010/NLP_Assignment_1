It’s more than 30% of violent incidents reported to the police.\n“Domestic abuse is not a gendered crime, but women are disproportionately victims.”\nTeresa Parker, head of media at the charity Women’s Aid, said that women and their children staying at refuges would not want to have the TV on during England games because of their past experiences.\nMs Parker said: “We were being told by women in refuges across the country that they would not have the TV on during major tournaments. For so many families it triggers the feeling that something worse might happen.\n“I spoke to three women whose partners love football and were abusive in long-term relationships. Football was a trigger.”\nAsked what measures the police plan to use during the tournament to ensure women’s safety, Ms Rolfe said: “We want to work closely with charities to make sure victims are aware that they are able to come forward.\n“We want to work out who the abusers are that we want to manage and we’ll be using domestic violence protection orders and restraint orders to do so throughout the tournament.\n“Sussex Police are organising joint patrols, where officers responding to incidents will have an independent domestic violence advocate with them so that the victim has many options available to them.”\nMs Parker added: “I feel passionately that football can do good. We are engaging with football clubs and organisations, like Fulham, where we do training and awareness.\n“The more we can work together the better.”\nMs Rolfe said: “The vast majority of men who love football would never dream of abusing their partner. But we need their help in calling out those who would. We need their help in challenging those who might.”\nSeparately, women’s aid charity Solace and the National Centre for Domestic Violence, have created an alternative England kit – “Shirt 38” – to raise awareness of the support available to anyone experiencing domestic abuse as part of their “No More Injury Time” campaign ahead of the Euros.\nShirt 38 represents the 38% rise in reported abuse cases when the England team lost between 2002 and 2010.\nA fixtures guide for the tournament drawing attention to violence against women has also been launched by White Ribbon, a charity which engages men and boys in ending violence against women, and safeguarding platform imabi.\nThe guide will contain facts about sexist abuse in the sport and advice on how to help.",
