  "body_text": "Fresh off our worst defeat in the Women’s Super League since October 2018, Chelsea FCW head coach Sonia Bompastor has been given a massive vote of confidence by the club, signing a 4.5-year contract extension, to 2030.\nOfficial: Sonia Bompastor extends Chelsea FCW contract\nFour more years!\n“Renewing her contract reflects our belief in her leadership, her vision and the stability she brings to the club. There is still a lot to play for this season as we continue to compete for all major trophies. We are very excited for Sonia and the team for the next phase both in the short and long term.”\n-Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley; source: Chelsea FC\nLast year, in her first season at the helm following the departure of legendary manager Emma Hayes, Bompastor led Chelsea to an unbeaten domestic campaign — the first in women’s football in England since 2001 — and set a new points record in the league on our way to winning our sixth consecutive WSL title.\nBut the wheels have come off a bit this year, with Chelsea sitting just third and now twelve points off the top. It’s Manchester City’s title to lose, and they made their superiority quite clear with their 5-1 win last weekend. We’ve lost three of our last five league games. We still have the domestic cups (League Cup final coming up next month!) and we’re in the quarterfinals of the Champions League, but we’re going to have to turn that league form around soon.\nBompastor’s a proven winner and she’s got a talented enough squad to do that, so let’s get to work!",
