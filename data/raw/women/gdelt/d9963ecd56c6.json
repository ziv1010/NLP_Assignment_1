  "body_text": "Exclusive: Vivianne Miedema opens up on ‘difficult’ Arsenal exit and coaching ambitions\n- Vivianne Miedema departed Arsenal after seven years last summer\n- She signed for WSL rivals Manchester City as a free agent\n- The striker opened up on the move in an interview with 90min\nVivianne Miedema has admitted her exit from Arsenal at the end of last season was ‘difficult’ and that her time with the north London club didn’t end in the way she’d hoped.\nThe Dutch international is one of the most formidable strikers in the WSL as she leads the way as the division’s all-time record goalscorer. She also holds a joint record alongside Aston Villa’s Rachel Daly for the most goals scored in a single season with 22.\nMiedema spent several years at Arsenal between 2017 and 2024 having joined the club from Frauen-Bundesliga side Bayern Munich. However, her time at the club came to an abrupt end at the end of the 2024/25 campaign as the club opted against renewing her contract.\nFormer manager Jonas Eidevall was one of the key driving forces behind the decision, which was extremely unpopular among a lot of supporters. In a recent interview with Swedish outlet Aftonbladet, since taking charge of San Diego Wave in the NWSL, Eidevall admitted the decision was purely economic as they were given the opportunity to sign Mariona Caldentey on a free transfer from Barcelona, but could not afford the contracts of both players.\nMiedema went on to join WSL rivals Manchester City, where she has scored three goals in six appearances across all competitions so far this term. The striker struggled with injuries during the first half of the campaign, but returned to action over the weekend with a goal in their fourth round FA Cup win over Ipswich Town.\nAlthough Miedema is settled at City, the 28-year-old has been extremely honest and transparent about her untimely exit from Arsenal and how it came about.\n“Leaving Arsenal was difficult,” the Dutch international told 90min for adidas. “I’d been there for a very long time and it didn’t end in the way I think it should have ended.\n“For me, football and life is all about respect and it’s really nice when that is mutual and if it’s not then it’s tough. But, as I said, I’m just really grateful for and happy to be at City right now.\n“I’ve really enjoyed my time so far and I’ve been here almost six months now. I wish I could have played a bit more football but I can’t wait to be back after the winter break.\n“It’s been exciting and felt like a new step in my career. It’s been really nice to be around different people and adjust to a different playing style.”\nTune in to 90min's YouTube channel to watch our interview with Grace Clinton in full.\nMiedema still has plenty of years ahead of her at the top level of the game as she turns 29 in July. It’s set to be a big year in the forward’s career as she battles with City in both the WSL and the Champions League, but she will also hope to help the Netherlands to silverware at the Euros in Switzerland this summer.\nThat being said, Miedema is already considering the next step in her career when she does eventually hang up her boots and coaching is among the job opportunities under consideration.\n“It depends on the day and when you ask me [whether I want to go into coaching].” Miedema continued. “But I am doing my UEFA A badges right now.\n“I do obviously really enjoy football and I love the tactical side of things. I can definitely at one point after my career see myself doing something coaching wise.\n“But, I’m not going to promise right now I’m going to be the next national team coach or the next City coach. I’m not there yet.”",
