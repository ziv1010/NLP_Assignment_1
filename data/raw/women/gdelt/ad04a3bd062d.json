Two caps for Spain.\n— Graham Falk (@GrahamFalk) May 20, 2023\nAccording to Manchester World, United are keen on the 28 year old Spanish midfielder and are close to signing a deal.\nWith Champions League football all but secured next season, United are looking for a big transfer window to add quality and quantity to their already elite team.\nLopez signed for Levante back in 2015 and the Spanish international spent five seasons at the club before spending a year at Real Sociedad.\nShe then signed a two year contract with Atletico Madrid which expires at the end of this season.\nAnother bonus for the Reds is that Lopez is good friends with Ona Batlle who so far is yet to renew her contract with United.\nBatlle and Lopez last played together at Levante back in 2020 and should the Reds make a move for Lopez, it might also convince their star player to stay.\nMeanwhile, United have also been linked to Esmee Brugts.\nBrugts is also available on a free transfer from Dutch side PSV Eindhoven.\nThe 19 year old made her international debut last year against Brazil and scored her first goal for her country in April 2022 against Cyprus.\nBoth targets would make shrewd acquisitions for Marc Skinner, who has already signed England U-19 international Evie Rabjohn earlier this month.\nImagine an FA Cup Final programme, but 100% online!\nWith just a couple of clicks you could be reading the FA Cup final special edition of United Matchday Magazine, right here on your device.
