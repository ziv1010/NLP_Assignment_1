  "body_text": "Scotland’s hypocritical crusade against wood-burning stoves is a farce that reeks of virtue-signalling nonsense (“Council ban on wood-burning stoves will leave tenants flaming with anger”, The Herald, September 13). In a nation with plenty of timber, where households contribute just 15% of our paltry 0.01% slice of global greenhouse gases, bureaucrats in warm city offices plot to freeze out the rural vulnerable. Angus Council’s ban on council properties is just the opening salvo – soon, if unchecked, it’ll hit every croft and bothy.\nMeanwhile, the mother of all wood-burners, Drax Power Station, guzzles 7.5 million tonnes of imported pellets yearly, shipped across oceans in fossil-fuelled freighters, all subsidised by UK taxpayers at £869 million yearly. That’s not green energy; it’s scorched earth hypocrisy, devouring forests from Canada to the Balkans while our off-grid families huddle in the cold with unaffordable heating costs.\nFurthermore, modern stoves slash emissions by 90%, yet the council promotes heat pumps costing a £20,000 spend for stone-walled homes with inadequate insulation and no mains gas. This isn’t climate action – it’s crass stupidity, pandering to green activists while turning a blind eye to the corporate behemoths. Drax should be shut down first before any local authority touches another log pile. Like so many recent silly government interventions, with poorly thought-through plans, it is small wonder more and people feel distant from those in power.\nIan Lakin, Aberdeen.\nWhy should we endorse suicide?\nOfficial statistics from the National Records of Scotland showing an 11% fall in the number of probable suicides (\"Suicides in Scotland fall to lowest since 2017\", heraldscotland, September 16). This is welcome, though at 704 in 2024 it is still a tragic total.\nIt is therefore bitterly ironic that Liam McArthur MSP continues to pioneer a bill at Holyrood in support of assisted suicide for the terminally ill.\nHow could it be right for the state to endorse and enable suicide for those suffering the effects of physical illness, while simultaneously working to alleviate suicide on grounds of mental health?\nAll suicides are a tragedy, regardless of age or stage of life. Our MSPs ought to reject Mr McArthur’s Bill, and instead prioritise gold standard palliative care across Scotland.\nMichael Veitch, Scotland Policy Officer, CARE, Glasgow.\nRead more letters\n- Glasgow's challenges should not be solved at the expense of others\n- King suffering blue blood blues\n- The tax that did for Angela Rayner is unfair. It needs to be binned\nJo Farrell must speak up\nMore than 10,000 arrest warrants in Scotland are outstanding as Police Scotland struggles to cope. Why the silence from Chief Constable Jo Farrell? She should be demanding that the Scottish Government provides more funding support rather than wasting millions on various pet projects and numerous financial disasters.\nSince Jo Farrell started in October 2023 she has been a rather will o' the wisp figure who avoids confrontation, avoids the press and seems intent on keeping her £232,452 salary and taxpayer-funded gold-plated pension contributions. Scotland needs a vocal and visible Chief Constable who will support their officers and stand up to politicians.\nClark Cross, Linlithgow.\nRoyals have much to offer\nIan W Thomson makes several valid points (Letters, September 15) regarding the King's family problems.\nThe problems with Prince Andrew, however, lie in a different direction to those of Prince Harry, I think, especially given the tragic event of 1997. But the dissolution of the monarchy? Charles and Camilla and William and Kate considerably redress the balance in terms of service; plus Anne’s sterling work, even at 75. Harry too, despite his present difficulties, does his bit; for example Invictus-wise. The “Firm”, I believe, still has much to offer the nation.\nBrian D Henderson, Glasgow.\nThe handball dilemma\nRyan McGinlay's report of the Kilmarnock-Celtic match on Sunday contained no critique of how Kilmarnock played and only a very short description of the actual goals (\"Iheanacho to the rescue as fans make their feelings known\", Herald Sport, September 15). Instead it was a general view of certain Celtic players and their management. Even the subtitle about a controversial penalty was not further discussed. Did Mr McGinlay (and the Editor) forget that The Herald is a national newspaper and not the Celtic View?\nHowever the principal problem is the definition of any handball ruling and the lack of football knowledge displayed by the current guidance to referees and other officials, namely \"are the hand or arm in an unnatural position? Therefore the contact is deemed to be deliberate\".\nThis faulty simplification was introduced to rectify the attitude of many players, supporters and referees that any hand or arm ball contact must be a foul or penalty. If the definition was corrected to \"was it possible, in the actual context of the speed of play in the incident, for the player in question to move his arm away from the flight of the ball?\" then the question of deliberate fouling would be clearer.\nNevertheless, despite the healthy fees paid to football officials running senior football, there still seems to be a lack of common sense in many such situations. Mind you, we can say the same thing about many players, supporters and reporters too. VAR has not been much of an improvement for that reason.\nJB Drummond, Kilmarnock.\nBinning the Banksy\nI have to disagree with Denis Bruce (Letters, September 15) about the removal of the Banksy mural in London (“New Banksy artwork showing judge beating unarmed protestor is concealed at courts site”, The Herald, September 9). While I thought it a very clever comment on a currently relevant topic, and congratulate the artist for that, it is, or was, simply graffiti.\nThe Royal Courts of Justice are a Grade 1 listed building. I suspect Banksy would be aware of this and that his work therefore would be short-lived – thus adding to its newsworthiness.\nSo, perhaps I am a Philistine, which, given the background to this particular Banksy, is just a little ironic?\nAlastair Clark, Stranraer.\nThe admirable Crichton wronged\nI echo Neil Stewart's gripes in relation to mispronunciation by TV broadcasters (Letters, September 15).\nOne of my gripes has long been the propensity of many of the English commentariat to fail to pronounce Scottish surnames correctly.\nTake the example of a recent bulletin on a national sports channel, where the presenter described Rangers Women’s manager, Scotland coach, former player and football pundit Leanne Crichton (pronounced “Cryton”) as Leanne “Cr-itch-ton”. Surely a little bit of homework would ensure names are pronounced correctly, thus at least denoting the impression that many of the southern commentariat are actually interested in those of us north of the Border and more importantly, to afford proper respect to those, in the case of Leanne Crichton, who are prominent people in Scottish society.\nJohn G McMenemy, Milngavie.",
