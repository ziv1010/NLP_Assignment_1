Opened to fanfare five years ago, the plant was expected to revolutionise compost production for mushroom growers across Northern Ireland and create 20 new jobs. At the time, its developers boasted about the site's advanced odour-control technology, promising minimal impact on surrounding communities.\nBut the reality for those living nearby has been anything but.\n“For five years, we have been emailing complaints to the factory, to the NIEA, to the PHA—day in, day out,” Claire told The Impartial Reporter. “A lot of us have jobs and children. It’s a hassle constantly doing that. To report it every single day is just relentless.”\nClaire says residents have followed all procedures and guidelines, yet feel abandoned.\n“It feels like no one is listening, and that no one is taking us seriously. It feels like they’re all waiting for us to get bored with sending emails so they can just get on with it. In my opinion, since I’ve started sending emails, nothing has changed.”\nNorthway Mushrooms went into administration last year and the factory was subsequently sold to SSL, but locals say the change in ownership has made no difference to their quality of life.\nGerry McDonnell of the Cabragh Residents Association said efforts to engage with statutory bodies have been met with indifference.\n“If you ring at 11am, 12 noon or half-past two, you get an automated message saying you’ve called outside office hours,” he said. “By anyone’s calculations, those times are not outside office hours.”\nHe added: “Since this odour problem started more than four and a half years ago, all we’ve had are sniff tests. One of my colleagues, Collette Donnelly, who owns a business nearby, said she saw NIEA staff outside and asked if they could smell anything. They told her no and said they had ‘invalidated the smell’ because she’d approached them. It’s unbelievable.”\nAccording to Gerry, two enforcement orders were issued in June 2023. After they were lifted, the NIEA reportedly concluded that the smell was no more than a “minor nuisance.”\n“The existing licence clearly states there should be no smell beyond the perimeter of the site,” Gerry said. “Yet they argue the smell isn’t regular or strong enough to warrant further action.”\nHe also criticised the PHA’s reliance on sniff tests and internal checks by the company.\n“In trying to get this resolved, we’ve been nice, we’ve been pleasant, but we just keep getting our faces slapped at every turn. We’re now considering peaceful, legal protest action at the factory and outside NIEA offices in 2025. To say the NIEA have been unhelpful would be the understatement of the year.”\nDescribing the odour, Gerry likened it to “old, decaying vegetables” or “heated-up broccoli.”\nHe said: “Sometimes it’s a really gassy smell. It goes through your lungs and chest. Around 50,000 tonnes of pure chicken poo go through there each week. Then there’s gypsum, which in certain cases carries a risk of blindness, and hydrogen sulfide—the same substance used in stink bombs. These are heated and supposedly filtered through bio-filters, but it’s clear those aren’t working.”\nGerry’s home is less than a mile from the factory, but he says the smell can carry for over two miles.\n“There are a heck of a lot of houses within that area,” he explained. “You’ve the local GAA football field, where a lot of training takes place, and a mile further down is Cabragh Primary School, with over 200 pupils. Depending on the wind direction, they’re often hit by the odour.”\n‘It’s affecting our children’s sport’\nDaimen Moy, who has coached at Killeeshil St Mary’s GAA since 2006, said the stench is now disrupting children’s sport.\n“When the wind blows from the west, the smell is horrendous,” he said. “We’ve had to stop training sessions, particularly for the younger children. It’s bad enough for adults, but this is affecting kids.”\nHe recalled incidents where spectators from visiting clubs commented on the smell.\n“It’s embarrassing. What do you even say to them? Our hands are tied. I’ve not heard of parents pulling their children from training, but it wouldn’t surprise me. I know of two women’s players who quit two years ago—one of them was getting headaches after training.”\nDespite a community rally and numerous emails, Daimen said the situation remains unresolved.\n“You’re met with closed doors. I email off to eight, nine, ten different people and very little has been done. The other morning, I was at the SPAR and the breadman was pulling faces at the smell while unloading. I just said to him, ‘Try living there.’”\nClaire Deane said the odour is not only physical but deeply affects mental wellbeing.\n“I get two kinds of smells—the rotten vegetable and a chemical smell like bleach,” she said. “The bleachy smell especially concerns me. I don’t know what we’re breathing in.”\nThe smell, she says, is present nearly every day, and even on milder days, it lingers for hours.\n“You can’t open your windows in warm weather. Sometimes the smell comes into the house. You can’t hang clothes outside or enjoy your garden. I smell it even when I’m driving home.”\nShe worries about the impact on older neighbours and children.\n“It’s soul-destroying. Your mood drops the minute you step outside. My elderly neighbours say it affects their chest. The kids go out to play football in the evenings and it’s just there—always.”\nWhen contacted by The Impartial Reporter, a spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA), which oversees NIEA, insisted that the agency continues to monitor the issue closely.\n“NIEA has and will continue to engage with residents, partner agencies, and elected representatives regarding the Sawgrass Substrates Limited facility and take all reports of odour seriously,” they said. “NIEA will not hesitate to take further enforcement action in line with departmental policy.”\nThe agency acknowledged that most complaints are submitted by email, and apologised for difficulties residents have had reaching them by phone.\n“Odour monitoring is conducted at several set locations, using olfactory assessments to negate impacts from wind direction. In 2023/24, NIEA carried out 25 odour assessments and has carried out 14 so far in 2024/25. The last non-compliance was recorded on 6 July 2023.”\nDAERA also addressed allegations of financial support to the facility.\n“Match-funding was provided only to Northway under the EU FVAS programme from mid-2020. That funding ended with the 2018–2022 programme. SSL, the current owner, has not received DAERA funding. A full breakdown of the programme is not available.”\nIn a statement, the Public Health Agency said it would work with DAERA, NIEA, and local councils if required.\n“There are a wide variety of odours that could have different effects on individuals,” a spokesperson said. “If members of the public have concerns about their health or wellbeing, they should contact their GP.”\nBack in 2019, Adrian Moynihan, head of First Bank, praised the original Northway Mushroom Factory for its “innovative approach to planning, problem-solving and funding.” But five years on, those living nearby feel their community has paid the price.\n“Big business has come into our area and done what they want,” said Gerry McDonnell. “No one is listening to us.”\nClaire echoed those sentiments: “We’ve done everything asked of us and nothing has changed. We just want to live in our homes without this constant stench hanging over us.”\nSawgrass Substrates Ltd was contacted for comment but did not respond.",
