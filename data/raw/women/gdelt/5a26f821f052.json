For throwing the ball with slightly more force than needed to their player? And then the ref got involved? You see things a million times worse in the stands in football and nothing happens, and then a man with his kid does that and gets moved?\nHow can you equate how a particular type of fan is being catered for, based on the overall attendance? Thats like saying we arent doing enough to encourage ethnic minorities. Or women. Or men.\nNo comparison today - to what we once were - in so, so many ways.\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
