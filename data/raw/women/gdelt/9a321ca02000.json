  "body_text": "By Mehul Gupta\n2024 was a year of advertising innovation and crazy experiments where some were really unexpected, some received serious trolling. But amidst this clutter, a few campaigns truly sparkled, leaving a lasting impact. So let me share my top picks.\nOrange: WoMen’s Football/The Bleues’s Highlight\nOrange’s campaign for the Women’s World Cup was a stroke of genius. Addressing the elephant in the room (or should I say stadium), they definitely made the right conversations happen, while also highlighting the fact of the right use of advertising platforms to drive social changes.\nIt has to be Heinz\nHeinz, a brand synonymous with tradition, surprised us with their playful and modern campaign. By reimagining everyday objects as Heinz products, they managed to stay relevant and capture the attention of a younger audience. It was a bold move that paid off, proving that even iconic brands need to evolve.\nBadtameez Karan\nDo you know someone named Karan? Most likely you do. Built on a very simple insight of Karan being a common name across India, Amazon MX Players’ campaign for their show ‘Karan Badtameez Hai’ definitely needs a mention in this list. A simple idea led to a nationwide chatter socially, connecting thousands of Karans. This one managed to influence the nation to question every ‘Karan’ across the corner, while making the show’s launch a hit. All this without harming any Karan in the process.\nJCDecaux: Meet Marina Prieto\nI loved how JCDecaux humanized their B2B campaign using a simple person’s life as the hero of the campaign. Instead of focusing on dry statistics and corporate jargon, they introduced us to Marina Prieto, an everyday grandma, a real person with only 28 followers. Igniting the fire of curiosity through outdoor advertising her Instagram posts across the country, JCDecaux proved that just sharing her story across subways created a rippling impact, making Marina an influencer overnight, highlighting the importance of the advertising medium.\nThe author is co-founder and CEO, SoCheers.
