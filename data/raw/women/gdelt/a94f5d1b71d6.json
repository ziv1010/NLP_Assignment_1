Check out the results:\nIndistinguishable from all other clickbait that makes up 75% of the articles.\nLoad More Replies...Even though this is something that is not news worthy and the girl is obviously a social media j****e and is probably loving all the attention, I actually find this quite disturbing. So you go to an event to watch a game, the camera operator thinks you're hot and gives you 3 seconds of screen time, and as a result all the creeps of the internet hunts you down, finds you, and releases your identity to the masses. If it were me I wouldn't be flattered, I'd be afraid! This is boss level stalking and media outlets shouldn't be making light of it.\nI was thinking the same. In this case, she wanted it. But what if it was someone who was truly stunning and didn't show cleavage (because she's mainly called stunning because she has a cleavage and is not dressed for a sportsgame - her face is nice but there are soooo many women who have a pretty face too. Are they not stunning because they wear sweaters?). But imagine, a girl like that gets spotted and then hunted down while she doesn't want it....\nLoad More Replies...Indistinguishable from all other clickbait that makes up 75% of the articles.\nLoad More Replies...Even though this is something that is not news worthy and the girl is obviously a social media j****e and is probably loving all the attention, I actually find this quite disturbing.
