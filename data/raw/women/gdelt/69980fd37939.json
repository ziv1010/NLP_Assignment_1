These things happen in football and she knows that. The important thing is that we are here to support her, and the recovery and rehab begins today.”\nGO DEEPER\nThe real and emotional impact of ACL injuries on female elite players\nKerr joined Chelsea in 2019 and has gone on to score 99 goals in 128 matches. She has won four WSL titles with the club, as well as three FA Cups and two League Cups.\nThe 30-year-old featured for Australia at last summer’s Women’s World Cup, missing the group stage with a calf injury, but returning for the knockout stage as the joint-hosts reached the semi-finals, where they lost to eventual runners-up England.\nKerr has scored four goals and recorded three assists in eight WSL games this term for Chelsea — who lead Manchester City by three points at the top of the table — and Hayes said she would have to find “solutions” to her absence.\n“Sam would expect me to say nothing less; our focus has to be on the fit players,” Hayes said. “We have a quality squad and the challenge for me as a coach is to find those solutions.\n“I trust in our squad. The focus and the attention has to be on the players who are here.”\nAfter their FA Cup game, Chelsea return to WSL action against Manchester United on January 21.\nGO DEEPER\nThe key to Chelsea replacing Sam Kerr is not to - Hayes should empower others instead\n(Photo: Getty Images)",
