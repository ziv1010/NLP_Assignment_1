  "body_text": "EXCLUSIVE: Sven Goran Eriksson's brutal words about Boris Johnson revealed after his death\nFormer England manager Sven Goran Eriksson gave a damming verdict on a British political figure in a new book about his life\nSven Goran Eriksson thought Boris Johnson was an \"idiot\", he reveals in a new book.\nThe former England manager who died last month worked on biography - A Beautiful Game - until shortly before his death, and it has now been released in Sweden.\nWriting about former PM Boris and ex-Arsenal vice chairman David Dein, Sven said: \"One person I had a lot of contact with in the role of national team captain was David Dein. He is a great guy and was Arsenal's vice-chairman for almost 25 years. During my time as national team captain, he was always in Arsenal's VIP room before the matches.\"\nSven went on: \"The VIP rooms are important in England, they are like the shop window of the clubs that should show off the beautiful world. They are like five-star hotels with champagne, waiters and fine food. David Dein was always there, greeting people and making small talk. 'Hello, Sven, how have you been?' Once he introduced me to his friend Boris Johnson.\"\nThe late footballing hero went on: \"I looked at him and immediately reacted to the hairstyle. He knew absolutely nothing about football, Boris. Zero!\n\"I think it was the first football game he saw. What kind of idiot is this, I wondered. \"He behaved like a fool, as if something wasn't quite right up there. Just a few years later, he became Mayor of London and finally Prime Minister.\"\nSven also said: \"But I judged him straight away. Boris Johnson and I hardly share many characteristics, but if there is any similarity between us, it is that we both caused a hell of a ruckus in the British Isles. Everything I did was hyped up, the smallest step I took.\n\"But I don't think I did anything wrong. Sure, I dated women I wasn't married to, but quite a few men do. I wasn't married myself, so it wasn't really that dangerous. I was a grown man dating grown women who knew what they were doing. That's what I thought then and that's how I think now. But it was a hell of a life.\"\nREAD MORE: Sven was 'close to bankruptcy' before death, bombshell new book revealsDuring a five-year spell in charge, Sven led England to quarter-final appearances at the World Cup in 2002 and 2006 as well as Euro 2004.\nAnd whilst he couldnt understand Boris' actions, Sven also says in the book he couldn't understand the players when he first came to England. He said: Players like Jamie Carragher, Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney, I never understood what they said.They speak with a rough Liverpool dialect, Scouse, a single concoction of Irish, Welsh, Lancashire dialect and Scots.\n\"'Damn it, if you're going to talk to me, you've got to speak English,' I told them. But Wayne Rooney, he just laughed for me. Sure, I improved my English later, but you're always a little handicapped when you don't fully master the language.\"\nSven added: \"I am also not a natural linguist, and I was never good enough to understand everything. You can communicate with people, you can read the newspaper, you can watch TV and get by when ordering at a restaurant and you get by in training, you can talk tactics - but it's hard to develop language skills once you know what's necessary. The most important thing for me was to start thinking in English. If you think of Swedish and have to translate back and forth, then it takes too long and communication suffers.\"\nSven himself delivered his own poignant goodbye message in his Prime Video film. He said: \"I had a good life. I think we are all scared of the day when we die, but life is about death as well. You have to learn to accept it for what it is. Hopefully at the end people will say yeah he was a good man, but everyone will not say that.\n\"I hope you will remember me as a positive guy trying to do everything he could do. Don't be sorry, smile. Thank you for everything, coaches, players, the crowds, it's been fantastic. Take care of yourself and take care of your life. And live it. Bye.\"\n* A Beautiful Game by Sven-Göran Eriksson is out in the UK on October 17.\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.\nREAD MORE: Best 2024 beauty advent calendars available to buy from Space NK, ASOS, Boots and more",
