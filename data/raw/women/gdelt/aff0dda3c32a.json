Holders Auckland United FC take on Henderson Eels FC after Ba Women FC and Hekari Womens FC meet in the first semi-final at Stade Pater in Papeete.\nDefending champions Auckland United FC head into their match with momentum from a strong group stage, but coach Ben Bate acknowledges there’s still room for improvement.\n“Our game against Hekari was a bit of a challenge,” Bate reflected.\n“The energy and intensity they brought in the first half caught us off-guard. We made a few changes at halftime, and I think we really took control in the second period,” Bate added.\nWith the Solomon Islands-based side known for its pace and spearheaded by the dangerous Ileen Pegi, Bate is approaching the match with caution and respect.\n“We spent time in the Solomon Islands last year during the OFC Womens Champions League and got to know the Eels quite well. They’re dangerous, especially with their quick transitions and pace up front — their front four are really bright and sharp,” Bate said.\nFor Henderson Eels, their semi-final appearance marks a historic achievement, and head coach Priscilla Tariga is keeping the mood in camp calm and focused.\n“It’s history for us to reach the semi-finals,” Tariga said. “Everyone is relaxed — there’s no pressure. I’ve told the girls, ‘We can do this.’”\nFacing the reigning champions is no easy task, but Tariga is determined her side will stick to their plan and give everything on the field.\n“Auckland are the best team, as we know, but we will give it 100 percent. We’ll keep our structure, manage our game plan, and play our game. Every minute must count.”\nWhile Auckland United are a strong favourite to progress to the Championship decider, the other semi-final has a more even look to it.\nBa Women FC are making history of their own in their maiden OFC Women’s Champions League campaign, and Charlene Lockington is proud of her team’s journey as they prepare to face Hekari Women’s FC.\n“We’re new to the competition, but we won’t take it lightly,” Lockington stated. “We respect Hekari — they’re a tough side with two Fijians in their ranks — but we are looking forward to the challenge.”\n“The girls are excited. We’ve already made history for our club by reaching the semis. We do have one injury we’re managing, but a few fresh players will be brought in. Everyone is ready.”\nEricsson Komeng is keeping his Hekari Womens FC squad focused on the task ahead as they prepare to face the determined Fijian outfit.\n“The mood in the camp is positive,” Komeng said. “After the win in the final Group match, the girls are looking forward to playing Ba. They are a strong team with quality players.”\nWhile a potential rematch with Auckland United looms in the final, Komeng is adamant the team’s full focus remains on their semi-final battle.\n“We can’t look ahead. We don’t go to the grand final unless we beat Ba. That’s our only focus right now — to give Ba a good game and hopefully get the win.”\nBoth matches can be watched LIVE and FREE on FIFA+.\nContent Sourced from scoop.co.nz\nOriginal url",
