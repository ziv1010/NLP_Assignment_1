  "body_text": "Sam Kerr has suffered a ruptured ACL and is set to miss the Matildas’ Paris 2024 Olympics campaign.\nKerr, 30, copped the blow while on a mid-season training camp with Chelsea. She’s already been ruled out of the rest of Chelsea’s season and Australia’s Olympic qualifiers against Uzbekistan in February.\nBut with the Olympics taking place across July and August this year, Kerr would require a stunning recovery to have any chance to feature in Paris.\nStay up to date with all the latest news from SEN. Sign up HERE.\n“Considering how hard Sam has worked over the past six months to return to play, this news is a devastating blow for everyone,” Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson said in a statement.\n“With her ability to lead by example, Sam's guidance and influence on the team is significant and, as a result, this will be an incredible loss for the national team.\n“Our focus now is on ensuring she has all the support she wants and needs to navigate recovery and rehab.”\nIt comes after a difficult year injury-wise for Kerr, who missed the early stages of the FIFA Women’s World Cup with a left calf strain. She was later revealed to have also strained her right calf in Australia’s bronze medal match loss to Sweden.",
