You traded a Ferrari for a Twingo. You traded a Rolex for a Casio... A lot of gyms, but work your brain a little bit too.\"\nGerard also benefited from his ex's revenge song, as he responded to those lyrics by persuading Casio to become sponsors of his new football concept - Kings League.\nHe explained his sponsorship deal with Casio during an appearance on a live stream of the Kings League, saying: \"We have an agreement with Casio,\" which was followed by laughter.\nHe added: \"I'm serious... we have reached an agreement with Casio for the Kings [League], yes, because we have many countdowns and we have many watches... this watch is for life, I'm telling you!\"\nShakira told Gerard \"you're no longer welcome\" in her brand new diss track.\nShe sings \"seeing you with the new one hurt me\" in her eagerly-anticipated new song TQG alongside fellow Colombian star Karol G, who split with Puerto Rican rapper Anuel AA two years ago. It's thought the song is also aimed at Karol G's former boyfriend.\nShakira goes on to say: \"What we lived I forgot. And that is what has offended you. And life has got even better for me. You are no longer welcome here.\n\"I saw what your girlfriend threw at me. That doesn't even make me angry, I laugh, I laugh.\"\n*Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter and Facebook .",
