  "body_text": "NEWTOWN SQUARE — Haverford High’s Teddy Foster and Episcopal Academy’s Kendra Williamson both came to cross country through friends.\n“My parents (David and Jenny) were very health conscious so I played a lot of sports growing up,” Foster said. “I wrestled, played flag football, baseball, basketball and soccer. But in the fall I always ran cross country. I had a buddy whose mom ran this local track club. It was super low key.”\nWilliamson’s parents, J.J. and Hope were also health conscious and got Kendra involved in soccer. But that changed when she was in the eighth grade at St. Patrick School in Malvern.\n“One day, soccer got canceled because it was raining,” Williamson said. “The (cross country) team practiced a few blocks from my house so me and my friend rode our bikes there. My friend was like, just come and run, and I liked it. I played soccer and ran (in eighth grade), but then in ninth grade I just ran because I liked it more. That’s when I focused on running.”\nFrom those humble beginnings Foster, a senior, and Williamson, a junior, have developed into two of the top cross country runners in the state. Foster is a two-time medalist at the PIAA Class 3A championships. Williamson is a three-time medal winner at the Pennsylvania Independent School Athletic Association championships.\nTheir dominance in cross country in the 2025 season earned them Runner of the Year honors from the Daily Times and a headline spot on the All-Delco team, selected by the Daily Times sports staff with input from county coaches..\nJoining Foster and Williamson on the All-Delco first team are Foster’s Haverford teammates Ryan Cleary and Sean Lawson; Agnes Irwin’s Emma Watson; Episcopal Academy’s Curtis Conner; Avery Lustgarten of Garnet Valley; Sloane Smith from Marple Newtown; Notre Dame’s Carson Tierney; Rowan Carr and Charles Mulholland of Penncrest; Radnor’s Connor Walsh and Katelyn Anderson; and Cayla Gaffney from Strath Haven.\nWilliamson and Carr are three-time first-team selections. Foster and Conner are two-time choices. Foster, Conner, Lawson, Lustgarten, Tierney and Watson are seniors. Williamson, Cleary, Mulholland, Carr, Walsh and Anderson are juniors. Smith is a sophomore and Gaffney is a freshman.\nWhile Foster set an individual goal of breaking the Haverford school record of 15:06, his main focus was leading the Fords to the PIAA championships as a team. He was part of the Haverford squad that made states as a group when he was a freshman in 2022, an experience he never forgot. He returned the Fords there this season.\nThat team-first mentality is typical of Foster, according to Haverford coach Matt Wells.\n“He was the heart and soul of the team,” Wells said. “He would have risked anything to get that team to states.”\nHaverford finished fifth as a team at the District 1 Class 3A championships to punch its ticket to Hershey, where the Fords placed 10th.\n“To be able to give that to the next group of guys coming up was really special,” Foster said.\nFoster put together an impressive senior season. He won the Delco championship, leading the Fords to the team title. He was third at the Central League championships, fifth at the District 1 meet and 11th at the PIAA championships. He also placed second in the Souderton Twilight Invitational and fifth in the Class 3A race at the 19th PIAA Foundation Invitational.\n“Having that goal of breaking the school record pushed me,” Foster said. “I didn’t get it but I came close.”\nFoster is going to MIT, which has been a power on the Division III cross country stage for a number of years. The Engineers won the national title in 2022, finished second in 2021 and have had five top-10 finishes since 2019. MIT has won five straight NCAA Division III East regional titles and seven of the last nine. The Engineers have won every New England Women’s and Men’s Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) men’s championship since the league was formed in 1998.\n“It’s been my dream school for a long time,” Foster said. “I love Iron Man (the Marvel comic and movie). Tony Stark went to MIT, and that planted the seed in my mind. It’s the place for R&D (research and development). I think R&D, the ability to create and develop something, is so cool. By my sophomore year, MIT became my No. 1 school.”\nWilliamson came to Episcopal in ninth grade. EA assistant coach Eric Mundy saw her at a CYO meet and convinced Williamson to take a visit, where she shadowed a student.\n“I loved it,” Williamson said. “It’s an awesome school.”\nA driven athlete, Williamson had a singular focus coming into the 2025 season. Her goal was to qualify for the Nike Nationals. Only the top two teams and the five best runners from the non-qualifying teams at regionals advance to the national meet.\nThis year, that meant she had to finish in the top five. She placed third at the Northeast Regional to earn All-Region honors and punch her ticket to Portland, Ore. Williamson placed 16th at nationals to earn first-team All-America honors.\n“It was exciting,” Williamson said of competing at nationals. “It was cool getting on a plane to go to a race and it was cool meeting all the girls. They’re such hard-working girls. To be around those girls was amazing.”\nThe rest of Williamson’s junior year resume is just as impressive. She won the Delco championship for the second year in a row to lead the Churchwomen to the first county team title in program history and first team championship by an Inter-Ac squad.\nAlong the way, Williamson also took first at the Paul Short Run, second at the PAISAA championship for the second year in a row and second at the 71st annual George School Invitational. A hip injury kept her out of the Inter-Ac League championships but gave her time to heal for the rest of the postseason. She was named Junior of the Year and first-team all-state by pa.milesplit.com, second-team all-state by the Pennsylvania Track and Field Coaches Association, and finished the season ranked 21st in the DyeStat.com top 100. The only runner in Pennsylvania to beat her this year was Penn Charter’s Mackenzie Skelly.\n“The thing I like about running is how you can challenge yourself,” Williamson said. “Even if you did something amazing, like setting records, you always want to do more. There’s always more to accomplish. That’s what I think is so great about the sport.”\nIf she had to pick a favorite between cross country and track, she leans toward cross country.\n“I think cross country is more tactical,” she said. “You don’t have to think about splits, you just grit it out, keep pace with the top runners and give it all you have.”\nAs for the future, Williamson has just started the college recruitment process.\n“I’m looking for a school that has a good distance program, where I can take running to the next level,” Williamson said.",
