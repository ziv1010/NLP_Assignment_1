  "body_text": "One moment stands out for Ben Osborn when it comes to learning what kind of character is required to be a professional footballer.\nPlaying in a behind-closed-doors game at the Nigel Doughty Academy, the midfielder let his frustration show when he was subbed off early in the second half: “I spat my dummy out.”\nAdvertisement\nOsborn was on the periphery of the first team and, in a game among many under-18s, he was upset at being withdrawn.\n“Gary Brazil absolutely caned me. He went for me. I was not playing great in the game but, as one of the older players, I thought I would be getting the most game time. He crucified me. Properly bawled me out,” Osborn tells The Athletic.\n“I thought that was me done at Forest. He hates me now, surely? But in the next session, I got my head down and tried to prove him wrong… and he was back to his old self. He never held a grudge.\n“That was the first time that really happened. But it stood out for me in my mind because it taught me something about needing to earn your opportunities.”\nThere are hundreds of young men who will have similar stories to tell about a man who has overseen the Nottingham Forest academy for the past decade having joined the club as a coach 11 years ago.\nAt Wembley, just over a year ago, Joe Worrall and Ryan Yates took a moment on the pitch to celebrate play-off success with Brazil, a man who stands out because of his grey (almost white) hair and ever-present smile. With their winners’ medals draped around their necks, Worrall and Yates playfully grabbed Brazil and tugged on his tie. Schoolboy japes from two men who had learned much from him when they had been of school age.\nSamba had just made the save. We were going to Wembley. Amongst the wild celebrations I saw a familiar, grey haired man more emotional than I’ve ever seen him before, with his head in his hands, already aware of the enormity of what was unfolding. Truly his boys were making… pic.twitter.com/oTaOQTxZW3\n— Forest FanBase 🔴⚪️ (@ForestFanBase) June 20, 2023\nThey, along with Brennan Johnson, are three academy products who have formed the spine of the side that made the step up from the second tier and retained Premier League status last season.\nAdvertisement\nOthers from the academy have moved on for respectable fees. In 2020, Forest sold Matty Cash to Aston Villa in a deal that could be worth £16million ($20.3m). In 2019, winger Arvin Appiah moved to Almeria for £8million, while Osborn — with his contract running down — went to Sheffield United in a transfer that could be worth up to £5million. The year before, Ben Brereton Diaz left for Blackburn (initially on loan) for £7million. In 2016, RB Leipzig paid Forest £13million for Oliver Burke.\nThis list may get longer, too. Forest value Johnson at at least £50million and if anyone comes up with the kind of money that could tempt Forest to sell this summer, then the money raised through the sale of academy products could pass the £100million mark.\nIn 2020, the work done by Brazil earned him a promotion to the role of head of football development; his remit was to play a part in shaping the ethos and philosophy of the club so that if (and when) the first-team manager changed, Forest’s overall approach would remain the same.\nThree years later, it is somewhat mystifying why, with his contract set to expire at the end of the month, Brazil is to depart. He has already stopped work. His office sits empty.\nForest’s hierarchy first started talking about not renewing his contract a year ago and, with that position now irreversible, The Athletic can reveal that the assistant academy manager, Chris McGuane, has been offered a promotion to take on a more senior role.\nMcGuane, who is set to be named as academy manager, took his current role in 2018 after eight years with Watford’s youth system, where he helped to nurture the talents of a young Jadon Sancho, now of Manchester United. He had previously been part of the youth development operation at Milton Keynes Dons.\nCraig Mulholland will also have considerable input in the new setup at the City Ground after leaving his position as Rangers academy director to be reunited with Ross Wilson, who left the Scottish club in April to take up the role of Forest’s chief football officer. Mulholland, however, will have a wider role than at his previous club. His remit will include the women’s team and overseeing loans, among other things.\nAdvertisement\nAmid lengthy speculation about the future of Warren Joyce, the other headline news is that the former Manchester United reserve-team manager has been offered, and accepted, a new contract to keep him in charge of Forest’s under-21s. Joyce was brought to Forest by Brazil in 2021 and led the club’s under-18s to the FA Youth Cup final in his first season.\nFor Brazil, however, his future lies away from Nottingham, even though no announcement has yet been made to confirm his departure. And that has saddened many fans as well as the man himself.\nChange, of course, is part of football. It happens at every club. But change normally comes following a failure. Brazil’s time in charge of the Forest academy cannot be viewed as that. Instead, he churned out a stream of young men, who were ready and prepared for the physical and mental rigours of first-team football.\n“He had such an attention to detail and made things so simple. You always knew exactly what he wanted on the pitch,” says Osborn, who was in the younger age groups when Brazil arrived and got his first-team debut during one of Brazil’s three spells as caretaker manager. “He helped you understand things on the pitch and was always a positive character.\n“He definitely has an edge to him that other people, outside of the club, might not see. If you went against one of his core values, you knew about it. If you made a technical mistake, he would be forgiving — but if you stepped outside of what they expected of you attitude-wise, that was a different story.\n“He was always fair, though. As you get older, you appreciate that. But he would take no shit and was a character who you would respect straight away.”\nThose core values were the driving force behind everything Brazil wanted to achieve at the academy. On one wall at the Nigel Doughty Academy is a line of pictures. Each is an image of a player who has made the step up from youth team to the first team, starting with players like Andy Reid, who is now on Steve Cooper’s coaching staff.\nAdvertisement\nAnother section of the wall provides a further source of motivation, the six qualities that staff wish to instil into players from the day they arrive: resilience, intelligence, energy, courage, humility and desire.\n“The staff have to live by those traits and the players are encouraged to as well,” Brazil said in a previous interview with The Athletic. “It is like having children. If you behave in a certain way as a parent, your kids will follow you. The kids who get to the first team probably have at least five of those traits.\n“We tell them all the time: ‘If you do this, you will have a better chance. If you behave like this, you will have a better chance’. The drive has got to come from them. What we have found is that the players who make it, they have all had something in their character that you can see early on.\n“Ryan Yates is ridiculous. If you could bottle the essence of him and put it into all the academy kids, you would be well away. It is the same with Joe Worrall. All the kids that have come through (into the first team), when you look back, there is always something in their make-up that makes you think: ‘He has a chance, he is going to have a career’.”\nA fantastic day for @NFFC! To Steve, his staff and players, amazing. This pic is so special. Watching these lads come through the younger age groups @NFFCAcademy to now play a part in taking their club back to the Premier League. Incredibly proud 🔴🌳❤️ pic.twitter.com/TnRCigAJ9K\n— Gary Brazil (@GazBraz) May 30, 2022\nWorrall has previously spoken about the impact his development through the academy has had on his career; about how young players are shaped into good characters whether they secure a future in the game or not. “There is a hierarchy at a football club. You are right at the bottom of that hierarchy when you are a scholar. You are right at the bottom of the food chain,” he said. “You have to clean the boots, you have to clean and tidy the dressing rooms.\n“I cleaned Billy Davies’ boots, as well as Danny Collins’ and Darius Henderson’s. It was learning about how to treat people and speak to people. That is something Gary Brazil was always big on. If you did not work hard, if you did not do the boots, if you did not do the dressing rooms, you did not play on a Saturday.\n“It will not set these young lads up for life exactly, but it will put them on a path towards that. Forest and the staff can take pride in that. Gary is one of the reasons Forest are still above water because of the money (raised from the sale of academy players) and because of the players who come through. We are all pieces of the jigsaw.\nAdvertisement\n“That comes down to Gary and the academy. They have brought us up brilliantly. It is like having a good school teacher — a headmaster, perhaps. You never take the piss and you do as you are told. And you learn so much.”\nForest’s successes at junior level have continued on the pitch. The under-18’s reached the final of the FA Youth Cup in May 2022, losing to Manchester United in a final staged in front of an almost full house at Old Trafford. Last season, the under-17’s reached the final of the Premier League Cup, losing to Tottenham Hotspur.\nDale Taylor, the 19-year-old Northern Ireland international striker, is likely to be the next academy product to challenge for a first-team place following his successful loan at Burton Albion. Although another loan move could aid his development.\nBut the next generation will not work under Brazil. Instead, one of the first tasks facing recently appointed chief football officer Ross Wilson is securing Brazil’s replacement.\n“When I heard Gary was leaving, I did spend a bit of time thinking about his approach and how he had an impact on people,” says Osborn. “I owe him everything for giving me my debut and for believing in me. But it was the players a year or two below me — it was when they came through that you started to really see what Gary is about. That was when you saw players like Joe Worrall, Ben Brereton Diaz, Oliver Burke and Ryan Yates.\n“I think Gary has always been aware of the type of traits you need to be able to make it as a professional footballer. Not only was he producing academy teams that were successful, but he would churn out players who were first-team ready.”\nOsborn’s first-team debut came in March 2014 in a 1-1 draw at Ipswich, during Brazil’s first spell as Forest caretaker manager.\n“The thing with him is that he always believed in you. I honestly felt that he believed in me more than I did, sometimes. I would be on the bench or training with the first team, but you are always thinking, ‘How am I going to cope at this level?’. You don’t have a clue until you have experienced it. Until you have come on the pitch and been thrown in at the deep end, you do not know,” says Osborn.\nAdvertisement\n“If he believes in you, if you see yourself holding your own at that level, you start to believe in yourself.\n“When he took over as caretaker manager that time, I was thinking, ‘Great, I might get a sniff here…’. But in his first game, I was not even on the bench. Fair enough. But when we did the shape for the next game, he talked me through my role as if it was just another game. He made it feel that way. I was a nervous wreck, but he convinced me that I was ready.\n“He told my parents to make sure they were there for it. That was a nice touch.”\nBrazil’s most memorable result came in January 2018, during his second stint as caretaker manager, when he oversaw a 4-2 win over Arsenal. Eric Lichaj scored twice, including a spectacular volley, but it was academy product Brereton Diaz who starred, tormenting the German international Per Mertesacker relentlessly with his pace.\n“When Gary was caretaker manager, the level of performance from players like Brereton Diaz went through the roof. He would give him so much belief that he just became an entirely different player,“ says Osborn.\n“We had seen glimpses of it in training. We knew he was a decent player, but he was not firing week in, week out. He was finding it difficult in the first team, in the early days — as we all do early on.\n“But in that game, with Gaz managing him: that is what he could do. He could see the potential in people better than anyone. You feel like you have to repay him.\n“Would my career have happened without him? I’m not sure. I always felt he would go into first-team management, there was no way he would stay in academy football. But you could also tell that he just loved his job. He loved helping young players to fulfil their potential.”\n(Top photo: Dan Mullan via Getty Images)",
