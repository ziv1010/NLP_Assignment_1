The prize, one of the most prestigious in the field of photojournalism, is supported by the Visa pour l’Image Association – Perpignan.\nAmidst the bombings, with death ever-present and the constant fear of being targeted, Mahmud Hams, who has worked for AFP for over two decades in the Palestinian territories, has relentlessly continued to document the war ignited by Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.\n“I spent my childhood in Gaza, and in 23 years of photojournalism, I have witnessed every war, every conflict there. But this war is unlike any other, without precedent from the very first day,” says Hams. “My colleagues and I have had to face incredibly difficult conditions, with no red lines and no protections for anyone. There were even attacks targeting journalists’ offices, which are supposed to be off-limits in times of war.”\n“Many journalists have been killed; others wounded. I’ve also lost friends and loved ones. We struggled to keep our families safe,” he explains. “Yet, despite the ever-present danger, I continued to cover the conflict because it is my duty, the one I chose when I embraced the profession of journalism.\n“I stayed calm, for my family, and to carry out my mission until the very last moment,” says Hams, who left Gaza with his family in February. “I hope the photos we take show the world that this war, and the suffering, must end,” he adds.\n- Mzansi Magic’s Shaka iLembe – the most nominated content overall: Set in the 1700s, Shaka Ilembe tells the story of the heroic rise of the iconic Zulu king, played as an adult by Lemogang Tsipa and a boy by newcomer Ntando Zondi.\n- Showmax Original Outlaws – the joint most-nominated telenovela with The River: Set in the lush but lawless land on the border between Lesotho and KwaZulu-Natal, Outlaws is the story of two families at war with each other: the Zulu, cattle-farming Biyela clan and the Basotho, cattle-raiding Ts’eoles.\n- Picture Tree’s twisty and twisted Showmax Original DAM S2, which is up for six SAFTAs\n- Empreinte Digitale’s extreme motorsports drama Spinners, which is up for three SAFTAs\n- Tshedza’s bromance Adulting, which is nominated for three SAFTAs.\n- Quizzical Pictures’ medical drama Hartklop, which is up for three SAFTAS for kykNET.\n- Homebrew Films’ cheerleader drama Trompoppie, which is up for two SAFTAs for Showmax.\n- Nagvlug Films’ church market drama series for kykNET, Mooiweer en Warm, which is up for Best Cinematography (Pieter Bezuidenhout).\nCalling all South African brands to celebrate excellence with the brand new SA Customer Experience Awards\nThe world-renowned **International Customer Experience Awards UK (ICXA™) has announced the launch of the South Africa Customer Experience Awards (SACXA), a groundbreaking initiative set to recognise and celebrate outstanding achievements in customer experience (CX) across various industries in South Africa.\n“While customer experience is at the heart of business success and ranked as high priority on the corporate strategy agenda, we encourage all organisations, regardless of size or industry, to take advantage of this extraordinary platform to make known, showcase and celebrate their achievements in the customer experience arena,” says Lynn Baker, CEO of the SACXA.\nThe South Africa Customer Experience Awards is poised to shine a spotlight on the organisations and professionals who are leading the way to demonstrate their innovative approaches and dedication to customer satisfaction.\nThe SA Customer Experience Awards is designed to recognise companies and their employees who have made significant contributions to the field of customer experience.

She later joined NBC News, where she was senior media editor. More recently she was chief media correspondent at Business Insider.\nRaised in the UK, Claire moved to New York in 1999 as she considered it “the centre of the media”, her passion, as well as “the centre of ambition”. Her parents were ravenous consumers of news media and she grew up wanting to be a journalist.\n“Journalism gives you a ringside seat to history,” she says. “Plus you get to interview some wild people that you’d normally never get to meet.”\nShe loves media and advertising because “it’s a ball that’s constantly in motion”. She adds: “I’m fascinated by commercial messaging and the way companies speak to us, as well as how the people in power speak to media, and how the media speak back.”\nCommenting on the benefits of a jury of journalists, she says: “We’re always looking for what’s new, what’s different. We spend our lives scouring the internet for stories, watching TV, reading the news. So I think we’re hyper-aware of innovative ways of communicating…As far as I’m concerned, if my eyes are open, I’m working.”\nInclusive Lens Award winners announced – FAME Week Africa celebrates diversity in entertainment\nAt MIP Africa’s first Inclusive Lens awards yesterday, Showmax won Representation of LGBTQIA+ awards for both Wyfie (Scripted Series) and Beaulah: Queens van die Kaap(Non-Scripted Series).",
