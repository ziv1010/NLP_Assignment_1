We therefore have invited every one of you today to inform you that the present leadership has failed us.\n\"We are members of Imo State Liberation Movement. Our membership cut across 27 Local Government of the state. We can be seen in all status of the society, artisans, market men and women, Okada riders, technicians, drivers, farmers and hunters etc. Our movement is grass- root oriented, but very apolitical,” the movement had said.\nAfter the governorship election, the candidates of the Labour Party and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Athan Achonu and Senator Samuel Anyanwu respectively had unanimously called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to review the results of the Saturday's election or cancel the entire election.\nThey had made the demand in joint press conference in Owerri, the Imo State capital, describing the election as an “open rape.”\nThe governorship candidates, who said they had expected the INEC to use the election to redeem itself from the shenanigans of the February 25 presidential election and March 18 governorship election, wondered how Nigerian people could trust the commission with its mantra of conducting a free, fair and credible election in Nigeria again.\nAchonu, who said INEC announced results of areas without any form of accreditation whatsoever, had added that \"where there was accreditation, results were already preloaded by 10 am in the morning even when voting was still ongoing.\"",
