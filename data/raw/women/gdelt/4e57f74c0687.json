  "body_text": "Yes, I’ve been looking at metaphor and analogy a lot lately. The uninspired play on the field demands it. How can you talk about a 4-2-3-1/3-2-4-1 hybrid or the demand for squad rotation due to the possibility of 11 matches in 36 days infinitely?\nThe club jettisoned its No. 3 centerback, their starting centerback is suspended and they will be forced to play without their starting right back for at least a match also due to a red. The latest injury report also has Nathan questionable (he’s a presumed starter if healthy, but… it’s 2024 and this is the Sounders).\nSchmetzer’s preferred XI went into the trash on Matchday 1 and we’ve never seen it this year. Platonic Ideal XIs in MLS don’t happen for more than a handful of games. This weekend won’t be one of those. It will not be close.\nIf Nathan is indeed out, the natural idea is to slide Nouhou to the LCB. Except the backup fullback has to start on the right and the other swing fullback is still out.\nSo maybe Cristian has to play at fullback. Or Jon Bell, he of zero MLS minutes this season, gets a start at left back where he’s only started twice in league play, both in 2022 with New England after their league matches didn’t matter.\nWhich means the attacking band gets forced to change, too. The ’natural’ thing to do there would be to start Léo Chú on the left with the too-frequently-awful-on-the-right Jordan Morris on the right, or Moose? Who knows – will it matter? Attacking Sounders don’t get touches in the 18, only their deeper bands do.\nA bad start to the season will get worse before it gets worse because the available choices aren’t good.\nDo you want hope? Sure. I want it too. So may hope lies in one of the themes from The Magicians. “Magic comes from pain.” That saying is how Eliot bridged the friendship gap with Quentin. It’s how Julia got her powers back. It is a phrase that was cyclic. The worst experiences get channeled into greatness.\nPain —> art is frequent trope in writing, because so many artists grow out of their pain. They channel it into greatness and glory.\nI’m asking the Sounders to create some magic, because the play on the field has been painful.\n– Dave Clark\nPurchasing the new jersey or planning to get MLS Season Pass?
