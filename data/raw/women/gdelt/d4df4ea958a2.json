Even with the WGA contract now settled, the calendar of 2023 TV premiere dates is an unqualified mess, with studios trying every trick in the book to fill their schedules with programming not impacted by the work stoppages.\nCBS is airing shows from other Viacom properties, including Season 1 of the hit Paramount Network series “Yellowstone,” which premiered in 2018. The CW is importing shows from Canada, Germany, and other countries to show to American audiences for the first time. Fox is bringing back Gordon Ramsay’s “Kitchen Nightmares” after an eight-year hiatus. Every single network is going big on game shows, reality, and other unscripted programming.\nAdvertisement:\nKeeping track of when your favorite show is coming back is a struggle as well, with studios changing their minds about programming on a daily basis.\nLast month, hosts Drew Barrymore and Bill Maher announced that their talk shows would be returning, before both changing their minds amidst criticism from union members. Since then, both shows have returned thanks to the WGA’s new contract, along with talk shows hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon, and the rest of the regular late-night hosts.\nWe’ve done our best to keep track of all of the 2023 TV premiere dates below, sorted into several categories. At the top of the list are shows that have scheduled premiere dates, followed by shows expected to debut in 2023 at an unknown date, and finally a list of shows that are unlikely to return in 2023.\nAdvertisement:\nNote: Any show that we’ve previously recommended in our weekly What to Watch guides will be marked with a popcorn emoji. 🍿\nSeptember 1:\nThe Wheel of Time (Prime Video, Season 2) 🍿\nDisenchantment (Netflix, Season 5)\nPower Book IV: Force (Starz, Season 2)\nDesigned Defined (Magnolia Network, new series)\nSeptember 3:\nMasterpiece: Unforgotten (PBS, Season 5)\nMasterpiece: Van der Valk (PBS, Season 3)\nProfessor T (PBS, Season 2)\nAncient Empires (History, new series)\nSeptember 5:\nOne Shot: Overtime Elite (Prime Video, new series)\nThe Real Housewives of Salt Lake City (Bravo, Season 4)\nMy Big Fat Fabulous Life (TLC, Season 11)\nWelcome to Plathville (TLC, Season 5)\nThe View (Syndicated, Season 27)\nTamron Hall (Syndicated, Season 5)\nSeptember 6:\nFC Barcelona: A New Era (Prime Video, Season 2)\nPredators (Netflix, new series)\nReporting for Duty (Netflix, new series)\nTahir’s House (Netflix, new series)\nInfamy (Netflix, new series)\n6ixtynin9 The Series (Netflix, new series)\nI Am Groot (Disney+, Season 2)\nNever Let Him Go (Hulu, new series)\nEvolution Earth (PBS, new series)\nAmerica Outdoors with Baratunde Thurston (PBS, Season 2)\nNightwatch (A&E, Season 7)\nYoung Dylan (Nickelodeon, Season 4)\nAmerica Outdoors with Baratunde Thurston (PBS, Season 2)\nCrime Scene Confidential (Investigation Discovery/Max, Season 2)\nSeptember 7:\nVirgin River (Netflix, Season 5)\nTop Boy (Netflix, Season 3)\nKung Fu Panda (Netflix, Season 3)\nGamera Rebirth (Netflix, new series)\nDear Child (Netflix, new series)\nStar Trek: Lower Decks (Paramount+, Season 4) 🍿\nThe Dead Files (Travel Channel/Max, Season 12B)\nRide with Norman Reedus (AMC+, Season 6)\nAdvertisement:\nSeptember 8:\nThe Changeling (Apple TV+, new series) 🍿\nSeptember 9:\nTiny Toons Looniversity (Cartoon Network/Max, new series)\nSeptember 10:\nThe Masked Singer (Fox, Season 10)\nThe Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon (AMC, new series)\nThe Ride with Norman Reedus (AMC, Season 6)\nSeptember 12:\nJeopardy!
