  "body_text": "On the road having to battle through several major injuries, the Chelsea Women fell short in what will be looked back on as a proud moment for the entire club.\nThat was Chelsea Football Club. With their backs against the wall in front of over 72,000 people on the road, Emma Hayes’ side showed true grit as they battled the best team in world football to the brink on the biggest stage. Barcelona has not lost a game at home in over four years, and with a one goal lead heading into the second leg, there was little faith the Blues would be able to stand a chance. Before the game, Hayes expressed how much her side is well equipped to suffer, and suffer they did. Despite having not created a single shot attempt in the first half, the belief was still present.\nBehind another brilliantly professional defensive display and a gameplan that nearly worked to perfection, the west Londoners were just one Caroline Graham Hanson goal away from forcing the match into extra time. Hayes’ team saw an increase in their pass accuracy by 14 percent compared to the first leg, keeping the ball in a hostile environment much more efficiently than they were able to do at Stamford Bridge.\nThe Spanish side conceded just their second goal so far this campaign at home in the 67′ as Guro Reiten smashed the ball into the back of the net to give her side a fighting chance in the final 23 minutes. Graham Hanson’s goal just a few minutes prior was enough to lift Jonatan Giraldez’s into their third consecutive European final. The 2021 champions will take on the winners of the Arsenal v Wolfsburg second leg which takes place at the Emirates Stadium on Monday night.\nFor Hayes’ side, the road in the UEFA Women’s Champions League concludes at Camp Nou, but the future is as bright as it can be. The west Londoners drew the toughest group to begin this European campaign and then were given a path that included the last two winners of this competition in order book a place in the final. With an injury list that includes Fran Kirby, Millie Bright, Kadeisha Buchanan, the west London side still managed to compete right beside the two juggernauts of European women’s football.\nEven with the Champions League trophy out of contention, the Blues still have a Women’s Super League title to win and an FA Cup final against Manchester United in the middle of May. One year ago, this club was months removed from European football, falling short all the way back in the group stage. This is a campaign that sets the stage for a battle tested side to come firing out of the gate next fall. While this is without question a disappointment for Hayes and her team, there are so many positives that this club can point to as they travel back to England to resume domestic play.",
