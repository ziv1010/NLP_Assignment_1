  "body_text": "TEEN CHARGED IN CHURCH ATTACK: Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz announced on April 12 that her office has charged a 16-year-old with first-degree assault, first-degree robbery and grand larceny for attacking an elderly woman on the steps of Saint Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church in Briarwood on April 7. The teen is accused of throwing the 68-year-old victim down a flight of cement stairs and then taking her purse and car keys and stealing her car while she lay on the street unconscious.\nIrene Tahliambouris, 68, sustained a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain. She remains in critical but stable condition, unable to stand or move on her own according to the DA’s office.\nThe alleged attacker was separately charged with robbery for an unrelated incident on April 4 during which he is accused of stealing another woman’s car. Arraignment is pending.\nDistrict Attorney Katz said: “The viciousness with which the defendant is accused of having committed the robbery at the church struck the city at its core. As alleged, he chose to rob an elderly woman by first pushing her down the stairs and then proceeded to take her purse and leave her to suffer while he took off in her car. He will now have to answer for the serious charges levied against him by my office. Thank you to NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny and the entire Detective Bureau for their relentless work.”\nThe defendant, of 89th Avenue in Jamaica, was charged in the April 7 incident with assault in the first degree, robbery in the first degree, assault in the second degree, two counts of grand larceny and criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree and criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree.\nHe was charged in the April 4 case with two counts of robbery in the first degree, two counts of robbery in the second degree, grand larceny in the third degree, robbery in the third degree, criminal possession of stolen property in the third degree, three counts of grand larceny in the fourth degree, criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree, menacing in the second degree, petit larceny and unauthorized use of a vehicle in the third degree.\nHe faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted.\nAccording to the charges:\n- On April 7, at approximately 9:15 a.m., Irene Tahliambouris, 68, was walking up a flight of stairs to enter Saint Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church at 84-35 152nd Street.\n- As Tahliambouris approached the top step, the defendant is seen on video surveillance running up the staircase beside her and then stepping in front of the victim.\n- The teen struck Tahliambouris causing her to fall backwards down the stairs landing headfirst on the concrete sidewalk, sustaining serious injuries.\n- Once the victim was on the ground, the defendant is seen on video surveillance picking up Tahliambouris’ purse which contained money, credit cards, her cell phone and car key. He can be seen putting his hands near the victim’s waist and pockets. The victim can be seen motionless on the ground.\n- The defendant is seen on video entering Tahliambouris’ 2006 Nissan Altima and driving it away.\n- Tahliambouris was taken to a local hospital with a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain. She remains in critical but stable condition, unable to stand or move on her own.\n- Following an extensive investigation by members of the 107th Police Precinct, with the assistance of the Queens District Attorney’s Office, the defendant was apprehended in front of his residence on April 11.\n- The teen has been separately charged with following a woman into an elevator at a building on 127th Avenue in Rochdale Village on April 4 at approximately 10:15 a.m.\n- He told the woman he followed her from a bank and saw her take money out and then demanded the money and her keys. He put his hand in his pocket and pointed what appeared to be a weapon at the woman. The victim gave the teen her car keys.\n- The teen is seen on video surveillance leaving the building and getting into the woman’s Toyota Corolla and driving away.\n‘SQUATTERS NOT ENTITLED TO TENANT PROTECTIONS’ In response to recent reports of squatters who take over private property in New York, State Senator John Liu and Assembly Member Ron Kim introduced legislation, S8996/ A9772, that will add strength and clarity to New York State’s housing laws by adding the definition of “squatter”.\nIncluding this definition in real property law will help to distinguish legal renters from those who unlawfully intrude and take over property. It also defines squatters as those without legal rights to the premises they occupy.\nThe legislation identifies the term “squatter” as one who enters onto a property or building without title, right, or permission, and therefore is not entitled to the same rights and protections as lawful tenants, occupants or owners. This legislation also makes it clear that squatters do not get any rights or protections even after 30 days.\nSenator Liu stated, “Recent incidents of squatters taking over private homes have hit a raw nerve for many in our community, whose homes are often their life’s savings. Housing law in New York State is often complicated and nuanced, but there’s one thing we all agree on: people who intrude into others’ homes should not have rights in state housing law, and this legislation codifies just that in simple and straight-forward language. We need to immediately enact this legislation and continue examining even stronger measures to protect homeowners without inadvertently putting renters at risk.”\nAssembly Member Kim stated that in New York City, squatters, posing as tenants, are taking advantage of property owners when in fact, they are breaking the law. He said, “Criminals looking to exploit property owners do not enjoy the same rights as tenants and will be brought to justice. Our legislation makes clear under no uncertain terms that squatters are thieves and do not have any rights in the state of New York. Thank you to my colleagues for taking up this issue, and we will work towards its passage over the coming days.”\nThe officials held a press conference outside the Queens house of squatter victim Dr. Young Seh Bae, who was successful in removing squatters from the residence she purchased in hopes of housing elderly disabled residents for her non-profit, Community Inclusion and Development Alliance.\nREGO PARK COMMUNITY EVENTS: Local elected officials announced two upcoming community events taking place in Rego Park during the month of April.\nThe first is a Community Cleanup that took place on Saturday, April 13 at 10am, beginning at PS 139 on 63rd Drive and Booth Street. The effort was organized by Assemblymember Catalina Cruz, Assemblymember Andrew Hevesi, Senator Joe Addabbo, Congressmember Grace Meng, and Queens Community Board 6. Event organizers provided all necessary supplies. Students will be able to claim volunteer service hours, with more than 15 students already having received credits through Assemblyman Hevesi’s spring cleanup series.\nThe second event is an Employment And Community Resource Fair organized by Assemblymember Catalina Cruz in partnership with Assemblyman Hevesi, the Queens Chamber of Commerce, and numerous local businesses. The fair will take place Friday, April 19 from 12-3pm at the Rego Park Library on 63rd Drive. Individuals may email CruzC@nyassembly.gov or HevesiA@nyassembly.gov for additional information.\n“Improving our constituents’ quality of life is one of our most important priorities. I am thrilled to join forces with Assembly Member Andrew Hevesi, Senator Joseph Addabbo, Jr., Congressmember Grace Meng, and Community Board 6 for this Community Cleanup in Rego Park. This collective effort reflects our shared commitment to not only preserving but enhancing the beauty and health of our community. We are also showcasing the power of civic engagement and the impact it has on maintaining cleaner, more vibrant neighborhoods for all,” said Assemblymember Cruz.\n“We have had very successful efforts in Rego Park in past years, and are excited to kick off these events for 2024,” said Assemblymember Hevesi. “Thanks to our partners at every level of government, the dedicated PS 139 Community, PS 139 Parents’ Association, and all of our business and civic organizations across the area. We are looking forward to great turnouts throughout the spring and summer.”\nBILL TO REPEAL CONGESTION PRICING: Assemblyman Michael Tannousis (R,C-Staten Island/Brooklyn) hosted a press conference on Monday, April 15 announcing the introduction of legislation that would repeal congestion pricing. As per the recent environmental impact study, congestion pricing would increase traffic disproportionately on Staten Island and the Bronx, which will lead to increased pollution in those areas. Additionally, congestion pricing increases the cost to drivers and commuters from areas outside of Manhattan and New York, compounding the skyrocketing cost of living.\nJoining Assemblyman Tannousis were Councilman Joe Borelli, Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Assemblyman Mike Reilly, and Assemblyman Sam Pirozzolo.\nA livestream will be available on Tannousis’ Facebook page.\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis released the following statement: “When it comes to the MTA’s congestion pricing scheme, New Jersey has it right. This week, New Jersey’s lawsuit against the MTA was heard in court to stop congestion pricing plan before it goes into effect this June.\n“Just like the lawsuit that I brought with Borough President Vito Fossella and other Staten Island elected officials, New Jersey is correctly arguing that its residents, just like those in the outerboroughs, will be subjected to more traffic congestion and pollution in their neighborhoods as people try to circumvent this new tax. That’s only commonsense. In fact, New York Post published an article (stating) that residents of the Upper West Side of Manhattan are already experiencing an increase in parking congestion with the deadline coming. In their rush to implement this $1 billion congestion pricing tax, Governor Hochul and the MTA refused to consider the impact on Staten Island, Brooklyn and other communities that will be negatively affected by it.”\nBIDEN FINALIZES GUN-SHOW LOOPHOLE: U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand released the following statement addressing President Biden’s finalization of a new rule that will save lives by “closing the gun-show loophole” and reducing the number of firearms sold without background checks: “President Biden has made combatting the epidemic of gun violence a top priority throughout his administration and this initiative moves us closer to a long-sought goal: universal background checks. This bold action will close the ‘gun-show loophole’ that allows gun dealers to sell firearms without performing background checks, which allows dangerous individuals like domestic abusers and felons to obtain guns. This effort, coupled with continued implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, makes our neighborhoods safer and has the potential to save countless lives.”\nSenator Gillibrand’s office notes she is a long-time champion for gun safety legislation. She wrote the Hadiya Pendleton and Nyasia Pryear-Yard Gun Trafficking and Crime Prevention Act, which formed the centerpiece of Bipartisan Safer Communities Act’s (BSCA) anti-gun trafficking provision. In December of 2023, Gillibrand unveiled her first-of-its-kind report analyzing the initial successes from the BSCA’s anti-gun trafficking section. As of February 2024, law enforcement had used the law to take over 2,000 illegal guns off the street and charge hundreds of suspected traffickers.\nLARGEST ALL-AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT IN 40 YEARS: New York City Mayor Eric Adams celebrated a historic win for affordable housing and economic development in the City of New York after the City Council voted to approve the Willets Point Phase 2 development as part of the Uniform Land User Review Procedure (ULURP). The complete Willets Point Transformation, which Mayor Adams announced in November 2022 with the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC), New York City Councilmember Francisco Moya, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, the New York City Football Club (NYCFC), and Queens Development Group (QDG), will feature the largest 100-percent affordable housing project in 40 years and include more than 150,000 square feet of new public open space, over 20,000 square feet of retail space, a 250-key hotel, and the city’s first soccer-specific stadium that will be privately financed by NYCFC.\nThe project is expected to generate over $6 billion in economic impact over the next 30 years – creating over 14,000 construction jobs and over 1,500 permanent jobs. Mayor Adams’ vision for the transformation of Willets Point builds on core goals in his “Rebuild, Renew, Reinvent: A Blueprint for New York City’s Economic Recovery“ and “Housing Our Neighbors: A Blueprint for Housing and Homelessness,” including leveraging neighborhood infrastructure investments to catalyze equitable community development and creating housing opportunities in neighborhoods with strong access to jobs, transit, schools, parks, and other amenities.\n“Housing is the goal – and with today’s City Council vote, I’m proud to say that we just scored the goal of the decade,” said Mayor Adams. “We’re bringing 2,500 affordable housing units, 150,000 square feet of public open space, thousands of good-paying jobs, and the city’s first soccer-specific stadium to a neighborhood in Queens that used to be known for its junkyards. We’re building a brand-new community out of the ‘Valley of Ashes’, and we couldn’t have done it without all our partners, including Councilmember Moya and the rest of the City Council, Borough President Richards, NYCFC, Queens Development Group, our union members, and everyone living in Willets Point who made their voices heard and demanded a new future for themselves. After today’s vote, we’reone step closer to delivering that future.”\n“I am incredibly excited and proud to have joined my colleagues on the City Council vote in supporting Willets Point Phase II Redevelopment Plan,” said New York City Councilmember Francisco Moya. “This once-in-a-generation project will create a community like no other in New York City, with access to all-affordable housing, a brand-new public school, and New York City’s only soccer-specific stadium. These amenities will support our children’s future, boost the local economy, and benefit our hardworking brothers and sisters in labor who are the backbone of this city. I am thrilled that the residents of my district and across the city will soon experience the completed Willets Point Development Project, and I am grateful to my fellow colleagues in government for recognizing the countless benefits this project will bring.”\nConstruction for the first phase of 100-percent affordable housing at Willets Point is already underway, a year ahead of schedule. In December 2023, Mayor Adams and city officials broke ground on the first 880 units of affordable housing, which are expected to be completed by the end of 2026. The next housing development to commence construction will be an additional 220 affordable homes set aside for low-income seniors.\nThe Willets Point Phase 2 project will deliver the remaining 1,400 of the 2,500 total affordable homes, as well as a new 250-key hotel, and a soccer-specific stadium that will be the permanent home of NYCFC. The 25,000-seat stadium will be the first privately-financed major league stadium in New York City in generations. No new parking will be created for the stadium. Instead, NYCFC will utilize parking at Citi Field on match and event days based on an agreement with the New York Mets. Additionally, the stadium will be the first fully-electric stadium in Major League Soccer and the first fully electric professional sports stadium in New York City. The stadium is expected to be completed and operational by the 2027 MLS Season. Phase 2 will also deliver key infrastructure that builds upon the work of Phase 1 and enables Willets Point to grow and function as the city’s newest neighborhood.\nWith the creation of a new soccer-specific stadium, Willets Point will become the city’s premier sports hub, with the New York Mets’ Citi Field and U.S. Tennis Association’s Billie Jean King National Tennis Center both within walking distance of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s Mets-Willets Point subway and Long Island Rail Road station.\nThe proposal was first recommended in 2018 by the Willets Point Task Force, a group of Queens stakeholders represented by state and local elected officials; Community Boards 3, 4, and 7; economic development groups; community-based organizations; and local civic associations. Over four months, the task force identified community priorities and produced recommendations for the city-owned land, including a scenario that reimagined the neighborhood as a hub for a new soccer stadium with public facilities, programmed open space with active and passive uses, and new homes at a range of affordability levels.\nThe 2,500 100-percent affordable homes will cover seven buildings, including one with 220 homes for low-income seniors. Additionally, QDG will participate in HireNYC, a city program that connects local residents to jobs. They will seek to achieve high standards of environmental sustainability through either LEED Gold U.S. Green Building Council certification or Enterprise Green Communities.\nNew York City has made a significant investment to support the development of the Willets Point neighborhood, including the remediation of close to 200,000 tons of contaminated soil and infrastructure investments, such as new streets, signage, sidewalks, curbs, trees, lights, draining, stormwater management, water mains, hydrants, sewers, and utilities. Additionally, because Willets Point is in a flood-prone area, the city is taking a holistic approach that centers on resiliency by raising the new streets and buildings out of the 100-year floodplain to protect from future storms.\n“As an original member of the Willets Point Task Force and a strong advocate for this Redevelopment Project, I am elated by the City Council’s vote today to approve the project and complete the ULURP process,” said Thomas J. Grech, resident and CEO, Queens Chamber of Commerce. “This community investment plan by NYCFC and Queens Development Group is a major win for the Queens neighborhood and business community. I applaud their hard work with teammates like Mayor Adams and Councilmember Moya, and I look forward to working with them in the future as they build New York City’s first soccer-specific stadium and welcome new jobs and businesses into the area.”\nKRISHNAN AGAINST STADIUM PROJECT: New York City Council Member Shekar Krishnan, representing the Queens communities of Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, and Woodside, issued the following statement as he voted against a rezoning to allow the construction of a United Arab Emirates-controlled soccer stadium on city-owned lands at Willets Point: “Over generations, there have been multiple failed attempts to transform Willets Point in Queens to unlock its future potential and to mitigate its polluted past.\n“At the heart of the matter today, there is a simple question: How do the people of New York City benefit from this project and what will we receive in return for the hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer money to be spent on it?\n“Since the 2008 rezoning vote of Willets Point, over the twists and turns of this project, we have seen a massive reduction in the amount of housing it will produce. Originally promising over 5,000 units, we now see that number divided in half to make way for a commercial soccer stadium. A soccer stadium that will be controlled by one of the wealthiest men on the planet whose riches were generated by a monarchy exploiting and suppressing its people and its land. The economics and ethics of this transaction must be questioned.\n“This is a bad deal for New York City. And this is a terrible precedent for land use. A stadium on public land, subsidized by hundreds of millions in public funds, is not a good deal. This stadium will not be paying property taxes. It will not be making payments in lieu of taxes. And it will pay almost nothing in rent over the next 50 years. And for what gain for our city? The project offers anemic job creation and an embarrassing absence of any meaningful community benefit.\n“A development on city-owned land requires special scrutiny. We must have clear goals and serious oversight mechanisms to protect the public’s interest. The tremendous expenditure of public funds anywhere should guarantee a direct and public benefit. We must seek to solve the problems of our time and we must meet the moment we live in.\n“We do not have a stadium crisis in our city. We have a housing crisis. We have a crisis of unemployment and extreme inequality in our Black and Brown communities. And we have a climate emergency that gets worse everyday. This project fails to address any of these urgent concerns and squanders an opportunity to use these scarce, public resources for the people of New York City.\n“For all these reasons, I vote no.”\nRICHARDS’ STATE OF BORO: With an eye toward a future rooted in justice for all Queens families, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards delivered his 2024 State of the Borough address on April 12, championing historic investments in affordable housing, economic development, clean energy, education and more, that his administration has made over the past year.\nThe full text of Borough President Richards’ address, as prepared for delivery, can be found by visiting queensbp.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/state-of-the-borough-2024-as-prepared-for-delivery.pdf.\n“My friends, I have faith in you. I have faith in us. The state of our borough is stronger than ever because I have faith in our shared mission: To create a borough rooted in justice for all 2.4 million of us,” said Borough President Richards. “To overcome the cruelty and hardship of our world and build a borough that transcends our divisions. To not be prisoners of fate, but pioneers of a future worthy of our families.”\nDelivered in the Claire Shulman Theatre within Flushing Meadows Corona Park’s iconic Queens Theatre for the second consecutive year, Borough President Richards’ State of the Borough address “drew heavily from the numerous historic injustices Queens families have endured for generations across the spectrum of society,” noted his office. “In his address, the Borough President put forth a bold vision to root out those inequities in housing, education, employment, the environment and more.”\nSome of the speech’s major highlights included:\n- The announcement of a diversity tech and innovation center – to be constructed in Long Island City – with the goal of connecting historically marginalized Black and brown entrepreneurs to the borough’s blossoming tech ecosystem.\n- A call on city government to fund the construction of hydroponics labs in every New York City public school, building on Borough President Richards’ efforts to dramatically scale up the number of such labs in Queens schools.\n- A celebration of historic affordable housing and community development projects at Willets Point in Northern Queens, the Creedmoor campus in Eastern Queens and across Far Rockaway, as well as a comprehensive neighborhood plan to rezone much of downtown Jamaica.\n- Borough President Richards’ historic allocation of more than $30 million to Queens schools, $20.2 million to borough parks, $14.4 million for Queens healthcare institutions and more this year.\n- A comprehensive look at Borough President Richards’ efforts to transform Queens into the nation’s leading clean energy hub through the reimagining of the Ravenswood Generating Station, the development of the Champlain Hudson Power Express and other climate-related projects.\nRichards’ State of the Borough address was preceded by introductory remarks from retired NASA astronaut Dr. Ellen Baker – the daughter of the late former Queens Borough President Claire Shulman. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams also offered pre-address remarks.\nDeputy Queens Borough President Ebony Young served as the event’s emcee and offered welcoming remarks, as did Queens Theatre Executive Director Taryn Sacramone, followed by FDNY Firefighter Michael Green-Gregg’s rendition of The Star-Spangled Banner and the NYPD Guardians Gospel Choir’s renditions of both “Lift Every Voice and Sing” and the Kirk Franklin song, “Melodies from Heaven.”\nHighlighting the unmatched diversity of Queens, the program featured musical performances by acclaimed Queens-based saxophonist Steven Salcedo and his band, as well as vocalist Greta Scott of Joe’s Academy of Music, located in St. Albans. The Queensboro Dance Festival also performed the Tinikling, a traditional Filipino folk dance.\nA short film about Borough President Richards’ efforts to create a more just Queens, created by New York City-based production company Reframe the World, kicked off the program. The short film can be found at www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZG0aQ-IXXQ.\nThe 2024 State of the Borough address was sponsored by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Long Island City-based JetBlue Airways, Delta Air Lines and BRP Companies.\nPROBLEM GAMBLING AWARENESS WRAPS UP: In recognition of Problem Gambling Awareness Month (PGAM), Resorts World buildings were lit up in yellow throughout March as encouraged by the New York State Gaming Commission. In addition to rewarding employees by random selection for their participation in completing UKG trainings, Resorts World also attended the New York Council on Problem Gambling (NYCPG) 2024 conference.\n“Resorts World believes guests should have a safe, responsible gaming experience as well as get the help they deserve should they need it,” said Meghan Taylor, Senior Vice President of Government Affairs and Public Affairs. “Our Problem Gaming Committee has developed best-in-class standards that strive to exceed what is required of us, and we work collaboratively with a host of stakeholders to constantly improve our programs. Whether through our mandatory staff training or Responsible Gaming Resource Center, we have worked diligently to create a safe, welcoming, and discrete environment to help anyone who needs help.”\nDuring PGAM, Resorts World hosted a live training in partnership with a representative from NYCPG. The representative also met with Resorts World management to further create awareness and provide resources around problem gambling.\nResorts World recently renovated its Responsible Gaming Support Center, which among other things now includes more support literature in Chinese. Internally, Resorts World has formed a Responsible Gaming and Problem Gambling Committee, whose objectives are to protect patrons, educate customers and staff on the risks of gambling addictions, train employees how to identify signs of a person at risk of irresponsible gaming, engage the community on the issue, and ensure all marketing is socially responsible.\nnnual New York State conference focused on continuing support, education and engagement to reduce problematic gambling. Individuals, agencies and communities alike joined together to raise awareness around problem gambling and prevention as well as ensuring adequate support services throughout New York state.\nResorts World has a strong Self-Exclusion Program in collaboration with the New York State Gaming Commission. Guests may voluntarily enter this program by filling out the appropriate paperwork to bar themselves from entering a Resorts World property for an allotted amount of time or indefinitely.\nGenting Group, Resorts World’s parent company, has historically sought to foster a responsible gaming environment. Resorts World has continued that corporate responsibility at all its New York properties.\nThe goal has always been to exceed what is required by adopting international best-in-class standards on responsible play. In collaboration with the New York State Gaming Commission (“NYSGC”), the NYCPG, and the Office of Addiction Services and Supports (“OASAS”), Resorts World continuously works to develop, strengthen, and enact its responsible gaming standards with additional support from team members, community leaders, and healthcare providers.\nANALYZING SCHOOL GOVERNANCE: State Senator John C. Liu, Chair of the Senate Committee on NYC Education, and State Senator Shelly Mayer, Chair of the Senate Committee on Education, stated the following about the recent SED report on mayoral control.\nThe 281-page report comes two years after the most recent extension of mayoral control in 2022, which included a provision that SED conduct a comprehensive review and assessment of the overall effectiveness of the City of New York’s school governance system.\n“The report is an objective and authoritative review of school governance in New York City over the last 50 years and other models of school governance from around the country. It will be invaluable in legislative deliberations and decision-making as the June expiration of mayoral control approaches. We are highly appreciative of Commissioner Betty Rosa and her team of educational professionals at the State Education Department and look forward to thoroughly digesting their findings and recommendations as we take up the important matter of school governance in NYC once the state budget is enacted.”\n‘BOOST SECURITY AGAINST SHOPLIFTING’ Assemblymember Ron Kim, Chair of the Assembly Committee on Aging, Assemblymember Nily Rozic, and the Flushing Chinese Business Association announced on April 11 their efforts to combat shoplifting in stores during the state budget negotiations. The two lawmakers and the well-known commerce association have been meeting with small business owners in their districts to address concerns with crime and petty theft that have affected working class entrepreneurs throughout their communities.\nAfter listening to constituents and receiving their feedback on these issues, they revealed a new, promising proposal that supports small businesses and mom-and-pop stores in their fight against shoplifting. The measure is one they have both been consistently advocating for this legislative session, and that they have directly requested the governor to include in the final 2024 state budget bill.\nEPA FINALIZES NAT’L DRINKING WATER STANDARDS: U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is applauding the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for finalizing the first-ever national drinking water standard for per- and polyfluoralkyl substances (PFAS), which represents a major step forward in the fight to combat PFAS pollution. The final rule establishes legally enforceable limits, called maximum contaminant levels (MCLs), for PFAS in drinking water. The MCLs published that day reflect those called for in Senator Gillibrand’s Protect Drinking Water from PFAS Act, which would have required EPA to establish a national standard for PFAS in drinking water, as well as MCLs for certain PFAS chemicals.\n“It is unacceptable that toxic PFAS chemicals are infiltrating water systems in New York and across the nation,” said Senator Gillibrand. “I’m grateful that the EPA has heeded my call and for the first time is setting enforceable limits on toxic, cancer-causing PFAS chemicals contaminating our drinking water. My Protect Drinking Water from PFAS Act helped lay the groundwork for EPA to set these unprecedented limits and provided direction for the new national standard. I also applaud Administrator Regan and President Biden for making nearly $1 billion in funding available to help communities comply with the rule’s requirements. Clean water is an essential right that all Americans deserve and I will continue to fight to protect our communities from the impacts of PFAS chemicals.”\nADDABBO VS DRUGGED DRIVING: NYS Senator Joseph P. Addabbo, Jr. is urging his colleagues to support legislation (S.3135) that will fix the drugged-driving loophole, while also raising awareness about the dangers of these incidents through a 2-part series of his podcast called “Where Do We Go From Here?” In both segments, two families tragically impacted by drugged driving crashes share their stories.\nIn part one of Addabbo’s podcast, Henry Rivera Sr. and his wife Migdalia Rivera tell the story of their son, Henry Alexander Rivera, 18, and his friend Pedro Hernandez, 20, who were killed by a motorist high on cocaine. The assailant only received 8 years in prison for both fatalities. In part two of the podcast, Kristin Ruggles and her mother Kathleen Farrell speak about the crash that changed their family forever. Kathleen Farrell was severely injured, and her husband Dennis Farrell succumbed to injuries sustained during a head-on collision caused by an individual impaired by alcohol and Xanax. A common denominator in many drugged driving crashes, the Riveras and the Farrells included, involves repeat offenders.\nThe bill, S.3135/A.174 co-sponsored by Addabbo, fixes a critical drugged driving loophole in state law. Currently under New York State law, a drug-impaired driver cannot be arrested and prosecuted without naming the specific drug used by the operator as one on the Public Health Law 3306 list. As a result, drug-impaired drivers refusing to name what substance they are using or agreeing to take an identifying test can avoid substance abuse screening, treatment, and drugged driving license repercussions. An arrest and prosecution is legally insufficient if the drug cannot be named no matter how impaired the driver is.\nThe same is true if the driver is using a substance or drug that is not on the list – like the constantly altered versions of K-2 and the growing use of “tranq” – which causes zombie-like effects. Regardless of how high a tranq-impaired driver is, an arrest is not allowed because xylazine is not on the Public Health Law list.\nThe fatalities and tragedies that occur with drugged driving know no boundaries,” Addabbo said. “This isn’t a political matter. It’s about doing the right thing for people and making our roads safer. It’s about passing Senate Bill 3135, to ensure that moving forward, the fatalities, the incidents that could have been avoided, are avoided. Too often, our government reacts to fatalities and tragedies when we have the power to prevent, and that is why we’re here, to prevent, and save a life.”\nSenator Addabbo’s podcast can be viewed on his YouTube channel at the links below.\nSenator Addabbo’s Drugged Driving Podcast (Part 1) with Henry & Migdalia Rivera https://youtu.be/SiskHRdUvxA\nSenator Addabbo’s Drugged Driving Podcast (Part 2) with Kristen Ruggles & Kathleen Farrell https://youtu.be/E81w4MN98GM\nANIMAL PROTECTION APPROVED: The Senate passed Senator Joseph Addabbo’s legislation to expand animal protections and strengthen rules for the treatment of pets. The proposed legislation includes provisions that strengthen anti-slaughter laws; clarify the law on aggravated cruelty towards animals; and enact “Tucker’s Law.” The approval of this package of bills coincides with Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Month, making a concerted effort to elevate the humane treatment and well-being of those who can’t advocate for themselves.\nSenator Joseph P. Addabbo, Jr. said, “In protecting our voiceless companions, we strengthen our humanity. These bills are crucial steps in ensuring the well-being and dignity of our animal friends, and I am proud to support these measures that uphold their rights and welfare. My bill, S.6796, aims to protect our beloved racehorses and uphold their dignity. By strengthening enforcement measures and imposing stricter penalties, we send a clear message that the inhumane treatment of these majestic animals will not be tolerated in our state.”\nMore specifically, Addabbo’s bill, S.6796A, would strengthen enforcement efforts of the state’s anti-slaughter of racehorses and racehorse breeding stock law by requiring the posting of signage that states it is illegal to sell or transfer such animals for slaughter at all racehorse auctions.\nAdditional legislation passed by the Senate includes:\n- S.761 (Addabbo co-sponsor) – Clarifies the Felony for Aggravated Cruelty to Animals: Eliminates the word “serious” from the “serious physical injury” language of the Agriculture and Markets law, relating to aggravated cruelty to animals to ensure that someone who attempts to harm an animal physically is appropriately penalized even if the assault is not successful and the animal makes a full recovery.\n- S. 5325 (Addabbo co-sponsor) – Enacts Tucker’s Law: “Tucker’s law” removes the provision that provides that any term of imprisonment for a violation of aggravated cruelty to animals may not exceed two years.\nIn June 2014, an English bulldog named Rocky was the victim of a heinous act of cruelty when a neighbor threw ammonia in his face to quiet his barking. By the time Rocky was brought to the vet, he had ulcers in both eyes and the vet wasn’t sure if he would regain his sight. Thankfully, Rocky recovered but that outcome also gave the perpetrator a way out. Due to the felony animal cruelty statute, a charge could not be sustained because Rocky’s recovery conflicted with the prosecutor’s interpretation of “serious physical injury.” Since Rocky fully recovered, the perpetrator faced a much lower penalty. The perpetrator was given a conditional discharge after being convicted of misdemeanor animal cruelty charges, forced to pay $1,000 to the ASPCA for the dog’s medical treatment, and banned from going near Rocky or ever owning a dog. Legislation S.761, eliminates the word “serious” from the statute to fix the loophole when a person’s actions were intended to cause extreme physical pain or conducted in an especially depraved or sadistic manner, only requiring proof that the animal was killed or injured.\nIn 2022, a man pleaded guilty to several acts of animal cruelty occurring within weeks of each other. He fatally beat two puppies and injured a third resulting in a lost leg. One of the deaths involved a shepherd mix named Tucker. Tucker was adopted out from North Shore Animal League and then beaten so badly that he died a week later from a kidney rupture. The man eventually admitted to intentionally inflicting deadly blunt-force trauma on Tucker and the other animals involved.\nWhile the man committed three separate crimes, he could only serve the maximum sentence of two years in prison. Under current law and without enacting S.5325 changes, aggravated animal cruelty carries a sentence of two years regardless of how many acts of violence are committed against multiple animals.\nAddabbo’s bill, S.6796A, passed the Assembly on March 25 and now awaits the Governor’s signature to become law. The two other approved animal welfare bills, S.761 and S.5325 are under consideration by the Assembly Agriculture Committee.\nSTATEMENTS ON IRAN’S ATTACK ON ISRAEL: U.S. Rep. Grace Meng (D-NY), a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, issued the following statement on Iran’s attack on Israel following Israel’s airstrike that destroyed the Iranian consulate annex in Syria, killing 16 people:\nMeng said, “I condemn in the strongest terms Iran’s drone and missile attack on Israel, which comes in retaliation for Israel’s targeting of General Zahedi who Iran praised for his role in planning the October 7 attacks. I pray for the Israeli people, whose resolve will not be broken by Iran, its proxies, or any of its enemies. Israel maintains the right to respond and defend itself, and I thank President Biden for making America’s commitment to Israel’s defense crystal clear.\n:Once again, I demand that Speaker Johnson stop delaying and bring the Senate-passed national security supplemental bill for a vote this week. Iran and Russia must know that America will not waiver in its support for Israel and Ukraine in the face of continued terrorism and destabilization.\n“In Queens, many of my constituents are just learning of this attack as Shabbat ends. Many have friends and loved ones in Israel, and this only worsens the loss and pain they have felt since October 7. My office stands ready to help those in my district who need assistance.”\nAssemblywoman Jenifer Rajkumar likewise condemned Iran’s retaliatory attack against Israel: “I condemn the Iranian regime’s unconscionable act of aggression against Israel last night. Iran’s attack threatens to escalate warfare and destabilize the region. Iranian missiles and drones endangered sites holy to Muslims, Jews, and Christians alike. We must all stand united against the aggression of Iran and its terrorist proxies.\n“I am proud that the United States of America provided aid to finance the David’s Sling and Iron Dome air defense systems, which intercepted 99% of all Iranian missiles and drones. But tragically, a 7-year-old Israeli-Bedouin girl was severely injured by shrapnel from an Iranian missile. It is innocent civilians like her who suffer most during war, and the nations of the world must come together and use every diplomatic tool to prevent further war and destruction.\n“I stand in steadfast solidarity with New York’s Jewish community, the largest outside Israel. This is a time when the Jewish community should be preparing to celebrate Passover with their loved ones. Instead, the community finds itself having endured more than six months of violence against Israel and rising antisemitism in New York City. Since October 7th, our city has witnessed over 250 antisemitic hate crimes.\n“Last night, I spoke with Mayor Adams and the NYPD, who have deployed law enforcement to ensure the safety of Jewish religious and cultural institutions in New York City. They also informed me that there is currently no specific threat in New York City. Thank you to Mayor Adams, Governor Hochul, and our local law enforcement for working with us to secure our many Jewish institutions.\n“As hate threatens to rip us apart, New Yorkers must lead by continuing to build bridges of peace. We are the city of inclusion, a gorgeous mosaic of many cultures and faiths. We must stand united against the Iranian regime, its terrorist proxies, and the hate they seek to spread.”\nQUEENS TECH & INNOVATION CHALLENGE FINALISTS: Queens Borough President Donovan Richards Jr. and the Queens Economic Development Corporation have announced the 15 finalists in the 2024 Queens Tech + Innovation Challenge (QTIC), a five-month instruction-and-funding competition.\nQTIC is a continuation of the StartUP! competition that has been offered for more than a decade.

The bill grants municipalities across the State, including New York City, the authority to immediately shutter all illegal, unlicensed smoke shops once and for all. Joining the Assemblywoman will be her Albany colleagues, Tiffany Fulton of Silent Voices United, Inc., Darrell Fulton of Medianus, Inc., Ruth McDaniels of Breaking the Chains of Your Mind, Gilda Gillim of Tulinde, LLC, Prime Freedmen of United Sons & Daughters of Freedmen, and many more members of the Harlem community, most importantly 30 Harlem children who would be endangered by the opening of an illegal shop next door to them.\nThe rally called upon Albany leadership to include the SMOKEOUT Act in the State’s enacted budget. Harlem families, outraged that an unlicensed smoke shop is opening next to Heaven’s Tiny Tots Daycare and Learning Center run by Tameka Silva, are converging on the capital to call for municipalities to be granted the power to immediately close illegal shops.\nCo-sponsoring the SMOKEOUT Act are State Senators Leroy Comrie, Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., Brad Hoylman-Sigal, Rob Rolison, and Bill Weber; and Assemblymembers Michael Benedetto, George Alvarez, John Zaccaro Jr., Sam Berger, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Alicia Hyndman, Anil Beephan Jr., Juan Ardila, Grace Lee, Keith Brown, Joe Angelino, Marianne Buttenschon, Brian Cunningham, and Monica P. Wallace.\nTuesday’s rally marked another stop on Assemblywoman Rajkumar’s “Operation: SMOKEOUT’’ tour, which has already made stops at City Hall, Times Square, Queens, the Bronx, and Harlem. Every rally has drawn support from elected officials, business leaders, community leaders, and New Yorkers of every background.\nIllegal smoke shops are able to operate with almost total impunity because local municipalities lack authority to enforce cannabis law violations. The State’s Cannabis Control Board in Albany has the sole authority to shutter smoke shops, and it has only closed nine. The Cannabis Control Board has 14 inspectors for the entire State, and lacks the resources and manpower that local municipalities have to shut down the shops.\nUpon passage of Assemblywoman Rajkumar’s SMOKEOUT Act (Stop Marijuana Overproliferation and Keep Empty Operators of Unlicensed Transactions), New York City and all municipalities across the State will have the authority to close illegal smoke shops and seize all merchandise.\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams has endorsed the SMOKEOUT Act, and he has said it will allow him to close all the illegal smoke shops in New York City within 30 days.\nThe SMOKEOUT Act has also been endorsed by the Editorial Boards of the New York Daily News, New York Post, Buffalo News, and Queens Chronicle.\nThe SMOKEOUT Act has also been endorsed by major organizations including Times Square Alliance, the Partnership for New York City, the East Midtown Partnership, the Cannabis Association of New York, the New York Cannabis Retail Association, New York City Sheriff Anthony Miranda, and law enforcement across the State.\nIllegal smoke shops have ballooned in number exponentially the past 3 years. There are now an estimated 36,000 illegal smoke shops in New York State, including approximately 3,000 in New York City alone.\nWINNERS OF CONGRESSIONAL APP CONTEST: U.S. Rep. Grace Meng (D-Queens) announced the winners of her congressional app contest, and securing first place is a team of three local high school students: Rachel Wu of Fresh Meadows, Yuan Gao of Flushing and Eugene Xu of Bayside.\nMeng’s competition, which consisted of entries from students in middle school and high school, is part of the “Congressional App Challenge,” a nationwide contest held by the House of Representatives in which students compete by creating and exhibiting an app for mobile, tablet or computer devices.\nWu, Gao and Xu, along with the winners from app contests in congressional districts throughout the United States, will now have their apps displayed for one year in the U.S. Capitol and on the House of Representatives’ official website, www.house.gov. They and the other winners have also been invited to showcase their apps to Members of Congress at #HouseOfCode, a special reception scheduled to take place on Capitol Hill this month.\nWu, Gao and Xu are seniors at Bronx High School of Science. The app they developed allows users to locate the closest available free bathrooms in public spaces along with corresponding information and reviews of those locations. It also provides the nearest free bathrooms in cafes, bookstores and other public establishments to provide a comprehensive and easily accessible resource for those who need to find a restroom.\nA YouTube video that the three students created to demonstrate and explain their app – which was required under the rules of the contest – can be viewed online.\n“I congratulate these talented students for winning this year’s app competition, and applaud Rachel, Yuan and Eugene for coming up with a unique and innovative app that can help many people when they are out in public,” said Congresswoman Meng. “I’m excited that their entry will be showcased in the Capitol and on the House website, and I continue to be amazed by the great tech skills that are exhibited by students in our communities. Thank you to all who worked to develop an app for the contest. I am proud of all the students for their hard work.”\n“New Yorkers have the shared experience of being unable to find a clean, accessible or free bathroom,” said Wu, Gao and Xu. “We’re extremely grateful to win this award, and we hope to publish our app in the near future to help prevent this modern issue.”\nIn addition to Wu, Gao and Xu, there were second and third place winners for Meng’s contest. They include the following students:\n- Second Place: Erin Yalin Cai, Frankie Chong and Chiming Wang for creating a web app that uses artificial intelligence to help users find personalized social welfare programs.\n- Third Place: Aaron Niyazov and Jordan Krishnayah for developing an app that provides a news headline bias detector, where users can submit a news headline and gain a bias rating of it. The detector takes into account inflammatory terms as well as the sentiment of the headline.\nAll first, second and third place students recently met with Meng in her Northeast Queens office where they discussed and showed her their apps. The Congresswoman also presented them with special certificates of congressional recognition.\nParticipants of the contest were permitted to compete individually or in teams of up to four students. All of the apps were required to be original in concept, design and execution.\nThe winners of Meng’s competition were selected by a panel of local judges who work within the academic, tech and coding fields. They include:\n- Ying Zhou, Executive Director of the Tech Incubator at Queens College.\n- Jukay Hsu, Co-Founder and CEO of Pursuit, a social impact organization that trains people for tech careers.\n- Becky Houran, Program Implementation Manager at Girls Who Code.\n- Jin Hyun Bae, Assistant Director of Digital Inclusion for the Programs and Services Department at the Queens Public Library.\n- Ray Ferrer, Senior Digital Learning Curriculum Developer at the New York Hall of Science.\nSince the national Congressional App Challenge’s inception in 2015, thousands of functional apps have been created by over 58,000 students from all across the country.\n11,334 students registered for this year’s competition and 3,645 fully functioning apps were entered. 374 Members of Congress from across 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Mariana Islands, American Samoa and the District of Columbia participated. This year’s contest also set the record for most student registrations and most apps submitted.\nThe Congressional App Challenge was created to encourage students to learn to code and inspire them to pursue careers in computer science.\nLAGCC’S TWO GOLDWATER SCHOLARS: LaGuardia Community College/CUNY announced that Amena Shamia, Biology major from Bangladesh, and Allen Chien, Computer Science major from Taiwan, have been named as recipients of the Barry Goldwater Scholarship [goldwaterscholarship.gov], one of the oldest and most esteemed national scholarships for STEM majors in the United States. The 2024 Goldwater Scholars include 438 college students selected from a pool of more than 5,000 applicants. Of the 438 scholars, 32 are from New York State colleges and universities—only three of which are from community colleges.\n“I’m absolutely thrilled and beamed with joy about being selected as a Goldwater Scholar! It’s an incredible honor and I feel deeply acknowledged,” said Amena. “This recognition means a lot to me, validating all the hard work and dedication that I’ve poured into my academic pursuits over the last years. I owe a huge debt of gratitude to my mentors, professors whose guidance and support have been invaluable in shaping my journey.”\n“Being selected as a Goldwater Scholar means that my efforts and my dedication in conducting research has paid off and is acknowledged by the community,” said Allen.\nGoldwater Scholars are selected based on their academic merit, commitment to a STEM research career, display of “intellectual intensity,” and potential for making a significant contribution in their future field of study. LaGuardia Community College is a leader in graduating tomorrow’s STEM workforce. As reported [nycfuture.org] by the Center for an Urban Future, LaGuardia graduates more students with STEM degrees than nearly all other CUNY colleges and graduate schools.\nAmena enrolled at LaGuardia in Spring 2022, alongside her two siblings—the first in their family to pursue college degrees—shortly after moving to New York City following the decimation of their family’s farming business in Bangladesh. “We were sad to leave the country of our ancestors but were excited about the opportunities for a better education in America,” said Amena.\nAt LaGuardia, Amena found opportunities for hands-on learning that complements her scientific studies. As a member of the CUNY Research Scholar Program (CRSP), Amena worked on a bio-informatics research project with Dr. Claudette P. Davis, associate professor of Biology and director of the Biology Program at LaGuardia. And through CUNY LifeSci NYC [lifesci.nyc], Amena worked as a research assistant with the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, “I love working in a wet lab. In the beginning, working with viruses and plasmids in the lab at Columbia was intimidating, but I got the hang of it,” she said.\nHer fellow LaGuardia Goldwater Scholar, Allen Chien, of Kaohsiung, Taiwan, credits his mentors at LaGuardia for their guidance: Dr. Praveenkumar Khethavath, Professor and Computer Science Program Director; Dr. Midas Tsai, Chemistry Professor; and Dr. Maria Entezari, Natural Sciences Professor.\n“I think LaGuardia was a good starting point for me,” said Allen, who graduated from LaGuardia in December 2023, at the conclusion of the Fall I session, and is now pursuing his bachelor’s degree in computer science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.\nAmena Shamia aims to earn a Ph.D. in Microbiology and Immunology. She aspires to become a scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Her mentors include Dr. Claudette Davis; Dr. Tonya Hendrix, Associate Professor of Natural Sciences at LaGuardia; and Dr. Xueling Wu [adarc.cuimc.columbia.edu], Principal Investigator at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.\nThe Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation [goldwaterscholarship.gov] was established by Congress in 1986 to serve as a living memorial to honor the lifetime work of Senator Barry Goldwater, who served his country for 56 years as a soldier and statesman, including 30 years in the U.S. Senate. The Goldwater Scholarship program is designed to foster and encourage outstanding students to pursue research careers in the fields of the natural sciences, engineering, and mathematics. Winners have become leading scientists, engineers, and mathematicians in their respective fields. Previous Goldwater Scholars have won an impressive array of prestigious awards, becoming National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellows, NSF Graduate Research Fellows, Hertz Fellows, DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellows, Astronaut Scholars, Churchill Scholars, Marshall Scholars, and Rhodes Scholars.\nAmena and Allen are the second and third LaGuardia students to become Goldwater Scholars. In 2021, Veronica Martínez Castro became the first LaGuardia student to win a Goldwater Scholarship. Ms. Castro [linkedin.com] graduated from LaGuardia in 2021 with her associate degree in Environmental Science before transferring to Columbia University where she earned a bachelor’s degree in Environmental Biology.\n—With contributions by Annette Hanze Alberts\nThis column was originated by John A.
