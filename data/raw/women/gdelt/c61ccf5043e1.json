The club has a team in both the men's and women's competitions, but they have no real home base.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nTheir headquarters is at Speers Point near the Northern NSW Football Federation Headquarters. The men play most home games at McDonald Jones Stadium, which is the home ground of the Newcastle Knights in the NRL. The surface there has not always been ideal.\nThe women are nomadic in that they play games at Newcastle's No 2 Sportsground, McDonald Jones Stadium, Maitland and Cessnock. Then there is the question of a training facility.\nMy suggestion is that Macquarie Field at Speers Point be redeveloped as a 10,000 -12,000 spectator stadium with a top quality soccer pitch (including drainage etc). Some additional parking could be provided at the northern end. Other parking is available nearby at the pool. A shuttle bus could also run from Cockle Creek station and regular bus services do pass quite close by. That would leave McDonald Jones Stadium for NRL in winter and concerts and events at other times.\nThe ground at Speers Point, once developed, could be home to both the men's and women's A League teams and Lake Macquarie Club in the local league during the winter. It would also be an ideal ground for finals football (soccer). Being next to the Northern NSW Facility, it would also consolidate this area as the northern home of soccer.\nAll it needs is the concerted efforts and support of governments, the Jets, Lake Macquarie FC and the Northern NSW Federation. I am, by the way, a member of both the Jets and the Knights.\nJohn Pritchard, Blackalls Park\nNuclear won't help on emissions\nREGARDING the recent editorial (\"Climate change is driving US fire crisis\", Opinion, 13/1): will the Los Angeles wildfires also \"help put emissions back on the agenda\" in Australia? After looking more closely at the LNP nuclear-centred electricity plan to move toward net zero emissions by 2050 it appears to rely heavily on keeping our fleet of ageing coal fired power stations running well past their original closure dates.\nThis extension is necessary as nuclear power stations are highly unlikely to come online, delivering power into the grid, before 2040. I believe this will inevitably result in higher energy bills, an unreliable electricity supply and increasing emissions as renewable energy projects stall under Peter Dutton's nuclear plan.\nBorrowing from John Howard's 2004 campaign slogan, \"Who do you trust to keep interest rates low?\", one might change it to ask who you trust to keep emissions lower. I understand that most readers would already know the answer to this rhetorical question.\nIan Thomas, The Hill\nCost crisis or a campaign tactic?\nIN reply to Dave McTaggart (\"Balance bias for full picture, Letters, 15/1), I didn't say Sky was biased. I asked if it was, and I did not say the ABC was not biased. But given the changes made to ABC management and journalists during the tenure of the previous government, I'm a little concerned that there is a leaning to right by some sections.\nAs far as my comment in an earlier edition, I don't believe there is a cost of living crisis. The record spending at Black Friday sales, Christmas shopping, Boxing Day sales coupled with record crowds at the Test cricket and now the Australian Open tennis, there are plenty of people with plenty of money to spend on non-essentials. That doesn't indicate a cost of living crisis to me.\nFrom memory I wrote that yes, some people were doing it tough. There are always people doing it tough for various reasons. I think I also acknowledged that prices on most things were increasing, but they always do. It's very rare there price decreases, even under a conservative government.\nIf I consider the question asked by the opposition leader and shadow treasurer - are you better off since Labor came to office? - my answer is yes. I had checked my bank and what I had spent since May 2022, and yes I am better off. That is, I have more resources now than I did then.\nI don't speak for others but I am convinced there is no cost of living crisis, and I restate that it is an election campaign tactic by the conservatives and the hard right media trying to convince the punters they are worse off.\nFred McInerney, Karuah\n'Back on track' is just backwards\n\"GET Australia back on track\" is the LNP election campaign slogan.\nThe operative word in my opinion is \"back\", because I think that is where we're going in this country if the LNP gets back in.\nThat's back to the anti-union dark ages; back to dismantling industrial relations legislation; back to the gig economy where workers are undervalued and underpaid; back to coal, oil and gas (and then forward - nuclear power plants); back to no increase in wages for the workers. Back to the minimum wage being stagnant.\nCan we trust them on collective bargaining? Can we trust them on free TAFE? Can we trust them, full stop? Four changes of leaders in 10 years, no stability there. No, Mr Dutton, not \"back\". This scares the hell out of me!\nLynda Forbes, Rankin Park\nElection mode is starting to hit high gear\nAlbo must be doing head spins. He was at Tomago Aluminium gifting a large sum of money to help reduce energy costs, which is good news ('Albanese's $2b boost for green aluminium', Newcastle Herald, 20/1) and then turns around and says he supports the coal industry, which is also good for us. It prompted me to wonder what he is up to for a moment, but oh that's right: he smelled an upcoming election so he is probably buying votes. What's next, he will be voting Liberal or supporting nuclear energy?\nGreg Lowe, New Lambton\nMake us the gateway to region\nHELLO Sharon, Pat, Meryl and Dan. Your boss Anthony has just splurged $1 billion for roadworks to make the new Western Sydney airport the gateway to the world. How about even 50 per cent of the amount to make Newcastle the gateway to the Hunter Valley? Our population definitely deserves greater equality when the big dollars are being dished out. Newcastle and Port Stephens councils will need this support if our airport is to become an international player.\nRichard Devon, Fishing Point\nThank you for cartoon\nTHANK you for having the editorial courage to publish Pope's View cartoon on Friday (Opinion 17/1) depicting Dutton and his culture war sunscreen. It is a very funny cartoon but its message is also very sad for all Australians. After reading the cartoon, I turned my back on the image of Dutton in disgust.\nRhonda Budden, Floraville\nColumnist's view a divisive one\nSURELY the Newcastle Herald can obtain articles from commentators with a more balanced and realistic view of our political leaders. Jenna Price contribution (\"Haters, healers (no inbetweeners)\", Opinion, 18/1), labels anyone right of extreme left as a hater and anyone left of right as a \"healer\". It is always helpful to readers when commentators cast a critical eye over what politicians say and actually do in the national interest rather than demonstrate their own biases and political leanings.",
