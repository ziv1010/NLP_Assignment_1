  "body_text": "Sam Kerr’s brace provided holders Chelsea with safe passage to the fifth round proper of the Adobe Women’s FA Cup as they won 5-0 against Crystal Palace at Kingsmeadow.\nKerr, who scored the winner in both the 2022 and 2023 finals of the competition, showed her clinical edge in front of goal once more, bagging Chelsea’s second and fourth.\nAnd both Barclays Women’s Super League sides proved too strong for their WSL 2 opponents as Wassa Sangaré proved the difference for London City Lionesses in a 1-0 victory away at Sunderland.\nIt marked Eder Maestre’s first win as head coach of the London outfit, having replaced Jocelyn Prêcheur over the winter break.\nBut the victory did not come easy at Eppleton Colliery Football Ground as Sunderland, who sit eighth in WSL 2, made London City work for a spot in the fifth round.\nThe hosts had the best chance of the first half as Rhiannon Roberts saw her effort deflected over the bar, as the visitors struggled to convert their possessional dominance into chances.\nBut it did not take long to make one of their many corners count after the break as Grace Geyoro’s corner was headed home brilliantly by Sangaré on 50 minutes.\nDaniëlle van de Donk came on to make her debut with 20 minutes to go and Maestre will hope the victory can spark a revival in form.\nWassa Sangaré’s header puts @LC_Lionesses ahead 🚀\n📺 Watch live on @footballontnt and @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/Srl2v0SsgB\n— Adobe Women's FA Cup (@AdobeWFACup) January 17, 2026\nIn the second of Saturday’s matches, Chelsea showed no such hesitation in front of goal as Millie Bright got the hosts off to a flying start after just 13 minutes.\nThe defender latched onto Erin Cuthbert’s inch-perfect cross to turn home before the Scottish midfielder added a second assist ten minutes later.\nThis time it was a brilliant through-ball to send Kerr through to add Chelsea’s second.\nGuro Reiten then made it three before the break, as she converted from the spot having been fouled in the box.\nAnd the Blues did not let up after the break as Reiten turned provider to deliver a cross for Kerr to turn home before Alyssa Thompson completed the scoring on 70 minutes.",
