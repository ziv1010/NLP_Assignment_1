Here are seven standout marketing moments that showcase how Reynolds, McElhenney, and their team have built one of football’s most remarkable brand stories.\nThe cornerstone of Wrexham’s global marketing strategy has been the critically acclaimed Welcome to Wrexham documentary series on FX/Disney+. Unlike typical sports documentaries, this series brilliantly balances the ownership journey with heartfelt stories of players, fans, and the town itself.\nThe documentary wasn’t just compelling television – it was a marketing masterstroke that generated approximately $3.2m in revenue for the club while introducing Wrexham to millions of potential fans worldwide. The series turned the club’s underdog story into must-watch entertainment, with its blend of humor, emotion and authentic storytelling.\nSeason 4 is set to premiere on May 15, 2025, perfectly timed to capitalize on the club’s historic third consecutive promotion. What began as a documentation of an ambitious dream has now become a chronicle of football history in the making.\nAdvertisement\nIn August 2021, residents of Wrexham woke to find a giant Hollywood-style sign erected on the Rhostyllen coal slag heap overlooking the town. The mysterious installation immediately sparked speculation and media coverage across the UK.\nWhile initially denied by Reynolds, McElhenney and the club, it was later revealed to be a marketing stunt by Vanarama, the National League’s title sponsor. The company explained they wanted to “breathe new life into the upcoming season and celebrate having fans back on the terraces” while shining “the bright lights of Hollywood on the lower echelons of the fifth tier of English football.”\nThe brilliantly executed guerrilla marketing campaign generated massive social media buzz and press coverage, perfectly playing into the Hollywood ownership narrative while creating a memorable visual symbol that reinforced Wrexham’s newfound global ambitions.\nIn June 2021, Wrexham announced TikTok as their new front-of-shirt sponsor in a “first-of-its-kind” partnership that saw the social media giant’s logo emblazoned across the team’s kits. The deal coincided with the launch of Wrexham’s official TikTok channel, with both Reynolds and McElhenney making their personal TikTok debuts to announce the partnership.\nNick Tran, then global head of marketing at TikTok, explained the perfect synergy: “TikTok is uniquely positioned at the center of entertainment, technology and the creator community to help bring Wrexham AFC’s story to life to global audiences.”\nThe partnership propelled Wrexham’s social media presence to extraordinary heights. By April 2023, TikTok had become the club’s most followed platform, accounting for 43.4% of their total followers. The club’s social media growth has been phenomenal, with engagement rates exceeding those of most Premier League clubs. In just one week following their 2023 promotion, Wrexham gained over 538,000 new followers across platforms.\nIn a brilliantly executed social media campaign in 2023, Reynolds and McElhenney teased fans with cryptic posts suggesting they were changing the club’s name to “Wrexham United” – an announcement that caused immediate uproar among traditionalists.\nThe stunt was quickly revealed as the creative introduction of United Airlines as the club’s new front-of-shirt sponsor, replacing TikTok. The initial teaser tweet alone generated 20m views on Reynolds’s personal feed, while the reveal video notched up more than 5.7m views just 48 hours after posting.\nReynolds and McElhenney explained the partnership: “We seek out sponsors that match the spirit of both Wrexham Association Football Club and the people of Wrexham. We could think of no better sponsor for the next phase of our quest than United Airlines. The team, town and fans around the world are united as never before.”\nThe campaign demonstrated the owners’ savvy understanding of how to leverage their personal platforms for maximum impact, with the initial controversy driving even greater engagement with the eventual sponsorship announcement.\nWrexham made their Super Bowl advertising debut in February 2024 with a brilliant campaign for stadium sponsor Stok Cold Brew Coffee featuring Oscar-winning actor Sir Anthony Hopkins. In the commercial, created by Reynolds’s Maximum Effort production company, Hopkins transformed into Wrexham’s mascot, Wrex the Dragon.\nThe ad opened with Hopkins delivering a serious, theatrical monologue: “To act is to deceive. But to become this beast, well, that requires a little extra kick.” He then dons the dragon mascot head and runs around energizing fans, declaring: “This is what they came to see!”\nThe campaign brilliantly leveraged the Super Bowl’s massive audience of approximately 140 million viewers to boost Wrexham’s profile in the American market. For a club that was in the fifth tier of English football just a few years earlier, securing Super Bowl ad space (where 30-second spots cost around $8m) represented an extraordinary marketing achievement.\nAdvertisement\nBuilding on their Super Bowl success, Wrexham returned to the big game in February 2025 with another Stok Cold Brew Coffee ad, this time featuring Hollywood star Channing Tatum teaching Wrexham players how to improve their goal celebrations with Magic Mike-inspired dance moves.\nThe commercial showed Tatum entering the Wrexham locker room to train players including Ollie Palmer, Paul Mullin and Jacob Mendy in dance routines. In a humorous twist, Tatum eventually panics: “No, I promised Ryan and Rob I would keep it classy. Everyone, put your clothes back on!”\nThe ad, which again premiered during America’s most-watched sporting event, featured Reynolds in a brief but memorable cameo. Reynolds and McElhenney quipped in a statement: “We’re so happy that three of the stars of Deadpool & Wolverine were able to work together again to bring this ad to life for our incredible Wrexham sponsor.”\nThis marked the second consecutive year Wrexham secured precious Super Bowl advertising space, cementing their status as major players in the American sports marketing landscape.\nReynolds leveraged his ownership stake in Aviation Gin to create another innovative partnership for Wrexham. In July 2021, the club announced that Aviation Gin would be the sleeve sponsor on the training wear of both men’s and women’s senior teams.\nThe partnership included the release of limited-edition Aviation Gin bottles featuring Wrexham AFC team colors and crests. The campaign brilliantly cross-promoted Reynolds’s business interests while providing Wrexham with additional revenue and global exposure.\nWhat makes this partnership particularly noteworthy is how it exemplifies the integrated approach Reynolds and McElhenney have taken to Wrexham’s sponsorships – creating a network of brand partnerships that amplify each other while maintaining authentic connections to the club’s identity and values.\nAdvertisement\nWrexham AFC’s marketing success demonstrates the extraordinary potential when creative vision meets authentic community values. Reynolds and McElhenney haven’t just applied Hollywood marketing tactics to a football club – they’ve reimagined what sports marketing can be by telling compelling stories that resonate globally while staying true to local roots.\nThe results speak for themselves: three consecutive promotions, unprecedented social media growth, lucrative commercial partnerships and a global fanbase that stretches far beyond North Wales. As Wrexham prepares for life in the Championship, just one promotion away from the Premier League, their marketing journey proves that with the right narrative and creative execution, even the most unlikely sporting dream can capture the world’s imagination.",
