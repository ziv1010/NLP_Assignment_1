Today we go through the players ranked from No. 44 to No. 21. The players in the top 20 will follow on Friday.\nThe competitions we included were: the Andrew Johns Cup (under-16s boys), the Laurie Daley Cup (under-18s boys) and the Lisa Fiaola Cup (under-17s girls).\n44 - Campbell Lloyd\nTeam: Monaro Colts Competition: Andrew Johns Cup Position: Hooker\nAt a year younger than his peers, Lloyd has been playing for the Raiders in Harold Matthews Cup at hooker.\nIt's hard to find a position in rugby league that requires as much skill, endurance and toughness as the No.9, so for Lloyd to be playing that role at just 16 highlights his incredible ability at a young age. To be in this position Lloyd has impressed coaches with his willingness to learn and perfect his craft as a rake, with some versatility to also play in the halves.\n43 - Terowie Goldings-Lyons\nTeam: Macarthur Wests Tigers Competition: Andrew Johns Cup Position: Five-eighth\nGoulding-Lyons was named in the Western Suburbs Magpies' Harold Matthews Cup side but missed out on a spot in the final squad. If he was left dejected by that, you wouldn't have known as he instead came out in round one of this year's Andrew Johns Cup and scored a double in the round one win over Riverina. Much more than just a try-scorer Goulding-Lyons has been a standout at five-eighth for a Macarthur side which won three of its first four matches.\nIf his quality on the field wasn't enough, he's also making an impact off the field through his work with the Souths Cares organisation.\n42 - Jace Lucas\nTeam: Riverina Bulls Competition: Laurie Daley Cup Position: Hooker\nBeing smaller than most of their rivals didn't help Riverina's campaign this season but Jace Lucas is one who never lets it get in his way.\nThe crafty hooker isn't afraid to put his body on the line for him team whether it be the Bulls or for junior club Wagga Kangaroos. Coach Mark Yates is confident there is plenty more to come.\n\"He's only a small fella but he plays well above his weight,\" Yates said. \"His growth this year has been ten fold. He's always asking questions and is willing to learn and get better. He's a coach's dream really.\n\"When he matures he could be anything, but he just needs to grow into his body.\"\n41 - Tameika Clarke\nTeam: Western Rams Competition: Lisa Fiaola Cup Position: Hooker\nIf you need an indication of Clarke's talents, her performances in last year's Western Women's Rugby League tackle competition is all you need to look at. Clarke was the star of the show for the Panorama Platypi, scoring 12 tries in six games during a run to the semi-finals.\nOn top of that, she backed up for the under-18s each week and quickly became the standout there. Clarke finished the top try-scorer across the entire competition as the Platypi made the grand final. She's taken her talents to the Lisa Fiaola Cup again this year and has been a huge part of the side's success.\nPlaying at hooker, Clarke is a key director for the side but one of her biggest weapons is her running game, particularly close to the tryline. She may have just the one try to her name in the competition, but she's been heavily involved in most of her side's best moments and remains one of the Western area's most promising talents.\n40 - Ty Ennis\nTeam: Newcastle Maitland Competition: Andrew Johns Cup Position: Halfback\nA Valentine junior who attends Hunter Sports High School and wears the No.7 jersey in the Knights junior system. Only recently Ennis, a consistent member of this team's spine, kicked a game-winning field goal with less than one minute remaining on the clock.\n\"He controls the game really well, good kicking game, physical in defence, composure under pressure and just his general skills,\" Knights pathways manager Simon Healey said.\n39 - Troy Codey\nTeam: Monaro Colts Competition: Laurie Daley Cup Position: Halfback\nThe Queanbeyan Blues and Erindale College product is set to play for the Raiders in the SG Ball Cup this year having come through the Harold Matthews Cup squad last year. In high school he helped his team to the preliminary final at the Peter Mulholland Cup, which drew attention from rugby league scouts beyond the Canberra region.\nAs captain for the Colts this year he showcased his attacking prowess as a halfback with a brilliant kicking game, and is on track for a promising future in rugby league. \"He's got excellent organisation skills on the field and he has a very good pass on him too. He's just a very skillful half,\" Colts coach Brendan Bradley\n38 - Jack Colley\nTeam: Western Rams Competition: Laurie Daley Cup Position: Centre\nHe certainly wouldn't have been on this last a few months ago, such has been his meteoric rise with the Rams. A Mudgee junior who boards at St Stanislaus College in Bathurst, Colley has been more commonly seen around school rugby circles. But he was eager to test himself in the 13-man code and it didn't take long for him to be noticed at the Western trials.\nHe's since found a home in the centres and has been one of the few shining lights for the Rams with his strong running and ability to keep the ball alive. \"He's been very good,\" Rams coach Shane Rodney said during the Andrew Johns Cup campaign. He's a big kid, he's strong, and he's hard to bring down.\"\n37 - Tyson Walker\nTeam: Macarthur Wests Tigers Competition: Laurie Daley Cup Position: Halfback\nWalker has been the man to stitch it all together for the Tigers' Laurie Daley Cup side. Named in the Western Suburbs Magpies' SG Ball squad for 2025, Walker has dropped back to the country championships and his side has been the better for it.\nHe's scored tries in three matches while his playmaking was best on show in the stunning round two comeback against Monaro. His kicking game was near-perfect while he also nailed a 40/20 to help Macarthur come storming back from a 22-6 half-time deficit and win 30-22.\n36 - Shelley Cox\nTeam: Western Rams Competition: Lisa Fiaola Cup Position: Centre\nThe 2025 Lisa Fiaola Cup could be rebranded the Shelley Cox welcome tour. Little was known about this teenage talent as recently as a few months ago. From Dunedoo, a town of 1000 people between Dubbo and Mudgee, Cox had never played the tackle format of the game before last year.\nAfter impressing with the Castlereagh Cougars in the Western Women's competition, Cox caught the eye of Western's Lisa Fiaola Cup coach Marty Lyden. In a sign of just how much Lyden was impressed by Cox, he named her vice-captain for the 2025 competition.\n\"To do what she's done in one year is pretty amazing,\" Lyden said before round one this year. \"She's naturally talented and fit. She's still learning the game but it's very exciting to see where she can go.\"\n35 - Toby Batten\nTeam: North Coast Bulldogs Competition: Laurie Daley Cup Position: Halfback\nHas been a constant thorn in the sides of opposition teams in 2025. Batten has scored four tries and kicked 18 conversions for a final point tally of 52 as well as racking up four try assists.\nIn addition to his kicking game, the playmaker possesses a strong fend off and knack for playing what's in front of him, as seen in North Coast's 36-24 epic against Central Coast Roosters in which he scored the first and then set up the winning tries.\n34 - Nate Stokes\nTeam: Monaro Colts Competition: Andrew Johns Cup Position: Centre\nThe Cooma product is strong, deceptively quick, and safe on an edge defensively. He can score some good tries too but it's his size that has coaches scouting him as a potential back-rower due to his size.\n\"Looking at his dad, who was a good front rower for the Cooma Stallions, he's got plenty of growing to do,\" Monaro coach Jack Bramley said. \"He's been one of our best week in and week out. He's a no-frills, get work done kind of guy. He beats the first tackle 90 per cent of the time. It's hard to have that at 16. In Cooma he's been used to being the best player in a one-team town and now he's got more talent around him he has been shining even more.\n\"He's been in the Raiders development squad and I have a strong feeling we will see him in some more green next year and going forward.\"\n33 - Ellazae Elers\nTeam: Newcastle Maitland Competition: Lisa Fiaola Cup Position: Hooker\nA talented sporting all-rounder who has played Australian Schoolgirls rugby sevens and touch footy. Handy netballer as well. Now a league convert, linked to South Newcastle and making an immediate impact since landing at the Knights for 2025.\n\"The first time they get to wear a Knights jersey properly is Lisa Fiaolo at 16 and in the whole pathways, 17 to 19, she's probably got the best passing game,\" NRLW coach Ben Jeffries said.\n32 - Diezel Watson\nTeam: Riverina Bulls Competition: Laurie Daley Cup Position: Halfback\nDiezel Watson has stepped up to be a real director of Riverina's charge this season with his sharp ball-playing skills and kicking game helping the side move around the park.\nAnother who was part of Group Nine's premiership success with Wagga Kangaroos in the under-16s last year, coach Mark Yates expects only bigger to come as Watson continues to develop. \"He's got untapped ability and when he realises how much talent he's got the world is his oyster really,\" Yates said.\n\"He's got that much ability, that much talent and when he grows into his body properly and starts playing with older people he will just get better but his knowledge of the game of football is unbelievable.\"\n31 - Archie Wheeler\nTeam: Illawarra-South Coast Competition: Laurie Daley Cup Position: Centre\nArchie Wheeler has proven himself to head coach Adam Sargent-Wilson as an exceptional young talent. At just 17, he boasts a commanding presence at centre and combines toughness in defence with agility, poise, and speed in attack.\nWheeler's ability to offload under pressure makes him a constant threat, keeping the opposition on edge. \"Archie leads by example as team captain, setting high standards with his work ethic, commitment, and determination,\" Sargent-Wilson said.\n\"His leadership extends beyond just performance. \"Uncompromising in defence and dynamic with the ball, Archie is a player who consistently makes an impact and elevates those around him.\"\n30 - Logan Coombes\nTeam: Western Rams Competition: Andrew Johns Cup Position: Centre\nMoving to another new position did nothing to slow down Coombes in 2025. Last year, he was shifted from his regular position of lock to the second-row and was still one of Western's best in the Andrew Johns Cup.\nStepping up to under-18s this year, Coombes was put in the centres and he's been a standout again. Coombes may not be the biggest body on the field, but the Bathurst Panthers junior makes up for it in tenacity.\nCoombes was one of five Western players across the under-16s and 18s to earn NSW Country honours last season. Three of the other four are already linked with NRL clubs. If Coombes continues on his current trajectory, don't rule him out from doing the same.\n29 - Mel Philpott\nTeam: Riverina Bulls Competition: Lisa Fiaola Cup Position: Five-eighth\nPhilpott hasn't let taking on some bigger rivals stop her from making her presence felt in the Lisa Fioala Cup. While helping guide the team around the park, it's some of her defensive efforts that has been her really stand out.\nCoach Brittany Everett is impressed with how the Junee product keeps rising to the task at hand. \"In defence, no matter how big or fast they are she's there to tackle,\" Everett said. \"She's got good skills on her as well with her touch player background, but is incredible in both attack and defence for a small body.\"\n28 - Glassie Glassie\nTeam: Macarthur Wests Tigers Competition: Laurie Daley Cup Position: Centre\nThis boom centre is one to watch. Glassie Glassie has already represented the Cook Islands at a junior level while he also has aspirations of playing in the NRL.\nHe has made his presence felt this season, as was expected given he was named initially named in the Western Suburbs Magpies SG Ball squad for 2025. The centre scored in each of the Tigers' first four wins in the Laurie Daley Cup while his powerful running game regularly helped keep his side on the front foot.\n27 - Sam Duffy\nTeam: Illawarra-South Coast Competition: Andrew Johns Cup Position: Lock\nWearing the no.13 jersey for Steelers, Sam Duffy is a natural leader on and off the field who maintains standards set for the team and continually drives his peers to follow suit.\n\"Sam pushes himself to the limit every game and every training session,\" Morrison said. \"He is a nuggety, tough, and relentless player who has the ability to keep going when everyone else has given up.\"\n26 - Jayda Cook\nTeam: Canberra Raiders Competition: Lisa Fiaola Cup Position: Centre\nA devastating ball-runner, Cook brought her hard-nosed outside-back play to Canberra after being recruited by the Raiders from Griffith. She was identified with huge potential in a regional trial that the club's NRLW side have been championing. Cook relocated to the capital to fully commit to her rugby league career and the move has proved to be a positive one with coaches impressed by her ability on the edge.\n\"One on one she's so powerful. We back her every time in that situation. She wins those battles and she's very coachable,\" coach Brian Summerell said.\n25 - Fletcher O'Doherty\nTeam: Newcastle Maitland Competition: Laurie Daley Cup Position: Lock\nKnights pathways manager Simon Healey describes him as a \"ball-playing 13\".\n\"Played a bit of back-row last year but moved into lock now. Really crafty and can play that extra halfback-type role, passing short or out the back,\" Healey said.\nO'Doherty, son of former Knights player Jarrod, has links with the South Newcastle club and attends high school at St Mary's, Gateshead. Has already got a taste of SG Ball in 2025.\n24 - Tahani Kafusi\nTeam: Illawarra-South Coast Competition: Lisa Fiaola Cup Position: Front row\nCoach Brad Reh says: \"Tahani had a great 2024 Lisa Fiaola Cup season, playing in the middle of the field in the front row. It's not an easy thing to do when you are younger. Grew as a player last year and had the opportunity to train with the Steelers women's premiership-winning team. That experience will be a real asset this season.\"\n23 - Josh Hazel\nTeam: Riverina Bulls Competition: Andrew Johns Cup Position: Front row\nTemora is no stranger to producing quality rugby league talent, two of their juniors were part of NSW's State Of Origin win last season in Liam Martin and Zac Lomax. Hazel is part of the new generation of Dragons leading the charge in the Andrew Johns Cup.\nHis work through the middle has been a real highlight. Riverina coach Jordon Burley has been impressed with how he developed before his campaign was cut short by injury.\n\"Josh is a kid who started out as a quiet kid but has had an unbelievable three games before he hurt himself,\" Burley said. \"He just does his job and does it well.\"\n22 - Jack Milne\nTeam: Monaro Colts Competition: Laurie Daley Cup Position: Lock\nThe Monaro Colts youngster is a rare duel threat as a forward and goal-kicker, highlighting his versatility. His skills as a strong runner and defender at lock are amplified by his background as a five-eighth growing up in Parkes. In round four of the Laurie Daley Cup, Milne scored three tries for Monaro, and kicked a whopping nine of ten conversions. Like Cahill, Milne played for the Raiders in Harold Matthews Cup last year and is one to watch in the Green Machine pathways.\n\"He's on a nice trajectory. He's not as big as the others but he's been really consistent,\" Colts coach Brendan Bradley said.\n21 - Ella Greatz\nTeam: Illawarra-South Coast Competition: Lisa Fiaola Cup Position: Halfback\nCoach Brad Reh Says: Second year in Lisa Fiaola. Starting halfback last year, Greatz is a smart footballer with plenty of speed, understands the game well, and is seen as a leader by her peers. After a strong representative season with the Steelers, Greatz represented NSWCHS and was awarded the 2024 under-16s schoolgirls' player of the tournament. She was also a member of the NSW Emerging Blues camp.",
