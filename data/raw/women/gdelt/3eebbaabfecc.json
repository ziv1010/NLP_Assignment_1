Looks like it's lights out for Wales in the women's Euros, already losing 2 - 0 to England.\n17 Posted 13/07/2025 at 20:31:04\nBeen a lot tighter game than anticipated.\n18 Posted 13/07/2025 at 20:38:13\n19 Posted 13/07/2025 at 20:38:17\n20 Posted 13/07/2025 at 20:38:30\n21 Posted 13/07/2025 at 20:41:09\n22 Posted 13/07/2025 at 20:41:11\n23 Posted 13/07/2025 at 20:44:19\n24 Posted 13/07/2025 at 20:52:12\nCole Palmer superb\n25 Posted 13/07/2025 at 20:53:59\n26 Posted 13/07/2025 at 20:54:27\n27 Posted 13/07/2025 at 21:00:30\n28 Posted 13/07/2025 at 21:08:15\n29 Posted 13/07/2025 at 21:10:47\n30 Posted 13/07/2025 at 21:11:53\n31 Posted 13/07/2025 at 21:14:03\n32 Posted 13/07/2025 at 21:14:50\nIf I go the game and this happens I'm going home\n33 Posted 13/07/2025 at 21:15:08\n34 Posted 13/07/2025 at 21:19:18\n35 Posted 13/07/2025 at 21:22:38\n36 Posted 13/07/2025 at 21:23:13\n37 Posted 13/07/2025 at 21:25:58\nOkay, there was six minutes added on time in the first half, so this second half should have kicked off around 21:15 pm, not 21:25 pm. Plus don't forget the game kicked off 8 minutes past the scheduled time. Bloody joke!!\n39 Posted 13/07/2025 at 21:28:29\n40 Posted 13/07/2025 at 22:14:32\n41 Posted 13/07/2025 at 22:17:25\n42 Posted 13/07/2025 at 22:43:47\n43 Posted 13/07/2025 at 22:45:21\nThey did stuff PSG.\nWill wind the Shite up this surely.🤣\n44 Posted 13/07/2025 at 22:48:22\nDonald must have been woken up. There was a clip of him earlier and he definitely looked asleep!!\nIt's funny, my cousin, the Chelsea fan, was spent most of last season complaining. Didn't like the owners (quite widespread actually. Told me they had no chance of Champions League. Cole Palmer was shit and they wouldn't win the Europa Conference League.\nChampions League qualification and two trophies later, his mood is very different.\nFootball supporters, eh?!!\n45 Posted 13/07/2025 at 23:37:50\nI think Maresca was being heavily questioned too at times wasn't he.\nOn top of the World now!\n46 Posted 13/07/2025 at 23:46:47\n47 Posted 14/07/2025 at 00:32:50\nIn conversation with a colleague yesterday, I said Chelsea would fare better than Madrid had.\nWhy? Well, I just didn't think much of the Real defence from that viewing. Rudiger was never wholly reliable and I'm amazed at how the over-hyped Huijsen has apparently been given a starting role (at least in some of the games I'd noticed).\nPeople often scoff at the quality in the Premier League but I think there is plenty; at least enough that any of those clubs that regularly qualify for Europe have a chance against any of the world's elite teams if they happen to get it all together for the 90 minutes required.\nCole Palmer may have had a ‘difficult' season but he didn't suddenly become ‘shit'.\nStill expect a ‘roller-coaster' season from Chelsea though.\n48 Posted 14/07/2025 at 01:06:57\nAs Rob says above, I'll be giving next summers World Cup a miss because it going to be Americanised to death. Expect adverts at watering time half-way through each half, which will lead to the game becoming 4 quarters of 22½ minutes or more likely 4 periods of 20 minutes in the long run.\nThe players need to strike, because they are being used now, as show ponies to promote the Billionaires and their all embracing corporations / and products. Fuck 'em all, Fuck 'em all to Kingdamn Come.\n49 Posted 14/07/2025 at 03:57:02\nAmazing really.\n50 Posted 14/07/2025 at 04:08:15\n51 Posted 14/07/2025 at 06:23:51\nNot 'going', mate… Gone! — like football and the world in general.\n52 Posted 14/07/2025 at 06:43:15\nHow so, Bill?\nWhat is actually “absolute shit” about the UK?\n53 Posted 14/07/2025 at 06:57:10\n54 Posted 14/07/2025 at 06:57:56\nAnyway, Club World Cup and Women's Euros all done.\nLater we should see the pre-match preview for tomorrow night's pre-season against Accrington Stanley, so back to Everton.\n55 Posted 14/07/2025 at 07:48:22\nI did. And the only thing uniquely Americanized about that World Cup was that they played some games in college football venues, which fortunately won't happen this time.\nIt was a joyous, international and wildly successful tournament, breaking every attendance record at the time. I traveled to every game on a train full of dancing Brazilians, and they thought it was the best World Cup ever held.\nIf this one sucks, it'll be because of too many midday games at 90°F. And the USA isn't doing the scheduling. You wanna miss it? Be my guest.\nAnybody else coming over to see it? Literally, be my guest. I have a couple of guest bedrooms and a view of the Seattle World Cup venue across Puget Sound.\n56 Posted 14/07/2025 at 08:05:29\nThe football was slow and turgid. The most exciting bit was the Mexican wave. The bikini clad “fan” became a permanent fixture for the cameras. Diana Ross missing a pen was a prelude of things to come. And the final was even duller than the previous (Argentina-Germany) one. Also, England wasn't present.\nOverall, it was shite imo.\n57 Posted 14/07/2025 at 08:10:38\nNot so bad it seems.\n58 Posted 14/07/2025 at 08:29:14\nI'm 66, semi-retired on a part-time wage and my state pension. My wife is a teaching assistant on a low salary. We have 3 grown-up sons who all went to a local school in a “rough” catchment area. Two of them went through Uni and are happy, the 3rd is an accomplished chef living the life on a super yacht in the Med. My wife has a blood condition similar to Leukaemia and has regular treatment with the NHS. Her drugs cost thousands of pounds but she gets them on the NHS.\nWe live in a mid-terrace 3 bed house in West Sussex, where the cost of living is quite expensive. I drive an old Volvo and love it. We are happy and both of us have active social lives – I still play cricket and football weekly. If I need a doctor I get one easy and I have regular dental treatments on the NHS. I just paid £300 for partial dentures (they're going in the bin though).\nThe only part of living in the UK that I find shit is the aftermath of Brexit. I work in travel and my 4-year-old passport is already almost full of stamps. The queues at passport control, always accompanied by people whinging that “they are punishing us for Brexit”, are a pain in the arse, especially when you see the EC passports just strolling through.\nI'm not a little Englander at all but I find living in the UK quite pleasant actually, certainly not shit.\n59 Posted 14/07/2025 at 08:53:08\nI also like living in the UK and I don't think it's anywhere near as bad as the late 70s / early 80s. \"The sick man of Europe\" as we were labelled.\nI haven't found Brexit too bad. The queues have been no different, as at places like Dusseldorf and Munich (maybe more). Perhaps it depends on the country and airport you fly into. Bucharest is a nightmare, chaotic regardless. And passport control officers who look like a throwback to Soviet Eastern Europe!!\nThere did seem a bit of resentment. We never stopped allowing citizens from EU countries to pass through the same e-gates as UK citizens, whereas they did. That seems to be resolved from October when we can use them again.\n60 Posted 14/07/2025 at 08:58:57\nThe World Cups in the USA, South Africa, Qatar and Russia weren't great. To be fair, I enjoyed the World Cup in South Korea & Japan, so perhaps there is hope for next year.\nMy favourite top five World Cups (I'm 63 and therefore too young to remember 1966):\n1. Spain 1982\n2. Mexico 1970 (Even though aged 8 and a long time ago, I can remember this vividly and have watched it many times since.)\n3. Mexico 1986\n4. Brazil 2014\n5. Argentina 1978\nI didn't watch any of the Club World Cup barring PSG thump Real Madrid in the semi-final, and the final last night. I'm hoping the cringeworthy half-time antics or entertainment yesterday don't foreshadow the fayre on offer at the World Cup in 2026 and, more importantly, what goes down at Bramley-Moore Dock at half-time.\n61 Posted 14/07/2025 at 09:22:48\nBut our country has been in decline for a long time, big subject, many sub categories, too big for here.\nI am 69, wife isn't getting pension yet, live in a flat in north Wales, have a couple of health conditions, paid £260 for a crown tooth last month, waited 8 years for a throat op which I have travelled to Manchester for, lying here now in Royal Infirmary glad it's done but we definitely are a country in decline.\nEverton is good therapy for me, and I like a positive outlook.\nBritain's not totally fucked, but it will never get back what it's lost.\n62 Posted 14/07/2025 at 09:55:00\nThe game is now being monetised by global players, and a game which continues for nearly an hour with no break is no good for sponsors.\nBut if we can get VAR to interrupt every 10 minutes, and to take 5 minutes making a decision, then that becomes a very handy slot for Paddy Power to chip in with some inane nonsense.\nAnd they will pay handsomely for the privilege. They are interfering via VAR with the DNA of the game; in 10 years time, it'll probably be 3 hours to get the game done, there'll be interactive stuff going on all the time, and the ordinary local fan will have a very small voice indeed.\nThe galling thing is they don't tell you what the plan is, they just inch you along… and introduce stuff, little bits at a time.\nIf you had told the fans 30 years ago that nobody can celebrate goals properly anymore cos of VAR, they would have laughed and said nobody would put up with that. But here we are.\n63 Posted 14/07/2025 at 10:11:05\nI'm sure that FIFA's already swelling coffers have done well out of this competition. Similar for UEFA and the Champions League. First qualifying matches tomorrow by the way. God there are some unheard of obscure clubs taking part. I think I only recognise Malmo.\nI'm still unclear what the selection criteria was for participating clubs in the Club World Cup. I presume by invite? Surely, due to the global reach they command, Liverpool and Man Utd would have been ahead of Chelsea and even Man City? Maybe they did get invited and turned it down.\n64 Posted 14/07/2025 at 10:18:51\nIt's disconcerting seeing these politicians stuck in the middle of a footy celebration, it doesn't augur well for where footy is heading.\nI'm stone-cold certain though that football is used now as a forum for the gobshites in charge to communicate all kinds of messages.\n65 Posted 14/07/2025 at 10:20:35\nThe whole VAR thing has metamorphosised from being 'about getting decisions right' into being about providing drama to those watching on TV.\nI've always gone to watch Everton in person and the impact on the matchday fan is huge. It's changed the fabric of the experience.\nThe effect on TV viewers is different. Within seconds, they are watching replays and commentators, lines being drawn, etc. They are 'entertained' as part of the process, and it doesn't feel the same as waiting unknowingly in a stadium for 3-4 minutes. I noticed the difference when watching TV games.\nAll this other nonsense, like interviewing players at half-time and players who have been substituted – why? What type of insight are you going to get from a player who doesn't even want to talk to you? Just concentrate on the football.\nAnother thing that wound me up watching the game last night was the camera constantly focusing on 'celebrities' in the crowd, whilst play was on-going. Watching patterns of play, movement on the pitch, tactical tweaks etc, is more difficult on TV anyway, but even harder when the directors don't even show the bloody game.\n66 Posted 14/07/2025 at 10:44:26\nNo substitute for a live game, breathing the same atmosphere in a stadium.\nNot everyone can get there easily, so the great economic machinery kicks in and takes \"the product\" to the consumer, for a fee of course.\nThe world is money driven, economy first, no stopping it now.\n67 Posted 14/07/2025 at 10:55:30\nI can only think of a few members of the UK establishment who warrant any credit attending football matches as a genuine thing rather than a popularise opportunity.\nThere are probably more, but a few I can think of:\nAndy Burnham (Everton).\nWhether a royalist or not, Prince William seems genuine following football and Villa.\nDespite and controversy, that follows him like flies seeking out dog shit for a tasty meal, our very own Degsy. I may criticise him for a lot, but I can't knock him for his genuine support of Everton.\nAnd right now, the hugely unpopular Sir Kier Starmer. He may be telling more porkies than Pinocchio and has scored a hat-trick of U-turns with another on the horizon, but he has been a long-time Arsenal season ticket holder. He can no longer use his seats due to being PM and security concerns, so takes corporate seats from Arsenal.\n68 Posted 14/07/2025 at 16:04:48\nTo me, the only bullshit will be if the PSG manager doesn't get some sort of ban, you can clearly see he aimed at and punched the Chelsea player.\nYou can see where he aims his punch, just under his own player's arm, while he was having a conflict with the Chelsea player.\n69 Posted 15/07/2025 at 18:28:06\nMark#58.\nYou have done well in life by living it.Well done.It is people like you that I admire.\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
