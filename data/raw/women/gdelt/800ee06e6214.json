  "body_text": "—Spread check: Notre Dame by 5.5.\nWednesday afternoon Cardinal news and notes\nEmma Blackburn is not the least bit concerned about Notre Dame.\n—Natalie Pierre is the only member of the Courier Journal sports staff picking Louisville to upset Notre Dame.\n—The U of L offense is expecting a “great challenge” from the Fighting Irish defense.\n—Notre Dame has been absolutely dominant against the ACC in 2017.\nIn the last seven Notre Dame vs. ACC games leading up to last weekend, the Irish won them all by at least 13 points. Five were by 21 or more.\nA lot of teams lose to Notre Dame in the regular season. When the streak began in 2018 until 2021, Notre Dame went 43-2 in the regular season. It went undefeated twice.\nBut since the start of last season – its first without Brian Kelly – Notre Dame is 13-5 in the regular season: 3-0 against its ACC ranked opponents, but 0-3 against other ranked Power 5 teams. And since the 30-win streak began, Notre Dame is 8-0 against the ACC’s ranked opponents and 4-7 against ranked opponents from other Power 5 conferences.\nOf Notre Dame’s last 24 regular-season wins, 11 have come against the ACC. From 2019-23, Notre Dame is 9-5 against ranked opponents in the regular season. But that’s 6-0 against the ACC’s ranked teams and 3-5 against all others. Oh, and those non-ACC ranked wins? Navy in 2019, Wisconsin in 2021 and BYU last year.\nNotre Dame has knocked off ranked ACC teams eight times in that stretch. It has handed nine ACC teams their first loss of the season, including doing so four times in the last five meetings with ACC foes. Notre Dame is 4-9 against ranked opponents since 2018 and 8-0 against ranked ACC opponents.\nHeck, Notre Dame even beats teams before they can even GET ranked. North Carolina was undefeated and unranked when Notre Dame knocked them off last year, thwarting a 3-0 start and excitement building around Drake Maye.\nIn 2021, Notre Dame beat an unranked Virginia team off to a 6-3 start by 25. Notre Dame was in the ACC in 2020, but it still gave No. 7 Clemson its first loss (Clemson would return the favor) and No. 18 North Carolina its third (the Tar Heels would not). In 2019, it gave 4-0 Virginia its first loss and edged a 5-2 Virginia Tech by 1. In 2018, Syracuse was No. 15 and 8-2 only to get smoked by 33 points by the Irish.\n—Irish Breakdown shares its thoughts on Louisville.\n—The NCAA is changing the transfer portal windows to 45 days per sport per year, down from 60.\n—The sixth-ranked Cardinal volleyball team will face North Carolina and Duke on the road this weekend.\n—1.89 million people watched Louisville topple NC State last Friday.\n—For the first time since the KFC Yum Center opened in 2010, a new U of L basketball court graced its floor Thursday.\n—The latest episode of the From the Pink Seats podcast is here.\n—Sebastian Moss of the Louisville men’s golf team shot a final round 67 to post his third-straight top 10 finish of the fall as the Cards finished play at the Fighting Irish Classic on Monday.\n—You know it’s a big game when ole Mark Rutherford starts poppin’ up on your TV.\n—It’s a historic weekend for football in the Bluegrass State.\n—The U of L men’s soccer team raced back from a second half deficit to pull off a last-second 3-2 win over Kansas City on Monday night.

NC State 13-10\nLast week’s ranking: 16\nBiggest statistical strength: Epic explosiveness. Against Georgia Tech and Boston College, they mixed three rushes of 30-plus yards with eight such passes. Indiana and NC State defended them well but still got hit for a couple of big ones. Louisville is inconsistent but capable of scoring from anywhere on the field on any play.\nBiggest statistical weakness: You make big plays against them too. Among unbeatens, only Florida State, USC and JMU have given up more gains of 30-plus. In marginal explosiveness, the Cards rank 10th on offense but 105th on defense. They give away a lot of the gains they create.\nNext big test: Week 6 vs. Notre Dame.\n—Louisville Report has the Cards at No. 5 in its latest ACC power rankings.\n—The Washington Post chose Louisville to center this depressing report on falling life expectancy in the U.S.\nIt’s Notre Dame week, guys.
