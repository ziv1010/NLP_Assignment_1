Previously, due to the burgeoning nature of the competition, players could only be signed for a single season.\nThe Dragons were the only club to jump out and announce a host of signings on Wednesday, including the recruitment of former Knights centre and Port Stephens product Bobbi Law.\nMore announcements are expected in coming days.\nFormer Knights Romy Teitzel and Emma Manzelmann, who both reside in North Queensland, are expected to join the Cowboys.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK?
