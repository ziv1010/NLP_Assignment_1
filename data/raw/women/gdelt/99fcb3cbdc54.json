But one of the key reasons Canterbury extended his deal to be their top Dog until the end of 2031 is for the hours and hours of work he does for players, their families and staff members that goes unnoticed or unrecognised.\nAn example was a dinner that he and chairman Adam Driussi had with Galvin’s parents a few weeks back. Galvin has been in the eye of a media and social media storm for months now, and while Lachlan may be able to deal with most of it because he has strong support from his teammates and coach, his parents are left to navigate the negativity on their own.\nGalvin joined the Bulldogs in May following an ugly split with Wests Tigers.\nGould organised a dinner at his favourite location, Canterbury League Club, where James and Tracy Galvin were treated to a Chinese meal. But more than that, the club, through their heaviest hitters, was checking in to see how they were coping with the relentless abuse that has been directed towards their son and, to some degree, the entire family.\nIt cannot be easy to deal with attacks from faceless cowards on social media on your child. There was particular concern and interest in how Tracy was dealing with it, as James seems to be more of an unflappable character – a quality he has passed on to his son.\nThe level of abuse probably won’t change following Toby Sexton’s return off the bench in Friday night’s qualifying final loss to the Storm. Sexton had been dropped to accommodate Galvin earlier in the season.\nI knew about the dinner with Gould at the time, but chose to let time pass before discussing it in public. Neither Gould nor Driussi wanted to elaborate on what was discussed, but the chairman was happy to explain how important Gould’s contribution away from the limelight is.\n“We couldn’t have achieved what we have without Gus,” Driussi said. “He’s been the architect of our entire rebuild and transformation.\n“There’s no one I’d rather have leading our football department. Phil’s track record and knowledge of the game speaks for itself.\n“What people don’t see is how much Gus cares about the individuals at our club. He’ll send a supportive text message to someone going through a tough time, or quietly help a player or staff member through a family crisis – all without seeking any recognition.\n“The hours Gus puts in behind the scenes are incredible. He’s constantly working on improving every aspect of our football department. Gus has transformed everything about our football operation since he arrived, not just our playing squad. He’s put the right people in place to transform our pathways, recruitment, coaching, strength and conditioning and medical.\n“Working with Gus has reinforced my belief that having the right people in key positions makes all the difference. Having both him and [coach] Cameron [Ciraldo] locked in until 2031 gives us the stability and continuity to build the club around.”\nTurbo shock raises more questions about Manly\nEven if Tom Trbojevic does not leave Manly, the fact he has been exploring options in England says it all when it comes to the level of player dissatisfaction at the Sea Eagles.\nThe excuse that everything was Daly Cherry-Evans’ fault is wearing thin. DCE is out the door, but the problems remain.\nTrbojevic is contracted to the Sea Eagles until the end of 2026, but is free to negotiate with other clubs from November 1.\nThere is a clear level of scepticism about the direction in which Manly are heading. If a player of Trbojevic’s standing at the club and in the community is looking elsewhere, the club’s management and owners need to start delving into where the problems are. The issue with that, however, is that they may be the problem.\nThe mirror can be a tough place to look at times.\nManly have been teetering on the brink of imploding for the past year or so with increasing dissatisfaction from players about the direction the club is heading. Missing the finals in 10th this season has done little to allay those fears.\nIt will be unfortunate if Trbojevic becomes the face of these problems, as he is the solution, not the issue.\nThere are rumblings at every level at Manly, starting from the board and going all the way through to the playing group. There needs to be change, and it must happen quickly.\nThe problem is those in power are not about to sack themselves. Instead, it will be those at the coal face, such as the star players, or even the coach, who end up in the spotlight.\nThe club’s failed attempt to secure Laurie Daley in a mentor role for Anthony Seibold says a lot about what is going wrong at the Sea Eagles. Daley would have been an excellent addition to the Manly set-up. His football knowledge and experience would be invaluable. But here’s where the questions start.\nWhy does a coach who has been at three clubs, made the finals, coached in international rugby union and is university educated need a mentor?\nThat’s not to be critical of Daley. It’s more of a question about the mentality at Manly.\nSeibold has been through enough as a head coach to know how to handle most situations. The issues he is having with the playing group are not ones that can be fixed by Daley or anyone else. They are issues he needs to sort out himself.\nIt doesn’t help that there are people leaking at the club when it comes to appointments as significant as a mentor for the coach. The premature trumpeting of Daley’s arrival and his subsequent decision to knock back the role makes the club look silly. Not Daley or Seibold, but the entire organisation, as they missed their mark. Again.\nThings have not been good at Manly for the past couple of years, but more significantly since the mishandling of Cherry-Evans’ departure. I have intimate knowledge of the failed contract negotiations, and despite denials from chief executive Tony Mestrov, I am extremely confident in reporting that there was no offer to Cherry-Evans until the dramatic on-air offer Mestrov made via Fox Sports after Channel Nine news revealed Cherry-Evans was departing the club.\nCancer fight drives Bears recruiter\nNew Perth recruitment boss Dane Campbell is the man who has to build a Bear from scratch.\nHe is the unknown official with one of the biggest jobs in rugby league in the next six months. But Campbell has already been through a bigger challenge after battling colorectal cancer.\n“I’ve had the all clear,” he said. “I have been through chemo the first six months of this year, and that was more so to hopefully eliminate it coming back, because we were able to have the surgeries whilst it was still very much in the smaller stages of things, thank goodness.”\nAnd when he was offered the job by Bears chief executive Anthony De Ceglie, his experience in fighting cancer played a role in his decision to leave a prominent recruiting job with the Broncos.\n“I think when opportunities present themselves, why live in fear of it ... go attack it,” Campbell said. “And I think that’s something that was very honest from the start about what I’ve been through.\n“Anthony had already done his homework, and he was understanding of what I’ve been through the last 12 months or so. It wasn’t a deterrent to them, therefore it wasn’t for me. And who knows what the future holds, whether it comes back in one year, five years, 10 years or never. But right now, I’m OK.”\nCampbell has to sit down with Bears coach Mal Meninga and general manager of football David Sharpe to work out the recruitment strategy. And he will call on his experience gained with the Storm and Cowboys.\n“I tend to think there’s a couple of ways [to approach it],” Campbell said. “One is the star model, where you attract all the big names and throw whatever it is at them in terms of whether it’s money or opportunity or whatever it may be. But the other one is probably the commitment-based model, which is probably more Storm background.\n“I guess we’ve got a couple of little blueprints in recent times ... what the Dolphins have done well, or what they missed the mark on. And then we’ve got sort of longitudinal history. How did the Storm put their group together early when they had so much success early in the piece, and how did they sustain that too, over a number of years?\n“They came from all different directions, and they’re able to keep that group together for a period of time and build a culture.\n“I think there’s ample talent within the game, and there’s guys at potentially really good clubs and strong clubs that maybe need an opportunity, too. So having a bit of foresight around, do we want to walk in on day one with a really gung-ho side, to go out and try and compete for a title from day one? Or are we going to try and, I guess, simultaneously look to how we be sustainable, and how do we build this over a three to five-year period.”\nGolden moments revisited\nIt will be interesting to see how big a role Cathy Freeman plays in a celebration on Monday to mark 25 years since the Sydney Olympics opening ceremony, and to mark the beginning of a new Accor Stadium hall of fame. Freeman produced the greatest moment in the stadium’s history when she won gold in the women’s 400m, but she shuns the limelight and most media opportunities these days.\nOther greats with a strong connection to the stadium will definitely be there, however. John Aloisi, who scored from a penalty in 2005 to send Australia to the football World Cup, is scheduled to attend. And there will also be a video contribution from English rugby great Jonny Wilkinson, who kicked the winning field goal to give England the 2003 World Cup. He could not attend.\nI’ve been told one of the inductees into the hall of fame has taken four flights to get to Sydney, and cut short a family holiday.\nGeorge Ellis will conduct a 25-piece orchestra at the same end of the ground as his performance at the Games opening ceremony.\nAlso, gold medal-winning Australian women’s water polo team members Joanne Clark, Yvette Higgins, Bronwyn Smith, Taryn Wickham and Deborah Watson will be in attendance. A select group of league and rugby union stars are also expected to be there.\nHuge day for Smallwoods\nThe Bilambil Jets are in three grand finals on Sunday in the Northern Rivers Regional Rugby League competition, and one family, the Smallwoods, are in for a day to remember regardless of the outcome.\nI’m sure there are other great family stories out there, but it’s difficult to beat having two parents and their son playing in three grand finals on the same day. Dad Phillip is playing reserve grade, mum Paris is in the women’s game and son Preston is in the under-18s decider.\n“I stopped and thought about it the other day, and we are pretty lucky and proud,” said Phillip, 39. “We did a jersey presentation the other night and thought this just doesn’t happen. His mum and I are both back-rowers now that we are getting older, and Preston is a fullback. He still has the speed. He has a three-year contract with the Raiders. He is in his last year with them, and we are both so excited for what is ahead.”\nNRL is Live and Free on Channel 9 & 9Now",
