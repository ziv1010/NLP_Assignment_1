  "body_text": "We recap a busy news day for the Michigan Wolverines, who had major developments in the Michigan football and Michigan basketball programs. Hockey too.\nIn terms of Michigan Wolverines news, you won’t see many days as busy as Friday. It started with Michigan football finally landing the commitment of five-star quarterback Jadyn Davis.\nMichigan football has been considered the leader for Davis since June, but recruiting is crazy and there was a lot of back and forth.\nThe recent visit that allowed Davis to spend an extended period with new Michigan football quarterbacks coach Kirk Campbell seemed to seal the deal. And for what it’s worth, Campbell is looking like one hell of a recruiter.\nAt any rate, Davis’s addition is massive for the Michigan Wolverines. He’s ranked 28th overall according to the 247 sports composite rankings for the 2024 recruiting class and fourth among quarterbacks.\nDavis is a pro-style quarterback and in the Wolverines system, I think he’s going to be a great fit, most importantly, Michigan football now has its QB1 of the future.\nHunter Dickinson transfers from Michigan basketball\nThere was some shocking news that probably wasn’t all that shocking as Michigan basketball star Hunter Dickinson has entered the transfer portal.\nDickinson has never been shy about his want for a big NIL deal and while he certainly seems to make good money at Michigan, the opening market had to be tantalizing.\nJuwan Howard praised Dickinson but called the move “disappointing” in his statement. Jace Howard also went a little farther with a post on Instagram.\nAt any rate, Michigan basketball will be undergoing a dramatic shift. As I wrote on Friday night, this doesn’t have to be the end of the world. Dickinson was a great scorer, but that’s about all he was.\nDickinson was a terrible defender and never blossomed into a leader. His antics were a distraction at times and his effort, frankly, especially on defense, was an issue.\nMichigan basketball lost 31 games over the past two seasons, so a change was needed. It’s going to be difficult but this program needed a reset and now Juwan Howard can get one.\nIt’s still disappointing, but in the long run, it might even be a good thing for the Michigan Wolverines, even if it causes some short-term pain.\nMichigan hockey hires Brandon Naurato as head coach\nIt should have happened much sooner but the Michigan Wolverines have removed the interim tag and named Brandon Naurato as the Michigan hockey head coach.\nThe Michigan Wolverines will take part in the Frozen Four this week and are two wins away from a national championship. They also won the Big Ten hockey title by knocking off Minnesota.\nThe promotion was well deserved and it’s safe to say that Michigan hockey is in a really good place moving forward, regardless of what happens in the Frozen Four.\nMore Michigan Wolverines news\n- The Michigan football spring game will be held Saturday afternoon at 3 PM EST. Here are six storylines to follow, as well as how to watch.\n- Michigan baseball improved to 4-0 in the Big Ten with a 12-9 win over Illinois Friday. Ted Burton, Mitch Voit, and Jonathan Kim all blasted home runs in the win for the Michigan Wolverines. Voit and Kim drove in four runs each while Tito Flores also had a double and two RBI. Kim added two doubles as well. Connor O’Halloran earned the win after surrendering two runs on three hits and striking out eight in six innings of work.\n- The Michigan Wolverines men’s gymnastics team won its third straight Big Ten championship on Friday. The third-ranked Wolverines posted a total of 412.400. The Women’s team also advanced to the regional finals.\n- Last but not least, the Michigan softball team beat Nebraska 10-1 in just five innings. Lauren Derkowski allowed just two runs and one hit in five innings to get the win. Keke Tholl led the way at the plate going 3-for-3 with a home run and four RBI.",
