  "body_text": "What a weekend it was for Missouri sports! In the 97th meeting of Missouri and Oklahoma on the gridiron Saturday, MU won in a wild game which saw five fumbles, two scoop-and-scores, and, per the St. Louis P-D, 28 points scored in the final 200 seconds.\nTobias Sixteen: Rivalry Renewed\nRMN’s photo editor shares some favorites from this incredible week of Mizzou sports.\nAlso, volleyball beat Georgia to stay one of the hottest teams in the SEC, men’s basketball won their season opener against Howard, and women’s hoops split two games against mid-majors. That’s way too much for just ten pictures. Here is the Tobias Sixteen!\n- Rivalry Returns\nMissouri and Oklahoma have played 97 times now, with the all-time tally now OU 67-25 MU (and 5 ties.) These years have seen some incredible clashes at Faurot Field, at Gaylord Family Stadium, and even in the Big XII championship, twice. Tonight, tensions seemed high as if it was 2008 again. Here, OU’s Deion Burks and Daylan Carnell jaw off during plays. At one point, OU defenders were holding Burks back.\n2. The True Son\nTheo Wease Jr., who spent three years at Oklahoma before transferring to Missouri, struck back at the Sooners tonight with two touchdown receptions. Here, he walks into the end zone calmly, Sooner defenders giving up behind him. After the game, he walked over to the OU fan section to taunt them. “You know this was personal,” he said.\n3. Class Act\nWhen MU’s Cayden Green, also an Oklahoma transfer, went down with an injury, his former teammate, OU linebacker Danny Stutman, knelt by Green and said a prayer before Green arose and walked back to the sideline.\n4. Live Brent Reaction\nThere was a critical 4th-and-1 play in the second quarter where Luther Burden rushed to the left side... but was shoved out of bounds by OU defenders (including Stutsman, who was incredible all night) right before the first-down marker. He was shoved right aside Oklahoma head coach Brent Venables (left) who can be seen pumping his fist in celebration.\n5. It’s Drew Pyne Time\nBackup quarterback Drew Pyne stepped up in a huge way Saturday in Brady Cook’s absence, as Cook recovers from hand and ankle injuries. The Notre Dame transfer completed 14-of-27 for 143 yards and 3 touchdowns, to Theo Wease twice and Brett Norfleet once. He also rushed for 15 yards, and here he can be seen celebrating one of his rushes.\n6. The Fumble\nThis game in one word would be “Fumble.” There were five (!!!) fumbles this game, and two of them (one per team) were returned for touchdowns. Triston Newson (14) forced this fumble, and OU’s Jackson Arnold (11) couldn’t do anything but watch.\n7. Young, the Man\nArnold’s fumble would be picked up by Zion Young, who found his way directly to the end zone. Football old-timers like my dad would say, “Fall on the fumble,” but Saturday’s game proved that conventional wisdom totally wrong.\n8. Triumphant Return\nMissouri assistant coach David “Dickey” Nutt was first diagnosed with cancer last February and took a leave from coaching that season to receive treatment. Recently, he was declared cancer-free and returned on Friday to coach Missouri’s game against Howard. He waved to fans as he received big cheers.\n9. Bates is Back\nAlso returning, guard Tamar Bates, who gave me a classic basketball picture as he yelled out loud while laying up this ball. Oh, and how about those uniforms!! Retro is back!\n10. Passion of the Guard\nAnother Tamar picture? I had to after he made this incredible expression after a ball went out-of-bounds on him. The best thing about Bates is how he gives his all on every play, and we saw it Friday.\n11. Air-ball!\nTurning to the women’s game, some of the players joined the fans in an “air-balll!” chant after Norfolk State started out poor. Nevertheless, Norfolk’s strong defense willed them past the Tigers in a less-than-ideal result.\n12. Abbey for Three\nTowards the end of the game, Abbey Schreacke got hot, hitting three consecutive three-balls. However, the quick nine points were not enough to put Missouri past visiting Norfolk State, a team which has made the NCAA tourney two of the past three seasons.\n13. Check your rulebook?\nLane Falch, of the Zou Crew, wrote this sign sometime in the first half, prompting some of us on press row to consult the rulebook and ascertain what that rule is. We discovered that it largely just defines what a foul is.\n14. Are ya blind??\nTurning to volleyball, the later sets of Wednesday’s game agsinst Georgia were marred by suspect officiating, and Dawn Sullivan showed her disagreement to the referees. As a photog who’s done a lot of these volleyball games by now, this may be the angriest I’ve ever seen the often reserved Sullivan.\n15. Way off!\nGeorgia’s Krista Blakely tried to block Colleen Finney’s ball, but she was way off base as Finney’s hit landed for a kill. Finney finished with ten kills, fourth best on the team, and a .500 hit percentage, second best.\n16. Point, Mizzou!\nHere’s another Finney picture— she celebrates as you can see the “POINT MIZZOU” signs being lifted in the background. After Missouri won that game 3 sets to 1, they then swept South Carolina on Sunday and trail Kentucky (10-2 SEC) in the conference... but still aren’t ranked yet. (#RankMizzou)",
