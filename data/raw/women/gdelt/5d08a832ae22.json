Clark is speaking out about the heated Angel Reese rivalry, and it's an appropriate time to do so, because Clark and Reese's teams just played each other on Sunday (June 23).\nCaitlin Clark and Angel Reese Rivalry\nOf course, Clark and Reese both entered the WNBA this year, and since both basketball stars were among the favorites in the draft, a so-called rivalry started to emerge. Even Ric Flair is impressed with these two athletes. It's worth mentioning that Reese might have some kind of issue with Clark, as she's even gone so far as to delete tweets that appear to be about the former Iowa star. But, tweets or no tweets, these ladies have found themselves in the center of the media, and at least Clark wants everyone to stop with the rivalry talk.\nBefore the Fever vs. Chicago Sky game this past weekend, a reporter asked Clark about her feelings on the so-called Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese rivalry. She didn't seem too thrilled with the question, and I can't blame her. She's probably sick and tired of all the Angel Reese talk. \"I'm pretty sure the only people that view this as a rivalry is all of you,\" she said during a press conference, which was after the Fever's game on June 21. \"Like, to us it's just a game of basketball.\" She added that while she's happy that both ladies have helped grow fans' interest in the teams, she thought the Fever vs. Sky matchup would be in a larger arena, like some of the previous Fever games this season. \"I thought that would have been really good for the game and really good for all the women's basketball fans in Chicago,\" she exclaimed. \"Maybe there's a conflict of some sort that I don't know about. Obviously, that's a little bit above my pay grade.\" She added that the \"two prior matchups have really lived up to what everybody expected\" and gave the fans some awesome basketball to watch.\nClark's team fell to Reese's team in Sunday's game. At one point, the Fever was leading by 15 points, but the Sky came back for the win. It was a great game for both Clark and Reese. Clark ended with 17 points and 13 assists, and Reese picked up 25 points, which was a career high, and 16 rebounds. Reese extended a record, too, as this game brought her eighth straight double-double, extending her record as the only rookie to achieve that.\n[select-listicle listicle_id=\"766510\" syndication_name=\"ranking-the-top-nba-superstars-today\" description=\"no\"]",
