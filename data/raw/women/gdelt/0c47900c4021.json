  "body_text": "To mark the 125th anniversary of FC Barcelona, the Club welcomed a new member to the big Barça family: the mascot CAT, which quickly won the heart of everyone.\nCAT is a wildcat, a feline native to Catalonia, whose DNA carries all the elements that define Barça: it is a charismatic, innovative, leading, demanding, creative, and inclusive mascot. Moreover, it is not defined by a specific gender, it is both feminine and masculine, thus becoming a symbol of modernity that reflects its inclusive spirit, with a friendly and positive character.\nIts appearance purposefully incorporates the Club's symbols. The edges of the crest shape its ears, as well as its cheeks and big smiling mouth. The blaugrana colours and yellow are very prominent, along with the four red stripes on a yellow background that assert the Catalan identity inherent to FC Barcelona, and even in the mascot's own name. Since its creation, CAT has strongly taken root among millions of Barça fans, both in Catalonia and around the world.\nIt never misses a home match of the men’s first team and is also a regular at the Johan Cruyff Stadium and the Palau Blaugrana, as well as accompanying different teams to important games away from Barcelona. But CAT has gone beyond the purely sporting realm. It is present in everyday life in Catalonia and never misses Sant Jordi’s Day or the National Day of Catalonia. It celebrates Christmas by “making the tió poop” and makes Easter sweeter by creating its own mona cake.\nIt loves traditions but embraces modernity, and loves other sporting events like Formula 1 and MotoGP races. It has made countless friends, including singers and actors. With its approachable and expressive character, CAT has also become a true media phenomenon on social networks. Its appearances, videos, and spontaneous moments have captivated the digital Barça community, establishing it as a beloved symbol for all Barça supporters.\nCAT, with its dual role as an institutional symbol and a friendly host, represents an open invitation to live and share the Club's values: effort, ambition, humility, respect, and teamwork.\nCAT is Barça. CAT is all of us.",
