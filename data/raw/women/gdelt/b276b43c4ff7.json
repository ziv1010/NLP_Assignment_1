Remo Stars’ reward is a blockbuster clash against South African heavyweights Mamelodi Sundowns.\nIt is a tie that rekindles the ever-intensifying football rivalry between Nigeria and South Africa.\nNigeria vs South Africa rivalry renewed\nIn recent years, contests between the two nations have rarely been straightforward.\nNigeria needed penalties to see off Bafana Bafana in the semi-finals of last year’s AFCON, before being held to consecutive 1-1 draws in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.\nAt youth level, South Africa shocked Nigeria’s Flying Eagles at the semifinals of the U20 AFCON earlier this year.\nA few weeks later, though, the Super Falcons gained revenge by beating Banyana Banyana 2-1 in the semifinal of the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco.\nThat backdrop sets the stage for Remo Stars, who will carry national pride as well as club ambition into their encounter with the Sundowns.\nSundowns, founded in 1970, are seasoned continental campaigners, having lifted the CAF Champions League in 2016 and finishing runners-up in the most recent edition earlier this year. They are also 18-time winners of the South African Premier Division.",
