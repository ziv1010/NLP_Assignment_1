With Ferran Olivé’s presentation completed, the floor returns to Carme Hortalà, president of the Economic Commission.\n1.15pm. Olivé explains that the club expects to close the current financial year in profit: “We must continue along this path of positive ordinary results. Revenue exceeds €1 billion.\"\n“In Media, we’ve budgeted on the basis of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals — any further progress would mean additional profit. In the commercial area, we project €543 million between BLM and new sponsorships.\n“Sporting salaries will rise (from €534m to €565m), but in proportion to increased income. Operating expenses will also rise, since this season we’ve played in three different stadiums — an exceptional situation.”\n“All in all, that leaves us with an ordinary profit of €5 million and a net profit of €4 million.”\n1.08pm. Next, Ferran Olivé will present the third item on the agenda: the budget for the 2025/26 season.\n1.05pm. The first item on the agenda — the approval of the financial results for the 2024/25 season — has been passed.\nA total of 553 delegate members took part in the vote, with the following results:\n✅ 412 in favour\n❌ 84 against\n⚪ 31 abstentions\n12.48pm. The vote on the financial results for the 2024/25 season is now underway.\n12.30pm. Board secretary Josep Cubells announces that 710 delegate members are accredited for the Assembly. The floor is now open for in-person questions.\n12.19pm. Carme Hortalà’s address concludes. The floor now opens for member questions and comments. The club has received seven questions on this agenda item through its online form. Afterward, questions will be taken in person and via videoconference.\nFerran Olivé’s presentation ends. The secretary, Josep Cubells, now gives the floor to Carme Hortalà, president of the Economic Commission.\n11.53am. “When we took over, 98% of the budget went to sporting costs. By 2019–20 it was down to 74%. UEFA recommends keeping it between 65% and 70%, and this season we’re at 54%. It’s something the board monitors very closely.”\n“As for debt, we inherited €560 million and have reduced it to €469 million — a cut of €211 million.”\n“Regarding net equity, we went from -€455 million to -€153 million. Without the stadium project, we’d already have positive equity, but we preferred this path without selling players. The auditor confirms our accounts are reliable.”\n11.50am. Treasurer Ferran Olivé reviews VIP seat sales at the Spotify Camp Nou: “Following the American model, of 9,600 VIP seats, 475 were offered as lifetime paid licences. This brought in €100 million, though the auditor only accepted €70 million as revenue.”\nHe adds: “Between the €80 million losses from Barça Produccions, the €15 million UEFA fine, and those €70 million in income, we end up with €10 million in extraordinary losses.”\nb. “We had budgeted €154 million for the stadium and reached €175 million. Without the new Spotify Camp Nou, these figures wouldn’t exist — but we made the decision for the sake of the club’s future. Once the stadium is fully open, it will generate €400 million annually.”\n“In Media, TV rights brought in €250 million. Commercial income reached €473 million. Thanks to the Nike deal, BLM now earns from e-commerce — €170 million this year, projected to reach €200 million next season, with a valuation of €800 million. The board has never considered selling 49% of BLM.”\n11.25am. “As a company, Barça’s situation is under control,” says Olivé. “Revenue increased despite playing at Montjuïc — from €893 million budgeted to €994 million actual, a great success. The downside is the extraordinary items, leaving a net result of -€17 million.”\n11.20am. Laporta’s speech concludes. Next up: Ferran Olivé presents the financial results for the 2024–25 season.\n11.19am. A total of 638 delegate members are accredited.\n11.15am. “All our actions aim to ensure Barça always remains owned by its members — without them having to reach into their pockets,” said Laporta. “The club’s financial recovery is consolidating, showing operational efficiency across all areas.”\n11.10am. Laporta also reviewed the other professional teams at FC Barcelona: \"In women's football, we are a reference point, we should be proud. Handball has also had success and while it's true that basketball and futsal did not achieve the best results, there were many injuries.\"\n\"We have maintained our essence and continue to be a respected multi-sport club. The badge is loved, respected, and admired all over the world.\"\n11.00am. The president looks back over last season: \"The 2024/25 season was historic. It began as the season of the 125th anniversary, with David Carabén’s manifesto of ‘We want the ball’. Barça kept on taking the initiative and has been a leader. This manifesto was prophetic. We won the League, the Copa del Rey, and the Super Cup with our own style of football.\"\n\"I want to give all the credit to Deco, to Flick and his staff, to the entire team of coaches and the medical staff, with a special mention to Carles Miñarro. Also to our players. There is a harmony between young players and those more experienced that gives us a high level of competitiveness. This harmony, led by Hansi Flick, allows us to have a team that has shown it can achieve any goal it sets itself.\"\n10.45am. With the Assembly under way, president Joan Laporta makes an opening speech: \"FC Barcelona members today will decide, as you have always done and always will, the present and future of the Club.\"\n10.00am.
