  "body_text": "England's Women's World Cup 2023 squad: Who's on the Plane?\nSarina Wiegman is set to named the England squad for the 2023 Women's World Cup on 31 May, revealing the 23 Lionesses that will make the trip Down Under for the tournament.\nThe reigning European champions are one of the favourites heading into the tournament, but a series of major injuries to key players, plus the retirement of a few others, will force Wiegman into changing the formidable lineup that won Euro 2022 less than 12 months ago.\nWith the opening game of the World Cup just eight weeks away, here are all the possible options that Wiegman could call on to build her squad from definites to maybes, and potential long shots.\nRuled out\nAfter suffering an ACL injury last month, captain Leah Williamson is ruled out of the World Cup. Chelsea midfielder Fran Kirby is also out after suffering a knee injury and opting for surgery.\nBeth Mead suffered an ACL injury back in November and was determined to make it back onto the pitch in time, but her selection looked high improbable.\nBack-up goalkeeper Sandy MacIver is the latest player to rule herself out of contention, deciding to focus on rehab from a groin injury ahead of the 2023/24 club season.\nDefinites\nThese players need little explanation, the first-choice players under Sarina Wiegman will likely make up the majority of her starting XI, earning themselves the first picks of the 23-player squad.\nGoalkeepers\nMary Earps (Man Utd), Ellie Roebuck (Man City), Hannah Hampton (Aston Villa)\nWith MacIver ruled out, Emily Ramsey not established enough to force her way in, and Hannah Hampton back in the fold after fitness trouble and personal issues earlier in the season, it looks as though Wiegman will keep the same three goalkeepers she had at Euro 2022.\nDefenders\nMillie Bright (Chelsea), Lucy Bronze (Barcelona), Alex Greenwood (Man City), Maya Le Tissier (Man Utd), Lotte Wubben-Moy (Arsenal), Jess Carter (Chelsea)\nMillie Bright and Lucy Bronze have both been recovering from injury in recent weeks but are expected to be ready for the World Cup and would be the only members of the Euro 2022 back four to still be in that part of the team. Maya Le Tissier has played her way into the squad this season.\nMidfielders\nKeira Walsh (Barcelona), Georgia Stanway (Bayern Munich), Ella Toone (Man Utd)\nWith Wiegman set to take plenty of wide forwards, the squad will generally be light on more conventional midfielders. The three here pick themselves, having all played crucial roles at Euro 2022. But the loss of Fran Kirby and Leah Williamson, who can play in defence or midfield, opens spaces.\nForwards\nAlessia Russo (Man Utd), Rachel Daly (Aston Villa) Lauren James (Chelsea), Lauren Hemp (Man City), Chloe Kelly (Man City)\nHaving operated up front for most of her club career, Rachel Daly has been reclassified as a striker in Wiegman's eyes and has scored goals for England this season. She effectively replaces Ellen White, who retired in the wake of Euro 2022 and has since become a mother for the first time.\nRead the latest England Women news here\nMaybes\nIf there are 17 definites as above, it leaves space in the final 23-player squad for just six more. But with plenty of genuine options to fill those gaps among players who have been involved with the Lionesses this season, Wiegman will have to be ruthless wih her selections.\nSteph Houghton (CB, Man City), Esme Morgan (RB/LB/CB, Man City), Niamh Charles (RB/LB, Chelsea), Lucy Parker (CB/DM, West Ham), Katie Zelem (CM, Man Utd), Jordan Nobbs (CM, Aston Villa), Laura Coombs (CM, Man City), Katie Robinson (RW, Brighton), Jess Park (RW/LW, Man City), Nikita Parris (RW/ST, Man Utd), Bethany England (ST, Tottenham), Ebony Salmon (ST, Houston Dash)\nFormer captain Steph Houghton's international career looked like it might have been over, but the sudden loss of Williamson creates a hole in defence that needs filling. She isn't the only option though, with Esme Morgan more verastile. Katie Zelem, Jordan Nobbs and Laura Coombs have all had good club seasons but are fighting for limited midfield places, while Bethany England hasn't been called up since September but is the main reason Tottenham are still a WSL club.\nLong shots\nIt would be very unexpected, but Wiegman could also surprise us all and go for a wildcard or two in the squad - former Lionesses who either haven't been around the England camp for a long time or those who are brand new to senior international football. A few fit the bill.\nMillie Turner (CB, Man Utd), Anna Patten (CB, Arsenal), Hannah Blundell (RB/LB, Man Utd), Maz Pacheco (LB, Aston Villa), Leah Galton (LW, Man Utd)\nMillie Turner is back to her best, while Anna Patten had a breakout year on loan with Aston Villa from Arsenal. Hannah Blundell has had a year of consistently high performances at left-back, where England lack depth, five years after her last appearances. Maz Pacheco would be another option in that position. Meanwhile, Leah Galton has reached double figures for goals in the WSL this season but has made herself unavailable for international football and is unlikely to change her mind.",
