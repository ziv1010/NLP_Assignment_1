It is a unifier. It doesn't need to be changed. We just need to be proud of it.\n\"So, I think they should just reconsider this and change it back. I'm not even sure they can properly explain why they thought they needed to change it in the first place.\"\nA petition on Change.org calling for a design change had already attracted more than 21,000 signatures by noon on Friday.\nSome football pundits and fans have criticised the design and price of the shirt since it was launched earlier this week.\nAn \"authentic\" version costs £124.99 for adults and £119.99 for children while a \"stadium\" version is £84.99 and £64.99 for children.\nSir Keir also called on Nike to reduce the price.\nBack in 2002, the price was £39.99 - if the price rose in line with inflation, it would cost £71.90 in 2024, over £50 less than the actual price this year.",
