  "body_text": "Liverpool man arrested on suspicion of racism must stay a mile away from any football ground\nA Liverpool fan arrested on suspicion of racially abusing Bournemouth striker Antoine Semenyo has been banned from every football stadium in the UK.\nThe opening match of the Premier League season at Anfield on Friday was briefly stopped in the first half after Semenyo lodged a complaint against a supporter with the referee.\nA 47-year-old man from Liverpool has been released on bail after being arrested the following day on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence.\nAs part of his bail conditions, he cannot attend any regulated football match in the UK, and is not allowed within a mile of any football stadium on match days.\nA Merseyside Police statement read: “We can confirm that a man has been conditionally bailed after he was arrested following reports that racist abuse was directed towards Bournemouth player Antoine Semenyo.\n“A 47-year-old man from Liverpool was arrested on Saturday 16 August on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence. He has now been bailed with conditions, which includes not to attend any regulated football match in the UK and not to go within one mile of a designated football stadium.”\nAccording to the Home Office, regulated football matches in England and Wales include those involving English and Welsh clubs in the top six levels of men’s English football (Premier League to National League North and South), the Cymru Premier, Women’s Super League and Women’s Championship, matches involving the national teams, and those such as the Champions League Final and some associated age group matches (under 18 and above).\nFriday evening’s game saw Semenyo, a Ghana international, go on to score twice as Bournemouth recovered from 2-0 down before Liverpool eventually won 4-2.\nSemenyo, 25, said on social media that the night at Anfield would stay with him forever “because of how the entire football family stood together”.\n“Football showed its best side when it mattered most,” he wrote, thanking his team-mates, Liverpool players and fans, as well as the Premier League officials “who handled it professionally”.\n‘Taking a knee has had no effect’\nAndoni Iraola, the Bournemouth head coach, said it was a “big shame that these things keep happening”, while captain Adam Smith was shocked by the abuse.\n“I don’t know how Ant has carried on playing and come up with these goals” Smith told Sky Sports after the game. “He’s a little bit down – something needs to be done. Taking a knee has taken no effect. We’ve supported him and hopefully he’ll be OK.\n“I wanted him to react [after scoring], that’s what I’d have done. I’d have gone straight over there. It shows what kind of man he is to report it to the ref and carry on.”\nGary Neville, who was at the game working for Sky Sports, branded the incident “despicable”.\n“That boy has been racially abused and goes over to a referee and complains about it,” he said. “It is despicable. I cannot believe what would go through someone’s mind. It has happened, it will keep on happening and it is a sorry state.”\nFellow pundit Jamie Carragher added: “Everyone was not sure what was going on. I mean the amount of campaigns we have, kick racism out and different things all across the world. It is shocking to see an incident like that.\nLiverpool Football Club is aware of an allegation of racist abuse made during our Premier League game against AFC Bournemouth.\nWe condemn racism and discrimination in all forms, it has no place in society or football.— Liverpool FC (@LFC) August 15, 2025\nThe Anfield incident took place two days after Mathys Tel, Tottenham Hotspur’s summer signing, was racially abused following his miss in their Uefa Super Cup penalty-shoot-out defeat against Paris St-Germain.\nIt also occurred just over a week after Telegraph Sport revealed Premier League players would not take the knee in the opening round of fixtures.\nThey will now perform the controversial anti-racism gesture on only two occasions this season, to coincide with October’s Black History Month.\nThe decision was taken by club captains after England Women stopped taking the knee following the racist abuse of defender Jess Carter at the European Championship last month.",
