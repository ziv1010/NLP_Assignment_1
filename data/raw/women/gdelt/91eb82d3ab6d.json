Bye week mindset\nThe Chargers are about to go on an extended break for the bye week, but will do so coming off their worst loss of the season.\nSo, how does Harbaugh look at his team as Week 12 approaches?\nHarbaugh said Monday that while there is certainly frustration after Sunday's loss, he has plenty of belief in the roster and the coaching staff to bounce back and be ready to go after the bye.\nHarbaugh noted that overcoming adversity is part of life, and life in the NFL, and that everyone in the organization has excelled in that area at some point of their career.\n\"It's the whole team I have faith in. And they do as well,\" Harbaugh said. \"Very, very tough men, plus faith, and that's what I believe, that's what I think of our team and every guy and women in the organization.\n\"They've all had issues to fix in their life and their careers in football and they wouldn't be here if they weren't good at that,\" Harbaugh said. \"I know they know how to do it. I know they care. I know they're not going to back down.\"\nAt 7-4, the Chargers still reside in a playoff spot with six games to go ... and will be in a Wild Card spot after Week 12 no matter what happens with this weekend's slate of games.\nThe Bolts are currently the No. 6 seed in the AFC as the second Wild Card team.\n2. A return for Hampton?\nHarbaugh said earlier this month that Omarion Hampton could return to practice after the bye week.\nThe rookie running back has been on Injured Reserve since early October and would need his 21-day practice window to be activated in order to return to the field.\nIs Hampton still in line to return to practice soon?\n\"We'll make that decision next week,\" Harbaugh said. \"It all depends on how he progresses this week.\"\nHampton had been one of the Chargers most productive offensive players before his injury, tallying 86 total touches for 450 yards and two touchdowns.\nThe 22-year-old has 66 carries for 314 yards and a pair of scores so far on the ground.\nKimani Vidal has filled in as the Chargers top running back of late and has rushed for 417 yards and two scores on 96 attempts.\nHarbaugh also had a health update on Vidal, who left Sunday's game in Jacksonville with a thigh injury but returned to the game.\n\"He was cleared to come back in,\" Harbaugh said.\n3. Schedule tweak\nA season ago, the Chargers had a Week 5 bye and had played just four games before getting a break.\nThe opposite happened this year as a Week 12 bye appeared on the Chargers schedule, meaning they endured 11 straight games — plus three games in the Eastern time zone and one in Brazil — before getting a weekend off.\nAs a result, Harbaugh tweaked the team's bye week schedule this year as the Bolts will not practice this week.\nPlayers will instead be off from Tuesday to Sunday before returning to get ready for a Week 13 home game against the Raiders.\n\"I also felt like our team had earned two extra days, mainly a function of the team has been playing 15 straight games, 15 straight week, plus all the way back to the start of training camp,\" Harbaugh said. \"My priority is that they are fresh, regroup and that's for players, coaches and staff. Come back ready to roll.\"\nThe Bolts reported to training camp way back on July 16, meaning it's been a nonstop grind that also included four preseason games.\nTake a look back at the Chargers Week 11 matchup with the Jaguars in monochrome.\n4. Recapping Sunday's loss\nHarbaugh echoed a similar message Monday afternoon that he did the day before in Jacksonville.\nSimply put, the Chargers weren't good enough in any area in a 35-6 road loss to the Jaguars.\n\"We got beat. The positive of that is we can learn from it and we could be better for it. We'll have that opportunity and that's what we will attack,\" Harbaugh said.\nHe later added: \"There's no player coming out of this game that is going to feel good about the game they played, or coach. We were out strategized. I don't feel good about it.\"\nThe Chargers were outgained 345 to 132 in total yards and also allowed 30 first downs while picking up just six of their own. The Bolts also lost the third-down battle as the Chargers converted just three of 12 tries while the Jaguars were 5-of-10 in that area.\n5. A look at the O-line\nThe Chargers rolled out a new starting offensive line in Week 11, marking the seventh different combination the Bolts have opened a game with in 2025.\nFour of the five linemen — Zion Johnson, Bradley Bozeman, Mekhi Becton and Trey Pipkins III — were part of the Week 1 starting lineup.\nBut it was Trevor Penning at left tackle in his Chargers debut after being acquired in a trade deadline deal with the Saints.\nHarbaugh was asked about Penning's performance and instead harped on the overall play of the team.\n\"There were times where he wasn't getting chip help and times where he was,\" Harbaugh said.\nHe later added: \"There are times when that happens. Everybody can't be doubled. Again, when it comes to the strategy piece, I know we didn't win that piece.\"\nBecton, meanwhile, was limited to just 27 snaps at right guard due to injury against the Jaguars. Jamaree Salyer played 21 snaps at that spot in relief.\n\"He's worked through some things at times,\" Harbaugh said of Becton.\nHarbaugh also noted that Salyer could be \"an option\" to play left tackle after the bye week, and said he has belief in that group to be better than they were Sunday.\n\"Like anything, you can improve. That's what we want to do,\" Harbaugh said. \"We want to get better. We know we're capable, we've had games where we more than capable, played very well.\n\"This game we regressed, we had some regression in all phases. We got beat in every phase,\" Harbaugh added.",
