One expected shift is the move from assistive AI, delivered through chatbots, to agentic systems that act autonomously. Another key trend will be the emergence of on-device AI, which will run locally on your phones, something that companies will do to address privacy concerns and latency issues.\nBeauty\nWith consumers making wellness central to spending, this will be the year beauty and wellbeing converge. So, ‘skinification of makeup’ could continue its rise, with makeup expected to add to more than just aesthetics. In 2026, hybrid formulas that combine makeup performance with skincare benefits — hydration, barrier repair, sun protection and active ingredients — will drive growth, according to beauty retail platform Tira.\nCars\nAmong next year’s defining automotive trends will be the democratisation of premium through technology, making “fancy” features an everyday reality for car buyers. The reasons are simple enough: Softwareled architectures, scalable platforms and falling sensor costs. What this means is that features like adaptive cruise control, surroundview cameras, OTA updates and personalised in-car experiences will become standard expectations rather than indulgences.\nDining & drinks\n“India’s alcohol market is adding 23 million new legal-age consumers every year, giving it a growth runway that mature markets like the US and UK no longer have,” says Narayan Manepally, cofounder and CEO of Geist Brewing Co. This and the sober-curious movement mean that drinking in 2026 will be about craft beers, low or no alcohol cocktails and a push to India’s craft spirits. Agave and rum are the new gin. Foodwise, micro diners and multi-sensory dining where presentation, sounds and atmosphere add to the experience will rule. What is also going to mark the foodscape in 2026 are chefs who work with farmers, thereby championing responsible sourcing and reviving biodiversity.\nEntertainment\nEntertainment will see growing blowback from creatives as AI seeps further into nearly every stage of content creation. In response, actors have begun proactively copyrighting their names, likenesses and unique attributes to retain control over their identities. The year ahead is likely to set the balance for how far AI can both disrupt and contribute to entertainment. Industry insiders say the focus will increasingly shift to building guardrails that protect the creative community and preserve the sanctity of copyright.\nFashion\nTrend forecasting agencies have called 2026 ‘the year of personal style’. Stylus’s trend forecaster Emily Gordon-Smith told CBC that there’s a renewed emphasis on personal style as a response that goes “against the algorithm”. This will impact how people will dress in 2026. However, as per the State of Fashion 2026 report by McKinsey, the global fashion industry will post low single-digit growth this year. What is showing growth, the report said, is secondhand fashion, with customers spending more on it in search of value as prices continue to rise in the primary market.\nGaming\nThe trend for the entertainment industry is true for gaming as well. A key difference, however, is that AI will enable gaming to become even more personalised and addictive. That’s because it can generate quests and environments that evolve around gamers, so they won’t be restricted to predesigned story arcs. But how that impacts gamer safety is yet to be seen.\nHealth\nThe rise of predictive healthcare will continue. Thanks to continuous biomarkers from wearables, smart rings and at-home sensors, people will get early alerts for even more issues — nutrient deficiencies, heart strain, sleep disorders and metabolic changes — before symptoms appear. AI will translate this data into daily, personalised reccos. Instead of annual checkups, continuous health snapshots will start to be the norm.\nInteriors\nIf there’s one trend that defines interiors in 2026, it’s ‘realness’. Think real wood, curved furniture, layered textures and jewel-toned paints (take that, Pantone). People want the lived-in, not curated, look. The trends point to curves in furniture and architecture to create conversational nooks, tactile fabrics with ‘texture’ becoming the new luxury, and a return of patterns. The key in all this is character. Think reclaimed pieces, burl styles, deeper tones and well-worn vintage furniture.\nJobs\nThe job market for candidates with the right skill sets is likely to remain robust in 2026. While rapid advances in automation and AI are set to disrupt sectors such as IT, overall hiring could still trend upward. Several industries plan to ramp up output after the preDiwali GST cut, and with global capability centres expanding, higher headcounts are likely in the new year.\nKids & Family\nForecasting agency TrendBible has noted a rise in “kidulting”, where parents consciously join their children in play as a way to strengthen emotional bonds. It is also emerging as a way for adults to re-connect with their inner child in order to relieve stress. Schools and edtech platforms report an increasing demand for experiential learning, with parents prioritising problem-solving and realworld discovery, and handson curiosity-led formats over passive instruction.\nLuxury\nSpending will increasingly flow toward immersive, hightouch experiences such as curated travel, destination dining, wellness retreats, cultural access and lifestyle memberships rather than purely product-led indulgence. These categories offer what luxury consumers value most: Social currency, memorability and a sense of identity that extends beyond the object.\nMusic\nWith the experienceeconomy and concert culture on a tear in India, next year could see Indian artistes become more conscious of their fandom and seek ways to monetise their audience. Regional genres such as Haryanvi, Bhojpuri and Malayalam are expected to evolve with global sonic influences, following the trajectory carved out by Punjabi musicians. Expect more cross-border collabs too.\nNutrition\nFibre maxing is a trend to watch for in 2026. It refers to the growing push to dramatically increase daily fibre intake for better gut health, metabolic stability and longevity. That means adding fibre supplements, resistant starches and high-fibre foods to support digestion, reduce inflammation and improve glucose control. Helps that it’s simple, lowcost and backed by strong science.\nOutdoors\nIt ain’t just about completing 10,000 steps a day. Folks are picking up games like Disc Golf, with dedicated local communities. Other rising outdoor games include frisbee and cornhole. Community event organisers are also noticing a significant rise in preference for nature and historical walks and food tours among Gen Z.\nPolitics\nWith Naidu-Nitish firmly backing the BJP-led coalition government at the Centre and the Congress showing little momentum to reclaim lost ground, 2026 is likely to be marked by political calm at the national level. The real drama, however, will play out in state elections — particularly Assam, West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu — where highvoltage contests will dominate the first half of the year.\nQuick commerce\nThe next iteration of quick commerce could see brands directly offering quick delivery to stay competitive. This is expected to drive the rise of shared infrastructure, particularly common dark stores and logistics networks, enabling more brands to plug into Q-commerce without building everything themselves.\nRelationships\n2025 was not a good year for dating. It was a toxic world of ‘shrekking’ and ‘monkey-barring’. By December, Vogue UK declared that having a boyfriend is embarrassing (ouch!). Plot twist: Tinder’s Year in Swipe report says 2026 might be… hopeful. Think clarity, confidence and honesty, with trends like clear-coding (being clear about your love life demands), emotional vibe coding (emotional honesty) and hot-take dating (being okay with dating someone with strong opinions). Finally, 2026 is when ‘friendfluence’ will grow, as 42% singles confirmed that their pals are a major influence on their love life.\nSports\n2025 was a watershed year for women’s cricket in India with Harmanpreet Kaur’s team capturing the imagination of the country in a way the men’s team did in 1983. 2026 should be the year for women — and BCCI — to build on that momentum and create an even broader and more national appeal for the women’s game. It could also be the year that other sports learn from the way these women performed, and try to bring home the same sparkle.\nTravel\nBileisure — combining business travel with some leisure — has been a thing of late in the West, as the Gen Z workforce refuses to keep the two separate. That is likely to happen more often in India as well, with an increase in trip extensions over weekends. What is enabling this in 2026 would be smart AI reccos to squeeze out that extra bit more from a trip — say things like cool half day itineraries for cities.\nUnplugging\nSupper clubs will continue to quietly replace nights out. Elaborate tasting menus with cosy, curated gatherings where strangers become familiar over slow meals will be in vogue. Another shift: Picking up phones mid-sentence to click food pictures ain’t cool anymore. More folks will pick up small, repeatable rituals like journalling, sketching or stepping into sound baths and breathwork circles for a deeper reset.\nVintage\nGen Z, wary of mainstream trends, is fuelling renewed interest in vintage luxury bags. Vintage fashion is also set to move further into the spotlight through everyday, wearable elements, says Niti Goenka, founder of preowned luxury platform, My Almari. Accessories such as brooches will return as styling anchors instead of afterthoughts, alongside the rise of poetcore — oversized turtlenecks, vintage blazers and worn-in messenger satchels that bring an intellectual softness.\nWorld Cup\nThe football World Cup, co-hosted by Mexico, Canada and the US will be the first with 48 teams, and how that will impact the quality of the game itself is anyone’s guess. However the geopolitics involved will be as captivating as what happens on the pitch, with the cohosts not being on the best of terms since Donald Trump’s became US President for a second time.\nXtended reality\nThere was a time when the gawky looking Google Glass was laughed at from a distance. But the days of XR wearables, especially of the augmented reality (AR) kind, being inducers of nerd jokes are over. The new generation of Meta/Ray-Ban glasses are certainly more ‘normal’, and there are more launches coming up. Google and Samsung are reportedly collaborating for one, and Amazon too. Snap could also up its AR game. The big worry as this becomes mainstream continues to be privacy.\nYouth\nYouth will turn quiet, quite soon this year. Sober parties will move from being a niche for wellnessconscious Gen Z who still want the music and the energy, just without the hangover. A sharper focus on selfawareness and individuality is shaping such choices, where authenticity scores over social media friendly. The clearest signal? The rise of the ‘Posting Zero’ profiles — think social media consumption without posting.\nZero-Waste\nThe increasing buying power of Gen Z is making companies take them seriously, especially in sustainability. Demands like zerowaste dining (for example, compostable menus, closed-loop kitchens and no singleuse anything) to adopting innovations like edible water pods, are already gaining traction. Another rising trend is regenerative packaging.",
