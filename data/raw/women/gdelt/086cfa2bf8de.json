While speaking at the Psychedelic Science conference in Denver recently, 24-year-old Jaden Smith said his mother introduced their family to psychedelics. The musician said, \"I think it was my mom, actually, that was really the first one to make that step for the family. It was just her for a really, really long time, and then eventually, it just trickled and evolved, and everybody found it in their own ways.\"\nJaden credited the hallucinogenic drugs for helping him bond with his siblings, Willow, 22, and half-brother Trey, 30. \"Siblings can argue so much and fight so much, and lord knows me and my siblings have done so much of that in the past,\" he said. \"But the level of love and empathy that I can feel for them inside of the [psychedelic] experiences and outside of the experiences has been something that's profound and beautiful.\"\nPsychedelics Over Prozac\nThis isn't the first time the Smith family has spoken about their use of psychedelics. During a 2021 episode of Red Table Talk, Jaden and Jada opened up about their personal experience with psychedelics. Jada, 51, said she was introduced to plant medicine ten years ago to deal with depression. She said the treatment \"knocked it out,\" unlike going to therapy and being put on Prozac. \"It's not successful for everybody,\" she said of going the traditional route. \"I struggled with depression for so long. And the thing about the plant medicine is it helps you feel better but also solves the problems of how you got there in the first place.\"\nRELATED: Jaden Smith Responds To Resurfaced Clip Mocking His Age Group\nMeanwhile, Jaden cited recent studies highlighting mushrooms as one of the most significant advances in treating depression since more traditional anti-depressants like Prozac inspired his use of psychedelics. He started using it out of curiosity, leading to his understanding of what ego was \"for the first time.\" The \"Icon\" rapper said, \"It was always in my head talking, telling me what I was and what I wasn't.\" He also shared his first-time experience of ego death (an ecstatic state in which self-identity is completely lost).\nJaden continued, \"That was the moment that really changed me. You get to a place where you are blocked by something, whether it's a trauma or your emotions or ego, not being able to express yourself. Psychedelics are a way to tear down that wall and see what is beyond it. Doing it guided with people who are professionals really increases the chances of having that mystical experience.\" Many psychedelics are illegal and classified under Schedule I, but a few, like psilocybin mushrooms, have been decriminalized and are being pushed for legalization in a growing number of states.\nThese Celebrities Have A July Birthday\nPeople born in July are either a Cancer (July 1 – July 22) or a Leo (July 23 – July 31). For a little more than half of the month, Cancers take charge. Represented by the crab, this water sign is ruled by the moon. Cancers are known to be emotional and nurturing people, and usually tend to be the caregivers of the people in their life. Compassionate with a goofy sense of humor, you can rely on Cancers for being in tune with their emotions.\nLeos, on the other hand, are a fire sign, represented by the ferocious lion. Opposite to Cancers, Leos are ruled by the sun and with that, usually love being the center of attention. They are passionate and theatrical, so it makes sense that a lot of successful actors on this list have found success. This sign brings about natural leaders and are known to be loyal, putting their hearts into every endeavor. However, these positive, strong traits can be impaired by their ego, pride, and jealousy when they start to fear threatened.\nSome of the most iconic actors and comedians were born in the month of July.
