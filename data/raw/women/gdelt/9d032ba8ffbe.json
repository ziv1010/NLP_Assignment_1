  "body_text": "The biggest game of their lives is on the on-deck circle. The opportunity includes a road trip and a live date broadcast by ESPN.\nThis week would’ve been a reasonable time for the U12 all-stars of the North Boulder Little League to feel more than a few jitters. Not many 12-year-olds get to play baseball on ESPN.\nYet seizing up in the face of adversity isn’t what has driven this group into a chance at history. And this group of old-school grinders isn’t ready to stop having fun just yet.\nAfter a summer of triumph and rapid improvement, the U12s of the NBLL have played their way into the brink of history as the club, on the heels of its state championship, will compete in the Little League Baseball Mountain Region Tournament in San Bernardino, Calif., with a berth in the Little League World Series on the line.\nThe NBLL will play on Sunday at 1 p.m. MT against the winner of Saturday’s game between Montana and Nevada. The game will be available on the ESPN+ streaming service. Regardless of Sunday’s result, NBLL will play its second game of the double-elimination tournament on Tuesday.\n“It’s just a great team. We throw lots of strikes, make plays in the field, and we hit the ball really hard. I think harder than most teams,” head coach Joe Lutt said. “Even if it’s not a hit, it’s a hard-hit ball to a 12-year-old who may or may not make the play. So a lot of hard contact I think has been the secret of our success. We’ve scored a lot of runs throughout districts and state.\n“To be honest, it was one of my biggest worries that they would get burned out. Because it’s so much baseball for a 12-year-old. It’s consumed their whole summer. But I do feel like they’re ready. They’re not burned out, they’re having fun. They’re ready to go.”\nIn the shadows of a university whose athletic programs are sliding further into the morass of short-tenured transfers, NIL-fueled allegiances and conference loyalties that stretch only as far the next lucrative media deal, the NBLL U12s offer a breath of fresh air and a touch of nostalgia. It’s youth baseball, after all. It’s supposed to be fun.\nIt’s the head coach tossing batting practice and covering home in his flip-flops. It’s wild-haired first baseman Milo Tromey explaining how cool it will be to come home and fire up the DVR to watch the game — hopefully games — on ESPN. It’s Luca DiCorleto, sidelined early in the season due to an injury, still chipping in every day however needed, juggling roles like groundskeeper, first base coach and head cheerleader. It’s Jerex Jones coming to the conclusion the eye black he was wearing during a few early-season losses was actually the culprit behind the setbacks. Hence, the squad will take a strict no-eye black superstition to California.\nAnd, of course, it’s dutiful work at the craft as well. Like Colton Priest, he of the countless hours of extra batting practice undertaken this summer, ripping line drives during one of the final tune-ups before the big road trip.\n“I think this team is super close,” said the U12’s Reed Bent. “Outside of baseball, too. A lot of us have played on other club teams, or we’ve just played on other teams with each other. So everyone knows each other and we were all friends coming into the season. Everything just kind of clicked this summer and we learned to play together very easily. I thought we had a chance of going to state and maybe making it to the finals. But I did not think we’d be playing on TV. I did not think we were going to have this opportunity.”\nThe team hasn’t been infallible, yet has displayed a wisdom beyond its collective years in the team’s ability to turn defeats into productive lessons. The NBLL U12’s suffered a loss early in the district tournament against Thornton but afterward went on a roll, winning six games in seven games by a combined total estimated by Lutt to be about “78-3 over those six games.” For all of the laid-back, easy-going approach the NBLL U12s are packing for California, the group is playing with plenty of passion and focus, as well.\nMany on the squad still look up to the 2021 NBLL squad that advanced this far. This group is set on etching its own legacy.\n“I saw a quote from Kobe (Bryant) that says the more you work than anyone else, you’re going to pass people a lot easier,” said Priest, whose sister, Ava, is a starter on the CU women’s soccer team. “I had a Little League coach who was a sports psychologist, so he gives me stuff to work on to keep calm. Like when you think of baseball, it’s a dumb game. You’re playing with a stick and a baseball. That’s how I stay calm and just have fun. I don’t care about the cameras, it’s about having fun. That’s what Little League is for.”",
