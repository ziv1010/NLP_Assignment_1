  "body_text": "A$AP Rocky Tranmere takeover 'expected to be complete ahead of next season'\nThe rapper is reported to be part of a consortium looking to take over the club\nThe takeover of Tranmere Rovers by a consortium reported to involve A$AP Rocky should be completed by the start of next season, according to the club's current directors. The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Athelaston Mayers, is expected to be part of a consortium, led by Donald Trump's former lawyer Joe Tacopina, which was last year granted a period of exclusivity to buy the Birkenhead club.\nRovers are currently owned by former Football Association chief executive Mark Palios and his wife Nicola Palios. In the club's accounts for the year ending June 30, 2024, which were published on Companies House this month, a statement from Mr Palios on behalf of the board provided an update on the takeover.\nIt said: \"In April 2024, an exclusivity agreement was reached with a consortium of investors with the intention that they should be in place ahead of season 24/25. In the event, it has not been possible to complete the sale process. However, the Directors anticipate that a sale will be completed ahead of the 25/26 season.\"\nIn November, Mr Palios said that Mr Tacopina had made his presence felt around the club. He told talkSPORT: \"Joe Tacopina has come to the game. I'm under an NDA (non-disclosure agreement) in terms of (takeover talks) with a number of people but Joe has come to the games, he's not been afraid to put his presence out there.\n\"At the end of the day, whether he brings A$AP Rocky in or not is down to him. It's the type of thing I think would enhance his consortium because they can add value to the commercial side. A$AP's [partner] is, of course, Rihanna.\"\nIn February, the proposed takeover was reported to have progressed after Mr Mayers was found not guilty of firing a handgun at a former friend on a Hollywood street. Sky Sports News reported that Mr Mayers' acquittal means his consortium's bid to take over Rovers has \"moved a step closer\".\nThe outlet said it understands the process remains on course to be completed in time for the next football season, but Tranmere avoiding relegation from League Two is key to the deal being finalised.\nThe accounts for the club, who sit 21st in League Two and parted ways with manager Nigel Adkins in February, showed revenues of just under £6m, an increase in the year before. Despite the revenue increase, investment in the playing squad of £500,000 saw a cash operating loss of £700,000.\nAbout the financial situation, Mr Palios said Tranmere must increase their ability to bring in money, highlighting the possibility of a new stadium and regeneration at their current home at Prenton Park.\nHe said: \"The resilience of the club is strong, as can be seen by the financial results achieved despite the headwinds of the unstable economic environment in which we continue to operate.\n\"The continued material year-on-year increases in player wages provides a challenging environment. As we have seen, even increasing our playing budget to the highest we’ve ever had it in season 24/25 does not guarantee on-field success.\"\n\"However, to be competitive, we must continue to increase the capacity of the Club to generate income which is not impacted by on-field performance to the same extent as the traditional model for a football club.\n\"In the short term the Club has plans to regenerate and repurpose the recreation centre at Prenton Park with the benefit of the support of Wirral Borough Council.\n\"In the longer term, such projects include the expansion of the Campus and the potential for a new stadium as an integral part of the regeneration of the Wirral.\"",
