And for Gabrielle, playing the East Compton Clovers cheer captain was a total game changer.\n\"Back then, I never would’ve imagined stepping into the East Compton Clover uniform would bring so many blessings,\" the 52-year-old shared on Instagram Aug. 23. \"It truly is the gift that keeps on giving.\"\nIndeed, she shared that back in 2000, the cast never could have imagined the hit the film would become—with it even inspiring a Broadway musical 12 years later.\n\"We just thought we were having a fun summer in San Diego, making a movie about cheerleading,\" she reflected in the video, \"but we made an instant classic about so much more—politically, socially relevant topics that are still resonating today.\"\nAnd she noted she has the fans to thank for continuing the legacy.\n\"You guys have shown up since day one,\" she continued, \"and you continue to show up again and again.\"\nTo see what the Bring It On cast has been up to since then, keep reading.",
