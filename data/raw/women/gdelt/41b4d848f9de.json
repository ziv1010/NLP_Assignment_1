  "body_text": "It’s Sunday evening, the day before St. Patrick’s Day, and disappointment lingers in Roscommon after a tough day on the sporting front. The trip to Dr. Hyde Park didn’t end as we had hoped, with Roscommon falling short against Cavan. A win would have put us on the brink of a return to Division One, but instead, the defeat means we are not guaranteed a return to the top flight, but it’s still possible. There was plenty at stake, and while the Rossies fought hard, it just wasn’t to be.\nSport is at the heart of what makes us Rossies tick, and unfortunately Sunday was a day of hard lessons. While the battle unfolded in Hyde Park, history was also being made elsewhere—but not in the way we had hoped. Lisa and Aoife O’Rourke, two proud Roscommon women, stepped onto the world stage in Serbia, aiming to become World Champions. They fought bravely, but both fell short in their respective finals. Despite the losses, they remain an inspiration to us all, having already achieved so much in their careers. The fact that they were the first sisters to contest world boxing finals at the same championships is an incredible achievement in itself, and no doubt they will come back stronger. Also they were the only Irish boxers in the medals at these world championships. Not bad for two girls from Tarmon.\nCloser to home, March is in full swing, and the Herald’s Sports Supplement continues to fill up. On the local GAA scene, club leagues are well underway. My own club, Éire Óg, finally put a point on the board this weekend after drawing with Kilmore in James Timothy Park—a much-needed boost after last week's defeat to Creggs. It’s early days yet, but every point matters, and the competition is only heating up.\nOf course, St. Patrick’s weekend wouldn’t be complete without a mention of Cheltenham. I don’t know about the rest of you, but my few small bets certainly didn’t make me rich this year! The punters took a beating, while the bookies walked away with their bags full of cash. Just two of the seven odds-on favourites delivered over the four days, leaving many hopeful accumulators in ruins. This year marked only the second time since the festival expanded to four days that the leading contenders in the big four championship races were beaten—2017 being the only other occasion.\nThat being said, there was still plenty for the Irish to celebrate. Our trainers dominated once again, securing 20 wins to Britain’s eight. Any time we get one over on the auld enemy, it’s a good week, and once again, we get to retain The Prestbury Cup, named after the village near Cheltenham Racecourse. There’s something uniquely satisfying about seeing Irish horses and trainers come out on top on one of the biggest stages in racing.\nBut this week wasn't just about sporting drama. On the world stage, another high-stakes encounter was unfolding—the meeting between Donald Trump and Micheál Martin. While I didn’t catch it all live, I listened to some of it on the radio during my journey home, as The Ray D’Arcy Show carried coverage. It felt a bit like listening to a football match. There I was, gripping the steering wheel, shouting, “that’s the boy!” when Micheál Martin landed a well-placed point, praising the president’s peace initiatives in Ukraine, Gaza, and beyond. He went on to emphasise the US’s role in securing peace in Ireland and how vital that relationship remains.\nTrump, never one to miss an opportunity for theatrics, had clearly done his homework. He brought up Martin’s connection to boxing—his father was an Irish champion who represented the country on the international stage. In typical Trump fashion, he leaned into the flattery, saying, “I know so many Irish fighters. They like to fight, and they are damn good at it too.” Then, turning to Martin, he added, “his father was a great fighter, actually. So that means, genetically, I’m not going to mess around with you. You understand? I’m a believer in that.” It was classic Trump, part charm, part bravado, but it was also a rare moment of acknowledgment. Martin, to his credit, handled it well, standing his ground and making his points heard. It was an interesting exchange, especially given how crucial US-Irish relations remain in an increasingly unpredictable global landscape.\nThe political engagements continued throughout the day. There was a strong Irish presence in the morning with US Vice President JD Vance, followed by another event in the White House with Trump that evening. Everything seemed to be going well, and we left Washington on Wednesday with a sense of achievement, our delegation feeling like they had kept a clean sheet and earned a draw.\nBut then, as is often the case in politics, the celebrations were short-lived. By Thursday, the news broke of fresh tariffs being imposed on EU products, with the European Union responding in kind. The question now is: where does this all end? How much more will ordinary people have to pay? While the political and economic chess games continue at the highest levels, it's the everyday person who ultimately foots the bill.\nIt’s a reminder that whether it’s in sport, politics, or business, victories and setbacks go hand in hand. In Hyde Park, in Serbia, at Cheltenham, and in Washington, the stakes are always high. But as Rossies, as Irish people, we keep showing up, keep competing, and keep pushing forward. That’s what makes us who we are.\nAnd though Sunday didn’t bring Roscommon football a step closer to Division One or two World Championship gold medals to Castlerea, we still have plenty to be proud of. Resilience is in our DNA, and you can be sure that we’ll dust ourselves off and come back stronger. That’s the Rossie way.",
