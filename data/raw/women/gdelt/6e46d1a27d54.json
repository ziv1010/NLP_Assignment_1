  "body_text": "Former Manchester United and England striker Mason Greenwood is attracting interest from the Premier League ahead of the summer transfer window.\nGreenwood, 23, has enjoyed a productive season at French club Marseille, scoring 20 goals in 35 appearances.\nThe forward was released by Manchester United in 2023 following a six-month internal investigation into his conduct.\nThe investigation was carried out after Greenwood was arrested in January 2022 following allegations surrounding material published online.\nGreenwood was charged with rape and assault before prosecutors dropped the case against him in February 2023.\nDespite Greenwood’s largely impressing performances at Marseille, sources close to the player believe a transfer within the next two windows is a ‘possibility’, according to The Telegraph.\nGreenwood’s spell in France has not been completely plain sailing, with the young forward attracting criticism from Roberto De Zerbi and the club’s fans over his work-rate.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\nJust last month fans at the Stade Velodrome unfurled a huge a banner telling Greenwood to ‘get moving’.\nWith Greenwood not ruling out a summer move, transfers to Spain, Italy or even Saudi Arabia have been raised as possibilities, though Barcelona’s interest appears to have disappeared.\nThe player’s preference, according to reports, would be to return to his native north of England, though campaigners in the UK would be against such an outcome.\nMan Utd statement on Mason Greenwood exit\n‘All those involved, including Mason, recognise the difficulties with him recommencing his career at Manchester United.\n‘It has therefore been mutually agreed that it would be most appropriate for him to do so away from Old Trafford, and we will now work with Mason to achieve that outcome.\n‘Based on the evidence available to us, we have concluded that the material posted online did not provide a full picture and that Mason did not commit the offences in respect of which he was originally charged.\n‘That said, as Mason publicly acknowledges today, he has made mistakes which he is taking responsibility for.’\nThe decisions-makers of Premier League clubs appear less bothered by the potential backlash, however, with at least two unnamed top-flight teams ‘weighing up’ approaches.\nGreenwood scored 35 goals in 129 appearances for Manchester United and was viewed as one of the most exciting and talented players at Old Trafford before his release.\nHe was contracted to his boyhood club until the summer of 2025 but ended up leaving two years earlier.\nThe youngster had also broken into the England team under Sir Gareth Southgate, though a Three Lions return is off the table after Greenwood switched his international eligibility to Jamaica.\nAfter Manchester United confirmed Greenwood’s exit, Women’s Aid – a charity which works to end domestic abuse against women and children -said it welcomed United’s decision.\n‘We know that today’s news from Manchester United that Greenwood will be moving on will be a relief for many survivors of domestic and sexual abuse,’ it said in a statement.\n‘Football is loved by so many people worldwide, and players are often idolised by fans, so the way that alleged domestic abuse cases are treated in clubs has a huge impact on public understanding about what is accepted and tolerated in society.\nMore Trending\nThe Manchester United Supporters Trust added: ‘Since the deeply distressing initial allegations surfaced, this episode has been allowed to drag out for far too long as the club has carried out an investigative process.\n‘Moreover, the complete lack of consultation with fans even with respect to process added fuel to the fire.\n‘Whilst the speculation and discussion in the last couple of weeks has been profoundly unhelpful and reflected very poorly on the club, it is clear that they have in the end reached the right decision.\n‘We are relieved that this matter can now be put behind us and will be working with the club to ensure lessons have been learned from this very troubling episode.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nMORE: Is Tottenham vs Crystal Palace on TV?
