This will be a hallmark in women's football on the Coast and the exposure it will give to us through spectators and other young girls coming to watch us play,\" Purton said.\n\"It's inspiring the next generation of female footballers and giving them recognition.\n\"This is more than football. It's about eradicating sexism and misogyny in sport and in general, and views that people are lesser based on gender.\"\nWhy does that not transfer to football? It leaves a big question for us girls and we want to know why we aren't given the same respect.\n- Georgia Purton\nThe 24-year-old, who represented the NWFL in the Women's All-Star Series last year, shared that she did not experience any kind of discrimination on game days but had heard odd passing comments.\n\"Why is it surprising that women can play football and we're athletes, it's the rhetoric that women are ok at this and might actually be alright. It's like a backhanded compliment,\" she said.\n\"It's not something that we just go out there to have fun with and get a participation medal, we take this so seriously, and this is ride or die.\n\"We train just as hard as the men, why can't we be recognised as much as the men.\"\nIf the motion is successful, it would mean the colts' games are played at 9am.\nAccording to Purton, Jackson's motion was supported by the Penguin Football Club.\nPurton was hopeful that the league would follow in the footsteps of other sports across the Coast, which have equality between their men's and women's programs.\n\"I don't know what it is about football that there's such a divide between men and women,\" she said.\n\"If you look at sports across the Coast and in general, we have an alignment between men and women.\n\"Why does that not transfer to football? It leaves a big question for us girls and we want to know why we aren't given the same respect.\"",
