The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) is still shopping for a manager since Jose Peseiro’s exit.\nFinidi named Stanley Nwabali in goal behind the back five of Semi Ajayi, Chidozie Awaziem, Bright Osayi-Samuel, Bruno Onyemaechi and Benjamin Tanimu, who made his debut for the team.\nWilfred Ndidi returned to the team after missing the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) due to an injury, and he was supported in the midfield by Alex Iwobi and Frank Onyeka.\nThe front two were Kelechi Iheanacho and Dessers.\nAlthough the Eagles maintained the team’s typical formation during their silver-winning campaign at the AFCON in Cote d’Ivoire, the execution against the Ghanaians was more progressive.\nNigeria dominated Ghana in the early stage, with Iheanacho and Dessers testing Lawrence Ati-Zigi, the Black Stars goalkeeper.\nThe Eagles took the lead in the 38th minute after Salis Abdul Samed handled the ball inside the Ghanaians’ goal area, and the referee awarded a penalty to Nigeria.\nDessers stepped up and sent Ati-Zigi the wrong way from the spot.\nThe Black Stars resumed the second half a better side, but their resurgence was nipped in the bud after Jerome Opoku was sent off for dissent.\nThen Tanimu made way for Lookman, and the substitute soon cushioned Nigeria’s lead. A well-oiled build-up saw Iwobi setting the Atalanta forward up in the box, and he made a mistake finding the top left corner of the Ghanaian goal.\nAlthough Jordan Ayew did pull on back for Ghana from the spot late in the game, the Eagles held on for a famous victory.\nRead Also: Why Ndi Igbo must support, defend Tinubu’s govt – Kalu\nNigeria will face Mali on March 26 in the second match of the international friendly fixtures.\nGhana’s Black Princesses beat Nigeria’s Falconets to African games gold\nGhana gained the upper hand as Black Princesses dethroned defending champions Nigeria’s Falconets with a dramatic 2-1 victory after extra time in the U20 Women’s African Games final in Accra.\nThe Falconets looked to be cruising to back-to-back gold medals when Edeh Loveth Ndjeka opened the scoring in the 24th minute, capitalising on a goalkeeping howler.\nBut the home side showed tremendous character to claw their way back into the contest as Tracy Twum’s 78th-minute strike took the pulsating clash to an additional 30 minutes.\nDuring that nervy extra period, the Black Princesses landed the decisive blow – Mukarama Abdullai rifling home a sensational long-range effort to spark wild celebrations.\nThe 2-1 triumph sealed Ghana’s second African Games gold in the U20 women’s competition.",
