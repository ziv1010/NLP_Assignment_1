And the Lionesses twitter account confirmed the news on Tuesday morning posting: \"Another sold-out Wembley awaits... Thank you.\" Demand for tickets has been huge, as it could be the last chance for football supporters to see the European champions in action on home soil before they depart for Australia in the summer for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nAnd the huge crowd is expected to see the Lionesses break yet another attendance record. The game against Brazil is set to attract the largest attendance for a women's game in the UK, outside of a major international tournament.\nThat record currently stands at 77,768, from when England met Germany at Wembley in a friendly back in November 2019. The Germans winning 2-1.\nLast year's clash with USA in October went close to topping this, with a crowd of 76,893 in attendance to see goals from Lauren Hemp and Georgia Stanway down the reigning world champions. But the Finalissima is now expected to attract a larger crowd than both, with the game having sold out over nearly three months in advance.\nAs per the men’s event, the Finalissima pits the European champions against the best side in South America. If England can win it will be another major step towards becoming the undisputed best team in the world, and give Sarina Wiegman's squad huge confidence with the World Cup looming into view.\nIt remains to be seen whether the April clash will break the attendance record when including matches at major tournaments. This is held by the Euro 2022 final that saw a crowd 87,192 fans inside Wembley, when Chloe Kelly struck in extra-time to secure a first major trophy for the Lionesses. The only way fans can still obtain tickets for the Brazil game, is through Wembley hospitality packages.\nAttendances across the women's game have boomed since England's triumph last summer. Attendances in the Women’s Super League are up 200 per cent so far this season. Fans are flocking to see Leah Williamson, Chloe Kelly, Beth Mead and England's other summer heroes in action, as well as international stars such as Sam Kerr, Ona Batlle and Vivianne Miedema.\nThe highest attendance for a WSL club game was set when Arsenal and Tottenham played in front of 47,367 fans at Emirates Stadium back in September. The Gunners return to the Emirates for a London derby against Chelsea this weekend, with a crowd of over 40,000 once again expected.\nREAD MORE: Jordan Nobbs explains why she left WSL title-chasing Arsenal to join Aston VillaREAD MORE: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had amusing encounter with Man Utd women's captain Katie ZelemNEW!
