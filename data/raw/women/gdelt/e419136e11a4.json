  "body_text": "You couldn’t complain about the way Chelsea Women started their match today against Everton at Kingsmeadow. From kick-off the hosts looked to get the game in a good pace, resulting in a Catarina Macario chance that nearly got us the lead six minutes into the encounter versus the Toffees.\nChelsea FCW 0-1 Everton FCW, Women’s Super League: Post-match reaction\nImperfect\nUnfortunately for us football is a very simple game. You can land the best talent on the pitch, get huge amounts of possession and shots against the goal to start things off, and then go behind in the scoreline due to a mental slip-up. This is what took place as Honoka Hayashi opened the scoring for the visitors, as a set of baffling decisions allowed Toni Payne to do what she does best and assist the Japanese midfielder with a run and cross from the left flank.\nEverton could now just sit back and pray for the best. The best being Chelsea’s complete inaptitude to break down a domestic opponent sitting at 10th place in the Women’s Super League after almost beating Barcelona at Stamford Bridge two-and-a-half weeks ago.\n- Maika Hamano back in the starting lineup.\n- Toni Payne loves playing against us.\n- We’ve had too many of “those days” under Sonia.\n- Next up: Roma at home in the Women’s Champions League.\n- KTBFFH.",
