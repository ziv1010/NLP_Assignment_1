  "body_text": "West Virginia’s men’s and women’s basketball teams embark on similar European trips next week, but their approaches to the three games each will play in Italy (men) and Italy and Croatia (women) is a bit different, largely owing to the makeup of each team, from coaching staffs to rosters.\nOn the men’s side, the reconstruction is just past an initial stage, with a completely new coaching staff and a roster that has is 86% different than last year’s, with only two players — Ofri Naveh and walk-on Aden Tagaloa-Nelson — returning. That means there isn’t going to be much tactical preparation for the games on the trip.\n“When you only have one guy — Tucker (DeVries) — that knows any of stuff we have run before, and even a good portion of the staff that is learning new terminology and new ways, it’s a process,” head coach Darian DeVries said of the team. “It’s going to take a while. We’ll throw a lot of different lineups out there and look at some different things, and we’ll try to play the younger guys some more. I just want us to play together, but I don’t expect it to be great. There’s no shootaround, no walk-through, you just go play.”\nWith travel an even bigger part of the tour than it is in Big 12 conference play, DeVries doesn’t want the competition to become a slog.\n“I don’t put a lot into (these games),” he continued, not discounting the benefits of playing against another opponent, while understanding that putting too much on a team that is still in the early stages of learning about itself isn’t a good strategy. “It’s just trying to get them a little bit of rhythm together, but with the travel and everything, I don’t have unrealistic expectations of what it is going to look like.”\nOn the women’s side, head coach Mark Kellogg is in a different situation. He’s been through the growing pains and roster construction of an initial season, and entering year two at West Virginia has an excellent core of players around which to continue to build. He does have seven players who have never suited up for the Mountaineers, although two of those, Ashala Moseberry and Zya Nugent, were with the team last year, and his core returnees will allow him to mix and match and do some more experimenting with roster combinations while figuring out where the newcomers will fit in and contribute. If DeVries will be holding classes at the 100 level, Kellogg’s will be in the 300 range or higher.\n“We are excited to have this opportunity, and we’re going to give it everything we’ve got. You want to get a lot of things out of it,” said Kellogg, who has never been on an overseas trip with a team before. “I want to develop some things and see them play in a competitive environment, and see some new rotations. We’ll throw some new things out there. We probably have 10% in of what we will want to run (this year), but that will allow us to function at the rate we want to.”\nAt the core of that are returnees JJ Quinerly, Jordan Harrison, Kyah Watson and Kylee Blacksten, all of whom were integral parts of last year’s team. Add in Danelle Arigbabu and Tirzah Moore, and WVU looks to be more in the reloading, not rebuilding phase. While there’s still a lot of teaching going on, Kellogg can depend on a number of players who know what the offense and defense should look like, making for more teaching chances on the court during the trip.\n“I am excited about where we are today, but it’s July,” said Kellogg, echoing a point DeVries made when assessing the current status of his team, but acknowledging that he has far more depth to work with than he did a year ago, when simply getting 10 healthy players suited up for practice or games was a challenge.\nOn both trips, though, the final scores of the games will be of little importance. With real games still almost four months away, the goals are for progression, even though the two teams are at different places along that path. And, of course, to have some fun.\n“They are a great opportunity for a chance to go see the world, and a chance to spend some time outside of basketball and get a different kind of perspective with each other,” DeVries noted, while Kellogg added, “It’s great bonding, they will learn, there’s great history. We have challenged them to be open-minded about the cultures. This will be a new experience for most of them.”\nSWISHES AND DRIBBLES\nWhile each team expects to be at full strength by the time classes start on campus on Aug. 21, each will be just a bit short of that mark for the overseas jaunt. Men’s guard Joseph Yesufu will make the trip but will not see action as he continues to recover from a hip injury, while Tagaloa-Nelson will be working with the football team in the run-up to the start of preseason practice.\nOn the women’s side, freshman signee Feryal Defne Atli will not make the trip after playing with Turkey’s U20 team in the recently completed Eurobasket Tournament, but will enroll for the start of the fall semester. Guard Ashala Moseberry, sporting a large knee brace during a recent practice, is cleared for action, but is being treated cautiously and might not play in the team’s three games from July 31-Aug 6.\n- — — — -\nWith the increase in allowable practice time with the coaches over the summer, are overseas trips on the verge of being phased out? They could be something of a recruiting inducement, but stacked up against NIL, that aspect may have lessened in importance. And would an upcoming trip be enough to keep a player on the roster who is trying to get a bigger NIL payment elsewhere?\n“It used to be (the overseas trip) was a huge deal, because every four years you get those 10 extra practices, but now with four hours of practice a week, it’s not quite as valuable,” DeVries noted. “It did allow us do a little more in the middle of summer, and extend a few of our practices a little bit.”\nCurrent rules allow teams making overseas trips 10 additional summer practices, but those that don’t can now play more closed scrimmages and two exhibition games in the preseason. Balancing the cost of the out-of-country trips figures to be one of many areas where athletic departments will be examining the cost-benefit analysis in the wake of rapidly rising payment obligations to its players.",
