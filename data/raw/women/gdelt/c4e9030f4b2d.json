We look at each of the six clubs, highlight some key players, and give our thoughts on who will lifting the silverware on the first Saturday in September.\nBathurst Bulldogs\nCoach: Chris Plunkett\n2024 finish: Premiers\nCan they do it again?\nThe three-time premiership winners have a huge target on their back in 2025 while they also head into the season without inspirational leader Peter Fitzsimmons.\nThe club great has hung up the boots, as has star fullback Joe Nash. Those departiures leave a huge hole but, such is the talent factory Bulldogs have developed over the years, there is real belief the team won't lose much at all.\nChris Plunkett has taken on the coaching role alone after sharing it with Dean Oxley previously and he's been impressed by the energy and motivation he's seen during pre-season.\nWhat the coach says\n\"I get the feeling there's something special still there,\" Plunkett said.\n\"We haven't lost too many and we've gained a few more. That comes from three premierships in a row, people want to play for winning teams.\n\"We're missing guys like Peter Fitz, who's the best captain Bulldogs have had in a long time, but there's a next man up policy.\n\"It's just great to see how enthusiastic these guys are. It's easy to turn up and give them the skills and drills they need to get better because they want to get better and they want to win the comp again.\"\nPlayers to watch\nPlunkett was a little tight-lipped about some of the newcomers to Bulldogs but did say there are some new players who could make themselves known to the competition in the coming weeks.\nIn terms of leadership, Hunter Davis will be vital. Taking over from Central West star Fitzsimmons is one of the biggest jobs in the region, but the centre has the experience and talent to lead from the front.\nBrad Glasson is another returning premiership hero. He played in the No. 10 last season but the fullback's jersey is vacant following Nash's departure so a move is possible.\nOur say\nExpect more of the same. The loss of Fitzsimmons can't be spoken about enough, there are few figures who have inspired teammates like him in recent times.\nHowever, Bulldogs has become such a winning machine during the past decade they should be able to overcome that loss. This is a team that scored more than 700 points last season and averaged more than 45 a game so there is talent right across the park and in the lower grades, too.\nIt's clear the motivation is there and there's no reason why this side won't hit the ground running again.\nOrange Emus\nCoach: Nigel Staniforth\n2024 finish: Runners-up\nAnother case of so close yet so far for Emus.\nThey didn't do much wrong in the regular season, seeing off challenges to finish second behind Bathurst Bulldogs for the third year in a row.\nThey even recorded one of the great finals performances, shutting out the Bulldogs 7-0 in the major semi-final.\nBut another heavy grand final defeat had the Orange team wondering what more they could do in the face of a Bathurst side which is becoming one of the best in Central West rugby history.\nWhat the coach says\n\"Everyone's ready. They're over pre-season, which is always the case, but probably more so this year we've had some really high-quality trials and they're ready to rip in and start the season,\" Staniforth said.\n\"I think every year it [the side] looks a little bit different. There are familiar faces, but there'll be one or two new faces in the group this weekend.\n\"They've been working hard trying to get their combinations downpat, so we can start the season on the right foot.\n\"There are some weaknesses they're working on pretty hard. As people will be aware, our scrum's been a big work on over the last few years and it's in really good shape at the moment.\n\"Bathurst has been extremely good over the last three years, so kudos to them, but you've got to do your own thing a little bit.\"\nPlayers to watch\nHamish Sinclair joins from Shute Shield club North Sydney and he's a big pick-up.The lock will add some serious punch to the Emus pack and his experience playing in big finals will come in handy.\nStanifrorth singled out returning Orange local Sam Ridley, who lined up in the 10 jersey during pre-season, as well as Mark Buttenshaw, who has managed to overcome some injury problems to hit the ground running ahead of round 1.\nBreakout star Cory Hooper is back as well with the flanker joining Kyle Hans as vice-captain.\nOur say\nEmus have consistently been the best of the rest and that task becomes harder in 2025 with City breathing down their necks and Dubbo making moves in the player market.\nStandards go a long way, though, and there is always an expectation at Endeavour Oval. You'd be a brave punter to write them off from another grand final appearance.\nForbes Platypi\nCoach: Guy Wilkinson\n2024 finish: Third\nSome clubs dread the word \"rebuild\" but new Platypi coach Guy Wilkinson is embracing it.\nWilkinson has stepped up to take on the first grade role after impressing while leading the Platypi women's side to a rare finals appearance in his first full season at the club last year.\nIt's a changing of the guard for his side as Forbes enters a Blowes Cup season without Mahe Fangupo and the retired duo of Charlie French and Andrew Hubbard.\nA huge amount of experience has been ripped out of the side and Wilkinson is all too aware challenges await this season, but he's keen to see his new-look and youthful side rise to the occasion.\nWhat the coach says\n\"There's some very big holes to fill there,\" Wilkinson said.\n\"We're probably going to have an average age of about 23 or 24. A lot of young guys might be getting a chance before they thought they might have, but with that comes enthusiasm and they're really champing at the bit.\n\"Without a doubt it's a rebuilding year, we're under no illusion in regards to that, but we're a very proud club with a proud history and we just want to add to that.\"\nRegardless of the changes and challenges that await, the coach is implementing his preferred style of rugby.\n\"I'm a fan of having the ball in hand,\" he added.\n\"We don't have too many Springbok-style front-rowers than can bench press 400 pounds, so I don't think there will be too much of a power game.\n\"Hopefully there's some fast, flat, expansive football and a lot more ball in hand and just really tight in defence.\"\nPlayers to watch\nThere's so much change at Forbes we've settled on a few who could decide how this new-look side fares in 2025.\nIf Jack Cole can stay fit he will be a key figure in the centres. He's only young but has had a rotten run with injury.\nThe other two intriguing members of the squad are the French pair of Jules Pinsac and Adrian Angles. Pinsac will likely partner the promising Luke McDean in the halves while Angles will slot into the backline.\nGiven the huge amount of experience and talent the side has lost in the off-season, some exciting international additions could be just what's needed to boost the Platypi in 2025.\nOur view\nIt's going to be tough for the Platypi. Wilkinson admits that, saying it's a rebuild and \"there will be ups and downs\".\nAny side that loses players like Fangupo, French and Hubbard all at once would undoubtedly be weaker and, given the quality of this season's competition, that makes things difficult for Forbes.\nHowever, the Platypi are always competitive, it's always a difficult trip to Pioneer Oval, and Wilkinson's desire for attacking rugby should create some moments of magic. This revamped side will probably cause a surprise here or there, but it will be difficult to be as consistent as the top few contenders.\nOrange City\nCoach: Greg Lee\n2024 finish: Fourth\nThe 2024 season continued the Lions' upward trend in recent years.\nFrom their winless season in 2022 to just missing the finals in 2023, City finally broke through to the top four.\nAlong the way they managed to beat Emus and Bulldogs before ultimately falling short against Forbes in the minor semi-final.\nWhat the coach says\n\"Most clubs stick with a one or two-coach setup per team, but we're shifting the focus to development across the board,\" Lee said.\n\"The squad system allows us to refine skills at every level, so when players make the jump, they're ready.\n\"It's about where a player can go, not just where they are now. If they have the right attitude and put in the work, there's a pathway forward.\n\"The system is working well. Players know it's a clean slate-where they end up depends on their effort and skill. It's great to have coaches highlight players putting in the work. Naturally, I'm watching too, but if multiple coaches notice the same player, that says a lot.\n\"It's shaping up to be an exciting season. We've retained a strong core of players while adding some fresh talent. Sure, we'll miss a few who've moved on, but we've got plenty of good cattle to shake the tree.\n\"If all goes to plan, I'd love nothing more than to see every one of our teams in finals footy come August-September.\"\nPlayers to watch\nLee pointed out new additions Ash Goddard and Gus Smith as ones to keep an eye on.\nDylan Ryan and Frazer Ryder have been around for a few years now and are handy players to have in the backline.\nRyan proved his worth last season with a clutch conversion in the dying minutes to secure an almighty upset for the Lions against Bathurst.\nOur view\nNo more honourable defeats. That has to be City's mantra in 2025.\nThe progress they've made has been positive but they will be sick of almost being in contention.\nThe Lions have recruited well by adding some good depth - signings also include former league players Mitch Leonard and Ryan Banks - and shored up their support staff, which will give them a good shot at being in the mix come finals.\nTop four a must and will want to avoid an away elimination final like 2024.\nCowra Eagles\nCoach: Adam Meiklejohn\n2024 finish: Fifth\nAdam Meiklejohn, welcome to senior coaching. Last year the Eagles great was leading the club's under 12s. This year he's stepped up to the top job but has already had to deal with four season-ending injuries before a competitive match has been played.\nMeiklejohn played more than 400 games for the Eagles but is now tasked with leading a much-changed side up the Blowes ladder. It won't be easy and he knows it given the quality of the competition.\nA talented core group remains and there are some intriguing additions, making the Eagles a bit of an unknown heading into the 2025 campaign.\nWhat the coach says\n\"Us and Forbes, we're happy to be the ones that can run with the others on our day and maybe cause an upset or two,\" Meiklejohn said.\n\"We'll be competitive and that starts this weekend against a pretty quality Orange City side.\"\nCowra has almost always produced tough rugby. The forward pack has led the way and then talented outside backs have been able to thrive off the back of that. Don't expect that Eagles DNA to change this year, but the new coach is eager to keep his rivals guessing a little.\n\"Growing up, Cowra has always played a traditional type game and we'll be trying to stick to that, but add a bit more dimensions to it so we're not a one-tricky pony, so to speak,\" Meiklejohn said.\n\"We've got our core values around our forward pack, set piece and scrum and lineout, which we've had for probably 30 years, and we're not going to jeopardise that by any means.\n\"It's about adding a few other things to hopefully make us a little bit less predictable.\"\nPlayers to watch\nIt will be a lot of the same players leading the way for Cowra this season. Some of the newcomers - especially a trio from the Wagga region - could develop into key figures, but it's a little early for even Meiklejohn to lock them in at this stage.\nDamien Michael will be the man again. A NSW Country representative and hard-working forward, Michael will again inspire those around him and be a handful for defences.\nBlake Tidswell was arguably Cowra's best last season and has been a standout for some time while reliable performers like Cooper Sullivan and Byron Sutherland are also back.\nOur view\nYou can never write off Cowra. They often enter a season as a bit of a mystery but then trot out a few new faces alongside the regulars and stick it to the top teams.\nHowever, the Eagles could be in for another season like 2024. That means a handful of wins, some of those being impressive upsets, but ultimately not at the level required to play finals.\nDubbo Kangaroos\nCoach: Tom Koerstz\n2024 finish: Last\nCould it finally be the year the Roos deliver?\nOne of the biggest underachievers across any sport in the region in recent years, the Roos collected the wooden spoon in 2024. But, things seem different this season.\nThere are a stack of new faces at the club and none are as potentially important as that of Blowes Cup great and representative star Mahe Fangupo. Fangupo has had success almost everywhere he's played so expectations are high he will lead the Roos up the ladder.\nA number of club juniors and former players have also returned home or come back to rugby after some time away so coach Tom Koerstz has the kind of depth many would envy.\nWhat the coach says:\n\"We don't want to be the cellar-dwellers. We really want to shake the comp up and roll on from the success of second and third grade and ride that momentum into first grade,\" Koerstz said.\n\"Then obviously our colts played in a grand final and our women have gone back-to-back so, as a club, the focus is very much trying to get back to that club championships mentality.\n\"That's our goal first and foremost. If we're club champions then, realistically, you're probably going to have five grades in finals.\"\nThere has been a positive and exciting mood around training and much of the work has often been player-driven, which delights the coach and also makes life that little bit easier for him.\n\"Despite where we've finished last season, we've gained players and they've seen what we're trying to achieve, which is really exciting to see,\" Koerstz said.\n\"Often you have a year where you finish at the bottom and you might lose some fellas but I think all the fellas see we're rebuilding and they want to be part of it.\"\nPlayers to watch\nMahe Fangupo, obviously. He's a veteran of the game in these parts now but he's still one of the very best organisers around.\nThe coach is hopeful this youthful Roos side can inject some fresh excitement into Fangupo, as well. The former Forbes star will likely play alongside Josh Gemmell or Jack Jones in the halves..\nNewcomer and young speedster Emerson Fittler could excite on the wing while one returning player already making an impact is captain Mitch Smith. A young leader, Smith is making his presence felt at training while also creating a positive atmosphere for his clubmates.\nOur say\nWe've been fooled so many times by the Roos during the last decade where they promised plenty and delivered basically nothing. But things seem different this time. It really feels like the first grade side is primed to launch an assault on the premiership.\nWith Koerstz purely focused on training after retiring due to a string of head knocks, Fangupo onboard, players like Calub Cook and Sam Knaggs back at the club alongside established regulars like Tim Beach, there is a lot to like.\nEverything points to the Roos being one of the top teams in 2025.\nPredicted ladder\n1 Bathurst Bulldogs\n2 Orange City\n3 Dubbo Kangaroos\n4 Orange Emus\n5 Cowra Eagles\n6 Forbes Platypi",
