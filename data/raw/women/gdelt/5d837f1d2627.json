The Lionesses made it 30 games unbeaten in front of 83,142 supporters and looked to have won it in normal time thanks to Ella Toone's first half goal.\nBut Andressa Alves struck in the 93rd minute after Mary Earps spilled a cross to send the game to a penalty shootout and spark wild celebrations amongst the Brazilian fans.\nBrazil, had looked low on confidence in the first 45 minutes, after only winning once at the SheBelieves Cup in February, barely getting out of their own half. But the South American champions were much improved after the break and went close through both midfielder Kerolin and Geyse, who forced an excellent reaction stop from Mary Earps. At the other end Georgia Stanway nearly put the game out of sight, only for Leticia Izidoro to make a smart stop.\nREAD MORE: Katie McCabe steals show for Arsenal after Kim Kardashian recognition and injury scareREAD MORE: Leah Williamson can't wait to face \"warrior\" Arsenal team-mate as Lionesses take on BrazilThe win marks England's first global trophy and their fourth under Wiegman's stewardship joining two Arnold Clark Cups and the European Championship from last summer in the trophy cabinet.\nHere are the big talking points from a dramatic night at Wembley.\nLionesses refuse to lose winning feeling despite penalty shootout\nSarina Wiegman came into this game having yet to taste defeat as England manager. And back at the scene of their greatest triumph, the Lionesses once again secured silverware.\nThis was a far tougher test than the ones they faced at the Arnold Clark Cup, but Wiegman's team rose to the challenge, particularly in the opening 20 minutes where they started with real pace and purpose. With James, Hemp and Russo all willing to come short and run at the Brazilian back five, the Lionesses wrestled control of the contest early on.\nAlthough Brazil fought back after the break and sent the game to a dramatic penalty shootout with Alves' goal, England remained calm. Stanway, Rachel Daly, Alex Greenwood and Kelly all struck superb penalties, while Rafaelle crucially hit the bar for Brazil. It may not have been pretty but England got over the line in a big match, again.\nFor all the talk of experimenting with tactics and personnel before the World Cup - as Wiegman said in her press conference - England are a team that \"play to win.\"\nElla Toone’s impact as a number ten\nWith Fran Kirby still out injured, tonight was a big chance for Man Utd No.7 Ella Toone to stake a big claim for a starting XI place. She wasn't one of the standout performers from the Arnold Clark Cup but rewarded Wiegman's faith with her superb finish in the 22nd minute.\nThe finish itself was simple enough, but Toone had intelligently received the ball on the half-turn during a flowing team move that saw England switch the play from left to right. Georgia Stanway then released the onrushing Lucy Bronze with the perfect pass, with the Barcelona defender flying into the box at breakneck speed.\nToone evaded yellow shirts to be perfectly placed and fire past Leticia Izidoro. A goal here or there won't define who starts in England's first game at the World Cup finals, but this felt like a big moment for the United star. Another big performance against Australia could see her unseat Kirby in pole position to be England's number ten.\nAlex Greenwood excels during Millie Bright's absence\nWith Chelsea's Millie Bright dropping out of the squad due to injury, Alex Greenwood was chosen to partner captain Leah Williamson in the heart of defence. Jess Carter came in for Greenwood at left-back, with Rachel Daly presumably seen as a forward by Wiegman, for now at least.\nA Lionesses backline without Bright, may not look as physically imposing, but Greenwood was excellent. The Man City stopper didn't put a foot wrong - up against Brazil's liveliest two players in Geyse and Bia Zaneratto.\nEven when England were more under the cosh in the second half, she never looked flustered or out of position, save for one minor hiccup where she was caught on the ball, only for Williamson to bail her out. On this evidence regardless of where she is deployed across the back four, Greenwood is becoming a certain starter.\nBrazil fail to show World Cup credentials despite draw\nThe South American champions may have been missing some of their big hitters with Marta, Debinha and Angelina all out. But they came to make things as difficult as possible for England.\nLining-up in a deep lying 5-3-2 with wing-backs Tamires and Antonia tucking in, Pia Sundhage clearly wanted to disrupt England's flow from the off, particularly down the right channel. It wasn't the free-flowing samba football that some of the crowd perhaps expected.\nSundhage's side were disciplined and, to be fair, were up against one of the best sides in the world. But they failed to stamp their authority in the first half.\nAfter the break the Selecao began to throw more bodies forward and threaten Mary Earps' goal.\nEarps redeemed in shootout after rare error\nAfter dominating the first half, England found themselves on the back foot for much of the second period. Brazil started to pin the Lionesses back and would have got level just before the hour had it not been for Mary Earps.\nThe England No.1 made some good stops throughout the second half, but a rare error in injury time gave Brazil the chance to level. Earps, normally flawless, spilled a desperate low cross and Alves smashed home from close range.\nThe goal was harsh on England who had been the better side, but credit was due to Brazil for staying in the contest. But Earps once again came up big for the Lionesses in the penalty shootout, making a superb stop to deny Tamires, which would have put Brazil 2-1 up.\nWiegman's subs show strength in depth\nEngland boss Wiegman held off until the 73rd minute to introduce Chloe Kelly and Rachel Daly. Daly was given a chance after Alessia Russo ran herself into the ground as the centre forward.\nYou'd be hard placed to find a bench of an international team with more depth than England. The likes of Jordan Nobbs, Jess Park and Maya Le Tissier remained unused, while Millie Bright and Beth Mead weren't part of this squad.\nIf England can avoid further serious injuries, they will go the World Cup finals with arguably the strongest squad on the planet.\nNEW!
