  "body_text": "RANKED: The 6 best players of WSL Gameweek 3\n- The third weekend of the 2024/25 WSL is complete\n- Tottenham and Aston Villa were at the brunt of controversial decisions\n- Crystal Palace celebrated their first points since promotion\nThe 2024/25 Barclays Women's Super League is very much heating up after a third weekend of action saw clubs begin to establish themselves in the table.\nWe were treated to a drama-filled first game as Aston Villa took on Brighton & Hove Albion at the Broadfield Stadium. A controversial penalty decision in the second half saw Villa's Paula Tomas given a red card, helping the Seagulls clinch a 4-2 victory.\nIn north London, controversy persisted. Tottenham ended up losing 3-2 to Liverpool after the Reds were given a penalty in the 95th minute in what's since been described as a questionable decision.\nElsewhere, Crystal Palace secured their first points of the season with a 2-0 win over Leicester at home. Manchester City's 2-0 victory over West Ham saw them move to the top of the table, with one point now separating them and Chelsea.\nHowever, the Blues are left trailing after their match against Manchester United was postponed due to their Women's Champions League fixture with Real Madrid.\nArsenal's clash with Everton at the Emirates failed to excite, ending in a 0-0 draw with both teams walking away with a point.\nHere are the best six players of the Women's Super League from the weekend - ranked, as always.\n6. Lauren Hemp (Manchester City)\nLauren Hemp's goal was instrumental in helping put Man City ahead in their game against West Ham.\nThe 24-year-old didn't just add to the scoresheet, but she also added to history in the process. Her goal saw her become the youngest player ever to score 50 goals in the WSL.\nAlthough the Cityzens clinched a victory over the Hammers, it wasn't necessarily their most dominant performance. However, Hemp remained a reliable pair of hands throughout the 90 minutes upfront, contributing to six overall shots on target.\nWith a few international friendlies coming up, her performance so far in the 2024/25 campaign will no doubt have caught the eye of England manager Sarina Wiegman.\n5. Clare Hunt (Tottenham)\nHunt was an exciting signing for Tottenham in the summer, having spent time at top-flight French club PSG.\nSince arriving, she's quickly become an essential addition for Spurs' backline. Despite conceding three goals at the weekend against Liverpool, Hunt's consistency has to be acknowledged.\nNot only is she able to dominate in her own half, the 25-year-old is able to prove problematic on the attack too.\nHunt should also be recognised for preventing Liverpool's breakout star Olivia Smith from finding space and successfully restricting her during threatening moments.\nTottenham put up a good fight, but on this occasion a controversial decision saw them lose three points.\n4. Lexi Potter (Crystal Palace)\nLexi Potter proved exactly why there is so much excitement surrounding her against Leicester. The midfielder was key in helping Palace clinch their first points since promotion into the WSL, following two consecutive losses at Tottenham and Chelsea.\nPotter commanded in midfield against Leicester with confidence, looking for opportunities to play the ball into two-time goalscorer Annabel Blanchard.\nShe showed real promise and is certainly one to keep an eye on as the season progresses.\n3. Marie Hobinger (Liverpool)\nHobinger got her name on the scoresheet twice against Tottenham. The first was a dazzling free kick from outside the box and the second a penalty to help Liverpool end the game with a 3-2 win.\nHer efforts during the 90 minutes saw her rightly named Player of the Match. The 23-year-old played a crucial role in helping Liverpool secure their first win of the season, after two draws and one loss.\nTheir gritty performance will no doubt be the lift that Matt Beard's team need to begin building on their success from last season.\n2. Nikita Parris (Brighton & Hove Albion)\nNikita Parris opened her goalscoring account at Brighton over the weekend following her move to the club from Manchester United over the summer. The forward's equaliser was essential in giving the Seagulls a chance against Villa after going 1-0 down after a goal from Rachel Daly.\nNot only did she score a goal, but Parris' dominant presence on the pitch in both rallying her teammates and enacting a confidence to win was hugely noticeable.\nDespite a controversial red card decision against Villa, Brighton's victory now means they've won three of their four games under new manager Dario Vidosic.\n1. Courtney Brosnan (Everton)\nGoalkeeper Courtney Brosnan's performance has seen her ranked as our best player from across the weekend.\nShe was instrumental in helping Everton keep a clean sheet against Arsenal at the Emirates. Brosnan's efforts also even saw her named Player of the Match at the final whistle.\nThe Republic of Ireland international came up against an attacking frontline, but managed to help Everton secure a point from a 0-0 draw, stopping shots from the likes of Kim Little, Mariona Caldentey and Alessia Russo.\nThe 28-year-old helped keep her team controlled and calm during a difficult 90 minutes.\nWSL gameweek 3 results\n- Brighton & Hove Albion 4-2 Aston Villa\n- Manchester City 2-0 West Ham United\n- Arsenal 0-0 Everton\n- Tottenham 2-3 Liverpool\n- Leicester City 0-0 Crystal Palace",
