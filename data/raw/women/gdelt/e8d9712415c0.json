I know my back has problems, but I really want to try and I really want to show that I'm improving just a little bit.\"'\nKaren has lived with Scheuermann's disease, which causes curvature at the top of the spine, since childhood.\n'I suffered with it the whole of my football career but I never made it a thing – particularly with the dancing – because I always knew I could get on the pitch,' she recently explained to The Telegraph.\nDuring week eight of the competition, Karen touched on her spine condition, Scheuermann's disease, and how it has affected her dancing\nThe Strictly star played as a winger and midfielder during her professional football career - during which she made 144 appearances for England\n'I always knew I’d find a way. I just won’t be able to do certain things. Sometimes it was disheartening when I played and it did impact my career, but I just got on with it.\n'I just want to show that I might not be the perfect dancer, I will not have the perfect posture, but I’ll certainly give it my best.'\nKaren spent hours throughout her career being treated for the disease. A women’s sport and health performance specialist, Eva Woods, kept her ticking along.\nBut that's not the only battle Karen has had to face.\nSleeping pill addiction\nAfter picking up a knee injury while playing for the Chicago Red Stars, towards the start of her career, Karen sank into depression and began self-harming before becoming addicted to sleeping pills\nAfter picking up a knee injury while playing for the Chicago Red Stars, towards the start of her career, Karen sank into depression and began self-harming before becoming addicted to sleeping pills.\n'I was in a pretty bad way. I think that has been the hardest thing I’ve ever had to overcome,' she told The Guardian.\nManager Emma Hayes, who she had also had at Arsenal, told her to return to England for her own good. Birmingham City came calling.\n'I came back purely to… save my life, pretty much,' she added. 'They were, like, we know you’re not in a good place, but we will do our best to take care of you.\n'My friends, people around me dragged me through and I owed it to them to try and fight, and it’s an amazing feeling when you can get through that. It’s hard to talk about it, and I couldn’t have done it without people [around me].'\nKaren later told the BBC: 'I've done some bad things to myself, that was probably the lowest point. But I'm here.\n'We just want to inspire people to get through dark places and come through it, because you can.'\nPunditry abuse\nKaren, who retired as a footballer in 2019 and became a pundit, received horrific abuse from online trolls - which later led her to having suicidal thoughts (pictured with Laura Woods)\nKaren, who retired as a footballer in 2019 and became a pundit, received horrific abuse from online trolls - which later led her to having suicidal thoughts.\nShe was already used to abuse, having had one troll wish 'cancer, leukaemia and rape' on her while she was a player, but the attacks leapt up a notch when she was commentating.\nIn 2020, Karen was bombarded with sexist and abusive messages and eventually deleted her social media. In 2021, she opened up about how the abuse caused her to have suicidal thoughts.\nKaren said she hasn't been able to get over that time in her life, adding: 'It floored me as a human, completely floored me.'\nShe said that she is using Strictly to help 'rebuild confidence' after being 'crushed' by the sexist abuse she faced as a pundit.\nOpening up to Women's Health UK on the Just As Well podcast about getting back to herself after the 'negative' backlash she had to endure for simply doing her job.\nKaren explained: 'I think I had it quite bad about four years ago, that was very, very challenging. But since then, whether you like it or not, you have to build resilience.\n'And I think for me, my attitude - put my athlete hat on - is to be the best version of myself. Work as hard as I can, be a great team player, and actually what we learned in football was never to impress your manager, impress your teammates.\n'So for me, if I'm next to someone like a Roy Keane or an Ian Wright, or whoever it might be, if they're happy with me and they know I worked hard, they know I've done my research, they know I've done my prep, then that's all that matters to me…\n'The rest, I can't control what people think about me. I genuinely can't. I've had to just go with that mindset.\n'But Jesus Christ, it has knocked my confidence…it's why I wanted to do Strictly as well to rebuild my confidence again because the negativity has crushed me.'",
