And his grumpy disposition has sparked a thousand memes.\nBen Affleck seems to be the most miserable man in Hollywood as he is often seen looking downcast when out in Los Angeles and appearing irritated at red carpet events. Seen in a new episode of Hart To Heart\nHe seems especially sad now that his marriage to Jennifer Lopez is reportedly on the rocks. Seen in May 2023\nWhile talking to Kevin Hart for an episode from season four of his show Hart To Heart, the Oscar-winning actor addressed his grumpiness.\nThe star said Affleck also addresses his resting grumpy face and his explanation is hard to believe as the actor - who has been in front of cameras for three decades - declares he is 'shy.'\nBen said: 'I'm also a little bit shy. I don't like a lot of attention. This is why people see me and they're like, \"Why is this dude always mad?\" Because someone had their camera sticking in my face, and I'm like, \"OK, here we go.\"'\n'You have resting b***h face,' Hart joked.\n'B****h? Now,' Affleck responded as he pretended to be mad.\n'I have resting hard face. People are projecting onto me something that I don't feel about myself at all.'\nHart loses points for not asking Ben why he continues to be in showbusiness if he doesn't like attention.\nBen, who also directs, has no plans to stop acting: his next film is The Accountant 2.\nAffleck is known for his brooding leading roles - pictured in 1997's Good Will Hunting - which bagged him his first Oscar\nBut this Hollywood actor who came to fame over 30 years ago with 1992's School Ties seems to have it all. Affleck, 51, has Oscars, money and looks; seen in May\nWhile talking to Kevin Hart for an episode from season four of his show Hart To Heart , the Oscar-winning actor addressed the 'Sad Affleck' memes - Seen with JLo in 2022\nThe couple seemed happier 20 years ago, right, than they did earlier this year, left\nThis comes after a source told DailyMail.com the main reason J.Lo is upset with her husband is because he was always 'grumpy and negative' like Oscar The Grouch from Sesame Street.\n'If people could see what she has really gone through they would be easier on her,' said the source.\n'Ben is a great guy but he can be grumpy and a downer.\n'I think the world saw that in photos like when they were at the Grammys last year; he wouldn't smile. If they saw how it really was, they would not attack her,' said the friend of Jennifer.\n'He chain smokes and cusses and seems irritated a lot of the time. Great director and actor, but not a lot of laughs with him, you know?' said the source. 'He is a wonderful father though.'\nBen said: 'I'm also a little bit shy. I don't like a lot of attention. This is why people see me and they're like, \"Why is this dude always mad?; in February 2023\nLooking miserable with ex-wife Jennifer Garner in LA on June 11 - the pair were wed from 2005-2018 and share three children\nBen looked grumpy at the 81st Golden Globe Awards in January 7 with Matt Damon\nAnd Ben appeared sad in March with JLo and son Samuel at the Laker game in LA\nThe star has dated a host of famous beauties - including Deep Water co-star Ana De Armas from 2020-2021 (pictured 2020)\nHe romanced Saturday Night Life producer Lindsay Shookus from 2017-2019 (pictured 2018)\nThe same year he went to rehab, he had a brief fling with Playboy model Shauna Sexton - who at 23 was 20 years his junior\nLopez plans on pushing on.\n'She is really not used to this kind of bad feedback, but she will get over it. She will march on,' said the pal.\n'Jennifer is a very smart and strong woman and she will bounce back, she always does!'\nAnd as far as how Jennifer and Ben are getting along these days, the insider said they are being 'cordial' with each other.\nSo what happened to the once jovial Ben who used to smile at fans and make out with Jennifer in public?\nThe source points to the pressure in Ben's career.\n'He is now filming Accounting 2 and the hours are really long, he is working hard at it and it's a lot to juggle with marriage and kids,' said the source. 'So sometimes he is not in the best mood.'\nIn 2022, Ben reflected on his sad meme from the now-iconic video of him sadly staring off into space during a press junket interview for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\nAffleck admitted that though he thought the memes sparked by the video were funny, he is now more concerned about the affects it had on his children.\nThe 8-year-old video - featuring a melancholy soundtrack - shows Affleck alongside co-star Henry Cavill as they are told that the movie is getting mixed reviews.\nHe dated Gwyneth Paltrow from 1997-2000 (pictured 1999)\nThe star courted worldwide attention when he groped then fiancee J-Lo's backside in her Jenny From The Block video in 2002\nAffleck talked in 2022 about the now-iconic video of him sadly staring off into space during a press junket interview for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\nThe video shows Affleck alongside co-star Henry Cavill as they are told that the movie is getting mixed reviews\nAnd while Cavill launches into a professional response, Affleck turns his gaze down with a look of utter dismay.\nThe video - which went viral overnight - was quickly turned into a parody, as YouTuber Sabconth added in a collage of negative headlines from review articles, as well as Simon and Garfunkel's song The Sound of Silence.\nThe actor opened up about the meme and his public perception to the Los Angeles Times, saying, 'I got to a place where [the public perception] was so different from who I am that I just stopped reading and stopped caring.'\nHe went on to say he was concerned about his kids being affected by it. 'But then, as my kids got older and started seeing the internet themselves, that’s the difficult part. Even the “Sad Affleck” meme — that was funny to me. I mean, there’s nobody who hasn’t felt that way at a junket,' he stated.\n'But then my kids see it and I think, “Oh, are they going to think their dad is fundamentally sad or they have to worry about me?” That’s really tough,' the star added.\nThere have been hundreds of memes dedicated to Ben's sour face over the years\nThe actor also reflected on his early years and how his public image didn't match his private persona.\n'I think when I was young, people saw me as somebody who had too much or was successful too easily or looked like some kind of cavalier, insincere, callow frat guy,' he said.\n'That was nothing like how I felt. I felt like this sort of insecure, anxious, overly verbal kid from Boston who had tried to break into this business and was dealing with his own stuff. But there is an interesting thing about how we come off versus who we are,' he revealed.\nThe star's first taste of moviemaking was at age seven in the independent film, The Dark End of the Street (1981), directed by a family friend.\nNext he starred in the PBS children's series The Voyage of the Mimi (1984) and The Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988).\nAs a teen, he appeared in the ABC after school special Wanted: A Perfect Man (1986), the television film Hands of a Stranger (1987).
