  "body_text": "Anita Asante and Ellen White have been inducted into the Women's Super League Hall of Fame, in recognition of their incredible contributions to the game.\nThe WSL Hall of Fame was launched in 2021 for the league 10th anniversary's season. Asante and White join fellow club legends Kelly Smith, Rachel Yankey, Karen Carney, Katie Chapman and Fara Williams in receiving the honour.\nAsante began her footballing career in north London, first joining as a junior in the late 1990s and going on to rack up 160 appearances and 12 major trophies as a first-team player. These accolades include a UEFA Women's Cup, five league titles, four FA Cups and two League Cups.\nThe defender hung up her boots last season at Aston Villa and received a guard of honour in her final game at Meadow Park.\nEllen White, meanwhile, made a total of 72 appearances as a Gunner between 2010 to 2013. The prolific England striker scored 39 times during her three seasons at the club, helping us win the inaugural WSL title in 2011. White added another WSL trophy a season later, alongside two FA Cups and two League Cups.\nThe pair were inducted alongside Lionesses legend Jill Scott at a special event at the National Football Museum.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
