  "body_text": "How do Chelsea replace the irreplaceable? And, no, we’re not talking about outgoing manager Emma Hayes. They now have a more immediate problem after striker Sam Kerr was ruled out for the rest of the season with an anterior cruciate knee ligament (ACL) injury.\nHayes, who will depart for the USWNT job in the summer, and her team are fighting for silverware on four fronts — WSL, FA Cup, Continental Tyres Cup and the Champions League (UWCL) — but must do so without the Kerr, 30, after she was injured on Chelsea’s warm weather training camp in Morocco.\nGO DEEPER\nFull Time: The big questions around Emma Hayes heading to USWNT\nFor Chelsea and Hayes, who is keen to end her trophy-laden reign with a first UWCL title, it is a hammer blow — one they have become used to.\nAdvertisement\nIn recent seasons, Chelsea have been forced to adapt to the long-term injuries of players like Millie Bright, Fran Kirby and Pernille Harder. Arguably, though, Kerr, who could have played her last game for Chelsea as she is out of contract in the summer, is closer to being irreplaceable than any of them.\nThe Australia striker has been a key goalscorer for Chelsea in terms of volume and importance. In her three full seasons at the club, she had scored 31, 29 and 29 goals across all competitions and was on nine for this season. Her reputation is far beyond goals, it’s her talent, experience and reputation that make her distinctive among world football. Chelsea will have to make use of their whole squad if they are to succeed without her.\nIn Kerr’s position, Chelsea will likely turn to USWNT striker Mia Fishel. Known as ‘Big Fish’, the 22-year-old signed from Tigres (who play in the top Mexican league) in the summer for a reported $250,000 transfer fee as a back-up for Kerr.\nShe was prolific in Mexico, scoring 38 goals in 48 appearances, but has played 321 minutes for Chelsea, scoring once in her debut against Tottenham Hotspur in the season opener at Stamford Bridge.\nHer early performances have shown a player who is talented but raw. Her hold-up play has been strong and she has formed a good relationship with Lauren James but, understandably, she is nowhere near Kerr’s level.\nAnother option Chelsea have to lead the line is another summer signing in Catarina Macario. The 24-year-old has yet to feature for the WSL champions due to recovering from an ACL injury suffered in June 2022.\nShe has been pictured in training for Chelsea in Morocco and is a more experienced option than Fishel, having helped Lyon win the Champions League in 2021-22.\nMacario only has 44 professional career appearances (compared to Fishel’s 72) and is recovering from an injury that has kept her away from the pitch for 18 months. The last thing Chelsea will want is to rush her.\nAdvertisement\nThe reality is that it is individuals such as Guro Reiten and Fran Kirby who Chelsea will be looking to.\nGO DEEPER\nReiten signs new deal at Chelsea\nNeither have yet burst into life in this campaign. Reiten was Chelsea’s best player in 2022-23 but missed two months with an ankle ligament injury, only returning in December. Kirby is having her minutes heavily managed after recovering from a knee operation last season. Both have shown themselves able to eclipse Kerr’s importance on the pitch but it will be a different task to do it consistently.\nJames should also see this as an opportunity to shoulder greater responsibility. Her group-stage performances for England at the World Cup showed how she is able to make games bend to her will. With nine goal contributions in 13 appearances for Chelsea this season, she is making her presence felt there too.\nQuestions will be asked as to how the 22-year-old will face the increased pressure in Kerr’s absence and she will need to show exemplary levels of maturity if she is to help lead Chelsea’s attacking line.\nGO DEEPER\nHayes: Chelsea's James subject of 'racial profiling'\nThe key to replacing Kerr may be to do exactly the opposite. There is a need to find a new path that empowers those who will be playing, rather than encouraging them to step into her shoes.\nBeyond the goals, Chelsea will deeply miss Kerr’s leadership. In Bright’s absence, she has taken the armband in recent weeks and it is still unclear when Bright may return. With long-serving captain Magda Eriksson departing at the end of last season for Bayern Munich, Chelsea will be looking to players such as 34-year-old Norway international Maren Mjelde and Scotland international 25-year-old Erin Cuthbert.\nAcross the pond, the Australia women’s national team and manager Tony Gustavsson are facing up to the stark reality of an Olympic campaign without their captain. Kerr’s calf injury at the World Cup hung over the team almost like an incentive: push on so she gets her chance.\nThe most bittersweet outcome of the situation is that we have now seen the last Chelsea game Sam Kerr played under Hayes.\nAdvertisement\nWithout knowing it, the goal Kerr scored against BK Hacken in the UWCL group-stage game before Christmas was her last contribution to Hayes’ Chelsea side.\nIt summed up perfectly why she has been so deadly in its deceptive simplicity, bouncing around on her toes almost imperceptibly in the six-yard box before taking a small step backwards to open up the space between her and the defender. The finish — high and into the sliver of net not covered by the goalkeeper — looked as easy as an open goal.\nIn the year ahead, Chelsea will find other heroes in pivotal moments and it would be rash to write them off when it comes to success without Kerr. But the team she returns to — if indeed she does return — will feel very different from the one she left.\nFor a team that have so long controlled the controllables, Chelsea are now heading into the unknown.\nGO DEEPER\nAre WSL and Premier League clubs doing enough to support players' mental health?\n(Top photo: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images)",
