  "body_text": "US envoy Tom Barrack has said Israel must honour its commitments under a ceasefire that ended its war with Hezbollah after the Lebanese government formally approved the disarmament of the group.\nSpeaking after he met President Joseph Aoun in Beirut, Mr Barrack said: “I think the Lebanese government has done their part. They’ve taken the first step. Now what we need is Israel to comply with that equal handshake.\"\nMr Barrack said Washington was \"in the process of now discussing with Israel what their position is\". He predicted that \"in the next few weeks you're going to see progress on all sides\".\nThe envoy added that bringing all arms under state control is a “decision that belongs to the Lebanese state” in a response to Hezbollah and Iranian officials who said the move was part of a US-Israeli plan.\nMr Barrack emphasised that the delegation carried no threats regarding the disarmament of Hezbollah.\n“There is co-operation from all sides,\" he said. \"We are not here to intimidate anyone. The positive outcomes will benefit Hezbollah, Lebanon and Israel alike. Our focus is on future prosperity, not fear.”\nMr Aoun told the US envoy that what was now needed was \"for the other parties to commit to respecting the content\" of the US proposals.\nIt comes less than two weeks after the Lebanese government approved the objectives of an American proposal to disarm Iran-backed Hezbollah in a historic but controversial move.\nThere are strong fears that Israel will escalate its attacks on Lebanon and expand its occupation in the south of the country further if progress is not made on disarming Hezbollah.\nMr Barrack was joined by Morgan Ortagus, the US deputy special envoy to the Middle East. At the start of President Donald Trump's administration, Ms Ortagus initially led US efforts on Lebanon. The file was then handled by Mr Barrack.\nMs Ortagus and Mr Barrack, who is also the US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, arrived in Beirut on Sunday night.\nLater he met parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah, and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam. Mr Salam demanded the US put pressure on Israel to cease its bombing campaign on Lebanon, withdraw from the points of Lebanese territory it occupies and release the Lebanese prisoners it holds.\nHe said the Lebanese army required a financial injection and increase in equipment. Mr Aoun has said the army needs $1 billion a year from international donors for the next 10 years to help carry out its tasks.\n“Ambassador Barrack’s focus is on fulfilling the President’s goals. President Trump is committed to achieving peace and Lebanon’s stability is key to regional security and prosperity,” a US State Department official said late on Sunday.\nThe US officials will hold talks with Lebanese leaders amid fears that Israel will continue to escalate its daily attacks on Lebanon if there is a lack of progress in the push to disarm Hezbollah.\nThe US proposal was approved at the end of a heated cabinet session less than two weeks ago, with Shiite ministers storming out before it ended. The landmark disarmament move was also heavily criticised by Hezbollah, its supporters and Iran.\nHezbollah leader Naim Qassem has warned that there will be “no life” for Lebanon if authorities confront the group. He accused the government of effectively handing the country over to Israel by pushing for disarmament and giving in to US demands.\nMr Qassem said Hezbollah and the Amal Movement, its Shiite ally, decided to delay street protests against the US-backed disarmament plan because they believe there is room for dialogue with the Lebanese government. But he warned that demonstrations could reach the US embassy in Lebanon.\nBut critics of Hezbollah said a vital disarmament timetable had been decided, giving the army until August 31 to present a plan to bring all weapons under state control by the end of the year.\nThe visit by the US envoys comes days after Ali Larijani, head of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, travelled to Lebanon for meetings with the country's leaders.\nLebanese President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam expressed their deep dissatisfaction to Mr Larijani over criticism from Tehran about plans to disarm Hezbollah, in a powerful rebuke of the group's main backer. Both leaders stated that they reject Iranian interference in Lebanese affairs.\nMr Aoun spoke to Saudi channels over the weekend, reiterating the stance taken towards Mr Larijani and Tehran.\nSaudi Arabia was previously a major financial supporter of Lebanon but stepped back amid the growing influence of Hezbollah and Iran in the country. Saudi Arabia is becoming more involved again. Major international donors have said aid and other support depend on Hezbollah's disarmament and economic reform.\nHezbollah was once the region's most powerful non-state armed group but its power has diminished after it lost its senior leadership and much of its arsenal during the war with Israel last year.\nDespite a fragile ceasefire with Israel being in place since November, Israeli attacks on Lebanon have continued. Israeli army chief, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, visited troops in southern Lebanon last week and boasted about breaching the truce about 600 times.\nThe US proposals would also require Israel to withdraw from Lebanese territory and end its daily bombings of the country.",
