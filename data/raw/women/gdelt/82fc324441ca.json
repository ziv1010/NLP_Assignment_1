  "body_text": "Rooney: CU Buffs 3 extra points (Dec. 9, 2024)\nBuffZone writer Pat Rooney discusses three topics on CU Buffs athletics as the football team starts preparations for the Alamo Bowl while the end-of-semester slowdown begins for both basketball teams.\nGoin’ bowling\nThe expected became official on Sunday, as the Buffaloes accepted an invitation to face BYU in the Alamo Bowl.\nIt’s been said repeatedly but deserves another round: What the Buffs and head coach Deion Sanders have been able to accomplish just two years removed from a miserable 1-11 season is nothing short of remarkable.\nIt also was said in this corner and elsewhere that Sanders’ approach to razing and then rebuilding the roster largely through the transfer portal was new territory in college football. At the advent of the transfer portal era in college football, it was an unprecedented experiment. And it was a resounding success.\nCertainly the contributions of CU’s young, prep recruits — Jordan Seaton, Micah Welch, Drelon Miller, Cash Cleveland and Hank Zilinskas, among others — shouldn’t be overlooked. But Sanders’ ability to wipe the slate clean from a 1-11 roster to oversee an entirely different group of Buffs into the Alamo Bowl was an amazing transformation.\nThe Buffs aren’t the only program that has followed that blueprint to success. Arizona State springs to mind. And the combination of Sanders’ magnetic persona as a recruiter and the CU program’s nowhere-to-go-but-up status when he took over will be difficult to replicate in other situations. Still, watching the Buffs (and ASU, too) go from the doldrums to the brink of College Football Playoff contention (or, in ASU’s case, in the CFP field) will spark hopes of a quick turnaround for every struggling program in the nation.\nOne last ride\nKudos to Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter for opting to play in the Alamo Bowl.\nAs most college football fans know by now, that’s no longer the trend in major college football. Major NFL prospects, especially likely top-10 picks like Shedeur and Hunter, typically opt out of the glorified exhibitions that are bowl games to protect the big contracts in their near future. Former Broncos tight end Jake Butt is the poster boy for the injury risk involved in playing an ultimately meaningless bowl game, as he tore his ACL while playing for Michigan in the Orange Bowl following the 2016 season. He was just months away from being one of the top tight end prospects in the 2017 draft.\nButt slipped to the fifth round, didn’t play in what should’ve been his rookie season, and ultimately only played in eight games over two seasons before his playing career ended.\nThere’s not a “right” or “wrong” angle to the debate. Athletic departments and bowl games have grown fat on the under-compensated skills of student-athletes for generations. The athletes growing wise to protect their own significant interests is fair game.\nBut, given the season the Buffs have had, and even coach Sanders’ admission it would be a vastly different Buffs team on display without Shedeur and Hunter, it is refreshing to see the pair opt for one last run with the Buffs.\nDecember lull\nAfter running past state rival Colorado State on Saturday, the CU men’s basketball team hits a lull in its schedule, with only two more nonconference games over a 22-day span. It’s a similar spell for the CU women, who, after hosting the DU Pioneers on Tuesday night will play just one game over the next three weeks (although for the women, that lone game is the Big 12 opener at home against West Virginia on Dec. 21).\nWhile the calendar slows, both teams will be challenged to maintain the momentum gathered in recent weeks. Both squads are playing markedly better basketball than in the season’s opening weeks last month, and maintaining that momentum will be key to their fortunes entering Big 12 play.\n“We’re getting better,” CU men’s coach Tad Boyle said after the rivalry win against CSU. “But we’ve got two more games before it gets real.”",
