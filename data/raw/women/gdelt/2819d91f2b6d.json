And, as we’ve become accustomed to hearing for the past few months, it ain’t great.\nWhile the NCAA Softball world circles around the coming WCWS, Larissa Anderson must be scratching her head as to what she’ll do with the team next year. Because Sunday saw something of an exodus of big names from the Tigers roster:\nAnd if that wasn’t enough, Sports Illustrated also reports that Jordyn Thurman is on her way out. According to our staff, they won’t be the last.\nLook, we don’t have to be totally ungenerous to Coach Anderson here. There could be a few, more logical explanations at play before we reach, “The players hated the coach, and she’s captaining a sinking ship.” Sometimes when a program hits a stale point, the coach sees an opportunity to reset the roster and staff a little bit. In the age of NIL, your best players are going to get offers from schools that prioritize softball a bit more. And while Taylor Pannell is a local legend, maybe you don’t try to sway her away from making a move in her final college year. Get some new faces in the room, and maybe the Tigers can have a fresh culture for next year’s bounceback.\nIt’s also totally understandable that these specific players are entering the portal when they are. Jordyn Thurman has her entire NCAA career ahead of her and didn’t play as a freshman. Maybe she didn’t see a path forward and wanted to try her luck elsewhere. Madison Walker just had a breakout year and wants to get a spot on one of the best teams in the country, which Mizzou isn’t right now. And maybe Taylor Pannell wants to spend her final year of ball at a place where she’s near-guaranteed a trip to the WCWS... again, which Mizzou isn’t right now. All of those are perfectly understandable explanations to Sunday’s trio of exits.\n...\nBUT!\nIt hurts to have one of the worst years in recent program history — seemingly out of nowhere, it should be noted — and then almost immediately lose a few of the players that stopped things from getting even worse. Regardless of their reason for leaving, it’s a sour note for fans after an unyielding sour season. We’re all just sour patch kids over here.\nLarissa Anderson hasn’t faced a bigger challenge in her time at Mizzou, there’s no doubt about that. Time will tell if she’s up to the task.\nYesterday at Rock M and Rock M+\n“There’s just not gonna be a ton of staffs out there that have not one but two former players [Kostas and Fruendt], and they’re decorated players,” Sullivan points out. “Having them speak to recruits about why they can play for Kellie is going to be a big, big deal. So I’m excited for recruits to get a chance to get first hand knowledge of what it’s like to play for Kellie.”\nI’m... excited? About women’s basketball? And it’s not related to the WNBA?\nMizzou Baseball lost big Saturday for the third consecutive game against Mississippi State, falling 12-1 in a seven inning run-rule. The Tigers end the regular season with a 16-38 record and 3-27 mark in the SEC after getting swept this weekend.\nWe’ll always have Texas A&M!\nMissouri honed Perkins offensive package and used him less in ways he wasn’t as likely to succeed. It did cause his usage to drop and also his efficiency go up. The overall production dipped, but it’s hard to say he didn’t have a good season overall when he was a starter much of the year on a team that finished top 20 in KenPom.\nLook, when Mizzou signed Sebastian Mack, I was excited because I was going to miss Perkins’ physicality. If you’re leaving an impact that people miss after one year, you’re doing alright.\n- Over at Rock M+, we’re talking about football decommitments, softball transfers and the St. Louis Cardinals!\nSubscribe to Rock M Radio on Apple Podcasts.
