That year, the tournament is set to be played across the UK as a joint bid from England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland is the only remaining contender to host the biggest festival of football on the planet in 2035.\nManchester United unveiled bold plans in March to rebuild their home ground with a new 100,000-capacity featuring a bold three-tower design that supports a ‘vast umbrella’ keeping thousands of fans dry from Mancunian rain under a ‘new public plaza twice the size of Trafalgar Square’.\nWhile key questions over how the club will fund the new stadium remain — after both the government and Mr Burnham’s Greater Manchester Combined Authority ruled out giving public money to the arena — leaders hope to build a new neighbourhood around the arena by spending taxpayer cash on new infrastructure.\nBut according to Lindsay Johnston, an architect who worked on stadia for the 2022 men’s FIFA World Cup in Qatar and the Etihad Stadium in its previous life as the Commonwealth Games host, FIFA ‘want a mixed-use neighbourhood done as quickly as possible’ around each host arena.\nMixed-use neighbourhoods feature housing, shopping, drinking and dining spots, and community facilities like schools and doctors, often centred around one specialist venue.\nEffectively, it gives Manchester United and Greater Manchester a 10-year countdown to get ready for the blue-ribbon event in women’s football.\nAnd experts, speaking at the UK Real Estate, Infrastructure, and Investment Forum (UKREiiF) in Leeds on Tuesday (May 20) have outlined the three lessons football club bosses and local leaders need to learn to make it a success.\nTransport that works\nImproved public transport connections was one of the reasons why developer Quintain purchased 86 acres of land around the old Wembley stadium just before it was demolished, chief executive James Saunders.\nIn the 18 years since ‘new Wembley’ opened, thousands of homes, a retail park, a public park, an indoor arena, and food and drink spots have opened around the home of football.\nMr Saunders explained: “We picked up car parks and either stacked them or moved them off-site, to do the redevelopment, in my experience that would cause panic because [stadium operators] like to know transport arrangements.\n“There was a transport infrastructure upgrade [on the London Underground]… we saw an opportunity for a mixed use residential district within 15 mins of central London.”\nIt’s an issue Andy Burnham seems to be aware of, explaining: “I have seen change in public transport footfall [after Co-op Live opened]. It jumped up and never went back.”\nThe mayor has spoken to government about improving transport links around Old Trafford, it’s understood.\nA clear vision\nAnother key factor in Wembley’s regeneration were the developers moving early and identifying a clear vision on what they wanted to do, Mr Saunders added.\nHe went on: “We bought 86 acres around the old stadium at the point it was being decommissioned. In that time it was being built, we got outline planning permission for 7,500 houses and an outlet park.”\nBy buying the land’s freehold, it also meant the developer had ‘control of the site’, Mr Saunders told delegates.\nWith that control came the opportunity to present the vision for their development under new branding, ‘Wembley Park’, which meant the firm had a ‘supportive’ local council, which helped pave the way for work to be completed, he added.\nLocals on board\nAnd a unified vision and brand is also helpful when speaking to residents and fans to ensure any new stadium works for sport and as a good neighbour, former Everton FC executive Richard Kenyon added.\nMr Kenyon oversaw a huge consultation with the public over the club’s new Hill Dickinson Stadium, set to open next season on Bramley Moore Dock.\n“We knew Scousers like to have their say. We embraced that,” he explained. “We know football fans want to have their say. We embraced that and brought them into the process early on.\n“We had 96pc or 97pc agreement mostly [on public survey questions]. We did that through being really clear on the benefits from the start… everyone understood it was much bigger than football.”\nThe marketing guru also said they promised ‘meaningful engagement’ beyond what was required by law: “We talked to the community through Everton In The Community.\n“We did survey after survey for fans. We had the most brilliant architect, so we said to every fan who did a survey, if you answer every single question, you can have face-to-face time with the architect.”\nMore than 1,000 supporters took the offer up, he added.",
