  "body_text": "Renée Slegers was back in front of the media at the Sobha Realty Training Centre for her pre-Manchester United press conference on Friday.\nIt was the first time she spoke to the press following the extension of her contract as our head coach, so she spoke all about that and what Arsenal means to her, as well as sharing her thoughts on the weekend's game and more.\nHere's everything she had to say on the following subjects...\non her contract extension:\nYeah, [it feels] very good. I'm honoured, I'm happy, I'm grateful for the opportunity and we wanted to continue to build. I've started something and I think building something takes time, so I'm really happy I get the opportunity to stay here for longer and keep on contributing.\non how happy she is that she can build on what she’s started:\nYeah, very happy, of course. Like I said, if you really want to build something, I think you hear everyone saying it all the time, everyone is building, but it takes time to build. You can't build something overnight or in a couple of days, so it takes time. I'm really happy that we're committed now. I commit to the club to do my work as well as I can and the club is committing as well. It takes time and I get the time now to continue to build.\non how the squad is looking ahead of Saturday:\nGood. Of course, we said we wanted to maximise the time that we got coming back in because it's a short period of preparation. The squad looks really, really good. From a fitness perspective, Chloe is still not available. Daphne is really close, but still not available. And then, of course, very sad news about Kyra's mum. She travelled back to Australia to be with her family.\non Kyra Cooney-Cross, who has travelled back to Australia to be with her mum:\nThere's no time scale at the moment. She is where she needs to be. She's with her mum and her sisters, spending time there. That's all we know and that's all that's important at the moment.\non the importance of the support staff around her, with Jodie Taylor becoming Technical Director:\nReally good. I think it's a really good step for the club. The game is growing so fast. If you look at how we are growing as a team and the size of staff and how we need to align ourselves and communicate well and how we need to think about the here and now and about the future, I think this role is so important. Formalising that and being able to build structure and processes around it is key, so I'm really happy with that.\non the qualities Smilla Holmberg will bring to the squad:\nOf course, Smilla is a young player who has done really well and spent her whole career up until now at Hammarby. She has done really well there and played different roles for Hammarby. In her right-back position, she can do different things. She has versatility and that's what she's going to bring to us as well. You see her play, you watch her video, you get to know her, but you will never know exactly until the player comes into the environment. It's been so good so far. She's very humble and a hard worker. She wants to take in and observe, but at the same time, she's also shown who she is and she presents herself in a way that really fits with the team. She's done really well. So far, she's left a really good impression. I look forward to keep on working with Smilla because we believe in her as a player for the here and now, but also for the future.\non having full-backs who can offer different qualities:\nIdeally, in a dream scenario, you have two players on every position that can play exactly all the ways we want to play and can bring in everything, but that's not realistic. I think what we do look at and where we see the game growing and how we want to play is that we want versatile players. So it's that, the qualities that you bring as a player, but also we have a schedule with so many games. If you look at this upcoming block, for example, we're active in five competitions, so we also need a big squad to be able to perform in all those games and have fresh ideas, fresh legs on the pitch when necessary. It's good, the quality of the squad is really good and there's high competition, so that's really good as well. We're pushing each other, but also supporting and helping each other to become the best team possible. I'm happy that Smilla has become a part of that.\non the plan with Laila Harbert:\nNo news to share, but it's been good to see her again. She went overseas, of course, so we haven't seen her in a couple of months. She's come back and we've connected on where she stands now as a football player and what we as a club see is good for her to keep on developing and for her short-term, medium-term and long-term future. It's been really good to have her back in the environment to see where she is. Imagine yourself with our players, our midfielders, so it's been really good to see Laila back.\non if she will be staying here or getting loaned out:\nWe'll communicate when there's a clear plan for her to communicate, of course. You'll hear from us when the plan is ready to communicate.\non so many players coming to the WSL from Sweden:\nIt's good, it's a compliment to the Damallsvenskan. Obviously, I've played there and I've worked there. I've always loved living and playing and coaching in Sweden. I love the country. I think there's a special mindset with the people. I think everything starts with really hard work and being really respectful around life, around your football, around each other. So I'm not sure, I think there's something there maybe in the psychology of the people and the mindset in the country. But of course also a big compliment to the federation and the league to be able to stay at such a high level whilst leagues in other countries are growing very fast and there's a lot of investment. I think Sweden has kept their identity and looking at their ways to keep on improving the league and keep on improving players. I think coaching there, I think the understanding and investment of players is really high. And also getting to know other coaches. I did my licences in Sweden. I think the technical side of the game is on a really high level as well. It's a really good league and I think a really good compliment for everyone working in Sweden in the league and the federation. It's in such a good place while competitions are on.\non what to expect from Manchester United:\nWe expect them to come out and be aggressive and apply themselves as they want to. Of course we see that they pride themselves on their defensive game, their intensity, their aggression. They have specific qualities they've added to their squad as well. So we'll see how they start and finish the game tomorrow. We'll have to be prepared for different scenarios. Because depending on personnel they might want to play those players to their strengths. That's the fun part about the WSL. You have to prepare for different scenarios. Because you don't exactly know how the teams are going to come out. What we do know is that we have to be on top of everything every single minute. We felt it at the Emirates last year. We did win 4-3 but they came back with goals. They've shown it this season as well. It's from start to finish.\non what Arsenal means to her:\nWhen you ask the question I get goosebumps. Because when I was a young girl there was not much to dream about. There was not much to relate to when I was young. And I've never had this genetics in myself to really be a fan of a club. But of course I went to Arsenal. And something with Arsenal has always been special to me. I can't explain what it is. But I went here when I was 17 and got to know the people and got inspired by the women's team. Because there was no women's football on TV when I grew up, so I got inspired, and I think I feel a responsibility now, because now I'm here. I'm in it. I'm a part of it, and I feel a responsibility. That's what inspired me when I was young. So I know what we're doing at the moment can also inspire people for the here and now, and for everything that's to come. It's not weighing heavy on me. But I feel a responsibility that I'm doing this, hopefully for other people driving something that's bigger than us. And it's reaching a lot of people. So yeah, Arsenal means a lot to me.\non Alessia Russo coming up against her old side:\nI think there's friendships everywhere. But I think when the game starts on the pitch that's nothing you think about. But of course, I think all players on the squad are very excited to start the second half of the season. And play at the Emirates again tomorrow with I think 35,000 tickets sold. But yeah, for Alessia it's a special one. She's done it now. She's been with us a couple of years. She's played against United in quite some games. So yeah, I think in general a lot of excitement in the squad.\non targets she’d like to achieve in the year ahead:\nYeah, we have objectives for every block, and targets. What we like to do is, yes, there's outcomes, goals, but what actually do we need to do to get to those outcome and goals? It doesn't help us to talk about it. It helps us to talk about how are we going to do it, and what are the processes, and what do we need to deliver on a daily basis. So that's what we mainly focus on. But I think it speaks for itself that being part of Arsenal and winning the trophies.\non the importance of Leah Williamson and if she’s ready to start:\nShe looks really good. So of course we built her in nicely last block. With a couple of games she came on, and then she started against Crystal Palace, which wasn't an easy game from other perspectives - the physicality and conditions. She's ready to start. She looks really good. She's had a good break and came back really sharp. So it's really good to see in terms of her leadership. We all know what Leah brings on the pitch. She's really clever and can solve situations, can see situations, can communicate the situations. But also off the pitch, she's of course been at the club for so long. She has Arsenal in her heart. So she has that perspective, which is very special, which we really want to embrace, everything that has been before us, and then we have the here and now and the future, which she's really invested in as well. Coming to Smilla, I think the team has been brilliant with Smilla this week. We say that we have processes in place on all levels, on the club level to make sure that the player, especially coming from another country, gets all the help that they need to settle into a new country. I think from a coaches and analysts perspective, and by the staff perspective, we make sure that they get across everything. The way we work. The methodology. The game model. The role in that position. But then there's also player to player, onboarding or integration. We like that process to go as quickly as possible because we're a team and everyone needs to be in a place where you feel good to perform, and I think the team has done that really well so far.\non if Anneke Borbe is fit and the plan for Naomi Williams:\nYes. Nekki [Anneke] is fit. So she's ready to go. Naomi is back with us to stay, and we're happy to have her back. She's obviously been with the club for some time now and she's developed so much. She got her loan. But we want her, we need her back with us now and we're really happy that she's back with us to contribute.\non Jenna Nighswonger:\nJenna will not be in the squad tomorrow, and she's close to a loan move.\non Jodie’s appointment happening on the same day as Renée’s contract renewal:\nWell I think it's been part of the plans of the club for longer and I think it's really good. If you look at how the game is growing. How the size of what we do here is growing and everything that's involved and needs to be linked with each other and aligned with each other. I think that was necessary. So I think the announcement of these two roles on the same day also speaks for the change in structure.\non how to capitalise on momentum:\nWe often start games well. We have so much quality to finish games well and to be able to change things, if necessary. Or just get fresh ideas, fresh legs in. The focus area for us has been that phase in between, to do that really well as well. What it does to us, positive momentum, negative momentum, goals for and goals against and how we behave in those moments and where we need to stay in a controlled middle, a sweet spot for ourselves psychologically, to be able to manage all phases in a game and that's going to be important against United as well. Like I just said, they have a top squad. So it's going to be a really good game of football for you tomorrow with a lot of quality on the pitch. They have the ability to come back and do things late in games as well. So it's going to be extremely important that we manage all scenarios and all momentum phases in the way we play.\non if the block coming up is the biggest one:\nDepends on how you look at it. I think every block is important. I think we've had some big blocks with big challenges and strong opponents. But of course, from a point of view that we're active in five competitions. So we play WSL football, Champions League football, the Champions Cup that's new and then the two cups. So it's a full block of football and of course we're very proud and very happy that we're competing on five fronts.\non the UWCL knockout phase play-off games:\nWell, like I just mentioned, we work here to get good outcomes, get results and ultimately trophies. That's what we work for, what we want to achieve. Then how are you going to do it? Well, we were in a scenario where we didn't qualify directly. So we got the knockout games and then I'm like, okay, if that's reality now, then that's really good for us because we love to play football and we love those moments with the fans to be able to share that. So I see that as from the starting point, the scenario, I see that as very positive.\non what she looks forward to about tomorrow’s game:\nI think there's a couple of key areas that we want to get right in the game that we know we have to do well against United. I think we definitely need to match them in the physical game they want to play and be really good in our recognising situations, positioning and aggression on the pitch. But then also doing that together with the fans, I really look forward to getting back to Emirates and creating an atmosphere and creating a strength in the stadium that's bigger than the 11 players on the pitch, so I really look forward to that. I think it can become a really special Saturday because I think everyone looks forward to football again after this short break. Hopefully the fans as well, the players definitely.\non if the Christmas break was helpful to prepare for an intense period:\nYeah, no, I don't think it's difficult. I think the break was relatively short and the players have been active over that break as well so they didn't lose fitness. So I think from that perspective, from a mental perspective, just getting recharged, spending time with family and being in other situational contexts, that charges your battery. So I think from that point of view it's been positive. So the block ahead of us, we are actually, because we've had so many blocks now with short turnarounds, two or three days in between, we actually have had more than seven days now leading into one game and we're going to have a long lead-in into Aston Villa. So we were actually talking the opposite, that there is some space in between games at the start of the block, which we want to use effectively because when you have those short turnarounds, it's really hard to train and work on details. So we want to use this time, these days, in a really good way and then we go into those short turnarounds again. But then we have such a good squad. So we'll need the players and we'll need the squad for the games and the amount of games that are ahead of us.\non where she’d like Arsenal to be by 2029:\nI think what's important for me is that the club are delivering things consistently. But again, that's outcome goals. I think what we need to achieve that is to be constantly on top of everything in the way we see football and how we want to play our football and be really proactive with that, where we see our strengths and how we work with recruitment over time. Then the other one would be how we build culture here in the building with the staff and players, because I believe that that's the foundation of maximising the potential on the pitch. So that's definitely something that if 2029, that sounds crazy by the way, 2029, or at any point when you leave, you feel like you're leaving something better behind, then that's my ultimate goal for myself.\non the show of faith in a longer-term contract:\nYeah, no, that of course feels very good and I'm grateful for the opportunity and the belief of the club that this is the direction we want to go. So I'm really grateful for that. But also huge responsibility on me to make things happen and make the team, the football and everything around it, make that go in the right direction and that's on me to deliver and then from a bigger picture perspective, I think if you have more time, we spoke about it earlier, if you have more time, then I believe you can do things that are more sustainable. So the day I leave, there's something really good in place that the club can continue on and the next one as well. At the end of the day, I'm not forever, but Arsenal will be forever.\non inappropriate social media comments directed towards Smilla:\nWhat's happened online and what does happen online consistently, it's sad. It's not good. It's not a positive development in society. So it doesn't make me happy at all. No one deserves this because it's cowardly actions. So think about the people. We're all human beings and we have feelings, so please don't. That would be my message to the outside world if you can make a statement and make a little bit of an impact because it's not good. But yeah, we support Smilla, of course, and we have a good system in place to support her. Smilla here now, new in with us, she's young, but like you said, she's played for Hammarby for a long time, which is a big club in Sweden with a big fan base and very loud fans as well, playing under pressure, playing to win things. So I think there are quite some similarities, of course, in different countries. But she brings a humble mindset, hard-working mindset. I really like it. But also some form of confidence; this is me, this is what I'm going to do and this is what I want to contribute with. With a big pride of getting to represent Arsenal. So I think she's coming really well. So I really look forward to working with Smilla.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
