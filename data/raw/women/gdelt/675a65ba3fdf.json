  "body_text": "Hi there, @ everyone who's been in the Alfie Hive since Emily in Paris season 2 and promptly RAN to the internet to frantically look up Lucien Laviscount as you binge-watch season 4. It’s time for a much-needed refresher! Lucien obviously played Emily’s new love interest, Alfie, on the show (who’s Gabriel, never heard of him) and completely won over fans’ hearts as a result. Now, because season 4 legit just came out (!!), we won’t spoil *too* much for ya, but we still wanna give you the gift of all the juicy intel on exactly who he is IRL. And if Lucien looks familiar, that’s probs because he’s been in several major projects and he just starred in a... como se dice... spicy music video for Shakira. In other words, we need to know everything about the man!\nYep, His British Accent Is Real\nTwenty-nine-year-old Lucien is from Ribble Valley in England—where he began his career as a model. And like Alfie, living in Paris was a new experience for him. Unlike Alfie, though, he’s extremely here for it. As Lucien told Time magazine, “It was actually my first time in Paris. It was literally like Lucien in Paris! The city is like a huge museum with the roof taken off—everything is a spectacle. It’s got this mystery and culture and this energy that lifts through it. I was just blown away by being there.”\nHe’s Been in Several Major TV Shows\nIf you’re wondering where you know Lucien from, he played Alexander Cabot in Katy Keene and Earl Grey in Scream Queens—which we (and Glen Powell!) can all agree was one of the best shows ever. Oh, and he was on the UK’s Celebrity Big Brother back in 2011 (he came in fifth).\nAside from Emily in Paris, Lucien is starring in the upcoming film adaptation for This Time Next Year.\nHe Was Immediately Cast as Alfie After Auditioning\nAs Lucien tells it, he sent his audition tape off, got a phone call saying he was going to meet creator Darren Star and actor Lily Collins, and was expecting to jump over a few more hurdles to get the part. Instead, he was cast right away.\n“We were just talking about life, character, and what kind of makes this season different for Lily as well,” he told Netflix. “Then it was just like, ‘Alright. So that’s it, Lucien. Thank you very much.’” He had no idea how the convo went, but “then I got the phone call saying, ‘You’re going to go to Paris.’”\nWow, Lauren Conrad could never.\nHe Recently Starred in Shakira's Music Video for \"Puntería\"...\nYep! Lucien was a sexy centaur in Shakira's music video for her track with Cardi B, \"Puntería.\" Will leave you with this:\n...And Reportedly Dated Her, Too\nAfter their chemistry was off the charts in \"Puntería,\" Lucien and Shakira dating rumors started swirling in March 2024. A source confirmed to the DailyMail that they were an item, but that they were 'not heavily involved yet.'\nHow! Ever! Lucien was spotted supporting her during a Times Square performance and told Univisión, \"She's probably one of the most incredible women I've ever come across in my whole life and I'm happy to be here to see her get her flowers. And, yeah, she's truly wonderful.\"\nBut Before All That, He Was (Kinda) “Discovered” by David Beckham\nLucien chatted about how he got into modeling and acting with Harry Connick Jr. on the talk show Harry, saying, “I was shopping with my mom in town and there was this beautiful shop attendant. She was probably about 18, but at the time, she was a woman…I was about 10. I’m like, ‘Mom, she’s gorgeous,’ and my mom’s always like, ‘Go and get it son.’ So I went over there, brash and bold, I was like, ‘Baby, are we getting out of here or what, because I don’t know about you but I think Lion King is showing down the road?’ Great film, by the way, my favorite.”\nAlready an instant classic, but there’s more: “This woman overheard and she was like, ‘Look, listen, your son, he’s got heart. I’m casting for this new kids’ range, clothing range. He’d be great, you should bring him for an audition. And I got the job. And it was with David Beckham, he brought out his clothing range.”\nTragically, we couldn’t find photos from this era, so here’s this instead:\n^Ur welcome.\nHe’s Dabbled in Music\nWhen he’s not causing Netflix viewers to perspire, Lucien moonlights as a singer. Or at least he did. Plz enjoy his 2012 single “Dance With You”:\nLike Alfie, He’s Big Into Soccer (Er, Football)\n“I grew up playing,” Lucien told Time. “My team’s Arsenal—they’re not doing too great at the moment, but I’ll stand by them until the end. Me and Lucas [Bravo] were always talking about football, and then we got told a month into it that they were putting in a scene of us playing. Our mics were live most of the time, so we had little bits and bobs and they manipulated that into stories. The writers were always on the ball, trying to make things as organic and fresh as they could, so it’s great that it fed into our lives a little bit.”\nKay, that’s all, off to watch more Emily in Paris!",
