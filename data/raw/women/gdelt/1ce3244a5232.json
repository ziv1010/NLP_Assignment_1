  "body_text": "The best way to describe Peacock is that it’s essentially NBC+. There are a lot of movies from the Universal Pictures catalog, but the real attraction is the daily updates of NBC’s various sporting events, as well as episodes of Access Hollywood and the long-running soap opera Days of Our Lives.\nIn May, Peacock’s paid subscribers can watch the 148th Kentucky Derby or Premier League soccer at the end of the month. If you’re craving new comedies, Peacock has the debut of Pete Davidson’s new show Bupkis, which also stars Joe Pesci and Edie Falco. Keep reading for the full list of films, series, and live sporting events that will be available on the streaming service throughout the month, as well as everything else coming to Peacock in April 2023. Our recommendations are highlighted in bold. (Note: Some content will not be available to watch without a paid subscription at the Peacock Premium or Peacock Premium Plus levels.)\nIf Peacock isn’t your only go-to streaming service, we also have helpful guides to the best movies on Netflix and best shows on Netflix, as well as the best movies streaming on Amazon and best shows streaming on Amazon, plus plenty of other guides for Hulu, Disney, and HBO Max.\nEverything new on Peacock in May 2023\nMay 1\nThe 40-Year-Old Virgin, 2005\nAdventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, 2000\nAlong Came Polly, 2004\nAre We There Yet?, 2005\nAre We Done Yet?, 2007\nBleeding Steel, 2017*\nBooksmart, 2019*\nA Christmas Miracle, 2019 (Hallmark)\nClockers, 1995\nCrooklyn, 1994\nCrossword Mysteries: A Puzzle to Die For, 2019 (Hallmark)\nDear White People, 2014\nDetroit, 2017\nDirty Dancing 2: Havana Nights, 2004\nDragon Blade, 2015*\nEnemy of the State, 1998\nErin Brockovich, 2000\nFace/Off, 1997\nFramed for Murder: A Fixer Upper Mystery:, 2017 (Hallmark)\nFree Angela and All Political Prisoners, 2013*\nA Gingerbread Romance, 2018 (Hallmark)\nThe Good Shepard, 2006\nThe Grandmaster, 2013\nHello, It’s Me, 2015 (Hallmark)\nHoney, 2003\nHoney 2, 2011\nThe Hulk, 2003\nThe Hunt, 2020*\nIce Sculpture Christmas, 2015 (Hallmark)\nIt’s Complicated, 2009\nThe Joy Luck Club, 1993\nKing Kong, 2005\nThe King’s Speech, 2010*\nLand of the Lost, 2009\nLife, 1999\nLife of Pi, 2012\nLove, Classified, 2022 (Hallmark)\nThe Love Club: Nicole’s Pen Pal, 2023 (Hallmark)+\nLove Under the Stars, 20215\nMix Up in the Mediterranean, 2021 (Hallmark)\nMo’ Better Blues, 1990\nThe Mummy, 1999*\nThe Mummy Returns, 2001*\nThe Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, 2008*\nMurder, She Baked: A Plum Pudding Mystery, 2015 (Hallmark)\nMy Big Fat Greek Wedding 2, 2016\nMy Cousin Vinny, 1992\nNaughty or Nice, 2012 (Hallmark)\nNotting Hill, 1999\nOne Christmas Eve, 2012 (Hallmark)\nPerfect Harmony, 2022 (Hallmark)\nPride, 2007\nReal Murders: Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, 2015 (Hallmark)\nSalt, 2010\nSchindler’s List, 1993\nSealed With a Kiss: Wedding March 6, 2023 (Hallmark)+\nThe Scorpion King, 2002*\nScott Pilgrim vs. The World, 2010\nSicario, 2015\nSisters, 2015\nThe Smurfs, 2011*\nThe Smurfs 2, 2013*\nSpeed, 1994\nSpring Breakthrough, 2023 (Hallmark)+\nTrue Lies, 1994\nThe Tuxedo, 2002\nThe Wedding Planner, 2001\nWhile You Were Sleeping, 1995\nYou Got Served, 2004\nAutopsy: The Last Hours Of…, Season 12, New Episode (Reelz)++\nThe Blacklist, Season 10, New Episode (NBC)\nDays of Our Lives, Season 58, New Episode (Peacock Exclusive)*\nLa Vuelta Feminina Cycling – Stage 1*\nLeguizamo Does America, Season 1, New Episode (MSNBC)\nLive from E!: The Met Gala Red Carpet\nOpen House NYC, Season 15, New Episode (NBC)\nPremier League – Leicester City v.
