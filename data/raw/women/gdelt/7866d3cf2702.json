  "body_text": "For those of us who went from being immersed in the Women’s World Cup to suddenly jumping back into the Premier League last month, there were a few adjustments to make.\nThe men’s games were more physical, more frenetic, more intense. But there was also something lacking. After the way Spain won the World Cup, you couldn’t help watching the Premier League and yearning for some nifty Spanish playmakers.\nAdvertisement\nWith Spain’s World Cup triumph almost completely overshadowed by ongoing rows involving the coach and president, it’s worth reiterating quite how much their success depended on their national footballing philosophy.\nGO DEEPER\nBreaking down what Luis Rubiales did after Spain won the Women's World Cup\nConsidering the tension between players and coach Jorge Vilda, the fact that reigning Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas was desperately short of full fitness, and that star players such as Patri Guijarro, Mapi Leon and Sandra Panos (arguably the best holding midfielder, centre-back and goalkeeper in the world respectively) were refusing to participate, Spain’s victory was remarkable.\nSpain played pure Spanish football, the tiki-taka we’ve come to associate with their men’s side over the past 15 years. They averaged 68 per cent of possession, at least four per cent higher than any other side who reached the knockout stage. They scored the most goals, too.\nMaybe a more revealing statistic is the slightly niche category on data website FBref, which tallies “live passes that lead to a shot attempt” — in other words, chances created from open play. Spain did that 198 times. The three other sides who also played seven matches managed 109 (Australia), 106 (England) and 85 (Sweden). Variances in the quality of opposition are a factor, of course, but that means Spain created more open-play chances than runners-up England and third-placed Sweden put together.\nSo many Spain players could play the killer pass. Even with Putellas on the fringes, they had Aitana Bonmati, the winner of the tournament’s Golden Ball award. She was actually nullified effectively in some games, but that was no problem because Spain also boasted Mariona Caldentey, who drifted infield from the left to become an extra playmaker. Then there was Jenni Hermoso, who played either as an advanced No 8, or a No 9 dropping deep to create. Even holding midfielder Teresa Abelleira plays as a No 8 for her club side, Real Madrid, and adapted to this deeper role excellently.\nAdvertisement\nIn other words, the Spain women’s side were the same as the men’s side from 10 years ago — absolutely overloaded on silky playmakers.\nThat is no coincidence; not only have the players developed in the same environment, under coaches who think in the same way, but the women’s players were also directly influenced by their predecessors. Bonmati, for example, was aged between 10 and 14 when Spain won three men’s tournaments on the bounce, and she dreamed of becoming the next Xavi or Andres Iniesta, for both Barcelona and Spain.\nThat Spain generation inspired everyone, and while their rise was good for La Liga, it was great for the Premier League too. Particularly in the aftermath of Spain’s World Cup success, there was a significant stylistic revolution at the top of English football. Possession football became vaunted like never before, with pass completion rates jumping around eight per cent within the space of a couple of seasons.\nThe Premier League was also blessed with the addition of several Spanish playmakers. David Silva joined Manchester City in 2010, Juan Mata arrived at Chelsea in 2011, Arsenal signed Santi Cazorla in 2012, and then, after Mata had moved to Manchester United, Chelsea recruited former Arsenal playmaker Cesc Fabregas in 2014. Those players invariably set the tone for their side’s possession play.\nTheir peaks didn’t quite align — Mata’s was at his best with Chelsea and Fabregas was playing for Barcelona — but in 2014-15, this quartet recorded 40 assists between them. The following season, boosted by contributions from others such as Jesus Navas, Gerard Deulofeu and Hector Bellerin, there were 71 assists by Spanish players in the Premier League. Last season, that number was down to 24.\nThe Premier League still offers a sizeable Spanish contingent but increasingly, it is defensive players who dominate — Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez, Manchester City holding midfielder Rodri, Tottenham wing-back Pedro Porro and Aston Villa centre-back Pau Torres make up the top four for minutes played this season.\nAdvertisement\nNext on the list are Wolves’ Pablo Sarabia and Pablo Fornals of West Ham — talented midfielders, but not exactly world-beaters (neither are in the current Spain squad). Adama Traore, now at Fulham, will create chances but his standout quality is certainly not incisive passing. The absurdly talented Thiago has not consistently showcased his best form in the Premier League, partly because of his role and partly because of injuries; he has only managed four league assists since joining Liverpool three years ago.\nThis isn’t, to say, of course, that only Spanish footballers can be effective playmakers. Martin Odegaard and Christian Eriksen could pass for any of Spain’s best, and Kevin De Bruyne is arguably the most devastating assister the Premier League has seen. But there has been a shift towards more powerful, physically dominant players. That owes to the rise of pressing and the “light touch” refereeing over the past couple of seasons. Pep Guardiola, who once converted midfielders into defenders, spent the second half of last season playing four centre-backs together.\nLa Liga isn’t blessed with lots of Spanish creators either. Of the top 10 assisters last season, only two were Spanish: holding midfielder Mikel Merino of Real Sociedad and left-back Brian Olivan of Espanyol, enjoying his first full La Liga campaign at the age of 28. The national team can rely on Barcelona youth products Pedri and Gavi, but whereas Spain once had six or seven top-class playmakers at their disposal, now there’s a greater quantity of energetic midfielders or speedy wingers. Marco Asensio and Dani Olmo are more straightforward, more direct, than the generation from a decade ago.\nThe most typically Spanish playmaker thriving in La Liga at the moment is something of a throwback. Isco played alongside Mata at Valencia, Cazorla at Malaga and then often shined at Zinedine Zidane’s Real Madrid at the top of a diamond, but endured a very difficult 2022-23 at Sevilla, at one point coming to blows with sporting director Monchi. After his contract was terminated midway through the campaign, Isco was without a club for half a season. He spent it scouring the world for a new club… and eventually settled for Sevilla’s city rivals, Real Betis.\nAt Betis, he’s been a revelation, conducting the play from his favoured No 10 role and poking passes in behind defences. Only Celta Vigo’s Iago Aspas has created more chances than Isco in La Liga this season, although the wasteful finishing of his team-mates means he’s yet to record an assist. Even after Betis’ 4-2 loss to Athletic Bilbao, it was widely agreed that Isco was the game’s best performer.\nIsco hasn’t always helped himself over the years, but it still seems something of a waste that Spain’s most natural heir to Silva, Mata, Cazorla and Fabregas, a playmaker who has played in four victorious European Cup finals for Real Madrid, has only participated in one major tournament: World Cup 2018. From a Premier League perspective, after years of interest from Manchester City — and links to Chelsea and Manchester United — it’s a shame English football hasn’t been blessed with his talents, either.\nLast season’s Premier League title was contested by two clubs managed by former Spanish midfielders renowned for their technical quality rather than their physical gifts. But Guardiola and Mikel Arteta know the lay of the land, and whereas once we might have expected them to be battling it out in the transfer market for a suave between-the-lines playmaker, instead their joint target this summer was the sturdy, more defensive-minded Declan Rice.\nAdvertisement\nBeauty is in the eye of the beholder, but there was something particularly magical about that era when the Premier League’s sides were dominated by silky Spanish playmakers, when Silva, Mata and Fabregas all topped the Premier League assist charts in the space of four years, and Cazorla twice finished in second place.\nFor those missing that kind of quality, the Women’s World Cup was a breath of fresh air.\n(Top photos: Getty Images)",
