Ravera brings extensive international experience, having previously served as an assistant coach with the Guinea national team and French club AS Monaco.\nHe will be joined by Black Queens head coach Kim Lars Björkegren, who guided the women’s national team to a bronze medal at the 2025 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations and also secured qualification for the 2026 WAFCON, a campaign he will continue to lead.\nTo boost scouting, match preparation and performance analysis, the GFA has appointed Spanish coach José Daniel Martínez Alfonso. Martínez Alfonso currently works as an assistant coach and video analyst with Major League Soccer side Atlanta FC.\nThe medical team has also been reinforced with the return of Carlos Lozano Romero as Team Physiotherapist. Lozano previously worked with the Black Stars during the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, and his return is expected to provide continuity and familiarity within the setup.\nCompleting the new appointments is British-born Ghanaian performance specialist Dwayne Peasah Paa Kwesi, who has been named Performance Coach. He will be responsible for physical conditioning, player optimisation and overall performance management during the World Cup campaign.\nThe appointments are strictly for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and are in line with long-standing GFA practice of strengthening the technical team whenever Ghana qualifies for major international tournaments.\nThe new technical members will work alongside the existing backroom staff led by Head Coach Otto Addo as the Black Stars intensify preparations for the World Cup.\nLatest Stories\n-\n‘I wanted to be an architect but ended up as a nurse’ – Diana Hamilton reveals\n39 minutes -\nFrom wards to worship: Diana Hamilton reveals how nursing school shaped her destiny\n56 minutes -\nMahama demands binding deadlines for African reparations\n1 hour -\nThis is not the time to settle political scores – Bawumia to government\n3 hours -\n5 definitive Valentine’s Day gifts to win your lover’s heart in Ghana\n3 hours -\n37% of SHS students exposed to drugs – Opare-Addo\n3 hours -\nNLC secures court injunction against striking tertiary unions\n4 hours -\nOSP says it remains guided by law after INTERPOL deletes Ofori-Atta’s Red Notice\n4 hours -\nWaiting in the Ring: life inside Bukom’s halted boxing scene\n4 hours -\nRed Notice cancellation: OSP official fires back at Ofori-Atta’s lawyers\n4 hours -\nOfori-Atta saga: Red Notice ends after arrest – OSP official clarifies\n5 hours -\nAAG raises alarm over billboard demolitions, calls for presidential intervention\n5 hours -\nHealth Minister to chair probe into ‘No Bed Syndrome’ death; promises system overhaul\n6 hours -\nPrime Insight to tackle ‘galamsey tax’ debate, cocoa reforms and Ayawaso East fallout this Saturday\n6 hours -\nCocoa crisis, galamsey complicity and election credibility to dominate this Saturday’s Newsfile\n7 hours",
