A lot of progression has happened here in the last five years since I was last here and to see how much the club has grown and progressed is incredible. I’m very happy to be here.”\nHead Coach Jonas Eidevall added: “We’re really pleased to have brought in Jodie to help us from now until the end of the season. She has a proven track record for scoring goals and we know her experience will be a great asset to the whole dressing room. We have so much to fight for this season and Jodie will help us on that journey.”\nHead of Women’s Football Clare Wheatley said: “Jodie is a really experienced and talented player and will give us added competition at this crucial stage of the season. We’re delighted to bring her back to the club and all have great memories of working with her in her previous spell here.”\nThe deal is subject to the completion of regulatory processes.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
