Annie's original post read: 'I think it’s important to remember that no matter how good you are to people, it won’t make them good to you.'\nHere, FEMAIL reveals how the two women shape up in the latest battle of the WAGS...\nLeicester City WAG Rebekah Vardy has ignited another WAG feud as she hit out at Kyle Walker's wife Annie Kilner - here FEMAIL reveals how the two women shape up in a head to head\nThe wife of Jamie Vardy, 41, branded Annie, 30, a 'doormat' and accused her of deflecting attention as her husband Kyle Walker, 32, is facing a police probe after allegedly flashing and kissing another woman in a Vodka Revolution bar\nLOVE LIFE\nANNIE\nAnnie met Kyle Walker when he was 18 while he was playing at his hometown club Sheffield United, and she was a 16-year-old model. The couple are parents to three children - Roman, Riaan and Reign\nThe couple secretly tied the knot in a small romantic ceremony at the end of November last year after 12 years together\nAnnie met Kyle Walker when he was 18 while he was playing at his hometown club Sheffield United, and she was a 16-year-old model. The couple are parents to three children - Roman, Riaan and Reign.\nIn June 2020, the Mirror reported that Kyle had popped the question to Annie with an epic floral proposal at her home.\nThe couple secretly tied the knot in a small romantic ceremony at the end of November last year after 12 years together.\nAs well as the three children he shares with Annie, Kyle shares son Kairo, 14 months, with ex Lauryn Goodman.\nThe footballer conceived his youngest child Kairo while involved in a short relationship with Lauryn, during a temporary split from Annie in February 2020.\nLast year, Annie claimed that days before Kyle allegedly met Lauryn, she suffered a miscarriage, and was devastated when she claimed he confessed that the reality star was pregnant.\nShe told The Sun On Sunday at the time: 'I don't know what my thoughts or feelings are any more. I feel dead inside. Each day is filled with pain.\n'I don't think I'll ever be the same again because of what he's done. It makes me really sad that I've been damaged so badly when I've done nothing to deserve it.\n'I've tried to hate him but how can I hate the man my kids love so much? Before the infidelity he was my best friend, my soulmate. I could count on him for anything.'\nAnnie had expressed that she'd like to have a little girl, telling OK! Magazine: 'I really want a little girl.\n'I love my boys, but I'd really like a daughter as I'm outnumbered in this house.'\nShe is not known to have had any other partners.\nREBEKAH\nRebekah married Jamie Vardy in 2016 at luxurious Peckforton Castle in Cheshire - although many of Jamie's close family didn't attend the nuptials, with Rebekah blamed for causing a rift between Jamie and his mother Lisa and stepfather Phil (Pictured at the Pride of Sport Awards, London, 2018)\nRoom for the brood! The family live in a palatial mansion in Leicestershire that boasts its own gym and swimming pool (Pictured in September at Legoland, from left: Jamie Vardy, son Finley Jaiden, son Taylor, daughter Sofia, Rebekah and Megan)\nRebekah, 'Becky' to close friends, was first married to Mark Godden after a whirlwind romance when he was 21-years-old and she was just 18.\nThey met at his local pub in Witney, Oxfordshire, where she was a barmaid and he was playing in the darts team.\nSpeaking to The Mirror in 2017, he claimed they became engaged when Becky Nicholson, as she was then called, spotted a ring in a magazine and told him: 'I want that. Buy it for me.'\nIt's reported the pair spent £7000 on their wedding on the beach in Mexico in 2001, but the union lasted just six months.\nRebekah later admitted that she'd had sex with Peter Andre while still married to Mark, but confessed the Australian singer was the 'worst lover' she's ever had.\nSpeaking of his ex, after seeing her appear on I'm A Celebrity, Mark told the Sun: 'I'm an avid fan [of the show] and this year it's even better because my ex is on it. While I don't want to see her win, although she'd love to, I want her to go through hell.'\nTeen wedding bells; Rebekah wed her first husband Mark Godden in a £7,000 ceremony when she was just 19\nHer next significant relationship was with ex-lower league footballer Luke Foster, father of her son player who she met in 2007 when he was playing for Conference side Oxford United\nBecky then went on to date Steve Clarke, her boss at a timeshare company, and during their on-off relationship, she fell pregnant by another man.\nAged 23 and eight months pregnant with her daughter Megan, she tied the knot with Steve, something she's since described as the 'biggest mistake of her life'.\nThey soon moved to Cyprus and the marriage broke down after 10 months, when Steve allegedly cheated on her.\nBecky fled back to the UK with Meghan and weeks later, Clarke was sentenced to two years in prison after being convicted of causing death by reckless driving in a head-on crash which killed a father and grandfather.\nHer next significant relationship was with ex-lower league footballer Luke Foster, father of her son player who she met in 2007 when he was playing for Conference side Oxford United.\nAfter Foster's career faltered and he ended up playing for more lower league clubs including Lincoln City, he says he felt compelled to put lavish spending on a credit card to keep up with Rebekah's desire for a luxury lifestyle.\n'Becky was finding it a struggle. We weren't doing that badly, in my mind – living in a five-bed house, driving around in a Mercedes,' he told the Mirror.\nThe couple parted amicably in 2013 and Rebekah, who was working in Viper nightclub in Sheffield, a job Foster got her, soon moved on to her current love match Jamie, who she met while planning his birthday party.\nJust three months later, she fell pregnant with their daughter Sofia.\nFoster said: 'She's now got the husband she always wanted, one who can keep her in the lifestyle she's dreamt of. She's got the shopping, the house, the car. She's living her perfect life.\nBecky upgraded. She said that to my face. She said he'd treat her a hell of a lot better.'\nBecky and Jamie went on to wed at a lavish ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire in 2106.\nBut many of her husband's close family stayed away, with Rebekah blamed for causing a rift between Jamie and his mother Lisa and stepfather Phil, who did not attend their wedding.\nJamie's daughter Ella, then five, was kept away from the glitzy nuptials by his former girlfriend Emma Daggett. Indeed, Rebekah's own mother, Alison Nicholson, was also not in attendance.\nBlissfully happy with her latest flame, the couple share three children, Sofia and Finley Jaiden, three, as well as Megan, 13 and Taylor, eight, from her previous relationships.\nSCANDALS\nANNIE\nHaving supported Kyle through the 2018 World Cup, in March 2019, Annie dumped him after he allegedly sent messages to Ex On The Beach reality star Laura Brown (pictured)\nAnd now Annie's husband Kyle Walker is facing a police probe after allegedly flashing and kissing another woman in a Vodka Revolution bar\nWhile Annie herself has lived a relatively scandal free life, her partner Kyle has hit the headlines on a number of occasions for his playboy behaviour.\nHaving supported Kyle through the 2018 World Cup, in March 2019, she dumped him after he allegedly sent messages to Ex On The Beach reality star Laura Brown.\nKyle also came under fire for allegedly hosting a sex party with two escorts while the country remained in Covid-19 lockdown.\nIt was claimed the footballer and a friend paid £2,200 for Louise McNamara, 21, and a 24-year-old Brazilian call girl to visit his Cheshire home, before leaving the next day.\nIn 2020, Annie told SunSport: 'Kyle says he wants his future with me and the kids. He wants to marry me but he's caused a lifetime of damage. But when you have children they come first.\n'My kids want their daddy. Until you're in this situation you don't know what you'd do.'\nWalker, who has 48 England caps, apologised for the incident.\nHe said: 'I want to take this opportunity to issue a public apology for the choices I made last week. I understand that my position as a professional footballer brings the responsibility of being a role model.\n'As such, I want to apologise to my family, friends, football club, supporters and the public for letting them down.'\nAnd now Kyle is set to be probed by police after he appeared to repeatedly expose himself on a drunken afternoon where he was also seen touching the breasts of a woman who is not Annie.\nHowever it seems the pair have been in a good place lately after they were spotted locking lips together just a few days ago on a day out together in Cheshire.\nREBEKAH\nRebekah took Coleen Rooney, the wife of former United captain Wayne, to court for libel and lost in a case dubbed 'Wagatha Christie'\nIn October, she was ordered to pay 90 per cent of Coleen's legal bills with the first £800,000 needing to be paid within six weeks. The former Dancing on Ice contestant also has to foot her own lawyers' bills, meaning the enormous cost of her failed libel claim is around £4million\nRebekah took Coleen Rooney, the wife of former United captain Wayne, to court for libel and lost in a case dubbed 'Wagatha Christie'.\nThe high court battle began in 2019 when Rooney accused Vardy of leaking stories about her and her family to the press.\nIn a viral social media post, Rooney revealed she had put false stories on her Instagram page. These fake tales then emerged in The Sun newspaper.\nBecause she had changed her settings so only one user could see it she felt confident to make the famous declaration 'it's....Rebekah Vardy's account'.\nHer rigorous sleuthing to find the culprit earned her the title Wagatha Christie in reference to mystery writer Agatha Christie.\nRebekah denied the claims and sued for libel, but lost in the High Court in July where her evidence was deemed 'manifestly inconsistent' and 'not credible'.\nIn October, she was ordered to pay 90 per cent of Coleen's legal bills with the first £800,000 needing to be paid within six weeks.\nThe former Dancing on Ice contestant also has to foot her own lawyers' bills, meaning the enormous cost of her failed libel claim is around £4million.\nRebekah reportedly faces an estimated £1.5million legal bill towards her costs following their 'Wagatha Christie' High Court libel battle.\nThe WAG - whose reputation is in tatters after she scored one of the worst own goals in British legal history - is thought to have to find £800,000 of it in weeks.\nIt comes at the hands of a High Court judge who dismissed her evidence as 'evasive or implausible' in one of the most closely-followed cases in recent years.\nShe was accused of deliberately deleting WhatsApp messages central to the case as it was suggested her agent also intentionally dropped her phone in the North Sea.\nVardy and her footballer husband were left with the bill after Mrs Justice Steyn ruled in favour of Rooney in a judgment that said swathes of her evidence given under oath had been 'manifestly inconsistent', 'not credible' and needed to be treated with 'very considerable caution'.\nShe lost her high-profile libel claim against Rooney in July when Justice Steyn ruled that Rooney's viral social media post accusing Vardy of leaking her private information to the press was 'substantially true'.\nCAREER\nANNIE\nAnnie appears to enjoy a quieter life, outside of the spotlight - but did appear as a guest star on the Real Housewives of Cheshire\nWhile many WAGs appear to enjoy huge social media followings with public accounts, Annie is far from the norm.\nInstead she has a private Instagram with a mere 16,000 followers.\nThe former model, who signed to Mode Model Management in 2013, spends much of her time focusing on her three children, whom she calls her 'kings.'\nBut she has briefly dabbled in reality TV - appearing as a guest star on The Real Housewives of Cheshire.\nShe was introduced as a close friend of Seema Malhotra.\nUpon her arrival on the show, RHOC star Tanya Bardsley said: 'Annie is beautiful and very, very young.'\nREBEKAH\nWhen Leicester clinched the title in fairytale fashion, Rebekah's star was firmly in the ascendant (pictured, supporting her husband during one of his matches)\nJungle capers: The outspoken WAG found herself being offered a place on I'm a Celebrity in 2017\nWhen Leicester clinched the title in fairytale fashion, Rebekah's star was firmly in the ascendant, with the offer of an appearance on I'm A Celebrity the following year quickly materialising.\nIn September 2020, it was announced that she would be competing in the thirteenth series of Dancing on Ice in 2021.\nShe was partnered with Andy Buchanan and was eliminated in the sixth week.\nThe WAG was clearly the pretender to Coleen Rooney's throne too, appearing in faithful fashion wearing an England shirt as Jamie turned out, alongside Wayne Rooney, during the 2018 World Cup.\nMeanwhile she made regular appearances in the media, often appearing on Loose Women to discuss her love life.\nHOME\nANNIE\nAnnie lives with her husband Kyle and their children in a six-bedroom home set in leafy Prestbury, Cheshire, which is valued at £3.5million\nThe property in Prestbury, Cheshire, hosts a football-themed games room and six bedrooms, as well as a huge swimming pool with an indoor waterfall\nLand Registry documents show that Annie and school sweetheart Kyle bought their six bedroom house complete with five a side football pitch in 2019 soon after he moved to Manchester City.\nThe property in Prestbury, Cheshire, hosts a football-themed games room and six bedrooms, including a two-storey master suite with separate ladies' and gentlemen's dressing rooms.\nIt also reportedly features a giant fish tank and a gym with an orange pool table, a family dining area, a sitting room and a large dining room.\nThe home once featured on a special edition of Come Dine With Me when it was owned by fellow City football Stephen Ireland, with his wife Jessica appearing on the programme.\nEstate agents have deemed the house - which backs on to Wayne Rooney's former home - as 'exceptional in many ways'.\n'The quality of presentation is astounding, with individually sourced wall and floor coverings, fantastic quality fixtures and fittings and artistic flourishes which contribute to creating a unique home,' a description continued.\n'The property is as well suited to entertaining as for family use and the great flow of the accommodation means there are areas away from the main family space if needed.'\nREBEKAH\nRebekah has frequently given her 389,000 followers on Instagram an insight into the lavish home she shares with her Leicester City striker husband\nWorking out: Becky regularly posts pictures from during and after her workout in the huge home gym\nRebekah has frequently given her 389,000 followers on Instagram an insight into the lavish home she shares with her Leicester City striker husband.\nThe couple, who have been married since 2016, live with their six children in the palatial house close to Leicester, where Jamie is a striker for the city's Premier League club.\nPhotos from inside the home include one of her daughters playing with makeup in Becky's massive dressing room and walk-in wardrobe, a hairdressing room, bar, a large gym and an indoor pool.\nOther photos reveal her love for all things bling, including several mirrored cabinets and dressers, a large silver sofa, a glass floor and sumptuous furnishings.\nMany of her posts feature her adorable children playing with their mountains of toys and dressed impeccably.\nAnd last year the embattled WAG won approval for a horse riding area at her and husband Jamie Vardy 's £3 million home.\nBut an application for planning permission for a new private menage - an outdoor riding enclosure - lodged just before Christmas has hit a snag as it is claimed the site is an 'area of archaeological interest'.\nThe plan was conditionally approved on Wednesday (Feb 8) - but the Vardys must carry out 'archaeological investigations…before development commences'.\nHeritage Lincolnshire claims 'the site for the proposed development lies in an area of archaeological interest,' to the south of 'earthworks remains' of a Medieval and post-Medieval settlement.\nIt comes after a fire last month destroyed their in-home gym.\nThe blaze was thought to have been sparked by an electrical fault, and luckily nobody was hurt.\nRebekah posted to Instagram following the incident, thanking the Lincolnshire fire crew and adding that 'the kiddies enjoyed the fire engines'.\nWAG PALS...\nANNIE\nAnnie, who tends to keep a low profile, appears to be on good terms with many of the WAGs within the England team - last year she spoke out in support of Coleen Rooney\nAnnie, who tends to keep a low profile, appears to be on good terms with many of the WAGs within the England team.\nLast year, she spoke out in support of Coleen Rooney amidst her court battle with Rebekah.\nShe said: 'I don't blame Coleen for doing what she did. If someone was doing that to me, I would be exposing them in the same way.'\nHowever she also said she was friends with both women, seemingly keeping a neutral ground.\nShe told The Sun: 'I'm stuck in the middle — I get on with both of them — and it's not nice to see this play out.\n'My kids are friends with Coleen's kids and I get on with Becky so I'm literally stuck in the middle.\n'If Becky was responsible for leaking stories then it's just wrong. Only she knows the truth.'\nMeanwhile, speaking of the group of England WAGS, she also said: 'We wouldn't necessarily all be friends. We were friends because of the situation.\n'You're forced to be friends so you hold back what you want to say.'\nREBEKAH\nFellow WAG Nicola McLean has seemingly thrown her support behind Rebekah several times (pictured)\nFellow WAG Nicola McLean has seemingly thrown her support behind Rebekah several times.\nNicola is married to Tom Williams, who now plays for Hashtag United of the Essex Senior League. Tom is a defender and midfielder and made nearly 300 appearances in the Football League playing for numerous clubs, including QPR and West Ham.\nDuring the Wagatha Christie trial, she once stated that Coleen is 'not as private' as she is considered while also insisting Rebekah is not interested in the fame game.\nThe I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here star, who has been married to Tom since 2009, told Closer Magazine in 2020: 'I've had different experiences at different clubs but the WAG world can be a b****y mean girls like existence...\nThere can be rivalry and unfriendliness with someone in the group and the top dog and there can be a lot of drama. It isn't just amazing holidays and designer clothes there can be a lot of behind-the-scenes politics between the girls.'\nOn some of the most famous WAGS, she went on: 'A lot of women want to emulate Victoria Beckham, Alex Gerrard, Elen Rivas - they dine out on the fact they're a WAG and it can consume you.'\nNicola then pointed out that it is not all it seems with Mrs Vardy and Mrs Rooney: 'I know some WAGs will only be interested in the hierarchy, fame and drama but I don't believe Rebekah is like that. She's not fussed about the press or limelight.\n'Everyone thinks Coleen is really private - but remember she's done countless interviews, books and even her own TV show.'\n...AND FEUDS\nANNIE\nWhile Annie tends to keep a low profile and appears to have avoided drama with fellow WAGs over the years, she has long been in an embattled feud with the mother of her husband Kyle's son (pictured with their son Kairo)\nWhile Annie tends to keep a low profile and appears to have avoided drama with fellow WAGs over the years, she has long been in an embattled feud with the mother of her husband Kyle's son.\nLauryn Goodman shared a brief romance with footballer Kyle, and they welcomed Kairo in April 2020.\nThey conceived the youngster during a short relationship amid Kyle's temporary split from Annie.\nKyle, Annie and Lauryn have had a complicated co-parenting relationship over the past few years.\nLauryn was previously targeted by Annie on Instagram Stories, when she appeared to reveal her baby's gender after she gave birth.\nTaking to her Instagram Stories, the former WAG wrote: 'FYI... it's a BOY!'\nIn another dig, Annie posted: 'A man who disrespects a loyal woman deserves a heartless h*e.'\nLauryn took to Instagram to post a reaction to Annie's remark, writing: 'This is harassment. I've just had a newborn baby and I'm dealing with this on a Sunday morning!'\nLast summer, Lauryn lashed out at Kyle after the defender unveiled a pair of bespoke football boots bearing the names of each of his children with Annie, but not Kairo.\nSharing a picture of Kyle's new boots, she wrote: 'In a time where mental health has been at the forefront showing the implications and damages it can cause. Your 'fathers' latest post has absolutely shocked not only me, but everyone to the core.\n'Things posted to the internet are there forever and Kairo has been abused by you & your partner for far too long. He is 1 years old. He is an INNOCENT baby. No matter anyone's opinion on me. Kairo has done NOTHING & he does not deserve any of this let alone publicly.'\nShe added: 'I speak for the many women that are silenced. Believe me when I say, there are SO many more women in my situation. More than you could ever imagine and a LOT of women have dm'd me finding comfort in me not being silenced. They praise me for standing my own ground and not hiding Kairo.\n'Why should he be hidden? To give you a quiet life? Never. There is keeping him private for his own protection (which is needed after the lies & stories that have been sold from your partner) and then there is ignoring his existence. The latter will never happen. He is not going anywhere. Get used to it.\n'Kairo Walker. You chose me to be your mum. To fight your corner. I've got you son. I will NEVER let you down. Ps @pumafootball called they decided to have some morals & correct your boots .. (they should morally remove those current boots.)'\nAnd in April, she took a swipe at the footballer after he was recently caught urinating on the wall of a £260-a-night hotel some 24 hours after his side lost in the FA Cup semi-final to Liverpool at Wembley Stadium.\nShe quipped that their son 'isn't the only one who needs to be potty trained' after news emerged of the incident.\nHorrified guests caught Kyle urinating on the hotel wall instead of using toilets inside after he was spotted in a beer garden.\nREBEKAH\nRebekah's most famous - and worst - feud came in the form of her court battle with Coleen Rooney last year (pictured, Coleen at court)\nHowever the drama also exposed other cracks within the WAG community - including a row between Rebekah and Danielle Lloyd\nRebekah's most famous - and worst - feud came in the form of her court battle with Coleen Rooney last year.\nHowever the drama also exposed other cracks within the WAG community - including a row between Rebekah and Danielle Lloyd.\nDanielle branded Rebekah Vardy 'a rat' over a text message to Coleen, court documents released during the trial revealed.\nThe slur was allegedly sent in response to a message posted on Coleen's private Instagram account, shortly before she named Rebekah as 'the mole leaking stories to the press.'\nAs reported by The Sun, Danielle texted: 'She is rat feel ashamed for her.'\nDanielle was said to be 'furious' after being dragged into the 'Wagatha Christie' court battle, MailOnline revealed in December 2020.\nVardy's 59-page legal document filed at the time said Lloyd and fellow WAG Dawn Ward were both privy to information on Coleen's private Instagram account.\nBut a source close to Danielle said she was 'angry' and 'hurt' that Rebekah identified her in legal papers submitted to the High Court.\nHer lawyer Tony Nelson told MailOnline at the time: 'Danielle does not want anything to do with this, she does not want to be dragged into the matter.\n'She's got four young children and more important things to concentrate on. She's not surprised that she's been dragged into this but she doesn't want to play any part in it. Danielle fully supports her friend Coleen.'\nEven before the Wagatha Christie drama, Rebekah appeared to try to distance herself from the world of the WAGs.\nShe told Closer magazine she had vowed not to make friends with his teammates' wives and girlfriends 'just because their partners are on the same team'.\nShe said: 'I've learnt not to rise to what people saw. Before, I would feed their fire and now I don't.\n'Unless it's something I feel strongly about that should be highlighted - then I'll put it out there and say how I feel.\n'Just because I'm Jamie's wife, doesn't define who I am. It doesn't define all the other wives and who they are.\n'There are some people who are part of the WAG community and that's not me. It's a very fake world...\n'When you're forced into friendships or forced to become friends with someone because your husbands [play together], it's weird.\n'I don't buy into fake friends. I won't be friends with someone because their husband plays for the same team'.",
