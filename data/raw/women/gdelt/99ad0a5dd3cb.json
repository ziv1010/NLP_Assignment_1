  "body_text": "WAFCON-bound Nigeria cruised past Cameroon’s Indomitable Lionesses in a friendly match yesterday at the MKO Abiola Sports Complex in Abeokuta.\nCaptain Rasheedat Ajibade was the star of the match, scoring both goals. She opened the scoring in the 28th minute from the penalty spot, then added a second in the 43rd minute, finishing off a swift team move assisted by Rinsola Babajide.\nSuper Falcons head coach Justine Madugu described the win as a major psychological boost as his team intensifies preparations for the 13th Women’s Africa Cup of Nations, scheduled to take place in Morocco from July 5 to 26.\nNigeria will be chasing a record-extending 10th title, having already won the competition nine times since its inception in 1998. The team also won in 1991 and 1995, when the tournament served as a qualifying series for the FIFA Women’s World Cup.\nMeanwhile, a two-day FIFA Club Professionalisation and Management Programme workshop commenced on Tuesday in Abuja, with Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) President, Alhaji Ibrahim Musa Gusau (MON), encouraging participants to fully engage in the sessions to enhance their capacity and improve Nigeria’s domestic football landscape.\n“The NFF has been intentional in urging clubs to work towards financial sustainability and to contribute meaningfully to a thriving football ecosystem,” Gusau stated in a message delivered by NFF General Secretary, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi (MON).\nHe added that club football and league systems are critical to the growth of a nation’s sport, noting that meaningful contributions to Nigeria’s GDP can come from the value clubs generate through direct and indirect income.\nThe workshop gathered chairmen and CEOs from all 20 Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) clubs, as well as executives from the NPFL, Nigeria National League (NNL), Nigeria Women Football League (NWFL), and Nationwide League One (NLO).\nThe NPFL Chairman, Hon. Gbenga Elegbeleye, who is also the NFF 2nd Vice President, was represented by NPFL Vice Chairman, Alhaji Mohammed Nasir Saidu.\nTuesday’s sessions focused on strategic planning and finance, while Wednesday’s will cover governance, as well as commercial and marketing strategies.\nUPDATE NEWS:\nNigerians can now invest ₦2.5 million on premium domains and profit about ₦17-₦25 million.
