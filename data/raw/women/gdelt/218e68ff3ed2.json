These decisions need time and care as there is a lot of people affected and a lot of club history to consider.\"\nAs well as the path being clear for Kyneton to join the RDFNL - becoming the league's 10th club - the Tigers have also announced Ethan Foreman as their new senior coach.\nClassy forward/mid Foreman is no stranger to the RDFNL having played with Riddell in 2019.\nForeman, who came through the junior ranks at the Tigers and has played more than 100 senior games for the club, was part of Gisborne's 2022 premiership team before rejoining Kyneton this year.\nAlso a former Bendigo Pioneer, Foreman took on the added responsibility of coaching Kyneton's under-18s this year.\n\"After creating an amazing environment for our under 18's boys as a mentor and a mate, he demonstrated his outstanding leadership skills throughout the year, in particular through a very challenging time for the Kyneton and Castlemaine communities,\" the Tigers said in announcing Foreman's appointment.\nThe Tigers had been coached for the last six games of the season by club legend Darren Chambers, who stepped in on an interim basis in place of Paul Chapman.\nKyneton leaving the BFNL ends a chapter for the club that stretches back to 1932 when the Tigers first played in the league.\nThe Tigers won six senior flags in the BFNL - 1936, 1960, 1961, 1966, 1995 and 1997.\nThe Tigers already have a connection with the RDFNL through their senior women's and junior teams.\nBoth the Tigers' junior teams and senior women's side competed in Riddell District league competitions this season after being transferred from AFLCV-run leagues.\n\"We're hoping this move provides a sustainable future for our club, fair and equitable competition, and an enhanced experience for all our players of which a significant majority have indicated their preference to move to RDFNL,\" the Tigers wrote to their members in outlining their intention to move leagues on the eve of their round 18 game against Strathfieldsaye.\n\"As committee members entrusted with the fiduciary responsibility of managing the club on behalf of the members and to make critical decisions in the best interest of the club and players, this decision was not made lightly and comes after careful consideration by our club's leadership.\"\nThe Tigers listed seven key reasons behind their decision to seek a move away from the BFNL to join the RDFNL:\n- Voice of the players.\n- Ability to compete.\n- Financial burden.\n- Player retention and numbers.\n- Community feedback an career pathways for players.\n- RDFNL culture, governance and financial advantage.\n- One club: \"together we are strong\".\nOur journalists work hard to provide local, up-to-date news to the community.
