  "body_text": "Starmer: I’m fiercely protective of my children and will never use them in photo ops\nSir Keir Starmer has said he is “fiercely protective” of his children and will never use them in photo opportunities.\nThe Labour leader and Victoria, his wife, have not publicly named their son, 15, and daughter, 13, in an attempt to protect their privacy.\nThis is a very impactful time and that’s why we’re fiercely protective of them and we will continue to be,” Sir Keir said in an interview with ITV on Thursday night.\n“So, don’t expect any photos of us with the children or using the children in any way to campaign.”\nHe added: “We never use their names in public, that seems a bit odd and it means that I’m unable to show how I am with my children.\n“My boy’s 15, my girl’s 13, it’s quite an impactful age. It’s the only thing I really worry about [during] this election.”\nSir Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Lord Cameron, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak all posed outside Downing Street with their children when they were prime minister.\nSir Keir’s wife is also expected to shun the spotlight if he wins the election, continuing in her job in the NHS.\nIn the wide-ranging 30-minute interview, Sir Keir also became emotional as he talked about his late mother, who had Still’s disease and died in 2015.\n“I would just love to say I love you,” he said, his eyes welling up. “I would love her to see me now, she’d be very proud.\n“But tragically, she died just two and a bit weeks before I became an MP, so she never saw that and I’d just like her to have seen a bit of that and I’d like her to see my kids.”\nWhen asked about his faith, Sir Keir said he was christened as an infant but that he is not a believer.\nHe said his wife is Jewish and that they and their two children attend synagogue and also do Friday night prayers with Lady Victoria’s father and sister.\n“I do profoundly believe in faith across all religions,” Sir Keir said. “I think it’s a force for good, a way of bringing the country together.”\nThe Labour leader later said that he “understands” the “impact” of the two-child benefit cap, which he has not committed to abolishing if he wins the general election.\nBut he said he would not make “hypothetical promises”.\n“I don’t want to leave you with the impression that I do not understand just how important this is the impact of the, of the cap and my sheer determination to drive down child poverty,” he said.\nSir Keir also faced questions about what reforms a Labour government would make to social care.\nHe said it would take “five years or more” for the party’s changes to come into effect.\n“It’s a very serious proposition. It’s going to take time.”\nThis blog is now closed. Follow today’s General Election updates in our latest live blog.\n10:00 PM BST\nThat’s all for today\nThank you for following The Telegraph’s live coverage of the general election campaign.\nMy colleague Dominic Penna will be with you tomorrow morning to guide you through all the latest developments.\n09:41 PM BST\nReform activist’s Sunak slur ‘horrible’, says Farage\nNigel Farage has said the racial slur used against Rishi Sunak by a Reform UK activist was “horrible”.\nSpeaking to Channel 4 News, the party leader said: “It was horrible. It was horrible.”\nAsked why he was not apologising, Mr Farage replied: “How much further can I go? Of course it’s an apology. I don’t know who this bloke is. Someone I met once years ago. I mean awful, horrible, horrible.\n“Almost as bad as the Labour candidate in Clacton and his slurs on white people. Have you covered that?”\n09:18 PM BST\nConservatives are ‘climate deniers’, claims Flynn\nStephen Flynn has claimed that the Conservatives are “climate deniers”.\nThe SNP’s Westminster leader said on BBC Question Time: “In Scotland, we’ve got an abundance of offshore wind potential, green hydrogen potential, carbon capture potential.\n“The future is bright and the future is green, but to make that happen, we need a Westminster system that wants to invest in green energy.\n“The Tories are climate deniers. They’re not interested in climate change at all.”\nAndrew Mitchell, the deputy foreign secretary, reacted with bemusement to the remark, later saying he believed climate change was an “existential threat”.\n09:03 PM BST\nI want to be Prime Minister for a decade, Starmer says\nSir Keir Starmer has said he wants to be Prime Minister for a decade.\nAsked whether he would lead Britain throughout the “decade of national renewal” he has promised to deliver, the Labour leader said: “Oh I want to see that through. It’s my phrase.”\nSir Keir added: “A decade indicates how long I think it’s going to take for the fundamental change which will see a country transformed.\n“And that years later, people will be able to look back and say that was a real game changing government.”\nAsked if being Prime Minister at 71 would be too difficult, he said: “Well you know, I’m still playing football every week, managing 90 minutes. I’ve been playing since I was 10 years old. So these knees have been through a lot of games.”\n09:02 PM BST\n‘Divisive’ Farage has no serious answers to Britain’s problems, says Starmer\nNigel Farage is “divisive” and has “no serious answers” to Britain’s problems, Sir Keir Starmer has said.\nSpeaking in an ITV interview, the Labour leader said: “I wouldn’t say [he is] not serious. But I don’t think he’s got serious answers to the questions the country is facing.”\nAsked if Mr Farage was a “divisive” figure, Sir Keir said: “Yes, I do think he’s divisive because he tends to pick and choose between people and divide people.”\n08:58 PM BST\nLabour will take ‘five years or more’ to reform care, Starmer admits\nSir Keir Starmer has admitted that Labour will take “five years or more” to reform care.\n“It will take a number of years to set up because it has to be done properly,” he said in an ITV interview. “At least the first term of a Labour government.”\nPaul Brand, the interviewer, interjected: “So five years to build serious reform?”\nSir Keir continued: “No, well, five years or more to get this right.”\nHe added: “It’s a very serious proposition. It’s going to take time.”\n08:55 PM BST\nStarmer: The two-child benefit cap is bad but I won’t scrap it\nSir Keir Starmer has said he “understands” the damage done by the two-child benefit cap but that he will not commit to scrapping it.\n“I don’t want to get ahead of myself and make hypothetical promises,” the Labour leader said.\n“But I don’t want to leave you with the impression that I do not understand just how important this is the impact of the, of the cap and my sheer determination to drive down child poverty.\n“We’ve done it before. We will do it again.”\n08:53 PM BST\nWealth creation ‘single most important thing’ to Labour, Starmer claims\nWealth creation will be “the single most important thing” to a Labour government, Sir Keir Starmer has said.\n“Look, it’s a little odd in some respects to have a Labour leader saying that wealth creation is the number one mission of a Labour government,” Sir Keir said in an ITV interview.\n“But I think that it’s the single most important thing and I genuinely think that working with business, we can get you know, the stability that we need, the investment that we need and reform the economy so that it works for more people across the country because it certainly doesn’t work at the moment.”\n08:45 PM BST\nStarmer: I will never use my children in photo ops\nSir Keir Starmer has said he is “fiercely protective” of his children and will not put them in the media spotlight if he is Britain’s next Prime Minister.\n“We are, you know, absolutely fiercely protective of the children,” the Labour leader said in an interview on ITV. “So we don’t have pictures of the children taken with us. We never use their names in public, that seems a bit odd.\n“And it means that I’m unable to show how I am with my children. My boy’s 15, my girl’s 13, it’s quite an impactful age.\n“It’s the only thing I really worry about about this election. If they were under five, I think they’d probably take it in their stride, probably wouldn’t notice too much.”\nSir Keir added: “This is a very impactful time and that’s why we’re fiercely protective of them and we will continue to be. So, don’t expect any photos of us with the children or using the children in any way to campaign.”\n08:44 PM BST\nTice says Reform activist’s slur was ‘inappropriate’\nRichard Tice has said the Reform UK activist who used a racial slur to describe Rishi Sunak made “inappropriate” remarks.\nThe party chairman said: “We put a statement out and it’s all self-explanatory in the statement.\n“The reality is that we’re a fast-growing movement, and when you’ve got unpaid volunteers, some people behave inappropriately. And they’re gone.”\n08:30 PM BST\nPublic should still vote Tory despite the betting scandal, says minister\nThe public should vote Conservative despite the election betting scandal, the deputy foreign secretary has said.\nAsked if the Conservatives can still be trusted, Andrew Mitchell said: “I greatly regret what we have heard about this betting scandal in the last week, but you should vote because there are real differences between the Labour Party and the Conservative Party, and indeed the other parties as well.”\nHe added: “Everyone says that, basically, we’re getting Tory – and something that Stephen would definitely say –we’re getting Tory measures administered by Labour men and women.\n“It’s not true. There is a real difference. The Conservative Party believes that you should keep as much of your income as you can and be taxed as little as possible.”\nMr Mitchell went on to say: “A majority of members of parliament on all sides are honest, decent people trying to do a good job. And if you, if you take a few bad apples, and you’ve done the whole profession on that basis, you will not increase trust in politics.”\n08:19 PM BST\nFlynn: Austerity to blame for knife crime\nAusterity is to blame for knife crime among young people, the SNP’s Stephen Flynn has claimed.\nSpeaking on BBC One’s Question Time, Mr Flynn said: “We’re talking a lot about how you respond to someone with a knife, or how you punish someone who does something bad, when, in actual fact, what we should probably be talking about is why this is happening in the first place.\n“It’s because the fabric within society has been broken by 14 years of austerity, because of the fact that money has been stripped out of the public services that each and every one of you relies upon, because of the fact that our young people don’t have the hope that they should have for their future.\n“So they respond in a way which is filled with anger instead of optimism.”\n08:15 PM BST\n‘Mental health’ driving youth knife crime, Lib Dem claims\nYoung people’s “mental health” is driving an increase in knife crime, Layla Moran has claimed.\nThe Liberal Democrat told BBC Question Time: “What is causing a young person to feel that they need to go out with a knife?\n“It’s in part fear. It’s in part deteriorating mental health in young people.\n“So what I know works in areas where I’ve been an MP are youth services where it’s not just about a room, it’s where you’ve got youth workers who are on the streets getting to know those young people in their own backyards, who can then divert them on.”\n08:09 PM BST\n‘Comprehensive’ action needed on knife crime, says Cooper\nYvette Cooper has said “comprehensive” action is needed to tackle knife crime.\nLabour’s shadow home secretary said on BBC Question Time: “It can’t just be a few token measures here and there. It has to be comprehensive.\n“It does have to involve more police on the streets, and we have set out a plan for 13,000 more neighbourhood police.\n“But it also has to mean there are proper consequences for carrying knives. There has to be a mandatory referral to the youth offending teams. Too often, there are just no consequences.”\n07:53 PM BST\nReform UK’s challenge ‘even bigger than achieving Brexit’, says Farage\nThe challenge facing Reform UK is “even bigger” than achieving Brexit, Nigel Farage has said.\n“In some ways, what we’re attempting here is even bigger than leaving the European Union,” the Reform leader said.\n“This is about turning around the way our country is governed. It’s about a ruling class governed, not governed, but working hand in glove with the media.\n“These guys don’t want change. It’s a case of, I’m all right Jack and the rest of you can go to hell, and we don’t need to worry about you because you’ll never really going to cause us any problems.\n“Well, you know what, I think we should cause them the biggest problems they have seen in modern times. I think we should stand up and fight for what is right. I think we have an opportunity, on July 4 to make the first important step to turning our country around.”\n07:46 PM BST\nFarage: Reform candidate scandals ‘nothing’ compared to Tory betting\nReform UK’s candidate selection scandals are nothing compared to the “betting ring that is the modern day Conservative Party”, Nigel Farage has said.\nSpeaking at a rally in Boston, Lincolnshire, he said: “We understand that in some cases, one or two people have let us down and we let them go.\n“But compare that to the international price fixing and betting ring that is the modern day Conservative Party.\n“I mean, it is astonishing, isn’t it? Every day that goes by we learn of more officials that bet on the date of an early election.\n“This is corruption. This is greed. This is self entitlement. This is arrogance on a level that I can scarcely believe.”\n07:44 PM BST\nChannel migration an ‘invasion’, Farage says\nNigel Farage has said the small boats crisis is an “invasion”.\nSpeaking about remarks he made in 2020 warning about illegal migration across the English Channel, the Reform UK leader said: “I warned that, unless things changed, there may well be an invasion.\n“How dare I? How dare I? Oh, gosh, what a terrible chap that Farage is.\n“To use a word like invasion on the BBC, I mean, goodness gracious me.\n“And yet, 4,000 boats and 128,000 people later, if it’s not an invasion, what the hell is it? What the hell is it?”\n07:36 PM BST\nTories need to overhaul election communications, says Badenoch\nKemi Badenoch has said the Conservatives need to overhaul their election communications to attract younger votes.\nThe business secretary told The Times: “The way we communicate needs to be updated for the 2020s and beyond. The [messaging] doesn’t quite work.\n“People hear about pensions and triple lock and people under-65 don’t think it’s relevant to them. We need to have a broader conversation.”\n07:27 PM BST\nSunak ‘more dishonest than any politician since Blair’, says Farage\nRishi Sunak was “more dishonest” than any politician since Sir Tony Blair, Nigel Farage has said.\nSpeaking at a rally in Boston, Lincolnshire, the Reform UK leader said: “We’ve got Rishi. So energetic, like a teenager who’s gone to meet the prospective parents in law.\n“Trying to do his best and be his best and to be oh so sincere but coming out with more spin and more dishonesty than any politician since Tony Blair, in my opinion. Slippery Rishi.”\n07:22 PM BST\nSunak: Starmer will be ‘at back of room’ at Nato summit\nSir Keir Starmer would be at “the back of the room” at the Nato summit from July 9 to 11 if he is elected Prime Minister on July 4, Rishi Sunak has said.\nMr Sunak took aim at Sir Keir’s failure to match the Conservatives’ pledge to spend 2.5 per cent of GDP on defence by 2030.\n“That means defence spending is going to go down from the plans that we’ve got in place, which are already happening with more money going to the armed forces,” Mr Sunak said.\n“He’ll be at the back of the room. But what does that do? What message does that send to our adversaries, to China, to North Korea, to Russia, Iran?\n“Here’s a new prime minister who says, no, no, I don’t think it’s important to invest more in our country’s defence. I am deeply worried about what that means. People should be deeply concerned.”\n07:11 PM BST\nStarmer cannot be allowed to lead, Sunak warns\nRishi Sunak has warned that Sir Keir Starmer “cannot lead” Britain because he “changes his mind” every five seconds.\n“This is a guy who can’t tell you what he wants to do if he’s Prime Minister,” Mr Sunak told GB News.\n“He wants to have the most important job in our country without going to tell you what he would do with it and on any position that he has taken in the last few years, he changes his mind five seconds later. That’s not leadership.\n“And I can tell you, in the uncertain times that we live in, the things you have to grapple with as Prime Minister, if you don’t have the courage of your convictions, if you constantly change your mind, if you’re not straight with people about what you want to do, you cannot lead.”\n07:09 PM BST\nSunak doubles down on calling Labour’s policies ‘surrender’\nRishi Sunak has doubled down on his use of “surrender” to describe Labour’s policies.\nAsked on GB News if it was a “loaded” word, the Prime Minister said: “I don’t want people to surrender to Labour.\n“I don’t want them to surrender to their tax rises. I don’t want people to surrender our borders to Labour, our welfare system to Labour, our national security to Labour, right?\n“I’m up for the fight. I want people to join me in that fight. We should not surrender our country to this.”\n07:05 PM BST\nStarmer blames media and politicians’ private education for VAT furore\nSir Keir Starmer has said an “element” of the backlash to his plan to impose VAT on private school fees is because many politicians and journalists were themselves educated privately.\nIn a Sky News interview, Sophy Ridge asked the Labour leader: “Do you think that some of the backlash against it has been because there’s so many people in Westminster and in the media who either went to private school or send their children there?”\nHe replied: “I think there’s an element of that.\n“But parents across the country say to me, if they’ve got children in private school, that they’re concerned about it, and I go through the reason why we’re doing it with them, explain to them that schools don’t have to pass it on to them.”\n06:52 PM BST\nIn pictures: Campaign round up\n06:33 PM BST\nTugendhat twice declines to rule out running for Tory leadership\nTom Tugendhat has twice refused to rule out running to become leader of the Conservatives after the general election.\nThe security minister told ITV News on Thursday: “Well the first thing to do is win this leadership race.”\nAsked a second time if he had leadership ambitions, he replied: “What I’m ruling in is winning the next general election by offering fantastic candidates.”\nThe Telegraph reported last week that Mr Tugendhat is expected to run for the leadership if a contest is triggered next month by defeat in the election.\n06:27 PM BST\nWatch: Channel 4 News’s Clacton investigation\nEXCLUSIVE: We've gone undercover inside Nigel Farage's Reform UK campaign in Clacton and found evidence of anti-migrant rhetoric, homophobia and one canvasser making racist and offensive remarks.

They will no longer be with the campaign.\nThe appalling sentiments expressed by some in these exchanges bear no relation to my own views, those of the vast majority of our supporters or Reform UK policy. Some of the language used was reprehensible.\nReform UK is a party for everybody who believes in Britain. I am proud that our supporters, candidates and national campaign team come from all backgrounds and identities.\nI would be interested to know whether Channel 4 is subjecting the grassroots volunteers of all the political parties to similar subterfuges, or whether Reform UK has been singled out for special attention.\nFor instance, have they covered the grotesquely racist social media post by Labour’s candidate in Clacton who has now apparently been banished to the Midlands?\nJust one week before polling day, we will not allow this to distract us from our mission to give voters a real alternative to the establishment parties that have broken Britain.\n06:20 PM BST\nReform activist called Rishi Sunak a ‘f---ing P---’ in racial slur, investigation reveals\nA volunteer Reform UK canvasser has been filmed calling Rishi Sunak a “f---ing P---” by an undercover reporter.\nChannel 4 News filmed the remarks in Clacton, where Nigel Farage is running to be MP, by Andrew Parker.\n“I’ve always been a Tory voter,” he said. “But what annoys me is that f---ing P--- we’ve got in. What good is he? You tell me, you know. He’s just wet. F---ing useless.”\nIn a statement, Mr Parker said: “I would like to make it clear that neither Nigel Farage personally or the Reform Party are aware of my personal views on immigration.”\nHe added: “I would therefore like to apologise profusely to Nigel Farage and the Reform Party if my personal views have reflected badly on them and brought them into disrepute as this was not my intention.\nMr Farage said: “I am dismayed by the reported comments of a handful of people associated with my local campaign, particularly those who are volunteers. They will no longer be with the campaign.”\n06:17 PM BST\nTories have ‘one week to save Britain from Labour’, says Sunak\nRishi Sunak has said that the Conservatives have “one week to save Britain from a Labour government”, Genevieve Holl-Allen reports.\nThe Prime Minister told activists in Leeds: “A Labour government that would raise everyone’s taxes by £2,000, that would shunt our politics to the left, that would change the rules so that they are in power for decades.\n“We can’t let Britain sleepwalk into that. It is our job, it is our duty over the next week to wake people up to that.”\n05:37 PM BST\nStarmer visits Macclesfield pub\nSir Keir Starmer has arrived at a pub near Macclesfield, Cheshire, for his final campaign visit of the day.\nThe Labour leader is giving a speech in its garden, surrounded by supporters carrying red placards emblazoned with the word “change”.\nHe urged people who want change to “vote for it”.\n“We are campaigning with a smile on our face and a spring in our step,” he said, adding: “it really feels like a summer of change”.\n05:26 PM BST\nConservatives the wrong ‘class’ to run Britain, says Lammy\nThe Conservatives are the wrong “class” to run Britain and have a “public-school smallness”, David Lammy has said.\nThe shadow foreign secretary said Boris Johnson, Lord Cameron and James Cleverly had a “casual frippery” about them when he attended Trooping the Colour alongside them on June 15\n“There was a sort of demob happiness about them, a sort of casual frippery, a certain kind of public-school smallness,” he told the New Statesman.\n“They are not the class of people that Britain needs to run it now, and that’s what my own life story tells me.\n“The Labour Party is full of people – Angela Rayner, for instance; I was with her yesterday, campaigning in Mansfield – she gets this.”\n05:08 PM BST\n‘No evidence’ Labour’s VAT raid will shut private schools, Starmer claims\nSir Keir Starmer has claimed there is “no evidence” that private schools will be forced to close because of Labour’s planned VAT raid.\n“I think they will adapt,” he told Sophy Ridge on Sky News in an interview due to be broadcast at 7pm.\n“They’ve had lots of increases in costs over the last 14 years, and they’ve accommodated it.\n“There’s no evidence to show these schools will close. They don’t have to pass the cost on to parents.”\n05:04 PM BST\nPictured: Sunak visits train company\n04:56 PM BST\nAsk Tim Stanley and Dominic Penna anything\nThe Telegraph’s Tim Stanley and Dominic Penna are answering your questions on our election Q&A live blog from 5pm to 6pm.\nTo put your thoughts to them, go to the comments section of the live blog here.\n04:52 PM BST\nStop being so hard on England, Starmer urges supporters\nSir Keir Starmer has urged England supporters to stop being so hard on Gareth Southgate’s team and show them support to “get them over the line”.\nAsked whether he thought the squad had come in for too much criticism, the Labour leader said: “Too much criticism, get behind them, get them over the line.\n“This is a really important competition. England always do a bit of this at the beginning of competitions. Get behind the team – it’s a full squad of players who’ve all had fantastic seasons for their respective clubs. Just get behind the team.”\n04:44 PM BST\nVote Reform, get SNP, says Ross\nThe leader of the Scottish Conservatives has said that voting Reform UK in seats where the Tories are in a tight fight with the Scottish National Party (SNP) will risk nationalist victory.\nDouglas Ross said: “What we’ve also seen in polls over the last few days is how close a number of these constituencies are going to be between the Scottish Conservatives and the SNP.\n“It could come down to a few hundred votes either way. If people are thinking about supporting smaller parties – like Labour, the Liberal Democrats or Reform – they risk electing an SNP politician.”\n04:36 PM BST\nStarmer attacks Conservatives over surrender advert\nSir Keir Starmer has said a new advert from the Conservatives depicting a man, woman and child with their hands up and urging voters not to “surrender” to Labour is “desperate stuff”.\nAsked about the advert, Sir Keir told reporters on the campaign trail: “This is really desperate stuff and I’m surprised by it.\n“I think it underlines the difference between the two campaigns. They are running a very negative campaign, nothing about the future of the country.\n“I’m very happy to be the candidate going into the final week who is putting forward a more positive case for the change the country needs.”\nI will never stop fighting for this country. pic.twitter.com/jNB44Ct0at\n— Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) June 27, 2024\n04:30 PM BST\nBadenoch compares Labour’s race reforms to apartheid South Africa\nKemi Badenoch has compared Labour’s plans for a Race Equality Act to apartheid in South Africa, writes Political Reporter Genevieve Holl-Allen.\nThe business secretary accused Sir Keir Starmer of having a “morally repellent” plan to force businesses into “classifying your workforce by race” through the new act, which would enshrine in law equal pay rights for black people, Asians and other ethnic minorities.\nSpeaking at the British Chambers of Commerce Global Annual Conference, Ms Badenoch said the legislation “will be used to work out what people of different ethnicities should be paid”.\n“I think classifying your workforce by race and having this influence their salaries is morally repellent,” she said.\n“It’s what they did in apartheid South Africa and what they do now in China and Myanmar.”\nMs Badenoch added that Labour envisions an economy where the party “micro-manages your business to meet their political objectives”, including “the divisive agenda of identity politics”.\n04:07 PM BST\nReform drops candidate over BNP membership\nReform UK has dropped a candidate who appeared on a leaked list of British National Party (BNP) members.\nNigel Farage’s party on Thursday withdrew its support from Raymond Saint, who is standing in Basingstoke, after The Guardian revealed he was named on a list of BNP members published by WikiLeaks in 2009.\nWhen approached by the newspaper, Mr Saint said: “I don’t wish to discuss it, thank you.”\nReform said Mr Saint had failed to declare his BNP membership.\nA party spokesman said: “As Nigel Farage has repeatedly made plain, people who belong or used to belong to the BNP are not welcome in the Reform UK party.”\n04:01 PM BST\nSunak claims 150k voters could wipe out Labour’s poll lead\nRishi Sunak has claimed that just 150,000 voters could wipe out Labour’s lead in the polls if they back the Conservatives instead of Sir Keir Starmer.\nSpeaking to Christopher Hope on GB News in an interview due to be broadcast at 7pm, the Prime Minister said: “I’d say to everyone watching ‘those polls aren’t destiny’. People watching can make the difference.”\nHe added: “There’s other research that just shows it’s something like 150,000 voters in key places will make the difference.\n“Those are the people that will be watching, right? If you’re watching this show right now, you can make the difference.\n“I get people’s frustrations with me, with the party. We haven’t got everything right. I know that we haven’t made as much progress as we would have liked, but this is an important election about your future.\n“You do not want Labour in charge with that blank cheque to do what they want for your family finances?

It’s pretty questionable.\n“I would like to feel some sympathy for the Prime Minister, but I don’t really because he was in favour of two of the biggest errors in modern British politics.\n“I debated with him once saying that we shouldn’t have Boris Johnson as leader because he was a moral vacuum.

And that is why there has been a long standing and strong relationship between Labour and the Bangladeshi community here.”\nHe added: “The reference in the debate the other day, was an example of a country that is considered safe as far as asylum concerns and one of the countries that actually has a returns agreement with us.\n“That is actually a good thing that we and Bangladesh should be proud of that we have this returns agreement.

And I called it the people’s army and we beat the establishment.\n“We now face an even bigger and tougher job. Be in no doubt, every single vote for Reform and every single elected Reform member is going to be the voice of opposition for the next five years. I urge people vote with your heart. Vote for what you believe in. Don’t vote for one of the other two because you think they’re ‘less bad’ than the other lot.\n“With me, whether you like me or not, you’ll get a leader who is consistent, a leader who doesn’t change, a leader who’s got principles, a leader who’s prepared to tell the truth even if it’s at a certain moment in time.”\nHe concluded: “Just agreeing is not enough. We have to restructure, we have to build an organisation across this country that has branches and has roots. We have to mobilise, we have to organise. Once we’ve done that, we’ll be able to energise. I know there is a silent majority of people out there who in their hearts feel the same way that we do. This is but the first step of a very big and a very important journey. Don’t just agree, join us, help us, spread the message, do what you can.

After all, Starmer himself can’t even tell you what a woman is. I mean I don’t know, some people think a woman can have a penis. I’m just not one of them, are you?”\n12:53 PM BST\nFarage defends Putin and Ukraine remarks\nNigel Farage said “all I did alone was to predict what would happen” in relation to his comments about Vladimir Putin and Ukraine conflict, which prompted a row last week.\n“Equally, unlike Labour or Conservatives, I said on day one of the Iraq War what is your long-term goal? What is your exit strategy? And do you know what, they never, ever had one.\n“And in Libya in 2012 when Cameron decides to go to war with Libya, with full support from the Labour party, I was the one saying this is madness, total madness. And you know before the Libyan war, Isis didn’t even exist. We helped create Isis, we are absolutely idiotic when it came to these things. And there were no small boats crossing the Mediterranean before the Libyan war and the knock-on here.\n“I would put myself up on foreign policy against any of these people. I have got the track record of being right.”\n12:43 PM BST\nLockdowns were Britain’s biggest ever peacetime mistake, says Farage\nThe second and third Covid lockdowns were the biggest ever mistake made by a British government in peacetime, Nigel Farage has said.\nThe Reform UK leader was speaking to 1,000 people at the Rainton Arena which is in the constituency of Houghton and Sunderland South, currently represented by Labour’s Bridget Phillipson.\nMr Farage told the rally: “The Tories say we’re in economic trouble because of the pandemic. But hang on, you didn’t need to lock us down for a second and a third time.\n“You didn’t need to take away our freedoms in a way that weren’t even done during World War Two and all of it with Labour support.\n“I actually believe the long-term economic and psychological damage from lockdowns two and three perhaps represents the biggest mistake any British government, supported by the opposition, has ever made in peacetime.”\nHe went on to say he treated the second and third lockdowns with “contempt”.\n12:41 PM BST\nFarage rails against Mordaunt and Rayner ‘catfight’\nNigel Farage said the North East is “perhaps the most patriotic part of the country, you believe in Britain, you believe in England”, adding there had been a “complete betrayal” of the Brexit vote and 2019 general election.\n“There are some who think that maybe I need my bumps felt but I sense something is happening out there. I sense this unease that I talked about earlier is being wiredly felt and no-one sees solutions coming from the Labour and Conservative parties.\n“I also sense what people want is not just the kind of politics you get when you put Penny Mordaunt and Angela Rayner together in a TV debate which descends into a catfight. ‘Oh look, look at them, they’re even worse than us!’ Well that’s what it is, isn’t it?\n“I think what people want is a sense of a vision and a courageous leadership to say this is where need to go, this is what we want to do.”\n12:30 PM BST\nFarage: Something about our culture directly under threat\nNigel Farage said there was an “even deeper sense of unease about what is happening in our communities”.\n“We’ve always been I think as a people far more generous and far more open-hearted to those around the world facing genuine oppression or the threat perhaps even of death. So we’ve always been kind to those communities in trouble around the world.\n“We’ve accepted absolutely since the late 1940s that immigration into Britain can be a good thing, certainly the choice of food in most of our towns is rather better as a result of it. But what has happened over the course of the last 25 years is something entirely different. It is mass migration on a level that begins not just to divide and damage communities, and potentially to set people apart from each other which is dangerous, but also I think a feeling that something about our culture is directly under threat, that sense of who we are.”\nOf Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer, he said: “In policy terms, there’s not really much to choose between them... The more they argued, the more similar they came across.”\n12:26 PM BST\nFarage: We need less woke approach to policing\nNigel Farage told supporters: “There is a growing deep sense of unease about crime on our streets, the fact that it doesn’t matter where you are, you can be in the poorest part of the country or the richest part of West London.\n“The number of young people out there now threatening people, stealing mobile phones and carrying knives makes us all wherever we live think twice, doesn’t it, about going out in the evening.\n“I am aiming this at young people... One thing they can’t understand is the way I’m connecting with the younger generation, it’s very, very exciting. Whether that’s the result of having snakes crawling all over me in the jungle or not I don’t know, but I do have the most active TikTok of any British political figure by miles.\n“It’s the younger people that now fear crime more than the middle-aged and the elderly because they want to go to music concerts, they want to go out clubbing, something for which the North East is world-renowned incidentally. And they’re deeply fearful that other young people are carrying knives. So there’s a sense of unease about that and the answer of course to that is a completely different, less woke approach to policing. And we should be executing stop and search, stop and search, stop and search.”\n12:23 PM BST\nFarage: No country has a better past than Britain\nNigel Farage told supporters: “We all have a deep sense of unease. Something is going very, very wrong with the country that we’re part of, with the country that we believe in, with the country that we want our kids and grandkids to grow up in.\n“We have spent time indoctrinating a younger generation that everything about our past is wrong. We’ve been poisoning the minds of our young people. That I think is absolutely appalling.\n“I want them to learn that whilst not everything in our history is perfect, actually there is no country in the world with a better past than us and we should be proud of those that went before us.”\n12:22 PM BST\nFarage has hired out NEC in Birmingham\nNigel Farage received a hero’s welcome from around 1,000 Reform supporters as he walked out to dramatic music at the Rainton Arena.\n“Wow, what a reception, amazing. We decided on Sunday that it was appropriate for me to come up here and quite right too, and we booked a venue and I thought well I don’t know, it’s a working day, it might be difficult to get people out in the middle of the day.\n“I thought there might be 150, 200 people, and yet with just 48 hours’ notice we’ve got 1,000 enthusiastic people here in this room.”\nMr Farage said there would be a national Reform event at the NEC in Birmingham on Sunday “and I fully expect it to be the biggest active political meeting that the country will have seen in modern times, I really do”.\n12:19 PM BST\nSunak: I’m not blind to your frustrations\nRishi Sunak has told factory staff that he is “not blind” to their frustrations, our Political Reporter Genevieve Holl-Allen reports from Derbyshire.\nThe Prime Minister then admitted that the Conservatives had “made mistakes”, but cited last night’s BBC debate and insisted Sir Keir Starmer did not have the answers, particularly on migration.\nHe said: “I’m not blind to the frustrations that you feel with me and the party”.\nHe repeated that voters should not hand Labour a “blank cheque”, adding: “Because you will not be able to get it back”.\n12:18 PM BST\n‘You could have started me on an easy piece first!’\nRishi Sunak has been taught how to dip some pottery during a visit to a factory in Derbyshire, writes Genevieve Holl-Allen.\nThe Prime Minister was shown the teapot that he was about to dip, and said “you could have started me on an easy piece first!”\nHe then dipped both a sugar pot and a teapot with some success, with the staff member telling him his skills were “pretty good actually”.\nMr Sunak then said he wanted to a take a picture to show his daughters “and tell them ‘Daddy did some pottery today’”.\n12:09 PM BST\nReform candidate: MPs should ‘hang their heads in shame’ over lockdowns\nLynn Murphy, the Reform candidate for Easington, is introducing Nigel Farage.\n“It’s been an absolutely amazing campaign up to now. I think Nigel’s brought a bit of excitement to it, don’t you think?”\nMs Murphy said there had been a “huge decline from housing, schools, a lack of police on our streets, and the list goes on”.\nShe added she “never had a lifelong dream of going into politics”, saying: “Since Covid, my attitude has changed. I watched on as we were told to stay home to save lives as politicians held gatherings. I watched my daughter struggle stuck at home, I saw my son not able to go to work...\n“Every day we had experts keeping us glued to the TV with graphs and death figures. People became scared and fearful to do the simplest of things like go to the shop. We couldn’t visit our friends and family in hospital... There was nothing you or me could do about it. The men and women of Westminster should all hang their heads in shame.”\n11:57 AM BST\nThe Economist backs Labour for first time since Blair\nThe Economist has endorsed Labour for the first time at a general election since Sir Tony Blair’s premiership.\nIn an editorial, the publication praised Sir Keir Starmer and urged its readers to support Labour at the next national poll for the first time since 2005.\nThe article reads: “No party fully subscribes to the ideas that The Economist holds dear. The economic consensus in Britain has shifted away from liberal values, free trade, individual choice and limits to state intervention.\n“But elections are about the best available choice and that is clear. If we had a vote on July 4, we, too, would pick Labour, because it has the greatest chance of tackling the biggest problem that Britain faces: a chronic and debilitating lack of economic growth.”\n11:45 AM BST\nFarage on the Tyne\nSir John Hall, the former owner of Newcastle United, has declared his support for Nigel Farage at Rainton Arena, writes Fiona Parker.\nThe 91-year-old previously donated more than £500,000 to the Conservatives during Theresa May’s snap election in 2017.\nThe former Newcastle United owner told journalists he had become a “disillusioned” Conservative supporter and that he had told the party to “get stuffed”.\n11:45 AM BST\nPints and politics at Farage arena rally\nA lengthy queue is forming at the Rainton Arena in Durham, where Nigel Farage is expected to address 1,000 people, writes Fiona Parker\nThe arena is based in the constituency of Houghton and Sunderland South, currently represented by Labour’s Bridget Phillipson.\nInside the arena, seats are filling up with local residents looking to hear from Farage.\nSpectators are making good use of the bars at the back of the room and buying both soft and alcoholic drinks - with several pints already being nursed.\nMr Farage was seen arriving at 11am and quickly went to an area guarded by security.

Keir Starmer was at his worst, ticking off his CV – toolmaker, peacemaker, prosecutor – culminating in stopping a bomb plot, as if he’s also James Bond.\nThere’s no wit there; zero poetry. A question to the effect of “why are you two so rubbish?” would have produced a joke out of Boris or a hymn to class struggle from Kinnock, but both men proved the point by falling back into grey platitudes\nTim Stanley and Tom Harris give their verdicts here\n09:34 AM BST\n‘Armageddon is upon us, and Britain will never be the same again’\nMake the most of living in Conservative Britain: Armageddon is upon us, warns Allister Heath.\nIn a little over a week, the Tory government – that last, oh-so-imperfect, infuriatingly porous roadblock to Left-wing hegemony – will have been obliterated. The removal vans, symbols of regime change, will be on their way. Parliament, the last major institution in Britain still nominally controlled by the centre-Right, will have fallen, in a wipeout without precedent.\nSir Keir Starmer will be prime minister with a crushing majority. Even in the best-case scenario for the Conservatives, never before in British history will there have been so many MPs – mostly Labour, but also Lib Dem, Plaid Cymru, Green and the diminished SNP – dedicated to one or other form of socialism or social-democracy, and so few – Tory, Reform and DUP – interested in free markets, liberty, cultural conservatism, self-government or other strands of centre-Right thinking.\nTo add insult to injury, not every residual Tory MP will even fall into the latter category: plenty will be uber-wet, with little in common with the Conservative electorate of 2024.

And I believe that where we discuss these issues.\n“And it is right that we can have an open discussion about them, that we do so in a way that is absolutely frank, but respectful, tolerant, and in keeping with the best traditions within our country.\n“I know that politicians, particularly female politicians, receive an awful lot of abuse sometimes and do frequently face that kind of language being used against them. And I don’t think it advances a more tolerant and respectful discussion.”\n08:43 AM BST\nMajority of voters found final Sunak-Starmer debate frustrating\nTwo-thirds of voters found the final TV debate of the general election campaign between Sir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak “frustrating”, according to a snap YouGov poll.\nThe Labour leader and the Prime Minister clashed during a BBC showdown last night as they each sought to gain an advantage ahead of July 4.\nA snap poll of 1,716 people conducted in the immediate aftermath of the debate found the two leaders tied 50/50 in terms of who was deemed to have performed the best.\nBut some 62 per cent said they found the debate “frustrating”. Four in 10 people - 40 per cent - said it was “interesting” and a quarter - 26 per cent said it was “engaging”.\n08:35 AM BST\nShadow education secretary: We’ll need strong regulation to save universities\nAsked what a Labour government would do about warnings that four in 10 universities will go into deficit, the shadow education secretary said she was “not getting ahead of myself”.\n“Our universities are a brilliant success story both here domestically and around the world in terms of the reach that we have.\n“And I am determined that if we are fortunate enough to form the next government, if people put our trust in us, then we will have to stabilise the sector. And we will make sure that once again our universities are treated as the engines of growth that drive so many jobs in our communities.”\nPressed on universities being on the brink of collapse, Ms Phillipson said: “The difference that a Labour government would bring is a different relationship with our universities. We will work with them to make sure that we’re driving jobs and opportunity across our country. For too long, they have been treated as a political battleground by the Conservatives. We recognise them as a public good.”\nMs Phillipson said universities were facing “massive” financial challenges, saying: “We will need to make sure that there is strong regulation in place to make sure our universities can continue into the long run. That is what the Office for Students have been looking at, as you identify. But we need to make sure that we protect them into the long run because of the important economic impact that they have in towns and cities right across our country.”\n08:30 AM BST\nPhillipson: It will be possible to negotiate returns agreements\nBridget Phillipson has insisted Labour would be able to negotiate migrant returns agreements with individual countries.\n“We believe it will be possible to negotiate returns agreements. Just because the Conservatives have failed on this, it doesn’t mean it can’t be done.”\n08:27 AM BST\nLabour: We won’t bring back free movement\nA Labour government would not bring back free movement or take the UK back into the single market or customs union, the shadow education secretary has said.\nBridget Phillipson told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There will be no return to free movement if Labour forms the next government. But what we do believe is important is that we work to get a better deal that secures jobs, that supports businesses.\n“There are frustration there that you will have heard from businesses across our country, that they want to see action taken to deal with some of the red tape that has opened up.\n“But to be absolutely clear, no return to the single market, customs union or free movement if people vote Labour on July 4.”\n08:24 AM BST\nMinister: Brexit has helped some small businesses and hurt others\nKevin Hollinrake was asked whether he believed Brexit had been beneficial for small business owners.\nMr Hollinrake, the small businesses minister, replied: “Some. For some businesses, yes, because they can now trade with other parts of the world more easily, with things like the Australia trade deal, New Zealand, the one coming up with the Pacific countries, the Gulf and India.\n“There is no doubt that for some businesses it is more difficult to trade with the European Union, there is no doubt that is the case, and we’re seeking to ease those frictions.”\nHe added: “For some businesses, particularly in the food and drink sector, particularly SMEs, they find it more difficult to trade with the European Union. That’s the reality. We have sought to ease those frictions, of course, and we want to ease them further, and the Prime Minister’s negotiation on the Windsor Framework helped with that to a large degree, particularly within the United Kingdom in terms of Northern Ireland.\n“But yes it is more difficult today. But the vote for Brexit was a vote for change, and we have to try to ease those frictions. But let’s not forget, only 10 per cent of British companies export at all... and 73 per cent of our exports are not goods with the European Union, they are services and goods to the rest of the world.\n“Easy on the sidelines, Keir Starmer saying we’ll get a better deal with the European Union. At what price? At what price?”\n08:16 AM BST\nBusiness minister defends Sunak on small boats\nA business minister has defended Rishi Sunak insisting small boat crossings have come down during last night’s debate.\nThe Prime Minister made the remarks despite a record number of migrants having crossed the Channel in the first six months of this year.\nKevin Hollinrake told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “He was talking about the last 12 months, and those key figures on the last 12 months, they have come down.\n“What happens now on those small boats if people come across the Channel, they are now detained, they don’t go into hotels, they don’t go into council flats, they go into detention pending their removal to Rwanda. We think that is a significant deterrent.\n“Now Keir Starmer has said and he wouldn’t clearly answer the question last night, what he’s said is he’s going to abolish that legislation... Those people currently in detention will be released onto the streets. This would effectively be a free-for-all if you come over on a small boat, that’s the reality.”\n08:03 AM BST\nWes Streeting: The polls may be too good to be true\nThe opinion polls could be as wrong about the general election as they were about the Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump, Wes Streeting has said.\nSurveys carried out during the campaign have shown Labour with a lead of around 20 points over the Conservatives, who are now regularly beaten into third place by Reform.\nSpeaking to GB News, Mr Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said: “We’ve got a week now in which people need to decide to choose change, and you only get change if you vote for it.\n“And it’s no secret that Conservatives haven’t run a brilliant election campaign, let’s be honest. But the one thing they are doing, I think, quite effectively, is to suggest that there’s an inevitability about a Labour government.”\nHe added: “In the conversations on the doorstep, they just don’t reflect these wild polls. I’m still talking to undecided voters in huge numbers a week out from the general election, and to people who voted by post who said to me just last weekend when I was in the northeast, ‘Actually, I voted Conservative’..\n“I’ve been brought up to believe if it looks too good to be true, it’s too good to be true. It doesn’t reflect what we’re feeling. And more than that, the polling industry is an industry that is addicted to calling it wrong and doing it very loudly. They called it wrong on Brexit. They called it wrong on Trump. They called it wrong in a number of general elections. It’s not the pollsters and it’s not the bookies that decide general elections, it’s millions of voters.”\n07:55 AM BST\nLabour frontbencher refuses to say how much net zero plan will cost\nA Labour frontbencher has refused to say how many hundreds of billions reaching Labour’s net zero target will cost.\nBridget Phillipson was asked about a record obtained by The Telegraph in which Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the party’s plan to decarbonising the economy will cost “hundreds of billions” of pounds.\nAsked how much money meant in practice, the shadow education secretary told GB News: “The point that Darren was making is the answer is how we move to a position of decarbonising our economy, creating more jobs, is through private investment, not just public money.\n“So you can invest relatively modest sums of public money and that brings in real returns when it comes to private companies using that as a lever to deliver bigger private investment. We know there are lots of companies that would relish the opportunity to invest directly in for example offshore wind to create jobs right across our country.\n“So it’s about how Government can partner with business, yes to manage our obligations but also to create more well-paid, highly-skilled jobs right across our country.”\n07:48 AM BST\n‘28 degrees yesterday and having a great time!’\nJeremy Hunt’s fight for re-election literally heated up yesterday as the Tory Chancellor seeks to do enough to impress constituents in Godalming and Ash.\nThe seat, created as a result of the boundary review, is a key Liberal Democrat target and Mr Hunt has said he expects there to be fewer than 1,500 votes between him and his rival.\nPosting a photograph of him out canvassing with volunteers, he said: “28 degrees yesterday and having a great time!”\n07:44 AM BST\nBBC asks pollster how she votes before allowing her on air\nThe BBC has admitted asking a contributor to state how they voted at the last election, saying an employee had misinterpreted guidelines on impartiality.\nScarlett Maguire, a director at polling company JL Partners, expressed surprise at being asked to divulge the information before going on air.\nThe question was posed by a BBC journalist working on Adrian Chiles’ Radio 5 Live programme.\n“Bizarre interaction this morning just before going into an interview at the BBC. Was asked how I voted at the last election as a precondition for coming on air,” she wrote on social media.\nAnita Singh, our Arts Editor, has the full story here\n07:35 AM BST\nBusiness minister bet on Tories winning election\nA business minister has revealed he placed a bet on the Conservatives winning the general election.\nAsked whether he had gambled on the result, Kevin Hollinrake told Times Radio: “Yes, I did. Not my seat, I think that would be wrong.\n“This situation has definitely opened up a debate that we should have a proper debate about and decide whether it’s right or wrong that people have a bet on things they are involved in.”\nYesterday, Mel Stride, the Work and Pensions Secretary, suggested politicians should be banned from gambling in the wake of a row that has engulfed several top Tory figures.\n07:30 AM BST\nRwanda scheme could see ‘thousands’ deported in first year, says minister\nA minister said he believed it would be possible to deport “thousands” of small boat Channel migrants to Rwanda in the first year of the scheme if the Tories win the election.\nAsked the question during an interview on Times Radio, Kevin Hollinrake said: “Well, potentially thousands because it is a completely scalable solution.\n“But the ideal number of people that go to Rwanda is zero because it will stop people coming in the first place.”\n07:26 AM BST\nTory frontbencher ‘optimistic’ of election victory\nKevin Hollinrake said he is “optimistic” the Tories can win the general election on Thursday next week.\nIt was suggested to the business minister during an interview on Times Radio that no one was listening to Rishi Sunak and the Tories.\nHe replied: “Well, that is not my experience on the doorstep. The only poll that matters is next Thursday, of course.”\nAsked if he was optimistic of a Tory victory, he said: “Of course. I am always optimistic . Victory is always possible if you don’t stop fighting.”\n07:21 AM BST\nMinister: Sunak is the ‘best possible person we could have in this situation’\nA Tory minister said Rishi Sunak was the “best possible person we could have in this situation”.\nKevin Hollinrake, a business minister, made the statement after an audience member at last night’s TV debate was applauded for saying neither Sir Keir Starmer nor Mr Sunak were good leaders.\nAsked if he believed Mr Sunak and Sir Keir were the best the UK could do to lead the country, Mr Hollinrake told Times Radio: “Well, I think Rishi Sunak is. I think he has proven himself through so many different trials and difficulties.\n“You look back at the Covid crisis, how we delivered that half a trillion pounds of support for businesses and households. We saved millions of jobs.\n“You saw the cost of living crisis, how we helped you through that. You saw how he has managed inflation, got the economy growing again.\n“So I think he is the best possible person we could have in this situation.”\n07:12 AM BST\nPoll: Labour holds six point lead over SNP in Scotland\nLabour holds a six point poll lead over the SNP in Scotland, according to a new Survation survey.\nThe poll, conducted between June 21-25, put Labour on 37 per cent and the SNP in second place on 31 per cent.\nLabour was up by one point and the SNP was down by one point when compared to the company’s previous Scotland survey conducted at the end of May.\nThe poll put the Tories in third on 14 per cent, down by three points, and Reform UK in fourth on 8 per cent, up by five points.\nNEW Scotland Polling\nWestminster Voting Intention:\nLAB: 37% (+1)\nSNP: 31% (-1)\nCON: 14% (-3)\nREF: 8% (+5)\nLD: 7% (-2)\nOTH: 4% (+1)\nF/w 21st - 25th June 2024.

Of course because of Covid, because of the war in Ukraine, there are things we wanted to achieve that we’ve not been able to achieve. I get that frustration.\n“But it’s reminding those floating voters who haven’t made their mind up yet that a Labour government would hurt them. And that’s particularly true, I think, of potential Reform voters.”\n06:42 AM BST\nLabour government would mean ‘unfettered’ spending and taxation, claims Cleverly\nElecting a Labour government on July 4 would mean ushering in a new era of “unfettered” public spending and taxation, according to James Cleverly.\nThe Tory Cabinet minister said the Conservatives are still fighting to win the general election.\nBut he said if that is not possible the party needs to be in a position to “hold Labour to account”.\nHe told GB News: “We would want to form a government but if that isn’t possible, we need to hold Labour to account.\n“Because we know that their plans, their unfettered spending, their unfettered taxation, their failure to deliver on public services, and we see that in Wales, we see that in London where they run things. We need to protect the British people from that.”\n06:37 AM BST\nVoting Reform ‘will herald a Labour government’, claims Cleverly\nJames Cleverly said voting for any party other than the Tories would “herald a Labour government” as he issued a plea to wavering Conservative supporters who may be thinking of backing Reform UK.\nThe Home Secretary told GB News: “This is a choice. And it is choice between a Conservative Party that is committed to reducing taxation, committed to increasing our defence spending, committed to protecting our borders and bringing the Rwanda plan into full operation and a Labour government that will put up taxes, will be soft on borders, will not fund our armed forces in the way they should be funded and a vote for any other party will herald a Labour government.”\n06:35 AM BST\nWhat is happening in the general election campaign today?\nWith a week until the country goes to the polls, Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer return to the campaign trail after a heated final head-to-head televised debate.\nThe Prime Minister will be targeting seats in the Midlands and Yorkshire that were crucial to the Tories’ triumph in 2019, taking part in a visit to a Derbyshire pottery factory and a transport site visit before giving a short stump speech in Leeds on Thursday evening.\nSir Keir, the Labour leader, is also in the Midlands as he pays a visit to Staffordshire before heading to Cheshire late afternoon for a further campaign event.\nMeanwhile, Nigel Farage will speak in front of a crowd of around 1,000 Reform UK supporters in Sunderland this lunchtime.
