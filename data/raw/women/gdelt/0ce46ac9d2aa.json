  "body_text": "Alan Haller is out as Michigan State’s athletic director.\nMichigan State announced Thursday that it is seeking a new athletic director and Haller is leaving the university. Haller has been the athletic director since Sept. 1, 2021, taking over as predecessor Bill Beekman moved into a role in the president’s office. His last day with the university will be May 11.Deputy athletic director Jennifer Smith and men’s basketball coach Tom Izzo will serve as co-interim athletic directors as Michigan State conducts its search for a new leader. Michigan State announced that firm TurnkeyZRG and an advisory committee will assist Guskiewicz in the search.\n“I’m grateful for Alan’s leadership since I joined the university and appreciate the success our programs have seen under his leadership,” MSU president Kevin Guskiewicz said in a statement. “He is deeply committed to this university and has led with honesty and integrity.”\nThe Detroit News attempted to contact Haller via phone and text message, but he did not answer.\nHaller’s departure comes at a pivotal time in college athletics. A number of changes shaped Haller’s time at Michigan State, including the advent of the transfer portal and name, image and likeness (NIL) rights for athletes.\nWith the ongoing House v. NCAA settlement putting into effect roster limits and revenue sharing, Guskiewicz says the university is seeking a successor who “can best navigate the changing landscape of collegiate athletics while working closely with both internal and external stakeholders to move Michigan State forward as a leader among the Power Four institutions.”\n“This is a pivotal time for college athletics, where innovation, effective communications and community engagement are more important than ever,” Guskiewicz continued. “Our next athletic director will lead one of the nation’s more storied athletic programs, home to 23 varsity sports, a passionate fan base, a long legacy of academic and athletic excellence and, most importantly, an ambitious future.”\nUnder Haller’s tenure, five programs won Big Ten championships. He hired a number of Michigan State’s current coaches in football’s Jonathan Smith, hockey’s Adam Nightingale, women’s basketball’s Robyn Fralick and men’s tennis coach Harry Jadun. Haller also navigated the fallout of the 2022 Michigan-Michigan State tunnel fight scandal and former football coach Mel Tucker’s sexual misconduct scandal.",
