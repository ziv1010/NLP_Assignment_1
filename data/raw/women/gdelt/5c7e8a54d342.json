When a reporter asked Biden if he would attend Trump’s inauguration, he implied that he would attend, adding that he has “good manners.” “Mr. President, if Trump wins, will you attend his inauguration, sir?” the reporter asked. “For the peaceful transfer of power?” -\nKenyan Farmer Wants Activists To Experience Agriculture Without Fossil Fuels\nJusper Machogu, a farmer in Kenya, Africa, wants people who think Africa shouldn’t develop with fossil fuels to see what a low-carbon lifestyle is really like. He and his family live it every day, and he told Cowboy State Daily that people, especially those of the West, don’t really grasp what it means not to have access to energy. In an effort to combat global emissions, wealthy nations are trying to discourage African countries from using fossil fuels, which Machogu said that will keep Africa in poverty. That’s why he’s offering an educational tour of his low-carbon lifestyle, which he... -\nInitiative to enshrine abortion rights in Missouri constitution qualifies for November ballot\nMissouri voters will decide in November whether to guarantee a right to abortion with a constitutional amendment that would reverse the state’s near-total ban. The secretary of state’s office certified Tuesday that an initiative petition received more than enough valid signatures from registered voters to qualify for the general election. It will need approval from a majority of voters to become enshrined in the state constitution. If passed, the Missouri initiative would “do something that no other state has done before — end a total abortion ban at the ballot box,” said Rachel Sweet, campaign manager for Missourians for Constitutional... -\nHarris-Walz Campaign Gets Busted Spoofing News Outlets in Headline-Altering Ad Scheme\nDespite corporate media’s unabashed u-turn to support Kamala Harris, her campaign has been busted creating made-up headlines next to the names of real news outlets to trick people into thinking they’ve stumbled upon the real thing, Axios reports. Upon hearing the news, The Guardian lost their sh*t, telling Axios: “While we understand why an organization might wish to align itself with the Guardian’s trusted brand, we need to ensure it is being used appropriately and with our permission. We’ll be reaching out to Google for more information about this practice.” -\nUNC-Wilmington shuts down DEI office\nNorth Carolina school reassigns DEI staff amid statewide crackdown The University of North Carolina Wilmington is the most recent college to close its “diversity and inclusion” office. The school announced the decision to shut down its Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion last week, ... “Based on policy requirements and consistent with System Office guidance, UNCW will close the Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion (OIDI), eliminate the Chief Diversity Officer position and shift the cultural and identity centers from OIDI to Student Affairs,” Chancellor Aswani K. Volety wrote in a message to the school. “Careful and deliberate thought was... -\nTracking Kamala Harris’ Biggest And Baddest Lies: 20 And Counting\nDemocrats traded one liar for another when they replaced their presumptive 2024 presidential nominee President Joe Biden with Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris may not quite live up to her counterpart’s long history of selling whoppers as truth, but there’s no doubt that she has fibbed far too often without consequence or accountability. Democrats’ new darling likely wants voters to be “unburdened by what has been.” But not even her jumbled babble or unintelligible chattering can keep Harris’ radical track record and history of deception under wraps. Here’s a look back at some of Harris’ biggest lies to date. 20.... -\nTwo Female Cops Lost the Suspect But Got His Jacket and Someone Got Handcuffs as a Souvenir\nTwo Female Cops Lost the Suspect But Got His Jacket and Someone Got Handcuffs as a Souvenir -\nThe Economic Mind of Tim Walz\nIn recent weeks, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz burst from relative obscurity to co-headlining the Democratic presidential ticket. Walz’s career rocket launch was fueled by his cutting political rhetoric, folksy midwestern charm, jovial dad vibes, and progressive principles and accomplishments. Before Walz was governor and a vice presidential candidate, he wore many hats. He was a congressman, a high school teacher, a union member, a command sergeant major in the Army National Guard, a state-championship-winning high school football coach. While not as dramatic as the political transformation of his electoral counterpart JD Vance, Walz too had a political transformation over the... -\nMaricopa County agrees to test ballot tabulators used in elections, not just backup machines\nThe Republican Party of Arizona has secured an agreement with the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to test ballot tabulators used in elections, rather than only testing backup equipment.The agreement states that the board \"will inform the Secretary of State that it wants the test to be of at least six of the tabulators and twelve of the accessible voting devices scheduled to be deployed to early voting locations and vote centers.\"On Tuesday, the Arizona GOP announced the agreement, reached with Maricopa County on Monday, to perform logic and accuracy testing on accessible voting machines and ballot tabulators that are... -\n$350 Could Cost You Thousands: Wall Street Banks Clamp Down On Harris-Walz Donations\nVice President Kamala Harris’s selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate has created an unexpected challenge for Wall Street’s political donors. Major financial institutions are now grappling with stringent regulations that could limit their employees’ ability to contribute to the Harris-Walz campaign. At the heart of the issue, reported initially by Business Insider, is the Securities and Exchange Commission’s “pay-to-play” rule, adopted in 2010. The regulation aims to prevent financial firms from influencing politicians through campaign contributions in hopes of securing lucrative government contracts, like managing state pension funds. -\nMusk boasts of 1B views for 'no limits' X interview with Trump\nElon Musk’s conversational interview with former President Trump on Monday evening pulled in a combined 1 billion views, according to the tech billionaire. \"Combined views of the conversation with @realDonaldTrump and subsequent discussion by other accounts now ~1 billion,\" Musk posted on his social media platform X early Tuesday morning following the interview.

'Mr. Hoyer has responded well to treatment and has no lingering symptoms. He expects to resume his normal schedule next week.' 'Mr. Hoyer’s wife and family extend their deepest thanks to his medical team,' the statement concluded. -\nKamala Harris Isn’t Running A Democrat Campaign. The Media Are Doing It For Her.\nThere was a particularly revealing set of quotes from unnamed Democrat “insiders” in Monday’s edition of Politico “Playbook” that went like this: “Values unite and specific policies divide, so I don’t think there is a desire to spend the next 80 days litigating Medicare for All, for example,” and, “Why would we start talking about policy?” In other words, Democrats feel no need whatsoever to run a campaign for president. They know they don’t have to because the news media are doing the work for them.We just went through the most scandalous month of national campaign politics, a month unlike... -\nAnother New Study Finds Rising CO2 Enhances Planetary Greening and Reduces Drought Risk\n“…elevated CO2 concentrations not only boosted vegetation growth through the fertilizer effect but also indirectly enhanced water availability [reducing drought risk] by improving water use efficiency.” – Song et al., 2024 One of the more commonly-stated concerns linked to “global warming” is that sweltering heat will parch the terrestrial landscape (browning), limit vegetation growth, and foment water shortages – even widespread drought. However, a new study suggests the Earth’s rising CO2 concentration has the exact opposite effect in the real world. In their extensive trend analysis spanning the last few decades, the scientists determined elevated CO2 was the single most... -\nThe Failure of Interreligious Dialogue with Islam\nThe Failure of Interreligious Dialogue with IslamLast week, on the morning of August 7th, Pope Francis, just before his regular Wednesday general audience, received a group of representatives from the Afghan Muslim community in Italy. He touched upon the “complicated and dramatic history [in Afghanistan], marked by a succession of wars and blood-stained conflicts, which have made it very difficult for people to lead peaceful, free and secure lives.” The pontiff went on to tell the Afghan males—there were, surprisingly, no women at the encounter—“to continue in [their] noble endeavour to promote religious harmony and to strive to overcome misunderstandings... -\nBiden: Iran could hold back on attack if Gaza deal reached\nIran is expected to skip a retaliatory strike on Israel if a Gaza ceasefire deal is reached, US President Joe Biden told reporters in New Orleans on Tuesday, stressing “That’s my expectation.” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant left nothing to chance, stating in northern Israel that the IDF is prepared for defensive and offensive actions against Hezbollah and Iran, even as the United States pinned its hope for averting a regional war on Thursday’s hostage talks in Doha. A hostage and Gaza ceasefire agreement would more “broadly, create conditions for diplomacy to get the region out of this cycle of violence,”... -\nKamala’s VP Tim Walz sent his tyrannical agents into Minnesota neighborhoods to shoot citizens with paintball guns during Covid Video—1 min\nKamala’s VP Tim Walz sent his tyrannical agents into Minnesota neighborhoods to shoot citizens with paintball guns during Covid Do we really want someone like this running our country? -\nThe Press Won’t Discuss Real Campaign Issues, Because They Don’t Want Trump To Win\nFollowing the dramatic reveal of Joe Biden’s age-related decline on a national debate stage, there was a brief period of self-examination among the press where they asked themselves whether regurgitating Democrats’ credulous and self-serving narratives was in the best interest of the American people. That lasted about a week, and was clearly insincere.We’re now three weeks from the press hounding Biden out of the race because they looked like fools for defending years of video clips showing him stumbling around on the international stage non compos mentis. And with no remorse or self-awareness, the media are already back to doing... -\nTrump Campaign Political Director Shares Updates On Where Trump Stands: Don't Panic\nTrump Campaign Political Director Shares Updates On Where Trump Stands: Don't Panic, Do the Work.\nBrowse by Forum\nGet Connected!
