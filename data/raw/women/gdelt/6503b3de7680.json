The Jets' final-round exchange is on April 19. Knights' pre-season is likely to start mid-May.\nThere is a slim possibility the Jets could make finals but they need to win their remaining three games, starting against fourth-placed Western United at No.2 Sportsground on Sunday (4pm).\nGallagher signed with the Jets for this season and whether she commits to another A-League campaign is not yet known.\n\"It's not something that's crossing the books as yet but I wouldn't say no if the opportunity arose,\" Gallagher said.\nThe Jets are arguably the fittest team in the competition and the Knights are set to benefit from the 23-year-old's A-League return.\nInstead of roughly eight months off between NRLW seasons, Gallagher has been pushed hard.\n\"I think [playing A-League] is only going to complement how I play [for the Knights],\" Gallagher said.\n\"When I made the transition across to start with, I was super agile and I think that's what a lot of the football players probably lack.\n\"If I can bring that back into rugby league, it will be not only good for me but also for the girls I'm playing with.\"\nPlaying both codes at the elite level has given Gallagher insight into the different stages the sports are at for women.\nWhile NRLW is still in its infancy - it started in 2018 - the code is already further advanced than A-League, which began as W-League in 2008.\nThe Knights are based out of a circa $25 million state-of-the-art Centre of Excellence at Broadmeadow, which includes training fields, identical male and female changerooms, a 25-metre lap pool, a gym, athletes lounge, dining area and a fully equipped physiotherapy clinic.\nThey play home games at McDonald Jones Stadium.\nBy comparison, the Jets live a somewhat nomadic lifestyle in pre-season and the latter stages of their campaign.\nThey use No.2 Sportsground as a training base during the season but could not move in on time this campaign due to an unplayable surface. They will move out after Sunday's game to make way for rugby union.\nThey have experienced ongoing issues with poor pitch conditions this season, shifting several home games. The Jets have played at Cessnock and Maitland as well as the inner-city location plus had two matches at McDonald Jones Stadium.\n\"It's actually pretty crazy that the club doesn't have a space, one for the men nor do the women have anywhere to go,\" Gallagher said.\n\"It's not professional enough, but we've got to get there. If we can be that driving force behind the girls in a couple of years' time having their own facility and not having to worry about where they're going to train next week, I think that would be pretty cool.\n\"The NRLW do an awesome job with it and they're leading the way with how the standard should be and how you should be treated as a female athlete.\"\nGallagher felt the introduction of video assistant referee (VAR) would also advance ALW.\nVAR, or a lack thereof, was thrust into the spotlight last Friday night, when the Jets conceded a controversial last-minute goal in a 4-3 loss to second-placed Victory in Melbourne.\n\"It was pretty hard to go down that way, but I think that just shows where the women's game needs to be,\" Gallagher said.\n\"The VAR needs to be there not only for the men but for us too, and that's got to come from the league and they need to push that so that it's there for us.\"\nThe minimum wage for an ALW player is $25,750 for a 35-week commitment, including pre-season, 23 rounds and finals.\nThe minimum wage for an NRLW player this upcoming season will be $41,800 for an expected 23-week season, including pre-season, 11 rounds and finals.",
