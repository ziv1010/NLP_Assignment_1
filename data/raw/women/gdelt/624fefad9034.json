It was something of a shock, I have to say.\nShe added she had \"no idea\" when she was given the envelope.\n\"Opened it and I saw the letters OBE and was literally in shock, shaking. It's been an amazing year for women's sport and I am always so privileged to be part of the journey of women's sport since I started broadcasting almost 30 years ago to where we are today.\"\nShe explained that the investment in women's sport, the numbers of girls playing sport, the hours on TV, radio, podcasts who talk about women's sport, is \"just unrecognisable\".\nShe went on: \"When I see little girls on Saturday and Sunday mornings walking into rugby and football clubs, holding their boots, it really does bring a huge smile to my face because those sights would have been unimaginable when I was a young girl.\n\"I think we all know the benefits that sports give communities and give people in terms of confidence and health and it's important that 51% of the population has access to that.\nShe added that this year's success of the lionesses and the red roses andis the \"icing on the cake\".\nLogan also explained the OBE was an aware also for her charity work.\n\"Even just having the opportunity right now because of this award to amplify their messages is fantastic.

And again, that's another community that's had its story told in, in the public.\nFinally, she added: \"I'm very, very honoured and grateful and can't wait to get to the palace or the castle to pick up my gong.\"\nAlex Greenwood, Keira Walsh, Georgia Stanway and Ella Toone, who were all part of the side that beat Spain in the final in Basel, Switzerland, in July, become MBEs.\nAnd the team’s Dutch manager Sarina Wiegman, who has won the Euros twice with England, and once with the Netherlands, is awarded an honorary damehood, the Cabinet Office said.\nEngland’s Lionesses feature heavily on the list after their Euros win in the summer – with captain Leah Williamson made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).\nWiegman said: “I would like to express my sincere gratitude for this honour. When I first arrived in England, I could never have imagined the respect and warmth I’ve experienced from the English people. I deeply thank the fans for their support.”\nSir Idris, 53, known for his roles in The Wire and Luther, is knighted for services to young people, having founded the Elba Hope Foundation, which supports community empowerment, education, youth advocacy and sustainable development.\nDame Jayne Torvill and Sir Christopher Dean, who took home the Olympic gold at the 1984 Winter Games and saw success at the World, European and British Championships, are made a Dame and Sir for services to ice skating and to voluntary service.\nThe pair, who later became the faces of celebrity competition show Dancing On Ice, said the honour is “wonderful and humbling at the same time”.",
