  "body_text": "AJ Lopez scored a career-high 19 points, and Maine took control with a 21-6 run midway through the second half on its way to a 78-65 win over Northwestern State in a men’s basketball game Thursday afternoon in Jacksonville, Florida.\nA layup by Ja’shonte Wright-McLeish broke a 40-40 tie and started the decisive surge for the Black Bears (2-2). Wright-McLeish and Kellen Tynes each finished with 14 points, while Peter Filipovity added 11.\nJamison Epps led Northwestern State (1-3) with 16 points.\nIt was the first of four straight games in Florida for the Black Bears, who play Presbyterian on Friday and North Florida on Saturday, both in Jacksonville.\nFOOTBALL\nMICHIGAN: Michigan announced that Coach Jim Harbaugh will serve the remainder of a three-game suspension from the Big Ten in return for the conference ending its investigation into a scheme to steal opponents’ play-calling signals.\nThe settlement between the parties is the latest twist in a monthlong saga involving one of college football’s most recognizable programs, one of its most successful coaches, and allegations a low-level Michigan staffer purchased tickets to the games of future opponents and sent people to those games to digitally record teams signaling in their plays.\n“Coach Harbaugh, with the university’s support, decided to accept this sanction to return the focus to our student-athletes and their performance on the field,” Michigan said in a statement. “The conference has confirmed that it is not aware of any information suggesting Coach Harbaugh’s involvement in the allegations. The university continues to cooperate fully with the NCAA’s investigation.”\nHarbaugh was suspended last Friday by the Big Ten, three weeks after an investigation by the NCAA into the allegations emerged. Michigan hours later asked a court for an injunction and temporary restraining order, but Harbaugh did not coach the team against Penn State on Saturday.\nThe two sides were expected in court Friday in Ann Arbor, but instead, Michigan and Harbaugh dropped the complaint. Harbaugh will miss games at Maryland on Saturday and at home against No. 3 Ohio State on Nov. 25.\nPAC-12: Oregon State and Washington State are moving toward keeping the Pac-12 alive as a two-team conference for as long as two years while entering an agreement with the Mountain West that will allow the Pacific Northwest schools to fill out their sports schedules, two people with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press.\nThe agreement could set the stage for a long-term deal between Oregon State, Washington State and the Mountain West. What that looks like is unlikely to be determined soon.\nWOMEN’S BASKETBALL\n(1) SOUTH CAROLINA 109, CLEMSON 40: Freshman MiLaysia Fulwiley scored 18 points and Kamilla Cardoso had a double-double with 15 points and 13 rebounds as the Gamecocks (3-0) rolled to their 13th straight victory over state rival Clemson (3-1), in Columbia, South Carolina.\nOregon transfer Te-Hina Paopao had 14 points with four 3-pointers for the Gamecocks, who broke it open with a 28-0 first-half run to win their 43rd straight at home. They have cracked the century mark in scoring in all three wins.\n(8) UCONN 80, (20) MARYLAND 48: Paige Bueckers had 24 points and six steals as the Huskies (2-1) rebounded from their first loss of the season, routing the Terrapins (1-2) in Storrs, Connecticut.\nAaliyah Edwards and KK Arnold each scored 12 points for UConn. Ashlynn Shade added 10 points, and Aubrey Griffin had nine points and 13 rebounds.\nShyanne Sellers scored 16 points for Maryland, which made just 15 field goals (26% shooting) and committed 27 turnovers, leading to 29 UConn points.\n(9) VIRGINIA TECH 105, HOUSTON CHRISTIAN 36: Elizabeth Kitley scored 23 points and Georgia Amoore set a school record with 16 assists as the Hokies (2-1) beat Houston Christian (1-3) in Blacksburg, Virginia.\n(13) OHIO STATE 88, BOSTON COLLEGE 66: Cotie McMahon scored 24 points and the Buckeyes (3-1) rolled past the Eagles (2-2) in Columbus, Ohio.",
