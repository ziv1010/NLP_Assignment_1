Though it remained below pre-pandemic levels.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the data illustrates a worrisome trend as prices continue to rise, stimulus payments fade and enhanced food and child-care programs expire in the aftermath of the pandemic.\nThe termination of the various benefits and programs undermine the advances seen during the pandemic, and is already contributing to an increase in family homelessness.\nResidents from the Washington Metropolitan area stand in line for free Thanksgiving meals distributed by the Washington Redskins NFL team and FedEx November 25, 2008 at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by TIM SLOAN / AFP)\nEchoing the words of UNICEF’s Russel, vice president for income security at the National Women’s Law Center Melissa Boteach said poverty in the US is a “policy choice”.\nIn a statement, carried by Bloomberg, Boteach said the report “highlights that poverty in our country isn’t a personal failing, but rather a policy choice,” as inflation-adjusted household incomes in the US fell by the most in over a decade.\nThe World Bank and UNICEF called on governments to prioritize tackling child poverty and to enact a range of measures including the expansion of universal child benefits programs.",
