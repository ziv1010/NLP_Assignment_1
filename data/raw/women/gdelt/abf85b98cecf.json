He denies any wrongdoing.\nMs Hermoso had told the court on Monday she had never given permission to be kissed at the World Cup medal ceremony and felt \"disrespected\" as a woman.\nMs Putellas said she thought at the time the incident had been something \"fortuitous\" and a \"misunderstanding\" but Ms Hermoso then later showed her a video and said she did not know how it occurred to Mr Rubiales to kiss her, according to local Spanish media.\nThe court heard from Ms Paredes that while on the bus to the airport after the World Cup final, she told her teammates to stop making jokes about the incident, saying it was \"serious\".\nMs Putellas said that Ms Hermoso was \"overwhelmed\" on the plane back to Spain.\n\"She started crying from exhaustion,\" the Barcelona player added.\nThe 31-year-old said Ms Hermoso was asked to speak to Mr Rubiales on the plane who told her that she should \"come out\" and \"deny that there was no consent\" in the kiss.\n\"She was angry and she said that there was no need for him to explain the facts to her because she had experienced it, that she wasn't going to do that,\" Ms Putellas said.\nMs Codina told the trial that during the team's celebratory trip to the Spanish island of Ibiza, Ms Hermoso was \"sad, she was not enjoying herself, far from it\" even though it \"should have been the best moment\" of her life.\nThree colleagues of Mr Rubiales are also on trial, accused of colluding in the alleged coercion: Jorge Vilda, coach of the World Cup-winning side, Rubén Rivera, the federation's former head of marketing, and former sporting director, Albert Luque. They all deny the charges.\nOn Wednesday, the court heard that Mr Vilda spoke to Rafael Hermoso - brother of Jenni Hermoso - on the flight back to Spain, telling him that Mr Rubiales feared for his position, according to local Spanish media.\nMr Vilda asked him to speak to his sister about her making a video with Ms Rubiales that would downplay the kiss.\nThe coach warned that his sister could face \"professional and personal consequences\" if she did not cooperate, Rafael Hermoso said.\nSpeaking in court on Monday, Ms Hermoso said she and the then-president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation hugged and celebrated at the football event, saying that he then grabbed her \"by the ears and kiss[ed] me on the mouth\".\n\"I didn't hear or understand anything,\" she said, adding that \"a kiss on the lips is only given when I decide so\".\nThe footballer said she felt \"completely abandoned by the federation\".\nProsecutors are calling for Mr Rubiales to receive a one-year prison sentence for sexual assault for the kiss.\nThey are also calling for him to be given a sentence of a year-and-a-half for coercion, for allegedly trying to pressure Ms Hermoso into saying publicly that the kiss was consensual.\nMr Rubiales denies the charges.
