So, that’d be pretty cool,” Kelce said during a press conference.\nAccording to The Guardian, the president will sit down for a pre-recorded interview that will air during the pregame show for Fox — this year’s Super Bowl broadcaster.\nDuring the 2024 presidential election, Mahomes refused to endorse a specific candidate despite Trump praising his wife Brittany for seemingly supporting his campaign.\n“I don’t want my place and my platform to be used to endorse a candidate or do whatever, either way,” Mahomes said during a press conference back in September. “I think my place is to inform people to get registered to vote. It’s to inform people to do their own research and then make the best decision for them and their family.”\nThe three-time Super Bowl champion was then asked about his name being mentioned within the political space after his wife raised eyebrows for liking an Instagram post about Trump’s campaign.\n“I’ve grown up with people from every aspect of life and every background. I think the best thing about a football locker room, and kind of how I’ve grown up in baseball locker rooms is people can come together and achieve something and achieve a common goal,” Mahomes said.\n“I think if we can do that as a nation, I think we can get the best out of each other. I think that’s something that I do every single day. Whenever I’m hanging out with whoever, I’m not thinking about their political views or anything like that.”\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments",
