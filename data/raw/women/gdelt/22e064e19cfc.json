But second half strikes from Leah Galton and Lucia Garcia either side of Russo’s hat-trick strike ensured it would be a comfortable victory in the end.\nIt was clear that the league leaders were looking to stretch the visitors early, with Ella Toone runs just snuffed out and then Alessia Russo denied by a near-post block from close range.\nLeicester’s star goalkeeper Janina Leitzig made her big first save around six minutes in when Toone combined well with Leah Galton. The cutback eventually made its way back to Toone in the middle of the area, but a strong hand from the towering German turned the ball away.\nLeitzig has been a hero since joining the Foxes from Bayern Munich in January and did her utmost to keep United out again moments later. A big diving save to push away Toone’s low drive was followed up by a block from Russo’s rebound. But as the ball dropped to Russo a second time, the England striker made no mistake to give United their early lead.\nMarc Skinner’s team continued to probe, with Leicester having to work hard just to stay in the game. The Foxes did have a couple of half chances when Hannah Cain lashed wide from a good position and Siemsen threatened to take it round Mary Earps until her angle closed.\nBut it wasn’t long afterwards that United responded to get their deserved second. With the Red Devils constantly looking for overloads on the flanks, the ball was worked well from left to right, with Toone declining an opportunity to shoot on the edge of the box to instead find Ona Batlle with a reverse pass. The full-back’s cross to the far post was met by a grateful Russo.\nLeicester were quicker out of the blocks when the game restarted and a sluggish United were punished when Siemsen controlled Josie Green’s hopeful through ball, cut inside Le Tissier and guided it past Mary Earps. Those in red looked in vain for an offside flag – replays showed the Australian forward was level when the pass was made.\nJust as they had responded to Leicester briefly threatening in the first half, United burst into life again. An inviting Russo volley palmed wide by Leitzig would have been a spectacular way to get her hat-trick, but it still came from the resultant corner. Martha Thomas flicked it on at the near post and, with Leicester failing to clear, Russo smashed into the roof of the net from mere yards out.\nMaking sure not to allow Leicester back into the game again, Galton’s goal just over an hour in pushed the cushion to three goals and sealed maximum points. The ball was worked from a corner, with Toone’s cross flicked on by Russo and Galton there to sweep home.\nUnited had a flurry of chances to extend the lead. Toone couldn’t sort her feet out to convert Thomas’ cross from the right, while Hayley Ladd’s eyes lit up when Leitzig had parried a dangerous cross into her path – but the Leicester stopper got up quickly to save again. Russo, who was eventually subbed to standing ovation, even had a chance to take her personal tally to four but saw a well-struck volley come back off the post.\nThere was still time for Garcia to make it five, collecting a searching ball to the left, beating Leicester defender Sophie Howard and sliding it past Leitzig with composure.\nMan Utd player ratings (4-3-3)\nGK: Mary Earps - 6/10 - Introduced beforehand as the Best FIFA Women's Goalkeeper to rapturous applause. Communicated well as usual.\nRB: Ona Batlle - 7/10 - Attacked with her usual vigour and got a customary assist.\nCB: Maya Le Tissier - 6/10 - Had a little defensive trouble on occasion but still great on the ball.\nCB: Millie Turner - 6/10 - Usuaully solid at the back. Had a glorious headed chance that she couldn't take.\nLB: Hannah Blundell - 7/10 - Really made it difficult for Leicester down their right in the first half in particular with how much she got forward.\nCM: Hayley Ladd - 8/10 - Did both sides of the ball well, shutting down anything Leicester tried.\nCM: Katie Zelem (c) - 6/10 - Knitted things together in the middle.\nAM: Ella Toone - 8/10 - Back in the side after being rested last time out and was immediately making incisive runs forward. Took up good positions in both inside channels that devastated Leicester.\nRW: Martha Thomas - 7/10 - Given the nod on the right ahead of the pacier Lucia Garcia or Nikita Parris and made a significant impact. Worked hard and effectively made Russo's hat-trick goal.\nST: Alessia Russo - 10/10 - Scored the early breakthrough with typical poacher's instinct and completed a clinical hat-trick. Also set up Galton for hers.\nLW: Leah Galton - 8/10 - Worked really well with Toone on the left, interchanging to open up spaces and confuse the Leicester defence. Scored her sixth WSL goal of the season.\nSubstitutes\nSUB: Nikita Parris (67' for Thomas) - 7/10\nSUB: Estelle Cascarino (71' for Ladd) - 6/10\nSUB: Vilde Boe Risa (71' for Toone) - 7/10\nSUB: Rachel Williams (79' for Russo) - 6/10\nSUB: Lucia Garcia (80' for Galton) - 7/10\nManager\nMarc Skinner - 9/10 - His team deliberately attacked with width that reallty stretched Leicester and was the source of much joy. Later made full use of his bench with a huge game next week and was rewarded by impact from those substitues.\nLeicester player ratings (4-3-3)\nGK: Janina Leitzig - 6/10 - Made good early saves and throughout but stood little chance with the goals. It would have been a heavier defeat without her.\nRB: Jess Reavill - 4/10 - Struggled defensively because of the way United were consistenly overloading that flank. Withdrawn at half-time.\nCB: Sophie Howard - 4/10 - Lost Russo in the six-yard box for United's second goal. Moved to the right after a half-time reshuffle of thr back four.\nCB: Ashleigh Plumptre - 4/10 - Given a real runaround by Russo. Won't often have afternoons quiter as challenging as this one.\nLB: Courtney Nevin - 4/10 - Constantly on the back foot in the second half and looked exhausted as United attacked at will down her flank.\nCM: Josie Green - 6/10 - Earned a decent assist early in the second half but it was so hard to make consistent impact given how dominant United were.\nCM: Ruby Mace - 5/10 - Made a crunch goal-saving tackle at one stage but was ultimately always on the backfoot.\nCM: Hannah Cain - 5/10 - Arguably should have done better with a shot in the first half she lashed wel off target.\nRW: Remy Siemsen - 7/10 - Given a breathless introduction to English football but did show some brief moments of quality and took her goal really well. Just didn't see enough of the ball.\nST: Aileen Whelan - 5/10 - Played further forward than expected but worked really hard as the first point of the press. It was a thankless task as she saw so little of the ball.\nLW: Sam Tierney - 5/10 - Frustrations boiled over when she was yellow carded in the second half to cap off a really tough afternoon.\nSubstitutes\nSUB: Mackenzie Smith (46' for Reavill - 5/10\nSUB: Missy Goodwin (55' for Siemsen) - 5/10\nSUB: Monique Robinson (77' for Green) - 5/10\nSUB: Mollie Pike (77' for Tierney) - 5/10\nSUB: Ava Barer - (for Cain) - n/a\nManager\nWillie Kirk - 5/10 - Knows full well these aren't the games that will keep his team in the league.\nPlayer of the match - Alessia Russo (Man Utd)\nFor more from Jamie Spencer, follow him on Twitter!",
