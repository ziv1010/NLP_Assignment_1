They’re not a force to confront them, they’re simply an echo of them.”\n“They would make them worse. More taxes, more spending, more borrowing, more wokery, more nonsense. They wouldn’t hold them back, they’d encourage them to go further.”\nThe Ipsos poll also estimated that Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, would win his seat in Clacton and the party would return a total of three MPs.\nIt found that Jeremy Corbyn would lose his seat of Islington North to the new Labour challenger.\nThe MRP (multiple regression and post stratification) surveyed almost 20,000 UK adults to predict the results in each constituency up for election on July 4.\n10:00 PM BST\nThat’s all for today...\nThank you for joining The Telegraph’s live coverage of day 25 of the general election campaign.\nMy colleague Jack Maidment will be back tomorrow to guide you through the day’s developments.\n09:49 PM BST\nIn pictures: Nigel Farage in Clacton\n09:30 PM BST\nLabour government will buy up private beds for NHS, says Wes Streeting\nThe shadow health secretary has said he would buy up private beds for the NHS, in defiance of objections from “middle-class Lefties”, Laura Donnelly reports.\nWes Streeting said a Labour government would get the NHS to buy thousands of beds from care homes, to “unblock” a failing health and care system, while expanding use of private hospitals for state-funded operations.\nMr Streeting said there was “nothing Left-wing” about leaving working class patients to lie in pain because of “middle class Lefty” objections to the use of the private sector.\nRead more on this story from The Telegraph’s Health Editor here\n08:58 PM BST\nWatch: Farage takes to stage in Clacton to Eminem’s ‘Without Me’\nNigel Farage has concluded his event in Clacton, Essex, with voters.\nEarlier, the Reform Party Leader descended the stairs of Princes Theatre to the soundtrack of Eminem’s “Without Me”.\nFlanked by a pair of Union Jack flags and pyrotechnic flamethrowers, he strode onto the stage in a blue double-breasted blazer and revved up the crowd before commencing his speech.\n08:49 PM BST\nComedian Tony Robinson hits campaign trail for Labour\nBlackadder actor and writer Tony Robinson has hit the campaign trail for Labour in Filton and Bradley Stoke near Bristol.\nIn a video alongside Labour candidate Claire Hazelgrove, he said: “Fingers crossed.

Because the party in which these guys were elected now stands for nothing. It serves no purpose.\n“It’ll be incapable of standing up and fighting for the rights of the people in this country against what’s going to be a very weak Labour government.”\n08:26 PM BST\nBillionaire ex-Tory donor backs Labour\nA billionaire Conservative donor has announced he is backing Labour.\nJohn Caudwell, the founder of Phones4U, is a lifelong Tory who donated £500,000 to the party ahead of the 2019 election.\nOn Tuesday he said Rishi Sunak was an “absolute dud” as he endorsed Sir Keir Starmer.\nHowever, he criticised Labour’s plan to introduce VAT on private school fees, saying he was “not convinced that this is a positive policy”.\n“For many years now I have been rather despairing about the performance of the party that I have supported for the last 51 years: the Tories,” he said.\n08:23 PM BST\nFarage: I would not serve in the Conservatives alongside Lord Cameron\nNigel Farage has continued his war of words with Lord Cameron, saying he would refuse to serve in a party in which the former prime minister is a member, Cameron Henderson reports.\nLord Cameron last week accused Reform of deploying “inflammatory language and hopeless policy”.\nSpeaking at tonight’s event in Clacton, Mr Farage described Lord Cameron’s comments as “abusive”, adding: “I say to Lord Cameron, thank you very much, but I would not want to be part of a party in any way that you are a part of.\n08:07 PM BST\nNigel Farage takes to the stage in Clacton to speak to voters\nNigel Farage has condemned “slippery” Rishi Sunak on his failure to stop small boats crossings across the Channel, Cameron Henderson writes.\nThe Reform UK leader, who is standing for election in Clacton in Essex, has arrived at the Princes Theatre to address voters and answer their questions this evening.\nMr Farage said: “Since the Conservatives came to power, net 4.3 million people have come into this country.

Folks, I don’t believe a single word that slippery Sunak says, and nor, I suggest, should you.”\n08:02 PM BST\nTory minister insists UK is ‘generous-hearted’ to asylum seekers\nThe UK is “generous-hearted and open” to asylum seekers fleeing international crises, a Tory minister has insisted.\nChris Philp, the policing minister, said: “Where there are crises, this country, the United Kingdom, is generous-hearted and open.\n“So when there was the crisis in Syria when Assad was murdering his own people, we set up the UK resettlement scheme. We directly and legally and safely resettled 25,000 people from Syria and from refugee camps on Syria’s borders into the UK. That was the largest legal resettlement scheme in relation to Syria.”\nHe added: “I’ve mentioned Ukraine already, 200,000 Ukrainians have been welcomed here to the UK, a similar number of people from Hong Kong fleeing oppression by the communist regime, and Afghanistan.”\nChallenged on those from Afghanistan waiting to be granted asylum to Britain, Mr Philp said: “The Home Office is working to bring those people safely into the United Kingdom and that work is happening as we speak.\n“So where there is a real need, then this country rightly welcomes people, but it does have to be done in a safe and legal way. We’re probably going to come on to small boats later, but that is not the way to organise asylum.”\n07:55 PM BST\nPhilp: We should use our trade freedoms to trade more with developing world\nChris Philp has said that Britain should use its post-Brexit “trade freedoms” to trade more with the developing world in order to boost global prosperity.\nHe told the Channel 4 debate: “I don’t think mass migration would be particularly good either for the country where people were leaving, or indeed potentially Western countries to which people might be going, so I think we should try and find ways of avoiding that happening.\n“And there are two components, I think, to that. The first of those is peace and the second is prosperity. “\nHe added: “People can become more prosperous by building businesses, and by exporting and importing. Now, the UK has recently jumped up the export league table. We’re now, I think, fourth in the world for exports.\n“But I’d like to see us using our free trade freedoms we now have to trade more with other countries, particularly in the developing world.”\n07:41 PM BST\nLabour sets out how it intends to tackle the small boats crisis\nNick Thomas-Symonds has called the Rwanda scheme “completely unworkable” as he set out Labour’s plans for a Border Security Command to tackle small boat crossings.\nHe told the Channel 4 debate: “We would scrap the Rwanda scheme, which is completely unworkable. They poured hundreds of millions of pounds down the drain to essentially send two volunteers, and a couple of Tory home secretaries, there so far.”\nHe added: “There’s a small boat operations plan that’s part of Border Force. What our Border Security Command will do is bring together the Border Force, it will bring together immigration enforcement, it will bring together the Crown Prosecution Service international and, crucially, our security services.”\nAsked whether Labour would process the 40,000 asylum seekers who had come to the UK since 2023 and were “stuck in limbo”, Mr Thomas-Symonds said: “Well, that’s exactly what is going to have to happen.\nAnd what will happen then is those who are found to have no right to be here, we will get a proper enforcement and returns agreement in the Home Office, if we are privileged enough to govern, that will actually then deport people who are not entitled to be here.\n“That’s the flights that will be taking off on the Labour government, not wasting money on Rwanda.”\n07:24 PM BST\nPictured: Voters wait for Nigel Farage ahead of Clacton Q&A event\n07:19 PM BST\nGreens: Politicians ‘like to scapegoat migrants for problems with underfunding in public services’\nThe co-leader of the Green Party has said that a number of politicians “like to scapegoat migrants for the problems with underfunding in public services”.\nCarla Denyer told the Channel 4 debate: “If you meet a migrant in the NHS, they’re more likely to be treating you than to be ahead of you in the queue.\n“Now some politicians, and unfortunately, the list of which politicians that is is getting longer, like to scapegoat migrants for the problems with underfunding in public services.\n“When in reality, the cause of that is decades of decisions to underfund those public services by political parties.”\nShe added: “They could choose to make bold decisions about how you pay for public services and how you raise those funds, and the Green Party is the only party in England being honest about that.”\n07:11 PM BST\nWatch: Richard Tice challenges Labour on net migration\nRichard Tice, chairman of Reform UK, has challenged Labour on whether it had a target level of net migration.\nHe asked Nick Thomas-Symonds on the Channel 4 debate: “What’s the number of net migration that you think is right for this country?“\nThe Labour frontbencher responded: “Richard, a number is not a plan.”\nMr Tice said: “The truth is that the Conservative Party have allowed mass immigration in the last two years deliberately, in complete contrast to what they promised election after election.”\nHe added: “One person is arriving legally every minute. That means we need to build a new home just for those arriving every two minutes.”\n07:06 PM BST\nPhilp: ‘No question’ the British public want lower net migration\nThere is “no question” that the British public want lower net migration, Chris Philp has said.\nThe Policing Minister was asked to respond to a Channel 4 poll that found that fewer people trusted the Conservatives on their pledge to cut net migration than Labour.\nMr Philp told the Channel 4 debate: “Well, there’s no question that the British public want net migration to be lower. They’re right. We agree. It does need to be lower.\nHe added: “There were about 200,000 or more from Ukraine and a similar number from Hong Kong. But we need to get the family and work numbers down as well. And we have already, not in the future, but we have already taken action on that.”\n07:01 PM BST\nLabour and Tories clash over prisons\nLabour has accused the Tories of releasing prisoners deemed to be a threat to the public on its early release scheme aimed at tackling overcrowding in jails.\nThe scheme, introduced last year, allows prisoners to be released up to 70 days earlier, but Labour has refused to say whether or not it would be continued if they entered government.\nAsked whether or not the scheme would be kept under Labour, Nick Thomas-Symonds said: “We will not release prisoners who are assessed to be a threat to the public on that scheme, which is what this government has been doing. We need those 20,000 additional places.\n“What we will do is change the planning rules. We will declare this of national importance”\nChris Philp, the policing minister, told the Channel 4 debate: “Let me be clear that no one who is a threat to the public is ever going to get released early.\n“Last year, we had 35,000 more successful criminal justice outcomes than we had the previous year. That is to say, more criminals were successfully prosecuted.\n“We’re going to make sure the prison places are available to take them where necessary.”\n06:55 PM BST\nChildren need to be taught about misogyny at school, says Labour\nThe issue of misogyny needs to be addressed in schools, Labour has said.\nNick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow trade secretary, said that the problem of misogyny needed to be taught “before people are even adults”.\nAsked about how Labour would tackle the problem of misogyny, Mr Thomas-Symonds told the Channel 4 debate: “I think we absolutely need to tackle misogyny. I think we need to be addressing it in schools before people are even adults and coming into society.”\n06:47 PM BST\nSunak response to awkward ewe-turn in Devon\nRishi Sunak has responded to clips circulating on social media of sheep running away from him as he tried to feed them on a campaign visit in Devon earlier today\nA video posted to social media showed the Prime Minister leaning down holding a bucket as the flock ran in the opposite direction (see post below at 15.28), and it has quickly been leapt on by Labour.\nThe Prime Minister said that he would “never be ashamed to back our farmers”.\nGuess they weren't hungry 🤷♂️\nI will never be ashamed to back our farmers and buy British. pic.twitter.com/PzkvELwPVP— Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) June 18, 2024\n06:28 PM BST\nLabour council tax overhaul would push up bills by £1,230\nCouncil tax bills would rise by an average of £1,230 for more than four million households in England if Labour were to redraw the method in which the levy is calculated.\nAn overhaul of the property tax could add hundreds to annual bills – with some facing rises of as much as £4,609, according to an Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) analysis of house prices.\nLabour MPs have so far contradicted each other over council tax reforms with Sir Keir Starmer today failing to rule out an overhaul of the banding system.\nAsked whether there would not be an increase in council tax under Labour, the leader told LBC radio: “What I am not going to do is sit here two and a bit weeks before the election and write the budgets for the next five years”.\nUnder reforms, council tax bands could be completely re-evaluated and brought in line with current house prices. The Fairer Share think has also proposed replacing the current system with a “proportional” council tax.\n06:04 PM BST\nStarmer gets Labour candidate’s name wrong at campaign event\nSir Keir Starmer got the name of a Labour candidate wrong as he appeared alongside her at an event in her would-be constituency this afternoon, Dominic Penna writes.\nSir Keir said “I am so pleased to be standing with Olivia Blake” as he stood next to Olivia Bailey, the Labour candidate for Reading West.\nMs Blake, an MP since 2019, is the Labour candidate for Sheffield Hallam.\nSir Keir went on to correct himself and said Ms Bailey, one of his former aides, had been at the heart of “the change in our party”.\n“Liv Bailey is the person who did so much work for me, driving through policy for a changed Labour Party, a Labour Party that said no to gesture politics, and yes to the politics of service.”\n05:59 PM BST\nMore than 100 Tory-held seats ‘too close to call’, poll finds\nMore than 100 Tory-held seats are “too close to call”, a new poll has found.\nLabour has been projected to win 453 seats on July 4, in the latest poll by Ipsos, with the Conservatives winning just 115.\nBut the pollster also found that 117 seats were considered “too close to call” with a winning margin of less than five percentage points, more than 100 of which are held by the Conservatives.\nThey included 56 where the Tories are marginally in front of Labour, and 48 where Labour are ahead.\nThe poll predicted that Penny Mordaunt was at risk of losing her seat in Portsmouth North, along with Gillian Keegan in Chichester and Grant Shapps in Welwyn Hatfield.\nIt also projected that James Cleverly and Kemi Badenoch would hold onto their seats.\nIpsos also estimated that Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, would win his seat in Clacton and the party would return a total of three MPs.\n05:57 PM BST\nIn pictures: Akshata Murty visits Hindu temple on campaign trail\n05:41 PM BST\nStarmer says it will be a ‘summer of real change’\nSir Keir Starmer is hoping his Labour Party can hit the Conservatives for six at the general election next month, Dominic Penna reports from the Labour campaign trail.\nAnd the Labour leader was in confident form as he appeared this afternoon at Douai Park Pavillion, a cricket club in Mid Berkshire, alongside dozens of activists.\n“It’s good to see you all here, to be here in Reading, in the south in the summer... It’s very English, there’s a football pitch over there as well,” Sir Keir said.\nHe added: “This is what I hope will be a summer of real change. If you’re a family that’s been struggling these past few years, with the cost-of-living crisis bearing down on you and your business, if you’ve been serving in uniform, or serving your community, then this summer of change is for you.\n“This is an election that is about a very stark choice, about a very real change that we can put on the agenda.”\n05:21 PM BST\nLib Dems are ‘simply an echo’ of Labour, says Lord Cameron\nThe Liberal Democrats are “simply an echo” of Labour and would not hold a Starmer government to account, Lord Cameron has said.\nThe Foreign Secretary said that a Liberal Democrat opposition would not “confront” Labour and would make them “worse”, as he urged farmers in Norfolk to vote Conservative.\nThe Liberal Democrats have focused much of their campaigning on rural traditionally Conservative areas, as they hope to snatch seats from the Tories in the Blue Wall.\nSpeaking ahead of a Q&A session with Rishi Sunak, Lord Cameron said: “If you are worried by these polls and think somehow we might not win, but it’s important that they’re there to hold any future government to account, it’s really important you vote Conservative.\n“You vote for anybody else, you vote for the Liberal Democrats, they won’t hold Labour to account. They’re not a force to confront them, they’re simply an echo of them.\n“They would make them worse. More taxes, more spending, more borrowing, more wokery, more nonsense.

Farmers and rural voters are deserting him in massive numbers.\n“Farmers have been utterly taken for granted by the Conservative Party, left to cope with sky-high bills, bungled policies and botched overseas trade deals.\n“Liberal Democrats will stand up for people in rural areas and give them the fair deal they badly need through a £1bn rural rescue package. It’s clear that people are moving away from the Conservatives and backing the Liberal Democrats in many seats to kick them out of office.”\nThe Liberal Democrats have been focusing much of their campaigning on Blue Wall seats, including many in rural areas within the South West of England.\n04:13 PM BST\nReeves gets ‘No 11?’ keys cut at Timpson store\nRachel Reeves has visited a Timpson branch in Staffordshire and had a key made with a “No 11?” keyring as she pledged that Labour would back British business.\nThe shadow chancellor visited the shop with Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, and Labour candidate for Stafford, Eccleshall & Villages, Leigh Ingham.\nSharing photographs of her visit, including learning how to cut a key, on X, Ms Reeves wrote: “The key to a successful economy is backing British business”.\nShe is also pictured holding a key with a “No 11?” keyring, in apparent reference to her possibly getting the keys to No 11 Downing Street, the official residence of the Chancellor, if Labour wins the election on July 4.\n03:59 PM BST\nSunak attacks Labour over farming commitments\nRishi Sunak has attacked Labour over a lack of focus on farming in its manifesto, as he pledged that the Conservatives would put an extra billion pounds into farming support in the next Parliament.\nHe told farmers during a Q&A in Devon, introduced by Lord Cameron, that the Tories would “continue to support you with everything and anything that you need”.\nMr Sunak said: “Now the contrast at this election is crystal clear, because whilst we’re going to do all those things for you... in the Labour manifesto there were just 87 words about farming.\n“No commitment to food production and food security, no commitment at all about the farming budget in the next Parliament.\n“Forget about increasing it like we’re going to do, they won’t even say that they’re going to protect it, right? That is the choice for you at this election, which is why it’s so important that you come out and vote and you talk to your colleagues.”\n03:43 PM BST\nSunak: Badger culls ‘have to be part of the solution’ to bovine TB\nRishi Sunak has said badger culls “have to be part of the solution” for preventing the spread bovine tuberculosis to cattle.\nLabour has set out in its manifesto plans to “end the ineffective badger cull” by working “with farmers and scientists on measures to eradicate Bovine TB”.\nBut speaking at a Q&A with farmers during a campaign visit to north Devon, the Prime Minister said: “The success of the badger culls where we’ve done them have brought the incidence rates down by just over 50 per cent, so that shows that that plan is working.\n“I believe in the science. And yes, of course a vaccine is good and we’re investing in research and development but that is going to take some time. So culls have to be part of the solution.\n“And particularly when it comes to badgers, when you look around the world, there’s no country that I think I know of where they’ve eliminated TB in cattle without eliminating it in, whether it’s possums or badgers or the equivalent wildlife, which is why I think culls are important.”\n03:28 PM BST\nWatch: Sunak left sheepish after trying to feed flock\nRishi Sunak and Lord Cameron struggled to feed sheep on a campaign visit to a farm in north Devon.\n“Come on,” the Prime Minister said as the flock ran to the other side of the pen.\n“They don’t want to play ball,” a farmer accompanying Mr Sunak said.\nRishi Sunak and David Cameron are attempting to feed sheep at a farm in North Devon.

Well, it’s not a very hard thing for me to answer really.\n“I’m definitely of the school that says, biologically, a woman is with a vagina and a man is with a penis. I think we can say that quite clearly.”\nSir Keir said: “Yes, Tony is right about that, he put it very well.
