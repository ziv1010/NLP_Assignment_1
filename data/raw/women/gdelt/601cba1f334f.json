Why not win in style, eh?\nHere are the most beautiful kits on EA FC 25.\nLas Palmas Home\nHummel have always emphasised the 'less is more' philosophy, prioritising sleek, clean designs over bold and eye-catching designs. Their famous chevron pattern continues to grace football shirts across Europe, notably La Liga outfit Las Palmas.\nTheir yellow and blue colour scheme glistens on this Hummel jersey and would certainly look dashing on icons such as Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldinho and Paolo Maldini in Ultimate Team.\nNJ/NY Gotham Home\nBar a pretty naff sponsor, NJ/NY Gotham's home shirt for the current season is an absolute beauty, with the black and light blue colour combination working seamlessly together. The National Women's Soccer League outfit are one of the best dressed in the game.\nWith women's football added to Career Mode for the first time ever, the Bats could be an excellent choice with some well-dressed stars gracing the Red Bull Arena.\nAjax Home\nYou have to go deep into the history books to find an Ajax shirt that isn't a delight, with adidas always decking the Amsterdam side out in the finest threads each and every season. While their alternate kits often attract most attention, this year's home jersey is the one that stands out.\nThe thick vertical red stripe combined with the trademark white and a gorgeous collar makes Ajax the most stylish team in the Eredivisie for yet another season. With the Dutch giants in need of a rebuild, they could be a chic Career Mode option.\nSan Diego Wave Home\nCompeting with NJ/NY Gotham for the NWSL's coolest kit are San Diego Wave, who have released an incredibly, well, wavy shirt. This year's jersey is very San Diego, with Nike using a beach and wave design for 2024 that's very popular with supporters.\nFortunately, with the NWSL in EA FC 25, San Diego Wave's home jersey can be purchased on Ultimate Team or donned in Career Mode to dazzle opponents - even the CPU may be distracted by this groovy shirt.\nNewcastle United Away\nNewcastle United's 2024/25 away shirt is inspired by their famous 1995/96 holy grail shirt, with the deep red and blue horizontal stripes looking stunning in any century. adidas, who produced the original, have marked their return as the Magpies' manufacturer with a modern classic.\nNewcastle have plenty of talented players worthy of wearing this stunner, including the likes of Alexander Isak, Anthony Gordon and Bruno Guimaraes - or perhaps even Kylian Mbappe and Jude Bellingham given the Magpies' Career Mode budget.\nJuventus Third\nadidas have produced some absolute stunners for their elite sides for the 2024/25 season, with Juventus one of the beneficiaries. A suave navy blue beauty with gold accents and the old school Trefoil manufacturer's logo is almost stylish enough to wear to a wedding.\nThe Old Lady's away kit may be vomit-inducing but adidas have made amends with a sleek third shirt that may go down as an all-time classic.\nLyon Away\nDespite Paris Saint-Germain being France's most dominant and stylish club, it's normally Lyon who are best dressed in Ligue 1. They have consistently produced stunning home and alternate shirts dating all the way back to the 1990s.\nThis year is no different with a gorgeous black away shirt that boasts an 'OL' pattern throughout, with Lyon reprising their role as the kings of asymmetrical kits with red and blue shoulder stripes and side panels.\nLiverpool Home\nLiverpool will be reuniting with adidas for the first time in over a decade next season, with their short stint with Nike a tad underwhelming in the kit department. However, Nike have signed off with a banging home shirt for their farewell campaign.\nInspired by the European Cup-winning 1984 jerseys, the home kit boats a beautiful and asymmetrical pinstripe pattern, with 'YNWA' spelled out repeatedly. The collar has divided opinion but we think it's a snazzy addition.\nBayern Munich Third\nThis one is slightly copy and paste from Juventus' third shirt but Bayern Munich's dapper third kit for the 2024/25 season is the pick of the bunch from adidas. The colour scheme is gorgeous, with the various shades of red working beautifully on a cream base.\nFor those looking for a fairly straightforward Career Mode challenge, reclaiming the Bundesliga title with Bayern would allow you to experience this beautiful kit in all its glory.\nBarcelona Away\nBarcelona's away shirt for the current season has already been heralded as one of the modern greats. It's popularity has swiftly risen since its release and it's easy to see why so many are smitten with this particular number.\nA centralised badge is always a good start but the Barcelona crest and Nike logos are also black with red and blue gradients, adding a bit of spice to the kit. Much like Lyon's away shirt, asymmetrical side panels steal the show.",
