Ao Inter-District Football Championship 2025 commenced on Friday at the Indira Gandhi Stadium, Kohima, with the host district Kohima defeating Tseminyu in the opening match.\nThe opening goal of the trophy was scored by Kohima’s midfielder, Thejasetuo Gwirie in the 9th minute and taking the lead early on.\nThe second goal for Kohima was scored by its captain and midfielder, Kevisanyü Peseyie in the 49th minute.\nThe third and final goal for Kohima was scored by its forward, Kevizakie Ciesotsu in the 52nd minute which sealed the deal.\nThe inauguration ceremony was graced by the chief minister, Dr. Neiphiu Rio, who emphasized the significance of the tournament in uniting communities, celebrating football and carrying forward the legacy of the legendary Dr. Talimeren Ao.\nAddressing the gathering, the chief minister described Dr. T. Ao as Nagaland’s most iconic sporting figure and recalled that he captained the Indian football team during the country’s first Olympic appearance in the 1948 London Olympics. “Dr. T. Ao’s story as a barefoot footballer who led independent India at the Olympics is a powerful inspiration for every Naga,” Rio stated.\nHe urged the youth of Nagaland to draw motivation from Dr. T. Ao’s journey and aspire for excellence. “If he could do it more than seven decades ago without the facilities we have today, I firmly believe our youth—with today’s training, support, and infrastructure can achieve even greater heights,” Rio said. He further stressed that success in sports demands total dedication, sincerity, hard work, and perseverance.\nCM said that the Dr. T. Ao Trophy, which initially began as an inter-district tournament, has evolved into a prestigious platform for nurturing football talent in the state. He informed that the Government of Nagaland was deeply grateful to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) for renaming the Junior Girls National Football Championship as the Dr. T. Ao National Women’s Junior Football Championship, which will be hosted by Nagaland later this year.\nHighlighting the state government’s continued commitment to sports, Rio informed that two Naga footballers are currently undergoing training in Thailand. He added that Astroturf football fields have already been completed in six districts, while work in the remaining districts is ongoing. He also revealed that football fields are being developed in 28 locations and 31 multipurpose buildings are underway, with 13 set to be inaugurated this week.\nRio also noted that 16 footballers under the age of 20 and three coaches are receiving training under the Chief Minister’s Sports Scholarship scheme. He acknowledged that sports is no longer just a form of entertainment but a global industry valued at over $600 billion. He said initiatives like the Nagaland Super League had gained recognition from the national federation, and expressed pride in the growing footprint of Naga players.\nRio recounted a recent visit to the GSW Steel Factory in Bangalore, which has a dedicated sports complex training national and international players. He mentioned that 20 Naga boys trained there and won an exhibition match against a Bangalore team by 4–0.\nRio appreciated the organizers and expressing best wishes for the championship. “A boy from Changki village led India to the Olympics. I believe our youth can carry his dream forward. I commend the organizers and wish the 24th Inter-District Football Championship a grand success,” he said.\nConvenor of the Organising Committee and Kevipodi Sophie, MLA in his welcome address, extended gratitude to the Chief Minister for his continued support towards the promotion of football. He said the championship is not just a sporting event, but a celebration of unity and legacy. “For us, football is more than a game—it is a bridge that connects districts and tribes, fostering unity and healthy competition,” he said.\nNagaland Football Association (NFA) president, K. Neibou Sekhose, in his address, recounted that it was on the direction of CM Neiphiu Rio that the Inter-District Football Championship was renamed the Dr. T. Ao Trophy in 2004, and the Northeast Fraternity Gold Cup was renamed the Northeast Dr. T. Ao Trophy in 2009. He expressed heartfelt gratitude to the Chief Minister and the AIFF for renaming the Junior Girls National Football Championship to Dr. T. Ao, which will be hosted by Nagaland in November this year.\nHe noted that both junior and senior state football teams have been performing well at national-level tournaments, including the Santosh Trophy and various age-group championships. “In sports, merit determines success. Football transcends language barriers—it teaches teamwork, leadership, and discipline,” he said, calling on players to embrace both victory and defeat with grace.\nThe 24th edition of the Dr. T. Ao Trophy will continue over the next fortnight, featuring teams from across Nagaland’s districts vying for the coveted title.\nThe inaugural was compered by Medolenuo Ambrocia Loucü and Neidilhoutuo Sechü.\nInvocation was pronounced by NBCC General Secretary, Rev Dr Mar Pongener while the Halleuyah Chorus was presented by youths under Kohima Baptist Pastors Fellowship.\nSaturday’s Matches\nMatch 2: Tuensang Vs Mon at 9 AM\nMatch 3: Longleng Vs Chümoukedima at 11 AM\nMatch 4: Mokokchung Vs Wokha at 1 PM\nMatch 5: Peren Vs Meluri at 3 PM.",
