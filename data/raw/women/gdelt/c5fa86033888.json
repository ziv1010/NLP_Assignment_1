The Ted Lasso cast was stirring things up at the SAG Awards on Sunday, February 25. The show's stars, Jason Sudeikis, Hannah Waddingham, Juno Temple, Brendan Hunt, and others all wore matching AFC tracksuits at the SAG Awards after-party. Many were speculating it was because this would be their last award show together as a cast. But some cast members kept the hope alive of a possible season 4 of Ted Lasso during some red-carpet interviews. Nothing has been confirmed or denied by Apple TV, yet. For now, all Ted Lasso fans can do is wait and \"believe\"...\nIn the pre-award show interview with Laverne Cox and E! News, she asked Sudeikis if we could see more of Ted in the future. To which Sudeikis replied, \"I'm not sure if I am the only one to ask.\" Co-star Brendan Hunt then chimed in and said \"I have a mortgage now\" (because of the success of the show). \"Now we have to figure out what to do with those mortgages,\" Sudeikis joked.\nAnother Ted Lasso star who wasn't afraid to drop any season 4 hints at the 2024 SAG Awards is Juno Temple. The star, who portrays Keely Jones, said in an interview with Extra TV that \"no one has been officially told no, and no one has been officially told yes\". Temple also said that even if season 4 doesn't happen, she's open to the possibility of a spin-off series.\nMore Ted Lasso Season 4 Rumors...\nThe rumors of a season 4 of Ted Lasso started around November last year when cast member Nick Mohammed shared this Tweet. Hard to believe that Apple TV producers wouldn't have something up their sleeve if they let this slide.\nBut wait, the rumor mill still hasn't stopped spinning. Phil Dunster, aka Jamie Tartt, added fuel to the fire in an interview with People during the 75th Emmy Awards. When asked about the third season being the last season, PureWow reported that Dunster responded with \"Well, if it is the final season\". And like the answers from his co-stars, he clarified to say, \"We just don't know (yet).\"\nWhat Could Happen In Season 4?\nDie hard Ted Lasso fans hang on to hope for a possible reboot with a line from Rebecca: \"It’s that I refuse to accept that you’re not coming back.\" In the final episode, we see Ted at home coaching his son's soccer, err football, team. Roy Kent has taken over AFC Richmond's head coach role. And Keely comes to Rebecca with the idea of starting a Richmond women's team. Even if Sudeikis doesn't come back as the main star of the show, certainly, there is plenty of room for cameo scenes or other spin-off ideas. Only time will tell...\n‘Ted Lasso’ Finale: Where Do The Characters Go From Here?\nAfter three seasons, Apple TV's Ted Lasso ended after dropping its series finale yesterday (May 31). The producers have always said that it will end after three seasons. Jason Sudeikis, who stars as the title character, developed the series with Bill Lawrence, Brendan Hunt (who plays Coach Beard) and Joe Kelly, told Deadline that, \"This is the end of this story that we wanted to tell, that we were hoping to tell, that we loved to tell.\" But Sudeikis and his team have expressed being open to spinoffs. And surely Apple TV would love to continue the stories of at least some of the characters. On the other hand, Apple is a company that prides itself in innovation. Many streamers put a lot of work into bringing back old characters (Disney+ mostly lives off of new stories in the Marvel and Star Wars universes, Paramount+ has done well by spinning off The Good Fight from The Good Wife and preserving the Star Trek universe). But Apple is a company that the iPod revolutionized; and when the iPod became obsolete, they quietly said goodbye to it.\nOn the one hand, the finale neatly wrapped up the most compelling storylines. It may not have been perfect, but neither is life - that's sort of Ted Lasso's message. But unless you're a troll, it was a pretty satisfying ending. They nailed the landing in a way that few series have. On the other hand, they certainly left room for more stories to be told.\nSo we thought it would be fun to look at where our characters ended up, and how their stories can continue in potential spinoffs or specials. It should go without saying but we'll say it anyway: There are spoilers ahead, so don't read this unless you've finished the series.",
