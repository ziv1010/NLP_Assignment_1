There’s a whirlwind of hotel development in host cities Casablanca, Agadir, Fez, Rabat and Marrakech, plus the Waldorf Astoria hotel group will make its North African debut next year in Tangier. Visit now to enjoy the pre-tournament build-up, or, if you’re not a football fan, escape to the Atlas Mountains for some soul-cleansing hiking or into the Sahara Desert to camp under the stars. Morocco specialist By Prior Arrangement offers group and tailor made itineraries. See bypriorarrangement.com\nNorway\nNorway adds to its already impressive scenic rail credentials next year with the opening of the Norient Express (get it?), a six-day journey from Bergen to Trondheim using swish electric trains complete with onboard observatories. Culture lovers should check out Bodo, just north of the Arctic Circle, which will still be basking in the afterglow of being European Capital of Culture for 2024, plus Kunstsilo, an innovative new modern art museum in Kristiansand housed in a restored grain silo. For cyclists, 2025 will be the year to tackle the recently re-opened Stalheimskleiva, Norway’s steepest road with 13 thigh-testing hairpin bends.

Sign up now.\nPortugal\nWhile Lisbon has been enjoying the limelight for a few years now, the rest of Portugal is still relatively undiscovered. Sister city Porto is equally endearing, cascading down the hillsides of the Douro Valley with a historic waterfront and centuries-old port houses. And as the Danube and the Rhine get increasingly congested, river cruisers are discovering the delights of the Douro, a less-crowded alternative flanked by picturesque vineyards. Nobu and Six Senses will make their hotel debuts in Lisbon in 2025, but for something less mainstream, head 30 kilometres inland to Sintra, an enchanting town of manicured gardens and pastel-hued mansions. See visitportugal.com\nMexico\nYou’ve probably heard about Mexico’s mystical Mayan ruins, the Yucatan Peninsula’s pristine beaches and the country’s exuberant Day of the Dead festivities. But what about its high-end culinary scene? Last year, Michelin launched its first Mexico guide, awarding stars to 16 restaurants. Or how about its flourishing wine industry? The country has 14 wine regions, the most popular being Baja California’s Valle de Guadalupe, which has more than 150 vineyards. Visit one of the country’s 170-plus Pueblo Magicos for a unique cultural offering, or head to Copper Canyon to see legendary long-distance runners the Tarahumara Indians. See visitmexico.com\nSpain\nDon’t be put off by the Barcelona over-tourism horror stories, the country still has plenty of uncrowded gems to discover. Our top tip for next year is Andalusia, an autonomous region on the south coast with stunning beaches, fabulous national parks and seven UNESCO World Heritage sites. Check out the soon-to-open OKU Andalusia or base yourself in the vibrant student city of Granada, home to the imposing Alhambra hilltop palace. Wine lover? Plan your trip around the Rioja Wine Harvest Festival in September, a week-long celebration featuring grape stomping, parades and, of course, plenty of tastings. See spain.info\nAlbania\nIt’s hard to believe that less than 40 years ago, Albania was one of the world’s most isolated regimes. However, thanks to 450 kilometres of glorious coastline along the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, a spectacular mountainous interior (the 17-kilometre trek from Theth to Valbona is a match for anything in the Alps) and a burgeoning wine industry, this tourist upstart is poaching visitors from nearby Croatia and Greece. To experience the country’s dramatic Accursed Mountains and the electric energy of its rapidly developing capital, Tirana, check out Intrepid Travel’s 10-day hiking trip in the Western Balkans. See albania.al; intrepidtravel.com\nChile\nNo other country can match Chile for geographical variety. From epic stargazing in the high-altitude Atacama Desert and trekking in the snow-dusted peaks of Patagonia, to exploring Pucon’s sparkling lakes and the cultural mysteries of Rapa Nui (Easter Island), this skinny South American nation is a magnet for outdoor enthusiasts. While the capital Santiago has experienced some civil unrest in recent years, the country offers exciting new offerings, including an Atacama outpost of eco-conscious brand Our Habitas. See visitchile.com\nSaudi Arabia\nSince opening to tourists in 2019, Saudi Arabia has set an ambitious target of attracting 150 million visitors a year by 2030. The centrepiece of this strategy is AlUla, an ancient oasis city surrounded by dramatic rock formations. Home to the country’s first UNESCO World Heritage site, the 2000-year-old Nabataean tombs at Hegra, the development already has stylish resorts by Banyan Tree and Our Habitas with properties by Chedi, Aman and Six Senses on the way. For some, Saudi’s human rights record will always be an issue, but with an increasingly progressive outlook, it’s clear that change is afoot. See experiencealula.com\nEngland\nThere’s something for everyone in England next year. Sports fans can cheer on the Red Roses in the 2025 Women’s Rugby World Cup. Hikers will be able to tackle the entirety of the 4350-kilometre-long King Charles III England Coast Path and Britpop fans can relive the ’90s with the much-anticipated Oasis reunion concerts. London will see a flurry of high-profile hotel openings, including the Waldorf Astoria in Admiralty Arch and a Six Senses London in Bayswater. See visitbritain.com\nGeorgia\nWedged between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, this bite-sized former Soviet state is an intriguing cultural cauldron of Soviet, Ottoman and Persian influences. Home to four UNESCO World Heritage sites, the world’s oldest wine-making culture (they’ve been at it for 8000 years) and the dramatic Caucasus Mountains, Georgia has exploded on to the tourism scene over the last few years and will only get more popular now it has EU candidate status. Starting and ending in the vibrant capital of Tbilisi, World Expeditions’ 10-day Transcaucasian Trail Hike Georgia showcases the country’s diversity and scenery. See worldexpeditions.com\nJapan\nNeed a reason to explore beyond Japan’s major metropolises? Next year sees the return of the Setouchi Triennale, an intriguing contemporary art festival held across the islands and coastal areas of the sparsely populated Seto Inland Sea. The Sapporo Snow Festival will mark its 75th anniversary in February with an icy celebration of all things wintry and a new art museum designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Tadao Ando will open on Naoshima Island. See japan.travel\nKyrgyzstan\nWhile Kyrgyzstan can’t compete with neighbouring Uzbekistan for man-made wonders, it’s more than a match for scenic ones. The Switzerland of Central Asia is a bewitching montage of sky-piercing 7000-metre peaks, snaking glaciers and plunging pine valleys. Embark on a trek through the Tien Shan mountains, stay with a nomadic family in a yurt or scale a mountain pass on horseback. The fact that it’s the cheapest of the Stans and offers visa-free travel for Australians only adds to its appeal. Experience the highlights of both countries on Crooked Compass’ 15-day Uzbekistan to Kyrgyzstan tour. See visitkyrgyz.com; crooked-compass.com\nNew Zealand\nThere’s a slew of reasons to hop across the ditch next year. Te Matatini, the premier Maori performing arts festival, is coming to Taranaki in February and the iconic Huka Lodge will re-open in March after an extensive refurbishment. Cardrona Alpine Resort will officially become New Zealand’s largest ski resort thanks to a new chairlift and an extra 150 hectares of terrain. And if that isn’t enough, 2025 will also see the unveiling of the Kawarau Gorge Cycle Trail, a scenic 32-kilometre-long track connecting Queenstown’s vineyard-peppered Gibbston River Trail with Central Otago’s gravity-defying Lake Dunstan Trail. See newzealand.com\nTurkey\nProviding a geographical and cultural bridge between Europe and Asia, Turkey is a unique fusion of two colliding continents. History buffs come to marvel at Istanbul’s magnificent mosques and the Roman ruins of Ephesus and Troy. Adventure seekers take to the skies over the otherworldly desert landscape of Cappadocia and beach bums frolic in the pristine coves of the Turquoise Coast. No surprise then that G Adventures included Turkey in its latest Geluxe Collection, active itineraries with elevated accommodation, dining and cultural experiences that have been particularly popular with solo travellers 30 and over. See goturkiye.com; gadventures.com\nUnited States\nWith so much happening in the US next year, the biggest challenge is where to start. San Francisco’s former Hearst newspaper headquarters will be transformed into a luxury hotel in Union Square. New York will welcome its first Faena property. One&Only will make its US debut in the Montana wilderness and New Orleans will get its first Fairmont. For country music fans, the big event will be Opry 100 which celebrates the 100th anniversary of Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry with special concerts and tours. See visittheusa.com.au\nSouth Korea\nGiven the recent explosion of Korean culture in the West, it’s easy to forget that less than 30 years ago South Korea was an impoverished autocratic backwater. Today, the country has it all – from the tech-obsessed capital of Seoul and the golden beaches of Busan to ancient pagodas in Jeonju and world-class hiking in Seoraksan National Park. Although the events and festivals of Visit Korea Year (2023-2024) is now winding up, it’s not too late to jump on the K-train and see what all the fuss is about. Regional specialist InsideAsia is your best bet for tours. See english.visitkorea.or.kr; insideasiatours.com\nSweden\nMeteorologists are predicting a peak in solar activity next year, which should translate into spectacular northern lights all over Scandinavia. While optimal viewing conditions will occur in the frigid depths of winter (think minus 30 degrees), it’s also possible to see them in Sweden’s Lapland region during autumn (September and October). Head an hour north of Lulea and you’ll find a scenic medley of lakes, rivers and forests peppered with architect-designed treehouses, floating spa hotels and rustic log cabins. Spend your days hiking, biking, kayaking and foraging, then settle back and enjoy the show. See swedishlapland.com; fiftydegreesnorth.com\nUzbekistan\nUzbekistan’s journey from one of Central Asia’s most insular nations to arguably its most welcoming is nothing short of astounding. It’s hard to overstate the appeal of this former Soviet heartland, from the remarkable array of mosques, shrines and madrassas in the Silk Road cities of Samarkand, Bukhara and Khiva to less-explored regions like the Fergana Valley and the Nuratau Mountains. Lonely Planet named it one of its top destinations for 2024 and next year will only see more visitors discover the country’s unique cultural and architectural delights. Explore the best bits on G Adventure’s 10-day Highlights of Uzbekistan trip. See uzbekistan.travel; gadventures.com\nWhich country is on your must-do list for 2025? Post a comment below",
