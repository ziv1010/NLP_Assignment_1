  "body_text": "Football fans from Uzbekistan have experienced lengthy airport screenings on arriving in the United Arab Emirates to attend a World Cup qualifying match that could, in the event of a win for their team, send the Central Asian country into its first FIFA World Cup.\nMore than 100 Uzbek fans who traveled to the UAE ahead of the June 5 game between Uzbekistan and the United Arab Emirates were “detained” at Sharjah airport for seven to nine hours on Monday, the Gazeta.uz media outlet reported. A journalist from the outlet who was among the passengers on the flight said women and elderly people were let through first, but many men were held for long periods.\nThe delays, which prompted the two governments to hold negotiations aimed at improving the situation, come just over a month after warnings that the visa-free arrangement between Uzbekistan and the United Arab Emirates could be in jeopardy because of an increase in violations by Uzbek citizens in the emirates.\nIn March, a court in Abu Dhabi sentenced three Uzbek citizens to death after they were convicted of murdering Zvi Kogan, an Israeli-Moldovan rabbi whose body was discovered in the Emirati city of Al Ain in 2024. In April, more than a dozen Uzbek nationals were detained after a street brawl in Dubai in which some people were stabbed and one was reportedly killed.\nFollowing the recent airport delays for football fans, a spokesman for Uzbekistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said its diplomats in Abu Dhabi and Dubai held urgent negotiations with UAE officials.\n“According to the UAE, screening times at airports are increasing due to increased security measures in the country in connection with various international events,” ministry spokesman Akhror Burkhanov said on Telegram. “Currently, all resources have been mobilized to quickly screen our citizens, and as a result, they have begun to enter the country.”\nUzbekistan’s national team is second with 17 points in Group A after Iran, which has already qualified. FIFA says “a point in Abu Dhabi would send Uzbekistan into a maiden FIFA World Cup,” but the Central Asian team can still qualify if it then beats Qatar at home.\nThe World Cup will be held in the United States, Canada, and Mexico in 2026.",
