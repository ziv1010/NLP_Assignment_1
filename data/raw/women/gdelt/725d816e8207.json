  "body_text": "'Purple' Dan Kay remembered ahead of final Goodison Park Merseyside Derby\nTonight's final league derby at Goodison will be tinged with sadness for many reasons and for the friends and family of celebrated former ECHO journalist Dan Kay, it will carry a special significance\nWhatever happens after the whistle blows at 7.30pm this evening, the 245th Merseyside Derby will undoubtedly be tinged with emotion for both Everton and Liverpool supporters as the last fixture between the two teams at Goodison Park.\nAfter 130 years, Everton are set to move into their new home at Bramley-Moore Dock at the end of this campaign. But memories of Goodison Park derbies - both good and bad - will forever be etched into the minds of fans.\nBut while memories will predominantly be of on-the-pitch heroics, icons and villains, victories and defeat, the impending Everton move to Bramley-Moore Dock has also left many reminiscing about fellow supporters who are no longer with us.\nAnd while following Everton or Liverpool has become an increasingly partisan affair during the modern era, there is one fan whose absence will be felt across all historic stands of the famous stadium.\nDan Kay, an award-winning Liverpool ECHO journalist and Hillsborough campaigner, died aged 45 in May 2023. Dan worked at the ECHO for almost two decades, across news and sport, between 2003 and 2021. After his death, Dan was awarded a posthumous doctorate by Liverpool Hope University, while then Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp held a one-minute silence at his weekly press conference. There was also applause at Anfield and a tribute in Parliament.\nDan was a driving force for Hillsborough justice, both in his personal life and with the ECHO, where he was central to the coverage of the fight for justice that followed the 1989 disaster, most poignantly of the inquests ruling that 97 innocent men, women and children were unlawfully killed as a result of the tragedy.\nDan was a passionate and ardent Liverpool fan, following the Reds around the globe and writing eloquent and popular histories about the club and its extensive list of characters. But, unusually, and owing the fact his father Vic was an Evertonian, Dan had a deep association with The Blues as well, earning him the nickname 'Purple Dan' among his ECHO colleagues.\nDan worked closely and sensitively with many of the families who were impacted by Hillsborough, including Anne Williams, whose 15-year-old son Kevin died in the disaster. Alongside Anne's daughter Sara, Dan co-wrote the book With Hope in her Heart, detailing Anne's fight for justice, forming a close personal friendship with Sara in the process.\nSara Williams told the ECHO ahead of the final Merseyside Derby: \"As much as Dan wanted Liverpool to win, he would always think of his blue friends. He would always say he was happy with a draw, but still be buzzing if we won. I know this evening he would want to win while thinking of his Everton friends because it is the final derby at Goodison Park.\"\nLiverpool supporter Jimmy Pilnick, who has attended 22 fixtures between Everton and Liverpool at Goodison Park, all of them alongside Dan, told the ECHO: \"The walk along the Bullens Road back in April was the hardest ever as it was my first without Dan.\n\"His passion for and knowledge of Liverpool was renowned, but he had a soft spot for Everton and Goodison Park. In fact, he regularly attended games with his late dad Vic, and I’ll let you into a little secret - he went to Goodison before he went to Anfield.\"\nJimmy added: \"Dan sorted my first ever away derby ticket at Goodison. It was 2-2 going into injury time, Liverpool got a free-kick about 44 yards from goal, and you can guess the rest. Dan shouting “It's in!\" in a state of disbelief as Gary McAllister did the unthinkable is still vivid over 23 years later. We stood together in many memorable away ends after that.\n\"Dan also warned me nothing would ever prepare me for seeing Liverpool lose at Goodison for the first time. I got to test that in the Lee Carsley derby in 2004. He was so right.\n\"I remember us queuing up outside Goodison in 2016, and Dan was speaking about Everton’s proposed move to Bramley-Moore Dock and how there wouldn’t be too many more trips to Goodison, and how he’d miss it. Being able to have a pint by Anfield before walking to Goodison is unique. Dan loved that aspect of Derby day.\"\nAt the ECHO, Dan was a universally popular member of the team among both Everton and Liverpool supporting colleagues, and his enthusiasm for both clubs was consistently on display in the newsroom.\nGreg O'Keeffe, who spent a decade covering Everton for the ECHO, explains: \"Dan was a rare character - in so many ways - but it showed with his approach to derbies. He had this sense of equanimity that was totally natural. It was never feigned or insincere.\n\"For example, the day after a derby defeat for Everton, he’d discuss it with such balance and good nature, even though his team winning had given him such delight. He’d be counselling you about how it would improve or could have been worse. It's just how he was. A truly empathetic and considered person.\n\"That’s how he would have been thinking about this last Goodison derby. Not so much that winning it would be another marker in Liverpool’s march towards the title, but about how poignant it was going to be to face off in a stadium he was fond of one last time.\n\"He would definitely have known more about the history of the fixtures than most, he’d have had some novel idea for a special feature and he’d probably have plugged himself into a really worthwhile long-read series or podcast to mark the occasion.\n\"He’d also have reflected about his dad, a blue, and what it would have meant to him. Because even though he wasn’t around anymore, Dan would always think about him around Merseyside derbies. Now, when searching for signs of decency and fraternity in an increasingly toxic atmosphere around these games, we at least we can think of Dan.\"\nAcross the other side of the newsroom, James Pearce, who previously covered Liverpool for the ECHO, added: \"Both before and after Merseyside derbies, Dan was always the voice of reason in the Liverpool Echo offices.\n\"He was Red through and through, and celebrated cherished triumphs over the neighbours across Stanley Park as much as anyone. However, win, lose or draw, he kept things in perspective. You wouldn't find him either gloating or hiding in the corner.\n\"This fixture has certainly become more toxic since I started writing about Liverpool nearly 20 years ago and Dan hated when that reality came to the fore. He had so many friends on both sides of Merseyside's great divide.\n\"His perfect world involved Liverpool leading the way with Everton not far behind. He was always championing this special city and he knew that having two strong clubs at the heart of it benefited everyone.\n\"Aside from wanting to beat them twice a season, he never took any satisfaction from the Blues' struggles. I hope the last Goodison derby is a fitting tribute to Dan - competitive and full-blooded, but with anger, resentment, bitterness and controversy kept to a minimum.\"\nAnother Liverpool supporter who shared a close personal friendship with Dan was Ben Hart. Reflecting on the final Goodison Park clash between the two sides, Ben said: \"Derby day meant so much to Dan. If you knew Dan, you knew his admiration for Everton that gained him the Purple Dan nickname with so many people.\n\"We would meet up before the match in the Twelfth Man and listen to Dan talk about every single detail of each team and how he thought the game would pan out. He was always interesting. He was an absolute encyclopedia of football knowledge. I’m sure all of Dan’s friends, red and blue, will be thinking of him before, during and after the game.\n\"Merseyside derbies aren’t the same without Dan and never will be again. But the memories myself and many of Dan’s friends have of so many moments during these games, both high and low, we will hold dear because Dan was with us.\"\nThroughout his life, Dan supported and championed causes and organisations that strived to help others, including delivering hampers to underprivileged families on Christmas Eve, serving food to to the homeless on Christmas Day and working closely with local charities such as An Hour For Others.\nSince Dan's death in May 2023, aged 45, his family, friends and former ECHO colleagues have launched The Dan Kay Foundation to further his legacy, raising over £20,000 through charitable initiatives including football matches, marathons and endurance challenges. The money has funded mental health and suicide crisis awareness projects, foodbanks and a host of local youth organisations and campaigns.\nJimmy Pilnick, who is part of the Foundation, added: \"Dan’s writing was a cut above. But then again Dan was a cut above. He’d have written a masterpiece doing justice to tonight's historic occasion. He’d have been magnanimous in victory and gracious in defeat. That was the Dan Kay we knew and loved, and the legacy we continue to honour.\"\nAnd while The Dan Kay Foundation continues to further that everlasting legacy, 'Purple Dan' will be on the mind of numerous Blues and Reds throughout today and beyond.\nSteve Kelly, an Evertonian and close friend of Dan's, reflected: \"For me, this derby will be about Dan and how much I miss him. I remember us walking to Goodison Park together as great friends, and then we would part ways for 90 minutes. Then, regardless of the result, we met up and were great friends again. That's what derbies mean to me. The most important part of the game is that we were still friends. I'm going to miss that forever.\"",
