The players only recently returned to New Jersey for training ahead of their NWSL Challenge Cup match against the San Diego Wave on Friday.\nAdvertisement\n“It wasn’t ideal, (the Gold Cup) … six games in a few weeks with basically the players going there unprepared,” said Gotham coach Juan Carlos Amorós. “I think we are always talking about protecting our players and protecting their health and safety, and that’s definitely not the case.”\nGotham and the Wave will inaugurate the 2024 season with the Challenge Cup, although the match doesn’t count as a regular season game. The champions and Shield winners face off at Red Bull Arena in a single-match game that retools the original multiple-match Challenge Cup format. Ahead of the game, players and coaches spoke about the crowded international calendar this year and its potential impact on health and safety.\n“I think it’s a balance,” said Gotham midfielder Crystal Dunn, who returned from USWNT camp earlier this week. “If fans can have a chance to watch us play more than the 24 games that are scheduled then we understand, as players, yes, that’s exciting. I think players also want to be protected.\n“I am always going to be on the side of supporting the players and making sure that it is done in such a safe and protected way where people can walk out of that moment and still be able to have enough in the tank to give to the season when it starts back up.”\nThis year, multiple NWSL players joined their teams in the Gold Cup, a new tournament involving nations in the CONCACAF region as well as four CONMEBOL countries: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Paraguay. For the two teams that played in the final, Brazil and the United States, that meant six games over 16 days. Canada and Mexico played five games in that window, with Canada twice having to go to extra time during the knockout rounds, including the infamous Canada-USA rain game.\n“There’s so many competitions on the men’s side and that just increases viewership visibility, excitement from the fans, things to play for, which is fantastic,” said Gotham and USWNT defender Kelley O’Hara. “That’s what you want, and that’s what we want on the women’s side. But all of the other things need to be in place, potentially, before you get to be able to have that many games.”\nAdvertisement\nGold Cup is just the latest addition to an increasingly busy women’s calendar: the Olympics are this summer, but NWSL is set to introduce an international tournament during that time for clubs to remain active. CONCACAF also announced a new qualification tournament, the W Champions Cup, to begin in August as the region’s sole qualification for the new FIFA Women’s Club World Cup.\nGO DEEPER\nConcacaf to launch women's tournament offering route to Club World Cup\nThere are also CONMEBOL tournaments like the Copa Libertadores Feminina held in October and Copa América Femenina later this year to qualify for the Women’s World Cup.\n“There’s going to be a lot of responsibility on ownership and clubs to build their franchises properly in terms of roster size, talent depth, but then also all of the other things that are on the support staff side of clubs,” O’Hara said. “How we travel, the amount of PTs, the amount of people to take care of what it takes to play that many games in a season. … There are a lot of things that need to speed up and speed up very quickly from ownership, from front office, and from technical support.”\nThe NWSL is continuing to work on raising minimum standards, including those related to sporting staff requirements, and improving daily training environments.\n“We will ensure that we do everything we can that’s in our control to support their careers and ensure they have as long as possible careers for as long as they want to play,” NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said.\nThe players also pointed out that, after the primary concern of player safety, tired players make for worse games, which makes it harder to attract fans.\n“As players we love to play games, but we also want to play quality football,” said San Diego midfielder Savannah McCaskill. “There’s a difference between quantity and quality. And so the more and more that we just keep adding to the schedule, it’s harder for us to recover.”\nAdvertisement\nBerman told The Athletic earlier this week she agrees that “the players are being squeezed.” The commissioner reiterated that NWSL has tried to minimize midweek games and clashes with the international calendar this season. That adjustment should help alleviate travel issues in a country where clubs routinely have to make coast-to-coast flights. The topic came up again on Thursday as San Diego said they had no input in the location of the match, according to Wave head coach Casey Stoney.\nGO DEEPER\nNWSL commissioner on players getting ‘squeezed’ by calendar, World Cup momentum and more\n“I think (Challenge Cup venue is) something that should be brought to the players and the coaches as a discussion topic rather than just a decision made by anybody else,” said San Diego and Canada goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan.\nPlayers did say that the league arranged a charter flight to get the Wave to New Jersey, a decision that may not be limited solely to the Challenge Cup, shifting the future of the NWSL forward.\n“It was the league’s decision,” Stoney said. “Recently, the league is looking to add more legs to charter flights, so teams do have that option. So I do think in terms of player welfare, we are moving in the right direction.”\n“That was very helpful to have this travel,” Sheridan said. “I’m really thankful that we had the opportunity to charter here. It made the trip a lot more beneficial and easier on our legs.”\nSheridan said players are usually limited to choosing between an aisle or window in basic commercial seats while frequently enduring cross-country flights that are comparable to crossing the whole of western and central Europe.\n“We’re going on the biggest flights of any league and in order to do that, sometimes we have to connect, sometimes we have to sit in the back of the plane,” Sheridan said. “The league gets to make that decision, and I hope that going forward that decision gets changed because that ultimately has a big impact.”\n(Top photo: Meg Oliphant/Getty Images)",
