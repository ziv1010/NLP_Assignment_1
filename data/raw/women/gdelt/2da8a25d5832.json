He also claimed that he suffered from depression and insomnia, as a result of what had happened to him.\nIt also affected his relationship with family members and left him unable to deal with his late wife's cancer, the court also heard.\nMr Sheehan, a father and grandfather, is well-known in sporting circles and had previously played football for Athlone Town and other clubs in the League of Ireland.\nHe also played GAA locally and inter-county football for Westmeath.\nHe had many relatives who had served in An Garda Síochána, including his grandfather, father and a son-in-law, and had almost become a member himself, the court heard.\nHis son Alan Sheehan played soccer professionally in England for many years, including spells at Leeds United, Leicester City, Luton Town and Notts County, and had also been capped at U-21 level for Ireland.\nAlan Sheehan has also coached at clubs including Southampton, Luton and Northampton.\nIn its defence the State's lawyers argued that Mr Sheehan was arrested after two others in his company had been observed by gardaí piggybacking in the middle of the street, causing a hazard to traffic.\nThe State also claimed that during the incident Mr Sheehan had acted aggressively towards the gardaí, and that he was pepper sprayed after another person had assaulted one of the gardaí, and matters had got out of hand.\nIt was claimed that Mr Sheehan said to the gardaí dealing with the matter: \"Don't you know who I am,\" and \"you better have a good solicitor\".\nIts response to the public order incident was reasonable and proportionate, the defendants submitted.\nThe defendants also said that Mr Sheehan had admitted after his arrest that he had consumed five or six pints of beer that night.\nMr Sheehan rejected all of the State's allegations and said that he had only consumed one pint of beer shandy and had only been in the pub for a relatively short period on the night in question.\nThe case, which ran for several days was heard before a civil jury of five women and seven men presided over by Mr Justice Alexander Owens.\nThe jury, after deliberating for just over an hour, found that the gardaí had used excessive and unreasonable force in its dealing with Mr Sheehan.\nIt also found that he had been assaulted both in the back of the garda car, and in the yard of Athlone Garda Station following his arrest.\nMr Sheehan was entitled to damages of €505,000, the jury further found.\nHe was also awarded his legal costs against the State by the judge.\nMr Justice Owens thanked the jury for its service and exempted them from having to do any further jury duty for 10 years.\nThe judge placed a stay on the order in the event of an appeal to the Court of Appeal if €75,000 is immediately paid by the defendants to Mr Sheehan.",
