The pandemic resulted in nearly 40 percent of the nation’s 3.2 million Black-owned businesses facing closure, prompting the NBL to collaborate with Stellantis as the founding sponsor for three years, receiving additional support from MPS Group, a prominent Black-owned BE 100 company. The program already has generated millions in contracts for Black businesses.\nBlack businesses seeking to capitalize on this exceptional opportunity for growth, development, and increased market access can now apply for the third cohort of the program here.\nTrinity Health, Schoolcraft College Partner to Offer Employees New Career Paths\nSchoolcraft College and Trinity Health Michigan, both in Livonia, announced a program to provide tuition assistance for Trinity Health employees seeking brighter career paths in eight critical health care fields.\n“This big pipeline of talent from Trinity Health will get access to everything they need right here on the campus of Schoolcraft, from the classrooms of our new Health Sciences Center to Trinity Health’s on-campus community healthcare facility,” says Glenn Cerny, president of Schoolcraft. “There’s nothing like this in Michigan.”\nWhile other health systems offer tuition reimbursement for employees, this partnership of two Livonia-based enterprises is unique because it provides full tuition assistance to current employees and Schoolcraft students who express interest in working for the health system.\nTrinity Health will prioritize flexibility so current employees can work while in school. This allows students who would otherwise be unable to financially attend school to further their education. In addition, the partnership offers a tailored workroom-to-classroom pipeline at a community college whose campus includes a private health system facility. The Trinity Health Michigan facility opened on the Schoolcraft campus in 2021 to offer a continuum of care to Livonia residents, the surrounding communities, and Schoolcraft students and faculty. The center includes primary, specialty, and urgent care, as well as pharmacy, surgery, advanced imaging, and other ancillary services.\n“This is a win-win-win-win,” says Rob Casalou, president and CEO of Trinity Health Michigan and Southeast Regions. “Trinity Health employees get a new career path for little or no tuition. Schoolcraft gets a pipeline of students. Trinity Health Michigan deepens our bench of first-class healthcare talent. And the communities of Southeast Michigan benefit from a continuum of Trinity Health Michigan services at the conveniently located Schoolcraft campus.”\nPet Supplies Plus to Host Adoption Event at Detroit Lions Training Camp on Thursday\nLivonia-based Pet Supplies Plus will host the first adoption event at the Detroit Lions Headquarters and Training Facility in Allen Park on Thursday.\nOccurring during the Lions training camp, dogs of various breeds and ages will be available for adoption from 7:30-11 a.m.\nMarked as Pet Adoption Day at the Detroit Lions training camp, Pet Supplies Plus has partnered with local rescues including Bark Nation, Macomb County Animal Control, and Friends of Detroit Animal Care and Control who will have adoption-ready dogs.
