This isn’t a column stating or yelling or pretending to believe that having 64 teams in the men’s World Cup is the best, smartest, most efficient or generally most optimal way to stage soccer’s grandest event.\nThere is no blindness here to all the things that probably popped into your head when you first heard the number 64 attached to the competition, and let the brazen excess of it hit your sensibilities.\nAdvertisement\nYet while arguing for such an increase — like a delegation of South American soccer politicians and actual politicians did in meetings with FIFA president Gianni Infantino this week regarding the 2030 World Cup as The Athletic reported on Wednesday — seems painfully hasty, that doesn’t necessarily mean the concept is as manifestly stupid as some will surely suggest.\nYes, for a soccer tournament, 64 is a huge number. Yes, it is fully four times the size of the now-quaint total of 16 teams that were granted access to eight of the 22 men’s World Cups.\nAnd yes, tears will long be shed for the much-loved format of 32 teams that lingered all the way from France ‘98 to the last rendition in Qatar, and was almost perfect in its uniformity and neatness. But that ship has sailed now, with an increase coming next summer, when 48 teams will turn up in the United States, Canada and Mexico and take part in a historically high 104 games.\nWith that format yet to be tested, it is no wonder that any further bloating would be met with skepticism in the extreme, but the reality is that 64 actually covers up some of the flaws within the 48-team system, and it doesn’t bring in too many fresh points of obvious complaint.\nThe big sticking point that critics of 64 will put forward is that this much expansion would dilute the field too much and take the drama and suspense out of qualification. There is no avoiding that to some extent, for naturally the extra 16 participants would mostly be teams that wouldn’t otherwise have been good enough to make it.\nThere are some caveats, however, The flip side is that such a big field is highly likely to include all the big teams you’d want to see. While it would undoubtedly be fun for Italy’s rivals if the Azzurri missed out for a third straight time in 2026, it could also be safely argued that the tournament may benefit overall from the presence of such a storied soccer nation.\nAdvertisement\nMore spots also brings hope and opportunity to a fresh batch of nations, some suddenly presented with a genuine chance of qualifying instead of needing a miracle.\nA suggestion here is to loosely expand the current number of available spots by around a third. Moving forward, one possible option could see 20 places for UEFA (up from 16), 12 for Africa (up from nine), 12 for Asia (up from eight), eight for CONMEBOL (up from six), eight for Concacaf (up from three, plus the three 2026 host nation places) and two for Oceania (up from one). Two further spots would be reserved for winners of an intercontinental play-offs similar to the one that will take place in March 2026.\nOne sizeable bonus of a perfectly square number like 64 is that it takes away the ugliness that comes with shoehorning 48 teams into 32 knockout spots, which is what will happen in 2026 and is essentially the same as 24 teams going into 16 qualifying spots, as with the current European Championship, the 2015 and 2019 Women’s World Cups, and the men’s tournament from 1982 to 1994.\nIn theory, although unlikely, a team could manage one draw and two defeats in its group next summer and still make it through. Is being one of the eight best third-place finishers enough to be worthy of continued involvement? Having 64 teams erases all that nonsense and ensures any permutations take place within each group, rather than the requirement for a separate table listing the best third-place teams. As with the 32-team field, fail to land in the top two, and you’re out.\nThe other knock on expanding to 64 is that it makes the World Cup too big. On the surface, of course that is a fair point. But it’s too big for whom? The fans?\nSports fans have shown an unquenchable appetite for more of what they like. America’s college football playoff has risen from just two teams in 2013 to 12 currently, with 16 looming large on the horizon. Twenty teams play beyond the end of the NBA’s regular season. The NFL and MLB postseasons have all expanded. In soccer, the Women’s World Cup was at 16 teams as recently as 2011; it will be triple that size in 2031. And so on.\nA more pertinent concern would be if a World Cup with more teams meant a longer World Cup. However, in terms of timespan, 64 does not need to be any longer than a 48-team version.\nAdvertisement\nWith 16 groups, there would be 96 group games. A sample schedule might look like two games on the opening day, four on the second (FIFA likes fewer games on the opening days for higher visibility), then six per day for the next 15 days.\nThat would mean 17 days of group action (the same as 2026), by which point the field is again whittled down to 32, keeping the rest of the schedule the same for a 39-day total.\nTo be clear, the 64-team proposal put forward by Infantino’s visitors was for 2030 only to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the first World Cup. But don’t think for a second that FIFA would decrease the size of the competition once the toothpaste is out of the tube.\nAs for logistics, finding six time slots in the day to play games isn’t going to work, unless you like hash browns and orange juice with your soccer fix. The suggestion here is that those six daily games are played in four time windows. The best game would be allocated into the preferred TV window, often the 7pm local time slot in Qatar, the second-best game into the next best slot and so on. The fifth and sixth game of each day would be “doubled up,” essentially played at the same time as another match. Those games could still be watched of course, either on a secondary channel or through streaming, but wouldn’t need a time slot of their own. Not inspired by Uzbekistan vs El Salvador? No problem, watch the other game instead.\nConvinced yet? Now’s the time to pull back a little, for despite the enthusiasm of the South American group, who have made no secret of the fact that their countries would like to host some of the additional games of an expanded tournament — instead of just one each to kick the event off as is currently planned — there is nothing guaranteed.\nOpposition is strong, with UEFA, Asia and Concacaf region heads already having all spoken against super-sizing the showpiece event. Whether or not Infantino, who marches to his own tune and is capable of bold decisions that defy prior conformity, is swayed, remains to be seen.\nIf he is, a 64-team World Cup would truly be behemoth in terms of size and scope. But, for all that, it may not be as much of a mistake as current perception suggests.\n(Top photo: Norberto Duarte/AFP/Getty Images)",
