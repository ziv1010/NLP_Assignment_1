  "body_text": "Arsenal Women's U16s side clinched an incredible league title and an invincible season this weekend with a 4-1 win over Brighton & Hove Albion.\nOur young Gunners won 11 matches and drew just three in the entire season, rising to the top of the FA Girls' England Talent Pathway League and conceding only four goals in the process.\nTop scorer Isabella Fisher bagged 13 goals in only 10 appearances for our Gunners, with Omotara Junaid and Vivienne Lia getting on the scoresheet nine times across the season. The age group is led by Head Coach Dom Edwards and Assistant Coach Kieran Fox, with U21s Head Coach Elliot Allum also helping to oversee training.\nHighlights across this unbeaten campaign include victories over league rivals Chelsea home and away, including a 3-0 away win at Cobham, and travelling to Manchester in the quarter-final of the Youth Cup and putting eight past City.\nWe're back in action for another shot at silverware and the end to a perfect season on April 22, taking on Manchester United in the Youth Cup final. Come on you Gunners!\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
