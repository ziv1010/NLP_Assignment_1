It is a childhood dream and something I didn’t think would be possible.”\nLJ is ‘something special’ – Lucy Bronze\nEngland defender Lucy Bronze is convinced forward Lauren James can make an unparalleled contribution to Euro 2025 after her two goals inspired the Lionesses to a vital 4-0 victory over the Netherlands.\nChelsea forward James only returned from a three-month hamstring lay-off in late June but, moved out wide on Wednesday night, reminded everyone watching how capable a catalyst she is as the Lionesses bounced back from their opening defeat to France.\n“We know we just need to get LJ the ball in dangerous positions and there could be a goal from anything,” said James’ Chelsea team-mate Bronze.\n“She is probably the best player in this entire tournament for something special.”\nOlivia Smith set for milestone move\nArsenal are set to make Olivia Smith the first £1m player in the women’s game after agreeing a world-record fee with Liverpool.\nThe PA news agency understands a seven-figure deal has been accepted for the 20-year-old forward.\nIt is anticipated that Smith’s move to Arsenal will eclipse Naomi Girma’s £900,000 switch to Chelsea from San Diego Wave in January.\nLiverpool were reluctant to sell their player of the season, having only signed her last year from Sporting Lisbon, but felt Arsenal’s offer was too good to turn down.\nSmith now appears cleared to have her medical at Arsenal, who are believed to have seen off competition from a number of clubs for the forward – including Women’s Super League champions Chelsea.\nKudus in, Gibbs-White set to follow\nOur new #️⃣2️⃣0️⃣ pic.twitter.com/DbRMj0ShZw\n— Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) July 10, 2025\nTottenham announced the signing of Ghana forward Mohammed Kudus from West Ham on Thursday night – and look set to close in on a £60million deal for Nottingham Forest midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White.\nSpurs are rebuilding under Thomas Frank and agreed what is understood to be a £55million deal for Kudus.\nThe 24-year-old leaves the Irons having made 80 appearances and scored 19 goals during a two-year spell after joining from Ajax.\n“I have always wanted to play at the highest level,” Kudus said on the Tottenham website.\n“How big the club is, the history, and (in) the Champions League as well, so it is a big moment.”\nNottingham Forest midfielder Gibbs-White is, meanwhile, set to have a medical at Tottenham ahead of a proposed £60m transfer.\nSpurs have met the England international’s release clause and a deal is accelerating at pace, the PA news agency understands.\nWhat’s on today\n🗣️@montse_tome: \"Details are key from this stage of the competition onwards.\"\n👉The national team coach answered journalists' questions ahead of the clash against Italy.\n🔗 https://t.co/9FXYBQ7nKj#WEURO2025 |#JugarLucharYGanar pic.twitter.com/DHXCDbTkR9\n— Spanish Football (@SpainIsFootball) July 10, 2025\nAt Euro 2025, Spain will be looking to secure top spot in Group B when they take on Italy in Bern.\nLa Roja have already made sure of a place in the last eight with two impressive wins, while Italy can also qualify if they avoid defeat or Portugal fail to beat Belgium in Sion.\nEngland and Wales are both holding media sessions ahead of their Group D clash in St Gallen on Sunday night.\nElsewhere, Chelsea continue their preparations in New Jersey ahead of the Club World Cup final against Paris St Germain.",
