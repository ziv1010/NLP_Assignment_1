  "body_text": "Folashade Ijamilusi scored three goals to supercharge the Super Falcons’ 4-1 thrashing of the Algerian women’s national team in the second leg of the double-header friendly encounter.\nThe Edo Queens striker was the best player on the pitch as the Falcons defeated the Algerians on Tuesday at the Mobolaji Johnson Arena in Lagos.\nThe victory was the Falcons’ second over the North African opponents in four days. The team had secured a 2-0 win over the Algerians on Saturday in Ikenne.\nNigeria’s line-up was a refreshing mix of foreign-based and home-based footballers. Only Rasheedat Ajibade, Tosin Demehin, and Gift Monday started the game while Chiamaka Nnadozie was on the bench.\nAdvertisement\nIjamilusi put the Falcons ahead after just 10 minutes. She pounced on a header inside the Algerian goal area and toe-poked the ball into the net.\nShe doubled the team’s lead with another archetypal poacher’s finish after Blessing Ilevieda’s effort struck the woodwork.\nShortly, the Algerians halved the deficits through Alouache Ouassila.\nAdvertisement\nThen Monday Gift restored Falcon’s cushion with a deft header off Esther Onyenezide’s corner kick.\nIjamilusi completed her hattrick of goals for the game in the 89th minute. The last season’s highest goalscorer in the Nigerian Women’s Football League (NWFL) tapped in from close range to wrap up the exciting victory for the Falcons.",
