A record 14 sides took part this season.\nThe zone hopes this will be the case from the start of next season, with clubs possibly nominating for a grade.\n\"It would be a bit intimidating for some of the teams when they play the top sides and we don't want to go out and annihilate another side,'' Lambert said.\nLambert is a 10 year veteran with the club and thinks she's been captain for the past five or six.\n\"I think we've won five or six comps,'' she said.\n\"The majority of players will be back next year. We'll lose a few of the younger girls who will go to uni, but we regenerate pretty well.''",
