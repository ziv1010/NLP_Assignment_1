  "body_text": "On Friday, Mesa College will cap its athletic year by holding the community college’s annual Student-Athlete Graduation and Transfer Ceremony.\nMore than 100 athletes completing their two years as Olympians will be transferring to four-year schools, splitting more than a record $3 million in scholarships (and counting).\n“Beyond what we do on fields and courts, the transfer ceremony is one of our annual highlights,” said Mesa College athletic director Ryan Shumaker. “We’re here as a step. We’re here to see our athletes compete at the next level in both sports and academics.”\nSaid track/cross country coach Sean Ricketts: “We recruit them in and recruit them out. When we bring an athlete in, we promise to help them develop, open doors and move on. That’s what we preach to them … we’re here to help, but make the most of this opportunity.”\nAlso on hand Friday will be the Chet DeVore Trophy. Named in memory of a decorated World War II Marine officer who became a coach, educator and founding president of Southwestern College, the trophy goes annually to the local community college that has the best record of overall excellence in the local Pacific Coast Athletic Conference.\nMesa College has won the award for seven straight years.\nThis year, the Olympians won PCAC titles in men’s cross country, track and field and volleyball and women’s cross country, volleyball, track and field and beach volleyball. In addition, the football team was ranked No. 1 among county teams.\nThe Olympians also thrived at state-level competitions. Mesa won three state championships, sweeping the men’s and women’s cross country titles and claiming the beach volleyball crown. They also finished second in the state in men’s track and field and volleyball and third in football and women’s track and field.\n“We’re all very proud of holding the DeVore Trophy,” said Shumaker. “As a school and coaches, we’ve created an atmosphere where developing students and athletes can thrive.”\nMesa finished the school year strong by winning its first state title in beach volleyball then coming away with podium finishes in both men’s and women’s track and field.\nThe beach volleyball team was led by Myah Gomez and Jaiden Mojica, who finished third in the state in the individual competition. A year ago, Gomez and Kailyn Jager won the individual title.\nA native of Salinas, Gomez came to Mesa College after serving in the Air Force. Mojica is a graduate of Bonita Vista High School.\n“Gomez is what community colleges are all about,” said Mesa coach Kim Lester. “She joined the Air Force out of high school. This was her opportunity to relaunch herself. She loves beach volleyball. I recruited her by being able to go off a video she sent me of her playing on the beach sand talking to her on the phone.\n“I have so much pride in Mesa College and what we do here. I love what we all do here. The coaches here have bought into the goal of bringing in athletes, coaching them up and finding a spot for them to continue with a scholarship.”\nLester was named the PCAC All-Sports Female Coach of the Year. Brian Hiatt-Alew, who led Cuyamaca College to its first-ever state title in soccer, was named the PCAC All-Sports Male Coach of the Year.\nThe last Olympians to compete this year were the members of Rickett’s track and field teams.\nMesa College claimed seven of the eight events won by local athletes at the state meet.\nIan Rosen (Grossmont High School) won the 800 meters with a time of 1 minute, 51.97 seconds. Rosen, who also led Mesa to the cross country title with a fourth-place finish last December, then finished fourth in the 1,500 meters at 4:02.48.\nMesa won the men’s 4×100 relay for the first time in school history. The foursome of Josh Schindler, Ryan Mann, Marcel Acosta (El Camino High School) and Austin Snook (Bonita Vista High School) were clocked in 40.82 seconds. The Olympians also won the 4×400 relay in 3:12.65 with the team of Acosta, Shamarion Unden (El Capitan High School), Mann and Jaden Dasher (Oceanside High School).\nRon Way (La Jolla High School) was timed in 31:30.82 to win the 10,000. He also finished third in the 5,000 meters (15:31.68). Lucas Scott (Mission Hills High School) won the javelin with a throw of 206 feet, 1 inch. Dasher also won in the 400-meter hurdles in :52.52.\nJoelle Tonne of Mesa College (Oceanside High School) won the women’s 800 meters (2:17.17), finished third in the 1,500 meters (4:47.04) and ran a leg on the Olympians’ 4×400 relay team that ran fourth.\nEvery week during the school year, U-T contributor Bill Center highlights one San Diego college team that’s making strides on and off the field.
