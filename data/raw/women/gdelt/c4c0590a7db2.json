You were wrong!!\nWhy can't we just defy FIFA and take them to court and let a judge decide\n#EvansOut\nWhy wouldn't you?\nThis young lad may have to provide for a lot of people.\nHe is going to always follow the money.\nI've no gripes about that. It's more of a cultural thing which we have to accept.\nAnd don't tell me being Category 1 status does not get you advantages because why else would those who have it guard it so jealousy?\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
