  "body_text": "The wait for the official confirmation was about as long as the time it took to get the transfer done from start to finish, but almost a full day after the January transfer window slammed shut, Chelsea have finally announced the signing of “illustrious” midfielder Keira Walsh from Barcelona.\nOfficial: Chelsea FC Women sign Keira Walsh from Barcelona\nBOOM!\nThe 27-year-old has signed a 4.5-year contract with the Blues, returning to England after 2.5 years in Spain. She had just six months left on her contract at Barcelona, where she’s won pretty much everything possible in the last 30 months, including back-to-back Spanish league titles and back-to-back Champions League trophies. Let’s hope we can make it three in a row for her!\nChelsea have reportedly paid a transfer fee of just €550k for Walsh, which is barely a third of what Arsenal were supposedly ready to bid over the summer. Hah!\n“It’s unbelievable. I’m very happy to be here and very excited to get started. You look at the history of the trophies Chelsea have won and I’m an ambitious player and person, so for me, it is a good fit.\n“Speaking to Paul Green, Sonia and [assistant manager] Camille [Abily], I just got such a good feeling from them. It has been really positive. I want to play for this club and fight for the badge.”\n-Keira Walsh; source: Chelsea FC\nWalsh has been the midfield lynchpin of not only Barcelona or Manchester City before then, but the England national team as well, and we can expect her to fulfill a similar role now, helping us control the midfield and elevate our game even higher.\n“Keira is a player who will add huge value to an already talented squad. She has vast experience at the highest level, winning major honours at both domestic and international level.\n“She is a composed defensive midfielder, with excellent technical attributes and world-class football intelligence. Her playing style and ability to dictate the tempo of the game will be crucial to our game model as we move forward.”\n-Paul Green; source: Chelsea FC\nCombined with the (world-record) signing of defender Naomi Girma, it’s been an amazing, transformative, statement-making January transfer window from Chelsea.\nWelcome, Keira! Let’s keep winning all the things!",
