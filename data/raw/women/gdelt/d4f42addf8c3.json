  "body_text": "Former Chelsea player starts career in porn\nFabio Paim, once considered one of Portugal’s most promising football talents, has made a surprising career shift to the adult film industry.\nPaim, who came through Sporting CP’s renowned academy alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, was tipped for stardom but never fulfilled his potential. Throughout his career, he was on the books of 19 different clubs, including a brief loan spell at Chelsea in 2008, though he never played for the first team. Despite his early promise and representing Portugal at youth levels, his football career stagnated.\nNow 36, Paim has ventured into adult entertainment. He revealed his aspirations in an interview with Thiago Paiva, expressing his desire to star in a pornographic film. His wish has since come true, with a sex tape now available for purchase.\nDiana Cu de Melancia, one of the women in the video, praised Paim, saying, “We thought he would be nervous, but Fabio turned out to be a lion. He was good at football and he’s good at porn.”\nPaim admits his transition to this new career was challenging but ultimately fulfilling. Reflecting on his football career, he expressed regret, acknowledging that his mindset had been focused on women and partying rather than the sport.\nDespite his natural talent, Paim believes his poor decisions prevented him from reaching the heights of clubs like Barcelona or Real Madrid.\n[Image via Shutterstock]",
