  "body_text": "Quiver Distribution is about to introduce a little extra romance and drama into the music industry with its upcoming film Off the Record. Releasing on demand and digital in less than a month, the debut feature from stuntwoman-turned-filmmaker Kirsten Foe stars Mad Men alum Rainey Qualley as rising star singer-songwriter Astor Grey, whose life and career are rocked to their core amid her whirlwind romance with rock's washed-up bad boy Brandyn Verge, played by Veronica Mars veteran and recent Night Court recurring star Ryan Hansen. Instead of a love story, however, it evolves into a darker exploration of the astronomically high stakes of the industry, complete with cameos from a few real stars who have been to the heights of fame. We're excited to feature Foe's first feature film as part of Collider's Exclusive Preview event for upcoming summer movies and share an exclusive image highlighting Astor's journey.\nThe new shot pairs Qualley up with Rebecca De Mornay, whose character is there to support Astor in an upscale office for what's likely to be an important meeting for the future of her career. Throughout the story, Astor will fight tooth and nail to reclaim her autonomy and music in a business full of opportunists trying to take it all away from her. Chief among them is Verge, who promises her a chance at true superstardom yet proves to be another manipulative presence in her life that tests her resilience as an artist and a person. It's meant to be an evergreen story reflecting an all-too-common and troubling dynamic between powerful men and women while also encouraging other young women to chase their dreams regardless of the people who try to derail all they've worked for.\nAlongside the trio of Qualley, Hansen, and Mornay in Off the Record is a supporting cast featuring Olivia Sui, Julia Campbell, and Will Peltz, among others. Another highlight, however, is the slate of exciting cameos, including a fellow musician, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top fame, Hall-of-Fame quarterback and ever-present face of football Peyton Manning, and his former Indianapolis Colts teammate and fellow Canton inductee Edgerrin James. Adding to the Colts connection is the team's owner, Jim Irsay, who served as an executive producer for the film, joining a production team that included Foe and Gabe Rodriguez as producers.\n'Off the Record' Will Showcase Some Great Tunes Courtesy of Qualley\nOff the Record was a big undertaking for Foe, who had previously provided stunt work on The Affair, 2017's Twin Peaks revival, and Grimm, among other things. Her first feature got plenty of help from a multitalented crew, though. Supervising the music was George Drakoulias, who served in a similar capacity on Barbie, Severance, and more, but it was Qualley herself who performed many of the songs, from her original compositions “Take What’s Mine” and “See Me Cry,\" to old songs under her performing name Rainsford like \"2 Cents” and “Love Me Like You Hate Me,\" and renditions of Bruce Springsteen's \"I'm on Fire\" and The Decemberists' \"Los Angeles, I’m Yours.\" All of her songs will be featured on her latest album, which will be released alongside the film, yet that's not the end of the musical talent on display. Scout LaRue Willis and Kyle Gass also offered original compositions for the feature, along with a team-up between Jason Isbell and Brandi Carlile for a new version of the Tom Petty and Stevie Nicks classic, \"The Insider.\"\nOff the Record will be available on digital and on-demand platforms on May 2, 2025. Check out the exclusive image above and you can also listen to a new track from the film below.
