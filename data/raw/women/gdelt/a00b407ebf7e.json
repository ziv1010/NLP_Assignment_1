Salamanca Mayor Cesar Prieto said in a statement posted to social platforms that the gunmen arrived at the end of a soccer match. Ten people died at the scene and one died later at a hospital. The mayor said a woman and a minor were among the wounded. Prieto said the attack was part of a “crime wave” in the city and appealed to President Claudia Sheinbaum for help to control the violence. The... -\nStarmer would be a fool to follow Carney in embracing Beijing\nSir Keir Starmer recently tried to take credit for his role in Donald Trump’s partial climbdown on tariffs relating to Greenland. Whether he played any meaningful part is debatable. What is beyond doubt, however, is that Donald Trump will happily reach for the tariff weapon again whenever it suits him. Even against long-standing allies, and especially against those he believes are acting against US interests. Just look at Canada and the increasingly heated rivalry between Trump and the country’s prime minister, Mark Carney. The president last week threatened eye-watering tariffs of 100pc on all goods and services entering the US.... -\nNBA Union Says ‘Players Can No Longer Be Silent,’ Calls for ‘Solidarity’ with Those ‘Risking Their Lives to Demand Justice’\nThe National Basketball Players’ Association (NBPA) is siding with the anti-ICE protesters in Minneapolis, saying their players “can no longer remain silent,” accusing the efforts by law enforcement to apprehend illegal and violent criminals of sowing “division.” The statement comes one day after the league postponed the scheduled Saturday matchup of the Minnesota Timberwolves and Golden State Warriors after a shooting involving federal agents and an armed protester. The player’s association’s characterization of Minneapolis as a city “at the forefront of the fight against injustices” seems to be a reference to the 2020 death of George Floyd. This incident set... -\nDangerous Incaution: Snow Leopard Pounces on Selfie-Seeking Skier\nA female skier was mauled by a snow leopard after getting too close to try to take a photo, with a chilling video capturing her being led away with blood pouring from her face.The footage shows the victim lying prone in the snow wearing a purple ski suit after the animal mauled her on Friday evening in Fuyun County at the northern Chinese border with Mongolia.She is then seen being taken away from the scene with blood pouring from her face. -\nStrong Buyers Market In Housing! 47.1% More Sellers Than Buyers\nIts some kind of wonderful … for home buyers. Home sellers outnumbered buyers by 47.1% in December 2025, the largest gap since Redfin data began in 2013. The percentage jumped by +7.1 points from November, the biggest monthly increase since September 2022. The number of active homebuyers fell -5.9% MoM to 1.34 million, the lowest level on record. Meanwhile, home sellers declined -1.1% MoM to 1.97 million, the lowest since February 2025. By comparison, in November 2021, there were 36.5% fewer sellers than buyers. This all comes as elevated housing costs and economic uncertainty continue to push buyers to the... -\n[Catholic Caucus] New Vienna archbishop’s consecration Mass features women in key roles, altered rituals\n[Catholic Caucus] New Vienna archbishop’s consecration Mass features women in key roles, altered ritualsThe heavily altered liturgical rite visually emphasized a concept of ecclesial authority as emerging from the gathered community rather than the Church’s established hierarchy. Josef Grünwidl was ordained Archbishop of Vienna on Saturday in a ceremony at St. Stephen’s Cathedral. The rite included notable deviations from the liturgical texts, with an emphasis on layperson involvement, including women-led roles in the ceremony.On January 24, Josef Grünwidl was consecrated archbishop during a solemn Mass in Vienna, Austria, after having been appointed by Pope Leo XIV as successor to Cardinal... -\nPeter Schiff on Tucker\n@TuckerCarlson Gold has so dramatically outperformed the S&P this century that you’d think CNBC would be recommending it to investors.

CNN Claims Trump Agenda ‘Could Work’ but Will Hurt Americans\nReading CNN’s ridiculous hot takes on the Trump economy is enough to knock a few points off your intelligence quotient. Its TDS-afflicted reporters consistently behave as if writing in contradiction just to sour public opinion doesn’t affect the credibility of their arguments. CNN Business Senior Writer Allison Morrow didn’t even try to hide the inconsistency in her January 23 anti-Trump screed headlined, “Trump’s ‘run it hot’ economic strategy could work — but it’ll cost Americans dearly.” Did you catch that? If Trump’s economic plans work out as intended, how will it hurt Americans? Wouldn’t that outcome be the antithesis of... -\nGold at $5,000 is not a rally. It’s a verdict.\nGold crossing $5,000 an ounce is not a technical breakout, a speculative frenzy, or a “risk-on trade.” It is a judgment. Silver pushing past $100 last week only reinforces the point. These prices are not expressions of optimism about growth or productivity. They are expressions of doubt: about currencies, about governments, and about the institutions charged with preserving economic stability. What makes this moment different is not simply the level of prices, but the speed and unanimity with which investors have arrived at them. Gold did not grind higher over a decade of slow erosion in confidence. It vaulted. Silver... -\nMette Frederiksen and Her Denmark First Immigration Agenda\nThe international attention given to the Denmark Controversy (not the subject of this article) is an opportunity to look at Danish immigration policies. Denmark has some of the toughest immigration policies in the Western world — arguably the best, with the exception of the Visegrad countries, which don’t have much immigration to begin with. Consider this: Mette Frederiksen, current prime minister of Denmark, is not a right-winger, but a member of the center-left Social Democrat party (Socialdemokratiet) . Nevertheless, her party was elected in 2019 on a platform which included stricter immigration policies. In January of 2021, Prime Minister Frederiksen... -\nSenate Democrat calls for investigation into TikTok deal\nSen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) called for an investigation Friday into a deal that saw TikTok’s American business spun off into a separate entity in order to allow the app to continue operating in the U.S. The deal was finalized Thursday, with TikTok announcing it had officially established the new U.S. venture. “After over a year of Donald Trump illegally extending the TikTok deadline, this TikTok deal raises many more questions than answers,” Markey said in a statement. “Despite my repeated requests for information, the White House has provided virtually no details about this agreement, including whether TikTok’s algorithm is truly... -\nLatest Trump Truth Social post re:Minnesota\n-\nTrump accuses Minnesota leaders of inciting insurrection amid fatal ICE shooting\nPresident Donald Trump accused Minnesota officials of “inciting insurrection” after Saturday’s shooting of an unnamed 37-year-old who allegedly attempted to pull out a firearm as federal agents tried to detain him. The president shared a photograph of the gun authorities alleged belonged to the man, defending Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents after the fatal shooting. “AMONG OTHER THINGS, THIS IS A ‘COVER UP’ FOR THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN STOLEN FROM THE ONCE GREAT STATE (BUT SOON TO BE GREAT AGAIN!) OF MINNESOTA!“ Trump fired a post to Truth Social. Trump called out Minnesota Governor Tim Walz... -\nTrump says ICE ‘will leave’ Minneapolis as clashes break out\nDonald Trump has said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents will leave Minneapolis, after clashes broke out following the shooting of a protester.The US president did not give a timeline for the withdrawal of federal officers, but promised: “At some point, we will leave. We’ve done, they’ve done, a phenomenal job.”The White House is under pressure over the killing of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse, on Saturday.Mr Trump twice refused to answer whether the officer who shot Pretti had done the right thing. “We’re looking,” he told the Wall Street Journal. He said his team was “reviewing everything and will... -\nVoters feelings about the affordability of the following items:\nVoters feelings about the affordability of the following items: Transportation: 🟢 Affordable +53 Utilities: 🟢 Affordable +53 Food: 🟢 Affordable +47 Groceries: 🟢 Affordable +43 Having a family: 🟢 Affordable +7 Health Care: 🟢 Affordable +3 Housing: 🔴 Unaffordable -10 Education: 🔴 Unaffordable -24 NYT/Siena poll | 1/12-1/17 RV -\nTwo Members of a Portland Antifa Cell, Armed with Rifles and Pistols, Charged in Attempted Murder Shooting\nInside a Portland Antifa cell: arrests, weapons and an attempted murder. PORTLAND, Ore. — Two trans members of an Antifa cell in Portland, Ore. were arrested over an attempted murder shooting attack. Rem Heathen, real name Michael Richard Fadich (born May 20, 1987), and Jennifer “Feya” Michelle Bitgood, real name Shawn Michael Bitgood (born May 1982), were allegedly involved in an attempted murder on Dec. 21, 2025 in the Mt.

The body of 28-year-old Rebecca Rauber was found covered in snow in a wooded area of Emporia on Sunday, near where she was last seen leaving a bar days earlier, police told KWCH. Police said Rauber was located by K-9 Daisy of K-9 Search and Rescue Kansas. Rauber, a second-grade teacher at Riverside Elementary School, is believed to have died from hypothermia just hours after she disappeared.

Like many others, I just turn my head,” he wrote on Truth Social. “The ridiculous new Kickoff Rule takes away the prestige and power of the game,” he continued. He concluded by saying he hoped college football didn’t follow suit. The league instituted a new format for the 2024 season in which the kicker stays on his team’s 35-yard line but the rest of the coverage unit lines up on the opposing team’s 40-yard line. They cannot move until the ball hits the ground or a player in the designated landing zone —... -\nTim Walz Says He Will Do Anything To Keep Minnesota Residents Safe Except Cooperate With Federal Law Enforcement\nSAINT PAUL, MN — With tensions between ICE agents and leftist protesters in Minneapolis running high, Governor Tim Walz said he was willing to do anything to keep Minnesota residents safe except cooperate with federal law enforcement. Walz, the failed vice presidential candidate who will not be seeking re-election as governor, said he would exhaust every potential solution to stop the bloodshed except for working with ICE to enforce immigration laws in Minnesota. \"I'm open to any solution but that one,\" Walz told reporters. \"I am here to serve and protect the residents of the great state of Minnesota and...\nBrowse by Forum\nGet Connected!
