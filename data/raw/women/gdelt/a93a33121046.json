I’ll come for free, don’t worry. It won’t be a financial issue. But I’ll be the president. And I’ll be the one to sign you as sporting director.”\nAitana then went on to speak about her ambitions and a potential future in some type of club management.\n”I’m excited to be able to create the structure myself, to decide who does and who doesn’t, to be the leader of the process. Who knows if I’ll end up as a coach, I close no doors,” she added.\n“There is still progress to be made in football in the sense that there are few women in important positions.”",
