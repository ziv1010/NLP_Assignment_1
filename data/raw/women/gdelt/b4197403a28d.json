Speaking to the Times, Cleta... -\nAttorney General Bailey Obtains Court Win Throwing Out Biden-Harris Illegal Parole in Place Rule\nPress Release 9 Attorney General Bailey Obtains Court Win Throwing Out Biden-Harris Illegal Parole in Place Rule JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. – Today, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey obtained a court order throwing out the Biden-Harris Administration’s “parole in place” (PIP) rule that would allow millions of illegal immigrants to circumvent the law and obtain permanent residency.

Sorry about that,\" said Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi. \"It's a real shame he already served two terms.

Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.), one of the staunchest Israel supporters in Congress, criticized liberal writer Peter Beinart’s New York Times op-ed “Democrats ignored Gaza and brought down their party.” “Peter Beinart has an op-ed claiming that outrage among young black Americans against Israel is one of the causes of Democratic defeat in the 2024 election,” Torres wrote. “Beware of white progressives, who project their own ideological biases onto working-class communities of color.” “Here’s the ground-level truth. If you’re a young man of color struggling to pay your rent, put food on the table and keep your family afloat, the furthest... -\nOxford University student killed himself after becoming victim of ‘pervasive cancel culture’\nAn Oxford University student killed himself after becoming a victim of “pervasive cancel culture” over an unproven allegation made by his ex, a UK court has heard.

She also stated that people might not have expected Biden to run for re-election at first since he ran to be a transition figure. Guthrie said, “Well, it’s also interesting, too, because Biden ran kind of — first of all, as a... -\nWhere's Carville?\nWhere's ol' Serpant Head with his prediction og a Kamala landslide.

Why it matters: The House emerged early Wednesday morning as Democrats' last hope of denying President-elect Trump full control of Congress.
