  "body_text": "QUITO, Ecuador – The stage is set for a dramatic showdown, as Colombia faces defending champions Brazil in the 2025 Copa América Femenina final on Saturday, Aug. 2, at the Rodrigo Paz Delgado Stadium in Quito, Ecuador. The match kicks off at 5 p.m. Eastern and will be broadcast on FS1.\nSeveral streaming services will broadcast Saturday’s match live, and you can watch DIRECTV (free trial), as well as on FuboTV (promotional offer) and Sling (promotional offers).\nBrazil has won eight of the nine Copa America Femenina tournaments, including the most recent one in 2022 when it defeated Colombia in the final, 1-0, on Colombian soil. This will also be just the fourth championship match in the history of the tournament with the other five being decided by two rounds of group play and the winner clinching an automatic spot in the FIFA Women’s World Cup.\nColombia needed a penalty shootout to defeat Argentina in the semifinals on Monday. They secured the win in the shootout, 5-4, when Eliana Stábile of Argentina, who needed to score to extend the shootout, struck the post.\nBrazil had no issues in its semifinal match on Tuesday when it routed Uruguay, 5-1. Four different players scored for Brazil, including Amanda Gutierres’ two goals.\nThe tournament has not been without controversy. Brazilian players, including Marta, recently criticized CONMEBOL and tournament organizers for requiring teams to warm up in confined indoor areas rather than on the pitch. Following this criticism, CONMEBOL announced adjustments to pre-match procedures, allowing players to warm up on the pitch.\nA look at Colombia\nColombia has been the runner-up of Copa America Fememina three times since joining the competition in 1998, coming in second to Brazil all three times. The 1-0 loss in 2022 was the only time the two teams played in a final, with Brazil’s championships in 2010 and 2014 coming in a final stage round robin.\nColombia was the only team in the group stage that Brazil failed to beat when it held the fellow South American squad to a 0-0 draw on July 25.\nThe two teams shared the same totals for goals scored (12), goals allowed (1) and goal differential (plus-11) in the group stage.\nIn addition to its 0-0 draw vs. Brazil, Colombia earned victories of 8-0 vs. Bolivia and 4-1 vs. Paraguay along with a 0-0 tie vs. Venezuela to earn a spot in the knockout stage.\nColombia players to watch\nLinda Caicedo, who plays club football for Real Madrid, has 3 goals in five appearances to lead Colombia in scoring.\nMayra Ramírez has been equally influential with three assists, tied with Marta of Brazil for the most in the tournament. Ramirez, who plays for Chelsea in England, also has two goals along with Daniela Montoya.\nKatherine Tapia has been Colombia’s goalkeeper for all five matches of the tournament, and she has kept four clean sheets. She has made 14 saves during Copa America Femenina.\nA look at Brazil\nThe eight-time Copa America Femenina champions are well poised to bring home championship No. 9 on Saturday. Despite finishing behind Argentina (12) in terms of overall points in the group stage with 10, Brazil’s 0-0 draw vs. Colombia on July 25 has been the only blemish they have had in this tournament.\nThey opened their tournament with a 2-0 win vs. Venezuela, and then added victories of 6-0 vs. Bolivia and 4-1 vs. Paraguay.\nAs a team, they have scored 17 goals in the tournament, five more than Colombia.\nBrazil and Colombia met three times in 2024, with Brazil winning twice and drawing with them in the other match.\nBrazil players to watch\nAmanda Gutierres is the leading scorer in the tournament with five goals in four matches. Two of her goals came in the semifinal win vs. Uruguay on Tuesday, and she has scored in every match she has appeared in during the tournament.\nKerolin is second on the team in scoring in this tournament with three, followed by Luany, Duda Sampaio and Yasmim all tied for third with two each.\nThe legendary Marta, who plays for Orlando Pride in the NWSL, has three assists in the tournament and also scored vs. Uruguay.\nWatch Colombia vs. Brazil for free on DIRECTV\nWho is announcing Colombia vs. Brazil?\nJohn Strong (play-by-play) and Lori Lindsey (analyst) will call the match on FS1.\nWhat are the latest odds for Colombia vs. Brazil?\nSpread: COL (+0.5); BRA (-0.5).\nMoneyline: COL (+340); BRA (-150).\nCheck out more information on how to watch the Copa America Femenina final between Colombia vs. Brazil today on TV and streaming services:\nWhat: Colombia vs. Brazil: Copa America Femenina final\nWhen: Saturday, Aug. 2, 2025\nTime: 5 p.m. Eastern\nWhere: Rodrigo Paz Delgado Stadium | Quito, Ecuador\nChannel: FS1\nBest streaming options: DIRECTV (free trial), Fubo (promotional offers) and Sling (promotional offers).\nMore sports, gear, and tickets\n- Where to watch undefeated Miami (OH) vs. Ohio NCAA FREE STREAM today\n- How to watch the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game 2026 FREE live stream today\n- How to watch Ohio State vs. Penn State Big Ten wrestling for free today\n- 2026 Winter Olympics men figure skating: How to watch Ilia Malinin in free skate final live for free today\n- How to watch USA vs. Latvia men’s hockey for free on DIRECTV, Peacock if you’re blacked out on Fubo",
