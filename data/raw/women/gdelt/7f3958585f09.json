  "body_text": "Athletic Director Confident Wyoming is ‘Catching Up’ in NIL Game\nLARAMIE -- When it comes to the controversial subject of Name, Image and Likeness in college sports, Tom Burman will be the first to tell you Wyoming has been playing catch up.\nThat doesn't mean a solution isn't on the horizon.\n\"We need to grow it quickly,\" the school's longtime athletics director admitted on Saturday night.\nA report by the Cowboy State Daily earlier in the day stated the department is only allocating $1.4 million annually in NIL funds, $800,000 less per year than regional programs Montana and Montana State, which compete in the FCS.\nWhile the latter dollar amount could not be substantiated, Burman said the initial figure for UW is now at $1.5 million, adding that number only illustrates the revenue sharing monies between the school's two largest income generating programs, football and men's basketball. An additional $200,000 is being divvied up between women's basketball, volleyball and wrestling, he added.\n\"This does not include any third-party NIL dollars or Learfield NIL partnerships, which are likely another $500,000 total,\" he continued. \"This also does not include Alston Scholarship dollars, which is $1.1 million, and are included as revenue sharing as part of the House Settlement analysis.\"\nThere are other future plans in place to bring in additional revenue, Burman said. including jersey patches, field and court logos and venue naming opportunities.\nUNLV, one of the Cowboys' current Mountain West foes, recently announced a 5-year, $11 million deal to promote a local Las Vegas company on its uniforms in football, men's and women's basketball and baseball. That is expected to be approved in August.\nBurman said this will happen at UW, but added, \"We're not going to give it away.\"\nThe same can be said for a permanent field sponsor inside War Memorial Stadium.\nRamos Law, a firm based out of Colorado, purchased that space for the Cowboys' home finale last month against Nevada -- the \"Josh Allen game\" -- for a reported $90,000-plus. The company logo was placed at both 25 yards lines.\nMORE UW FOOTBALL NEWS VIA 7220SPORTS:\n* Burman, UW Athletics Seeking Additional Revenue Streams\n* Recruiting, Portal Misses Have Lasting Impact in Laramie\n* Injured Wyoming Running Back Says He's Entering Portal\n* Wyoming Inks 20 Freshmen in 2026 Recruiting Class\n* Wyoming in the Market for New Offensive Coordinator\n* PODCAST: Offseason 'Rework' Underway in Laramie\n* Running Back Terron Kellman Again Looking for New Home\n* Wyoming's Leading Receiver Entering NCAA Transfer Portal\nThere are other potential avenues that could help Wyoming gain ground on the competition.\n\"If we get support from the state -- and not a budget cut, also -- and continued investment from the private sector, coupled with support from campus, we will be in a good place in short order,\" Burman said.\nThe department earlier this month asked the joint appropriations committee of the Wyoming Legislature for an additional $3 million on top of the annual $11.2 it receives annually through the school's block grant. The state will also match up to $5 million a year in private donations.\nThe grand total is just over $19 million.\nThough the $3 million, annually, wouldn’t go directly to NIL and revenue sharing, Burman said, it will help UW to handle other escalating costs that have occurred due to inflation and additional costs related to the NCAA House settlement and Mountain West membership changes.\nThe university is now on the hook for reimbursements to former student-athletes. That number totals $2.8 billion in damages. Over the next 10 years, Burman added, Wyoming will lose funding to the tune of $550,000, annually.\nThe current media rights deal with the conference, which currently brings in $3.7 million a year, is also likely to take a hit.\nSan Diego State, Fresno State, Utah State, Boise State and the Cowboys' Border War rival, Colorado State, are departing in July for the new-look Pac-12. The league is adding UTEP and Northern Illinois, the latter in football only. UC Davis and Grand Canyon have joined on the basketball side. Hawaii is also now a full member.\nThe department, though, could soon see an influx of cash once the legal battle between the Mountain West and Pac-12 is finalized. Poaching fees and exit fees are at the heart of the litigation. The next hearing in that case is set for Sept. 9.\nDonations to the Cowboy Joe Club, the department's lead fundraising arm, will also open up additional opportunities to retain and lure future student-athletes, Burman added.\n\"We are starting to see people donate,\" he said. \"That frees up money for revenue sharing through ticket sales, media rights, corporate dollars, television, etc.\n\"We are just getting started.\"\nUniversity of Wyoming’s Top 50 Football Players\nGallery Credit: 7220Sports.com\n- University of Wyoming’s Top 50 Football Players",
