  "body_text": "Razorback Great Scanlon selected for 2023 Southwest Conference Hall of Fame Class\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. – Former Razorback quarterback Kevin Scanlon will be among nine honorees inducted into the Southwest Conference Hall of Fame on Wednesday, October 11, 2023 in a luncheon at the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in Waco, Texas.\nHosted by the Texas Sports Hall of Fame (TSHOF), the home to the Southwest Conference Hall of Fame, the event will honor Scanlon as well as other legends from schools previously affiliated with the Southwest Conference.\n“Kevin Scanlon is a Razorback football legend and will soon be a distinguished member of the Southwest Conference Hall of Fame,” University of Arkansas Vice Chancellor and Director of Athletics Hunter Yurachek said. “Kevin helped lead the Hogs to a Southwest Conference championship in 1979 and along the way was recognized as the conference player of the year.\n“Afforded the opportunity to meet him later in his professional life, it is easy for me to identify the leadership skills that has led to Kevin’s tremendous success both on and off the field. Whether it is in his role with Stephens, Inc. or as the chair of the Razorback Foundation Board, Kevin is always serving others while also being an advocate for the Razorbacks and our state. We look forward to celebrating with Kevin and his family in October as he is honored as one of the best to ever compete in the Southwest Conference.”\nScanlon played for the Razorbacks for just two years (1978-79), but during that time made an indelible mark on the Arkansas program. Named the starting quarterback prior to the 1979 season, he earned Southwest Conference Player of the Year honors after he completed 92-of-139 passes for 1,212 yards and nine touchdowns.\nIn 1979, the Razorbacks finished eighth nationally with a record of 10-2 including a 17-14 win over No. 2 Texas. Scanlon helped Arkansas claim a share of the Southwest Conference championship before leading the Razorbacks to the 1980 Sugar Bowl where they faced eventual national champion Alabama. His 66.2 completion percentage in 1979 set a then single-season school record as did his school record at the time for most passes completed in a bowl game (22) which he recorded against the Crimson Tide.\nOriginally a transfer to the Razorbacks from North Carolina State, Scanlon was drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in 1980 following his Razorback career. Kevin was inducted into the University of Arkansas Sports Hall of Honor in 2010. He was inducted into the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame in 2018.\nIn addition to Scanlon, the 2023 class includes Baylor basketball great Terry Teagle, University of Houston women’s track and field star Jolanda Jones, Rice track and field standout Ken Stadel, SMU women’s golfer Amy Benz, University of Texas swimming great Shaun Jordan, Texas A&M football star Terry Price, TCU football and track and field standout Bubba Thornton and Texas Tech baseball great Gary Ashby.\nThe Southwest Conference Hall of Fame is one of four separate halls of fame housed within the Texas Sports Hall of Fame’s physical structure. They include the Texas High School Football Hall of Fame, the Texas Tennis Hall of Fame, the Texas Sports Hall of Fame and now, the Southwest Conference Hall of Fame.\nIndividual tickets start at $75 and tables of eight at $600.
