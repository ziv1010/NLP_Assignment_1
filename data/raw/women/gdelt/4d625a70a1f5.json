I've known him for a very long time. He is a generous person with an extraordinary attitude to life.'\nThe friend added:' He loved life, his friends and his family. He lived his life 200 per cent.

David was very generous. Lowkey he never came forward and yet he could have.\n'The mountains of his region, which he knew by heart and cherished so much, took him away.\n'Last Sunday, he was still explaining how he was looking forward to travelling the world after passing his Bar degree with flying colours.\n'From tonight on, he'll be watching this world from up there. Today I am at a loss for words to express the sorrow of this loss.\n'David, your light will shine in our hearts forever.

Pictured is the vigil last night in Vex\nBy the time a rescue team finally reached the mountain on Sunday evening, five of the six alpine enthusiasts had perished close to the Dent Blanche alpine cabin\nThe group of six skiers, who ranged in age from 21 to 58, had left Zermatt Saturday morning with the goal of reaching the town of Arolla, near the Matterhorn mountain, later that day.\nBut as the group passed close to the Tete Blanche, a mountain peak between Zermatt and Arolla, the region was engulfed in a brutal storm that left the skiers stranded at an altitude of around 11,400ft (3,500 metres).\nA member of the group sent a distress call to emergency services around 5pm on Saturday afternoon, authorities said, but helicopters and rescue teams were unable to deploy, such was the ferocity of the storm.\nBy the time a rescue team finally reached the mountain on Sunday evening, five of the six alpine enthusiasts had perished close to the Dent Blanche alpine cabin.\nRescuers are continuing a desperate search for a sixth missing person.\nAnjan Truffer, head of rescue at Air Zermatt who conducted the rescue operation, told Swiss media: 'The picture we found was ugly... We saw that the ski tourers had tried to build a cave and protect themselves from the wind.'\n'The ski tourers froze to death at altitude, disorientated,' he said, adding their bodies were found scattered around the site, suggesting they had panicked before losing consciousness.\nFive cross-country skiers who went missing during a ski tour in Switzerland were found dead in the night, while a search was still on for the sixth skier.

File image\nGeneral public Prosecutor of the canton of Valais Beatrice Pilloud (L) and Commandant of the Valais Cantonal Police Christian Varone (R) arrive at press conference following the discovery of five dead ski tourers\nAttorney General of the Canton of Valais Beatrice Pilloud, head of the Police of the Canton of Valais Christian Varone and director of the Cantonal Valais Rescue Organisation Fredy-Michel Roten attend a press conference by the police in Sion, Switzerland, yesterday\nChristian Varone, head of Valais cantonal police, told reporters that rescue workers had pulled out all the stops to try to reach the stranded skiers but faced horrendous conditions.\n'We were trying the impossible,' he said, adding that the mission had pushed its efforts 'to the extreme, extreme limit', but were forced to turn around to avoid 'seriously endangering the lives of the rescue workers'.\n'Sometimes you have to bow before nature.'\nTruffer confirmed that emergency services received a distress signal from one of the skiers at around 5:19pm local time on Saturday.\nThis, he said, gave rescuers a rough location in the Col de Tete Blanche, whose peak stands at 12,160ft above sea level.\nMr Truffer told Swiss outlet Blick that the weather was so bad that flying in to rescue the skiers simply wasn't an option.\nHe said there were 'very strong winds, heavy snow, high avalanche danger, and zero visibility' which would leave rescuers 'dead in two minutes'.\nHe added that when the group left Zermatt, the bad weather conditions were already known and he believes that the skiers were caught in the storm rather than struck by an avalanche.\nWith helicopters unable to brave the storm, five rescuers had tried to reach the rough location on foot from Zermatt, but they too were forced to turn back at an altitude of 9,840ft due to the bad weather, according to local media reports.\nOn Sunday, a team consisting of two rescue workers, a doctor and a mountain police officer, was finally able to be dropped off by helicopter nearby, police said.\n'At around 9:20 pm, it reached the Tete Blanche sector, where it discovered the bodies of five of the six people who were missing,' it said in a statement.\nThe search is continuing for the last member of the group.\n'As long as there is hope we will keep going... while remaining realistic in view of the conditions this person has been in for the past 48 hours,' Varone said.\nFredy-Michel Roten from the Valais Rescue Organisation told local press that six private rescue helicopters and two Swiss army Super Puma choppers are participating in the rescue mission along with dozens of specialist mountaineers.\nThe group of skiers, who ranged in age from 21 to 58, had left Zermatt Saturday morning with the goal of reaching the town of Arolla later that day.

File image\nRescue authorities announced a search in difficult weather conditions Sunday for six skiers missing. The group set off Saturday on a route between the resort town of Zermatt\nPolice have yet to reveal the identities of those involved, only saying that the five family members were from Valais canton and the sixth person from the canton of Fribourg.\nValais lead prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud told reporters that an investigation had been launched to determine the circumstances surrounding the incident.\nZermatt is a popular mountain resort renowned for skiing and attracts tourists from around the world.\nTete Blanche in particular is very popular with ski tourers who are attracted by the region's renowned landscape and the challenging terrain it offers.\nThe region hosts the esteemed Patrouille des Glaciers race, which sees ski tourers traverse a route from Zermatt through Arolla and on to Verbier.\nBut the area is notoriously difficult to navigate during periods of poor visibility, and has proven fatal for even highly experienced skiers and mountaineers.\nNearly five years ago, tragedy struck when 14 members from two ski touring parties became disoriented amidst a fierce storm on treacherous slopes.\nThe ensuing rescue operation endured for almost 21 gruelling hours before reaching the stranded groups.\nSeven people died, while the rest were evacuated with varying degrees of injury.\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying",
