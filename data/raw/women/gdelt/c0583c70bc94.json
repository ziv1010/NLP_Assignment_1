Here we are in February, getting ever so closer to the season starting, and the winds of change here at The Mane Land are blowing. With new teams in town and preseasons underway, things are finally happening. I hope you enjoyed the weekend, because there will be more soccer as the week begins. Let’s get to the links.\nThe Pride Get Up to Speed\nThe Orlando Pride preseason is well underway and Head Coach Seb Hines has his players running — a lot. Hines wants to ensure that his players will have the cardio necessary to outlast opponents in the hot Florida weather. If you are familiar with the beep test, you’ll know that they are not messing around with the conditioning. The team did some drills with the ball as well. Getting the players at the right fitness level is important with a long NWSL season ahead of the Pride.\nToni Pressley’s Memorable Moments in Orlando\nDefender Toni Pressley won’t be playing for the Pride this season and the club took a trip down memory lane with a look at her time with the team. The last player from the team’s inaugural season in 2016, Pressley has spent the past seven seasons with the Pride. Most of her contributions over the years have been on the defensive side of the ball, making important tackles and blocks to deny her opponents. While her curling strike against Kansas City in 2017 is worth watching over and over again, her most memorable moment with the Pride was her return to the field after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2019.\nCrusaders Kick Off Their Season\nThe Central Florida Crusaders kicked off their inaugural National Indoor Soccer League season on Sunday. In the women’s match, Yvonne Hayes scored the first goal in Crusaders history to give her team the lead over the Memphis Americans. However, the Crusaders conceded three goals in the third quarter and fell 9-6 to the defending champs. Before the game, the Pride’s Marta and Carrie Lawrence were there for the first kick.\nThe Orlando Pride’s Marta and Carrie Lawrence in attendance for the ceremonial first kick. @CrusadersNISL pic.twitter.com/HL6JrPT1Uk\n— Mike Gramajo (@byMikeGramajo) February 5, 2023\nThe men’s side mounted a comeback and defeated Memphis 9-8 thanks to a golden goal from Raphael Tobias in overtime. Tobias had three goals and two assists, with Maycon Franca also scoring a hat trick.\nGOLDEN GOAL WINNER IN OVERTIME!\nCRUSADERS WIN!#CFLCrusaders ⚔️ pic.twitter.com/OsAdzpyyM7\n— Central Florida Crusaders (@CrusadersNISL) February 5, 2023\nKeeping Up With Americans Abroad\nI’m not certain if he is simply trying to prove something following the World Cup, but Giovanni Reyna can’t seem to stop scoring when he comes on as a substitute for Borussia Dortmund. His latest goal came in Dortmund’s 5-1 win over SC Freiburg. He’s scored in his past three league appearances and Dortmund is now third in the Bundesliga.\nGIO REYNA OFF THE BENCH AGAIN 😱 pic.twitter.com/YXQRa785M4\n— ESPN FC (@ESPNFC) February 4, 2023\nIn less good news, Alejandro Zendejas was carted off in Club America’s 2-2 draw with Santos Laguna due to an apparent hamstring injury. The USMNT forward has had a good run of form with Club America, but that will now be put on hold.\nWeston McKennie made his English Premier League debut for Leeds United, coming off the bench in a losing effort to Nottingham Forest. Keylor Navas also made his Premier League debut, making big saves for Nottingham in the 1-0 victory. The 36-year-old kept a clean sheet and was recognized for his efforts.\nA clean sheet and three points on his debut! 🙌\nKeylor Navas is your #NFFC Player of the Match! ✨ pic.twitter.com/KteKJ6TZFy\n— Nottingham Forest FC (@NFFC) February 5, 2023\nResults Across the English Premier League\nManchester United was able to hold on for a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace. Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford scored for Manchester United, but Casemiro received a red card in the 70th minute. Palace drew one back on a 76th minute goal from Jeffrey Schlupp, but was unable to close the gap.\nIn what had to be the strangest result of the weekend, Everton defeated Arsenal 1-0. James Tarkowski scored the lone goal of the game in the second half and Everton held on for the win. The Toffees may have gotten a new manager boost as it was the team’s first match under Sean Dyche.\nFinally, Harry Kane scored his 200th Premier League goal in Tottenham Hotspur’s 1-0 win over Manchester City. The goal was also his 267th for Tottenham, taking him past club legend Jimmy Greaves.\n𝐇𝐈𝐒𝐓𝐎𝐑𝐘 𝐌𝐀𝐃𝐄 👏\nTHE MOMENT HARRY KANE SCORED HIS 200TH #PL GOAL 🏴\n(Via @NBCSportsSoccer) pic.twitter.com/zpsUmAJSzd\n— FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) February 5, 2023\nFree Kicks\n- Former Lion Cyle Larin scored another game-winning goal for Valladolid in La Liga. The Canadian came off the bench and scored the game’s only goal to beat Real Sociedad 1-0.\nCyle Larin 🇨🇦 scores once again off the bench! #CanMNTpic.twitter.com/GuOWg9Sb52\n— Giuseppe Campanelli (@giuseppecam22) February 5, 2023\n- In case you missed it, the Seattle Sounders fell 1-0 to Egyptian club Al Ahly in the Club World Cup. Al Ahly will take on Real Madrid on Wednesday in the semifinals.\n- According to OL Reign Head Coach Laura Harvey, USWNT forward Megan Rapinoe is training without any restrictions following her recovery from an ankle injury. That means she will make the SheBelieves Cup later this month, with the U.S. taking on Canada at Exploria Stadium on Feb. 16.\n- Manchester City is reportedly interested in the USMNT’s Antonee Robinson, but Fulham’s price tag for the left back may be too high for the Sky Blues.\nHave a great week. Vamos Orlando!\nLion Links\nLion Links: 2/13/26\nHannah Anderson challenging herself in Orlando, Luana called up by Brazil, broadcasting changes ahead of MLS season, and more.\nToday is Friday the 13th, so make sure to steer clear of black cats, ladders, and any other bad omens out there. Orlando City’s season opener is next weekend and the last thing we need to do is accumulate bad luck before the Lions take the field. Let’s keep our fingers crossed and dive into today’s links!\nHannah Anderson Prepares for First Season in Orlando\nDefender Hannah Anderson was drafted by the Chicago Stars in the third round of the 2024 NWSL Draft and spent two seasons there before the Pride traded for her in January for $70,000 in intraleague funds. Chicago conceded twice as many goals as Orlando last season, and now Anderson is challenging herself with an opportunity to improve as a defender with the Pride.\n“I don’t really look at it as pressure, I think it’s an opportunity,” she said. “The challenge is what’s going to help me grow. When you’re never challenged, you can’t grow. It’s kind of like how you see that challenge. Yeah, it could be pressure, but I also think it’s exciting to be a part of a group that’s been there, because the experience will help you get there again.”\nThe 24-year-old also spoke on what it’s like to go up against Orlando’s attacking stars in training, as well as her decision to join the Pride while engaged to Chicago Cubs pitcher Jack Neely. With Emily Sams on the other side of the country, hopefully Anderson can have a breakout year to help fill the void.\nLuana Returns to Brazil National Team\nOrlando Pride midfielder Luana was called up for Brazil’s friendlies against Costa Rica, Venezuela, and Mexico in a few weeks. It’s great to see her back with the national team after all she’s been through and Head Coach Arthur Elias spoke on her return.\n“Calling up Luana is a joy, but the greater joy was when she overcame cancer, a disease diagnosed during a period with the National Team. It was a huge shock for all of us. Luana has an incredible history in football, she is a woman of great strength, who showed this and set many examples for those around her,” he celebrated.\nShe will bring some experience to a Brazil roster that doesn’t include any other Pride players, although former Pride player Adriana was called up. Brazil has already secured qualification for the 2027 Women’s World Cup as its host, so the focus will be on playing quality opponents until then.\nGetting Ready for More MLS on Apple TV\nWe’re gearing up for the fourth MLS season streamed through Apple TV and the biggest difference this time around is that MLS Season Pass is a thing of the past. It’s a major boon for fans, as all games will be through an Apple TV subscription rather than a separate platform at an additional cost. For those of us who like to watch MLS games at our favorite bar, an agreement with EverPass Media should increase the reach of the league in commercial venues. Saturday night matches with increased production value, announcers returning to the actual stadiums to call games, and the removal of the Spanish version of MLS 360 are some of the other notable changes heading into this season.\nNottingham Forest Fires Manager…Again\nJust a day after Thomas Franks was fired by Tottenham, Nottingham Forest sacked Sean Dyche following the club’s scoreless draw with Wolverhampton this week. Dyche joined the club in October and was just nominated for Manager of the Month for his team’s results in January. However, Forest is just three points above the relegation zone and has now fired its third coach of the season. Vitor Pereira will reportedly replace Dyche as the club’s fourth coach of the season, which would be a league record. ESPN dove into how English Premier League teams that made multiple firings in the same season performed and it’s grim news for Forest.\nFree Kicks\n- Orlando City goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau went under the microscope to field a variety of questions. I’m pretty interested in why Duncan McGuire would be the first person he’d call if he found a dead body in his hotel room.\n- Construction is underway at Camping World Stadium as it begins its $400 million renovation to expand seating and improve the facilities.\n- Atletico Madrid put Barcelona to the sword in the first leg of their Copa del Rey semifinal, winning 4-0 thanks to four goals in the first half.\n- Raheem Sterling has joined Feyenoord as a free agent after a mutual agreement with Chelsea to terminate his contract last season.\n- The draw for the UEFA Nations League was completed and Spain was drawn into a group with England, Croatia, and the Czech Republic.\nThat’s all I have for you on this fine Friday. I hope you all have a lucky day and that all of your Valentine’s Day plans this weekend go off without a hitch!\nLion Links\nLion Links: 2/12/26\nOrlando City wins preseason game, Nolan Miller readies for rookie season, Hailie Mace settling in with the Orlando Pride, and more.\nHow’s it going, Mane Landers? It’s been a pretty hectic for me so far this week, but it’s nothing some ABBA and baking can’t help with. The return of Orlando soccer is right around the corner and I’m looking forward to seeing our favorite players back in action. Until then though, let’s enjoy today’s links from around the soccer world!\nOrlando City Wins Preseason Game\nAlthough Orlando City continues to keep most of the details of its preseason results close to the chest, we at least know that the Lions beat FC Cincinnati 3-2 in Tampa. Cincy got the scoring started with a goal from Evander, but Orlando came out swinging in the second half by scoring three goals in just five minutes. Martin Ojeda bagged a brace, with 20-year-old winger Tiago maintaining his solid preseason form with a goal as well. It’s a nice result and the Lions will play their final preseason game Saturday against the Colorado Rapids in a match open to season ticket members.\nNolan Miller Ready for Rookie Season\nDrafted by the Lions with the ninth overall pick in the 2026 MLS SuperDraft, Nolan Miller spoke on how he fit the profile Orlando’s coaching staff was looking for in a center back in the draft. The 21-year-old can play out of the back and possesses leadership qualities as evidenced by deciding to stay at Michigan to help build the program into a Big Ten championship contender as its captain. Signed to a first-team contract earlier this month, Miller discussed how he’s mentally prepared for his rookie season in the MLS.\n“I’ll tell you this, I’m the biggest guy in my mindset,” he said. “If you start thinking, ‘Wow, this is a big jump,’ it will be a big jump. But I tell myself I belong every day. I belong at this level. I know I belong. I’m mentally there, I’m physically there, and if I’m not there today, I’m going to be there tomorrow.”\nHailie Mace Finding Her Footing in Orlando\nOrlando Pride defender Hailie Mace is the most notable addition to the Pride’s roster this off-season and she spoke on how she’s settling in with Orlando after a terrific season with the Kansas City Current. Like the Current, the Pride have boasted one of the league’s best defenses in recent years, and Mace fits the team’s defensive mindset. That being said, Head Coach Seb Hines could have her making more of an impact on offense in the City Beautiful.\n“Seb wants me to join the attack more and play through the lines and those sort of things,” she said. “So I think he’s challenging me in that aspect. I would have liked to be more involved in the attack last year, but that wasn’t my role on the team. Coming here, having the freedom to join the attack and Seb encouraging me to do it, it’s nice and fun, and I’m excited to be able to do that.”\nShe also talked about how going up against attackers like Marta and Barbra Banda in training will only make her a better player. It’s hardly the first time Mace is adapting to a new team environment in her career, so hopefully she can be a difference maker for the Pride this season.\nNWSL Star Midfielders On the Move\nIt seems we’re still in the NWSL’s silly season, as the Current made a pair of major trades. American attacking midfielder Croix Bethune is no longer with the Washington Spirit after being traded to the Current in exchange for $900,000 in intra-league transfer funds and $100,000 in Allocation Money. Bethune requested the move according to Spirit President of Soccer Operations Haley Carter and gives the Current a young and talented playmaker.\nThat’s not all though. The Current also traded defensive midfielder Claire Hutton to Bay FC in exchange for $1.1 million in intra-league transfer funds. The 20-year-old was a finalist for NWSL Rookie of the Year in 2024 and started 22 games for the Current last season, making the NWSL Best XI First Team.\nFree Kicks\n- Gustavo Caraballo scored a great goal in Orlando City B’s scrimmage against the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n- Orlando City’s latest jersey placed 16th in CBS Sports’ rankings of the new MLS jerseys for the upcoming season. It’s nice to not be at the bottom of the list, where basic kits from Inter Miami and Nashville SC are joined by messy tries by St. Louis City and the Houston Dynamo.\n- A big change is coming to the SheBelieves Cup, as any matches that end in a draw will now go to a penalty shootout for an additional point. There will also be new rules regarding rosters, with teams now able to field 26-player rosters for the tournament.\n- U.S. soccer legend Abby Wambach announced that she is leaving Casey Wasserman’s talent agency and called for him to resign following the reveal of correspondence between him and Ghislaine Maxwell in the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n- Lionel Messi did not participate in training due to a muscle strain in his hamstring. The club’s friendly against Puerto Rico was postponed to Feb. 26, which is just a few days before its match against Orlando City on March 1.\n- Tottenham sacked Thomas Frank amid a disastrous season that has the club just five points above the relegation zone.\nThat’s all I have for you all this around. I hope you all have a wonderful Thursday and rest of your week!\nLion Links\nLion Links: 2/11/26\nNew Orlando City kit drops, Orlando City and Orlando Pride preseasons, MLS club valuations, and more.\nWelcome to Wednesday, Mane Landers. I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling a bit anxious about the upcoming season. I think it’s because we don’t know much of what is going on. We’re only a few weeks away from the first match for goodness sake. Hopefully, we’ll see some more signings for both clubs, but until then let’s get to the links.\nOrlando City’s New Kit\nOrlando City dropped the new Sunken Treasure secondary kit yesterday, and it is a stunner. This is the first time the club has used gold as the primary color on a jersey. It looks great with the purple shorts, and the purple stripes. There are some great details like the coin on the collar and sublimated lion head on the chest. This is truly one of the better kits that Orlando City has introduced. The club produced a great reveal video. Check it out.\nOrlando Preseasons\nThere’s not a ton of information to convey regarding Orlando City’s and the Orlando Pride’s preseasons. That seems to be purposeful on the part of the club, but a little news did slip out via social media. New center back Iago is fully participating in practice.\nWe also learned that goalkeeper Maxime Crépeau is back in training after missing last week. Of course, the Pride got in the action as well with various players trying to run drills. I’ll let you judge how well they did.\nMLS Club Valuations\nMLS clubs are increasing in value, including Orlando City. Sportico released the list of all MLS club valuations (paywall). Unsurprisingly, the top five were all big market teams with Inter Miami leading the way. When the Wilf family purchased Orlando City, they paid between $400 and $450 million. Now it is estimated to be worth approximately $565 million. That’s pretty good growth.\nChris Mueller’s Lost Year\nWe missed this last November, but former Orlando City attacker Chris Mueller had a tough time of things in 2025. The player was diagnosed with pericarditis. It meant that he couldn’t sleep laying down, let alone play or practice. He is now on the other side of it and has a new contract. It was a year of lessons for Mueller, and in typical fashion he has bounced back stronger.\nFree Kicks\n- The Lions weren’t the only team to announce new jerseys. There were 16 other clubs that did the same, though none are as nice as Orlando City’s new kit.\n- The USMNT U-17 squad has secured a spot in the U-17 World Cup. The berth came after a 1-1 draw against the Dominican Republic.\n- Former England, Chelsea, and Juventus forward Eni Aluko has reignited her debate over female pundits in soccer.\n- Defender Noahkai Banks will not be switching from the USMNT to Germany despite contact from the German federation.\nThat will do it for today, me hearties. I hope you have a wonderful day.
