This forced about\n1.5\nmillion people\nto become homeless, taking refuge in crowded UN schools and ultimately\nsleeping in the streets.\nThe Israeli refusal to allow international\naid caravans to enter Gaza freely led the Palestinian population to be\non the verge of\nmass\nextermination for the lack of food, water, medicine, and fuel.\nBy December 6, 2023,\n290\nhealth personnel were killed and hundreds were injured,\n102\nambulances were destroyed while on duty, killing and injuring their\ncrews, and destroyed\n56\nhealth institutions. As a result of the strikes and lack of fuel,\n26\nhospitals and\n46\nprimary care centers are not functioning.\nBy\nDecember 14, 2023, there were\n286\nPalestinians who were killed,\n3,430+\nwho were injured, and\n4,400\nwho were abducted by Israeli occupation forces in the\nWest\nBank,\nsince October 7, 2023.\nبِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمَـٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ\n\"مِنْ\nأَجْلِ ذَٰلِكَ كَتَبْنَا عَلَىٰ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ أَنَّهُ\nمَنْ قَتَلَ نَفْسًا بِغَيْرِ نَفْسٍ أَوْ فَسَادٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ\nفَكَأَنَّمَا قَتَلَ النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا\" (الْمَائِدَةُ\n، 5: 32).\n\"وَمَنْ يَقْتُلْ مُؤْمِنًا مُّتَعَمِّدًا\nفَجَزَاؤُهُ جَهَنَّمُ خَالِدًا فِيهَا وَغَضِبَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ\nوَلَعَنَهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُ عَذَابًا عَظِيمًا\" (النِّسَاءُ\n، 4: 93).\n\"Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever\nkills a soul, unless for a soul, or for corruption in the land, it is as\nif he had killed humankind entirely\"\n(The Holy Quran, Al-Ma-ida, 5: 32).\n\"And whoever kills a\nbeliever intentionally, his recompense is Hell, wherein he will abide\neternally, and Allah has become angry with him, and has cursed him, and\nhas prepared for him a great torment\"\n(Al-Nisa, 4: 93).\n***\nWhile brutal force has been used to create Zionist Israel and sustain\nit thus far, Zionist claims to Palestine are false. Actually, from the\nfive thousand years of known written human history, there has been a\ncontinuous Palestinian-Canaanite presence in the Holy Land. Despite the\nZionist false claims, the ancient Israelites ruled part of the land for\nonly 85 years (during the reign of Prophets David and Solomon , peace be\nupon them, and Solomon's son).\nAfter that, the Egyptians conquered Palestine-Canaan in 925 BC,\nfollowed by Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, before\nthe Arab Muslim rule, starting from 636 AD.\nBy the Time Jesus, peace be upon him, started his mission, the three population groups of\nCanaanites, Palestinians, and Israelites were melted together in\nreligion and language. Most of them became Christians when Constantine\nconverted in 313 AD. Then, most of them became Muslims in the 7th and\n8th centuries AD.\nSo, Palestinian Muslims, Christians, and Jews are the ones who have\nthe right to claim descent from ancient Israelites, Palestinians, and\nCanaanites, not Zionists from other continents.\nNo matter what the Zionists and their supporters do, they cannot\nchange the will of God, Who promised the Holy Land to Abraham and his\ndescendants, basically the Palestinian Muslims and Christians.\nNo matter how much persecution and aggression the Zionists and their\nsupporters inflict upon the Palestinian people, they will never be able\nto force them out of the Holy Land, which Allah, praise to Him, promised\nfor them, and kept His promise ever since.\nThe following news stories are just examples,\nnot a systematic record,\nof the Israeli occupation government abuse, mistreatment, and violations of Palestinian human\nrights, on daily basis.\nMore detailed news stories can be found at\nthe following sources:\nhttp://english.wafa.ps/, https://english.palinfo.com/,\nhttps://imemc.org/,\nhttps://paltoday.ps/ar/\n***\nEditorial Notes about terms\n& names of\npeople and places:\n1. Names of people and places have been standardized to\nmatch standard Arabic grammatical rules.\n2. Underlined\nletters and letters preceded by an apostrophe are\nreferences to Arabic letter sounds, which does not exist in the English\nalphabet.\n3. The English letter i is\nequivalent to the Arabic short vowel known as kasra,\nas in Ibraheem\nand Qasim\nas well as in the English words sit and bit. So, it is incorrect to use\nit as a long vowel for such Arabic names as Jameel and Jibreel.\n4. The English letter e is\nequivalent to the Arabi short vowel known as fat'ha,\nas in A'hmed\nand Mu'hammed.\n5. It is more accurate to refer to the land-grabbing Israelis, who\nestablish illegal settlements in the Palestinian territory of the West\nBank, as illegal\nIsraeli settlers, than referring to them as colonists.\nThe term colony is\na reference to a large entity or a country, such as American states before\nindependence. It was also a reference to Egypt, and India,\nwhen they were British colonies.\nIn addition, the term \"colony\"\nrepresents a positive\nnostalgic theme, in the minds of native speakers of\nEnglish, particularly in America and Britain.\n6. It is more\naccurate to use the verb \"abduct\"\nthan the verb \"detain,\"\nin reference to taking Palestinian citizens by force to prisons and\ninterrogation centers, by Israeli occupation regime soldiers. This is\nbecause the presence of the Israeli occupation regime forces is illegal\nin the Palestinian territories, and they have no jurisdiction over the\nPalestinian people.\nClick\nhere for more about using the apostrophe and the underlining of letters\nin the transliteration of Arabic names.\n***\n***\nOnly 7,000 Palestinians allowed to perform Friday prayer in Al-Aqsa\nMosque\nFriday 15-December-2023,\nOCCUPIED JERUSALEM, (PIC)--\nA photojournalist was injured on Friday as Israeli forces\nassaulted worshipers who were banned entry to Al-Aqsa Mosque in Occupied\nJerusalem to perform Friday prayer.\nThe Israeli occupation regime police forced worshipers to leave the\nMosque before they headed to Wadi Al-Joaz and Ras Al-'Amoud\nneighborhoods to perform Friday prayer there.\nA Jerusalemite source reported that Israeli occupation forces\nseverely beat photographer Mustafa Al-Kharouf\nin Wadi Al-Joaz, injuring him in the head.\nThe Israeli occupation regime police officers hindered the work of\nPalestinian pressmen, blocked their movement, and prevented them from\napproaching and checking on their colleague, Al-Kharouf,\nafter he was transferred to hospital.\nMeanwhile, only 7,000 worshipers were allowed to perform prayers in\nAl-Aqsa Mosque, as the Israeli occupation regime police banned the entry\nof hundreds of people into the holy site, allowing only residents of the\nOld City of Jerusalem to access the Mosque, according to Islamic\nEndowments in Jerusalem.\nThe Israeli occupation regime police officers also assaulted a number\nof elderly people who attempted to enter the holy site from Al-Asbat\nGate.\nGaza plunges into telecom outage for second day\namid Israel's offensive\nGAZA, Friday, December 15, 2023 (WAFA) –\nFor the second consecutive day, a complete outage of\ntelecommunications and internet services persists in central and\nsouthern Gaza, as well as parts of Gaza City, due to the ongoing Israeli\noffensive.\nLast night, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology\nannounced a total disruption of communication and internet services for\nPalTel and Ooredoo companies in central and southern Gaza. It said the\nongoing Israeli offensive on the enclave was the cause for this\ndisruption.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent Society also reported yesterday that it\nhas completely lost contact with its operations room in the Gaza Strip\nand all its teams working there. This is due to the Israeli occupation\nauthorities cutting off all landline, cellular, and internet networks\nentirely for the fifth time since the beginning of the offensive.\nThe communication blackout is causing serious concerns, as it hampers\nthe ability of residents to access essential services, exacerbates the\nchallenges faced by emergency response teams, and isolates Gaza from the\nrest of the world during a critical time.\nM.N.\nIsrael has killed 85 Palestinian athletes, says\nFootball Association\nRAMALLAH, Thursday, December 14, 2023 (WAFA) -\nThe Palestinian Football Association said that, in the period between\nOctober 7th and December 6th, it documented the killing of 85\nPalestinian athletes, including 55 football players and 30 players in\nother sports.\nThe Association issued a comprehensive report on Thursday in which it\nindicated that the Israeli occupation forces, in their continued\naggression against the northern and southern governorates of the\ncountry, targeted Palestinian athletes and sports facilities, especially\nfootball players, and club presidents, administrators, referees, and\nothers.\nAccording to the report, the slain football players included 18\nchildren and 37 youths, including two in the West Bank, while 4 players\nwere wounded in the Gaza Strip.\nIt explained that the Israeli bombing led to the destruction of nine\nsports facilities, four in the West Bank and five in the Gaza Strip.\nThe report pointed out that the occupation forces detained\nthree athletes in the West Bank, while in the Gaza Strip, the number is\ninfinite in light of the number of missing people there.\nK.T.\n***\n***\nKilling and Injuring of Palestinians in\nGhazza (Gaza)\nby Israeli Occupation Regime Forces\nThe 70th day of the Israeli genocidal war continues on Gaza\nFriday 15-December-2023 (PIC)--\nThe brutal Israeli genocidal war entered its 70th consecutive day\nFriday on the Gaza Strip, by continuing the bloody war, intensifying\naerial bombardment and artillery shelling, and committing massacres,\nincluding field executions and mass arrests, as part of the genocide and\nethnic cleansing operations, amid a catastrophic humanitarian situation.\nMedical sources reported the arrival of 18 martyrs and dozens of\nwounded as a result of Israeli aerial and artillery bombardment in\nvarious areas of Khan Yunis, including 5 martyrs as a result of shelling\ntargeting Haifa School, which shelters displaced people in\nKhan Younus.\nThe Israeli artillery fired flare bombs in\nKhan Younus before dawn, while the savage artillery shelling\ncontinued.\nClashes between the resistance and Israeli occupation forces (IOF)\ntook place in eastern Rafa'h, where aerial and artillery bombardment\ntargeted the area, including the targeting of a house in Tel Al-Sultan\nneighborhood in Rafa'h.\nFour martyrs, including two children, and more than 15 injuries\narrived at Nasir Hospital as a result of an Israeli bombardment of the\nAbu Nasr family’s house in the refugee camp west of\nKhan Younus.\nIsraeli warplanes bombed Al-Sa'di Tower in the Nusayrat\ncamp.\nThe IOF forced the medical staff, patients, and journalists to\nevacuate the Jabalya Martyrs Medical Center.\nIsraeli warplanes bombed a residential area near the Kuwaiti Hospital\nin southern Rafa'h, resulting in dozens of martyrs and injured, who were\ntransferred to the Martyr Abu Yousuf Al-Najjar Hospital in the city.\nIsraeli warplanes also bombed residential neighborhoods and houses in\nDair El-Bala'h, Gaza, Nusayrat, and Jabalya, resulting in a number of\ninjuries.\nCommunication and internet services have been cut off for the second\nconsecutive day.\nThe number of martyrs due to the ongoing Israeli aggression on the\nGaza Strip since October 7th has risen to\n18,787 martyrs and about\n50,900 injured, in a\nprovisional toll.\nDeath toll across Palestine surges to 18,897, over 55,000\nwounded\nRAMALLAH, Friday, December 15, 2023 (WAFA) –\nIn the wake of the devastating Israeli aggression against the\nPalestinian people in the Gaza Strip\nand the West Bank, the death toll has surged to at least\n18,897, with over\n55,000 individuals\nwounded, the Ministry\nof Health said in an update this evening.\nThe Ministry said in a press statement that the documented number of\ncasualties in the Gaza Strip has reached\n18,700, while the death toll in the West Bank\nalso surged to 286.\nIn addition, the ministry said,\n51,000 Palestinians have been\ninjured in Gaza, and nearly\n3,430 others in the\nWest Bank.\nThe ministry explained that the health sector in Gaza is facing a\nsevere crisis, as dozens of healthcare centers have ceased operations\ndue to continuous bombardment and fuel shortages.\nThe Ministry of Health reported that over 60% of homes in Gaza have\nbeen destroyed, including more than 56,000 units completely destroyed\nand 224,000 units partially destroyed.

Between the afternoons of 13 and 14\nDecember, at least 179 Palestinians were killed and another 303 were\ninjured, according to the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Gaza. Overall,\naccording to MoH, between 7 October and 14 December afternoon, at least\n18,787 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza. About 70 per cent are\nsaid to be women and children, and about 50,5897 were reportedly\ninjured. Many people are missing, presumably buried under the rubble,\nwaiting for rescue or recovery.\nAdditionally, intense ground operations and fighting between Israeli\nforces and Palestinian armed groups continued, especially in\nKhan Younus, in southern Gaza.\nAccording to the Israeli military, one Israeli soldier was killed in\nGaza on 14 December, bringing the total number of Israeli soldiers who\nhave been killed in Gaza since the start of the ground operations to\n116, with 648 injured, according to the Israeli military. The firing of\nrockets by Palestinian armed groups into Israel has also continued.\nOn 14 December, for the third consecutive day, Israeli troops,\naccompanied by tanks, raided Kamal 'Adwan Hospital, in Bait Lahya, north\nof Gaza city, with reports of Palestinians being subjected to mass\narrests and ill-treatment. The MoH in Gaza claimed that Israeli troops\nforced all the 2,500 internally displaced persons (IDPs) taking refuge\ninside the hospitals to leave, and evacuated the remaining wounded\npeople and medical staff to the hospital grounds. The MoH also claims\nthat the Israeli military prevented medical staff from providing support\nto 12 babies in intensive care and to ten injured people in the\nemergency department, leading to the death of two patients.\nOn 13 December, following the release of some of the detainees,\nIsraeli forces allegedly shot and injured five people while they were on\ntheir way back to the hospital. Over 70 medical staff, including the\ndirector of the hospital, remain detained at an unknown location.\nAccording to the Israeli military, tens of Hamas operatives have been\ndetained in this operation. That day, the World Health Organization\n(WHO) expressed its concern about\nthe raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital. According to the MoH in Gaza,\nthere are 65 patients including several needing intensive care, and 45\nmedical staff in the hospital. The hospital was already only minimally\nfunctional due to acute shortages of fuel, water, food and medical\nsupplies even before the hospital was sieged. WHO called for the\nprotection of all people inside the hospital.\nOn 14 December, as of 22:00, there are initial reports that at least\n100 trucks carrying humanitarian supplies and four tankers of fuel have\nentered the Gaza Strip. This is well below the daily average of 500\ntruckloads (including fuel and private sector goods) that entered every\nworking day prior to 7 October. At a press conference on 14 December,\nUNRWA Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, declared: “What we need\ntoday is not just 100 trucks, or 200 trucks. We need meaningful, at\nscale, uninterrupted and unconditional flow of basic commodities into\nthe Gaza Strip.” The Humanitarian Coordinator Lynn Hasting has said that\nthe Israeli authorities “need to ensure that the conditions inside of\nGaza are also such that we will be able to provide assistance to\neverybody who is in need.”\nOn 14 December, there were no reports of injured or dual nationals\nevacuating Gaza to Egypt. The total number of wounded Palestinians and\nother medical cases evacuated since October 7 represents one per cent of\nthe reported injury toll. This corresponds to slightly over 400 people,\nwhile an additional 8,000 of the estimated 40,000 injured are said to\nrequire immediate medical intervention.\nOn 14 December at about 17:45, the main Palestinian telecommunication\ngroup in Gaza announced that all services had been cut; the shutdown of\ncommunications is having severe impact on the ability of emergency\nservices and humanitarian partners to reach the vulnerable.\nOn 14 December 2023, in the West Bank, Israeli forces withdrew from\nJenin City and Jenin refugee camp, after a large-scale operation, during\nwhich they had imposed a curfew for about 60 hours. Over this period,\neleven Palestinians, including three children, were killed and dozens\ninjured by Israeli force. An additional fatality was a boy who died\nwhile being impeded from accessing a hospital in an unrelated medical\nemergency. Of the eleven fatalities, one was a boy who, according to\neyewitness accounts by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and the MoH in\nthe West Bank, was shot by Israeli forces within the Khaleel Sulayman\nhospital compound. Two of the overall fatalities in Jenin, including the\naforementioned boy who was impeded from reaching a hospital, died while\nIsraeli forces surrounded the Jenin Governmental Hospital and impeded\ntheir access.\nThe military operation in Jenin involved air and ground strikes, and\nexchange of fire with Palestinians. The operation also resulted in the\ndisplacement of people and severe infrastructure damage, including to\nroads, especially in the refugee camp. Hundreds of Palestinians were\narrested, including some who were released outside of the city after\nhaving been interrogated; they were not allowed to return to Jenin and\nwere forced to take shelter in nearby communities.\nHostilities and casualties (Gaza Strip)\nThe following are among the deadliest incidents reported between\n14:00 on 13 and 14 December:\nOn 13 December, at about 18:20, at least 27 Palestinians were\nreportedly killed and at least ten others were injured when two\nresidential buildings were hit in Ash Shabbora area of Rafa'h, southern\nGaza. On 13 December, at about 22:00, at least 26 Palestinians were\nreportedly killed when a house was struck in Al-Daraj neighborhood of\nGaza city. The bodies were reportedly extracted from the rubble.\nOn 13 December, at about 21:00, a school that was being used as a\nshelter by IDPs, was struck in Al-Shaikh\nRadhwan in Gaza city. Six Palestinians\nwere reportedly killed, and tens were injured. UNRWA reports that, since\n7 October, 222 IDPs sheltering in UNRWA premises have been killed and\n911 injured. A total of 342 school buildings have sustained damage (over\n69% of all school buildings in Gaza). Of the 70 UNRWA-damaged schools,\nat least 56 serve as shelters for IDPs. Several schools, including UNRWA\nschools, have been directly hit by Israeli strikes or tank shells. On 13\nDecember, at about 12:30, an Israeli military drone reportedly killed a\nPalestinian girl in an UNRWA school sheltering IDPs in Al-Dthahra\narea, western Khan Younus. According\nto Ministry of Education (MoE), as of 5 December, more than 3,477\nstudents and 203 educational staff have been killed. MoE further notes\nthat more than 5,429 students and 507 teachers have been injured in the\nGaza Strip since 7 October.\nDisplacement (Gaza Strip)\nAreas encompassing nearly 30 per cent of the Gaza Strip (excluding\nthe orders to evacuate the areas north of Wadi Gaza) have been marked\nfor evacuation on the Israeli military’s online map that was launched on\n1 December. Access to this information is impaired by recurrent\ninterruptions in telecommunications and the lack of electricity.\nObtaining an accurate total of the displaced remains challenging, but\nas of 12 December, according to UNRWA, almost 1.9 million people in\nGaza, or nearly 85 per cent of the population, are estimated to be\ninternally displaced, including people who have been displaced multiple\ntimes. As of 13 December, nearly 1.3 million of these IDPs were\nregistered in 155 UNRWA facilities across Gaza, including more than 1.2\nmillion in 98 UNRWA shelters in the Middle Area,\nKhan Younus and Rafa'h. governorates.\nTens of thousands of IDPs, who have arrived in Rafa'h since 3 December,\ncontinue to face extremely overcrowded conditions both inside and\noutside shelters. Without enough latrines, open-air defecation is\nprevalent, increasing concerns of further spread of disease,\nparticularly during winter weather.\nElectricity\nSince 11 October, the Gaza Strip has been under an electricity\nblackout, after the Israeli authorities cut off the electricity supply,\nand fuel reserves for Gaza’s sole power plant were depleted. For more\ninformation on electricity supply to the Gaza strip, please see this dashboard.\nHealth care, including attacks (Gaza Strip)\nOn 14 December, WHO announced that it had delivered 4,200 body bags\nwith support from the Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE),\nunderscoring the critical need to safeguard civilians from the risk of\ninfection. For the ninth consecutive day, Al-'Awda Hospital, Jabalya\n(northern Gaza), remains surrounded by Israeli troops and tanks, and\nfighting with armed Palestinian groups is reported in its vicinity.\nReportedly, 250 doctors, patients, and their family members are trapped\ninside the hospital.\nOn 9 December, two medical staff were reportedly killed while on duty\ninside the hospital, during clashes between Israeli forces and\nPalestinian armed groups. Currently, only 11 out of 36 hospitals in the\nGaza Strip are functional and able to admit new patients, although\nservices are limited. Only one of these hospitals is in the north,\naccording to WHO. The two major hospitals in southern Gaza are operating\nat three times their bed capacity, while facing critical shortages of\nbasic supplies and fuel. According to the MoH in Gaza, occupancy rates\nare now reaching 206 per cent in inpatient departments and 250 per cent\nin intensive care units. Additionally, these hospitals are providing\nshelter to thousands of IDPs.\nOn 14 December, Jabalya Health Centre was reportedly hit, with severe\ndamage caused to the center and the vicinity. No casualties have been\nreported. There have been significant increases or increased risk of\noutbreak in some communicable diseases and conditions such as diarrhea,\ninfluenza, chicken pox, meningitis, jaundice, impetigo acute respiratory\ninfections, skin infections and hygiene-related conditions like lice and\nscabies. The heavy rains and flooding which affected large parts of Gaza\non 13 December compounded human misery and added to the risk of\nwaterborne diseases.\nWater, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)\nOn 13 December, WASH partners reported an urgent need for pipes and\nconstruction material. Stockpiles of material for the repairing of pipe\nsystems are running low, and many of the pipe systems have been damaged\nand need of repair. Inability to provide repairs could result in water\nbeing cut off from certain areas. On 13 December, heavy rains fell on\nGaza, flooding multiple areas, worsening the living conditions of IDPs\namid lack, or limited capacity, to manage sewage, particularly in IDP\nshelters, and the accumulation of solid waste in various locations.\nDue to the lack or limited capacity of latrines especially in IDP\nshelters, people are adopting unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as open\ndefecation. In shelters, people wait for hours to access toilets, and in\nsome other locations where IDPs are located, no toilets are available at\nall. Children reportedly defecate in the open, while adults resort to\nbuckets and dispose of the waste in improvised areas or solid waste\ndumps. In many locations, solid waste is piling up with no effective\nwaste management mechanism for collection or disposal. Reportedly, rats\nand insects, including mosquitos, congregate in these areas,\ncontributing to the risk of spreading disease.\nKilling and Injuring of Palestinians in the\nWest Bank\nby Israeli Occupation Regime Forces\nA group of Palestinians survive an Israeli airstrike in\nBalata refugee camp\nNABLUS, Thursday, December 14, 2023 (WAFA) –\nA group of Palestinians survived an Israeli genocidal drone strike\nwhich targeted a vehicle last night in Balata refugee camp, in the\nnorthern West Bank city of Nablus, according to Palestinian security\nsources.\nAn Israeli military drone targeted the vehicle with two missiles\nwhile driving in the vicinity of Balata refugee camp, east of Nablus,\nsaid the sources.
