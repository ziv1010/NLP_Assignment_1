  "body_text": "With experienced mentor Tom Sermanni locked in as the Matildas' interim coach, Football Australia will ramp up its search for the full-time candidate entrusted to take the team forward.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nOn Tuesday, FA announced Sermanni, who led the Matildas in two stints between 1994-1997 and 2005-2012 including winning the 2010 Women's Asian Cup, would take the reins ahead of upcoming friendlies.\nThe Matildas play Germany away in October and are also expected to face Switzerland in that window.\nFA are set to begin talks with shortlisted candidates for the permanent role in the coming weeks.\nChief executive James Johnson has consistently asserted his determination to take as much time as needed to find the right candidate.\n\"We are conducting a thorough and comprehensive search for our next permanent head coach,\" Johnson said in a statement.\n\"Tom's appointment allows us the time and space to make the right decision for the long-term future of the Matildas' program, while ensuring our team remains in capable hands for the upcoming international fixtures.\"\nFA wants a coach for a full four-year cycle, tasked with winning a home Asian Cup in 2026 before taking Australia to the 2027 Women's World Cup and the 2028 Olympics.\nThe coach will also have to navigate new standalone qualifiers for the World Cup. Previously, the Asian Cup doubled as World Cup qualifiers.\nFormer Manchester United and San Diego coach Casey Stoney, Sydney FC boss Ante Juric and former Matildas assistant Ross Aloisi are among the potential candidates for the full-time role.\nIn the meantime, the players will regroup under the watchful eye of a familiar face.\nThe Matildas' longest-serving coach, Sermanni brought through the majority of the team's 'golden generation', including Sam Kerr and Caitlin Foord.\n\"With over three decades of football experience in Australia and internationally, his extensive knowledge of the global women's football landscape, the local Australian game and his previous success with the team make him the ideal candidate to guide the Matildas through this transitional period,\" Johnson said.\nSermanni led the Matildas to quarter-finals at the 2007 and 2011 Women's World Cups and to the 2010 Women's Asian Cup title - their only triumph in Asia to date.\nHe coached the United States from 2013 to 2014, was an assistant for Canada in 2015 then led New Zealand from 2018 until the end of the Tokyo Olympics.\nSermanni, 70, will take a temporary leave of absence from his role as head of women's football at Western Sydney Wanderers.\n\"It's an honour to return to the Matildas, even in this interim capacity,\" he said.\n\"I'm looking forward to working with this talented group of players and helping to ensure a smooth transition as Football Australia continues its search for a permanent head coach.\"\nAustralian Associated Press",
