View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251201171907/en/\nThe state-of-the-art TLC for LED lighting system at Ullevaal Stadium has made Norway's national stadium one of the few in the world with FIFA Quality Pro Certification.\nHome to Norway's national football team, Ullevaal Stadium opened in 1926 and has a rich history of hosting significant sporting and entertainment events. When stadium ownership at the Football Association of Norway (NFF) decided to upgrade the venue's lighting, they envisioned a system with the most advanced LED technology for the best possible playing, viewing, and entertainment experience.\n\"Our main priorities for the new lighting system were that it was a modern and future-oriented system that created the perfect playing conditions for our players, is easy to use, and could put on exciting light shows,\" said Jørgen Søgård, Chief Technology Officer at Ullevaal Stadium.\nWhile the new system, which was designed by Musco and installed by Asto Elektro, achieved those goals, it also came with another significant benefit certification through the FIFA Quality Programme for Floodlights.\nDeveloped in collaboration with football associations, lighting industry leaders, and test institutes around the world, the FIFA Quality Programme for Floodlights certifies that a lighting system meets elevated, specified standards of quality and performance.\nAs the first-ever FIFA Preferred Provider for Floodlight Systems, Musco custom designed the TLC for LED system at Ullevaal to achieve those performance standards, making it one of just a small handful of stadiums worldwide with the designation.\n\"Ullevaal Stadium holds a special place in the hearts of Norwegians, and that was something the NFF and everyone involved in the project wanted to honour,\" said Chris Limpach, Musco's Director of Europe, Middle East, and Africa Business. \"The high standards they set along with the FIFA designation just demonstrate their commitment to providing the best possible stadium experience. It was an exceptional project to be a part of.\"\nAbout Ullevaal Stadium\nUllevaal Stadium has been Norway's match venue for football since 1926. Today, the stadium hosts both the women's and men's national teams, as well as the cup finals for men and women. In both 1987 and 1997 Ullevaal Stadium hosted the final in the women's Euro championship. Alongside the football activity, the Ullevaal Stadium Ltd. rents out offices and stores in the stadium body and also houses Oslo's largest conference centre, Meet Ullevaal, which includes 37 meeting rooms, with the largest room fitting more than 700 people.
