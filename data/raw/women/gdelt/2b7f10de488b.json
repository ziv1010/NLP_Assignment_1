If they had, Wolves would have celebrated thinking they were going to be in the second tier next season. They would have then been told that would not have been possible.\nPlayers have come out and said they are \"devastated\" to find out the news. They were told after their final game of the season, a 6-0 win against Liverpool Feds.\nBeth Merrick took to social media to vent her frustrations: \"As a group we are absolutely devastated to finish the season this way and believe it speaks volumes about the club’s ambitions for the women’s team. For our staff to have to deliver this news to us moments after is astonishing.\n“Our players, staff and fans deserve so much better. The staff have put in hours of dedication, for a bid to never be submitted. It’s not about money, it’s about honesty and transparency.”\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nYes if Wolves had been promoted and the club had applied for it then the owners would have had to put more money into the team.\nMore staff would have had to be hired and travelling costs for games potentially would have increased. But it is yet another example of a lack of want to invest in women's football.\nWolves' men's side play in the Premier League and this season had been fighting relegation. Had they gone down, which is now not mathematically possible, the owners would most definitely been aiming for promotion with the financial burden a lot higher.\nAnd yes the men's team bring in more money because of the broadcasting rights and everything else that comes with men's top-flight football.\nBut the women's game is never going to grow to their potential or reach the heights of the men's financial situation if owners are not prepared to invest now.\nLondon City Lionesses are the perfect example of investing in a team. Michelle Kang bought the club before the current season and has poured money into the team with Women's Super League promotion the goal.\nThey are now top of the Championship table and if they beat Birmingham this weekend they will be in the top-flight.\nThat is the respect women's football and its players deserve. Not a lack of communication with its players and a lack of ambition as Wolves have demonstrated.\nThe Wolves players are wearing the same badge, giving the same energy and dedication to the club. They deserve the same in return from its owners.\nSarah joined the FourFourTwo team in September 2024 in a freelance role.
