  "body_text": "Caitlin Clark and the Hawkeye’s Magical Sunday at Carver [VIDEO]\nThere was magic in the air of Carver-Hawkeye Arena on Sunday. The Iowa women's basketball team welcomed 4th ranked USC to town. It was also the same day that Caitlin Clark would see her #22 jersey raised to the rafters to hang in Hawkeye immortality. You just knew that Jen Jansen and the Iowa women wouldn't accept a loss, not on this day.\nIowa got off to an 18-1 start, and it seemed as if the roof would blow off of Carver-Hawkeye yesterday afternoon. But the fourth-ranked Trojans battled back and led by one point at the half. That is when the Lucy Olsen show began for Iowa. The senior transfer scored 23 of her game-high 28 points in the second half according to the Cedar Rapids Gazette, including 15 in the pivotal fourth quarter. When it was all over, Iowa had earned a 76-69 win and USC had their 15-game winning streak snapped!\nBut it wasn't just Olsen. Taylor McCabe hit three early three-pointers. Addison O'Grady played big minutes down the stretch while Hannah Stuelke sat on the bench with four fouls. And that defense! It was smothering all day, forcing USC into 18 turnovers. JuJu Watkins led USC with 27 points but shot just 8 of 22 from the field.\nAnd then, it was the moment that Iowa fans had been waiting for. Caitlin Clark would see her #22 jersey hung in the rafters of Carver-Hawkeye Arena. Her family would join her at half-court. Former teammates including Kate Martin, Gabby Marshall, and Monica Cziano were there too. Heck, even a former late-night talk show host from Indiana showed up at Carver!\nCurrent Iowa coach Jan Jensen and former head coach Lisa Bluder honored Clark at halfcourt before her jersey ascended. Even USC players and coaches stayed to watch the historic moment.\nClark then took the mic and thanked everyone for coming. She also apologized for the high ticket prices. She thanked her coaches, teammates, the fans, and of course, her family for being her rock during her years at the University of Iowa. She also promised to come back to Carver! The Indiana Fever will play a preseason game in Iowa City later this spring.\nIt doesn't get much better than Sunday, Hawkeye fans. Remember these days, because they don't come around very often.
