CHARTER COULD BE THE END OF THE CABLE BUNDLE…AND SPORTS AS WE KNOW IT\nIn the summer of 2014, the cable and satellite bundle peaked. One hundred million households were subscribed to ESPN, the most successful channel in the history of cable, and the apex of the greatest business in the history of media had been reached. But no one knew it. Cable, satellite, and media executives were all blissfully unaware of what was coming. Fox Sports FS1 had launched the prior year — yours truly appeared on the very first show in the history of the network, a 2013 college football preview show. In the summer of 2014 the SEC Network would make... -\nHomeless destroy motel in Wyoming city, leave about 500 pounds in feces on streets: mayor\nA city in Wyoming has been overrun with an unprecedented homeless population that’s destroyed a vacant motel and has left hundreds of pounds of feces across the area, according to its mayor.

The report was delivered during their Aug. 24-25 meeting in Jacksonville. While they... -\nDemocratic donors are doubling down on Biden despite concerns about age\nTop Democratic donors are doubling down on President Biden’s re-election – despite a Wall Street Journal poll that states 80% of Americans believe he’s too old, On The Money has learned.

Now landlords have found a way to make things even worse. A growing number of property owners and managers are hitting tenants with extra fees each month — a nickel-and-diming of people that the airlines, for one, have made a core aspect of their business model. It’s been common for years for landlords to charge more for a parking space or having a pet. -\nMassachusetts’ Religious Bigotry Leaves Foster Kids Without Homes\nReligious freedom, Congress said unanimously in 1998, “undergirds the very origin and existence of the United States.” Today, however, an obsession with gender ideology is driving governments to ignore the First Amendment, defy clear Supreme Court precedent, and even violate their own laws and regulations to root out those with the “wrong” religious views about sexuality. This bigotry not only violates fundamental rights, but it also puts vulnerable children at risk. During the 2021-22 fiscal year, more than 9,700 children were placed in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families, which had already acknowledged a serious lack... -\nAstronomy Picture of the Day - The Large Cloud of Magellan\nExplanation: The 16th century Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan and his crew had plenty of time to study the southern sky during the first circumnavigation of planet Earth.

Jared Polis for Saying Abortion Is ‘Bad’\nPro-choice groups advertise 'Abortion is Good/El Aborto es Bueno' T-shirtsColorado Gov. Jared Polis might want to have checked with a few more Democrats before declaring that they believe abortion is “bad.” The pro-choice governor landed in hot water with some fellow Democrats and abortion rights groups as he sought to find common ground between the parties by saying both sides agree that elective pregnancy termination isn’t a good thing. “Democrats don’t believe that abortion is good. We believe it’s bad. It should be minimized,” Mr. Polis said in a July 23 interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “How do... -\nPresident Trump Takes Commanding 50 Point Primary Lead at 62% – Gains Largest Polling Lead Against Biden 42/37\nPremise Polling conducted by 538 Project [DATA HERE] shows President Donald Trump with a commanding 50-point lead over the rest of the field.

In the last few years, we’ve seen exposés from the sets of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The Kelly Clarkson Show, and Dr. Phil, featuring accusations of bullying leadership styles and deteriorating mental health among staffers.
