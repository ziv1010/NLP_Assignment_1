  "body_text": "While the hosts at Chigwell Construction Stadium are the ones with three losses in three Women’s Super League matches, the pressure on taking the three points today was all on Chelsea Women. Preferably with a bigger scoreline than last weekend’s where a 1-0 win over Leicester City felt extremely underwhelming given how dominant the Blues were on the pitch at Kingsmeadow.\nWest Ham WFC 0-4 Chelsea FCW, Women’s Super League: Post-match reaction\nMultiple goals in a dominant win!\nThe Hammers tried to bring some heat to a Chelsea backline which hasn’t looked very “hot” in our first three matches of the season. But once the Blues started to connect a few more passes in midfield and breach the hosts’ defence, the goals started pouring in.\nAs is almost tradition at this point, Aggie Beever-Jones started the works with a superb free-kick.\nJohanna Rytting Kaneryd followed with a poaching goal from Wieke Kaptein’s assist.\nAnd then came Erin Cuthbert, with a dink over Kinga Szemik to get us a third goal.\nThree goals in under 15 minutes, and that was followed by Inès Belloumou getting a red card for pulling Alyssa Thompson’s hair. An almost perfect first half for a Chelsea team that could very well sit back and let West Ham run on quicksand.\nIn the second half West Ham looked like they were going to get at least a goal against us despite being a women down. That wasn’t enough as it were Chelsea who scored instead, via Wieke Kaptein.\nCarefree!\n- An almost clear 3-5-2 on the pitch with Alyssa Thompson and Johanna Rytting Kaneryd as wing-backs.\n- Four goals in four consecutive matches for Aggie Beever-Jones, and this one is a beautiful free kick.\n- Even Kinga Szemik seemed like she couldn’t help but give props to Erin Cuthbert for the vision she had as she dinked over the West Ham goalkeeper for our third goal today.\n- Next up: Manchester United away in the Women’s Super League.\n- KTBFFH!",
