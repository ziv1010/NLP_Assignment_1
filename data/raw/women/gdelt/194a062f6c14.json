See original.\nBy MUHAMMAD IKHSAN MAHAR\n20 Jul 2023 13:12 WIB · English\nThe following article was translated using both Microsoft Azure Open AI and Google Translation AI.\nAUCKLAND, WEDNESDAY— FIFA has made various efforts to increase the popularity of the Women's World Cup, but the dominance of the United States never fades away. In the 2023 edition, the United States has the greatest chance of pursuing an achievement that cannot be equaled, which is winning three consecutive Women's World Cup titles.\nThe curtain of the 2023 Women's World Cup will be opened by one of the hosts, New Zealand, who will host Norway on Thursday, July 20th, 2023 at 2:00 PM WIB at the Eden Park Stadium in Auckland. Besides New Zealand, Australia is also a co-host of the biggest women's football competition in its ninth edition.\nIn addition to being the first FIFA tournament to be held in two different confederations, the 2023 Women's World Cup will be the first women's soccer tournament to be contested by 32 teams. The number of contestants has increased from the 24 teams introduced at Canada 2015.\nAlthough FIFA has added contestants to increase the quality of the tournament, the USA remains the main power axis of world women's soccer. The collection of four World Cup trophies, of which two were won in a row in 2015 and 2019, confirms the unrivaled supremacy of the team called \"The Stars and Stripes\".\nAlso read: Sarina Wiegman, Changer in the History of England Women's Football\nIn the previous eight editions of the Women's World Cup, the worst achievement of the United States was winning a bronze medal. They also reached the final match five times. Only Japan was able to defeat them in the final match in Germany in 2011.\nThe note boosted Alex Morgan and her colleagues' confidence before competing in Australia and New Zealand. Besides having a shining record, the US also had some minor issues before appearing in the world event.\nThe United States has undergone a transition period since being led by Vlatko Andonovski following the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup and bringing back a bronze medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. They also won all eight matches during 2023, including their sixth title at the SheBelieves Cup tournament in February.\nWhen other teams lost many important players, such as England and the Netherlands, the US only had to sacrifice their defender and captain, Becky Sauerbrunn, who suffered an injury. Key players in France 2019, such as Alyssa Naeher (35), Kelley O'Hara (34), Rose Lavelle (28), Lindsey Horan (29), Megan Rapinoe (38), and Morgan (34), remain irreplaceable parts this year.\nAlso read: Rehanne Skinner: The Long Way to Fight for Equality in the Field\nO'Hara considers the US squad composition ideal to compete for the championship trophy. In addition to the senior players, Andonovski also brings 14 players who will participate in the debut of the World Cup.\n\"You need some experienced players and combine them with debutant players to undergo a good adventure in the World Cup.\"\n\"You need some experienced players and mix them with debutant players to embark on a good adventure in the World Cup,\" said O'Hara as quoted by the USWNT website on Tuesday (18/7/2023).\"\nVietnam, Portugal, and the opponent in the 2019 final, the Netherlands, will be the rivals of the United States in Group E. Facing Vietnam, who are experiencing their first World Cup, on Saturday (22/7/2023) at 08.00 WIB, at Eden Park Stadium will mark the beginning of the US journey to pursue their fifth championship title to be on par with Brazil in the Men's World Cup.\nDespite being favored to easily advance to the round of 16, Andonovski emphasized that there are no easy opponents in the World Cup. According to him, the three opponents of the US in the group stage have different styles and philosophies of play, so his team must be able to learn each opponent's strengths.\nAlso read: The Covid-19 Pandemic Threatens the Existence of Women's Football\n\"We have enough time to prepare ourselves to study them separately. The first goal is to win the group before thinking about the ultimate target (winning the championship),\" said Andonovski.\nThe three main competitors of the US in pursuing the trophy of the 2023 World Cup are two champion teams, namely the champion of the 2022 Women's European Cup, England, and the gold medalist of the 2020 Olympics, Canada, as well as the host team, Australia.\nEngland has lost defender and captain, Leah Williamson, and goal machine, Beth Mead, due to injury. Without Mead, England no longer has a player who has collected 20 goals at the international level, but Coach Sarina Wiegman can rely on midfield players such as Ella Toone and Georgia Stanway as alternative goal scorers.\nFor an injection of experience, Keira Walsh and Lucy Bronze can transmit their success with Barcelona in winning the 2022-2023 Women's Champions League to the squad. With the current lineup of players and support from the Australian and New Zealand public, two Commonwealth countries of the United Kingdom, Wiegman is not afraid to face the US.\nSee also: Saving Afghanistan Women's Soccer Team Members\n\"The US team has a tough mentality and can always perform their best in official tournaments. They remain a strong team, but all countries have shown good development in women's football. I think the US will no longer be seen as dominant in this World Cup,\" said Wiegman, who is ambitious to surpass England's bronze medal achievement in 2015, to ESPN.\"\nCanada will still rely on veteran striker Christine Sinclair to lead and score goals in order to reach their first final in the World Cup. Canadian coach Bev Priestman has the opportunity to repeat the pragmatic tactics used in the Tokyo Olympics.\nAt that time, Canada brought home the first Olympic gold medal thanks to their solid defense, as they only conceded one goal in three knockout stage matches against Brazil, the US, and Sweden.\n\"I know each one of the 23 players that I bring. I am sure they can give different results for us,\" said Priestman as quoted by the Canadian Football Federation website.\nSee also: United States Rules Women's Soccer\nMeanwhile, Australia does not want to waste their golden generation's opportunity to present a world champion in front of their supporters in women's football. Samantha Kerr is the backbone of \"The Matildas\" in achieving their first prestigious title on the green field. Canada, Nigeria, and Ireland are the opponents that Australia must overcome in Group B before thinking of becoming the champion.\n\"Three things are our strength and DNA, namely the game of pressing, the speed of possession of the ball in the process of attacking, and the ability to take advantage of set pieces,\" said Australian coach Tony Gustavsson about his team's capital to FIFA+.\nWriter:\nMUHAMMAD IKHSAN MAHAR |\nEditor:\nWISNU AJI DEWABRATA",
