  "body_text": "Rehanne Skinner exclusive: Progress at West Ham is clear and a product of patience and support\nRehanne Skinner has made it clear during her two years in charge of West Ham Women: she wants to leave the club in better shape than she found it.\nThat ambition drives the 45-year-old as she pushes for what she calls “organic growth” at a side that has been part of the WSL since 2018.\nAsked whether she would achieve that if she walked away tomorrow, Skinner pauses briefly before replying with certainty: “Yes.”\nShe took over ahead of the 2023/24 season, a campaign that ended in disappointment with a second-bottom finish but ultimately ensured survival.\nAnd last season showed progress — more wins, more goals, more points, and a step up the table.\n“With the depth in our squad now, it’s far more competitive,” she tells Standard Sport. “Our staff group has grown significantly, as well as our position within the football club.\n“Bit by bit, every time a transfer window comes along to add depth to the squad, we’re able to achieve closer to our philosophy on a consistent basis.”\nSome clubs flip and change things quite quickly, which kills that consistency\nRehanne Skinner\nEven getting that opportunity is a privilege. Skinner feels supported.\n“It takes time. Some clubs flip and change things quite quickly, which kills consistency and the opportunity to put things in place properly,” she continues.\n“As much as my role is manager, many managers in the women’s game are also sporting directors and, at times, heads of recruitment. So my connection with the board [is vital].”\nSkinner adds: “We scored nine more goals last season than the club ever has. These aspects are helping us become more competitive in the league — that’s what we’re here to do.”\nWest Ham had a successful summer window — “we’ve had some real quality come into the building” — including the signings of highly rated defender Leila Wandeler from Lyon and midfielder Anna Csiki on loan from Tottenham.\nIt was Spurs who West Ham faced first, beaten 1-0 by a late Beth England penalty in their WSL opener — a match Skinner felt her side did not deserve to lose.\n“It’s football, right?” she says. “But what it boils down to is taking control of the key moments of the game in our favour. We didn’t do enough of that. But we limited the only shot on target to being from the penalty spot. From a structural perspective, that’s a positive.\n“Our higher finish last season was through a season’s worth of hard work. Multiple games we dropped points we shouldn’t have dropped, so, on the balance of it, you have to make sure you pick up those points in other settings.\n“We make ourselves very difficult to break down, and reduced the number of goals we conceded last season. There’s a real work ethic amongst the team.”\nThere needs to be. On Friday night, under the lights at the Chigwell Construction Stadium, they host Arsenal in their second league match of the new season.\n“It’s unusual for Arsenal to not score goals in games,” Skinner notes. “You’ve got to prepare for that, not just from a defensive perspective but also mentality. It can’t put you off what you’re trying to achieve.\n“In this league, to jump from, say, ninth to fourth is a really tough ask. Our biggest goal is to improve on our position, whether that be points or the actual position, we just want organic growth.”\nThe last remaining tickets are on sale for West Ham Women vs Arsenal Women tonight, and can be purchased here.",
