I spoke with her about her situation and we've done the same work with her as everyone else.\n\"We have assessed her performances for Tigres and spoken with her coach.\n\"In her position, we have Patri [Guijarro], Aitana [Bonmati], Alexia [Putellas], Maite [Zubieta], Vicky [Lopez] and even Mariona [Caldentey] or [Claudia] Pina can come in there.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\n\"It's hard to pick 23 players, but we do the job professionally. At the end of the day that is what we have chosen.\"\nBut Hermoso, who has not played for Spain in 2025, hinted at other reasons as to why she may have been left out.\nShe posted on social media: \"I truly have a clear conscience, especially when I remove environments with such bad energy from my life.\n\"Managing? That's what others should learn to do; that part is too big for them. I tweet because it's the only way I have left to have a \"conversation.\"\nThere has been no confirmation on if there is a rift between Hermoso and the Spain manager.\nHermoso was last involved in a major tournament at the 2023 World Cup, where Spain beat England 1-0 in the final.\nAfter she and the team won the trophy, ex-Spanish football federation president Luis Rubiales kissed her without her permission.\nEarlier this year, he was found guilty of sexual assault.\nSarah joined the FourFourTwo team in September 2024 in a freelance role.
