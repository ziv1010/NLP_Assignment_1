Utah and the Bay Area are reportedly on track for 2024, while Boston will get its team later.\nThe Utah ownership group is led by David Blitzer and Ryan Smith, who also own Real Salt Lake of MLS. Smith also owns the NBA's Utah Jazz, while Blitzer has stakes in several teams, including Crystal Palace of the Premier League, the New Jersey Devils and the Philadelphia 76ers.\nAlso in the ownership group are Philadelphia 76ers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey and Kraft Analytics Group CEO Jessica Gelman, per ESPN. The group got the team at a significant discount compared to the other two expansion teams, reportedly paying between $2 million and $5 million.\nThe team will play its games at Real Salt Lake's America First Credit Union Field and will be run by team president Michelle Hyncik, a former Harvard soccer player who worked as legal counsel for the MLS and RSL.\nFirst version Royals moved to Kansas City under cloud of scandal\nThe return of the Royals comes three years after the previous incarnation of the team was sold amid allegations against team owner Dell Loy Hansen, who also owned Real Salt Lake, of racist remarks and a toxic workplace culture, including the use of slurs.\nFormer Royals manager Craig Harrington was also among the many coaches and executives cited in the NWSL/NWSL Players Association report, in his case for being verbally abusive and making sexual advances toward Royals players.\nThe Royals eventually ceased operations and their assets were eventually sold to a group in Kansas City that included Brittany Mahomes, the wife of Kansas City Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes. That team became the Kansas City Current, which went 10-6-6 last season and reached the NWSL championship game.\nWhile the first Royals tenure in Utah ended in scandal, the NWSL made sure to note the fan support in the city was a major reason for its decision, saying the team had the second-highest average attendance during its three seasons of existence.\nWelcome back, @UtahRoyalsFC! pic.twitter.com/zGguwFgYVZ\n— National Women’s Soccer League (@NWSL) March 12, 2023\nWhen Blitzer and Smith purchased Real Salt Lake, that deal reportedly came with the option to acquire an NWSL expansion team, and the result is Utah getting back a soccer team it never should have lost.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.",
