  "body_text": "It’s been five days since news broke of Chelsea signing one of the world’s best defenders, Naomi Girma from National Women’s Soccer League club San Diego Wave.\nOfficial: Chelsea sign Naomi Girma from San Diego Wave\nA world-class arrival!\nThe lack of updates since may have made us worry that the world-record deal could be in jeopardy. But as it turns out, the Blues were just waiting for the perfect moment to announce the deal: the game against Arsenal at Stamford Bridge today.\nOur new No.16 arrives on a 4.5-year contract, with Chelsea paying a transfer fee of $1.1m to San Diego — making Girma’s move the first transfer in women’s professional football to surpass the $1m mark.\nShe’s done more than enough to justify us breaking that record, as she’s been NWSL’s Defender of the Year in two of her three professional seasons.\n“I’m so happy and really excited to be here. It doesn’t feel real.\n“There are a lot of things about Chelsea that made me want to come here - the culture, the winning mentality, staff and players. It’s a top environment to learn and grow in.\n“Right now, that’s what I’m looking to do. It was an easy choice for me.”\n-Naomi Girma; source: Chelsea FC\nWelcome, Naomi! Let’s win some things! Let’s keep winning all the games!",
