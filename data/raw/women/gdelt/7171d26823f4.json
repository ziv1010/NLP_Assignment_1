We are not saying that we do not want this park renovated or White Stadium renovated,” Welch said. “We do want it renovated. We want it renovated for our children. This city has a history of leaving our children behind and this is just another way to do that.”\nWhite Stadium was constructed with money from philanthropist George Robert White, who in his will left a charitable trust to the city to fund projects for “use and enjoyment” by Boston residents. It opened in 1949, with operating costs and maintenance borne by Boston Public Schools, which uses it for games for some athletic teams.\nThe stadium is also used for other community events, including Boston Public Schools graduations, the Boston Athletic Association half marathon, summer camps, Special Olympics events and music and cultural events.\nDuring the week, it is open to the public for use of the track, field and bleachers.\nHowever, since its construction in the 1940s, White Stadium has fallen into disrepair because of the school system’s inability to keep up with the costs.\nAccording to court documents, the 10,000-seat stadium’s concrete foundation is deteriorating, the lighting, plumbing and HVAC systems are outdated and the structure is not up to current building and fire codes or the Americans with Disabilities Act.\nIn addition, while the west grandstand is open for use, the inside of the east grandstand was significantly damaged by a fire more than 30 years ago and has been unusable since.\nMore boston\n- He killed a man at 19 and married a Boston city councilor in prison.

During the soccer season, Boston Public Schools football teams would be moved to other facilities, but would have full use of the stadium once the soccer season ended.\nThe announcement of the plans was hit with immediate backlash from community members, who have criticized the partial loss of athletics facilities in an already-stretched-thin school district as well as the potential loss of a community asset in an area of the city largely populated by people of color.\nIn their lawsuit, the Franklin Park Defenders said the city had moved too quickly on the project, not considering any other alternatives, and that the influx of visitors to Franklin Park on games days would “fundamentally alter the nature and feel” of the park.\n“The whole park is under siege,” Louis Elisa, a founding member of the Franklin Park Coalition and one of the plaintiffs, said Tuesday. “They are looking to drop things into this environment that [Franklin park designer and famed landscape architect Frederick Law] Olmsted did not plan for this environment. They’re willing to take away the space and activities that are here for the community, that were created for people to have a respite, to come away from the challenges of their urban community, from the noise of the streets, from their jobs in the large, built-up buildings to a place that was pristine, verdant and that you can relax and enjoy your family and friends.”\nWhile the plaintiffs had requested the court enter a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order to stop the project until the lawsuit plays out, on March 22, Judge Sarah Weyland Ellis denied their request, saying they had failed to demonstrate the project would cause “irreparable harm” to them or the community.\nEllis wrote that in contrast with the plaintiff’s claims the project would restrict access to the stadium and the Grove, the redevelopment would actually expand access, upping estimated usable hours of the playing surface from 250 hours to 750 hours annually, of which the professional soccer team’s use “would only consume a fraction.”\n“The stadium property, to date, has not allowed unrestricted or exclusive public access,” she wrote. “The proposed project would provide public access to the east grandstand and the Grove, where presently, the public has no access. Finally, the proposed project would create additional spaces within the stadium property for public use ... and additional areas for the use of BPS students, including locker rooms and bathrooms, a conditioning suite and sports medicine facilities.”\nThe Grove was accessible by reporters and members of the Defenders on Tuesday.\nWhile the city did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday afternoon, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has repeatedly defended the White Stadium project, saying the partnership with a private entity was necessary to pay for the renovations.\nDuring an appearance on GBH’s Boston Public Radio last month, she said most National Women’s Soccer League teams play only 13 home games a year, and that Franklin Park already hosts events much larger than the maximum crowd at a soccer game.\nShe said that currently, the two football teams that play at White Stadium, those from Boston Latin School and Boston Latin Academy, play five home games at the stadium each season, but do not have practices there. Once the stadium is renovated, she said, more teams will be able to make use of it by playing championship and end-of-season games there.\n“This is a BPS facility. So with 100 other buildings that are in much need of investment ... without the partnership to make the whole stadium possible, we’re not going to be able to prioritize making half the stadium’s renovations in there instead of doing over another school that badly needs it,” Wu said. “If this doesn’t happen to the potential and standard that we believe our student athletes deserve, then those dollars will be best used elsewhere within the BPS footprint.”\nIn a statement, Boston Unity Soccer Partners emphasized the judge’s opinion in her decision that there is no legal basis for the lawsuit.\n“The Emerald Necklace Conservancy’s sentiments are not consistent with the feedback we’ve heard from neighbors, civic leaders, community groups and elected officials in our more than 180 meetings and conversations since starting the process over a year and a half ago,” the organization said. “We continue to invite the community at large to offer constructive feedback on the proposed plans and to participate in the many upcoming public meetings. We are proud to be part of a project that honors the legacy of White Stadium so that it will continue to serve as a cornerstone of our community for generations to come.”\nDespite reassurances from the city, multiple plaintiffs who spoke at the press conference said they did not believe the city’s promises of access to the stadium, both for students and the general public, and felt the city had not been clear or transparent throughout the process.\nThey said that by moving to the discovery phase of the lawsuit, in which each side will request and provide documents relevant to the case, they hope to gain more insight into the city’s plans for White Stadium and potential impacts on the area.\n“Ultimately, this is a question about self-determination, about the community being able to decide what their and our and your public park would be used for,” Emerald Necklace Conservancy President Karen Mauney-Brodek said. “Many of us here love soccer. We think Boston would be well-served to have a soccer team here, but not in this public park that is so essential to the health, the well-being and the needs of the Boston Public Schools students.”",
