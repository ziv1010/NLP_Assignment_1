Don’t you worry, there’s plenty of softball news coming later today.\nMizzou Hoops appears to be headed back to the Sunshine State during Feast Week to take part in the inaugural Emerald Coast Classic in Niceville, Florida on the campus of Northwest Florida State College. Niceville appears to be located around the Fort Walton Beach area of the state in the panhandle.\nThis news comes a week after the release of Mizzou’s SEC opponents.\nThe other teams involved in this event appear to be Alabama, a team with an unidentified winged creature (perhaps Alabama State?), Clemson, a team with a fire-breathing dragon (UAB, perhaps?), Creighton, Syracuse (I think?) and Wichita State.\nNote to self: Read MUTigers release instead of conducting a google search for teams with winged insects, dragons and S’s in their logos, as it would have saved me some time\nPer the MUTigers.com release, Mizzou is slotted into the “Beach Bracket” and will compete against Creighton (26-6), Syracuse (24-8) or Wichita State (10-22). The “or” leaves me questioning who exactly the Tigers will play. I guess we’ll see...\nJust to wrap this up, here’s a quick review of the very eventful offseason for Missouri women’s basketball.\nThe Tigers had a ROUGH season, accumulating just 11 wins and two in the SEC. They finished the season on a 12-game losing streak... so yeah, that’s not good. We talked about it in this roundtable on April 4 after the news came out that Mizzou would be retaining Pingeton’s services despite ample reason to move on. I also wrote about it here. Women’s Hoops is having a moment, and, well... I don’t know what to expect moving forward. Does the new AD care about women’s hoops? Olympic sports in general? Who’s to say?\n- Hayley Frank graduated and will begin a career overseas in Germany. Abby Feit, the one-year transfer from Evansville, also exhausted her eligibility.\n- Mama Dembele and little-used bench player Sarah Linthacum announced their transfers and subsequent destinations (South Florida and Missouri State, respectively).\n- Offseason Additions: Nyah Wilson (New Mexico) | Laniah Randle (SIU-C) | Tilda Sjökvist (Presbyterian) | Tionna “Tree” Herron (Texas)\n- New freshmen: Ma’Riya Vincent (links to great feature from Dylan) | Londyn Oliphant, both from Texas\n- Angelique Ngalakulondi, who was injured pretty early in the season, has been granted a medical waiver and will return for a super senior season, it seems. De’Myla Brown, which the idiot NCAA (not sorry) didn’t grant a waiver to, sat out last year and will suit up. Averi Kroenke, who was injured the entirety of last season, also returns.\nYesterday at Rock M and Rock M+\nThe recent commitment of South Alabama linebacker Khalil Jacobs checks many boxes for Mizzou heading into the 2024 summer. Adding a coveted and experienced defensive player? Check. Beating out top-tier schools like Alabama and Ole Miss for a transfer? Check. But perhaps the biggest box the addition of Jacobs checks is solidifying a linebacker room that only a few weeks ago was one of the thinnest on the roster.\nBefore Jacobs’ commitment, the LB room was looking a bit thin, so Jacobs is a welcome addition.\nThere’s updates. Read ‘em.\n- Over at RockM.plus, there’s some hoops talk. There’s always hoops talk. Commenters are currently grading the portal haul, making some 2024-25 rotation expectations, and looking at some fun offseason projections\n- UPDATED: I went on a non-Rock M podcast to chat softball with some J-School grads (or one this time)!\nIn Case You Missed it\n- 2024 Missouri Football Opponent Previews: Buffalo Bulls by Nate Edwards\nAny time you have a coaching change you’re going to have higher turnover via portal, both from a “eff the new guy, I ain’t playing for him” and a “we’re doing things different here and you’re no longer a fit” type of vibes.\nEven with that caveat Buffalo got hit hard in the portal. Starting quarterback from the past three years? Gone to conference opponent Eastern Michigan. Running back #2? Off to New Mexico State. #1 tight end, best offensive lineman, and best havoc-creator at safety? All gone to P4 programs, and that’s on top of attrition via graduation.\nIt’s always a good idea to play one of the worst FBS programs on the planet.\nPer South Alabama Football, in 13 games last season — Jacobs had 25 solo tackles (56 total) with 8.5 TFLs, one interception, one pass deflection, and three forced fumbles. Remember, this was a South Alabama team that ranked 15th in the entire country in total defense last season.\nJacobs was heavily coveted, picking Mizzou over SEC schools Alabama, Auburn, and Ole Miss.\n- While at softball over the weekend, Mizzou WBB brought in a center, Texas transfer Tionna “Tree” Herron. She’s got a really inspirational story, and I encourage you to check out what Dylan Heinrich and I wrote.\nOriginally signed with Kentucky, Herron’s season was cut tragically short when, prior to arriving in Lexington, it was discovered that she had a structural abnormality involving her heart. She underwent successful open-heart surgery in August 2022\nAs the team rushed the field to envelop freshman Madison Walker who hit the walk-off stunner in the bottom of the 9th inning to secure Super Regional status, I had tears in my eyes. I know, I know, it’s not professional blah-blah-blah, but I couldn’t help it. I wanted this moment so badly for this team. With doubters everywhere, look what they did.\nTHEY DID THIS. REGIONAL CHAMPIONS.\nI wrote this earlier in the week. It’ll put you in the right headspace for Supers so have a read (again).\nOther Media I’m Consuming\n- ALL the softball content, of course: | No. 7 Seeded Softball to Face No. 10 Duke in 2024 NCAA Columbia Super Regional (MUTigers) | Recovered No. 7 Mizzou softball ready for power-hitting No. 10 Duke in NCAA super regional (Eli Hoff, St. Louis Post-Dispatch) | Keys for Missouri softball against strong Duke team in super regional (Calum McAndrew, Columbia Tribune) | How Missouri can take down Duke (Quentin Corpuel, MizzouCentral) | Duke softball faces Missouri in NCAA Super Regionals. Will Blue Devils pull an upset? (Jadyn Watson-Fisher, The Herald)\n- KOMU 8’s Ben Arnet’s Mizzou Xtra segment has a Supers preview as well as an interview with former Mizzou AD Mike Alden about this NCAA revenue sharing stuff.\n- The Athletic’s Jayna Bardahl wrote about the enormous Florida NIL lawsuit, but also identified some SEC dark horses. Mizzou fans will want to check this out.\n- I also really liked this from Eli: What does a 7th-ranked class of incoming transfers mean for Mizzou men’s basketball?\n- Big news on the Men’s Golf front: Mizzou is adding two All-A10 golfers to the roster, signing VCU’s Mattias Varjun and Veikka Viskari on Thursday!\n- Congratulating this new Mizzou Athletics Hall of Fame Class. Read about them at MUTigers.com.\n- NCAA, Power 5 agree to deal that will let schools pay players by ESPN’s Dan Murphy & Pete Thamel\nSources said the parties also have agreed to a revenue-sharing plan allowing each school to share up to roughly $20 million per year with its athletes.\nWow.\n- My takeaway: Coach needs to watch The Hunger Games\n- Under 100 days, friends!\n- 10/10.
