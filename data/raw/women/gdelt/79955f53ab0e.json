  "body_text": "The NHL Stanley Cup between the Florida Panthers from the Eastern Conference and the Edmonton Oilers from the Western Conference began on Wednesday night.\nThe quest for Lord Stanley began in Edmonton and what a series this one should be! I ask, does it look familiar to you? I say, it should because these two teams battled last year in the Stanley Cup Finals with Florida winning in seven games.\nI honestly see another potential seven game series with these two hockey teams. I think when you look at the series it’s about dead even to me. I give a slight nod to the Florida Panthers between the pipes. I still can’t trust the Edmonton goaltender Stuart Skinner. The good Skinner is good, however, when he goes bad, he really goes bad. The Edmonton Oilers will go as far as Skinner can hold off the Florida Panthers on the scoreboard. I would love to see Connor McDavid win a Stanley Cup mostly because he is such a great hockey player.\nThe Florida Panthers are looking to become just the 10th franchise in NHL history to win back-to-back Stanley Cups. The million-dollar question: Who wins the 2024-2025 Stanley Cup? The Fat Guy’s heart wants the Edmonton Oilers to win this Stanley Cup. However, something tells me the Florida Panthers are going to find a way to defeat the Edmonton Oilers. I like the Panthers in a grueling seven games to win and hoist the Stanley Cup on Edmonton’s home ice!\nThe NBA Finals are set and ready to go. The Western Conference is represented by the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Eastern Conference representative is the Indiana Pacers! I must ask, who had the Pacers winning the Eastern Conference? I doubt the number is very many to be truthful. I mean, everyone thought it would be the Celtics or Cavaliers just like I did.\nI think it will be a fun and entertaining series to watch, but I don’t give the Indiana Pacers much chance to win this series. The talent level of the OKC basketball team is superior to the Indiana Pacers team. I see the Thunder winning this series in five games! I can also tell you the games will be high scoring affairs and not too much defense. The first game will be Thursday night in Oklahoma City with an 8:30 p.m. tipoff.\nThe college baseball regionals are in full swing, and I have enjoyed watching all these college baseball games. I was shocked to see Wright State take out the number one seed Vanderbilt. I say, that is why they play the games between the chalk. I have also been watching the women play fastpitch softball, which I love to watch also. I love watching the men and women a lot when it becomes regional and super regional time.\nThe running of the Belmont Stakes is this weekend. I know the horse racing world is looking forward to Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty and Preakness winner Journalism going head-to-head in the Belmont Stakes. I would not be shocked if neither one of these horses won the race. I think Baeza is the horse to keep your eyes on personally. I say, if you’re looking for a long shot take a look at Rodriguez. The Fat Guy is going to pick Baeza to win and Journalism to run second. The question is: Will the Fat Guy go 3-0 in the Triple Crown races with his predictions?\nThe Detroit Tigers just continue to dazzle on the diamond. The Tigs went into Kansas City and took two of three games from the Royals. I found it incredible the two teams traded 1-0 victories. The Tigers Skubal pitched a gem, yet the Tigers lost 1-0. The Tigers returned the favor beating the Royals 1-0 the very next day on a wild pitch. The last time a team won a 1-0 nothing game on a wild pitch has been like 100 years ago. How about that!\nThe Lions Frank Ragnow announced his retirement from the NFL on Monday. I will gather my thoughts on this news and give you my thoughts next week on how this impacts the Detroit Lions football team.",
