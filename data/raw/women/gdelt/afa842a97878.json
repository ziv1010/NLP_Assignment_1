  "body_text": "To say that the Manchester City No 1 has had a turbulent start to this Women’s Super League (WSL) season would be an understatement.\nDespite starting 17 out of 22 WSL games for City last season, Ellie Roebuck is yet to play a single minute of this campaign. City manager Gareth Taylor has preferred 19-year-old Khiara Keating, who had a solid block of pre-season with her club while Roebuck was away with England at this summer’s World Cup.\nAdvertisement\nRoebuck’s last outing for City was against Manchester United on May 21, when she was sent off for a challenge on Nikita Parris.\nIn 10 games across all competitions this season, Roebuck has been on the bench on five occasions (against West Ham, Everton, Bristol City, Brighton and Leicester City) and has not been included in the squad on five occasions (against Chelsea, Leicester, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United).\nDuring her time in the stands, the England international has been spotted sitting beside the Football Association’s women’s football director Baroness Sue Campbell, watching on as Keating takes her place and Scotland international Sandy MacIver sits on the bench.\nRoebuck, 24, was called up for an England camp in October but this week Sarina Wiegman did not name the goalkeeper in her squad for two crucial Women’s Nations League fixtures. England must beat the Netherlands on December 1 and Scotland on December 5 if Team GB have any chance of qualifying for the Olympics in Paris next summer.\nTo go from Mary Earps’ replacement at the World Cup to not even taking one of three spots for December’s internationals is a huge blow for Roebuck.\nSo what’s gone on?\nIn response to questions regarding Roebuck’s absence on Friday, City manager Taylor said: “We have three really good goalkeepers (Roebuck, Keating and MacIver) and by putting all of them in the squad, it reduces an option that we potentially get outfield which we feel is unnecessary. It has always been two from three.\n“At the moment, Khiara (Keating) has done very well. She’s in control of the shirt. When you look at what she’s done this season with the players in front of her, we’ve got the best defensive record alongside Chelsea in the league. A large part of that is down to what Khiara has done.”\nWhen asked about whether it was possible for Roebuck to reclaim her starting position, Taylor said: “Of course, she can, yes. I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to go into detail about private conversations that I have with Ellie but she’s really clear on what she does well and what she needs to do in order to keep pushing Khiara and Sandy (MacIver).\nAdvertisement\n“We go game by game. We look at the opponent, we see what they bring in terms of the pressure and what type of goalkeeper we would need in those situations. All our goalkeepers are really different.”\nGO DEEPER\nTaylor signs Man City extension\nFor a goalkeeper of Roebuck’s calibre and experience, you would still expect her to start cup games, especially given that the Continental Tyres Cup is generally considered to be the least important silverware (below the WSL title and FA Cup) each year. But in the Continental Cup it was MacIver who played against Everton and Liverpool, while Keating returned on Wednesday against Leicester as City lost on penalties after a 2-2 draw.\nTaylor said Roebuck is being well-supported and has responded positively to losing the No 1 spot.\n“Obviously, she’s not going to be feeling so great because losing that status is going to be tough,” he added. “But I like what I have seen.\n“She’s been really positive, she’s communicating with everyone really well. We’re trying to give her the necessary support that we can so that she can get back to those levels that we were speaking about.”\nWiegman named only three goalkeepers this week: Earps (Manchester United), Hannah Hampton (Chelsea) and Keating. It’s something the England manager said was “very deliberate”.\nShe had picked four goalkeepers for the double-header against Belgium in October, having taken three (Earps, Roebuck and Hampton) to the World Cup.\nOn Tuesday, Wiegman said of Roebuck: “Of course, it’s very hard for her… We did have conversations. I had to give her the message that we didn’t pick her for now. She’s in a hard position. She just has to work and (see) if she can find opportunities. Right now, short-term, that’s probably not going to happen.”\nAn England squad without Roebuck is missing a key team player and much-needed experience on the bench. Roebuck has 11 caps for England, has appeared four times for Team GB and has played at elite level since signing for City in 2016. She won the FA Cup in 2019-20 and was part of the 2022 European Championship and 2023 Finalissima-winning squad.\nAdvertisement\nShould anything happen to No 1 Earps, the backup options will now be Keating, who has never played at international senior level, or Chelsea’s new signing Hampton, who has two caps for England.\nHampton, 23, is yet to play for Chelsea this season either, with manager Emma Hayes preferring either Sweden international Zecira Musovic or Germany international Ann-Katrin Berger. When asked if she had considered giving Hampton a runout in a competitive game, Hayes said: “No, I haven’t given it any thought”.\nGO DEEPER\nZecira Musovic: Who is the Sweden goalkeeper that helped knock USWNT out of the World Cup?\nIt’s a precarious position for Wiegman’s side to be in.\nRoebuck and Earps will also have built up a rapport over the years working closely together with England goalkeeper coach Darren Ward, and Earps may have benefitted from Roebuck’s presence on the training pitch.\nRoebuck will want to return to the England squad as quickly as possible and it seems the only way to do that is to get game time. Her contract is due to expire in the summer, so it is likely she will move to another club, in England or overseas, in January.\nResponding to these huge setbacks will require resilience. At 24, Roebuck will need to display professionalism and emotional maturity to look beyond the initial disappointment and frustration at her career having taken a very unexpected dip.\nGO DEEPER\nMary Earps' deadline-day dilemma\n(Top photo: Naomi Baker – The FA/The FA via Getty Images)",
