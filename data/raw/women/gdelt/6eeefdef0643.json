Or will City land a lethal blow to United's title aspirations?\nBBC Sport looks at some of the key storylines for this weekend's match.\nTop spot at stake for City\nIt may be early in the season but - with a host of teams neck and neck at the top of the table - dropping points now could still prove crucial.\nCity leapfrogged Chelsea at the summit last weekend, narrowly beating Everton after the six-time defending champions drew 1-1 with Arsenal.\nAsked about City's place at the top of the table, Jeglertz praised his team but said they are well aware there is still a large chunk of the season remaining.\n\"There is quite long [to go], but at the same time we show that when we are on the highest peak, we definitely are a very, very good football team,\" he said.\nUnited, meanwhile, failed to capitalise on Chelsea's stalemate as Marc Skinner's side fell to their first defeat of the season - a 1-0 home loss to Aston Villa.\nA second straight league defeat is likely to be extremely damaging to the Red Devils' title hopes, given it would mean they already trail City by seven points.\nWith their place at the top of the table at stake, City would do well to remember the lessons from last season.\nThey failed to win a single game against teams that finished above them, and rivals United took advantage to beat them to third - and claim the final Champions League spot by a point.\nCity-United crossover\nAll eyes are likely to be on the two players who crossed the city's divide during the transfer window, with Grace Clinton moving from United to City, while Jess Park went the other way.\nThe England duo have had mixed fortunes at their new clubs. While Park has flourished, Clinton's start to life at City has been hampered by injury.\nPark played in all but one of City's WSL games last season, but struggled to make a major impact.\nBut after eight matches for United she is already a key player for Skinner's side and has matched her goal involvements (six) from last season, with four goals and two assists.\nAsked if Park's recent performances made him wish City still had a player like her, Jeglertz replied: \"I'm not in a feeling or in a state where I think 'oh, we should have kept her'. No, that was not the case.\n\"I'm really happy for Jess Park. She needed a new environment, and she's in an environment now where she [can] show her best qualities.\"\nSkinner responded to Jeglertz's comments by saying: \"I'm actually buzzing he didn't want [to keep Park] because, for us, we have a little superstar.\"\nClinton, meanwhile, has made just two starts for City. She arrived carrying a slight niggle, and a minor injury that kept her out of October's England camp has slowed her progress.\nBut Jeglertz is positive the midfielder will get back to her best.\n\"The player that goes through injuries and a little bit of setbacks and so on, that makes them stronger,\" Jeglertz said.\n\"It will be the same for Grace when she, in a couple of months, has gone through this period of changing club and everything.\n\"She's going to be a much better football player and also be more resilient to setbacks because she has been there.\n\"She's a great player. She will be very important for the future.\"\nGoals galore?\nIf the start of the season is anything to go by, there should be goals aplenty on Saturday as City and United are the top scoring sides in the league so far, with 20 and 19 goals respectively.\nThey also have the league's leading goalscorers in Khadija Shaw and Melvine Malard, who have both found the back of the net five times.\nJamaica striker Shaw has benefited from Jeglertz's direct approach to attacking and scored City's winner against Everton on Sunday.\nMalard has already equalled her best WSL tally, while the France forward netted a stunning goal in United's Champions League win over Paris St-Germain at Old Trafford on Wednesday.\n\"Melvine is really at top of the game. So if I was a defender, I really wouldn't [want to] be playing against her right now,\" Skinner said on Friday.\n\"She's fluid, she's fluent, I've already spoken about her character and how it's very Manchester United.\"\nFrom Old Trafford to Etihad Stadium\nWith domestic men's football breaking up for an international window, plenty of clubs are using their main stadiums for WSL matches this weekend.\nCity will be keen to build on the momentum of United's mid-week Champions League game, which saw 14,667 fans inside Old Trafford.\nUnited have already sold out their travelling allocation of more than 3,000 tickets.\nThe last Manchester derby at the Etihad saw 22,497 fans watch on as Ella Toone starred in a thrilling 4-2 win for United.\nOn Thursday, WSL Football unveiled \"world-first design guidelines\" for updating existing stadiums - or building new ones - so they better cater for women, at a time when the women's game is growing.\nWhat's going on with falling WSL attendances?\n- Published9 June 2025",
