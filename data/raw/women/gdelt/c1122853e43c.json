Labour councillors said they were “shocked and appalled” by the figures, and called for more action from Bristol City Council to tackle violence against women and girls.\nThe latest quality of life survey found that nearly one in four people in Hartcliffe and Withywood held the belief, well above the citywide average. Also, over half of people in Lawrence Hill believe that sexual harassment is an issue in Bristol, the highest response across the city.\nThe figures reveal a wide gap between experiences, with richer areas reporting less of an issue than poorer areas. Council staff will now be given extra training on the issue, after a motion received support in a full council meeting on Tuesday, July 9.\nRead more: Hundreds of new student flats in industrial area in latest Bristol planning applications\nRead more: Greens admit they have no plans to tackle growing scourge of pavement parking\nLabour Councillor Kerry Bailes, who tabled the motion, said: “A statistic that has truly shocked me is that in Hartcliffe and Withywood, the quality of life survey found that the number of people who think domestic abuse is a private matter is 22.5 per cent, compared to 7.4 per cent across Bristol. That statistic is appalling, revealing and concerning.\n“Bristol is not just trendy high streets and leafy suburbs, but working class estates and left-behind communities. This issue affects all of our communities, but like so many issues, deprived communities get it worse.”\nThe plans include training all council staff and councillors on recognising the signs of domestic abuse and responding to disclosures of sexual and domestic violence. An update will be given to councillors every year on the work taking place to tackle violence against women and girls.\nLabour Cllr Lisa Durston added: “On the Saturday just gone, as so many of us were enjoying the quarter finals of the Euros, many women and children would have been at home isolated and afraid. Football doesn’t cause domestic abuse, but for those living in fear of domestic abuse at home, a major football tournament is a time when existing abuse can get worse.\n“Recent figures suggest that domestic abuse increased by 38 per cent when England lost a match, and 26 per cent when they won or drew. There were five reported rapes and 60 domestic violence incidents per day across Avon and Somerset. These numbers aren’t just statistics — they represent real lives shattered by violence.”\nShe added that the figures were likely under-representing the scale of violence, as many women choose not to report domestic and sexual violence to the police. The trauma of an attack can also often affect a victim for a long time after the incident.\nCllr Durston said: “A pyramid of violence exists where harmful beliefs and attitudes sit at the bottom, moving to street harassment and unwanted touching in the middle, and ending with extreme acts of violence and abuse at the top. These things are not unconnected.”\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, almost one in three women aged 16 to 59 will experience domestic abuse in their lifetime; two women a week in England and Wales are killed by a current or former partner; and over half a million women are raped or sexually assaulted each year. A YouGov poll shows a third of girls have experienced sexual harassment in schools.\nLabour received cross-party support for their motion. That means the council will now increase its work with police, community groups and schools on tackling violence against women and girls.\nGreen Cllr Shona Jemphrey said: “Every woman here will have faced abuse or harassment grounded in sexism. Everybody here will know someone who has been the victim of domestic abuse, whether they’ve told you about it or not.\n“And so to the men in the room: if the women in your lives tell you about abuse or harassment, believe them and support them. And if you hear other men making sexist jokes or comments, call them out on it.”",
