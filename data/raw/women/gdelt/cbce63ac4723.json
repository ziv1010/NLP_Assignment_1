She missed the 2023 season due to a knee injury but was still recognised as the Swans' best club person for her off-field leadership.\nShe returned in 2024, playing eight games, but an ankle injury in August put her out of the 2025 season just as she was preparing to play in the year's opening round.\nCollier said it has been a privilege to play in the red and white.\n\"I've supported this club since I was a kid, so to pull on the Swans guernsey was a real 'pinch me moment', and it was an incredible honour to be named co-captain in the first year,\" she said.\n\"When I look back, I've probably spent more time here in rehab than I have playing, but it has taught me so much about being a good club person and given me an appreciation for all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes.\"\nCollier also acknowledged those who have supported her.\n\"Being on this journey with the girls has been by far my favourite part. Their company and camaraderie will be the thing I'll miss the most, as it has been a pleasure to ride the highs and lows with them,\" she said.\nSydney Swans executive general manager, Amanda Turner, praised Collier's contributions.\n\"As an inaugural co-captain, Maddy has made a huge impact on our program and has been an important member of our squad since our women's team was established. Maddy epitomises what dedication and resilience look like,\" Turner said.\n\"On behalf of everyone at the club, I would like to thank Maddy for her valuable contribution and wish her all the best for the future.\"\nOver her 10-season career, Collier played 47 AFLW games across three clubs, including 13 with the Swans. In addition to her on-field achievements, she has been recognised for her leadership, resilience in the face of injury, and commitment to team culture.\n\"Being part of the Swans' journey has been an incredible privilege,\" Collier said.\n\"I'll cherish the memories, the friendships, and the highs and lows we've shared. Footy has given me so much, and I hope I've been able to give a little back in return.\"\nAs she steps away from elite football, Collier leaves a legacy of leadership, perseverance, and community spirit. Her influence on the football community and her inspiration for young players will be felt for years to come.",
