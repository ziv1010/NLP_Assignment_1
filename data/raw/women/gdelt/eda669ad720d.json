Against Spain, Jess Park bundled the ball over the line to score the decisive goal as the hosts then held on for a much-needed victory.\nWhile the next game is always the most important and the Nations League holds its own significance, there is no escaping the looming Euro 2025 in Switzerland, and England's need to defend their title. It's been a challenging period for the Lionesses since their World Cup final defeat in 2023, and they are yet to rediscover the form that served them so well in 2022.\nWhether it's injuries, ageing players, or tactical frustrations, there is a lot to address in just four months. However, if England can resolve some of their glaring issues and ease some growing concerns, they will put themselves in a fantastic position to take the rest of Europe by storm in July.\nHere, 90min looks at three key questions Wiegman must address before their opening group game against France this summer.\nThe right-back conundrum\nIt cannot be overstated just how important Lucy Bronze is to England, and her outstanding assist for Alessia Russo's goal against Portugal served as the latest reminder of exactly what she offers going forward. Her half-time substitution and subsequent second-half display was also another wake-up call as to how much the team struggles without her.\nAt 33, it is fair to say time is not on the Chelsea defender's side. Sooner rather than later, there will need to be a serious discussion about Bronze’s successor, and at the moment, that answer remains unclear.\nAt the very least, barring any serious injuries, England fans will get to enjoy another major tournament with Bronze as a focal point this summer. The World Cup in 2027 is not out of the question, but given she will be 35, it is a lot less certain.\nManaging minutes, even at the Euros this summer, could be crucial to Bronze's longevity. Wiegman has already hinted as much with her half-time change against Portugal, refusing to take any risks with one of her most important players.\nWho steps into that role when Bronze is not on the pitch is crucial. Jess Carter was given the responsibility against Portugal, but it's fair to say the balance of the team was not quite right, and their attacking threat down that flank suffered as a result.\nWithin the current setup, Maya Le Tissier is the obvious choice. But given she plays her club football with Manchester United at centre-back, she may be better suited elsewhere in the long-term. In England's youth ranks, 20-year-old Naomi Layzell is emerging as a top talent following her summer move to Manchester City, but she may not be ready to make the step up to the senior side in the immediate future.\nFirepower from the bench\nOne of England's greatest strengths at the Euros in 2022 was their ability to change games from the bench. Ella Toone and Russo were the go-to super subs, while Chloe Kelly also earned plaudits for her winning goal in the final against Germany.\nIn more recent times, Wiegman has seemingly grown reluctant to trust her options on the bench and has been accused of making changes too late in games. When fresh legs are brought on, their impact is minimal, which arguably only exacerbates the manager's desire to stick with her starting lineup.\nThe Spain victory hinted the tide could be turning as Nikita Parris and Kelly were brought on just after the hour mark. While England had lost their spark going forward and were absorbing pressure from their opponents, the fresh legs and defensive work rate from the substitutions were crucial to Wiegman's side getting over the line.\nOnce injuries ease and the likes of Beth Mead and Lauren Hemp return to the fold, England's options will be greater. But, it goes without saying, England desperately need to rediscover their magic touch from the bench if they're to have any hope of defending their title as European champions.\nEven without Mead and Hemp, Wiegman still boasts match-winners throughout her squad when considering their contributions at club level. However, it's down to those players to grasp the opportunity when it comes and produce match-defining moments.\nGeorgia Stanway alternatives\nOne of the big question marks ahead of the Euros is whether midfielder Georgia Stanway will be fit enough to feature. The Bayern Munich star underwent knee surgery at the end of last month and faces a race against time to return to action.\nIn the statement her club released confirming the news, they revealed she is expected to be out for at least several months. However, the England camp remains optimistic she'll be ready in time to play.\nThat being said, even if she does make it, she'll have missed almost the entirety of the second half of the season and will be lacking in both form and fitness. It is crucial Wiegman uses the Nations League campaign to finalise her best midfield without Stanway, to combat her absence if that's the case.\nToone will keep her place, while both Park and Grace Clinton have risen up the pecking order over the last 12 months. Both were given the nod against Portugal last week and Spain on Wednesday, and the upcoming tests in the Nations League before the end of the season will undoubtedly determine whether they are ready to star for England on the big stage.\nAs an outside shout, both Ruby Mace and Laura Blindkilde Brown, who have big futures with the national team, have been included in the last two squads and made their debuts before Christmas against Switzerland. Mace, in particular, continues to impress in a deeper midfield role at Leicester City and could be a solid option ahead of the Euros.",
