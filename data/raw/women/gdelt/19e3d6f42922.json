  "body_text": "BEST of UTAH 2024\nYou voted, we listened. Unveiling the 464 awarded categories for all things UTAH\nThe art of origami—of turning a flat sheet of paper into imaginative sculptures using folding techniques—has been around since approximately the 7th century, following the introduction of paper to Japan from China. Ceremonial origami for religious purposes came first, with recreational origami developing by about the 16th century.\nSo the concept has been around for a while.\nWhile City Weekly's Best of Utah issue can hardly claim to have a comparable history, celebrating your favorites in Utah living has been an annual tradition since the issue's inauguration on Jan. 16, 1990. (And for an independent paper in this national landscape, that's nothing to sniff at!) Even so, the spirit of the issue's overall mission is at least as old as the advent of paper, if not older.\nTo recognize the highlights (and lowlights) of our shared space is part of community living, something that gets lost when we live lives of self-involved detachment. Thankfully, each year that we do Best of Utah, the varied beauties and delights of our city and state come into greatest focus through you, the readers. With roughly 207,000 total votes cast for our 464 categories, you show us that each colorful variation, each bend and curve accomplished across our state creates an imaginative, ever-changing sculpture out of what could be a flat, featureless expanse.\nPaper, that compacted web of fibers, is a remarkably flexible medium and can be used both to convey ideas of profound meaning as well as serve the most commonplace of functions.\nNevertheless, whether for recreation, ceremony or anything in between, it remains an organic whole—not unlike the healthiest communities.\nThe selections you have chosen this year illustrate all of the above uses, providing Utah the folds and dimensions it vitally needs to become a work of art.\n—Wes Long, Contributing Editor\nBest Community Advocate Troy Williams Equality Utah executive director Troy Williams is a force to be reckoned with on Capitol Hill, boasting a success record that most advocates for progressive causes can only dream of achieving in the bright-red Beehive State. His past experience as a young foot soldier for the ultra-conservative (and ultra-organized) Eagle Forum clearly taught Williams the dark arts of Utah politics, which he now employs expertly to make everyone's lives better, one victory at a time. 2. Tara Lipsyncki 3. Jennifer Plumb\nBest Advocacy Organization Planned Parenthood Persistence can be a throwaway term at times, and it can be tricky to come by a person or organization who truly embodies the painstaking effort it takes to persist continually. Planned Parenthood Action Council Of Utah fits the bill wholeheartedly and without exaggeration. What's more: they don't just persist in the face of adversity, they lift others up and bring them along, providing protection, equity, resources and more to boot! plannedparenthoodaction.org 2. Equality Utah 3. Encircle\nBest Columnist Robert Gehrke, The Salt Lake Tribune If you've ever been lucky enough to tip a pint with the Trib's Robert Gehrke, you know that he's a good conversationalist about topics hither and yon: sports, movies, etc. At the Tribune, of course, he's a go-to read for local and statewide politics, the beat that's built his reputation as a tough-but-fair reporter, adept at data-driven work and shoe-leather reportage. He's also a readable, relatable writer, a true multi-threat. 2. Eli McCann, The Salt Lake Tribune 3. Gordon Monson, The Salt Lake Tribune\nBest Conservative Mitt Romney It's tempting to see this award as a win by default, as Mitt Romney was one of the only Republicans smart enough to exit the MAGA bus before Donald Trump drove it off of a cliff. But let it be remembered that amid the performative chaos of modern politics, Romney kept busy doing the work—building coalitions, negotiating worthwhile legislation and avoiding the TV cameras. The Senate could do with a few more members like him. 2. Becky Edwards 3. John Dougall\nBest Elected Official Mayor Erin Mendenhall, Salt Lake City Sure, winning reelection to the mayor's office by a 24-point margin is pretty cool. But even more impressive is Erin Mendenhall's four consecutive years as City Weekly readers' favorite local politician. After a particularly turbulent first term, Mendenhall is wasting no time using her second spin in the mayoral chair to position Utah's capital city for a brighter future—one with more parks, vibrancy, neighbors and opportunity, plus a second date with the Olympic Winter Games. 2. Mitt Romney 3. Jenny Wilson\nBest Former Utahn John Stockton A legendary, long-celebrated basketball player, John Stockton helped make the Utah Jazz what it is today with his incredible skills as a point guard. Largely regarded as one of the most skilled point guards the NBA has seen, Stockton holds the all-time record for steals and assists. He now resides in Spokane, Washington, but Utah will never forget the lasting impression he made here. 2. Nathan Chen 3. Lex Scott\nBest Internet Troll Gov. Spencer Cox The Trump era of Republican politics has seen a number of former statesmen devolve into angry, petulant children online. But few have fallen as far as fast as Gov. Spencer Cox, who in a few short years morphed from a plucky, broadly-supported centrist into a divisive, tone-deaf regurgitator of hard-right culture war bile. Here's hoping Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson can hang on to her soul if she gets promoted to the big chair. X: @spencerjcox 2. Todd Weiler 3. Natalie Cline\nBest Local Podcast City Cast Salt Lake While tied to an aural approach to storytelling, the folks behind this operation understand modern media consumption and the range of material listeners are prepared to tackle in a given sitting. Myriad stories abound, from breezy lifestyle features to local reporting to conversations with Utah's notable tastemakers. From bite-sized reads to longer listens, City Cast offers a range of topics as wide and varied as the people who call this community home. saltlake.citycast.fm 2. Mormon Stories 3. Girls Camp Podcast\nBest Local TV Lifestyle/Talk Show Good Things Utah, ABC4 In a world often full of bad news, it's a pleasure to tune into Good Things Utah for feel-good Utah entertainment. From recipes to recommendations to inspiring stories, hosts Nicea DeGering, Surae Chinn and Deena Manzanares know how to create an engaging show full of warmth. You don't need to look further than Good Things Utah for a quick way to brighten your day. abc4.com/gtu 2. Fox 13's The Place, KSTU 3. Studio 5, KSL-TV\nBest Mixed-Use Space in Which to Live/Work/Play Maven District Owned and run by women, with 85% occupancy by women-owned businesses, the Maven District is the place where boss babes gather. There is so much to love about this area of town, from the walkable community to the short- and long-term housing rentals offered at Maven Stay; you can come for an hour or for days. mavendistrict.com 2. The Junction 3. Sugar Space Arts Warehouse\nBest Non-Profit Organization Planned Parenthood Salt Lake Health Center Opened in 1964—but not without challenges. In the 1990s and 2000s, varied legislative efforts sought to impose stricter regulations on clinics. The 2010s brought renewed scrutiny, and in 2015, a national push to defund the organization was spurred by misleading videos targeting them. Despite these challenges, Planned Parenthood fought back, mobilizing community support and advocating for reproductive rights. We thank you, for all you do for our community. plannedparenthood.org 2. Best Friends Animal Society 3. Utah Food Bank\nBest Piece of Legislation HB560 (Abortion Licensing Modifications) Some Utah lawmakers would sooner die than respect women's freedom and bodily autonomy. So it was poetic watching them frantically repeal a ban on abortion clinics in order to avoid a court entanglement that could have jeopardized their broader effort to impose a near-universal ban on abortion procedures. The courts are still sorting through the mess and the war is far from won, but at least the hardliners got a taste of humble pie. 2. HB130 (Animal Fighting Penalties) 3. SB272 (Downtown Revitalization Zone)\nBest Political Controversy Natalie Cline loses her seat on the Utah Board of Education After four years of constant controversy and embarrassment, Natalie Cline finally learned that there is a limit to what Utahns will stomach from their elected state school board members when her virulently anti-transgender bigotry led her to erroneously bully a high school student. A tidal wave of criticism from everyone in the political food chain crashed down on Cline's head, and even the famously archconservative GOP delegates voted to show her the door. 2. LDS church not supporting mandatory reporting of child abuse 3. Gov. Spencer Cox endorses Donald Trump\nBest Political Social-Media Influencer Ben Winslow Most of us can't attend the Legislature's every special session or the Utah Supreme Court's every hearing. Thankfully, Ben Winslow does it for us. His live reporting on platforms like Threads makes even the densest of political wars accessible to the public. He's the go-to for on-the-spot news. Or, if you're looking for something a little more lighthearted—like a local spotlight or relatable meme—he's got you there, too. Threads: @benwinslow 2. Rosie Card 3. Eli McCann\nBest Politician: Over the Hill Mitt Romney Incumbents typically hold onto their seats until their lifeless corpses have to be pried off with a spatula. That was true of the man Mitt Romney replaced in the Senate, but won't be true of Romney, as the broadly popular and increasingly isolated moderate has decided six years is plenty to be stuck next to Mike Lee. For working across the aisle and getting out before he became the villain, we say \"thank you.\" 2. Joel Briscoe 3. Burgess Owens\nBest Politician: Up and Coming Caroline Gleich Caroline Gleich has summited Mount Everest with a torn ACL, but she recently faced her biggest challenge yet: running for U.S. Senate as a Democrat in Utah. Gleich has long been an outdoor enthusiast with a passion for environmental advocacy. Now, she's taking her advocacy to a new level as she heads into politics. Given her exceptional accomplishments in outdoor recreation, we can only anticipate what she'll accomplish on this new journey. IG: @carolinegleich 2. Nate Blouin 3. Natalie Pinkney\nBest Progressive Luz Escamilla The goal of progressivism is to make everyone's life better. Seems simple enough, but it's a big job, made even more impressive by Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla's willingness to leave no stone unturned to solve Utahns' problems. Regardless of ideology, she works to solve issues like affordable healthcare, housing, quality education and speaking up for those of who do not always have a voice in Utah's overwhelmingly white, male political world. facebook.com/Luzforutah 2. Jennifer Plumb 3. Grant Miller\nBest Radical Rae Duckworth, Black Lives Matter Utah Since 2021, Rae Duckworth has headed up Black Lives Matter Utah, with her work fueled, in large part, by the 2019 police shooting of her cousin Bobby Duckworth in Carbon County. Since then, her voice has been heard in the digital space and newspaper pages, at protests and in courtrooms, in the ears of local media, the SLC Police Department and the office of Mayor Erin Mendenhall. linktr.ee/RaeQuackk 2. Phil Lyman 3. Denise Weaver\nBest Radio Show Radio From Hell, X96-KXRK What can we say about Radio From Hell? Dominant in this award category since Bill Allred, Gina Barberi and Kerry Jackson came into their own in the mid '90s, the reigning champions have practically owned our readership's vote ever since. They are one of the few local shows that doesn't feel like a pre-programmed morning zoo. Let's be honest, whenever the show comes to an end, we're probably renaming this award after them. X96.com 2. Radio West, KUER 90.1 3. RadioACTive, KRCL 90.9\nBest Rally Utah Pride Rally and March You can't overstate the amazement a newbie to Utah feels when attending their first Utah Pride Rally and March. The state's cultural and political history might suggest a small, scrappy gathering, but what Salt Lake is treated to every June is a massive celebration of LGBTQ culture, with a parade that stretches for miles and thousands of folks gathered and bringing their cheerful, positive vibes to the already-amped participants. Truly a beautiful day. utahpride.org 2. Rally To Save Great Salt Lake 3. Rally For Palestine\nBest TV Anchor Kerri Cronk, Fox 13 KSTU It's a bittersweet send-off acknowledging Kerri Cronk as Utah's best TV anchor. After three decades at Fox 13—and two decades as a Good Morning Utah anchor—Cronk recently left Fox 13 to pursue new adventures in Australia. We'll all miss Cronk's humor, personality and radiant energy on our morning news, but we wish her the best in this new chapter. 2. Mary Nickles, KUTV 2 3. Heidi Hatch, KUTV 2\nBest Radio Station X96-KXRK Serving as the longest-running alternative music station in the state, X96 has morphed over the years to where they are currently: a mix of classic hits and a defiant source of rock music, as well as newer tunes from those trying to redefine the genre. Few others have earned the loyalty of their listeners to blast Nirvana followed by Dexter and The Moonrocks out of their stereo daily. X96.com 2. KUER 90.1 3. KRCL 90.9\nBest Reporter: Print/Digital Peggy Fletcher Stack, The Salt Lake Tribune Covering the LDS church is as tricky a media job as there can be in this market, and Peggy does it with a grace and kindness that is truly admirable. Her recent articles exploring strategies for bridging the gap between members and nonmembers stands as a testament to her ability to encourage both sides to evaluate where they stand and search for where new lines of communication could be established. sltrib.com/staff/pstack 2. Courtney Tanner, The Salt Lake Tribune 3. Jessica Miller, The Salt Lake Tribune\nBest Reporter: Radio Doug Fabrizio, KUER 90.1 Almost every NPR station across America has that one local reporter who has become a guiding voice for news you need to know about. For Utah, that voice is Doug Fabrizio, who has hosted RadioWest for decades covering all things politics, human interest and entertainment—not to mention interviews with iconic or controversial public figures. Regardless of the topic, when you hear him say \"this is RadioWest,\" you know you're in for something special. KUER.org 2. Lara Jones, KRCL 90.9 3. Lindsay Aerts, KSL News Radio\nBest Reporter: Sports, all media Andy Larsen, The Salt Lake Tribune Andy Larsen has had his ear to the rail on all things Utah Jazz since he took over the beat in 2013. From drama-filled off-seasons regarding Gordon Hayward, Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert, Andy has had Jazz fans covered from the jump. And with the arrival of the Utah Hockey Club, Andy has been providing coverage on the exciting new venture as the Beehive State adds another professional sport to the mix. sltrib.com/staff/alarsen 2. Wesley Ruff, KTVX-ABC4 3. Andrea Urban, KSTU-Fox 13\nBest Reporter: TV Ben Winslow, Fox 13 In his fourth consecutive win (and several more non-consecutive ones), Ben Winslow has once again proven himself to be among Utah's most reliable and thorough reporters. From breaking down Utah's murky and confusing (perhaps frustrating) political landscape to giving his audience live, on-the-scene coverage of Utah events, this dedicated, knowledgeable, award-winning journalist is a force to be reckoned with. fox13now.com/ben-winslow 2. Mary Nickles, KUTV 2 3. Lindsay Aerts, KSL-TV\nBest Social Cause Protecting Abortion Access in Utah Two years after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, we're still watching as overzealous lawmakers attempt to strip Utahns of abortion access. The Legislature's attempt at a near-total abortion ban is on hold, for now, thanks to the Utah Supreme Court. Maybe they'll use the new free time to help Utah's homeless population or help the Great Salt Lake ... probably not. 2. Save the Great Salt Lake 3. Free Palestine\nBest TV News Station Fox 13 KSTU In a time when TV news stations seem to be turning their studios into a generic green screen for national headlines, Fox 13 remains a dedicated source of local coverage. The station offers 10 hours of news every weekday, including their 9 p.m. broadcast for those who would rather be somewhere else at 10. It's nice to have a station getting you local news instead of a PowerPoint presentation. Fox13Now.com 2. KUTV 2 3. KSL-TV\nBest Utah Athlete Cameron Rising It's hard to think about the Utah Utes' football success without thinking of Cameron Rising. His grit, leadership and commitment to the game have earned him a reputation as a stand-out athlete, not to mention a roaring fanbase. Though injuries have taken him out of the game in the last year, his unwavering commitment to his team has stood strong and earned him the title of Best Utah Athlete. IG: @crising7 2. Caroline Gleich 3. Tony Finau\nBest Utah Swear Word \"Mike Lee\" It is correct that the ultimate swear word begins with \"Mike\" and ends with \"Lee.\" It is not the actual word that is offensive, but the concepts it expresses. Concepts such as being on the wrong side of history, always. Many great swear words end with a \"K,\" but lack a certain je ne sais quoi. \"Mike Lee\" is in a class by itself. Try it next time you stub your toe in polite company. 2. \"Oh My Heck\" 3. \"Frick\"\nBest Utahn Post Malone Austin, aka \"Posty,\" was born in New York but grew up in Texas. His versatile music is a wild mix of country, grunge, hip hop and R&B. We're totally vibing with his choice to call Utah home. His genuine heart is undeniable, and we're here for it with open arms. IG: @postmalone 2. Jeff, the bike speaker guy 3. Jennifer Plumb\nBest Weathercaster Chase Thomason, KUTV 2 Chase Thomason uses his love and knowledge of Utah and weather to provide up-to-date information on some of the scariest news. This social-media-savvy weathercaster is always willing to answer questions and interacts with Utahns with kindness. His passion and excitement for the way the world works is invigorating and his résumé as a storm chaser in the heart of tornado alley proves his value to his native state. kutv.com/contact/people/chase-thomason 2.

Kevin Eubank, KSL-TV\nMost Underreported Utah Story Drag Story Hour Bomb Threats Last fall, The King's English was evacuated after they received a bomb threat, canceling the day's all-ages drag storytime event. The following spring, a similar scene unfolded in Provo when Mosaics Community Bookstore & Venue canceled their monthly drag story hour after receiving bomb threats. The threats are unfortunately a reflection of a larger national trend. Apparently reading stories to kids has become too radical. 2. Utah Supreme Court case on political district gerrymandering 3. Redwood Swap Meet & Drive-In redevelopment\nWorst Use of Public Funds Transgender Bathroom Monitoring Utah lawmakers were so committed to their bigotry that—on top of regulating which bathrooms folks can use—they created a forum for tattle-telling and forced the Utah State Auditor to devote time and resources to policing a deluge of complaints, many of which were from trolls intentionally gumming up the gears. For everyone not consumed by delusional paranoia: mind your own damn business and remember to wash your hands. Problem solved. 2. Paying Mike Lee's Senate salary 3. Diverting education funding to charter schools\nWorst Utahn Sen. Mike Lee For someone who claims to be a constitutional lawyer, it's surprising how evidence mounts every day that Mike Lee—Utah's senior senator—was part of a coup against the government, attacking the sanctity of the Constitution and our elections. He would call that \"based,\" though. Every six years we send him to Washington and every term he fails to do anything substantial for Utah. It's no wonder he's a perennial candidate for Worst Utahn; he's the worst. 2. Gov. Spencer Cox 3. Tim Ballard\nBest Bridge Builders Smith Entertainment Group The modern Salt Palace is problematic, built upon the decimation of Japantown and exiling the Depot District from the rest of downtown. But while the problems are no secret, there was little effort to fix them until the Smith Entertainment Group pitched a comprehensive rebuild that would include the Delta Center by burying 300 West. Reasonable minds can disagree on the particulars of the deal, but there's no denying that current conditions require change.\nBest Excuse to Stop Driving Ebike Voucher Lottery \"Car culture\" is heavily subsidized, charging taxpayers so individual drivers can speed down highways, park in oversized lots, pollute the environment and, of course, kill nearly 300 Utahns per year. With ebike vouchers effectively paying for themselves, it's a no-brainer to use incentives to get folks out of their gas-guzzlers and onto a safe, efficient and sustainable vehicle. SLC's first batch got snatched up immediately, proving we can afford to go even further next time.\nBest Made-Up Controversy Redevelopment of the Redwood Drive-In Preservationists tipped into self-parody when they rallied the troops to fight a proposed redevelopment of the old drive-In theater on Redwood Road, which currently hosts a popular weekend swap meet on vast expanses of open, sunswept asphalt. The privately-owned site is pitch perfect for mixed-use housing and no amount of nostalgia will save the drive-in business model. If the swap meet can find another parking lot to occupy, it will be better off as well.\nBest Monthly Potluck The Wisdom Keepers Meeting on the second Saturday of every month at Salt Lake City's Urban Indian Center, this group of American Indian/Alaska Native Elders has been providing a welcoming space for urban Natives for years now. Between the events they plan and the food they bring (plus no small amount of laughter along the way), there is genuine community to be enjoyed here, whatever your tribe. uicsl.org/about-us/wisdom-keepers\nBest NIMBY The 15th and 15th backyard concert buster For years, the good people of 15th and 15th have come together on summer evenings to nurture connection through food and song. But one neighborhood grinch brought the good vibes to a screeching halt by complaining to zoning enforcement. The city ultimately backed down and said the concerts can continue, but the ordeal makes clear that for some Salt Lakers, building community matters far less than always having a parking space on the public curb.\nBest Online Social Conscience Kenny Akers In May 2020, hundreds of Utahns gathered in Salt Lake City after the death of George Floyd, later judged to be murder, at the hands of Minneapolis police. What began as a peaceful moment devolved into incendiary riots. It was Akers, a military veteran, who stood down looters, creating a moment that launched him into social media celebrity. He skillfully employs a calm and proactive voice to challenge misperceptions about modern Black activism. poplme.co/kennyakers\nBest Reality Check Utah Supreme Court voids Amendment D Utah lawmakers f--ked around and found out. Voters want independent redistricting, but the legislative supermajority was committed to partisan gerrymandering, leading the courts to enshrine the constitutional right of the citizenry to reform government. So lawmakers doubled down, inventing an \"emergency\" and sloppily placing a constitutional amendment on the ballot shrouded in deception and lies. Another lawsuit and another loss later, the Legislature is licking its wounds and plotting revenge against democracy.\nBest Video Production by Youth Media Spy Hop's Phase 2 Phase 2's unique video services harness the experience of talented Spy Hop alumni, who bring their advanced skills and fresh perspectives to every project. With a commitment to producing high-quality, impactful videos through mentorship and community stewardship, this dynamic team ensures that each project is delivered with exceptional artistry. phase2productions.com\nBest Voice for Downwinders Mary Dickson We've known Mary since our Private Eye days, but it's in the cause of justice for the victims of nuclear testing (\"downwinders\") that Dickson's works hit closest to home. A downwinder and cancer survivor, Dickson has been a consistent voice for the rights of those affected by the spread of radiation—a category encompassing every last one of us. Now that Congress has allowed downwinder compensation efforts to lapse, we need her now more than ever.\nBest Vote of Confidence Salt Lake County Council endorses the Rio Grande Plan There's no time machine to undo Utah's transportation mistakes, but that doesn't mean we have to live with them forever. Salt Lake City's leaders have flirted with the citizen-led idea of burying the railroad and restoring the Rio Grande Depot, but it took the County Council to give it formal backing. With that endorsement vote, entities like the Wasatch Front Regional Council and Utah Department of Transportation are compelled to give the plan a closer look.\nBest Art Gallery Urban Arts Gallery Year after year, Utah Arts Alliance's Urban Arts Gallery presents themed shows with unique, engaging work that might not fit within your typical gallery framework. Whether it's the fan art of the Star Wars Heroes & Villains show, the SLC Queer show celebrating Pride Month or the annual Skate Deck show, the gallery makes the act of viewing art both fun and fascinating as it showcases a wide range of local creators. urbanartsgallery.org 2. Springville Museum of Art 3. Utah Museum of Fine Arts\nBest Arts & Crafts Studio Art Haus \"We believe that everybody has artistic talent\" reads Art Haus's mission statement, and they certainly put that principle into action as a space with daily classes for every age and creative interest. Bring in children to learn about pottery, painting, drawing or cartooning, or as an adult, take those on yourself. Themed workshop classes also offer a chance to fine-tune those skills in unique ways. It's time to unlock your inner artist. arthaus-slc.com 2. Salt Lake Pottery Studio 3. Workshop SLC\nBest Arts Nonprofit Salt Lake Film Society Locals know the Salt Lake Film Society best from its film programming at the Broadway Centre Cinemas, from first-run theatrical releases to themed programming like the annual \"Tower of Terror\" and \"Summer Showdown\" series. But it's also a resource supporting filmmakers, as was demonstrated by the Oscar-nominated Ninety-Five Senses, an offshoot of the Media Accelerator Studio (MAST) program's \"Voices Seen\" animation contest. SLFS doesn't just show great filmmaking; it helps to create it. slfs.org 2. Utah Arts Alliance 3. Salt Lake Acting Company\nBest Classical Music/Opera Performance Utah Symphony, Danny Elfman's Percussion Concerto Composer Danny Elfman's career has been fascinatingly diverse, from his years as Oingo Boingo frontman to his film scores for Batman, Spider-man, Beetlejuice and more. He continued to expand his horizons with the 2022 premiere of his Percussion Concerto, incorporating what he described as his \"lifelong obsession\" with percussion. And local audiences responded enthusiastically to the premiere of the work with Utah Symphony in 2024 with percussionist Colin Currie, for whom the work was written. utahsymphony.org 2.

The stunning backdrop of Utah's gorgeous landscape never gets old, and it's even better when you have music from your favorite bands going at the same time. Even better, you can bring your whole family to enjoy the fresh air and fun times, so no one has to miss out because they're a young'un. redbuttegarden.org 2. Kilby Court 3.

The building is fascinating to look at inside and out, and once you're seated, there's always the promise of top-notch performances. You'll be singing praises for everything from the acoustics to the cozy seats, right down to the lighting. There's a great variety of shows here as well; you can catch the symphony one night and then a comedy act another. saltlakecountyarts.org 2. The Depot 3. Eccles Theater\nBest Concert Venue: Indoor Under 500 Capacity The State Room The State Room bills itself as \"Salt Lake's favorite live music venue,\" and that's obviously not far from the truth, because here it is in our very own list!

There's nothing quite like seeing a performer you love up close, and getting to have an experience you'll never forget. thestateroompresents.com 2. Soundwell 3. Metro Music Hall\nBest Concert Venue: Outdoor Red Butte Garden Amphitheatre Red Butte is back again in another category, because it sure is hard to beat. There are few places where you can experience the good weather, great music and gorgeous plant life with friends and family, but that's why we're lucky to have the Red Butte Amphitheatre and its annual summer lineup of some of the best touring acts in the world. redbuttegarden.org 2. Sandy Amphitheater 3. Utah First Credit Union Amphitheatre\nBest Concert of the Past Year Noah Kahan @ Utah First Credit Union Amphitheatre Back in July, singer/songwriter Noah Kahan sold out the Utah First Credit Union amphitheater, bringing his vulnerable lyrics and unfiltered yet relatable honesty to the stage. His blend of folk, Americana and rock has continued to blow listeners away, especially at this show. Kahan's summer tour was unforgettable, and those who went to this show are still buzzing about it as we close out 2024. 2. Depeche Mode @ The Delta Center 3. ISOxo @ Boxpac\nBest Friend of the Arts Bruce Bastian The Utah arts community—and the community at large—lost a giant in June 2024 with the passing of Bruce Bastian. The WordPerfect co-founder and philanthropist's B.W. Bastian Foundation supported dozens of local arts organizations including Ballet West, Utah Symphony, Plan-B Theatre Company and many more, contributing to the vitality and diversity of creative voices in Utah. His work continues through the foundation, but he'll be truly missed. 2. Jonathan King 3. Kate Ruefner\nBest Cultural Event SLC Pride The community has spoken: This event had a wonderful community vibe, with volunteers, performers, artisans and patrons all showcasing their independence and queerness. It had that laid-back, farmers' market atmosphere—local and authentic—allowing grassroots entities to shine. The indoor, air-conditioned spaces for neuro-spicy youth were absolutely on fire! The overall vibe and affordability were fantastic. People loved getting to see all the local performers and the all-ages drag show. High five to SLC Pride. SLC-Pride.org 2. Utah Arts Festival 3. Living Traditions\nBest Dance Company Ballet West In every possible way, the 60th anniversary 2023-2024 season of Ballet West was a triumph. From the record-breaking, season-opening production of Dracula through the highest-grossing-ever run of The Nutcracker and the magical The Firebird, the company kept delivering productions that audiences loved. The result has been a growing subscriber base and operating budget, matching the creative highs that Adam Sklute and the company dancers keep delivering year after year. balletwest.org 2. Ririe-Woodbury Dance Company 3. University of Utah Tanner Dance\nBest Drag Performer Sequoia Drag is an art—don't let anyone tell you any different. And thus, drag is most enjoyable when presented not just by a performer, but by an artist. Sequoia understands that, and then some. With enviable makeup, hair and costuming, it's easy to understand why Sequoia is a star. Yet, what truly sets her apart is her outstanding vocal range and inimitable charisma and stage presence. There's a reason her Instagram handle is theonlysequoia, after all. 2. Tara Lipsyncki 3. Hoe Shi Minh\nBest Haunted House Fear Factory Standing like a beacon of all things horror as you drive downtown on I-15, Fear Factory has become the iconic hub for Halloween attractions in Utah. The former cement factory-turned-fright festival spans six buildings with a variety of jump-scares and costumed freaks ready to scare you for a night or, if you're so inclined, with a season pass. Thirteen years since opening, they thrive as a pillar of terror for those looking for a thrill. fearfactoryslc.com 2. Nightmare on 13th 3. Asylum 49\nBest Local Author Brandon Sanderson Over nearly 20 years, Brandon Sanderson has built the kind of career that most writers would kill for. His skills at creating fantasy universes have been evident through his Cosmere sagas in Mistborn and The Stormlight Archive, even as he has continued universes created by others, like Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. It's no wonder he's built the kind of fan base that would support a Kickstarter campaign to the tune of $41 million. brandonsanderson.com 2. Terry Tempest Williams 3. Shannon Hale\nBest Local Band The Backseat Lovers The Backseat Lovers encapsulate everything there is to love about indie music: songs dripping with charm and local references; endearing performances; and an unwavering love for their fanbase. Songs like \"Kilby Girl\" and \"Maple Syrup\" put them on the map, and hopefully there's more on the horizon from the delightful Backseat Lovers. thebackseatlovers.com 2.

This local spot has been around since 1968, and in that time it has truly honed its calzone craft. The Pizza Bender is an excellent specimen even at its most basic composition, but it really takes off when you get creative with their pizza toppings. italianvillageslc.com 2. The Pie Pizzeria 3.
