We've just won the [National Women's Soccer League] shield there, which is massive,\" van Egmond said.\n\"It's a young team here. You can see the things that the club are trying to do, and trying to implement, and to come back and to see it, be part of it, is something that is truly special for myself being a local Newcastle girl, and to help the younger generation and future stars of the game coming through.\n\"If I can lead by any example, give my experience in any possible way, I'll hope to do that, and just to enjoy myself being back in here in Newcastle.\"\nThe Newcastle Herald understands the Jets will also be boosted by the addition of striker Sarina Bolden, who famously scored the Philippines' first goal at a World Cup in their 1-0 win over New Zealand in July.\n\"We're at home, so hopefully we can get as many people out to this game as we can this weekend and have the girls fully supported by Newcastle, which I know the fans here are amazing,\" van Egmond said.\n\"It's going to be a tough game for us. They're a great team.\n\"They've always been a strong team in the league and we'll look to do what we obviously need to do and be as competitive as we can ... I'm just really looking to enjoy myself here and enjoy the fact that I get to be in Jets colours again.\"\nKick-off is at 4pm.\nMeanwhile, the Jets' men's F3 Derby set down for Saturday, November 25 has been moved to Central Coast Stadium due to ongoing turf renovations at McDonald Jones Stadium following the recent Supercross event there.\nThe reverse A-League round-19 fixture that was initially scheduled to be played in Gosford will now be played in Newcastle on Saturday, March 2.\nThere are no A-League men's matches this weekend.\nIN THE NEWS:",
