  "body_text": "Olivia Attwood's sad 'reason' for marriage split with Bradley Dack\nAs TV star Olivia Attwood settles into a new London apartment, sources reveal why there is no going back from her split from footballer Bradley Dack\nIt seems second time lucky wasn't on the cards for Olivia Attwood and Bradley Dack, with a source revealing that their marriage is beyond repair after the Gillingham FC footballer reportedly \"crossed the line\". Rumours of trouble at home have been circulating for months, and tensions intensified after Olivia shared an emotional video, writing: \"Next chapter pending\". At the time, she admitted: \"Things don’t always play out the way you thought they might.”\nThe 34 year old also revealed they'd endured a \"challenging\" six-month period following photographs of her partying with mate Pete Wicks – who is her co-presenter on The Sunday Roast on KISS – aboard a yacht in Ibiza during the summer, with the insider suggesting the signs were already there.\nSpeaking to the Mirror, the source claimed: \"It’s definitely over. They were going in two very, very different directions. He wanted to settle down and start a family but she was loving her work and starting new things, so they just weren’t on the same page any more.\"\nThey added: \"She loved the cameras and her work, but he hated them, and she’s so driven with her career and always wants more and is continuously thinking about her next steps. It just wasn’t working for them as a couple.\"\nWhile an additional source close to Olivia confirmed to the Mirror that there had been a \"breach of trust\" on Bradley's part, which left Olivia devastated. “Although she’s spoken publicly about the difficulties of maintaining a marriage when both partners have busy careers, especially with lots of travel, a divorce or a break-up was never an option for her,” they said.\n“Ultimately it was because of a breach of trust on Bradley’s part. It crossed a line and was the straw that broke the camel’s back, so to speak. She’s heartbroken and just trying to process it all at the moment.”\nThe couple first met in 2015, and Olivia went on to appear on Love Island in 2017 after learning that Bradley had cheated on her early in their relationship. They later reconciled following her brief romance with fellow Islander Chris Hughes, and Bradley, 32, proposed in Dubai in 2019.\nDespite filming Olivia Marries Her Match for ITV in the run-up to their wedding at London's exclusive Bulgari Hotel, Bradley \"hated\" the cameras and the invasion of his privacy away from the football pitch, according to the source. He was also reportedly furious when photographs of his wife enjoying herself in Ibiza were shared on the Gillingham FC group WhatsApp chat last summer.\n“He was getting a lot of stick at football over the relationship,” our source said. “It wasn’t very nice for either of them towards the end, and when the love has started to go, it’s really hard to repair things and get them back on track.\n“There are always rumours about Pete, and of course she’s relying on mates like him at the moment. They’re very, very close, but there’s nothing in it romantically. They get on brilliantly but the timing would have to be right, and at the minute he’s just a good friend to her.”\nJust last week, Olivia showed off her new London flat after moving out the luxurious £1million property she previously shared with Bradley. Their former home boasted matching walk-in wardrobes, a swimming pool and extensive gardens for their adopted dogs Lola and Stitch - and upon leaving in December, Olivia posted a heartfelt video, stating: \"Next chapter pending.\"\nAccording to the source, her next chapter will undoubtedly feature more television appearances and an elevated public profile. Her profile has soared since her Love Island stint, securing a position on the Loose Women panel and filling in as a presenter on the This Morning sofa, alongside numerous individual projects including Getting Filthy Rich and Bad Boyfriends.\nOlivia has also recently been confirmed as the presenter of ITV2's upcoming reality programme The Heat. The 10-episode series will broadcast later this year and follows a group of aspiring chefs \"taking on the hottest job of their lives\" whilst receiving training from Michelin Star chef Jean-Christophe Novelli in Barcelona.\nLast year, Olivia revealed that her career and Bradley's took \"precedence over everything\" and that they had to \"navigate our relationship all the time\". However, according to our source, she may still make room for a potential new partner once things have calmed down.\n“Her perfect man would be someone who supports her and understands her ambitions and is by her side and understands the fame game,” the source said.",
