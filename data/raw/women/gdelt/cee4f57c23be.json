I spent six months waiting for life to return to normal but when that didn’t happen, I soon realised that I had to do something else,” Dry told The Advertiser in 2022.\nCurrently working as a selling agent with Ouwens Casserly Real Estate, Dry admits she had always thought of real estate, having renovated and decorated homes on the reality TV show.\n“I started my journey as a real estate agent in November 2020. I now absolutely love it, even more than I had thought,” she says.\n“I have always loved working with people and my favourite thing as a performer was connecting with an audience. And now as a real estate agent, my favourite thing is connecting with my clients and making a difference in their lives.”\nTYSON EDWARDS, HARRIS REAL ESTATE\nRiding the ups and downs of the property market is second nature to Tyson Edwards, who prior to selling, navigated the highs and lows of a professional football career.\nHaving previously played for West Adelaide in the SANFL, Edwards made his AFL debut with the Adelaide Crows in 1995 and established himself as one of the AFL’s most consistent midfielders of the time.\nHe played some 321 games for the Crows, appearing in the side’s legendary 1997 and 1998 premiership sides. Edwards retired in 2010, was an assistant coach at the Port Adelaide Football Club from 2012 to 2015 and started a career in real estate in 2016, selling with his wife Mandy for Harris Real Estate who he still works for today.\nBIANCA DENHAM, RAY WHITE\nBianca Denham knows exactly what it takes to win.\nBefore turning to real estate and marrying Ray White SA chief auctioneer and actor John Morris, Denham formed an integral part of London-based pop band, Hansom Pilot as its lead singer and guitarist.\nFormed in London in 2005, the band released their eponymous debut EP in February 2007, followed by the single ‘Gotta Get Outta Here’ in May 2008 and the album ‘Season One’ in September 2009.\nAfter 10 years of experiencing the highs and lows of the music industry, Denham made the difficult decision not to continue with the band, returning to Australia where she looked for something new to throw herself into.\nShe quickly found her new passion in real estate, starting out as an agent before moving into the corporate team as a performance business development executive.\nGABRIELLE OVERTON, LJ HOOKER KENSINGTON/UNLEY\nFor LJ Hooker Kensington/Unley’s Gabrielle Overton, working as a real estate agent allows her to implement the wide range of skills she’s accumulated in her long and varied working life.\nAmong the more than 50 jobs she’s had, she worked in TV, doing casual TV work on the Super Dooper Flying Fun Show in Adelaide from 1971 to 1972, and later produced and hosted the more than 300 episodes of the longest running live women’s morning TV show, Touch of Elegance, back when they operated without notes, autocue or computers.\nBut it’s winning the Miss South Australia crown in 1972 that helped really establish her public profile.\n“The 50 years from then to now, has flown by,” she previously told The Advertiser.\n“I’m still living life to the full, it just takes me a bit longer to “scrub up”.\n“I’m fiercely competitive and I love looking for ways to use my varied skill set to value add for my client and get them the best possible result.”\nDAMON BROHIER, RAY WHITE\nDamon Brohier’s approach to his real estate career comes with meticulous care and pride in delivering exceptional customer service.\nIt’s the same attitude his brings to his musical profession as the drummer of Sydney-based rock/metal band Sienna Skies.\nThe band recently toured with American Juggernauts, Of Mice and Men and will launch their The Hardest Part tour this November, with support acts including US-based band Of Virtue and Clay J Gladstone.\nWhen not letting loose on stage, Damon is known for drumming up support for his clients when selling their homes in and around Mount Barker and the Adelaide Hills.\nVICTORIA\nSARAH MCDOUGAL, RAY WHITE PAKENHAM\nAfter a successful run on season 12 of Big Brother Australia, pocket-rocket Sarah McDougal is now making a big impact in real estate, working alongside Ray White Pakenham senior sales consultant Gavin Staindl as his personal assistant.\nThe pair met prior to Sarah’s Big Brother fame, during a Relay for Life event where she tagged along with Gavin’s team when she was 15.\nSarah was offered a job as a sales cadet with Ray White Pakenham in 2019, however she turned it down as she was offered a spot on Big Brother Australia just a week later.\nSarah was one of the top contestants in the Big Brother house in 2020, making it to the top five.\n“I applied for a job as a sales cadet at the end of 2019, but just as they offered me the job I also got the offer to go on Big Brother,” she said.\n“Being just 18 at the time I decided my career could wait as going on Big Brother was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n“When I was in the Big Brother house multiple people said I would make a good real estate agent. So when I got out I thought I would give it a crack.”\nANDREW LEONCELLI, ABADEEN PROPERTY GROUP\nIt’s been two decades since former Melbourne Demons player Andrew Leoncelli retired from AFL and kicked off his career in property, but there are similarities between his careers on and off the field.\n“It feels like yesterday that I was playing – it was a big part of my life – but 20 years is a long time,” Mr Leoncelli told realestate.com.au.\n“Both are very competitive industries, where the people that work the hardest do the best. “There’s a real tenacity to both industries, a similar work ethic and a real sense of teamwork, so the synergies are really strong.”\nThe milestone comes as Mr Leoncelli embarks on a new venture, departing CBRE Residential Projects after 14 years to lead the expansion of developer Abadeen Property Group into Victoria.\nThe new Abadeen Victoria managing director will work with Abadeen Group’s founder and managing director Justin Brown to deliver high-end apartment developments in the east and southeast of Melbourne.\nJOBE WATSON, WATSON PROPERTY ADVISORS PTY LTD\nDespite captaining the Essendon Football Club through one of the most controversial scandals in AFL history, Jobe Watson is remembered as one of the greatest midfielders in the game. After losing money on his first ever property purchase, Watson knew he needed insights from an expert for his next endeavour.\nSo, while still playing footy, he enlisted the help of a buyer’s advocate to purchase a family home.\nAfter experiencing this process first-hand, Watson was eager to learn more about becoming a buyer’s advocate himself, and asked if he could do some work experience with the same business – Infolio Property Advisors.\nAfter 220 games at the Essendon Football Club and a few entrepreneurial endeavours overseas, Watson is now a director at that same company – helping to ease the burden of purchasing and managing properties.\nERIN CUBLEY, RAY WHITE\nWe’ve all dreamt about running away to join the circus but Ray White Bacchus Marsh principal Erin Cubley has lived the dream.\nAlready riding horses professionally at the time, Erin joined the circus initially to start some younger horses but got roped into performing.\nShe said the horses were taught to lay down and rear on command as well as some higher skilled things with the world famous Lipizzaner Stallions – and had a big orchestra that they would dance to.\n“It was great to travel to all the major cities and perform in front of such large crowds,” she said.\n“We would go and visit all the circuses on the way and watch the performances because they were all friends or relatives of who I worked for.\n“Most of them were not originally from Australia so it was great to learn about the different cultures.”\nCrossing the Nullarbor with 11 stallions was one of her most memorable experiences which included having to set up portable stables each night – often in the middle of nowhere – and one particular horse prone to biting who got loose one night causing all sorts of chaos.\nJOHN ROMBOTIS, O’BRIEN REAL ESTATE\nFormer Australian rules footballer turned high-calibre auctioneer John Rombotis knows what it takes to win – on and off the field.\nA former footy player for Fitzroy (now Brisbane Lions), Port Adelaide and Richmond in the ’90s, Mr Rombotis commenced his real estate career in 2000 and founded his own boutique agency, Rombotis Real Estate, in 2015.\nNow making his mark at O’Brien Real Estate as an auctioneer and senior property consultant, Rombotis made headlines this month with the sale of the home of the VFL’s first female administrator, who is selling her Forest Hill house she has lived in for almost 60 years.\nQUEENSLAND\nJASON ACKERMANIS, BLUE MOON PROPERTY\nKnown for his crazy antics and outspoken views on and off the football field over the years, Jason Akermanis is, perhaps, one of Queensland’s most well-known sporting-heroes-turned-real estate agents.\nAckermanis heads up Blue Moon Ascot and his Akermanis Properties team, servicing the exclusive suburbs of Hamilton, Clayfield and Ascot.\nWhile he is a renowned sportsman, being inducted into the AFL Hall of fame, three-time premiership winner and recipient of AFLs holy grail, the Brownlow Medal, he is also committed and driven to get winning results across all facets of real estate for his vendors.\nIZAACK POWEL, RAY WHITE COMMERCIAL\nAfter an exciting football career playing for the Brisbane Roar, and a hard battle with leukaemia, Izaack Powell has taken on a new challenge joining Ray White Commercial Gateway as a sales agent.\nIzaack was the youngest player to ever debut with the Brisbane Roar, at just 16 years old, before he was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2021.\nIn December 2022, Izaack returned to the football field, but upon a check-up in 2023 found out his leukaemia had relapsed.\nDuring his treatment, Izaack realised a new passion for commercial real estate.\n“During my treatment for leukaemia I was able to engage in a lot of property content in the form of both books and podcasts where I quickly learnt that I would love to pursue a career in the industry,” he said.\n“I also enjoy speaking with people from different walks of life such as business owners and property developers which I am able to do at RWC.\n“My main goal over the next 12 months is just to learn as much as possible from the wealth of real estate knowledge that we have in the RWC Gateway office.\n“Outside of work, I am excited to get back to playing football next season, with the aim of playing consistently for the first time in a few years.”\nJAMIE GODDARD, MCGRATH REAL ESTATE\nWhile most fans will probably remember him as a firey Queensland rake who sat the 8th Immortal squarely on his backside, Goddard was actually quite a handy player who represented three of the great cult clubs – Gold Coast (Seagulls and Chargers), North Sydney and the Northern Eagles.\nHe’s also had the rare distinction of leading the original Gold Coast franchise to their first finals series during the 1997 ARL season and played four games for the Queensland Maroons in the State of Origin.\nAfter retiring from footy in 2002, Goddard moved into real estate. He currently works for McGrath Terrigal.\nJAMIE CHARMAN, CHAPMAN PROPERTY\nWhile plenty of footballers like to dabble in property investment, former AFL player Jamie Charman has gone one step further.\nThe former ruckman for the Brisbane Lions has become a real estate agent and, after a stint with Ray White Albion, now serves as the director of Chapman Property.\nThroughout his footy career, he became renowned for his crash and bash approach to ruckwork, similar to that of former teammate Clark Keating (a former Brisbane Lions ruck coach).\nCharman retired in 2011 due to an ongoing Achilles tendon injury but, for a brief stint, joined the North Queensland Cowboys as a part-time kicking and catching coach before taking on the roll of commercial manager for the Brisbane Lions until 2016.\nHe has been a real estate agent since 2018.\nNEW SOUTH WALES\nJOEL SMITH, GAVL\nIn his former career, entrepreneur Joel Smith played AFL with Hawthorn Football Club. Today, he is the CEO of Gavl, a digital tech start-up transforming the way people engage in what is arguably their favourite pastime outside of sport: real estate.\nLaunched in October 2016, Gavl is an app-based platform that lets users watch auctions live – or on demand – from mobile devices, anywhere in the world.\nSmith launched the platform alongside Leith Donalson and Michael Artup, with the start-up buoyed by a $2.5 million investment from Geoff Harris (Flight Centre co-founder, Boost Juice seed investor and ex-VP of Hawthorn Football Club) and his son Brad Harris (Sporting Globe Bar and Grill, co-founder).\nSmith began his footy career in 1995 as a bright young prospect for St Kilda but moved to Hawthorn at the end of 1997, following a contractual dispute.\nSmith retired at the end of the 2007 with 221 AFL games behind him.\nTIM MOLTZEN, COHEN HANDLER\nTim Moltzen had a successful career as a rugby league professional playing for the West Tigers for ten years.\nAn injury led Tim into early retirement, and within this time, he fell in love with property. Fortunate enough to be under the wing of Michael Coombs, a highly successful real estate agent in Mosman, he was able to combine the skills and energy acquired from being a professional athlete and transition that into his passion for real estate.\nBuying and selling in Mosman, Tim realised his core strength was helping clients with their purchases and was introduced to the world of Buyers Agents.\nMoltzen, who played 90 NRL games across six seasons before his career was cut short due to injury in 2013, said buyer’s agents could coach buyers away from paying an “exuberant” amount over what the property is worth.\n“I wish when I was playing footy that I had someone on my side doing the weekend auctions for me,” he told the Herald Sun in 2023.\nJOSH MANSOUR, CLIQUE BUILT\nFormer NRL star Josh Mansour likes to encourage his teammates to think about “life after footy”.\nThe former Penrith Panthers and South Sydney Rabbitohs winger had his back-up plan on the go before his NRL career took off, making life after his 11 seasons and 174 first grade games much easier.\nThe 33-year-old, who is expecting his third child with wife Daniella, bought into the business Clique Built, a residential builder and renovator, which has found a niche in helping people get their homes ready for sale.\n“It was through a mutual friend who asked if I wanted to buy into the business,” Mansour told The Daily Telegraph.\n“I’ve always had a passion for building and construction as well as real estate. Before my NRL career, I knew I had to pick up a book or tool.\n“I decided to pick up a power drill and ended up getting a carpentry certificate before my NRL career.\n“Over the years I’ve loved being a handyman at home but during my career I was limited for time and couldn’t be on a job site. Towards the end of my league career, I put time into my transition and started looking at options.”\nMARK BRYANT, CUNNINGHAMS REAL ESTATE\nHaving retired from a 12 year professional Rugby League career, including the world record 40-0 Grand Final win for the Manly Sea Eagles against the Melbourne Storm in 2008, this former Sea Eagle now provides quality customer service based on the values that saw him rise to the top in professional sport.\nA natural people person with a passion for the Northern Beaches, Bryant has been selling homes since he retired after 11 years on the field.\n“I actually did my real estate license the Thursday before the 2008 grand final,” Bryant told 9News.",
