  "body_text": "Tottenham vs Man Utd WSL preview: TV channel, live stream, team news & prediction\nTottenham and Manchester United finally go head to head in the WSL for the first time this season, taking to the field in a rearranged game originally scheduled in September.\nThe game is being played at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with Spurs hoping for a crowd in excess of 30,000 and United set to take a big away following as was the case when they faced Arsenal in a pulsating encounter at the Emirates Stadium in November.\nAfter playing at the Emirates, Old Trafford, Etihad and Madejski in four of their last six WSL games, as well as being well accustomed to a wide open pitch at usual home Leigh Sports Village, it might be the visiting United who are better suited to the big stadium experience.\nWhere to watch Tottenham vs Man Utd WSL on TV/live stream\nWhen is kick off? Sunday 12 February, 12:00 (GMT)\nWhere is the match being played? Tottenham Hotspur Stadium\nTV channel/live stream? Sky Sports Main Event/Football (UK), Paramount + (US), FA Player (International)\nWhat time does coverage start? 11:30\nReferee? Amy Fearn\nTottenham team news\nTottenham continue to be without long-term absentees Kit Graham, Ria Percival, Kyah Simon and Ellie Brazil, with the quartet all at different stages of recovery from ACL injuries.\nMan Utd team news\nMarc Skinner has reported no new injuries in the Manchester United squad, with everyone available for selection aside from January signings Jayde Riviere and Lisa Naalsund.\nRiviere and Naalsund continue to make progress in building their fitness and remain on course to be available for United's trip to Chelsea on 12 March.\nTottenham vs Man Utd score prediction\nHaving scored five against Aston Villa and six against Liverpool either side of a Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium and the winter break, Manchester United have seen their high-powered attack suddenly stutter in recent weeks.\nThe Red Devils have managed only one goal in their last two WSL games - a stoppage time winner from Rachel Williams against Reading - while they also only narrowly beat Sunderland in the FA Cup.\nMarc Skinner has insisted he isn't concerned because of the number of chances the team are still creating, with poor finishing to blame rather than a lack of ideas in the build up. He will hope that his players break through that goal drought in this game against a Spurs side in poor form.\nThe Londoners have lost six WSL games on the spin since hitting Brighton for eight in October. Cup games against lower league opposition has provided their only respite in that time.\nSpurs have not only been losing but were also struggling to score goals in the run up to Christmas, athough things have improved in that respect since the January arrival of Bethany England - it is two goals in two from her in the WSL and three for the team as a whole.\nThey do, however, face a United side that has kept a league nine clean sheets so far this season and is yet to concede against any team outside the current top four.\nPrediction: Tottenham 0-2 Man Utd\nFor more from Jamie Spencer, follow him on Twitter!",
