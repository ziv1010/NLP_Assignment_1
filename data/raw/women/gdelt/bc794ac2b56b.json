So we are, at the moment, doing a deep dive surveillance of superannuation trustees’s handling of death benefits claims more broadly. We are going to be writing to the CEOs of superannuation trustees shortly to really put them on notice as to what we are seeing and our concerns about that.\"\nCBUS has apologised for the delays in processing claims, acknowledging they had added to the distress of members and their families.\n—\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers has announced a fund of up to $900 million for states and territories to improve productivity and competition.\nStates will be able to choose from a menu of options with the aim to streamline commercial planning and zoning, and remove barriers that inhibit the take-up of modern construction methods.\nThe National Productivity Fund is part of the federal government's all-out effort to tackle one of Australia’s biggest structural economic issues.\nSenior Economist Melissa Wilson from the Committee for Economic Development of Australia says the fund will encourage states and territories to make critical reforms despite the fiscal odds often stacked against them.\n—\nWomen going through menopause now have access to a new specialised health hub in New South Wales.\nThe hub, located at the Royal Hospital for Women in Randwick, is the state’s first hormone and mood clinic, where patients can access psychiatrists, gynaecologists and endocrinologists.\nThe team will provide specialist care to women with severe or complex menopause symptoms who have not responded to previous treatments.\nUp to one in four women will experience severe menopause symptoms - that's roughly 400,000 Australians at any one time.\n36-year-old Reena Murry is one of the first women to access the hub.\nShe says it was difficult to find the right help after she entered early-onset menopause.\n\"I was told that I would go into menopause as a result of chemotherapy and I didn't know it would be as severe as what it was, it was sudden because of the nature of the drugs that I was on. So, very intense. Finding the right services has been a challenge and that's how I ended up here.\"\n—\nFootball Australia has announced the 2026 Women's Asian Cup will be played across five venues in Sydney, Perth and the Gold Coast.\nMeanwhile, a number of Matildas starred in the UEFA Champions League this morning.\nCaitlin Foord rounded out a 4-nil victory for Arsenal over Juventus.\nKyra Cooney-Cross providing the assist for Foord's goal.\nCompatriots Mary Fowler and Alanna Kennedy ensured Manchester City continued their perfect start to the group stage.\nBoth played a full match as City defeated Hammarby 2-nil.",
