  "body_text": "Visitors to Chelsea’s training complex do not need to linger long to hear the words “Vision 2030” being uttered — and not in reference to the state project of the same name, which is indirectly providing lucrative paydays for departing club legend N’Golo Kante as well as surplus first-teamers Kalidou Koulibaly, Edouard Mendy and Hakim Ziyech in Saudi Arabia.\nAdvertisement\nNo, this particular Vision 2030 resonates in the academy building, where it has become a mission statement for director of football development and operations Neil Bath (above) and head of youth development and recruitment Jim Fraser. Chelsea, the dominant club in English youth football throughout the 2010s and one of England’s most successful developers of top-level talent in recent years, are in no mood to rest on their laurels in what remains of the 2020s.\nBy the end of this decade, Bath and Fraser have set the academy setup five main targets. They are:\n- For academy players to contribute 15 per cent of Chelsea’s league minutes\n- For academy graduates to make up 25 per cent of their first-team squad\n- To have above national-average GCSE and A Level results\n- To have more Cobham graduates in the professional game than any other academy\n- To win more national and international competitions than any other academy.\nChelsea’s base at Cobham, in the Surrey countryside south of London, already measures up well for some of these.\nTheir seven academy products in last season’s first-team squad — Mason Mount, Conor Gallagher, Trevoh Chalobah, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Reece James, Armando Broja and Lewis Hall — accounted for 22.9 per cent of the Premier League minutes played, despite Mount and James being limited by injuries.\nAnd it is not hard to find Cobham graduates in the lower tiers of the EFL, the second through fourth divisions of the English game, though the club are not as dominant at under-18 and under-21 level as when they won seven FA Youth Cups in nine seasons from 2009-18 and back-to-back UEFA Youth League triumphs in 2015 and 2016.\nBut the landscape of youth recruitment in England has also shifted dramatically in recent years, chiefly as a result of Brexit. “We haven’t got under-16 targets all over Europe anymore,” Fraser says. “We can only recruit in the UK, so how can we get an advantage? We’ve got to be creative in getting players first, and that is not easy.”\nThe removal of the possibility of acquiring the next Andreas Christensen (Denmark) or Nathan Ake (Netherlands) has intensified the race to identify and sign the best British youngsters. “We cannot miss out on anything,” Fraser insists. “Our competitors are closing the gap and some might even think they’re ahead of us. We don’t like that, so we need to think of different ways to stay ahead of the rest.”\nAdvertisement\nThe endless search improvement led Chelsea to announce a five-year deal with AiSCOUT — an automated talent analysis and development platform — to become the club’s academy research partner in September.\nSpeaking at the unveiling event at Cobham, Fraser said: “We’ve got to respect the past and understand the present, but we’ve got to predict the future. The way we think you do that is by surrounding yourself with talented people, but you’ve also got to be ahead of the world in technology.”\nAiSCOUT uses machine learning to unearth and analyse talent in amateur and youth football, complementing Chelsea’s human scouting network with data and a bank of video footage. Consulting closely during the development of the platform over two years gave the club a higher degree of confidence that it could meet their needs.\nAmateur players can upload footage of themselves performing training drills, and also participate in athletic, cognitive and psychometric tests that form a profile in a centralised database. At their end, Chelsea can specify parameters that the platform uses to scour the database and identify potentially suitable players for further assessment.\n“You can filter for the type of player, the type of attributes you’re looking for,” Fraser explains. “That’s no different to how we educate the scouts. We’re looking for certain types of talents, then there might be some position-specific criteria, and they have to understand what’s already registered here, as well as what our other targets are across the country and Europe, then you weigh up all that information.\n“We’re not going to forget the older scouts, because they’ve got a definite feel for footballers and talent. We’ve got guys in their twenties through to their eighties scouting for Chelsea, right across the world. We’re very flexible and we need to listen to the talented people we have, but if we can add data alongside it to have a better overview of a player, that’s really important.”\nAdvertisement\nWhen it comes to winning at youth level, there is always a balance to be struck between results on the pitch and player development. Chelsea maintained it superbly in the 2010s, fostering a winning culture all the way up to under-21s level that prepared many of their graduates well for the challenges of the senior game without compromising their ability to learn through failure as well as success.\nHowever, Chelsea’s development squad were almost relegated from the Professional Under-21 Development League last year under Andy Myers — though there would likely have been much less jeopardy if he had been able to call upon the likes of Levi Colwill, Ian Maatsen, Billy Gilmour and Armando Broja, all of whom were instead gaining valuable first-team experience out on loan.\nAcademy Blues content! 🤝 pic.twitter.com/fNi1dHQ6N6\n— Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) October 13, 2022\n“If you go back to last season, those players who represented the under-23s, Andy had a very young side there,” development squad coach Mark Robinson tells The Athletic. “It doesn’t mean they weren’t developing. You can’t always judge it by trophies. Those players were getting valuable development, a young side playing in a very competitive league.”\nLast season, Robinson’s bid to win the EFL Trophy was undermined by some of his best players — namely Hall and Bashir Humphreys — regularly training and, at times, travelling with Chelsea’s first-team squad — not that he was ever inclined to complain about the situation. “If the trophies come, that’s great. But it’s more about, ‘Who is the next one we can produce for the first team?’,” he insists.\n“Let’s say, for example, 10 of the lads didn’t train with the first team and we had all those players stay for the EFL Trophy and we beat Cheltenham (the League One club knocked them out in the last 16) — not being arrogant, but I think we would have done — then go on to win the EFL Trophy.\n“I’m not saying that isn’t great, but then Lewis Hall and Bashir don’t play for the first team. Which is the better of the two scenarios? You have to say it’s playing in the first team. It’s more of a trophy. It’s also given the other lads an incentive — the ones who have trained with the first team but haven’t played yet, plus the ones who haven’t had the opportunity yet. It drives them on, thinking, ‘Am I going to be next?’.”\nIt is notable that, amid sweeping change throughout virtually every department at Chelsea since Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital’s acquisition of the club from long-time owner Roman Abramovich early last summer, the two most consistently successful football operations at Cobham — the women’s team and the academy — have largely been left alone.\nAdvertisement\nBath and Fraser are rated extremely highly by Boehly and Clearlake co-founder Behdad Eghbali, and Chelsea’s new owners signalled from the beginning that they envisioned the academy being far more central to the club’s identity than under the previous regime. The scale of their enthusiasm and ambition was underlined by the slightly far-fetched suggestion that an entire Chelsea first-team starting XI of Cobham graduates might one day be fielded at Stamford Bridge.\nThat notion now appears ludicrous to anyone who has watched Chelsea’s staggering transfer spending in the past two transfer windows — particularly in January, when it became clear that Boehly and Eghbali were placing an emphasis on targeting elite footballers aged 22 or younger. At times it has been difficult to divine a strategy beyond the accumulation and stockpiling of rising talent.\nFront-loading investment in this way has also run up a recruitment bill that must be at least partly paid this summer, if only for the purposes of financial fair play (FFP) compliance. Boehly and Clearlake are faring better than most expected at trimming a bloated squad, with help from the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia and a willingness to sell high earners such as Kai Havertz and Mateo Kovacic to direct Premier League rivals in Arsenal and Manchester City respectively.\nBut fears at Cobham that academy products may once again serve as a financial release-valve look well founded: Loftus-Cheek is off to AC Milan; Manchester United are still pursuing Mount; and Gallagher and Chalobah are viewed by some as very saleable assets, despite their desire to stay. Rival clubs are even monitoring Hall, whose breakthrough represented one of the few bright spots of a miserable 2022-23 for the first team.\nIntroducing the 2022/23 Academy Player of the Season!💙 pic.twitter.com/v04k5jP0pi\n— Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) May 28, 2023\nAny shrinking of the Cobham contingent in incoming head coach Mauricio Pochettino’s squad will be a blow to academy morale, but Mount’s departure would be the most devastating of all.\nHis first senior Chelsea goal, against Leicester City at Stamford Bridge in August 2019, was celebrated as a seminal moment for the academy and he has been held up to those in their younger age groups ever since as the symbol of the development pathway: a two-time club player of the year and, along with James, a strong candidate for the captaincy sooner rather than later.\nSelling him to a domestic rival, while continuing to sign expensive younger footballers who could block first-team pathways for other academy kids in the future, creates a set of conditions that undermine the aspirations of Bath and Fraser.\nAdvertisement\nChelsea have already lost the likes of Jamal Musiala (Bayern Munich) and Samuel Iling Jr (Juventus) in recent years and only a compelling, coherent development pitch will prevent such a youth talent drain from becoming a bigger, more damaging problem.\nChelsea’s academy remains one of the very best in the world and under the guidance of Bath and Fraser, there is every reason to believe it will continue to attract and develop top young footballers.\nMaking their Vision 2030 a reality, however, will require more than new technology and bright coaching minds.\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Eamonn Dalton)",
