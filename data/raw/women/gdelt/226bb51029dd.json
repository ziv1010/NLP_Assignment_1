Xavi Simons gave the Dutch an early lead before Harry Kane scored a rather controversial penalty to level the scoreline shortly after.\nIt was a rather evenly contested match up but England substitutes Cole Palmer and Ollie Watkins combined in stoppage time to propel the Three Lions into the final. The 2-1 victory means they will face Spain in Berlin on Sunday in a bid to end the men’s long trophy drought.\nWiegman is fully focused on her own team’s Euro 2025 qualifying campaign and their clash against the Republic of Ireland at Carrow Road on Friday night. However, she did admit her ‘orange heart hurts’ after the Netherlands’ defeat at Signal Iduna Park.\n\"You want a political answer?\" the Lionesses boss told reporters on Thursday. \"No, I have to be really honest, of course wish the very, very best for Gareth and his team and so many people, of course, because we are colleagues. But it did hurt, a little bit. My orange heart hurt.\n\"They [England] know exactly what they have to do. It is their second [Euros] final, which is incredible. I just wish them all the best and in England you would say, ‘let’s bring it home'.\"\nThe Lionesses face the Republic of Ireland on Friday night before they travel to face Sweden in their qualifying group decider on Tuesday. England are currently third in their group, level on points with Sweden and two behind leaders France.\nWiegman’s side will need to occupy one of the top two spots in their group to automatically qualify for next summer’s finals in Switzerland. Should they finish third, they will need to contend two rounds of play-offs in order to keep their hopes of retaining the title alive.",
