Baltimore faces Houston in the second game.\nThe streaming giant agreed to a three-year contract in May to carry Christmas Day games.\nWhere will the games be available?\nNetflix’s 282.3 million subscribers in over 190 countries will be able to stream the games, marking the first time one outlet has distributed an NFL game globally. Netflix will have the games available in five languages — English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and German.\nThe games will also air on CBS affiliates in Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Houston. NFL policy dictates that games on cable or being exclusively streamed must also be on an over-the-air station in the competing teams’ markets. It will also be available on mobile devices in the U.S. for those who have NFL+.\nWhy is the NFL putting Christmas Day games on a streaming platform?\nThe biggest reason is money. The league is getting $150 million from Netflix for the two games this season. It also continues the NFL’s moves into streaming — Thursday night games are in their third season on Amazon Prime Video and the “Sunday Ticket” package moved to YouTube TV last year.\nBut Christmas is on a Wednesday when games usually aren’t played.\nThat’s true, but the league wasn’t about to give up Christmas after seeing the ratings. Last year’s three games averaged 28.68 million viewers. The early afternoon contest between the Las Vegas Raiders and Chiefs led the way, averaging 29.48 million.\nThe Chiefs, Steelers, Ravens and Texans played on Saturday, giving them the same turnaround they would have if they played on Sunday and then Thursday.\nWhat is at stake for the teams playing?\nAll four have clinched playoff spots in the AFC, but seeding remains up for grabs.\nKansas City (14-1) can clinch the top seed — which would mean a first-round bye and home field throughout the playoffs — with a win over the Steelers. Pittsburgh and Baltimore are tied atop the AFC North at 10-5, with the Steelers holding the tiebreaker due to a better conference record.\nHouston (9-6) has wrapped up the AFC South and holds the fourth seed.\nHas Netflix fixed its streaming problems from the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight?\nNetflix hopes so. Brandon Riegg, Netflix’s vice president of nonfiction series and sports, said the system was stress tested, and then some, during the Nov. 14 bout, along with internet service providers reporting they were also overwhelmed by the surge that occurred before and during the fight.\nThe bout peaked at 65 million concurrent streams, including 38 million concurrent streams in the United States. According to the website Down Detector, nearly 85,000 viewers logged problems with outages or streaming leading up to and during the fight.\nCould there be the same number streaming the games that there were during the fight?\nPossible? Yes. Likely? No.\nThe largest audience for a streamed-exclusive NFL game was 23 million on Peacock for last season’s AFC wild-card game between the Miami Dolphins and Chiefs.\nNielsen will measure the ratings for the Christmas Day games, with early numbers expected late afternoon on Thursday.\nWhen could there be surge in demand on Wednesday?\nIt will probably beat kickoff for both games, but especially around 5:45 p.m. EST. That would be near halftime of the Ravens-Texans game, and when Beyoncé will be performing.\nWhat other celebrities will appear?\nMariah Carey will kick off the day with a taped performance of “All I Want for Christmas is You.”\nThere is no word if Taylor Swift will make the trip to Pittsburgh to watch her boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Swift has been spending time in Kansas City since she wrapped up her Eras Tour two weeks ago.\nHow many Christmas games will Netflix carry in the next two seasons?\nThe NFL will have at least two games on Dec. 25 in 2025 and ’26, with Netflix slated to have at least one each year. Amazon Prime Video will have a night game with Christmas on a Thursday next year.\nDoes Netflix have an interest in other sports?\nNetflix’s worldwide partnership with World Wrestling Entertainment will begin on Jan. 6 when “Monday Night Raw” moves to the streaming service.\nOn Friday, Netflix secured the U.S. rights for the 2027 and 2031 FIFA Women’s World Cup.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",
