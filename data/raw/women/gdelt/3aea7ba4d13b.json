  "body_text": "Arrowheadlines: Study reveals Chiefs have more female fans than most other teams\nChiefs headlines for Monday, June 24\n30. KANSAS CITY CHIEFS - JAMES COOK, RB, GEORGIA\nOriginal Pick: George Karlaftis, EDGE, Purdue\nSure, Kansas City found the ultimate value with Isiah Pacheco in the seventh round of this draft, but this re-do wouldn’t offer that opportunity again.\nWhile Pacheco has outproduced James Cook as a rusher but 136 yards, he’s needed 49 more attempts to get there. Cook has 151 more receiving yards and would be a more well-rounded playmaker for Patrick Mahomes.\nHONORABLE MENTION: DEFENSIVE LINE DEPTH\nIn each of the past two seasons, the Chiefs finished second in total sacks. The main reason for this success is the depth and versatility along their entire defensive line. While Chris Jones is a first-ballot Hall of Famer, several other players are vital to the unit’s success.\nGeorge Karlaftis has been solid over his first two seasons, Mike Danna is a Steve Spagnuolo favorite, Charles Omenihu was impressive in his limited time last year, and Felix Anudike-Uzomah is expected to take a step forward this season.\nNot only are these players good football players, but their versatility allows Spagnuolo to call exotic blitzes, coverages, and formations. Without their strong performance, the Chiefs wouldn’t have repeated as champions in February.\nKansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid revealed that he consumed an extremely large amount of cheeseburgers while filming a State Farm commercial with quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n“We did a hamburger shoot,” Reid explained to Complex Sports. “I made a pact to myself, just being a cheeseburger connoisseur, that I wouldn’t use the spit bucket. But after about the 60th cheeseburger, I had to go there.”\nThe three-time Super Bowl-winning head coach also revealed that he had trouble reading his lines to Mahomes during the commercial, as he was required to speak while he was eating.\n“Pat’s sitting right in front of me, so I’m trying to do this and there’s cheeseburger flying everywhere at these guys,” he said. “They couldn’t hold a straight face. I mean, they were dying laughing.”\nDespite a bump from the superstar singer, the Super Bowl champions — with 40% of its fans being female — lagged behind the Green Bay Packers and Carolina Panthers — both with 48% — in proportion of female fans, according to a social media analysis by online casino site BetVictor.\nThe traditionally buttoned-down Giants rated 18th in the NFL, with 35% of their fans being female, while the Jets were tied for 24th with 33% of their diehards being women, the data revealed.\nSwift, who was in the middle of the first U.S. leg of the Eras Tour when she met Kelce, continued to cheer on Travis from a suite during the football season.\n“I’m not surprised by the Green Bay thing because that’s all they have out there. They’re crazy about football,” snarked Trish Cassidy, 54, of Jersey City, a longtime Jets fan who said her dad got her hooked on the perennial losers.\n“The NFL received a major boost last season when Taylor Swift’s romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce caught global attention, ” said BetVictor spokesman Sam Boswell. He added the Chiefs “will likely keep bringing in more female fans, should Swift continue to be associated with the team.”\nIn a video circulating on social media, the NFL star can be seen dancing to his girlfriend’s hit song and flashing a smile as he sings, “He knelt down on the floor and pulled out a ring / And said, “Marry me Juliet / You’ll never have to be alone.”\nRumours spread on social media\nFans were caught up in his boyish grin, which got them excited about the possibility of an engagement in the future.\n“What if he came out on stage during that song and proposed to her?” one fan wondered on TikTok.\nAnother wrote: “I mean, his smile, the song, the whole gang being there, all I’m saying is it wouldn’t be a bad time.”\n“It’s probably my imagination, but. It really looks like Travis is flashing a sly little smile when he sings about getting down on one knee and pulling out a ring,” commented one X user.\n1 - Sam LaPorta\n2 - Travis Kelce\nAround the NFL\nFormer Patriots receiver Julian Edelman, who has won exactly as many Super Bowl MVPs as Rodgers, called Rodgers out for skipping the Jets’ recent mandatory minicamp.\n“I think it’s a bad look for your leader, for whatever reason, to go and miss [a mandatory minicamp],” Edelman told Colin Cowherd on Friday. “I was with Tom Brady in his 25th year or 23rd year, and he started missing OTAs here and there, but he never missed a mandatory minicamp. I just thought it was a bad look.”\nDetroit Lions legend and Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Barry Sanders announced Friday that he experienced a heart-related “health scare” last weekend.\n“Over Father’s Day weekend, I experienced a health scare related to my heart,” Sanders wrote in a statement posted on social media. “It was unexpected and served as a reminder of the importance of staying vigilant about our physical well-being, even when we are feeling fine.\n“I am grateful for the amazing doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals for providing me with needed care. My family and I are thankful for your prayers and support during this time.\nIn case you missed it on Arrowhead Pride\nFor the Kansas City Chiefs, Schatz proposed extending the contracts of two starters selected in the 2021 NFL Draft.\nExtend center Creed Humphrey and right guard Trey Smith\nThis one is pretty easy. The Chiefs may have the best interior offensive line in the league now that Jason Kelce has retired, but both Humphrey and Smith see their contracts end after the 2024 season. Kansas City needs to lock down its offensive line for the next few years and keep Humphrey and Smith through their primes.\nTakeaway\nIt’s impossible to argue that Humphrey or Smith have not earned the opportunity for a second NFL contract. The only question is whether the Chiefs will be the team to offer it.\nRodney Hudson and Mitch Morse — the last two second-round centers Kansas City has acquired — signed big contracts with new teams after their rookie contracts ended. After allowing Hudson to sign with the Oakland Raiders in 2015, general manager John Dorsey selected Morse in that spring’s draft. Brett Veach permitted Morse to sign with the Buffalo Bills in 2019, filling the position with free agents until he took Humphrey in 2021.\nSocial media to make you think\nFollow Arrowhead Pride on Social Media\n- Facebook: Click here to like our page\n- AP Instagram: Follow @ArrowheadPride\n- AP on X: Follow @ArrowheadPride\n- AP Staff on X: see complete list\n- 610 Sports on X: Follow @610SportsKC",
