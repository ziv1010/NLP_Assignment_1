NGOs and human rights activists in Hungary have condemned the government's proposed clampdown on this year's Pride march in Budapest. In a speech last week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán hinted that his administration would crack down on the event, saying it would be \"a waste of time and money\" for its organisers to make their usual preparations.

Researchers analyzed the brain scans of 19,964 women and 17,607 men from the UK and found that people who had children showed slower cognitive decline as they aged compared to those with fewer or no kids. “The regions that decrease in functional connectivity as individuals age are the regions associated with increased connectivity when individuals have had children,” said lead study author Avram Holmes, a psychiatry professor at the Rutgers Center for Advanced Human Brain Imaging Research.

Throwing a trifolded bag in the microwave for a few minutes brings back childhood memories of sleepovers, Blockbuster rentals, and jamming out on my Walkman. I want steaming popcorn that is equal parts buttery, salty, and crunchy—if it doesn’t leave my fingertips slicked with grease, I’m not interested. Nowadays, popcorn is still a top-tier snack in my eyes, though I’ve started dressing it up a bit more for variety. Otherwise, my criteria for a great bag of microwave popcorn has largely stayed the same. And so... -\nHow DEI is lowering NM legal standards and putting justice at risk\nOn Tuesday (2/18), the all-Democrat New Mexico Supreme Court issued a statement reaffirming its commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion within the judicial system. The Court framed its stance as a necessity for upholding justice, citing its duty to “eliminate barriers” and ensure “equal access” for all individuals, regardless of race, gender, or other demographic factors. While these ideals may sound noble, the actual implementation of DEI initiatives has proven to be deeply flawed, often undermining the very principles of equal justice and meritocracy that courts should uphold. The core principle of the American legal system is that justice should... -\nMen and women are wrong about what the opposite sex finds hot, new study reveals\nA new study published in PLOS One found that men and women misjudge what the opposite sex finds attractive. A research team in the United Kingdom asked 144 people — with an average age of 22 — to adjust a 3D model of a man’s or a woman’s face to match their appearance to find out what they believed the other gender finds the most attractive for both short- and long-term relationships.
