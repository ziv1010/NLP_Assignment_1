  "body_text": "Every confirmed WSL fixture at a major stadium in 2024/25\n- More WSL clubs are set to play to bigger crowds\n- Leicester and Aston Villa are based at major stadiums\n- Arsenal broke the league attendance record last season\nMore games than ever before are set to be played in major stadiums in the upcoming Barclays WSL campaign, as clubs continue to adapt to the growing popularity of the game.\nArsenal broke the WSL attendance record last season as they welcomed 60,160 people to the Emirates Stadium for their clash against Manchester United in February. The 2023/24 campaign in its entirety brought in 717,721 people across all games, surpassing the season before at 689,297.\nClubs have since recognised the need to give fans increased access to games as women's football continues to grow in popularity. Leicester City and Aston Villa will share their club's main stadium with the respective men's sides for every home league fixture, while Arsenal will play another eight WSL games at the Emirates Stadium and potentially at least three in the Champions League too.\nWhilst not every club has made the same commitment, they've certainly made the necessary arrangements to house more games at their major stadiums, thus playing a part to grow the game.\nChelsea\nChelsea have confirmed they will play three home games at Stamford Bridge, with the rest of their fixtures hosted at Kingsmeadow in Kingston upon Thames which has a capacity of 4,850.\nThe club's Champions League semi-final second leg against Barcelona last season was played in front of a sellout crowd at the Bridge, drawing in 39,398 people.\nStamford Bridge fixtures\n- Manchester City (17 November)\n- Arsenal (26 January)\n- Liverpool (11 May)\nManchester City\nLike Chelsea, City will host three WSL games at the club's major venue...the Etihad Stadium.\nThe rest of their fixtures will be played at the Joie Stadium across the street on the Etihad Campus, a 7,000-capacity facility used by the women's first-team and the men's Elite Development Squad.\nEtihad Stadium fixtures\n- Tottenham Hotspur (10 November)\n- Manchester United (19 January)\n- Chelsea (23 March)\nArsenal\nArsenal have set the standard when it comes to nurturing an engaged fanbase, drawing large crowds whenever they play at the Emirates Stadium and breaking records along the way.\nThe Gunners made history last season after back-to-back sellouts, taking their average league attendance to 31,428. Arsenal are current scheduled for 11 games at the Emirates in 2024/25, eight of which are in the WSL. Three others depend on qualifying for the Champions League group stage.\nMeadow Park, with a 4,500 capacity will host only three WSL home games: Crystal Palace, West Ham and Leicester City, which are among the least glamorous fixtures on the calendar.\nEmirates Stadium fixtures\n- Manchester City (22 September)\n- Everton (6 October)\n- Chelsea (12 October)\n- Brighton (10 November)\n- Aston Villa (8 December)\n- Tottenham (16 February)\n- Liverpool (23 March)\n- Manchester United (11 May)\nLiverpool\nThree of Liverpool's fixtures will be played at Anfield this season, but just as excitingly, all of their other home matches will be played at different, bigger venue, than in 2023/24.\nThe club confirmed earlier this year that they'd signed a ten-year lease to relocate from Prenton Park in Birkenhead, home of Tranmere Rovers, to the 18,000-capacity Totally Wicked Stadium in St Helens.\nAnfield fixtures\n- Manchester City (13 October)\n- Manchester United (16 March)\n- Everton (4 May)\nManchester United\nManchester United will play the majority of their home games at Leigh Sports Village, but have three fixtures set for Old Trafford, which has hosted WSL fixtures each season since 2020/21.\nMarc Skinner's team will open the season against West Ham, who have been the opponent twice before, but will be hoping for a very different outcome to the humiliating 6-0 club record defeat at the hands of Chelsea in the final game of last season.\n- West Ham (21 September)\n- Crystal Palace (16 February)\n- Manchester City (4 May)\nTottenham Hotspur\nSpurs created history at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last season, with a victory that saw them secure their spot in the FA Cup final.\nThe club will be hoping to recreate that magic again in the three fixtures they've scheduled to take place at the venue in 2024/25. Spurs will otherwise play their home matches at Brisbane Road, which has a much smaller capacity of 9,271.\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium fixtures\n- Arsenal (17 November)\n- Manchester United (2 February)\n- Chelsea (4 May)\nAston Villa\nAston Villa announced this summer that Villa Park will now host all of their WSL home games.\nWalsall's Poundland Bescot Stadium will serve as a secondary venue and host any remaining fixtures.\nVilla Park fixtures\n- Tottenham (29 September)\n- Leicester (13 October)\n- Liverpool (3 November)\n- Crystal Palace (17 November)\n- West Ham (15 December)\n- Manchester City (26 January)\n- Chelsea (2 February)\n- Everton (2 March)\n- Manchester United (23 March)\n- Arsenal (27 April)\n- Brighton (11 May)\nLeicester City\nSince 2021, Leicester have used the King Power Stadium as their primary home and that will see them play all 11 WSL home games this season at the famous venue.\nThe Foxes otherwise keep the Pirelli Stadium in Burton upon Trent as a back-up for potential clashes with the men's schedule, playing one league fixture there last season, as well as a couple of cup ties.\nKing Power Stadium fixtures\n- Arsenal (29 September)\n- Crystal Palace (6 October)\n- Everton (20 October)\n- Manchester United (17 November)\n- Chelsea (15 December)\n- Liverpool (26 January)\n- Aston Villa (16 February)\n- Brighton (23 March)\n- Tottenham (30 March)\n- Manchester City (27 April)\n- West Ham (11 May)\nEverton, Brighton, West Ham and Crystal Palace are yet to reveal which, if any, of their home fixtures will be played at their club's major stadium.\nAs it stands, Everton will play their home games at Walton Hall Park, West Ham at the Chigwell Construction Stadium and newly promoted Crystal Palace at the VBS Community Stadium. Meanwhile, Brighton are at the Broadfield Stadium in Crawley.",
