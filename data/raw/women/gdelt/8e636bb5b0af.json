  "body_text": "Hoes Mad\nHappy Gump Day: Extra Girthy Jumbo Package\nWhy are NFL cheerleaders on here? Read and find out...\nFans of 100% Blue Blood Basketball Program, Auburn, negged Aden Holloway for the last five months of the season, and he finally took his ball (quite literally), and went home. Or “home” — as in a team that knows how to use a point guard: welcome to Tuscaloosa!\nObviously, we’re happy about this. Barn fans are seething (despite thinking he’s trash). And Bruce Pearl is more than a little salty.\nBruce Pearl got in on the action Tuesday night, comparing the situation to the sport the state knows best — football. What if Auburn’s quarterback (maybe Payton Thorne?) decided to go play for Kalen DeBoer and Alabama? The hostility would certainly be there the Saturday after Thanksgiving.\nPearl believes something similar is in store due to Holloway’s transfer.\n“It would be like if Auburn’s quarterback went to play quarterback for Alabama,” Pearl said. “What do you think that would do for the Iron Bowl? It would make it more interesting and continue to add to the rivalry.”\nWant to read more about Aden Holloway, what made him a poor fit on the Plains, and what he offers the Tide this season (and especially next)? You’re in luck! Do I have a shameless plug for you!\nOne of America’s preeminent stalker of teenage boys, Bud Elliot, has dropped this year’s “Blue Chip” ratio.\nWhat is that? Here’s the long version:\nIn simple terms: To win the national championship, college football teams need to sign more four- and five-star recruits (AKA “Blue Chips”) than two- and three-star players over the previous four recruiting classes.\nThis has been consistently true since the advent of modern internet recruiting rankings. But, this is not to say that the Blue-Chip Ratio guarantees a national title, or even competing for one.\nThe requirement to stack talent on top of talent makes sense when considering the violent nature of football. Even teams which stay relatively healthy need depth to survive the season. Teams who sign elite class after elite class have greater competition in practice and greater quality of depth.\nRecruiting rankings are not perfect, but they are damn good, especially in the aggregate. Four- and five-star recruits are about 10 times more likely to be drafted in the first round of the NFL Draft than their two- and three-star counterparts. And five-stars are about 33 times more likely to be All-Americans as two-stars. For every two-star who becomes a big success, there are multiples who will be going pro in something other than sports. And they are getting better annually due to advancements in technology and data.\nThat is not to say that development does not matter. It certainly does. But nobody wins a national title by player development in lieu of elite recruiting. Plenty of coaches who are regarded as elite have never sniffed winning it all because they can’t accumulate enough talent. On the other hand, there are examples of coaches who are not regarded as premier head men who have won it all thanks to elite recruits. Not to lump them into the same category, but nobody ever accused Gene Chizik, Les Miles, Mack Brown or Ed Orgeron of being tactical masterminds.\nWant the shorter version?\nIt stands for the oh-so-controversial proposition that teams with more elite players tend to win titles over teams with less talent.\nShocking, I know. We’ve only had the phrase “Jimmies and Joes, not Xs and Os,” since the 60s.\nI won’t spoil the list for you, but:\n- Alabama is in the Top 3\n- Alabama is ahead of Georgia. Nick Saban is retired, and Kirby is still taking Ls to his daddy.\nIn the run-up to EA Sports College Football ‘25, the promo teams have started dropping little nuggets about the in-game mechanics...like homefield strength.\nIn college football, home-field advantage is everything.\nAsk any good team that has ever gone to Baton Rouge at night. Or to State College, Pa. for a “whiteout” game. Or to any of the myriad off-the-beaten-path locales that teams with championship aspirations have learned to fear—West Lafayette, Ind. or Corvallis, Ore., for instance.\nThis Top 25 list is based on recent performance, and 9 of the Top 25 are “real” SEC schools; add UT and OU, and almost half the list (including the Top 3, and four of the first five), are from God’s Country\nThe Crimson Tide? Second, if you’re curious.\nGotta’ love the feckless, rudderless NCAA. From NIL to trans athletes to the Rona, their entire approach has been to abdicate any sort of leadership on literally any issue, wait till a crisis has developed, let the damn thing blow up in their face, and then beg Congress for help...it is invitation that, so far, Article I has declined to accept.\nI expect this latest gambit will be no different:\n“This is a really hard question for schools to answer on their own for a whole bunch of reasons. The biggest one most schools have said to us is ... the rules around equity when it comes to Title IX and around men’s and women’s sports ought to be relatively consistent from school to school and conference to conference,” Baker said. “That’s going to require a national standard. If we create a national standard at the NCAA, the problem with that would be if anybody doesn’t like it one way or the other ... it would be challengeable in court.\nBaker is right: The issues around Title IX are manifest, both with the Administration’s awful, ill-considered “guidance” promulgated last month, and precisely how the looming issues of NIL and court-ordered settlements will fit into women’s athletics.\nThat’s going to be the next litigation frontier, for sure, but this turnip is already turning a little pale.\nSpeaking of...\nNow college football coaching staffs will have a new look in the 2024 season. The NCAA Division I Council voted Tuesday to expand college football coaching staffs, allowing an unlimited number of assistants to instruct athletes.\nAt its annual meetings in Indianapolis, the 40-person council representing all 32 Division I conferences moved to allow all staff members to provide technical and tactical instruction to athletes during practice and games. For years, analysts and quality control coaches have been limited to assisting off the field through watching film and providing expertise in creating gameday strategy.\nSure, why not. What’s the point of rules or parity anymore? The enshittification continues apace. I swear to God, the NCAA is doing everything in its power to hasten a Football-only split from the rest of the organization. Or, failing that, a Big 10/SEC departure.\nTexas is going to need to be kept in check\nSpeaking of SEC supremacy, Monday was a bit of a Sophie’s choice as two SEC programs squared off in the final game of the College World Series. Tennessee beat Aggie for their first title ever. But, the more interesting part is that almost as soon as the handshake line was complete, A&M coach Schlossnagle shagged ass from Aggieland to...Austin.\nHow it started:\nFollowing the loss to Tennessee on Monday, Schlossnagle was asked about whether he’d be leaving to take the Texas opening. He had a fiery retort.\n“I think it’s pretty selfish of you to ask me that question, to be honest with you. I left my family to be the coach at Texas A&M. I took the job at Texas A&M to never take another job again, and that hasn’t changed my mind,” Schlossnagle opened.\n“That’s unfair to talk about something like that. That would be like you asking [top MLB draft prospect Braden] Montgomery if he’s going to sign in the draft. But I understand you’ve got to ask the question. I gave up a big part of my life to come take this job, and I poured every ounce of my soul in this job and I gave this job every ounce I could possibly give it. Write that.”\nHow it’s going\nWhy does all of this matter? It’s the tampering, really.\nThe ‘Horns have long been doing this with players. But for this contract to get done less than 10 hours after a Game 3 loss in the CWS? Austin had to be up to some serious sketch.\nAnd this is going to be a problem too, as it’s a bit of a developing pattern. I fear Greg Sankey is too busy giving himself a self-congratulatory jerk and being blinded by UT money to actually enforce the all-for-one ethos that made our little backstabbing corner of the world a reality.\nThe ‘Horns have already been gifted a schedule from the gods this season, so it’s clear the SEC is trying to butter its bread by doing what multiple conferences have done over the last century — kiss Texas’s ass.\nI already hate them and what they’ve done to this place.\nEvergreen...fUT\nI hope Tony V is giving handjobs on BART next year for rent money, and the A’s lose 120 games. It’s a matter of when he heads to the Show, not if.\nNate Oats explains why being at a football school is actually good for the basketball program...and offers a tacit criticism:\n“I’ve sold to these guys, we’ve got the resources here to win at the highest level,” Oats continued. “If you understand college athletics, it’s actually a positive to be at a football school. Because some of these schools that are not football schools are going to struggle financially moving forward with what’s going on. I’ve been here five years, and five years ago I tried to make this point to some of these recruits: you’re going to have better facilities, we’re going to travel better, the nutrition better. Just go down the list of everything that’s going to be better, because we’ve got better resources for you here.”\nAlabama earlier this month unveiled plans for a $58 million expansion to its men’s basketball practice facility.\n“Now, maybe [Coleman Coliseum is] not packed every day like it is at some of these blue-bloods, but if we start [winning] — it is now that we’re winning,” Oats said. “You had to sell a vision back then. Now you see it. We’re actually better off being at Alabama than you would be at some tradition basketball powerhouse that doesn’t necessarily have the financial backing that we would here at Alabama, just because football is such a big deal.”\nIn the interview, Oats has two main points 1. He sells Alabama football money and name branding (which both trickles down and is obvious), and 2. provides a fairly gentle criticism of attendance.\nThe second part is especially interesting. Alabama had outstanding attendance last season — third in the conference. But there’s no reason that we should not have that shithole packed every night. So, dodge the potholes, steer clear of the toilet lupus, and get your #buttsinseats.\nI know, I know. Greg Byrne isn’t exactly making it a palatial venue or a fan-friendly experience, but we finally have what we’ve always wanted: a powerhouse Hoops program. Go support it.\nOutstanding interview by Aye Ell here with one of my all-time favorite players, Najee Harris.\nHere he is on Saban’s retirement:\nMore than three years after his last game in crimson and a few months after Saban’s retirement, Harris reflected on that decision.\n“I’m honest, like he made a comment to me, he made a comment before about it,” Harris said without elaborating. “Of course, it’s surprising but everybody has their time and nothing lasts forever. I’m happy that he could be able to walk away. Some people, you’d be surprised, it might be their time, but it’s too hard to walk away and they end up doing more stuff to affect them.\n“It takes a, it takes a grown man, a lot of responsibility to say, you know, this is not what I want to do no more. Something that you love, something that you built, something that you found success in something that, you know, you are going to be the greatest coach of all time in college football and then you chose to walk away.”\nPlenty more here:\nGet your popcorn ready\nOh, man...these wideouts are going to be soooo good. Assuming we have a quarterback that can get them the ball instead of panicking, running backwards 15 yards, and then falling on a bad snap. (You gotta respect the classics!)\n(WRC) Shephard got to the potential star of the room — the No. 8 overall prospect in 247 Sports’ 2024 high school class who enrolled in late May and has participated in summer workouts.\n“We got a lot of guys, but I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention Ryan Williams,” Shephard told Wimp and Barry Sanderson. “This kid come in Day 1, he’s running with the 4s and 5s with receivers and you can tell it’s just burning through his soul.\n“Guys, just remember. This kid should still be in high school right now, trying to get ready for a prom or something like that, OK? Alright? And right now, he’s here on campus.”\nShephard didn’t hold back on what he’s seen from Williams.\n“Guess what? Get your popcorn ready,” he told Tide 100.9. “Kid’s gonna be good.”\nShephard, who followed Kalen DeBoer from Washington, also discussed Washington transfer Germie Bernard and some of Alabama’s top returning receivers.\nSomehow, I don’t think we’re going to miss Isaiah Bond, y’all.\nHear me out: There is a really fun show called “America’s Sweethearts” — it’s a bit like the old Cowboys cheerleaders show that ran for 15 years or so, in that it is a docudrama production of making an NFL cheer camp. But Sweethearts is a far more candid, uncompromising view of the hell these girls go through, the low wages, the catty power plays, etc.\nWorth a watch.\nAnd it is especially worth the watch since the star of the show is a former ‘Bama dance team member — and her country mouse husband, a Crimson Chaos hellraiser and Baptist Minister from Andalusia.\nThey’re genuinely wholesome...which has everyone in Dallas flummoxed, and Basic White Girls everywhere swooning at how sweet they are.\nAs I (and many others) began to fall in love with Reece, we heard a story about the first boy she had ever dated.\nApparently Reece was raised in a conservative home and boys weren’t really on her radar, so to speak. However, when she met Will (a HUGE Tide basketball fan) while attending U of A, something just clicked.\nNow, Reece and Will (who you also see on the show) are husband and wife. They were married by Tuscaloosa pastor Taylor Morton from Valley View Baptist Church.\nThe thing that really stands out is Reece’s constantly positive attitude at all times on the show. If you know anything about the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders, you know about their director, Kelli Finglass.\nShe is like the drill instructor from “Full Metal Jacket”.\nSeriously, check it out. Everyone I know who’s seen it enjoys it. And, if nothing else, you can do far worse than spending an hour watching remarkably attractive, athletic women in white hot pants.\nAnd, finally...enjoy this sadly-true-but-dank meme about our coming AI overlords.\nThat’s it for now. We’ll be back later with some Conference Props for you. But for now, dig into this extra girthy and long Package.\nRoll Tide",
