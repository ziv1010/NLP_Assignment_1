I think [Saturday] will be very different. Manchester City have progressed massively, as have we.”\nManchester City vs Aston Villa\nWhen is kick off? Saturday 21 January, 11:30 (GMT)\nWhere is the match being played? Academy Stadium\nTV channel/live stream? Sky Sports Premier League (UK), FA Player (International)\nWhat time does coverage start in the UK? 11:00 (GMT)\nReferee? Cheryl Foster\nCan Chelsea avoid another upset against Liverpool?\nLiverpool stunned reigning champions Chelsea on the opening day of the campaign, with a pair of Katie Stengel penalties seeing the newly promoted Reds to a shock 2-1 victory.\nThe pair have experienced differing fortunes since, with Chelsea winning nine from 10 and Liverpool winning just one from eight. Chelsea have never lost at home in the WSL to a newly promoted side, with the only top flight newbies to take points off the Blues at Kingsmeadow being West Ham in 2018 - a side managed by Liverpool boss Matt Beard.\n\"We just need to respond after Sunday (losing 6-0 to Manchester United),\" said Beard. \"Chelsea have gone on a good run, had a great Champions League campaign as well. We've played them once, we've beaten them once, so we can take confidence from that day. But we need to make sure we give a good account of ourselves on Sunday.\"\nChelsea vs Liverpool\nWhen is kick off? Sunday 22 January 12:30 (GMT)\nWhere is the match being played? Kingsmeadow\nTV channel/live stream? BBC Two/BBC iPlayer/BBC Sport website (UK), Paramount+ (USA), FA Player (international)\nWhat time does coverage start? 12:15\nReferee? Paul Howard\nBattle of the top half high fliers\nEverton and West Ham both went into the 2022/23 campaign with new managers in the dugout in the shape of Brian Sorensen and Paul Konchesky. The pair have taken quickly to life in the top flight, with their sides level on points in fifth and sixth respectively after both picked up five wins in the first half of the season.\nNeither Sorensen nor Konchesky had managed in the WSL prior to this term - Konchesky had been former Hammers' boss Olli Harder's assistant coach, while Sorensen had exclusively worked in his native Denmark.\nBoth made their WSL managerial debuts against one another in the reverse fixture in September, with West Ham winning 1-0. The Hammers are attempting to complete a WSL double over Everton for the very first time.\n\"I think both teams have evolved over the season,\" said Sorensen. \"The style of play that we have, everybody is more on board with it now. Offensively it's getting much better, creating many more opportunities. I think West Ham has a little different approach - more ruthless in the way they look at things. For us it's about: can we keep the momentum?\"\nEverton vs West Ham\nWhen is kick off? Sunday 22 January 13:00 (GMT)\nWhere is the match being played? Walton Hall Park\nTV channel/live stream? FA Player (UK & International)\nReferee? Tom Nield\nMary Earps on the cusp of huge WSL milestone\nMary Earps will become the first goalkeeper in WSL history to reach 50 clean sheets if Manchester United are able to stop Reading from finding the net on Sunday.\nUnited are yet to concede a single league goal against anyone other than last season’s top three and Earps’ seven clean sheets in 10 games so far is the leading mark at this stage of the campaign.\nThe 29-year-old has been around the WSL since day one when the competition began in 2011 and has always been highly regarded. But it is in the last 18 months in particular that she has reached new levels, firmly establishing herself as world class – as underlined by her recent nomination for The Best FIFA Women’s Goalkeeper award for 2022.\nEarps deserves tremendous credit for United’s outstanding defensive record this season – currently tied with Arsenal as best in the WSL – having made several top saves throughout the course of the campaign on the few occasions that the back four in front of her has been breached.\n“She is laser focus,” United boss Marc Skinner said earlier this season. “Her athleticism, her focus…just that rock behind us. You notice in games, our keepers don’t do much, but when they do we need them to come big because every team will have a moment in a game.”\nReading vs Man Utd\nWhen is kick off? Sunday 22 January, 14:00 (GMT)\nWhere is the match being played? Madejski Stadium\nTV channel/live stream? FA Player (UK & International)\nReferee? Richie Watkins\nCan Leicester put together a winning run?\nLeicester secured their first WSL points of the season at the 10th time of asking against Brighton last weekend, running out 3-0 winners to potentially leave us with a real relegation battle on our hands.\nThe result leaves the Foxes just four points behind Brighton and Reading, and victory over an out of form Spurs - in the midst of a club record WSL losing streak of five on the bounce - on Sunday could leave Willie Kirk's side within touching distance of safety.\n\"It would be huge,\" Kirk said on the prospect of consecutive league victories. \"It would make a few other teams really uncomfortable if we were to pick up back-to-back wins and as much as our focus is on us, the reality of the situation is we want as many people dragged into that as possible. We know that if we can win on Sunday it can drag another team into that relegation battle.\"\nTottenham vs Leicester\nWhen is kick off? Sunday 22 January 14:00 (GMT)\nWhere is the match being played? Brisbane Road\nTV channel/live stream? FA Player (UK & International)\nReferee? Stacey Pearson\nWill January signings feature for Arsenal?\nArsenal have had one of the WSL's most exciting transfer windows, bringing in midfielders Victoria Pelova and Kathrine Kulh, as well as goalkeeper Sabrina D'Angelo.\nPelova is already a seasoned Netherlands international at the age of 23 and impressed against Arsenal for Ajax in the Champions League qualifiers at the beginning of the season, while Kuhl is a highly-rated teenage talent who particularly caught the eye in Denmark's narrow Euro 2022 group stage defeat to Spain.\nAll three were unused substitutes against Chelsea - Eidevall citing lack of training time since signing as a major factor - but could experience their first taste of WSL football against Brighton on Sunday.\n\"The way it works with registration and working permits and so on, these players have not had a lot of training with us,\" Eidevall said post-Chelsea. \"These players were only able to be registered here almost as a last minute thing for the game. It's always easy to be thinking about the game in retrospect but I thought we had control of the game and I didn't think there was any need to change.\"\nBrighton vs Arsenal\nWhen is kick off? Sunday 22 December, 18:45 (GMT)\nWhere is the match being played? Broadfield Stadium\nTV channel/live stream?
