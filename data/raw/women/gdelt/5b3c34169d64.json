  "body_text": "If Only Trump Would Tell Netanyahu What He Told Zelensky\nMarch 12, 2025\nI’m sure most readers have seen the fiery and angry dialogue between President Donald Trump and ex-Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office a few days ago. Trump admitted during the press conference that he let the conference continue as long as he did, knowing Zelensky would not like what Trump (and Vice President Vance) said and would become agitated and angry—which he did.\nTrump played Zelensky the way Benjamin Netanyahu plays Trump.\nSoon after the altercation in the White House, Trump announced he was suspending military aid to Ukraine.\nIt seems clear that Trump does indeed plan to put a stop to the war in Ukraine—without Russia returning any of the Ukrainian territories that voted to return to the Russian motherland, resulting in a genocidal campaign against them by Zelensky, and which Putin’s Special Military Operation has successfully liberated. And it’s also clear that the days at the helm in Ukraine for the corrupt and murderous Zelensky are numbered.\nIf only Trump would tell Israel’s corrupt and murderous Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu what he told Zelensky. But he never will. As with every president in modern memory, and the vast majority of the members of Congress in both parties, Trump is owned by the Israeli lobby.\nInstead of Trump showing Netanyahu the door the way he did Zelensky, when Netanyahu visited the White House, he was treated like a king. Here’s the video of Trump showing deference to Netanyahu in the White House as if Netanyahu was the U.S. president and Trump was his subordinate (which, of course, Trump is).\nNot only has Trump not demonstrated the slightest intention of stopping Israel’s genocidal ethnic cleansing of Gaza and the West Bank, but he has already taken steps to give Israel even more U.S. assistance in doing so.\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio has signed a declaration to expedite the delivery of approximately $4 billion in military assistance to Israel, calling President Donald Trump the Jewish state’s great ally, according to a statement released on Saturday.\nThe move is part of the White House’s broader effort to bolster Israel’s military capabilities amid ongoing regional tensions. Since Trump took office on January 20, his administration has reportedly approved nearly $12 billion in major foreign military sales to West Jerusalem.\nOn Friday, the Pentagon announced that the State Department had approved the potential sale of nearly $3 billion worth of bombs, demolition kits, and other weaponry to Israel. That emergency approval bypassed the usual congressional review process, marking the second instance in recent weeks of expedited arms sales to Israel amid a fragile ceasefire with Hamas militants – in a war that has already claimed over 1,700 Israeli and 62,000 Palestinian lives.\nIn May, Biden temporarily stopped deliveries of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel and announced that more weapons could be embargoed if the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) pressed ahead with an invasion of Rafah in southern Gaza. The IDF entered the city regardless, and Biden eventually lifted the temporary arms freeze.\nThe State Department praised the latest decision to reverse Biden’s “partial arms embargo” as “yet another sign that Israel has no greater ally in the White House than President Trump.” Secretary Rubio invoked emergency authority to fast-track this assistance, citing the national security interests of the United States.\nBe sure to take a look at the picture of Trump standing beside Netanyahu in the above report. I have never seen as big of a smile on Donald Trump’s face as in that photograph. He rarely smiles at all, much less smiling like a kid standing next to his favorite professional football player.\n“Citing the national security interests of the United States.” BARF!\nThe innocent, unarmed, starving people of Gaza are absolutely NO threat to the national security interests of the United States. NONE! NADA! ZERO! ZILCH!\nThis is all about what it’s always about: Israel.\nWriting in the Unz Review, Philip Giraldi wrote a column entitled Making America Great Is All About Israel. In his missive he wrote:\nWhile it may seem only symbolic, referring to the West Bank as “Judea and Samaria” is a clear show of support for Israeli annexation. Mike Huckabee, Trump’s nominee to serve as the US ambassador to Israel, also refers to the West Bank using the same language and has said annexation is possible under the new Trump administration.\nEarlier this month, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas also reintroduced a bill that would require the use of the term “Judea and Samaria” in all official US documents.\nRepresentative Claudia Tenney of New York also introduced the identical legislation in the House and maintained that “the Israeli people have an undeniable and indisputable historical and legal claim over Judea and Samaria.”\nCongress and the White House have clearly become Israeli Occupied territory as Pat Buchanan once colorfully described the US government.\nAnd there is more, lots more, but some of the developments are more interesting because they are impacting domestically on the United States and on the constitutional liberties and rights that are under siege as the Israel Lobby and Team Trump seek to suppress any criticism of the Jewish state and/or of the illegal activities carried out by its supporters through their corruption of government at all levels in the United States.\nMy favorite line spewed out regularly by both Democrats and Republicans is some version of the assertion that Israel is somehow a wonderful “democracy that is America’s best friend and closest ally.” Attorney General Pam Bondi went over the top when she called Israel “our greatest ally in the world” in an interview with Fox News. Interestingly, apartheid war criminal Israel is in fact neither a democracy nor a friend nor an ally but when the blind are leading the blind anything might well pop out of one’s mouth, particularly when it is not connected to a functioning brain that actually has a conscience.\nOver at the FBI effusive comments also seem to be the general rule with Dan Bongino, the newly appointed Deputy Director of the FBI, when responding to a question about what might be the causes that are dear to his heart, stating, “Israel. Defense of Israel.” His comment reflects a broad commitment within the FBI and Justice Department to prioritize relations with Israel, as echoed by FBI Director Kash Patel, who affirmed that “America will prioritize Israel, and we stand by our number one ally.” Nice one Kash! Is that really your first name or just a pseudonym? Maybe you should be looking into the various internationally binding agreements entered into with the US guaranteeing the arrangements that are being violated by Israel in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza? They are war crimes and Washington is complicit.\nIn a recent interview with Judge Andrew Napolitano, Journalist Max Blumenthal, who is himself Jewish, said the following:\nWe’ve just learned that the Israeli defense minister, Israel Katz, considered authorizing bombing the funeral of Hassan Nasrallah, where thousands—hundreds of thousands—of unarmed people were mourning a late leader without weapons. They were in a stadium in Beirut. And Israel instead conducted a F-16 flyover, threatening that crowd. It’s just basically a terror apparatus with a parliament.\nAnd the idea that it was even considered to do that demonstrates the impunity that Israel enjoys in Washington, along with the rest of Netanyahu’s comments that they’ve just simply stolen Mount Hermon in violation of a 1973 U.N. agreement. They just stole the highest point in Syria and are setting up ski slopes there. They’ve stolen a large segment of southern Syria, thanks in large part to the NATO/CIA-backed regime change operation that has seen the rebranded form of al-Qaeda take power in Damascus, which hasn’t fired a single shot against Israel. But they’re just taking it. And the United States has nothing to say about it. There’s no problem there.\nOf course, the U.S. freaked out after a referendum of Crimeans voted for the annexation by Russia. The U.S. threw a tantrum at the U.N. and issued sanctions on Russia and began marching towards the Ukraine proxy war. But here Israel is allowed to steal all that it wants.\nNapolitano: The same government that stopped you at Dulles. The president took an AI-generated clip mocking the turning of Gaza into Trump Gaza Riviera. Was that played in Israel?\nBlumenthal: Well, everyone’s talking about it. It’s all the rage in the Israeli media. I think it’s generating lots of amusement in Israel. It really needs to be seen to believe, to be understood. There are images of bearded men with women’s bodies belly dancing on the ruins of Gaza. Elon Musk is throwing money. The showering children on the beaches of Gaza with money. There are golden coasts and buildings resembling those in Dubai rising up as Donald Trump hams it up shirtless on the beach, toasting Netanyahu. They’ve taken control of the Gaza Strip after the Holocaust we’ve just witnessed. And a golden statue of Donald Trump rises in the center of Gaza City.\nIt is a satanic video that many commenters are describing as also kind of anti-Christian. Kind of anti-Christian in that it resembles something that the antichrist would do.\nIndeed.\nHere is the “satanic,” “anti-Christian,” “antichrist” video clip Max referenced.\nThe Government Rag Intelligence Report released a brief exposé of the “satanic” video above, entitled: TRUMP’S GAZA PAGAN IDOLATRY WITHOUT PRECEDENT:\nTrump’s proposal [for the U.S. to ethnically cleanse and occupy Gaza] was met with global criticism by both lawmakers and analysts who fear the plan would forcibly displace Gaza’s population of two million, while US critics wondered if the President’s vision would plunge the nation into the potentially bloody role of occupying power.\nBut late Tuesday night, Trump seemed to further promote the plan by posting a 35-second video to his Truth Social account that began with the question: ‘Gaza 2025: What’s Next?’\nThe AI-generated video, in a series of bold, gaudy images, shows a new Trump hotel, a giant golden statue of Trump, and a child holding a Trump balloon among resplendent beach front resort complexes.\nThat any Christian supports this idolater escapes me.\nMe too.\nDuring the joint White House press conference with Zelensky, Trump boldly stated that he intended to stop the U.S. flow of money into Ukraine and use it for “other things.” But as he made that statement, he almost let slip out what he really intended to do with the money: send it to Israel to further augment its military aggression in the Middle East—as he has already indicated by delivering over $12 billion of military aid to Israel in just his first month in office, as I previously noted.\nIf only Trump would tell Netanyahu what he told Zelensky.\nReprinted with permission from Chuck Baldwin Live.",
