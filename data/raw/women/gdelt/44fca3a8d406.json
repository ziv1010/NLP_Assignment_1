  "body_text": "Valley News Live Poll: Do you support the $140 million dollar Fargodome expansion?\nFARGO, N.D. (Valley News Live) - Voters in the City of Fargo will be deciding on whether a major renovation and expansion project on the FARGODOME moves forward. It will come with a tax increase, but the city and FARGODOME Authority both say it will hopefully come with big benefits to the local and state economy.\nVoters will head to the polls on Tuesday, December 5, to decide whether to increase sales and lodging taxes to fund a FARGODOME remodel and the addition of a 90,000-square-foot conference center. The remodel would improve and expand accessibility, add restrooms, enhance circulation, as well as create more concessions and seating options at the city-owned venue that recently had its 30-year anniversary.\nA special election is planned for Tuesday, Dec. 5, with polls open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Residents can vote at any of three polling locations: the FARGODOME, the Fargo Civic Center, or the Ramada Inn (formerly Doublewood Inn) at 3333 13th Ave. S. Residents can also submit absentee ballots.\nSixty percent of voters must approve the tax increases for them to pass. If passed, there would be an additional 0.25% sales tax (e.g., 25 cent sales tax on a $100 purchase) and an additional 3% lodging tax on hotel and motel rooms. This would raise Fargo sales tax to 7.75%. Taxes on a lodging expense in Fargo would increase to 13.75%. Both taxes would have 20-year terms for collection, starting April 1, 2024, and ending March 31, 2044.\nConstruction on the project would start in the winter of 2024. The project is estimated to cost $140 million, with $30 million coming from the FARGODOME’s permanent fund and the rest funded by the proposed tax increases.\nHome to NDSU Bison football, superstar concerts, and regional sporting events, the FARGODOME has become a staple of north Fargo, hosting about 3,000 events and 14 million guests over the last 30 years. But General Manager Rob Sobolik says the decades-old building is in need of an upgrade.\n“This is focusing on improving and enhancing the accessibility of the building whether it’s seating, press box areas, restroom space,” explains Sobolik.\nSobolik says they are increasing the number of women’s restroom stalls from 134 to 262 and the number of men’s restroom stalls from 133 to 190. Accessible seating and companion seats will increase from the current 43 to a proposed 112. Accessible seating will also be distributed throughout all seating areas.\nThe FARGODOME Authority says the concourse expansion will allow more food and beverage options, ‘elbow room’ for people to move around, and hopefully cut down on lines for both concessions and bathrooms.\nSobolik adds, “More circulation space, just social space, get around the concourse and go to different areas.”\nPlanners are also re-thinking where the main entrance of the FARGODOME could be. A 12,000-square-foot expansion will be added on the west side of the building, stretching to Albrecht Boulevard. This will include a plaza and lobby space, much like what is on the east side of the building and currently considered the main lobby.\n“I think it’s important to point out that right now, this will not have any large parking impacts on the existing events or future events,” says Sobolik.\nThe FARGODOME isn’t actually gaining any additional seating. Officials say this proposal focuses on the amenities, convenience and improving the customer experience. The dome remodel will add about 110,000-square-feet at a price tag of $85 million to $90 million dollars.\nCopyright 2023 KVLY. All rights reserved.",
