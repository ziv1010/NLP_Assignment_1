  "body_text": "It was another action-packed weekend for Nigerian players across Europe and beyond, defined by historic milestones, debut goals and decisive moments, as Victor Osimhen reached his 200th career goal and Joy Omewa made an instant impact in England. OLAMIDE ABE writes\nSUNDAY\nTurkey\nVictor Osimhen (Galatasaray)\nOsimhen reached a defining milestone on Sunday, becoming a 200-goal forward as Galatasaray eased past Kayserispor in the Turkish Super Lig.\nThe Nigeria striker doubled his side’s advantage in a commanding performance, underlining his standing as one of Africa’s most prolific forwards of his generation.\nThe strike took him to 200 career goals for club and country, achieved across 336 senior appearances, alongside 51 assists. At club level alone, he has scored 165 goals in 284 matches, with his most productive spells coming at SSC Napoli and Galatasaray.\nA breakdown of his club output shows 76 goals in 133 games for Napoli, 51 in 61 matches for Galatasaray, 18 for LOSC Lille, 20 for Royal Charleroi SC and a modest return during his early spell at VfL Wolfsburg. For Nigeria, he has scored 35 goals in 51 appearances, reinforcing his status as the country’s leading marksman of the modern era.\nThe weekend goal also extended a remarkable run, having recently become the fastest player to reach 50 goals for Galatasaray. Beyond scoring, Osimhen provided an assist before being withdrawn in the 82nd minute, as Mauro Icardi later sealed the win from the penalty spot.\nEngland\nJoy Omewa (Nottingham Forest Women)\nOmewa announced herself to English football in emphatic fashion, scoring on her debut for Forest Women despite a heavy defeat. The Super Falcons forward found the net in Forest’s 5-1 loss to Birmingham City in the Women’s Super League 2.\nOmewa, who joined from Danish side Fortuna Hjørring earlier in the week, drew Forest level shortly before half-time after showing composure to beat her marker and finish calmly. Although the visitors eventually pulled away, her goal stood out as a positive moment on a difficult afternoon.\nThe strike continued an extraordinary scoring streak, with Omewa now having found the net in 15 of her last 16 league matches. Her movement and attacking awareness offered Forest supporters early encouragement ahead of their next fixture against Charlton on February 8, before a possible mid-February departure for WAFCON duty.\nOla Aina (Nottingham Forest)\nAina produced a disciplined defensive display as Nottingham Forest, reduced to ten players, held Crystal Palace to a draw. The Nigeria defender was heavily involved, recording seven defensive contributions, winning eight of 10 ground duels and completing all three of his aerial contests.\nAina also made eight recoveries and four clearances, which underlines his importance as Forest absorbed pressure for long spells. Despite conceding territory, his work rate and positioning helped Forest emerge with a valuable point.\nChristantus Uche (Crystal Palace)\nUche featured from the bench in the same encounter at the oppositing team of Aina, making his 12th league appearance of the season.\nThe midfielder completed half of his passes, attempted one shot and covered close to 30 metres in ball carries during his brief outing.\nUche is yet to register a goal or assist in the league despite being in good form for the London club in Europe, averaging 14 minutes per league appearance, but continues to gain experience at top-flight level.\nIwobi, Chukwueze, Bassey (Fulham)\nAlex Iwobi was heavily involved despite Fulham’s late heartbreak against Manchester United. Playing the full match, the midfielder completed 96 per cent of his 75 passes, created two key chances and registered an expected assists figure of zero point 27.\nIwobi covered significant ground in possession, recording 34 carries and more than 255 metres in total carrying distance. His influence in midfield remained evident even as Fulham conceded a dramatic late winner.\nSamuel Chukwueze on the other hand was given a surprise start by Marco Silva, just three days after the loss of his mother, and delivered an energetic performance before being withdrawn.\nHe completed five dribbles, created one key pass and was unfortunate to see a goal ruled out for offside. Despite Fulham’s defeat, his willingness to take on defenders and stretch play stood out, particularly in the first half as the hosts sought to break down Manchester United’s defence.\n2024/25 Fulham’s Player of The Season, Calvin Bassey, was introduced late as Fulham attempted to salvage a draw in the closing stages.\nAlthough the plan ultimately failed, his inclusion highlighted the trust placed in him during high-pressure moments.\nItaly\nBabajide, Oladipo (AS Roma Women)\nBabajide delivered a dramatic late intervention in Italy, rescuing a point for AS Roma Women with a stoppage-time equaliser against Parma.\nComing off the bench in the 59th minute, the Super Falcons winger headed home in the ninth minute of added time to secure a 3-3 draw.\nThe goal was Babajide’s third for Roma and her first league strike since her Serie A debut earlier in the season.\nIt also preserved Roma’s seven-match unbeaten league run, keeping them top of the Serie A Femminile table with 29 points, five clear of Inter.\nHer compatriot Shukurat Oladipo started in defence for Roma, continuing her regular involvement at the back. Roma next face AC Milan as they aim to consolidate their position at the summit.\nMexico\nTaiwo Lawal (Mazatlán)\nIn Mexico, Lawal continued her fine scoring form for Mazatlán FC, netting again in a 5-0 victory over Necaxa.\nThe Super Falcons prospect scored the third goal of the match, taking her tally to five goals for the season.\nShe remains Mazatlán’s leading scorer, one goal clear of Abigail López, although the club sit 11th in the table with 10 points.\nAttention now turns to a clash with Pachuca, where Lawal is set to face fellow Nigeria forward Chinwendu Ihezuo.\nSATURDAY\nEngland\nArthur Okonkwo (Wrexham)\nOkonkwo continued his impressive run with Wrexham, keeping a clean sheet in a 1-0 away win over Sheffield Wednesday.\nThe goalkeeper has now recorded seven clean sheets in 27 matches, backed by 77 saves across the campaign.\nWrexham sit sixth in the Championship table, occupying a promotion play-off spot, and have lost just one of their last nine games, with Okonkwo’s consistency proving vital to their momentum.\nItaly\nRafiu Durosinmi (Pisa)\nDurosinmi made an immediate impact off the bench for Pisa, providing the assist for their only goal in a 3-1 defeat to Sassuolo.\nIntroduced at the start of the second half, he needed just five minutes to influence proceedings.\nIt was his first assist for the club since joining from Czech Republic and his second goal contribution overall, following his debut goal against Atalanta. While Pisa fell short, Durosinmi’s sharpness once again caught the eye.\nHis compatriot Ebenezer Akinsanmiro was an unused substitute in the same match, remaining on the bench throughout. His involvement remains limited for since AFCON return, but his presence continues to underline Pisa’s growing Nigerian contingent.",
