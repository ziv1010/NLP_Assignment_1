  "body_text": "Good morning. A new public accounts committee report has found that disability benefit claimants are receiving “unacceptably poor service” from the government, waiting on average 10 times longer than other claimants for their calls to be answered. Meanwhile, rising DWP underpayments are leaving many at greater risk of hardship.\nFor the past year, the Labour party has taken a contradictory approach to social security. It wants to move away from the harshness of austerity, yet its rhetoric remains rooted in pledges to be “ruthless” in cutting the “spiralling” benefits bill and prioritising “working people”. Campaigners and charities warn that much of this language echoes the punitive “welfare crackdowns” of previous governments.\nFor today’s newsletter, I spoke with Guardian columnist, and author of Crippled: austerity and the demonisation of disabled people, Frances Ryan and social policy editor Patrick Butler about what this report reveals about the government’s stance on disability benefits. That’s right after the headlines.\nFive big stories\n-\nUS news | Investigators recovered the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from the airplane involved in Wednesday night’s midair collision with a US military helicopter that killed all 67 people onboard both aircraft. The crash has raised questions over whether understaffing in an air traffic control tower played a role in the United States’ worst aviation disaster in years.\n-\nIsrael-Gaza war | Three Israelis and five Thai citizens held in Gaza have been freed, as Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy met hostages’ relatives, reportedly telling them he was optimistic the ceasefire would hold to allow the return of all the living and the dead.\n-\nUK news | An “epidemic of violence against women and girls” in the UK is getting worse despite years of government promises and strategies, a highly critical report from Whitehall’s spending watchdog has said.\n-\nDenmark | Almost half of Danish people now consider the US to be a considerable threat to their country and the overwhelming majority oppose Greenland leaving to become part of the US, new polling has found.\n-\nHealth | A “groundbreaking” £1.65m treatment offering a potential cure for people in England living with sickle cell disease has been approved for use on the NHS, the medicines watchdog has announced.\nIn depth: ‘You are completely dependent on an organisation that isn’t doing its job’\n“Any difficulty people are experiencing now isn’t new,” says Frances. “It comes after over a decade of incredibly tough, impoverishing years.” Fourteen years of cost-cutting benefits policies under successive Conservative governments have left disability benefit claimants facing significant hardship. But does Labour have a plan to remedy the problem?\nWhy is it hard to get someone on the phone?\nThe issues raised in the public accounts committee report have been around for years without being properly addressed. One key factor behind the long wait times is the DWP’s shift to a digital-first system, which has proved challenging for those without reliable internet access.\n“A lot of claimants can’t easily use digital communication, so they resort to traditional methods like the telephone – which, of course, requires people to answer,” says Patrick. “But, like all large bureaucracies, the DWP is under immense pressure to cut staff, so fixing this issue won’t be quick or easy.”\nAI and automation promise a system that runs without human administrators, but no matter how advanced the technology, “you still need to make qualitative judgments about a person’s entitlement to disability benefits,” Patrick adds.\nThe public accounts committee also highlights another problem: the complexity and length of the application process, particularly for personal independence payments (Pip), claimed by 3.6 million people nationwide. Many of these people are trying to get assistance to apply which extends wait times further. Disability campaigners note that for vulnerable claimants, the lack of support makes an already difficult process even harder.\nThe impact\nWhen people are unable to access the welfare they are entitled to, it can be “crushing”, says Frances. The financial hardship that follows means disabled people are more likely to rely on food banks and be pushed into desititution. But these barriers have wider ripple effects, too, particularly on claimants’ mental health. Research by the disability charity Sense found that almost half of people with complex disabilities say the benefits application process is so stressful that it worsens their condition.\n“It’s hard to grasp unless you’ve been reliant on state support just how vulnerable and powerless you can feel,” Frances says. “All you can do is get on the phone and desperately ask for help.” In many cases, these benefits are the primary way that people are able to pay for essentials like food, energy and the extra costs of disability. “You are completely dependent on an organisation that isn’t doing its job, and you have almost no power to change that,” she adds.\nThe government’s stance\nDuring the election campaign, Keir Starmer pledged to “never turn our backs on people who are struggling”. However, his approach to tackling poverty focuses on moving more people into work and reducing reliance on benefits – ultimately cutting the welfare bill rather than increasing financial support for those that need it.\n“The Treasury is making it clear that fiscal discipline will take priority over anything else,” says Patrick. The controversial decision to means-test the winter fuel allowance reflects the government’s willingness to stick with divisive measures to meet its financial targets.\nAnother looming issue is the planned £3bn cut to incapacity benefits. The Treasury has confirmed that these reductions – introduced by the previous government – will proceed, with changes set to take effect from September. A judge recently ruled that an official consultation setting out the proposals was misleading and unlawful. The quickest way to make such large-scale cuts is through “crude reductions in eligibility”, Patrick explains. “Fewer people will qualify, and those already claiming will see their entitlements shrink.” This could mean more than 400,000 incapacity benefit claimants losing £416 a month. “At that point,” Patrick warns, “you’re effectively driving people into poverty – or even deeper into it.”\nThis mix of compassionate rhetoric and harsh policy choices risks making the government seem “wildly disingenuous,” Frances says. “If nobody really knows what your principles or intentions are, it only fuels the deep distrust people already feel – understandably – towards politicians.”\nFraud crackdown\nThe DWP has often pointed to fraud as a key reason why they have not been able to properly address the issue of underpayments. And there is a kernel of truth to this. Since the pandemic there has been an increase in benefits fraud. However, disability benefit fraud has remained about 1%, and rather than lazy individuals sponging off the state, much of the rise is actually due to organised crime groups exploiting weaknesses in the digital universal credit system. The public accounts committee has criticised what it called the department’s “dangerous mindset”, insisting that its priority should be to “improve its defences and ensure benefit claimants receive the right amount of money” rather than penalising individuals in need.\nFrances also highlights how the government often conflates fraud with error, making them seem interchangeable when they are fundamentally different. Errors can result from claimants unintentionally failing to report a change in circumstances or from mistakes made by the DWP itself.\n“This government talks a lot about not abandoning people on disability or incapacity benefits,” says Patrick. “But the problem is that so much of this is framed around getting people off benefits to make cuts,” which will likely only make peoples quality of life worse.\nWhat else we’ve been reading\n-\nOliver Wainwright took a mosy round the UK’s biggest toy fair – apparently the future is collectible bugs in fake Chinese takeaway and weird toilet/head figurines. Kids, eh? Toby Moses, head of newsletters\n-\nHannah Ellis-Petersen’s dispatch from Prayagraj lays out what led to the crowd crush at the Kumbh Mela – the largest religious gathering in the world – and why the festival continues despite 30 fatalities.

Our intrepid reporter takes on the man bag challenge to see if he can pull off the look being sported by everyone from the star of Wonka to Pharrell Williams. Toby\n-\nIt’s the 60th anniversary of James Brown’s Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag, so Alexis Petridis did what we all wanted him to do: rank the forefather of funk’s best albums. Nimo\n-\nClaes Bang is on fine form in our reader interview, talking about playing Dracula, working with Jagger and having to live with a rather unfortunate nickname from his time in Bad Sisters: “It happened last summer in Copenhagen at a music festival. Someone came running after me and said: ‘Hey, you’re the prick, aren’t you?’ Thanks, Sharon Horgan.” Toby\nSport\nFootball | Second-half goals by Diogo Dalot and Kobbie Mainoo helped Manchester United see off Steaua 2-0 and ease into the last 16 of the Europa League. They were joined by Tottenham, after a young Spurs side left it late to eventually defeat Swedish side Elfsborg 3-0, offering some respite for manager Ange Postecoglou. Rangers claimed the eighth and final direct place in the last 16 with a nervy 2-1 win over their Belgian visitors Union SG at Ibrox.\nIce skating | The figure skating world united in grief after it emerged as many as 14 skaters and coaches, including two 16-year-olds and a married pair of world champions, were onboard the American airlines plane that crashed into the Potomac river in Washington DC on Wednesday night.\nCricket | England are not ones for “reining it in” with the bat according to Ben Duckett, the opener defending his side’s six-hitting approach as they attempt to launch a comeback in the five-match Twenty20 international series against India.\nThe front pages\nMost of today’s front pages feature images of sixties icon Marianne Faithfull, who died aged 78, including the Guardian, whose lead story is “Watchdog: women face an epidemic of violence”, on a report from the National Audit Office.\ni leads on “Treat patients at home to prevent bed blocking, Streeting tells health bosses”. The Financial Times reports “Headwinds and stagnating growth drive ECB to quarter point rate cut”. The Times says “Legal chief ‘is freezing policy’”, while the Telegraph has “Tenth of farmland axed for net zero”. The Mirror splashes with “Shameful”, on anger at US President Donald Trump blaming diversity hiring for the deadly aircraft crash near Washington DC.\nSomething for the weekend\nOur critics’ roundup of the best things to watch, read, play and listen to right now\nMusic\nSharon Van Etten and the Attachment Theory | ★★★★☆\nAn act of “total collaboration” from an artist previously thought of as an auteur, Van Etten’s new album presents her not as a solo artist but the frontwoman of a band. There are big choruses and lovely melodies that speak to Van Etten’s songwriting craftsmanship, but the overall mood is both hazy and a little tense. That feels fitting. These are songs filled with confusion and foreboding, which leave questions unanswered: “Do you believe in compassion for enemies?” “Who wants to live for ever?” “Why can’t you see it from the other side?” Bold and fresh, this is not a complete reinvention so much as an unexpected left turn that takes the artist at its centre somewhere new. Alexis Petridis\nFilm\nBefore Sunrise | ★★★★★\nNot a romcom, not a romantic drama, but just … a romance, a brief encounter on a train without heartache, a strange and wonderful moment-by-moment miracle that never seems cloying or absurd. Richard Linklater’s film from 1995 is now rereleased for its 30th anniversary. The goateed and sweetly conceited twentysomething Jesse, played by Ethan Hawke, is on a train to Vienna when the smart and beautiful Céline, insouciantly played by Julie Delpy, sits down opposite him and they start talking. You can feel Jesse’s heart-thumping nerves as he suggests to Céline that she forget about her plans to go to Paris and instead get off the train with him to hang out in Vienna for 24 hours. It is the lightness of this film which is still charming; Jesse and Céline are free from everything, free from work worries or family cares, but they are also free from the gravity of cause-and-effect, the world of consequences and responsibilities. They bounce and float around the streets of Vienna like astronauts of love. Peter Bradshaw\nTV\nMo season two | ★★★★★\nThe self-starring, semi-autobiographical vehicle of comic Mo Amer, the series was last on Netflix back in 2022. Its opening season introduced us to Mo Najjar, a refugee who – like the real-life Mo – had arrived in Houston, Texas, as a child when his Palestinian family fled the Gulf war. An immigration raid spooks Mo’s boss at a phone store, leaving him jobless and forced to sell knockoff goods out of his car. By the final episode, Mo is stranded in Mexico, trying to outrun a people-smuggling coyote gang. It’s in Mexico that season two begins, with Mo living it up as a lucha libre wrestler and playing with a mariachi band in scenes that have more than a touch of magical realism. Of course, he’s actually living in a world of pain, marooned in Mexico with no legal route to return to the US for his crucial asylum hearing. It’s here that Amer highlights the horrifying reality of illegal border crossings and the desperate people who attempt them. It’s surely one of the most heart-rending things you’ll watch on TV this year. Hannah J Davies\nBook\nThe City Changes Its Face by Eimear McBride\nEimear McBride does extraordinary things with language. It is the 1990s, north London, an area dirtier and poorer than it is now. Eily, a teenage drama student, and Stephen, an established actor with a traumatic past, have been living together. Something awful has happened. In the sections headed Now they are having an agonised conversation about that event. They move from pleas and accusations to a row, followed by penitence and confessions and, at last, a reconciliation. This book-long conversation is interspersed with retrospective sections in which we are shown, in scattered episodes, how they arrived at this point. As the two narratives converge on the awful event, its nature is gradually revealed. The event is easily guessed, but there is more to it, the final twist having as much to do with McBride’s narrative form as it does with her story. It’s a complex structure, skilfully controlled. But McBride’s originality is most striking in the way she handles words. Lucy Hughes-Hallett\nToday in Focus\nHow DeepSeek stunned the AI industry\nWhy is the US technology industry worried about Chinese company DeepSeek? Robert Booth reports.\nCartoon of the day | Ben Jennings\nThe Upside\nA bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad\nMove over, wild swimming: here’s ice diving, which was launched as a leisure activity a few decades ago but has found new life in a 21st century not short of people looking for extreme ways to experience nature. Mike MacEacheran chills the bones with his account of a night dive in a frozen mountain lake in the French Alps – but he draws out the mind-stretching potential of the activity, too. The key element is accessibility: no experience is necessary, though divers must be 140cm tall or more and at least eight years old, the oldest so far being an 83-year-old woman. “Time slows in this magical, watery world,” he writes. “It’s one of those rare moments in life … that seem to transcend the ordinary.”\nSign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday\nBored at work?\nAnd finally, the Guardian’s puzzles are here to keep you entertained throughout the day. Until Monday.",
