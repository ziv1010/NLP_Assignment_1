The network’s just announced schedule includes premiere dates for three new reality shows: Bubby Games with Josh Duhamel, Loteria Loca hosted by Jaime Camil, and Raid the Cage.\nThe upcoming fall season will feature new extended episodes (90 minutes instead of 60) of Survivor and The Amazing Race. The fall primetime lineup will also include Paramount Network’s Yellowstone season one, which originally debuted back in June 2018. CBS is also serving up reruns of Blue Bloods, Fire Country, NCIS, FBI, Young Sheldon, and Ghosts (the original UK version).\nParamount+’s FBI True and SEAL Team make their CBS debut this fall, filling in timeslots left vacant as the result of the writers and actors strikes. 60 Minutes will kick off season 56 on September 17 and season 36 of 48 Hours premieres on September 16.\nCBS 2023 FALL PREMIERE DATES\nSATURDAY, SEPT. 2\n7:30-11:00 PM COLLEGE FOOTBALL ON CBS: TEXAS TECH at WYOMING\nSATURDAY, SEPT. 9\n7:30-11:00 PM COLLEGE FOOTBALL ON CBS: UCLA at SAN DIEGO STATE\nTHURSDAY, SEPT. 14\n8:00-9:00 PM BIG BROTHER (Live Show)\n9:00-10:00 PM BUDDY GAMES (CBS Series Debut)\n10:00-11:00 PM THE CHALLENGE: USA\nSATURDAY, SEPT. 16\n8:00-9:00 PM NCIS (Encore Episode)\n9:00-11:00 PM 48 HOURS (36th Season Premiere – Two Back-to-Back Episodes)\nSUNDAY, SEPT. 17\nNFL on CBS Football Doubleheader*\n7:30-8:30 PM* 60 MINUTES (56th Season Premiere)\n8:30-10:30 PM* YELLOWSTONE (CBS Broadcast Run Starts with Season One, from Paramount Network)\n10:30 PM-11:30 PM BIG BROTHER\nSATURDAY, SEPT. 23\n7:30-11:00 PM “BIG TEN ON CBS” COLLEGE FOOTBALL: IOWA at PENN STATE\nSUNDAY, SEPT. 24\n7:00-8:00 PM 60 MINUTES\n8:00-10:00 PM YELLOWSTONE (Two Back-to-Back Episodes)\n10:00-11:00 PM BIG BROTHER\nMONDAY, SEPT. 25\n8:00-11:00 PM NCIS 20th Anniversary Mini-Marathon (OTO)\nWEDNESDAY, SEPT. 27\n(Full Season of 90-Minute Episodes)\n8:00-9:30 PM SURVIVOR (45th Season Premiere, NTP)\n9:30-11:00 PM THE AMAZING RACE (35th Season Premiere, NTP)\nFRIDAY, SEPT. 29\n8:00-10:00 PM FIRE COUNTRY (Two Encore Episodes Back-to-Back)\n10:00-11:00 PM Classic BLUE BLOODS Episodes\nMONDAY, OCT. 2\n8:00-9:00 PM THE PRICE IS RIGHT AT NIGHT (OTO)\n9:00-10:00 PM LOTERÍA LOCA (CBS Series Debut)\n10:00-11:00 PM NCIS (Encore Episode)\nTUESDAY, OCT. 3\n8:00-9:00 PM BIG BROTHER (NTP)\n9:00-10:00 PM FBI TRUE (Broadcast Debut, from Paramount+)\n10:00-11:00 PM FBI (Encore Episode, NTP)\nMONDAY, OCT. 9\n8:00-9:00 PM THE PRICE IS RIGHT AT NIGHT (OTO)\n9:00-10:00 PM LOTERÍA LOCA\n10:00-11:00 PM NCIS (Encore Episode)\nFRIDAY, OCT. 13\n8:00-9:00 PM THE PRICE IS RIGHT AT NIGHT (NTP)\n9:00-10:00 PM RAID THE CAGE (CBS Series Debut)\n10:00-11:00 PM Classic BLUE BLOODS Episodes\nTHURSDAY, NOV. 2\n8:00-9:00 PM BIG BROTHER\n9:00-9:30 PM YOUNG SHELDON (Encore Episode – OTO)\n9:30-10:00 PM GHOSTS (Encore Episode – OTO)\n10:00-11:00 PM SEAL TEAM (Returns to CBS with Season Five, from Paramount+)\nFRIDAY, NOV. 3\n8:00-9:00 PM LET’S MAKE A DEAL PRIMETIME (NTP)\n9:00-10:00 PM RAID THE CAGE\n10:00-11:00 PM Classic BLUE BLOODS Episodes\nSATURDAY, NOV. 4\n7:30-11:00 PM “SEC ON CBS” COLLEGE FOOTBALL: GAME OF THE WEEK\nSATURDAY, NOV. 11\n8:00-10:30 PM NWSL (NATIONAL WOMEN’S SOCCER LEAGUE) CHAMPIONSHIP GAME\n10:30-11:00 PM BOB ♥ ABISHOLA (Encore OTO Episode)\nTHURSDAY, NOV. 16\n8:00-8:30 PM YOUNG SHELDON (Encore Episode – NTP)\n8:30-9:00 PM GHOSTS (Encore Episode – NTP)\n9:00-10:00 PM GHOSTS U.K. (Two Back-to-Back Half-Hour Episodes)\n10:00-11:00 PM SEAL TEAM\nNTP – New Time Period; OTO – One Time Only",
