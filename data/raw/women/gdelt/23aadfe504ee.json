  "body_text": "Well done to the Charlestown Sarsfields U14 team who had a super 4-13 to 4-4 victory over Kilmovee Shamrocks in a good quality contest played at the Connacht Centre of Excellence, Bekan recently.\nGames between the two sides have been extremely close in recent times but the Sarsfields reserved their best performance of the season for the biggest game of the lot and ran out convincing winners on an unforgettable evening for these young boys in the famed green and white jerseys.\nDespite the winning margin there was little enough between the teams for most of the encounter with Kilmovee proving a tough nut to crack as they competed vigorously in every line of the pitch.\nThere was little more than a score in it at half-time which set the scene nicely for more of the same in the second half as the battle for silverware cranked up considerably. The third quarter saw an even enough spread of scores between the two teams with everything still very much up for grabs.\nThe young Sarsfields lads upped the ante in the closing ten minutes scoring two fine goals and a flurry of points which drained the life out of the Kilmovee lads who had no response to the green and white late surge.\nThe Sarsfields lads stepped up their level at precisely the right time and made for the finish line with conviction and accuracy at the heart of their every score and move. Rory Egan (capt), Sean Cassidy, Ryan Rowley and Adam Doherty bagged the Sarsfields four goals each of which was well taken and well finished respectively.\nIt was a great night for all connected with the team and panel with a large cavalcade making its way back to the town with another East Mayo title tucked away with the promise of more to come in the coming days and weeks. These young men are the Sarsfields stars of tomorrow and for now they need to keep their heads down and continue to work on all aspects of their game to make the steps to the next level of competition.\nWell done to the management team of Neil O’Connor, Donal Healy, Ritchie Haran, Michael Doherty and Podsie Horkan who did a terrific job moulding a very honest and committed group of players to achieve their best with all the hard work on the training paddock paying off in dividends.\nThere was no winner of the Charlestown Sarsfields GAA lotto jackpot of €12,400 in the weekly draw held on Sunday night, July 14, and the following were the four numbers drawn; 3, 8, 23 and 25. The winners of the €50 weekly prizes were Peter Vesey and Kathleen McLoughlin. The latest jackpot increased to €12,500 and the draw was held on Sunday night, July 21.\nThe death took place in Philadelphia, USA recently of Theresa Cawley (nee O’Grady), formerly of Kilgarriff, Charlestown. Deepest sympathies are tendered to the bereaved.\nSympathy is extended to Jim McGowan, Hagfield, Charlestown, on the death of his sister-in-law Maureen McGowan, Bonniconlon, Co. Mayo, which occurred recently.\nActivator Pole and Chair Exercise classes continue in the Town Hall Arts Centre, Barrack Street, Charlestown, on Friday, July 26, at 12 noon. Lift access available.\nSarsfields Shamrocks lost out to St Jarlath’s in the East Mayo Minor A final played at the Connacht Centre of Excellence, Bekan recently. St Jarlath’s held off a dogged Sarsfields Shamrocks challenge to come through on a 3-5 to 0-10 scoreline. It was a curate’s egg of a game that never really caught fire despite the best efforts of both teams.\nSarsfields Shamrocks will have cause to regret some errant shooting in both halves which undermined their challenge and left them counting the cost at the final whistle with St Jarlath’s ability to pilfer goals against the run of play proving the crucial difference between the teams in the final analysis.\nOne couldn’t fault the industry or endeavour of Sarsfields Shamrocks, they left everything out there and led by four points at one stage in the first half only to cough up two goals at precisely the wrong time which took the wind out of their challenge somewhat and left them trailing 2-2 to 0-5 at half-time despite playing most of the football.\nThe second half followed a pretty similar pattern to the first for the most part as both teams continued to joust for control and supremacy. Sarsfields Shamrocks were always a threat and never went away at any stage in game but their failure to turn hard won possession into scores proved their undoing with Jarlath’s bagging a third goal in the final quarter putting the final nail into the coffin so to speak.\nThey continued to battle and scrap hard but the goal they so craved to keep their title bid buoyant never arrived and this, harsh as it may seem, was where the game was won and lost in the final summation with Jarlath’s bagging three majors which were the key components in their annexation of the East Mayo title.\nMartin Mulvaney and his management team can be proud of their side’s efforts as this is a team which has lots of talent and potential with all efforts and attention now focused on the division two minor championship which begins at the end of the month. Best for the Sarsfields Shamrocks on a disappointing night overall were Tadhg Horkan, Cian Towey, Peter Horan, Oisin Duffy, Oran Frain , Luke Burke, Declan Duffy and Paddy Joe Dunleavy.\nThe garden is looking splendid at the moment thanks to the great work of a very dedicated and hard working volunteer crew. The committee meet every Wednesday and Saturday at 3pm and all are welcome with several new members having joined recently to continue the good work being done by a tremendous group of people who have made that corner their own in recent years.\nThe Butterfly Garden in collaboration with artist Tom Meskell invites you to take part in a project for Wave of Light 2024 .

All are welcome.\nCharlestown Sarsfields lost out agonisingly to Claremorris in the hotly contested County Junior A semi-final played at Canon Gibbons Park, Claremorris recently.\nThe home side prevailed on a 3-13 to 1-16 score line but only after being put through the wringer by a gallant and dogged Sarsfields side who died with the their boots on in what was a cracking game of football with much to mull and enthuse over. The two teams brought plenty of intent to the park and were fairly gung ho in their approach with attack very much the dominant thought of both.\nThe Sarsfields, while amassing a good score, would have cause to rue the concession of three first half goals which, while well taken, owed much to some poor and sloppy defending as they found themselves two points down at the interval despite kicking 0-11 with the goals seeing the home side preside over a two point lead with their 3-4 keeping their noses in front as both sides trooped off to the dressing rooms for the half-time de-brief.\nThe second half was every bit as competitive as the first as both sides continued to place emphasis on attack. The Sarsfields were always in the contest and continued to play with plenty of energy and dash but the loss of ace free taker Colm Maye to injury was a real body blow as it robbed them of one of their primary sources for scores. His absence and the loss of Jack Brennan to a rather harsh second yellow card ten minutes from time proved pivotal in the final outcome as the green and white ran out of legs with Claremorris having that little bit of extra youth in their squad which they used to telling effect in the closing stages.\nCredit to the Sarsfields however, they continued to press right up until the final whistle and left some scores behind them which they would have cause to rue in the final analysis.\nThey can be proud of their overall display however with things not rolling for them in the frenetic last quarter when the tension was at its greatest. The Sarsfields had fine performances from Jack Corley, Paddy Lenehan, Ruairi Cullen, Colm Maye, Kenny Brennan, Jack Brennan and Ciaran Honeyman with Niall Towey and Niall Fleming also enjoying some good moments.\nCongratulations are extended to Thomas Goldrick, son of Tom and Caroline Goldrick Sandyhill, Charlestown who celebrated his coming of age recently.\nThe tenth (10th) Annual Eugene McLoughlin Memorial Run takes place on Sunday, August 11. This is always one of the biggest and best supported events in the community and attracts huge crowds to the town with this year’s staging promising to be the biggest and best yet.

This was a wonderful comeback from the Charlestown Sarsfields girls as somehow they found the inspiration to turn a game around that looked to have gone from them at the half-time interval. Well done to the team, panel and management team on a marvellous performance with a shield final to look forward to in the coming weeks.\nOver the coming weeks the Tidy Towns adjudicators will pay an unannounced visit to Charlestown.

Governor Gus was imperious as always in his role as math referee keeping the two protagonists in check with some ease. Boom Boom raced into a one set lead with some composed finishing before the Egg hit back to level to leave the game nicely poised at one set apiece. The Egg took the third set with some sizzling darts to take control but Boom Boom remains a doughty opponent as he forced a fifth set decider by snatching the fourth set with an epic 171 finish in the deciding leg sending his supporters into raptures of delight.\nThe fifth and final set ebbed to and fro with the Egg winning the first leg before Boom Boom hit back to clinch the next two leaving him one away from victory. He duly clinched the match in some style in the next leg with a treble fifteen, double eighteen finish getting him across the leg with the Egg gutted to have lost out as he looked poised for victory with three darts in his hand and double eighteen at his mercy. He never got a shot at the double however as Boom Boom stepped up at the clinical moment to clinch his fourth title of the season and he was quite the happy camper as he stepped on the winner’s podium to take the acclaim of his large band of loyal supporters.",
