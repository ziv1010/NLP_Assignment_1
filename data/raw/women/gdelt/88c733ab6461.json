For example, 66 percent of adults do not get enough physical activity in the United Arab Emirates, while the figure was under three percent in Malawi.\nThere was also a gender gap. Nearly 34 percent of women worldwide do not reach the activity threshold, compared to 29 percent of men.\nThere are \"multiple causes\" for activity rates declining overall, including that people are walking less, working at computers more and generally spending more leisure time looking at screens, Bull said.\nDuring a busy few months of world sport which includes the Olympics and the European and Copa America football championships, Krech reminded people that \"watching sports does not equal being physically active\".\n\"Don't just sit on (your) chairs, get up and be active—every step counts,\" he said.\nThe WHO emphasized that changing individual behavior is not enough, calling on countries to promote physical activity by boosting community sport as well as walking, cycling and public transport.\nFor the study, billed as the most comprehensive to look at the subject yet, an international team of researchers combined the findings from more than 500 studies involving 5.7 million people across 163 countries and territories.\nIt was not all bad news.\nAlmost half of the countries have made progress over the last decade, and 22 are on track to reach the 2030 target—as long as they keep moving in the right direction.\nPublication details\nTessa Strain et al, National, regional, and global trends in insufficient physical activity among adults from 2000 to 2022: a pooled analysis of 507 population-based surveys with 5·7 million participants, The Lancet Global Health (2024).
