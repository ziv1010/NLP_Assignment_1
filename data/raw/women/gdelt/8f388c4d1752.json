  "body_text": "Tomorrow marks the start of what could be a pivotal moment for England\nThe Euros will be important for both the club and the country, writes Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Lucy Frazer\nFootball is part of our national life.\nOver the years, the Premier League has become universal. Wherever you are, whatever country you’re in, you are never far from a fan of one of our great clubs.\nAnd like many Express readers, I am looking forward to cheering on Scotland and the Three Lions every step of the way of the Euros. As Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, I will also be watching closely as we prepare to host the tournament ourselves in 2028.\nThis will be the biggest sporting event that the UK and Ireland have ever jointly hosted, and I am so excited about its potential. Making sure that we grow the game for generations to come is something this Conservative government has been determined to deliver on.\nWe have a clear plan to make sure fans feel they have a voice in the clubs they have supported all their lives – and a voice that is respected. We will introduce bold laws to make sure fans never again face the threat of clubs in England joining breakaway closed-shop competitions and give them more of a voice through the Independent Football Regulator.\nContrast our fans-first approach to the last Labour government’s. They turned a blind eye to the problems staring them in the face and failed to establish a football regulator.\nLabour generally has no plan for government – other than to raise your taxes by £2,094 and raid your pensions with their Retirement Tax. But we will deliver and make sure fans are at the heart of the game.\nWe’re investing £320 million in grassroots sports across the country, and we are delivering equal access for women and girls, putting in place the £30 million Lionesses Futures Fund and establishing the Board of Women’s Sports. So, wherever you watch this year’s Euros, I hope you enjoy the tournament and will join me in willing on our teams on as they fly the flag for British football.",
