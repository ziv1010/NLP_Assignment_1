  "body_text": "Sarina Wiegman explains what she loved most about Alessia Russo's goal against Ireland\n- England secured a narrow 2-1 win over the Republic of Ireland on Friday night\n- Alessia Russo opened the scoring before Georgia Stanway added a second after the break\n- The victory puts England within touching distance of qualification for next summer’s Euros in Switzerland\nEngland manager Sarina Wiegman has explained what she loved most about Alessia Russo’s goal against the Republic of Ireland on Friday night.\nThe Lionesses secured a narrow, but crucial, 2-1 win over their opponents at Carrow Road to put them in pole position to secure qualification to Euro 2025 in Switzerland next summer. A draw against Sweden on Tuesday evening will be enough to ensure they finish second in the group behind France.\nIn Norwich on Friday, Alessia Russo fired the Lionesses in front following a well-worked team move. Keira Walsh, Georgia Stanway and Beth Mead were all involved before Russo slotted it beyond Courtney Brosnan in the Ireland goal.\nStanway added a second after the break with a composed finish from the penalty spot. Lauren Hemp had been brought down by defender Niamh Fahey after some sloppy play from the visitors at the back.\nHowever, it wasn’t all bad news for Ireland as they clinched a late consolation goal in added time. England didn’t defend one of substitute Megan Campbell’s long throws and Julie-Ann Russell poked an effort beyond Hannah Hampton.\nWhile England’s sloppiness is something Wiegman knows will need to be addressed on Tuesday if they’re to put their qualification beyond doubt, the Lionesses boss heaped plenty of praise on the team move that led to Russo’s opener.\n\"Those are the most enjoyable goals,\" she told the media post-match. \"All together, the team creates the goal from back to front.\n\"In the end, we got behind the defence and Alessia was free to score. Every goal is very enjoyable, I must say, but this one was even more.\"\nEngland face Sweden in their final group qualifying game in Gothenburg on Tuesday evening at 18:00 (BST).",
