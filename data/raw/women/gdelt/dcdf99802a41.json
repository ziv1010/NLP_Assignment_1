  "body_text": "Aaron Rodgers has always lived his life in the limelight — not only for his MVP-level play but also his high-profile relationships. From his iconic run with the Green Bay Packers to his brief stint in New York and now in Pittsburgh, fans have long been fascinated by both his on-field heroics and off-field life. In June 2025, Rodgers publicly confirmed he had married his wife, Brittani, revealing the wedding took place “a couple months” earlier.\nHe’s called her “incredible” and alluded to their private life being a sanctuary from the public eye. Brittani prefers keeping out of the spotlight, a stark contrast to Rodgers’ past high-profile romances — including Olivia Munn, Danica Patrick, and Shailene Woodley.\nAs he concludes the NFL season with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Rodgers seems just as focused on building a stable personal life as he is on chasing another Super Bowl. Here’s a look back at his romantic history and what we know about his new marriage.\nDestiny Newton\nAaron’s first big-time relationship as a famous athlete was with his childhood best friend-turned-lover, Destiny Newton. They began to date in 2011, after being “best friends for nine years” and meeting “at church camp,” Destiny’s mom told Radar Online nearly a decade ago. She added, “They’re very happy together, and our family loves him.” Their love story appeared to end in 2013 when reports of their breakup began surfacing.\nJessica Szohr\nWhile this relationship was never confirmed, Aaron was widely believed to have dated Gossip Girl star Jessica Szohr. They were first rumored to be together in 2011, and then reportedly “got back together over the holidays” between Dec. 2013-Jan. 2014, Us Weekly reported.\nOlivia Munn\nOne of Aaron’s most famous relationships was with The Predator star Olivia Munn. They dated for nearly three years, between 2014-2017, but not without some drama. Aaron’s dad, Ed Rodgers, revealed that his son had not spoken to their family since 2014 — the same year the NFL star began dating Olivia — saying that “fame can change things” in an interview with The New York Times published in Jan. 2017.\nOlivia had been accused of being one of the reasons this estrangement happened. She finally shot down the rumors while appearing on Andy Cohen‘s SiriusXM radio show in May of 2018. “On my last day when I was filming The Newsroom, I spent the day in my trailer just encouraging [Aaron] to, like, have an honest conversation with your parents,” Olivia had recalled. She wanted a reunion to happen — which finally did take place on Aaron’s birthday in Dec. 2018.\nAfter learning Aaron reunited with his parents, Olivia told TMZ Sports, “Oh my gosh, if that’s true, that’s amazing. It’s long overdue.”\nDanica Patrick\nFollowing his romance with Olivia, Aaron didn’t take long to enter another highly-publicized relationship. NASCAR race car driver Danica Patrick confirmed that she was dating Aaron in Jan. 2018 and made their public debut as a couple at the Daytona 500 the next month. They even attended the ESPYS together that year, where the athletes first met in 2012!\nAaron and Danica’s relationship appeared picture-perfect: they often shared happy couple’s photos and enjoyed romantic getaways together. One of Aaron’s most thoughtful gestures was surprising Danica with a trip to Paris for her 37th birthday in March of 2019 (as you can see above). By Nov. 2019, they had even purchased a $28 million Malibu mansion in cash, per Variety. However, their fairy-tale romance unexpectedly came to an end in July 2020, when Danica’s rep confirmed with HollywoodLife that they’re “no longer together.”\nShailene Woodley\nAaron went about his next romance very privately, it seems. Just days after the football star was reportedly in a “long-distance relationship” with Big Little Lies star Shailene Woodley he revealed he was “engaged!” While accepting his third MVP Award on the NFL Honors broadcast on Feb. 6, he reflected on the ups and downs of 2020, then saying, “I got engaged.” Toward the end of the speech, he said he wanted to “thank his fiancée” but didn’t name Shailene. Days later, People magazine confirmed that Shailene was the woman who Aaron had gotten engaged.\nLeading up to the initial dating report, which was reported by E! News, Aaron had been staying in Wisconsin for the NFL season (it ended when his Packers team lost the NFC Championship Game at the end of Jan. 2021). Shailene, meanwhile, wasn’t even in the country; she had been filming her new movie Misanthrope in Montreal, Canada. Despite the distance, Aaron and Shailene “have seen each other and been in touch,” the report added. “They continue to talk and see each other when they can. They are both focused on their careers, but they also make time for each other.” Overall, though, the source said that this rumored couple “have kept things private and low key.”\nAfter less than two years together, reports surfaced that the pair had called it a day in February 2022. After rumors that they’d broken up, it was reported that the two had ended things permanently, per TMZ. Despite the breakup, the pair apparently tried to work things out. Shailene was still Aaron’s date to a wedding he was officiating in March, and a source close to the NFL star told HollywoodLife exclusively that he was “working on reconciling” with his ex, but the relationship fizzled out once again.\nThe pair split up once more in April, and it seems like they’re done for good this time! A source told E! News at the time that they broke up because “everything was on his terms and nothing was going to change.”\nMallory Edens\nIn the first month of 2023, there were reports that Aaron had struck up a romance with Mallory Edens. Mallory (b. 1996) is the daughter of Wes Edens, an American billionaire businessman who is co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks and the Premiere League team Aston Villa. Aaron celebrated his 39th birthday with Mallory courtside at a Bucks game, leading to some to speculate about a potential relationship. TMZ confirmed that the two were an item.\nThe couple has since split, though the exact timing remains unclear. Rodgers confirmed the breakup during a December 2024 appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, where he referred to a new girlfriend, Brittani.\nBrittani\nDuring a December 2024 The Pat McAfee Show, Aaron briefly mentioned his girlfriend’s name, revealing that she “doesn’t have any social media” and that they enjoy watching the show together.\n“We watch the show,” Aaron shared, before adding to Pat, “She’s a fan of you.”\n“I’ll set it all straight,” Aaron said during the interview. “From the jump, I’m in a different phase of my life, I’m 41 years old [and] I’m in a serious relationship. I have off-field stuff going on that requires my attention.”\nThe following year, Aaron told a group of reporters that he was married! However, he did not divulge any details about whom his wife is nor how long they’ve apparently been married.\nIn July 2025, Aaron gushed to Sports Illustrated about his wife was “the right one.”\n“And to have that person that unconditionally loves you behind the scenes, there’s no better feeling in the world, and I have the most incredible wife,” Aaron said, before adding, “I just really love her, and I’m so thankful to have her by my side at the end. When you have that stability and that rock behind you at the house, you feel like you can do anything.”",
