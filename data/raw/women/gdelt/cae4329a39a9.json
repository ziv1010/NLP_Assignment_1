But we did not expect this situation. After talking with the president and the directors, we made our decision. To work under threats is neither logical nor advisable. I’d never experienced anything like it.”\nAdvertisement\nMarcelino is talking to The Athletic about the circumstances in which his spell as Marseille manager ended in September, less than three months after he was hired by the Ligue 1 club’s president Pablo Longoria.\nThe Spanish coach and his staff resigned on September 20, two days after a meeting at the club’s training ground during which some ultra leaders threatened “war” if Longoria and club directors Javier Ribalta, Stephane Tessier and Pedro Iriondo did not resign.\nLongoria at first said he was leaving the club too but, after speaking with Marseille’s American owner Frank McCourt, decided to stay and continue in the position. Marcelino and his assistants were sure they could not work under such conditions, although he says he understands why his fellow Asturian has stayed.\n“I still speak often with Pablo, he has been my friend for many years,” Marcelino says. “There was always the maximum respect and honesty, on both sides, in all our dealings. He has decided to stay for the responsibility he feels at all levels: to the club, to the owner and to himself. I respect his decision completely. And I wish him the best in continuing what he has always done as Marseille president — taking decisions which some might not like but that he believes are required for the good of this great club.”\nLongoria appointed the former Valencia, Villarreal and Athletic Bilbao coach Marcelino in the summer, during a rebuilding project that brought 11 new signings and saw 16 players leave. Marseille’s campaign began with a shock Champions League play-off exit to Panathinaikos on penalties. Five games into the Ligue 1 season, the new-look team were unbeaten and sat fourth in the table. But fan unrest was evident from whistles at the Stade Velodrome following a 0-0 draw with Toulouse in the days before the training ground meeting.\n“There were deep changes in the squad, the new signings arrived bit by bit, the last three in the final week of the transfer window,” Marcelino says. “We only had a week of training with all the players. The results were not bad, although we drew two or three games that we could have won. But this was not a sporting issue. You need more time to judge our work. There were threats to the president and his directors, and from there, the whole process happened.”\nAdvertisement\nMarcelino has been replaced by the former AC Milan, Napoli and Valencia manager Gennaro Gattuso, but incidents have continued at Marseille. On October 29, a game against Lyon at the Velodrome was postponed after visiting manager Fabio Grosso was injured by a stone thrown at his team’s bus.\nGO DEEPER\nMarseille vs Lyon abandoned; Grosso sustains head injuries in bus attacks\nThere have also been many other incidents within French football in recent years, including chaos at the 2021 Champions League final between Real Madrid and Liverpool, and episodes of crowd trouble involving fans from Lens, Nice, Lille, Bordeaux, Lyon, Montpellier, Angers and Saint-Etienne.\nAfter spending just three months in the country, Marcelino feels he cannot offer solutions to the problem. However, it is clear to him that French football and society must take measures to deal with the issues.\n“I hope it stops, that a solution is found,” he says. “French football has very good players, good teams, good institutions. I would not put them all in the same bag. Here, in Spain, some years ago there were also problems, but the right measures were taken. In other countries too. I hope that in France they manage to eradicate this type of situation, in a definitive way.”\nAfter his playing days as a midfielder were cut short by injury at the age of 28, Marcelino’s coaching career progressed through boyhood club Sporting Gijon, Recreativo de Huelva, Racing Santander, Real Zaragoza, Sevilla, Villarreal, Valencia and Athletic Bilbao, before Marseille. Highlights include guiding Valencia to a 2-1 victory in the 2019 Copa del Rey final against a Barcelona side that included Lionel Messi, and winning the Spanish Supercopa with Athletic in January 2021.\n“Winning the Copa del Rey with Valencia was my best satisfaction on a professional level, no doubt,” Marcelino says. “Then we won the Supercopa with Athletic Bilbao, beating Real Madrid and Barcelona in the space of four days. But that was during the pandemic, and football without fans is not the same.\nAdvertisement\n“The Copa del Rey final is a special game, and winning it with Valencia, in a full stadium… it had been many years without a trophy for Valencia, it was the first for us, so it was something unforgettable — and still is.”\nThese successes are treasured even more as the financial dominance of Madrid and Barcelona make it difficult for managers at other clubs to win trophies and achieve success.\n“La Liga has two of the three or five biggest clubs in the world,” Marcelino says. “Then Atletico Madrid have grown very well under Diego Simeone. For another team to win La Liga, you need to do very well, and you need those three to make mistakes, which is very, very difficult.”\nThis situation has led many of the top Spanish coaches to look to the Premier League. Pep Guardiola, Mikel Arteta, Unai Emery and Andoni Iraola are all employed there, as were Julen Lopetegui and Javi Gracia last season.\n“There are a lot of very big clubs in England, a bit different to La Liga, there are six teams who are always up there,” Marcelino says. “The Premier League is like the NBA of football: lots of very good players, extraordinary organisation of the competition, many teams who have the same level of budget and squad.”\nMarcelino was linked with the Everton role vacated by Frank Lampard in January 2023. He says that he and his staff always look for a solid project first and foremost.\n“First, you have to be honest with yourself, then you can be honest with others,” he says. “You cannot just go into any situation, even if they offer a lot of money. You first need to mark out clear objectives and be in agreement about how to achieve them. You need to clearly show the roles and responsibilities of all involved. When things are clear, explained, reasoned and applied among everyone, there is a better chance of success. Normally in football, even if you have money, when you improvise or take decisions under pressure you are always closer to failure than success.”\nAdvertisement\nThe potential of such planning and organisation is shown at Aston Villa, where Emery, another former Valencia and Villarreal boss, has turned a team that was lower mid-table when he arrived in October 2022 into challengers for a place in next season’s Champions League.\n“Unai is doing extraordinarily well,” Marcelino says. “The club has made a big investment too. With the right signings, he can keep improving and reach the top places in the table. There are six big clubs who are always up there in the Premier League. Then some surprise teams, like Newcastle last year, who deservedly made it into the Champions League positions.\n“We have had some offers from Saudi Arabia but did not really consider them too much. That option is not a priority for us at the moment. I would like to work more in Europe, at a club with a stable, long-term project, in a big league, with a team capable of competing for titles.”\nInternational football has been on his radar, too. There were talks with former Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) president Luis Rubiales about taking the Spain job after the 2022 World Cup.\n“To be national coach would have been a great honour,” he says. “But Rubiales preferred another coach. The results have been good with Luis de la Fuente, we wish him all the best. That door is closed.”\nThis meant that Marcelino was not at the RFEF when Rubiales kissed Jenni Hermoso after Spain’s women’s team won the World Cup final and was subsequently banned by FIFA for three years.\n“I don’t think (Rubiales’ behaviour) reflects the whole image of a country,” he says. “We can all have our ideas about how the situation could have been resolved better and more quickly. There are lots of very good things in Spanish football. That is what we have to focus on now, all of us who work in football: that our league is better, our national team is better, and the general workings in the world of football is better.”\nGO DEEPER\nSpanish football is at an important crossroads after Rubiales. Which way will it go?\nAnother big issue facing Spanish football is the regular racism that Real Madrid forward Vinicius Junior has suffered at multiple La Liga stadiums in recent seasons. This includes the disgraceful scenes at Valencia’s Mestalla last May, and more recently at Sevilla’s Estadio Sanchez Pizjuan and Barcelona’s Camp Nou.\nAdvertisement\n“These acts are completely reprehensible, and we must try and eradicate them,” Marcelino says. “The actions of a minority should never be taken as representing everyone. But we can all do our part to stop it happening. Everyone, the professionals and the fans, must show respect. And that is the base of the issue. If we all act with the maximum respect for our fellow man, then these incidents will not exist.”\nGiven his track record in La Liga, including guiding Valencia and Villarreal into European football, Marcelino should not be too long out of football. The 58-year-old was close to returning almost immediately after leaving Marseille but decided against accepting a proposal from Sevilla, where he had a short spell in 2011-12.\nRecent days have brought reports that Villarreal’s hierarchy would like him to return to the club he coached from January 2013 to August 2016, taking over in the Segunda Division and leading them into the Champions League play-offs.\nThese links surprise some given that Marcelino’s first spell at the club ended amid differences with Villarreal president Fernando Roig, just days before facing Monaco in a crucial Champions League play-off. But football can be unpredictable, as the last few months, including his Marseille experience, have shown.\n“We have coached lots of good teams in La Liga and in most cases, achieved our objectives or even over-achieved,” he says. “Now, when you are out of work, you can never predict what will happen. If a club wants to count on our services, we look together at the objectives, the project, present, and future.\n“If both sides are convinced, we take on the new challenge with the highest possible ambition and excitement.”\n(Top photo: Clement Mahoudeau/AFP via Getty Images)",
