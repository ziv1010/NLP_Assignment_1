  "body_text": "This article originally appeared in the June 1994 issue of Esquire. You can find every Esquire story ever published at Esquire Classic.\nThe important thing, he says, is to know when to push and when not to push. Women say no so easily to a married man. Luckily, he’s always been good at sensing when a woman liked him. He is sure he could have slept with any of them three or four dates before he did. Even now, as the field begins to thin and the waters recede all around him, the affairs could have started earlier, but he didn’t want to chance it, didn’t want to make a move too soon.\nSometimes, he says, you miss it that way. Sometimes it’s perfect, it should happen that night, and when you come back to it a week later, something’s changed—the boyfriend came back, or what was bothering her then is not bothering her now Still, you’ve got to go slow. You have to have exquisite patience.\nOr so says my adulterer, as he eats his casserole of squid and sips a glass of white wine in one of the many northern-Italian restaurants where, at high noon in midtown Manhattan, the sidelong glances that cut the air signal not erotic intent but the mechanical act of covering one’s back.\nI think of him as my adulterer out of a certain protectiveness, as if he were a member of a vanishing breed. I suppose you would have to find a poignancy in vampires to find a poignancy in him, but I do. He may be the last of his kind.\nNot that married people aren’t still sleeping with people they are not married to. The business of betrayal is bullish, if one believes the advice columns and the women’s magazines and the radio shrinks.\nBut my adulterer may well be among the last to enjoy it so much, to find desire so wicked, to revel in being so unregenerate a reprobate.\nAdultery is a mirror all married people look into, a line to step up to and decide whether to cross. It is a mirror as well of the times in which we live, of the places where we look for grace. Where once we found solace in our dazzling contradictions, in the way we pick ourselves up from the pratfalls we take, now comfort flows in a colder vein, in the stern, conscientious energy with which we purge temptation in the first place, in the vigilant avoidance of danger.\nAnd so if, in the 1950s, adultery was a sin, and in the ’70s an avocation, in the ’90s it is in danger of becoming a disease. The therapeutic vision of life, after all, makes no room for monsters, for architects of their own grotesqueries. As if somehow we could do without them.\nNow adulterers are victims, too. One psychotherapist says that she wants “to do for adulterers what Alcoholics Anonymous did for drinkers,” because adultery, she says, is an epidemic, contained in a virus that can be traced from one generation to the next. She makes genealogies for the patients who come to her when the marriage is listing and a billable reason must be found. On her charts she hunts for the faithless, for the errant gene they have passed on to the present.\nBut for another expert, the adulterer is the infidel, the betrayed is the cuckold, and we are locked in a contemporary morality play in which honesty is the clear and cleansing light, saving sinners from their secrets. As if there were a way we could all be happy, if we simply tried hard enough. As if errant desire and a willful toying with contentment could be neatly excised from the soul.\nMy adulterer is old enough to know better. He is forty-seven, although he looks much younger* (*some details have been changed to protect the identity of the subject). The dark-blond hair has only recently begun to thin; a carefully nurtured athleticism informs his stride. He grew up in a Pennsylvania mill town. His father was a steelworker; his mother was careful not to raise another one. He went to school with kids a lot better off than he was. “You got a real good sense of the distance between what they had to go home to and what you had to go home to,” he says. “When I got to know them, I couldn’t figure out why they had it and I didn’t.”\nNow he has it, too. He is a powerful executive in one of those corporations full of sharp elbows and sharper teeth that nest within the financial-services industry. He is a pirate, but not a passionate one: “It’s hard for me to imagine me being passionate about anything,” he says. “I mean, I’m not going to cut my ear off if I have a good day at work.”\nHe has been married for more than twenty years, and since his wedding day he has slept with at least that many women. “I’m actually pretty good at remembering them,” he says. “Not necessarily all of their names, but I definitely remember everyone I ever slept with.”\nThe first time it happened, he had been married less than a year. There was a convention in Las Vegas. And after the desultory business of the day had been concluded, and he and a colleague were having a nightcap in the hotel bar, he noticed a woman looking at him. His friend faded away, as friends tend to do in that situation. He and the woman had a drink, and eventually any qualms he might have had dissolved with the ice in his Scotch.\n“I sat there, knowing what was supposed to happen next, and I had this brief tug-of-war with myself as to whether it should,” he says. ‘And I couldn’t think of any reason why it shouldn’t. The next morning, I wondered, Is my penis going to fall off? Women can tell—my wife will know.” But there was no guilt, he says. Merely the fear of detection.\nHe apologizes for his lack of angst. “But nothing happened. I came home, and it was life as usual.”\nDuring those early years, when the marriage was new and the affairs infrequent, he did ask himself why he had them at all. “And I pretty quickly rejected the fact that I wasn’t happy in my marriage. I was in love enough. I think what I discovered later on was that there are different degrees of being in love and some of them—many of them—are far more intense than the one I had when I got married.”\nIt was a year before he slept with another woman not his wife. It happened at a management conference, in southern California this time. He met a woman at a cocktail party. “She had all the lines I was never very good at developing. She told me I reminded her of her boyfriend, whom she had just broken up with. She was upset; she just needed to be with somebody. She was conning me. She basically seduced me or hustled me, whatever you want to say, but I ended up in bed with her, trying to be a nice guy.”\nBut the next day, there was another woman at lunch, prettier, smarter, and equally available, and “now I have this dilemma because I have to get rid of the one from the night before. And by the way, I’m not good at this yet, remember?” Nevertheless, he managed. He told the first woman that he had never done such a thing before and they must never see each other again. He invited the second woman to his room for a nightcap. At the front desk, he noticed a third woman. He’d seen her before, circling him at meetings and seminars. She walked over to him and said, “I’m in room 345, if you’re interested.” And he said, “If I were interested, we would probably have been in room 345 quite a while ago.”\nThat trip was the turning point. “Something happened. I just realized that I was somebody women wanted to be with. Or some women did.” There was always someone who found him attractive and who gave him enough clues to figure it out. He reveled in the fact that he didn’t have to ask, that they were there for him.\nAt the office he kept a low profile. “I never, ever, romanced anybody. If it were you and I, I would have probably gotten attracted to you in the office and waited for an opportunity to come along where you could tell me you were available. And if you didn’t, then you would never know.”\nIn the ’70s, that giddy, erotic circus, they were all available, or so it seemed. “There was no game plan; it just happened. Because it was the ’70s, a lot of this had nothing to do with me as a person. I was a score. At some stage in this business, I became aware of the fact that women were claiming to have had me who I didn’t even know. I would hear rumors about an affair I was supposedly having with someone I had never met.” How did that make him feel? “Cheap,” he says, laughing. “I think through that whole period I was just a notch in some woman’s belt.”\nIt’s not all that hard to see why women sleep with him. He clearly likes women and he loves sex. He’s like a walking madeleine on the subject—a remembrance of eros past, when sex was new and delicious and brashly impulsive. “There’s something wicked about sleeping with somebody new,” he says. “If you and I met and we slept together, it would be great. But if you were single and I was single, it would just be wonderful. It wouldn’t have that sort of little something extra that said, not only was it wonderful, but we got away with it.”\nAnd there was so much to get away with back then, so many women for whom the glint of light in a stranger’s eyes shone much more brightly than his wedding ring. In the morning you woke up, shook hands, and went your separate ways. It was easy to make a clean getaway. Now that the drinking has died down and sex has become, once again, a more complicated and rueful endeavor, it can be hard to remember the fever dream of the ’70s, when a lot of glass got smashed in the fires of desire and no one worried much about getting cut on the pieces. Younger men now seem more horrified by the risk than tantalized by the danger inherent in that sort of adventure. Perhaps it was one of those miasmas, born of a certain time and a certain place and difficult to describe to those who were never there.\nHe was interested in bright, ambitious women in their early thirties, intent on their careers, who wanted no more from him than he wanted from them. Most of the time they met at night, after dinner and drinks, in a studio apartment he keeps in Murray Hill, a place to crash when an early-morning meeting makes going back to Westchester inconvenient.\nOccasionally there was a lunchtime assignation—though he tends to take a dim view of matinees: “The problem is racing the clock. There’s something about lying there exhausted in a pool of sweat, looking at the ceiling, smiling, and then looking at your watch and thinking you have to call your secretary to postpone the 2:30. There ought to be a little more time than that.”\nSometimes there was even less. Once a woman came to his office, on a high floor in a tall, glassy tower, filled with the usual accoutrements: comfortable sofa, large leather chair, imposing desk, lavish views. (Or so he tells me—he doesn’t think it wise for us to meet there.) They were sitting on the sofa when suddenly she made a request: She wanted him to masturbate in front of her. He did what she asked, loving the look in her eyes as she watched him, the image of himself he saw reflected there. Another woman wanted to take him in her mouth while he sat at his desk, and while he thought the idea a little de trop, too obvious a turn on the tired equation of power and submission, he agreed. And there were two fast, uncomfortable sessions on the couch. He shrugs. “So in the office, it only happened those four times,” he says. “In twenty years, that’s not a lot.”\nFor him adultery has always been a way to thrill to his own existence, a trajectory of his own best self, the one that is little more than a bystander to his marriage. “I have this ability to disappear inside myself when I need to,” he says. “There’s a whole world in there I can hang around in. It’s gotten bigger and bigger over the years; it’s the more interesting place to be. And adultery is an extension of it, just like my job is an extension of it.”\nIn fact, his adultery and his office seem to be mirror images of each other, the deals and the seductions providing different locations for the same drama: the slow buildup, the anticipation, the uncertainty, the considered recklessness, the risk. And while in the office he is the one who makes things happen, in the affairs the women come to him. They are the ones in control. That they want him “still flatters and surprises the hell out of me,” he says. And to be the passive recipient of their attention is a powerful erotic element.\nHe says that he has felt no guilt during all the moments, harsh and tender, of his marriage. “If I thought it were wrong, I wouldn’t do it.” It is, he says, the old question of whether you would take something you. wanted from a store if you thought you could get away with it. “Everyone wants to take it,” he says. “But most are afraid they’d get caught. I don’t have that fear.”\nHe married when he was twenty-five. “It was time. All my friends were getting married.” They moved to a house in the suburbs, his wife quit her job to have a couple of kids, and over the years the houses got bigger and the marriage shrank.\nWas the marriage a mistake? “It depends on the day of the week,” he says. “I think it’s been good for me in a lot of ways. I think that I’m somebody who is supposed to be with somebody. I would probably not be real good by myself.” At the beginning of his marriage, he had been fiercely attracted to his wife, but in the end, that’s all it had been. She was beautiful, tall and blond and brown-eyed; she laughed at his jokes. She is still beautiful, he says, though her laughter is more considered. “I’m not sure I ever did fall in love with her,” he says. “I got very comfortable in a relationship I didn’t know how to get out of. It was convenient, it was comfortable, and it just got to the point where it seemed logical to take it to the next step.”\nHe is not the first man to drift into marriage. I can’t imagine a woman making the decision so passively. “That’s because men don’t make the decision,” he says. “Women make the decision. The guy is the last to know.”\nHe does not want to embarrass or humiliate his wife, which is why he confines his activities to midtown and points west of the Hudson. “In the burbs, I’m just a guy other guys play tennis with,” he says. “I’ve been pretty successful in separating my two lives.”\nHis wife, he thinks, doesn’t know. Or doesn’t want to know. He makes love to her three or four times a month. “If it’s a question of turning over one way and going to sleep or turning over the other, I’m probably going to go to sleep.” But now the distance between his two lives has begun to seem too long an emotional commute. “It makes me feel jealous sometimes, when I see a couple who are really in love, to see them walking down the street or sitting together in a restaurant. I also envy the guy who has been married thirty years and goes home and the fire’s still on.”\nAnd so it was probably as inevitable as it was ironic that in the end adultery would make him a romantic.\n“Everyone thinks the danger in adultery is getting caught,” he says. “That’s not the danger. The danger is falling in love.”\nHe didn’t see it coming when it happened to him.\nShe wasn’t even as pretty as his lovers tended to be. She had a wonderful mouth, but she was a little too thin, almost bony, and her lack of appetite, her perpetual smoking, didn’t seem to signify a sensualist. But he was wrong about that.\nThey met in 1979, at a convention out of town. When they got back to their respective offices in New York, they saw no reason why they should not continue. The sex just got better and better. She became his teacher. “Because up to this point, I just wasn’t as good at pleasing a woman. To be frank, she taught me an awful lot about oral sex that had not occurred to me.”\nThe affair went on for three years. And one day while they were having lunch, she said, “Have you ever fallen in love in one of these?” He looked at her and “all of a sudden the lights went on and I said, ‘Yeah, actually, just once.’ She said, ‘When?’ and I said, ‘Now.’ I went home that night and took a shower, like I could wash the feeling off, but instead everything just fell into place. I thought, There really is somebody out there for you. And I realized she was probably it.”\nBut when he thought of leaving his wife for her, he realized something else. He had become a prisoner of his own persona.\n“What was holding me back was the idea that I would simply move to a different address and start doing the same thing,” he says. “That I would still be kind of looking to see what’s next. And I didn’t want to do that, particularly to someone who would know the minute I did it. The one person you cannot cheat on is the woman you used to cheat on someone else.”\nThe very fact that the sex was so good was a warning, he says. “It made me leery of the commitment, because I didn’t think that it could last forever, and sex for me needs to be surprising. That’s probably my problem with married sex. Sooner or later you run out of variations. Part of what makes an affair exciting is the uncertainty, and the foreplay that starts weeks before you get in bed. It’s phone conversations, it’s looks in the office, it’s winks in the street—imagining what it will be like, and then you finally get there and you just basically jump on each other, but still the variety, whether it’s in your mind or in your bed, is fascinating.”\nSo he broke it off. He had done the right thing, he knew, but the next few years were devastating. He wasn’t interested in other women. “I was faithful,” he says, “in my fashion.”\nEventually, he emerged from his mourning. And when he did, and stepped out once again to inhale the oxygen of another woman’s interest, he discovered that the atmosphere around him had changed, the air was thinner, and it was harder to breathe.\nBy then it was the middle of the 1980s. He was moving fast in his profession, gaining more power and the visibility that came with it. And the ambitious young women weren’t in their early thirties anymore; they were older, and what they wanted was husbands and babies. Sex? “I’ve done that,” one of them said to him. “I’m not into that anymore.”\nThe change he sees distresses him. “What truly puzzles me is that as you track sex through this whole period, it’s scary, but it’s become a nonevent for a lot of people. Women can go into a relationship, can fall in love, and sex is not necessarily on the table. I think it may be a dying art.”\nStill, it happened from time to time, despite the ways in which AIDS had complicated the picture, the women forcing him into the condoms he had avoided all his life. And when it happened, it was a more delicate dance. “The rules changed. Now there was a courtship. Sex, if it happened at all, was the end result of a long seduction process. You got there slower, if you got there at all. And it took longer to walk away.”\nAnd why would he want to walk away?\n“Because there were always the complications. You have to go home. You have to face the reality that you’re not free, and it’s frustrating; you can’t take it to the next level and both of you know it.”\nBut once it had changed for him, once it was no longer the sheer physical joy of a stranger’s body, once it was the more subtle wine of seduction and romance, why then stay married, when it’s love you’re really after?\n“I think most guys get so comfortable in the marriage that they’re not going to say, ‘Great, I don’t have to stay here anymore; I’m going to find out what the single life is like.’ Because I think you become a bit of a captive of the lifestyle.” There’s the problem of money: “All of a sudden the price tag for freedom is potentially millions of dollars. You’ve got to look at at least 50 percent of your wealth gone and then continuing to support your ex-wife at a level she’s used to. It’s a big decision. So you end up sitting there, saying, ‘I shouldn’t be in this marriage. The next woman who comes along who knocks me off my feet is going to get me.’ And then you spend a lot of time making sure that woman doesn’t come along.”\nBy now he has a built-in Maginot Line to keep that sort of woman away. The reputation that once branded him a glamorous rogue has calcified, encasing him in the yellowing caul of the indiscriminate rake. “It was almost the reverse of what had happened to me earlier, when people were claiming to be sleeping with me. Now women were afraid that other people would think they were. I actually got sort of isolated and that’s still the case. I know of people I’ve been friendly to and haven’t slept with whose life became difficult because people thought I had.” The stories about him have multiplied, far surpassing their admittedly impressive grounding in fact. Once a woman asked him if he knew about his reputation and he said he did. “And she said she just wanted me to know that she wasn’t into that kinky stuff. I said, ‘Wait a minute, I don’t know about that part.’ She said, ‘You know, the threesomes, the whips and chains.’”\nHe laughs at the stories, comfortable, he would have you believe, with the flyspecked film it puts over his life. Just as success, and the things he did to make himself successful, has changed him from the young aspirant everyone was rooting for to the middle-aged insider resented for all the blood in his wake, so now he is on the verge of becoming an aging roué, because by now there have simply been too many women, and the stories about him get less and less palatable. Why doesn’t it bother him?\nAt first it seems to be a sort of self-induced blindness, the kind that comes from years of looking in the mirror and finding no reflection. But that’s not it. He is, in fact, contemplating his own redemption.\n“Honestly, I don’t feel like I’m older,” he says at first. “I look in the mirror and I see the same person that used to look back at me, I think, twenty years ago.”\nBut there are other mirrors in which to look, and they are the faces of his friends. “A guy I hadn’t seen in a long time, he shows up in slippers and an old cardigan sweater, complaining about his back, and he’s only a few years older. I think that while it’s nice to con ourselves that we’ll never get old, some of us will. I guess the big choice in my own life is, do I ultimately accept the fact that everybody grows old or do I run off with a thirty-three-year-old, starting all over again, and buy myself twenty-five years of what I’d call youth?”\nHe’s thought about this. “You don’t want to marry some beautiful young woman who’s just wiping the drool off your chin and turning you toward the sun, waiting you out. It would have to be someone whose love for me was so unconditional that I just knew it couldn’t fail.”\nI start to smile, because we are talking about unicorns now, but he is absolutely serious. The woman he is describing is real, he says. And is her love that unconditional? “I think so.”\nBut what is real is his breathtaking naiveté. He has finally come full circle, embracing as romantic a notion of love as any callow-eyed boy. The idea of an unconditional love is, after all, the chrysalis under which an abiding relationship can form itself—it’s what you believe in until you begin to understand the nature of what happens between married people. And then it’s the carapace a marriage has to shed if it’s going to go the distance.\n“I have to make a decision,” he is saying. “And then I have to take my chances. If it all plays out and I win her back, it will be over and I will turn into the guy who I just described, who trades it all in. But I don’t know if that can happen. I don’t know if I can do it.”\nHe met her about a year ago. In many ways she was what he liked to think all the others had been: smart, beautiful, extremely confident. “It was one of those things that had never happened to me before. I basically just got dazzled. I was probably in love in a matter of hours.”\nHe’d seen her around enough to ask who she was; she had a cockiness to her that he liked. By chance they sat next to each other at a meeting and, because his company did business with her company, he had a reason to ask her out to lunch. And that’s where it began to happen. “It was like when you touch a wire and you get a shock. I said to myself, ‘Be careful here, you’ve got to go slower.’”\nHe was careful not to call her, but a month later they ran into each other again, at some dumb weekend industry retreat that featured a softball game and a picnic. She was wearing blue jeans and a white T-shirt, divested of her broad shoulders and the double rows of buttons standing guard on her business suit. They sat together in the bleachers and she said the thing that clinched the deal. “She told me that she was well aware of me and my reputation, and there was no way she was going to sleep with me. And if that’s why I was talking to her, then I should stop. But I was having too good a time talking to her to care.”\nThey had dinner that night and drinks after, back in his room, and they talked until 3:00 in the morning. And then she left. There had not been even a kiss. “It was just the most amazing six or seven hours that I had ever spent. And then it happened again the next day. I had never connected to a woman that way. It was all a head trip. There was never anything not to talk about.”\nThen she went back to her home and he went back to his and he experienced a longing more piercing than he had ever known. She lived in Virginia; they talked on the phone every day.\nEventually, she came to New York and they had dinner, and finally she spent the night with him at the apartment in Murray Hill. The lovemaking wasn’t good, botched by alcohol and nervousness and high expectations. It wasn’t good for a long time, in fact. But unlike his affair with the first woman with whom he had fallen in love, this was not about sex. “And for the first time in my life, it didn’t matter. Because she was that special.”\nThree months ago, they set a date, the date by which he would tell his wife he was leaving. The date came and went, and it was not his wife who found out it was over.\n“I wasn’t ready,” he says now. “And I made a mistake. I think it was guts, or lack of them. I didn’t do it and I damaged the relationship. Now she doesn’t trust that I can do it.”\nShe is fifteen years younger than he is. Yes, he says, he would be ready to provide the perquisites a younger wife would claim as her own. “This is a more logical time for me to raise a child. I’d be there. I wasn’t, with my kids. It’s unfair, but the first go around you spend most of your time creating a lifestyle that you want your family to live, and the time it takes to do that takes you out of it. Besides, I’ve only got one more shot to get that all-American football player.”\nMaybe it was the deadline, he suggests, that brought about the failure of nerve. “I think that all that was wrong was that the deadline was wrong—I needed more time. To have to make a final decision by the clock is just not smart. It was like a final exam and I hadn’t read the book. I needed an extension.”\nNow, he says, it will take a full-court press to prove to her he’s serious. “And part of the problem is that I’ve never been good at really being in love. All the things you do, all the things you say, don’t come naturally after a lifetime of making damn sure I didn’t get into a situation like this. The talents I’ve learned, if you can use that word, are all in an opposite area.”\nBy now he thought he would be feeling the relief that usually followed goodbye. “Normally by now I would have said, ‘So what, I’ll get over it,’ and I would have gone on. And I couldn’t do that. I had a thousand reasons to say it’s done, get over it, and I didn’t do it. It’s turning out to be extremely difficult to get her out of my head.”\nBut the phantom in his head has still to confront the reality of the woman in the house in Westchester.\n“To go into a relationship like this, I still have to end one,” he says. “And to be honest with you, there’s nothing my wife’s done that’s wrong. It’s just me. I’m somebody who spends very little time worrying about his life. Everything sort of gets taken care of for me. The house runs, the food’s there, the clothes are clean, the social schedule is taken care of. There’s a sort of comfort that allows me to think about my job and the world I live in full-time and know there’s going to be a roof over my head at the end of the day. And it’s very difficult to simply walk in one day and look at somebody you’ve spent twenty years with and say, ‘It’s not working out anymore.’ It’s like firing somebody who didn’t do a bad job. But I don’t want to spend the rest of my life wondering what it would have been like.”\nIt’s been tense around the house in Westchester lately. “We don’t have a dream marriage,” he says. “I come home at 8:00, I’m tired, sometimes it takes a while to make the transition from here to there. I eat dinner, I go to bed. I get up and do it again. That’s five days a week. On Saturday, sometimes, I disappear into that zone inside of me, and I’m thinking about work, I’m thinking about her. My wife resents the lack of attention. Most of the time, I wish I wasn’t there. I think I’m realizing that I can’t go through with this the rest of my life, these two different lives.”\nMeanwhile, the weather is warming, and he is glad, because it means that on the weekend there will be hours on the tennis courts, hours he doesn’t have to spend with his wife. He has learned to fill up the time in manageable amounts. But sometimes he miscalculates. On Good Friday, the stock market was closed, and so his office closed early as well. By 3:00 the secretaries had left and the phones had stopped ringing and there was nothing to do but to edge the convertible silver Mercedes onto the West Side Highway and head for home. There would be a lot of time left before dinner.\nHe drove slowly, but eventually he got there, and the big house was quiet and still, except for the indolent curiosity of the cat curled up in the bay window. He thought he was alone until he heard a closet bang upstairs. In a moment, his wife was in the room. She wanted to talk about the kitchen renovation, the new cabinets she’d ordered. He decided to go for a run, a long one that took him past the golf courses growing green in the sun.\nIt gave him time to consider another vexing question. “Would I change? Would I no longer be this guy we just talked about? I think so. I’m pretty sure.”\nYes, of course. And pigs will fly and the human heart will become a knowable thing and the mirror he looks into will suddenly show him a true and accurate reflection. “I don’t want to spend the rest of my life wondering what it would have been like,” he says. But he’s come too late to the idea that he can find some kind of emotional authenticity. He has yet to discover that his self-deception, like freckles or a tendency to fat, is a part of his DNA. He doesn’t see the monstrous selfishness that animates his quest, a selfishness that is best contained by the carefully bifurcated life he lives now.\nInstead, he thinks he can be different, and in that way, he, too, buys into the relentlessly redemptive tenor of the times. I think of him each Monday—because Monday is the hardest day for him—standing in that big corner office, looking at the phone, and I wonder whether he will finally call the woman he loves and I wonder what he will say.\nI hope he doesn’t, for his sake. His wife and his mistress can probably take care of themselves; after all, they have had a lot of practice. But it’s too late now for him to learn the lessons he has avoided so successfully, lessons not everyone is better off learning.\nBecause while love, as he suspects, can be a saving grace, it could also be the stake through his heart.",
