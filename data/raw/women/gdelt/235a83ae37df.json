From billionaire philanthropists to actors to sports stars, The Irish Times’s obituary writers have marked the deaths of more than 150 people this year.\nWhile they are remembered for different reasons, they have one thing in common – they all made an impact on Irish society or on the greater world. Many were household names, such as singers Sinéad O’Connor and Shane MacGowan, but others, such as Fr Brendan Forde, were not. The Franciscan priest spent more than 40 years helping the poorest communities in Latin America.\nOthers made huge strides in their chosen fields such as Prof Sarah Rogers, who was credited with modernising dermatological medicine in Ireland, or Michelin-star chef Colin O’Daly who cofounded Roly’s Bistro. There were people who had pushed their bodies to the limits, such as Noel Hanna who scaled Mount Everest 10 times, or Olympic bronze medal boxer Jim McCourt. And there were politicians such as Tras Honan, who broke glass ceilings, and Niamh Bhreathnach who introduced free third-level tuition.\nHere is a reminder of some of those whose deaths merited an obituary this year.\nREAD MORE\nCarol Anne Lowe\nOpera singer and actor\nCarol Anne Lowe, who died on January 5th, had many strings to her bow. The Dubliner was an acclaimed mezzo-soprano, an actor in the RTÉ soap Fair City and a businesswoman.\nWhen she was 23, she won the £15,000 Lombard and Ulster Music Bursary – the largest music bursary at the time. She had starring roles with the Dublin Grand Opera Society and the Rathmines & Rathgar and Glasnevin Musical Societies and appeared in The Pirates of Penzance and as Josephine in Noel Pearson’s production of HMS Pinafore at the Gaiety Theatre. She also appeared many times at the Cork Opera House and at the Wexford Opera House and frequently graced the stage of the National Concert Hall.\nShe regularly performed in Hamburg’s Musikhalle and gave many recitals in London, New York and in South Africa. She later set up Blue Moon Communications, where she worked as a business strategist and mentor. In her role as Francesca de Silva in Fair City, she became the love interest of mechanic Ray, played by Mick Nolan, and this led to the couple marrying in real life.\nLowe died on January 5th, aged 59.\nIda Delamer\nSilversmith\nLeading Irish expert in silver Ida Delamer was the first woman member of the Company of Goldsmiths of Dublin and later became master warden – the highest-ranking position in the governance structure. The company governs the assay office in Dublin Castle, which is responsible for hallmarking all items of gold, silver and platinum for sale in Ireland.\nShe was one of the first women to study architecture at University College Dublin but the ban on married women working meant she could not practise. However, her training ensured that she had excellent drawing skills and she put them to good use when producing the definitive chart of historical Irish silver hallmarks.\nWhile chairing the Royal Dublin Society crafts subcommittee in 1996, she introduced the Company of Goldsmiths Award. She was also involved in the initial stages of the restoration of the Dublin lord mayor’s ornamental coach in the 1970s.\nWith pianist John O’Conor, she was one of the founders of the Dublin International Piano Competition in 1988. She was also a trustee of the National Library for several years and chairwoman of the Silver Society, an international group of collectors, dealers, researchers and working silversmiths.\nIda Delamer died on January 7th, aged 91.\nJerry Enright\nSoldier\nBrig Gen Jerry Enright, who died on January 8th, aged 93, was lauded for his courage and decisiveness in an army career which included four tours of UN duty. He was the first officer on the scene of the aftermath of the Niemba ambush of Irish troops in 1960 in the Congolese province of Katanga.\nWhen the platoon under the command of Lieut Kevin Gleeson failed to return from patrol, the then Lieut Enright was given the task of leading a rescue. He found that eight soldiers, including Lieut Gleeson had been killed, while the body of Trooper Anthony Browne was recovered almost two years later. Lieut Enright was praised for the courage and leadership he showed in leading his platoon at such a traumatic time.\nHe went on to do three other tours of UN duty, in Cyprus, Lebanon and as chief military observer of the UN mission on the disputed border between Pakistan and India.\nBack at home, he was commanding officer of the 27th Battalion, based at Dundalk at the height of the hunger strikes. He also did several stints with the Equitation School, and as commanding officer of the Army Detention Centre with the Military Police.\nSéamus Begley\nMusician\nSéamus Begley, who died suddenly on January 9th, aged 73, was credited with bringing the traditional music of west Kerry to a global audience and was described by President Michael D Higgins as one of Ireland’s finest accordion players.\nA born collaborator, he made his first album with his sister Máire in 1973, and another one in 1989. But it was his collaboration with Australian guitarist Steve Cooney that produced the award-winning and seminal album Meitheal in 1992.\nBegley was known for his gloriously boisterous performances when his fiery rhythms pushed his accordion to its limits. But he was also a singer of extraordinary tenderness, and he was described by Waterboys musician Mike Scott as “the finest of all Irish musicians, and perhaps the most beautiful singer I’ve ever heard”.\nActor and musician John C Reilly said he was a legend of a man and a virtuosic player. “Not only was he easy to play with but songs would just flow out of him like water, it was incredible.”\n[ President leads tributes following death of traditional musician Séamus BegleyOpens in new window ]\nJohn Murray\nJudge\nJohn Murray held some of the most senior legal positions in the State including the roles of chief justice and attorney general. He was a judge of the European Court of Justice and a university chancellor and visiting lecturer. He died on January 18th, aged 79.\nThe Limerick-born senior counsel was twice appointed attorney general by taoiseach Charles Haughey, in 1982 and 1987. As attorney general, he drafted the wording of what would become the 1983 anti-abortion amendment, the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. He also refused to extradite Fr Patrick Ryan to face terrorism-related charges in Britain on the basis that he would not receive a fair trial, a decision that was strongly criticised by prime minister Margaret Thatcher.\nHis work in the European Court of Justice developed European law affecting issues such as equal pay rights, and internal trade barriers. He became a Supreme Court judge in 1989 and was known for delivering carefully drafted judgments with much thoughtful analysis. He served as chief justice from 2004 until 2011.\n[ Former chief justice John Murray remembered for 'wisdom and kindness' at funeralOpens in new window ]\nFr Micheál MacGréil\nSociologist\nJesuit, sociologist and campaigner Fr Micheál Mac Gréil was remembered as a voice for the marginalised and underprivileged when he died on January 21st, aged 93. He was a university lecturer, a trade unionist, and a campaigner for various causes including the rights of minorities, the promotion of the Irish language and the reopening of closed railway lines.\nHis friend Dr Michael Neary, former archbishop of Tuam, said he had led a life that was “radical, yet profoundly traditional”.\nHe was best known for his influential sociological research on prejudice, tolerance and pluralism. He denounced homophobia as one of the most invidious prejudices and said Ireland’s treatment of the Travellers must rank “as one of the most serious social embarrassments in the state’s 86 years of independence”.\nIn his memoir, The Ongoing Present, published 10 years ago, he wrote that some of his early research made Irish people aware of their prejudices and encouraged them to be more tolerant. But he warned that “we should not be under any illusion with regard to the persistence of racism, sexism, homophobia, ethnocentrism, anti-Semitism, class or religious prejudice.”\n[ Sociologist Fr Micheál Mac Gréil dies in Co MayoOpens in new window ]\nProf Michael O’Keeffe\nOphthalmologist\nPioneering paediatric eye surgeon Prof Michael O’Keeffe was described by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association as “a true visionary in medicine” when he died on January 25th, aged 71. The Cork-born doctor was a founder member of the association and was a consultant ophthalmologist at the Mater Private Hospital and Beacon Hospital in Dublin. He previously worked as a consultant at Temple Street Children’s Hospital, the Mater hospital, the Rotunda and National Maternity Hospital. He was also a clinical professor of paediatric ophthalmology in University College Dublin.\nBut while he was highly respected by the medical profession, it was the tributes from his many grateful patients and their parents that were the most striking after his death. They told of how he saved the eyesight of so many babies, and in some cases, saved their lives when they were faced with the potentially fatal condition of retinoblastoma. Féach, the support group for parents with visually impaired children, said there was hardly a visually impaired child or parent in the group who had not encountered him. “Prof O’Keeffe was not only an expert in his field, he was a beacon of hope,” the group said.\n[ Well known eye surgeon Prof Michael O’Keeffe diesOpens in new window ]\nNiamh Bhreathnach\nPolitician\nNiamh Bhreathnach was the first Labour member to become a minister for education and she wasted no time in making her mark. Her time in the Dáil was short – she lost her seat in the next election five years later – but it was characterised by radical initiatives.\nThe former teacher left what President Michael D Higgins described as an “extraordinary” legacy of educational reform. “That legacy includes the abolition of third-level undergraduate tuition fees and significant increases in education spending, the introduction of the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme, and making the transition year programme available to all second-level schools, any of which on their own would reflect a significant term of office,” he said.\nShe also introduced the RSE (Relationships and Sexuality Education) programme, encountering strong opposition from some conservative quarters; the Social, Personal and Health Education programme; and the new subject of Civic Social and Political Education.\nHer “Breaking the Cycle” initiative targeted schools in disadvantaged areas and would later become the Deis programme. She also oversaw the designation of the Regional Technical Colleges as Institutes of Education.\nNiamh Bhreathnach died on February 6th, aged 77.\n[ Niamh Bhreathnach's legacy is combating educational disadvantage, funeral hearsOpens in new window ]\nJames Flynn\nFilm maker\nJames Flynn was a key figure in the recent growth of the Irish film industry and an inspiration to a generation of young filmmakers. His death on February 11th, at the age of 57, came just weeks after The Banshees of Inisherin received nine Oscar nominations. He was co-producer on that Martin McDonagh film. Other film credits include Angela’s Ashes, The Secret of Kells, Ondine, Nora and Calvary.\nAlong with producer Morgan O’Sullivan, James Flynn brought productions such as The Tudors, Vikings, Vikings Valhalla, and Penny Dreadful to Ireland.\nHe was business manager and later deputy chief executive of the reconstituted Irish Film Board, now known as Screen Ireland. Colleagues talked about his open and honest nature and ability to work well with people to get things done.\nIrish Times film correspondent Donald Clarke wrote in his obituary that one of his most significant legacies may prove to be the RTÉ series Love/Hate. It helped launch emerging actors such as Barry Keoghan, Ruth Negga, Charlie Murphy and Tom Vaughan-Lawlor.\nCo-founder of Element Pictures Andrew Lowe said he always found time to help others “and took genuine pleasure in the success of his peers”.\n[ James Flynn, coproducer of The Banshees of Inisherin, dies aged 57Opens in new window ]\nDeirdre Purcell\nWriter\nDeirdre Purcell (77) was one of Ireland’s best-known fiction writers, but she enjoyed success in many other fields. The Dubliner’s broadcasting career began as a continuity announcer with RTÉ and she went on to become the first woman staff newsreader on RTÉ Television’s Nine O’Clock News. She was an award-winning feature writer with the Sunday Tribune and, in her earlier life, an actress with the Abbey Theatre. In her wide-ranging work for RTÉ, she also presented It Says in the Papers for RTÉ Radio’s Morning Ireland for six years.\nShe ghostwrote RTÉ chatshow host Gay Byrne’s autobiography, The Time of My Life in 1989 and followed this with her first novel, A Place of Stones in 1991. It became an instant best-seller and many more books followed. One of her best-known, Falling for a Dancer, was made into a four-part BBC series in 1998 starring a young Colin Farrell. Her 1997 novel, Love Like Hate Adore, was shortlisted for the prestigious Orange Prize, now the Women’s Prize for Fiction. Her Hachette publisher Ciara Considine said she was “a formidable spirit and a leading light in Ireland’s literary scene for over 30 years”.\nDeirdre Purcell died suddenly on February 13th.\nFrank Feely\nDublin city manager\nFrank Feely was a larger-than-life Dublin city manager who presided over the capital for 17 years until his retirement in 1996. “If anyone could be said to have ‘run’ Dublin... it is Frank Feely,” wrote Frank McDonald in this newspaper when his term of office came to an end. He was also Dublin county manager until the county was reorganised into three councils in the early 1990s.\nUnlike previous city managers who were relatively anonymous, he was a public figure, revelling in major occasions such as the visit of Bill Clinton in 1995. He spearheaded the Dublin Millennium celebrations in 1988, which included commemorative milk bottles, the floating of a giant sculpture of Gulliver up the Liffey, the introduction of the Anna Livia fountain on O’Connell Street, and the unveiling of the Molly Malone statue. While the actual date of the city’s foundation was contested by historians, the celebrations for the millennium gave the city a welcome boost in a recessionary period.\nHe was also credited with initiating new housing schemes, city parks, pedestrian streets and the floodlighting of landmarks such as the Ha’penny Bridge. He died on February 20th, aged 91.\n[ Frank Feely, former Dublin city manager, dies at 91Opens in new window ]\nCamille Souter\nArtist\nCamille Souter was hailed as a giant of Irish art, after news emerged of her death on March 3rd. Maureen Kennelly, director of the Arts Council, said the 93-year-old had created an “extraordinary body of work over the course of almost 70 years” and said she had made a profound contribution to the visual arts in Ireland.\nShe initially trained as a nurse but contracted tuberculosis and decided to become an artist. She quickly gained a reputation for producing work of outstanding quality. Drawn towards unconventional subjects, she created abstract works with what has been described as a “statuesque elegance”.\nShe avoided the limelight yet still won a slew of awards for her work, including the Landscape Award at the Oireachtas Exhibition in 1973, the Gainey Award with Patrick Collins in 1975, the Prix de Ville de Monaco 1977 and first prize at the Claremorris Exhibition in 1978.\nShe received the highest accolade an artist can get in Ireland when she was elected saoi of Aosdána in 2008. Aosdána said her work was “reminiscent of the rich colouration, loosely painterly technique and straightforward gaze of French Realism”.\nRita O’Hare\nPolitical activist\nRita O’Hare, who died aged 80 on March 3rd, was a former IRA member and one of the most senior and influential members of Sinn Féin. She was editor of An Phoblacht and was the party’s director of publicity. She was also Sinn Féin general secretary and the party’s representative in Washington, where she was photographed with the likes of Barack Obama and Joe Biden.\nShe was an active member of the IRA in the early 1970s and was arrested in 1972 for the attempted murder of British army warrant officer Frazer Paton. She absconded on bail to the Republic and efforts to have her extradited failed. She continued her IRA activities there and served a three-year sentence in Limerick Prison on explosives charges.\nShe was a central figure in the “on the runs” legislation, which was designed to ensure former republican paramilitaries could return to Northern Ireland without fear of prosecution.\nSinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said she had been an integral part of the Sinn Féin leadership. “Rita worked with great drive, energy and ability for the unity of Ireland, for a more just society, and for the cause of peace and reconciliation.”\n[ Rita O'Hare an 'unstoppable force for Irish freedom', funeral hearsOpens in new window ]\nKenneth Montgomery\nConductor\nDescribed as the doyen of Irish conductors, Kenneth Montgomery was the first local musician as well as the first Irishman to become principal conductor of the Ulster Orchestra in 2007.\nThe Belfast-born conductor began his career with Glyndebourne Festival Opera, aged 20, and the English National Opera (then known as Sadler’s Wells Opera). He was later appointed assistant conductor to both the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and Sinfonietta, and he made the first of three consecutive appearances at Wexford Festival Opera in 1971.\nMuch of his career was in Europe, particularly the Netherlands where he settled. He also enjoyed a long relationship with Santa Fe Opera, conducting numerous productions there between 1982 and 2014. In 1985, he was appointed artistic and musical director of Opera Northern Ireland and in 1991 he was made director of opera studies at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague.\nHe was awarded an OBE in the Queen’s new year Honours List in 2010 for services to music in Northern Ireland and he received an Honorary Doctorate of Literature in Music from Queen’s University Belfast in recognition of his outstanding contribution to music. He died on March 5th, aged 79.\n[ The conducting detectiveOpens in new window ]\nDr Moira Woods\nDoctor and campaigner\nDr Moira Woods, who died on March 27th aged 89, was the medical director of Ireland’s first sexual assault treatment unit in Dublin’s Rotunda Hospital and was a co-founder of the Women’s Liberation Movement in Ireland in the 1960s.\nShe was prominent in the movement against the 1983 constitutional amendment which gave the foetus equal rights to the mother. She was the doctor who cared for the 14-year-old rape victim in the 1992 X case, which led to the Supreme Court case establishing the right to an abortion if the pregnant woman’s life was at risk.\nDr Woods also worked in the Dublin Well Woman Centre and was codirector of the Irish Family Planning Association, giving women access to contraceptives at a time when many family doctors did not prescribe them.\nIn 1997, Dr Woods was subjected to a Medical Council Fitness to Practise Committee inquiry, following allegations of professional misconduct in relation to her diagnosis of sexual abuse of children in five families in the 1980s. The inquiry found her guilty regarding her diagnoses in three families, but not in two others. She was not struck off the medical register, but was advised to work in multidisciplinary teams in the future. She took sabbatical leave and thereafter moved to live in Italy for the next 26 years. She never appealed the verdict or spoke publicly about it, but many of her colleagues felt she was unfairly judged.\nFreddie Scappaticci\nIRA double agent\nNews of the death of Freddie Scappaticci, who was alleged to have been the British army’s top mole in the Provisional IRA, emerged in April after his funeral had been held. He was in his late 70s.\nThe west Belfast man had always denied that he was the agent known as Stakeknife. It was alleged that he had been the head of the IRA’s “nutting squad”, interrogating suspected informers during the Troubles. He had been described as the jewel in the crown of British military intelligence in Northern Ireland and is believed to have been responsible for at least 20 deaths.\nThe son of an Italian immigrant, he was believed to have been recruited in 1978 and was “outed” in 2003 in a report written by Belfast-based journalist Greg Harkin and by a man using the pseudonym Martin Ingram – a former member of the British army’s Force Research Unit (FRU) which ran Stakeknife.\nAn interim report from Operation Kenova’s investigation into his alleged activities is expected in early 2024. The inquiry has already forwarded files to the North’s Public Prosecution Service (PPS). It recently decided against prosecuting 16 people investigated, citing insufficient evidence but has yet to make a decision on other files.\nPeadar Tomás MacRuairí\nIrish language activist and journalist\nJournalist and Irish language activist Peadar Tomás (PT) MacRuairí, died on April 20th, aged 83, after a brief illness, having spent his life working on his two passions.\nHe served as president of Conradh na Gaeilge, the social and cultural organisation which promotes the Irish language, from 1998 to 2003. He was a founder of the Craobh Bhréanainn branch of Conradh na Gaeilge, and also served as Conradh press officer, editor of Rosc magazine and co-ordinator of events to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Rising. Conradh na Gaeilge’s Paula Melvin described him as “a giant in the Irish language and in Irish life”.\nHis journalism career began at age of 14 when he wrote an article for the Dundalk Democrat. He wrote in English and Irish for many outlets and was a highly respected as a fair and accurate court reporter with the Irish Press. When it closed in 1995, he continued this work on a freelance basis and went on to set up CCC Nuacht, a courts news agency.\nHe was also a driving force behind Near FM community radio station, and Raidió na Life, Dublin’s Irish language station.\nDr Mick Loftus\nGAA past president\nDr Mick Loftus was remembered as one of the most active public figures to have held the office of GAA president after he died on April 22nd, aged 93. When he became GAA president in 1985, he was the first Mayo person to take on the role.\nHe was a member of the last Mayo senior football panel to win an All-Ireland final, in 1951. He was a sub on the team and did not play on the day. After his retirement from playing, he served as a referee at club and county level, refereeing the All-Ireland finals in 1965 and 1968. He was also chairman of the Connacht GAA Council and chaired the GAA centenary committee which organised the association’s 100th anniversary celebrations in 1984.\nHe ran a GP practice in Crossmolina and was coroner for north Mayo for many years. Dr Loftus was outspoken on the issue of alcohol abuse and questioned the level of involvement of the drinks industry in major sporting events and festivals.\nAn advocate of healthy ageing, he won four medals for Ireland in the 75-79 age category in the world Senior Games in St George, Utah, in 2006.\nMary Kerrigan\nJournalist and political adviser\nMary Kerrigan enjoyed a storied career in politics, journalism, law and public service, before her death on April 25th, at the age of 64.\nThe Sligo-born journalist worked with the Independent and Press news groups, winning accolades such as an AT Cross Woman Journalist Award in 1984. She was deputy features editor at the Sunday Press when she left to become Fianna Fáil’s first woman press director in 1993. Tánaiste Micheál Martin remembered her as a sincere person who was great fun and lived life to the full. She returned to journalism to work at the Sunday Press just before it closed and served brief stints as deputy editor of the INN radio news service, and political correspondent of Ireland on Sunday.\nShe worked as a barrister on the Dublin and midlands circuit for almost a decade before joining the Brussels office of EU internal markets commissioner, Charlie McCreevy. She followed this with a move to the European Court of Auditors in Luxembourg before returning home to work with the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman in 2015. She also found time to write That’s Politics, a guide to the European and local elections, in 2004.\nJohnny Fean\nMusician\nHorslips guitarist Johnny Fean was described as one of Ireland’s foremost electric lead guitarists when he died on April 28th, aged 71.\nThe band rose to fame in the 1970s with its distinctive blend of rock music fused with Irish traditional tunes. But it was his guitar playing on Dearg Doom that elevated him to the ranks of international guitar heroes. He later said Dearg Doom with its iconic guitar riff had “changed everything in Irish rock music”. Minister for Culture Catherine Martin said his guitar playing “was fundamental to Horslips’ groundbreaking trad infused rock music, still so widely loved to this day”.\nDearg Doom got a new lease of life when it was sampled for Put ‘Em Under Pressure – the official song of the Republic of Ireland soccer team during the 1990 World Cup.\nHorslips created nine original studio albums between 1970 and 1980 before breaking up. He continued to perform with band members Eamon Carr and Charles O’Connor in The Zen Alligators, and The Host, before moving to the UK. He embarked on irregular live shows with the band when they reunited in 2004, and again in 2009, while also performing with Miami Showband bassist Stephen Travers.\n[ Horslips guitarist Johnny Fean dies aged 71Opens in new window ]\nSeán Keane\nMusician\nThe death of The Chieftains’ fiddle player Seán Keane (76) on May 7th was described as a huge loss for traditional Irish music. Fiddle player Martin Hayes said he was “one of the finest traditional musicians to ever play this music” and was “a completely unique and virtuoso fiddle player”.\nLiam O’Connor, director of the Irish Traditional Music Archive, described Keane as “a beacon for our traditional art”. The archive holds a large collection of his recordings and in 2022 it released a documentary with him, Seán Keane: The Portrait of an Artist, which premiered at the Willie Clancy Summer School in Miltown Malbay.\nThe Dubliner joined The Chieftains in 1968. Together they won six Grammy Awards as they brought traditional Irish music to new audiences in the United States and across the world. His three solo albums were described as seminal recordings in traditional music circles while his duet album with his fellow Chieftain Matt Molloy was also warmly received. He was named Traditional Musician of the Year at the TG4 Gradam Ceoil awards in 2004.\nKeane performed with The Chieftains for US President Joe Biden when he visited Ballina in April.\nPeter Brooke\nPolitician\nThe role played by former secretary of state for Northern Ireland Peter Brooke in the emerging peace process was highlighted after his death on May 13th at the age of 89.\nAs Northern Ireland secretary in 1990, he made a significant statement when he said Britain had no “selfish strategic or economic interest” in Northern Ireland and would accept unification if the people wished it. Around the same time, he initiated “talks about talks” to secure devolved government. The initiative did not immediately succeed but it was credited with shaping the process that led to the Belfast Agreement in 1998.\nHe became embroiled in controversy in January 1992 when he sang a song, My Darling Clementine, on the Late Late Show on the night when seven Protestant construction workers were killed by an IRA bomb. He later explained that he had been disconcerted on the night when presenter Gay Byrne unexpectedly asked him about the traumatic death of his first wife, and he was then cajoled into singing the only song he knew.\nHe apologised unreservedly but was dropped from cabinet by prime minister John Major a few months later. He returned as heritage secretary and later lifted the broadcasting ban on Sinn Féin.\n[ Tributes paid to Peter Brooke, 89, who played 'pivotal role' in peace processOpens in new window ]\nGraham Knuttel\nArtist\nGraham Knuttel was one of the most successful and prolific painters of his generation before his death on May 27th, at the age of 69.\nThe Dubliner’s stylised paintings in bright colours were instantly recognisable and often imitated. He was known for creating shady looking figures in sharp suits and populating his work with birds, chefs, cats and sailors.\nA student of Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design, he initially drew attention for his sculptures, winning the Royal Canada Trust Award for Young Sculptors in 1976.\nHe later switched focus to figurative painting and became a household name during the Celtic Tiger era when some of his originals sold for six-figure sums. His collectors and admirers included Robert De Niro, Sylvester Stallone, Frank Sinatra and the Swiss Bank Corporation. His work hung in many fashionable restaurants such as La Stampa, which commissioned paintings from him.\nCollaborations included two Knuttel-designed stamps for An Post to mark the 2008 Beijing Olympics, a ceramic tableware line with Tipperary Crystal, and a silver chess set with Viscount Linley (now Lord Snowdon).\n[ Graham Knuttel: 10 things you didn't know about the artistOpens in new window ]\nHugh Callaghan\nBirmingham Six member\nHugh Callaghan, one of the Birmingham Six wrongly jailed for IRA bombings in 1974, died on May 27th, aged 93. Despite the trauma of being imprisoned for more than 16 years for something he did not do, he forgave his captors and remained positive.\nA Belfast native, Mr Callaghan and the five other men were rounded up by police after the IRA blew up the Mulberry Bush and Tavern pubs in the centre of Birmingham on November 21st, 1974. Some 21 people were killed and a further 182 injured in the attack.\nAfter beatings, long interrogations, deprivation of food and sleep and a mock execution, false confessions were extracted from the six men by West Midlands Police. They received life sentences in 1975 but serious doubts were cast on the convictions, and they were eventually declared unsafe and unsatisfactory in 1991, following a lengthy campaign.\nHugh Callaghan wrote his autobiography, Cruel Fate, with Sally Mulready, who had championed the men’s innocence. Her daughter Molly said she believed the secret of his latterly happy life was that he was able to forgive those who had mistreated him. “He was a remarkable, gentle soul. There was not a hint of bitterness in him.”\nPeter Harbison\nArchaeologist\nDr Peter Harbison was one of the best-known archaeologists in this country, yet he never occupied a post in any Irish university school of archaeology. He had a long career working as an archaeologist for Bord Fáilte from 1966 and was remembered after his death for his skill in communicating of the sheer scale of the riches of Ireland’s cultural past. His work was credited with playing a key role in the development of cultural tourism in Ireland.\nHe was also a prolific author and his three-volume study, The High Crosses of Ireland, is regarded as the definitive work on the subject. In recognition of his work, he was elected an honorary member of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, an honorary fellow of Trinity College Dublin, an honorary member of the Royal Hibernian Academy, and a member of the Royal Irish Academy. UCD awarded him an honorary PhD in 2022.\nDr Harbison also served as editor of Bord Fáilte’s Ireland of the Welcomes magazine. The magazine twice won special awards from the International Regional Magazines Association during his tenure. He died on May 30th, aged 84.\n[ All things bright and beautifulOpens in new window ]\nMichael Viney\nNature writer and illustrator\nThe former Irish Times columnist Michael Viney died on May 30th, mere months after penning his final Another Life column. He was 90 years old.\nThe journalist and illustrator submitted his first article to the newspaper when he left the Evening Standard in London to spend a year in Ireland in 1962. In that first article, he wrote of his plan to fish, cook, write and paint. “I’ll be a different person in a year’s time,” he predicted.\nAt first, he covered social affairs for the newspaper but in 1977, he moved with his wife, Ethna, and their daughter, Michele, from Dublin to Thallabawn, Co Mayo, to live as self-sufficiently as possible. He chronicled their experiences and wrote about nature in his Another Life column, accompanying the words with his meticulous illustrations.\nHe also trained as a producer/director with RTÉ in the 1970s and wrote and directed documentaries on Tim Robinson and Michael Longley. With his wife Ethna, he made several landscape-based films for RTÉ and TG4.\nHis final book, Natural world, was published four months after his death and was described by his daughter Michele as a celebration of his life.\n[ Michael Viney: 20 of his finest drawings and paintings from a 60-year careerOpens in new window ]\nBronwyn Conroy\nBeauty school founder\nBronwyn Conroy made history when she set up the first beauty therapy training school in Ireland in 1972, ensuring that her name would always be synonymous with the beauty business.\nOriginally from Galway, she was so determined to follow a career in cosmetics that she offered her services free of charge to Lydon’s pharmacy on Shop Street in order to learn the trade. Her ability to sell was noted and she was soon taken on as an employee. While she was working there, the US manager of Helena Rubinstein cosmetics brand visited the shop and was so impressed by her that he offered her a job. She later left Helena Rubinstein for Revlon and became its director of training in Ireland for 12 years.\nShe discovered that teaching was her forte and the experience led her to open her own training school on Dublin’s Mount Street Upper.

They married in 1973 and settled in Kilkenny in 1990, making regular forays to the Isles of Scilly, the Bahamas and the Canary Islands.\nShe exhibited extensively with regular shows at Taylor Galleries in Dublin and a major retrospective at IMMA in 2005.

He was named Texaco Footballer of the Year in 1989, when he secured his first senior football All-Ireland medal.\n1990 was his most talked-about year, as he was on the winning team when Cork hurlers beat Galway in the All-Ireland final and again a fortnight later when the Cork footballers beat Meath. The feat was even more impressive because he had spent July with his foot in plaster and had only returned to training in August.\nEver modest, he ran into the dressing room when the whistle sounded so he would not take attention from his team-mates. He was critical of both performances, saying: “I was nowhere near match fit in the hurling final, but I at least made a contribution with three points... I reckon the football final was one of the poorest matches I played.”\n[ Teddy McCarthy was the GAA's unrivalled dual star, and Cork's one of a kindOpens in new window ]\nChristy Dignam\nSinger\nAfter a long battle with illness, Aslan frontman Christy Dignam died on June 13th, at the age of 63.

His almost three-hour-long funeral Mass in Nenagh will be remembered as one of the most extraordinary ceremonies to be held in an Irish church, with a stellar list of mourners and performers.\nThe Pogues carved out a distinctive sound by fusing traditional Irish airs with frenetic punk energy. The poetic nature of his song lyrics would ensure that, in Bruce Springsteen’s words, his words would still be sung in 100 years.\nA cover of Ewan MacColl’s Dirty Old Town got the Pogues on Top of the Pops, but it was Fairytale of New York, recorded with Kirsty MacColl, that will forever be associated with him.\nHis drink and drug-fuelled lifestyle led to his sacking from the band in 1991 but he rejoined The Pogues in 2001.
