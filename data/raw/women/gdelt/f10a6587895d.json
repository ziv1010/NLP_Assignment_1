  "body_text": "By Mata Press Service\nCanada is urging football fans, athletes and officials to apply early for visas and travel permits as the country prepares to co-host the FIFA World Cup 26 with the United States and Mexico.\nImmigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada said the tournament, running from June 11 to July 19, 2026, will bring hundreds of thousands of visitors to matches in Toronto and Vancouver, with 13 games scheduled to be played on Canadian soil.\nFederal officials said immigration planning is already underway to ensure smooth and secure entry for players, coaches, officials, volunteers and fans travelling from around the world. Visitors are being advised not to wait until the last minute to apply for visas or electronic travel authorizations.\n“A match ticket isn’t a ticket into Canada,” Immigration Minister Lena Metlege Diab said in a statement. “Visitors need to prepare early by applying online for the necessary travel documents so they can be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.”\nCanada is expected to host teams and supporters from countries including Germany, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Panama, Croatia, Senegal, Australia, New Zealand, Egypt, Belgium, Qatar and Switzerland. Most visitors will need either a visitor visa or an electronic travel authorization to enter or transit through Canada.\nIRCC has launched a dedicated FIFA World Cup 26 webpage outlining entry requirements and how to apply for visas, work permits or eTAs. Officials stressed that holding World Cup tickets does not guarantee entry into Canada, and border officers will make the final decision when travellers arrive.\nThe 2026 tournament will feature 48 national teams and is expected to draw millions of visitors across North America. Canada, the United States and Mexico are coordinating closely on border management, transportation and security to support the movement of fans and teams throughout the competition.\nHosting the World Cup is projected to create nearly 25,000 jobs in Canada and add about $2 billion to the national economy. Officials expect matches in Toronto and Vancouver to draw hundreds of thousands of visitors, providing a boost to tourism, hospitality and local businesses.\nCanada has previously hosted major international sporting events, including the FIFA Women’s World Cup in 2015, the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and the 2015 Pan Am and Parapan Am Games in Toronto. Federal officials say that experience will help support the logistics of the 2026 tournament.\nLeave a comment",
