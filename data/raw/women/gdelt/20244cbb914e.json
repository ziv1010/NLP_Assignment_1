While closed, we’ve been exploring the history of Siberry’s Cottage, the original tea house run by Robert and Margaret Siberry and their family. Family folklore speaks of an early visitors’ book signed by W. B Yeats, dating from the late 1800s/early 1900s.\n“The earliest book we have starts in 1942. It’s believed Uncle Dick loaned the earlier book to someone in the 1970s, possibly for research, and it was never returned. If you know where it might be, we’d love to hear from you: glencarteashed@gmail.com.\n“We’d also love your memories of the old cottage,” Helen also added. Hopefully the pre 1942 Glencar Tea Shed visitor’s book will be located.\nMental Health Help\nThe national mental health organisation GROW is offering help to anyone who is having difficulties with anxiety, depression or loneliness.
