The answer would be, An inviolable respect for the Constitution and Laws — the first growing out of the last. … A sacred respect for the constitutional law is the vital principle, the sustaining energy of a free government.” —Alexander Hamilton (1794)\nIN TODAY’S DIGEST\n- A ‘Border’ Bill Doomed to Failure\n- The Cartel Influence in Mexico\n- Executive News Summary\n- Canada’s Psychiatric Death Panels on Pause\n- Time to End U.S. Funding of UNRWA\n- The Super Bowl Will Again Feature Two ‘National Anthems’\n- DAILY FEATURES: Reader Comments, Videos, Best of Right Opinion, Short Cuts, Memes, and Cartoons.\nON THE WEB\n- Mark Alexander: Profiles of Valor: Pueblo’s MoH Recipients\n- Caleb Nunes: Untouchable Untenables\n- Mike Rhinehart: Being a Nemophilist\n- In Brief: Israel’s Untold Gaza Progress\n- In Honor of President Ronald Reagan\nFEATURED ANALYSIS\nA ‘Border’ Bill Doomed to Failure\nAfter weeks of secretive haggling, the Senate’s so-called “bipartisan border deal” is nothing of the sort.\nDouglas Andrews\nThe bill is as bad as we thought — every bit, and then some.\nDetails of the highly secretive “Bipartisan Border Deal,” as the National Review headline calls it, finally became public Sunday evening, but since when is a bill whose expenditure on border security is only one-sixth of its total price tag called a “border deal”? What “security” is there when Senator Chris Murphy admits, “The border never closes”?\nIt’s called a “border deal” because poll after poll after poll shows that the border is the one issue that the American people care about overwhelmingly. But what this bill is, if we’re bound by truth in advertising, is a Ukraine and Israel and Palestinian deal with a bit of border security sprinkled in just to placate the rubes.\nThe $118.3 billion legislation, which checks in at 370 pages and which could also be called The Joe Biden Reelection Lifeline bill, is as full of holes as we’d been warned about. Among the bill’s ingredients: $20 billion for border security, the end of Biden’s disastrous “catch and release” policy, an expansion of detention capacity for families, a raising of asylum standards and fast-tracking of asylum claims, 50,000 new visas over five years, and a measly $650 million to expand the border wall. Oh, and $60 billion for Ukraine, $14 billion for Israel, and $10 billion for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. We can’t make this stuff up.\nJames Lankford, whose motives we’ve been wondering about, and who ostensibly led Republican efforts to craft the bill but who talks about it as if he’s the subject of a hostage video, tried to pitch the bill on Fox News yesterday. “Some people are thinking that this is somehow like counting 5,000 people in every day and releasing them,” he said of the bill’s most objectionable components. “That’s absurd. We changed the asylum laws, we increased detention beds, we doubled the deportation flights, we added ankle monitors. … There’s all the things that we build into this to make this a much stronger system.”\nUh-huh. Of course, all of this assumes that the Biden administration will actually live up to its end of the bargain on border enforcement. And if history is any guide, it won’t. Just ask Ronald Reagan how Democrats abide by their immigration deals.\nLankford refers to “5,000 people” because the bill has a trigger mechanism that activates once a seven-day average of 5,000 “encounters” with border crossers is reached. But as Andrew McCarthy explains, “Encounter is the euphemism the Department of Homeland Security uses for apprehensions of illegal aliens at ports of entry and elsewhere — it doesn’t say apprehension or arrest because that would imply detention, which is not happening in most cases.” That would certainly continue under Biden, bolstered by legislation that codifies releasing migrants.\nThe Senate is scheduled to vote on the bill tomorrow, but it’ll likely be an exercise in futility. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is reportedly backing away from it.\nSo is House Speaker Mike Johnson. “I’ve seen enough,” said Johnson on Sunday night. “This bill is even worse than we expected, and won’t come close to ending the border catastrophe the President has created. … If this bill reaches the House, it will be dead on arrival.” On top of all this, a House impeachment vote on Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is scheduled for this evening.\nIn case Johnson’s remarks left any doubt, his fellow Louisianan, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, said, “Let me be clear: The Senate Border Bill will NOT receive a vote in the House.”\nTownhall’s Katie Pavlich lists five reasons why the bill is DOA: “President Biden doesn’t need legislation to fix the border catastrophe he started; The bill provides more funding for Ukraine’s borders than the U.S. southern border with Mexico; The bill forces taxpayers to pay for attorneys to represent illegal immigrants breaking the law; The bill provides paltry funding [less than 1% of the price tag] for additional border wall construction; The legislation allows for thousands of illegal crossings to continue.” Stopping illegal crossings was supposed to be the whole point of things, right?\nFormer Trump policy adviser Stephen Miller has dug deeply into the weeds of the bill, and he points to some of its most insidious aspects:\nThe Asylum Court at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services within the Department of Homeland Security is the radical Left of the radical Left. That is the deep state of DHS. This gives them the power to rapidly grant newly arriving illegal aliens full asylum benefits. So in other words, Mayorkas is the unilateral decider of who gets asylum. What does that mean? If you get asylum, you get instantaneous access to federal welfare — such as food stamps, public housing, free healthcare. A year later, you have a green card, and four years after that, you can be a full-voting American citizen with access to chain migration and everything else American citizens get. And you certainly are not ever going to be deported.\nMiller went on to warn that this legislation would completely exempt unaccompanied minors from immigration enforcement — meaning that anyone 17 or under can’t be turned away at the border, which creates an avenue into the U.S. for the gangs, the cartels, the drug smuggling, the human trafficking, and all the other lawless activity associated with unaccompanied teens.\n“We need a frank discussion about what the incentive is here,” said Tennessee Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, “They’re going to continue to do this because we know how congressional seats and electoral votes are allocated. They’re allocated based on the number of people in a given state — not the number of citizens, but the number of people. The more illegals that go there, the more political power they get because the more congressional seats they get.”\nAnother Tennessean, Republican Congressman Chuck Fleischmann, put it this way: “I’ll never support a so-called ‘border security deal’ that increases illegal immigration, normalizes Biden’s Border Crisis, and allows thousands of illegal aliens to continue flooding into our country. The American People want border security — not fake deals that won’t secure the border.”\nOn Sunday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott welcomed 13 other Republican governors to Eagle Pass, which is ground zero for Joe Biden’s intentional illegal immigration disaster. “Texas is the only state in the history of the United States of America to build our own border wall,” he said. “All that we want is to enforce the immigration laws of the United States.”\nAs Georgia Governor Brian Kemp pithily put it there at Eagle Pass, “If our border is not secure, our country is not secure.”\nIn the end, we find ourselves looking at a 370-page legislative abomination with all sorts of twists and turns and cleverly engineered loopholes. But the Republican Party could’ve avoided all this by driving a very simple bargain: They could’ve demanded that Joe Biden enforce the laws that we have on the books and exercise his existing authority to close the border.\nIndeed, as McCarthy notes, “Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (codified at Title 8, United States Code, §1182(f)) clearly states in pertinent part: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants.”\nWhat on earth does funding for Ukraine and Israel have to do with our southern border crisis and our national sovereignty?\nAnswer: nothing.\nThe Cartel Influence in Mexico\nMexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador denies he’s in cahoots with the cartels, but there’s plenty of evidence to the contrary.\nMichael Swartz\nNearly six years ago, this author surmised that the then-incoming president of Mexico was on the take. “Obrador is a socialist who proposes income redistribution to students and seniors, government picking winners and losers in the energy sector, and possible amnesty for some drug criminals. He’s backed by the drug cartels, you see.”\nWhile the assertion may have come across as a fairly educated guess, the truth is that our government had been investigating a tie between the cartels and Andrés Manuel López Obrador (better known by the initials AMLO) for over a decade, beginning with a probe into his unsuccessful 2006 campaign, which he lost by a whisker, and which led to supporters crying fraud and months-long mass protests and demands for a recount. (Honestly, they made Donald Trump and the J6 crowd look like pikers.)\nInterestingly enough, two separate yet fairly complementary investigative pieces on AMLO have come out in the last few days as he enters the final few months of his single term. In his piece, Tim Golden of ProPublica asserts:\nYears before Andrés Manuel López Obrador was elected as Mexico’s leader in 2018, U.S. drug-enforcement agents uncovered what they believed was substantial evidence that major cocaine traffickers had funneled some $2 million to his first presidential campaign.\nAccording to more than a dozen interviews with U.S. and Mexican officials and government documents reviewed by ProPublica, the money was provided to campaign aides in 2006 in return for a promise that a López Obrador administration would facilitate the traffickers’ criminal operations.\nThe investigation did not establish whether López Obrador sanctioned or even knew of the traffickers’ reported donations. But officials said the inquiry — which was built on the extensive cooperation of a former campaign operative and a key drug informant — did produce evidence that one of López Obrador’s closest aides had agreed to the proposed arrangement.\nFor his part, writing for the website InSight Crime, investigator Steven Dudley revealed what was called “Operation Polanco”:\nThe DEA agents believed that during the 2006 presidential election, (Mauricio Soto Caballero) had worked as a political coordinator for AMLO and, among other tasks, had channeled millions of dollars from a Mexican drug trafficking organization to the AMLO campaign. Nab Soto, they thought, and they would take a step closer to finding out if AMLO knew his campaign had received drug money.\nIt was a bold criminal case and not one that agents typically tackle, given the challenges and potential political pitfalls of going after a would-be president. Investigations like this illustrate how organized crime seeks to get its hooks into politicians at the highest levels, but they are incredibly complicated. Money is moved in cash, so there is typically no paper trail. Witnesses are often criminals, making juries and fellow law enforcement alike reluctant to rely on their word. Going after high-level political targets can undermine an agent’s career and upend diplomatic relations.\nWhile we’ve talked at length about the U.S.-Mexican border over the past several months, the media hasn’t delved as deeply into some of what the Biden administration loves to call the “root causes” of the influx of illegal immigrants.\nMost average Mexicans live a hardscrabble life, which makes them desirous of a place where they can make an honest living and not have to sleep with one eye open because of constant criminal threats. Unfortunately, as our since-retired Arnold Ahlert assessed back in 2019 after an incident in which an outmanned and outgunned Mexican military surrendered two prisoners to cartel members, “Mexico has officially become a narco-state.”\nSo it seems like the only ways to make a life in Mexico are either to leave by making a deal with the cartels and crossing the border as an illegal immigrant, or stay home and do one of two things: finagling a job with the government, or starting at the bottom with the cartels, doing simple tasks and earning the trust of the local kingpin. Then again, these investigations seem to show that both those options are becoming one and the same, as the cartels and government meld together with the drug families’ influence extending to the very top of Mexican politics.\nAs one would expect, AMLO is denying he’s on the take, even demanding an apology from Joe Biden. But as National Review’s Jim Geraghty observes: “If you are accused of being in the pocket of a drug cartel and not really being committed to stopping cross-border drug trafficking, I don’t think you bolster your reputation by threatening to curtail bilateral cooperation on stopping cross-border drug trafficking. Note that this is not the first time López Obrador has made public comments indicating he’s much more interested in denouncing U.S. DEA agents than in denouncing any of the cartels terrorizing his country.”\nAnd we haven’t even looked at the fentanyl pipeline that runs between labs in China that make the ingredients and the cartel-operated facilities that create the finished product being carted across the border by desperate Mexican mules. If this is part of the “strong partnership” the Biden administration claims to have with AMLO, we have a real problem on our hands.\nJust like in America, 2024 happens to be an election year in Mexico. While AMLO can’t run for a second six-year term, the wide lead in polls for former Mexico City Head of Government Claudia Sheinbaum — whose path to the presidency would be the same as AMLO’s, up to and including the same Mexico City leadership position and party affiliation — suggests that we may have more of the same lack of cooperation for the next six years.\nWill her loyalty be to the Mexican people or to the cartels? Given what we’re learning about the incumbent, that’s a fair question.\nExecutive News Summary\nTrump is not immune, Biden’s fake border urgency, government interference over vaccines, and more.\nDouglas Andrews, Thomas Gallatin, & Jordan Candler\nCross-Examination\nTrump is not immune: The DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled this morning that Donald Trump is not immune from prosecution on charges that he tried to illegally overturn the 2020 election. The former president claimed that his alleged criminal actions on January 6, 2021, were protected by presidential immunity, but the court disagreed. “For the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant,” the panel of three judges wrote. “But any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as President no longer protects him against this prosecution.” The defeat was expected for Trump, though he plans to appeal to the entire DC Circuit and then the Supreme Court. Special Counsel Jack Smith had asked for an expedited ruling as he hopes to have Trump in the courtroom by March over charges of “insurrection,” one of the four indictments against Trump that constitute Democrat lawfare against him.\nJoe Biden’s fake border urgency: When your left-leaning friend tries to blame Republicans for our current border mess, don’t let him get away with it. When he says Joe Biden needs border legislation in order to act, be sure to remind him that Donald Trump didn’t need special legislation to protect our border. Indeed, as Andrew McCarthy notes, “Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (codified at Title 8, United States Code, §1182(f)) clearly states in pertinent part: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants. What part of that don’t Joe Biden and his open-borders apologists understand? In fact, columnist Tristan Justice has collected 65 examples of Biden willfully failing to enforce the law. Asked about the risk of torpedoing the current \"border” bill rather than granting Biden his phony legislative mandate, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott pointed out: “President Biden undid the successful measures that Trump put in place. If you can undo them, you can put them back in place. So President Biden does not need legislative action to secure our border. That is simply a lie to the American people. What President Biden needs is intestinal fortitude to go ahead and do his job right now.”\nBiden stands against standalone Israel aid bill: On Monday, the White House warned that Joe Biden would veto a standalone bill that provided aid solely to Israel. The warning was issued as the House will soon take up a vote on the $17.6 billion Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act. Biden is once again playing politics. He wants Congress to pass a Senate-proposed $118 billion “border” bill that he disingenuously claims he needs in order to secure the border. House Republicans have warned that the bill, which includes $60 billion in aid for Ukraine and $14 billion in aid for Israel, would be dead on arrival. Republicans blasted the border package deal for failing “in every policy area needed to secure our border and would actually incentivize more illegal immigration.” The White House then disingenuously claimed that it was Republicans who were guilty of playing politics: “The security of Israel should be sacred, not a political game.” If that was indeed the case, then why is Biden rejecting standalone legislation to grant aid to Israel? Evidently, Biden is only willing to stand with Israel if it comes with a whole litany of unrelated policy items that serve his own political agenda.\nGov’t interference over vaccines: Remember who is actually responsible for first politicizing the COVID vaccine? It wasn’t Donald Trump or “MAGA Republicans.” It was Joe Biden’s VP pick, Kamala Harris, who back in the fall of 2020 said that she “would not trust Donald Trump” regarding any vaccine. When pressed if she would get the vaccine, she added, “I will not take his word for it.” Fast-forward a few months later, and the Biden administration not only changed its tune on the vaccine but sought to force as many Americans as possible into getting it. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has obtained emails that show the degree of the pressure campaign waged by the White House on Big Tech companies including Amazon to suppress any opposition to the vaccine. Feeling the pressure back in March 2021, Amazon employees sought a meeting with the White House to clarify if the Biden administration wanted the company to remove “anti-vax books” from its retail catalog. “Is the [a]dmin asking us to remove books, or are they more concerned about search results/order (or both)?” was a question from one Amazon employee. Andrew Slavitt, then senior adviser to Biden on his COVID response, was communicating with Amazon about “the high levels of propaganda and misinformation and disinformation [on] Amazon.” In several emails from Slavitt to Amazon, he pressured the company over “concerning” material on its site related to vaccines. What becomes clear is a pattern of the White House pushing Amazon to effectively censor any material that didn’t further its policy objectives regarding the COVID vaccine.\nU.S. on “unsustainable” fiscal path: In a recent interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes,” Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell admitted what many conservatives have long been warning about — that the U.S. government is spending too much money. Powell pointed to the ballooning national debt and noted: “In the long run, the U.S. is on an unsustainable fiscal path. And that just means that the debt is growing faster than the economy.” He then warned: “Effectively we’re borrowing from future generations. It’s time for us to get back to putting a priority on fiscal sustainability and sooner is better than later.” Welcome to the party. The trouble is that there are still not enough lawmakers in Congress who are willing to truly put the brakes on the federal government’s spending.\nThe media bloodbath continues: From the “Hate to See It” Files comes this latest tale of woe from CNN, The Most Trusted Name in News™, which on Monday scuttled one of its morning shows in the wake of the network’s worst viewership numbers since before the political rise of Donald Trump. Alas, when it comes to the Leftmedia, Trump giveth and Trump taketh away. “We will no longer produce morning programming in New York and will be disbanding the team that currently produces ‘CNN This Morning’ in that city,” said CEO Mark Thompson to staffers on Monday. In an effort to assuage the network’s dozens of loyal viewers, Thompson added, “Our New York-based primetime and weekend programming will continue.” As our Nate Jackson noted recently: “CNN, NBC News, CBS News, NPR, TIME magazine, National Geographic, The Atlantic, The New Yorker, Business Insider, Vice, Vox Media, The Verge, and a long list of other media outlets have all cut jobs in recent months or plan to in the near future. Even our old pals at BuzzFeed shut down their entire news division last year. Pity. Far be it from us to revel in the misery of others, but this couldn’t happen to a nicer bunch.”\nMost assailants use handguns, not rifles, in “mass shootings”: A new study from the Crime Prevention Research Center that looks at the data from public mass shootings over the last 25 years has confirmed what many Second Amendment advocates have long known — the most common firearms used in so-called “mass shootings” are handguns, not rifles. The study also noted that most shootings took place in supposed “gun-free zones” and would not have been prevented by a law requiring universal background checks. The study’s author and founder of the center, John Lott Jr., pointed out that one of the biggest problems is with the term “mass shooting,” observing: “The big thing that irritates me is you have somebody like [President] Biden go and say, ‘We have Uvalde, and we’ve had 600 more attacks like this.’ That’s simply false because they’re just putting apples and oranges together.” The anti-Second Amendment lobby loves to target the AR-15, erroneously dubbing it an “assault rifle,” as if that type of firearm is the problem and responsible for most mass shootings. But the facts don’t come close to backing up the narrative. Irrespective of the firearm used in these crimes, every one of these attacks is committed by individuals with criminal intent to break the law.\nRenato Moicano lives, Toby Keith dies: In an age when illegal alien thugs brutally attack our cops and then fire off a double-bird to the rest of us when they’re released from jail, we remind ourselves that not everyone hates America. One case in point comes to us from Brazil, the home country of UCF fighter Renato Moicano, who emerged from a tough win over Drew Dober Saturday night with an impassioned message of love for the United States, as well as an admonition: “I love f***ing America, you know? … I’m not an American … but in two years, I will be an American. And after I am done with fighting, I will serve [as a] police officer. I want to be [on] a SWAT team, and I want to kill the bad guys. Make no mistake, there is right, and there is f***ing wrong! … That’s why I want more kids, I want people to go to their church, I want people to respect the f***ing law. Otherwise, this [greatest] country in the world is gonna be a third-world country!” Elsewhere among patriots, country music star Toby Keith, 62, whose “Should Have Been a Cowboy” was the most-played country music song of the 1990s, died peacefully yesterday after a two-year battle with stomach cancer — a battle he says he was better equipped to fight because of his Christian faith. Keith, a former rodeo hand and semi-pro football player who famously defended then-President George W. Bush against the vile comments of fellow country stars The Dixie Chicks, wrote or co-wrote 20 number one hits and sold more than 40 million albums worldwide. Keith’s greatest songwriting legacy, though, must be his stirring “Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue,” also known as “The Angry American,” which he wrote in response to 9/11 and the death of his dad earlier that year, and which inspired an entire generation of American warriors. Rest in peace, Big Dog Daddy.\nWoke NHL books pro-Hamas National Anthem singer: What is it with the woke NHL? In a sport defined by speed, grit, toughness, and determination, it confounds us to see such sorry leftism. Perhaps the league’s management hasn’t gotten the message. If it had, it certainly wouldn’t have invited 26-year-old singer Kiana Lede to perform the American national anthem at the 2024 NHL All-Star Game in Toronto. Instead, there was Lede, wearing pro-Hamas attire and causing the league some much-deserved heartburn. As The Daily Caller reports: “Lede wore a cardigan resembling a keffiyeh — something that has been gaining popularity with Palestinian supporters. The pro-Palestinian crowd uses the keffiyeh, black and white checkered, as a symbol of unity — the same symbol that Lede was wearing.” It’s not as if Lede’s behavior surprised the NHL brass — or at least it shouldn’t have. Her anti-Israel proclivities have been well known ever since the Jewish state began to defend itself against the murdering terrorists of Hamas. But in a world full of wonderful singers, this is the best the NHL could do?\nHeadlines\nBiden and Haley are on the ballot, but not Trump, as Nevada holds presidential primaries (Fox News)\nSeveral migrants accused in beating of New York City police officers arrested in Phoenix (Fox News)\nChinese migrants are the fastest-growing group crossing from Mexico into U.S. at southern border (CBS News)\nNew York governor relaxes requirements for illegals to get government jobs (Daily Wire)\nBiden blasted for claiming abortion for “three trimesters” is not “on demand” (Fox News)\nMedical journal retracts major studies critical of abortion pill ahead of Supreme Court clash (Daily Wire)\nIt’s not just Taylor Swift “nudes”: Millions of teen girls victimized as classmates turn them into deepfake porn (New York Post)\nSatire: New Senate anti-murder bill caps murders at 5,000 per day (Babylon Bee)\nPolicy: “No” to the border deal (National Review)\nFor more editors’ choice headlines, click here.\nCanada’s Psychiatric Death Panels on Pause\nIt’s only temporary, however, because the mentally ill are still the next vulnerable party the government wishes to exploit.\nEmmy Griffin\nCanada has an assisted suicide program called Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID). When the ban against assisted suicide was initially lifted in 2015, this program was for the terminally ill or elderly who wanted to bypass the potential suffering of the end stages of something like terminal cancer.\nThis is despicable in and of itself. It gets darker, however. MAID opened up its criteria for eligible applicants to the poor. The government was, in essence, convincing its people that they were a burden on society simply because they could not afford to live in Canada, which has as much to do with poor governance as it does with life circumstances that put people in cycles of poverty.\nCanada was already killing its sick and its poor — but then took it a step further. The government subsequently decided it was also going to kill the mentally ill, and children as young as 12 qualify. Officials justify this by saying the sufferer’s mental illness must be irreversible.\nSo it is with a sigh of some relief that Canada has announced a pause on the MAID program for the mentally ill. What exactly was the reason? Had government death panelists come to realize just how evil this program was not only as a concept but also for their sickening society?\nNo.\nThey simply don’t have enough doctors to meet demand.\nApparently, the demand for MAID’s “services” jumped by 30% between 2021 and 2022. Last year, more than 4% of Canada’s deaths occurred through this barbaric practice. The mental illness demand for suicide is so high that provinces were given more time to organize and hire doctors, specifically psychiatrists, to handle the workload.\nNot the Bee points out this bitter irony: “But there’s something funny about the Canadian socialized healthcare system being at such a gross level of incompetence that they can’t effectively execute their death panel program.”\nSadly, this is only a temporary pause.\nConservative Party MP Ed Fast asked: “Have we gone too far and too fast with Canada’s assisted suicide program? Will we evolve into a culture of death as the preferred option for those who suffer from mental illness or will we choose life?”\nCanada is already in the throes of that culture of death. The mentally ill are merely the next vulnerable party the government wishes to exploit.\nLife is a gift. We do not choose to be born, but we do get to choose how we use the gift of life. Squandering what time you have left by wallowing in the victimhood of poor health or poverty is believing the lie that circumstances determine your life’s value.\nTime to End U.S. Funding of UNRWA\nThe Biden administration’s failed foreign policy decisions continue to make the world worse.\nThomas Gallatin\nIt recently came to light that at least 12 employees with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees had participated in the murderous October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas (backed by Iran) on Israel. That revelation shone a bright light on an organization that has painted itself as a humanitarian relief organization but in reality is little other than a jihadi terror-sponsoring outfit.\nRoughly 10% of UNRWA’s total staff in Gaza are believed to be members of Hamas. That’s 1,200 out of 12,000 UNRWA staff.\nThis revelation has led to several UN member nations suspending their funding of the agency, including Australia, Austria, Canada, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nThe U.S. has also paused its funding, stopping a mere $300,000 of more than $1 billion in American taxpayer dollars doled out by the Biden administration since January 2021. Donald Trump rightly ended UNRWA funding in 2018 when he recognized that the organization was not a “humanitarian relief” agency but a jihadist front group.\nThe Biden administration should have immediately and permanently ended all funding to this terrorist organization. Instead, Team Biden simply hit pause, apparently waiting for the outrage to blow over, to then quietly restart funding as if nothing happened.\nThis, of course, has everything to do with Joe Biden seeking to appease the radical anti-Semitic faction of the Democrat Party. This is further demonstrated by the Biden administration’s reportedly looking at a policy change that would unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state.\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) blasted the notion of the White House endorsing a unilateral two-state solution as “the worst betrayal of our strongest ally in the Middle East, a reversal on decades-long U.S. policy, and a reward to Hamas terrorists who committed the most barbaric attacks against the Jewish community since the Holocaust.”\nOnce again, we see Biden’s foreign policy weaknesses and failings in sharp relief. At the same time, we see a region of the world where Trump’s progress in bringing peace and stability through American strength and leadership has been almost entirely reversed.\nThis is what happens when party politics trump genuine consideration for putting the nation first. Biden administration players have continuously vilified every accomplishment of the Trump administration because they fear that giving Trump credit for anything would prevent people from seeing him as a supposed existential threat to democracy.\nYet all it has done is expose Biden’s feckless leadership in the face of genuine evil. Republican congressional leaders and candidates need to hold the Democrats’ feet to the fire on UNRWA. As former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy argues, “Congressional Republicans should demand that the Biden administration designate UNRWA as a terrorist organization,” which “would make it politically untenable for the United States government to provide one more dime of American taxpayer funding to UNRWA, and to provide funding to any entity, including the U.N., that supports it.”\nIndeed, revelations like these cause one to question the value of the United Nations writ large. U.S. taxpayers pony up more than $12 billion annually to the UN. And for what?\nThe Super Bowl Will Again Feature Two ‘National Anthems’\nE Pluribus Unum is dead. For the Left, another touchdown.\nDennis Prager\nThis coming Sunday, at the most widely viewed sporting event in America, the Super Bowl, the National Football League will feature the singing of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the song first known as the “Negro national anthem” and now known as the “black national anthem.”\nIn order to ensure that those present at the game and the more than 100 million people watching on television cannot avoid hearing it, the “black national anthem” will, according to the schedule I have seen, be played after the actual national anthem of the United States. If that is the case, this will presumably be done in order to also ensure that everyone is still standing when it is sung. The NFL probably fears that some of those attending the game — specifically, those who possess two increasingly rare traits: love of America and courage — might not rise for the “black national anthem.” But if they were already standing for the national anthem, few will sit when the “black national anthem” is then sung. The NFL doesn’t want a repeat of what occurred at last year’s Super Bowl in Arizona, when, as ABC News reported, “Former Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake went viral in 2023 for remaining seated during a performance of the song at Super Bowl LVII.” Last year, the “black national anthem” was played prior to the national anthem.\nHow destructive a decision performing the “black national anthem” at sporting events is — whether before or after the national anthem — can be summarized this way: Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, is among the few Americans of whom it will one day be said that he seriously damaged America. In 2021, the Washington Times noted, “Under Roger Goodell, the NFL has gone far beyond the kneeling; it’s doubling down on ‘social justice.’ In addition to painting more slogans in the end zones and on players’ helmets, the League will be donating $250 million to Black Lives Matter and other activist groups to ‘combat systemic racism and support the battle against the ongoing and historical injustices faced by African-Americans.’”\n(Also in 2021, the NFL released a 30-second video titled “Football Is Gay.”)\nLast week, the “black national anthem” was sung before the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Detroit Lions playoff game.\nThe National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball are competing with the NFL to see which organization can inject more divisive left-wing politics into sports. For example, before the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, played in Salt Lake City, black singer Jully Black changed an opening word of the Canadian national anthem from “O Canada! Our home and native land!” to “O Canada! Our home on native land!” — emphasizing the word “on.”\nDuring the 2023 baseball season, the Los Angeles Dodgers honored — yes, honored, not merely featured — an LGBT activist group, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, composed of men dressed as nuns mocking Catholic nuns.\nMeanwhile, the NFL continues to paint “anti-racist” slogans in end zones and play the “black national anthem” before important games.\nNot to be outdone by the NFL, NBA or MLB, the U.S. Open men’s and women’s tennis singles finals did not even feature the U.S. national anthem. Instead, the “black national anthem” and “America the Beautiful” were sung. The latter is indeed a beautiful and patriotic song, but the fact is that one “national anthem” was played — and it wasn’t America’s. As former ESPN anchor Sage Steele wrote on X: “Ahhh… the irony of refusing to allow our national anthem … at the US Open. I remain hopeful that we can get back to truly appreciating the greatness of America, but man…this is sad.”\nTwo big lessons here.\nThe first is that the Left seeks to destroy America as we have known it. Playing two “national anthems” has no other goal than disuniting Americans. The message of singing the “black national anthem” is as clear as day: There is a black America and there is the rest of America. That many Americans, especially blacks, welcome this is nothing less than a national tragedy.\nThe second is the most important: The Left destroys everything it touches. High schools, elementary schools, universities, journalism, the nuclear family, young Americans’ mental health, male-female relations, religion, our borders, love of country, medicine, and medical schools — the list includes every noble institution and ideal in our country.\nAnd sports.\nIn 2001, following 9/11, the great black Chicago Cubs player Sammy Sosa hit a home run and ran around the bases waving a small American flag. Fifteen years later, Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the playing of the national anthem. The Left, led by Barack Obama, Joe Biden, the Democratic Party, the media, the schools and universities, had done their damage. So, now we play two “national anthems.”\nE Pluribus Unum is dead. For the Left, another touchdown.\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 CREATORS\nREADER COMMENTS\nEditor’s Note: Each week we receive hundreds of comments and correspondences — and we read every one of them.

Inflation is coming down. … A little bit of corporate greed going on too.” —Joe Biden\n“We’ve created a record 15 million new jobs.” —Joe Biden\n“We have created more than fourteen and a half million new jobs [and] increased wages for tens of millions of Americans.” —Kamala Harris\nNon Compos Mentis\n“I love how Trump is now saying Biden is for abortion on demand. That’s not true. That’s not what Roe v. Wade said. It said the three trimesters.” —Joe Biden\nDelusions of Grandeur\n“As we enter into the campaign season, the American people are beginning to focus on President Biden’s incredible track record of results.” —House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY)\n“The people who know my work are incredibly supportive.” —Kamala Harris\nFor the Record\n“I’ll never support a so-called ‘border security deal’ that increases illegal immigration, normalizes Biden’s Border Crisis, and allows thousands of illegal aliens to continue flooding into our country. The American People want border security — not fake deals that won’t secure the border.” —Congressman Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN)\n“President Joe Biden tells a lot of tall tales about the border crisis, but his claim that he needs the reckless bipartisan immigration bill being negotiated in the Senate to give him the authority to ‘shut down the border’ and he ‘would use it the day’ he signs the bill into law to end the crisis is one of his tallest tales yet.” —Hans von Spakovsky\n“Biden’s claim of powerlessness is a crock. … He could clamp down right now if he wanted. Indeed, he could demonstrate seriousness on the issue of border control by reversing the executive orders that promoted the migration in the first place.” —Matthew Continetti\nPolitical Futures\n“Biden isn’t worried about losing black and Hispanic voters concerned about illegal migration and border security. He’s worried about losing the college-educated liberal professionals who exercise undue influence in his administration and who have been radicalized into believing that unchecked migration is a human right. His dependence on these college liberals constrains his actions and weakens the country.” —Matthew Continetti\nAnd Last…\n“A country that turns [Daniel] Penny into a criminal and lets this thug [Jhoan Boada] walk free, beat up police officers and go back on the streets before the sun goes down is a country on the verge of disintegration.” —Gary Bauer\nTODAY’S MEME\nFor more of today’s memes, visit the Memesters Union.\nTODAY’S CARTOON\nFor more of today’s cartoons, visit the Cartoons archive.\nPlease join us in prayer for our nation — that righteous leaders would rise and prevail and we would be united as Americans.
