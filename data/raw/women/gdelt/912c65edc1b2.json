Every new day brings a new face, seemingly. But it’s the latter who feature in this story, with SportBusiness reporting that Giulia Mazzia is joining Chelsea FCW as our new commercial director.\nArsenal’s Head of Commercial Ventures joining Chelsea FCW — report\nNew challenge\nMazzia had been the Head of Commercial Ventures at Arsenal for the past year, after joining them from AC Milan, where she was the Global Head of Partnerships — and presumably worked closely with current Chelsea (and ex-Milan) Chief Revenue Officer, Casper Stylsvig. Prior to Milan, Mazzia also spent a few years at City Football Group as well as a year at Manchester United.\nJudging by that CV, she certainly seems well qualified to take on the challenge of leading (the now fully independent) commercial organization at Chelsea FC Women.",
