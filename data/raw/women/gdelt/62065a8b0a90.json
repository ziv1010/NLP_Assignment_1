  "body_text": "The Moroccan Football Federation are seeking for the postponement of the 2026 Africa Cup of Nations tournament, citing a large number of commitments, Africasoccer.com has reported.\nThe CAF’s elite women competition is scheduled to take place in the North African country between March 17 and April 3, 2026, with 16 countries set to battle it out for the covetous trophy.\nBut the tournament is at risk of being postponed, with the hosts’ nation expected to submit a formal request to the Confederation of African Football (CAF) on numerous pressing issues.\nThe Moroccan FA’s decision to seek for postponement of the tournament bounds down to a large number of commitments, particularly, the need to finish the Moroccan league on time (May 15, 2026) as the 2026 World Cup approaches.\nBesides, the Moroccan football governing body wants to focus on the Atlas Lions preparations for the global showpiece to be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\nFor the first time, 16 teams will feature at the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations tournament, with Egypt, Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Mali earning an invitation to partake in the tournament, having failed to secure automatic qualification.\nThe Super Falcons of Nigeria are the record holders of the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations, winning the title ten times. They won the previous edition and will be hoping to defend the title in the North African country.\nCredit: ghanasoccernet.com",
