These included writing a letter to MPs on the installation of solar panels, creating a poster that could be included in our matchday programmes and hosting cooking sessions to equip young people with the skills required to enter employment.\nIt was a fantastic day all round, and we’re hoping to bring the APLG to The Hub during the February half-term to learn more about the work of the community and see how the local food bank works.\nCommunity Shape Up programme\nOur Shape Up Pilot finished in December with some outstanding results.\nShape Up is our weight-management programme specifically designed for men. The 12-week behaviour-change programme provides education around nutrition in a non-judgemental, sustainable and engaging way.\nMore than 80 per cent of participants completed the course, while the majority of attendees reported that they had maintained improved levels of physical activity. An impressive 29 out of 38 lost five per cent of their bodyweight.\nOur next two Shape Up courses are already underway and have been running for three weeks, with the next available courses running in April.\nA huge thank you to Rhys Ratcliffe, our Health & Wellbeing Coordinator, who has been running these sessions. If you or anyone you know is interested in coming along, please get in touch with Rhys.\nWubben-Moy launches Time To Explore project\nIn January we kicked off Time To Explore, our new eight-week programme created and delivered by our defender Lotte Wubben-Moy and Helen Staniland, our Education Projects Coordinator.\nThis programme is designed to give girls a chance to explore how to express themselves through football, art, and writing in a non-traditional way.\nOur first ‘squad’ of 16 girls from Highbury Fields School are discovering a range of creative outlets with the assistance of guest speakers from Duppy Designs - a creative design agency, #Merky Books, Islington Ecology Centre, and Football For Future. They will also attend a trip to the Twist Museum of immersive illusions.\nThe conclusion of the programme will be a display of the girls’ work, which will be created using items selected from a local charity shop.\nStrength and Balance classes\nDue to high demand our Strength and Balance classes are now full and we’re now exploring additional funding to roll out additional sessions from our local healthcare professionals.\nThe classes are specifically for those over the age of 55 that would like to increase their independence, reduce the risk of falls and improve their strength and stability.\nWe have recently welcomed our oldest members to the group aged 92 and 93!\nLeah surprises our Football Plus girls\nAs part of an activation with our partner, Mastercard, Leah Williamson surprised participants at our Football Plus girls' after-school session for six to nine-year-olds. Leah delivered a short coaching session to 25 lucky participants, with 11 invited to be mascots at the WSL game against Chelsea. The remaining 14 participants were given two tickets to the game courtesy of Emirates and invited to a special player welcome as the teams arrived.\nThank you to Leah and Mastercard for a very special experience enjoyed by our participants and their parents!\nPulmonary rehab sessions\nWe’ve entered into a new and exciting relationship with Whittington Health to provide community-based pulmonary rehabilitation sessions for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other respiratory conditions due to long-term drug and alcohol abuse.\nThe sessions take place at The Hub with the exercises delivered by our community health coaches under the supervision of local qualified pulmonary rehab physios. This programme will run for a year with a view to extending the project further.\nArsenal x BCOMS masterclass\nArsenal in the Community hosted the Black Collective of Media in Sport (BCOMS) Masterclass Event at the Emirates Stadium. We’re proud to support BCOMS aims to diversify the sports media landscape.\nThe evening consisted of a Q&A panel with five of our colleagues who gave timely advice and encouragement to students on how to gain experience in sports media.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
