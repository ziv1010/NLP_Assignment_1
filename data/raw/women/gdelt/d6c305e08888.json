I’ve given corners before and looked at the crowd, watching them giving me grief, and I’d just smile at them. It winds them up even more.”\nDean, by his own admission, was never just your ordinary referee.\nAdvertisement\n“If some guy’s giving you proper grief, you just smile and give the thumbs-up. What happens then is that other people will start laughing at him. It makes people realise you are a normal person, even if they hate you for 90 minutes, and at least you have a sense of humour.”\nGO DEEPER\nJordan Henderson: I strongly believe that me playing in Saudi Arabia is a positive thing\nIt’s a bright and sunny lunchtime on the Wirral and, first things first, you would never think the man sitting here today has been accused of being a showman, an attention-seeker, or sometimes even worse during a quarter of a century as one of English football’s elite referees.\nHe turns up in a T-shirt and tracksuit bottoms. He is holding the keys for a Skoda rather than a more fancy motor and his backstory involves several years of combining the demands of a young referee with punishing shifts at a chicken factory in north Wales.\n“The chickens came in alive at one end and, by the time they got to us, they weren’t,” he recalls. “We had to take out all their insides. I’d go in at five in the morning, work until two, then go home for a quick change or drive straight to Hartlepool, Carlisle, Lincoln, anywhere, to ref a game. I’d get back at two in the morning and straight into the factory for five. It was hard trying to do both jobs at the same time.”\nThat level of dedication was essential throughout a refereeing career incorporating nearly 600 top-division matches and several years on FIFA’s international list.\nYet he is talking here as an ex-referee, adjusting to a different pace of life and about to embark on a new role with Sky Sports.\nHe also sounds glad to be trying something different after experimenting as a Video Assistant Referee (VAR) last season and finding it a largely joyless experience.\n“I gave it a go,” he says. “I just couldn’t get a feel for it. It was strange for me. I’d been a referee for 25 years and, all of a sudden, I was sitting behind a TV making a call if a referee made an error. I knew by September or October it wasn’t for me. It just wasn’t worth driving 250 miles to London every other week when I wasn’t enjoying it.”\nAdvertisement\nHis new gig starts this weekend when he will be in the Soccer Saturday studios to analyse whatever refereeing controversies are thrown up.\nDean has already had a crash course in mastering the television gadgetry at his fingertips, but he knows the real test will come when a referee drops a clanger. Will he call out people he knows as colleagues, comrades and, in some cases, close friends?\nGO DEEPER\nWhat is PGMOL? How refereeing really works in the Premier League\n“I still speak to the majority of the guys but, credibility-wise, you can’t defend the indefensible. If a referee or another match official makes a mistake, I will say it’s a mistake. There won’t be any, ‘I can see why he’s done that…’ because that way you just lose credibility.\n“If they make good decisions, I will praise them as well, but I won’t hide or sit on the fence just because they are my mates.”\nIt is going to be interesting. Dean left his role with the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) over the summer. He was a popular figure in refereeing circles, described by Howard Webb as the “chief prankster” of the group. Yet, football being football, Dean is acutely aware of the tribal nature of the sport and that his name features prominently in many people’s little black books of refereeing demonology.\nHe will also confess there have been times when he has enjoyed being the guy who seemed intent, almost single-handedly, on dismantling the idea that referees have to conform to a certain type.\nDean, you might recall, was the referee who hid the match ball up his shirt when Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero wanted to collect it as a souvenir for scoring a hat-trick. There was the pre-match line-up when Dean started sniffing his assistant’s armpits. Or the night when he celebrated a goal for Spurs, both arms in the air, because of a key decision in the build-up.\n“I’d played an advantage and they (Spurs) scored from it,” he says. “I was more than happy. It’s not a rare occurrence, trust me. You will get guys celebrating good decisions in the dressing room, giving someone a fist bump. It happens all the time.”\nWhat can be said with certainty is that football is not short of Mike Dean stories and it is largely because of his theatrical gestures, the no-look bookings, his strut and his eye-rolls that a Twitter page entitled Celebrity Refs exists.\nAdvertisement\nDean accepts he was “a bit more flamboyant than the other refs”. He says he always had the impression the majority of players liked him being that way. But he also came to realise a long time ago that referee-bashing can feel like a sport in itself sometimes.\nHe sums it up rather neatly. “When you’re growing up, you have pictures of footballers on your bedroom walls. Nobody has pictures of a referee on their wall, do they?”\nHis first match with the whistle came in 1985 in the Eastham & District junior league. He was 17 at the time and had agreed to referee because he wanted to lose weight.\nIt was a tricky introduction. “Heswall Under-11s against Alex Imps,” he recalls. “I got myself locked in the dressing room before kick-off. The kids had gone out, the mums and dads had followed them, someone locked the door and I was still inside.”\nAs a schoolboy, he was a goalkeeper in the same team as Ian Woan, the former Nottingham Forest winger and now Everton’s assistant manager. But Dean’s passion for football, growing up a supporter of Tranmere Rovers, was shared with a love of ballroom dancing.\n“We used to have a dance school near my house,” he says. “I started when I was nine and had seven years. It was different back then, 40-odd years ago, because when you got to 15 or 16, as a lad, it wasn’t the ‘in’ thing to do.”\nThe young Dean foxtrotted and tangoed in the ballroom of Blackpool Tower as well as touring other spots around the north west. It wasn’t always easy being at school in the 1970s and 1980s and having ballroom dancing as your hobby, but perhaps a bit of playground ribbing helped shape the strength of personality that became an essential part of Dean’s professional life.\nOver the years, he has lost count of all the criticism and sometimes uninformed comments from television pundits (“Garth Crooks is the worst”) and others in the media.\nAdvertisement\nHe can remember the 2009 derby between Cardiff City and Swansea City when someone in the crowd threw a coin that hit him in the face. “Just one of them things,” he says. “I don’t think it was aimed at me.”\nAt one stage, Arsenal’s supporters started an online petition demanding the PGMOL remove him from the team’s matches. Dean had sent off Gabriel Paulista because of an incident with Chelsea’s Diego Costa that led to the Football Association overturning the red card. The petition raised 106,000 signatures.\n“It was funny, comical,” says Dean, bristling slightly. Would they start a petition, he asks, to ban one of their forwards the next time he misses a good chance? Did they really think the PGMOL would be influenced? “I thought it was hilarious.”\nAt other times, it is not always so easy to laugh it off.\nIn February 2021, Dean sent off West Ham’s Tomas Soucek for an alleged elbow on Fulham striker Aleksander Mitrovic. It was the wrong decision and, on the long journey home, Dean took a telephone call from one of his daughters saying the family had been targeted with death threats. Her social media accounts had been found and, among a series of abusive and sinister posts, there were threats to petrol-bomb their house.\n“It was hard,” says Dean. “My daughter is football-mad, a season-ticket holder at Tranmere. She was 24 at the time but she couldn’t get her head around the fact I’d made a decision on the pitch and, as a result, I was getting all these threats.\n“I spoke to the Premier League that night. They said to leave it until the morning and they would deal with it then. But I’d heard nothing by 10am and, rightly or wrongly, I went to the police station to report it.\n“I went to Spain for a week to get away from everything and I told the Premier League I didn’t want to referee the following weekend. They were fine with that and a few weeks later I had another game at West Ham. As soon as I saw Soucek, I went over to him and apologised.\n“The police found the lads who had been sending the messages. They lived in Ireland, two young lads, and the police had got hold of them. ‘Do you want to take it any further?’ they asked. I said no because they were just kids. If it had been someone older, it might have been different.”\nIt is the kind of story that makes you wonder whether refereeing is worth all the hassle.\nAdvertisement\nBut Dean also makes the point that this was the exception and the only time in a long career when he has encountered something of that nature.\nMost of the people who stop him in the street just want to chat or ask for a photograph. He and his family are well known on the Wirral, where his mother, Janet, was awarded an MBE because of her 35 years as a lollipop lady outside the same primary school.\nIt is not true, he says, that a well-known referee has to live by certain guidelines, knowing which places can be visited, where to avoid and the potential risks of encountering the wrong people.\n“It just doesn’t happen,” he says. “People think it happens, but it doesn’t. You might hear someone say, ‘I’ve seen that ref, I gave him a load of grief’, but it’s rubbish. And if someone did shout something, I just wouldn’t make eye contact.\n“You know when you’re walking down the road and you see someone and you think, ‘Oh, here we go, this could be trouble’. Someone might say something, but it’s very, very rare.”\nIf you remember the complaints from Arsenal fans, perhaps it should not come as a surprise how Dean responds when he is asked to identify the manager who used to give him the hardest time.\n“I used to find it hard with Arsene Wenger,” he says. “Every time I managed Arsenal, they never seemed to win. It wasn’t my fault. But I’ve spoken to people from Arsenal since I finished refereeing and they told me that whenever they realised I was the referee, with my name at the bottom of the teamsheet, straight away it was, ‘Oh God, him’.\n“I have friends who support Arsenal. They’d say, ‘We’re going to get beaten this week because you’re reffing’. I’d say, ‘It’s not my fault, you know’. With Arsene, because they had lost, there was always a complaint about me. But I’ve seen him since and he was fine.”\nAsk Dean to select his favourite game and he will nominate Manchester City’s 3-2 win against QPR in 2012 when Aguero won the league title with the last kick of the season.\nIn common with many referees, Dean remembers Craig Bellamy as the most challenging (gobby) player.\nAdvertisement\nHe will argue, however, that Sir Alex Ferguson’s reputation as another terroriser of referees was overblown. “Yes, he would complain sometimes, but I got on OK with him. Jose Mourinho was another one. Win, lose or draw, whoever he was managing, he would always come in to say well done.”\nThe interview is drawing to a close and it is becoming easier to understand why the people who know ‘Deano’ say there is more to him than meets the eye.\nFor someone who is often accused of being a showman, it is also interesting to hear him say he has absolutely no interest in joining the long line of referees — Howard Webb, Mark Clattenburg, Graham Poll, Mark Halsey, Jeff Winter and on and on — who have written autobiographies. Is the truth that Dean is not such a showy person, after all?\nMore than anything, he leaves the impression of being entirely comfortable in his own skin. At 55, he is enjoying being a grandfather. He has a house in Spain, south of Murcia, that he visits every month. A keen golfer, he plays off a handicap of five and caddies for Lydia Hall, Whitney Hillier and others on the women’s professional circuit.\nDean was taken off the 2006 FA Cup final between Liverpool and West Ham on the basis he lived within 10 miles or so of Anfield. Was he a secret Kopite? Did he speak with a Scouse accent?\n“The popular myth is I have two sons who are Liverpool season ticket holders,” he says, and now he is laughing. “I haven’t got any sons. But people put it out anyway: ‘He was sitting by his two boys at the game’. Bloody hell, that’s news to me.”\nIn reality, his affinity is with Tranmere, as a home-and-away supporter of many years. And yes, there are times when he lets the emotions get to him and finds himself angrily questioning the eyesight of the match officials. “If the ref makes a bad decision,” he says unapologetically, “I will vent my fury.”\nHAPPY NEW YEAR! 🥳🗓\nHere's Mike Dean getting the party started…😉 pic.twitter.com/3WMk7KrOA4\n— Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) January 1, 2020\nEqually, there are numerous stories about him helping out younger members of the profession. He will always be a referee at heart, you suspect, and he has been impressed by Webb’s impact as the PGMOL’s technical director. Webb, he says, wants to cut out the touchline behaviour that saw Mikel Arteta, Arsenal’s manager, waving an imaginary yellow card during the Community Shield against Manchester City last weekend.\nAdvertisement\n“He (Webb) won’t take any messing,” says Dean. “With Howard’s persona, his status and credibility in the game, he has a presence when he speaks to managers. You will see a big difference this season in regards to management behaviour and player behaviour.”\nIf not, it will be for Dean to point it out on Soccer Saturday. And, in one sense, maybe the first Premier League whistleblower to show 100 red cards is getting out of refereeing at the right time.\nDean likes the way the sport is evolving. He can envisage a time when England’s top division has automated offsides and he supports Webb’s plans to make the referees’ on-pitch conversations with their assistants and VARs increasingly accessible to the media and fans. But he also knows, as a self-confessed chatterbox, that there are risks attached.\n“You can be reffing a game when someone hits the ball from 25 yards and the shot hits the corner flag. You might joke (to your assistants), ‘Crikey, what’s going on here? How’s he worth such and such?’.\n“It’s joking, banter. But if that gets released, people would say you’re not focused on the game. So they (the PGMOL) want the conversations to be quieter, a lot more focused and speak when you need to speak.”\nDean blows out his cheeks, taking it all in for a few moments. “I used to go through the whole game and I’d never shut up.”\n(Top photo: Danny Taylor/The Athletic)",
