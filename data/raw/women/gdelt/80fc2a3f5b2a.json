It is known for the Gateway Arch, serving up some of America's best barbecue, and as the childhood home of Mark Twain. However, there is so much more than meets the eye when it comes to Missouri. Case in point: its many underrated college towns.\nCollege towns can be the heartbeat of a state. They provide energy through the campus youth, innovation and opportunities for the future, and diversity and creative thinking via student bodies that converge from all over the world. While these features may get more attention at the largest schools, like the University of Missouri, it's often the smaller ones in towns that don't boast a large metro that see the most influential gains and benefits to the community.\nYes, St. Louis and Kansas City offer all the excitement and options that come with a metropolitan area. But we wanted to find the charming, smaller towns throughout Missouri that fly below the radar. At the same time, these spots still pulsate with the vibrant atmosphere that comes from having a college (or two) in their midst.\n1. Fulton\nWestminster College-Missouri is a private liberal arts College in Fulton, a small town southeast of Columbia, the capital of the state. Fulton provides that quintessential small college town experience. It actually has two universities, with William Woods University being the other. While a small Division III school, Westminster offers plenty for its students and the surrounding area. It has dozens of student organizations, fraternities and sororities, and athletics year around for the locals to follow and support.\nFulton boasts history and knowledge that many towns its size can't match. Sir Winston Churchill gave the famous \"Iron Curtain Speech\" on the Fulton Westminster campus on March 5, 1946. Because of this, you'll find the prime minister's fingerprints around the town via America's National Churchill Museum. That's far from the only museum, though. Have a passion for the automobile? Stop over at the Auto World Museum on the northern edge of town, where you can get up close and appreciate over 100 years of auto history. Appreciating knowledge and history isn't all that Fulton offers. Stroll through Fulton's scenic downtown Brick District for great places to shop and eat.\n2. Nevada\nLocated just east of the Kansas border sits Nevada, Missouri. This town of 8,600 residents is where you'll find Cottey College, a private women's college founded in 1884. Cottey College was founded by one of the state's own, Virginia Alice Cottey, who grew up in Missouri's Knox County. She believed that women had the right to the same quality of education as men. Because of this vision, the college welcomes several hundred young women to Nevada each year to study and select from one of 24 Bachelor's degrees.\nIt's safe to say the town of Nevada and Cottey College fit each other nicely. With both being quiet, small locations, it helps create a peaceful community that fosters higher learning and activity. Take part in local farmers markets May through October to find fresh food or arts and crafts. Head over to the Bushwacker Museum on Walnut Street to learn the unique history of the renovated building as well as the area and the importance of the Osage Tribe. \"Love this place !!!\" a Google Maps reviewer gushed about the museum. \"So many local and regional exhibits and many special events. We highly recommend that you take the time to visit.\"\n3. Jefferson City\nIn the heart of the state, on the banks of the Missouri River, you'll find Jefferson City, home to Lincoln University.

Lincoln University is known as a proud historically black college or university (HBCU) with increasing enrollment, showing that it's a growing part of the town.\nTake in some of the architectural prowess of the area by visiting the Missouri State Capitol or Governor's Mansion. You can also learn about some of the unique history with a tour of the Missouri State Penitentiary Museum by exploring exhibits, living conditions in that time, and more.

Kirksville\nKirksville, a town in the northern part of Missouri, actually has three colleges that call it home, which is impressive for a place with only around 17,000 residents. Kirksville was founded in 1842, while Truman State University came along 25 years. Truman State welcomes students from all over the globe with the university's high esteem being echoed by U.S. News & World Report, which highlighted, \"Truman State University is ranked No. #5 in Regional Universities Midwest. It's also ranked No. #1 in Top Public Schools.\" Aside from the glowing endorsements for Truman State, another great thing about the area might have something to do with the quality of life in Kirksville.\nThousand Hills State Park and Forest Lake are just on the outskirts of the town's western limits, allowing residents to take advantage of camping, hiking, boating, and more across the scenic park. The trails around the park even offer up a history lesson when you come across the Native American Petroglyph Shelter. After an exhausting day filled with summertime activities on the water, kick back and relax at Lakeside Grill with a deserving cold beverage and great meal while overlooking the lake.

We wanted to stay away from the state's largest cities, such as St. Louis and Kansas City. We also chose to exclude some of biggest universities, like University of Missouri, to shine a light on lesser-known campuses. To do this, we relied on sources that included U.S. News World & Report, Google Maps reviews for local sites, and official town websites.",
