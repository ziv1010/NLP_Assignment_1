  "body_text": "It's do or die time for the Met police, says NICK FERRARI\nThere is a growing call for action over police failures as six forces are currently in \"special measures.\"\nThe evidence can, and must, no longer be ignored. The growing clamour for action over police failures (call them “siren” calls if you like) are ringing across the country. No fewer than six forces are currently in “special measures”, meaning they are performing so pitifully they’re effectively on a final warning.\nAdditionally, half of all English forces fail to meet standards in certain investigations. Confidence in our police is shattered and, even more troublingly, trust has all but disintegrated.\nNowhere is the problem more severe than in London, where the Metropolitan Police was last week on the receiving end of a report so damaging they might as well have been hammered by truncheons.\nCommissioned in the wake of the appalling abduction, rape, and murder of Sarah Everard by a then serving Met officer, the findings were as ugly one could imagine.\nThe report laid out the harsh truth.\nThe nation’s largest police force (and its worth noting it takes the lead in key areas such as counter terrorism, royal and diplomatic protection) is “broken” and “rotten” and “institutionally homophobic, institutionally misogynistic and institutionally racist”.\nAnd if one of those damning verdicts rings a bell, don’t be surprised.\nBack in 1999, following the bungled investigation into the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence, the label “institutionally racist” was applied to the Met, with massive ramifications.\nThe then Commissioner was to depart within 12 months in a brave move as he absorbed the condemnation, but tried gallantly to allow the men and women who served under him the chance to move on.\nBut that won’t happen this time, not least as the current Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has only been in post for six months.\nAlthough let’s remember that the shock and horror he expressed when the report was published last week must be set against the awkward reality that he was a senior officer there for five years (Assistant Commissioner) and the two units singled out for heavy criticism, MO19, the Met’s specialist firearms command and the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection would have been under his command.\nBut now is not the time to look back, rather this must be a catalyst for change.\nHere’s what every senior officer up to and including the rank of chief constable across the country needs to remember:\nThe police are not here to play politics.\nWe look to them to protect us from the bad guys and solve crime. Once they remember these key messages, they can start painting their cars in Pride colours, drive dodgems at the fair, and the blokes can wear high heels as much as they desire.\n• Senior officers have to live up to their rank. If they get a report about a possible rogue cop, action must be immediate. And at the first positive indication of trouble, that officer is to be suspended and their warrant card withdrawn.\nPutting them on “back room duties” while allowing them to keep their badge is unacceptable.\n• The days of the “boys club” watching each others’ backs must be over.\n• The embarrassing police non-speak such as “embracing stakeholders and their concerns” – whatever the hell that means – will be banned. “We’re here to protect you and nick the villains”, will be the new mantra.\n• Any senior officer heard uttering the line “lessons will be learned” will be fired.\n• Rambling dialogue about “facing up to the challenge” and having a “ determination to put things right” is also censored. Action speaks louder than words, so let’s see some.\nWhile there was certainly no shortage of contenders, one of the most concerning lines from the report prepared by Baroness Casey was that she was not able to feel confident the force was rid of sex pest officers such as the prominent two recently jailed.\nWhen asked on my radio breakfast show, Sir Mark conceded he had to share that view, but when pressed he vowed “definite numbers” concerning the scale of the problem will be released “by the end of the month”. That gives him less than a week.\nIt’s no exaggeration to suggest these five days could be the most crucial in the near 200-year history of the Met.\nSuspend and charge rogue officers immediately, give hard numbers rather than ambiguous goals, and detail the intelligence system operating within Scotland Yard to sift out the bad cops. Then, they could just be saved – in the “nick” of time.\nVladimir Putin and Xi Jinping 'make nice'\nIt's a picture that truly chills the blood. Two of the most autocratic leaders on the planet getting as close to a smile as each can manage as they shake hands after a “make nice” summit in Moscow.\nAppropriately Russia’s President Vladimir Putin rolled out the “red” carpet for a full State welcome for China’s President Xi, and it appeared that amid the military might and ceremony, a friendship between the two men flourished.\nAnd while it might not quite be on the same level as Hitler cosying up to Mussolini, the possibility of global conflict cannot be ignored, not least as the two men talked openly about the sort of new world order that hasn’t been witnessed for over a century.\nAs Xi left Moscow, he told Putin: “Now there are changes that haven’t happened in 100 years. When we are together, we drive these changes.”\nAny hope Xi might seek to use his influence on Putin to seek an end to the war in Ukraine proved fruitless.\nThe response from the West is simple: continue to ramp up spending on defence, supply Ukraine with everything they want – and possibly more – and show no sign of backing down or disunity, at the same time exploiting any scintilla of Russian weakness in the war. Or, as former US President Theodore Roosevelt once aptly put it: “Speak softly and carry a big stick.”\nAnything else is palpable weakness the world will come to regret.\nThe English Rugby Football Union are lackluster bunch of halfwits\nForgive me if you will for a rant that’s been building for some time – and now rugby’s Six Nations Championship has (deservedly) concluded with a win for the all-conquering Irish, is oven-ready for delivery.\nThe English Rugby Football Union might be the wealthiest on the planet, but they are the most incompetent, unprofessional, lackluster bunch of halfwits ever to have come near the game.\nWatching a game at the supposed “Fortress” Twickenham is as enjoyable as a bad case of piles, which is perhaps appropriate as you spend much of the time watching the backsides of fans filing along in front of you to get endless pints of beer, presumably to numb the pain of the appalling rugby and the even worse seats and stadium.\nSome stewards behave as if they were being recruited for the vile Wagner Group of Russian mercenaries, and they treat the car park as if it was their own back garden.\nThe players might well be doing their best, but the appalling tone-deaf oafs who run the RFU could genuinely not make any aspect any worse.\nColonising language\nOXFAM has published a 92-page guide which describes English as the “colonising language” and advises staff to avoid using words such as “mother,” “youth” or even “headquarters”. What ghastly, self-serving, risible twaddle.\nIf they have such a problem with “English,” can I suggest they no longer accept any donations in “English” currency? And despite the fine work they do, remember there are many, many, many other charities and charity shops available.\nJohn Lewis seeking investment\nIt took some doing, but the bosses at John Lewis have succeeded in virtually driving it into the ground.\nFor only the second year in its existence, “partners” will be denied their annual bonus as the company seeks fresh outside investment.\nIf you need proof of the saying “Go Woke, Go Broke”, just check out the store that was once “never knowingly undersold”.\nThe Night Watchman Shiraz Malbec\nNoting what happened with the clocks this morning – don’t tell me you forgot! – the name of this wine couldn’t bemore appropriate. The Night Watchman Shiraz Malbec 2021 is £8.50 at the Co-op.",
