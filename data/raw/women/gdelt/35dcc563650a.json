  "body_text": "Women observed drinking in pub\nThe South Dunedin Licensing Committee received a report from the police on the question of women drinking in hotels. The report was that there was very little increase in drinking by women in the hotels in the Dunedin South licensing district. With regard to one hotel in particular, however, there was an unsatisfactory feature. In this hotel there was a sitting room, some distance from the bar — near the back of the hotel. This room was in a very quiet spot, and anyone going to it could not be seen by the men in the bar. The room was patronised by young men and young women. The committee considered that no facilities of this nature for drinking should be provided for womenfolk. He hoped the licensee would see to it that this matter — which the committee very properly objected to — would not be subject of any further complaint. Licensees would also be well advised to discourage women resorting to hotels merely for drinking.\nHealth of immigrants discussed\nQuestions relating to immigration and its effects received further consideration at the annual conference of the National Council of Women yesterday. Dr Siedeberg said that at present New Zealand had a fairly pure population, the criminal element being small and the general health excellent. There were certain physical defects, such as mental conditions, which were so distinctly hereditary that special precautions should be taken against admitting people suffering from them. These defects were particularly difficult to detect by a health officer when he dealt with 200 or 300 immigrants in an hour or so. She thought there should be some means of getting more fully at the earlier history of the physical health of the immigrants. She considered that the New Zealand Government should make out a form for use by the officials at Home so as to get more complete information as regards the immigrants’ previous health, their record in regard to criminal offences, their heredity, the age at which their parents died and the cause of death, their nationality and various other points. She would like to protest very strongly against the laxity with which the law was at present carried out. — ODT, 4.9.1924\nCompiled by Peter Dowden",
