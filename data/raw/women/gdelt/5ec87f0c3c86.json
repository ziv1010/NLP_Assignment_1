The trio are two points adrift of leaders Brisbane, who thumped the Dragons 44-14 earlier on Saturday in Townville.\nThe Roosters play fifth-placed Parramatta (10 points) on Sunday at 3pm. A loss for the Roosters, who are playing for the minor premiership, would give the Knights a home semi-final.\nThe Knights took an 18-0 lead into half-time after another dominant display built on defensive grit and attacking efficiency.\nFor the second week in a row, second-rower Yasmin Clydsdale broke the game open early when the Scone school teacher hit a hole through some flimsy Cowboys defence and powered across the try line in the fifth minute after back-to-back sets for the Knights.\nProp Tayla Predebon, who came into the starting side in place of injured Rima Butler (knee), then showed her sheer strength and determination to drag four Cowboys players across the line and score in the 11th minute.\nThe second try came after a penalty for a crusher tackle on Jesse Southwell, that left Bree Chester on report and had the Knights within 10 metres of the try line.\nTenika Willison continued a break-out rookie campaign in NRLW with a try in the 17th minute after Knights fullback Tamika Upton cut straight through North Queensland's line and found the Kiwi sevens star on the left edge with a cut-out pass.\nKnights halfback Jesse Southwell was successful with all three conversion kicks in the first half.\nIt was more of the same in the second half.\nUpton was again involved when Abigail Roache, who had dropped the ball across the try line in the first half, was played perfectly into a gap by her fullback to score in the 40th minute.\nChester struck back for the hosts with an individual effort in the 43rd minute and Kirra Dibb converted to have the scoreline 26-6.\nBut it was one-way traffic again from there.\nWillison crossed for her second try in the 47th minute after Clydsdale, who ran a game-high 233 metres, did well to offload on the try line.\nPowerful winger Sheridan Gallagher then produced back-to-back tries in the 58th and 61st minutes.\nTeenage utility Evie Jones almost added another with less than two minutes remaining but dropped the ball over the line.\nSouthwell kicked two conversions in the second half to finish the game with 10 points.\nKnights pathways product Evah McEwen, 18, was the third teenager to be given her NRLW debut by coach Ben Jeffries this year.\nThe NSW under-19 second-rower produced a solid 48-minute performance off the bench.\nIt was a successful day for the Knights with their NSW Rugby League Women's Premiership side beating minor premiers Wentworthville 20-18 in a semi-final showdown at Leichhardt Oval to secure a grand final appearance next weekend.\nSuper Rugby convert Isabella Waterman scored a hat-trick of tries and Jules Kirkpatrick also got on the scoresheet for the Knights.\nMulti-sport talent Jess Gentle, who helped guide Charlestown Azzurri to the NPLW Northern NSW Football championship last Sunday night, kicked two conversions.",
