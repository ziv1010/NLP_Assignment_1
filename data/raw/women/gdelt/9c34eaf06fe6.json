It was another painful experience.\n“We believed in ourselves and in the journey. Despite the disappointment, I’m grateful for the experience and the growth that comes with playing the Champions League at this level.\n“I am confident that here at Lyon, we will continue to fight with everything we have until the dream is achieved.”\nTabitha has repeatedly been quoted by international media outlets such as BBC, SkySport and France 24 that winning the Uefa Women’s Champions League is her ultimate goal.\nNational Women’s Football Association chairperson Adellaide Migogo described it as a disappointment for Tabitha,\nShe said: “After the first leg victory, we had hope that we would see her playing in the final for the first time. So, it is a huge setback and I understand how she feels.\n“But it’s not the end of the world, ultimately she will realise her dream.”\nThis season, Tabitha has been the fastest player in the women’s Champions League, clocking a top speed of 31.3 kilometrem per hour, just slightly ahead of her team-mate Ellie Carpenter.\nDespite scoring only nine times herself, that speed has stretched opposition back-line and given Lyon other players the space to score over 100 goals this season.\nLast year, Lyon lost in the final to Barcelona and had they won on Sunday. It would have given them a chance for revenge against the team they have faced in three Champions League finals, coming out on top in two of them before losing last year’s title.\nBBC reported: “The home side were poor. Victims of their own self destruction, they gave the ball away cheaply and made costly errors for the goals.”\nIt is the first time Lyon have conceded four goals at home since October 2022, when Arsenal inflicted a 5-1 demolition in the Champions League group stage.",
