  "body_text": "CARMEL – In 2015, Raven Gabrielson was a sophomore at Carmel High School when she said she was sexually assaulted by a senior, male student. She was 15 at the time and the male student was 18.\nThe news quickly spread among students and resulted in her ex-boyfriend at the time physically confronting Gabrielson and the male student. School administrators witnessed the altercation and called the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office.\nGabrielson thought what would follow would be an investigation into the male student’s behavior. Instead, she said she was interrogated by a deputy and the school’s administrators, handed a paper citing her for statutory rape involving her ex-boyfriend, who was also a minor, and sent home.\n“They told me (the male student) was 18,” Gabrielson said. “But the way they told me about it, it was like I was getting in trouble for it. It was like I should have known he was 18 and I had chosen to do this, but they didn’t really know what happened.”\nGabrielson said the male student invited her to his house, where they smoked marijuana. Gabrielson said she “got so high (she) couldn’t move and could barely keep (her) eyes open” and the male student carried her up to his bedroom and had sex with her.\n“Everyone thought that I had just wanted to sleep with him, that I had willingly slept with this guy, but nobody seemed to care that he was three years older than me or how messed up I was when he took advantage of me.”\nAfter the male student was busted for drug use, Gabrielson said she was blamed and accused by students and a teacher of cooperating with the investigation in order to avoid being punished for “sleeping with older boys.”\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights opened an investigation and a resolution agreement was reached with the district, which promised to do better.\nAs part of the district’s resolution agreement – signed Nov. 12, 2018 – the district paid Gabrielson’s father $5,000 for counseling and academic support, promised to ensure that administrators investigating sex discrimination complaints receive adequate training and pledged to revise its policies and procedures related to sexual harassment.\nGabrielson graduated that year and moved to Texas, while the high school’s principal, Rick Lopez, left the high school the following year. For those involved, it seemed like the problem was in the past.\nBut Gabrielson wasn’t alone in her experience of sexual assault and harassment at Carmel High. And more than five years after the district pledged to improve its policies, the problem of sexual harassment seemingly remains.\nEight students and two faculty members spoke to the Herald about their own experiences with sexual harassment or assault in the past 10 years at the high school. A Herald investigation revealed more than 20 allegations of sexual harassment or assault – including at least five police investigations during that same time period.\nCarmel High was ranked the 46th best in the state by U.S. News and World Report and has a student population of around 860 students. The district’s projected budgeting for the 2022-2023 school year was over $73.8 million, making it one of the highest-funded public school districts in the state. Yet behind the red and white halls of the school next to the intersection of Highway 1 and Ocean Boulevard lies a history of over a decade of sexual assault allegations, a hot potato game of responsibility and a prevailing culture haunted by sexual assault and harassment.\nIn December, Carmel High Principal Jonathan Lyons was put on leave and – in February – eventually reassigned. His response to a potential sexual harassment incident at the school was cited as one of the reasons the school board made the move.\nResponding to requests for clarifications and comments on a previous specific incident reported to the Herald, the Carmel Unified School District said it had embarked on its own investigation into past sexual harassment cases.\n“We are currently conducting a comprehensive and detailed investigation related to issues of sexual harassment within the school district,” a spokesperson for the district emailed. “We will be adding this allegation to the investigation and have no further comment.”\nThe allegation\nThe allegation the email referred to happened in 2018 – the same year Gabrielson’s father signed the Office of Civil Rights settlement – when another student said she was asked to sign a legal agreement with the high school.\nKylie Lawrence said during her freshman and sophomore years at the high school, she was routinely sexually harassed in her math class by a group of older male students.\n“There were a bunch of older boys that would catcall and whistle and they would physically grab my body parts,” Lawrence explained. “I know the teacher saw and did nothing. … It happened right in front of her. It was happening in her classroom every day, … it was just pretty obvious that I was being harassed and no one did anything.”\nLawrence said in her senior year she was brought into the administration’s office where Principal Lopez and the high school’s assistant principals Debbie Puente and Craig Tuana told her they had circumstantial evidence she had been using marijuana and she was going to be suspended.\nLawrence said that the administrators handed her a Carmel Sandpiper school newspaper article where Lawrence had complained of the sexual harassment she experienced and an agreement that Lawrence would not pursue legal action over the harassment.\n“They (said) ‘We saw this article. … Can you sign this form saying that you’re not going to sue us?’” Lawrence said. “It was one piece of paper that said I’m not going to go to court about the sexual harassment experiences that I faced at Carmel High. And I signed.”\nLawrence said the administration alluded that if she refused to sign the agreement, they would “have to get the police involved with (her) suspension.”\nThe Herald also emailed Puente and Tuana directly seeking clarification or comment but received no response. Lopez did not respond to the Herald’s request for comment.\nKurt Lawrence, Kylie’s father, recalled, “Kylie called me up and said, ‘They’re trying to make me sign this thing.’ … They had basically said, ‘We want you to sign this thing saying that you won’t press charges. That we are aware of the situation and that she will not (take) legal recourse or something like that.’\n“And so I rushed right to the school and met Kylie coming out of the office.”\nKurt Lawrence confirmed that neither he nor Kylie received a copy of the agreement she signed.\n“It’s been happening there for years,” Kylie Lawrence said. “It happened to a lot of students. I just can’t believe that they got away with it. I can’t believe that they actually made me – I can’t believe I signed that agreement.”\nA change of leadership\nAfter Lopez left the school in June 2019, Lyons stepped in to fill the role of principal.\nLyons, who has worked as a high school educator for over 23 years, previously served as principal at El Rancho High School in Los Angeles County and as an assistant principal at four other high schools.\nLyons has said on several occasions – including in a statement by his lawyer, Barry Bennett – that he was aware of the issues around sexual harassment and assault at the school before he took the job.\n“(Lyons) was aware, at the time he assumed the principalship, that the school and the District had a reputation for turning a blind eye to some allegations of the bullying and sexual harassment of students by their classmates and has devoted himself to dealing with such instances personally when they have been brought to his attention,” the February statement from Bennett said.\n“I think (the culture) is true of every school I’ve ever worked at,” Lyons told the Herald in a February interview. “I have had sexual harassment cases everywhere I’ve gone. And with the internet, with social media, it’s only gotten more pervasive. And I think that’s where – I guess if I have a frustration in this entire conversation – it seems like we’ve zeroed in on the discipline side of it, when really I feel like our role is to talk about the education side of it. How do we change culture? How do we change viewpoints?”\nIn 2019 – the year Lyons became principal – a female student reported she was raped by a male student at a party after a school powder puff football game.\n“We tried to do some things on the culture and climate side,” Lyons explained, recalling the incident, “(like) moving the powder puff game. Because the powder puff parties were – you just heard these horror stories. … That was why the year after (that incident) I was ready to cancel the event.”\nLyons confirmed he was responsible for handling the case alongside Assistant Principal Tuana. He said that although he recommended the male student be expelled, the superintendent at the time – Barbara Dill-Varga – chose not to.\nDill-Varga, who was recently appointed Superintendent of Schools at the Aromas-San Juan Unified School District, did not respond to the Herald’s request for comment.\nThe female student took out a restraining order against the male student, who later transferred to Carmel Valley High, the district’s alternative high school.\n“Usually what will happen in a suspended expulsion, … we’re saying that you committed this and in lieu of removing you, we will transfer you to another school. So in this case, it would be Carmel Valley High School,” Lyons explained.\nOf the four male students named by those who talked to the Herald as being charged with crimes, two were transferred to Carmel Valley High, one had already graduated.\nNot just sexual assault\nCarmel and school districts around the country are also dealing with a new era of sexual harassment where harassment extends beyond the classroom. Social media platforms, group chats and disappearing messages present a new challenge for administrators to discipline perpetrators and protect students.\n“The new form of harassment is online,” Lyons said. “I’m sure every year there are stories of things that we miss. It’s going to happen. And I don’t want to minimize it, but we’re not going to catch everything. We don’t know everything. I don’t spend all day trolling the internet – Instagram, Snapchat, Tiktok – looking for these things.”\nBut the Herald’s investigation found that several of the high school’s past and current administrators were well aware of multiple incidents of online sexual harassment.\nIn 2018, a Snapchat group chat titled “Respecting Women” frequently traded sexually explicit photos and videos of female students, as well as lists ranking female students based on their physical appearance and likelihood of engaging in sexual intercourse. Around 10-20 male students were in this group chat, including several students on various sports teams according to accounts given to the Herald by several students, including one student who was in the chat.\nChase McCrystal, a 2019 graduate and one of the male students in the group chat said the administration – Lopez, Puente, Tuana – were made aware of this group chat after a video was sent of a female student performing oral sex on a male student.\nMcCrystal said he left the group chat immediately after that video was sent. A few days later, he said he and several other students were brought into the administration one by one to discuss the video and the group chat.\nMcCrystal said the administration asked him a few basic questions such as: how long have you been in the group chat? Did you see any other videos? And then told him he was free to go. He was never disciplined for being in the group and said he never heard from the administration over the incident again.\nThe female student who was in the video said she was also brought into the administration.\n“I was the one who (was threatened with suspension) not the person who had the videos and released them,” said the female in the video. “My experience with that led me to a less shocking realization that they weren’t going to do anything about it.”\nShe also said the administration threatened to get the Sheriff’s Office involved, since she was a minor and the video was technically child pornography.\n“It didn’t make sense to me because it was a video that I didn’t know was being taken and obviously shared that I would not have wanted to be shared,” she recalled.\nShe said another female student was also called into the office over a separate video sent in the group chat. That video was of the female student’s underwear, which a male student filmed and sent in the group chat.\nSeveral students said that student was suspended because of the video, but that he was the only one of the 10-20 students in the group chat that was ever disciplined.\nThe mother of the student who was suspended over the video said when her son told her about the incident, she encouraged him to be honest and take responsibility. But because he was the only student who came forward, she said none of the other male students in the group chat were disciplined.\n“It was obvious what other boys were involved,” she said. “I thought it was totally unfair. There was a whole group of kids that participated and he was the only one that was (suspended). I think they brought maybe four other boys into the office and they all just denied it.”\nShe said she didn’t speak to Lopez over the incident and she was primarily interacting with Tuana.\n“I know for a fact that (the group chat) still continued on after both of our incidents,” said the female who was in one of the videos. She said she saw the messages on her former boyfriend’s phone at some point after the administration questioned students and he confirmed the group chat was still around.\nSeveral former students told the Herald they had sexually explicit content of them shared without their permission.\n“None of my friends thought to (go) to administration,” reported a 2020 female student who said a video of her having sex was circulated among students at the school. “(For) one, the guys in our grade are just going to (ask) why would you do that? And even girls could say that. And then secondly, what are they going to do about it?”\nAnother female student – who graduated in 2021 – recalled an incident from when she was 14 at Carmel Middle School.\n“Nudes of myself were passed around when I was really young and it was really so normal and nobody cared,” she recalled.\nThe regulations\nCarmel Unified School District’s Board Policy (5131.2) states, “corrective actions for a student who commits an act of bullying of any type may include counseling, behavioral intervention and education, and if the behavior is severe or pervasive as defined in Education Code 48900, may include suspension or expulsion in accordance with district policies and regulations.”\nThat education code states that a student should not be suspended or recommended for expulsion unless “the superintendent or principal of the school” determines that the student has committed one of several serious offenses. Sexual assault, sexual battery, and “cybersexual bullying” are listed as just a few of several acts that fall under this policy.\nAccording to the policy, cybersexual bullying means “the dissemination of or the solicitation or incitement to disseminate … a photograph or other visual recording … (that) includes the depiction of a nude, semi-nude or sexually explicit photograph or other visual recording of a minor where the minor is identifiable from the photograph, visual recording or other electronic act.”\nBut the district’s disciplinary policies aren’t the only consequences students could face for distributing these images and videos. According to California Penal Code, any sexually explicit media of a person under 18 years old is considered child pornography and could result in jail time and fines.\nCarrie LeRoy, a partner at Gibson Dunn law firm, works with several school districts – including Carmel Unified School District – to discuss the legal rights and consequences of using social media and technology as a minor.\nLeRoy said she frequently discusses with students the dangers and legal consequences of sending sexually explicit content as a minor.\n“A lot of people don’t understand or assume that if it’s consensual, that it’s OK to do,” LeRoy said. “Even consensual sharing of nude photos of a minor – anyone under the age of 18 – is treated as child pornography and is unlawful in the state of California.”\nIn past years, students’ uninhibited use of technology has resulted in a nightmare for school districts, students and parents.\nIn 2009, a freshman at Los Gatos High School committed suicide after a topless photo of her was circulated online by students. She was 15.\nThree years later, a 15-year-old student at Saratoga High School committed suicide after a similar experience. The student was sexually assaulted at a party, photos of which were then shared online.\n“There were seven days between the time that she was assaulted and she committed suicide in Los Gatos and not a single adult knew what had happened to her, but a lot of students at Saratoga High School did. They were talking about it but no one reported it,” LeRoy said of the case.\nLeRoy said she emphasizes to students that if they don’t get a trusted adult involved, “it’s going to spin out of control.”\n“What I tell young people, including the students at Carmel High School, is if you feel at all threatened or worried that someone has a picture of you, even if you gave it consensually, is to talk to a trusted adult … and then also talk to a lawyer who could help you navigate the situation,” LeRoy said. “A student who’s being harassed on campus has rights. You have a right to go to school without feeling threatened or that it’s an unsafe environment for you.”\nBut rumors of online sexual harassment at Carmel High School extended beyond just students.\nMany former students brought up Jay Christensen, who was a sports medicine teacher and athletic trainer at the high school from 2014-2017. Students described Christensen as a “charismatic,” “funny” and “cool” teacher who they could relate to and said that he frequently interacted with students and recent graduates on social media, including Snapchat and Twitter. But some students and recent graduates said he went too far.\nAriana Flores, a 2017 graduate, said shortly after she graduated, Christensen sent her photos of himself and asked for nude photos in return.\n“He was giving massages to high school girls that he ended up asking for nudes (from) literally months after,” Flores recalled.\nIn 2017, about halfway through the school year, Christensen left the high school.\nChristensen has denied any wrongdoing.\n“I have no comment about the allegations found unequivocally false by investigation through the Carmel/Monterey police department, almost six years ago,” he said in an emailed statement. “While I feel my time at Carmel High School was a positive influence on many of the students there, I have moved on professionally and personally and would thank you in advance to not contact me further regarding this matter.”\nThe Carmel Police Department confirmed that records involving Christensen exist but did not release the records.\nAccording to the district’s policy for maintaining appropriate adult-student interactions, adopted in 2019, employees are prohibited from inviting or accepting social media requests from students or former students who are minors, unless “the site is dedicated to school business.”\nWho is responsible?\nIn 2020, Itzél Rios-Ellis took to Instagram to call out the high school’s administration over the sexual harassment and assault she said she faced as a student.\n“People were starting the conversation more and starting to talk about these things more,” recalled Rios-Ellis, who graduated in 2020. “So I remember completely reaching a boiling point. … And this was around the same time that I had confronted my abuser. And his response really kind of let me know that this is an endemic part of the culture at Carmel High, … that was when I really realized that this is a way bigger issue than I initially thought.”\nRios-Ellis said she was sexually assaulted by a male student during her sophomore year at Carmel High School. She said she was repeatedly asked by those she confided in if she was drunk, if she was in a relationship with the male student or if she was raped, “as if it were the only thing that deserved a conversation or any sort of confrontation.”\nRios-Ellis encouraged other young women to come forward, rapidly igniting a “Me Too” era movement where dozens of students spoke out on social media of the years of harassment they felt they experienced at the high school and demanded change.\n“It became quite a big deal on our campus,” Lyons, the former principal, recalled. “And even though we weren’t in session (because of the pandemic), there was a lot. … It really was a wake-up call for me and for our school that we needed to figure out how to tackle some of this stuff head-on.”\nLyons said when school returned in person the following year, the administration decided to make some big changes. He said they created a task force to address sexual assault and sexual harassment on campus, discussed root causes of harassment stemming from the culture on campus, and revamped the internal school process.\nLyons said the school partnered with the Monterey County Rape Crisis Center, launched the Wellness Center as a place for students to feel safe to talk about these issues, and reevaluated the curriculum. He also said administrators went classroom-to-classroom to discuss the issue with students.\nEmma Brown, a senior and student reporter for the high school’s paper, the Sandpiper, said the administration has made an effort to improve policies and educate students.\n“I know that at the beginning of the school year, administrators come and give presentations on consent and the importance of it, as well as the policy surrounding sexual misconduct investigations on campus,” Brown said. “Which to my knowledge was not something that was happening prior to 2021.”\nBut other students said they felt the changes were too little, too late.\nHayley Armstrong, a 2021 graduate, said she remembered the vice principals going around to classrooms but she felt there was zero accountability for what had happened in the past.\n“It felt like, ‘These are teenagers, they’re going to eat it up if we tell them we’ll do better so let’s just say we’ll do that,’” she said. “But they had no plan. … To me, it just felt like pacifying people. And it also seemed like a way of pushing the responsibility of creating change onto the students to create a solution instead of the administration (when) they’re the adults and they’re the ones who have the ability to actually change things.”\n“The action they were taking was to pacify the student body and not to make an effort to change the culture or to protect the victims or deal with the perpetrators,” said 2021 graduate Elizabeth Lindholm. “It was an incredibly performative change that I saw. And no one talked about it after the whole thing blew over. They didn’t talk about it. They didn’t need to.”\nStudents involved in the movement graduated and the problem of sexual harassment seemed to fade into the background once again.\nUntil recently.\nThe buck stops here\nTed Knight joined the district in 2021. He’s the district’s sixth superintendent in the past 10 years and was recently awarded Superintendent of the Year for the Association of California School Administrators Region 10 – spanning Monterey, San Benito and Santa Cruz counties.\nKnight also serves as the district’s Title IX Coordinator – meaning he is responsible for ensuring the district is in compliance with the federal law preventing sex discrimination.\nKnight told the Herald in February that although it is unusual for a superintendent to hold that role, he chose to keep the position because he was concerned about the things he was hearing.\n“When I came in here, there had obviously been a history of not doing it right and I knew there were things that were being swept under the rug,” Knight said. “This has been a systemic problem and I am now finally tackling it. … This has been wrong for a long time and it’s not been handled.”\nTitle IX is a federal law that prohibits sex discrimination – including sexual harassment and violence – in education programs and activities that receive federal funds. The law protects both students and employees and also prohibits retaliation for filing a complaint or for advocating for a right protected by the law.\nTitle IX requires schools to address allegations of sexual harassment “promptly and supportively.” Schools are required to resolve allegations under a fair grievance process and effectively implement remedies for victims.\n“All CUSD administrators have been trained on Title IX processes multiple times,” the district’s spokesperson, Jessica Hull, told the Herald in an email. “Additionally all staff complete required annual training in the beginning of each year on sexual harassment. Students are trained in an age-appropriate manner at each site.”\nBut a former substitute teacher at the high school said she and other substitute teachers have not received sexual harassment training “in at least three years.” And nearly every student the Herald interviewed said they were not trained on or aware of the Title IX process at the high school – including those who reported harassment to the administration.\nPam Sullivan, a former employee at the high school, said she knew what to do if a student came to her with an allegation but wasn’t prepared to go through the process herself. Sullivan said she was sexually assaulted by a male student at the high school.\n“Until you experience it, the gamut of emotions that go with it is unreal,” she said. “It’s so frustrating because you have no control over anything that is going on.”\nLyons estimated he received around 20-25 allegations of harassment during his time as principal from 2019-2022. He said probably six of those were elevated to Title IX investigations.\nBut in a former interview with the high school’s paper, Tuana said the administration deals with “roughly three to four reported cases of sexual harassment each year.”\nAccording to data from the Office of Civil Rights, Carmel High School reported no incidents of rape or sexual assault at the high school for 2015-2016 and 2017-2018. The 2017-2018 data is the most current data available to the public.\nAt least three students told the Herald they were sexually assaulted during those time periods, and at least one student pressed charges against their assailant.\nLyons also admitted that when dealing with cases of sexual harassment or assault, he is legally prohibited from telling the victim what punishment the perpetrator will receive. He said that’s something he tries to explain to students, as well as letting them know that his jurisdiction ends at Carmel High School.\n“I say, ‘I can’t give you the peace that you want. … I know what you’re going to want and I’m not going to be able to give it to you. I need you to understand that this is the extent of what I can do,’” he explained. “I think a direct result from (from a previous) case, from Itzel’s case, is making sure that claimants know, I’m aching for you. I feel for you. But if you’re looking to me for justice, I can’t give it to you.”\nBut that left students feeling alienated and alone. And when female students who reported harassment or assault were forced to pass their harassers in the hallways or sit next to them in class, it quickly eroded their faith in the school’s administrators.\n“The real issue that the administration is facing is that when something like this happens, the entire student body knows about it,” Lindholm said. “And if they don’t do anything about it, everyone knows.”\n“The administration says something to the effect of, ‘Well there’s nothing we can really do about that,’” said Armstrong, the 2021 graduate. “I can’t name a single person in the administration who I have any warm feelings toward or even a feeling (that) they would handle this properly.”\nA problem in the culture\nSome community members have claimed that sexual harassment and assault at Carmel High School is no worse than at other schools around the country.\nA U.S. Department of Education report found that sexual violence was increasing in schools before the pandemic. Data revealed there were nearly 15,000 incidents of sexual violence in K-12 schools in 2017-2018, compared with 9,649 in 2015-2016. That’s a 55% increase.\nBut students said the district’s amount of funding and resources positions it to be better equipped to handle this issue than many other schools in the country.\n“It’s uniquely bad,” said Rios-Ellis, the 2020 graduate. “I mean, this is definitely a problem at all schools. But the problem with Carmel is that because it’s so uniquely resourced it has so many opportunities to do the right thing and educate the students. This place is a very, very privileged place. And so a lot of parents are able to turn a blind eye because they have the money to do so. And a lot of the administrators are able to turn a blind eye because they have the money to do so.”\n“I think it’s definitely everywhere to an extent. But the way that it’s handled and covered up I think exists primarily at Carmel and probably other schools in really wealthy areas,” Gabrielson said. “The (administrators) are a big part of this but it goes even further than that. It’s the culture of the school because they’re so concerned about their image and the way that they’re perceived by the public that they’ll do anything to cover it up.”\n“I think all of this stuff is a problem everywhere, but to me it’s just especially baffling that this school is the No. 1 funded public school and yet there are these problems that are obviously so pervasive and there’s nothing really being done,” Armstrong said.\nLyons said discipline won’t fix the pervasive problem of harassment. Instead, he said education and collective action are key to changing the culture at the high school.\n“We’ve got to change how kids talk to each other. We’ve got to talk to (each other) and be comfortable bringing things forward,” he said. “We have not collectively said: parents, community, students, we want to talk about this and that’s all we’re going to talk about. And you’re going to have to be OK with it. And it’s going to be uncomfortable and it’s going to be bumpy.”\nWhen asked who is responsible for making the high school a safe place for students and tackling the issue of harassment, the district replied via email:\n“All of us. In order to change systemic issues in our institutions it will take students, staff, parents, the Board of Education, and our greater community to ensure safety for all students.”",
