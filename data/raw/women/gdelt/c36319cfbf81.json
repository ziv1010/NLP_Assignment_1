The owners have been fantastic in supporting myself and the changes that myself and the staff have wanted to make within the building that we have here over the last 18 months, have been fantastic in terms of support in the need for new training pitches and fencing that we now have.\n“But I think we’re still in the position where it’s a building which was built for the academy and now we have the men’s team, the women’s team and the academy age groups all sharing out of the same building and we’re in a Portakabin as we speak.\n“The club has managed well with the Portakabins but to get to where we want to get to eventually, having a more state-of-the-art, purpose-built first-team training facility would be beneficial for now and for the future of the club.”\nBut be believes the grounds themselves have great potential: “We’ve got a really good site in a lovely part of the country where we’re lucky to get nice weather.\n“We’ve got a really good site and we have training pitches now that are of a really high level that help the club.\n“We’ve done lots of internal work to the buildings that are here that have brought them up to spec, but there’s still [more work to be done].\n“We know what areas of the training ground we want to develop and there’s still land that we can use to hopefully develop another building.\n“There’s certainly scope here and the foundations to develop the training ground on this site and hopefully we will have a facility which is excellent for the first team but also for the ladies team and excellent for the academy where they can all thrive for years to come.”\nPhoto: TWTD\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\nCOYB\nI...
