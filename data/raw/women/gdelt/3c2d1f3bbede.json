However, he said he was proud of how the program had stood strong through adversity and he believed the true potential of it can now be shown.\n\"Every year has been very challenging in different ways, but we believe in everything that we provide and we're able to adjust and provide a high quality product to the players that have been in the program,\" he said.\n\"So every year we have had to adjust and to be honest, I have to give credit to all the players that have been in the program for the last few years because all of them push through.\n\"It's been very challenging but an incredible journey at the same time.\"\nOur news app has had a makeover, making it faster and giving you access to even more great content.
