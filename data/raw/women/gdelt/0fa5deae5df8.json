  "body_text": "A late first half strike and second half counterattack, coupled with a denied penalty kick in the final minutes, proved the difference as the Barton Community College women's soccer team's came up short in a 2-1 upset bid hosting No. 8 Cowley College Saturday afternoon at Cavanaugh Field.\nThe result drops the Cougars to fifth in the Jayhawk standings with 16 points at 5-6-1 and 9-7-1 overall, while the Tigers remain atop the league at 9-0-3 in conference play and 9-0-4 on the season. Barton will head back on the road Wednesday for a 3:00 p.m. kickoff at Coffeyville Community College.\nDespite being pinned in for much of the first half by 30-plus mile-per-hour north gusts, Barton's backline stood strong until the final minute when Cowley broke the deadlock on a 30-yard strike carried by the wind that tucked inside the far upper-90, sending the Cougars to the locker room trailing 1-0.\nBarton drew even midway through the second half as Maki Kimura converted from the penalty line following a Cowley handball in the box, marking her sixth goal of the season.\nCowley reclaimed the advantage in the 81st minute when a long through ball slipped behind the Cougar defense, resulting in Sara Cortes far-post finish into an open net as Leonie Chambe got came off her line. Barton nearly forced the equalizer in the closing moments, but Kimura's second penalty kick attempt with 2:09 remaining was denied, thwarting the Cougars of a potential result.\nSara Aguirre led the Cougars with four shots, three on target, while Chambe recorded six saves in net.BARTON SCORING SUMMARY68:03: Maki Kimura (6)",
