  "body_text": "England were overpowered in their Euro 2025 opener as the defending champions fell to a damaging 2-1 defeat to France in Zurich.\nThe Lionesses were dealt a tough group, including both France and the Netherlands, and Sarina Wiegman’s side are now staring down the barrel of a group-stage exit.\nThe defending champions started the contest better and were perhaps unlucky to see Alessia Russo’s goal ruled out by VAR for a narrow offside in the build-up.\nHowever, from that point onwards, England were second best and found themselves two goals down at the break as France caused havoc down both flanks.\nMarie-Antoinette Katoto tapped home Delphine Cacarino’s cross in the 36th minute and just three minutes later, the equally dangerous Sandy Baltimore took advantage of some lax defending to curl a finish past Hannah Hampton.\nEngland made changes shortly after the break to try and wrestle back control, but found themselves overrun for large swathes of the contest.\nPerhaps the only source of optimism was how the Lionesses ended the game after Kiera Walsh’s superb strike gave them a slim chance of rescuing a draw.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

For the latest updates, visit Metro’s Football page.\nThat’s all for now\nAnd with that, we’ll draw our live coverage to an end for today. A poor performance from the Lionesses and they’ll have it all to do against the Dutch on Wednesday to keep their hopes alive.\nWe’ll see you then.\nReaction from England’s captain Leah Williamson\nFULL-TIME: France 2-1 England\nThe full-time whistle goes and England fall short. It’s the first time the defending champions have lost their opening game of the tournament, and the Lionesses are now staring down the barrel of a group-stage exit.\nFrance 2-1 England\n90+5 mins: OFF THE LINE! So close for England as Peyraud-Magnin comes off her line but doesn’t get to the ball. Hemp loops the ball goalwards but it’s cleared off the line by Bacha.\nEngland come forward again, but Clinton’s eventual effort is over the bar.\nFrance 2-1 England\n90+3 mins: England launch another ball forward which Russo does well to make stick, but the Arsenal forward can’t find the space for a clear shot on goal.\nAnother stoppage now as Jean-Francois goes down and requires treatment. Not quite sure what for.\nFrance 2-1 England\n90 mins: CHANCE! Agyemang has been a right nuisance since coming on and almost finds England’s equaliser as a long ball into the box from Bronze lands at her feet.\nIt’s well struck but blocked by the French defence.\nFive minutes of added time as Peyraud-Magnin is shown a yellow card for timewasting.\nFrance 2-1 England\n89 mins: Charles, Bronze and Williamson will form a makeshift back three as England frantically try to win back the ball and get up the pitch.\nGOAL! France 2-1 England (Walsh, 87 mins)\nOut of nowhere England have one back. Agyemang is thrown on for Greenwood as England move to a back three and the striker makes an instant impact by throwing her weight around at the corner.\nThe loose ball falls to Walsh and it’s some hit from the edge of the box by the Chelsea midfielder. England have been second-best her for almost the entire game, but can they somehow rescue a draw now?\nFrance 2-0 England\n85 mins: Five minutes of normal time remaining and finally England create something in this second half. Toone’s first effort is blocked, and the Manchester United midfielder’s follow-up effort is deflected behind for a corner.\nFrance 2-0 England\n80 mins: Changes for the French as Karchaoui and De Almeida come off for N’Dongala and Toletti.\nFrance 2-0 England\n76 mins: Bacha whips a ball into the box, but Diani’s eventual header goes wide off the post. England turn to their bench again as Clinton comes on for Stanway.\nFrance 2-0 England\n75 mins: 15 minutes remaining and France are still running the show. They look far more likely to score a third than England do getting one back.\nToone picks up a yellow card for a late challenge on Bacha.\nFrance 2-0 England\n68 mins: A coming together between Karchaoui and Williamson leaves both on the deck, and the French captain appears to have come off the worse.\nA VAR check is underway for a red card for Karchaoui… but nothing doing. That wasn’t a great tackle, mind you.\nFrance 2-0 England\n64 mins: England will hope those changes can spark a change, but France are still dominating the midfield battle.\nHampton spills a cross on the edge of the six-yard box, but Charles is on hand to hack the ball clear.\nFrance 2-0 England\n60 mins: And here come those subs. Charles, Kelly and Toone come on for Carter, Mead and James.\nJames has been England’s brightest attacking spark, but she’s not risked for more than 60 minutes given she’s only recently back from a long-term injury.\nFrance 2-0 England\n59 mins: France cut through England once again down the right, but Karchaoui can’t find the target from a tight angle.\nEngland preparing a triple change on the bench.\nFrance 2-0 England\n57 mins: England almost catch France out with a quickly taken corner, but Hemp’s eventual effort is poor and wide of the target.\nFrance 2-0 England\n54 mins: CLOSE! Almost a third for France as Katoto finds Geyoro inside the box. It’s straight at Hampton, but the England keeper has to scramble back and recover the ball on the line after it nearly slipped under her.\nFrance 2-0 England\n52 mins: A half chance for England on the break but a heavy touch from Russo gives possession away on the edge of the France box.\nFrance 2-0 England\n51 mins: Great footwork again from De Almeida who cuts inside onto her left foot before curling an effort into the side netting.\nAll France again in the early stage of this second half.\nMORE: Why are Mary Earps and Millie Bright not playing for England at Euro 2025?\nMORE: TV fans all say the same thing as the soaps are taken off air\nMORE: Meet the new stars hoping to breathe fresh life into England’s Euros defence",
