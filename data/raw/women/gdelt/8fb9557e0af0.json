  "body_text": "David Moyes is expected to have a strong say in Everton’s recruitment plans this summer and the Scottish manager is keen to bring in “great characters” as the Blues prepare for a massive rebuild.\nThe 62-year-old secured a strong finish to the season as Everton won their last three games on the trot to finish the league season in 13th place and on 48 points. Moyes will remain busy throughout the summer as the club heads into a topsy-turvy transfer window where they will need to make several signings in order to address the vast number of player departures.\n“Characters will always make football clubs,” he told the club website when asked about his approach to recruitment. “We want ability and quality. We have great characters here, and I need to add to that, and I need to continue to find people who can fill the boots of maybe ones which have left or may move on. So, yes, character plays a huge part in all managers’ decision-making.”\nNow in his second spell on Merseyside, Moyes was asked about the changes he has observed since his first reign ended over a decade ago. His first spell at the club was a long one as Moyes managed the club for 11 seasons between 2002 and 2013.\n“There have been lots of changes while I’ve been away. We used to have quite a small building, a small number of staff – and it’s now expanded greatly,” said the Everton boss.\n“We’ve got the women’s team, the under-21s, under-18s and all of the academy also with us at Finch Farm, so there are a lot more people.\n“There are all sorts of things that have changed across the club and I think lots of things are very good, but there are also things I think that would be better if we try to change and look to go in a different direction in some ways.”\nMoyes left the Toffees in 2013 to replace Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester Utd, although unsuccessfully. After a year in Spain with Real Sociedad, he returned to England to manage Sunderland for a season in which they made the worst ever start to a Premier League season, taking just 2 points from their opening 10 matches. The club was relegated for the first time in 10 years at the end of 2016–17, finishing bottom of the table, and Moyes resigned. He would go on to have two spells at West Ham Utd, winning the Europa Conference League in 2023.\nWith more than 700 Premier League fixtures, the Scottish manager has a lot of experience under his belt. Only Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson have managed more games than Moyes. As such, he has also seen the league and football evolve over the years.\n“Tactics have changed a lot. There have been big changes in football. Tactics are important but, behind it all, if you don’t win, then it doesn’t really matter about your tactics because people want winning teams.\n“One thing that hasn’t changed is the intensity, which has always been there in the Premier League. I think that’s an expectation that comes from the culture of this country. People want intensity, quick, competitive football. We’ve had so many influences come into the country as well, for example, coaches like Pep Guardiola, Arsene Wenger, Carlo Ancelotti – so many influences from different countries, and they’ve all had an impact on the Premier League.“\nReader Comments (41)\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.

No insight, no blue perspective, just content creation. Copy, run it through AI, paste.\n6 Posted 04/06/2025 at 23:06:34\nIf this is the new ToffeeWeb, I'm out. What a pile of crap.\n7 Posted 05/06/2025 at 00:22:21\nWhere's Paul Ferry, by the way?\n8 Posted 05/06/2025 at 00:25:50\n9 Posted 05/06/2025 at 00:57:23\n10 Posted 05/06/2025 at 07:41:01\nWe all are Everton 24/7 and probably scour other sites bringing news and opinions to this site, but have to try to formulate them into our own opinions or see them demolished if we can't defend them. We may even agree to differ, navigating a uneasy truce in our posting.\nIt's like preparing a essay and just transfering facts from books, instead of analysing and assimilating, then writing them in our own words. Words are a reflection of one's soul and if you are a Evertonian, you will recognise that Lyndon and Micheal were Evertonians. Anjishnu will catch the bug like the rest of us long suffering unfortunates.\nWe are also a tolerant bunch as a result and will contribute as new owners find their bearings. We have to do that anyway.\n11 Posted 05/06/2025 at 08:08:48\nNext seasons fixtures are out on 18 June. Then we can all moan about 5 away games on the run — or not, as the case maybe.\n12 Posted 05/06/2025 at 08:37:20\nI went through a phase where I never read Lyndon and Michael's articles – just read the comments. You would soon pick up what the article was about.\nI've learnt a lot about life and football reading the views on here.\nBorn a blue, I fell out of love at the age of 10 when they sold my hero Alan Ball. It was a pure accident that I came back in the 80s and witnessed our triumphs.\nSadly I have detached my emotions once again, during the later years of Kenwright and the idiot spendthrift Moshiri...\nTarkowski's last-minute equaliser against the Red Shite is my personal highlight of the last 5 or so years. That Goodison roar is music to my ears and gives me goose bumps.\nI really hope the new stadium is the start if a new exciting era. We have fallen so much behind the Red Shite's shadow, it's gonna take a small miracle to ever get back to being their equals – or, as in the '80s, better. At 65, I'm running out of time. My son is in his 40s and has never witnessed what I did. So I hope my grand kids will one day feel what it's like to beCchampions and BMD emulates or surpasses the old lady.\nCheers to all you blues around the world — we live in hope.\n13 Posted 05/06/2025 at 08:59:12\nSo it's not a problem for me that they bring news from other sources, just like TW has always done, actually.\n14 Posted 05/06/2025 at 09:02:32\nI now go straight past the original article and into the comments which are mostly (but not completely) written by humans in the hope that a real supporter will have posted something knowledgable and worth reading.\nIn 5 years time, most supporters will either not know the difference or be switched off from the site completely. I am very close to switching off completely from this technotripe.\nWe will soon have AI-generated podcasts with discussions between two smartphones with blue cases and artificial Californian Valley Girl voices in between the adverts.\nWho the fuck are the content creators trying to impress with their constant recapping and repetition of career details/filling in paragraphs with stuff which a 5 year old can see is just verbal polyfilla?\nSadly, the sites are full of pointless, energy consuming “content” resembling badly constructed AI eBay adverts for pointless, useless Shyte.\nWill this get past the “ being read by moderators for suitability” screen?\n15 Posted 05/06/2025 at 09:46:28\ner, yes!\n16 Posted 05/06/2025 at 09:49:56\nWe have to be active, no choice: squad releases, loan returns leave us way under strength. Loans are going to be a key feature again: can we get them right? We need hungry rising stars needing playing time rather than injured cast offs.\nPurchases are tough because more clubs will be active this window. Liverpool, Man Utd, Man City, Chelsea already splashing the cash. Brighton, Wolves, Bournemouth are mining for the same nuggets we are, and arguably have better established scouting networks.\nI suspect there will be Branthwaite pressure, big bids may force our hand, hence links to other central defenders. It's going to be a busy but not easy few months.\nI agree with wanting characters in the team. We are a team short on leaders. You can have plenty of talent but you also need winners, ask Peter Reid and Andy Gray.\n17 Posted 05/06/2025 at 09:51:04\nWhat's an AI article?\n18 Posted 05/06/2025 at 10:05:31\nI think we need better characters than him, Davie!\nEditorial Team\n19 Posted 05/06/2025 at 12:17:50\nLike those who have posted above, I hate the way many online sources are going, especially the clickbait ones which all seem to have the same formula: Grabber Headline; insipid mind-numbing garbage on the first page, to make you scroll down through the ads; then a Second Headline; and below it one small sentence which usually contains the 'news' itself — and at least a link to the source of the news.\nI hope our folks don't go headlong this same path, but the pressures are there to put up content and get readers. My hope is that it can be done with an individual touch, not by emulating these other sites but by maintaining a more independent assessment of the news — but from a strongly Evertonian perspective.\nOne thing I think we have to be careful of is repetition, which I personally hate. There is a journalistic style, though, which seeks to fill in the so-called background for the lowest common denominator — which I think runs a dangerous path of alienating the vast majority of readers we have on here who are keeping up with the news and very much don't need to hear it repeated again and again.\nI think AI is a somewhat different problem, as those pieces Ian Jones submitted to us have shown. (Paul @17, AI will write an entire article for you if you give it the right prompts.)\nIt can certainly help in preparing content, but the stigma associated with it is clearly off-putting for many. Whether that changes over time, I don't know, but I'd like to think that, if AI content is used, it moderated, curated, edited by a humanoid to make it more acceptable for most readers.\nAndy, you asked about Paul Ferry. His attacks on other posters have never stopped, but they seem to have become a lot worse, leading to long tirades that have nothing to do with the topic. I don't believe this is what people want to read on here and I hope he can constrain himself to posting about the topic.\n20 Posted 05/06/2025 at 12:26:18\nI think one of the key moves in getting stories on here is to get a lot more genuine “Good News“ articles like Charlie Adam is leaving Everton — cracking start to my day that!\n21 Posted 05/06/2025 at 12:29:10\nWhilst bizarre, libertarian, flat earth, anti-immigrant, manosphere, anti-vax conspiracy theorising is permitted.\nProvided it is said politely?\n22 Posted 05/06/2025 at 12:31:51\nI'm always tempted to 'editorialize' with my own (usually strongly held) opinion in such items… but over time, you can always guarantee that someone else will post exactly what I think about the matter in hand. So I've learnt to be slightly more 'balanced' — but this never will be like the Beeb!\nEditorial Team\n23 Posted 05/06/2025 at 12:41:36\nI usually knock that stuff on the head too if I see it.\nI don't know if you are flagging such comments and reporting them as 'abusive' — I haven't seen such a report for a very long time (pre-transition) and I have no idea where they go!\nI suspect you have one poster in particular in mind. Yea, he's good at sliding it in without attracting a lot of attention, but I shall try to be more vigilant.\n24 Posted 05/06/2025 at 12:56:28\nAs I said 15 minutes ago on the Beto 3 thread, I've been away from TW for quite a while, so have just realised this site is now under new owners.\nThought LL and MK (not Michael Keane, as it goes) had left. Are you still adjudicating in some regard, Mr K?\n25 Posted 05/06/2025 at 13:17:12\nWhile we are complaining, one of the things that irritates me are when cliques develop.\nI've posted on here for years and while I may talk nonsense from time to time among what I would consider good viewpoints, there are certain fellow fans I have never ever had a response from good or bad.\nThey are not obliged to thats true but I do find it strange, why.\n26 Posted 05/06/2025 at 13:18:43\nThese sites are businesses who need posters all year to keep their business alive. I did worry when both Michael and Lyndon left as the new owners seemed to be struggling, but it seems Michael has got them back to what T/W does best which is put up posts which gets the posters commenting.\n27 Posted 05/06/2025 at 13:23:21\n28 Posted 05/06/2025 at 17:23:33\nThank you for tidying up and saying exactly what I wanted to say in my post but could never do it as well.\nI appreciate how the site owners need to monetise their content and keep it as a free of charge service to the likes of us. So a certain amount of clickbait writing has to be tolerated.\nI just wish it could all be done by humans. AI might be great for working out an electric car's charging regime, or diagnosing illness from a scan. But I can't abide it being used in a medium where opinion and discussion are the reasons for its existence.\nIt sort of undermines the years of dedicated work that you, LL and others have put into making the site what it is — the best football site bar none.\n29 Posted 05/06/2025 at 17:56:51\nIt's a tough balance to strike, I'd imagine. We all want enough content to keep us engaged and debating each other about football, mental health, wars in the Middle East, and the best part of Liverpool to be from. On the other hand, the click-bait, churn-it-out, seemingly-AI generated stuff cheapens the site quite a bit. I was actually so convinced that Anjishnu's stuff was written by ChatGPT that I ran some of it through AI detectors to find out (it appears it's likely not).\nI thought people would gravitate to Evertonia, because the quality is so much higher, but I assume some combination of less regular content and getting a critical enough mass to leave TW when we're conditioned to it means it hasn't taken hold. In some perfect world, I think, Lyndon would add to his occasional deep dives with some other true Blues-written pieces; we would all leave for Evertonia; and to get the regular doses we need, people would comment on threads that just have headlines (eg: “re-sign DCL, yes or no?”). I think also to get improved content, people would pay £50/year and then demand it.\nI'm not buying that Anjishnu is going to become a Blue. He's a content creator working for a site that just cares about clicks, and he doesn't participate in the comments, which I think matters in order to feel connected to the stuff being written. But I guess for now it's all we've got. It just would feel better if we got 3-5 thoughtful pieces a week instead of these 1-2 day periods where a bunch of crap all gets thrown at us at once.\n30 Posted 05/06/2025 at 18:11:02\n31 Posted 05/06/2025 at 18:26:50\nI am willing to tolerate some AI experiments but if the material is not up to standard I am going meta on the discussions.\n32 Posted 05/06/2025 at 18:49:53\nThere won't be any fewer comments, as it's the comments themselves (as much as the initial article) which generate so many of the subsequent comments. Less is more.\n33 Posted 05/06/2025 at 19:02:15\nPerhaps the need is to be a bit more selective now?\n34 Posted 05/06/2025 at 20:26:38\nIts the comments and banter from posters that I'm most interested in provided the topic is relevant.\n35 Posted 05/06/2025 at 20:33:20\nEditorial Team\n36 Posted 05/06/2025 at 21:50:18\nHi Kev @24, and welcome back. I've been helping the new guys through the transition in site ownership, and doing the matchday stuff, but obviouslyy that is on a break now.\nRaymond @25, I assume by 'cliques' you mean a few posters who ramp up the banter with a string of posts between them... that very often go off topic? That's the point at which I try to cut them off, if I'm actively monitoring the site.\nBut if you're looking for more responses to your own posts, I think that part of it is completely organic.\nBrian @26, I think you nail the challenge here, which is to put up articles with enough \"genuine\" content (to co-opt Brent's perfect word @32!), but not so many that we are descending into the clickbait world.\nMicky @28, I don't think news items are being generated by AI, but Ian Jones openly used it for his recent Beto vs Calvert-Lewin trilogy… which was interesting to a point, but fell well flat in the final piece — definitely a case of \"less is more\", Brent @32.\nJonanthan @29, your extensive comments are much appreciated as they perfectly capture a range of issues that are in play here.\nAnd Raymond @34:\nIt's the comments and banter from posters that I'm most interested in — provided the topic is relevant.\nThat pretty much captures it in one simple statement.\nThanks, all.\n37 Posted 05/06/2025 at 21:57:07\nThey probably show a lot lower views on the page stats, which may be why they haven't been done so far, but I will raise this again and see if we can get something moving there.\n38 Posted 06/06/2025 at 05:22:01\n\"There is a journalistic style, though, which seeks to fill in the so-called background for the lowest common denominator — which I think runs a dangerous path of alienating the vast majority of readers we have on here\"\nThis is the problem I have with some of the content, the background info that we already know, repeated in each new article.\nBut I guess the site owners are looking for their content to be picked up by other sources that are maybe not True Blue and their readers wouldn't know the background?\nAs I said at #13, TW is my only news source so I just skip over the background noise to get to the actual content.\nBut guys, if you don't like the articles, submit some of your own.\n39 Posted 06/06/2025 at 10:28:57\nEverton say nothing. Everton generally do nothing that enriches its fanbase.\nEverton really don't care about the fanzines. Probably despise those who run and participate in or on them.\nIf genuine verified news is all you want, switch off your phone and come back for the first game.\n40 Posted 06/06/2025 at 12:26:31\nA lot of people have an extremely low opinion of journalists but, if they tried doing a spot of journalism themselves, they might find it's a lot harder than it looks!\n41 Posted 07/06/2025 at 20:09:37\nAdd Your Comments\nIn order to post a comment, you need to be logged in as a registered user of the site.\nOr Sign up as a ToffeeWeb Member — it's free, takes just a few minutes and will allow you to post your comments on articles and Talking Points submissions across the site.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW",
