  "body_text": "With no postseason appearance in the cards for the first time since 2017, Seattle Reign hopes to close out their season with a good performance. The Reign will be facing tough competition in their final match of the season when they go up against the 2024 NWSL Shield winners, the Orlando Pride, on the road.\nThe game kicks off at 2 PM PT on Saturday, November 2, and will air on ION.\n\"We're obviously disappointed that we haven't been able to do that [win] too much this year or enough to be able to claw our way into the playoffs, but it doesn't mean that that's what we don't strive to do every day. We definitely strive to do that,\" head coach Laura Harvey said when asked how the team approaches this match.\nRecent results\nThe Reign beat the Houston Dash 2-1 at home in their last regular-season match. The Pride lost their second straight match, falling 3-1 to Gotham on the road.\nHead-to-Head\nThis is the second regular season matchup between the two teams in 2024.\n- Orlando beat the Reign 3-2 in Seattle back in May.\n- The Reign are 7-3-7 against the Pride, scoring 28 goals and conceding 17.\n- That includes a 2-2-4 record on the road.\nQuick Stats\n- Orlando (17-2-6, 57 points) has scored 43 goals and conceded 18.\n- Seattle (6-15-5, 23 points) has scored 25 goals and conceded 41.\n- The Reign are 2-9-1 on the road this season. Orlando is 9-0-3 at home.\n- Barbra Banda leads the Pride with 13 goals and 6 assists.\nWhat to Watch\nStarting strong\nThe Orlando Pride have only been losing at halftime in three matches – their first game of the season, which ended in a comeback draw, and their last two games, both losses. One of the reasons they've been so successful is because of their ability to create early chances and finish them. They've only had to mount a comeback in two games, which happened to be their first two games of the season. The Pride have led at halftime in 13 of their 25 games. The Reign have led at halftime just four times – going 2-1-1 in those games. Simply put, Orlando thrives when they have early momentum. The Reign need to be energized to start this match.\nThe Reign didn't come out strong in their match against the Pride in May, but they responded well and became one of just five teams to score at least two goals against Orlando this season. Coach Harvey was pleased with the team's offensive performance in that match and hopes they can replicate some of that on Saturday.\n\"For us, it's about trying to control the game when we can with the ball and without the ball, make it as challenging as possible for them,\" said Harvey. \"And if we win it off them, trying to create opportunities in those moments.\"\nAnother team dangerous in transition\nThe Pride, like several teams at the top of the league, are dangerous in transition – especially with a player like Barbra Banda leading the frontline. According to American Soccer Analysis, the Pride have scored four fastbreak goals, third best in the league. One thing that makes Orlando a little unique is that they don't rely on a high press and high backline to succeed in this transition game.\nIn fact, the Pride average 50.1% possession. They are comfortable with the ball and aren't always applying quick pressure to opponents. The Pride are whistled for the fewest fouls in the league and are fifth in possession won in their attacking third. They defend deep, with numbers behind the ball, but have the speed and athleticism to transition on opponents quickly.\nSet pieces could be key\nThe Pride have scored eight goals off corner kicks and set pieces, second most in the league. Meanwhile, the Reign have conceded nine goals this way, including conceding the game-winner to Pride on a corner kick when the two teams faced off in Seattle in May. As the Reign continue to rotate their starting lineup – they've had 25 different lineups in 25 matches – whoever plays together on Saturday will need to mark tightly on corner kicks and free kicks.\nReferees\nREF: Melinda Homa\nAR1: Ben Rigel\nAR2: Salma Perez\n4TH: Alejo Calume\nVAR: Danielle Chesky\nAVAR: Tom Felice\nLineups\nHighlights\n9' - Ally Watt gets behind and opens the scoring for the Pride.\n10' - Jordyn Huitema responds a minute later to equalize for the Reign!\n25' - Kerry Abello puts Orlando up 2-1. It appears she shoves Emeri Adames on the play, and the goal call is delayed for a long time while being reviewed, but it ultimately doesn't go to a VAR on-field review.
