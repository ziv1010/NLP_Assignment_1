  "body_text": "VICTIMS of domestic abuse are being urged ‘not to suffer in silence’ following the conviction of a professional rugby player who assaulted his ex-partner.\nDion Aiye, 35, was branded an ‘entitled bully’ by a judge and slammed for his treatment of women as he was sentenced at Preston Crown Court last week for assault by beating and harassment.\nThe former captain of Whitehaven Rugby League had kicked his ex-girlfriend to the stomach and held her by the throat, leaving her in fear for her life. He was also verbally abusive to her and sent her messages, telling her to kill herself.\nAiye was handed an 18-month community order with unpaid work and a restraining order which bans him from contacting the victim and her daughter for five years.\nHe has since been given an eight-match suspension by the Rugby Football League (RFL) following an Operational Rules Tribunal on Tuesday evening.\nThe RFL said in reaching its decision, the tribunal had considered the offence and the sentence handed down by the court, and the restrictions the player had already been subject to for a period preceding his conviction.\nSome Whitehaven supporters have criticised the club’s response to Aiye’s crimes. He was chosen to play against Swinton Lions just three days after he had been sentenced for the offences.\nThe club has since issued a statement saying it accepts the findings by the judicial system and the RFL tribunal and now wishes to ‘draw a line’ under the matter.\nThe deputy police, fire and crime commissioner, who last year ran a competition among rugby league teams, including Whitehaven, to ‘call out’ violence against women, has now urged other domestic abuse victims to come forward.\nMike Johnson, deputy police, fire and crime commissioner, said: “Raising awareness around violence against anyone, including women and girls, with the public will always be a priority.\n“Last year, the OPFCC supported a Property Fund application to run a competition amongst Rugby League teams to help raise the profile of violence against women and girls. This competition has now ended.\n“I would urge any women and girls that have been affected by violence to report it to the Police on 101 or 999 in an emergency.\n“If you do not wish to contact the Police, there are services commissioned in Cumbria to help you including Victim Support who can be contacted on 0300 303 0157 or through their website at www.victimsupport.org.uk/cumbria.\n“There is no need to suffer in silence, please reach out – you are not alone.”\nDetective Chief Inspector Vicki Coombes, force lead on domestic abuse, said: “Tackling domestic abuse and safeguarding vulnerable people is a key priority for Cumbria Constabulary.\n“We take all reports seriously and we treat all cases with sensitivity.\n“If you are suffering, please get in touch. We are here to help and support you.\n“Nobody should ever have to suffer domestic abuse. If you’re scared at home, there is help out there.\n“There is a whole wealth of support services available in Cumbria – this can include counselling, financial advice, substance or alcohol misuse or emotional health and wellbeing.”\nYou can get more advice about domestic abuse here.",
