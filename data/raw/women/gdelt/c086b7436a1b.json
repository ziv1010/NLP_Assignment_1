These top 10 picks include the items that wowed our panel of testers and WWD Shop editors across multiple skin types, hair textures, and glam goals. Below, you’ll find our beauty regimen holy grails and true recommendations for shopping skin care, hair care, makeup, and beyond from Amazon.\nClean Skin Club Clean Towels\nThese towelettes easily remove lipsticks and foundations when wet, and soak up water when you need to dry your skin. They’re great for use at home or when traveling — and are far more sanitary than reusing damp wash cloths that have been stored in a dark bathroom. The disposable towels have a soft texture, but don’t let that fool you — each one is durable and highly absorbent.\nEditor testing and review notes: “If I’m traveling, I always pack a handful of these towelettes in my purse. I feel better using these over hotel towels, and if I’m staying with friends, I don’t have to worry about staining their wash cloths with my makeup. They’re soft on the skin and give me a little exfoliation, too.” — Sullivan\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $17.05\nCrest 3D Whitestrips Teeth Whitening Kit\nThis product is so highly praised and universally loved that it needs no introduction: When you want your pearly whites to shine, there’s no better choice than Crest 3D Whitestrips. The strips brighten your teeth while lifting stains from common culprits like red wine, coffee, and berries.\nEditor testing and review notes: “My teeth are highly sensitive, and Crest’s white strips are a rarity in that they deliver the brightening results I want without causing pain when I sip an icy drink the next day.” — Sullivan\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $44.95\nLancôme Lip Idôle Squalane-12 Butterglow Hydrating Lip Balm\nFor soft, hydrated lips with a touch of natural shine, Lip Idôle Squalane 12 Butterglow Hydrating Lip Balm is a must-have. The tinted lip balm is infused with squalane and rich butters that work together to nourish and hydrate, giving lips a smooth, plump appearance. Perfect for daily use, this balm — which is prone to selling out in popular shades — keeps lips feeling comfortable and looking naturally glossy all day long.\nEditor testing and review notes: “Lancôme’s Lip Idôle Squalane-12 Butterglow Hydrating Lip Balm in shade 10 Keep It Glowy delivers what I think of as the ‘no-lipstick lipstick’ look. That buttery, hydrating feel is delivered immediately upon application, while the buildable pink hue really allows the wearer to decide how pink they want their pout to look. In my testing experience, a few swipes of this top product made my lips look naturally flushed with a pinch of pink that revitalizes and amplifies the appearance of one’s lips. That level of pigment control while also delivering long-lasting hydration is a rarity in lip color products, in my experience.” — WWD Director of Commerce Adam Mansuroglu\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $24\nSacheu Lip Liner Stay-n Peel Off Lip Stain\nPopularized on TikTok courtesy of creators like Alix Earle, Sacheu’s lip stain is a shortcut for fuller-looking lips that won’t smudge or transfer all night long. Simply exfoliate your lips, trace the product around the perimeter of your smile, then wait 10 minutes as it sets. Then peel off the top layer of product (it lifts easily) to reveal a wash of color that stays put for hours on end.\nEditor testing and review notes: “I’ve tried a handful of peel-off lip stains, and this one gives me the best results by far. You have to dunk the wand into the tube a few times to get enough product to fully line your lips, but the formula applies and fades super evenly. And most importantly, it doesn’t budge, making it a great option for busy days at work or long nights out. The Muah-ve shade is a perfect neutral with plum undertones — I love how it wears under a coat of lip gloss of lip oil. — Sullivan\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $12\nMaybelline Lash Sensational Sky High Washable Mascara\nOver 80,000 five-star reviewers on Amazon sing the praises of this Maybelline mascara for its lightweight-yet-thickening formula, as well as the wand’s ability to layer on coats without resulting in clumps. We also unanimously agree on the mascaras super washable formula that leaves no panda eyes or stained residue behind. However, you’ll notice that your bare lashes are softer than they started, thanks to conditioning bamboo extract that supports long-term lash health.\nEditor testing and review notes: “This mascara is particularly impressive for its super flexible wand. I love that the bristles taper at the end, because it allows me to comb each lash for clean, clump-free volume. The formula leans on the wet side, which makes it ideal for building impressive length, while the bamboo extract makes it wear comfortably on the eye throughout the day — no brittle lashes here. It’s also impressively easy to wash away with a simple makeup remover or micellar water.” — Former WWD Shop writer Olivia Cigliano\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $8.32\nEltaMD UV Daily Broad Spectrum Sunscreen\nEven on cloudy days, UVA and UVB rays pose a danger to our skin and can cause irreversible damage if not protected against. The trick for everyday SPF usage is to find a sunscreen you actually enjoy putting on, and any EltaMD formula is delightful. But this UV Daily is especially convenient as it provides both serious hydration (boosted with hyaluronic acid) and broad-spectrum UV protection. This face sunscreen-meets-moisturizer has over 15,000 reviews, which is incredible for the oft-overlooked category of sun protection.\nEditor testing and review notes: “This is a daily staple in my skin care routine and I never leave the house without slathering it all over my face, neck and tops of my hands.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “I have been using Elta MD sunscreen for several years. (I prefer the non-tinted, as the tinted can leave a stain inside my sun hats). This sunscreen has all the protection of zinc oxide along with UVA/UVB protection. It leaves my skin with a soft texture and no tell-tale white that might otherwise be the case with zinc oxide. This is transparent zinc oxide. Recently, I asked my dermatologist about it, as I saw he had a display for Elta in his office. He said it’s ‘the best sunscreen on earth.'”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $35\nCosRx Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence\nCosRx’s snail mucin serum is an Amazon all-star, clinching the number one best-selling spot across all of Amazon’s facial serums. The cooling gel essence features a high concentration of snail mucin, an ingredient that delivers hydration on contact, and shows promise for smoothing fine lines and soothing redness when used consistently. One WWD Shop editor tried it out — read our CosRx snail mucin essence testing review for all the details.\nEditor testing and review notes: “CosRx snail mucin essence feels like a lightweight gel on your skin, and dries down to a dewy finish that made my complexion look hydrated and feel silky. After two weeks of testing, I’ve noticed less redness and a subtle plumping effect that’s smoothed fine lines, particularly on my forehead.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “I absolutely swear by this product. I’ve recommended snail mucin to my mom and grandma and they’ve both bought it and absolutely love it. It’s super hydrating, light, and leaves your skin glowing and feeling amazing. I have super sensitive skin so I was hesitant about buying it, but I read the reviews and I do have to say that this stuff actually works.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $18.95\nNooni Appleberry Lip Oil\nNooni’s Appleseed Lip Oil stains the lips with a watercolor-like tint while delivering lightweight hydration. That — combined with its under-$15 price point — has earned it hundreds of thousands of views on TikTok and over 11,000 five-star reviews on Amazon. We recommend the Appleberry shade, which reads as a cool pink.\nEditor testing and review notes:“I was blown away by the quality of this lip oil, given its price. It’s intensely pigmented, so you only need one coat to tint your lips — and it leaves behind a gorgeous stain when it fades. I find that it gives me about an hour of moisture; after that, I follow up with a lip balm as needed, since the stain stays put for about four hours. Just note that the proportions of the product are small, including both the amount of product in the tube as well as the size of the wand. ” — Sullivan\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $12\nSamnyte Hair Wax Stick\nThe Samnyte Hair Wax Stick is your ticket to snatched and sleek hair styling, and it comes recommended by model Josephine Skriver. Take it from over 30,000 five-star Amazon reviews that deem it the best product to tame flyaways and slick updos without leaving sticky or crunchy residue.\nEditor testing and review notes: “When I first dabbled in the slicked-back ponytail look, this stick was my training wheels — it’s mess-free to apply and practically glues down the flyaways my naturally curly hair gets around my temples. And even after trying pomades and oils that go for $30 or more, I still find myself coming back to this budget-friendly stick. It doesn’t leave white specks in its wake and ensures my hair won’t budge, even in gusty weather.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “I have the peskiest baby hairs and I hadn’t found a product that worked. I had tried something else that was more like a gel, but it made my hairs super hard. This is almost perfect. You can tell that its effectiveness fades over the course of the day, but I’ll take what I can get.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $7.99\nTop Skin Care Products on Amazon\nLaneige Lip Sleeping Mask\n#3 Amazon Bestseller in Lip Balms & Moisturizers\nThe gold standard of leave-on lip masks, this Laneige treatment delivers intense moisture and antioxidants while you sleep (or any time of the day) through the collaboration of ingredients like berry fruit complex, murumuru seed, and shea butter. The intensive-care mask can be a savior for chronically dehydrated lips and is especially helpful as an eleventh-hour cure before a big, glamorous function. You don’t need your horoscope to tell you that oh-so-soft pouts are in your near future.\nEditor testing and review notes: One editor on the WWD Shop team uses this beauty product ever single night for his dry, chapped lips and has seen a noticeable difference when he wakes up in the morning.\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $24\nL’Oréal Paris Revitalift 3% Retinol Serum\nBelieve it or not, you can achieve all your anti-aging skin goals without shelling out the big bucks. WWD Shop Editors point to the L’Oréal Paris Revitalift 3% Retinol Serum as proof, as its formula deposits potent retinol, teamed with nourishing vitamin E and hyaluronic acid, with impressive fine line-smoothing results. After consistent testing, we found this top anti-aging serum delivers on fading discoloration too, and visibly improves the appearance of pores and overall skin elasticity.\nEditor testing and review notes: “The first thing I do when I’m trying a new product is review the product’s ingredient list. L’Oréal’s retinol serum passed my inspection with flying colors, courtesy of a hefty dose of retinol — a proven anti-aging ingredient — as well as vitamin E and hyaluronic acid, which in my experience, help to reduce any irritation I feel from using a retinol product. It feels lightweight but hydrating on my skin, which is a winning combination in my evening skin care routine.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “My skin texture feels smoother, softer. I’ve been using this product over six months and plan to continue. The overall appearance of my skin has improved including fine lines and wrinkles. I like the silky texture of this serum. So happy with the results.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $31.68\nAugustinus Bader The Eye Patches\nBesides flaunting enviable hair during the 2025 Grammy Awards, Charli XCX (who was nominated a total of eight times and took home three trophies) also had flawless skin — all because of The Method by Augustinus Bader, a carefully curated and multi-step routine featuring the TikTok-viral brand’s bestsellers. One of these is Augustinus Bader’s The Eye Patches, which were applied to Charli XCX’s under-eye area to help brighten it, reduce puffiness, and lock in moisture. These patches also work to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and other signs of aging, as well as to calm redness and irritation. In other words, they’re multitalented legends and are bound to transform an area of your face that’s, alas, often neglected in favor of other priorities. PS: We included the eye patches on our roundup of the best under-eye masks of 2025. They’re just that good.\nEditor testing and review notes: “These eye patches are exactly what you’d expect from Augustinus Bader: They’re carefully packaged in individual saucers with plenty of serum, they feel lightweight and cooling on the skin, and you’ll actually notice a difference when you use them regularly. To get the most bang for my buck, I usually leave them on for a full hour. When I peel them off, my eyes look brighter and way more hydrated.” — Senior Beauty and Lifestyle Commerce Editor Claire Sullivan\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $130\nShani Darden Skin Care Triple Acid Signature Peel\nA big list of celebrities — think Jessica Alba, Shay Mitchell, and Kelly Rowland — can thank Hollywood esthetician Shani Darden for their glowing red carpet complexions. Now, she’s made her facials accessible to those who can perhaps only experience award show season on the big screen, with none other than the Triple Acid Signature Peel. It’s a two-step regimen that rids skin of dead cells through the powers of, you guessed it, a trio of acids. In addition, kaolin clay and bentonite clay rid pores of dirt, thereby yielding photogenic radiance. PS: Acne-prone skin will be especially enamored by this Amazon beauty buy.\nEditor testing and review notes: “You should see my skin after I’ve used this face mask: It’s positively glowing. You can feel it working when you apply the first step, then after one minute, a little more intense tingling as you massage on the Kaolin clay mask. I’ll let that sit for 10 minutes, then rinse it off with warm water. My skin always gets a nice flush after I use this mask (not so red that I’m worried about irritation), so I’ll usually follow up with a cooling serum or ice roller for a full at-home spa experience. But the best part is when I wake up the following morning — my pores look tighter, there’s nary a blackhead in sight, and my skin feels and looks impossibly smooth.” — Sullivan\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $125\nSkinMedica TNS Serum\nThis is the serum for you if you’re struggling with fine lines, wrinkles, or dark spots — imperfections every red carpet attendee knows need to be concealed to the max. SkinMedica’s serum contains natural growth factors that help skin cells regenerate rapidly while promoting elasticity and firmness. It’s also good for all skin types and is a gentle formula that works for you, never against you. You heard it here first: Healthy skin is this season’s hottest accessory.\nEditor testing and review notes: “I love a good face serum, but this one has to be one of my top favorites. Is it the cheapest option on the market? No, but it’s one of the most effective — you get what you pay for. SkinMedica, take all my money!” — Mansuroglu\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $280.25\nMighty Patch The Original Pimple Patch\nWaking up with a pimple is like heading to the beach and a thunderstorm rolls through — zits have a way of ruining your day. Need a quick fix? The best pimple patches absorb excess oils, decrease the look of your breakouts, and most importantly, don’t slide off your face. Mighty Patch’s The Original acne patches stay right where you place them, decreasing inflammation and expediting your pimple’s healing process.\nEditor testing and review notes: “Mighty Patch Original patches have duct tape-caliber sticking power. I have dry skin, so I’m always layering on face serums and moisturizers before bed — these stickers stay put, even on top of those skin care products. They’re peerless for purging whiteheads.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “If this product could talk, it would quickly tell Dr.Pimple Popper to ‘hold my beer’ This product is like no other, working quickly to help get rid of the pesky little zits that always pop up at the worst time possible. Wash your face, apply a patch, go to bed and it will be all but gone by morning. My 40 year old self could only have dreamt of something like this back in my teenage years!”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $12.99\nEmbyrolisse Lait-Crème Concentré\nThis iconic French face cream is a staple in makeup artists’ kits for pre-glam skin prep. The lotion, which contains just a few key ingredients like shea butter and aloe, acts like a makeup primer by smoothing out skin and delivering just a touch of tackiness that grabs onto any foundation you apply on top. Because of its simple formula, you can also use it as a hand lotion, body cream, and to smooth out split ends on frazzled hair.\nEditor testing and review notes: “What’s most impressive about Embryolisse Lait-Crème Concentré is the hydration it delivers despite its lightweight feel. It’s this combination that makes it an excellent base for makeup on any skin type: Oily types won’t have to worry about excess grease and dry types won’t need to layer on hydrating serums underneath the cream for smooth makeup application. But it does so much more than prime the skin for makeup: I also use it as a body lotion, hand cream, leave-in conditioner, and even a makeup remover.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “The Embryolisse Lait-Crème Concentré is a skincare game-changer! This versatile face cream and makeup primer has quickly become a staple in my routine. It’s like a magic potion that hydrates, smooths, and preps my skin all in one go. The texture is rich yet lightweight, absorbing beautifully into the skin without leaving any greasiness. It provides a perfect base for makeup, creating a smooth canvas that makes foundation glide on effortlessly and stay put throughout the day. Plus, it adds a subtle glow that makes my skin look naturally radiant.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $14.53\nU Beauty Resurfacing Compound Serum\nWhen a skin care formula promises to do eight things at once, eyebrows get raised, but the U Beauty Resurfacing Compound Serum is a beauty product that’s true to its word. During hectic happenings (read: red carpets), all one really wants is simplicity. Given the fact that this multihyphenate serum replaces your toner, Vitamin C and E serums, AHA exfoliant, antioxidant complex, retinol, and hyaluronic acid, it’s simplicity incarnate. Built-in retinol and peptides work to promote a more youthful appearance, while blemishes are reduced and uneven texture is resurfaced thanks to a host of other ingredients. U Beauty’s patented technology takes a nitty-gritty approach, targeting precisely the areas of the face most susceptible to free radicals. In short order, they’re neutralized and glass skin — your glass skin! — is the joyous outcome.\nEditor’s testing and review notes: “My dry skin would be a disaster during winter without U Beauty’s Resurfacing Compound. After just a couple of uses, I could see and feel the improvement in my skin’s textures and complexion — a rarity in a heavily saturated skin care market.” — Director of Commerce Adam Mansuroglu\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $148\nTatcha The Dewy Skin Cream\n3,400+ five-star reviews\nNever thought you’d sport Japanese purple rice on your face? There’s a first time for everything. This, after all, is the star ingredient of The Dewy Skin Cream from Tatcha — an anti-aging cream that plumps, hydrates, and locks in moisture for the long run. The best part is that only a pearl-sized dollop is required in the morning and night to achieve luminosity. As far as dewy faces are concerned, a little goes a long way.\nEditor testing and review notes: “Tatcha’s Dewy Skin Cream is a year-round staple I use when my skin is feeling parched, sensitive, or unbalanced in any way. It has a soft, cooling feel when you apply it, and it layers beautifully over other skin care products and under makeup. When I use it consistently, I notice less redness and more radiance.” — Sullivan\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $68.40\nBiodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Masks\n4,000+ five-star reviews\nAfter amassing millions of rave reviews on TikTok in the past few months, Biodance’s collagen sheet masks have taken a coveted spot on Amazon’s beauty bestseller list. These hydrogel sheet masks are soaked in a solution of hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, as well as skin-brightening niacinamide and allantoin. Apply it onto clean skin and relax — after three to four hours, the white mask will turn clear, signaling that your skin has soaked up all of its radiance-boosting ingredients.\nEditor testing and review notes: I’m a side sleeper, so overnight face masks usually aren’t my jam, but Biodance’s adheres so well to my skin that it didn’t disrupt my sleep. In the morning, my skin felt much more hydrated than it typically does with a thick coat of night cream. For the price, this is an excellent sheet mask to have on hand when you want extra beauty rest.” — Sullivan\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $19\nEos Shea Better Body Lotion\nA reliable body lotion is a beauty essential, especially if you’re regularly shaving your legs and catching a lot of sun in the summer. This best-selling vegan lotion from Eos is formulated with luscious shea butter, which infuses rich hydration without feeling heavy on the skin. It promises 24-hour moisture, and comes in a delicious vanilla cashmere fragrance that one WWD Shop editor particularly loved to layer with sweet body sprays in the summer.\nEditor testing and review notes: “I have generally tough skin, but for some reason the skin on my legs is especially sensitive. This body lotion caused zero irritation, and I love it as a summer swap for my typically thick winter moisturizers. It glides on and absorbs so smoothly, and even acts as a great base for applying self tanner on top. It’s a great value for the price — I’ve used it for over two months and I still have plenty of product left to enjoy.” — WWD Shop Commerce Writer & Producer Olivia Cigliano\nWhat testers say: “This lotion is incredible! The consistency is a happy medium of thick, but not too thick, and quickly absorbs! I had really dry skin when I was pregnant and postpartum. I was using other lotion plus coconut oil. When I found this lotion, it helped SO much! Dry, flaky skin is gone and I also noticed my skin is a lot softer! The vanilla smells really good! Will be sticking with this lotion for the foreseeable future!”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $8.98\nWeleda Skin Food Original Ultra-Rich Cream\nWeleda Skin Food is one of the richest — and most effective! — moisturizers for dry, sensitive skin that our editors have tested. The cult-favorite face cream is full of plant-based emollients like sunflower seed oil and sweet almond oil, as well as calming chamomile and calendula extracts. This makes it a great choice for treating irritated skin or sealing in moisture in arid environments, say, if you’re going on a ski trip. A little goes a long way with this cream, and you can use it on split ends, hands, and cuticles, too.\nEditor testing and review notes: “I’ve used this face cream for years. Every time I stray away from it for a few months to try something new, I inevitably come back to Skin Food for its ability to make my skin look dewy and radiant. Because of its thick, balm-like texture, I make sure that I give any face serums I’m wearing a full minute or two to absorb before I follow up with the cream (otherwise, it takes some elbow grease to blend). Some moisturizers only seem to keep skin supple right after you’ve applied them, but this one makes a difference in my overall skin feel and texture after I wear it for a day. Pro tip: Use it in place of liquid highlighters on your cheeks for a believable touch of dewiness.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “I’ve been really happy with this product’s performance. It hydrates dry skin incredibly well, making it feel soft and revitalized. An added benefit is its versatility, it can be applied anywhere on the body. I would definitely recommend it to anyone struggling with dry skin. It’s truly a game changer!”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $14.04\nAugustinus Bader The Rich Cream\nWhen Cynthia Erivo of “Wicked” fame says Augustinus Bader’s The Rich Cream is her go-to for dry skin issues, you run to buy Augustinus Bader’s The Rich Cream. It’s really that simple, especially when considering how effective this cell-renewing moisturizer is. Its magic ingredient is something called Trigger Factor Complex, also known as TFC8 (and if it all sounds scientific, that’s the whole point). The brand’s founder is a biomedical scientist and specialist in stem cell biology who concocted a complex of amino acids and vitamins designed to regenerate the skin on a cellular level. Omega-6 fatty acids, antioxidants, and evening primrose oil also play supporting roles here in soothing skin and fighting free radicals. The result is something A-listers and average Joes alike strive for, subsequently functioning as a great equalizer of sorts: a firmer and smoother complexion.\nEditor testing and review notes: Augustinus Bader’s The Rich Cream is a worthy skin care investment piece that can take the place of many other products. Our testers noticed immediate and long-term benefits. The cream feels luxurious on your skin and layers well with other skin care and makeup products without pilling.\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $190\nNeutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Water Gel Moisturizer\n#5 Amazon Bestseller in Face Moisturizers\nIt’s rare to find an ultra-hydrating moisturizer that’s lightweight and oil-free at an affordable price point. But Neutrogena does it all with their best-selling water gel. It’s infused with hyaluronic acid which binds with water molecules to draw moisture in the skin. It’s specially formulated for dry skin, but it’s suitable for oily and combination skin too, thanks to its oil-free formulation.\nEditor testing and review notes: “This moisturizer gives my skin an instant boost of hydration. It absorbs so quickly and makes for an ideal makeup base in the mornings — and is especially lightweight in hot weather. I love applying it fresh out of the shower after applying a face serum.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “I have combination skin and this moisturizer works so so well. My T-zone is really oily. The rest of my face sometimes gets so dry it flakes, and the moisturizer I was using would then burn (my skin is sensitive). This stuff never burns, at all. It’s sort of gel-like and a little goes a long way so it will last a lot longer than you’d think. I lightly dab one finger in it and it’s enough for my whole face. It leaves my skin so soft and moisturized without making my T-zone oily. Definitely recommend.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $17.95\nSt. Tropez Self Tan Express Mousse\nKelsea Ballerini was positively shining at the 2025 Grammy Awards, and the cult-favorite St. Tropez Self Tan Express Mousse is to thank for that. Considered one of the very best self-tanners in the industry, the mousse grants a natural, sun-kissed look even during the gloomiest of winter seasons and can be used to achieve three customizable tan depth options based on how long you set it for. Celebrity makeup artist Kelsey Deenihan worked with Ballerini for this year’s Grammys, and she used the St. Tropez Luxe Velvet Applicator Mitt (only $9!) to apply the mousse in circular, even motions. Deenihan let the self-tanner develop on her client’s skin for two hours — after which a quick rinse reveled a bronzed look of medium intensity that still has everyone talking. Psst… St. Tropez recommends exfoliating and moisturizing the skin before application to ensure your tan lasts as long as possible.\nWhat testers say: “As someone with naturally pale skin who struggles to tan, even during the summer, finding a reliable self-tanner has been a game-changer for me. One of the standout features of this self-tanner is the scent. Unlike many other tanners that have an overpowering chemical smell, St. Tropez has a pleasant, subtle fragrance that’s easy on the senses. The application process is a breeze — the formula spreads evenly, dries quickly within minutes, and leaves no sticky residue.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $46\nKate Somerville Exfolikate Intensive Exfoliating Treatment\nThis clean and green exfoliating treatment from Kate Somerville is one of the Greatest Skin Care Products of All Time, according to WWD, for its nourishing formula that sloughs off dry skin and leaves the complexion naturally radiant. Suitable for all skin types, it features gentle, plant-based exfoliants like papaya, pineapple, and pumpkin enzymes, along with a long list of healthy hydrators including aloe vera, honey, vitamin E, and lactic and salicylic acids that work to brighten dull skin.\nEditor testing and review notes: “When my skin gets extra dull and lifeless, this is the first product I reach for. I love that it has a little bit of texture to it (you can feel it working) and that it doesn’t leave my skin feeling stripped.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “I found my holy grail of skin care product. This scrub is so effective in resurfacing and exfoliation. When combined with my retinol cream, I get amazing results. My skin is firmer and looks more taut. I’m 64 and have combination skin. My skin looks amazing for my age and I get compliments on it. I ordered the smaller one to see if I like it and I will be ordering the larger one next time. It only takes a small amount of product so I think it will last a long time. Yes, it’s not cheap, but you get what you pay for in this case.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $49.77\nMario Badescu Hyaluronic Eye Cream\n2,500+ five-star reviews\nIn the universe of beauty, Mario Badescu needs no introduction. The Romanian-born chemist and pharmacist moved to New York City in 1966 with a calling and a talent — launching a facial studio in Manhattan that has since grown to be one of the hottest, if-you-know-you-know spots in the city. Martha Stewart, for one, is a fan, and celebs from Jessica Chastain to Gwyneth Paltrow are fond of the Mario Badescu brand as a whole.

Skin Holy Hydration Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm relieves the effort and waste of traditional makeup wipes. The waxy, water-activated balm magically dissolves a full face of makeup in under a minute, leaving behind impressive hydration and a squeaky-clean glow.\nEditor testing and review notes: “I was skeptical to try this product, as I typically prefer a Makeup Eraser cloth to remove my beat at the end of the day. Long story short, it’s made its way into my nightly skin care routine. The first thing I noticed upon testing is that a small amount aptly addressed my entire face, so you get a great value that’ll last you months of daily use.

Try this innovative clear gel formula from Supergoop!, which acts as a makeup primer, too, imparting a velvety finish. The broad-spectrum SPF 40 face sunscreen not only protects from both UVA and UVB rays, but also blue light emitted from phones and computers. “It leaves absolutely no trace on the skin and is really comfortable to wear, one reviewer writes. “I love that it smooths out my skin texture and provides a slight glow, so it’s great as a primer as well. Definitely recommend getting this, it’s worth the hype.”\nEditor testing and review notes: “This is the sunscreen for people who hate sunscreen.

That’s where this hydrating toner from Laneige comes in. Known for their viral lip mask, this brand’s formulas are made for combating skin that needs some TLC. The Cream Skin Toner and Moisturizer is packed with ceramides and peptides that help draw moisture into the skin. Dry skin types can layer a hydrating face serum on top for a one-two punch of moisture.\nEditor testing and review notes: “A skin care secret I abide by for dewy skin that lasts all day is a hydrating toner: These watery products multiply the moisture my skin gets from my favorite hyaluronic acid serums (hyaluronic acid can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water, so applying them on damp skin is ideal). Laneige’s Cream Skin Toner & Moisturizer is a dream for my dry, dull skin. It’s the first step in my morning skin care routine; I shake a few drops onto a cotton pad that I stamp all over my skin. Even if you’re on the oily side, you can still cycle this in for softening benefits — it doesn’t cause excess shine or a greasy feeling.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “Finally, I found what I was looking for! I was initially looking for a serum, but this treatment is perfect for dry skin! It does exactly what I was looking for! It moisturizes but doesn’t feel sticky afterward; it makes my skin feel wonderful! It gives me the moisture boost I need without being overly heavy or overly matte.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $36\nBio-Oil Skincare Body Oil\nBio-Oil has earned over 75,000 five-star ratings on Amazon and quickly became a favorite among editors and celebrities. Why? The oil is said to be a miracle worker for reducing the appearance of scars — from acne to surgery — in weeks. The oil has a light texture that melts into the skin and doesn’t leave a greasy finish behind. And it’s easy to use: Take a few drops into your palms, rub your hands together, then apply to scars.\nEditor testing and review notes: “I used Bio-Oil to help repair a scar from a surgery, and after a solid four or five months of consistent use, I began to see a visible improvement in my scar’s color tone. It went from a bright pink into a dulled down, more subtle, blush hue that started to blend in with my skin, rather than scream for attention the way it did previously. That subtle change in coloring was all I needed to keep up the momentum, and I’ve continued to use the oil twice daily, with a few exceptions — like when Amazon ran out of stock — ever since.”\nWhat testers say: “Honestly, I knew Bio oil about eight to nine years ago. I did not use it for a while. Recently, I just used it again for about two weeks, and I have been in love again. My acne scars have been improved and gotten much better. I am such a lazy skincare person, but this Bio Oil helps me to be easier about skincare. My skincare is now just as simple as four steps: Face wash, Toner, Bio Oil, and facial cream.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $11.12\nSunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment\nSunday Riley has risen to skin care stardom courtesy of the brand’s ingredient-rich formulas. This lactic acid face serum hydrates your skin while exfoliating. You’ll notice smoother feeling skin overnight, and with consistent use, you’ll see a noticeable difference in the brightness and texture of your skin.\nEditor testing and review notes: “Few chemical exfoliators feel hydrating to your skin; most of them leave you on the dry side. This serum, on the other hand, is immensely moisturizing. It’s a one-and-done step that banishes dullness.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “This is my second bottle of this product and it has made it into my permanent rotation of daily face products. The price point is a little high but worth it. In just a few minutes my skin can go from lackluster and dull to having looked like I just got eight hours of sleep and a mini facial. I pair it with the brand’s C.E.O 15% vitamin C serum. Despite having tried many different products, I keep coming back to those 2 products from Sunday Riley.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $80.75\nElizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream\nEver wanted to own a beauty product that considered Queen Elizabeth II among its loyal fan base, as well as more royals like Princess Diana and Prince Harry?

This is a wonder product through and through, one that just might grace your bathroom cabinet for a whole lifetime.\nEditor testing and review notes: “This do-it-all salve is a classic for a reason; it has more uses than I can count on both hands. My favorite way to use it is as a face mask on top of a hydrating serum — slather that combo on before bed, and you’ll wake up with supple, glowing skin. I’ll also use it on split ends and to smooth back flyaways.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “Finally tried this time-tested beauty staple after reading about its various uses and efficacy for years. Very glad I took the plunge. Although it is a bit pricey, this product is a solid add-on to my skin care routine, especially in the drier winter months. I use it daily as a very thin coating on my face before I head outside, over sunblock and moisturizer; it’s fabulous on lips, hands, and cuticles, too, and gives my skin a subtle sheen and faint glow… I’m delighted I made the decision to try this item; it’s one of my go-to products now!\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $33.25\nAcure Brightening Facial Scrub\nNo skin care routine is complete without a weekly exfoliator to slough off dead skin and achieve a deep clean. Acure’s Brightening Facial Scrub is a bestseller for its gently and natural formulation of detoxifying sea kelp, refreshing lemon peel, brightening Madonna lily, and purifying French green clay.\nEditor testing and review notes: “For years I was under the impression that I’ve discovered a hidden gem — but little did I know that this scrub was an all-star among beauty lovers on Amazon. It’s my go-to when my skin’s looking tired and dull. It applies gently, but not too gently where it feels like it’s barely scraping the surface, and leaves my skin feeling so smooth and looking bright. I often mix it with my favorite face cleaner when I want a more gentle exfoliation, too.” — Cigliano\nWhat testers say: “I’ve been using this for about 6 months and it really does an excellent job of exfoliating my skin without irritating it. I have very sensitive skin and this does not cause any reactions at all. After I use it, I get a rosy glow to my skin. I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking to up their skin care regimen.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $10.99\nMario Badescu Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rose Water\n#4 Amazon Bestseller in Face Mists\nWith over 295 million views on TikTok, Mario Badescu’s face mists are one of the most viral beauty products.

Not only is it a necessity for keeping my skin (and myself) feel fresh during a road trip, but it also multitasks as a toner and makeup refresher once I’ve arrived at my destination.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “I have used so many hydrating sprays that I’ve lost count, but this one is a keeper. I bought it on Prime Day figuring that if I didn’t like it I wouldn’t be out much money, but I never expected to love it as I do! It has a very light scent to it that doesn’t bother me at all and it really hydrates and preps my skin for my morning regime as well as my nighttime routine.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $9.31\nLawless Forget the Filler Overnight Lip Mask\nLawless Beauty makes one of the best lip masks on the market if you’re after a fuller-looking smile.

The Candy Apple shade is pretty enough to wear in place of lip gloss.\nEditor testing and review notes: “I love to layer on a coat of this lip mask over lip liner for a full, moisturized smile. Although it’s plumping, it doesn’t irritate or dry out my lips — instead, it leaves them look fuller and softer.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “This stuff is so amazing! Keeps your lips moisturized with a plumping effect! Doesn’t burn at all! Smells amazing!”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $22\nCeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser\nCeraVe’s Hydrating Facial Cleanser is a smooth, sensitive skin-friendly gel that actively removes dirt and impurities from the skin for squeaky-clean skin.

When my skin is on the fritz, I go with this hydrating cleanser from CeraVe. One pump is plenty to remove my makeup and get rid of city grime without making my skin sting or turn red.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “This is the best hydrating cleanser I have found for the price! It doesn’t contain any fragrance and doesn’t leave your skin feeling tight. I enjoy that it has hyaluronic acid plus it is approved by the national eczema association which is a huge bonus for my dry/sensitive skin.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $13.29\nPeter Thomas Roth Cucumber De-Tox Hydra-Gel Eye Patches\nThe best sheet masks target skin concerns in a matter of minutes.

Peter Thomas Roth’s Cucumber De-Tox Hydra-Gel Eye Patches wake up tired under eyes with refreshing cucumber and aloe. And they’re safe for sensitive skin.\nEditor testing and review notes: “Puffy, dry under-eye skin is no match for these cool and calming gel patches. If I’ve had a rough week — or a long night of drinking with little-to-no sleep — I’ll place these bad boys on while getting dress for work and no one will be able to tell by the time I arrive at the office. Plus, they’re fun to use for a night of self-care at home.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “I will admit these are a bit pricey, but I’m happy to report it’s because they actually work. I’ve tried so many under eye patches and most of them burn my skin, but these don’t do that. They feel great and I can genuinely see a difference when I remove them. I will never go back to anything else!”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $55\nPaula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant\n#1 Amazon Bestseller in Facial Peels\nAny product by Paula’s Choice is worth its weight in gold, but this best-selling, viral liquid BHA face exfoliant is at a whole different level. Beta hydroxy acid (BHA and also known as salicylic acid) is the one-size-fits-all solution to unclogging and clearing pores, making it the perfect for treating blackheads and acne. Yet rather than scorching the surface of the skin like most exfoliants, this formula is still gentle and non-abrasive, and it can also help with the overall appearance of redness, enlarged pores and fine lines.\nEditor testing and review notes: “If you’re looking to exfoliate your skin without roughing it up, this is the product you need in your routine. It’s particularly great for combination skin types; it has a way of tamping down oiliness without exacerbating dry spots.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “This has been amazing for my skin! It’s been years since I’ve been willing to take pictures without a filter because of my huge pores, blackheads and blemishes. I’ve only been using this for a week and my pores have already gotten so much smaller, my skin clearer and it’s even glowing! I’m no longer afraid to take pictures without filters. I do have to say that it does definitely make your skin more sensitive so if you are using it during the day, make sure you moisturize with something with SPF. And at night, also follow up with something that keeps your skin moisturized.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $13.30\nHigherdose Red Light Face Mask\nHigherdose has long been loved for their infrared sauna blanket. Their LED face mask is equally high quality — it delivers a safe amount of red and near infrared light. Use it for a minimum of 10 minutes three to five times per week, and you can expect to see an improvement in tone and fewer fine lines.\nEditor testing and review notes: “Some LED face masks require you to sit still and close your eyes during your sesh. This one is made with flexible silicone and features straps that hold the mask close to your face — and it’s cordless — so you can move around while you’re using it.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “’I have had the mask for over a week and can already see a huge improvement in my skin! I love that it is so easy to use and doesn’t need to be plugged into the wall when using. I have even taken a bath with it — talk about relaxation! This is now a part of my nightly routine.

It’s filled with ceramides and niacinamide to smooth and hydrate skin, and it also contains SPF 40 to protect against harmful UV rays.\nEditor testing and review notes: “I’m a firm believer in wearing SPF daily, but not at the expense of adding more time to my morning routine. I’m embarrassed to say that as a beauty writer, I would forget to apply protection to my skin too often, but this product makes it so easy to get at least one dose in. I love the creamy texture that’s easy to blend. It never leaves a white cast, and doesn’t break out my acne-prone skin. It hydrates my complexion without leaving a greasy finish behind, which makes it perfect for layering makeup on top.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “I decided that I’d give this stuff a go. GAME CHANGER! It smells nice, isn’t heavy, and has a very minimal white cast (and that’s only if you use a ton; which you won’t because a little goes a long way!) Now remember I said I was a sun-loving kid and lived through the “baby oil is the best sunblock,” so I have some dark spots, little lines, discolorations, etc., literally everything stereotypical of my generation. (Ha!) Well, not anymore! I am completely serious when I say my dark spots are almost completely invisible; lines look smoother — the whole deal!”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $23.99\nSol de Janeiro Brazilian Crush Cheirosa 68 Body Mist\nSummer calls for a lightweight swap from heavy fragrances to lightweight body spray spritzes. Sol de Janeiro does it best — especially in this editor-loved scent that emits a fruity and floral aroma for daytime wear, with top notes of pink dragonfruit and lychee essence, Brazilian jasmine, ocean air, hibiscus, and musk. It’s earned over 30,000 five-star Amazon reviews, with one shopper saying it smells clean with a “sunshine feel.” One bottle will last you all summer long, but we wouldn’t blame you for stocking up on the entire scent collection for a winning summer rotation.\nEditor testing and review notes: “A little goes a long way with Sol de Janeiro’s body mists — particularly this potent, fruity floral fragrance that smells like a summer date night. Like most body sprays from the brand, it veers sweet (but not saccharine).” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “This scent smells good and lasts a long time! I could still smell a hint of it on my shirt a day or two later and I didn’t use much. I bought it without smelling it in-store since my stores don’t carry it and the scent descriptions sounded nice. It smells like a nice floral vanilla. My first of this brand’s scents and hope to find another I like as well.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $25\nLa Roche Posay Hyalu B5 Pure Hyaluronic Acid Face Serum\nWWD Shop editors and dermatologists alike deem the La Roche Posay Hyalu B5 Pure Hyaluronic Acid Face Serum one of the best hydrating serums money can buy.

It can be used by itself or mixed with a moisturizer for a double-dose of healthy hydration.\nEditor testing and review notes: “La Roche-Posay’s hyaluronic acid serum is one of the products I always recommend to friends that are looking for a great hydrating face serum that won’t break the bank. It makes my skin look like I’m wearing a luminous makeup primer or expertly-placed highlighter. The dewy look is excellent for reviving tired-looking skin, and I love how well this formula layers under other moisturizers and makeup.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “Most of my life I thought anti-aging products were a scam — well this stuff works! I notice with continued use, my skin is more resilient to weather conditions (hot or cold), and I hope La-Roche Posay always makes it. Like with most good things, a little goes a long way. I have pretty sensitive skin, and can easily have reactions to products or food, but this one works amazingly for me.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $39.99\nSol de Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Body Cream\nSol de Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Body Cream is a rich body cream with smoothing ingredients such as antioxidant-rich açaí oil, moisturizing cupucaçu butter, and caffeinated guarana for a temporary tightening effect.

This product is loaded with vitamins to nourish hair on a cellular level, leaves no residue, and extends time between washes. To add to its case, the dry shampoo also costs less than $30 (!!).\nEditor testing and review notes: One editor on the WWD Shop team uses this product whenever her strands need a refresh but there’s no time for an actual, thorough wash.

Each of these sets comes with four attachments that swiftly dry and style your hair in loose ringlets and voluminous waves. The FlexStyle also functions like a high-powered blow dryer. Some hair tools claim they can replace all of your straighteners, curling irons, and hair dryers — the FlexStyle actually can.\nEditor testing and review notes: “Shark’s FlexStyle is in a league of its own; there’s no other tool on the market that works as well as a multipurpose styler as it does a classic hair dryer. The only downside to this tool is potential snagging of hair where the attachments meet the nozzle, and the weight that some of the attachments add to the device.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “I have never been great at styling my hair —I just never really got the hang of it. This is so easy to use! I love how it looks from freshly curled to how it relaxes over the next hours and days.

This duo from L’Oreal is a godsend for my color-treated hair when it’s feeling particularly brittle or dry. I love the price tag — and that it prevents my fresh dye from fading.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “I’ve used professional products for years and never has my hair felt and looked so good after just one use. My hair is softer, smells great, and it even seems to tame some of my flyaways. It does have a perfume-y smell, but I actually like it. It left my bathroom smelling divine. Impressed is an understatement! Will be purchasing a bigger bottle next time. The hype was worth it!”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $17.85\nL’Oréal Professionnel AirLight Pro Hair Dryer\nSabrina Carpenter channeled true Old Hollywood glamour on the 67th Grammy Awards red carpet, in no small part due to her bouncy curls and perfectly styled bangs (created by stylist Evanie Frausto). The tool that made this possible? Why, it’s the new AirLight Pro Hair Dryer from L’Oréal and Zuvi, which also managed to transform our Senior Commerce Writer Stacia Datskovska’s frizzy strands into big, defined, and hydrated curls. The AirLight Pro is innovation at its finest: cutting back on drying time through the use of infrared light, offering concentrator or diffuser options with corresponding attachments, and coming with a compatible app that unlocks a range of personalized settings. The dryer’s wind power, too, is one that just might sweep you off your feet — securing results you’ll brag to all your friends about.\nEditor testing and review notes: “The L’Oréal Professionnel AirLight Pro Hair Dryer is an absolute miracle for those winter days when you don’t want to step out in the cold with semi-dried hair. It provides mighty airflow, easy-to-regulate temperature controls, and a wide range of settings to fit your hair type. While downloading the compatible app is not a must, this will definitely unlock even more personalization and options (like pro modes for hair that’s colored, bleached, thinning, thick, and beyond). The only downside to this hair tool is that it needs to be used in conjunction with hydrating cream for best results, especially on curly hair prone to frizz.” — Datskovksa\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $475\nBed Head Tourmaline Wave Artist Deep Waver\nFeatured on Alix Earle’s Amazon Storefront, this stellar hair waver hot tool from Bed Head brings the beach to your ‘do in just a few minutes. Its coated with tourmaline ceramic technology to fight frizz and add healthy shine as you style. The waver heats up to 400 degrees to apply a deep, soft kink in your mane — mermaid-style.\nEditor testing and review notes: “When I want to do my hair for an event but can’t decide on a style, this tool is my go-to. I love it because it heats up quickly and I can run out the door with a mane of tousled, voluminous waves in under 10 minutes. The style lasts all day without hairspray and I always love how naturally wavy my hair looks on the second day.” — Cigliano\nWhat testers say: “Easy to use, leaves my hair soft, and I end up looking effortlessly nice. The waves hold for days, too! Very happy with this product!”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $23.62\nOribe Dry Texturizing Spray\n6,300+ five-star reviews\nOribe stans could wax poetic about the magic that is this product. Oribe’s Dry Texturizing Spray is a versatile hero product that gives hair instant, natural-looking (or mega, if that’s what you want) volume while absorbing excess oil for a perfectly tousled finish. What’s especially great about this spray is that you can go as subtle or dramatic as you’d like. If you’re just looking for a little more lift and a little less shine, a quick shot will do the trick. If you’re wanting supermodel hair vibes, just spray with abandon.\nEditor testing and review notes: “I’d use this product even if it didn’t do anything just because it smells so divine. But in this imperfect world, Oribe, the celebrity stylist known for his more-is-more approach to life, created a perfect product that is part dry shampoo-part texturizer that just makes hair look playful and live. I always have a mini on hand in my makeup pouch.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “My hair is fine and needs body. This adds volume without adding stickiness or a stiff, wet look. Already recommended to several friends. Definitely will purchase again.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $52\nK18 Leave-In Molecular Repair Mask\nIf your tired strands are in need of a serious pick-me-up, K18’s hair mask is one of the best on the market for revitalizing damaged hair. This vegan formula comes super saturated with hair-loving ingredients that shoppers, hair stylists, and WWD Shop editors deem transformative, including smoothing and hydrating peptides and bond-repairing properties that bring elasticity back into your mane. It’s suitable for all hair types, and can be applied from the roots to the ends as a leave-in conditioner. Pro tip: If you’re slicking your hair into an updo, use this instead of hair gel as an all-day mask for maximum benefits.\nEditor testing and review notes: “I was first introduced to K18’s hair mask long before it went viral on TikTok. In 2020, a hairstylist recommended it to me to repair visible damage on my hair after a few balayage sessions and frequent use of hot tools. This mask has been a part of my routine since — it’s the only hair product that seems to seal split ends and make my hair feel stronger despite everyday styling with a flat iron and hair dryer. It’s also so easy to use, as it’s a leave-in mask you can apply right after shampooing in place of conditioner.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “My hair stylist recommended this product for my hair and it was such a super product to anything else I have used. It is expensive and I have long hair so it is doubly expensive, but so worth it!! As I aged my hair became really frizzy and dry, but this product changed everything, leaving my hair so manageable, silky, soft, and no frizz. I cannot say enough good things about K18.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $29\nGhd Platinum+ Hair Straightener\nGhd’s Platinum+ Styler is one of the best hair straighteners on the market for its practical 1-inch plate size that gets close to the roots and completely smooths strands in just a few passes. It has a temperature limit of 365 degrees Farenheit, which helps to prevent damaging hot spots, and its curved edges make curling, flipping, and creating various styles especially effortless.\nEditor testing and review notes: “Ghd’s flat iron outperformed every other straightener during our extensive flat iron testing. From the jump, this iron heats up in under 30 seconds with the click of one button (its preset temperature takes out the guesswork of landing on the right temp). The plates glide over curls and soft waves to straighten them without causing steam or sizzling, and it’s the best straightener I tested that works to create soft curls — simply twist the iron as you move it from the mid-length of your hair down to the ends. My curly hair typically requires multiple passes for a smooth, straight look, but just one does the trick with this tool.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “I love this hair straightening product! I am very happy with my purchase. Definitely worth the price! My hair looks so silky and straight. I have frizzy hair and none of the other straighteners I have bought before were able to tame my hair like this one, so I’m definitely in love with this product.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $279\nTop Makeup Products on Amazon\nLancôme Lash Idôle Flutter Extension Mascara\nAt the 67th Grammy Awards, Olivia Rodrigo stunned in a Versace-powered, all-black ensemble, with extra-long, dramatic lashes to match. As Lancôme’s newest Global Brand Ambassador, Rodrigo took advantage of one of the brand’s latest product releases — the Lancôme Lash Idôle Flutter Extension Mascara. Resistant to clumping and flaking, it provides a lash length increase of up to 75 percent (which stays visible for close to 24 hours). What’s more, the mascara features Lancôme’s tiniest brush yet: boasting over 480 nano-bristles that separate and define every last lash. Glamorous eyes are just a purchase away.\nEditor testing and review notes: “For me, waterproof mascaras are hard to take off at the end of the day and non-waterproof ones tend to look clumpy or stain my lids after any sudden movement of the eyes. The Lancôme Lash Idôle Flutter Extension Mascara, however, has none of these flaws. It’s an incredibly lightweight formula that nonetheless gives impressive length and doesn’t require re-application as I go about my daily routine. In a nutshell, it’s chef’s kiss.” — Datskovska\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $30\nE.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter\nThis breakout star product from E.l.f. is one of the most unique complexion products on the market. It’s not quite a foundation, nor a highlighter, or even a makeup primer — it’s all of the above. This product deposits minimal coverage that can be worn under foundation as dewy layer, as a a tone-smoothing complexion base under spot concealing, or over makeup for added shine at the high points of the face. Its formulation blends finely milled powders for a blurring effect, while hyaluronic acid and squalane provide a healthy, hydrated glow.\nEditor testing and review notes: “As someone who doesn’t like to wear heavy foundation but likes to even out my skin tone, I love this product. It feels super lightweight and moisturizing, and, when used alone, looks super natural and allows for my freckles to shine through. The large doe foot applicator is amazing for clean and controlled coverage, and its glass bottle feels super luxe for a drugstore foundation.” — Cigliano\nWhat testers say: “Wow — it took me way too long to try this! I am 35 with dry and sensitive skin and this stuff makes my face look so smooth and glowy, without appearing glittery. It can most definitely be worn alone. It’s a glorious dupe for similar pricey options and just a must-have in your make up or skin care routine.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $11.39\nTirtir Mask Fit Red Cushion Foundation\nBehold, Amazon’s most popular foundation to date. Amazon, in fact, is one of the only retailers in the United States where you can shop the full range of foundation shades — which recently expanded for darker complexions, as demonstrated by TikTok beauty creator @beingcrystalnicolee. The Korean-made cushion foundation wows beauty lovers with buildable full coverage and an impressively smooth skin finish. Made with soothing ingredients you’d expect from a prestige foundation, it offers a lightweight, hydrated feel atop the skin and takes the muss and fuss out of application with a handy powder puff.\nEditor testing and review notes: “As a a gal who usually wears $60 foundation, Tirtir’s foundation was an unexpected hit. The compact has everything you need for on-the-go application, including a powder puff and built-in mirror, but it’s the formula itself that blew us away. It has a skin-like, demi-matte finish that can be layered for full coverage or blended out for a more translucent, barely-there effect.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “I absolutely LOVE this foundation!! You have no idea how wonderful it is to FINALLY find an affordable foundation that matches my skin tone PERFECTLY. As a woman of a certain age (let’s leave it at that!) my only choices when I first started wearing makeup were the only department store foundation made exclusively for Black women (before there was ever Fenty) or settle for weird-looking drugstore foundation matches. Who would have thought it would be a South Korean makeup company that would finally match my skin tone all these years later?”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $17.50\nEssence Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara\n#1 Amazon Bestseller in Mascara\nEssence’s Lash Princess False Lash Mascara has been a TikTok beauty favorite for years because it creates a super dramatic lash effect for an affordable $5 price tag. #EssenceMascara has 211 million views on TikTok, with users raving about their lashes. And this top mascara has also earned a whopping 25000 five-star reviews on Amazon. The product promises to define and separate lashes for sculpted length and volume without any clumps. Ditch the falsies — this is one of the best mascaras on the market.\nEditor testing and review notes: “I strive for my lashes to look super dark, thick, and long, and this mascara surpasses prestige products I’ve tried in the past. The conic wand shape really helps you coat each little lash and the formula is effortlessly buildable. In the summer, I switch to the waterproof version for maximum staying power.” — Cigliano\nWhat testers say: “I’ve tried a lot of mascaras of all price ranges. Essence Lash Princess is by far the best mascara I’ve ever used! It separates the lashes, makes them fuller, and I’ve had so many people ask if my eyelashes were fake while using this product. The price point is amazing for the quality you get! I’ll never use another mascara again.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $4.99\nHourglass Vanish Airbrush Concealer\nIt’s safe to say that Gracie Abrams absolutely glowed on the Grammys red carpet this year, looking like an ethereal bride with perfect skin. Her airbrushed look was created by celebrity makeup artist Emily Cheng, who applied the Hourglass Vanish Airbrush Concealer — among other Hourglass bestsellers — to Abrams’s face, in the “Apricot” and “Creme” shades. This gem of a product is waterproof, weightless, and promises to brighten the complexion for up to 16 hours. It’s pigmented enough to conceal even the most pesky of fine lines and dark circles; additionally, the concealer is light-reflecting, which makes it ideal for paparazzi camera flashes or simply those produced by your friends’ phones.\nEditor testing and review notes: One WWD Shop editor used this concealer before a big event and is happy to report that it stayed perfectly in place the whole night, covered all imperfections, and provided a final look that rivaled every filter out there.\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $36\nKiko Milano 3D Hydra Lip Gloss\n8,000+ five-star reviews\nAmazon offers a host of drugstore lip glosses, but according to reviewers, Kiko Milano’s formula delivers the best results and value. In 2023 alone, the brand sold over 24,000 tubes of this lip gloss daily. The Kiko Milano 3D Hydra Lip Gloss is available in over 30 shades that range from sheer berry to intensely pigmented pink, offering plenty of options for any skin tone and lip look. It’s hydrating without feeling sticky, and a little goes a long way.\nEditor testing and review notes: “This lip gloss has become a new regular for me — for the price, it has the same result and feel as one of my go-to luxury glosses that goes for $50. The doe foot wand is large enough to quickly coat my lips, but not so large that I have to clean up excess around the borders of my smile. It’s hydrating enough to wear in place of lip balm, too.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “It is the prettiest color with a tiny bit of iridescent sparkle that gives your lips that extra pop, nice smell/taste, silky smooth and not sticky at all… Great by itself, with a little lip liner or over lipstick too. Highly recommend!”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $9.80\nFazit Makeup Patches\n#1 Amazon Bestseller in Body Glitters\nTaylor Swift recently wore these glittery temporary freckles to a Chief’s game as a sparkly accent to her signature bold red lip, which is as good enough of a reason as any to buy it ASAP. Ideal for Halloween, girls’ night out, or a bachelorette party, they apply like a temporary tattoo to leave a smattering of reflective freckles in their wake.\nWhat testers say: “I bought these for a recent music festival and they were perfect! They were really fun and looked great. They also stayed on for 2 days, even with washing my face, so I didn’t have to reapply during the fest. When I went to wash it off with makeup remover, they came off immediately!”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $15.99\nWonderskin Wonder Blading Lip Stain Peel Off Masque\nThis lip product is a viral sensation on TikTok, but it’s not like any other lip stain you’ve tried before. It applies as an opaque purple liquid, which dries in seconds as a peel-off mask. It’s ideal for summer, as its vivid stain lasts entire day’s worth of wear even under lip balms, and can even be used as a no-budge lipliner for natural-looking definition.\nEditor testing and review notes: “Wonderskin’s Wonder Blading Lip Stain Masque’s shades stayed put on my lips for double the time I’ve experienced from similar stains that fade almost instantly when eating, drinking, or swiping lip balm or lip gloss on top. It delivered up to 11 hours of wear time — which is quickly achieved in only one minute of application.” — Cigliano\nWhat testers say: “The Wonderskin Wonder Blading Lip Stain Peel Off Masque is of exceptional quality and delivers on all its promises. The vibrant color lasts all day and the matte finish is stunning. Although the application can be tricky, using cotton swabs to clean up excess and correct the contour makes it much easier. The peel-off process takes some time, but the end result is worth the wait. Compared to other lip stains, this one stands out for its longevity and beautiful finish. I am very impressed and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and beautiful lip stain.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $22\nUrban Decay Face Bond Luminizer\nDoechii took home the “Best Rap Album” trophy at the 2025 Grammys, making her the third female rapper in history to do so. All things considered, she was definitely in the spotlight the whole night and Urban Decay’s Face Bond Luminizer was there every step of the way. Makeup artist Dee Carrion said the following about Doechii’s look in a press release: “I layered the Face Bond Luminizer in ‘High Profile’ and ‘Half Baked’ to add a gorgeous glow on her cheekbones.” This water-resistant liquid highlighter and bronzer (boosted with 3 percent niacinamide, no less) gives skin all the shimmer with none of the smudging. It’s also incredibly versatile — able to be used as a final step to eyeshadow application or as a glow booster for the body when mixed with your favorite lotion. Head-to-toe radiance is on the horizon.\nWhat testers say: “I ordered the Warm Champagne Gold shade, and I’m so happy I did! It imparts a gorgeous subtle shimmer across my skin without being sticky or tacky like some other products I’ve used in the past. This product literally melts into the skin immediately! It leaves a velvety, silky touch with zero residue. I like to mix it with my tinted moisturizer or face cream, as it adds a beautiful golden shimmer that illuminates the skin while looking incredibly natural.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $34\nDrunk Elephant D-Bronzi Bronzing Drops\nWhen creator Alix Earle dropped her makeup routine on TikTok, shoppers honed in on the Drunk Elephant D-Bronzi Bronzing Drops that made Earle’s skin look bronzed in mere seconds. Since then, these golden drops have sold out nearly every time (and at every retailer) they had a restock. Lucky for us, they’re still available on Amazon, so hurry! The drops give skin a kissed-by-the-sun glow, as mentioned above, but they also leave skin hydrated and with a dewy finish that creates a smooth canvas for other face products.\nEditor testing and review notes: “My fair skin tone can quickly look washed out if I’m low on sleep or vitamin D, so I’m always trying new bronzers and face tanners that give my complexion a little warmth. Drunk Elephant’s bronzing drops are a lifesaver when I need to get out of the door in the morning: Rather than taking time to buff and blend bronzer carefully, I just mix these bronzing drops into my moisturizer, and I’ve got a radiant complexion as soon as I’m done smoothing my face cream on. They don’t streak or turn you orange — the formula has the perfect neutral bronze to warm you up.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “I’ve tried all bronzing drops. Rather than a gradual glow like most drops on the market, four drops of these mixed with my daily moisturizer give me an all-day glow. Love them! Mix with sunscreen and lotion, but be sure to wash your hands after.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $39\nEstée Lauder Double Wear Matte Foundation\nIf there’s an unofficial icon of the liquid foundation world, it’s the Estée Lauder Double Wear Matte Foundation, which we dubbed “best full-coverage foundation” in our roundup of the very best foundations for every skin type. Since launching in 1997, this matte formula (with no shortage of available colors) has been subtly gracing every major red carpet event. Its superpower is being incredibly resilient and high-coverage — able to mask even the most significant discoloration, without ever appearing cakey. Is this a miracle product? We think yes.\nEditor testing and review notes: “The lightweight liquid formula blends into the skin seamlessly, and conceals any dark spots and uneven skin tone. It also helps to dismiss the appearance of larger pores. Additionally, I appreciate the matte finish and oil control, which keeps my skin looking fresh all day.” — Sullivan\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $52\nUrban Decay All Nighter Hydrating Hyaluronic Acid Dewy Setting Spray\nThis hydrating twist on a beauty cult-favorite doubles as a dewy finishing spray and locked-in setting spray in one. Formulated with skin-brightening watermelon acid and quenching hyaluronic acid, it can be used as a refreshing facial spray for bare face days, but one editor confirms that it can be trusted to hold makeup in place through sweat and humidity, too. It’s best for dry skin or those looking for a particularly glowy finish — if you’re oily, check out to the All Nighter Ultra Matte formulation instead.\nEditor testing and review notes: “Urban Decay’s classic setting spray was my go-to choice during college — and I consider this a grown-up version of the OG. With this setting spray, you can expect the same powerful hold as the original, but with more of a dewy finish. As someone with dry skin, many setting sprays tend to make my skin feel more parched, but this one does the opposite. It’s so refreshing that I often use it as a moisture-boosting face mist.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “The packaging is super fun and cute and it smells so delicious! The spray comes out nicely and applies evenly to the skin. It makes my skin feel pretty hydrated and a little glowy as well which I love. It keeps my makeup in place and I use it sometimes throughout the day for some extra hydration.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $36\nHourglass Unreal Liquid Blush\nA rosy cheek has been the staple of many red carpet attendees since time immemorial, though it seems like powder blush is becoming eclipsed by its hotter, cooler, liquid cousin. The Hourglass Unreal Liquid Blush is infused with a special formula that not only plumps and firms but also lifts skin. That’s not to mention the blush’s color, which looks just as vibrant as you want it to for up to 12 hours. The colorway offerings here span from Warm Coral to Warm Peach Beige, perfect for every complexion and preference under the sun (err, the red carpet spotlights).\nWhat testers say: “It is a beautiful product, you need one tiny drop, used it on my lips too and loved it.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $36\nJulep 101 Crème to Powder Waterproof Eyeshadow Stick\nA quick swipe of the creamy Julep Eyeshadow Stick brings instant dimension to the eyes and cuts down on pesky blending time. It’s the top-selling eyeshadow on Amazon, with 30,000 perfect reviews for its effortless application and creaseless wear. Formulated with nourishing antioxidants, vitamins C and E, and smooth-gliding candelilla wax on one end, with a convenient smudging tool on the other, it’s the ultimate glam-and-go product when you’re in no mood to fuss with powders.\nWhat testers say: “This goes on so smoothly and stays where I want it. The color is very pretty and flattering. I am almost 70 year old and have hooded eyelids, and this camouflages the eyelids and gives me confidence to be seen.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $16\nUrban Decay 24/7 Moondust Glitter Eyeshadow\nClassic red carpet makeup looks are known to bring all the sparkle, and this buildable eyeshadow just might be the exact dictionary definition of the word “iridescent.” Offered in five shades ranging from pink to metallic brown to champagne gold, this awards ceremony essential is also vegan and lasts for up to 16 hours. You’ll be out the door and ready for the night of your life in no time — without worrying about whether or not your shimmery makeup will last (hint: It will).\nWhat testers say: “Not only is urban decay one of my favorite brands for making a statement, but this eyeshadow is phenomenal. I had been eyeing it for quite a while, but made the jump when it went on sale during the holiday. The shimmer is amazing. It has almost a wet glitter look. Girlies, this is WORTH THE PURCHASE.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $24\nL’Oréal Paris Makeup True Match Lumi Glotion\n#1 Amazon Bestseller in Face Highlighters & Luminizers\nThis liquid face and body luminizer from L’Oréal Paris is a must-have if you love an all-over natural glow. It’s infused with glycerin and shea butter for a long-lasting hydration, whether you apply the product directly to your legs for a sun-kissed sheen or combine it with moisturizer as a glow-enhancing lotion. Drops of the True Match Lumi Glotion may also be mixed them with foundation to warm your skin tone for a natural halo glow, or applied over makeup at the high points of the face as a luminizing face highlighter.\nEditor testing and review notes: “If you love to start your makeup routine with a gleaming base, this lotion is a foolproof choice. It’s budget friendly but delivers an identical result to some of the more expensive options on the market. I’ll wear it on bare skin for a little radiance during the summer, and under makeup during wintertime to make my skin look less dull.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “If you’re looking for light coverage and glowing skin, I highly recommend it. I use this as a base layer and then cover with translucent loose setting powder and that’s it! You can also use this alone. It will definitely compliment tanned skin with the extra glow. Great price!”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $13.98\nL’Oreal Paris Voluminous Original Mascara\nFew mascaras remain relevant like L’Oreal Paris’ Voluminous Original Mascara. Since launching in 1991, this matte gray tube has made appearances in the makeup bags of esteemed artists like Mario Dedivanovic. Its classic wand shape slightly tapers to a point to evenly coat the lash line with product, and smoothly extends lashes to a falsies-level length. Not only is the Voluminous Original Mascara one of the best drugstore volumizing mascaras, but it also comes with the added benefit of conditioning ingredients like panthenol and ceramides.\nEditor testing and review notes: “I love how this mascara’s ultra-soft, densely-packed bristles grab lashes without too much handiwork required, and the slim wand makes it simple to target lashes on the inner and outer corners of your lash line. Because the bristles are so dense, we recommend wiggling the wand close to the lash line for an even, fully-fanned out result.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “I’ve been using this product for ages, but this is the first time I purchased it from Amazon. It’s perfect and delivered so quickly! My holy grail!”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $8.98\nIsamaya Wild Star Pressed Pigment Palette\nPart of Amazon’s luxury beauty roster, this bold-and-beautiful pigment palette is the brainchild of Isamaya Ffrench, a makeup artist who worked with Charli XCX for the Met Gala and also treated Rihanna, Madonna, Bella Hadid, and many other stars to her creative powers. Applying the creamy, saturated hues on your lids (there are 12 of them, to be exact) will create a kind of glass-meets-wet-foil effect — perfect “for glamour-obsessed cowgirls and cowboys who dream of sorbet-colored sunsets and rodeo nights,” according to the Isamaya brand. Let that description convince you to push the boundaries a little, with help from this dazzling offering.\nWhat testers say: “Absolutely beautiful colors and love the way it goes on your skin so smoothly. The shimmer in this palette is gorgeous. I am still trying to figure out how to separate the segmented palette from the the base but am excited to do so and reuse the mirror compact box! Brilliant!!!!”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $73.50\nIt Cosmetics Your Skin But Better CC+ Cream\nAn oldie but a goodie, It Cosmetics’ Your Skin But Better CC+ Cream popularized CC creams as an alternative to full-coverage foundations. Along with color-correcting benefits, it also offers SPF protection and functions as a hydrating serum, smoothing primer and moisturizer all in one.\nEditor testing review notes: “I have combination skin that’s speckled with a few post-acne spots. This formula is handy for hydrating my skin where it needs it while camouflaging discoloration. It’s an essential for my five-minute face makeup routine when I need to get out of the door quickly.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “I think the best thing about this CC cream is the coverage it provides without looking cakey. Because it has great coverage, I don’t have to use it as much, which means one tube lasts me a long time. Plus, it has sunscreen which bolsters my daily sunscreen. Really, a great product that surprisingly stays put for most of the day.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $47\nEssie Gel Couture Longwear Nail Polish Kit\nThis best-selling two-in-one kit from Essie covers all your bases. It comes with a pale pink nail polish that sets to a cream finish, along with a super shiny clear top coat. The best part about these polishes is that they’re formulated for longwear, and their glass-like shine is reminiscent of best gel nail polishes at a fraction of the price and processing time. The baby pink is a great year-round neutral to have in your polish collection anyway, and you can use the top coat over any nail polish brand or color for long-lasting claws.\nEditor testing and review notes: “Essie is one of my favorite nail polish brands, so when I saw they offered a gel-like formulation, I jumped on my order. What I love the most about Essie polish formulas is their unique color options, opaque pigment, and ultra-smooth finish. I love this pink for a subtle-yet-polished effect, while the clear coat lives in my purse to top my natural or painted for with extra sealing and shine.” — Cigliano\nWhat testers say: “This is a super flattering color and the application is so easy. And I’m really not great at nails — almost embarrassingly bad. But I actually can do an okay job with this color and formula. I get compliments whenever I wear it. Highly recommend.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $17.10\nNyx Professional Makeup Butter Gloss, Pack of 3\n83,000+ five-star reviews\nIf you look at other color lip glosses on the market, it’s pretty unheard of to purchase three for just $15. This one from Nyx is an Amazon bestseller with over 73,000 five-star ratings, and it comes in a three-pack of pinky nudes that you’re certain to get use out of. It’s one of the best lip products for dry lips, while leaving the lips plush and shiny without feeling sticky.\nEditor testing and review notes: “This is one of those lip products that never leave my purse. Whether I’m on the go in need of hydration, color, or shine, this gloss instantly saves the day. Too many lip balms, lip oils, or other glosses tend to sit atop chapped lips, but this formula really feels like its absorbing into my lips to deposit moisture. I love that it comes in so many colors — which is easy to take advantage of in this bargain bundle.” — Cigliano\nWhat testers say: “This lip gloss surpassed my expectations, especially for the price point. I am always hesitant of lip gloss because I can’t stand to wear a gloss that is thick, sticky, or dry. The Butter Gloss is the opposite of that — it is sleek, just like butter. I love that it comes in so many shades but clear is my favorite because it works over any lipstick. I like to wear it on its own as well. I honestly can’t think of a single critique for it. If you are debating whether or not to purchase, don’t hesitate. Trust me, once you try it you will have it on subscribe and save! It’s definitely luxurious with an affordable price.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $17.97\nTop Beauty Tools and Accessories on Amazon\nSolawave 4-in-1 Radiant Renewal Facial Wand\nUsed by everyone from Reese Witherspoon to Nicole Kidman, the buzzy Solawave 4-in-1 Radiant Renewal Facial Wand legitimately lives up to its hype. Gliding the wand over key areas of the face like the forehead, neck, and under-eyes three times a week for five minutes at a minimum will grant results you’ll surely gush over. Redness is reduced, puffiness is stripped of its power, fine lines and wrinkles are smoothed, and blemishes are escorted out. This tool is thus the perfect primer for a radiant red carpet look, outfit not included.\nWhat testers say: “This wand has been a great addition to my nightly skincare routine. At first, an additional 12 minutes added to my nightly skincare routine seemed a bit daunting for me to commit to. However, once I started using the wand, I quickly fell in love with it! Instead of it being challenging, it became something I looked forward to using each night. The therapeutic warmth, red light therapy, facial massage, & galvanic currents made using the wand feel like an at-home mini spa experience!”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $169\nBs-Mall Makeup Brush Set\n#1 Amazon Bestseller in Makeup Brush Sets & Kits\nWhether you’re a makeup beginner looking to build your kit, or your brush collection is in need of a serious overhaul, the best-selling Bs-Mall Makeup Brush Set has every single brush you need — from buffing foundation brushes, fluffy blush and bronzer brushes, and even an assortment of eyeshadow brushes for precise detailing. It comes in a luxe-feeling travel case too, so you can easily pack them in your suitcase without risking any damage, or use it as a brush cup at your vanity.\nEditor testing and review notes: “I have an extensive collection of makeup brushes from drugstore to prestige brands, so I’m a picky product tester when it comes to this category. For the price, Bs-mall’s makeup brush set is pretty great value. The brushes have a nice density to them that allows me to work with liquid and powder makeup with ease, and the handles hold up well to regular use. A sparse bristle or two may fall out when you clean them, but otherwise they’re great for daily use.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “I recently purchased the BS-MALL Makeup Brush Set, and I couldn’t be happier with my decision! This 18-piece set includes all the essential brushes I need for foundation, powder, concealers, eyeshadows, and blush, making it perfect for both everyday makeup and special occasions. The quality of these brushes is outstanding. Each brush is made from premium synthetic fibers that feel incredibly soft on the skin while applying makeup flawlessly. The bristles don’t shed, and they are easy to clean, maintaining their shape after several washes.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $9.99\nKitsch Dermaplaner Tool\n#2 Amazon Bestseller in Women’s Disposable Shaving Razors\nGot stray hairs and peach fuzz? The Kitsch Dermaplaners are handy tools to keep at your vanity for quick hair removal in a pinch. They can be used on the upper lip, eyebrows, or on the entire face to slough off dead skin and fine hairs and reveal a super smooth base to apply makeup or make way for skin care products. This value pack comes with 12 disposable blades, so you’ll always have a clean one on hand between wax and pluck sessions\nEditor testing and review notes: “These little razors are a mainstay in my beauty routine. They’ve never irritated my skin or caused breakouts, and make for a super quick fix when I need to clean up my brows before doing my makeup. I love doing an at-home dermaplaning session about once a month to remove peach fuzz on my cheeks too, because it allows foundation, concealer, setting powder, and other cheek products to apply oh-so-flawlessly. I also appreciate that this tool provides a different buff than face scrubs or chemical exfoliators I have in my rotation — you can instantly see the top-level gunk flake away and feel the incredible, smoothing result.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “I tried these for the first time tonight, after years and years of using battery-powered peach fuzz removers, and OMG, I’m never going back. These get everything! I found them so easy to use.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $8.99\nE.l.f. Complexion Duo Brush\n#9 Amazon Bestseller in Foundation Brushes\nTwo brushes for just $8? It may seem too good to be true, but E.l.f. is beloved for its surprisingly high-quality makeup brushes. The Complexion Duo Brush features a dense yet incredibly soft concealer brush on one end and a slightly fluffy buffer brush on the other. The synthetic bristles allow cream and liquid products to blend like a dream, without creating streaks or absorbing a ton of product. Each brush is multifunctional on its own, but together this brush is the perfect duo for painting your entire face\nEditor testing and review notes: “This brush is a staple in my travel makeup bag. The face brush end is actually one of the best I’ve ever tried. It blends cream and liquid products fast and flawlessly, and I love the smaller end for buffing concealer or blending eyeshadow with broad strokes. I can’t recommend this enough.” — Cigliano\nWhat testers say: “I love this brush. It blends foundation perfectly. It’s very soft and easy to clean. I have cleaned it seven times and have seen no bristles fall out! The fact that it has two brushes makes it very versatile and is a great two-in-one tool. It’s also really well priced for the quality.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $8\nThe Original Makeup Eraser\n19,000+ five-star reviews\nAfter you try The Original Makeup Eraser, you’ll never go back. This unique microfiber cloth is super soft and instantly wipes away an entire face of makeup with just water. It’s easy to clean in the washing machine and can be reused over and over. This one-time purchase will save you so much money that you’d otherwise spend on disposable cloths or makeup removing solutions, and is a stellar sustainable staple to incorporate into your beauty bag.\nEditor testing and review notes: “The Makeup Eraser is a holy grail in my beauty routine. It works like literal magic, effortlessly removing everything from full-coverage foundation to pesky waterproof mascara, and I even find that it exfoliates my skin as I wipe. I use it every evening to take off my makeup and follow up with a face cleanser or micellar water for a squeaky-clean complexion. I’ll throw it in the wash with the rest of my towels and it comes back fluffy and fresh for another week of use.” — Cigliano\nWhat testers say: “Best makeup remover I’ve ever had. I have two of them now and don’t use any other remover products.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $15.20\nPimoys 6-Piece Velour Triangle Powder Puff\n#1 Amazon Bestseller in Powder Puffs\nIf you’re tuned into the newest viral beauty products on TikTok, you’ve probably spotted these triangle powder puffs in “get ready with me” videos from influencers like Alix Earle. Made of soft velour, their acute shape makes blending and setting the corners of the face, particularly the under eye, so easy and precise. These puffs also super handy for baking and creating sharp lines with both powder and cream products. This bargain pack of powder puffs are reusable and washable, so your vanity will be stocked for several months to come.\nEditor testing and review notes: “When I noticed these triangle sponges popping up all over my ‘For You’ page, I had to see for myself if the hype was real. After trying them out, I never looked back. I use them mainly to set my under eyes with loose or pressed powders, and compared to a small, fluffy brush, I find my concealer creases way less — which is my main concern of my complexion base. The angle makes a world of a difference and I find it so much easier to sculpt the face and control powder deposits compared to any other tool.” — Cigliano\nWhat testers say: “I was hesitant to buy yet another type of beauty sponge. But I truly love these much more than any other type of sponge. Helps specifically with under eye concealer and setting powder. I use one sponge to pat in my concealer, and a different one for the setting powder, and it works flawlessly.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $5.99\nHeeta Hair Shampoo Brush\n#1 Amazon Bestseller in Manual Scalp Massagers\nHeeta Hair Shampoo Brush is a top-selling scalp brush on Amazon. It has firm bristles that help you massage shampoo throughout your hair and scalp, and it also works to distribute conditioner while detangling your hair. The bristles will help exfoliate buildup, dead skin, and product from your scalp, which can help prevent dandruff.\nEditor testing and review notes: “I love using this scalp brush when I have a fresh manicure — it prevents the polish from chipping when I scrub my fingertips into my head. The bristles feel amazing on your scalp — it makes wash day something to look forward to.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “I bought this scalp scrubber in hopes of removing product buildup from my hair. No matter how many times I washed my hair, I still had product residue and could not get rid of it, so I decided to buy this product. It’s small, has an easy to use handle. I found this product works great when paired with a detox shampoo. Just apply the shampoo to your hair like normal and then gently massage your scalp and hair. This scrubber also helps to stimulate your scalp and help improve hair growth. It definitely got rid of my product buildup from my hair and scalp. Overall for the price, this product did exactly as described and I would recommend it.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $7.99\nTherabody Theraface Pro\nThis device is for you if you’re ready to invest in a face tool but don’t know where to start. Yes, it’s pricey, but the tool comes with six attachments so that you can rig it for light therapy, microcurrent, deep cleansing, and facial massage (a gentler version of the percussive therapy found in traditional Theraguns). Hot and cold attachments are sold separately, but you’ll want to go all in. The cooling tip acts like a cryo facial tool by staying icy as you glide it on your complexion.\nEditor testing and review notes: “If you’re a fan of facial tools — or immediate gratification and results — it’s worth splurging for this multi-functional facial device. With massage, hot and cold therapy, microcurrent, and light therapy attachments, it’ll be one of your most prized possessions.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “My massage therapist recommended this device. It’s a fantastic little unit that delivers gentle stimulating pulses, so it’s perfect for massaging sensitive neck and facial muscles. I also got one for my 91 year old mother-in-law to use on her painful thigh tendons. She says it delivers wonderful relief. Worth every penny.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $299\nSchick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor\nEverything you need for a perfectly trimmed bikini line is in the Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Moisturizing Razor for Women With Bikini Trimmer. The twofer bikini trimmer includes both a standard five-blade razor infused with a hydrating serum on one side to replace the skin’s natural moisture and a waterproof electric trimmer with an adjustable comb on the other side. That’s what makes this multitasker a great bikini razor. When they team up, you’re left with super-smooth skin, even if you decide to go for a Brazilian. It’s designed to deliver an incredibly close shave without any nicks or cuts.\nEditor testing and review notes: “We all worry about using electrical/battery powered trimmers, even though they’re super convenient, because so much can go wrong. But this guard has three different settings for length, or you can take it off completely for an even closer trim. At first, I wasn’t brave enough to try and use it without the guard in the most sensitive areas, but I did have it on the closest setting and found it to be perfect. I also used it in the shower because it is waterproof.” — Sullivan\nWhat testers say: “This razor is amazing!! It knocks out two problems as once with a personal razor on one end, and on for your legs on the other. This has been one of my favorites for years! I don’t understand why it took so long for me to get it.”\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $20.99\nTweezerman Exclusive Moon Dust Slant Tweezer\n#5 Amazon Bestseller in Hair Removal Tweezers\nTweezerman has owned the tweezer category since debuting in 1980.

Amazon Prime members can toggle the Prime button to find an assortment of product options that are eligible for speedy two-day shipping. If you don’t already have one, join Prime or start a 30-day free trial today.\n- Peruse Amazon bestseller lists: If you’re in the market for top-rated beauty products, but don’t know where to start, you can shop the general bestsellers in beauty and personal products page to discover hidden gems to add to your routine. There, you can add filters to narrow down your hunt and search by product type depending on your needs.\n- Look out for Amazon badges: When you’re browsing Amazon for beauty buys, keep an eye out for badges that say “Amazon’s choice” or “bestseller” to find standout products across specific categories. These items will be top-rated with lots of customer reviews, so you can make informed decisions before you click “buy.”\n- Check for verified sellers: To ensure you’re purchasing from a verified storefront, rather than spending your hard-earned money on counterfeit, expired, or damaged products, double check the seller of the listed product. This is as simple as looking at the “sold by” sections in the product description and making sure it says Amazon or the brand’s name. Another way to tell if a product is safe to buy is by seeing if it is available for Prime Shipping — this is a sign that the brand is an established market partner for Amazon and has been vetted. If a listing has the Amazon’s Choice badge, the item comes from an Amazon-approved seller, too.\n- Shop Amazon’s storefronts: Amazon provides influencers and tastemakers (like Alix Earle) platforms to curate their favorite beauty buys with personal Amazon storefronts. If you love scrolling beauty content on TikTok, it’s likely that your favorite creator has their own storefront for you to browse and purchase from. You can also shop Amazon’s own curated storefronts for Premium Beauty, Professional Beauty, Climate Pledge Friendly, and Internet Famous beauty products.\n- Browse the Amazon Luxury Store: Shopping the Amazon Luxury Store is a great way for beauty lovers to get their favorite prestige products from top-quality brands with the added perks of quick Amazon delivery. This page includes luxury products from brands like Clé de Peau, and other worth-the-splurge lines.\n- Set deal notifications: Always on the hunt for an Amazon deal? One of the best ways to stay on the pulse of Amazon sales is by opting into alerts. You can do so by creating a Wish List on your account, which will prompt the retailer to send notifications based on the products you’re interested in whenever they’re on sale. To create a Wish List, tap the “Wish List” icon in the app and select “Create a List.” Then, go to “Settings” and then “Notifications,” and make sure the “Deals” option is turned on. If you’re looking for a product that isn’t on your Wish List, you can set up a specific deal alert by going to the Amazon app’s homepage and selecting “Today’s Deals.” From there, search for your desired product and select “Watch This Deal.” You’ll then receive alerts when the price drops on that product.\n- Don’t hesitate on a good deal: On top of sales that run during shopping events, Amazon also offers flash deals on popular items. The retailer’s “lightning deals” refer to a limited number of discounts that are offered on a single item for a short period of time. If you spot an item on your wishlist with a steep price drop, it’s best to snag it ASAP, because it could disappear at any moment. To find these deals, go to the Today’s Deals page. Remember that these sales are only available until supplies last or the promotion period for the deal ends, and lightning deals typically have a limit of one purchase per customer.\nThe Benefits of an Amazon Prime Membership\nThere are tons of perks that come with an Amazon Prime membership. For starters, it’s also your ticket to shopping all the makeup, hair care, and skin care sales as early as possible during Prime Day events that come around twice a year, including Amazon’s Holiday Beauty Haul. It also grants you guaranteed free and speedy shipping year-round at the push of a button. Of course, you can still purchase top-rated beauty products without that subscription, but you won’t get the special deal pricing.\nA Prime membership also allows you same-day delivery options and free delivery to Amazon lockers in select locations for convenient pickups. If you’re not an Amazon Prime member and you want first-in-line access to daily discounts throughout the year, all you have to do is sign-up for a free Amazon Prime trial, which will last for 30 days starting from the day you submit the form.\nHow We Tested and Chose the Best Amazon Beauty Products\nTo create this list of the best Amazon beauty products, a panel of six WWD Shop editors and testers, who represent different genders, hair types, skin types, and beauty preferences, conducted hands-on testing with each product on this list. To date, we’ve tested close to 300 Amazon beauty products across hair, skin care, and makeup categories. Some of the products on this list were sent to our editorial team on behalf of the brand for testing, while others were personally ordered by our team using our own money.\nOur editorial team has been conducting Amazon beauty product testing over the course of two years, comparing each item to similar ones in its category to rank its value and results. Some of the products on our list have been tested for the full two year duration, while others have been evaluated for a shorter, two week minimum time period. We ensured that each product was tested by at least two editors to ensure unbiased ratings and to assess any flaws based off of performance on different skin types or hair textures.
