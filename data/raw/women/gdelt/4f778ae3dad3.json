  "body_text": "The four clubs to have qualified for the FIFA Women’s Champions Cup final phase now know exactly what they will be playing for, following the unveiling of the new trophy that will be lifted by the winners of FIFA’s maiden women’s global club competition.\nThe FIFA Women’s Champions Cup Trophy has been designed to embody the core values of the competition: global unity and excellence in women’s club football. It features six maps – representing the location of each participating nation – arranged around a central emblem that reflects both the global reach of women’s club football and the international significance of the tournament.\nTickets for the finals are available now!\nThe unveiling was led by former England international and Gunners legend Alex Scott, alongside two-time FIFA Women’s World Cup-winning coach and FIFA Chief Football Officer Jill Ellis – two powerful role models inspiring the next generation of women’s football fans.\n“It’s incredible to see the first-ever FIFA Women’s Champions Cup come to life here in London, bringing together champions from every continent to compete on a truly global stage,” said FIFA Women’s Champions Cup 2026 Ambassador, Scott.\n“Having dedicated my life to football, I know how important moments like this are. The talent on show will be world-class, and I hope it inspires the next generation to dream even bigger. This is a defining moment for women’s club football and I’m proud that London is at the heart of it.”\nSupporters can look forward to two high-quality encounters: the first matches will take place on Wednesday, January 28 at Brentford Stadium, when CONCACAF champions Gotham FC (United States) face the team that prevailed in last year’s CONMEBOL Libertadores Femenina, Corinthians (Brazil) at 12.30pm. This will be followed by a mouth-watering clash between us and ASFAR (Morocco), the winners of the CAF Women’s Champions League, at 6pm.\nOn Sunday, February 1, the action will move to Arsenal Stadium, where the first women’s intercontinental club champions will be crowned. The venue will host both the third-place play-off at 2.45pm and the final at 6pm, bringing the first FIFA Women’s Champions Cup to a memorable close.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
