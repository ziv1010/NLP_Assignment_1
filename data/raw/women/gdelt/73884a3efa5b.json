  "body_text": "Fans tuning in to watch Thomas Tuchel’s first match as England head coach may have noticed a slight change to the front of their shirts.\nDuring England’s 2-0 win against Albania in their first World Cup qualifier on Friday, squad numbers were placed directly under the logo of shirt providers Nike rather than in the centre, as was seen at Euro 2024.\nAdvertisement\nThis was not part of a redesign by Nike, nor was it a sign of things changing under a new regime — it was simply an accident.\nEngland’s veteran kitman Pat Frost admitted on social media that he noticed his mistake after printing the number on to the first shirt and had no choice but do the same for the rest.\nPrinted the 1st shirt and put them in wrong place so then had to do them in all in same place,back to the usual spot on Monday…..but well done for noticing\n— Pat Frost (@KitmanPat) March 22, 2025\nFIFA equipment regulations dictate that a player’s number must appear on the back of their shirts and on their shorts, but whether a front-of-shirt number is required is down to competition regulations and there are no guidelines on where they should be placed.\nHowever, any fans who enjoyed the new design or were hoping for any more collectors’ items will be disappointed as Frost confirmed that numbers would return to the previous position on Monday when England take on Latvia in their second qualifying match.\nFrost has been working for the Football Association (FA) since 2003, starting out with the men’s and women’s youth teams and working his way up to becoming the kitman for the senior sides.\nHe previously served as kitman at West Bromwich Albion — who he follows “religiously” — and owns a transport company that has contracts with the Scottish FA, Welsh FA and British domestic clubs.\nHe spoke to The Athletic about the life of a kitman in 2020.\n“You definitely have to be organised,” he said. “You can’t afford to forget anything and you have to make sure you have the trust of the players — lose that and there is no point being in the business.”\n(Top photos: Getty Images)",
