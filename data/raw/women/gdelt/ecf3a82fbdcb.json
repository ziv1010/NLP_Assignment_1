It’s published each Saturday and members can receive it directly to their inbox, by going to their newsletter preferences or adding their email to the sign-up box in this article.\nLe fact-check\nThis is the week that Emmanuel Macron became bizarrely popular in the US, or at least half of it, with anglophone social media suddenly awash with posts appreciating his style, intelligence and courage.\nThe reason, of course, was his fact-checking of US president Donald Trump in a press conference on live TV, in which Macron politely but firmly contradicted Trump's incorrect assertions about European support for Ukraine, and pointedly stated that Russia, not Ukraine is the aggressor in this war.\nHere in France, the reaction was decidedly less giddy.\nThat's partly because a significant portion of the population just hate Macron (at this point he could probably single-handedly discover the cure for cancer and half of France would still be unimpressed) and also because we're used to him, and other French politicians, being eloquent and detail orientated.\nBut for me the biggest difference to the reaction was that people in France were focused on whether this will actually make any difference to US policy towards Ukraine or Europe. So far there is little evidence that it will (and, in fairness to Macron, it's unlikely that any European leader could have done better).\nIt's undoubtedly satisfying to see horrible people put firmly in their place but a brief TV 'gotcha' doesn't necessarily mean increased security for Europe or - more importantly - a better outcome for the people of Ukraine, now into another year of heroic resistance to the brutal invasion of their country.\nValue of labour\nAnother tale from an occupied country, this time France in 1943. That was the year that Service Travail Obligatoire (STO) was introduced and roughly 600,000 Frenchmen were deported to Germany to become forced labourers.\nThat might sound like long ago and far away, but this week one of those deportees - Albert Corrieri of Marseille, now 102 - launched legal action against the French state, demanding compensation for his 25 months of brutal slave labour.\nAlbert, who was a torch-bearer at the Paris Olympics last summer, said: \"If the court decision goes the right way, it's good for me, and I'll say 'vive la France'. If not, I won't say 'Down with France', never, but I'll say Honte à la France (shame on France).\"\nRead Albert's story HERE.\nCow pokes\nThis has also been the week for one of my favourite games - Which French politician got the best cow-petting photo?\nAll week French politicians from Emmanuel Macron down have been turning up at the Paris Salon de l'Agriculture to meet farmers, say hello to livestock, taste cheese and generally act like men or women of the people. The skill here is to be photographed petting an animal (usually a cow but some opt for cute baby lambs) in the most relaxed, natural and down-to-earth style possible.\nI've gone through the main contenders on this thread;\nIt's time to play the annual ?? game - Which politician got the best livestock photo at the Paris Salon d'Agriculture? Pictured below is the real star of the show Oupette, this year's official 'poster girl' cow. Yes, that's a thing.

Nestled above the Mediterranean shore and below Marseille's Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde, if there is a better one, I've yet to see it . . .\nStade Francis Di Giovanni, Marseille, Bouches-du-Rhône, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, France. 2023. #Fromthearchives\n— Philémon Beaulieu (@chaacqc.bsky.social) 25 February 2025 at 04:17\n[image or embed]\nInside France is our weekly look at some of the news, talking points and gossip in France that you might not have heard about.
