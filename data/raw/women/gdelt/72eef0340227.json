  "body_text": "EXCLUSIVE: Motorsports and basketball. Indianapolis has become a mecca for those activities as the home of the Indy 500 and the Pacers (who came up just short of winning the NBA crown this year). In recent years, Indianapolis has also become an important destination for cinephiles through the work of Heartland Film, the nonprofit that puts on the Heartland International Film Festival in October, and the Oscar-qualifying Indy Shorts International Film Festival in July.\nToday, Heartland Film announced the lineup for the 8th edition of Indy Shorts, running from July 22-27 in the Indiana capital. More than 250 short films of virtually every genre will be showcased, among them 41 world premieres, 18 U.S. premieres and 113 Midwest premieres.\n“Many of the premiering films have notable names,” the festival comments, including Imelda Staunton (The Most Powerful Human on Earth); André Holland (A Love Letter to M); Lena Headey (Long Pork); Domhnall Gleeson (Retirement Plan); Wallace Shawn and CCH Pounder (The Clock); Rosie O’Donnell (She Raised Me); Amy Sedaris (Happy to Help You); Sophia Di Martino (Undeletable); Stephen Fry and Miriam Margolyes (A Friend of Dorothy); singer-actor Poppy (The Most Perfect Perfect Person), and many others.\nWatch on Deadline\nThe documentary categories will feature work by two-time Oscar winner Ben Proudfoot (Doc Albany); Brad Bailey (Her Fight, His Name: The Story of Gwen Carr and Eric Garner); Layla Absalon (the world premiere of Remembering Indiana Avenue); Alex Herz (the world premiere of Middleground), and many more.\nEmmy-winning producer and editor Doug Blush (The Elephant Whisperers, 20 Feet From Stardom) will receive the 2025 Indy Shorts Pioneering Spirit Award on Saturday, July 26, an event that will include a special screening of his newly-produced short documentaries.\n“Indy Shorts has built an internationally-renowned grassroots reputation for strong thematic programming, top tier hospitality and creating a summer camp atmosphere where filmmakers become fast friends and long-lasting collaborators,” Heartland Film Artistic Director Greg Sorvig said in a statement. “Special thank you to our premiere titles who have entrusted us to launch their festival runs, many featuring familiar faces in audacious new roles.”\nThe festival is Academy Award-qualifying in all three short film Oscar categories: Live Action, Animated, and Documentary. “With a track record of 39 nominations and 10 Oscar-winning shorts in recent years, there’s a good chance attendees will see the next Academy Award-contending films first in Indianapolis,” the festival notes. “Indy Shorts is also a qualifying film festival for the BAFTA and Goya Awards.”\nIndy Shorts is presented by F.A. Wilhelm Construction Co. Possibly taking its cue from that sponsorship, “the 2025 festival is embracing a building/construction theme that encourages attendees to dig into 253 groundbreaking short films that are curated into 39 themed programs. From comedy to horror, there’s a shorts program for everyone. This year, there are also three Indiana Spotlight Programs made up of 19 films by filmmakers with Hoosier ties.”\nThese are the jurors who will determine awards (which come with a total of more than $35,000 in cash prizes):\n- Narrative Jury | Cindy Lee, Jens Georg and Joey Moser\n- Documentary Jury | Nicholas Ma, Jenifer McShane and Julio Palacio\n- Animated Jury | Shelia Lynne Bolda, Rebecca Martin Fagerholm and Jamie-James Medina\n- Indiana Spotlight Jury | Alicia Kozma, Sam Miro and Deonna Watherly\n- High School Film Competition Jury | Mark Cabus, Grace Hanna and Gunnar Sizemore\n2025 Indy Shorts Programs\nFILM TITLE | YEAR | COUNTRY | DIRECTOR(S) | PREMIERE STATUS | DESCRIPTION\n**World Premiere\n*US Premiere\nALTERNATIVE WORLDS\nGaze into different dimensions where reality is not what it seems.\nGoodbye Sun | 2024 | France | Hakim Atoui | Midwest Premiere | Eleven-year-old Luna lives with her big brother, Julien, and her two adoptive fathers.
