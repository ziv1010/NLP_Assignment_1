  "body_text": "College coaches want NCAA to change eligibility requirements for JUCO athletes\nDOTHAN, Ala. (WTVY) - Sixteen national coaches associations have written the NCAA Division I Board of Governors in support of the National Junior College Athletic Association’s effort to change decades-long eligibility requirements for junior college athletes, according to CBS Sports.\nThey believe eligibility standards are “inexplicably more stringent” for junior college athletes transferring to NCAA schools, the NJCAA asked for “immediate change.” The coaches associations from football (AFCA) as well as men’s and women’s basketball (NABC and WBCA) did not sign the letter and may be working on its own communications with the NCAA.\nSpecifically, the NJCAA is questioning why athletes at Junior Colleges like Enterprise State or Wallace State are required to have a higher grade-point average (2.5) than athletes transferring between four-year institutions (2.0).\nThe NJCAA is currently questioning these “different standards” for JUCO athletes:\n- Academic non-qualifiers at a four-year school can regain eligibility after one academic year if they achieve 1.8 GPA over 24 credit hours. A non-qualifying junior college athlete who graduates with a two-year degree must have 48 transferrable credit hours and at least a 2.5 GPA to transfer.\n- Transfers between four-year schools have guaranteed scholarships for the remainder of their five-year eligibility clock. Junior college transfers are not guaranteed scholarships for the length of their NCAA eligibility.\n- Athletes in various sports are allowed a limited number of scrimmages. Think of baseball and softball participating in “fall ball” before the spring season. If junior college athletes participate in more than two scrimmages at the junior-college level before transferring, that counts as a season of competition.\nThe NJCAA has basically taken the stance that two-year athletes are being discriminated against academically.\nCBS writer Dennis Dodd writes, “The fate of junior college athletes has been highlighted lately amid a lawsuit by Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia, who won a preliminary injunction in district court allowing him a sixth year of eligibility after playing at New Mexico Military Institute, a junior college. The NCAA is appealing.”\nIn 2018, Power Five football schools averaged about two JUCO players per team (129), according to one report. By 2021, the year one-time transfer rules started, that number dropped to 45.\nSubscribe to our News 4 newsletter and receive the latest local news and weather straight to your email every morning.
