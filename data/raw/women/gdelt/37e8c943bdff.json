The trash is new and fresh footprints can be seen in the dust - people were just here. This stretch of the Arizona border near a small hamlet called Sasabe is part of the Tucson Sector of Border Patrol's map of operations, and it's one of the busiest areas in the country for crossers not wanting to be caught. Arizona cattle rancher John Ladd told DailyMail.com the situation at the border... -\nIran’s Ayatollah Says ‘No Harm’ in Negotiating Nukes with ‘Enemy’ America\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hinted on Tuesday that he could be open to resuming limited nuclear negotiations with Iran’s great “enemy,” the United States. He also advised civilian government officials not to trust anything the “enemy” says during those negotiations. The Supreme Leader was firm on regarding the U.S. as a deeply distrusted adversary, but said Iran can still “interact with the same enemy in certain situations.” “There is no harm in that, but do not place your hopes in them,” he said. “Do not trust the enemy.” Khamenei, who has absolute power and final say over international... -\nAUSTRALIA: Women’s Football Team with FIVE Trans-Identified Males Win Grand Final Amid “High Security” Camera Bans\nAn Australian “trans inclusive” Premier League women’s football team with five male players has secured victory in the grand final match after dominating games throughout the summer. During the 2024 season of the North West Sydney Football Women’s Premier Competition, The Flying Bats won all 17 games and scored 76 goals while only a total of 8 points were scored against them. The Flying Bats, a football club for “self-identified women and non-binary people,” has attracted significant criticism that has escalated over the past year. The mounting outcry presumably motivated the decision by regulators to ramp up security measures during... -\nComedian Rob Schneider Schools Heckler About Free Speech\nComedian Rob Schneider Schools Heckler About Free Speech MAGA ROB!...............

A series of scandals has exposed widespread bias, incompetence, plagiarism, and censorship. The publicity has prompted some modest changes, but the prospects for science are unclear: nonideological practitioners are outnumbered on campus today, and their ranks are thinning. Scientific institutions have traditionally flourished by recruiting the most proficient researchers and promoting vigorous competition as they freely debate and test their theories. Those traditions remain sacrosanct among older professors, particularly older men with moderate or conservative political views, but not among... -\nOwner of $1.8 million Hamptons summer rental pleads guilty to homicide after fire kills Maryland sisters\nThe owner of a luxury $1.8 million Hamptons vacation rental where two Maryland sisters died in a fire sparked by a shoddy electrical job has pleaded guilty to negligent homicide. Peter Miller, 56, admitted to building an illegal outdoor kitchen that overloaded the electricity system of his $ 8,000-per-week pad in Sag Harbor — killing Jillian Wiener, 21, and her 19-year-old sister Lindsay as they vacationed with their terminally ill father in August 2022, Suffolk County prosecutors said Monday. His wife, Pamela, who managed the popular summer rental, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of reckless endangerment. -\nGeorgia Secretary Of State Brad Raffensperger Is In Costly Litigation For Peddling Lies About GOP Election Volunteer\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is facing a powerful defamation lawsuit arising from false claims he made about a Republican election volunteer in his 2021 book “Integrity Counts.” He wrote and published that a video presentation of unsupervised ballot counting at State Farm Arena in Atlanta had been “doctored,” “chopped up,” “cut,” “sliced up,” and “deceptively sliced and edited so that it appeared to show the exact opposite of reality,” allegedly including a “slice of video that had removed the clear evidence” that the law had been followed. -\nWas Ist Verboten - From showers to air conditioning to refrigeration, eco-tyrants are at war with modern conveniences.\nWe’ve noticed over the last couple of decades a repeating cycle in which finger-wagging scolds tell us that we need to drop some of the conveniences of modernity as sacrifices to Gaia, our Mother Earth. Two examples that have come around more frequently than Halley’s Comet have been the loony broadsides launched against air conditioning and showers. Now add to that a campaign aimed at refrigeration, because it causes “wide-ranging climate implications.” Nicola Twilley, author of “Frostbite: How Refrigeration Changed Our Food, Our Planet, and Ourselves,” seems to be on a crusade to reverse the benefits of refrigeration. In an... -\nJim Jordan subpoenas company led by daughter of NY v Trump judge\nFIRST ON FOX: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, is issuing a subpoena for information on the political work conducted by the daughter of New York State Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan. Jordan sent a letter to Michael Nellis, the founder and CEO of Authentic Campaigns – a company that's done political work for top Democratic clients like President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris – accusing him of failing to comply with House investigators' demands for any and all documents related to the prosecution of former President Trump. -\nNolte: Record High — Harris-Biden Create ‘Most Unaffordable Housing Market in History’\nHome prices, and therefore the American Dream, are the most “unaffordable … in history,” according to the latest data. “Home prices hit a new record in June amid an ongoing housing shortage, even as high mortgage rates continued to push affordability out of reach for millions of Americans,” reports Fox Business. The report adds, “Prices increased 5.4% nationally in June when compared with the previous year,” which is only down slightly from “the 5.9% pace recorded the previous month.” “The upward pressure on home prices is making this the most unaffordable housing market in history,” Bright MLS’s chief economist told... -\nTommy Robinson Served Second Contempt of Court Notice\nEnglish activist Tommy Robinson has been served another contempt of court notice over allegedly making false statements about a Syrian refugee. Robinson, a long-time critic of Islam and an anti-grooming gang activist, faces being sent back to prison after the Attorney General’s Office issued him with a second contempt of court notice, The Telegraph reports. He is alleged to have violated an injunction from the High Court on two occasions earlier this year, including during a protest in London’s Trafalgar Square. The court had banned Robinson from making claims about Syrian teenager Jamal Hijazi, who successfully won £100,000 in damages... -\nChild, 11, becomes youngest person to be arrested over riots\nAn 11-year-old child has become the youngest person to be arrested for alleged violent disorder during the riots this summer. Cleveland Police said officers had detained a total of 14 people on Wednesday in connection with the rioting. The force said the child arrested is the youngest person yet to be detained on suspicion of violent disorder. Another 11-year-old was previously arrested on suspicion of arson in connection with the riots, police said. “Teams of officers headed out this morning to target those believed to be involved in the disorder,” the force said. “The ages of those arrested were between... -\nFBI arrests ex-police officer accused of staging suicide in murder case\nCANTON, Mass.(TND) — A former detective accused of killing a pregnant Massachusetts woman in 2021 was arrested on Wednesday. FBI officials in Boston said Matthew Farwell was arrested for allegedly killing Sandra Birchmore. Farwell worked for the Stoughton Police Department when 23-year-old Birchmore was found dead in her apartment. A 2022 internal investigation found that three police officers on the Stoughton police force engaged in inappropriate sexual relations with Birchmore, according to WBZ. Federal prosecutors alleged that Farwell had a sexual relationship with Birchmore, which had started before she turned 16. Prosecutors believe Farwell killed the young woman after she... -\nIs Tulsi Gabbard the GOP’s Dark Horse?\nBefore she left Congress last winter, the former Democratic representative Tulsi Gabbard introduced two bills: one restricting abortion; the other, banning trans women from participating in women’s sports. The bills, which had no chance of passing, nevertheless sent a message: the onetime darling of the Bernie Sanders appeared to leave Congress intent on cultivating a right-wing following. Now her move to the right is just about complete. Gabbard, appearing on Fox News channel’s Hannity in November 2021, declared that the Democratic Party’s social-spending bill, known as Build Back Better, was part of a deeper problem. The government was “too powerful... -\nCounting Down my iTunes Play Count (VANITY) – Day #10\nDay #10 of the Top 50 songs on my iTunes playlist -- ranked in reverse order by play frequency from #50 to #1 and presented here on a series of FR threads. I'm posting them here on a new thread that compiles the growing list one day at a time over the next couple of months. I only post them on weekdays and may miss a day or two here and there, so it will take at least ten weeks to do this. And to show my gratitude to the FR management for giving us all a forum to post... -\nParty Over for Alarmists as Sea Temperatures Plunge Around the World\nSurface ocean temperatures are plunging rapidly around the world with scientists reported to be puzzled at the speed of the recent decline. Less puzzlement was to be found when the oceans were ‘boiling’ during the last two years. Plebs flying to Benidorm for an annual holiday and causing ‘global heating’ was a favourite explanation, although mainstream media put it in marginally more polite terms. For almost two years, this boiling ocean trope has been a reliable standby for every alarmist spiv promoting the Net Zero insanity. But expect the scare to be parked for a while along with coral reefs,... -\nFBI Document Leak: Gun Owners Are Violent Extremists iStock-1422002264\nFBI : New symbols guide leaked which indicated that terms such as “Molon Labae”, “Prepping”, and “Second Amendment (2A) can be sign of 'militia violent extremists(MVE) according to the document and the Ammoland article. \"Lawyer Stephan Stamboulieh on X (formerly Twitter) released more documents from the FBI’s symbol guide. This list seems to be an updated list of those previously released to the public. At the same time AmmoLand News received the same print outs.” -\nNATIONAL RED WINE DAY - August 28\nNATIONAL RED WINE DAY On August 28, National Red Wine Day ushers in the flavors of fall. As the grapes ripen and signal a time for warmer sips, wine drinkers know reds mean tailgating and spicy foods. #NationalRedWineDay Throughout the year, wine days afford us the opportunity to taste and learn about the differences between wines. Earlier this month National Prosecco Day gave us the last bubbly rays of summer. Now we savor the best of the season with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot noir, Port, and Syrah. Red wine varietals produce deep ruby reds as well as subtle ambers and...\nBrowse by Forum\nGet Connected! Join Free Republic Today!\nAlready a Member?
