  "body_text": "Saudi Arabia on March 26 said it will participate in the Miss Universe pageant for the very first time, a significant move by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud to shed the image of a conservative country.\nRumy Alqahtani, a 27-year-old influencer and model, announced on Instagram that she would be the first-ever participant from the country in the international competition.\n\"I am honoured to participate in the Miss Universe 2024 competition. This is the debut of the Kingdome of Saudi Arabia in the competition,\" the model wrote on Instagram.\nAlqahtani hails from the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh and is known for participating in global beauty pageants.\nUnder the leadership of the crown price, the country has been witnessing a steady change in its image and loosening of tight restrictions. The country, which is the largest in the Arabian Peninsula, has traditionally maintained a strict religious and social control.\nHowever, in the last few years, the country that is known for its conservatism, has been allowing women to drive, attend mixed-gender events and apply for passports without the male guardian.\nThe country also aims to have over 150 million tourists by 2030 as part of the vision for the economy that includes diversifying away from oil and related business. It has also planned a mega entertainment city Qiddiya on which it has already splashed millions of dollars under its Vision 2030 plan.\nIt has been organising music concerts and has officially bid for the 2034 Men’s FIFA World Cup, apart from buying some of the world’s biggest football teams. It has also invested heavily in drawing football mega starts to its home soil, in efforts to boost its image as a global destination.\nIn addition, it has also allowed sale of alcohol for non-Muslim diplomats in the country. Historically, the Muslim country has seen the Islamic clergy wield influence over daily life and how laws are implemented. Till now, alcohol was only available through black market or diplomatic mail.\nIt will now be available in the Diplomatic Quarter, in the southwest of Riyadh, where most of the foreign officials live. Diplomats will have to obtain clearance and will be subject to limits.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.
