  "body_text": "Welcome to the Skull Session.\nOhio State's basketball teams will have one last dance in 2023-24 — the women in the NCAA Tournament, and the men in the NIT.\nWe're Dancing!\n— Ohio State Womens Basketball (@OhioStateWBB) March 18, 2024\nWe take on #15 seed Maine in Round 1 of @MarchMadnessWBB pic.twitter.com/b1ZdyD0Ab3\nLet's play some more basketball, shall we?\n— Ohio State Hoops (@OhioStateHoops) March 18, 2024\nWe've officially accepted an invite to the NIT and will enter as a #2 seed, hosting the Cornell Big Red in the first round.@NITMBB | #GoBucks pic.twitter.com/daZagBCTWj\nHave a good Monday.\nIT’S WORTH THE RISK. Months ago, my wife, Maggie, and I had a conversation with a friend – let’s call him Lucas since that’s his name – in which Lucas wanted our opinions before he made a difficult decision.\nI don’t remember much about the conversation. However, Maggie told me afterward that I asked the question, Is it worth the risk? “too many times.” She then put the question on a letterboard that sits near our front door, and the letterboard hasn’t changed since. No, seriously, I am looking at it as I write this Skull Session. As I do, I can’t help but think of the conversations Ted Carter, Gene Smith and Ross Bjork had about Jake Diebler's promotion to full-time head coach of the Ohio State men’s basketball team.\nIs it worth the risk?\nCarter, Smith and Bjork think so.\nI do, too.\nSince Diebler took over as interim coach, Ohio State has looked like a different team and has a 6-2 record, including three victories over NCAA Tournament teams in Purdue (No. 1 seed), Nebraska (No. 8 seed) and Michigan State (No. 9 seed).\nMoreover, Bruce Thornton has become more of a distributor, Jamison Battle has returned to form as a 3-point shooter and Roddy Gayle has improved on both ends of the floor. Freshmen Scotty Middleton and Devin Royal have also turned into consistent contributors for the Buckeyes as Diebler has utilized a deeper bench.\nBy all accounts, Diebler has been able to get the most out of this team down the stretch. If not for some questionable calls in Ohio State’s loss to Illinois in the Big Ten Tournament, I think Diebler could have had this team – the same one that was 14-11 when Smith fired Chris Holtmann — in contention for a spot in the Big Dance.\nThat clearly meant something to Bjork, whom Carter and Smith credited for making the hire in Ohio State’s official press release.\nBorn a Buckeye, Stays a Buckeye\n— Ohio State Hoops (@OhioStateHoops) March 17, 2024\nSenior Advisor for Intercollegiate Athletics Ross Bjork today announced the hiring of @JakeDiebler as head coach of the Ohio State mens basketball program.\n: https://t.co/WyxLiaVGvm pic.twitter.com/qIeX5P3h5P\n“Jake Diebler possesses all of the characteristics we were seeking as we conducted a comprehensive and thorough search for a new head coach,” Bjork said. “Those include coaching ability, passion, energy, program knowledge, character, integrity and ties to Ohio. As an Ohio native, the son of longtime Ohio high school coach and with deep connections to Ohio State, Jake knows what it takes to lead this program on a championship course.”\nYes, Diebler has passion, energy, program knowledge, character, integrity, and ties to Ohio. But Diebler – more than any other candidate for the role – understands what it’s like to coach at Ohio State. He has relationships here, has recruited here and has had success here.\nThat said, I think it’s smart the Buckeyes kept him around.\nThe moment we made it official with Head Coach @JakeDiebler\n— Ohio State Hoops (@OhioStateHoops) March 17, 2024\nHear @RossBjorkAD and @JakeDiebler address the team this afternoon to announce the news.#GoBucks pic.twitter.com/9J7iraFEWQ\nHow bad can it be… you hire the next Holtmann?\nHow good can it be… you hire the next Tom Izzo?\nYou may laugh at the second comparison, but Izzo was a high school head coach from 1977-79 and an assistant at Northern Michigan (1979-83) and Michigan State (1983-95) before the Spartans hired him as their full-time head coach in 1995. Now, he’s the longest-tenured head coach in the Big Ten and has a career record of 704-291 with 10 conference titles and one national championship (2000).\nThe point is – this may pan out, it may not.\nWe’ll have plenty of time to see if it was worth the risk.\nPEPE LE PEW. Pepe Pearson wants to run out of the Ohio Stadium tunnel – not as a player, but as the Buckeyes’ running backs coach.\n“It’s been a dream, something I’ve thought about ever since the day I got into coaching,” Pearson told Rob Oller of The Columbus Dispatch last week. “I can picture myself running out of the tunnel at the Shoe, giving back to these players. I get chills every time.”\nPearson coaches running backs at Tarleton State University, an FCS school in Stephenville, Texas. He joined the Texans’ staff after spending the 2020 and 2021 seasons as a running backs coach at Tennesee State, where he worked under Ohio State legend Eddie George. Before that, Pearson spent time at Marshall (2016-20), Youngstown State (2015), and Ohio Dominican (2004-14).\nWhile Pearson lacks experience at the Power 5 level, the former Ohio State ballcarrier — who ranks 11th in program history with 3,076 career rushing yards and scored 27 touchdowns in his two years as a starter – feels like he would “prove himself” if given the chance to coach for the Buckeyes.\n“I (have) always felt like I am a Power 5 coach,” he said. “But I understand the timing of the way things happen sometimes. If given the opportunity as a running backs coach (at Ohio State) I would be able to prove myself at that point and open some eyes of people who wonder why I haven’t coached at a Power 5 yet.”\nA Northeast Ohio native, Pearson was runner-up for the 1993 Mr. Ohio award at Euclid High School. There, he ran for 4,500 yards and 49 touchdowns in four seasons and earned 1993 USA TODAY All-American honors. Pearson went on to have an All-Big Ten career at Ohio State before spending four years in the NFL with the Detroit Lions, San Francisco 49ers, Chicago Bears, Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns.\nRobert Gillespie, Deland McCullough, Stan Drayton and Scottie Graham are among the possible candidates to be Ohio State's next running backs coach with Tony Alford off to Michigan. https://t.co/9fSqyGb7ud\n— Eleven Warriors (@11W) March 13, 2024\nAs far as candidates go for Ohio State’s now-vacant running backs coach position, I think Pearson has a lot to offer. But can he offer more than Robert Gillespie, Deland McCullough, Stan Drayton and Scottie Graham? That is a question Ryan Day must answer sooner rather than later.\n(I would include George in that list of names, too, but Tim May of Lettermen Row has reported that the 1995 Heisman Trophy winner isn’t interested in the role and wants to remain at Tennesee State).\nMy two cents? Give Gillespie an offer he can’t refuse. If he somehow refuses, bring either Drayton, Graham or Pearson home.\nCODY! CODY! HE’S OUR MAN! Last week, Ohio State linebacker Cody Simon appeared on ”Morning Juice” on 97.1 The Fan. Simon discussed several topics with co-hosts Brandon Beam and Bobby Carpenter, namely his decision to return for another season with the Buckeyes and his relationship with linebackers coach James Laurinaitis.\nHere is some audio and a transcript of Simon's interview:\nhttps://t.co/lXyHJzUI6Z\n— Morning Juice (@MorningJuice971) March 15, 2024\nCody Simon talked about his workout schedule during spring break...his decision to return for a fifth season...why he chose Ohio State over Penn State...and having James Laurinaitis as Linebackers coach and Schlegs as Strength & Conditioning coach\nOn his decision to return for another season\n“It was definitely a hard decision. I had a lot of hard talks with my family. I think the main thing was — you kind of have goals when you come to college, and you want to accomplish certain things. For better or worse, we haven’t really accomplished our goals. It was a great opportunity for me to step in front and say, ‘I want to come back’ and have guys come back with me. I wouldn’t say I am the reason they came back — definitely not. But we all have a collective goal that we want to accomplish, and I am so happy those guys made the decision too. I think we have a really good chance. Now, it’s all about hard work, getting back to that point and finishing it off.”\nOn how he ended up at Ohio State\n“It was a tough decision. I was choosing between Ohio State, Penn State and Nebraska. Those three were my three schools. … My main thing was that Ohio State felt like the school where I would be challenged the most. I (would be) around the best players at all times and it would maximize my potential. I knew that I would have to be at my best to compete. As long as I’ve been here, I’ve gotten better and better. Now, I have a leadership role and I’ve tried to be the best leader I can be. I think they’ve developed me the best. I’m happy I made that decision.”\nOn his evolution as a football player\n“Every day, (Ohio State tries) to recruit someone who will try to take your spot and be better than you. For me, it was, ‘I have to try and get better every day.’ I know that sounds cliche, and we always say that, but you really have to find new ways to advance your game and training. You have to get stronger. You have to get mentally stronger. The guys who were above me really helped me with my mental strength. They helped me navigate that path of how to get better, how to work your game and how to be a smarter player.”\nOn his performance in the 2023 season\n“I prepared as if I was going to be the starting guy in both (linebacker) positions in every game. I think that helped me because it gave the coaches confidence in where they could put me. Obviously, (Tommy Eichenberg and Steele Chambers) played super well, and I came in wherever to contribute, but I think, for me, I did what I could to give Coach (Jim) Knowles confidence that I could be wherever he needed to implement me. It’s good to have that experience. … I use everything I can to help me progress and get better every year.”\nOn James Laurinaitis, his coaching style\n“He’s the best coach. He’s done it before. We know he has the experience. We know we can trust his teaching and his coaching. It’s been super easy — that transition. He came in and immediately he’s been a great coach for us.”\nOn Ohio State’s linebacker room, his role in the room\n“I talked to Coach Laurinaitis about this, but it’s about bringing the level of the group up. We want to have as many players contribute as possible. We have longer seasons now. It’s hard to go through a season with two guys. … Fifteen games is a long time. You need to be able to have guys who can contribute constructively and come in there and improve the game. We have the guys who can do it. … We have a lot of time to get our guys going and have them make a difference this year.”\nOf the Buckeyes who chose to return for another season, Simon is the most underrated. In four seasons at Ohio State, the 6-foot-2, 232-pound linebacker has recorded 147 tackles, 11 tackles for loss, three sacks and one forced fumble. Simon’s best season came in 2023 when he collected 57 tackles, three tackles for loss and two pass breakups as the team’s third linebacker behind Eichenberg and Chambers. He was – in my opinion – one of Ohio State’s best defenders down the stretch.\nThat said, I look forward to Simon’s fifth season with the Buckeyes. I have confidence he will be a captain of the defense the same way Eichenberg was for the past two years. He will also be an excellent mentor for Sonny Styles, C.J. Hicks, Gabe Powers and Arvell Reese, all of whom have little experience at the position while wearing a scarlet and gray uniform.\n*FOOTBALL NOISES*. Jack Sawyer and JT Tuimoloau were “Mic’d Up” for one of Ohio State’s spring practices two weeks ago. The Buckeyes’ media team captured several great moments between the defensive ends and their teammates. Then, they created a hilarious video of them.\nMicd up with the Edge Rush duo\n— Ohio State Football (@OhioStateFB) March 16, 2024\n@jacksawyer33 x @JT_Tuimoloau pic.twitter.com/bpdjnPD2WQ\nReminder: Spring practice is back this week.\nHallelujah.\nSONG OF THE DAY. “There Will Be Time” - Mumford and Sons, Baaba Maal.\nCUT TO THE CHASE.
