  "body_text": "Aston Villa and England striker Rachel Daly has announced her retirement from international football.\nThe 32-year-old was part of the England squad that won the European Championship in 2022 and reached the 2023 World Cup final in consecutive summers.\nDaly won 84 senior caps for the Lionesses and scored 16 goals in an international career spanning eight years.\nAdvertisement\nHer final appearance for her country came from the bench during Tuesday’s 2-0 Euro 2025 qualifier win over the Republic of Ireland at the Aviva Stadium.\n“I would love nothing more than to play for England forever, but the time has come for me to hang my boots up on the international stage,” said Daly.\n“While today is an extremely difficult day for me, it is also one filled with reflection and immense gratitude. Playing for and representing England has been the greatest honour.\n“Winning the Euros and then reaching the World Cup Final changed a lot for me, not only as a footballer but as a person.\n“I am very fortunate to have played a small part in making history with the Lionesses and I feel now is the right time to pass on that baton to the next generation and be England’s number one fan from the stands!”\nDaly made her England debut against Serbia in 2016 and represented the Lionesses at three major tournaments.\nUtilised as a striker during her club career, she has primarily played at full-back for England under Sarina Wiegman.\nShe started every match during England’s triumphant Euro 2022 campaign where she was deployed at left-back, and played seven times at the 2023 World Cup, primarily as a left wing-back, despite finishing as the Women’s Super League’s (WSL) top scorer the season before.\nPaying tribute to Daly following her retirement, Wiegman had particular praise for her versatility.\n“Rachel has been an incredible part of our story and the history we’ve made together. It has been a privilege to work with her,” the England manager said.\n“I have never worked with a player so versatile, always with a smile on her face, bringing energy and trying to do her best for the team.\n“It is sad that she won’t be with us anymore, but we should celebrate what she has done for the team and now she becomes our No 1 fan.”\n(Brendon Thorne/Getty Images)",
