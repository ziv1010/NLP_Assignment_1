  "body_text": "Serena Williams’ daughter Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr. has made history once again!\nAt age 5, Olympia has become a two-time sports owner! As AfroTech previously told you, the daughter of Williams and Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian Sr. made headlines for investing in women’s soccer team Angel City FC alongside her parents when she was 2.\nNow, Olympia can stamp a new title on her budding resume, becoming a part-owner of The Los Angeles Golf Club, the first team in Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy’s planned tech-infused golf league, TGL. What’s more, Serena and Alexis Ohanian Sr. are expecting their second child, who will also have partial ownership.\n“Announcing my fellow co-owner of @wearelagc… @olympiaohanian! Olympia is the youngest owner in professional sports (@weareangelcity) and is now the youngest 2-team owner in professional sports. She’ll be joined by her future sibling,” Alexis wrote on Instagram.\nIt appears to be a family affair as sisters Venus and Serena Williams also join Alexis in securing the franchise in the TGL, which is a virtual golf game intersecting sports with technology, according to KTLA Channel 5. The TGL is the result of a partnership between TMRW Sports and the PGA Tour, with games set to launch in January 2024.\n“It’s official! I’m thrilled to announce my involvement with @tglgolf with the launch of @wearelagc – Los Angeles Golf Club. An important part of the spirit and purpose of LA Golf Club is making golf our own, for everybody, and I couldn’t be more excited to shape the future of this sport with my family @alexisohanian @olympiaohanian and @venuswilliams,” Serena wrote on Instagram.\n“The notion of what we want to build here is proof this is a sport for everyone,” Alexis explained about his new golf franchise, per KTLA. “We’ve seen the ascent. You can’t go through your social media feed without seeing something related to golf and it’s a sport that actually, I think for a lot of folks, didn’t think was for them. We want to prove that it is.”",
