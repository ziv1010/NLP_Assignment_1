  "body_text": "The prospect of a European Super League reared its head again last week and so did the threadbare plans for the future of women’s football.\nBut, just like the last time the breakaway league was proposed, the Super League’s grand plan for the future of European football only briefly referenced the women’s game.\nAdvertisement\nThis time the women’s game occupied 51 words of a 1,138-word document from A22, the firm behind the proposals — a slight increase on the 27-word sentence tacked onto the initial announcement in April 2021.\nThose 51 words were: “Football stakeholders should promote and develop the women’s game by putting it ‘centre stage’ side-by-side with men’s competitions. To achieve this goal, financing should be significantly expanded beyond existing contributions from women’s European club competitions. Investments should be provided not only at a professional but also at grassroots level.”\nAdditional details, though, were sorely lacking and the overwhelming response from the women’s game was certainly not positive.\nIn April 2021, when the initial Super League was announced, UEFA chief of women’s football Nadine Kessler wrote an open letter addressing the implications on the development of women’s football.\nSpeaking to people entrenched in the sport, there is a feeling the game should be very wary of a company like A22 trying to use the women’s game as a trojan horse, a way of sneaking through their plans for a men’s Super League. One major club recognises the issues around the women’s club structure and although a brand and identity shake up would help, the issues run far deeper.\nSo is a Women’s Super League too radical? Would it be legal? Would it be financially viable? And which teams would be included?\nMost importantly, would it be in the interests of the women’s game as a whole?\nThe Athletic analyses the pros and cons of such a bold idea…\nLaunching a breakaway competition would be legally difficult — but not impossible.\n“Trying to stay open and install the system of promotion and relegation, that is really essential,” says Dr Katarina Pijetlovic, a law professor at Catolica University of Portugal.\nAdvertisement\n“If it stays open, it could work out legally and in the regulatory sense as well. The Super League in men’s football shot itself in the foot when it initially proposed a closed league because it is widely argued by academics that it would breach competition law. Also there was no objective qualification criteria, which is essential.”\nThat doesn’t mean that it’s not wise to gather the best teams, as long as the teams which are no longer the best leave and teams which have become the best can get access.\n“Gathering the best in one league and promoting it quite aggressively is actually a measure to enhance the visibility of women’s football which is desperately needed,” says Pijetlovic. “That would be another public interest objective even though there are some consequences for the domestic leagues.\n“But clubs in those domestic leagues will also directly benefit from it, perhaps by having the solidarity mechanism (whereby clubs who are not in the new competition receive payments from those who are) that you make up and the possibility to end up playing in that Super League themselves.”\nIn December, UEFA and FIFA received a boost when a report released by the European Court of Justice said their existing rules and tournaments were “compatible with EU competition law” after A22 had claimed they were breaching anti-competition law. An official ruling from the court is expected before the end of the 2023-24 season and that is likely to shape the legal future of the European game — for men and women.\nThe finances of any breakaway league are as important as the legal complexities.\n“The evidence seems to suggest that a women’s league negotiating their own terms and contracts would be more financially viable and would get more money from broadcasting and sponsorship,” says Christina Philippou, principal lecturer in accounting at the University of Portsmouth.\nAdvertisement\n“Usually men’s leagues just add women’s rights as an extra bonus as part of the package. But that dampens the ability to get revenue.”\nMore games between competitive teams results in a better product, more viewers and more money. It would undoubtedly boost the revenues of the clubs involved. But it would also make life more difficult for the existing domestic leagues.\n“If you’re using a league like this to try and generate interest in the women’s game, increase audiences and showcase the sport, what you need to be careful of is that you don’t then keep the elite as the elite because of all the money coming in and then nobody can catch up,” says Philippou.\n“You would end up torpedoing local leagues. That destroys the potential for having competitive domestic leagues if you’re trying to get interest coming in. If you don’t watch how much is redistributed from the start, then you effectively create a closed league.”\nIt’s a balance between short-term gain and sustained long-term success; something football often finds difficult given the demand for immediate glory.\n“If the elite clubs took a smaller cut now, in 10 years’ time, we would all be much better off, including the elite,” adds Philippou. “But it’s risky as well, because football changes so much. It doesn’t take much of a financial issue to turn a club that has been incredibly successful to either disappear or start rolling down.”\nAlthough England’s Women’s Super League (WSL) is becoming more competitive, there are huge gaps between the top and bottom of women’s domestic European leagues. A lack of willingness from clubs to invest is holding back the sport.\nThe frequent lack of competitiveness is not lost on the players.\nAfter Barcelona’s 3-1 defeat to Lyon in last year’s Champions League final, captain Alexia Putellas suggested the lack of “competitive rhythm” in the Spanish league was a key reason for the French club’s success.\nAdvertisement\n“No matter how much we train, we need their competitive rhythm because this rhythm is not what we have in our domestic competition,” she told Spanish TV. “It is achieved by tightening everything, the infrastructure, the players, everything has to be tightened if we want to have this competitive rhythm, we have to change.”\nDespite what Putellas says about the competitive nature of the French league, Lyon have won the title 15 times in the last 16 years. Wolfsburg and Bayern Munich have won every Frauen-Bundesliga title from 2012-13 onwards between them, while Juventus, who have won Serie A for the last five consecutive years, Roma and Milan dominate their often amateur opponents.\nJuventus head coach Joe Montemurro told The Athletic last season: “These players have never really been able to express the talent they’ve got on the world stage against the best. They don’t play regularly against the best and I think that’s a problem.”\nMontemurro is one of those who is open to the idea of new competitions as a way of addressing this issue.\n“Do we need more football? Absolutely. Everyone wants to get to the Champions League level but why not have the teams that come third and fourth in a second-tier Europa League-type competition? Because that will ascertain more interest but give the exposure to the second-tier club.”\nThe WSL is not immune to this criticism. There was a 10-point difference between fourth and fifth last year and there are calls for the Continental Cup’s format to be changed given the sustained dominance of Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal.\nDespite these complaints, these competitions have been growing and there has been a surge of interest from broadcasters and sponsors in recent years. The WSL took a huge step when it agreed a three-year deal worth around £24million ($29m; €27m) with Sky Sports, the biggest broadcast deal in global women’s football.\nAdvertisement\nBut these numbers pale in comparison to the men’s game — as referenced last week by Tottenham Hotspur chairman Daniel Levy.\n“We need to approach this differently to men’s football,” he said in a club statement. “Significant support does not currently exist at a level which attracts commercial income to grow the game in a sustainable manner.\n“If clubs are to commit substantial resources for the long term, it is important that the sport’s organising bodies deliver the appropriate regulatory framework and create attractive competitions that would deliver millions of fans around the globe.”\nThe WSL deal is worth just 0.2 per cent of the Premier League’s domestic and international rights, for example. Spain’s Liga F is worth 0.7 per cent of La Liga’s deal, meanwhile. That number is 0.4 per cent for the Frauen-Bundesliga, according to research by London-based Ampere Analysis.\nThose numbers do not reflect the potential of the women’s game. Last year’s Women’s Champions League reached 56 million views worldwide through DAZN, with the key audiences hailing from Spain, USA, France, Germany and the UK, illustrating the breadth of appeal. The margin for growth is huge.\nA women’s Super League may be a commercial success but preserving its sporting integrity would be more challenging.\nA key question is which teams would be involved in the inaugural season. Who gets left out? Would the league launch with the teams who enjoy European success now? Or should teams who are rapidly rising through the rankings be thrown a bone?\nNo doubt the teams left behind would have something to say about it. Compensation paid to non-participating clubs for the potential damage done to domestic leagues is a key issue.\n“Today’s Champions League already creates a competitive imbalance because participating clubs are rewarded financially. We have brought competitive imbalance to the point of no return,” says Pijetlovic.\nAdvertisement\nSolidarity payments are used to offset that. The 2021-22 revamped Women’s Champions League brought about an expanded qualifying stage to ensure at least 10 national associations were represented in the groups and the centralising of broadcast rights opened up the competition to new audiences. It is estimated to bring in €24million (£20.6m, $25.7m), 23 per cent of which is set aside for non-participating clubs in each national association that has entered at least one club in the competition.\nThe funds are earmarked for development and not the running costs of the club. A Super League which brings in more revenue could mean more money for those not involved — but that depends on how much the elite clubs are willing to share.\n“They would need robust solidarity mechanisms,” Pijetlovic adds. “If you cannot already participate because of sporting merit, which is dependent on finance, well, here’s a bunch of money for you so that you can compete on an equal footing, or at least have a chance to progress. The clubs in those domestic leagues will directly benefit.\n“But then elite clubs wouldn’t like to give away a large chunk because they want to retain as much as possible of their broadcasting rights. They want to maintain everything that they earn. They’re commercial entities interested in giving returns to their owners and shareholders rather than engaging in some sort of social function in European football.\n“In principle, it would be a commercial decision to play in a Super League.”\nThe Super League concept is not going away but the women’s game must no longer be treated as an afterthought. Women’s football is at a crossroads and needs an innovative strategy, but it doesn’t have to follow the same path as the men’s game. At the very least, the conversation about a breakaway league should be a wake-up call.\n(Top photo: Chelsea ahead of facing Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League in December; by Harriet Lander/Chelsea FC via Getty Images)",
