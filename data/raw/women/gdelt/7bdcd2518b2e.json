Well, those classic “Star Wars” weapons top a list of 11 pieces of movie tech that our military should actually develop.\n- Lightsabers.\n- Sticky gloves from “Mission: Impossible”. For scaling walls and stuff.\n- Troop transporting time machine from “The Tomorrow War”. Allows you to recruit troops from the past to fight today’s battles.\n- Magic healing cream from “The Hunger Games”. This one’s pretty self-explanatory.\n- The Neuralyzer from “Men In Black”.
