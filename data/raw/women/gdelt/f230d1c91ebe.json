  "body_text": "'Not just a flash in the pan' - Lionesses' legacy\n- Published\nWhen England won the European Championship in 2022 it was a watershed moment for women's football in the country.\nMatch attendances skyrocketed, investment grew and media coverage increased.\nBut after England triumphed in Switzerland on Sunday to retain their European crown following a dramatic penalty shootout against Spain, England manager Sarina Wiegman said: \"We're not there yet.\"\nThe legacy of Euro 2022 - England's first major women's trophy - will be difficult to surpass in its importance to the growth of women's football.\nBut that of Euro 2025 - a first major trophy won on foreign soil and the first time an English senior team has retained a title - could prove crucial in further cementing the game's place in society.\nCaptain Leah Williamson, speaking before Sunday's final, said: \"You don't want to be a flash in the pan, a memory, and when we spoke before 2022 we said it was the start of something.\n\"We are still trying to play our role in that. We know how powerful that is. I hope it continues to grow, the respect for women's football, the respect for women and women's sport in general - we can try our best to elevate that.\"\nLionesses success = women's football success\nSuccess for the Lionesses translates as success for the women's game in England.\nAfter the Euro 2022 victory, interest in the domestic game piqued with every Women's Super League club seeing increased attendances the following season. A similar spike was felt after the 2023 World Cup, where England lost to Spain in the final.\nClubs that were home to high-profile Lionesses drew the biggest crowds, with Arsenal attracting the most and setting a new WSL attendance record of 47,367 in their first home game at Emirates Stadium post-Euros.\nThe Gunners have gone on to break the WSL attendance record another three times, but last season average attendances dropped by 10% compared with the previous campaign.\nFor the first time in three years the WSL did not benefit from taking place after an international tournament where there had been home success after Great Britain failed to qualify for the Olympics.\nEngland triumph is most-watched TV moment of 2025\n- Published28 July 2025\nRecord attendances and carnival atmosphere - Euro 2025 a hit for hosts\n- Published27 July 2025\n'We'll remember this forever': England fans jubilant as their heroes win again\n- Published27 July 2025\nIt is not just attendances that spiked following Euro 2022. Here are some other significant developments:\nIn 2024, the Football Association (FA) revealed that in the previous four years 129,000 more girls became involved in schools football across the host cities of Euro 2022, while almost 1,500 new female football teams registered.\nIn September 2024, a new deal worth £45m was agreed for Barclays to continue as the title sponsor for the WSL. Worth in the region of £15m a year, this stood at double the previous arrangement.\nIn October 2024, a new WSL broadcast deal with the BBC and Sky Sports was agreed, which runs through to 2030. The money generated from these rights is shared between WSL clubs.\nRevenues for WSL clubs soared by 34% during a record-breaking 2023-24 season, with each club generating more than £1m for the first time.\nPlayer transfer fees in the WSL have increased, with Chelsea and Arsenal twice breaking the world record in the past six months - with the latter making Olivia Smith the first player to cost more than £1m.\nHow did the Lionesses use their profile in 2022?\nThe players have never shied away from their role in advocating for positive change for women and girls' football.\nJust hours after winning Euro 2022, England defender Lotte Wubben-Moy spearheaded an ultimately successful campaign in which the Lionesses' squad wrote an open letter to the then-government demanding equal access to school football for girls.\nSuccessive governments have since turned her words into action and on Monday ministers announced plans to double the amount of time women's and girls' football teams get allocated at government-funded sports facilities.\n\"These girls are constantly using their voice for change,\" said former England striker Ellen White.\n\"Wanting to inspire a nation and wanting to gain more opportunities for young people and young girls. They're so inspiring - they want to make change. They are perfect role models.\"\nThey have shown they are not afraid of speaking out on causes they believe in. Williamson, who wears a rainbow armband in support of LGBTQ+ rights when playing for England, previously said it was \"rubbish\" to tell players to \"stick to football\" and avoid politics before the men's World Cup in Qatar.\nBefore the last Women's World Cup, former Lionesses goalkeeper Mary Earps called out Nike for failing to sell England women's goalkeeper shirts, which led to the sportswear giant making a U-turn.\nDuring Euro 2025, after defender Jess Carter was subjected to online racist abuse, the Lionesses decided they would no longer take the knee before games as they did not feel it was having enough impact. \"[It is] clear we and football need to find another way to tackle racism,\" they said in a statement.\nWin or lose, the Lionesses feel a sense of responsibility for women's football and frequently talk about inspiring the next generation of young boys and girls to play.\nSpeaking after celebrating with fans in central London, Williamson said: \"Everything we do, we do it for us and our team but we do it for the country and young girls.\n\"This job never existed 30 or 40 years ago and we're making history every single step. Stay with us, this story is not done yet.\"\nWhat impact could Euro 2025 win have?\nWhile the legacy of Euro 2022 is clear, everyone involved in women's football knows there is still a long way to go.\n\"This is another massive ignition moment,\" said Nikki Doucet - the chief executive of WSL Football, which has taken over responsibility of the WSL and the WSL 2 this season.\n\"In some ways I think we're even more set up to capitalise on this opportunity now that we have the independent company set up - it's our job to take the inspiration and run with it as fast and hard as we can.\"\nMost WSL clubs are reliant on financial support from a men's team, although London City Lionesses will become the first team with no affiliation with a men's club to play in the women's top flight this season.\nOutside the top flight, clubs' positions are much more precarious. Blackburn became the latest example as they decided to withdraw from the second tier, now WSL 2, for this season as they could not meet the financial and operational requirements of the league.\nLast summer Reading, who were in the WSL as recently as two years ago, decided to withdraw from the second tier and drop to the fifth because of financial issues.\nFA chief executive Mark Bullingham said the WSL was on a \"good trajectory\" and success at Euro 2025 will \"turbo-charge\" that along with plans for grassroots growth.\n\"We want to get to the point where you know we should have the same number of girls and women playing football as boys and men, and until we've done that we've got a job to do,\" he said.\nFA director of women's football, Sue Day, agreed there was much more to be done for women's football in England.\n\"We want more matches on the TV, we want more opportunities for fans to be able to get involved, we want more money to be able to pay the players with, we want more kids playing in schools,\" she told Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"So we have to really capture this moment and turn it into everything we all want football to be for girls.\"\nThe England team have already shown in the aftermath of their latest triumph that they will continue to make their voices heard.\nSpeaking at a reception at Downing Street on Monday, manager Wiegman said: \"We need some more investment. We're not there yet.\n\"In England we're up there but England needs to stay the trailblazer, it needs to be the big example - the players first but also the Football Association, the clubs, the government, the country, the fans. Let's keep being the trailblazers.\"\nAnd the players are already planning their next move.\nMidfielder Georgia Stanway said: \"The point is now we don't have to keep winning to create a legacy and create change… but the fact that we win, it opens the doors so much more, gives us so much more opportunity to make change.\n\"We'll discuss as a player group what it will look like over the next few weeks and what we want to go into. But this is a massive door for us to step into.\"",
