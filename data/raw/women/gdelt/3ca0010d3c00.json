The club found the £75,000 a week striker did not commit the offences which he was charged with but decided it would be best for all if his future was away from Old Trafford.\nMan United's football director John Murtough had taken over discussions for Greenwood's proposed loan move abroad and it was announced today that the England international has signed for Madrid-based club Getafe.\nManchester United said in a statement: 'Mason Greenwood has signed for La Liga side Getafe CF on a season-long loan, subject to international clearance.\n'The move enables Greenwood to begin to rebuild his career away from Manchester United. The club will continue to offer its support to Mason and his family during this period of transition.'\nManchester United fans protested against the return of Mason Greenwood after charges were dropped against him\nAmong the prominent voices behind the backlash was Countdown co-host Rachel Riley, a life-long Manchester United supporter. The TV personality had threatened to stop supporting the club if they'd allowed the 21-year-old to return to the fold\nGetafe tweeted a video of jubilant fans celebrating the forward's arrival outside their stadium\nGetafe announced the signing of Greenwood with a video of fans wildly celebrating outside the club's Coliseum Alfonso Perez stadium as they waited for an official announcement. They began jumping and chanting when the deal was confirmed.\nAfter reports emerged that United chiefs were toying with a Greenwood return, it prompted a major backlash including from Countdown co-host Rachel Riley, a life-long Red Devils supporter.\nGreenwood, who was pictured training while being watched by his newborn daughter and father last month, had also been linked with moves abroad to Italy with Lazio but the club's president Claudio Lotito claimed United did not sign the paperwork in time.\n'I tried until the last minute,' Lotito told La Lazio Siamo Noi shortly after the Italian transfer window closed on Friday evening.\nMeanwhile heavy-spending Saudi Pro League clubs reportedly snubbed taking on the striker amid intense scrutiny over human rights issues in the country, with sources claiming football chiefs were concerned about the potential baggage he could have brought with him.\nAfter Man United announced Greenwood would be leaving, sources told the Mail that the forward would either depart on loan or have his contract settled.\nGreenwood was arrested in January 2022 after a number of harrowing images and video were posted on social media. He was charged with attempted rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour in October last year. The charges, which Greenwood denied, were dropped in February 2023.\nThe club concluded their review last month and shared a lengthy statement.\nA United spokesperson said: 'All those involved, including Mason, recognise the difficulties with him recommencing his career at Manchester United. It has therefore been mutually agreed that it would be most appropriate for him to do so away from Old Trafford, and we will now work with Mason to achieve that outcome.'\nThe England international was arrested in January 2022 on suspicion of a number of offences including attempted rape but the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the charges in February this year after key witnesses withdrew and new material came to light\nMason Greenwood was pictured hard training last month. He will not play for Man United again\nGreenwood was pictured back at training this morning while his father Andrew held the player's baby daughter\nThe club added: 'Based on the evidence available to us, we have concluded that the material posted online did not provide a full picture and that Mason did not commit the offences in respect of which he was originally charged.\n'That said, as Mason publicly acknowledges today, he has made mistakes which he is taking responsibility for.'\nGreenwood himself said: 'I was brought up to know that violence or abuse in any relationship is wrong, I did not do the things I was accused of, and in February I was cleared of all charges. I take my share of responsibility for the situations which led to the social media post.\n'Today's decision has been part of a collaborative process between Manchester United, my family and me. The best decision for us all, is for me to continue my football career away from Old Trafford, where my presence will not be a distraction for the club. I thank the club for their support since I joined aged seven. There will always be a part of me which is United.'\nMost watched News videos\n- Extraordinary moment mass brawl breaks out between Brits on flight\n- Finance expert's TV interview interrupted by adorable granddaughter\n- Moment driver veers to target e-bike riders before killing teen\n- Moment Swiss bar fire owners collapse after being confronted\n- Chilling police interview of ISIS fanatic plotting UK attack\n- Astonishing moment a street is swallowed by a sinkhole\n- Israeli hostage reveals how she survived being tortured\n- Deepak Chopra confronted over his relationship to Epstein\n- Food vlogger dies after 'eating toxic devil crab'\n- Spy cam shows woman on her knees next to Jeffrey Epstein\n- New video shows man with backpack similar to Guthrie kidnapper\n- Toddler opens car door in traffic and sends biker flying",
