  "body_text": "Wembley Stadium has become the UK’s first sports venue to benefit from having its own dedicated 5G standalone mobile network after EE completed major upgrades at the spiritual ‘home of football’. Football fans attending England Women’s UEFA Nations League match against reigning world champions Spain later this month will be the first in the UK to experience Wembley’s enhanced in-stadium connectivity, as the 5G standalone network is used for a live public event for the first time.\nThis first-of-its-kind deployment of 5G standalone is part of EE’s continued refinement of its network experience at the UK’s biggest stadium, having recently resigned a multi-year partnership with Wembley to ensure it remains one of the best-connected stadia in the world. Unlike previous 5G technologies which relied on using 4G infrastructure, 5G standalone operates entirely separately, unleashing increased capacity and performance so fans can benefit from more reliable mobile internet, faster loading speeds, and improved video calls—even in busy areas and during major events.\nThe technology also has the potential to be used to support Wembley Stadium’s wider event operations, including retail point-of-sale and television broadcasting, as well as future fan experiences.\nMarc Allera, CEO, EE\nThe Lionesses have made history with their ground-breaking performances on the pitch, and now we’ve made history off it with the launch of the first 5G standalone network at Wembley Stadium. Whether it’s the Emirates FA Cup Final or one of the hotly anticipated gigs this summer, our cutting-edge mobile connectivity will ensure fans can capture, share, and experience history in new ways under the iconic Wembley arch in 2025.",
