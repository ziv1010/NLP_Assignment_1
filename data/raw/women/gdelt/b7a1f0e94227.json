  "body_text": "By Rubén Morales Iglesias: FIFA has threatened to suspend Brazil if the Brazilian Football Confederation (Confederação Brasileira de Futebol – CBF) proceeds with the court-ordered election of a new president before a FIFA commission reviews the situation.\nOn December 7, a Rio de Janeiro court removed CBF president Ednaldo Rodrigues due to irregularities in his election last year.\nAssociated Press reported that FIFA wrote a letter to a Brazilian football executive on Sunday advising that the CBF could be suspended if it proceeded with the reelection to replace Rodrigues. The Rio de Janeiro court removed Rodriguez and his executive after it was determined there were irregularities in the CBF elections. The ruling was upheld by Brazil’s two highest courts last week.\nFIFA does not allow governments or third parties to interfere with its member associations. Hence, the suspension warning.\nIf Brazil is suspended, neither the Brazil national teams nor its clubs could compete internationally.\nThe Rio de Janeiro court appointed José Perdiz, the head of Brazil’s top sports court, to organize elections for new president and executive body within 30 working days.\nHowever, FIFA and South American Confederation (CONMEBOL) said in the letter they will set up a commission to review the situation in Brazil on January 8.\n“FIFA and CONMEBOL would like to strongly emphasize that, until such mission takes place, no decision affecting CBF, including any elections or call for elections, shall be taken,” the FIFA letter signed by Kenny Jean-Marie, FIFA’s Chief Members’ Association Officer, and CONMEBOL’s deputy secretary-general, Monserrat Jiménez Garcia.\n“Should this not be respected, FIFA will have no other option but to submit the matter to its relevant decision-making body for consideration and decision, which might also include a suspension.”\nIf the CBF proceeds with the elections to replace Rodrigues and FIFA moves to suspend Brazil, it could affect Brazil’s bid to host the 2027 Women’s World Cup.\nSixty-nine-year-old Rodrigues was elected in 2021 to serve a five year period which would be up in 2026.",
