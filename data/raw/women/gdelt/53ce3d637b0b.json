  "body_text": "Erin Brockovich holds town hall for concerned East Palestine residents\nActivist Erin Brockovich held a town hall Friday evening in East Palestine, Ohio, for residents impacted by this month's train derailment.\nBrockovich speaks in East Palestine: Watch the report above.\n\"Unfortunately, this is not a quick fix,\" Brockovich said to the packed crowd in an auditorium at East Palestine High School. \"This is going to be a long game.\"\nThe well-known environmental advocate urged people in East Palestine to arm themselves with as much information as possible.\n\"You have the ability to become — and you will become — your own critical thinker,\" Brockovich said. \"You will vet information. You will ask questions. You will demand answers.\"\nBrockovich validated residents' concerns about air and water quality, even as state and federal health officials insist that they have not detected readings at dangerous levels.\n\"I've never seen anything in 30 years like this is in the situation happening in East Palestine,\" Brockovich said.\nBrockovich's speech was followed by a detailed presentation by Mikal Watts, a prominent Texas lawyer, who cited rulings by the Ohio Supreme Court to explain why he could not offer advice on specific cases in a public meeting or stay after the meeting to answer questions.\nWatts did, however, argue that taking steps to protect their health could also help them in their legal pursuits.\n\"I'm begging you — for your own good — go get your blood and urine tested now,\" Watts said, suggesting that the results could serve as sufficient evidence for litigation.\nGia Delisio said those words resonated with her as she sat in the auditorium.\n\"I have that written in my notes,\" she said. \"We'll definitely be reaching out to our doctors.\"\nWatch the full video of Brockovich's comments above.\nEarlier Friday, residents in East Palestine told us they were anxious for answers and insight on how to deal with this environmental challenge.\n\"I think this is something she definitely has experience in, and we do not, so I think her insight will be very helpful and hopefully give us more knowledge and wisdom as to where to go from here,\" said Angela Lefebvre, of East Palestine.\nResidents say they're concerned about the effects of the derailment 10, 20, even 30 years from now. Some don't believe government agencies are as transparent as they need to be.\nThey hoped to learn about their rights and gain insights into how to manage their environmental challenges at the town hall meeting Friday.\n\"Nobody here knows what the effects of this is going to be 10, 20 years from now, how our grandkids are going to be affected, what kind of birth defects are going to happen,\" Larry Berdine said. \"Nobody knows, and they need an education.\"\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced a new hotline to help support residents and businesses. The hotline will help provide various services, including air monitoring, water sampling, intake for scheduling cleaning services. The number is 866-361-0526.",
