  "body_text": "SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO – January 30, 2024 – Most Valuable Promotions (MVP) today announced international superstar Jake “El Gallo de Dorado” Paul (8-1, 5 KOs) will face professional boxer Ryan “The Rhino” Bourland (17-2, 6 KOs) on Saturday, March 2, 2024 at the legendary Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan, Puerto Rico as Paul continues to face more experienced opponents on the path to becoming a world champion. Paul vs. Bourland, an 8-round cruiserweight fight, will be the co-main event alongside Amanda “The Real Deal” Serrano (46-2-1, 30 KOs) vs. Nina Meinke (18-3, 4 KOs), presented by CELSIUS Live Fit. Essential Energy, which marks Amanda Serrano’s first fight in Puerto Rico since becoming the island’s first undisputed world boxing champion, male or female. Bourland, Paul’s toughest match to date, brings years of experience and success to the ring against Paul in his 20th professional bout with more wins and knockouts than any of Paul’s previous opponents. Serrano vs. Meinke, featuring Paul vs. Bourland, will be offered as part of the DAZN subscription package to ensure it is affordable and accessible to fans worldwide, with Jake Paul also set to donate his full fight purse to his nonprofit, Boxing Bullies, to renovate youth boxing gyms across Puerto Rico. Tickets are now on sale at Ticketera.com.\nPaul vs. Bourland will mark Paul’s first entrance into the ring this year following his most impressive performance to date on Friday, December 15, in which he secured a viral, first round knockout of three-time Golden Glove winner Andre August for his ninth professional win. Paul showed tremendous growth as a boxer on his path to becoming a world champion and added another highlight to his already impressive reel. Since turning pro in 2020, Paul has collected multiple accolades for his commitment to the sport of boxing, including ESPNRingside’s 2021 Knockout of the Year, Sports Illustrated’s 2021 Breakout Boxer of the Year, ESPNRingside’s 2022 Viral Moment of the Year, and was the cover of Sports Illustrated’s “The 50 Most Influential Figures in Sports” issue, awarded specifically for his groundbreaking work to revolutionize the sport through equitable pay, providing a platform for young fighters, and his support of female boxers. Paul also recently announced a partnership with USA Boxing ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics, continuing his mission to elevate the sport and its future champions.\nPaul also continued his record-breaking streak in his latest fight by achieving the highest recorded gate for a boxing event in Orlando’s history. Paul vs. August also broke the record for highest average ticket price, matching the average ticket price of Paul’s latest fight vs. Nate Diaz at the American Airlines Center in Dallas. The upcoming Serrano vs. Meinke and Paul vs. Bourland event is expected to be yet another record-shattering night for Paul, Serrano, and Most Valuable Promotions.\n“I’ve always said my goal is to become a world champion. I beat a pro boxer in December in the first round, someone who’s been boxing their entire life, and what did I do next? I went straight back to camp to get ready to face my next opponent, a professional boxer who has twice as many professional fights under his belt than I do,” said Jake Paul. “It’s a new year, it’s an even better me, and I’m facing an even more experienced, seasoned boxer on Saturday, March 2 as co-main to the Puerto Rican GOAT, Amanda Serrano. I’m fighting for experience, not for the money, and to show my love for this beautiful island I’ll be donating my entire fight purse from this event to my nonprofit Boxing Bullies to help renovate gyms across Puerto Rico.”\nRyan “Rhino” Bourland, born June 17, 1988 has a professional boxing record of 17-2-0 (6 KO). He grew up in Vallejo, California where he started learning how to box in the sixth grade. Ryan had over 15 amateur bouts, was a Golden Gloves Champion and fought in the National Junior Olympics. Ryan’s professional boxing record began at age 25. Ryan was recognized as Northern California’s Fighter of the year by Inside The Ropes Boxing in 2016. In 2018 Ryan won the regional light heavyweight GBO title in his fight against Jose Hernandez II. Throughout Ryan’s career he has always given back to the community by coaching boxing to local youth and adults. Ryan was featured sparring in the movie “Pride Jewel” (2022). Bourland comes to the ring vs. Paul off a three-fight winning streak, including his latest bout against Santario Martin, which Bourland ended with a decisive fifth round knockout. Martin previously went the distance with Paul’s last opponent, Andre August. At 17-2 with six KO’s, Bourland has proven his tenacity and skill in the ring. With just two losses in his professional career, Bourland is a determined and steady fighter and is Paul’s toughest opponent to date.\n“Jake Paul steps into the ring with his social media clout, but let’s not mistake followers for experience or skill,” said Ryan Bourland. “While he’s been busy chasing likes, I’ve been honing my craft for years, stepping into the ring and beating real boxers. On Saturday, March 2 I will shock the world and put an end to Jake Paul’s boxing career.”\n“Jake Paul has broken record after record and in this fight, he’s once again showing what a tremendous person he is as well,” said Nakisa Bidarian, co-founder of MVP. “Not only is Jake taking on yet another more experienced professional boxer in Ryan Bourland, but he’s also supporting Amanda Serrano as she headlines this historic event at the legendary Coliseo de Puerto Rico, demonstrating his and MVP’s commitment to equality in the sport. I applaud Jake’s continued commitment to giving back to the youth after he announced he is donating his entire purse from this fight to Boxing Bullies so the organization can continue their mission of renovating boxing gyms to give boys and girls a positive environment to learn. The world continues to watch Jake, and he continues to deliver. Thank you to DAZN for working with us to make this event available to fans around the world and to Celsius for their continued support and partnership. Serrano vs. Meinke featuring Paul vs. Bourland is going to be historic and we can’t wait to bring this amazing card to Puerto Rico.”\nAlso featured on the Serrano vs. Meinke and Paul vs. Bourland card on Saturday, March 2 will be Javon “Wanna” Walton, who will make his highly-anticipated global debut as MVP’s latest signee, WBO junior flyweight world champion Jonathan “Bomba” Gonzalez (27-3-1, 14 KOs) vs. fellow Puerto Rican talent Rene Santiago (12-3, 9 KOs), and finally in a battle of Puerto Rico vs. Mexico, the young, super flyweight sensation Kystal Roado (2-0, 1 KO), is set to face 5-0 Gloria Munguilla in the toughest test yet of her career. Rosado’s fight will be 4 x 3:00, following Amanda’s lead of fighting 3 minute rounds. The event marks Amanda Serrano’s first fight in Puerto Rico since becoming undisputed champion, with a sellout crowd expected to honor her as Puerto Rico’s first-ever undisputed world boxing champion, male or female. Serrano will fight for the second time at 12×3, the men’s championship standard, in defense of her unified IBF, WBO, WBA, IBO, and Ring Magazine featherweight world titles. In a true commitment to change for women’s boxing, Serrano recently vacated her WBC title, as the sanctioning body does not support women’s choice for 12×3.\nSerrano vs. Meinke is MVP’s latest women’s championship fight as the company works to establish equity across the sport. The bout follows Amanda Serrano’s first-ever 12×3 unified championship fight in October and the Shadasia “The Sweet Terminator” Green vs. Franchón Crews-Dezurn WBC super middleweight and WBA Interim world title bout in December.\nSerrano vs. Meinke will air live globally on DAZN.
