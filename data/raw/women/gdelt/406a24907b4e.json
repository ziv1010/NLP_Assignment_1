Eagles have yet to taste premiership success at senior football level.\nThey have come close, finishing runner-up four times: 2016, 2019, 2022 and 2023.\nThis Saturday, they will head to the well again, this time taking on South Warrnambool in the 2024 season decider.\nThe Eagles faithful will be praying that the old adage, good things come to those who wait, will play out.\nBut while patience is a virtue the men and women north of Warrnambool have proven they possess, history shows they can also get things done in a hurry when the situation arises.\nThe Eagles are the latest incarnation of their club, changing to its gold and royal blue from the red, black and white of Northern Districts.\nThe Northern Districts version of the club had competed in the Warrnambool and District Football Netball league from 1986-1997.\nIts high point came in 1994 when it not only won the league's senior premiership, but did so without losing a game for the whole season.\nThe victory was a triumph for skill and persistence, but perhaps the most of all, it was a reward for compromise.\nYou see Northern Districts was born out of division and haste.\nThe club was formed from three entities: Bushfield, Grassmere and Country.\nBushfield had been around since the start of the 20th century and had joined the Warrnambool and district league in 1959.\nThe club wore the Bulldog colours and called Bushfield oval home.\nTheir biggest day in the sun came in 1977, defeating East Warrnambool to win their only district league premiership.\nA few minutes up the Hopkins Highway was the Grassmere Football Club.\nWearing the famed black and white vertical stripes, Grassmere had formed around the same time as Bushfield and also joined the district league in 1959.\nThe club had more premiership success than their neighbours, bringing three flags to their home ground at Purnim, in 1960, 1968 and 1972.\nThe third piece of the puzzle was the Country Football Club, an entity that fielded teams in the Warrnambool Junior Football League.\nLike Grassmere, Country was based at Purnim and wore Collingwood's black and white.\nBut in its final years, the club reached the spotlight for a number of reasons.\nThey changed their jumper to the one worn by Carlton, the only club we could find in the south-west to have worn that kit.\nThis period in the early 1980s coincided with success on the field, with Country making it to the under 16s preliminary final in both 1984 and 1985.\nThe Country team included some talented youngsters, including brothers Mick and Pat McKinnon and Mark and Kevin Hellier.\nBushfield also had teams in the junior competition when numbers allowed.\nIn 1982, the under 14s team made the elimination final, going down to powerhouse St Johns.\nBut the Bushfield line-up had some impressive names, including future AFL-listed players Stephen Anderson, Wayne Schwass and Wayne Morrissey.\nBut it was the lead-in to the 1986 season that changed the football landscape forever in the north.\nGrassmere had appointed star player and four-time Esam medalist Wayne Cox as its coach for the 1996 season.\nAt Bushfield, Ron Tickner had taken on the top job.\nBoth clubs were heading into the 1986 season in slightly different positions.\nGrassmere finished seventh in 1985 with six wins, while Bushfield was coming off a tough season where it failed to win a game.\nBut in the scheme of country football, none of this was out of the ordinary, fortunes of smaller clubs were known to fluctuate.\nBut the local football world was sent into shock when The Standard reported on March 8, just 28 days before the start of the 1986 WDFNL season, that Bushfield, Grassmere and Country were to merge and become Northern Districts.\nIt was a unanimous vote from Grassmere and 95 percent from Bushfield to make the merger happen.\nTickner was appointed as senior coach, with Cox as his assistant.\nThe reason behind the merger was to become more financially stable and to deal with falling player numbers.\nWith time ticking down to the start of the season, the club started training.\nBut its first big controversy was about to hit, with an article in The Standard on March 19 announcing Tickner had been replaced as senior coach by Cox.\nTickner put the new club first, stating in the following day's newspaper that he would stay on as a player.\nA week later, March 27, and it was declared Northern Districts would wear the red, black and white uniform of St Kilda, and would be known as the \"Northern Saints\".\nThe club's junior teams would play their home games at Purnim, with the senior teams to call Bushfield home.\nOn Saturday April 5, the rapid creation of the new club was complete, with Northern Districts playing its first game, against Merrivale.\nIt was an inauspicious start, with the Tigers winning by 16 points.\nWhile it was a rough start, the season was a successful one, with Northern Districts winning 11 games and finishing fifth on the ladder.\nThis had them contest an elimination final against Russells Creek, with the new kids on the block losing by just four points.\nAnd so the journey had begun, and there will be some old Bushfield and Grassmere hearts hoping glory on Saturday will provide the ultimate reward for what began as a whirlwind, and is still going all these years later.",
