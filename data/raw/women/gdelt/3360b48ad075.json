Six international athletes — each a dominant force in their field over the last 12 months — have been shortlisted.\nAnnounced this morning by shortlisting panellist and broadcaster Josh Denzel, the contenders (in alphabetical order) are:\n- Mariona Caldentey (Football, Spain)\n- Terence Crawford (Boxing, USA)\n- Armand Duplantis (Athletics, Sweden)\n- Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone (Athletics, USA)\n- Shohei Ohtani (Baseball, Japan)\n- Mohamed Salah (Football, Egypt)\nVoting is open now at bbc.co.uk/spoty and closes at midday on Sunday 14 December. The winner will be revealed live during the BBC Sports Personality of the Year ceremony on BBC One and BBC iPlayer from 7pm on Thursday 18 December.\nThis year’s shortlisting panel brought together leading voices from across sport, including 2014 Rugby World Cup winner Maggie Alphonsi, former England footballer Anita Asante, double Paralympic champion Libby Clegg, former world champion boxer Carl Frampton, cricketer and broadcaster Ebony Rainford-Brent, and broadcaster Kelly Cates.\nMedia representation came from the Daily Mail’s Riath Al-Samarrai and The Times’ Molly Hudson, with BBC Sport represented by Director Alex Kay-Jelski, Head of Content Philip Bernie and Executive Producer Marc Vesty.\nBelow, the BBC outlines the achievements that earned each nominee their place on the shortlist:\nMariona Caldentey (Football, Spain)\nA standout first season in English football saw Caldentey drive Arsenal to Champions League success against her former club Barcelona, scoring 19 goals in 41 appearances.\nShe claimed both the PFA Women’s Player of the Year and WSL Player of the Year awards, and scored in the Euro 2025 final, where Spain narrowly lost to England on penalties. She finished runner-up in the Ballon d’Or and was named in UEFA’s Champions League Team of the Year.\nTerence Crawford (Boxing, USA)\nCrawford strengthened his claim as one of boxing’s all-time greats, becoming the first male fighter to unify three weight divisions in the four-belt era.\nAfter rising two weight classes to face Canelo Álvarez at super middleweight, he delivered a unanimous decision in Las Vegas, collecting the WBA (Super), WBC, IBF, WBO and The Ring titles. He extended his perfect record to 42 fights, with the last 20 all world title bouts.\nArmand Duplantis (Athletics, Sweden)\nPole vault phenomenon Duplantis secured a third World Championship gold, raising his own world record to 6.30m — his fourth record of 2025 and the 14th of his career.\nHe retained his indoor title and completed an unbeaten run across 16 events, becoming the first male pole vaulter in modern history to go two full seasons undefeated. He claimed the men’s World Athlete of the Year award for the third time.\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone (Athletics, USA)\nHaving dominated the 400m hurdles, McLaughlin-Levrone switched to the 400m flat — and became the first athlete to win world titles in both events.\nHer time of 47.78 was the second-fastest in history, edging close to a world record that has stood since 1985. Undefeated in either discipline for two years, she added 4x400m gold in Tokyo and was named World Athlete of the Year (female division).\nShohei Ohtani (Baseball, Japan)\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers’ talisman delivered a historic display in their World Series-winning campaign, smashing three home runs and striking out ten Milwaukee Brewers batters — making him the first pitcher since 1942 to hit three homers in a game. He claimed his third consecutive, and fourth overall, Most Valuable Player award, moving to second on the all-time list.\nMohamed Salah (Football, Egypt)\nSalah fired 29 Premier League goals in Liverpool’s title-winning season, becoming the first player to win the Golden Boot, Playmaker Award and Premier League Player of the Season in a single campaign.\nHe was also named PFA Men’s Player of the Year for a record third time and earned a third Football Writers’ Footballer of the Year award. In doing so, he overtook Sergio Agüero to become the Premier League’s highest-scoring overseas player.",
