FIFA did not run a traditional bidding contest for the 2025 edition -- instead appointing the United States to stage the 32-team event -- and has yet to outline how the 2029 host will be selected.\nCBF president Samir Xaud has framed the talks as ongoing, saying last year: 'It's a subject I discussed with president Infantino... God willing, Brazil will host the 2029 Club World Cup.'\nFor 2029, Brazil already has one club assured of a place in the tournament. Flamengo earned its spot by winning the 2025 Copa Libertadores title.\n--Field Level Media",
