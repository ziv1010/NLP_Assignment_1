  "body_text": "As of Tuesday, the Millie Bright Appreciation Society on Facebook has 12,901 followers. It’s objectively a decent number for an unofficial page, but it doesn’t quite encapsulate the influence of the now former England centre-back.\nBright announced her retirement from England duty on Monday, doing so on her Daly Brightness podcast that the Chelsea defender started earlier in April, alongside Aston Villa and former England forward Rachel Daly.\nAdvertisement\nThe announcement shouldn’t have come as much of a surprise. Bright has not played for England since April 30, subbed after 45 minutes in a 3-2 defeat to Belgium in the UEFA Nations League group stages, one of those obvious hindsight harbingers now.\nEngland manager Sarina Wiegman has a heft of quality centre-backs to choose from: Leah Williamson, Jess Carter, Maya Le Tissier and Lotte Wubben-Moy, all of whom helped England defend their European title this summer, reducing Bright’s absence from the tournament to a blurry asterisk.\nBright ruled herself out of the European Championship in Switzerland, opting to undergo minor knee surgery and citing the mental and physical toll the game had taken out of her and a need to finally, for once, do something for herself.\nWhich is really Bright’s England legacy.\nBright’s international career is a litany in which her self was regularly sacrificed for the success of the team. It’s a career that includes 88 caps, six goals (including that volley at Molineux in the 2022 Arnold Clark Cup, which saw her share the Golden Boot trophy alongside two-time Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas), an historic European Championship medal, a World Cup silver medal, and countless performances in which Bright was an impenetrable wall, a strong but soft-spoken vision of England at their best.\nBright is only the second England player to captain the country at a senior World Cup final, joining the late Bobby Moore, who led England to glory in 1966.\nAs vice-captain at Euro 2022 and a key player in that triumph, Bright ensured that the landscape of English women’s football was forever transformed: more recognition, more investment, more respect. But she was also there for the almosts, the growing pains towards glory: England’s 3-0 semi-final defeat to eventual winners the Netherlands at Euro 2017, the 2-1 semi-final defeat to the USWNT at the 2019 World Cup.\nAdvertisement\nThroughout that time, Bright was a stalwart, a player whose greatest statements came from rattling headers and crunching tackles, from standing tall against the world’s best attackers.\nWhich brings us to the past year and Bright stepping forward off the pitch, publicly fighting to be seen as a human being, all messy-bunned and cool hoodies, unfiltered TikToks and unabashed rough edges and raw feelings.\nAfter being heckled by fans with whom she had just snapped photographs during Chelsea’s 1-0 Women’s Super League (WSL) win over Aston Villa last February, Bright took to social media to address the behaviour, writing in her post that players were “not robots”. It was one of the instances that led Bright to choose to start a podcast in the first place, a decision that some critics wrote off as a distraction to her career but Bright saw as integral to it.\n“I’m not an object,” she told The Athletic. “You can ask for my autograph, but the minute you disrespect me, you’re not going to get my autograph. Because, actually, as players, we don’t owe anyone anything. We play for the fans every single game, that is the biggest thing.”\nThese public displays have been important because in these moments, it is temptingly easy to zero in on what Bright has done on the football pitch. Her journey did not begin until she was nine years old, the result of being placed on a horse at the age of one and feeling a frisson of destiny. Only destiny was momentarily wrong. Eventually, Bright traded the muddy stables of South Yorkshire for a pitch with Killamarsh Dynamos.\nThree years later, the teenager joined Sheffield United, where a burgeoning love for football met food diaries, gym sessions, fines for tardy arrivals and, auspiciously, Paul Green, now the Chelsea Women general manager but then of Doncaster Belles. At 15 years old, Bright was still three or four years out from the growth spurt that would transform a then waify forward into a robust defender. But that did not stop Bright from shaking Green’s hand so vigorously that he remembered it years later.\nAdvertisement\nA year later, Bright moved to semi-professional Doncaster Rovers Belles’ senior team, where she continued to play as a striker but was better known for her ability to occupy opposition defences with her physicality and aggression.\nAnd it was around this time, after Bright requested a loan to Leeds United for more minutes, that she began to ask the questions that have made her such an endearing, powerful force to so many fans. “I wondered, do you want this?” Bright recalled to the FA website in March 2023. “Have you got the confidence? Do you feel valued? Do you think you are good enough?”\nThey are the questions that have guided her since, from relegation from the WSL with the Belles in 2014 and rejecting an offer from Chelsea Women to remain loyal to Rovers and stay a season in the second tier. Bright is evidence that trusting one’s intuition is more valuable than any gamble.\nShe progressed into the under-23s with England, making the move to Emma Hayes’ Chelsea the following summer. A year later, in September 2016, she earned her first cap for the England senior national team, coming on as a last-minute substitute in a 2-0 win over Belgium.\nThis at least brings symmetry, a first and last chapter against Belgium. The mushy middle, of course, is the best part. How Bright tirelessly improved between 2019 and 2022 to become a rugged, reliable and composed centre-back, translating that improvement to Euro 2022, where she and fellow centre-back Leah Williamson kept three clean sheets through the group stages, conceding twice in six matches as England claimed a first major international trophy. Bright became a symbol of what was possible.\nThe following summer, at the World Cup, it was a similar story: England’s midfield balance off, their attack tinkered but the defence ever-reliable. Bright, this time wearing the captain’s armband, at its heart.\nWhich calls to mind how, at the 2022 Euros, as England searched for a comeback win against Spain in the quarter-finals, it was Bright, the former forward, who asked to go up top and wreaked as much havoc as possible, indirectly leading to England’s equaliser.\nAdvertisement\nThe match was a microcosm of Bright’s legacy and leadership on the pitch: undaunted, unquestioning, unsparing.\nAnd that is tiring, eventually exhausting, particularly at this level, when the overhead lights are at their brightest, the demands on the body most acute.\nSince the 2023 World Cup, her performances for England have not been perfect. But she has not shied away from that.\nHer decision to drop out of England’s Euro 2025 squad and undergo knee surgery led to some vitriolic column inches. Bright did not slink into the shadows but stood tall, insisting her decision was the correct one. She will have to do so again.\nAnd if there is a legacy to glean, it is the bravery to stand tall over and over again.",
