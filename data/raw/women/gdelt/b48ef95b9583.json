  "body_text": "How the 'greatest and worst shootout of all time' unfolded\n- Published\nLucy Bronze scored the penalty that mattered and her feelings after England's win over Sweden summed up the Lionesses' performance - and the shootout - perfectly.\nIt was both \"overwhelming and underwhelming,\" a shootout fraught with nervy moments but lacking in quality.\nOne goalkeeper saving four penalties. The other keeping out two. Three players missing the target. A keeper blasting one over the crossbar.\nAfter England dramatically restored their hopes when a Euro 2025 exit looked a near certainty, a \"stressful\" shootout victory over the Swedes earned them a spot in the semi-finals against Italy on Tuesday.\n\"I think it was just a rollercoaster, both overwhelming and underwhelming,\" Bronze told BBC Sport. \"It was just a crazy game\".\nGoalkeeper Hannah Hampton echoed Bronze's thoughts, saying it made for \"stressful watching, stressful playing\".\nShe told BBC Sport: \"Every time I saved one I was thinking 'please just put it in so we have a bit of a cushion'. Their keeper then just went and saved the next one and I was thinking 'oh goodness, here we go.'\"\nHow the shootout unfolded\nSweden 0-1 England (penalty one)\nEngland won the toss, benefiting from a shootout in front of their own fans and took the first penalty.\nUp stepped Alessia Russo, the Lionesses' trusty goal threat. Jennifer Falk dived the right way, but Russo's powerful effort never looked like being stopped.\n\"Russo has left nothing on the pitch, so to strike that as sweetly as she did - Falk went the right way, nowhere near it,\" former England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis said on BBC One.\nSweden 0-1 England (penalty two)\nHampton stood on the line, her nose bloodied from a collision in the final moments of extra time.\nFilippa Angeldahl took the first kick for Sweden and sent it towards the right but Hampton got her hands to it and made the save.\n\"She's done her homework,\" reacted Brown-Finnis. Hampton knew exactly where to go.\nSweden 0-1 England (penalty three)\nEngland couldn't make the most of their advantage.\nLauren James tried to place her effort in the bottom left corner but Falk palmed it away.\nSweden 1-1 England (penalty four)\nSweden issued the perfect response. \"Emphatic, beautifully struck,\" said Brown-Finnis.\nJulia Zigiotti Olme showed no nerves and left Hampton with no chance. Her well-struck spot-kick went into the top corner and Sweden levelled.\nSweden 1-1 England (penalty five)\nWere emotions not already running high enough, England fans were soon made even more anxious.\nBeth Mead went for the same place as James and faced the same result - Falk saved. \"It's a cushty height for the goalkeeper,\" said Brown-Finnis.\nSweden 1-1 England (penalty six)\nFrom a moment of agony to sudden hope.\nMagdalena Eriksson had the chance to put Sweden in front. Instead, her effort bounced off the right post.\nSweden 1-1 England (penalty seven)\nBy this point, Falk was beginning to look like Sweden's saviour.\nAlex Greenwood sent her penalty down the middle. Falk dived, the ball hit her and it bounced back out.\nThree of the Lionesses' four penalties saved.\nSweden 2-1 England (penalty eight)\nNathalie Bjorn put Sweden on the verge of victory, beating her Chelsea team-mate Hampton.\nEngland had to score their next.\nSweden 2-2 England (penalty nine)\nWho better than the player who had netted the winning kick in each of England's other two shootouts under Wiegman to deliver when needed?\nChloe Kelly produced her trademark run-up, with a hop and a skip before firing past Falk.\n\"What a night she is having,\" said BBC commentator Robyn Cowen.\nKelly had delivered the assist for England's first goal, then the vital cross which led to their second. Now, she'd kept their hopes of a shootout victory alive.\nSweden 2-2 England (penalty 10)\nStepping up to take Sweden's fifth penalty, to put them into the semi-finals, was none other than keeper Falk.\nShe had already saved three, so taking one as well was \"just being greedy,\" said Brown-Finnis.\nThe Sweden goalkeeper could not produce another moment of jubilation for her supporters and skied over the bar.\nSweden 2-2 England (penalty 11)\nSurely, after yet another miss, England would respond?\nNot this time. Grace Clinton's weak effort rolled to the left and Falk easily saved.\nBy this point, it looked like the shootout might never end. \"I can't believe how many penalties we've missed,\" said Brown-Finnis.\nSweden 2-2 England (penalty 12)\nSweden once again had the opportunity to win the match. Sofia Jakobsson placed the ball on the spot with just four of the 11 penalties before her having been scored.\nShe also went to the left, but Hampton tipped it on to the post with her outstretched hand.\n\"These are cats with nine lives, the Lionesses,\" Brown-Finnis said.\nSweden 2-3 England (penalty 13)\nEngland's most decorated player stepped up for the big moment.\nBronze had no intention of wasting her chance and delivered the perfect penalty, thrashing it down the middle as Falk dived to the right.\nThe Lionesses have talked throughout this tournament about producing \"proper England\" performances - and Bronze's penalty was an \"old school Stuart Pearce-type\" of kick, said Brown-Finnis.\nShe added: \"Full of passion, full of heart, no-nonsense penalty right into the roof of the net. Great strike, great player, great time.\"\nSweden 2-3 England (penalty 14)\nSweden had to score to keep their hopes alive. The job fell to 18-year-old Smilla Holmberg to try to level.\nHolmberg didn't even hit the target. She sent her strike soaring over the crossbar. The English players ran off in celebration.\nThe Lionesses were through.\nResilience, luck and subs - England's winning formula\n- Published18 July 2025\nHow history-chasing Italy could threaten England at Euro 2025\n- Published21 July 2025\n'Terrifying watching' - What the pundits said\nEngland's record goalscorer Ellen White, who was part of the team that won Euro 2022, said the shootout made for \"terrifying watching\".\nShe said: \"I think you've got to give full credit to Falk as well and the way she saved a lot of those penalties for Sweden. I'd never say a bad word about a player who's missed a penalty.\"\nEngland displayed \"character\" in an \"amazing\" show of resilience to turn it around from 2-0 down, added former England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley.\n\"Honestly that was incredible, such tension,\" Bardsley said. \"The way the game went, the substitutions, the doubt, the gameplan. So much drama.\n\"The saves from Hampton and the authority from Bronze. What a fantastic game and what character England showed. Such self-belief to bring them back into the game.\"\nIt was only a game in the last eight, but Brown-Finnis said the \"magnificent finish\" was \"worthy of any final\".\nFormer England captain Steph Houghton said the Lionesses have what it takes to get to the final.\n\"Ultimately, a massive, massive win for England to come back and take it to penalties,\" Houghton added. \"Hannah Hampton had a great game.\"\n'Greatest and worst of all time' - fans' reaction\nMaverick: After all these years we have finally found a team who were so diabolical at taking penalties that we managed to win one. Other than that massive praise to Lucy Bronze who was an absolute star tonight - her performance was outstanding in every way. A true leader.\nNB22: This must have been the greatest penalty shootout ever - and worst penalty shootout ever at the same time.\nFrankie: Bronze was immense all game and Kelly's introduction was the turning point.\nSweden could and probably should have had it sewn up by half-time.\nSurprised Bronze didn't take one of the first five pens though she did have strapping on her leg.\nHer penalty reminded me of Stuart Pearce's all those years ago.\nKyle: The penalty shootout was a comedy of errors for the most part. There were a couple of good penalties, but they were mostly dreadful, underpowered and too near the keepers.\nBoth teams look like they could do with a lot of practise in that area.\nAnyway, onwards and upwards.\n- Published24 July 2025\n- Published30 June 2025",
