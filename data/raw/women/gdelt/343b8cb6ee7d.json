Infrastructure gaps, logistical nightmares and administrative coordination across three borders were immediate concerns.\nFast forward and the ‘Pamoja’ spirit (Kiswahili for together) has not only silenced the doubters but also written a new chapter in African football’s growth narrative. With CHAN successfully staged with enthusiasm at an all-time high, all eyes now turn to what the region can deliver at the 2027 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).\nTanzania’s shining moment on home soil\nAmong the trio, Tanzania emerged as a standout host, blending passion, preparation and performance. The iconic Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam was transformed into a fortress of East African football dreams — not only serving as a world-class venue but as a symbol of the nation’s readiness for the big time.\n“CHAN gave us a dress rehearsal,” said a senior official from Tanzania’s Ministry of Sports.\n“It proved we have the spirit, the infrastructure and above all, the people to make a continental tournament successful.” Indeed, the numbers and atmosphere backed up the sentiment. Stadiums buzzed with national pride. Training grounds in Zanzibar, Arusha and Dar es Salaam, renovated to CAF standards, hosted some of the best teams in Africa’s home-based talent pool.\nFrom matchday logistics to hospitality services, Tanzania ticked box after box — albeit with lessons along the way. Success beyond scoreline The three East African nations achieved a historic feat at CHAN: All three co-hosts advanced to the quarter-finals — the first time in the tournament’s history. But the success wasn’t just on the pitch.\nTanzania used CHAN as a launchpad for larger ambitions. Major infrastructure projects — including the under-construction Samia Suluhu Hassan Stadium and upgrades to Arusha’s sports complex — are on track for AFCON 2027. But perhaps more importantly, the CHAN experience revealed Tanzania’s ability to execute a multinational sporting event with professionalism and flair.\n“We saw how sports can unify not just our country, but the entire East African region,” noted one Tanzanian football analyst. “CHAN wasn’t just about football — it was about regional integration, tourism and elevating our profile.”\nLessons learned: Not all smooth sailing\nEven a well-executed tournament has its hurdles. Attendance for non-host matches lagged, especially in larger venues. Ticketing issues — from counterfeiting to online glitches — sparked frustration.\nVisa and border challenges, especially for fans moving across the three nations, reminded organisers that the dream of seamless East African travel still needs some grounding.\nBut these were not failings — they were feedback. And with AFCON 2027 now looming large, CHAN offered a much-needed preview of what to polish.\nLooking Ahead: How to Make AFCON 2027 Unforgettable\nAFCON is a global football carnival — bigger crowds, brighter lights and the full weight of the continent’s media attention. For East Africa, the opportunity is unprecedented. But so is the pressure. Here’s how Tanzania, alongside Kenya and Uganda, can transform AFCON 2027 into a tournament the world will remember:\nFinish the Job — Infrastructure must be ready early\nThe CHAN preparation was impressive — but in some areas, rushed. For AFCON, there’s no room for last-minute fixes. Stadia like the Samia Suluhu Hassan Stadium must be completed well ahead of schedule. Arusha and Zanzibar must be matchday ready, with internationalstandard training grounds, media zones and medical facilities.\nBorderless football — ‘Pamoja Visa’ dream\nCHAN highlighted the challenges of cross-border travel. For AFCON, a special East African ‘Pamoja Visa’ — allowing fans, media and officials to move freely across all three host nations — would be a game-changer. Beyond sport, it would showcase East Africa as an integrated tourism and business destination.\nMore than matches — build fan experience\nAFCON 2027 must be a cultural and social celebration. Think fan villages, music festivals, food bazaars and interactive zones. Bring in local artists, dancers, storytellers and fashion designers.\nTanzania’s rich heritage — from Maasai traditions to Swahili coastal culture — can shine under the global spotlight.\nTech it up — seamless digital experience\nDigital ticketing, real-time stadium apps, AR/VR experiences and top-tier broadcasting setups will modernise the tournament. Tanzania should partner with regional and global tech companies to ensure fans and viewers worldwide experience the event with 21st-century flair.\nLegacy, not just glory\nTournaments end, but their impact must live on. Tanzania must ensure AFCON leaves behind usable, sustainable infrastructure. Stadiums shouldn’t become white elephants; they must serve local leagues, community sports and future generations. Investment in youth football, women’s football, and coaching should be part of the legacy. Every match in 2027 should be a brick laid toward East Africa becoming a continental football powerhouse.\nTanzania’s role: From participant to powerhouse\nTanzania is no longer just a participant in African football. With CHAN 2024 under its belt and a central role in AFCON 2027, the country has a once in-a-generation chance to assert itself as a sporting and tourism hub on the continent. But ambition must be matched with planning. The government, football federations, private sector and fans all have roles to play — from stadium readiness to grassroots support. The energy that filled Dar es Salaam during CHAN must now be harnessed, scaled and refined.\nConclusion: The East African era begins\nCHAN 2024 has proven one thing beyond doubt — East Africa is ready. The “Pamoja” spirit wasn’t just a slogan; it was a statement of intent. And now, with the continent watching, Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda have a golden opportunity to host not just a successful AFCON, but an unforgettable one.",
