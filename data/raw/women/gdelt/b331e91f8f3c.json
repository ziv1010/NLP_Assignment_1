Then we would have trained Friday and Saturday.\n\"The girls are really adaptable and those late changes only affects a couple of the players, but it does have an effect on the girls' lives because they do have to work and they do have to work around all of those extra things that you don't have to work around if you're a full-time athlete.\"\nProfessional Footballers Australia, the sport's players union, said in November poor pitches would give players more reasons to leave the A-League Women.\nThe match at 7.45pm is the second game in a Sydney FC double-header. The Sky Blues' men's team host Western United at 5pm. Double-headers present challenges of their own.\n\"It brings its own problems with spacing and the amount of time for rushed warm-ups,\" Campbell said.\n\"For example, the first game finishes then you're trying to rush to set up for a warm-up. It's nice to play those games but it then brings a lot of logistical problems. If they put too much of a gap between games then the crowd doesn't want to stay around for five, six hours at a time.\n\"I do think there needs to be some kind of answers to the problems that have been happening. It affects people's lives and it also affects the brand ... What the answer is, I'm not sure.\"\nThe Jets, ninth with five points to be two points adrift of the top six, are coming off a 2-0 loss to Adelaide in Adelaide last Sunday night.\nSydney are 11th on four points after a poor start to their title defence.\nThe Jets welcome the return of centre-back Natasha Prior from Matildas duty but forward Lara Gooch remains unavailable due to an ankle complaint.\nAmerican defender Bel Rolley is eyeing more match minutes after putting a frustrating pre-season behind her to make her A-League debut off the bench in Adelaide.\nThe 23-year-old tore the meniscus in her right knee at the start of pre-season.\n\"I was pretty grateful to make my debut after some pretty major setbacks,\" Rolley said.\nRolley joined the Jets after five years in the US college system.\n\"I definitely think there's been an adjustment and it's a sentiment I've gotten from a lot of other American players who have come over here,\" Rolley said.\n\"Obviously the game is growing, and it's growing everywhere, but in the US with the college football system we have access to a lot of recovery and facilities and you're not changing fields.\n\"You're not going from [artificial] grass to turf and back. So that was a really big adjustment of just not having access to all of the things I'm used to, especially in a time where I'm trying to get back on the field.\"",
