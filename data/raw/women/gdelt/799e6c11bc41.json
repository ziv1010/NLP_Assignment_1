We recognise the importance of safeguarding all those involved in this situation, and acknowledge the impact these allegations have on survivors of abuse.”\nUnited released the statement just over two hours before Ten Hag faced the media to preview Saturday’s match against Crystal Palace.\nAntony will not be involved in that Premier League encounter but will return to training with the group on the day of the game.\n“We make the statement, so I refer to the statement,” Ten Hag said. “I think everything has been made clear in the statement.\n“No, I don’t think it’s a distraction. We focus on the games and he will do as well.”\nAsked for details on his return, the Dutchman said: “On Saturday, he will be back in the training, so tomorrow.\n“I have to see (how fit he is), but I think, yeah (he’s fit).”\nAntony is facing several accusations of physical aggression towards his former girlfriend Gabriela Cavallin, who spoke to Brazilian outlet UOL earlier this month.\nThe winger has denied those allegations, as well as further assault claims made by Rayssa de Freitas and Ingrid Lana.\nAntony has not been arrested or charged in either Brazil or by GMP, and he left the voluntary interview, where he presented evidence to support his strenuous denials, without any restrictions.\nUnited will continue to monitor the situation while police enquiries are going on.\nA spokesperson for the charity Women’s Aid said: “We know that this morning’s news from Manchester United about their player, Antony, returning to training and selection while police inquiries continue will have an impact on survivors of domestic abuse.\n“We urge the national football organisations to work with specialist services, like Women’s Aid, to provide much-needed guidance for clubs on domestic abuse and the handling of domestic abuse cases.\n“An informed and consistent approach is vital in order to create a society where domestic abuse is not tolerated and we will be writing to the national organisations to raise this.”",
