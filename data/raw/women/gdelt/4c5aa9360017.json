  "body_text": "Moving home, Wembley glory and scoring scoops: team IAM share their 2025 highlights\nEach year, IAM’s editorial team likes to indulge in a Christmas tradition of giving a glimpse into life behind the scenes. Previous years have seen the team share their Christmas playlists, reveal family traditions and look ahead to NYE celebrations all around the world.\nThis year, we look back at what has been an astonishing 12 months for patent value creation and trade secret strategies – and we share what we have been juggling in our personal lives alongside working a busy news beat.\nHere, then, are the personal and professional highlights of team IAM for 2025. We wish all our subscribers, contacts and friends a very happy holidays.\nThe perfect whirlwind\nNicole-Anne Lagrimas\nIn January, I packed my bags and moved to Hong Kong from the Philippines to start my role as IAM’s Asia-Pacific reporter in earnest. I arrived with two large suitcases and a certainty that this year would be unlike any that came before. Sure enough, the next 12 months would prove to be a whirlwind – in the most fulfilling way possible.\nI had about a month to settle in Hong Kong before it was time to jet off to Seoul for IPBC Korea, the first IAM event I had to report from solo. Shortly after that, in March, I was briefly in Shanghai for Via Licensing Alliance’s first-ever business summit in China. Back in Hong Kong, in April, IAM hosted SEP Summit Asia, bringing together the region’s top IP strategists under one roof for two days. In between events I was busy reporting on dealmaking, litigation, patent prosecution and policy and getting to know the market more closely through our Asia IP Elite interview series. Before I knew it, it was September and I was back in Shanghai to cover IPBC China, right after which I hopped on a plane to Beijing to interview Xiaomi’s IP team. Another couple of months zipped past, and I found myself in Tokyo with IAM Editor Rachel and Deputy Editor Adam to report from a stunningly successful IPBC Asia. Over the past year, what has struck me above all else is China’s continuing ascent as a technology and IP powerhouse, and I look forward to following this trend – and its consequences – in the years to come.\nAs busy as it was, however, the year was not without its pockets of peace and quiet (back home with family and elsewhere) as well as countless opportunities to embark on fun side quests wherever I found myself.\nI ventured out into Hong Kong’s mountains and seaside villages with newfound friends, became a regular at several cha chaan teng (local diners) and cafés and shared my favourites with visiting friends and family. I was charmed by Seoul’s old palaces, astonished by the Great Wall of China, and mesmerised by the fall foliage and the lakes surrounding the majestic Mt. Fuji. It has been a great year for me by many measures, but it is the sight of the twinkling blue water of Lake Kawaguchiko, at the base of Japan’s highest peak, as I cycled around it on a clear autumn afternoon that would be the best image of 2025 I am carrying into the new year. It is certainly the vibe I am internalising as I take my holiday break with my family at home!\nSinging to a reimagined beat\nAngela Morris\nOver the past two years, IAM’s staff has grown, and new colleagues have trained and developed the expertise to cover the global patent and trade secret landscape comprehensively. Having them on board gifted me the ability to reimagine my beat with a new focus on US patent policy, secondary patent market transactions and patent-based businesses. Excitement abounded this year in the US intellectual property policy world, allowing me to observe developments like the Senate’s confirmation of US Patent and Trademark Office Director John Squires and his dramatic takeover of the inter partes review institution process and rules proposal to reduce serial and parallel IPRs.\nI also write a monthly data column highlighting the largest US patent transactions that parties recorded with the USPTO the previous month. The work has opened my eyes to the myriad business reasons that companies buy and sell patents, from M&As to bankruptcies to patent monetisation. We have also featured large, unique transactions like Sandisk’s transfer of more than 200 assets to Samsung, and Xerox selling a 3,000-patent portfolio to IPValue Management.\nOne part of my new beat that I enjoy most is talking with business owners whose revenue models centre on patent licensing or buy-sell transactions, like Strong Force Innovation Portfolios or Ofinno. It is equally rewarding to speak with IP chiefs who lead their emerging technology companies – such as humanoid robotics firm Sanctuary AI and quantum computing innovator IonQ – to capture a leading patent position, setting them up to seize shares of lucrative future markets.\nI guess you could say that I am singing the praises of IP-rich organisations around the world.\nSpeaking of singing praises, there is a personal achievement in 2025 that I would love to highlight: I joined the “Celebration Choir” at my church, Hays Hills Baptist Church in Buda, Texas. I sing in the sopranos section with eight other women. We perform every Sunday at our church’s first service and practice each Sunday afternoon. The climax of the 2025 season was a Christmas performance on 7 December. Butterflies fluttered in my stomach as I sang in a duet with a bass singer for part of the song, “Prince of Heaven (A Christmas Worship Moment)”.\nBeing in choir – which feels like a family-away-from-home – motivated me to learn to read music. I added music lessons to my repertoire on Duolingo, where I’ve achieved an Elementary-language proficiency in Spanish after studying for two years (I can nearly boast of a 600-day streak!). Although I have a long way to go to learn to read music fluently, I am enjoying every step of the journey.\nA crash course in Britain’s quirky property market\nMaia Biermann\nThe year 2025 has been eventful and will be remembered for many reasons. In my professional life, the highlight was pulling together the IAM Special Report “Unlocking Trade Secret Strategies”. It was more than just a compilation – it felt like curating a global conversation among some of the sharpest minds across leading IP jurisdictions. From seasoned litigators to in-house strategists, the voices we brought together offered practical insights and bold predictions on how innovation can be safeguarded through robust trade secret frameworks.\nSeeing the report go live and hearing from readers who found it genuinely useful was deeply rewarding. It reminded me why I love this beat: the mix of law, business and human ingenuity. Plus, the process gave me an excuse to reconnect with old contacts and make new ones – always the best part of the job.\nIf the professional side was smooth sailing, the personal one felt like navigating the Thames in a stormy weather. In late October, my family – Florian, Albert and I – sold our house in Nottingham, the city of Robin Hood and lace-making heritage, and moved to Peterborough, home to its magnificent cathedral and quiet riverside walks.\nThe goal was a shorter commute to London. The reality? A crash course in the peculiar rituals of the UK property market. Viewings, surveys, solicitors… I’m convinced house selling here deserves its own BBC drama. Florian could probably publish a thick novel made up entirely of the endless chain of lengthy – and occasionally two-word – emails we’ve exchanged since this house-moving journey began last Christmas week, when the advert first went live.\nAlbert is doing his best to make new friends, but he still aches for his Nottingham friends and familiar streets. So much so that he banned us from mentioning our favourite nearby country park where we spent countless afternoons – hundreds of walks overlooking the city from the hilltop, in rain, snow or fiery sunsets. Leaving those memories behind is harder than I imagined.\nNow, as we sit in our new kitchen, planning Christmas and laughing about the chaos of the past months, I’ve realised it’s perfectly fine to begin a new adventure with a little upheaval.\nHere’s to a season of new beginnings, old traditions, and the hope that 2026 brings fewer moving boxes and more moments to celebrate together. Merry Christmas from our family to yours!\nBoardroom interviews to the bright lights of Broadway\nNisha Shetty\nMy professional highlight was interviewing some fascinating people in the IP world.\nI always enjoy talking to people about their life and the work they do. This year, my favourite interviews were with Björn Norberg, the IP director at H&M; Chris Storm, the then head of IP at Uber; and Mallory Factor, the CEO of pharmaceutical company IntraBio.\nNorberg shared a great anecdote about drafting the company's licence agreement with Karl Lagerfeld, kicking off over 20 years of collaborations with famous fashion designers. He explained how patents were a part of H&M strategy, and how the company enforces trademarks and copyrights.\nStorm revealed how Uber and Waymo went from the opposite sides of the court in patent infringement and trade secret cases to becoming partners in Uber's self-driving vehicle programme. He went into great depth about how IP licensing works when partnering with multiple self-driving companies, as well as how he managed Uber's patent portfolio.\nFactor talked about how IntraBio found itself in the unusual position of fighting copycats within the first year of the start-up's drug exclusivity period. He discussed how the company would continue to bring enforcement actions to protect its investments, and how it achieved positive cash flow. He also delighted in telling me about his hobby: producing Broadway shows.\nThat brings me to my personal highlight of attending four Broadway shows this year: The Picture of Dorian Gray, John Proctor is the Villain, Oedipus and Maybe Happy Ending.\nMy very first show might have been Othello but after seeing the poor reviews, I put my ticket up for bidding on the Theatr app, where people can buy and sell tickets. I received a few low bids but sold it for just one dollar less than the high sum I paid. I was proud of my negotiating skills and narrated this to my editors at IPBC Global 2025, but Trevor was terribly displeased to hear that I had got rid of a ticket to see Denzel Washington.\nAmong the shows I did watch, my absolute favourite was The Picture of Dorian Gray. It was a phenomenal one-woman performance where Succession actress Sarah Snook played 26 characters. No notes. She deservingly won a Tony.\nAfter the play, I got to talk to her and got a photo. She graciously chatted with everyone who met her, every single night for three-and-a-half months. That’s rare for someone so famous. Also, what if she got a cold from someone? There was no understudy! But she never missed a show. For me, meeting her was a highlight within a highlight because her down-to-earthness impressed me as much as her acting.\nA roller coaster of reporting\nAdam Houldsworth\n2025 has gone by in a flash and another year of IP journalism is coming to an end. The past 12 months have been as interesting as any I can remember in terms of patent developments – and it has been a pleasure to break some of the year’s most important IP news stories and to provide insights into their significance.\nPerhaps most interesting of all has been to report and analyse the dramatic twists and turns in SEP/FRAND law, litigation and licensing, especially in the UK and across Europe where developments have been frequent and highly significant.\nIAM was the first to report that BYD had taken a 4G Avanci licence, that the English High Court’s had issued interim licence declarations against Ericsson and ZTE, that Samsung and Lenovo had asked ETSI to remove patents from its cellular standards, and that the European Commission had confirmed the withdrawal of its highly controversial SEP regulation.\nWe also broke the news that the English Court of Appeal had increased the royalties owed by Apple to Optis by almost ten times, that Tesla had been granted permission to appeal to the UK Supreme Court in its attempt to set a new rate for the Avanci 5G platform, and that ACT/The App Association had withdrawn its ETSI membership application.\nWhen not gripped by these developments or immersed in efforts to understand their significance, I have spent much of the year travelling between IAM’s events.\nIt was a great pleasure to visit Tokyo, Boston and Hong Kong for the first time in 2025. But the event-related highlight for me was IAM’s inaugural “Navigating the UPC” conference, which took place in Paris last month.\nWith 12 UPC judges on the speaking faculty, alongside key decision-makers from companies involved in many of the most interesting cases at the new court, the event was one of the best IAM gatherings I can remember in terms of the quality of its discussions and networking opportunities.\nOutside of work, the highlight of 2025 for me was my eldest daughter Rosa starting school – a clear reminder of how quickly she is growing up! She was born in mid-2021, just a few months before I became deputy editor of IAM, so her first months of school have also been a reminder of how quickly time flies in the world of patent journalism!\nWork wins and Wembley glory\nTrevor Little\nReflecting on professional and personal highlights from 2025 is a challenge, as professionally there have been many highlights I could choose.\nOne would be every day working with the IAM and WTR content teams, who really are best-in class, and continue to break stories and present analysis you just can’t find anywhere else.\nAnother would be contributing to IAM’s IPBC series of events, which have hit record numbers for attendance this year (but really, my contribution was very small and the success of the events is down to my colleagues in event production, operations and marketing, so I can’t claim that one).\nI could go on.\nThe personal highlight, by contrast, is easy. Watching my beloved Crystal Palace football club win the FA Cup, the first trophy in its history.\nCrystal Palace is not used to winning. Anything. Ever. My previous FA Cup Final visit to Wembley saw us lead for three glorious minutes – before Manchester United responded, and then won in extra time. This year, against Manchester City, it was a classic case of hope rather than expectation.\nAnd in truth, I shouldn’t have been at Wembley Stadium on the day. I had long previously booked my flights to land in San Diego two days before the game, to attend the largest IP event in the calendar. That too was a professional highlight – being among more than 10,000 IP professionals at the INTA Annual Meeting, catching up with old (and making new) friends, celebrating the success of corporate brand teams at the WTR Industry Awards, and having the opportunity to discuss evolving industry trends with those at the sharp end of them.\nThat I was able to be at Wembley brings me back to working with the best team in the business. While I suffered the angst of potentially missing that first trophy win, it was my colleagues – in our IP editorial team and also senior managers I work with – that pushed me to change flights, miss the first 48 hours of the event in San Diego and prioritise potential football glory over work. I won’t name them – they know who they are. But they deserve a hat tip for ensuring I experienced one of the top three days of my life (along with the day I got married and the day my son was born – but please don’t ask me to rank them in order as I could get into serious trouble at home).\nSo, as Rachel asked me to write about a professional and personal highlight, I am going to go with that one brilliant week in May. Seeing Crystal Palace win, and a little over 24 hours later landing in San Diego to head out for four days of meetings, receptions and insights into the evolving IP landscape at the INTA Annual Meeting.\nSame again next year? The INTA Annual Meeting is in London, so another trip to Wembley would certainly be much easier logistically…\nMyth, momentum and milestones\nRachel Mountain\nHave you ever been to Zennor? It’s so small you could easily miss it – a tiny enclave of houses surrounding a church cushioned near the furthermost tip of the Cornish coast, where the blue-green sea crashes mercilessly into barren rocks. It’s a remote and haunting place, laden with hundreds of years of lore about the mysterious disappearance of young villager Mathy Trewella. Said to have the sweetest singing voice in the church choir, legend has it Mathy was lured out to sea by a beautiful mermaid, never to be seen again. But the Mermaid of Zennor is frozen in time, her likeness carved in the fifteenth century into a wooden pew you can still see in the church today. In September, I found myself in St Senara’s Church, looking at that very pew and absorbing the odd stillness of the place. It was a day that will stay with me for a long time. For more than 20 years I have been holidaying with my friends in Cornwall, and as I scrambled over the coastal path to Pendour Cove, where Mathy and the mermaid swum out to sea, I had the luxury of pausing, breathing in the salty air and stealing a moment of time. Those who know me know I find it hard to put the brakes on. It was a moment spun out of something rare, the enchanting myth and the ancient coast had weaved their magic.\nPausing is one thing, but back in the city I thrive when the speed is really cranked up. Good job really – IAM has been moving apace this year and I look back on 2025 with immense pride in the product and the phenomenal team that delivers it.\nAmong many changes, this was the year we launched our reimagined flagship IPBC events. It is at those events that I meet the most vital part of IAM: you. It’s truly a community that cares – you show up, you tell us what you think and you let us in to your world. You cannot underestimate how grateful we are for that.\nOne of the ways we recognise those who have made an outstanding contribution to the development of IP law and practice is the IP Hall of Fame and, stood on our main stage at IPBC Global in Boston, honouring Eeva Hakoranta, Manny Schecter and Rochelle Dreyfuss in Boston counts among my top moments of the year. After, a colleague tells me she heard my voice crack slightly – it’s true, I felt the swell of goodwill in the room and, perhaps embarrassingly, had to hold back a tear.\nAs we put our pens down for Christmas, I’d like to thank my brilliant team – you all know them well. They brought you scoops you cannot find elsewhere, championed your voices and worked tirelessly to deliver what makes IAM special: truly independent, insightful reporting on the wonderful, complex and sometimes mind-boggling world of patents and trade secrets. Happy holidays all!",
