Notifications go to administration and the resource officer's phones to alert them that there may be activity in the restroom. The system also has a tamper alert.\n\"The whole point of this is not a 'gotcha,' we're not trying to 'get' our students,\" Wolf said. He explained that they'd be open to adding signs to remind students that the sensors are there.\nThe HALO sensor provides real-time air quality and health index alerts to administrators using carbon dioxide, temperature, and humidity detection, according to the company's website.\nWolf said in the five weeks of the trial, of 27 school days, the program registered about 7,000 total alerts, however, many of the alerts were back-to-back and related to the same incidents, having been triggered seconds apart.\nOf those, about 237 were identified as unique events meaning they were over five minutes apart. Of those three events, only three were identified as THC-related. Instead, the most common alert was for the people count, which is currently set for three people at a time. The People count is designed to detect possible instances of bullying, fighting or smoking.\nAdministration response in the men's restroom was higher overall, but Wolf said it's because the resource officer covering at lunch duty is a man and can get to the restroom faster. The first two days, Wolf said there were six THC vape alerts and the next few days there were less than half of it. The girl's side the average didn't change, but they also didn't have the same early intervention.\n\"The whole reason we got these in the first place is because we were reliant on student and teacher reports,\" Wolf said.\nNo decision was made by the board on whether they will continue the program or expand it to other areas of the school or other schools in the district. The trial ends this week.\nTIER 3 ONLINE COUNSELING\nGoshen High School is considering adding a Tier 3 psychiatric care support system to its arsenal of mental health services available to students.\nMore in U.S.\nGoshen Community Schools Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction Tracey Noe explained that while the district has partnerships with Oaklawn and the Bowen Center, not enough students are being supported, there are waitlists, and as far as the school is aware, not enough students are able to attend Bowen.\nIn 2022-23, 246 students were serviced through Oaklawn, 62 more students were seen in small groups during school or in other situations, and Bowen did not give numbers.\nNoe said a lack of available providers and very long waitlists are a main reason that kids can't get psychiatric care, and poor mental health is a contributing factor to chronic absenteeism, poor grades and other problems.\nCartwheel is a possible solution. The all-virtual-based therapy program offered a licensed therapist and case manager to any referred student in the district within seven to 10 days of the referral. Around 40% of the therapists are bilingual, with 10 languages on staff.\nCartwheel's program refers all families to a case manager within 24 hours of referral and every district is also provided a clinical program manager who works alongside the administration team.\nNoe said when talking with Goshen school counselors, they said they could easily fill 100 reserved slots with Cartwheel, and the program would also allow for staff members with district insurance to receive mental health care.\nThe company accepts all insurance and Medicaid and also has opportunities for families that do not have insurance.\nFor families with younger children who may struggle with virtual meetings, parents are instead trained to guide them through a treatment plan. Cartwheel is also able to offer outpatient and medication management but does not provide controlled substances, and does not offer counseling for eating disorders, substance abuse, active psychosis, and non-verbal patients.\nNo action was taken during the board meeting.\nELECTION FRAUD CONTROVERSY RESPONSES\nTwo Goshen School Board members spoke regarding the election fraud cases during the board's Monday night meeting.\nSchool board member Mario Garber spoke about his recent election fraud court case. Garber was sentenced in mid-November and his charge was amended down the misdemeanor status, as many of the defendants in the mailer controversy were. During the school board meeting on Monday, Garber apologized for his part, and he thanked the board and the community for their support.\n\"It was unintentional, what happened with the campaign finance, but still, rules were broken, and I feel like I need to take responsibility for that,\" Garber said. \"We've been doing so many good things over the last year and this has kind of been a cloud over that.\"\nGarber said he doesn't feel the need to step down from the board, but that stepping down from his appointment as board secretary would be moot, given that appointments are redetermined in January at the next board meeting.\n\"I would like to stay on the board if that's possible,\" Garber said.\nGarber was among five individuals involved in the allegations, and one who was recently sentenced. The other who was recently sentenced was Roger Nafziger, who has been suffering from medical problems during recent months and stepped down as board president as a result.\nReplacing him as board president was Bradd Weddell, who also read a statement.\n\"I've been asked why a statement has not been made by this board regarding those charges and why the non-involved board members have not taken any action against chose charged,\" he read. \"My simple answer is I felt, and I still feel, it was our responsibility to focus on our students and the staff of Goshen Community Schools. Each individual was due their day in court and the board making a statement would not have influenced the outcome.\"\nWeddell encouraged anyone dissatisfied with the outcome of the cases to speak with the prosecutor or the judge.\n\"This board had no influence on that outcome,\" he reiterated.\nOTHER BOARD ITEMS\n—Goshen Community Schools is working toward creating its own version of the entrepreneurship program in Elkhart, Startup Moxie. Goshen High School Principal Cathy Demeyer said while Goshen students already attend the Elkhart-based program, many cannot attend it due to transportation issues.

He started Dec. 3.\n—Goshen High School Band Director Tom Cox was honored for being the winner of the Dr. William P.
