Limited game time under Gareth Taylor this season has intensified speculation around a January move as Kelly faces a battle to keep her place in Sarina Wiegman's England squad ahead of Euro 2025 in Switzerland in July.\nMounting injuries in forward areas at City could prove to be a significant stumbling block if Kelly does seek a loan or permanent move away this month. Khadija Shaw, Lauren Hemp and Vivianne Miedema are among those who have suffered injury problems in recent months, although the latter was back in action off the bench over the weekend for City's FA Cup win over Ipswich Town.\nIn the win over Ipswich, Kelly made her first start since the 3-2 triumph over St. Polten in the Champions League back in October and it was her first full 90 minutes since September. In total, the winger has made just four starts across all competitions so far this season, and just one of those have come in the WSL\nIf Kelly is to push for a move this month, 90min has assessed and ranked the potential destinations for the England international with one eye on the Euros on the horizon…\n5. Tottenham Hotspur\nIf a short-term WSL loan move is on the cards, that would almost certainly rule out any of the teams competing at the top end of the table. Even if Kelly isn't to extend her stay at City, the last thing they will want to do is strengthen a direct rival at such a crucial point in the campaign.\nTottenham do have some competition for places on the right side of their attack, with Jess Naz battling for a place in the England squad as well. But, Robert Vilahamn could do with some additional fire power and the success of Grace Clinton's loan from Manchester United last season potentially makes the north London club an ideal destination for any player.\nKelly's history as a former Arsenal player probably wouldn't come into it.\n4. Everton\nFurther down the table, Kelly could return to her former club in Everton and the close proximity between Liverpool and Manchester means she likely wouldn't need to uproot herself for a short-term switch.\nBrian Sorensen's side are in desperate need of reinforcements for the second half of the season after being struck by numerous injuries, but they have been the busiest of all the clubs in the early weeks of this window.\nWith four players already through the door at Walton Hall Park, including striker Kelly Gago from Nantes, it remains to be seen whether they would push ahead with rumoured interest in Kelly.\n3. Barcelona\nAlso on a short-term basis, Barcelona could enter the market this month. The Champions League holders recently confirmed an injury to wide forward Caroline Graham Hansen, who is experiencing muscle discomfort, and have not confirmed a return date for the Norway international.\nDepending on the extent of Graham Hansen's injury, a loan move for Kelly could ensure the Liga F giants are able to remain competitive on all fronts for the remainder of the season.\nFormer City teammate Keira Walsh has called Barcelona home since 2022, while Lucy Bronze and Toni Duggan have also represented the club.\n2. Wolfsburg\nElsewhere in Europe, German side Wolfsburg remain one of the giants of the women's game. Like Kelly, one of their star players Jule Brand is out of contract in the summer and faces an uncertain future.\nThe 22-year-old will be a tough figure to replace and a potential departure could open up a place in Tommy Stroot's squad. If a January move is on the table for Kelly, Wolfsburg could come knocking to future-proof their own squad ahead of the summer.\n1. Paris Saint-Germain\nParis Saint-Germain's reported interest in Kelly has dampened in recent months after initial rumours as far back as last year indicated they were keen on the winger. However, they did pursue Mary Earps on a free transfer from Manchester United last summer, and so could look to repeat a similar trick when Kelly's deal expires at the end of the campaign.\nStar PSG striker Marie-Antoinette Katoto is in the final few months of her own deal, so decisions will need to be made in Paris sooner rather than later.",
