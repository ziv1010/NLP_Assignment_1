  "body_text": "Summary\n- Polygamy leads to hidden thoughts and feelings, and those in plural marriages may get hurt.\n- Robyn Brown fat-shamed her fellow sister wives. Her behavior is manipulative and disrespectful.\n- Janelle, Christine, and Meri are thriving after leaving Kody. They're getting glam and branching out. All look sleek and sophisticated after weight-loss journeys.\nPetite and seemingly demure, Sister Wives villain Robyn Brown usually keeps her claws sheathed, but she went for the jugular when she fat-shamed Meri, Janelle and Christine Brown. Offscreen, Kody's three former spouses are all about exploring life after polygamy, although it has to be said that their spiritual unions with Kody were basically shams. That's not their fault - they tried, but Kody's all-consuming passion for Robyn made it pretty hard for them to get their needs met. Now, they're posing at Instagram, and letting the world know that leaving Kody is the ultimate beauty secret.\nSister Wives season 18 shows why polygamy never works. Some people involved pretend to be happy, but there's a seamy underbelly. Beneath the surface, there are hidden thoughts and feelings. In this type of group arrangement, someone will get hurt. It's human nature to pair up, if only for a while, and human nature isn't going to change because a Mormon sect's leader decides that a husband and multiple wives can coexist. The husband will pick a favorite wife - then, the other women will feel dissed and begin to store up rage. When their anger boils over, it sets the stage for the kind of mayhem that unfolded this season.\nSister Wives' Robyn Brown Talked About \"Stretch Marks\" & \"Weight Gain\"\nRobyn Brown Went Way Too Far\nOn January 8, 2023, the show's One on One special aired, and that's when Robyn decided that commenting on the bodies of her \"beloved\" sister wives was a smart move. This was a rare deviation from the passive-aggressive tactics that she typically employs. Sobbin' Robyn wasn't turning on the waterworks to get a specific result. Nor was Queen Robyn whispering behind the tapestries to King Kody, uttering the kinds of \"sweet nothings\" that strongly influence him, leading to some very sketchy decisions. This time, Robyn actually said what was on her mind. Her statements say a lot about her character:\n\"When I came into this family, I knew and I saw when there's stretch marks and there's weight gain ... and there’s like — you're being stagnant in your marriage and there’s fights and money problems or whatever it is ... He still had this romance going with each of them.\"\nWhere does Robyn get off talking about the other wives that way? She's always pretending that she adores them. Robyn shifts all blame for their horrible dynamics with Kody to the \"man of the house.\" However, a woman who's willing to say this stuff about her immediate family right in front of everyone is not going to talk nicely behind the scenes. Nor is she going to sit quietly while Kody tries to make things better with her rivals. So, what will she do? Well, she'll use every single weapon in her arsenal to ensure that Kody still has truly awful relationships with his \"other\" wives.\nShame on Robyn. This stuff should be beneath her. She says she's a Christian, but ripping apart the women who bore Kody's children (and maybe got some stretch marks and extra pounds in the process) is the absolute lowest.\nPerhaps Robyn's blessed with a fast metabolism. That may be the reason why she's so stunningly arrogant. Or maybe she has the kind of steely self-discipline that makes resisting boozy beverages, sweet treats and salty, crunchy snacks a total breeze. Regardless, meek and mild Robyn showed the evil within when she decided to cut down the other Brown women. Does she talk about their bodies to Kody? Probably. Imagine the type of trash talk that goes on when it's just the two of them!\nSister Wives Janelle Brown Lost 100 Pounds\nIs Cruel Robyn Brown The Reason Why?\nJanelle knows that assuming, \"makes an a*ss out of you and me,\" as the saying goes. In her Instagram post, Janelle's face is noticeably thinner and she looks so relaxed. Fresh-faced and rosy in a mauve top, she talks about challenging her assumptions and encourages others to do the same. Her post-split demeanor is positive and chilled-out. In contrast, during Sister Wives season 18, she looked so tired. She wasn't as fit, and her emotions were all showing on the outside. Janelle's frayed nerves, bad temper, and exasperation were on full display, not that anyone could blame her.\nMaybe she'll never be as doll-like as Robyn, but does she have to be? Janelle's energy is so different. She's earthy, practical, upfront. Her curves give her a womanly vibe that suits her perfectly. Every body shape is beautiful - all women are beautiful. It's just that some people don't have the sensitivity to find beauty in what's different or unexpected. Janelle looks wonderful right now, but she's always been an attractive woman. Now, she doesn't need to compete with the sort of person who publicly fat-shames other people. She can just do her own thing.\nChristine Brown Has Never Appreciated Robyn Brown\nThe Feeling Is Perhaps Mutual\nVia TLC at YouTube, Christine Brown made Texas brownies with Mykelti Padron, and while she created the tantalizing treats, she looked fabulous. Decked out in a bright blue sweater, Christine was quite done up for her baking tutorial. She wore hot pink lipstick and curled her hair. Christine showed off a sleek midsection as she chatted with her daughter. Christine knows how to enjoy life and that's probably her most winning quality. However, she also knows how to love other people. That's why it's great that she's out of Kody and Robyn's clutches. Those two can be so cold.\nNow, Christine can warm her new husband David Woolley's heart. She can cook for him, bake for him, watch football with him and so much more. Hopefully, he'll make her feel special too. He seems to be giving her exactly what she needs. She's never looked better, and it's not a weight thing. It's just the kind of happiness that radiates. Christine's brave and she transformed her life, step by step. The first step was surely the scariest. Perhaps she might have ended up alone and stigmatized after \"losing her religion\" by fleeing her miserable marriage to cranky Kody. Fans might have turned on her.\nEverything could have gone dangerously awry. Instead, it's all sunshine and roses. And that's just what Christine deserves, no matter what she weighs. She's hung onto her faith too - she's just over polygamy. What really stands out about Christine is the way she believes in herself and in being happy. She did what it took to make her life enjoyable. That's why she's such an unlikely feminist icon. She's the unloved sister wife who shivered in the darkness before going into the light. Now, she can do anything.\nMeri Brown's Connecting With Her Inner Goddess After A Nightmare Relationship\nMeri Looks So Energized & Alive\nMeri looks so amazing lately. Of course, she always looked great, but right now, she's got some type of Hollywood glam thing happening. The word \"glowing\" is overused, but in this case, it's completely appropriate. Photos of Meri celebrating Thanksgiving 2023 went viral because she looks so different. One of them is shown above.\nGetting away from Kody unlocked the fountain of youth. Meri's slim, she's smiling and her hair and shirt are so flattering. It's almost unbelievable how much of a difference leaving a man can make. It really underscores how draining troubled relationships can be. Kody was wrong for her - he emotionally abandoned her years ago. In season 18, he was so dismissive of Meri. He couldn't even muster up the energy to get angry with her like he did with Janelle.\nReally, their relationship ended long ago, as Meri and Kody haven't authentically connected for years. However, the fact that they're formally \"apart\" seems to have energized Meri. Somehow, it's made her feel so much better. It doesn't matter that things aren't technically that different. All that really matters is the fact that Meri's happier now. Again, she's clearly lost weight, but that's the byproduct of stepping away from years of misery. It's the end result of letting go of false hopes and putting herself first. It's so awesome to see Meri at her best. She's been through a lot.\nThe Sister Wives exes are so glam, they're like Charlie's Angels, but they're certainly not Kody's angels anymore. He's got the prize that is fat-shaming Robyn. However, Kody and Robyn are so in tune, as he can be just as crass as his delicate flower of a wife. Sister Wives season 18 was like a rollercoaster that no one ever wants to ride again. The twists and turns were sickening rather than exciting. Now, the exes, who are looking great, can find ways to have fun that don't involve a certain patriarch. From the looks of it, they're a lot happier now than they were before, and happiness is the name of the game.\nSources: TLC/YouTube, Janelle Brown/Instagram",
