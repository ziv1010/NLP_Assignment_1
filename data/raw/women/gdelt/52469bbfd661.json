  "body_text": "Emma Hayes backs Jonas Eidevall over technology debate | Chelsea ready for Man City test\nBy Sean Walsh\nChelsea boss Emma Hayes has leapt to the defence of Arsenal counterpart Jonas Eidevall after he criticised the inconsistent use of technology in women's football.\nThe Gunners were beaten 1-0 by Bayern Munich in the first leg of their Women's Champions League quarter-final in midweek.\nIn defeat, Arsenal saw two efforts cleared off the line, though Eidevall was dubious as to whether they had gone in and was left angry over the lack of goal-line technology in use at the Allianz Arena.\n\"Goal-line technology is something that you can use at any stage, but it is not compulsory. Today it was not in use because Bayern choose not to pay for it.\n\"Next week at the Emirates, Arsenal have choose to use it, because we think it is fair for the competition. It is a problem for the competition that not every game has the same level of technology.\"\nHayes was quizzed about Eidevall's comments at a press conference on Friday and chose to side with the Swede on this issue.\n\"He's right. It should be the same for every team. If we're all at the mens' stadiums, we should all have exactly the same setups. He's right,\" she said.\nREAD NEXT\n- How to watch every WSL Women's Football Weekend game on TV\n- Women's Football Weekend: What's at stake for every WSL club\n- Man City vs Chelsea - WSL preview: TV channel, live stream, team news & prediction\nEmma Hayes: Man City title clash is just another game for Chelsea\nHayes was speaking to the press ahead of Chelsea's trip to title rivals Manchester City in the WSL on Sunday - one of the landmark fixtures on Women's Football Weekend.\nBut the 46-year-old was quick to play down the fanfare of the event.\n\"It's just another game. You guys [the media] spend time building up the drama, my job is preparing the team to be ready for the task,\" Hayes said. \"We have one training session tomorrow, everybody's recovering today. I'm sure the group will be ready.\n\"I can [manage a busy schedule]. I have years of experience doing this, an unbelievably brilliant staff team that are around the players, a group that understand our culture and the way that we work, the recovery protocols, the nutrition and sleep protocols that become so central to recovery.\n\"As I said before, we're so used to being in this position.\"",
