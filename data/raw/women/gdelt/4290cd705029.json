As they should be, I’m going to say this again — I love our fans. I’m good with the criticism. You know, some of it is warranted. You cannot step on that floor and not bring it. I’m not running from that.”\nMaybe he should. I don’t know. The statement that drew the most criticism after Louisville’s exhibition loss was one in which he said, “We can’t beat teams with talent. We’re never going to be the most talented team.”\nHe later amplified that statement in a postgame interview with Bob Valvano, and referred to it again on Sunday morning.\n“I made a statement and I mean this with all my heart,” Payne said. “We’re not beating teams with talent. Does that mean we’re not talented? No. There is no coach in the world that says, ‘I want to beat you with my talent.’ Coaches want to beat you with their work ethic, their toughness, their attention to detail. That’s what I’m saying.”\nAs for his team, Payne said the practices since the loss to KWC have been “hard,” and that he recognizes the outsized importance of Monday’s opener, “for the confidence of the guys. I think it’s important for the morale of the guys that we go out and play with great energy.”\n“I think they understood the importance of the reality of it,” Payne said. “And that is, you can beat anybody, but anybody can beat you. There’s a lot of quote-unquote Division II schools, or small schools or whatever you want to call them, that has fifth- or sixth-year players that know how to play and they’ve been doing this a while and they’re not afraid of you. And you’ve got to go out and impose your will and play desperate. If you think because you’re at Louisville you’re automatically better, that’s not the case. So, I think they learned that one, they can never relax, two, how important the details are. And then, you know, playing with confidence and energy and playing together, what that looks like, and what that means to winning.”\n—Michael McCammon of Cardinal Authority previews Louisville-UMBC.\n—Alexis Cubit of the CJ has three takeaways from Louisville’s 34-3 triumph over VT.\n—Underrated aspect of this football season: Louisville has absolutely dominated the coin toss.\n—And finally, beat UMBC and beat Cincinnati.",
