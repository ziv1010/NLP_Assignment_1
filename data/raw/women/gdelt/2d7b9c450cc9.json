  "body_text": "In February 2000, the Côte d’Ivoire national football team found itself confined for days inside a military camp after crashing out of the African Cup of Nations.\nHaving lifted the trophy in 1992, and with Ivorians accustomed to seeing their stars play for high-performing European clubs, the nation expected nothing less than another commanding victory.\nInstead, the 2000 tournament, co-hosted by Nigeria and Ghana, became a progressively shameful procession: a 2–0 win over Ghana, a draw with Togo, and then a 3–0 humiliation at the hands of the Lions of Cameroon.\nUpon their return, the Elephants were prepared for disapproving stares and, at worst, an awkward press conference at the airport. What they did not know was that the head of the ruling military junta, General Robert Guéï, was not only an ardent supporter but also a man unwilling to confine his disappointment to mere complaints.\nRather than grumble like everyone else, Guéï backed his displeasure with an order: arrest the players and send them to a military camp.\nAt the camp, the squad were reportedly stripped of their passports, mobile phones and other belongings. For two days, they ran drills, did push-ups and sat through lectures on civics and love of country.\nTo the media, the junta insisted the players were being shielded from angry fans. Yet there were no mobs on the streets, no angry crowds at the airport. If anything, the nation seemed ready to move on, everyone, that is, except the junta.\nLeaks soon revealed that General Guéï had personally authorised the detention. The junta’s spokesman said, “After being humiliated in the first round, the Elephants needed to be taught a civic lesson because the players were indisciplined.” Friends of the team hurried to the camp to plead for their release.\nAmong them was former star Basile Boli, who reminded the officers that many of the players were bound by contracts in Europe and that clubs would soon be asking awkward questions about their missing players.\nEventually, all 22 were freed, unharmed but traumatised. Nevertheless, the junta felt they needed one more civic class from the Head of State himself. In that meeting, an irate Guéï reportedly declared: “I asked that you be taken down there so you could reflect a while. You behaved unworthily. You should have avoided such shame. Next time, you will stay there for military service. You will be sent to the barracks until a sense of civic pride gets into your heads.”\nAs one BBC dispatch concluded on February 2, 2000, the episode showed once more that football in much of Africa is “not so much a sport as a religion.”\nThat same year, Nigeria’s Super Eagles reached the final against Cameroon and lost 4–3 on penalties.\nLast year, the Eagles again battled for the crown, this time against hosts Côte d’Ivoire, only to fall short. Not so for their female counterparts.\nFor the 10th time, the Super Falcons have lifted the Women’s African Cup of Nations. For many Nigerians, the latest win bore even greater significance, as it meant rallying from two goals down at halftime to defeat the host country, Morocco, 3–2.\nThroughout the tournament, the women remained undefeated, with only one draw. Understandably, they received a grand reception last Monday at the Aso Rock Villa, where President Bola Tinubu announced national honours, cash rewards of up to N160m each, and house gifts.\nThese gestures have sharply divided the country in the past week. On one hand, a grateful nation appreciates the victory. On the other, the rewards appeared too extravagant, especially compared to the treatment of those who have sacrificed more for the country.\nTinubu’s gesture came just days after a nationwide protest by retired policemen against what they described as poor treatment and humiliating pension payments.\nOn July 21, 2025, the ex-officers demanded their removal from the Contributory Pension Scheme, which they claimed had been short-changing them.\nHowever, the Special Adviser to the President on Information and Strategy, Bayo Onanuga, said critics are linking the reward to unrelated issues.\nHe said, “As much as there has been criticism on this, there has also been praise, lots of praise. In fact, more praise for that gesture. Let’s not complicate matters. We cannot link the reward given to the Super Falcons to other things. I’ve read someone saying that the money can pay for 16,000 doctors.\n“They’re two different things. You can’t link it to ex-servicemen and women’s payments. They’re different issues. Let’s not mix them up. The President and the country were proud of those girls’ achievement, for the 10th time. So, this was at the back of the President’s mind when he was showering them with those gifts. He rewarded them for their hard work, their spirit on the field of play. That’s the reason.”",
