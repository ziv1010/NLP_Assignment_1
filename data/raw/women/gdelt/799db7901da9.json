  "body_text": "FanCode, the sports content platform owned by Dream11 parent Dream Sports, has expanded its broadcast partnership with Formula 1 through a new three-year deal, making it the home for the sport in the Indian subcontinent until the end of the 2028 season.\nAs part of the extended agreement, users will also be able to subscribe to F1 TV Pro and F1 TV Premium directly through FanCode in India, providing exclusive access to a comprehensive content library for the sport.\nFanCode will continue to deliver coverage of all race weekends each season, including every practice, qualifying, and race sessions, it said. The platform had first signed a two-year partnership to stream Formula 1 in 2024 and 2025.\nThrough this partnership, FanCode will also hold broadcast rights across Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. However, F1 TV Pro and F1 TV Premium will be sold directly by Formula 1 in these markets.\n\"This expanded deal firmly establishes FanCode as the home of all things F1 in India, and we’re excited to keep serving one of the country’s most passionate and fastest-growing sports communities,\" said FanCode co-founder Yannick Colaco.\n\"Fans have shown tremendous trust in our platform, and we will continue to deliver on their expectations, whether through livestreams, enhanced features or curated F1 community experiences,” he added.\nRegional F1 commentary in Tamil and Hindi\nFanCode said it has introduced regional commentary in Hindi and Tamil as part of efforts to make the sport more accessible, while working with Formula 1 communities to curate special fan screenings. It has also launched a dedicated motorsports podcast called Gearbox with some of India’s top creators.\nThe platform added that it plans to roll out more product-led innovations aimed at improving the viewing experience in the future.\nEarlier this year, Colaco told Moneycontrol that the company is exploring the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to personalise the live sports experience for consumers.\n\"The ability to use AI to customise both audio and visual presentation in live sport is really the big opportunity I see, since it will not only add tremendous value to users but also help increase the popularity of sport,\" he told Moneycontrol.\nColaco explained that such technology could help tailor broadcasts to different viewer segments, both in audio and visual formats, to make sports more accessible without diluting their complexity.\nAmong the key initiatives include AI-powered multilingual live commentary, which the platform recently rolled out in Hindi for this year’s Caribbean Premier League cricket tournament.\nWith over 160 million users, FanCode is expected to play a key role in Dream Sports' broader AI strategy. Earlier this month, the sports technology major unveiled a revamped version of the Dream11 mobile app, expanding it from a fantasy sports platform to a hangout spot for fans built around creators and livestreamers.\nThe app now lets users follow matches through livestreams hosted by prominent creators who offer quick insights, match stats and breakdowns of key moments. Viewers can interact with them through chats and reactions.\nConsumers can buy DreamBucks, the platform’s in-app currency, or earn them by watching livestreams. They can then spend these to give ‘shoutouts’ to creators or keep their chats pinned during streams.\nRising F1 popularity in India\nFanCode's expanded partnership comes amid Formula 1's rising popularity in India over the last few years, particularly among Gen Z and female audiences.\nAccording to Nielsen, the country has 79 million F1 fans, a 41 percent surge since 2022, making it one of the fastest-growing sports in the nation. The recently released F1 Film starring Brad Pitt was also the highest-grossing Hollywood film in the country.\nThe 2026 season is set to mark a new chapter for the racing sport, with the debut of the Cadillac F1 team and Audi completing its takeover of the Sauber F1 team, expanding the grid to 22 cars. The season will also see the introduction of new regulations, including lighter cars, sustainable fuels, and active aerodynamics. Arvid Lindblad, a driver of Indian heritage, will also feature on the grid, having signed up with Racing Bulls for the season.\n\"FanCode has elevated our broadcast for our passionate Indian audience to ensure they are able to feel the adrenaline and excitement of a race weekend from the comfort of their homes. We look forward to continuing working closely with FanCode and finding new, innovative ways to engage our fanbase in India and its subcontinent,” said Ian Holmes, Chief Media Rights and Broadcasting Officer of Formula 1.\nApart from Formula 1, FanCode also broadcasts several major sports tournaments, including MotoGP (Motorsports), La Liga, the Saudi Pro League, Carabao Cup, UEFA Women's Champion League (Football), the PGA Tour (Golf), and cricket events from around the world such as the CPL, Super Smash, and The Hundred, among others.\nFounded by Colaco and Prasana Krishnan in March 2019, FanCode provides live streaming of these sporting events through various subscription options, including Match, Season, and Tour Passes, along with monthly and annual plans.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.
