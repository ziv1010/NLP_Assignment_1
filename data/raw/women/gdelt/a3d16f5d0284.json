He thanked their families for an invaluable sacrifice and pledged the leadership’s continued support to the men and women who protected the UAE.\nThe UAE observes Commemoration Day on November 30 to recognise the bravery of the armed forces who died in the line of duty.\n“On Commemoration Day, we remember those who gave their lives for the UAE with courage and pride. In recognising the immense sacrifices of our heroes and their families, we affirm our deep-rooted belief that dedication and service continue to safeguard our beloved nation,” Sheikh Mohamed wrote on X.\n“Together, our efforts to uphold the progress and prosperity of the UAE stand as an enduring tribute to our heroes, and we pray for them to rest in eternal peace.”\nSaluting the soldiers and their families, he said in a statement released on Wam that November 30 is \"a proud national occasion on which we honour the memory of our brave heroes who gave their lives for the UAE, embodying the truest spirit of sacrifice in defence of our homeland and the noble values and principles it represents. They leave behind a legacy of honour that will forever live in the hearts of their families and their country\".\nHonouring heroes\nSheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, said UAE citizens were humbled by the sacrifice of military personnel, drew courage from their valour and the example they set.\n“On Martyrs' Day, we stand in reverence for the sacrifices of those who offered their lives in redemption for the homeland,” Sheikh Mohammed said on X.\n“We recall their immortal stance, we draw from their courage a strength and resolve that elevates the flag of the Emirates. May God have mercy on our righteous martyrs to them glory, and to the homeland honour, dignity and pride.”\nSheikh Humaid bin Rashid Al Nuaimi, Ruler of Ajman, Sheikh Saud bin Rashid Al Mualla, Ruler of Umm Al Quwain, and Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi, Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, said soldiers killed serving their country embodied the highest examples of devotion, patriotism and Commemoration Day was an opportunity to honour their sacrifice.\nSheikh Mansour bin Zayed, Vice President, Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Presidential Court, said the occasion served as a reminder to present and future generations of how UAE martyrs are enduring symbols of pride and honour.\nCommemoration Day, or Martyrs' Day, is held every year to pay respect to the dedication of the UAE’s military and to honour those who lost their lives in service of the country.\nThe late President Sheikh Khalifa introduced Commemoration Day in 2015. It was first held to remember Salem Suhail Khamis, who died on November 30, 1971, fighting against Iranian troops on the island of Greater Tunb. He is recognised as the first Emirati killed in military service since the formation of the UAE in 1971.\nSheikh Khaled bin Mohamed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, lauded the heroic acts of the UAE military that would inspire citizens to ensure the country’s growth and prosperity.\n\"The heroism of the UAE’s fallen heroes is an eternal source of inspiration for future generations. Their courage, devotion and profound sense of national duty embody the true character of the Emirati people – steadfast, sincere and always ready to serve their country and uphold its flag,” he said in a statement on Wam.\nSymbol of sacrifice\nSheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, praised the military for their loyalty to the nation and igniting pride in the UAE.\n“On Martyrs’ Day, we honour the men who stood true to their oath and gave everything to keep our flag flying high, united under a leadership defined by loyalty and generosity. Their noble memory lives on as a symbol of sacrifice, loyalty and devotion to the nation,” Sheikh Hamdan said on X.\nSheikha Fatima bint Mubarak, Mother of the Nation, praised the mothers of the UAE’s fallen soldiers saying that both sacrifices were a source of national pride. She said the country would continue to honour soldiers and their families in remembrance of their role in protecting the nation.\nNational pride\nMohamed Al Mazrouei, Minister of State for Defence Affairs, also paid warm tribute to those who lost their lives protecting the nation. He said UAE soldiers killed in action were \"defending what is right, aiding those in need and supporting the oppressed\".\nLt Gen Issa Al Mazrouei, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, spoke of how Commemoration Day \"reflects our pride in the values of loyalty, belonging, courage and bravery\".",
