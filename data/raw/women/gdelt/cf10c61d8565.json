  "body_text": "Mia Fishel Makes US National Team Debut\nMia Fishel made her debut for the U.S. women’s senior soccer team in their recent victory over South Africa, playing in the same match that served as the last international game for soccer icon Megan Rapinoe.\nThe 22-year-old, whose father Patrick is Bermudian, was recently signed by the Chelsea football team in England, becoming one of the most expensive players in the history of the women’s game.\nA US Soccer Report said, “The U.S. Women’s National Team beat South Africa 2-0 in a match that bid farewell to U.S. Soccer legend and international soccer icon Megan Rapinoe.\n“Rapinoe’s 203rd and final international match saw goals from forward Trinity Rodman and midfielder Emily Sonnett to send off one of the most important players in women’s soccer history in front of more than 25,000 fans at Soldier Field.\n“Coming off a 3-0 win against South Africa just three days ago, the USA immediately took control of the match, keeping the visitors on the back foot for the entire match and creating danger right from the jump. The Americans created a series of chances in the early minutes from forward Alex Morgan and midfielder Lindsey Horan while the team consistently looked to find Rapinoe on the flank as her teammates tried to get her one last goal.\n“It was not to be, despite a blistering free kick from Rapinoe just before she exited that flew just over the cross bar, but the U.S. created the opening goal in the 18th minute. Morgan did incredibly well to beat her defender to a long ball over the top on the right side with a clean shoulder-to-shoulder challenge. She then lifted a cross toward the back post that Rodman buried with an incredible volley to beat goalkeeper Andile Dlamini.\n“The USA doubled its lead just four minutes into the second half as Rapinoe took a corner from the left side. The South Africa ‘keeper punched the ball out, but not far enough, and Sonnett met the falling ball with a header that looped over the defenders on the goal line and settled into the back of the net from eight yards out.\n“Following that free kick which almost made for a perfect ending, Rapinoe, who captained the USA in her final game, came off the field in the 54th minute to a roaring standing ovation for the last time as a USWNT player.\n“Rapinoe’s final match comes 17 years and 63 days after making her international debut on July 23, 2006. Only three players have had longer USWNT careers: Kristine Lilly (23 years, 94 days), Christie Pearce (18 years, 204 days) and Mia Hamm (17 years, 127 days). The 2012 Olympic gold medalist and two-time World Cup champion finished her career ranked 10th in USWNT history with 63 goals and is tied with Abby Wambach for third in assists with 73.\n“The U.S. nearly scored again five minutes later as Rodman, who had been an absolute menace in attack and on defense the entire match with her speed and tenacity, received the ball on the left wing and cut inside, firing a powerful, curling shot toward the top right corner that bounced off crossbar at the upper V and back into play. Horan also had a couple of decent looks toward goal but was unfortunate not to find the back of the net.\n“While the night marked the end of one international career, it also marked the start of another as forward Mia Fishel earned her first cap after coming into the match for Alex Morgan in the 65th minute. Fishel became the 253rd player to appear for the USWNT and the third player to debut for the USA in 2023, joining Savannah DeMelo and M.A. Vignola, earned her first cap in the first game of this series against South Africa on Sept. 21.\n“The USA would eventually out-shoot the visitors 19-0 after allowing just one shot on goal in the first game of the series against a South African team that made history by advancing to the knockout rounds at the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup.”",
