He was one of a kind, and his loss will be felt by all. My heart goes out to his family, but I want to take the time to acknowledge what a special man he really was.”\nBurnley said in a statement on the club website: “It is with sadness that Burnley can confirm Matt Beard has passed away, at the age of 47.\n“The thoughts and prayers of everyone at the club are with Matt’s family and friends.”\nBurnley confirmed their match against West Brom, which was scheduled for Sunday, has now been postponed following the news of Beard’s death.\nBeard managed Chelsea, the current six-time defending WSL champions, between 2009 and 2012 and the club said he laid “much of the foundations prior to Emma Hayes’ arrival”.\nThe Blues said in a statement: “Players and staff alike speak of a man who wasn’t just your manager, he was your friend. He was a caring and loving person who always made time for people.\n“Matt was integral to the growth of the women’s game in this country and is a man who will be sadly missed by everyone in the footballing community.”\nFellow WSL side Manchester United described Beard as a “giant” of the women’s game, posting on X: “Matt was a fierce opponent of ours; a giant of women’s football.”\nA statement on the Women’s Super League X account said: “Everyone at WSL Football extends its deepest sympathies to the family, friends and loved ones of Matt Beard following news of his passing.\n“Matt played an instrumental role in the growth of women’s football and will be missed by everyone associated with the game.”\nThe Football Association also paid tribute to a “key figure” in women’s football.\n“We’re deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Matt Beard,” a post on the official FA X account said.\n“Matt was a key figure in growing the women’s game and will be missed by all. Our thoughts go out to his family and friends during this difficult time.”\nBroadcaster Jacqui Oatley described Beard as a “lovely man” who “never changed from being the kind, warm, likeable soul he always was”.\nShe wrote on X: “Matt saw the England job pass him by multiple times. Never received the credit he deserved, in my humble opinion, as he didn’t work with big budgets.”\nBeard took charge of West Ham in 2018 and led them to the Women’s FA Cup final the following year.\n“West Ham is deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of former manager Matt Beard,” the club said on X.\n“The thoughts and condolences of everyone at the club are with Matt’s family and friends at this incredibly sad time.”\nAnother of his former clubs, Millwall, with whom he started his managerial career, also paid tribute, as did Charlton, where Beard had a coaching spell.",
