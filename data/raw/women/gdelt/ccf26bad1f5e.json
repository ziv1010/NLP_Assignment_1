  "body_text": "LOS ANGELES — UCLA Athletics announced an astronomical $17.3 million donation from the estate of former student-athlete, coach and donor Larry Layne on Monday afternoon, part of a more than $40 million pledge across numerous facets of the university.\nPer a university press release, $9.6 million will be directed to the football program and $7.7 million will head to the men’s basketball program. The full donation from Layne, a former men’s rugby player and women’s rugby coach, is one of the largest in recent history.\n“I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude for Larry’s longstanding history of generosity to both campus and the athletic department, including this transformational gift,” Athletic Director Martin Jarmond said in a statement. “I am fortunate to have spent time with Larry and get to know his deep passion for UCLA Athletics, particularly his desire to help our football and men’s basketball programs thrive in this new era of collegiate sports. His investment in our programs positions us, and future generations of Bruin athletes, for long-term success.”\nLayne donated to the UCLA baseball, softball, women’s tennis and men’s water polo programs across his lifespan, nearly 100 donations total to UCLA Athletics equaling $18.8 million overall.\nHis first donation was to the UCLA Women’s Rugby Club fund in 1979.\nIncreased financial support goes a long way in modern-day college athletics, with premier athletes in both football and men’s basketball accruing top-dollar contracts in name, image and likeness (NIL) – and financial revenue sharing – over the last handful of years.\nMen’s basketball coach Mick Cronin and football coach Bob Chesney issued statements as a part of the press release.\n“I would like to thank Larry for his generosity and long-time support of our athletics department, specifically toward our men’s basketball program,” Cronin said in a statement. “This university has so many fantastic resources for its student-athletes, but we simply would not be able to thrive if not for the generosity of our many loyal donors such as Larry. His generous gift will help us in the future as we continue to build a basketball program with elite young men who all of our fans can be proud to support.”\nSaid Chensey, via release: “As a former UCLA student-athlete and coach, Larry fully understood the hard work and determination that was needed to be at his best both on and off the field, and this incredibly generous gift will make a big impact on helping us build a championship football team. I am very grateful to Larry and his wife Sheelagh for their support of UCLA and our football program. We will make sure that Larry’s legacy lives on by continuing to support our student-athletes and upholding our university’s True Bruin values.”\nUCLA continues portal success\nUCLA received two late Monday transfers, one of whom could line up immediately in a starting equation.\nEastern Michigan offensive lineman Mack Indestad – a 6-foot-8, 308-pound left tackle – as well as Oklahoma linebacker Samuel “Sammy” Omosigho joined up with the Bruins’ transfer portal class, which now nears 40 names. Both players were announced as signed and admitted into the university as of Tuesday morning.\n“I’m just super excited for the opportunity to play at a program that has had a lot of history behind it,” Indestad, who has three years of eligibility remaining, told the Southern California News Group. “I believe that me, and what we are bringing, will put this program back to being successful, and competing for championships.”\nOmosigho could end up as a top tackle-getter for the Bruins in 2026. It might appear too early to peg a player as someone likely to lead the team in any statistic, but with linebackers Isaiah Chisom (transferred to Oklahoma State) and JonJon Vaughns (out of eligibility) out the door, the former Sooner could be a stout asset for defensive coordinator Colin Hitschler.\nThe 6-1, 235-pound edge rusher tallied four tackles for loss and two sacks to go along with 50 total tackles. Omosigho has one year of eligibility.\nUCLA GM contract details revealed\nUCLA football general manager Darrick Yray, who joined coach Bob Chesney’s staff not long after Chesney’s hiring in mid-December, is set to make about $403,000 per year, per a contract obtained by the Southern California News Group through a California Public Records Request.\nYray, who came to Westwood after serving as the GM of personnel at Florida State for four years, will make about $50,000 more than previous team GM Khary Darlington, per USA Today’s general manager/front office database.\nAs the database currently stands, the salary would place Yray as the 19th-highest-paid college football GM in the country.",
