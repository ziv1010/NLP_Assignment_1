I always have this at the back of my mind. They didn’t just get to the World Cup on the platter of gold, they fought for it, they played matches and they won countries before they qualified. So there’s no small country amongst them.\n“We have to give them respect in terms of planning. Once you don’t give respect, complacency will set in and you may pay dearly for it. So we see them as contenders.”\nThe handler of Nigeria Women Football League (NWFL) Premiership side, Naija Ratels Football Club of Abuja admitted that he would take one game at a time to ensure qualification from the group stage but was quick to add that with a high level of discipline, dedication, and determination, they hope to surpass their previous third place record in the 2022 edition.\n“We will take it one game at a time.” He continued. ”First and foremost, our first game is very important to take it seriously and to make sure we win. Most importantly, our group match is very important, very key to us. So that we are able to win and top our table.\n”So we need to be very careful in doing that. And then playing in the quarter-final, hopefully we win the quarter-final and go into the semifinal so we equal the level that we attained in India. That is the number one target that we have. And also to break more records. So we just take it one game after the other.”\nOlowookere’s side narrowly missed out on the final on penalties to Colombia in the semi final match of the last tournament in 2022.\nThey hope to become the first African side to make it to the final of the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup this year.",
