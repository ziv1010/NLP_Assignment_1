Did he press for support for the Voice referendum in exchange for rejecting the Qatar Airways additional flights? And will the Labor party, when parliament returns, vote to bring Alan Joyce back before the Senate to answer these important questions on behalf of the Australian public?\"\nQueensland Premier Steven Miles has confirmed that power has been restored to 95 per cent of homes and businesses that had been affected by the damage caused by the recent storms.\nThe Queensland Premier has also said that the Australian Defence Force will be aiding in the recovery efforts made by the over 1000 energy worker crews in the state.\nIt comes as over 6000 homes across the south east of Queensland remain without electricity or water.\nMr Miles has thanked the workers of the public sector who continue to process the high volume of grant applications that are coming through, and has outlined his plans for the coming days.\n\"Look, I want to shout-out to the public servants who are working so hard to get through more applications for hardship grants than we've ever ever experienced before. My plan from here is to visit the Gold Coast and head to Cairns and then tomorrow spend some time with the communities affected in the state's far north including Wujal Wujal and Togara.\"\nAn Imam has died after being shot multiple times while sitting in his car outside of his Mosque in the US state of New Jersey.\nAuthorities say they are still searching for the attacker, but that so far they have no evidence to suggest the attack on Hassan Sharif was motivated by bias.\nNew Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin says the investigation into the shooting will continue without ruling out any motives.\n\"We know, and I know, that in light of global events and with a rise in bias directed at many communities we’re experiencing across our state — particularly the Muslim community — there are many in New Jersey right now who are feeling a heightened sense of fear or anxiety at the news of this slaying. I want every resident of our state to know that we are bringing all of our resources to bear to keep our Muslim friends and neighbors safe, as well as all New Jerseyans safe, just as we are going to continue to work around the clock to identify and bring to justice anyone involved in the killing of Imam Sharif.\"\nA 13-year-old boy from Oklahoma is believed to be the first person to beat the classic Nintendo game \"Tetris\".\nWillis Gibson, also known as \"blue scuti\" in the online community, posted a video on his YouTube channel in which he is shown to reach the game's \"kill screen\" in just under 38 minutes.\nPreviously, only artificial intelligence machines have been known to reach this point of the game that forces it to freeze, providing the player with no more blocks to complete rows.\nThe young gamer was in disbelief after his accomplishment.\nIn football, Charlotte Grant has completed her move to Tottenham Hotspur, becoming the latest Australian to join the Women's Super League.\nThe 22-year-old capitalised on an excellent season with Swedish First Division side Vittsjo with whom she had 23 appearances and two goals in the previous season.\nGrant was also a member of the Matildas side that took part in the 2020 Olympics.\nIn her first interview as a Spurs player, Grant has made reference to her first goal with the Matildas, which was coincidentally scored against England.\n\"It was an incredible moment to score my first goal. I think, every time you put on your national team jersey is a huge honour. It's something I've dreamt of ever since I was a little girl and to score that goal was incredible. I think that's when I really felt part of the team with the response that everyone had around me.\"",
