  "body_text": "Ole Miss football has already drawn the blueprint to turn a “not quite good enough” team into “one of the most dangerous teams” in a single offseason. Now, the Rebels are trying to prove the plan’s effectiveness.\nThe NCAA’s winter transfer portal opens in less than three weeks and any teams or coaches hoping to emulate what the Rebels have done, are getting more evidence by the week. That not only includes team accolades (i.e., a playoff berth) but also individual ones.\nOutland Trophy Semifinalist 🦈@WalterNolenIII | #HottyToddy pic.twitter.com/MQtM3GKlez\n— Ole Miss Football (@OleMissFB) November 21, 2024\nThe latest is Walter Nolen, who joined Ole Miss after transferring from Texas A&M, being named a semifinalist for the Outland Trophy. Nolen is one of seven semifinalists overall and one of just two defensive players to make the cut for the Outland Trophy, which is awarded annually to the nation’s best college interior lineman on offense or defense.\nNolen is one of the biggest reasons why No. 9 Ole Miss has one of the nation’s best defenses that leads the nation in sacks with 46 and tackles for a loss with 2013. Nolen has 32 tackles (16 solo) with 7.5 tackles for loss, 4.0 sacks, three QB hurries, two fumble recoveries and two pass breakups. He’s also a semifinalist for the Bednarik Award and Walter Camp Player of the Year Award.\nYesterday’s Ole Miss Results\nWomen’s Tennis: NCAA Individual Championship, Waco, Texas\nToday’s Ole Miss Schedule\nMen’s Basketball: Oral Roberts at Ole Miss, 7 p.m., Thursday\nWomen’s Tennis: NCAA Individual Championship, Waco, Texas\nDaily Dose Of Archie Manning\n“If you just make every effort to do the right thing, you’ll come out ok.
