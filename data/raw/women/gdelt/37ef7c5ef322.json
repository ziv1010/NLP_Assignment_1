Tommy Joe died peacefully after a short illness bravely borne and patiently fought. He passed away in the wonderful care of the staff of Mayo University Hospital. He was widely known and respected as a great community activist, a talented and skilled craftsman and a kind and gentle person.\nTommy Joe will be very much missed by everyone, particularly his many friends at Ballyglass FC to whom he made a marvellous contribution. A co-founder of the club - Ballyglass FC - paid Tommy Joe a most poignant and deserved tribute – ‘From that memorable day in 1975, when he proudly took to the field in the club’s first-ever game, Tommy Joe’s dedication to Ballyglass FC never wavered. His love for the club was palpable —whether he was cheering on the senior teams or, in more recent years, watching his grandson Cian play. Ballyglass was more than just a football club to Tommy Joe; it was part of him.\nHe was there always with a kind word, sage advice and ready hands to help; he tirelessly worked to ensure the club’s success and well-being. Even in his later years, he cared deeply for Ballyglass FC, always offering his support in anyway he could, motivated by a love that never dimmed”. A skilled master carpenter, coach maker, wheelwright and craftsman he will be sorely missed.\nTommy Joe was predeceased by his parents Tom and Teresa Walsh and is deeply regretted by his wife Joan, his family; daughter Aideen, son Bryan and his adored grandson Cian, his loving sisters Rosaleen Halligan (Ballyglass), Josephine Walsh (Dublin), Bernie O’Connor (Cavan), his brother Sean (Claremorris), his brothers-in-law Jerry, Michael, Joe and Patsy, his sisters-in-law Gosia and Maureen, his nieces, nephews, grandnieces and grandnephews, relatives, neighbours and a wide circle of friends to whom sincere condolences are tendered. There was a large attendance present as his remains reposed at St Colman’s Funeral Home, Lower James Street, Claremorris, Co. Mayo on last Tuesday, September 10, from 6 until 8pm. Guards of Honour from Ballyglass FC, Ballintubber GAA and the greater community were formed to honour one who was deeply respected and who had left an indelible imprint on community life. The removal of his remains took place from his home on Wednesday, September 11, for his Funeral Mass in St Mary’s Church, Carnacon, at 12 noon. Burial ceremonies took place afterwards in Burriscarra Cemetery.
