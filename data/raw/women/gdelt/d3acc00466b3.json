  "body_text": "—Tonight’s Celebration of Life in honor of Denny Crum will be streamed live on ACC Network Extra. The stream link for the event, which is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. ET at the KFC Yum Center, is available here: https://uofl.me/3nQ0Rsb.\nMonday afternoon Cardinal news and notes\nNo graduation from U of L is complete without a photo shoot at the most iconic corner on campus.\nLimited free tickets are also still available to be claimed at this link: https://uofl.me/3pBL8gY.\n—I joined Jeff Greer’s podcast to talk Denny Crum and a little Kenny Payne roster reconstruction.\n—Justin Williams of The Athletic has a terrific piece on Jeff Brohm’s homecoming.\nThere’s a family reunion vibe inside the Schnellenberger offices these days. Brohm brought the whole crew with him, including younger brother Brian as offensive coordinator and older brother Greg as chief of staff, with both siblings reprising the roles they served under Jeff at Purdue. Even Jeff’s son, Brady, finishing out his senior year at Trinity, helps out in the recruiting department.\nIt extends beyond the Brohm bloodline. Nochta and offensive line coach Richard Owens are former players. Wide receivers coach Garrick McGee was the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach in 2016 when Jackson won the Heisman. Running backs coach Chris Barclay is a Louisville native. Special teams coordinator Ryan Wallace’s dad is the head coach at local Saint Xavier High.\n“You get pulled into that family, brotherhood dynamic, too, because you feel empowered to share your opinion,” Nochta said. “We have people committed to this place, some continuity. You can trust that the right people are here.”\nJeff Brohm, right, led Purdue to the 2022 Big Ten title game against Jim Harbaugh’s Michigan Wolverines. (Aaron J. Thornton / Getty Images)\nIn 2017, Brohm took over a Purdue program that had just one winning season in its past nine and quickly turned the tide, going 7-6 in 2017 and taking the Boilermakers to back-to-back bowl games in his first two seasons. His final record was 36-34 over six seasons, but he led Purdue to nine wins in 2021 and eight in 2022, the program’s best two-year stretch since Drew Brees was under center.\nA key aspect was the ability to pull off upsets and succeed in big games. Purdue went 9-2 in rivalry matchups against Illinois and Indiana under Brohm and landed top-five upsets over Ohio State in 2018 and Iowa and Michigan State in 2021. Satterfield’s four years at Louisville (25-24) were filled with similar ups and downs compared to Brohm’s run at Purdue, but Satterfield struggled in big games, finishing 2-7 against ranked opponents and a combined 0-6 against Clemson and Kentucky. It’s a fortune Brohm will look to reverse with the Cardinals, and one he takes pride in.\n“That’s where I think my experience, hopefully, will help: mapping out a plan to win big football games. We won big football games at Purdue when we shouldn’t have or weren’t favored to win, so to speak,” Brohm said. “No question, big wins can really motivate your team to play even better, believe they are capable of winning every game. It’s important for the fan base. That’s vital to success, any type of momentum you can get.”\n—Brett McMurphy’s first bowl projections for 2023 have Louisville facing Auburn in the Gator Bowl.\n—Malik Cunningham is getting $200,000 in guaranteed money from the New England Patriots, more than five of the 12 players the franchise selected in the NFL draft.

Rady Children’s Invitational\nTeams: Iowa, Oklahoma, Seton Hall, USC\nThe highlight is USC, who just landed 4-star guard, Bronny James. The Trojans will be a main attraction next season and the two games against power conference competition will be a good test. It’ll also be fun to see how Iowa’s offense looks without a member of the Murray family.\n2. Baha Mar Bahamas Hoop Championship\nTeams: Georgia, Kansas State, Miami, Providence\nThis group may not stand out in terms of star power, but it’s likely going to be one of the most competitive MTEs. Georgia has dominated the transfer portal and looks to be much more competitive. Providence may have lost coach Ed Cooley, but new coach Kim English has a strong roster, while both Miami and Kansas State look to continue breakout years for both programs.\n1. Empire Classic\nTeams: Indiana, Louisville, Texas, UConn\nJokes aside, Louisville’s roster has improved, with several starting-caliber transfers and top-30 prospects. But this will be a tough field with reigning national champs UConn, along with powers Texas and Indiana. Expect the Longhorns and Hoosiers to make a few more portal moves, too.\n—In New York, the Cards could square off against former recruit Mackenzie Mgbako, who picked Indiana on Friday.\n—The Athletic looks at the biggest transfer portal winners and losers in college hoops.

Officials from the seven schools, led by Florida State and Clemson, have met a handful of times over the past several months, with their lawyers examining the grant-of-rights to determine just how unbreakable it is.\nPer the grant-of-rights, each ACC school gives ownership of its broadcasting rights to the league in a deal with ESPN that runs through 2036. If a school breaks the deal, the ACC will continue to own the TV rights of any of that school’s home games, according to the contract.\nThe ACC’s options are quite limited, both for the group of seven and the league as a whole.\n1. Seek additional revenue from ESPN. This is a long shot given the network’s current situation. ESPN, in the midst of a wave of personnel cuts, is also negotiating deals with UFC/WWE, the NBA and Pac-12. While commissioner Jim Phillips and a few ACC presidents met recently with the network over this issue, no significant cash infusion appears imminent.\n2. Secede from the league. Some of the schools, possibly the most frustrated lot such as FSU and Clemson, could pay the $120 million exit fee and hope they can break a grant-of-rights agreement that most attorneys—though maybe not their own—say is airtight. That then leaves a very big question: Where do they go? The SEC and Big Ten seem quite comfortable with their current membership, but potential western realignment could trigger them to expand more.\n3. Create another league. If the seven agree to dissolve the current grant-of-rights agreement (we don’t know yet if this is a possibility), they may add a couple of more schools and begin their own association in hopes of it being more lucrative. This comes with its own issues, of course. You’d need a broadcast partner or private equity to fund such an endeavor. And, as one official asks, “Will it really be that much more lucrative?”\nBasically, there are no easy answers.\n—Kentucky Derby winner Mage will be the only Derby runner entered in this Saturday’s Preakness.\n—Kentucky is yet to produce any jackpot wins since 2014, making it the unluckiest lottery state in America, according to Casinorabi.\n—Eric Crawford writes about the build-up to Louisville’s final goodbye to Denny Crum.\n—Russ Smith discusses getting the Siva/Smith backcourt back together this summer.\n—U of L women’s soccer has landed Binghamton transfer Maya Anand.\n—The Athletic has updated its early college basketball rankings for next season.
