  "body_text": "Emma Hayes is one of those coaches who turns everything she touches into gold, and the season 2023/24 wasn't an exception. While for many coaches it was a \"marathon,\" Hayes managed to make this season look like a fast run. At the head of such a talented generation of players, she could win two of the most difficult competitions in the world. The first: she led Chelsea to a fifth consecutive Women's Super League title, and then the test of her tenure as coach of the USWNT for Olympic gold in Paris. A faultless display that won her the Johan Cruyff Award-previously reserved for a coach without limits.\nFollow MLS Multiplex on X (Twitter).\nThis recognition, showcased at the Ballon d'Or, marks an important chapter not only in Hayes' life but also for women's soccer in general. For the first time, France Football included the best coach award in the same category as male and female players in a ceremony that also celebrated global soccer icons. And if anyone had doubts over the change Hayes has brought into the team, she made sure she didn't spare anyone when dedicating her honor, saying, \"This award is for everyone who was part of Chelsea and the USWNT.\"\nOlympic Run and Flawless Start with the USWNT\nIt wasn't an easy mantle to take up with the USWNT right after the English title. Hayes had no real time to get to know and adjust the squad before the Olympics. But with a résumé full of wins and a record of bold strategies, Hayes accepted straightaway. She led the team in just four games before the tournament, including a narrow win over Mexico and a scoreless draw with Costa Rica.\nThe Olympic journey started with a strong performance where the U.S. won all the games at hand and nailed an almost impregnable defense. They had reaped three straight 1-0 wins in the knockout rounds, including back-to-back victories over Germany to culminate with a final win over Brazil, wherein Mallory Swanson scored the winning goal. These included Hayes not only securing gold but also restoring the U.S. atop the FIFA Women's World Rankings, proving that her leadership crossed borders and further nailed her ability to build and maintain a champion team.\nFrom Chelsea to National Team: An Inspiring Coach\nNot every professional would have made such an easy transition from managing a club like Chelsea to being part of an Olympic contingent. She is talented at building and managing cohesive teams that put in maximum commitment. For Chelsea, she had been something more than a coach; she instituted a winning culture, a psychology of resilience that led the team to titles and the status of one of Europe's women's soccer powerhouses.\nThat speaks to her track record in the Women's Super League: six WSL Coach of the Season awards and five back-to-back titles. Throughout every match, Hayes has developed a strong, tactical Chelsea that is full of players who know and implement an unusual style of play. That clear vision of being a leader was key in her move to USWNT-a team so in need of her energy and focus to get over the line to gold.\nHayes and the Johan Cruyff Award's Impact\nThe Johan Cruyff Award to the best female coach of the season serves as a barometer on how women's soccer has grown. For Hayes, it is not only an acknowledgement of her work but an illustration of how strong women's soccer has become globally. In her video acceptance, Hayes made sure to recognize her peers, like England's head coach Sarina Wiegman, saluting the quality of her rivals and her pride at sharing the pitch with them. It is this humility and team-centered vision that shape her journey and enchant her players.\nBright Future of USWNT Under Hayes\nThe USWNT, under Hayes, are back to being among the elites of the world. With an unbeaten record of 11 wins, one draw, and no losses, Hayes has already proven herself strong and effective. She becomes the fourth on the list with Anson Dorrance, Pia Sundhage, and Jill Ellis as coaches who won titles in their first major tournaments. Hayes' achievement is even more impressive given the brief time between her arrival and the Olympics.\nIf the current indications mean anything, Hayes has even bigger ambitions with the USWNT. She brought into the U.S. a winning mentality that had already been part of her Chelsea legacy in building a team capable of competing in whatever tournament and at whatever level. The coming tournaments, such as the World Cup, will provide yet another opportunity for Hayes to show if she is indeed worth the trust placed upon her.",
