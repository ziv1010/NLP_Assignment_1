  "body_text": "Thursday’s briefing: Kane ruled out and mixed fortunes for Man Utd and Chelsea\nEngland captain Harry Kane has been ruled out of his side’s match against Wales, while Cristiano Ronaldo has become football’s first billionaire.\nThe Women’s Champions League saw Manchester United get off to a winning start, but it was not the beginning Chelsea were hoping for.\nKane targets Latvia comeback\nThomas Tuchel has confirmed England captain Harry Kane will miss tonight’s friendly against Wales having been unable to kick a ball without pain this week.\nKane is expected to feature in Tuesday’s World Cup qualifier away to Latvia, but England’s all-time top scorer will miss the first game of the double-header due to a knock sustained late in Bayern Munich’s weekend win over Eintracht Frankfurt.\n“It was too painful to kick a ball, it was too risky that he gets another kick and will just like be in an up and down situation pain-wise, so we gave him the chance that everything calms down,” Tuchel said.\n“We are convinced that he will be ready for the match against Latvia.”\nChelsea draw frustrates Bompastor\nChelsea head coach Sonia Bompastor said her team’s 1-1 draw with Twente was “not a good result at all” after they made a muted start to their Women’s Champions League campaign.\nThe Blues produced a dominant display in Enschede but Bompastor’s decision to make seven changes to the team that drew with Manchester United failed to pay off.\nAnd the result could have been even worse, a wonderful curling strike from Danique van Ginkel giving the home side the lead just past the hour mark, before Sandy Baltimore’s penalty saved her team’s blushes.\n“It’s not a good result at all. We wanted to start the campaign with three points. We created a lot of opportunities and couldn’t score more than one. This is not enough when you play a Champions League game,” Bompastor said\nLe Tissier strikes for United\nMaya Le Tissier scored a first-half penalty as Manchester United launched their maiden Champions League campaign with a 1-0 win over Valerenga.\nSkipper Le Tissier struck after 31 minutes as United saw off the Norwegians in their first match of the league phase at Leigh Sports Village.\nDespite the narrow scoreline, it was a victory Marc Skinner’s side thoroughly deserved for a dominant display in which they created numerous chances.\nRonaldo’s career earnings top £1billion\nCristiano Ronaldo has become football’s first billionaire player, according to Bloomberg.\nThe 40-year-old’s net worth has been estimated at £1.04billion by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which tracks the world’s richest people.\nRonaldo’s valuation takes into account career earnings, investments and endorsements, with Bloomberg estimating his salary income between 2002 and 2023 was more than £410million.\nHis move to Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr in 2022 saw him sign for a reported annual salary of £177m and he has since signed a new deal which will keep him at the club until 2027. He also has a £13.4m a year sponsorship deal with Nike.\nWhat’s on today\nEngland host Wales in a friendly at Wembley, while Scotland take on Greece in a World Cup qualifier at Hampden Park.",
