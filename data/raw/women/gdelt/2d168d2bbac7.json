She might wake up one day and feel OK.\n\"She's obviously an important part of what we've done but she'll need to train. We'll train Friday and she'll need to train Friday night and prove her fitness before we select her.\n\"We'll give her that opportunity, but she was still on crutches on Saturday.\"\nIn other injury news, defender Tahlia Gossner overcame a string of setbacks to get through Maitland's final-round 3-1 win over Adamstown at Speers Point last Saturday while Mercedes McNabb did not play as she manages a hamstring issue.\nWHAT A STRIKE\nSpeaking of injuries, former Australian junior representative Lucy Kell shrugged off a shoulder complaint to produce a long-range wonder goal in the 85th minute to seal Maitland's win.\nThe 22-year-old, who joined Maitland from Broadmeadow this campaign, was treated on the field after landing awkwardly on her right shoulder in the 71st minute following contact with Adamstown's Leia Puxty.\nShe was briefly forced from the field but returned in the 77th minute and was unmarked in space, at least 30 metres out from goal when teammate Chelsea Greguric played her the ball.\nKell took a touch then sweetly struck the ball into the top right corner of Adamstown's goal.\n\"It was a very good goal, a really good strike, and she's capable of that sort of thing, so we're really happy for her,\" Hamilton said.\nFor Kell, who was still holding her shoulder when swamped by jubilant teammates, the goal was opportunistic.\n\"[Olivia Sneddon] is an amazing keeper but plays off her line quite a lot, plays quite a high game, and I just saw the opportunity,\" Kell said.\n\"I had a bunged up shoulder and didn't feel like running and looked up and saw the opportunity so I just gave it a bit of a crack.\n\"When I hit it, it felt good.\"\nMAGIC FACE DEMONS\nWith the NPLW premiership already sealed heading into the competition's final round last weekend, Broadmeadow coach Jake Curley took the opportunity to rest several players who were at risk of a suspension due to yellow card accumulation or carrying niggles.\nBut Magic should be at full-strength when they attempt to overcome their demons and book an elusive grand final appearance on Friday night. The club has been a top-two side since returning to Northern NSW Football's top-flight women's league in 2020 but are yet to win a finals match. Finals were not played in 2021 due to COVID.\nMeanwhile, Olympic will be without leading scorer Jemma House for the semi-final.\nHouse is headed to the United States this week to be inducted into the Laramie County Community College 2023 Hall of Fame Class.\nThe 26-year-old was an All-American in two seasons - 2015 and 2016 - with the Golden Eagles.\nRELATED:",
