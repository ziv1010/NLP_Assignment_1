He must also perform 300 hours of unpaid community service work.\nAnd now the punishment has gotten even worse for the 21-year-old following the confirmation that the NRL has deregistered the player.\nAmone was given five days to appeal the decision. The Daily Telegraph is reporting the youngster has accepted the decision and will not appeal.",
