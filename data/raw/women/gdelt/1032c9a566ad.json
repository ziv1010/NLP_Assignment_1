  "body_text": "Hundreds of students staged a walkout at a Broward school on Tuesday after their principal and four staff members were removed over allegations that a transgender student was allowed to play on the girls' volleyball team.\nCurrently, a state law — called the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act — prohibits transgender students from playing on girls’ sports teams.\nThe demonstration at Monarch High School in Coconut Creek, came the day after district officials announced the five employees would be reassigned to non-school sites \"pending the outcome of an investigation into allegations of improper student participation in sports\".\nREAD MORE: As schools lose students, Broward's superintendent grapples with possibility of closures\n“That’s not an indication of discipline,\" Broward County Schools Superintendent Peter Licata said at a press conference Tuesday morning. \"It’s an indication that we want to make sure that when we investigate, it’s done properly and appropriately.\n\"Again, we want to make sure we do this right. Nobody is guilty of anything at this point, that’s what an investigation is for.”\nMonarch Principal James Cecil along with an assistant principal, athletic director, temporary athletic director and an information management technician at the school will be working at different locations for the time being, Licata said.\nIn response, students at Monarch High School walked out of classes and poured onto the football field around noon on Tuesday, according to the Miami Herald.\nDuring the peaceful 30-minute demonstration, students chanted messages like “Let Her Play,” “Trans Rights are Human Rights” and “Free Cecil Now” in support of their classmate and principal, the newspaper reported.\nThe district's decision has drawn questions from the president of the county's teachers union — and criticism from a local LGBTQ community leader.\n\"We are appalled by Broward Schools’ response. The reassignment of faculty is a measure typically reserved for the gravest of infractions. In this case, it is not only an overreaction but also a glaring misjudgment,\" reads a statement from Scott Galvin, executive director of Safe Schools South Florida.\n\"Facilitating a young person’s participation in school activities, particularly in sports, is a commendable act that fosters inclusivity and acceptance, not one that warrants punitive measures.\"\nTallahassee officials notified\nLicata said BCPS was alerted about the player in a call from a \"constituent\" last week. The reassignments were initially announced on Nov. 27, on the return from Thanksgiving break.\n“Listen, our first priority are students. No matter what, it’s students. And making sure that they have the support ... they’re also protected and that we are following the laws to do that,\" Licata added.\nHe confirmed that BCPS has also notified Tallahassee officials about the plans to investigate Monarch staff members.\nAccording to the Miami Herald, Moira Sweeting-Miller, the school’s assistant principal, will serve as interim principal while the investigation takes place.\nIt’s currently unclear whether the staff members being investigated knew about the state law or whether the student will be allowed to play on the volleyball team next year.\nThe Monarch Girls Volleyball team Instagram account posted in support of their teammate on Tuesday, featuring photos of the walkout and the message \"Protect Trans Kids!\"\nREAD MORE: The first day of school for Broward students - and the district's new superintendent",
