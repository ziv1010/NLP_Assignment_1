The website said former Texas Tech star Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs was one of the people Sorsby called to break the news.He had a stellar season for the Bearcats this season, throwing for 2,800 yards and 27 touchdowns while being intercepted five times. Sorsby also rushed for nine scores.\nSorsby has three seasons of starting experience, one for Indiana in 2023 and two with Cincinnati.\nOverall, Sorsby has passed for 7,208 career yards and 60 touchdowns against 18 interceptions. He has 1,305 yards and 22 touchdowns on the ground.\nTexas Tech spent a lot of money on transfers last offseason and it paid off with a program-record 12 wins. The Red Raiders were the No. 4 seed in the College Football Playoff but were blanked in their lone playoff game, a 23-0 loss to No. 5 Oregon.\nQuarterback Behren Morton completed 18 of 32 passes for 137 yards and two interceptions and Texas Tech had just 215 yards.\nAlso, Sorsby is the boyfriend of Texas Tech women's volleyball player Gretchen Sigman, who transferred from Cincinnati to Texas Tech in mid-December.\nLSU reportedly will host Arizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt on a visit Monday. Leavitt was interested in Texas Tech and visited Kentucky over the weekend.\n--Field Level Media\nShares\nShare\nTweet\nShare\nFlip\nEmail\nGet a daily dose of Herald Globe news through our daily email, its complimentary and keeps you fully up to date with world and business news as well.\nPublish news of your business, community or sports group, personnel appointments, major event and more by submitting a news release to Herald Globe.\nMore InformationHONG KONG: China has begun taxing contraceptive drugs and devices from the start of 2026, ending a tax exemption that had been in place...\nNEW YORK CITY, New York: Zohran Mamdani took his midnight oath of office on a centuries-old Quran, making him the first New York City...\nWhile Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife are being shipped to a Federal prison in New York City, after being abducted...\nWASHINGTON, DC - U.S. President Donald Trump in a shock announcement has revealed the United States has abducted Venezuelan President...\nPACIFIC GROVE, California: A 55-year-old woman whose body was found days after she had gone missing in a shark last week off the Northern...\nGELSENKIRCHEN, Germany: Thieves drilled into a German bank vault in Gelsenkirchen and stole tens of millions of euros worth of property...\n(Photo credit: Jerome Miron-Imagn Images) Cincinnati's Brendan Sorsby, considered the top quarterback in the transfer portal, said...\n(Photo credit: Jim Dedmon-Imagn Images) The Los Angeles Rams will travel cross country as the No. 5 seed in the NFC to play at a...\nCHANGCHUN, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- Amid the constant hum of scanners and the swift movements of workers, countless parcels zipped along...\n(Photo credit: Steven Bisig-Imagn Images) While 14 teams from all eight divisions made this year's NFL playoffs, the betting market...\nKathmandu [Nepal], January 5 (ANI): Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) has named a 15-member senior women's squad for the ICC Women's...\n(Photo credit: Kiyoshi Mio-Imagn Images) Luka Doncic flirted with a triple-double with 36 points, nine rebounds and eight assists,...",
