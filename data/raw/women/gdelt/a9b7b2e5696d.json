Rowling for her world-conquering fantasy books.\nBut it has gained a following around the world and it came to Katwadde, deep in rural southern Uganda, in 2013 thanks to primary school teacher John Ssentamu, who discovered the sport after reading a Harry Potter book over the shoulder of someone on a bus.\n\"The word 'Quidditch' meant nothing to me, neither in English nor in any other language, so I went on Google,\" Ssentamu, 47, told AFP.\n\"I was like hey it's a game... it's beautiful. I think I could introduce this to my community,\" he said.\nSsentamu put together a team around Good Shepherd Primary school where he teaches.\nTen years of hard work paid off in 2023 when Ssentamu's team hosted and won the first national quadball tournament. The east African country now has more than 200 players.\nThe aim of quadball is to throw balls through hoops. But Ssentamu loves the way it combines elements of netball, football, volleyball, and rugby and also the equality between men and women, which is an official requirement for every team.\nBut without magic, reality can intrude.\nThe team lacks the funds to travel, said Ssentamu, and despite invitations, they have been unable to attend the quadball World Cup, held every two years since 2012 in Europe or the Americas.\nThirty-one teams took part in the last World Cup, a three-day event in Belgium last year.\n\"My dream is to see a team from here going to the World Cup of Quidditch, because it would be a revelation for the whole world,\" he said.\nStill, the sport has boosted the community in Katwadde, attracting children to the school in an area where education is not always a priority.\nVicky Edith Nabbanja, Ssentamu's daughter, is one of the \"beaters\", who can temporarily knock opposing players out of the game with dodgeballs.\n\"It has brought youth together and it has opened up their minds\" while also helping to create \"a community of belonging\", the 25-year-old said.\npic-jcp/rbu/er/fg\nThis article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.\nCatch your daily dose of Fashion, Taylor Swift, Health, Festivals, Travel, Relationship, Recipe and all the other Latest Lifestyle News on Hindustan Times Website and APPs.",
