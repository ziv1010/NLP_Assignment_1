  "body_text": "TV presenter Christine Lampard has opened up about the “absolute sense of fear” she felt growing up in Co Down during The Troubles.\nThe ITV star, who was born in Newry in 1979 but grew up in Newtownards, recalled being fraught with worry for the safety of her father Frederick Bleakley who travelled regularly to play gigs.\nSpeaking on the Loose Women podcast, the 46-year-old said: 'I remember just an absolute sense of fear growing up, particularly when I was younger than even my teen years, because my Dad was a musician…so he was out on the road all of the time and it was at a point where people were going into various bars and clubs and just shooting around them.\n\"And many musicians had lost their lives in various atrocities over the years back home.\n“I remember having a terrible feeling, what I didn't realise was anxiety.\n\"There was no term for it then. It was just, it's just what you felt in your gut. But I remember as a very young child, having complete and utter panic that Dad hadn't arrived home.\n“And of course, by the nature of what he was doing, he wasn't coming home until maybe one in the morning, maybe two in the morning. I would have had school the next day, I couldn't sleep until I heard him drive up outside the house.”\nThe former Bloomfield Collegiate School pupil and Queen’s University Belfast student recalled her mother Nina telling her how she once had to scoop her toddler out of the bathtub in panic as bombs exploded nearby.\n“I remember, even at a very young age, being very panicked about it. For example, when I was about two or three, I don't really remember this myself, but my sister and I were in the bath,” Christine explained.\n'”My mum vividly remembers the door being knocked and it was the army saying, 'Get out of the house,' because there was a bomb scare in the area.\n“Mum had to scoop two wet children out of the bath, wrap us up as best she could, and get us out of the house. I remember those kinds of things. Looking back now, it's almost crazy to explain it to anyone.\n“In my hometown, at night, large bollards would be placed to close off the road through the heart of the town because that's often where bombs would be detonated. They would shut the roads. These kinds of things became our absolute norm.”\nChristine also discussed her marriage to ex-Chelsea star Frank Lampard (46) with co-star Nadia Sawalha on the podcast and revealed the secret to her lasting happiness – the couple married in 2015 and have two children together, Patricia (6) and Freddie (4).\n“We're still absolute best mates,” Christine said.\n“He'll be the first person I'll pick the phone up to sort anything out with.\n“And the biggest thing for me going back to my love of comedy, is he makes me laugh.\n“And that is such a powerful thing to me – I have to be able to have a giggle… We just have proper laughs. We have the same points of view on things.\n“We don't argue over parenting or how things run in the house. We sort of sing off the same page and that sort of makes everything flow…The basis is, there's love, we've got each other's backs and we're supportive.\n“And if he suggests that some job is happening and he wants to do it, we'll make it work.”\nChristine recalled supporting her former midfielder husband when he was under pressure at Stamford Bridge and during his 15 year stint for England.\n“I remember often when he was playing, and the pressures of, you know, doing a job where there's millions of people watching you,” she said.\n\"I think it was even pre he and I getting together, and there were a couple of moments obviously where it didn't go according to plan, when you're playing for your country and you've got the entire country pointing at you afterwards.\n“It's interesting recently with Gareth Southgate talking about groups of men coming together and being supportive of one another and everything else.\n“It really resonated with me because Frank had been through the football thing and the need for feeling like you've got a team, a tribe, a group of people around you that will support you when you're you're kind of having moments of feeling 'oh, I should be strong, but I'm just not feeling it today – but how do I really tell everybody because they'll never understand?'\n\"So yeah, that was something I would always have been very aware of with him.”\nThe former Daybreak presenter, who got her start in television working on a programme fronted by RTE’s Late Late Show host Patrick Kielty, said Frank would sometimes cancel dinner and drinks dates if a match didn't get the result he wanted telling her “I don’t want to go” at the last minute due to “anger” that he didn’t want to talk about to anyone.\n'It was like he needed to kind-of decompress, and then he was ready to go again Monday morning,” Christine said.\n“But there were loads of those moments where he thought 'no, no, no,' and he'd be so angry with himself if something didn't go according to plan.”\nLoose Women: The Podcast is available to watch on ITVX and YouTube.",
