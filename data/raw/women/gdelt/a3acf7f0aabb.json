That's the worst air quality in the world.\nThe National Weather Service issued an alert about the air quality in New York City on Wednesday afternoon, writing that \"the New York State Department of Health recommends that individuals consider limiting strenuous outdoor physical activity to reduce the risk of adverse health effects.\"\nThe alert is in effect until midnight Thursday.\nThe Phillies and Tigers were also in action at Citizens Bank Park on Tuesday when the AQI was listed at 188, which is considered unhealthy. The air quality in Philadelphia worsened since, with the AQI being listed at 247, which is considered to be very unhealthy.\nThe National Weather Service issued a Code Orange in Philadelphia on Wednesday, which \"means that air pollution concentrations within the region may become unhealthy for sensitive groups.\"\nAdditionally, the National Women's Soccer League postponed a match between the NJ/NY Gotham and Orlando Pride on Wednesday at Red Bull Arena due to the poor air quality.\nThe match has been rescheduled for August 9 at 7:30 p.m. ET.\nAnd while WNBA games are played indoors, the league opted to postpone Wednesday's contest between the New York Liberty and Minnesota Lynx at Barclays Center due to the air quality.\nAround 98 million people across parts of 18 states were under air quality alerts on Wednesday, per NBC News.\nWhile the Canadian wildfire season typically runs from May through October, this significant of an impact is rare just one month into the season, according to Cara Korte of CBS News. Record heat and drought have contributed to the issue as the Earth continues to warm due to climate change.",
