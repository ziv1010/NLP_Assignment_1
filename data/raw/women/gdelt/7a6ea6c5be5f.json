  "body_text": "Taylor Swift’s dating life has been a national obsession since she started writing love songs at age 15. And, after her split from longtime love Joe Alwyn this past spring, she’s been linked to a few famous faces. The latest: Kansas City Chiefs star player Travis Kelce.\nIt might seem like this news is coming out of left field, but there have been a few little hints here and there that *could* possibly point towards a connection. Specifically, Travis shared on his New Heights podcast that he went to a Taylor Swift concert at Kansas City’s Arrowhead Stadium in hopes of meeting the queen herself. What's more, he wanted to give her his phone number.\n“If you’re up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets. I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it,” he said. “She doesn’t meet anybody, or at least she didn’t want to meet me, so I took it personal.\"\nFor what it's worth, Tay's tour had no scheduled meet-and-greets, so it makes sense that Travis didn’t get the chance to see her.\nNow, there are reports that the two actually did link up. So, who is Travis Kelce and what's going on with Taylor and Travis? Here’s what you need to know.\nWho is Travis Kelce?\nTravis is a NFL player who plays tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs. He has won the Super Bowl twice (including last year), so he's a pretty big deal and a well-known face in the sports world.\n\"There's one thing about getting your first one, and it's a whole other feeling to get two,\" Kelce said after winning the Super Bowl last year, per NFL.com. \"I wanted this one more than I wanted a game in my life. The guys in this locker room, the teammates that I have felt the same way.\"\nAnd, because you'll ask: The Ohio native is 6'5, and is currently 33 years old. He was born on October 5, which makes him a Libra to Taylor's Sagittarius. Taylor is about three months younger than the football star (both were born in 1989).\nHow did he meet Taylor Swift?\nThat’s a great question! It’s possible Tay or someone on Tay's team heard about his podcast and then reached out or they connected some other way. But that's just a total guess. Right now, it’s a total mystery.\nHis brother is another famous NFL player.\nSo…Travis isn’t the only start football player in his family. His big brother is Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce. Jason has also won a Super Bowl (but lost to Travis' team, the Chiefs, last year in the Super Bowl).\nJason is a big name in football and especially in Philadelphia, where he’s considered the backbone of his team. He's even the subject of the new Prime Video documentary, Kelce, which also features Travis.\nAnother fun fact: These brothers actually played college football together at the University of Cincinnati.\nAre Taylor and Travis actually dating?\nIt’s really hard to say at this point. And neither Taylor nor Travis' teams have confirmed anything. A source told ET that the two are “not officially” dating, which might mean that they’ve been out to dinner once or twice, or that they merely hung out one time.\nJason also deflected questions about it last night after the Eagles beat the Vikings, saying on NFL on Prime Video that he’d heard the rumors, adding, “I cannot comment.” Of course, that just led to more speculation.\n“Ever since Catching Kelce [Travis' reality show] everybody’s been infatuated with Travis’ love life,” Jason said. “I don’t really know what’s going on there, but I know Travis is having fun and we’ll see what happens with whoever he ends up with.”\nWho has Travis dated previously?\nTravis has repeatedly talked on New Heights about being single, but he was previously in a five-year on-and-off-again relationship with reporter Kayla Nicole, per People. He also briefly dated Maya Benberry, who won a reality show Jason starred in called Catching Kelce.\nTravis has repeatedly laughed about being the subject of a reality show, with Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes noting on Netflix’s Quarterback that the tight end “hated” it. (The Chiefs hilariously had an offensive play called \"Catching Kelce\" to tease Travis about it.)\nBut it's a well-reported fact that Travis is single right now, Taylor is single, and he’s considered one of the most likable players in the NFL. Sounds like it could be a good match to me! So…stay tuned for more details here.",
