  "body_text": "LeiLanni Nesbeth Aiming For Pro Contract\n[Written by Stephen Wright]\nLeiLanni Nesbeth is hoping to sign for a professional club in Europe after ending her college career on a high by winning the NCAA Championship title.\nNesbeth helped Florida State University [FSU] defeat Stanford University 5-1 in the showpiece final at the WakeMed Soccer Park in Cary, North Carolina, on Monday [December 4].\nThe 22-year-old, who has completed her master’s degree in sports management and graduates next week, said England or Spain are her “most likely” destinations.\n“Conversations will be had with my coaches, my family and different parties to help me during this process,” Nesbeth told Bernews. “It’s going to be interesting and fun to see what happens.\n“I’m looking at somewhere in Europe; I’m open to Spain and the UK – anywhere in Europe. I’ll also see what the NWSL [National Women’s Soccer League] has to offer.\n“It’s super-exciting to see how the women’s game is growing. Every year there seems to be drastic improvements in the NWSL and Europe.”\nNesbeth, who helped FSU win the national title in 2021, although she did not play in the final, said lifting the trophy was a moment she will forever cherish.\n“It was tremendous to return to the college cup final and experience playing on that stage,” said Nesbeth, who is part of the team’s leadership group.\n“Stanford are an excellent team with some attacking threats, but our ability to execute in front of goal proved the difference.\n“We have some incredible players who can do incredible things and managed to limit their scoring chances.\n“We came to fight, came out swinging, and got rewarded. To end my college career in this way means everything.”\nThe attacking midfielder missed Bermuda’s Concacaf W Gold Cup qualifiers because of her college commitments but praised the team’s efforts after they narrowly missed out on reaching the play-offs, losing 2-0 away to the Dominican Republic yesterday.\n“Coach Naquita [Robinson] continues to have so much passion for the players and the girls growing up on the island,” added Nesbeth, who briefly played for Brighton & Hove Albion Women several years ago.\n“The programme continues to grow and improve; it’s cool to be part of it. It’s heading in the right direction.”",
