  "body_text": "BIRTHDAY GIRL LILY Agg was among the goals as Irish-heavy Birmimgham City enjoyed an important 3-0 win at Sunderland to move them top of the Championship table.\nThe Blues will sit at the summit for Christmas after leapfrogging the Saints and edging Charlton Athletic on goal difference.\nAgg opened the scoring on her 30th birthday, having started alongside Louise Quinn, Lucy Quinn and Jamie Finn.\nAll but Lucy Quinn played the full game, with Louise Quinn captaining the Blues to a memorable win.\nThere was plenty of Irish involvement elsewhere in the second tier, as Durham beat Southampton 1-0, Reading and Crystal Palace drew 1-1 and Watford and London City Lionesses could not be separated in a six-goal thriller.\nCaitlin Hayes scored again in Scotland as her Celtic side drew 1-1 with Hearts, while Abbie Larkin bagged an assist in Glasgow City’s 6-0 hammering of Partick Thistle.\nThat’s now 10 goals for club and country since September for centre-half Hayes.\n'56 - LEVEL! Some nice football from the Celts and @caitlin5hayes takes it in inside the area to twist and bullet a great finish under the keeper!👊\n— Celtic FC Women (@CelticFCWomen) December 17, 2023\n♥️1-1🍀#HEACEL | #SWPL | #COYGIG pic.twitter.com/Gkd7xQa7AI\nIn the Women’s Super League, Chelsea bounced back from their thrashing by Arsenal to beat Bristol City 3-0 at Ashton Gate and ensure they went into the winter break three points clear at the top.\nThe Blues went down 4-1 at the Emirates Stadium a week ago, but Lauren James’ superb effort in the 17th minute set them on their way on Sunday before Erin Cuthbert scored with a volley and Sam Kerr added a header.\nThe visitors also had Niamh Charles sent off in stoppage time as they took advantage of Arsenal’s shock 1-0 defeat to Tottenham on Saturday to open up a gap at the top. Megan Connolly and Chloe Mustaki both played the full game for Bristol.\nManchester City moved ahead of the Gunners into second place on goal difference after Bunny Shaw’s hat-trick earned a 4-1 win against Everton.\nShaw quickly made amends for having a penalty saved when she put City in front in the ninth minute and she added a second before Jill Roord extended the lead.\nAurora Galli pulled one back with an incredible strike in the second half, but Shaw’s header completed her treble and sealed a fourth straight league win for City. Courtney Brosnan, Heather Payne and Megan Campbell all featured for the Toffees.\nLiverpool earned their first WSL victory over Manchester United after coming from behind to win 2-1 at Leigh Sports Village.\nElla Toone opened the scoring for the hosts just three minutes in, but the Reds levelled through Millie Turner’s own goal.\nCaptain Taylor Hinds then found the winner in the 68th minute as Liverpool moved level on points with fourth-placed United. Leanne Kiernan came off the bench late on.\nHonoka Hayashi’s stoppage-time equaliser salvaged a point for West Ham in a dramatic 1-1 draw with Leicester at the King Power Stadium.\nThe Hammers were left to rue their missed opportunities when Lena Petermann put the Foxes ahead in the 68th minute.\nA poor afternoon got worse for West Ham when captain Hawa Cissoko was sent off in added time, but Hayashi struck in the eighth minute of time added on to lift the visitors off the foot of the table.\nMegan Walsh and Jess Ziu both started for West Ham, with Jessie Stapleton introduced late on and Izzy Atkinson held in reserve.\nMeanwhile, 2023 Ireland call-up Alannah McEvoy is one of several players departing Shamrock Rovers.\nThe SSE Airtricity Women’s Premier Division side confirmed six departures over the weekend, with mid-season signing Tiegan Ruddy, goalkeepers Summer Lawless and Jayne Merren, Orlaith O’Mahony and Abby Tuthill all exiting.\nAoibhe Fleming also recently departed.\nMcEvoy scored four goals in 18 of Rovers’ 20 league games. The former Peamount United attacker was called up to the Ireland senior squad for the pre-World Cup double-header against USA, though is yet to debut.\nElsewhere, Armagh ladies football star Alex Clarke has signed for Linfield.\n- Additional reporting by Press Association",
