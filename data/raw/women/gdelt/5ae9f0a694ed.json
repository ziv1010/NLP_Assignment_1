  "body_text": "x\nMonday night's game between the 10-2 and 2-10 teams went just as we expected.\nThe New England Patriots won their 10th consecutive game to cap Week 13, defeating the New York Giants (2-11), 33-15. Here's our rapid reaction to a \"Monday Night Football\" blowout.\nThere's no other way to put it. The Giants have stopped caring.\nLate in the second half, while already trailing 27-7, interim head coach Mike Kafka elected against going for it on a 4th-and-1, instead taking a delay of game penalty and punting to the Patriots, who marched 67 yards in five plays to tack on a field goal as time expired in the first half.\nThe Giants were criticized online and by ESPN NFL analyst Jason Kelce for the pathetic move.\n\"You're given an opportunity to get some momentum going into half,\" Kelce said. \"It's fourth-and-inches, like it's barely anything. I don't know why you wouldn't try to get that, then get the ball coming out of half to make it a game,\" he questioned at halftime.\nESPN analyst Mina Kimes and The Athletic's Derrik Klassen were among several who derided the decision on social media.\nThe Giants said\n— Mina Kimes (@minakimes.bsky.social) 2025-12-02T02:41:02.817Z\nnow why should we care about the game if the Giants don't\n— Derrik Klassen (@qbklass.bsky.social) 2025-12-02T02:39:27.628Z\n…they’re not seriously gonna punt the ball here right\n— JP Acosta (@acosta32jp.bsky.social) 2025-12-02T02:38:49.245Z\nYou can turn off the game when a team is losing by 20 and punts on 4th and 1. If they don’t want to try you don’t have to watch\n— Rodger Sherman (@rodger.bsky.social) 2025-12-02T02:40:06.006Z\nNew York certainly looked like a team entering Monday at 2-10 and out of playoff contention, going through the motions before this dreadful season ends. When searching for its next head coach this offseason, the franchise's main objective should be finding one who cares.\nThe second-year quarterback is a bona fide league MVP candidate, and he showed why with a precise, explosive performance in primetime. Maye finished 24-of-31 for 282 yards and two touchdowns, taking complete command of the offense while guiding the Patriots to a league-leading 11th win.\nHe showed phenomenal touch on both touchdown passes, the first a floater to wideout Kayshon Boutte on a 1st-and-goal from New York's 3-yard line and the second a deep 33-yard missile to receiver Kyle Williams.\nDrake Maye drops it in the bucket to Kayshon Boutte\n— NFL (@NFL) December 2, 2025\nNYGvsNE on ESPN/ABC\nStream on @NFLPlus and ESPN App pic.twitter.com/5p0tUQ3Q2Y\nBig time throw and catch from Drake Maye to Kyle Williams for six\n— NFL (@NFL) December 2, 2025\nNYGvsNE on ESPN/ABC\nStream on @NFLPlus and ESPN App pic.twitter.com/BjYa055Dhj\nMaye is playing with maturity far beyond that of a normal second-year quarterback. In an NFL that's as wide open as anytime in recent memory, each week, there are fewer reasons to doubt Maye could not only be named MVP but also lead the Patriots to another Super Bowl win.\nOne day, perhaps, Jaxson Dart will learn to protect himself. But it probably won't be in 2025. The buzzy rookie first-round quarterback won't have a promising future for long if he keeps putting himself in harm's way, like he did when going for extra yards on a first-quarter scramble.\nInstead of going out of bounds on the second-down play, Dart tiptoed the sideline only to get sent flying after being hit by Patriots linebacker Christian Elliss, prompting a kerfuffle that resulted in an unnecessary roughness call against the Giants.\nWhat happened after Patriots LB Christian Elliss hit Jaxson Dart:\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 2, 2025\npic.twitter.com/WWDuc95LrX\nAfter the play, ESPN color commentator Troy Aikman described Kafka as \"tired\" of having to keep reminding Dart, who missed the past two games with a concussion, to prioritize his health.\nDart displayed what gave the Giants hope on a two-point try in the fourth quarter, buying time after the pocket collapsed and finding wide receiver Darius Slayton for the successful conversion.\n& the 2-point conversion ✌️\n— New York Giants (@Giants) December 2, 2025\n: ESPN pic.twitter.com/8PEPol2dIC\nThe Giants have to figure out how to allow Dart to play freely while curbing his reckless tendencies. It's a delicate balancing act, but one the Giants must nail. Their future depends on it.\nMore must-reads:\n- Drake Maye furthers his MVP case in Patriots' 'MNF' win over Giants\n- Dan Orlovsky shares how Patriots' Drake Maye 'dominated' first 12 weeks of season\n- The 'Super Bowl winning coaches' quiz\n+\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
