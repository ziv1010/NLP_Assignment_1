On second thoughts…\nSo, while not everyone watching on TV at home could make out what was going on, everyone in the venue heard every “ooh” and “ahh”. Having already listened to the German Music Council play a couple of standards and seen some live video of fork-lift trucks stacking sea containers on the docks outside, there was some speculation that this might have been another helping of “local colour”, a live link to the Reeperbahn, perhaps. We wouldn’t know anything about that.\nDid I do hood boules? pic.twitter.com/li1noifhlK\n— Jarvo69 (Daniel Jarvis) (@BMWjarvo) December 2, 2023\nThe inquiry into what really happened was in full swing by the time the media reached the mixed zone, with journalists and the various managers of the national teams present at the draw comparing notes on exactly when the heavy petting started and debating whether it was just quite funny or very funny. UEFA officials had to put on sterner faces while refusing to comment because they did not want to give the culprit the publicity he so obviously craves.\nBut the investigation was over before it started, as Jarvis solved the riddle by revealing it was Miss Scarlet in the ballroom with a mobile phone taped to the bottom of some scenery. The same MO for his hijacking of BBC Match of the Day’s live coverage of Wolves v Liverpool in the FA Cup earlier this year.\nThere is a serious point to make here, though, as UEFA does not have a particularly good recent record when it comes to safety and security at its big events. What if someone with more sinister motives than Jarvis strolled into the draw rehearsal and left something hidden on the stage?\nAdvertisement\nFor what it’s worth, this journalist was not challenged in any way when he walked into the venue for the draw until he reached the media accreditation desk on the eighth floor of the building, one below the entrance to the concert hall.\nIn terms of the actual draw, the English media was in total agreement that things had gone rather well because not only had England avoided all of the big beasts slumming it in pots three and four, but the managers of their opponents are consummate media pros. We barely had to tee them up and they were smashing quotable lines out of the park.\nFirst through the mixed zone was Serbia manager Dragan Stojkovic.\n“England are one of the best teams in Europe – one of the very, very serious candidates to get the trophy,” he played to the gallery.\n“Can you say something nice about Jude Bellingham, please?” we begged.\n“At the moment he is very close to being the best and he is going to be the best,” Stojkovic, a pretty tasty midfielder himself back in the day, replied. “He made a good choice to go to Real Madrid to get the Golden Ball as the best player – only at Real Madrid can he do that. If England wins the championship, he’s going to be the best player of the Euros, definitely.”\nNext to arrive was Denmark’s boss Kasper Hjulmand, who agreed that “England are a great team, with a great manager” but reminded us that his team have a score to settle from 2021 and England’s semi-final win at Wembley. “I still wake up at night thinking about that match,” said Hjulmand.\nSouthgate is getting used to people saying nice things about his team but is not about to be lulled into a false sense of security.\n“Yes… other managers will often tell you what they think you want to hear, so I’m not always seduced by what they say,” he said. “No, it’s nice, we have a team that’s respected around Europe. People will see the results, people will see the performances, and we’re treated really well when we travel.”\nGO DEEPER\nEngland's Euro 2024 squad state of play: who goes, who misses out\nAnd “nice” was the general vibe. We tried to find something for Southgate to moan about, but he was not biting.\nAdvertisement\nThe best we could come up with was the observation that he might not get to see all of his players as quickly as he would like to at the end of the domestic season because they may have one more club game to play: the Champions League final at Wembley.\nThat game is scheduled for June 1, two weeks before Euro 2024 starts.\n“Yeah, but we had that last time around with Chelsea–Man City (in 2021),” he said, far too sensibly. “We’re used to dealing with that. You’d love to have all of the players for all of the prep camps, but that’s not our reality.\n“It’s important they get some sort of psychological break in between but, of course, the longer they play, the less you can give them.”\nThis exchange highlights one of the reasons England appear to be a bit more likeable these days: Southgate. He is a decent bloke who does not complain.\nCompare his predicament to the one facing Wales boss Rob Page, whose flight to Hamburg was delayed by the bad weather and only just took his seat in the concert hall as the music struck up. Then his side’s possible reward for getting through the play-offs is a place in Group D, for death, alongside France, Austria and the Netherlands.\nAnd while Southgate may have to train without a couple of his superstars for a day or two, Page does not have a goalkeeper who is currently playing first-team club football.\nGO DEEPER\nAnswering your questions about Euro 2024\nSpeaking of international manager selection headaches, Stojkovic was asked if he was concerned that his talisman, Aleksandar Mitrovic, might be a little undercooked given his summer move from the Premier League to the Saudi Pro League.\n“The level is not the Premier League – it’s not Fulham,” said Stojkovic, quickly ruling himself out of a post-Euro 2024 move to Al Shabab. “It’s a different level but he is already a mature and professional guy.”\nThere is absolutely no questioning Mitrovic’s “thinking about the game” – he has that nailed.\nAdvertisement\nThis was the Al Hilal star’s assessment of his team’s 3-0 victory over Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al Nassr in the Riyadh derby on Friday, when he scored two goals.\n“To be honest, I don’t think I ever played in a better derby,” said Mitrovic to the Saudi league’s press office, proving that it is not only international managers who tell people what they want to hear.\nGO DEEPER\nAnalysis and predictions from today’s Euro 2024 draw\nOn the subject of derbies, by far the biggest football story in Hamburg this weekend was Friday’s 2-2 draw between St Pauli, the city’s plucky underdog, and Hamburg, the six-time German champions and former European Cup winners.\nThese games do not need any trimmings to make them proper football feasts, but this one pitted the team top of Germany’s second division, St Pauli, against the side in second, Hamburg.\nGO DEEPER\nDerby Days, Hamburg: The Stadtderby\nAnd while the latter have enjoyed a lot more success in these games over the years, the former will be kicking themselves that they let slip a 2-0 lead with about half an hour to go, particularly as “their” second goal was one of the funniest own goals you will ever see in professional football – and far funnier than Jarvo69’s ringtone.\nHamburg's goalkeeper scored the craziest own goal 💀 pic.twitter.com/pGTi4rePiu\n— GOAL (@goal) December 2, 2023\nHighlights of that game were all over German TV on Saturday morning as UEFA’s Executive Committee met at The Atlantic, a suitably decent hotel on the banks of Hamburg’s Lake Alster.\nThe main items of news to come from the three-hour meeting were the decision to expand the Women’s Champions League from 16 to 18 teams from the 2025-26 season and the decision to create a second European competition for the women’s club game.\nAs well as the two extra teams, the main women’s competition is moving to the same league-phase format as the men’s tournament. This format has become known as the “Swiss model” despite repeated protests from Swiss-model experts who say UEFA’s version of the format is nothing like the real thing.\nAdvertisement\nThe important bit, though, is that both the men’s and women’s premier European club competitions are scrapping the group stages that fans have become increasingly bored of and replacing them with one big league table where each team plays a selection of the other teams in the league. In the women’s case, this will be six teams, three games at home, three away.\nTo be honest, this is all UEFA has said about the tournament and it has said nothing at all about the format for the second competition. This is a shame and you cannot help but wonder why the governing body let what sounds like good news dribble out in this way, five hours before the draw for the men’s Euros.\nPerhaps it should have another go this week when everyone has more time to give women’s club football the attention it deserves. Just a thought.\nGO DEEPER\nComplete Euro 2024 schedule\nMore detail, however, was forthcoming on the all-important distribution of prize money at next summer’s tournament.\nEach of the 24 finalists will receive €9.25million (£7.9m; $10.1m) for turning up, with a group-stage win bonus of €1m and €500,000 for a draw. Qualification to the round of 16 will be worth €1.25m, while a quarter-final berth will bring €2.5m. Win that one and you are looking at a cheque for €4m, with the losing finalists getting €5m and the 2024 European champions taking home the Henri Delaunay Trophy and a cool €8m.\nSo, Gareth, Rob, Dragan, Kasper and all the other managers we met in Hamburg, your task is clear: win the lot and earn your federation’s eternal gratitude and €28.5m.\nStay up to date with all of The Athletic’s Euro 2024 coverage.
