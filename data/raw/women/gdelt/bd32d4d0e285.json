And that is often what makes footballers great, isn’t it?\n“Not overthinking things or giving in to external pressure too much, because, of course, at 17 he is already a global figure and everyone is talking about him, including everyone around him.\n“It must be quite difficult to manage that, right? Maybe it’s because he handles things so naturally that it doesn’t affect him. And that is impressive, too.\nALSO READ: Minister Silaa attends Mobile World Congress 2025 in Barcelona\n“I speak from outside because it also surprises me. And the other day, at the Giuseppe Meazza [San Siro], well, it was always about giving the ball to Lamine Yamal, wasn’t it?”\nBonmatí, who helped Barcelona win a sixth successive Liga F title at the weekend, was able to take advantage of some days off to travel to Milan as a supporter.\nDespite Barça, the team’s she supported since a kid, exiting the Champions League, it was still a one-off experience for her.\n“I’ve lost my voice because of that game… or thanks to that game,” she added.\n“It was a unique experience. It was the first time watching Barça’s men’s team outside of Barcelona. I had never had the chance to go to another European stadium and watch them.\n“I had two days off and I didn’t think twice. It was a spectacular semifinal. Despite the loss, it was a throwback to that feeling of being a fan, when I was a kid.\n“I’m on the other side of it every week, with the fans in the stadium, but for that day I was a kid again, experiencing a game as a supporter, forgetting Aitana the footballer and being Aitana the person.\nIt may prove the only competition Barça’s men’s and women’s teams don’t win this season. Under Hansi Flick, the men have already won the Spanish Supercopa and the Copa del Rey, while Sunday’s 4-3 win over Real Madrid means they need just two points from their final three games to win LaLiga.\nThe women added the Liga F title to the Supercopa at the weekend and have finals to come in the Champions League, against Arsenal on May 24, and the Copa de la Reina, against Atlético Madrid on June 7.",
