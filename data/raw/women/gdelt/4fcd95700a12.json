  "body_text": "Barbora Votikova was over the moon to arrive at the Sobha Realty Training Centre for the first time on Tuesday.\nWe completed the signing of the Czech goalkeeper from Slavia Prague on loan and, shortly after, she had her first club interview.\n“It feels amazing,” she said. “I’m really excited to join this special club. I found out recently, to be honest, so it was a quick move but I didn't really have to think twice about anything and I was super excited for this opportunity.\n“Arsenal is the top club in the world or one of the biggest and with the biggest ambitions and with a special team and special players. So for me, it's a really huge honour to join this club.”\nBarbora is no stranger to playing in the Barclays Women’s Super League, having previously been between the sticks at Tottenham Hotspur.\n“I’m excited about the level again,” she said. “I must say I kind of missed it for the past year and a half. This league is very special and all the games are kind of neck to neck, I would say, and it makes it so interesting and very high level and that's what I am here for.”\nReflecting on the UEFA Women’s Champions League and our success in the competition last season, Barbora added: “It was really fun to watch Arsenal go this far and win the Champions League. I wanted Arsenal to win, to be fair, because it was kind of refreshing.”\nBarbora joins up with a tight goalkeeping union featuring some of the most experienced goalkeepers in the world, and she’s looking forward to getting to work alongside the likes of Daphne van Domselaar, Anneke Borbe and Manuela Zinsberger.\n“We had our first training today, so I'm happy to meet them,” she said. “I am very excited to start to work with them and to learn and share our experiences and to support each other. I hope to bring my experiences and positivity and energy into the group and support the GK union.”\nLastly, we asked Barbora how much she’s looking forward to representing The Arsenal at Emirates Stadium.\n“I am really looking forward to it,” she said. “It was, I would say, my dream to play at Emirates. It's, I think, one of the biggest stadiums and events in the women's football world. So very, very excited.”\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
