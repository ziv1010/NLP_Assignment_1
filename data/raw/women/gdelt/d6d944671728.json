  "body_text": "All UK Sky users get upgrade that offers more things to watch - check your TV now\nIf you have Sky TV then a new app has launched that's offering more things to watch.\nAll Sky Q, Sky Glass and Sky Stream users should now find a new app has landed on their set-top boxes and internet-connected TVs. The popular DAZN service has just announced the launch of a dedicated Sky application which it promises will make finding and watching top-rated sports action a lot easier.\nFor those not in the know, DAZN is now the home of content including premier boxing, MMA, UEFA Women’s Champions League, Saudi Pro League, LIV Golf and games from the NFL. It also has plenty of pay-per-view action including recently showing the showdown between Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk live from Saudi Arabia.\nOnce you're all signed up, you will now be able to launch and watch the action from all of these main events right from the Sky home screen meaning you don't need any other dongles or devices to tune in.\nSpeaking about the update, Shay Segev, DAZN Group CEO, said: “This is excellent news for both DAZN and Sky customers.\n“It makes it even easier to access the DAZN app in the UK and Ireland. We are the global home of boxing – more than 150 fights across 2024 alone – and combat sports, and women’s football as well as the Saudi Pro League, Ironman and much more. The app is live on Sky for our boxing PPV mega event, 5 vs 5, which sees the best fighters from Matchroom and Queensbury going head-to-head. DAZN is growing rapidly and constantly investing in new content and technology, so it’s the perfect time for our service to be available in app form across Sky devices.\"\nSadly, most of DAZN's content is tucked behind a paywall so you will have to splash out if you want to watch premium sporting action.\nREAD MORE: Gmail and Yahoo users should delete 'mystery' Amazon email from their inbox nowPrices vary but Total DAZN - which includes some of the biggest and best events - costs £14.99 per month.\nIf you want to watch DAZN you shouldn't need to restart your devices with the upgrade happening automatically. You should find the DAZN service in the app section of your Sky homepage.\nThis app now joins a host of other services on Sky. These include easy access to Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+, Apple TV+, Hayu, Prime Video and Discovery+.",
