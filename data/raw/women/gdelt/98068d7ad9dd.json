Spain vs England is being shown live in the UK. Brit abroad? Use a VPN to watch the Women's World Cup with your subscription from anywhere.\nThe time has come: England are in a World Cup final for the first time since 1966, as the Lionesses face Spain, with both nations aiming to win their first ever Women's World Cup.\nEngland had never previously gone beyond the semi-finals of this competition, but Sarina Wiegman's European champions have risen to every challenge that has faced them down under, winning all six games en route to the final and beating a team from every continent – culminating in a brilliant 3-1 victory over co-hosts Australia in the last four.\nThat came after the Lionesses had topped their group by defeating Haiti, Denmark and China – then seen off Nigeria on penalties in the last 16, and Colombia in the quarter-finals.\nSpain are also appearing in their first Women's World Cup final, in what is only their third appearance at the tournament – of which they'd never previously progressed beyond the last 16. In fact, this will be La Roja's first final of any major competition.\nJorge Vilda's side have won five of their six games at this World Cup – a 4-0 loss to Japan in their final group match the sole, slightly strange blip – knocking out Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden in the last 16, quarters and semis respectively.\nAfter a thrilling tournament in Australia and New Zealand, it all comes down to this. Will football come home courtesy of the Lionesses? Or will Spain become only the second country, after Germany, to lift both the men's and women's World Cups?\nThis one is not to be missed.\nTeam news\nWiegman named the same starting 11 in each of the last two rounds – and, despite Lauren James being available again after her two-game ban, has named another unchanged line-up for the final.\nSpain make one change, with Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas replaced by Salma Paralluelo.\nEngland XI: Earps; Carter, Bright, Greenwood; Bronze, Stanway, Walsh, Daly; Toone, Russo, Hemp.\nSpain XI: Coll; Batlle, Paredes, Codina, Olga; Abelleira, Bonmati, Hermoso; Redondo, Paralluelo, Caldentey.\nForm\nSpain: WWLWWW\nEngland: WWWWWW\nStadium\nAustralia vs England will be played at Stadium Australia in Sydney, Australia.

You'll be blocked from watching it, which is not ideal if you’ve paid up for a subscription and still want to catch the action without resorting to illegal feeds you’ve found on Reddit.\nBut assistance is on hand. To get around that, all you have to do is get a Virtual Private Network (VPN), assuming it complies with your broadcaster’s T&Cs. A VPN creates a private connection between your device and t'internet, meaning the service can’t work out where you are and won't automatically block the service you've paid for. All the info going between is entirely encrypted – and that's a result.\nThere are plenty of good-value options out there, including:\nExpressVPN including a 30-day, money-back guarantee\nFourFourTwo’s brainy office mates TechRadar love its super speedy connections, trustworthy security and the fact it works with Android, Apple, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, PS4 and loads more. You also get a money-back guarantee, 24/7 support and it's currently available for a knockdown price.
