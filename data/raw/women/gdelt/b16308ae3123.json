  "body_text": "Saudi Arabia’s Sports Ministry has invited construction companies to submit prequalification documents by 13 July for contracts to build sports stadiums as part of its SR10.1bn ($2.7bn) capital projects programme.\nThe ministry expects to notify shortlisted bidders by mid-August before tendering construction contracts. The projects are slated for completion before the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. The projects will also be a component of the joint bid that Saudi Arabia is making to host the Fifa 2030 World Cup alongside Egypt and Greece.\nThe projects are split into four principal elements. The largest of these, and the most immediate, is the construction of a new stadium to the north of Riyadh and the upgrade of five existing football stadiums. The projects are:\n- Increasing the capacity of King Fahd Stadium in Riyadh to 92,000 seats\n- Expanding the seating capacity of Riyadh’s Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium to 45,000\n- Increasing the capacity of Prince Mohammed bin Fahd Stadium to 30,000 seats\n- An increase in seating capacity for the Prince Saud bin Jalawi Stadium in Al-Khair to 45,000\n- The construction of a new, sustainable New Riyadh Stadium in the north of Riyadh with 45,000 seats\nAll five stadium projects are at the design stage, with construction due to start between October this year and February 2024.\nThe next main element of the ministry’s projects programme is the construction of 30 new training grounds and facilities in proximity to the stadiums that will be used for the 2027 competition.\nConstruction on the schemes is expected to start in July 2024 and be completed by December 2025. A total of 18 facilities will be ready in time for the 2026 AFC Women’s Cup.\nOther stadium projects in Saudi Arabia are also progressing. In July 2022, Jeddah Central Development Company (JCDC) signed design and engineering contracts for the stadium at the Jeddah Central project. The design contract was awarded to GMP International and the engineering contract was awarded to Khatib & Alami. A stadium built 300 metres above the ground between the two buildings that comprise The Line at Neom is also planned.\nYou might also like...\nLibya awards five hydrocarbon exploration blocks\n13 February 2026\nSWPC rebrands as Sharakat to reinforce PPP focus\n13 February 2026\nSabic pruning its overseas business is prudent and pragmatic\n13 February 2026\nJoint venture acquires UAE-based renewables developer\n13 February 2026\nA MEED Subscription...\nSubscribe or upgrade your current MEED.com package to support your strategic planning with the MENA region’s best source of business information.
