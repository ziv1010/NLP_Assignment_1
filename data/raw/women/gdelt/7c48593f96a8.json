The (A) team faced a difficult away tie against Castlebar Town; however, Ballinrobe played some great football and were unlucky to lose 1-0. Meanwhile, the Ballinrobe Town (B) team made full use of home advantage by defeating Manulla (B) 2-1, in what was a very competitive fixture at The Green. The goal scorers for Ballinrobe were Connie Feighery and Emily Ryan. Well done to all involved.\nBallinrobe Town were in Super Cup action on Sunday, March 30, when they faced Ballina Town at Belleek Park. The opening exchanges were cagey, however, Ballinrobe very nearly fashioned the lead when Jonathan Lawrence’s free-kick clipped Emmet Peyton’s crossbar.\nThe red and white continued to search for the lead goal and it arrived on 34 minutes, when a cross from Gary Mellett Connolly set-up Oisin Hanlon and the latter’s cool finish was destined for the back of the net.\nThe North Mayo men tried to get back into the tie before the break, but Sean Shaughnessy’s goal remained intact and the visitors held a slender 1-0 lead at the break.\nMick Duffy’s outfit dominated possession during the second period, but they could find no way past a Ballinrobe defence which was well marshalled by Aaron McDonnell and captain Oisin Connolly. The game was on a knife-edge; however, the visitors netted a crucial second on 65 minutes. A raking free-kick from Sean Shaughnessy bypassed the Ballina rearguard and was seized upon by the poaching Sean Vahey. Vahey controlled possession, before guiding home a terrific finish beyond the reach of the Ballina custodian.\nFor the remainder of the joust, Ballinrobe circled the wagons and defended heroically to record a memorable victory at Belleek Park.\nBallinrobe Town: Sean Shaughnessy, Sean Hughes, Jonathan Lawrence, Aaron McDonnell, Oisin Connolly, Peter Butler, Sean Vahey, Gary Mellett Connolly, Joseph Lydon, Oisin Hanlon, Connor Ryan. Subs used: Peter Finnerty, Stephen Morrison, Seamus Langan.\nReferee: Damien McGrath.\nBallinrobe Town AFC is delighted to partner with the FAI Mayo to launch the upcoming Cadbury Kick Fit Programme.

Ballinasloe began the tie in a robust fashion and the East Galway side mustered an early 10-0 lead. However, Ballinrobe regrouped and a try from Tom Staunton, coupled with Dylan Keane’s conversion, levelled matters at 10 points apiece. Ballinasloe responded in devastating fashion, and after the local’s notched a converted try, the pendulum has swung back in their favour.\nThe remainder of the half was keenly contested and the Robesiders trailed by an attainable seven points at the break, 20-13. Despite their best efforts, the South Mayo men couldn’t garner a five-pointer during the second half and they could only manufacture a penalty. Ballinasloe upped the tempo as the half progressed and two tries by the locals helped seal the all-important victory and promotion to the Connacht Rugby Junior One (A) League.\nBallinrobe: Kevin Staunton, Peter Finlay, Liam Dever, Liam Lynch, Jack O’Toole, Thomas Lynagh, Ronan Hughes, Sean Mullin, Killian McHugh, Dylan Keane, Paul Keane, Daniel Keane, Tom Staunton, Liam Burke, Steven Conroy.
