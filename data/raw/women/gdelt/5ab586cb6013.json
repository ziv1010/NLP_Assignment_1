  "body_text": "The Finland women’s national team won the Costa Cálida Pinatar Cup 2024 after beating Scotland in a penalty shootout on Tuesday. The final ended in a 1-1 draw with the luck that inevitably goes with success in a penalty shootout on the side of the Finnish team.\nOona Sevenius put the Finns ahead in the first half with a clever header against the run of play after Scotland switched off in midfield as players and management debated tactics.\nPedro Martinez Losa’s side dominated possession and were relentless in their press as they sought an equaliser – although their opponents had several opportunities to increase their lead.\nBut Scotland’s persistence was rewarded when Martha Thomas struck for the third time in two games, cushioning in from close range after Erin Cuthbert’s free-kick was parried.\nCuthbert then had the opportunity to clinch victory from the spot in the shootout after Sandy MacIver saved Heidi Kollanen’s effort, but the Chelsea midfielder’s effort was palmed away.\nRangers’ Nicola Docherty then had her penalty saved as Finland won 5-4 to deny the Scots the trophy.\nSlovenia beat the Philippines 1-0 to finish 3rd.\nIn the Pinatar Cup Youth Group, played at the same venue, the Czech Republic beat Portugal in the final, again on penalties after the match finished in a 1-1 draw while Morrocco got a deserved third place in the consolation final after defeating Sweden (2-1).\nWith the consolidation of the Costa Cálida Pinatar Cup as one of the most important women’s tournaments in the world, Pinatar Arena continues to position the Region of Murcia as one of the best international football destinations.",
