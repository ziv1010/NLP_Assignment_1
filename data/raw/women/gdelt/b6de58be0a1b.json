  "body_text": "Inter Miami Signs Messi: The Turning Point of Soccer in the US?\nIn a ground-breaking announcement, Inter Miami has secured the signing of Lionel Messi, widely regarded as the greatest soccer player the world has ever witnessed. What does this mean for the sport in the US? Major League Soccer (MLS)? Inter Miami?\nThe US Sporting and Soccer Landscape\nDespite the global popularity of soccer, and a dominant U.S. womens national soccer team for nearly a quarter-century, the United States has historically shown less interest in the sport compared to other countries. Brand Finances research found that American Football and the NFL is by far the most popular sport across the nation, with all but five states choosing it as their favorite sport. Soccer has varying levels of interest, however, ranging from a mere 3% to 32% of people claiming it is their favorite sport.\nThe US is one of only a handful of countries where sports are the most popular interest, demonstrating the huge scope for growth of soccer across the country.\nInter Miamis historically lower Brand Strength could get a boost\nBrand Finances in-depth MLS research reveals that Inter Miamis performance falls short when compared to its counterparts across various metrics. Notably, Sporting Kansas City emerges as the frontrunner, claiming the top position in numerous categories, including: my favorite player plays for the club, the team is well run & managed off the pitch, the team has a great stadium, sustainable and positive for the environment, good reputation, the best club in the world. Real Salt Lake and D.C. United also perform strongly in the research.\nBy contrast, Miami does not rank 1st or 2nd across any of the metrics asked. The area in which they score the highest comparatively is for the team is ambitious. Similar to when Pelé joined New York Cosmos igniting a fever of national excitement and record-breaking attendances, Messi could reshape the fortunes of the Florida-based team and grow both MLS and Inter Miamis global following.\nThe power of Messi\nAccording to a 2021 release by Brand Finance, Lionel Messis departure from FC Barcelona could have led to an 11% decrease in brand value, equivalent to a staggering 137m reduction from its 2021 valuation of 1,266m. However, the actual impact turned out to be less severe than anticipated. Despite that, Barcelona has experienced a significantly slower recovery in brand value compared to their arch-rivals Real Madrid, with the gap widening from 10m to a considerable 84m. Indeed, the power of a superstar cannot be underestimated.\nThe addition of Lionel Messi to Inter Miami presents a significant opportunity to enhance commercial revenue, with sponsorship and merchandise sales poised to benefit immensely from his presence. Moreover, Messis exceptional skills and iconic status are expected to elevate on-field performance, attracting a larger fan base and likely enticing even more of the Latin American audience, which is already primarily driven by national team players. This surge in popularity has the potential to boost broadcasting and matchday income, while also leading to improved match-day attendance across the country.\nConsidering Messis current age, his longevity becomes a crucial factor in assessing the overall impact on brand value. However, the prospect of him retiring at Inter Miami while maintaining a positive relationship could also open doors for mutually beneficial brand partnerships, extending beyond his playing days and benefiting both Messi and the club.\nHugo Hensley, Head of Sports Services at Brand Finance, commented:\nThe arrival of Lionel Messi to Inter Miami signifies a turning point in the sports landscape, unlocking immense potential for growth across the U.S. With his iconic status and exceptional skills, Messis addition presents a unique opportunity to elevate commercial revenue, attracting sponsors and driving merchandise sales. Moreover, his impact on the field is expected to broaden the fan base, boosting broadcasting and matchday income. With Messi joining the club, it aims to redefine its brand, forging valuable partnerships that extend beyond his playing days. The power of this superstar endorsement cannot be underestimated\"\nCelebrity endorsement and ownership model on the rise\nWe have seen big names try and build the sport from inside the nation. David Beckham - who is arguably more famous for his work off the pitch than on it launched Inter Miami in 2020. More recently, Academy Award winner Natalie Portman co-founded Angel City FC, a National Womens Soccer League expansion team.\nProminent Hollywood actor Ryan Reynolds and his business partner and fellow actor, Rob McElhenney, ventured into soccer club ownership by acquiring Waless Wrexham AFC in November 2020. This Hollywood story has generated significant media attention and the release of the Hulu and Disney+ docuseries on the club Welcome to Wrexham has garnered support and interest like never before. With Apple TV announcing a similar style documentary on Inter Miami, the club can leverage the star power of the player to captivate audiences and fuel the rapid growth of the sport across the country.\nRead the full Brand Finance Football 50 2023 report here\nMethodology\nBrand Finance has estimated the potential impact of Lionel Messis departure on FC Barcelonas brand value by examining the players role in driving revenue across key streams, such as commercial and matchday. The proportion of Messis value on the transfer market to the total value of the clubs players was used as a proxy for the proportion of the clubs revenues which can be attributed to Messis presence in the club.\nAbout Brand Finance\nBrand Finance is the worlds leading brand valuation consultancy.
