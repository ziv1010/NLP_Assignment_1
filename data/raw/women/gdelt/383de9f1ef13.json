We're just going to enjoy the city before the match later. My husband and son have tickets, we are relegated to the fan zone.\n'My niece Vivienne here is from Leverkusen and she is showing us around. She is German but supports Scotland. We're going to win 2-1, Callum McGregor to score.'\nPoliceman Scott Alison travelled from his home in Adelaide, Australia, to link up with his father John, 78, from Kilmarnock.\nAs the pair enjoyed a beer near the station in what was their first meeting in a year, 49-year-old Scott said: 'I've travelled from south Australia to watch Scotland and meet my father.'\n'It was 14 hours from Australia to Doha then another seven hours onto Frankfurt. It was a full day travelling yesterday then straight into the party today. I've not seen my dad for a year so it's quite special.
