  "body_text": "Smith's versatility and 'contagious' positivity driving Arsenal\n- Published\nWhen Arsenal made Olivia Smith the first £1m player player in the history of women's football, they did not think they were signing a striker.\nThe 21-year-old Canadian had earned a reputation as a busy right-sided winger, the kind that hugs the sideline and takes pleasure in turning full-backs inside out.\nThe fee raised eyebrows in some quarters - after all, Chloe Kelly had seemingly made the right flank spot her own during last season's triumphant Champions League campaign.\nWhat could Smith offer that she - or Beth Mead - could not? As simple as it seems, the answer may well be versatility.\nSmith played the unfamiliar role of number nine against runaway Women's Super League leaders Manchester City on Sunday, but looked right at home as she scored the only goal in a 1-0 win.\nWith three goals in her past four league games, Smith is one of the most in-form players in the WSL.\n\"I'll play wherever I need to be. I was running at the back line, stretching them, runs in behind and trying to get finishes on goal,\" Smith told Sky Sports.\nArsenal may only have thrown the smallest of spanners in City's title charge - they remain eight points clear of Manchester United with seven games remaining - but Smith's talent and versatility has helped to kick-start a drifting Gunners side back into life.\n'More to come' from 'intuitive' Smith\nArsenal exploited City's high defensive line - and lack of pace the back - by playing through passes either side of central defenders Rebecca Knaak and Jade Rose.\nSmith beat Knaak to a Mariona Caldentey pass before rounding Ayaka Yamashita and slotting into the empty net, but originally that job was not meant to be her's.\nStina Blackstenius picked up a calf issue during the week, forcing manager Renee Slegers to find an alternative solution.\n\"We have been successful with Stina [Blackstenius] in the nine, she is so good with her physicality and speed,\" said Slegers.\n\"She wasn't available, so we wanted similar qualities even though Olivia and Stina are very different players. Liv [Smith] had two-and-a-half training sessions in the nine position.\n\"[There was] a lot of meetings with coaches, giving her the details without putting too much information in her head so she could play on intuition, because that is when she is really good.\n\"She picked up the role brilliantly, the goal was exactly what we wanted.\"\nOf course, opponents rarely employ defensive lines against Arsenal as high as City did, but the Canada forward showed she can be relied upon.\n\"We have different options [for different opponents]. This was very specific for us today, Olivia hasn't done it for us before. But she performed really well, so of course we will see her as an option going forward.\"\nIt's easy to forget that Smith has been playing in the WSL for less than two years.\nAfter developing in Portugal with Sporting CP, one season at Liverpool was enough to convince Arsenal to spend big.\n\"There is more to come – she is still a young player, she is settling in the environment,\" said Slegers.\n\"It's been a while now, but don't underestimate what it takes for a player and her situation to settle and adjust to a new life.\n\"She's great to work with, her ability on the pitch is so good. She helps the team with her specific qualities, but she's also a pleasure to work with. She is making small steps but she is at a really high level.\"\nSmith let her team-mates down by getting sent off during the League Cup semi-final defeat by Manchester United last month, but she has bounced back in a serious way.\nWinter break 'really important' for Gunners\nArsenal may well be 10 points behind table-toppers City, but they look a different team to the one that struggled for consistency during the first half of the campaign.\n\"Players getting a rest mentally and physically has done us really well,\" said Slegers.\n\"There was a big tournament in the summer which put a high load on lots of players, so the [winter] break was really good.\n\"They have come back with so much new energy - that reset has been really important.\"\nSince the cup defeat by United, Arsenal have beaten Chelsea and City either side of winning the inaugural Fifa Champions Cup against Corinthians.\nAnd even if the WSL title looks out of reach - they have eight to play and a game in hand on City - more silverware may not be beyond them.\nThe European champions are favourites to progress through the next round of both the FA Cup and Champions League.\n\"The players' investment is so high at the moment, how we work together and [stay] humble in every moment - it's really good,\" said Slegers.\n\"Now it's about working hard on developing and pushing as hard as we can for the rest of the season.\n\"This positivity is contagious so we want to keep it going.\"\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.
