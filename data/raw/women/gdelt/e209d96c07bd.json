Thank you for tuning in.\nEoghan Moloney\nIrish ‘Red Nuns’ gather for funeral of Pope Francis\nIn a quiet recess carved out of the otherwise bustling northside of Dublin City, a group of “Red Nuns” gathered to solemnly watch the funeral of Pope Francis. The late pontiff’s funeral was broadcast around the world and into homes and places of worship across Ireland on Saturday – including Saint Alphonsus’ Monastery in Drumcondra. There, the Redemptoristine Nuns – known as ‘Red Nuns’ due to the colour of their habits – gathered in a small, understated room of the monastery to watch a livestream of the funeral mass and procession.\nThirteen of the order’s 16 nuns were present, gathered on chairs around a projector and a small set of speakers.A contemplative order, the nuns say their life is “enclosed” which means they remain within the grounds of monastery – while holding the outer world in their hearts through prayer.\nSpeaking to the PA news agency, Sister Gabrielle said Pope Francis “brought alive the Gospel”.\n“We have great admiration for him because he brought alive the gospel in so many ways, the simplicity of the gospel, the authenticity of the gospel – for the poor and the marginalised.\n“And we are all sinners, we’re on the journey together and that great vision of oneness has touched me profoundly anyway.”\nShe added: “He certainly has challenged the entire world and – we saw there today so many leaders – that he’s tried to bring peace and respect for each person and the dignity of each person to be respected and upheld.”\nShe said the inclusion of poor and marginalised people in the proceedings illustrates his key message: “To embrace us all in the one embrace of love of God.”\nSpeaking about the Redemptoriste Nuns, Sr Gabrielle said the order was made up of various nationalities. She said: “We’re situated here in Drumcondra and we’re actually celebrating 25 years in this present monastery and we had been in the previous monastery since 1859, when we came to Ireland from Bruge.\n“We’re celebrating 300 years of revelation of our order so it’s a very momentous time at this particular time here in our community.”\nThe sisters of the Red Nuns come from around Ireland, England, Scotland, Europe, Germany, the US and Asia. Sr Gabrielle said: “We’re 16 sisters in community from various nationalities which is a wonderful privilege really to have the richness of all the nations gathered here in this very small space, living in harmony and respecting each other as Pope Francis has called us to do so many times in his outreach to the world.”\nCillian Sherlock, PA\nMaeve McTaggart\nThe funeral of Pope Francis, which was followed by his private burial in St Peter's Basilica, has come to a close.\nTens of thousands of people gathered in Rome and further afield to pay their respects to the leader of the Catholic Church before attention soon turns to his successor.\nIt was said during his funeral mass that his legacy will be his unwavering support for the vulnerable and marginalised, including migrants and refugees, as well as how he \"incessantly raised his voice\" in the face of \"inhumane\" wars.\nMaeve McTaggart\nTens of thousands of people gathered in Rome and further afield to pay their respects to the leader of the Catholic Church before attention soon turns to his successor.\nIt was said during his funeral mass that his legacy will be his unwavering support for the vulnerable and marginalised, including migrants and refugees, as well as how he \"incessantly raised his voice\" in the face of \"inhumane\" wars.\nMaeve McTaggart\nMaeve McTaggart\nMeeting with Trump in St Peter's Basilica has 'potential to become historic' - Zelensky\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said his meeting with US President Donald Trump in St Peter's Basilica, held while they both attended the funeral of Pope Francis, has the \"potential to become historic\".\n\"Good meeting. We discussed a lot one-on-one. Hoping for results on everything we covered,\" said Mr Zelensky on X.\n\"Protecting lives of our people. Full and unconditional ceasefire. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out. Very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results. Thank you @POTUS.\"\nMaeve McTaggart\nMaeve McTaggart\nAttention will now turn to conclave and Pope Francis's successor\nAttention will soon turn to who will succeed Pope Francis, a process that will be overseen by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who was born in Drimnagh, Co Dublin.\nHe is the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, the prelate who keeps the Catholic Church running between the death of the Pope and election of his successor. Some have termed him an “interim pope\".\nThe conclave to elect the next pope is unlikely to begin before May 6, and might not start for several days after that, giving cardinals time to hold regular meetings beforehand to sum each other up and assess the state of the Church, beset by financial problems and ideological divisions.\nHe is the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, the prelate who keeps the Catholic Church running between the death of the Pope and election of his successor.

People have gathered here in Rome to reflect on a Papacy defined by compassion, humility, and an unwavering commitment to the most vulnerable among us. He inspired millions, beyond the Catholic Church, with his humility and love for the less fortunate.\n\"The scale of the global response to his passing and the unprecedented attendance at his funeral speak to the profound impact Pope Francis had during his time as the leader of the Catholic Church. He was a moral voice on the world stage, advocating tirelessly for peace, for climate justice, for the poor and the displaced.\n\"In Ireland, he will forever hold a special place in our hearts for his historic visit in 2018. That visit was a moment of reflection and dialogue, of healing and hope, and it resonated deeply with people of all faiths and none.\n\"Pope Francis challenged us all to be better—to care more, to judge less, to lead with kindness. His legacy will continue to inspire generations to come.\n\"Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.\"\nMaeve McTaggart\nDuring the funeral mass, Cardinal Battista Re emphasised Pope Francis's outreach to migrants and refugees, exemplified by visits he made to Lampedusa, Lesbos, and the US-Mexico border.\n“His gestures and exhortations in favour of refugees and displaced persons are countless. His insistence on working on behalf of the poor was constant.”\nMaeve McTaggart\nMaeve McTaggart\nA hearse transfers the coffin of Pope Francis to the Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major (Santa Maria Maggiore) on the day of his funeral, in Rome.

No one was excluded. “Even if the life of a person has been a disaster, God is in this person’s life. You must try to seek God in every human life,” he pleaded.\n\"All those who mourn him today will hope that the vital pulse of compassion that Francis strove to stir can be sustained.\"\nRead today's editorial from the Irish Independent:\nRead today's editorial from the Irish Independent:\nMaeve McTaggart\nPeople gather across Buenos Aires as funeral of Pope Francis takes place\nIt is just after 6.30am in Buenos Aires, but still thousands have gathered in the darkness of the early morning to watch the funeral of Pope Francis, who was born in Argentina.\nThere is a perhaps unexpected Irish link to Pope Francis and his childhood in Buenos Aires, as the missionary nun who cared for him in his earliest days was from Co Cavan.\nThe Bergoglio family, who lived in Buenos Aires, called on the religious order the Little Sisters of the Assumption for help when they were expecting their first child in December 1936.\nThere is a perhaps unexpected Irish link to Pope Francis and his childhood in Buenos Aires, as the missionary nun who cared for him in his earliest days was from Co Cavan.\nThe Bergoglio family, who lived in Buenos Aires, called on the religious order the Little Sisters of the Assumption for help when they were expecting their first child in December 1936.\nSr Olivia Maria, a long way from her own home near Kilnaleck in Co Cavan, arrived to care for the mother and her newborn, who would grow up to become the head of the Catholic Church more than seven decades later.\nMaeve McTaggart\nA person holds a candle outside the Metropolitan Cathedral of Buenos Aires, following the death of Pope Francis, in Buenos Aires, Argentina April 26, 2025.
