  "body_text": "Women’s Champions League football returns to Meadow Park, where we host Real Madrid at 8pm on Wednesday.\nAfter going three games without a win in all competitions, we’re pushing for three points to lift us up from 11th in the table.\nWe will need to finish in the top 12 of the 18 teams to qualify for the knockout phase play-offs, while the top four go through to the quarter-finals automatically.\nLOOKING TO BOUNCE BACK\nReal Madrid are currently fifth in the competition with seven points from three matches, having beaten Roma 6-2 and PSG 2-1 before drawing 1-1 against Paris FC, thanks to former Gunner Caroline Weir’s 98th-minute equaliser last week.\nIn the Primera Division, Real Madrid are fourth with 23 points from 11 matches, one point behind Real Sociedad and Atletico Madrid and seven shy of Barcelona.\nTheir run of five league wins in a row recently came to an end in the Women’s Clasico, with Barcelona winning that match 4-0 on Saturday.\nWHAT THE MANAGERS SAY\nSlegers: “I think their games might be a little bit more open this year, so that's something that we have to prepare for and something we want to organise in a good way.\n“You see that their key players play in a little bit different roles this year compared to last year, so that's also something to look out for. Otherwise, you see a lot of similar structures and similar players on the pitch compared to last year.” - every word of Renée’s pre-Real Madrid press conference.\nPau Quesada: “We're coming to the home of the European champions, but we're coming without any fear. We want to be ourselves, set the pace of the game, and bring the intensity we're used to. They're tough opposition and we'll have to neutralise their strengths with the weapons we have. We're not worrying about where we're playing.\n\"They're a hugely dynamic team. Against Lyon and Bayern, they put in two good performances, the results don't reflect those games. They do a lot with the ball, press very high, and they're a complete unit. They're putting on some great displays - perhaps they're just lacking that clinical edge to improve their results. They're a great side and I'm sure they'll achieve their goals.\"\nTEAM NEWS\nRenée confirmed in her pre-match press conference that there were no fresh injury concerns from Sunday's north London derby draw.\nLeah Williamson continues her road to recovery, expected to return in December, while Kim Little is looking likely to be sidelined until after the international break.\nFACTS AND STATS\nOur only previous meeting with Real Madrid in the Champions League came in last season’s quarter-finals, with us losing 2-0 away in the first leg before winning 3-0 at Emirates Stadium in the second leg.\nReal Madrid have lost on all four of their previous visits to England in the Champions League, conceding at least twice in each defeat (L3 vs Chelsea, L1 vs Arsenal).\nFormer Gunner Caroline Weir is Real Madrid’s all-time top goalscorer in the Champions League, though all eight of her strikes have come at home. Against Paris FC on MD3, the Scot scored the latest equalising goal on record in the competition (97:33 – since 2021/22, excl. extra-time).\nMATCH OFFICIALS\nItalian referee Silvia Gasperotti has been appointed to take charge of Wednesday’s match. She officiated at her first UEFA Women’s EURO in 2025.\nVAR will be in use for this fixture.\nReferee: Silvia Gasperotti\nAssistant referees: Giulia Tempestilli and Stefania Signorelli\nFourth official: Maria Marotta\nVAR: Gianluca Aureliano\nAssistant VAR: Rosario Abisso\nLAST TIME WE MET\nIn a season full of memorable comebacks, this one perhaps took the crown as we overturned a 2-0 deficit to win the quarter-finals 3-2 on aggregate.\nWe were still trailing by two at half-time, but rapidly fired in three goals in the first 14 minutes of the second half - two for Alessia Russo and one for Mariona Caldentey.\nEnjoy the night all over again by pressing play on the highlights video above!\nHOW TO WATCH\nThis match will be shown live on Disney+ in the UK.
