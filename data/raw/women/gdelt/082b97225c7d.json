Look, it’s not easy. It is one of the best things I have accomplished in my career,” Dembele said on stage.\n“Winning this trophy from Ronaldinho [who presented it], a legend of football, is amazing.\n“To all the team and the club, it’s really an incredible family. You have been amazing since the first day. The president, since the first contact, he has been exceptional with me.\n“I want to also thank all the staff at PSG, my coach Luis Enrique has been amazing with me and has been the most important of my career.\n“My team-mates have been amazing in 2024 and 2025, they have been with me in the bad moments. It is not an individual trophy, it is for us all to win this.”\nDembele was the creative and attacking fulcrum of his side’s spectacular season, scoring 35 goals and providing 14 assists in his 53 appearances across all competitions.\nThe 28-year-old former Borussia Dortmund and Barcelona winger finished as Ligue 1 joint-top scorer alongside Mason Greenwood of Marseille with 21 goals, earning a place in the team of the season and winning the league’s player of the year award.\nBut he earned wider acclaim for his form in Europe, where he scored eight goals, including a hat-trick against Stuttgart and crucial strikes against Liverpool and Arsenal in the last 16 and semi-finals respectively.\nDembele’s intense pressing in the Champions League final was a memorable hallmark of a remarkable 5-0 victory over Italian side Internazionale, and the forward set up two of his side’s goals in that Munich master class.\nRead Also: Bonmatí is Women’s best player for third consecutive year\nThose performances saw him win the Champions League player of the season award, while he was also named in the team of the season alongside six of his PSG team-mates.\nEnrique backed his star man for the Ballon d’Or in the summer after another standout performance during the Club World Cup.\n“To win it, you have to score goals and get assists, and they have to bring silverware to their teams,” Enrique said.\n“That is Ousmane Dembele, and he is far and away above other players in my opinion.”\nHe added: “I think he has been our best player this season. He deserves to win everything because he gives his all to the club and has done all season.”\nBarcelona superstar Yamal was widely touted to be Dembele’s closest rival for the award and so it transpired, with the Spain international coming second.\nDembele’s PSG team-mate Vitinha finished third, while Mohamed Salah of Liverpool and Barcelona’s Raphinha completed the top five.\nDembele succeeds Manchester City midfielder Rodri in claiming the sport’s most illustrious individual award, after the Spaniard’s success in 2024.\nHe becomes the sixth French winner of the award, making France the country with the record number of different players to claim it, ahead of Germany and Italy on five.\nFrance has also now equalled Argentina as the country with the most overall wins on eight, although Lionel Messi won all eight of those for the South American country.\nMessi and Cristiano Ronaldo shared 13 of the 15 Ballon d’Or awards between 2008 and 2023, their dominance only broken by Luka Modric in 2018 and Karim Benzema in 2022. The Ballon d’Or was not awarded in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nEarlier at the ceremony in the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris, Yamal reclaimed the Kopa Trophy, while Vicky Lopez won the inaugural women’s edition of the prize for best young player.\nParis Saint-Germain were named men’s club of the year and Arsenal were the women’s club of the year, while Luis Enrique and Sarina Wiegman won the Johan Cruyff Trophies for best coaches.\nThe Yashin Trophy for best men’s goalkeeper went to Gianluigi Donnarumma, while England’s Hannah Hampton scooped the inaugural women’s edition.\nThe Women’s Ballon d’Or was claimed by Aitana Bonmati of Barcelona for a record third consecutive year.\nALL THE AWARD WINNERS\nThe Men’s Ballon d’Or: Ousmane Dembele (PSG)\nThe Women’s Ballon d’Or: Aitana Bonmati(Barcelona )\nThe Men’s Kopa Trophy: Lamine Yamal (Barcelona)\nThe Women’s Kopa Trophy : Vicky Lopez(Barcelona)\nThe Men’s Yashin Trophy: Gianluigi Donnarumma (PSG)\nThe Women’s Yashin Trophy : Hannah Hampton (Chelsea)\nThe Men’s Gerd Muller Trophy: Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting CP)\nThe Women’s Gerd Muller Trophy: Ewa Pajor (Barcelona)\nThe Men’s Johan Cruyff Trophy : Luis Enrique (PSG)\nThe Women’s Johan Cruyff Trophy: Sarina Wiegman (England)\nThe Men’s Club of the Year Trophy: Paris Saint Germain\nThe Women’s Club of the Year Trophy: Arsenal\nSocrates Award: The Xana Foundation",
