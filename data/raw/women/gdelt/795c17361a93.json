  "body_text": "England's Hannah Hampton says late grandpa was so 'proud' as she pays touching tribute\nHannah Hampton saved two penalties in the final against Spain to help the Lionesses to a second successive European Championship, with Chloe Kelly scoring the winning spot-kick\nEngland's heroic goalkeeper Hannah Hampton has spoken about the squad's UEFA Women's Euros 2025 triumph and paid a touching tribute to her late grandpa.\nHannah's crucial double save during England's penalty shootout against Spain in last Sunday's (July 27) final crowned a superb tournament for the Chelsea shot-stopper, who paved the way for Chloe Kelly to slot home the decisive penalty and secure the Lionesses' title defence.\nThe 24-year-old earned player of the match honours following the final, and on Monday (July 28), she revealed her devastation that her grandfather hadn't lived to witness her achieve their mutual aspiration of representing England at a major championship, reports the Manchester Evening News.\nSharing on her Instagram beside an image of her green England jersey bearing \"grandpa\" in the collar, she penned: \"Dear Grandpa.\n\"Two days before the biggest tournament of my life, you left. It still doesn't feel real. I kept thinking when I'd call nannie I'd hear your voice again – one of your jokes, or one of those little comments you'd make that somehow said everything without saying much at all.\"\n\"You were one of my biggest supporters. You believed in me before I even knew what this journey would look like. You were always there: watching, encouraging, teaching. You taught me so much, not just about football, but about life. About staying grounded, working hard, being resilient and doing things the right way.\n\"I miss our chats. I miss you saying, 'only us athletes understand' - always with a little smirk like you were in on something special. And you were. You got it. You understood what this meant to me. You understood what it took.\"\nHannah has now given her first live TV interview since the Lionesses' triumphant Euros campaign. She shared with viewers the emotions of saving those crucial penalties in the final and spoke candidly about the personal struggles she overcame to reach that pinnacle.\nOn Good Morning Britain, Hannah reflected on the tournament's intense penalty shootouts: \"Sometimes I say I don't like it and sometimes I say I love it. I think the two penalty shootouts we had, I probably didn't like it. We made it hard for ourselves, let's be honest.\"\nShe recounted the pressure of the situation, saying: \"I thought I've got to do my bit for the team and save a couple, but the first one against Sweden, it kept going on and on and on - we probably gave half the nation a heart attack.\"\nSpeaking to presenters Kate and Ed, Hannah also mentioned the emotional support from her grandfather, noting: \"I remember speaking to him so many times about what we wanted to achieve as a group, and how proud he was.\n\"All of the time he wanted to come to my football games or watch it on the TV. He would be on the phone straight after. It was hard at the beginning. The girls helped me so much to get through it, and it was hard after games when you wanted to call home and wouldn't hear his voice.\n\"My whole point was to not put it out for sympathy. People don't realise what goes on in people's lives, so I don't want people to keep giving all the hate comments and the abuse.\n\"You don't know if people are already at a low point, and having that extra bit of fuel isn't going to help them. People are entitled to their opinions, don't get me wrong, but there's a way that you can go about them in a nicer way.\"\nWrapping up the interview, when Ed asked 'What is next?' Hannah responded: \"We need to bring football home well and truly, and that World Cup in Brazil will be incredible. I have faith that we can bring it home and I'm sure the whole nation does after the weekend. We will be going out to give it our best, that's for sure!\".",
