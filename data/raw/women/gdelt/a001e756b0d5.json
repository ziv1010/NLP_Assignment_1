  "body_text": "‘We’re delighted to be providing a free-to-air option for fans who want to see every goal and moment that matters…’\nBBC Sport will continue to air free-to-access highlights from every Champions League match after securing a four-season extension to its existing agreement with UEFA, keeping the rights in place until the end of the 2030/31 campaign.\nThe deal, which builds on the broadcaster’s current contract running to 2027, guarantees six further years of digital clips and televised highlights, ensuring that every goal from Europe’s premier club competition remains available on Beeb platforms.\nUnder the renewed arrangement, BBC Sport will continue to show clips from all Tuesday and Wednesday fixtures across its website, app, iPlayer and social media channels from 10pm each Wednesday. A Match of the Day highlights programme will also remain a midweek fixture on BBC One, airing after the late evening news and available subsequently on iPlayer.\nBBC Sport said the agreement complements its existing football portfolio, which includes Premier League highlights, live FA Cup coverage, the Women’s Super League and the Women’s Champions League. The broadcaster also holds rights for major international tournaments including the men’s and women’s FIFA World Cups, UEFA Euro 2028 and Olympic Games coverage.\nAlex Kay-Jelski, the BBC’s director of sport, welcomed the extension, describing the Champions League as “the pinnacle of European club football”.\nHe added: “We’re delighted to be providing a free-to-air option for fans who want to see every goal and moment that matters. This deal continues our game-changing football portfolio and ensures audiences can enjoy the very best coverage across BBC TV, iPlayer, Sounds, radio and digital platforms.”\nThe move ensures that, even as live Champions League broadcasting shifts increasingly towards subscription platforms, highlights will remain available without a paywall for UK audiences.",
