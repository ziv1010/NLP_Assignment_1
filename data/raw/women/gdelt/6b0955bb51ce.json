We improved tactics last year, with Tactical Vision, but with FC IQ coming in, it felt like a natural fit [to] rework player roles, even fit coaches into it.\n\"With Rush coming in, we always knew a bit of a community ask has been to be able to play with the youth players, and when we saw Rush we started thinking about how, for example, in Germany five-versus-five is such a big topic - we were like, this is the perfect opportunity to make youth players actually playable.\n\"So it just felt like everything was falling in the right place.\"\nOne of the most important elements of Career Mode is, of course, the transfer window.\nAnd, after his escapades at Euro 2024 and the fact that he has boundless potential, you'd expect Lamine Yamal to top many managers' transfer wish lists this time out.\nThe 17-year-old didn’t arrive in FC 24 until the Euros update, so can we expect him to feature from the start this season?\n\"Yeah, he will be in the game,\" Wilsdorf confirms. \"I think he will be a transfer target for many people.\"\nWant to see this content?\nWe're not able to show you this content from YouTube.

This year, with us redoing the whole menu, bringing social media into the game, it felt like now was the moment to really try and work together.\n\"With other media partners we’re starting to bring in, it felt like now’s the moment to really focus on them, and Fabrizio Romano was excited about it, he loves the game, so it was just the perfect fit.\"\nImagine the satisfaction you'd feel after taking Accrington Stanley to the Premier League and having the transfer guru announce your signing of Kylian Mbappé. Well, now you won’t have to imagine - it’s in the game.\nWant to see this content?\nWe're not able to show you this content from Riddle.
