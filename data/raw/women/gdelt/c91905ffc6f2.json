  "body_text": "So far, England’s head coach Sarina Wiegman has overseen the Lionesses winning 48 games out of a possible 67, and it’s thought those numbers are only going to rise.\nEspecially as Wiegman, who took on the role four years ago, is currently leading the England women’s team in the UEFA EURO 2025 tournament.\nEngland have made it out of the group stages and their next match will be this evening in the quarter-finals, as Ella Toone, Georgia Stanway, and teammates take on Sweden tonight (July 17).\nBut what else do we know about England’s manager? Let’s find out.\nWho is England's Lionesses manager?\nOf course, Wiegman will be “forever remembered” in English football history, after becoming the first coach to lead the Lionesses to a major title when England won UEFA EURO 2022 on home soil, England Football explains.\nIt adds: “Not only was it historic for the Lionesses, but also for Wiegman as she became the first coach to win back-to-back tournaments having led her native Netherlands to the EURO 2017 title five years earlier.\n“Widely regarded as one of the best international coaches in the women's game, Sarina began her role as England head coach in September 2021.\n“That was over a year after her appointment had been confirmed in July 2020, with her commitments as Netherlands coach for the delayed Tokyo 2020 Olympics keeping her in her homeland until the start of England's 2023 World Cup qualifying campaign.”\nA big win to secure progression from Group D! 🔒🙌 pic.twitter.com/HdBcoK9nVl\n— Lionesses (@Lionesses) July 13, 2025\nThe 55-year-old was also named Best FIFA Women’s Coach in 2017, before taking the Netherlands to the final of the FIFA Women’s World Cup in 2019.\nDid Sarina Wiegman play football?\nWiegman, a Dutch footballer, gained 104 caps for her country, becoming the first female player to reach a century of appearances, and she captained the national side during an “impressive” career.\nOnce she moved into coaching, she remained a “trailblazer” in her homeland and became one of the biggest names in the women’s game.\nEngland Football continues: “After starting out coaching with girls’ grassroots teams in her local region of the Hague once her career on the pitch came to an end, her club coaching career began with a season-long spell with her former club Ter Leede.\n“She duly led them to the title and KNVB Cup in 2007, before her first move into full-time coaching came in 2007 when she took over at ADO Den Haag in the newly formed Women’s Eredivisie.”\nIn 2016, Wiegman was the first woman to coach a men’s professional club in her homeland, following a season-long spell as an assistant with Sparta Rotterdam.\nEngland Football reveals: “Wiegman quickly caught the eye too, by building a team and culture which would lead to them winning a league and cup double in 2012 before retaining the Cup in the following season.\n“This didn’t go un-noticed by the KNVB, and she was snapped up to be the assistant coach with the national team in 2014, working under Roger Reijners and then Arjan Van der Laan.\n“In 2015, the Dutch reached the quarter final of the Women’s World Cup in Canada and Wiegman was starting to see the potential within their ranks.”\n@england NEXT STOP: #WEURO2025 QUARTER-FINALS 💪 #england #lionesses ♬ original sound - England\nFollowing two spells as caretaker coach following the departures of Reijners and Van der Laan, Wiegman was granted the head coach role on a permanent basis in January 2017.\nLittle did she know this would see her profile propelled across the globe.\nJust some of the sporting awards Wiegman has been associated with include:\n- Best FIFA Women's Coach (four times)\n- UEFA Women's Coach of the Year (two times)\n- BBC Sports Personality of the Year Coach Award (2024)\n- Awarded an honorary degree from Loughborough University\nHow much does the Lionesses manager get paid?\nIn 2024, Weigman extended her contract as England head coach beyond the 2027 World Cup finals, in a deal that would see her become “one of the best-paid women’s football managers in the world,” according to The Times.\nIn January last year, it was reported that Emma Hayes, the Chelsea manager, earns around $1.6 million (about £1.3 million) a year, ahead of her taking the United States Women’s job last summer.\nWiegman’s latest salary was thought to be “comparable” with that and features “performance-related incentives”.\nGiven the FA does not disclose official figures, The Times said Wiegman’s previous contract allegedly earned her more than £400,000 a year “plus performance bonuses”.\nRecommended reading:\n-\nBritish pair win Men's Doubles at Wimbledon for first time since 1936\n-\nWarm and witty' football icon set to join BBC's Match of the Day as new pundit\nMark Bullingham, the FA chief executive, said in January 2024: “You won’t be surprised to hear that I won’t give you an amount, actually for anyone other than those we have to report.\n“What I would say is we see Sarina as the No 1 coach in the world in the women’s game and we think that she’s paid accordingly.\n“I don’t know what other people in other federations are paid, but I can say I think she’s paid accordingly.”",
