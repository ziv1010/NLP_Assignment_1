The clash against Spain will be a momentous occasion, with the possibility of England winning the Women's World Cup for the first time.\nSarina Wiegman's England side have been sitting just one game away from glory after beating tournament co-hosts Australia 3-1 on Wednesday. Millions of households across the country are expected to watch the final at 11am on Sunday with hopes they will witness an England senior team win a World Cup for the first time since 1966.\nAfter the Lionesses brought glory to England with their Euros win last year, there have been calls from across the political, sports and public spheres for them to be honoured with an extra bank holiday if they win Sunday's match. The Mirror have rounded up those who are in support of a nationwide day of celebrations if the team brings football home.\nKeir Starmer has mounted the pressure on Rishi Sunak\nLabour leader Keir Starmer joined calls for an extra bank holiday if the Lionesses win the World Cup on Sunday. Mr Starmer, who is a huge football fan and Arsenal supporter, believes a Lionesses victory should result in an extra bank holiday. \"It's almost 60 years since England won the World Cup,\" he wrote on social media. \"I'm never complacent about anything… but there should be a celebratory bank holiday if the Lionesses bring it home.\"\nThe party has set up a campaign, which members of the public can sign online. It urges people to put down their name in support of their message: \"It’s been almost 60 years since England won the World Cup. To commemorate what would be a historic moment for the country, we’re calling on the government to declare a celebratory bank holiday if the Lionesses bring it home.\"\nThe Lib Dems have also backed calls for a public holiday. Its leader Sir Ed Davey said: “The Lionesses have made history by reaching the final – they are an inspiration to athletes across the country already. Winning the World Cup would be a phenomenal achievement. It absolutely deserves to be celebrated with a bank holiday.”\nUnions have come out in support of a public holiday\nThe Trades Union Congress, a federation of trade unions in England and Wales, yesterday called on the government “to do the right thing” and grant a special bank holiday if England’s women win the football World Cup.\nThe TUC highlighted how workers in England and Wales get just eight bank holidays a year, fewer than any EU country. Fellow World Cup finalists Spain get the European average of 12 public holidays. Meanwhile workers in France get three additional public holidays a year, while workers in Sweden get 13 days – equivalent to an extra week off. Slovakia, Slovenia and Finland top the table with 15 days each, enjoying nearly twice as many public holidays as their British counterparts.\nTUC General Secretary Paul Nowak said: “We all hope our amazing Lionesses can get over the line on Sunday. And if they do bring it home the government should do the right thing and allow the country to celebrate with a special bank holiday. It would be mean-spirited not to do so.” On the need for more bank holidays, he added: “UK workers get far fewer bank holidays than their Spanish counterparts and most other workers in Europe. That is not right. The TUC has long called for more public holidays and it’s time to make this happen. Come on England!”\nThe England coach thinks her team should be celebrated\nEngland boss Sarina Wiegman has backed a public holiday for millions of fans back home if her side wins the World Cup. Asked before the semi-final game if Rishi Sunak should call a public holiday if England win the tournament, Dutch-born Sarina said: \"I would say yes, I can see all the English people here want it! But let's do everything to win the game tomorrow.\"\nThe Australian Government had also been under pressure to call a public holiday if the Matildas triumphed on home soil. However, England knocked out the team when they went head to head on Wednesday.\nThe public are also keen to celebrate the women's team\nAhead of the final on Sunday, a petition has been set up on Parliament's website, which reads: \"If England Women's football team win the World Cup, make Monday Bank Holiday. I'd like the Government to declare a bank holiday for all workers in the United Kingdom.\"\nIt currently has almost 800 signatures and needs 10,000 to get a response from ministers. However the Government previously decided not to celebrate the Lionesses Euro 2022 victory with a bank holiday, despite a petition garnering over 360,000 signatures.\nPolling by YouGov suggests views are split on whether to have a bank holiday if the Lionesses win, with 48% against and 41% in favour. When it comes to young people aged 18-24, 66% think there should be one while just 19% are against it. Meanwhile 73% of those over the age of 65 are against it and only 6% are for the public holiday.\nWhat has the government said?\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak had a message for the side immediately after the success against Australia. Taking to Twitter, he wrote: \"What a performance @Lionesses. Just one more game to go... Bring on Sunday.\"\nHowever, the Government have rained on supporters' parade by announcing that an extra Bank Holiday will not be added to the current calendar. A spokesperson said: \"We congratulate the Lionesses on their fantastic achievement in getting to the Women's World Cup final. The current pattern of public and bank holidays is well established and there are no plans to change this.\"\nThey added: \"Winning the World Cup would be a massive moment for the country and make no mistake we’ll find the right way to celebrate. As Sarina Wiegman herself has said, the first thing to do is focus on the final and the whole country will be rooting for the Lionesses this weekend.”\n* Follow Mirror Politics on Snapchat , Tiktok , Twitter and Facebook .",
