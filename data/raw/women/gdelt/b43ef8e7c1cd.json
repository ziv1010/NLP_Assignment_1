  "body_text": "Witnessing over 500 supporters in red and white celebrating our 4-1 win over Lyon as we reached the final of the UEFA Women’s Champions League, Renee Slegers was reminded of exactly what it means to be a part of The Arsenal.\nWith the party still going long into the night in Lyon, Renee was left with a feeling of pride and relief that we held on to complete an unforgettable comeback.\n“Of course, when they scored the 4-1, Lyon, there was a couple of minutes left to play. The scenario goes through your head,” she explained.\n“What if they score another goal? What if we let it slip so we have to do everything right? I'm so proud of how we defended that lead. And then when they blow the whistle and I look around and I look up into the stand, they're on the opposite side and I see them and I see the players running onto the pitch. I see everything happening. Staff, all Arsenal people. This is the moment and this is what we do it for. It's such a special moment.\n“I’m very happy and, of course, very proud because I think what the club have been doing for so long, investing in women's football and I think what we get to do now is something that's been worked on for a long, long time. But, of course, what we're doing in the moment, what the players are doing at the moment, it's unbelievable.\n“I’m so proud of the team and their investments and the work ethic and how they stayed calm because I think that was the biggest key for us today, to stay calm in all the scenarios that would happen. I think we get challenged in a lot of different scenarios today, but the players stayed calm and that was key today. So, I'm very, very proud.”\nThe subject of comeback ability is one we’ve put to Renee regularly throughout this season, as no task seems insurmountable for her players. Asked what makes her players so good at responding to setbacks, she said: “I think because they're very good at being in the moment. They're focused on the task.\n“They believe in what we're doing and they believe in each other. They believe in themselves. They are willing to put the work in and I think that's what creates belief as well because we see ourselves working really hard every day. Of course, we've proven it before that we're able to score goals in short periods of time and come back from setbacks. So, belief is an inner conviction that you don't need proof for, but I think we had the evidence going into this game and that's what made the confidence so big and the belief so high.”\nIt wasn’t just about the coming back, it was also having to then hold onto a lead away to Lyon that made the result all the more impressive.\n“Yeah, so we scored an early goal, which was good for us,” Renee said. “It also gave Lyon 84 minutes to change their game plan and get back into the game. So, that changed the scenario for us as well and that's why I'm even more proud of the team. How they've dealt with all these things and it went back and forth. They had momentum, we had momentum, but we were so steady and calm through all the phases.”\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
