  "body_text": "ICA annual walk ‘went very well’\n“The annual walk went very well,” reported Tess Brady of The Cavan Federation of the Irish Country Women’s Association’s sponsored walk.\nAround 40 people gathered in Cavan Town to take part in the event, an increase on previous years, including people who were not members of the federation.\nThe walk raised funds for Cavan Monaghan Palliative Care. With almost €62,000 raised for the cause since 2008, the women plan to present a cheque to Jimmy O’Donnell, chairperson of Cavan Monaghan Palliative Care, later this year. Donations are still coming in. “We got loads of sponsorship and donations.”\nMost guilds take a break from June to September. A member of the Mountnugent ICA for 30 years, Tess encourages those interested to check out their local branch.\n“It was the only outlet that time years ago for women, most of us at that stage were looking after our homes, our children.”\n“In today’s world it’s a different ball game because women, they’re up to their eyes bringing children to football and drama and everything. People have a different way of life now.”\n“Evenings are full and then they have to get ready for tomorrow for work,” she pointed out.\nTess believes the ICA provides “friendship” and allows you to “get to know people in the area”; while also giving women a break.\n“To sit down and have a cup of tea uninterrupted, that was a miracle,” she told the Celt.\n“Many’s a woman said it to me, isn’t it great to get a cup of tea.” Those interested in joining, search here to find their local guild.",
