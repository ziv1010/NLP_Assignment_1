Overall, the club have made over $20million (£15.5m) from the tour.\nQueues to buy even more official gear snaked hundreds of metres and events like the photo booth takeover, as well as collaborations with some of the biggest stars in the region — like Erling Haaland meeting K-Pop band Blackpink — will have strengthened the depth of feeling towards the club that has been building steadily over the years.\nAlmost 4,000 fans watched the team train ahead of both games in Tokyo, which felt like a lot until 23,000 turned up at the World Cup stadium in Seoul on Saturday. The training session was streamed live by Coupang Play, a subscription service with six million subscribers, and the training match at the end even had commentators.\nThe 61,618 attendance for the Yokohama F Marinos match was a record for any J-League hosted friendly — which is not bad considering Manchester United and Arsenal have been there before — and that was smashed with an attendance of 65,049 against Bayern, the highest in Tokyo’s National Stadium for a football match. In Seoul, 64,185 people came to watch and were delighted to see top-level European clubs: even those in City shirts seemed to celebrate Atletico’s goals.\nAdvertisement\nIt was Pep Guardiola, though, who highlighted the trip might not have been as beneficial to their on-pitch success as it has been off it. The heat has meant training sessions have been scaled back, and the players have been struggling to sleep past 5am.\nGuardiola found a way to rather artfully raise his concerns after the second game in Tokyo, a slow-paced 2-1 victory over Bayern Munich, stating that he would have complained more about it earlier in life, and then raising his concerns anyway.\n“Listen, when I was younger I was grumpy all the time — ‘I cannot train, I cannot do this’,” he said. “Now I am getting older and I learn you have to adjust better.\n“It is what it is, survive the heat, take good rhythm from the good games you play and go back to Manchester. If you cannot train because it is 50 degrees and humid, you don’t train and nothing will happen. It doesn’t matter. These guys play 60 games a season. Today managers at this level don’t have to have training, just be here because the club needs to do that for commercial issues and we have to do it. If people say go there, we go with a big smile, try to do good training sessions and not to get injuries, and come back.”\nIt would have been especially alarming, then, when the City players arrived in Seoul and received a noisy ‘public safety alert’ on their phones: ‘Heat wave warning, maximum temperature of 35 degrees or higher, refrain from outdoor activities, drink enough water, etc. Please take care of your health.’\nTemperatures are in the high 30s during summer in Tokyo, with the ‘feels like’ readings topping 40C (104F). One of the messages that Ruben Dias was asked to repeat in Japanese was a warning to fans to take precautions against the heat. In Korea, the humidity took those ‘feels like’ temperatures up towards 45C (around 110F) and those public safety alerts came in twice a day, as if anybody needed reminding.\nAdvertisement\nThe only respite from the heat came during a two-hour downpour before the Atletico game in Seoul — the public safety alerts that buzzed around the stadium warned of flooded underground car parks this time, but the game went ahead and the humidity returned.\nIt is common for locals to stand in the shade of trees and buildings while waiting to cross the road, and many women carry umbrellas around with them to protect them from the sun. Even so, fans happily stood in the sun for over an hour to buy something at the two games in Tokyo, and many were already wearing official shirts anyway.\nThe queues were, frankly, staggering, with a line around 200 metres long snaking back on itself twice and up stairs, just to get to another, final queue. That was for one kiosk. Others attracted shorter lines than that, but still long enough to put off any casual supporter, especially in the heat. All merchandise sold out and represented the club’s biggest matchday sales figure, even bigger than the highest from last season at the Etihad — the day they lifted the Premier League trophy in May.\nThere’s a genuinely insane queue for just one of the shops set up around the stadium – it starts all the way back there (and then some), up the stairs and then into here (and then a bonus pic of an actually photogenic stadium) pic.twitter.com/8aORDJGkB5\n— Sam Lee (@SamLee) July 23, 2023\nSimilar queues for the chance to have pictures taken with the three trophies that City won last season also highlight the value of the club’s on-pitch success in attracting new supporters.\nNot that City have simply turned up in Asia without much previous thought: in many ways they are always here. Japanese car giant Nissan has been a long-term sponsor, Asahi has sponsored the Etihad Stadium’s tunnel club hospitality area and now the training kits, and Korean company Nexen Tire has been a City partner since 2015, sponsoring, among other things, the sleeve on the official shirts and even the physical bridge between the Etihad and the academy stadium.\nCity players have been popping up in TV commercials and on billboards in Japan and Korea for years and a previous trip to Yokohama and Hong Kong in 2019 will have done no harm when it comes to growing the fanbase either. Nor will becoming champions of Europe.\nThe collaborations here will have only strengthened the connection to the area: Bernardo Silva, Scott Carson and Maximo Perrone sang karaoke in Tokyo with supporters (the playlist included Blue Moon, Wonderwall by Oasis and Voulez Vous by ABBA (with ‘Bernardoooo’ substituted in). Erling Haaland, John Stones and Palmer were wrangled into giving out pie and chips to locals and after receiving a birthday cake in Tokyo, Haaland got a second one in Seoul as birthday cafes are another popular tradition.\nAdvertisement\nThe new third shirt was launched in Tokyo, with Haaland, Jack Grealish and new signing Mateo Kovacic modelling it on location. Kazuchika Okada, a Japanese WWE wrestler and City fan, had his pictures taken with the three trophies won last season, and Jisoo, the Blackpink singer who met Haaland in Seoul, has nearly 75 million Instagram followers.\nThe only surprise is that the fireworks that greeted City’s first goal of the tour, Stones’ sweet strike against Yokohama, were purely coincidence: the local baseball team, the Swallows, were playing in the stadium next door (there is also a rugby stadium next to that) and it is common for fireworks to signal the start of the fifth innings — and that was at the exact moment that the ball hit the net.\nRuben Dias was asked about life in Tokyo and said he could see himself living there, which could be put down as generosity to his hosts but it is something he has said privately, too, and once his press conference wrapped up he went out of his way to add more praise.\n“I would just like to say one more thing about Tokyo that I forgot before,” he said, “the city is so clean, I would like to congratulate you on that.” There are very few bins on the streets — Japanese people tend to carry around a small bag to put their litter in to dispose of at home — and the ground at the popular Shibuya junction, where tourists cram into an overlooking Starbucks to video hundreds of people crossing in different directions, is regularly swept by hand.\nIt is not usual for Japanese people to wear football shirts in day-to-day life, but on the day of games there were a lot of City jerseys around Tokyo: a De Bruyne shirt in the food court of Kabukicho Tower, which houses a traditional Japanese arcade and cinema screens over several floors. There were Grealish shirts in Shibuya’s packed Pokemon Centre, and a Foden shirt dotted among the Harajuku girls just up the road.\nThose three are by far the most popular, alongside Haaland.\n“Our No 9, absolutely brilliant, man,” says 19-year-old City fan Ryo Abe, in a Manchester accent. “I was born and raised in Japan but I like Manchester. I learned the accent by watching Manchester football bloggers online.”\nAdvertisement\nYuki, 35, explains Haaland’s popularity further: “He is fantastic, powerful, he has no limits. His future is beautiful. I hope he likes Japanese culture, Japanese food and Japanese things.\n“The thing is that his lotus goal celebration is in the Japanese style. It’s absolutely incredible, it’s a Japanese thing. We are very proud and happy about his goal celebration. Meditation is from Japanese Buddhism and ‘Zen’. I think Haaland is like us Japanese. He has the Japanese mentality.”\nInevitably there were loud cheers for all of the star players when their names were read aloud inside the stadiums, as well as more subdued efforts for more peripheral players, just like you would expect at the Etihad. It was interesting to note that Joao Cancelo was among those to get the biggest cheers, given he was booed when he returned to City with Bayern in April and that his general popularity has nosedived among the club’s western support.\nAccording to locals, there are a few reasons for that: technical players like Cancelo, and David Silva, are extremely popular, more so than strikers and defenders, which is apparently rooted in comic book culture. On top of that, the lead protagonist in anime series Aoashi is a full-back. There is also not the same “no player is bigger than the club” mentality in Japan, with many fans supporting teams because of particular players, and another reason could be that the details of Cancelo’s exit — how he became regarded as disruptive by Guardiola — are not as well known.\nIn Korea the overwhelming favourites are Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne with Foden not far behind, judging by the decibel levels inside the World Cup stadium when their names were read out or faces flashed up on big screens. The screams were ear-splitting in Korea, where fans show their support for their favourite teams or artists a lot more obviously than in Japan. There were plenty of other shirts in the stadium — Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal among them — but sky blue was everywhere. There was even a minute’s applause after 21 minutes for David Silva, the City legend who retired last week due to a knee injury.\n“There are a huge amount of fans here in Korea, which I didn’t expect,” Kovacic said at his press conference. Other players have opened up on one of Guardiola’s main themes of the summer so far.\n“The manager already picked up on that, he doesn’t want anyone slipping up or being too casual,” Nathan Ake says.\nAdvertisement\n“We spoke about tracking back. Maybe sometimes when things are nice and when you’re good, maybe everything is good when you have the ball, but when we have to defend and everyone has to run back maybe it’s not with the same intensity.\n“Little things like this the manager really picks up on and says it straight away, he says we can’t do that, we can’t drop the mentality because all over the years when we are pressing teams we come with the energy and we don’t let teams breathe but if we drop that then you drop the levels.”\nStones also shed some light on how City like to work at this time of year, with long running sessions off limits even in the 12C temperatures of east Manchester.\n“When we look at the stats and what we’re actually doing in the day-to-day training sessions it’s just like doing a running session, we just do everything with the ball,” Stones explains. “I think it’s a win-win because we’re keeping mentally focused, knowing our roles and responsibilities and knowing what he’s asking of us.\n“It’s about getting back in the rhythm and the little habits that we were so good at last season, we’re not missing out on that time while we’re training, we’re with the ball, we’re in shape.”\nCity have got used to playing pre-season games without their top players because they contribute so many internationals to summer tournaments, but despite having everybody together from day one in Asia they are in a similar situation to recent years, which also owes to their season finishing in the middle of June.\n“I wouldn’t say we are far away but we are a way from our best conditions to be in top, top form,” Guardiola said in Tokyo. “But that is normal. We rely on the mentality and principles that we have, we have one week in Manchester to train specifically for that final and prepare a little bit better than we can train here. It is what it is and what it has been in previous seasons, we always play the Community Shield not in a good condition.”\nNot perfect preparations for a new season, then, but as Guardiola notes they are at least used to that. And given how well everything else went, it will surely not be long before City are back in Asia.\n(Header photo by Lexy Ilsley – Manchester City/Manchester City FC via Getty Images)",
