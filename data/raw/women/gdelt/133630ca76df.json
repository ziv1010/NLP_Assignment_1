The second was a spectacular long-range effort under pressure which curled into the top left corner.\nMomentum swung in Broadmeadow's favour briefly but Maitland soon took it back in the 80th minute when Peel played a long ball beyond Magic's back line and Stapleford sped towards the goal and finished at a tight angle into the bottom right corner.\nThe Newcastle Jets forward completed her match treble from the penalty spot in the 89th minute after Jemma Lawson was deemed to have fouled Maitland's Indianna Auddino in Magic's 18-yard box.\nMaitland coach Keelan Hamilton said his side dominated the match in the opening-half and deserved to take all three points from the contest.\n\"I was really happy with how we performed for the first 60 minutes and particularly in the first half, I thought we were really good,\" he said.\n\"The only disappointing thing I could say is that we weren't further ahead than 1-0 at halftime and then when we got to 2-0, just that little bit of lapse in concentration let them back in.\"\nThe Magpies host Adamstown on Sunday at Cooks Square Park and have opened up a 10-point gap on the Rosebuds who are in fifth spot.\nTwo points seperate first and fourth on the ladder and Hamilton said the closeness of the competition is great for women's football in the Hunter.\n\"The four goals that we've lost have only been by the single goal, so we've been in all of those fixtures, so where we are right now, we deserve to be there,\" he said.\n\"It sets up a really exciting last eight matches and if we can do what we are capable of doing then we've got ourselves in with a chance of playing some really big fixtures towards the end of the season.\"\nHamilton said he expects Madison Gallegos (ribs) and Chelsea Greguric (ankle) to recover in time for the match on Sunday.\nIn other sporting news:",
