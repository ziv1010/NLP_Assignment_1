This had a positive impact on participants from around the world.”\nAspire Academy Global Summit 2024 Chairman Ali Salem Afif (left) and Executive Director of the Aspire Academy Global Summit Professor Valter Di Salvo (second left) with participants of the star chat.\nThe Global Summit compliments the work done all-year-round work by the Aspire in the World Fellows community. He thanked the organizing committee members of the 2024 Aspire Global Summit and the Marketing and Communications Department, led by Al Anoud Al Misnad, for their invaluable efforts.\nAl Anoud Al Misnad, Director of Marketing and Communications at Aspire Academy, remarked that hosting the 2024 Aspire Global Summit in the breathtaking setting of Qatar’s Sealine Desert brings a special essence to this 10th edition, reflecting an aspect of our nation’s culture.\nAl Anoud, who also serves as a member of the summit’s organizing committee, added that the impressive attendance and broad participation of Aspire Fellows from around the world, along with prominent guest speakers, highlight the importance of the Aspire Academy Global Summit. After 10 years since its inaugural edition in Paris in 2014, it is inspiring to see this 10th edition in Qatar receiving such outstanding international participation and engagement over two full days.\nA feast under the desert stars\nThe summit’s first day concluded with an unforgettable gala dinner, held amidst the stunning desert landscapes of the Outpost Al Barari. VIP guests, Aspire in the World Fellows, and sponsors enjoyed an exceptional dining experience under the starry sky with the sand beneath their feet.\nItalian basketball coach Sergio Scariolo with Aspire Academy Director of Marketing and Communications Al Anoud Al Misnad.\nThe evening’s highlight was a Star Chat with Italian basketball coach Sergio Scariolo, current head coach of the Spanish national basketball team. Under his leadership, Spain has won both a World Cup and four European Basketball Championship titles. During his talk, Scariolo shared valuable coaching techniques and emphasized the importance of continual learning and building strong connections with players.\n“One of the most important tips I can give is a word you should all keep away from — ‘complacency’,” Scariolo shared. “Never be satisfied and think your job is done. To stay at the top, you need to keep improving and changing.”\nReflections on evolution in football\nUnfortunately, former Argentina striker Gabriel Batistuta was unable to attend the summit due to unforeseen circumstances.\nHowever, the event continued on its second day with an exciting lineup of roundtables and workshops. A key session focused on the technical and tactical evolution of football over the past decade. Gerrard Trives Guardiola from Barcelona’s Methodology Department provided valuable insights into how the club’s style of play has adapted following the departure of legends like Lionel Messi and Neymar. He stressed the importance of allowing young players to express themselves while adapting to evolving tactical demands.\nMeanwhile, Jose Tavares, Academy Director at Porto FC, emphasized the need to anticipate future trends in football to start implementing change early. He also discussed the significance of emotional moments in a player’s journey and how these can be harnessed to motivate players to achieve more. Cristian Javier Ramirez Lizana, Tactical Performance Analyst for the Brazilian Women’s National Team, highlighted that effective communication is not only about how information is delivered, but equally about how it is received. He stressed the importance of understanding how different players process feedback, so technical staff can tailor their approach accordingly.\nThe future of football performance: What’s next?\nDarragh Connolly, Head of Academy Performance at Juventus, emphasized the importance of preparing young players for professional football as academies expand across various age groups. He stressed that the entire structure of a football club must be aligned to ensure players are ready for the challenges of the professional game. Rick Cost, Director of High Performance at US Soccer, pointed out that a one-size-fits-all approach to development is not feasible across all football institutions.\nHe advocated for tailored strategies and philosophies that cater to the unique needs of each club and player. Looking ahead, Cost highlighted the rapid rise of Artificial Intelligence and its potential to transform football. He urged delegates to stay ahead of this trend, stressing the importance of using AI wisely to enhance coaching and performance analysis.\nIn a special moment, Aspire Academy graduate and four-time Olympic high jump medallist Mutaz Barshim made a guest appearance during the final afternoon of the summit. His presence underscored the Academy’s commitment to excellence across all sporting disciplines.\nThe summit also recognized several members of the Aspire in the World Fellows with special awards, honouring their contributions and unwavering support throughout the last 10 editions of the Global Summit.\nA successful conclusion\nThe two-day summit concluded with great success, offering a wealth of knowledge, networking opportunities, and inspiration for the global sports community.
