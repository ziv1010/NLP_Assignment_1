Per The Athletic's Melanie Anzidei, Hayes took it upon herself to set up the meeting.\n\"The girls (on the USWNT team) asked me afterward, 'Did you know who he who he was?' And I said, 'I was the one who set it up,'\" Hayes said. \"He is someone I really admire.\"\nTOP NEWS\nCFB Players You'll Love in 2026 😍\nUnderclassmen Who Could Win Heisman 💪\nReport: B1G's 24-Team CFP Proposal 👀\nHayes said she spoke to Sanders about caring for others and doing the things they love. She also admitted that she was \"fangirling\" meeting the Pro Football Hall of Famer.\nHayes led the USWNT in their first match of her tenure on Saturday against South Korea. She spent the last 12 years leading Chelsea in Women in the Women's Super League. Under her direction, Chelsea finished at the top of the Champions League eight times, including five consecutive seasons from 2019 to 2024.\nNow, she takes on a new task of coaching the U.S. Women's National Team. After her initial match against South Korea on Saturday, Hayes and the USWNT will have a handful of international friendly matches before competing in Copa América starting in June. In July, they will compete in the Paris Olympics.",
