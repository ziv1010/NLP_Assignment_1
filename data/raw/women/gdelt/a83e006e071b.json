On the line are bragging rights and the opportunity to set a new world record.\nDuring the 2022 season, U-T set a world record for the World’s Largest College Recycling Event as 38,452.2 pounds of reused or recyclable materials at its Nov. 12 home game. When the 2023 season rolled around, they issued a challenge to the University of Michigan and its fan base.\nA zero-waste Michigan Stadium supports U-M’s commitment to sustainability in education, research, and operations. Michigan Stadium has a 20-year recycling tradition and is committed to diverting recyclable and compostable materials from landfills.\nTo participate in the Recycle Bowl on Sept. 23, fans are encouraged to deposit each plastic, paper, aluminum, cardboard, and compostable product used during the game in the proper recycling or compost bins.\n“Michigan Athletics is pleased to partner with the University of Tennessee in the Recycle Bowl,” says Kurt Svoboda, associate athletic director for external communications and public relations. “Our efforts in Ann Arbor are specifically aimed at supporting our campus-wide sustainability effort known as Planet Blue and achieving our zero-waste goal.”\nFor more information, visit here.\nMichigan Tech Week Coming to Ann Arbor Oct. 9-12\nMichigan Tech Week (MTW), a public event celebrating Michigan’s tech ecosystem organized by Michigan Founders Fund and partners, will take place in Ann Arbor Oct. 9-12 at the University of Michigan football stadium.\nThe conference, now in its second year, is co-chaired by Midwest House and supported by a coalition of the state’s innovation ecosystem builders in an effort to bring together and showcase founders with high-growth business models.\nDesigned through the lens of a founder-first programming experience, it is most relevant to those who are interested in understanding how to start or scale their business, curious about successful startup development, finding ways to develop a solid professional network, and make an impact within the community. This also is an opportunity for students to surround themselves with entrepreneurial peers, investors, and thought leaders to help them build a community and network that will pave the way for their future success.\nMTW will include pitch competitions in the programming during which entrepreneurs will showcase their companies and products to national panels of venture capitalists and other startup experts in order to receive funding and investments to grow their business.\nThere will be five startup pitch competition tracks taking place this year, offering more than $260,000 in total funding. The first-place winners of each competition also will receive free legal services and a $5,000 MiSpringboard grant from Varnum Law.\nPitch competition tracks include:\n- Pitch & Pilot Showcase by Bamboo + Community Financial Credit Union\n- eLab AI Launchpad Pitch Competition\n- Michigan Life Sciences Entrepreneur’s Association Business Plan Competition 2023\n- Michigan Entrepreneur Summit (university track)\n- Michigan Founders Fund Venture Competition\nKeynote speakers include Charles Hudson, managing partner at Precursor Ventures; Devon Townsend, co-founder and chief product officer at Cameo; Melissa Butler, founder and CEO of The Lip Bar; and Stacy Philpot-Brown of Cherry Rock Capital.\nAdditionally, the conference will welcome nearly 50 guest speakers.\nFor a full agenda and information on how to attend, visit michigantechweek.com.\nL&L Products in Romeo Celebrate Grand Opening of Building Expansion\nL&L Products Inc., a family-owned business-to-business company in the Village of Romeo, celebrated the grand opening of its expanded production facilities to accommodate automotive growth and diversification last week.\nThe occasion was celebrated with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Friday, with L&L shareholders, executive team members, employees, and guests from the local community in attendance.\nThe facility has grown from 322,974 square feet to 464,528 square feet, completing the four-phase site plan that was established when L&L purchased the 26-acre site in 1993. The completed facility now features a main aisle that stretches for nearly a quarter mile, connecting the warehouse to manufacturing areas for greater flexibility.\nThe additional warehouse space was designed to maximize manufacturing, improve material flow, and increase flexibility for future growth in both manufacturing and warehousing.\n“This expansion will allow us to continue to delight and grow with our customer partners and invest in our future with new exciting products,” said John Babi, director of operations at L&L Products Romeo. “Our shareholders believe in the L&L team, the community supports us, and our employees make it happen daily.

A graduate of the Specs Howard School of Media Arts, Maloney never lost his connection to the school’s founders and legendary broadcast mentor, the late Dick Kernen.\nSonic Coast also features another Michigan expat broadcast voice, Maloney’s fellow Specs Howard classmate Jane Asher of San Diego, who originally hailed from the Thumb Region, and found a following while with northern Michigan’s WJML-FM in Petoskey. Asher has been a popular voice on southern California radio since the mid 1980s.\nThe Sonic Coast is accessible via dedicated Android and iOS apps, as well as home listening devices and online at TheSonicCoast.com. The Sonic Coast technology ensures that listeners can tune in from anywhere, anytime. Maloney’s vision is for the station to transcend geographical boundaries, connecting music aficionados with the rhythm of Americana, all while championing the spirit of Michigan’s emerging and established artists.\nNew Rally House Store to Open in Orion Township\nRally House, the Kansas-based sports and merchandise retailer, is planning to open a new store in Orion Township.

These could include cost of goods, freight, duties, and logistics — products, supplies, and/or fees necessary to ensure that orders are fulfilled and delivered on time.\nOxford Commercial Finance officials say this type of flexible business financing is vital for manufacturers, importers, exporters, and distributors when the speed at which they are signing new orders is outpacing the company’s existing cash flow, supplier credit, and/or existing revolving lines of credit. Furthermore, they say purchase order financing helps build a company’s balance sheet (receivables, cash, and inventory) without giving up equity, making it attractive to certain types of corporations, partnerships, and family-owned entities. Competitive financing rates based upon annual sales volumes, average invoice size, payment terms extended to customers, and borrower’s credit quality.\nFor more information, visit oxfordcommercialfinance.com.\nJoe Muer Detroit Hosts Wine Pairing Dinner Event Oct. 3\nJoe Muer Detroit in the Renaissance Center will be giving guests the chance to enjoy a wine pairing dinner event Oct. 3 that will feature some of Napa Valley’s finest wines and a chance to meet winemaker Hugh Davies of Schramsberg Vineyards.\nThe evening will begin at 6 p.m. with a welcome reception featuring hors d’oeuvres followed by a four-course plated dinner with wine pairings.\nThe cost is $150 per person (tax and gratuity not included).

The new diffusers scatter highs in all directions and the bass traps absorb the lows,” explains Lai. “This is the way a professional recording space should be.”\nSouthfield’s Advance Capital Management Named to Barron’s 2023 Top 100 RIA Firms List\nAdvance Capital Management, an independent wealth management firm in Southfield, has been named to the Barron’s 2023 Top 100 RIA Firms list.\nThe list recognizes the top independent registered investment advisers, known as RIAs, in the country, based on a variety of factors including assets under management, performance, and technology.\nThis is the third year that Advance Capital Management has made the list.

The State of the Black and Brown Plate will be an in-depth look at the heart and soul of Detroit’s culinary scene.\nChef Phil Jones, organizer of the event, says the event was the result of frustration and anger he felt when the Detroit City Council failed to adopt a simple color-coded grading system for restaurants in 2022.\n“It wasn’t just a bureaucratic setback,” Jones says. “It was a slap in the face. Lansing lobbyists used the Black and Brown food community as a reason for non-support, saying we weren’t up to the task. It was a misrepresentation and an insult. This event was created to take control of the narrative in Detroit’s restaurant scene.”\nThe event begins at 8 a.m. with a breakfast and networking session, with registration opening at 8:30 a.m. The panel discussions will begin at 9:10 a.m. with “Detroit is Different,” a conversation between Khary Frazier of Detroit is Different and Lavaughan Calhoun of Buddah Foods. They will discuss their work and their perspective as Black men in food spaces intersecting with culture.\nSeveral other panels and speeches will follow. The final panel of the day will start at 3:15 p.m. and be moderated by Jones. Entitled “It’s All Good,” the panel will feature chef Shanel Dewalt, owner of Shanel Marie Concepts and Chef for Make Food Not Waste; chef Jermond Booze, co-founder of Taste the Diaspora; Tree Graves of Love Only Detroit and owner of TV Lounge; and Harry Todd, entrepreneur and president of Alpha Phi Alpha, Gamma Lambda Chapter, who will discuss the new face of food advocacy and charity.\nWhile admission to the event is free, a ticket is required.

This, coupled with the increasing costs of inflation and fuel, makes it even more challenging to provide essential furniture items to people who need them most.”\nThe Furniture Bank’s Comedy Night, featuring the live stand-up of Paul Mecurio, will include a comedy show, full buffet dinner, 50/50 raffle, and a live auction.\nTickets are $80 each and can be purchased online at this link or by contacting the Furniture Bank at 248-332-1300.\nThose interested in making a tax-deductible furniture donation can call 248-332-1300 or visit here to coordinate free pick up. The Furniture Bank makes donating furniture easy and will take items from the porch or garage at no charge. For only $75, trained movers will carefully remove mattresses, box springs, dressers, dining sets, and basic living room furniture from a home. The Furniture Bank also will remove items such as China cabinets, desks, and armoires for a modest charge.\nSaunteel Jenkins Named Mission Speaker at American Cancer Society’s Detroit Discovery Ball\nThe American Cancer Society has announced that Saunteel Jenkins will be the 2023 mission speaker at the Nov. 11 Detroit Discovery Ball at The Filmore Detroit.\nJenkins, a cancer survivor, has been CEO of The Heat and Warmth Fund (THAW) since 2014.
