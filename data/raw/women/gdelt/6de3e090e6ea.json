  "body_text": "Sorry to fans of podcasters-turned-reality-TV-stars. We are here to report that, unlike last season, there are no microphone fiends set to compete on Survivor 48, which premieres Feb. 26 on CBS, but the cast does feature a variety of professions.\nThat includes a debate professor, a stunt performer, and a pizzeria manager. There’s also a substance abuse counselor, a music executive, and a surgeon, as well as both a fire captain and a fire lieutenant. (What if they battle it out at the final four?!)\nBut we have much more info than mere professions for you. We have the photos and full bios of the new Survivor 48 cast, including their hobbies, pet peeves, and biggest accomplishments, as well as their favorite former players.\nWe also have a glimpse at the three tribes set to do battle, so settle in and enjoy your first look at the Survivor 48 contestants as you count down the days until Feb. 26.\nStephanie Berger\nAge: 38\nHometown: New York City, N.Y.\nCurrent residence: Brooklyn, N.Y.\nOccupation: Tech product lead\nThree words to describe you: Ambitious, outgoing, resilient\nWhy do you want to be part of Survivor? I love this game. You can only armchair quarterback for so long when you’re as challenge minded as I can be before you realize you need to shut up and play. Fewer than 700 people have played this game — and fewer than 50 have won. I want to be one of them.\nWhat’s one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Teaching middle school in New Orleans as part of Teach for America, and staying in the classroom for eight years, far beyond my two-year initial commitment, uniquely prepared me for the game. That experience drove home the importance of strong relationships. Kids want to learn from someone they know cares about them. Juries (often) vote for the person they have the strongest relationship with.\nWhich previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I’ve thought about this question for months now and I still don’t know if there’s ever been a previous player quite like me! I hope to have Natalie Anderson’s fierceness, Yam Yam’s humor and strategy, all while forging my own path to the win.\nWhat will you value in an alliance partner? Information. Someone who puts the “tea” in loyalty and sees the game the same way I do.\nFavorite hobbies: Talking, making elaborate Mardi Gras costumes.\nPet peeves: QR code menus in restaurants. When someone accidentally steps on the back of my flip flops.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? The community of friends and chosen family I’ve built for myself. My mother passed away [recently] and my people are a big reason I have the strength to be here today, chasing my dream.\nWhat is something we would never know from looking at you? Most people see the blonde curls and the jingle-jangle jewelry and don’t think “business woman.” But I run a business, leading highly technical projects for a household e-commerce company.\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? All the women in my life. The strength, grace, caring, determination, humor, spirit, and love they possess and routinely demonstrate.\nWhy will you be the Sole Survivor? When you peel back all the layers, Survivor is about making it to the end sitting next to two people you can beat. The adaptability and resilience to make it to the end, the smarts to make the right moves along the way, and the storytelling ability to put it all in front of the jury. They shouldn’t let me get anywhere near final tribal.\nShauhin Davari\nAge: 38\nHometown: East Bay, Calif.\nCurrent residence: Costa Mesa, Calif.\nOccupation: Debate professor\nThree words to describe you: Charismatic, driven, clever\nWhy do you want to be part of Survivor? Less than 800 people have ever played Survivor, the greatest game ever invented. I get to be the first Persian male to ever play and win. And I’m out here because I promised my mom I’d make it. Momma! We made it!\nWhat’s one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? My whole life is weirdly prep for Survivor. Running a speech and debate team requires working with all different people. Motivating them toward a common goal, while working socially to put your team in position to succeed.\nWhich previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? Probably Penner. He had an ability to relate to people that was special. He pushed too hard at times, bit his nose to spite his face even, but I think I’ll play a new-era version of his game.\nWhat will you value in an alliance partner? I need a strategist. I have all kinds of hair-brained ideas. I need someone to tell me I’m stupid. Call me out and better my ideas into solid plans.\nFavorite hobbies: Learning new hobbies. Non-contact sports. I’m too fragile for contact sports. Chess, boardgames. Podcasts. Writing. I have an addictive personality. I will get into anything put in front of me and obsess over it.\nPet peeves: Folks who miss the forest for the trees/inability to see big picture/lack of appreciation. Being interrupted. I love the sound of my voice.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Professionally: I coach a forensics team (speech debate and theater) and we won four national championships in a row between 2015 and 2018. But after the pandemic, the team went from 70 students down to seven. My proudest accomplishment is reestablishing an incredible, life-changing space for my students, even winning another championship. Personally: getting my mom, brother, partner, and entire community obsessed with Survivor Wednesday nights at our church.\nWhat is something we would never know from looking at you? I’m incredibly sensitive. More understanding and forgiving than I look. Emotionally intelligent. I’m persuadable. I really try to stay open minded.\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? My brother. He paved the way for me. Turned around, came back, held my hand and walked me through life. I lead people because I feel we all deserve an older brother like him. My mom – the things she went through to make and remake our family... insane. And now, she’s still willing to learn, change, and grow.\nWhy will you be the Sole Survivor? I’m the perfect combo. Socially, savvy. Strategically competent without being over the top. Athletically underestimated. Resilience is in my blood. In any game I play: my eyes stay on the prize.\nEva Erickson\nAge: 24\nHometown: Eagan, Minn.\nCurrent residence: Providence, R.I.\nOccupation: PhD Candidate\nThree words to describe you: Energetic, driven, competitive\nWhy do you want to be part of Survivor? For myself, I love the competition and the huge challenge this game presents. But on a bigger-picture scale, I want to go on Survivor to show the world a version of Autism they don’t often portray in mainstream media. I am Autistic, but my Autism experience is unique and will give people hope that even if they are on the spectrum they can still accept who they are and be successful.\nWhat’s one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? I was the first and only girl to play men’s hockey at Georgia Tech and am currently the captain of the men’s club hockey team at Brown University. I am used to competing against men twice my size who think they are better than me. I am prepared to bring my fierce competitive nature to my game of Survivor.\nWhich previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? Denise or Lindsey, female players that were super strong and absolute beasts in challenges.\nWhat will you value in an alliance partner? Loyalty. I am a very loyal person and I intend to form strong alliances that I can trust. I don’t intend to play a game of blindsiding those who trust me. I want to find a No. 1 to stick with through and through.\nFavorite hobbies: Hockey, water sports, rollerblading.\nPet peeves: Lazy people, wet socks.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I can’t pick one. I am simply proud of how hard I have worked in all facets of my life and how that has culminated to huge goals being reached in my PHD, reffing career, and hockey career. I am so proud of all my hard work paying off.\nWhat is something we would never know from looking at you? I have Autism, I was diagnosed very young and my family was told I would never live independently. I have succeeded in life far beyond anyone’s imagination of my life having achieved big goals in hockey, my officiating career, my doctoral studies, and in forming so many friends who love me for who I am.\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? My family: my dad’s work ethic, my mom’s kindness, and my sister's perseverance. I strive to have all their qualities in my life.\nWhy will you be the Sole Survivor? I’m gritty as hell. I will work harder than anyone else in this game. I also am smart and smart enough to hide my intelligence. This is a game of minimizing perceived threat level so by emphasizing my physical abilities while downplaying my intelligence I will fly under the radar to success.\nKyle Fraser\nAge: 31\nHometown: Roanoke, Va.\nCurrent residence: Brooklyn, N.Y.\nOccupation: Attorney\nThree words to describe you: Fun, crafty, social\nWhy do you want to be part of Survivor? It’s the best game on earth. Even though my (and my tribe mates') backgrounds will color the game, they can’t control the game. It’s the one place where your actions inside of this society are almost entirely what matters. Beautiful!\nWhat’s one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? I taught a GED and history/humanities course at a juvenile detention center. Understandably, learning was not front-of-mind for my students who were in such a traumatic environment. But I found ways to connect and I’m proud of that.\nWhich previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? 1) Davie. He was unabashedly himself in light of the stereotypes he noted that were constantly forced on him as a black man. 2) Jay. I think he’s one of the most underrated Survivor players ever, especially given the obstacles he faced in a season with a very strong cast.\nWhat will you value in an alliance partner? An open mind and willingness to play the game with intention — while still having fun.\nFavorite hobbies: Playing with my dogs, house plants, gym.\nPet peeves: Uppity people/those who look down on others. Styrofoam.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I argued and won a jury trial on behalf of my juvenile client, [who was] facing felony charges, during my second year of law school.\nWhat is something we would never know from looking at you? I will be a successful author one day.\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? My older brother. He has been a consistent rock in my family throughout my hardships. I would not be here today without him.\nWhy will you be the Sole Survivor? For a multitude of reasons, I have been forced to interact with many different types of people in many different environments. I’m a people person with diverse experiences. It should help.\nMitch Guerra\nAge: 34\nHometown: Waco, Tex.\nCurrent residence: Waco, Tex.\nOccupation: P.E. Coach\nThree words to describe you: Joyful, relational, competitive\nWhy do you want to be part of Survivor? I want to prove to myself that my speech impediment doesn’t limit me and that I can come out here and compete with anyone.\nWhat’s one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Growing up as a person who stutters really forced me to become comfortable being uncomfortable. It forced me to work through hard moments every day by continually putting myself out there, thus allowing me to become more resilient.\nWhich previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I resonate with Spencer Bledsoe and Joe Anglim because of their competitiveness and love for the game. John Cochran, the second time he played. He wasn’t afraid to make moves and he played to win when others probably underestimated him.\nWhat will you value in an alliance partner? Someone who is easy to talk to and listens well. Someone who values your opinion and is level-headed and understands this game is built on strong relationships.\nFavorite hobbies: Lifting weights or running with friends, going dancing, playing tennis, volleyball, or slow-pitch softball.\nPet peeves: People who always have to be right. People who interrupt or who are not good listeners, people who complain and are negative.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Being a first-generation college student and graduating from Texas A+M University.\nWhat is something we would never know from looking at you? I love endurance sports! I started running two years ago and since then I’ve done my first half marathon, full marathon, 20-mile trail race and Ironman 70.3.\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? My mom; she sacrifices for those around her, she loves incredibly well and she has a heart of gold.\nWhy will you be the Sole Survivor? Because of my ability to build relationships with people. I’m non-threatening and can use that to my advantage in this game. I thrive in a little chaos and when things get challenging is when I thrive.\nSaiounia \"Sai\" Hughley\nAge: 30\nHometown: Philadelphia, Pa.\nCurrent residence: Simi Valley, Calif.\nOccupation: Marketing Professional\nThree words to describe you: Outgoing, kind, driven\nWhy do you want to be part of Survivor? Representation will always matter! It’s so important for other young black/POC women to see themselves in spaces not many POC occupy often. I’m doing this for all of the other young Black girls out there seeking the adventure of a lifetime.\nWhat’s one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? The passing of my grandmother. She was such a force and raised me to be one as well. She taught me to continually be in pursuit of what brings me joy.\nWhich previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I really vibe with Maryanne because she played the game as her true quirky self, but I also loved the tenacity of Drea; her go-getter attitude was inspiring! I think I’ll play the game like Maryanne in the sense of being authentically me.\nWhat will you value in an alliance partner? Trust, someone who’s themselves, someone who’s observant and has their fingers on the pulse of the diff dynamics at camp, someone funny, someone strong both mentally and physically.\nFavorite hobbies: Hiking, scrapbooking, volleyball, swim, vision boarding, ceramics.\nPet peeves: People who say “Not to be offensive, but...” and proceed to offend you. People who smack when they chew. People who say the word “moist.” People who pronounce the word \"salmon\" incorrectly.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? There’s a few: being on season 48 of Survivor, receiving a full-ride scholarship to private high school, studying abroad in Argentina, having my dream job at NBC post-college, winning an Associated Press award from their VA chapter.\nWhat is something we would never know from looking at you? That I was Nala in Lion King — off Broadway, don’t get too excited.\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? This is hard! I am going to have to say all of the strong, smart, fearless, and kind women who helped raise me. It truly does take a village.\nWhy will you be the Sole Survivor? My social skills are unmatched, I have true gift of gab but also an ability to make others feel valued, seen, and heard.\nJoe Hunter\nAge: 45\nHometown: Vacaville, Calif.\nCurrent residence: West Sacramento, Calif.\nOccupation: Fire Captain\nThree words to describe you: Courageous, compassionate, loving/kick-ass dad!\nWhy do you want to be part of Survivor? My sister. She was a big fan of the show from when it started. She asked me to apply years ago, and many times. I didn’t think we could do it. Then she was taken from me by domestic violence. It took me years, but this is for her. It is about doing this for her and giving her peace that her brother did it! And did it for her!\nWhat’s one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? I lost my sister from domestic violence. That event showed me I can do anything and never give up. Her loss was hard to explain, how painful it was, but has shown me I can do/overcome anything.\nWhich previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? Cody — well-rounded and loved.\nWhat will you value in an alliance partner? Loyal, don’t go “crazy” when things get wild. (Just be normal, and cool, please).\nFavorite hobbies: Taking my kids to the pool, family trips, dance party with my little kiddos. Going to Tahoe with the family.\nPet peeves: Rude people, selfish people, mean people, people who tailgate/cut you off while driving. Bad hugs, people who don’t make eye contact. Basically anything acting like a “butthole.”\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Being a good dad. This takes every inch of your heart, mind, and soul to truly do this. You have to put “you” second and make your sole purpose in life to make great little people.\nWhat is something we would never know from looking at you? I love to draw cartoons for my little girl. And she loves them even if you can’t tell who did the work, her or me!\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? My father. He passed very quickly and unexpectedly in 2018. He was and is the greatest man I have ever known. His support, loyalty, bravery, and wisdom inspire me to always be my best.\nWhy will you be the Sole Survivor? I have been through so much loss, pain, and struggle. This has given me the power to overcome anything. This has given me the power to overcome and be the next Sole Survivor.\nKamilla Karthigesu\nAge: 31\nHometown: Toronto, Canada\nCurrent residence: Foster City, Calif.\nOccupation: Software engineer\nThree words to describe you: Silly, expressive, impatient\nWhy do you want to be part of Survivor? I’ve wanted to play since I was nine cause the challenges looked fun, but now I’m old, so they look less fun. Instead, I want to play a solid, fun game and rep brown girls well, since our representation was non-existent when I was growing up. I wanna show all the brown girls life’s better when you ignore the aunties and do the exact opposite of what they want you to do. You be yourself and you love yourself.\nWhat’s one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Failing every step of the way when starting my career. Failed to get into the “right” college program. Failed to transfer into the “right program.” Failed to convert any of my internships into full-time jobs. Failed to find a job in the field I wanted. I never let myself mourn my dreams getting crushed. I immediately went into “how do I continue and succeed from here?” mode and it worked out better than expected. Things won’t always go my way in Survivor, but I can handle that!\nWhich previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? Identify with the most, Maryanne. She was her fun, goofy self out there. Play most like — as much as I’d love to play a dominant game like Tony, I think I’ll end up playing like Erika. Our appearances and mannerisms are so unthreatening, and I think that can help me sneak my way to the end.\nWhat will you value in an alliance partner? Someone with a sense of humor, please! It’s so hard to be around unfunny people and people who don’t know how to have fun.\nFavorite hobbies: Video games (had to quit MapleStory cold turkey when I got the call because I may have an addiction), lifting, and singing off-key (unintentionally) until my husband asks me to stop.\nPet peeves: People who message me \"Hello\" or \"Can I ask you a question?\" without actually asking their questions until I respond. Every time this happens, I lose a year off my life. I’m dead now.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Paying off my parents’ mortgage and becoming a safety net for both my immediate and extended family. Growing up, I watched my parents sponsor and house so many of their siblings, parents, nieces, and nephews who made the move to Canada, so it’s the least I can do.\nWhat is something we would never know from looking at you? I played on a women’s semi-professional VALORANT team in 2021 and we placed Top 16 in the North American Women’s League.\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? My parents. They didn’t have the best opportunities growing up (my mom didn’t get to go to high school), but they sacrificed a solid 20 years of their lives working night shifts, overtime, multiple jobs, anything to bring home extra money to provide opportunities for me and my brother, as well as support their own siblings and parents. There is no one as selfless as them.\nWhy will you be the Sole Survivor? People won’t perceive me as a threat. I’m 5’1” so I’m not a physical threat, and I have a s--- vocabulary, so I don’t sound smart when I speak. But I promise! There’s a brain up there and it has at least one wrinkle!\nDavid Kinne\nAge: 39\nHometown: Long Beach, Calif.\nCurrent residence: Buena Park, Calif.\nOccupation: Stunt Performer\nThree words to describe you: Passionate, Daring, Curious\nWhy do you want to be part of Survivor? I believe my background will give me an advantage in the games in many ways. I’ve gained confidence through my accomplishments, and I seek the adventure, experience, and validation I’d do well. I love challenges and to me, this show seems as if it could challenge me in ways I have not yet been.\nWhat’s one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Many of my experiences have prepared me for this game, but none more than so than the diverse group of people I have lived and worked with across multiple countries and continents. It has allowed me to embrace such a diverse world, filled with extraordinary people across all walks of life.\nWhich previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I am compared to Jonathan Young a lot, and there are obvious similarities, but truthfully I cannot think of a player that I would be like. Though, admittedly, I have not seen every season of Survivor.\nWhat will you value in an alliance partner? Kindness. This is a ruthless game at times. Feelings [will] be hurt, tears shed, and at some period, betrayal will hit. But honoring knowing someone is genuine in their kindness, makes trusting them easier, and forgiving them possible.\nFavorite hobbies: Flying, riding jet skis, diving, gaming, and playing board games.\nPet peeves: A lack of consideration for those around you, someone being rude or ill-mannered.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I have been going to the gym for a long time and despite injuries I have been very consistent with my health and ideals. I am proud of my health, the hard work I’ve put into it and will continue to.\nWhat is something we would never know from looking at you? My favorite movie of all time is Notting Hill.\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? My parents. While no childhood is perfect, I think they did a damn good job raising me and my sisters. I look forward to being a parent one day and I will definitely have learned a lot from them.\nWhy will you be the Sole Survivor? Self-awareness. I know who I am, what I am capable of, and more importantly, how others will perceive me. I will have to face all of these and will use them to my advantage.\nThomas Krottinger\nAge: 34\nHometown: The Woodlands, Tex.\nCurrent residence: Los Angeles, Calif.\nOccupation: Music executive\nThree words to describe you: Outgoing, emotional, loyal\nWhy do you want to be part of Survivor? I always encourage those around me to chase their dreams and be vulnerable, so I feel like it’s time for me to take my own advice and do something I love, even if it scares me to death.\nWhat’s one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? My friend and I lament that we work in “a viper pit” on a regular basis — nothing has prepared me more for this game than the music business.\nWhich previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? Sophie Clarke. The woman has it all. Smart, savvy, personable, and knows when to kick it into high gear and when to blend in with the pack.\nWhat will you value in an alliance partner? Someone who not only is honest with me, but can also be a shield and more of a threat.\nFavorite hobbies: The Real Housewives, homemade ice cream, reading, cold brew, my dogs.\nPet peeves: Being late, traffic, losing to UCLA.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Probably putting myself out there to be on this show and be tested to my limits, when I know deep down I am a delicate man who really loves a nice bed and three meals a day.\nWhat is something we would never know from looking at you? I am a major sports fanatic and college football is one of my favorite things in the world.\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? My husband Michael. He is thoughtful and brave, completely unafraid to do the right thing in any situation.\nWhy will you be the Sole Survivor? I’m going to hoodwink these people into thinking I’m not a threat until it’s too late and there’s nothing they can do.\nKevin Leung\nAge: 34\nHometown: Fremont, Calif.\nCurrent residence: Livermore, Calif.\nOccupation: Finance Manager\nThree words to describe you: Energetic, social, determined.\nWhy do you want to be part of Survivor? I started watching Survivor during Cook Islands and saw Yul Kwon as an inspiration to apply. It has taken some time to be physically ready, but I believe now I have the strategic, social, and physical skills to do well on Survivor.\nWhat’s one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? As a side job post college, I worked at Abercrombie & Fitch as a greeter/model. I learned that effectively complimenting, smiling, and charming people while still being genuine goes a long way in terms of likability. Those skills have prepared me to interact with all kinds of people in Survivor.\nWhich previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? David vs. Goliath was my favorite season. I identify with most of the Davids (Christian, Nick, Davie) because of their tenacity and grit to band together despite their appearances. I hopefully will play like Kaleb from Survivor 45 and use my social charm to influence people, but hopefully not be too charming where they see me as a threat!\nWhat will you value in an alliance partner? I will value someone who is flexible enough to look at all options. Doesn’t mean we are wavering, but thoughtful in weighing out all scenarios before coming to a decision.\nFavorite hobbies: Tennis, Barry’s Bootcamp, escape rooms\nPet peeves: People who are always late.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Getting an MBA and graduating top of my class.\nWhat is something we would never know from looking at you? Though I don’t have children of my own, I really have the desire to help kids with disabilities. In 2019, I volunteered at an orphanage in Ghana and it was the most humbling and rewarding experience of my life.\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? My parents, because they sacrificed and provided everything for me so that I could be successful. I hope to make them proud by showing grit, tenacity, and motivation — values they instilled in me.\nWhy will you be the Sole Survivor? I think I have the winning combination to be Sole Survivor. Athletic, social, and smart? C’mon! I hope to charm my way to the million dollars!\nCedrek McFadden\nAge: 45\nHometown: Columbia, S.C.\nCurrent residence: Greenville, S.C.\nOccupation: Surgeon\nThree words to describe you: Dependable, determined, conscientious\nWhy do you want to be part of Survivor? Having regularly watched Survivor since 2000, I constantly find myself answering how I would react and perform compared to other contestants. As we are not getting any younger, I finally wanted to know the experience for myself. It is a phenomenon that I can't readily shake, so instead of potentially living with the regret of not trying, I am here to experience it for myself.\nWhat’s one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Completing a five-year surgical residency. The hours are long, the work can be the difference between life and death for my patient, and it requires you to dig deep and prepare yourself to help someone else.\nWhich previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I’d like to think Earl Cole. Quiet confidence. The social game of Cirie.\nWhat will you value in an alliance partner? Transparency, reliability, and adaptability.\nFavorite hobbies: Running, singing, watching movies with the family, jigsaw puzzles.\nPet peeves: Tardiness.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Successfully completing my educational journey through medical school, residency, and fellowship.\nWhat is something we would never know from looking at you? I can get lost for hours doing mundane tasks and the hobbies I enjoy, which likely explains the ability to perform long surgeries or complete jigsaw puzzles.\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? My grandmother. Through her, I learned compassion and developed a keen interest in medicine.\nWhy will you be the Sole Survivor? My whole life has prepared me well to walk into this game and be successful. Now that the opportunity has been given to me, I am ready to execute and walk into this victory.\nCharity Nelms\nAge: 34\nHometown: Monroe, Mich.\nCurrent residence: St. Petersburg, Fla.\nOccupation: Flight attendant\nThree words to describe you: Bold, fun, loyal\nWhy do you want to be part of Survivor? Because for years my insecurities held me back from so much in life. I always wanted to be on Survivor but never thought I could do it. Now I’m here making up for lost time and experiences I used to hold myself back from.\nWhat’s one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Being a flight attendant. I deal with hundreds of people and personalities every day. My job is like playing Survivor in a metal tube!\nWhich previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? Tony and Jane are my favorite players, but my game is my own. I’m going out there and playing like me.\nWhat will you value in an alliance partner? Obviously, loyalty and honesty, but also just someone who is fun to play the game with.\nFavorite hobbies: Working out, traveling, reading, creating content.\nPet peeves: When people don't use headphones in public and blast their phones on full volume.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Losing 100 pounds and getting healthy inside and out, and now coaching women through their health journeys.\nWhat is something we would never know from looking at you? Ya girl can sing.\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? My dad. He is the smartest and most generous person I have ever met. He is truly brilliant and so humble.\nWhy will you be the Sole Survivor? Because I don't quit. I always find a way when I’m all in on something.\nJustin Pioppi\nAge: 29\nHometown: Winthrop, Mass.\nCurrent residence: Winthrop, Mass.\nOccupation: Pizzeria manager\nThree words to describe you: Compassionate, hard-working, resilient\nWhy do you want to be part of Survivor? Survivor has been a family passion for over two decades. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I want to put my education, life experience, and preparation to the ultimate test!\nWhat’s one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Believe it or not, working at Luigi’s (our family restaurant). We’re graced everyday with customers who hail from every corner of the globe. No two people are alike in their tastes and preferences, but we always leave them feeling full and happy.\nWhich previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I’ve always been a big fan of Tyson – he possesses a unique combination of intelligence, athleticism, wit, determination, and humor (and hair! Can’t forget the hair!) If I can emulate even a fraction of his approach, I think I can make a deep run.\nWhat will you value in an alliance partner? I really want to work with someone who we can bounce ideas off of. You’re out here in your own head, and just to have an outlet to talk strategy and advance both your games will be so useful.\nFavorite hobbies: Horse racing, listening to sports talk radio, and cooking (especially pizza).\nPet peeves: Not reusing/recycling something, pants without pockets (useless), people who interrupt someone when he/she is trying to make a point.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I was the youngest legislative aide in the history of the Massachusetts State House. At the time, I didn’t think much of it. I just wanted to help my boss any way that I could. But looking back, it’s really awesome to have worked at the highest level of state politics as a teenager.\nWhat is something we would never know from looking at you? That I have been a vegetarian for my entire life! I’ve always had a love for animals and never even had a temptation to try meat. However, despite this dietary choice, I’m a lot stronger than I appear.\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? Without question, my mother. From having founded and grown our family restaurant over 40 years ago to having battled (and beaten) cancer three separate times, she’s been playing Survivor her whole life! Despite everything she’s been through, she never complains, still maintains a positive attitude, and keeps a great sense of humor.\nWhy will you be the Sole Survivor? Because I never back down from anything I’ve done in my life. The word \"quit\" is not in my vocabulary. I don’t see that attitude changing on the island.\nBianca Roses\nAge: 33\nHometown: West Orange, N.J.\nCurrent residence: Arlington, Va.\nOccupation: PR Consultant\nThree words to describe you: Bold, friendly, enthusiastic\nWhy do you want to be part of Survivor? Joining the Survivor family is a dream come true. I’ve been watching the show since season 1, when I was eight years old, and I am so incredibly grateful to be living out a life goal. I can't wait to meet new amazing humans, push my strength and positive mindset that I’ve always been proud of to new limits, and hopefully be a living example that being your authentic self is one of the bravest things you can do.\nWhat’s one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Starting my own company. My 10-year career in public relations has given me invaluable skills for this game (strategic mindset, relationship building mastery, succeeding under pressure), and starting my own business has brought those skills to unlocked hidden levels.\nWhich previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? Dee, Kenzie, Maryanne, Michele. They are badass, strong-willed, kind, and played impeccable social games. I persuade for a living. I persuade multi-million dollar companies to work with me, I persuade people, I persuade journalists to write about my clients, and I’ll persuade my heart out on the island for 26 days. By working for myself I need to believe in myself and rely on myself in order to get paid. Let’s go get that mil!\nWhat will you value in an alliance partner? Vibes. Someone who I genuinely connect with, can work with, can laugh with, can brainstorm with and can be cutthroat with. (Not someone I can trust, because I won’t trust anyone)\nFavorite hobbies: Talking about how much I love the state of N.J., spending time with friends and family, going to the Jersey shore, Italian cards, cooking delicious meals with my boyfriend, growing my herbs (I’m obsessed with them), board games, clamming, and reading.\nPet peeves: Indecisiveness, and mean people.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Finally getting my parents to understand what I do for a living — just kidding, they still don't get it. Taking a big risk to leave my agency job after seven-and-a-half years and betting on myself.\nWhat is something we would never know from looking at you? I went to roller coaster camp as a kid. Yup. You read that right. It’s probably where my adrenaline junkie behavior and risk-taking nature began.\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? My Nonno John and my Nonna Nina are my heroes. They are the most selfless, kind, and hardworking people I know. Everything they've done was for the better of other people, me, and our family: immigrating to America from Italy, each of them working multiple jobs at once to make ends meet all while remaining loving and happy. My grandfather would take the clothes off his back for a complete stranger. My grandmother was an entrepreneur ahead of her time and rose to a real estate maven. They have both taught me the power of believing in myself, serving others, and hard work. I am so grateful for them every day and would honestly love to see them on Survivor — they would kick ass!\nWhy will you be the Sole Survivor? I’ve been practicing and honing my skills my entire life. My successful career in public relations has given me the tools I need to win people over, spin a story, I never take anything personally, and keep going. PR is not for the faint of heart and neither is Survivor. I’m ready to win.\nChrissy Sarnowsky\nAge: 55\nHometown: South Side of Chicago, Ill.\nCurrent residence: South Side of Chicago, Ill.\nOccupation: Fire Lieutenant\nThree words to describe you: Badass, lucky, generous\nWhy do you want to be part of Survivor? Why not? I want to show all the little girls out there they can be firefighters/truck drivers/policemen, etc. Anything they want!\nWhat’s one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Sometimes as a firefighter you are assigned to a new firehouse with new crew. You learn real fast how to size people up. How to deal with different personalities.\nWhich previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I really liked Carolyn. She was herself. And that’s how I intend to play. Be myself! Except maybe lie a little.\nWhat will you value in an alliance partner? Looking for someone I connect with. I know we are all in it to win. But if you have someone that has your back, at least to final five, that would be ideal.\nFavorite hobbies: Working out. I love cardio. But I also like to eat junk food. So it equals out.\nPet peeves: When someone doesn’t wipe off gym equipment and leaves it all sweaty. Gross!\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Probably everything. I grew up poor. Dropped out of high school. So I’m very proud of everything I did. Raise my son/single mom. Firefighter/paramedic. Lieutenant/nurse.\nWhat is something we would never know from looking at you? That I dropped out of high school.\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? Me. I came from nothing. Welfare family. To having a great career. Supporting my son by myself.\nWhy will you be the Sole Survivor? I am doing this for me and my family and friends. I have friends fighting cancer. My mother is getting older. I want to help all of them.\nStar Toomey\nAge: 28\nHometown: Monrovia, Liberia\nCurrent residence: Augusta, Ga.\nOccupation: Sales expert\nThree words to describe you: Hilarious, smooth, laugh-out-loud funny.\nWhy do you want to be part of Survivor? Survivor is the most realest, cutthroat show out there! I want to be a part of Survivor history and I hope one day my son, Silver-Mars, will also compete and chase the Survivor family legacy I am creating.\nWhat’s one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Experiencing the death of my father. I am chasing my dream believing in myself and living and enjoying life as my dad would have wanted. The name of the game is \"no regrets.\"\nWhich previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? I identify most with a mix of Maryanne and Sandra Diaz-Twine. Goofy, but serious. I know how to handle business while also having a good time.\nWhat will you value in an alliance partner? Loyalty and honesty. If I can’t trust my alliance partner even just a little that means we should not be in an alliance.\nFavorite hobbies: Watching TV shows/movies. I think of myself as a TV/movie expert. I know all the hits.\nPet peeves: Teeth grinding, bugs that buzz, Beyonce haters, Harry Potter haters.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? My son Silver-Mars, getting my Master’s degree, and most of all, making it on Survivor 48!\nWhat is something we would never know from looking at you? I am actually really shy and I’m an introvert.\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? I am my biggest inspiration because No. 1, I will never give up on myself and No. 2, I will always want the best for myself, so I cannot lose.\nWhy will you be the Sole Survivor? Because the stars align for Star. This is my game to win! I can’t go back to my wife without the million dollars! She’ll change the locks LOL JK.\nMary Zheng\nAge: 31\nHometown: Montgomery Village, Md.\nCurrent residence: Philadelphia, Pa.\nOccupation: Substance abuse counselor\nThree words to describe you: Chaotic, dynamic, thoughtful\nWhy do you want to be part of Survivor? I’ve done Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, and hitchhiked across the Mediterranean. It’s been awhile since I’ve challenged myself. This game will push you to your limits — emotionally and physically — and I’m dying to be pushed there and then push past it!\nWhat’s one life experience you feel has prepared you for the game? Volunteering at the crisis hotline for years — you have to build trust within minutes, be convincing enough that people who formerly wanted to end their lives don’t want to anymore, and be attuned to the subtitles of human emotion. Plus, you never know who you’re gonna get on the other line, so you need to be ready for surprises.\nWhich previous player do you identify with the most? Who do you think you will play most like? Identify with Ben because although he was pinned as a threat, his relentless game play ensured he was never voted out — the man played like his life depended on it. But I’d also play like Kenzie, who went to every reward, because by nature I’m a social butterfly. I will flit around, providing comfort, care, and laughter to my tribe mates.\nWhat will you value in an alliance partner? The ability to shut off your emotions in favor or what’s best logistically/strategically. I can’t have an alliance partner poppin’ off at someone we need for numbers, thereby potentially alienating them or wanting to vote out a shield just because they want revenge.\nFavorite hobbies: Cycling (read: weaving through traffic during rush hour); making music; tarot; writing; cooking for my loved ones.\nPet peeves: Slow drivers in the left lane; food that you pay for that sucks; inefficiency; being told what to do; people who over-promise and under-deliver.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Learning how to say no to others so that I can say yes to myself.\nWhat is something we would never know from looking at you? I’ve struggled for years with body image and disordered eating, and I’ve put in a lot of work to forge and nurture a healthy relationship with food.\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? Everyone says their parents and I’m no different, except it’s because my parents helped lead the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests for Democracy. Afterwards, my mom escaped house arrest after nine months in jail and my dad evaded the Communists despite a national search for him. They didn’t choose to start a new life in a foreign country — they were forced to seek political asylum, otherwise they’d die. They live their lives with intention and purpose.\nWhy will you be the Sole Survivor? I’m a bundle of contradictions — so I can be whatever I need to be whenever I need to be! I’m chaotic but also careful and controlled. I’m easy-going and can befriend anyone but intense and will be on the whole time (think: Ben searching for idols at all hours). I move through the world with my intuition leading, so I’ll be able to sense any sneaky business or deceitful intentions.\nVula tribe\nLagi tribe\nCiva tribe\nHost Jeff Probst\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.",
