We felt you with us – home, away, and around the world.\nWe’re proud to share that last season, more supporters than ever had the opportunity to be part of our matchdays at Emirates Stadium, Meadow Park, and at away grounds across the UK and Europe. Through a combination of more tickets being available in our ballots, increased utilisation of Ticket Exchange and Ticket Transfer, and action to combat touting, we’ve significantly increased the availability of tickets to our matches.\nThis coming season, we’ll continue our drive to put more tickets in the hands of our supporters and create an electric atmosphere and winning connection between our supporters and teams that supports our ambition to win major trophies.\nImproving access for our members\nThe ballot system for men's home matches helps ensure wider access to tickets. It offers Silver and Red members a fairer way to register before a set deadline, without needing to queue online at a specific time.\nAcross the 2024/25 season, we were pleased to see significant increases in the average number of tickets balloted per match, the number of tickets allocated via our ballot year-on-year, the average number of balloted tickets accessed by Red Members per game, and utilisation of Ticket Exchange and Ticket Transfer.\nMEN’S TICKETING HIGHLIGHTS\n- 85% rise in the number of tickets allocated via our men’s ballot, from 197,000 in 2023/24 to 365,000 in 2024/25\n- 54% rise in the average number of balloted tickets per game, from 7,900 to 12,200 across all competitions\n- 68% rise in the average number of tickets accessed by Red Members per match, from 3,300 to 5,600\n- 7% rise in the number of members who applied to at least one ballot and were successful at least once\n- 0: the number of members who applied to all 30 ballots and were not successful once, down from six in 2023/24\n- 64% rise in the number of Ticket Exchange transactions, up to 167,000 from 102,000\n- 24% increase in the number of tickets accessed via Ticket Transfer, from 303,000 to 377,000\n- 5,800: the average number of tickets purchased via Ticket Exchange for Premier League fixtures\n- 9,000 Disability Access tickets made available to members via the ballot, Ticket Exchange or Ticket Transfer across the season\nProtecting our supporters against touting\nAs part of our commitment to ensuring tickets go to our members, we continue to combat bots and touts:\n- 31,401 suspicious entries were removed from ballots in 2024/25\n- Stronger enforcement of bans and sanctions against touting was implemented, including enhanced matchday collections and specialist third-party operatives on the ground\n- We began transitioning away from PDF tickets as part of our move to a fully digital ticketing system, helping to combat unauthorised resale and improve ticket security\nArsenal Women highlights\nWe continue to see exceptional demand for Arsenal Women matches with more than 415,000 tickets sold across 2024/25, up 20% on the previous season.\nTogether with our supporters, we also achieved:\nNine sold-out allocations for women’s away fixtures, across domestic and European competitions\n- A boost to the Emirates Stadium matchday experience through ‘Bring the Noise’ and ‘Bring the Family’ areas\n- A WSL attendance record for 2024/25 of 56,784 for the north London derby\n- An average WSL Emirates Stadium attendance of 34,410\nWe are excited to build on the momentum of our Women’s Champions League triumph as we continue to drive women’s football forward. Next season we’re proud to be hosting all 11 WSL matches at Emirates Stadium - find out more and get your tickets\nDuring the 2025/26 season, we will also be part of a WSL-led pilot that will allow alcohol to be consumed in seats in certain parts of Emirates Stadium.\nLOOKING AHEAD\nNew cup final policy\nWe are making further changes to our men’s cup final ticket policy to simplify the criteria and reward loyalty throughout the season.\nThe new criteria will give higher priority to season ticket holders and members who have travelled to support the team home and away in the relevant competition. These upcoming changes reflect feedback from supporters, including our Ticketing Forum - find out more.\nMaintaining access for concessions\nWe want to ensure our matches are accessible and next season we’re maintaining concessions in all General Admission areas of Emirates Stadium for Junior Gunners and Cannon members (under-18s), Young Adults (19-24), Seniors (66+) and Disability Access Members.\nAll General Admission season ticket holders for Junior Gunners and Cannon members will receive a 50% discount regardless of where they sit at Emirates Stadium. Young Adult season ticket holders will continue to receive a 25% discount in all General Admission areas.\nSenior citizen season ticket holders who previously sat in the Family Enclosure will keep their concession at the discount rate of 57%. There will continue to be an allocation of match-by-match tickets available to seniors – supporters aged 66+ will be able to apply for these tickets at a 25% discount via the ballot.\n1,000 tickets for our community\nAs we celebrate 40 years of Arsenal in the Community, we are ensuring our men’s matches remain accessible for our local community by making 1,000 tickets available free of charge across the 2025/26 season.\nArsenal in the Community will ensure these tickets go to local supporters who connect with us through our education and employment, social inclusion, and sport, health and wellbeing programmes.\nIntroducing Ticket Hub\nThe Ticket Hub is our new platform for managing tickets. Whether supporters are transferring a ticket, managing their network or downloading their digital pass, the Ticket Hub brings everything together in one place.\nAccessible through supporters’ Arsenal accounts via our app and website, the Ticket Hub is designed to provide more flexibility and a smoother user experience when it comes to matchday tickets. If you are a member or season ticket holder, we encourage you to familiarise yourself with the Ticket Hub ahead of the 2025/26 season.\nFor more support and to read the full step-by-step guide, visit the Help Centre or browse our updated Ticket Transfer Guide on the website.\nContinuing our engagement\nNext season, we’ll continue our engagement with our Ticketing Forum and Arsenal Advisory Board. We look forward to continuing our drive to put tickets in the hands of our members.\nFrom season 2025/26, further to our announcement in March 2025, we’ll be introducing the following changes:\n- A new Away Ticket Exchange, replacing the current transfer model, to ensure as many away tickets as possible are used\n- Ongoing testing of a Disability Access Ticket Exchange\n- We’ll replace My Arsenal Rewards, giving all members the opportunity to earn Arsenal experiences, enter ticket prize draws, merchandise giveaways, and other exciting rewards\nOur Managing Director, Richard Garlick, said: “Thank you to all our supporters for their incredible support for both our men’s and women’s teams throughout the 2024/25 season. It is fantastic to see such sustained demand for tickets.\n\"Our goal remains clear: to give as many supporters as possible the opportunity to attend matches, creating an electric atmosphere and a winning connection between our supporters and teams.\n“We’re proud to see our community growing around our women’s team too. After an incredible end to the 2024/25 season in Lisbon, we know our supporters will continue bringing energy next season – home and away. We can’t wait to welcome even more supporters to Emirates Stadium for all 11 WSL fixtures in 2025/26.\n“I’d like to thank the members of our Ticketing Forum and Arsenal Advisory Board for their engagement on this important topic throughout the year.\"\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
