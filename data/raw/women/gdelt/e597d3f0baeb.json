Russo scored twice in the match but it was her second goal that was chosen as one of the WSL’s standout goals in April.\nCast your vote for Russo’s strike here.\nBeth Mead has had a long road back to recovery, since rupturing her ACL in November 2022. Beth returned to the pitch for our Gunners this season.

Never having won a game away at Man City Women, our Gunners may have an uphill battle against the very in-form Cityzens, but with if our Gunners can make their chances count we could still steal 2nd place in the WSL from Chelsea!\nMan City v Arsenal Women, Joie Stadium. kick-off 14:15 UK, live on BBC1, BBC iPlayer and the BBCSport website.\nCOYGW!\nMichelle M\nFollow JustArsenal’s Gooner Women on Just Gooner Women on Twitter for regular updates on the Arsenal Womens Team!\nDo you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team?
