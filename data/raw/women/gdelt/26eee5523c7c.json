Welcome to AM. It's Friday the 9th of May. I'm Rachel Mealey coming to you from the lands of the Turrbal and Yugera people in Brisbane.\nThe world has a new pope and for the first time he's an American. Robert Francis Prevost has been elected pope after a two-day conclave of cardinals. He's chosen the name Leo XIV. Europe correspondent Elias Clure was in the crowd in St Peter's Square when it happened.\nElias Clure: In the air, white smoke pours from the Sistine Chapel's chimney. On the ground, applause and cheers erupt from thousands in the waiting crowd. Some jumped for joy while others cried and prayed to the sky as they celebrated the election of a new pope.\nTourist 1: To be here and see the history unfold, it's huge.\nTourist 2: The chances are so slim that you'd be there for that moment and it was wonderful. We hugged one another immediately. I just felt, I felt we won the lotto.\nTourist 3: I love it, I love it.\nElias Clure: The images were beamed around the world to millions watching live broadcasts.\nNews Report: Smoke billowing out of the Sistine Chapel chimney. This is breaking news. We have a new Pope. The Sistine Chapel chimney has signalled white smoke at eight minutes past five this evening.\nElias Clure: The white smoke signalled one cardinal had managed to secure at least 89 votes among the 133 cardinals participating in the conclave. An hour later, the world learned who that winner was.\nElias Clure: We have a new Pope, the Latin announcement said, before the victor emerged on the balcony of St Peter's Basilica. The 267th leader of the Roman Catholic Church is Robert Francis Prevost from the United States. He's chosen the papal name Leo XIV.\nPope Leo XIV: La pace sia con tutti voi. Fratelli, sorelle, carissimi. Peace be with you all. Dear brothers and sisters, this is the first greeting of the risen Christ, the Good Shepherd who gave His life for the flock of God. I too would like this greeting of peace to enter your hearts, to reach your families, to all people everywhere, to all the earth. Peace be with you.\nElias Clure: The election of Pope Leo, the first pontiff from the US, came after three rounds of voting.\nPope Leo XIV: We must seek together now how to be a missionary church, a church that builds bridges and dialogue, one that's open to receive as this square with open arms to all who need our charity, our presence, dialogue and love.\nElias Clure: The previous Pope, Francis, died last month after ruling the 1.4 billion member church for 12 years. Now a new era with a new leader at the helm.\nRachel Mealey: Elias Clure there in Rome.\nAnd Elias joined me a short time ago from St Peters Square. Elias, tell us about the atmosphere there today. Firstly, when that white smoke rose from the chimney.\nElias Clure: Well it was quite extraordinary. All eyes had been fixed on that little chimney above the Sistine Chapel for almost two days. And just started at 6:09pm that white smoke billowed from that little flue and the reaction from the crowd was one of shock. I don't think people expected it to come so soon. But it did and then this huge roar when through the Vatican. It was quite extraordinary to witness it. Then for about an hour, people didn't know who it was but at that time Robert Provost had been congratulated by the 132 other voting cardinals. He was fitted in his papal robes and into the Room of Tears where he's supposedly supposed to feel the weight of responsibility that's been bestowed upon him. And then he came onto that iconic closure at St Peters and greeted tens of thousands of people who roared when they heard those ancient words - we have a new pope. People here really had a sense that they were part of history. And Elias, what do we know about the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church?\nRachel Mealey: And Elias, what do we know about the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church?\nElias Clure: We know he comes from the Augustinian side of the church. He’s a 69-year-old American. A missionary. He moved to Peru when he was 30. He’s now a very senior member of the Curia, the Vatican’s Administration. He was a close confidant of Pope Francis and this is seen as many Vatican insiders as continuity. Continuing the legacy of Pope Francis who was seen as a more progressive pope. It’s known that Pope Leo is a progressive on some issues, perhaps more conservative on others. But interestingly, just before the conclave began, the College of Cardinals met and released a statement that they were looking to continue the reforms, the more progressive reforms of Pope Francis. And this is perhaps a clear indication that they intended to do.\nRachel Mealey: Elias Clure there in St Peters Square.\nFrank Brennan is a Catholic priest, author and academic. I spoke to him earlier. Father Frank Brennan, what are your thoughts on the appointment of Pope Leo this morning?\nFather Frank Brennan: I was surprised that it had been done so quickly. I must say I thought that given that there were 133 cardinals, many of whom didn't know each other, the fact that this is one of the fastest conclaves, or is the fastest of the century, I think indicates to me that his fellow cardinals must have seen him as an absolute standout, someone who has the necessary experience of north and south, someone who's got the right balance between church order and missionary pastoral outreach. I was very surprised that they went for an American, but this of course is an American who has a very profound international experience, and he made it very clear in his opening remarks that his heart was with his diocese back in Peru, not so much in Chicago.\nRachel Mealey: The new Pope has chosen the name Leo. Can we read anything into that?\nFather Frank Brennan: We can read a lot into that. His predecessor, Leo XIII, was an extraordinary Pope. At the end of the 19th century, he issued one of the all-time great social encyclicals, as they're called, called Rerum Novarum, and it spoke about the rights of the worker, it spoke about private property, it spoke about the role of the state, and it enunciated very strongly that the poor had to be protected. So I think to have someone choosing the name Leo XIV is a very clear indication that there will be a strong commitment to social justice.\nRachel Mealey: He's said to be a reformer. What does that mean in the Catholic Church in 2025?\nFather Frank Brennan: Well, that would work on a number of different levels, Rachel, and I don't know whether that would be altogether the single title that you would give him. What you have to understand about him is that he has spent many years in Peru as a bishop, so even though he came from Chicago in the United States, he worked among the poor in very difficult circumstances, but he was then the boss of the Augustinian Order, of which he is a member, and he did that for two stints in Rome, two six-year terms, and after that he was then made a bishop and ultimately was put in charge of the Commission for the Choosing of New Bishops. So that doesn't necessarily add up to being a reformer. What it does add up to, I think, is being someone who's very accomplished at church governance across cultural domains and in dealing with very difficult issues and in being able to bring his experience from Peru direct to Rome.\nRachel Mealey: What do we know about where he stands on some of the doctrinal issues like the ordination of women as deacons or the recognition of gay Catholics?\nFather Frank Brennan: He's thought to be fairly conservative on those questions. We don't have definitive statements, but one thing to remember about him is he did his doctoral degree in canon law and he did it at the Pontifical College of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome. Now that's always been seen to be a fairly conservative institution and someone who's done a doctorate in canon law is likely to have more an eye to church tradition on these sorts of questions. So I don't think we'll get the same sort of fuzzy or loose statements that we occasionally got from Pope Francis. I think he'll be fairly measured and precise. Having said that, the message that he gave when he came out and addressed the crowd there in Rome last night, he did end by greeting the Church of Rome and saying that we need to be a missionary church, a church that builds bridges, dialogue, always open to receive like this square with open arms, everyone, everyone who needs our charity, our presence, dialogue and love. So with a concluding statement like that, Rachel, I say there is hope, but be careful that he will be one who's far more measured than Pope Francis has been on those sorts of questions.\nRachel Mealey: When it comes to popes, he's a relatively young man at 69. Might we see him travel a bit more than the previous pope and perhaps visit Australia?\nFather Frank Brennan: Well, I think he's more than likely to do a fair bit of travel. Mind you, Francis did a fair bit in his time, but given that this man is well used to life in countries like Peru as well as the United States, and given that he spent 12 years as the boss of the Augustinian order, bear in mind there are about 3,000 Augustinians all around the world. So he would be well used to travelling internationally. Now, whether or not he'd have Australia at the top of his pops, I'm not so sure about that, although I'm sure there'll be Australians representing to him that Australia missed out during the last pontificate, so it might be time. And there are, of course, Augustinians here in Australia. They run two very good schools, one at Villanova here in Brisbane, one at St Augustine's in Sydney. They've got seven or eight parishes, and there is an Australian on their leadership team in Rome, so maybe he'll be able to put in a good word for Australia.\nRachel Mealey: Father Frank Brennan, thanks for joining AM.\nFather Frank Brennan: Thank you. Good to be with you.\nRachel Mealey: Labor figures have lashed the decision by the party's right faction to dump Mark Dreyfus and Ed Husic from their ministerial roles. The surprise shake-up was just one part of a wild day in Australian politics. Political reporter Evelyn Manfield reports.\nEvelyn Manfield: Tension in the halls of Parliament as Labor's factions meet to put forward the names of who should be a minister. As she left for the night, Victorian Senator Jess Walsh had been picked for elevation.\nJess Walsh: I don't have any comment. It's all very fresh. I don't have any comment and it hasn't been confirmed by the caucus.\nEvelyn Manfield: New South Wales Senator Tim Ayres too.\nTim Ayres: I'm good, thank you, but I'll talk to you all a bit later on.\nEvelyn Manfield: The pair take the spots of Bill Shorten, who headed up the NDIS, and Stephen Jones, the former assistant treasurer, following their retirement. They'll join Victorians Sam Rae and Daniel Mulino, who've knocked out Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic and Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus from the ministry. Former PM Paul Keating calls it a showing of poor judgment, unfairness and diminished respect for the contribution of others, adding that Mr Husic was the only Muslim member of Cabinet and Mr Dreyfus was a significant Jewish member. Their departure is likely to lead to a broader shuffling of portfolios. Murray Watt is the employment minister.\nMurray Watt: Obviously it's now a decision with the Prime Minister what he'd like to do in terms of portfolios.\nEvelyn Manfield: But it's not just Labor making changes. NT Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price has decided to move from the Nationals party room to the Liberals, giving her reasons on Sky News.\nJacinta Nampijinpa Price: The Liberal party room is my natural home, given the Liberal party is the freedom party, the party of responsibility. Given the current circumstances, I think now more than ever, we need strong people within the Liberal party. We need to be able to rebuild.\nEvelyn Manfield: Nationals Senator Matt Canavan says she's put her own ambition over the will of the voters and that's exactly why people are sick of politicians. He spoke to Sky News.\nMatt Canavan: It's like changing teams on the football field after the whistle has blown. It's not the sort of behaviour I think Australians appreciate.\nEvelyn Manfield: Nationals MP Anne Webster is more circumspect but admits it's still a blow.\nAnne Webster: It's a surprise, of course, and of course I'm disappointed. However, I do wish her all the best as she takes up whatever roles she is given in the Liberal party.\nEvelyn Manfield: Party leader David Littleproud is disappointed too, but says he appreciates she's got ambitions beyond the possibilities of the Nationals. While Liberal James Paterson has welcomed her into the fold.\nJames Paterson: I think you'll get to see Jacinta in a different mould in this new parliament. Whatever roles she takes up in the Liberal party, I think she'll broaden her interest in other policy areas and I think she'll make a really big impact and cut through.\nEvelyn Manfield: The move by Senator Price allows her to join Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor's team as he's expected to bid for the party's leadership against acting leader Susan Ley. Both the Liberals and the Greens need to find new leaders after Peter Dutton and Adam Bandt were voted out of office. But as some officers get packed up, others are starting fresh.\nReporter: Congratulations, how are you feeling?\nAli France: Um, great. It's my first day here and it's been so exciting.\nEvelyn Manfield: Labor's Ali France, who beat Peter Dutton, one of the new faces of the new parliament.\nRachel Mealey: Evelyn Manfield reporting.\nTensions between India and Pakistan have deepened further overnight, with both countries launching fresh strikes and provoking escalation. South Asia Bureau Chief Meghna Bali reports from New Delhi.\nMeghna Bali: In the border town of Poonch in Jammu and Kashmir, a family gathers around a burning This is the funeral of 51-year-old Amar Singh. His sister Kawaljot Kaur, inconsolable, as friends and neighbours surround the fire to perform his last rites.\nKawaljot Kaur: My brother was standing in our veranda when the bomb hit. It's a huge loss for our family. We still can't believe this happened to us. We're terrified.\nMeghna Bali: Amar was one of 16 people killed this week in Pakistani shelling across India's Kashmir border, among them five children and three women.\nKawaljot Kaur: I'm feeling very strange. I feel very bad. I never thought this would happen to us. I'm speechless.\nMeghna Bali: It's estimated that most of Poonch's 40,000 residents have now fled. Across the de facto border in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, officials say the toll is even higher. At least 31 civilians were killed in Indian missile strikes, attacks India's Defence Minister Rajnath Singh says were only aimed at terrorist infrastructure.\nRajnath Singh: The Indian Armed Forces took action with precision, alertness and sensitiveness. Our armed forces also showed sensitivity in ensuring that the civilian population is not affected at all.\nMeghna Bali: The escalation follows a deadly militant attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir two weeks ago, where 26 people, mostly Hindu tourists, were killed. India blames Pakistan-based terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba. Pakistan denies any role. Pakistan quickly retaliated. It claims to have downed five Indian jets, dozens of drones and targeted Indian military assets. Indian Foreign Affairs Minister S Jaishankar insists they want to pull back.\nS Jaishankar: Our response was targeted and measured. It is not our intention to escalate the situation.\nMeghna Bali: Pakistan's Defence Minister, Khawaja Asif, said to Bloomberg If India backs down, we will wrap up these tensions. But on the ground, it already feels like war.\nKhawaja Asif: I want to tell the government war should not happen. Both countries should sit together to resolve issues. War is not the answer. Common people are getting impacted because of it.\nMeghna Bali: For Kawaljot Kaur and dozens of others now grieving on both sides of the border, it doesn't matter who fired first. This is Meghna Bali reporting for AM.\nRachel Mealey: US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer have unveiled the framework of a trade deal between their two nations. Our North America correspondent, Kamin Gock, has been following developments. Kamin, what are the details of this deal?\nKamin Gock: Well, both leaders are spruiking this as a win-win agreement, but much of this deal still needs to be negotiated. What we do know is the US will scrap its steep aluminium and steel tariffs of 25% for the United Kingdom. It will slash automobile tariffs down to 10% for the UK. That's good for famous British car companies like Rolls-Royce. And the UK will scrap tariffs on US ethanol and will allow some American beef into the country under this reciprocal market share agreement, meaning both sides can now enter one another's markets. But notably, Donald Trump's Liberation Day tariffs, he slapped on the UK of 10% for almost all of its imported goods, will remain in place.\nRachel Mealey: So Kamin, where does this leave negotiations for a possible trade deal between Australia and the US?\nKamin Gock: Yeah, it puts Australia in an interesting position because ideally Australia would want that 10% base rate tariff scrapped altogether, which has been implemented on Australia as well. But Donald Trump flagged today in a press conference that that 10% base rate is probably the lowest it will go. Now, Australia's ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, has been repeatedly talking up our country's critical minerals and our ability to potentially be a partner with the US. The United States wants its beef into our country, but we also have very strict biosecurity measures. And the social media ban for under 16 year olds that was recently announced will also likely be a point of discussion between the two countries, as now negotiations can ramp up since the election has passed.\nRachel Mealey: North America correspondent Kamin Gock.\nAnd that's AM for today. Thanks for your company. I'm Rachel Mealey.",
