However the designated racecourse, set closer to the club's waterfront, promises steady afternoon breezes, flat water, and tight tactical racing - ideal for this high-speed foil discipline. It's a contrast to the high-altitude mountain lake of Silvaplana, Switzerland, where riders last competed.\nRising stars eye the podium\nSilvaplana saw a breakout event for several emerging names, many of whom are now gunning not just for race wins but for overall World Cup titles. In the women's fleet, 15-year-old French prodigy Vaina Picot was the talk of the paddock after finishing third in qualifying and pushing the leaders. Can she go one step further in Istanbul? Keep an eye, too, on Anaïs Mai Desjardins (FRA) currently 4th in the overall standings and Greece's Emilia Kosti, who is steadily gaining ground on the tour.\nThe ones to beat: Spanu and Ghio\nItaly's Maddalena Maria Spanu, the reigning women's World Cup champion, has won both World Cup events this year, but showed signs of vulnerability in Silvaplana, dropping several races. Travelling solo for the first time without her parents, the 18-year-old has had to battle homesickness along with a hungry field. Even so, her ability to bounce back and reclaim her form proved why she's the woman to beat in Istanbul.\nIn the men's fleet, Mathis Ghio [FRA] continues to lead the charge. Despite some close calls in Switzerland, he displayed his trademark calm under pressure to seal another overall win. But the gap is narrowing.\nPoland's Kamil Manowiecki sits just eight points behind Ghio in the standings, while Italy's Francesco Cappuzzo and France's Julien Rattotti remain within striking distance. But perhaps the biggest shift in momentum came from Freddie Strawson [GBR]. The 28-year-old from Lincolnshire turned heads in Switzerland by winning his first-ever World Cup race and making the final for the first time — a breakthrough that could see him become a disrutper.\nAlso on the rise is Nicolo Spanu [ITA], brother of Maddalena, who is part of a growing Italian wave challenging Ghio's reign at the top.\nLooking ahead\nIstanbul marks the mid-point of the World Cup season. For the likes of Spanu and Ghio, it's a chance to consolidate their leads. For the rising stars like Picot and Strawson, it's a golden opportunity to prove that Switzerland wasn't a one-off.\nLet the racing begin!.\nThe excitement kicks off on 13 August with thrilling Long Distance races, followed by a week of intense short-track showdowns. The action reaches its grand finale on Sunday 17 August, with the highly anticipated medal series, where champions will be crowned. Fans can follow every moment of the AUDI 2025 WingFoil Racing World Cup Turkiye in real-time, as races will be tracked live, with updates and insights shared across all official IWSA channels.\nFull results and more information\nRelated Articles\nWingFoil Racing World Cup Hong Kong overallThe season's first champions crowned Hong Kong delivered another brutally demanding day of racing as shifting winds pushed the world's best riders to their limits at the opening World Cup of the season.
