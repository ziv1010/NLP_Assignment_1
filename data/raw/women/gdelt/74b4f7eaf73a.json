Shareholder proposals\n|\nAGAINST\n|\n31\n|\n(each proposal)\n| | | | | | | |\nTo express our appreciation for your participation, Amazon will make a $1 charitable donation to Feeding America on behalf of every shareholder account that votes.\nShareholder Engagement (Since Beginning of 2023)\nEngaged\n|\nDirector participation\n|\n68 of our 100\n|\nshareholders owning\n|\nlargest unaffiliated shareholders\n|\nmore than 31% of our stock |\nBoard of Directors\n-\nWe have the appropriate mix of skills, qualifications, backgrounds, and tenures on the Board to support and help drive the Company's long-term performance.\n-\nOur director nominees reflect our commitment to diversity, with four women and three directors from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups.\n- The Board actively oversees our numerous environmental, sustainability, social, and corporate governance policies and initiatives, receives periodic reports on and discusses our enterprise risk assessments, oversees and receives regular reports on our regulatory compliance, and reviews shareholder feedback on these topics as we evolve our practices and disclosures.\nCorporate Governance Highlights\n-\nWe have a single class of common stock with equal voting rights, such that one share equals one vote.\n- We have a declassified board, meaning all of our directors are elected annually.\n-\nWe have a majority voting standard for the election of directors whenever the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected.\n- We have a lead independent director appointed by the independent directors to promote independent leadership of the Board.\n- We have robust stock ownership guidelines for our directors.\n- We engage year-roundwith our shareholders and other stakeholders, and our lead director and other independent directors periodically meet with our large and long-term shareholders.\n- Our Board has significant interaction with and access to senior management and other employees.\n- Our Board and the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee annually review executive succession planning.\n- Our Board and individual directors conduct annual peer performance evaluations.\n- We prohibit hedging, speculative, and derivative security transactions by directors, executive officers, and other senior employees.\n- Shareholders owning at least 25% of our outstanding shares have the right to call a special meeting of the shareholders.\n- Shareholders have a proxy access right on market-standard terms.\nExecutive Compensation Overview\n-\nOur executive compensation philosophy focuses on the true long-term success of our business, not on isolated one-, two-,or three-yeargoals that encompass only a limited and selective portion of our objectives and that can reward executives with above-targetpayouts even when the stock price remains flat or declines.\n-\nFollowing our 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, at which more than 68% of the votes cast supported our advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, we engaged in extensive outreach to our shareholders, with the Chair of the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee and/or our Lead Independent Director holding one-on-one or small group meetings with most of our 20 largest shareholders.\n- The Committee did not grant any equity awards to our CEO or any of our named executives during 2023, and our Compensation Discussion and Analysis addresses other matters with respect to our named executives' compensation.\n-\nOur compensation philosophy is anchored on periodic grants of time-vested restricted stock units that vest over the long term, which strongly aligns our executives' compensation with the returns we deliver to shareholders. For example, due to our stock price performance over the course of 2023, our CEO's 2023 realized compensation decreased by 12% from 2022, showing the alignment between our executive compensation program and our shareholder returns.\n- Having considered other approaches to structuring executive compensation arrangements, we remain committed to the structure of our executive compensation because it has worked effectively, having allowed us to:\n- attract and retain incredibly talented people who have guided our business through countless challenges;\n-\ndevelop our business in ways that we could not have conceived a few years earlier, including initiatives that later became AWS, Kindle, Alexa, Fulfillment by Amazon, Marketplace, and Prime Video;\n-\nmake long-term commitments to sustainability and other environmental, social, and human capital initiatives and goals; and\n- drive strong long-term returns to our shareholders.\nShareholder Proposals and Vote Recommendations\n|\nBoard of Directors\n|\nPage\n|\nProposal:\n|\nRecommendation:\n|\nReference:\n| | | |\n4 Shareholder Proposal Requesting an Additional Board\n|\nAGAINST\n|\n33\n|\nCommittee to Oversee Public Policy\n| | |\n- Our current Board and committee structure already provides an appropriate level of oversight. For example, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing and monitoring the Company's policies and initiatives relating to our environmental, sustainability, and corporate social responsibility practices, and regularly reviews Amazon's public policy, government relations, and public relations initiatives. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing our policies, procedures, and reports with respect to political contributions and lobbying expenses.\n|\nBoard of Directors\n|\nPage\n|\nProposal:\n|\nRecommendation:\n|\nReference:\n| | | |\n5 Shareholder Proposal Requesting an Additional Board\n|\nAGAINST\n|\n35\n|\nCommittee to Oversee the Financial Impact of Policy Positions\n| | |\n- Our current Board and committee structure already provides an appropriate level of oversight. For example, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing and monitoring the Company's policies and initiatives relating to our corporate social responsibility practices, and regularly reviews the Company's public policy, government relations, and public relations initiatives. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing our policies, procedures, and reports with respect to political contributions and lobbying expenses.\n6 Shareholder Proposal Requesting a Report on Customer Due\n|\nAGAINST\n|\n37\n|\nDiligence\n| | |\n- For the fifth year in a row, this proposal continues to rely on the same speculative and outdated concerns and mischaracterizations. The proposal also fails to take into account the fact that we have been updating our technology and enhancing safeguards; that we have avoided or mitigated the risks and concerns posited in this proposal; and that AWS has never received a single verified report of Amazon Rekognition being used in the harmful manner posited in the proposal.\n-\nOur Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has specifically reviewed Amazon Rekognition's facial recognition capabilities and Ring, focusing on the actual operation and use of Amazon Rekognition and Ring, the potential concerns and misuse that could arise from these technologies, and our actions to resolve or mitigate those risks and concerns.\n-\nWe have been consistent and proactive in our efforts to address concerns and mitigate the risk of misuse through policy and advocacy efforts, product development processes, customer contractual requirements and training, consultation with third party experts, and other policies and practices.\n7 Shareholder Proposal Requesting Additional Reporting on\n|\nAGAINST\n|\n43\n|\nLobbying\n| | |\n- We report comprehensively and transparently on our public policy expenditures on an annual basis, including direct and indirect lobbying expenditures.\n-\nIn addition, we have Board and management processes in place to provide oversight of our public policy activities, and take a number of actions to mitigate the potential risk associated with misalignment between our views and the lobbying activities undertaken by organizations we support.\n-\nIt is unrealistic to expect that we will agree with every single policy position taken by every organization to which we contribute. We believe that remaining engaged with such organizations despite differing views on a particular matter has value and can influence the organization's positions over time.\n|\nBoard of Directors\n|\nPage\n|\nProposal:\n|\nRecommendation:\n|\nReference:\n| | | |\n8 Shareholder Proposal Requesting Additional Reporting on\n|\nAGAINST\n|\n47\n|\nGender/Racial Pay\n| | |\n- Amazon already provides disclosure on compensation by gender and by race/ethnicity. When evaluating 2023 compensation in the United States, including base compensation, cash bonuses, and stock, our reported data demonstrates that women globally and in the United States earned 99.8 cents and 99.9 cents, respectively, for every dollar that men earned performing the same jobs, and racial/ethnic minorities in the United States earned a dollar for every dollar that white employees earned performing the same jobs.\n9 Shareholder Proposal Requesting a Report on Viewpoint\n|\nAGAINST\n|\n51\n|\nRestriction\n| | |\n- We keep in mind the cultural differences and sensitivities of our global community when making decisions on products, and as a store, we've chosen to offer a very broad range of viewpoints. We strive to maximize selection for all customers, even if we do not agree with the message or sentiment of all of the products.\n-\nWe have risk management processes to protect against risks to the Company. For example, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees and monitors our policies and initiatives relating to corporate social responsibility, including human rights and ethical business practices, and related risks most relevant to the Company's operations and engagement with customers, suppliers, and communities.\n10 Shareholder Proposal Requesting Additional Reporting on\n|\nAGAINST\n|\n53\n|\nStakeholder Impacts\n| | |\n- As we work toward reaching our climate goals, we are also committed to the people, workers, and communities that support our entire value chain so that they are treated with fundamental dignity and respect. At Amazon, we use our infrastructure, resources, and spirit of invention to address some of the most acute challenges in our communities, as detailed in our annual sustainability report.\n-\nIn addition, as the world's largest corporate renewable energy purchaser for the fourth year in a row, we have a unique role to play in supporting a just, equitable, and sustainable energy transition. For example, we are a founding member of Beyond the Megawatt, an initiative of the Clean Energy Buyers Institute to maximize the environmental and social benefits of the clean energy transition.\n-\nWe believe all employees should have the opportunity to learn new skills, grow, and build their careers as they develop their professional journeys and prepare for economies of the future. We offer programs like Upskilling 2025 and Amazon Career Choice and help to create pathways to careers in fields that will continue growing in the years to come.\n|\nBoard of Directors\n|\nPage\n|\nProposal:\n|\nRecommendation:\n|\nReference:\n| | | |\n11 Shareholder Proposal Requesting a Report on Packaging\n|\nAGAINST\n|\n57\n|\nMaterials\n| | |\n- We recognize the importance of reducing plastic waste and already publicly report on the amount of single-use plastic being used across our global operations network to ship orders to customers.\n- In 2022, the total metric tons of single-use plastic we used across our global operations network to ship orders to customers decreased by 11.6% from 2021. In addition, in 2022, we shipped 11% of our orders globally without any additional Amazon packaging.\n- We have innovated and invested in technologies, processes, and materials that since 2015 have helped reduce the weight of the packaging per shipment by 41% on average and avoided more than 2 million tons of packaging material.\n12 Shareholder Proposal Requesting Additional Reporting on\n|\nAGAINST\n|\n61\n|\nFreedom of Association\n| | |\n- While citing no compelling new developments in its supporting statement, the proponent continues to request for the second year in a row a third-party assessment that is unnecessary in light of our policies and practices respecting freedom of association and collective bargaining rights and the regulatory oversight of these policies and practices that already exists in the United States and elsewhere.\n- We respect the rights of our employees to form, join, or not to join a labor union or other lawful organization of their own selection, without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment, and our policies and practices protect these rights.\n-\nIn our engagement with the proponent, the proponent revealed the true intent behind this proposal, which is the promotion of \"neutrality\" agreements and a commitment by Amazon to non-engagement with our employees. This would undermine the open lines of communication between leadership and employees that help us address employee concerns and make improvements, which would deny individuals their right to make informed decisions by permitting only a union's point of view to be presented.\n13 Shareholder Proposal Requesting Alternative Emissions\n|\nAGAINST\n|\n65\n|\nReporting\n| | |\n- We annually report both our absolute carbon emissions and carbon intensity and are transparent about the methodology behind each of the emissions models we have built to measure Amazon's carbon footprint.\n-\nWe follow guidance from the GHG Protocol's Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard in calculating our greenhouse gas emissions (including Scope 3 emissions), and these are assured by independent third parties.\n-\nOur carbon intensity has decreased by 24% from 2019 to 2022.\n|\nBoard of Directors\n|\nPage\n|\nProposal:\n|\nRecommendation:\n|\nReference:\n| | | |\n14 Shareholder Proposal Requesting a Report on Customer Use of\n|\nAGAINST\n|\n67\n|\nCertain Technologies\n| | |\n- For the sixth year in a row, this proposal continues to rely on the same speculative and outdated concerns and mischaracterizations and fails to take into account the fact that we have been updating our technology and enhancing safeguards and have avoided or mitigated the risks and concerns expressed in this proposal and that AWS has never received a single verified report of Amazon Rekognition being used in the harmful manner posited in the proposal.\n-\nOur Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has specifically reviewed Amazon Rekognition's facial recognition capabilities, focusing on the actual operation and use of Amazon Rekognition, the potential concerns and misuse that could arise from these technologies, and our actions to resolve or mitigate those risks and concerns.\n-\nWe have been consistent and proactive in our efforts to address concerns and mitigate the risk of misuse through policy and advocacy efforts, product development processes, customer contractual requirements and training, consultation with third party experts, and other policies and practices.\n15 Shareholder Proposal Requesting a Policy to Disclose Directors'\n|\nAGAINST\n|\n72\n|\nPolitical and Charitable Donations\n| | |\n- Our processes for nominating directors are designed to advance the long-term interests of shareholders by creating a Board with deep business acumen that reflects a diversity of experience and perspectives.\n- Director nominees' personal charitable and political giving does not reflect how the Board manages and oversees the Company. Under Delaware corporate law, our Board has fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to our shareholders and must act in our shareholders' best interest.\n16 Shareholder Proposal Requesting an Additional Board\n|\nAGAINST\n|\n75\n|\nCommittee to Oversee Artificial Intelligence\n| | |\n- Amazon is committed to, and is a leader in, the responsible development and use of AI.\n-\nOur Board and Board committees are already overseeing human rights and other risks associated with artificial intelligence and machine learning, including emerging technologies like generative artificial intelligence, foundation models, and artificial general intelligence.\n-\nNone of our peer companies has a board committee dedicated solely to risks arising from AI.\n|\nBoard of Directors\n|\nPage\n|\nProposal:\n|\nRecommendation:\n|\nReference:\n| | | |\n17 Shareholder Proposal Requesting a Report on Warehouse\n|\nAGAINST\n|\n78\n|\nWorking Conditions\n| | |\n- The audit requested by this proposal would be duplicative because we have already publicly disclosed our workforce incident rates compared with industry data and we are already subject to extensive regulatory oversight and review. Our goal is to be the safest workplace within the industries in which we operate.\n-\nFrom 2019 to 2023, our worldwide lost time incident rate improved by 60% and our worldwide recordable incident rate improved by 30%. From 2022 to 2023, our worldwide lost time incident rate improved by 16% and our worldwide recordable incident rate improved by 8%.\n-\nThe proposal's claims that our injury rates are significantly higher than the industry average are incorrect and, in contrast to what this proposal suggests, we do not require employees to meet specific productivity quotas.\nGlobal Impact Highlights\nOur Customers\nWe obsess over how to make customers' lives better and easier every day with new and improved products and services. This is true for consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators.\nWe deliver low prices, vast selection, and convenience. In the last year, we: - Held record-breaking shopping events to help consumers save, including our Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, where customers purchased more than 1 billion items and saved nearly 70% more compared to the 11-dayperiod ending on Cyber Monday 2022. This comes on the heels of our biggest-everPrime Day, where customers saved more than $2.5 billion, and our largest two-dayOctober Holiday Kick- off event-PrimeBig Deal Days, where Amazon Prime members saved more than $1 billion.\n-\nDelivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever globally, with more than 7 billion units arriving the same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and 2 billion in Europe.\n-\nLaunched new and enhanced devices and services, including\nnew Fire TV features, like a generative artificial intelligence (\"AI\") powered search; the next generation of Echo smart speakers; expanded home security offerings through Ring and Blink; improved Wi-Fi speeds with eero Max 7; and the Fire Max 11 tablet.\nWe created new generative AI tools to invent new consumer and seller experiences, such as: - Rufus, a generative AI-powered conversational shopping experience.\n- Customer review highlights, a generative AI-powered feature that lets shoppers in our store quickly determine what other customers are saying about a product before reading through reviews.\n- A tool to help sellers create product listings through generative AI.\n-\nA preview of a smarter and more conversational Alexa, powered by generative AI and a large language model custom- built for voice interactions.\n-\nA generative AI solution to help brands produce lifestyle imagery that can improve the performance of their ads while also making them more engaging.\nWe launched new generative AI tools and services for AWS customers. In the last year, we: - Reimagined the future of work with new generative AI applications. For example, we launched Amazon Q, the coding companion from AWS. Q is an expert on AWS-itwrites code, debugs code, tests code, and does translations, such as moving from an old version of Java to a new one. It can also query AWS customers' various data repositories to answer questions, summarize data, carry on a conversation, and take action. We also announced the general availability of Amazon CodeWhisperer, an AI-poweredproductivity tool that generates code suggestions in real time based on a developer's natural language comments and existing code, providing a giant leap forward in developer productivity.\n-\nProvided general availability of Amazon Bedrock, AWS's fully-managed service for customers to leverage existing large language models and customize them with their own data to build generative AI applications securely, privately, and responsibly.\n- Announced and launched new chips, including AWS Inferentia2 chips optimized for large-scale generative AI applications with models containing hundreds of billions of parameters, while delivering the lowest cost per inference in the cloud, and AWS Trainium2 chips designed to deliver up to 4x faster training for generative AI applications while improving energy efficiency up to 2x compared to first generation Trainium chips.\nWe continue to invest in new areas of the business that we believe customers will love, such as: - Our low Earth orbit satellite broadband initiative, Project Kuiper, which launched two prototype satellites into space and achieved a 100% success rate for the mission. The mission validated key technologies that underpin the satellite broadband network, allowing Project Kuiper to scale satellite production ahead of a full-scale deployment beginning this year. This initiative is designed to provide fast, affordable broadband to communities around the world that are currently unserved or underserved by traditional internet and communications options.\n- World-classentertainment through Prime Video, including Thursday Night Football, the first-ever Black Friday National Football League game, and Amazon Originals films and series like Reacher, Invincible, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and Citadel.\n- New offerings to help customers get and stay healthy, including an expanded Amazon Clinic virtual health care marketplace and the acquisition of One Medical, a primary care organization.\nDisclaimer Amazon.com Inc. published this content on\n10 April 2024 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.
