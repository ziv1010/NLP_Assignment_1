  "body_text": "SARINA WIEGMAN is relishing the chance to see England face Australia in one of two highly-anticipated pre-World Cups duels.\nThe Lionesses play the Matildas in April as part of a double-header with the Three Lions facing the Socceroos in October.\nEngland’s clash with the Matildas, who are skippered by Chelsea striker Sam Kerr, will take place on Tuesday 11 April.\nThe 7:45 pm match at the home of Brentford will follow a sold-out Finalissima duel at Wembley between the Lionesses and Brazil on Thursday 6 April.\nBoth games take place just over three months before this year’s Women’s World Cup co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand.\nThis 32-team tournament will kick off on July 20 with Kerr’s side taking on the Republic of Ireland.\nLionesses chief Wiegman, 53, said: “We are always looking for different challenges.\n“We are really happy to play two more strong non-European teams in Brazil and Australia in April.\n“They will both be competitive at the World Cup, and Australia will give everything to impress because they are going into a home tournament with big expectations.\n“They will want to show they are in good shape for the finals.”\nMost read in Football\nEngland’s game against Australia is being billed as the Alzheimer’s Society International with the fixture being used to raise funds and awareness for the charity.\nThe last clash between the sides was a friendly that ended 1-1 in October 2018.\nFran Kirby gave the Lionesses a first-half lead before Claire Polkinghorne’s late leveller.\nAnd 13 of England’s Euros-winning squad were part of a Team GB side knocked out by Australia in the quarter-finals of the Tokyo Olympics football tournament in June 2021.\nThe side, managed by then interim boss Hege Riise, lost 4-3 with now-retired Lioness Ellen White netting a hat-trick.\nWiegman, whose team play Belgium on Wednesday, added: “We know Australia have players at the highest level.\n“For us it is another opportunity to see where we stand in our preparation for the World Cup.\n“It will also be very special to play them at Brentford as it was a great stadium during the Euros.\n“We want to create more excitement for our fans as we prepare for what we hope will be another memorable summer.”\nTickets for England Women vs Australia Women are due to go on general sale from 3:00 pm on Wednesday 22 February.\nFurther details can be found on the FA’s web site.",
