  "body_text": "Manchester United have confirmed that goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce has put pen to paper on a new deal, extending her stay at the club at least until June 2028.\n🔏 @Phallon91 is here to stay ❤️#MUWomen\n— Manchester United Women (@ManUtdWomen) April 25, 2025\nTullis-Joyce joined United in September 2023 and became the club’s No 1 shot-stopper after the departure of Mary Earps in the summer.\nShe has been a key member of the squad this season, keeping an impressive 13 clean sheets from 19 games – the most in the WSL. Her contributions have also been invaluable in helping United reach a third successive FA Cup final.\nMarc Skinner’s side have conceded just nine goals – four fewer than the next lowest team, Chelsea. She ranks in the top five for saves, crosses caught and punched clearances.\nIt has been a fantastic past few weeks for the 28-year-old, who also earned her first cap for the USA national team earlier this month.\nSkinner recently branded Tullis-Joyce one of the best goalkeepers in the world.\nReacting to her new contract, Tullis-Joyce told club media, “I am really grateful to have this opportunity to continue the exciting journey we are on.”\n“All of us in the team have ever-growing dreams of what we can achieve together. We want to keep making history and I am so proud to keep wearing the Manchester United badge.”\nMatt Johnson, Manchester United interim head of women’s football, stated, “Phallon has been exceptional for us this season, both on the pitch as a keeper and, off the pitch, as an ambassador and leader.”\n“This shows the ambition of the club that we can retain one of the best goalkeepers in the world here at Manchester United.”\nUnited are back in action next Wednesday when they host table leaders Chelsea at Leight Sports Village. The Reds will then take on Manchester City on Sunday before closing the WSL season with a fixture vs. Arsenal.\nThere is then the small matter of the FA Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley on May 18.\nFollow us on Bluesky: @peoplesperson.bsky.social",
