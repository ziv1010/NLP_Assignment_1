A total of $434,429 will be allocated to four chosen programmes to advance conservation, comprising $144,008 from AZA and $290,421 obtained through matching funds.\n“From Africa’s grasslands to North America’s oceans and forests, conservation is as much about people as it is about wildlife,” says Dan Ashe, president and CEO of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.\n“Wildlife conservation is evolving, and these projects reflect a new era of solutions that not only leverage science but also empower people and foster collaboration to protect species before it’s too late. Congratulations to each grant recipient as they begin this critical work.”\nLaunched in 2019, the SAFE Granting Program is a specialised funding source for AZA’s flagship conservation programme. This year, 11 out of 48 eligible SAFE species programmes submitted proposals, with four winning projects selected for grant support. A total of fourteen AZA members, along with six other partners including non-governmental organisations, government agencies, and universities, will collaborate to complete the chosen projects.\n2025 SAFE Granting Program recipients\nCan Sports Help Save Rhinos? Harnessing Pro-Rhino Behavior Through Youth Soccer - AZA SAFE Black Rhino\nTraditionally, rhino protection has relied on law enforcement; however, involving local communities through complementary measures can significantly aid in combating poaching. The AZA SAFE Black Rhino programme highlights the need to connect people to rhino conservation, particularly through initiatives such as Namibia’s Rhino Cup Champions League.\nThis programme aims to empower rural women’s football teams, creating opportunities for youth while promoting pro-rhino behaviour and enhancing awareness about rhino conservation.\nThe collaborators are Jeff Muntifering, PhD, from the Minnesota Zoo Foundation in Apple Valley, Minnesota; Seth Stapleton, PhD, from the Minnesota Zoo; Wild and Free Foundation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Save the Rhino Trust in London, England.\nCoral Aquarist Program: Building Our Capacity Initiative (BOCI) - AZA SAFE Coral\nThe Florida Reef Tract Rescue Project Coral Aquarist Programme, part of the AZA SAFE Coral programme, is designed to enhance land-based nursery management capabilities.\nIt comprises two phases: an online course covering coral biology, aquarium life support systems, water chemistry, and coral welfare, and a practical seven-day onsite training session.\nThe collaborators are Mitch Carl from Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium in Omaha, Nebraska; Bart Shepherd from the California Academy of Sciences / Steinhart Aquarium in San Francisco, California; Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, Georgia.; Florida Coral Rescue Center-SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida; and The Florida Aquarium in Tampa, Florida.\nDeployment of Artificial Nest Boxes to Promote Breeding in Wild Thick-billed Parrots and Prevent Predation - AZA SAFE Thick-billed Parrot\nThe San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, in collaboration with its in-country partner Ovis, plans to construct and install new nest boxes within the breeding range of the thick-billed parrot. This initiative seeks to improve breeding success and reduce predation risks.\nProviding essential nesting sites will support the recovery of this endangered species while supporting the AZA SAFE Thick-billed Parrot initiative.\nThe collaborators are James Sheppard, PhD, and Jenna Duarte Stallard at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance in San Diego, California; Ernesto C. Enkerlin-Hoeflich, PhD, OVIS in San Pedro Garza García, Nuevo León, Mexico; Sacramento Zoo in Sacramento, California; San Francisco Zoological Gardens in San Francisco, California; and Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas.\nStar Power: Building Capacity for Sunflower Sea Star Recovery Through Population Monitoring, Genetic Preservation, and Collaborative Conservation - AZA SAFE Sunflower Sea Star\nThe AZA SAFE Sunflower Sea Star programme seeks to assist in the recovery of the sunflower sea star, which has experienced a significant decline due to sea star wasting disease.\nThis initiative focuses on three primary areas: enhancing monitoring and identification of both wild and captive sunflower sea stars with advanced methods such as artificial intelligence recognition systems, increasing genetic diversity through improved cryopreservation and biobanking strategies, and fostering collaboration by convening a stakeholder workshop aimed at formulating a regional recovery plan.\nThe collaborators are Jessye Wojtusik, PhD, and Ben Morrow at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium in Omaha, Nebraska; Ashley Kidd at Sunflower Star Laboratory in Moss Landing, California; Jared Guthridge at Seward Association for the Advancement of Marine Science, DBA Alaska SeaLife Center in Seward, Alaska; University of California-Merced in Merced, California; University of Washington in Seattle, Washington; Friday Harbor Labs in Friday Harbor, Washington; John G. Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, Illinois; and SEA LIFE Michigan Aquarium in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\nThe SAFE Granting Fund was initially established with funding from the Arthur L. and Elaine V. Johnson Foundation and endowed by JoEllen Doornbos in 2021. This year’s grants were made possible through the generous support of the foundation and other philanthropic contributors.\nSee also: From accreditation to action: AZA’s impact on the future of conservation\nCharlotte Coates is blooloop's editor.
