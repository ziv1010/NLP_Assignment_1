  "body_text": "The largest and oldest track meet in the U.S. returns to action this week. The 127th Penn Relays will take place from Thursday, April 27 to Saturday, April 29—with hundreds of grade school, college, professional, and masters runners competing in Philadelphia. The meet has been hosted at the University of Pennsylvania’s Franklin Field since 1895, and it’s become a pilgrimage of sorts for track fans across the world.\nHow to Watch the 2023 Penn Relays\nThe meet will be streamed on FloTrack (subscription required). A year-long plan is $149.99 or you can subscribe month-by-month for $29.99.\nRace Details\nWhere: The Penn Relays are hosted by the University of Pennsylvania at historic Franklin Field in Philadelphia.\nWhen: Events kick off Thursday at 9 a.m. ET and run until Saturday evening. You can view the full event schedule here.\nThe 4xMile World Record is Officially on Notice\n15:49.08. That’s the time the University of Washington has to beat if the Huskies want the world record in the 4xmile relay. Set by Ireland in 1985, the record is technically a “world’s best,” since the event isn’t contested frequently enough to make World Athletics' official list, but regardless, we could witness history after the race goes off at 1:20 p.m. on Saturday.\nTo break the record, each Washington miler will need to run an average time of 3:57.26. Luckily for the Huskies, the average PR of their top four runners is a whopping 3:52.67. However, they’ll be pushed by a deep field, which includes the University of Virginia, Georgetown University, and Oklahoma State University—who will all look to dip under the 16:00 barrier. The collegiate record of 16:03.24 is certainly under threat if the race is run at an honest pace.\n800 Meter Stars Clash in the … 600 Meters?\nAlthough she’s known as an 800-meter ace, Ajeé Wilson will be stepping down the 600 meters on Saturday afternoon—an event she owns the American record in. The two-time Olympian will be pushed by Sage Hurta-Klecker (the winner of the 800 meters at last year’s Relays) and Natoya Goule, who will be cheered on by a large Jamaican crowd that routinely has a boisterous presence each year. Also keep an eye on the high school sprints: Jamaica’s fastest teenagers annually make the trek up to Philly to showcase their talent.\nStanford and Oklahoma State Headline the Distance Medley Relays\nThe DMR, as it’s known, consists of four legs, in order: the 1,200 meters, 400 meters, 800 meters, and 1,600 meters. The event isn’t contested at the NCAA Championships outdoors, but it is indoors. The men’s and women’s champions from indoor season will line up on Friday afternoon for a chance to win a coveted Penn Relays wheel. The Stanford women, led by freshman phenoms Roisin Willis and Juliette Whittaker, are looking for their first ever title in the event, while the Oklahoma State men will try to improve on the collegiate record they set indoors.\nIt’s Wouldn’t Be Philly Sports without the Eagles\nLast April, Devon Allen received a warm welcome from the city of Philadelphia. Early in the month, he was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles to a three-year deal as a wide receiver, and a few weeks later, won the 110-meter hurdles at the Penn Relays. The two-time Olympian was a practice squad player for the Eagles last year, who made it all the way to the Super Bowl. Allen, who played football and ran track while in college at Oregon, returns to Franklin Field as not only the fan favorite, but the favorite to win the event again.\nTheo Kahler is the news editor at Runner’s World. He’s a former all-conference collegiate runner at Winthrop University, and he received his master’s degree in liberal arts studies from Wake Forest University, where he was a member of one of the top distance-running teams in the NCAA. Kahler has reported on the ground at major events such as the Paris Olympics, U.S. Olympic Trials, New York City Marathon, and Boston Marathon. He’s run 14:20 in the 5K, 1:05:36 in the half marathon, and enjoys spotting tracks from the sky on airplanes. (Look for colorful ovals around football fields.)",
