  "body_text": "Vancouver Rise FC defeats Ottawa, McAslan records 8th clean sheet of season\nPublished 4:21 pm Thursday, October 9, 2025\nVancouver Rise FC's Morgan McAslan had her eighth clean sheet of the season Wednesday night after the Rise FC defeated the Ottawa Rapid FC 2-0.\nMcAslan said Rise FC's defence helped her keep the game scoreless for the Rapid FC, \"especially with Bex [Rebecca Lake] sliding into the\ncentre-back role, I think she came in and did a really good job.\"\nThe defence \"made it relatively easy for me and made it predictable, making some great tackles and blocking some shots,” she said.\nThe Rise FC took on the Rapid FC at the TD Place Stadium in Ottawa, holding possession 52 percent of the time and taking 16 shots, 10 of which were on goal, while the Rapid FC took 16, three of which were on goal.\nRise FC's Latifah Abdu scored the first goal of the match in the 15th minute, followed by Jessica De Filippo three minutes later.\nRise FC's head coach, Anja Heiner-Møller, was happy with Wednesday night's game.\n\"I think, first of all, it was about being ready from the start, we had a good start to the game. I also think that we finished the game in terms of scoring the goals and securing the result,\" Heiner-Møller said.\nThe Rise FC will travel to Montreal for its next match on Oct. 11, taking on the Montréal Roses FC.\nThe top four teams in the league will play in the semifinals, with all four teams securing their spots: AFC Toronto, Montreal Roses, Ottawa Rapid and, as of today, the Vancouver Rise FC. The final is scheduled for Nov. 15 at BMO Field in Toronto.\nVancouver Rise are part of Canada's first professional women's soccer league, the Northern Super League. The other clubs are Calgary Wild FC, Halifax Tides FC, Montréal Roses, Ottawa Rapid FC and AFC Toronto.",
