Group C guide\n- Published\nFrom the most decorated team in Europe to first-timers, there's a range of major tournament experience among the teams in Group C.\nGermany missed out on a record-extending ninth Euros title in 2022 when England snatched victory with an extra-time winner at Wembley in the final.\nCan they get their hands back on the trophy this summer? They are joined by debutants Poland, as well as former finalists Denmark and inaugural winners Sweden in their Euro 2025 group.\nBBC Sport takes a closer look at the teams involved.\nDenmark\nManager: Andree Jeglertz Nationality: Swedish Appointed: 2023\nCaptain: Pernille Harder Position: Forward Club: Bayern Munich\nKey player: Signe Bruun Position: Forward Club: Real Madrid\nForm: Denmark enjoyed a positive qualifying campaign, only missing out on the top spot of their group to world champions Spain.\nHowever, they head into the Euros on a disappointing run of two defeats in three games in the Women's Nations League, including a 6-1 hammering by Sweden in their last match - in which they conceded three goals in the first 11 minutes - as they finished third in their group.\nTournament hopes: Denmark are often overlooked when it comes to major tournaments but the nation did reach the final of Euro 2017, losing 4-2 to the Netherlands.\nHowever, they failed to make it out of the group stage in 2022 and this will be their first and only tournament under Andree Jeglertz who took charge after the 2023 World Cup, when they lost to hosts Australia in the last 16. Jeglertz, who will be replaced by Jakob Michelsen after the Euros, has been linked with Manchester City's vacant head coach role.\nGermany\nManager: Christian Wuck Nationality: German Appointed: 2024\nCaptain: Giulia Gwinn Position: Full-back Club: Bayern Munich\nKey player: Klara Buhl Position: Winger Club: Bayern Munich\nForm: Germany cruised through qualifying, with a 3-0 defeat by Iceland their only blip as they topped their group.\nThe Olympic bronze medallists are on a fine run of form, winning their last five games in the Nations League and scoring at least four goals in each of those, including a 4-0 thrashing of 2017 European champions the Netherlands.\nTournament hopes: Having won the competition a record eight times - out of the 11 tournaments they have entered - Germany will always be expected to go far.\nHowever, success is not guaranteed. After reaching the final of the Euros in 2022, Germany crashed out of the group stage at the World Cup a year later - finishing behind Colombia and Morocco.\nChristian Wuck, who took charge after the Paris Olympics, will be without highly rated midfielder Lena Oberdorf. The 23-year-old won the best young player award at Euro 2022 but has failed to recover from a knee injury. However, they have plenty of other attacking threats at their disposal, including Bayern Munich duo Lea Schuller and Klara Buhl.\nPoland\nManager: Nina Patalon Nationality: Polish Appointed: 2021\nCaptain: Ewa Pajor Position: Forward Club: Barcelona\nKey player: Natalia Padilla-Bidas Position: Forward Club: Bayern Munich\nForm: Poland lost all six of their qualifying matches for this tournament and were relegated to League B in a dismal campaign but they managed to seal their place through the play-offs.\nThat was the beginning of a 10-game unbeaten run for the Poles but the majority of those wins have been against weaker opposition in League B of the Nations League.\nTournament hopes: The bar is low for Poland. This is their first ever major tournament appearance so getting to Switzerland is an achievement in itself.\nHowever, Nina Patalon's team will be keen to make an impression and all eyes will be on prolific goalscorer Ewa Pajor, who netted 25 goals in 28 league games for Barcelona this season.\nSweden\nManager: Peter Gerhardsson Nationality: Swedish Appointed: 2017\nCaptain: Kosovare Asllani Position: Forward Club: London City Lionesses\nKey player: Fridolina Rolfo Position: Winger Club: Barcelona\nForm: Sweden finished behind France and England in their qualifying group for Euro 2025 but they breezed through the play-offs with a 12-0 win over Luxembourg and a 8-0 thrashing of Serbia.\nTheir struggles have been evident in two draws have against Wales, ranked 25 places lower, but they looked convincing in an emphatic 6-1 win over fellow Group C side Denmark at the start of June.\nTournament hopes: Sweden have reached the semi-finals in each of their last three major tournaments so there's always an expectation that they will go far.\nHowever, they have an ageing squad and Euro 2025 is likely to be the last European Championship for several players, including captain Kosovare Asllani.\nThere might be extra motivation, though, to win a trophy before head coach Peter Gerhardsson, who has been in charge since 2017, steps down after the tournament.\nRelated topics\n- Published23 June 2025\n- Published27 June 2025\n- Published23 June 2025",
