  "body_text": "Written By:\n- Date published:\n6:00 am, August 19th, 2023 - 58 comments\nCategories: open mike -\nTags:\nOpen mike is your post.\nFor announcements, general discussion, whatever you choose.\nThe usual rules of good behaviour apply (see the Policy).\nStep up to the mike …\n- Comments are now closed\n-\nhttps://www.1news.co.nz/2023/08/19/john-campbell-beth-and-taxes-in-election-la-la-land/\nJohn Campbell dismantling labour and the national on tax, !\n-\nUnlike John, I got a first in accounting.\nAnd I can note the largest ever increase in base benefits ever (overdue given the cuts of 1991, under-assessment of living costs in the adjustment since then and real increases in MW levels), and the increase in amount of part-time work income someone on a benefit can get before any abatement kicks in (also overdue because of lack of adjustment for over a decade).\nThe increase of the in work tax credit amount is to continue the targeted support to the families of full-time lower wage workers – there are costs associated with work (particularly shift work) not faced by those on benefits. This is not used to reduce child poverty in beneficiary families, because it was not designed for that purpose.\nIt is near impossible to prevent child poverty without quality affordable housing* (not enough income related rent housing), accessible health care and food in \"working class area\" public schools.\nIn the absence of that*, a rent freeze (a $50 rent rise in the past year and in the next year is also likely) from 2022-2024 would have been the correct policy.\n-\n…..MW levels\nSPC what are these please?\n-\nMinimum wage?\n-\nThanks BD, that makes sense.\nThese valuable increases to benefits/minimum wage and the commitment to regular review may be in danger of being overlooked as the opposition parties try to force a ‘I’ve got bigger baubles than you’ type election.\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nHow many sitting ie voting days do we have left in Parliament?\nThat RMA replacement has to go through, also Land Transport Safety bill.\nAre they running out of time?\n-\nI believe the 31st is the last sitting day before closing up shop for the election so that'd mean.\nAugust 22, 23, 24, 29, 30, and 31;\n-\nThey gave up on the MHA (1992) review completion by the 2023 election.\nSomeone should ask NACT what their plans for that are, given their love of incarceration of the underclass/more prisons/more youth in institutions/boot camps/less rights for new workers/transferring oversight of those on benefits under 25 to outside providers …\n-\nRMA third reading was Wednesday, not that our petty minded gallery journalists would think to inform us – they are far too busy trying to gotcha Hipkins on whether or not passata is going to be GST exempt.\nhttps://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/495939/rma-replacement-bills-pass-third-readings-in-parliament\n-\n-\nHas anyone else had a problem with the unsafe (\"safety\"?) yellow plastic dots around Auckland Public transport areas?\nA father of three fears he will lose a leg after a horrific injury caused by a slip on yellow tactile dots on the footpath of an Auckland train station.\nApparently AT have know for 5 years of the hazardous, if not dangerous, nature of these dots.\nEmails show even AT staff were not immune to injury, with one employee slipping and injuring their elbow at a train station.\nIn the email from September 2018, the staff member asks:\n\"What I want to know is when there will be a fix … or a sign warning of the danger at least on the section I ride from Monday to Friday.\n\"I am a customer as well as an employee and I still have an open case logged and should not have to go chasing a project manager for a response.\"\nFYI, I am only raising for a safety reason, for AT users, not as a Govt bash exercise.\n-\nTactile paving.\nSteel and plastic mistakes and onto concrete …\nThere was a particularly bad patch when stainless steel domes were introduced in Auckland. Mr Orr says they were a slippery mistake.\nYellow is much preferred because of the number of people who have low vision and use the bright colours as an important cue.\nThe raised surface of tactile paving can be difficult for people with arthritis or limited mobility. On top of that, the stainless steel was slippery.\n-\nYep, considering how dangerous and expensive these are (to also remove/replace !) , I'm dumbfounded that there wasnt firstly a trial placement on a small area .\nJust seems a good idea turned bad/dangerous, through lack of common sense. \"Tactile\" plastic ..when wet. Auckland rain….\nWho let that through?\n-\n“These are on the edge of the road and in front of bus stops. Auckland Transport needs to take ownership of this issue and think about the human cost of these injuries.”\nDianne Rogers, from Blind and Low Vision New Zealand, said tactile pavers were an incredibly important aid for the visually impaired but had to be non-slip.\n“If they are a slip hazard when wet, it can be doubly dangerous for the sight-impaired because they can’t see if they are wet.”\n-\nThey first tried steel – got slippery when wet. Then moved to plastic, got slippery when wet.\n-\nJust has a dogged \"we should know this cant possibly be safe, but we will keep going \" element\nWould be a humour…but the many broken bones….poor people.\n-\n-\n-\n-\nyes. can be quite slippery at times.\n-\nHi, good you know. Take care, as some of the fall injuries have been quite horrific.\n-\n-\n-\nTo stop the blind walking off platforms onto tracks.\nThe yellow colour to warn those with limited sight and the raised up bits for those using canes.\n-\nI know. Quite bizarre. And they are for a visual and \"tactile\" alert. Seemingly moreso for blind/low vision people. And they..can be super slippery.\nI would think replacement under urgency….with the NON slip alternative…that should have been trialled and used firstly !\n-\nAlternate coloured and textured paving would meet both visual and tactile outcomes.\n-\n-\n-\nDude should watch his step ,!!seriously we evolved living out in the open dodging shit that wanted yo kill us ,\nWe're becoming pretty pathetic when a few slips and trips gets a news story.\nNext we'll be suing companies when we spill hot coffee on our selves.\n-\n\"If\" it was one dude….\"maybe\". I get dodging hazards..(I ride a bike in town !)\nBut you should also actually read the links..and other replies. Also look at photo's of specifically what they are for and where they are located. And the cost of a failed system. For more actual relevant info….\n-\nThey have them in a regional shopping centre near me (Takapuna) – many, many, accidents and complaints reported on local FB pages and to the Council. With, as far as anyone can see, no action.\nIt seems that AT have the budget to implement these 'safety initiatives' but no budget to remove them, when they prove more hazardous than the problem they were trying to solve.\n-\nThe do it to comply with regulations (disability). Tick boxes.\nThey don't fix because of cost to ratepayers. I wonder how much money they have cost ACC?\nIf ACC was able to claim reimbursement from public bodies – charge them for their cost …\n-\nIf they are retaining a hazard, when they know it's a hazard, then I suspect they'll be liable under the H&S legislation under the \"duty of care\" provisions. Certainly there have been several recent court cases over Council liability in relation to negligence over known hazards (admittedly more around trees and landslips, than built environment)\nAt least one employee has been injured – so WorkSafe should have agency to intervene. AT, no doubt, would be much more concerned over this – since WS can afford the cost of a court case, whereas injured individuals generally can't.\n-\n-\nOh if you are also a commuter/user, is good that you are aware of the danger….the falls and injuries look real bad.\n-\n-\nOccasionally my knee jerks quicker than my brain can react to.\n-\nAllgood …you also have the dry quick-wit ..that phrase pretty good : )\n-\n-\n-\n-\nThe bean counters won.\nhttps://www.vanguardgroup.co.nz/product-category/road-safety-cycleways/tactiles-studs-pavers/\n-\nYea, The plastic/steel ones even look pretty UNsafe…..as in unfit for purpose.\nProblem with bean counting, as always, there is an extra cost….\n-\n-\n-\nChris Hipkins, Winston Peters as bad as each other : The two will say and do anything to get your vote this election.\nBut they won't give Mike Hosking a tax cut, he loves tax cuts and they know he loves tax cuts and yet they do not.\nSo what does Mike do, he does what Hosking always does – says they seek the votes of people poorer than him.\nThis is a guy so self centred and short-sighted (except when imagining himself on a winter holiday financed by a tax cut), that he would only try and observe his own navel if he had his favourite hand held sucker upper in hand and some crumbs to eliminate.\n-\nAnything past mike hosking says , is not worth the effort imho\n-\n-\nIs a person who makes jokes about blowing things up “a fit and proper person” to have a gun license?\n-\nForget the gun license. Are they a 'fit and proper person' to be an MP ??\n-\nLong-suffering west Auckland commuters may be able to shave nearly 20 minutes off their journey if the Government's Northwestern Busway goes ahead.\n\"It was one of Auckland's biggest transport mistakes that we didn't build it a decade ago when we spent all that money widening the Northwestern at the time,\" said public transport advocate Matt Lowrie.\n-\nFrom my reading of other Matt Lowrie Public Transport comments…he thinks, and talks a lot of sense.\nHave you read his comment on alternatives to the tunnels ?\nhttps://www.greaterauckland.org.nz/2023/08/07/the-harbour-crossing-boondoggle/\nI dont live up there….but what do you think ?\n300km of light rail sounds..awesome.\n-\nI did not vote for or against Wayne, not on me, not a resident.\nRobinson's main focus during his second period as mayor was his advocacy for rapid transit system for Auckland. Robinson's proposal for a bus-rail rapid transit plan was \"to provide fast, modern electrified railways through the main traffic corridors of the region\". The proposal had passenger trains every three minutes running from an underground subway terminal in the city centre with above ground tracks leading to Howick, Auckland Airport and a tunnel to the North Shore. The scheme was heavily criticized for its cost (an estimated $273 million in 1973) and both the ARA chairman Tom Pearce and most of its members opposed the scheme. The Third Labour Government reneged on an election pledge to pay for the scheme and the rapid rail proposal disappeared. Retrospectively, Robinson's idea to implement rapid rail was seen as a possible long-term solution to Auckland's subsequent transportation difficulties. The phrase; \"If we'd only listened to Robbie…\" has become common speech in Auckland whenever the city's transport system is debated.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dove-Myer_Robinson\nThe Rail Link worked (extensions/improvements). Bus lanes work (can later be used for light rail developments). More of them.\nThey need to improve flow to and off the bridge. They need to plan for coping with higher sea levels (as to where the bridge begins/ends).\nThe next new development is a new bridge. They need to keep heavy vehicles off the clip-on, so it lasts longer.\nHave they considered a congestion tax for lone passenger cars or reserving lanes for commuter (multiple passenger) cars?\nWhy are bike/foot traffic options not front and centre of early developments (existing bridge)?\nOh and look for people to crew ferries, they operate internationally – we can recruit more than bus drivers.\n-\nHi, thanks for detailed reply. Like Matt Lowrie… youve also thought through some options and alternatives.\nAnd re Dove-Myer Robinson…..I did know the name ? But the wiki page and his backstory…certainly a forward thinker ! As apart from the Bus Rail rapid transit ..he was an Environmentalist too?\nMore like needed.\n-\n-\n-\n-\nSince the clean car tax goes to subsidize new evs, could it also subsidize replacement batteries for cheaper second hand evs?\n-\n-\nThanks for transporting me back to tauranga boys college 3rd form discos, classic days .\n-\n-\n-\nThe rehabilitation of a mass murderer continues.\n#Russia History takes its unexpected turn. An 8-meter-high Stalin monument was installed in the middle of Velikie Luki in the Pskov region. The priest of the Russian Orthodox Church consecrated the statue. Yes, the priest blessed the statue of Stalin.\nhttps://twitter.com/HannaLiubakova/status/1692472692459422074\n-\nI see Luxon does not rate Woodhouse on his List.. Well he had to get something right. I have read the summary only. I will be looking at Barbara Kruriger as well.\n-\nWhen a leader under-performs, the price is not paid by the leader (safe at no.1) but by those down the list.\nA bunch of new ACT MPs will come in at the expense of National candidates. Or – in Woodhouse's case – a sitting MP.\nI bet he wouldn't have chucked his toys if National were 40+ in the polls.\n-\nApart from a few at the top (Cabinet group), list rankings only have meaning is the MP's electorate if a marginal one. Kuriger has a safe seat. Promising new MP’s get a safe seat, the chance to win a marginal seat or come in on the list.\n-\n…list rankings only have meaning\nisif the MP's electorateifis a marginal one …\n-\n-\n-\nFifty seven years old, 2,267-kilograms, fifty fucking years in a 24x11x6M tank.\n/\nCorrect headline:\nWhite people kill Tokitae, matriarch of the endangered Southern Resident clan, after 50 years of imprisonment\nSubhead:\nDespite longstanding #Indigenous efforts to bring her home to Lummi waters in the #PNW, colonizers persisted in exploiting her\nhttps://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/lolita\nLolita, the beloved killer whale who's spent the past five decades at the Miami Seaquarium, died Friday after a sudden illness, officials said.\nThe orca, also known as Toki or Tokitae, passed away from what's believed to be a renal condition, the Seaquarium said\nhttps://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/lolita-miami-seaquariums-beloved-killer-whale-dies/3094497/\nhttps://journa.host/@Toastie/110913057931037559\n-\nPassed a piece of Council owned land on the North Shore isthmus used for election bill boards. The Labour billboard was down and someone had taken to it with an axe and chopped it into pieces. Rarely seen anyone go to that extent before.\nI predict Labour is going to find their billboards are being trashed at a much higher rate than seen before. I base it, in part, on the level of vindictiveness their political and media enemies (looking at ZB hosts in particular) have encouraged, plus the insanity and hysteria around Covid and right wing extremism in general.\nI think Labour in particular is in for a very rough campaign ride. Lets hope no-one gets hurt – or worse.\n-\nThe Russian general who oversaw the building of Vladimir Putin’s luxurious Black Sea palace and knew all of its secrets has died suddenly in prison.\nGennady Lopyrev, 69, had been due for parole but was reportedly diagnosed with leukaemia on August 14 and died two days later.\nIn leukemia, your body makes abnormal blood cells that multiply and divide. The abnormal cells eventually outnumber healthy cells, including healthy white blood cells. That leaves your body with lower-than-normal levels of white blood cells or leukopenia\nPolonium poisoning also causes leukopenia.\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/58088\n-\nPolonium poisoning also causes leukopenia.\nProstate cancer too, apparently.\nOne of the Russian agents wanted for the murder of Alexander Litvinenko has reportedly developed advanced cancer from the same radioactive poison used in the assassination.\n-\n-\nThe Freedom Party of Brian Tamaki using the loud hailer heckler technique.\nFreedoms NZ supporters could be heard yelling chants at Hipkins during his walkabout of the market, heckling him for about 30 minutes.\nThe agenda of the party is to get NACT government money for the Tamaki organisation. The pretence of concern about foreign ownership and homelessness, particularly galling given NACT policy.\n-\nThere is this :\nBrian Tamaki, Sue Grey and assorted conspiracy nuts VS Leighton Baker, Samantha Edwards and assorted conspiracy nuts.\nSo…let them. Most of NZ will see them for what they are…conspiracy nuts.\n- Comments are now closed",
