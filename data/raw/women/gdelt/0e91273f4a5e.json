  "body_text": "Gotham FC opened the year with an away win over Portland Thorns on March 24. Esther scored the only goal in that game, earning three points for a team that would end 2024 in Third Place with 56 points after 26 games for their best finish in the 15-year history of the club.\nBut the season really began almost two months earlier, when Gotham debuted an unrivaled new class of signings at a media event held in the Rainbow Room on the 65th floor of Rockefeller Center. After a brunch of smoked salmon and fresh-squeezed juices, the international media had the opportunity to meet a Galactic0-worthy gathering of talent in Tierna Davidson, Crystal Dunn, Rose Lavelle, and Emily Sonnett.\nCall them the Galacticas. Two of them played a direct role in Gotham's 2-1 NWSL Championship playoff win tonight over Portland. Davidson opened the scoring when she lashed home a loose ball to take a 1-0 lead. It was just the second goal she scored in National Women's Soccer League play.\nThen Rose Lavelle retook the lead in stoppage time after Portland equalized in the 76th minute, making a well-timed run into the box to get on the end of an exquisite pass into open space from Delanie Sheehan, who had come on as a sub in the 90th minute. Sheehan did the hard work, using her technical skill to draw defenders towards her, but Lavelle's finish was world-class, a precision shot that crossed up Portland goalkeeper Shelby Hogan.\nThat goal sealed a result that remained just out of reach for most of the night. Gotham were the better team from the opening whistle, but despite dominating the midfield and generating opportunities in the attacking third, they simply couldn't finish the chances they created. Forward Ella Stevens was electric on the left in the first half as she frustrated the Portland defense with her speed, positioning, and technical ability, but she simply couldn't link up with Esther, Lynn Williams, or other members of the Gotham attack.\nStill, the vibes were strong throughout the night. An announced attendance of 15,540 set a new club record, but it felt like all 25,000 seats at Red Bull Arena were full. The crowd responded to every touch, every pass, every turn, shouting their full-throated support when Gotham went on the attack.\nSurprisingly, it was the first home playoff game in club history. Last year, Gotham won the NWSL title after winning three playoff games on the road. Unfortunately, it might be the last in this edition of the NWSL Playoffs. Gotham next play No 2 seed Washington Spirit at Audi Field in the semifinals on Saturday, November 16 at 12 pm ET. That game will be broadcast on CBS.\nIf they win, and if KC Current upset No 1 seed Orlando Pride on Sunday, November 17, then Gotham could host the final at Red Bull Arena. The venue for the final is already set: The 11,500-seat CPKC Stadium, home to Kansas City Current and the first arena built by an NWSL club, will host the title game on Saturday, November 23 at 8 pm ET. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. For now, Gotham should be content to celebrate a strong season and a convincing win over a Portland that featured superstar striker Sophia Smith. The forward scored 12 league goals this season, and might be one-third of the United States women's national team's gold medal-winning \"Triple Espresso,\" but tonight she was no match for Gotham's Galacticos.",
