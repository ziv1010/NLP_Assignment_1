  "body_text": "good morning!\nThe Hoddle of Coffee: Tottenham Hotspur news and links for Tuesday, May 21\nTrending Up / Down\nThe season is done and dusted, which means now is the perfect time to have one final Trending Up / Trending Down.\nThe concept is simple. Hoddle Headquarters takes a look at what around Tottenham Hotspur is trending up, and what is trending down.\nLet’s get started.\nTrending up\nCristian Romero: Named Spurs’ player of the season and is a new father. This is an easy one. A great couple of weeks for Cuti.\nGuglielmo Vicario: He made some truly incredible saves against Manchester City and Sheffield United. One of the better saves of the season came in the 16th minute against City, getting his glove on a shot by Phil Foden from close range. Pierre-Emil Hojbjerg is a lucky man after that botched clearance.\nCup finals: Tottenham Horspur’s women’s squad and the men’s U-21 squad both competed in cup finals these last two weeks. Neither turned out the way we wanted them to, but it’s great to see Spurs back in a Cup final. Here’s to next year.\nBen Davies and Beth England: Both players received Tottenham’s PFA Community Champion awards for being involved in the community for the 2023-24 season. Well done.\nPedro Porro: Two really great strikes in the run-in against Burnely and Sheffield United. Really liked what I saw from him this season and hope there’s more to come in the next.\nTrending down\nJames Maddison: Hasn’t looked like himself for months and I don’t think his place in the England squad is all that guaranteed right now. Hope he plays as little as possible in Australia so he can recover from whatever lingering injury problems he has (if any).\nDomestic flights: Tottenham jetted off to Australia soon as the season ended. Really? That’s pretty lame. Give these players at least a week to spend some time with their families before meaningless football season.\nFitzie’s track of the day: Cardinal, by Kasey Musgraves\nAnd now for your links:\nFootball London talking points from Tottenham’s 3-1 win vs Sheffield United\nCharlie Eccleshare ($$) on 56 things he’ll miss about covering Spurs as he moves to The Athletic’s tennis beat\nNew Liverpool manager and former Tottenham candidate Arne Slot says Reds job ‘difficultto ignore’\nReport: Brighton turn to Kieran McKenna to fill vacant managerial post",
