The fiery Australian has played only one competitive match in 2023 after knee surgery in January.\nWhat will it be like with the Russians and Belarusians back in the draw after last year’s ban?\nHow much of the talk at SW19 will revolve around the divisive plans for tennis in Saudi Arabia?\nWimbledon 2023 promises to be a cracker. Here are some of the key storylines to follow over the next fortnight…\nThe Russians and Belarusians are back\nAfter being banned last year, Russian and Belarusians will be competing at Wimbledon and it is sure to attract plenty of attention.\nSixteen male or female players in the top 100 missed out in 2022, including the likes of men’s world No 3 Daniil Medvedev and women’s world No 2 Aryna Sabalenka, as a response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nUnder pressure from the UK government last year, the All England Club (which organises Wimbledon) banned players from Russia and Belarus from taking part in the tournament.\nThe decision was supported by many Ukrainian players but plenty within tennis — including Novak Djokovic, Billie Jean King and Rafael Nadal — were critical of it, particularly when it was at odds with the stance of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and men’s and women’s tours, as well as the other three grand-slam tournaments. They were allowing Russians and Belarusians to compete as neutral athletes.\nAs a result, the ITF, ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) and WTA (Women’s Tennis Association) announced they would be stripping Wimbledon of ranking points, meaning performances at the tournament would not count towards a player’s world ranking. Elena Rybakina, who won the women’s singles, would have broken into the top 10 if points had been given but instead remained outside the top 20. On the men’s side, despite Djokovic winning his seventh Wimbledon title he dropped from No 3 in the world to No 7.\nAdvertisement\nIn March of this year, the All England Club revoked the ban, saying they would “accept entries from Russian and Belarusian players subject to them competing as ‘neutral’ athletes and complying with appropriate conditions.” Those conditions include refraining from expressing support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and being prohibited from receiving funding from the Russian and/or Belarusian states.\nCan the world No 1 Alcaraz stop Djokovic?\nDjokovic arrives at Wimbledon having won the past four titles. Win again and he would equal the remarkable streaks of Bjorn Borg between 1976-1980 and Roger Federer between 2003-07.\nThe Serb can also match Roger Federer’s total of eight Wimbledon titles and it would be the fourth occasion that he has won three of the four grand-slam titles in a calendar year. No men’s player in history has done that four times.\nHis pedigree on the Wimbledon grass is phenomenal and he is the clear favourite to win the trophy this time round. Djokovic has won 86 matches here, more than the rest of the top 20 men’s players combined (85).\nHe opens the defence of his Wimbledon title against Pedro Cachin on Centre Court at 1.30pm BST on Monday.\nCarlos Alcaraz is ranked No 1 in the world and will take great confidence from winning his first-ever title on grass at Queen’s last month, but he has not gotten past the last 16 in his two previous appearances at the tournament. In 2021, he went out to Medvedev in the second round and last year he was beaten by Jannik Sinner in the last 16.\nLast year’s finalist Nick Kyrgios missed the first five months of 2023 following knee surgery and his only competitive match this year is a defeat on grass to Wu Yibing in Stuttgart last month. Kyrgios was outstanding on the surface last year though, and regardless of form or fitness, he will always back himself to ruffle a few feathers. He could meet Djokovic at the quarter-final stage, should both players reach the last eight.\nAdvertisement\nOne other potential challenger is Matteo Berrettini. The Italian is a grass-court specialist who has won four ATP titles on the surface and took Djokovic to four sets in the 2021 final. Berrettini was champion at Queen’s in 2021 and 2022 but then missed last year’s Wimbledon because of a positive Covid-19 test. He will need to find his feet quickly come the first week though, having played only one tour event in the past 10 weeks.\nWill Swiatek win her first Wimbledon title?\nWell, things were looking pretty rosy for the world No 1 on Thursday as she coasted into the semi-finals of a grass event in Germany, the Bad Homburg Open. It was the first time she has reached the last four on a grass court.\nBut then on Friday, she had to withdraw from her match against Italy’s Lucia Bronzetti after discomfort overnight. The 22-year-old posted on Twitter to say she had “some fever and possible food poisoning”. That is far from ideal for the top women’s seed just three days before Wimbledon gets under way, and it will be interesting to see if that story develops in the coming days before her first-round match on Monday against Zhu Lin, the world No 33 from China.\nI'm so sorry but I have to pull out of my match today. I had a restless night because of some fever and possible food poisoning. I'm not able to perform today and I need to take care of myself. I hope I'll be fine soon. Your support in Bad Homburg was amazing, thank you. pic.twitter.com/pAuN8Ug4u7\n— Iga Świątek (@iga_swiatek) June 30, 2023\nLast year she rocked up in superb form having won 35 matches on the spin — the longest winning streak by a female player in 25 years — but was dumped out in the third round in straight sets by Alize Cornet of France.\nAgain she arrives as the French Open champion, and she will be desperate to continue her promising form on grass this year when she gets to London.\nSwiatek’s illness will not go unnoticed by the rest of the draw. Rybakina was a surprise winner in 2022, beating Ons Jabeur in the final, and she has since risen to third in the world rankings thanks to some excellent runs at big tournaments. She was a losing finalist at the Australian Open to the world No 2 Sabalenka, before getting revenge in the final at Indian Wells. Rybakina also reached finals in Miami and Rome. Both will fancy their chances of going deep in this tournament.\nThe Tunisian Jabeur is another contender, with two of her four career titles coming on grass, while Petra Kvitova won her sixth grass-court title last week in Berlin, beating Caroline Garcia in the final. Kvitova is a two-time winner at Wimbledon, in 2011 and 2014.\n33, 110 – At 33 years and 110 days, Petra Kvitova has become the oldest winner of the German Open. Kvitova is only the second player aged 30 or over to reach the final and win the event, after Chris Evert in 1985. Measured.#bett1open | @WTA @WTA_insider @bett1open pic.twitter.com/Jt5nqRGTVJ\n— OptaAce (@OptaAce) June 25, 2023\nThere are two U.S. representatives in the top 10 seeds — Coco Gauff (7th seed) and Jessica Pegula (4th seed), who also happen to be doubles partners. The two faced each other in the Eastbourne quarter-finals this week, with Gauff winning 6-3, 6-3. The 19-year-old then lost in the last four by the same scoreline to another American, Madison Keys.\nAdvertisement\nGauff burst onto the scene as a 15-year-old at Wimbledon in 2019, coming through qualifying and then stunning Venus Williams in straight sets while ranked 319th in the world. Such was the hype around the teen sensation in the first week that her third-round match against Polona Hercog was moved to Centre Court. Gauff gave the crowd what they wanted, saving two match points on her way to the next round. Simona Halep, the eventual champion, was one step too far on No 1 Court but it was clear back then that Gauff will be a crowd favourite whenever she returns.\nAsked this week about her chances of winning a grand slam, she said: “I definitely feel like I’m on the pathway to getting one soon.”\nA French Open finalist last year, Gauff starts the tournament with a tough first round against Sofia Kenin, the 2020 Australian Open champion and former world No 4.\nThe 43-year-old Venus Williams will compete in her 24th Wimbledon. So dominant in the Noughties, when she won the women’s singles title five times and reached a further four finals, Williams has one of the most eye-catching ties of the first round. She is up against Elina Svitolina, the Ukrainian who returned to tennis at this year’s French Open after a break from the game, during which time she had a baby with men’s player Gael Monfils. The 28-year-old, a semi-finalist at Wimbledon in 2019, returned to the top 100 in June after a brilliant run at the French Open.\nHome favourite Murray is fit and in form\nA decade on from his first Wimbledon title and four years after having serious hip surgery, Andy Murray returns in his best form in years.\nAfter winning back-to-back grass tournaments in Surbiton and Nottingham, the 36-year-old Scot just missed out on a seeding for Wimbledon after losing in the first round at Queen’s to Alex De Minaur. This left him open to facing a higher-ranked player in the first round.\nBut the draw was kind to Murray and instead he faces a fellow Brit, the wildcard Ryan Peniston. Tougher challenges await for the former world No 1 should he win that match though, with a second-round match against either Stefanos Tsitsipas or Dominic Thiem.\nAdvertisement\nIf the Russians and Belarusians are back, does that mean ranking points are up for grabs?\nThe short answer is: yes.\nHow will that impact the world rankings?\nThe men’s and women’s tours calculate their rankings a little differently. On the men’s side, ATP rankings are based on points earned over the preceding 52 weeks, but there is a cap (19) on the number of events that count towards it. So only their best 19 results contribute towards their ranking. On the women’s side, WTA rankings are also based on the preceding 52 weeks — but they are calculated based on a cap of their best 16 events.\nHere is where it gets a little tricky.\nAs Wimbledon is happening a week later this year, players are defending points from events that took place during the week of July 11, 2022 (such as the Swedish Open in Bastad and the Hall of Fame Open in Rhode Island). Players who are not defending any points from events that took place that week will have their 19th-best result (for the men) or 16th-best result (for the women) in the past year replaced with their points from this Wimbledon.\nThe Americans are coming…\nThere is a strong American presence in the men’s draw. They are responsible for five of the 32 seeded players — making them the best-represented nation.\nTaylor Fritz (9), Frances Tiafoe (10), Tommy Paul (16), Sebastian Korda (22) and Ben Shelton (32). Fritz, Korda and Paul are all grand-slam champions at junior level, while Tiafoe is one of the most entertaining players on the tour and Shelton has enjoyed a remarkable 12 months to get seeded at Wimbledon.\nThe 20-year-old was ranked outside the top 400 this time last year. He reached the Australian Open quarter-finals on his first trip outside the United States and enters his first Wimbledon inside the top 40 having never played on grass before. He will be helped in London by his father Bryan, a former world No 55 who reached the fourth round at Wimbledon in 1994.\nAnd outside the seeds, the 6ft 7 in (201cm) Chris Eubanks is in flying form, reaching his first ATP tour final on Friday at the age of 27, after saving five match points against Lloyd Harris in Mallorca. He plays Adrian Mannarino in Saturday’s final.\nAdvertisement\nNo Roger, no Serena, no Nadal — who will get scheduled on Centre Court?\nFor the first time since 1998, there will be no Roger Federer, Serena Williams or Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon. Those three have 17 singles titles at SW19 between them (Federer 8; Williams 7; Nadal 2) and have been regulars on Centre Court during their careers.\nBut now Federer has retired, Williams has not played since the US Open in September and Nadal is out of Wimbledon and the US Open after surgery on his hip.\nThere are big names in the men’s and women’s game competing who are likely to get the chance to show their talent on Centre Court, but it does feel like the organisers have a chance to cast the net a little further when it comes to scheduling matches on their showpiece court.\nLike in 2019 with Gauff, maybe we will see some of the game’s rising stars getting their turn on centre stage.\nWatch out for teen star Andreeva\nOne young player to keep an eye on in the women’s draw is the 16-year-old Russian (and Andy Murray super-fan) Mirra Andreeva.\nThe teenager received a wildcard to the Madrid Open in April while only 15, and promptly beat the 2021 US Open finalist Leylah Fernandez. By doing so, she became the third-youngest player to win a main-draw match at a WTA tournament, behind Gauff and Cici Bellis.\nShe went on to beat the tournament’s 13th seed Beatriz Haddad Maia and on her 16th birthday won against another top-20 player, Magda Linette. In the last-16, she was beaten by the eventual champion Sabalenka.\nAndreeva spoke of her admiration for Murray after seeing him at that tournament. “When you’re here and take a lunch with all these stars, you see Andy Murray, you see his face and he’s so beautiful in life, he is so amazing,” she told Tennis Channel.\n“Imagine how good she’s going to be when she gets her eyes fixed,” was Murray’s response.\nAdvertisement\nAndreeva went through qualifying to reach the main draw at Wimbledon and will face Xiyu Wang, of China, in the first round.\nIs tennis heading to Saudi Arabia?\nTennis is the latest sport to be linked with investment from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which already bankrolls LIV Golf and has made a huge play in football in recent weeks with a major revamp of the Saudi Pro League. They are also the majority owners of the Premier League football club Newcastle United.\nThe ATP’s chairman Andrea Gaudenzi said the men’s tour held “positive” discussions with PIF about a potential investment, and there have been reports that the ATP Next Gen Finals — which features the top eight men’s players aged 21 and under — will be held in the Saudi city of Jeddah this year.\nThere has been criticism of PIF’s increased involvement in other sports due to Saudi Arabia’s record when it comes to human rights, including the criminalisation of homosexuality, severe restrictions on freedom of speech and women’s rights, and the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Many interpret the investment in global sport as an attempt to clean up the country’s public image.\nChris Evert, one of the most successful tennis players of all time, has opposed the plans. She said: “I think it’s sportswashing. I don’t think we need to go there.”\nLast week, Alcaraz said he had “no doubt” he would eventually play in Saudi, while Kyrgios reacted to news about the ATP’s talks by tweeting, “FINALLY. THEY SEE THE VALUE. WE ARE GOING TO GET PAID WHAT WE DESERVE TO GET PAID. SIGN ME UP”.\nLet’s see what players have to say about it this fortnight…\nBoris Becker’s absence\nOne familiar face who won’t be at Wimbledon this year is Boris Becker.\nThe German has been a mainstay at the Championships since winning his first grand-slam title there at the age of 17 in 1985 — either as a player or a pundit.\nLast year, Becker was given a two-and-a-half year sentence for hiding £2.5million ($3.2m) of assets and loans in a bankruptcy fraud case. The court ruled he had acted “deliberately and dishonestly” and he served eight months of the sentence in Wandsworth prison, in south west London, before being released in December and deported from the United Kingdom.\nAdvertisement\nIt is unknown whether he will ever be back at SW19, where he won three singles titles and worked as a pundit for the BBC for the best part of two decades. Reports suggested he could be banned from entering the United Kingdom for 10 years following his release.\n“Wimbledon is my favourite tournament” he told The Guardian in May. “I have won it a number of times. I’ve commentated on the final 20 times. I used to live in Wimbledon. So the club is very, very close to my heart and I’ll be watching it from afar.\n“Say hello to Wimbledon for me.”\n(Photo: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images)",
