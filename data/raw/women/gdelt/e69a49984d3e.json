  "body_text": "Liverpool legend Alan Hansen picks up MBE\nAlan Hansen was one of several at the Windsor Castle ceremony\nFormer Liverpool defender Alan Hansen was awarded an MBE at an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle today, March 18. Hansen, the former Scotland defender and long-time Match of the Day pundit, was formally made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to football and broadcasting on Tuesday.\nHe joined Liverpool from Partick Thistle in 1977 and won three European Cups, eight league titles, two FA Cups and three League Cups in 620 appearances for the Anfield side. Hansen, 69, who lives in Southport, was discharged from hospital last June after Liverpool said he was “seriously ill”.\nHansen is recognised as arguably the greatest defender in Liverpool's history having made 620 appearances for the club over 13 seasons while scoring 19 goals. He won 25 honours during his playing career with the Reds, including eight league championships and three European Cups.\nHansen, a former Scotland international who earned 26 caps for his country, was club captain of Liverpool between 1985 and his retirement due to a knee injury in March 1991, just a month after his close friend Kenny Dalglish had resigned as Reds manager.\nDuring his time as skipper, Liverpool won their first and so far only league and FA Cup double in 1986, as well as claiming further title wins in 1988 and 1990 and the FA Cup in 1989, when Everton were beaten in the final the month after the Hillsborough disaster.\nHansen resisted calls to move into management and instead forged a second career as a television pundit, initially with Sky before moving to the BBC where he was employed for 22 years as the main football expert on the channel until retiring from the role after the World Cup final in 2014.\nRadio presenter and DJ Steve Lamacq, who hosts a Monday afternoon show on BBC Radio 6 Music, was also formally made an MBE on Tuesday for services to broadcasting and music venues. After being named in the New Year Honours list, Lamacq, 60, said: “This came as an incredible shock.\n“Obviously it’s always nice to have your work recognised, especially having just clocked up 31 years in radio. But I’m especially pleased at the mention of music venues as well, because live gigs and the people who put them on have been such a huge part of my life alongside my broadcasting career.”\nThe DJ, known for championing new artists and indie music, started as a local journalist before joining NME in the late 1980s where he watched gigs, discovered new music artists, and reported on the burgeoning Britpop scene.\nThe DJ, who is also often referred to by his nickname Lammo, has hosted a number of awards ceremonies and won accolades including the special recognition gongs at the AIM Independent Music Awards and the Sony Radio Academy Awards, both in 2013.\nTwo-time Olympic champion rower Helen Glover was made an OBE at the Windsor Castle ceremony. At the 2012 Olympics, in partnership with Heather Stanning, Glover won the gold medal in the women’s coxless pairs, which was the inaugural gold medal won by Team GB.\nGlover, 38, was coaxed back for the Paris Olympics after giving birth to twins in January 2020. After learning of the honour, Glover said: “I was determined that this Olympic journey would lead to winning a medal in front of three children and I felt supported by the parenting community.\n“It makes me very proud to be recognised for trying to make a difference within this space.”\nAlso receiving honours are former rugby league international Andrea Dobson, Paralympic archer Jodie Grinham, and Paralympic cyclist Elizabeth Jordan who will all be made MBEs. Grinham became the first openly pregnant Paralympic medallist thanks to individual bronze and team gold medals at the Paris Olympics in 2024. She previously won team silver with John Stubbs on her Games debut at Rio 2016",
