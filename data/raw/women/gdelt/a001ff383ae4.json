  "body_text": "The Voice of Nigeria has issued a public apology over a false report published on its website during the final match of the 2025 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations, in which the Super Falcons of Nigeria defeated Morocco 3–2 to clinch a record-extending tenth title.\nThe apology was contained in a statement issued on Sunday by the Director General/CEO of VON, Jibrin Ndace, who acknowledged the incident and outlined ongoing measures to address it.\nVON, in a now-deleted news item, had earlier prematurely declared Morocco the winner of the WAFCON final match before its conclusion.\nIn reality, Nigeria’s Super Falcons pulled off a stunning second-half comeback to defeat the hosts 3–2 and clinch a record-extending tenth continental title.\nNdace described the premature and inaccurate report—announcing Nigeria’s loss before the game concluded—as both “erroneous” and “deeply unfortunate.”\n“Dear Esteemed Nigerians and Friends of Voice of Nigeria, on behalf of the management and staff of the Voice of Nigeria (VON), I extend my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who reached out with concern, support, and constructive feedback following the regrettable publication on our website on the night of Saturday, 26th July 2025, regarding the WAFCON 2025 Final between Nigeria and Morocco.\n“The erroneous report, which prematurely and falsely announced a Nigerian loss before the conclusion of the match, was both inaccurate and deeply unfortunate. Voice of Nigeria aligns with this historic moment, as our Super Falcons mounted a courageous comeback to defeat hosts Morocco 3–2, securing a record-extending tenth WAFCON title and affirming their place at the pinnacle of African women’s football”, the statement partly read.\nAcknowledging the confusion caused by the publication, VON expressed regret and hinted at the possibility of a cyber breach as part of the problem.\nIt continued, “We sincerely apologise for the misinformation and the confusion it caused. The integrity of our journalism is paramount, and we take this incident seriously. While initial reviews pointed to an internal lapse, we are also investigating the possibility of a security breach or identity theft through hacking, which may have contributed to this disturbing development. As a public institution, we cannot rule out such cyber threats and are taking appropriate steps to enhance the security of our digital platforms.”\nThe organisation clarified that no single staff member is being blamed, emphasising the need for systemic safeguards.\n“It is important to clarify that while internal editorial processes are being reviewed and strengthened, we are not placing sole responsibility on any individual staff member, including the sports reporter initially associated with the story. Rather, this episode underscores the need for comprehensive institutional safeguards to prevent such occurrences in the future”, it further stated.\nTo rebuild credibility and enhance content integrity, VON announced several structural reforms within its editorial team.\n“As part of our ongoing internal reforms, we have introduced key editorial structures, including an Investigative Desk, a Fact-Checking Unit, and a Monitoring and Evaluation Team. We have also undertaken strategic staff redeployments to enhance accountability, build resilience, and boost editorial efficiency across our platforms”, the DG assured.\nNdace said these steps are part of VON’s broader plan to reposition itself as a trustworthy and globally recognised public broadcaster.\n“These reforms reflect our broader commitment to repositioning VON as a more responsive, transparent, and globally respected media institution. At Voice of Nigeria, we embrace the responsibility that comes with being Nigeria’s official international broadcaster. We remain steadfast in our dedication to our three pillars: People, Platform, and Partnership”, he stated.\nHe also expressed gratitude to the public for their feedback, calling it a vital part of the organisation’s growth and accountability.\n“We are deeply thankful for your engagement. Your voices remind us that accountability is not a burden—it is a cornerstone of public service.\n“Once again, thank you for standing with us not just in times of national celebration, but also when we are called to reflect, correct, and improve”, the statement concluded.",
