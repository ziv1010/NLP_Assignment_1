  "body_text": "The late Ed Stinner and Lehigh softball coach Fran Troyan were good friends.\nWhen Stinner was the coach at Allen, several of his players went to Lehigh to play for Troyan and his wife, Sue, who was the previous Mountain Hawks head coach.\nKim Miller, Nina Rems and Mandee Wessner, who were all members of Stinner’s 1990 state championship team at Allen, also played at Lehigh where they enjoyed even more success.\nStinner and Troyan worked camps together and Stinner nearly went to Lehigh to join the staff, but his heart was dedicated to the players at the youth level and high school players in the Lehigh Valley, particularly at Parkland and Whitehall where he coached as an assistant after resigning at Allen.\nBut Kyle Stinner, Ed’s son, learned a lot about coaching from his father and also inherited his love of softball. It’s a family tradition since his mom, Melodie, played softball and his sister, Deanna, pitched Parkland to a state title in 2009 and played Division I softball at Temple.\nKyle Stinner was a great addition to Troyan’s staff for several years, and enjoyed his time but the travel was a bit too demanding.\nBut now he’s back at Lehigh and his father, who died in September at the age of 71, is surely looking down from above with great pride.\nStinner has been announced as Lehigh softball’s director of program development and will serve the program in an administrative and analytics-based leadership role.\nIn his new role, Stinner will focus on analytics, technology integration, recruiting support and overall program building.\n“Kyle is incredibly bright, able and a longtime fan of Lehigh softball,” Troyan said in a release. “Having someone who understands our culture and values, while also bringing a strong analytical mindset, gives us a real competitive advantage. His work this spring will help us edify and build our program in ways that will benefit Lehigh softball student-athletes immediately and for years to come.”\nSinner’s return, the release said, reinforces Lehigh’s commitment to innovation, development and sustained success on and off the field.\nTroyan begins his 31st season on Feb. 6 against Texas A&M-Corpus Christi in the Felsberg Invitational in Miami. He has an all-time record of 965-550-8 and has gone 413-97 in the Patriot League. His teams have won 19 Patriot League regular-season titles, 12 tournament titles and have made 11 NCAA tournament appearances.\nThe Mountain Hawks are coming off a 28-24 season. This year’s team will feature Maia D’Amico, a first-year player from Freedom.\nTroyan’s coaching staff includes Freedom High graduate Marisa DeStasio, who played at Binghamton for four years and then became a head coach at Muhlenberg College for six seasons and was an assistant at Lafayette for three years. She is in her second year on the Lehigh staff.\nThe staff also includes third-year pitching coach Dani Gonzales, who was a standout pitcher at Saint Joseph’s and then became an assistant coach at Penn for 11 seasons and was the interim head coach in 2023.\nRounding out the staff is Fran and Sue’s son David Troyan, who is entering his fourth season with the team and will be the sports performance coach after working as a volunteer assistant the last three years. David Troyan is also a Division I women’s basketball referee.\nNotre Dame-Green Pond Hall of Fame\nThe Hall of Fame ceremonies have been coming at a fast pace during the boys basketball season. Notre Dame-Green Pond held its ceremony on Jan. 10.\nThe new inductees included:\nCheryl (Muller) Fenton: A member of the class of 1975, Fenton has coached cheerleading at the school for 33 years with a one-year stint in 1984-85 and then since 1994.

Many of her girls have gone on to compete at the collegiate level, including Division I schools such as Virginia Tech, Seton Hall and Penn State.\nFrank Scattene: A member of the class of 1976, Scattene played football and was an Express-Times and Centennial League first-team running back. He ran for 1,180 yards as a senior. He started in the LARC All-Star Classic and was the school’s scholar-athlete representative to the National Football Foundation’s Lehigh Valley Chapter. In basketball, he was a three-year letterwinner and was a Centennial League second-team all-star and an honorable mention choice on the Express-Times All-Area team. He also was a letterwinner on the school’s first volleyball team. He currently leads the stat crew for Lehigh University football games at Goodman Stadium.\nScott Salabsky: A member of the class of 1994, Salabsky finished his career with 105 career wrestling wins.
