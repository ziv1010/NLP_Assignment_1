  "body_text": "Spurs 1-0 Leicester City (WSL) | Robert’s verdict: “It’s an important win”\nSun 17 March 2024, 19:30|Tottenham Hotspur\nRobert Vilahamn was pleased to secure an important three points in the Barclays Women’s Super League after a 1-0 win over Leicester City on Sunday afternoon at Brisbane Road.\nThe victory was our first in the league since January against West Ham United, where we ran out 4-3 winners, and maintains our push for a top five spot, six points behind Liverpool in fifth place.\nRobert handed Matilda Vinberg her first start in the WSL, coming in for Martha Thomas as she was ruled out with a minor injury, and the Sweden international certainly delivered on her opportunity as she netted her first goal for the Club inside the opening two minutes.\nIt was a superb free-flowing counter-attack move from us, starting with Becky Spencer and involved Celin Bizet, Drew Spence and Jess Naz in the build-up, with the latter’s cross latched onto by Matilda and she sent a composed finish past Lize Kop.\nThe well-worked move highlighted the style of football Robert has brought into Hotspur Way this season, so it was no surprise to see our boss full of praise for the winning goal and was delighted to pick up maximum points.\nWe made the right choices and we can take a lot of self-confidence from this.\nSpeaking to SPURSPLAY after the game, he said: “It’s an important win and, if you look at the table, those are some very important points. In the fixtures before Christmas, we would usually end this game in 1-1 because we gave away goals, but Becky was really sharp and we made the right choices, we win the game and we can take a lot of self-confidence from this.\nWhen asked about the impact of Matilda, Robert added: “She has looked sharper and sharper from the first day to now, and I thought it was the right time to hand her first start and her goal was amazing. Becky with the kick to Celin, she found Drew and that cross from Jess and the finish, it was a very beautiful goal.\n“We love that it’s with high quality, they are not lucky goals, but I still think we should have dictated the game more and we should have created more chances… however, it’s a good win and we are taking steps.”",
