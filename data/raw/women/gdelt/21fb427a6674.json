Ok yes, why shouldn't the top pro's also get those kind of contracts in the women's game but it seems quite obvious that it will also have detrimental effects towards the competitiveness of the pyramid. Wonder what will happen to team's like London City and Durham who do not have the financial backing gained from being the womens' team to a global mens' team. Having said that, I think our own owners will be backing the ladies to also be a WSL regular within the next 5-10 years. | | | |\n| Whilst Marc Guehi gets paid ┬Ż157 a minute... on 17:56 - Jan 28 with 1747 views | phillymark | Compared to major league baseball Kye Schwarber gets $30 million per year from the Phillies (fully guaranteed for the next 5 years) - I choose him because he is a designated hitter which means he never fields, he just bats and runs the bases if he gets a hit/walk etc Last year he faced 2869 pitches Which means he gets $10,456 PER PITCH faced.

If they're not then the same argument can be made for semi-pro footballers who have to work and play or match officials, who have to work whilst officiaiting games up and down the country as high as League 1 & 2 professional football. | | | |\n| Whilst Marc Guehi gets paid ┬Ż157 a minute... on 18:37 - Jan 28 with 1463 views | Hugoagogo_Reborn |\n| Whilst Marc Guehi gets paid ┬Ż157 a minute... on 18:20 - Jan 28 by Simonds92 | If they're working full 40 hour weeks, yes I agree.

The argument that the money at the top end of the men's game is obscene is fair, but it mainly just reflects the obscene revenue generated, and that revenue just isnt there in the women's second division. I honestly think that the amount of positive promotion and support given to the women's game is brilliant, and the standard is getting higher all the time, but the attempts to make salary comparisons sort of annoy me a bit. | |\n| |\n| Whilst Marc Guehi gets paid ┬Ż157 a minute... on 18:55 - Jan 28 with 1393 views | Simonds92 |\n| Whilst Marc Guehi gets paid ┬Ż157 a minute... on 18:37 - Jan 28 by Hugoagogo_Reborn | Surely it makes no difference, if it is pro-rata?

My point is, if they're working, say, 25 hours a week training, they shouldn't necessarily be getting their salary topped up just because they're footballers. They may need to have a part time job to follow their dream, and if they're good enough to be at the very top they'll be rewarded, just like non-league footballers in the mens game. However, if they are doing 40 hours a week training, doing kids coaching, schools, community stuff which equates to a full time job, they should be paid a decent living wage. | | | |\n| Whilst Marc Guehi gets paid ┬Ż157 a minute... on 19:07 - Jan 28 with 1348 views | Hugoagogo_Reborn |\n| Whilst Marc Guehi gets paid ┬Ż157 a minute... on 18:55 - Jan 28 by Simonds92 | I don't think you're necessarily disagreeing with me?

Businesses should never work that way. Yet there are still many people out there (some of my family members included) who would rather claw their eyes out than talk positively about and give any credit to the progress the WSL and the women's game in general has made let alone watch women's football. It just seems like such an extreme reaction. I don't particularly enjoy basketball, snooker, or squash, but I don't seek out media platforms to verbally hack them down two-footed for trying to progress in a sport. It's so bizarre. | |\n| |\n| Whilst Marc Guehi gets paid ┬Ż157 a minute... on 20:23 - Jan 28 with 1202 views | Swansea_Blue |\n| Whilst Marc Guehi gets paid ┬Ż157 a minute... on 18:37 - Jan 28 by Hugoagogo_Reborn | Surely it makes no difference, if it is pro-rata?

YouŌĆÖll be saying slaveryŌĆÖs bad next I donŌĆÖt know enough about the womenŌĆÖs game finances to know what a ŌĆśfairŌĆÖ wage should be. I do know the disparity between the haves and have nots is huge in both the menŌĆÖs and womenŌĆÖs leagues, and obviously the menŌĆÖs game is absurdly rich compared to the womenŌĆÖs. Lucy Bronze is one of the highest paid players on ┬Ż200k whereas the top English men are on ┬Ż15M+. That doesnŌĆÖt seem quite right given the coverage the womenŌĆÖs game gets. The womenŌĆÖs national team has been more successful than the menŌĆÖs too. | |\n| |\n| Whilst Marc Guehi gets paid ┬Ż157 a minute... on 20:33 - Jan 28 with 1175 views | Swansea_Blue |\n| Whilst Marc Guehi gets paid ┬Ż157 a minute... on 19:07 - Jan 28 by Hugoagogo_Reborn | Yeah, ok, I see that we are kind of on the same page. ¤śī I don't think anyone realistically thinks the women's game should be anywhere near wage parity with the men's, as the consumer base is nowhere near the likes of the EPL and the men's World Cup.

And the same will probably be true of all of the respective employees. Men's football is one of the highest paid sports on the planet. Women's football is growing massively - and that's brilliant and well-deserved after the suppression it has faced - but the market value of a business in a capitalist world will always dictate the wages on offer. I wonder, though, what wages could have been on offer in women's football now, without the 50 year ban.

They aren't \"guaranteed minimum wage\" is nonsense. Doesn't say the contracts have to be a minimum oif 20 hours, excluding eating time and matchdays, which presumably means training etc. So assuming they do 20 hours of that, the over 23's are getting ┬Ż25.86 (┬Ż26,900 / 1040 (52 x 20)) an hour?
