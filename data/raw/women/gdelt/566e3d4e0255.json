With six players, one coach, and one club nominated, the American league set a new record. It's not only about the talent-the confirmation of the NWSL as a hub of excellence on the global stage, not too dissimilar from the best European leagues.\nFollow MLS Multiplex on X (Twitter).\nBarbra Banda: Orlando Pride Powerhouse\nWhen one talks about the explosive striker in Orlando Pride, one speaks about the forwards that have shone bright in the NWSL. In just her very first full season, the race for the Golden Boot already sees the 23-year-old challenger in second place, having netted 12 goals in just 14 games. A lethal mix of speed and precision has turned her into one of the league's finest players. Besides that, her performance for Zambia internationally, especially at the Olympic Games in Paris with a hat-trick, really cements her standing in the world.\nThis spectacular season placed Banda among the contenders for the award, and nobody can turn a blind eye to what she did on the field. Comparing her to legendary players such as Cristiane and her Olympic record means her future is really bright.\nAlyssa Naeher: The Wall of the Chicago Red Stars\nOne thing we can say for sure is that security at the goal line goes hand in hand with Alyssa Naeher. Already, the Chicago Red Stars keeper has a stirring résumé with the U.S. Women's National Team, with clutch performances during the 2024 Paris Olympics. She is one of the best goalkeepers of all time thanks to her leadership, quick reflexes, and decision-making when out under pressure.\nShe's that kind of player who creates all the difference in critical matches, like that Olympic final against Brazil-her last-minute save secured the gold medal. Her recent nomination for Ballon d'Or was well deserved, marking her consistency and mastery between the posts.\nTrinity Rodman: The Rising Star\nTrinity Rodman is the future of women's soccer, representing the Washington Spirit. As it was said with her breakout performance in the league during her debut year, the clear message was that she is here to dominate. With her flair for dribbling, creativity, and goal-scoring instinct, Rodman has quickly established herself as one of the most exciting prospects, not only in the NWSL but in world soccer.\nRodman also dazzled at the Olympics, playing a pivotal role in the \"Triple Espresso\" that guided the U.S. to gold. Her goal against Japan in the quarterfinals proved to be the winning one and also epitomized her ability to rise to moments of greatest importance. Undoubtedly, Trinity is among the most exciting names on this year's nominee list.\nSophia Smith: The Future of Portland Thorns\nThe star for Portland Thorns is Sophia Smith, whose techniques have been refined by great vision. Smith was the top scorer in the NWSL in 2023 and has continued to post impressive performances in 2024. She finishes lethally and also looks to find her teammates constantly to distress the opponent's backline.\nSmith proved she had the talent to shine on the international stage, having been integral in the U.S.'s Olympic campaign. Her overtime goal against Germany was one of those moments that fans will never forget, making sure her career stays in the headlines for quite some time.\nMallory Swanson: The Speedster of the Chicago Red Stars\nNeither, for that matter, has Mallory Swanson, Naeher's teammate at the Chicago Red Stars, been lagging in her run for the Ballon d'Or. She runs on speed, terrorizing defenses every match. Stronger after overcoming a serious injury in 2023, she contributed a lot to the U.S.'s Olympic gold medal victory, including scoring the winning goal against Brazil in the final.\nThat strength and undoubted talent are reasons why Swanson needs to be there with the best in the world. She has gone ahead to form a brilliant understanding with Rodman and Smith in the U.S. attack.\nTarciane: Brazil and Houston Dash's Rising Star\nTarciane is a name that should be on everyone's lips now-a young defender currently playing her club football with Houston Dash. At 21, she has shown good maturity and a great reading of the game both in the NWSL and also for the Brazilian national team. She's an all-around player in terms of being decent in defense and also chipping in with some vital set pieces.\nTarciane was present to help Brazil's run to the silver medal in Paris, her first taste of global competition. Her nomination for the Ballon d'Or is an indication that Brazil's defense is in good hands for the future.\nJonatan Giráldez: The Maestro of Washington Spirit\nA new category included in the 2024 Ballon d'Or was the Best Coach, among the listings, Jonatan Giráldez, currently the head coach of the Washington Spirit. Having built a winning résumé at Barcelona Femení, Giráldez took his expertise to the NWSL and wasted no time making an impact, leading the Spirit to an improbable rise this season.\nHis work is the perfect example of what technical and tactical knowledge at high levels can bring into a growing league like the NWSL. The nomination reflects the respect he has built both in the U.S. and internationally.\nNJ/NY Gotham FC: A Club on the Rise\nMeanwhile, NJ/NY Gotham FC made headlines when it was named among the nominees for Best Club at the Ballon d'Or as the team's stock continues to rise in the NWSL. Fresh from a maiden league title, the club continues to punch above its weight and seal its place among the best teams in the world.\nWith a mix of domestic and international talent along with the grind for the title year after year, Gotham FC are surely going to be up there for many years.\nA New Era for Women's Soccer\nThe strong presence of the NWSL on the Ballon d'Or 2024 shortlist is a barometer of the growth of women's soccer in the United States and the quality of the league. Indeed, with talent coming out every season and more and more international impacts, the NWSL is once again on the sport's front burner globally.\nNow, all eyes will be on the final awards. But whatever the result, the fact that so many players, coaches, and clubs from the NWSL are in the spotlight shows that women's soccer is at its peak. The best part? This is only the beginning.",
