  "body_text": "Pope Francis dies at age 88: The world reacts\nPope Francis died Monday at age 88. History’s first Latin American pontiff charmed the world with his humble style and concern for the poor but alienated many conservatives with critiques of capitalism and climate change.\nFrancis suffered from chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man. He was admitted to a hospital on Feb. 14, 2025, for a respiratory crisis that developed into double pneumonia. He spent 38 days there, the longest hospitalization of his 12-year papacy.\nHe last appeared in public on Sunday with an Easter morning blessing and popemobile tour through a crowd of cheering thousands in St. Peter’s Square.\nHere’s the latest:\n‘I think he was a rebel’\nIn Francis’ hometown of Buenos Aires, Argentines gathered for Mass. Some cried. “I think he was a rebel. He may have been contradictory, but that was nice, too,” said worshiper Catalina Favaro.\nBishop Jorge García Cuerva told those gathered that “the pope of everyone has died. The pope of all humanity who insisted one and a thousand times that there must be room for everyone.”\nThe pope’s beloved soccer team — Buenos Aires club San Lorenzo, who nickname is “The Saints” — wrote “Goodbye, Holy Father” on its website. The team won the national championship in 2013, the year Francis was elected pope.\n‘His name in golden letters’\nAlgeria’s President Abdelmadjid Tebboune called Francis an “immense personality” and said he “wrote his name in golden letters in modern history.” Though Christians have been increasingly targeted for proselytizing in Muslim-majority Algeria, the Catholic Church enjoys official recognition.\nBiden and the Obamas remember\nFormer U.S. President Joe Biden says Francis was “unlike any who came before him. Pope Francis will be remembered as one of the most consequential leaders of our time, and I am better for having known him.” Biden, who is Catholic, called the pope a “challenging teacher” and “above all, he was a pope for everyone.”\nBiden had planned to visit Francis one more time before leaving office, but the trip was canceled because of wildfires in the Los Angeles area.\nMore in World\n“Pope Francis was the rare leader who made us want to be better people,” former U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, said. “He shook us out of our complacency and reminded us that we are all bound by moral obligations to God and one another.”\nMixed emotions in Ukraine\nIn Ukraine, there was a mix of sorrow and hope. “From a human point of view, it’s sad, of course,” said Valentina Sofilkanych in Lviv. “But as a Ukrainian, I hope the next Pope will be more pro-Ukrainian, we will feel more support from the church.” Francis tried to maintain the Vatican’s traditional diplomatic neutrality during the war there.\nSome saw meaning in the small details\n“He was a pope who was humble. When he visited Kenya, he rode in a very simple car,” said Ted Mutuku, a Catholic in the capital, Nairobi.\nVoices from the Middle East\nThe leader of the Catholic Church in the Holy Land, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, said Francis was always deeply interested in the region, and Gaza was “a symbol of Francis’ pontificate,” with the pope “always close to the poor, against the war.”\nThe Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem will hold a requiem mass on Wednesday with leaders of other major Christian sects.\nIn the occupied West Bank, Bethlehem Mayor Anton Salman said Francis worked to “restore the value and meaning of humanity.”\n‘The world’s conscience’\nThe pope was “in many respects the world’s conscience, never hesitating to challenge the powerful on behalf of the vulnerable,” said Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is Catholic. He noted the pope’s visit in 2022, when he apologized for the church’s cooperation with Canada’s policy of Indigenous residential schools, saying the forced assimilation destroyed their cultures.\n‘Love where there was hatred’\nBrazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said the pope “tirelessly sought to bring love where there was hatred. Unity where there was discord. And the understanding that we are all equal, living in the same house, our planet, which urgently needs our care.” Francis visited in 2013.\nThe soccer-loving pope\nGianni Infantino, president of soccer’s world governing body FIFA, noted the pope’s love for soccer and said that “all the prayers of the whole football world are with him.”\nA final appearance, a final goodbye\nItalian President Sergio Mattarella said Pope Francis’ final public act – an Easter morning blessing and popemobile tour through a crowd of thousands in St. Peter’s Square – in retrospect seems like his final goodbye to the church.\nCriticism over sexual abuse issue\nCritics of the Catholic Church’s handing of clergy sex abuse say the pope did far from enough.\n“Where Francis had supreme power, he refused to make the necessary changes,” said Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of the U.S.-based group BishopAccountability.\nDavid Clohessy, former national director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, noted the pope’s “prompt and impressive action” on other matters but said the pope’s “genial personality and warm demeanor distracted many from the unhealthy and still essentially unaddressed structural and cultural flaws in the church that cause kids to keep being hurt.”\nAs Catholic Church grows in Africa, many mourn\nMany across Africa have said they felt connected with the pope, who often spoke about issues at the heart of the region, from climate change to marginalization.\nThe pope was “very unambiguous in telling world powers to stop exploiting Africans,” said the Rev. Michael Nsikak Umoh, spokesperson for the Nigerian bishops’ association.\nIn Congo, where pope visited in 2023 to demand that foreign powers stop plundering Africa’s natural resources, Abbé Camille Esika in the capital, Kinshasa, said Francis “wanted to be the voice of the voiceless.”\nThe pope visited Africa five times, acknowledging the strong growth of the Catholic Church there. The South African Catholic Bishops’ Conference has encouraged all Catholics to pray for those choosing his successor.\nU.N. chief praises the pope’s example of ‘mutual understanding’\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a statement recalls that Pope Francis once said: “The future of humankind isn’t exclusively in the hands of politicians, of great leaders, of big companies … (it) is, most of all, in the hands of those people who recognize the other as a ‘you’ and themselves as part of an ‘us.’”\nGuterres adds that “Our divided and discordant world will be a much better place if we follow his example of unity and mutual understanding in our own actions.”\nPublic likely can start paying final respects on Wednesday\nThe Vatican says the general public likely can begin paying final respects to Pope Francis starting Wednesday in St. Peter’s Basilica. The date will be confirmed when cardinals gather for the first time after Francis’ death Tuesday morning.\nFrancis’ coffin will be moved from the chapel of the Domus Santa Marta hotel where he lived to St. Peter’s Basilica for public viewing. In a change ordered by Francis, the pope’s body will no longer placed on an elevated bier in the basilica. Rather, the wooden coffin will be placed facing the pews.\nNo date for the funeral has been announced. It must be held between four and six days after the death.\nVance’s team was ‘excited’ over meeting with the pope\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says Vance’s team expressed “how excited and grateful they were for the opportunity to have met with the pope just yesterday.” In an appearance on Fox News, she added that “it’s a solemn day for Catholics around the world, and we are praying for all those who loved the pope and believed in him.”\nTrump offers condolences\nPresident Donald Trump posted on Truth Social: “Rest in Peace Pope Francis! May God Bless him and all who loved him!”\nDalai Lama says Francis lived a simple but meaningful life\nThe Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama offered prayers, saying Francis dedicated himself to the service of others, “consistently revealing by his own actions how to live a simple, but meaningful life. The best tribute we can pay to him is to be a warmhearted person, serving others wherever and in whatever way we can.”\nOrthodox Christian leader says Francis wished for a greater unity of churches\nEcumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople, the leader of the Orthodox Christians, said Francis’ wish was for a greater unity with the Orthodox, calling him “a genuine friend of Orthodox Christianity.”\nHe mentioned their meeting in 2014, in which Bartholomew told Francis of the upcoming 1700th anniversary of the First Ecumenical Council and invited him, saying Francis “appeared enthusiastic.” But “it was not to be,” Bartholomew said, adding that he would welcome Francis’ successor.\nTurkish leader says Francis was dedicated to interfaith dialogue\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Francis was dedicated to building interfaith dialogue and addressing “human tragedies” such as the Palestinian issue and the war in Gaza.\n“A respected statesman, Pope Francis was also a spiritual leader who valued dialogue between different faith groups and took the initiative in the face of human tragedies, especially the Palestinian issue and the genocide in Gaza,” Erdogan wrote on social media. Israel has denied allegations of genocide in Gaza. Francis said such allegations should be investigated while also calling for a ceasefire and the release of hostages.\nIran’s president commends Francis’ position on the war in Gaza\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian offered condolences and praised Francis’ humanitarian stance including support for “innocent Palestinian women and children” in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\nIrish leader says Francis recognized every human’s essential dignity\nIrish President Michael Higgins says Francis’ recognition of the “essential dignity” of every human being helped him confront issues such as climate change and the plight of migrants, as well as the child sexual abuse scandal that has rocked the church.\nDuring his last visit in 2018, Francis spoke about the scandal that has undermined support for the church in the once overwhelmingly Catholic country.\n“On such matters, and on others such as attitudes towards women and those of the LGBTQ+ community within the Church, Pope Francis sought to play a positive role,” Higgins said. “I recall at the end of our meetings he would say as to his work on such issues, ‘it is very difficult’, as he asked for and offered prayers.”\nHead of World Jewish Congress calls Francis a true moral leader\nThe president of the World Jewish Congress, Ronald S. Lauder, described Francis as “a true moral leader, a man of deep faith and humanity, and a steadfast friend to the Jewish people.”\nLauder noted that in 2022, the congress’ executive committee had a private audience with the pope “where we launched the historic ‘Kishreinu’ (Our Bond) initiative, marking a new chapter in Catholic-Jewish relations and reinforcing the common future of our two peoples.”\nAlbania’s leader calls Francis the country’s great friend\nAlbania’s Prime Minister Edi Rama called Francis the country’s “great and unforgettable friend.” For his first European journey in 2014, Francis chose predominantly Muslim Albania — a visit that has become a symbol of interfaith dialogue.\nChurches in the Philippines ring bells to mourn Francis\nChurches in the Philippines, the largest Roman Catholic nation in Asia, rang their bells to mourn Francis.
