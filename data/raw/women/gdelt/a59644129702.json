The usual home of MLS side LA Galaxy was adorned with red, white and blue for the occasion — which later included the unveiling of a 20-foot statue of Alex Morgan in the likeness of the Statue of Liberty.\nAdvertisement\nAt the event, head coach Vlatko Andonovski and all 23 players selected to represent the four-time World Cup winners in Australia and New Zealand spoke to members of the media. Here are some of the key takeaways from the day.\nWho will be the next USWNT captain?\nThe answer isn’t available just yet — not officially. Andonovski was expected to announce the USWNT captain for the 2023 World Cup on Tuesday.\n“The decision has been made, and we were going to talk to the team last night, but not everybody was able to make it in on time because we had players coming from the East Coast who got here late,” said Andonovski. “I would want to talk to the players first before announcing publicly. Sorry.”\nIt was clear that forwards Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and midfielder Lindsey Horan will be Andonovski’s senior lieutenants in the locker room. The three players were rolled out in press conference format before other teammates joined in a roundtable layout.\nAll smiles in LA for World Cup Media Day😊 pic.twitter.com/TeejkGsbH9\n— U.S. Women's National Soccer Team (@USWNT) June 27, 2023\nMorgan is familiar with the role of captain, given her experience and stature on the team. The 33-year-old has 206 caps for the national team since making her debut against Mexico in 2010, scoring 121 goals – fifth in the nation’s all-time rankings. She is a two-time World Cup winner, an Olympic gold medalist, and the captain of the San Diego Wave, where she won the NWSL Golden Boot last season. Rapinoe’s winning experience makes her a valuable member of the squad, but she is currently nursing an injury and, at 37 years old, may not play as prominent a role as she did in 2019.\nDefender Becky Sauerbrunn, who normally holds the title, is unavailable for selection and will not be on the team for the tournament after reaggravating a foot injury in June with her club the Portland Thorns.\nAdvertisement\n“Take a moment wearing that armband and leading the team out there,” Sauerbrunn said in a video clip of her podcast with the Men in Blazers. “Everything has to bounce your way throughout your career to make it to a World Cup. Then to also be the captain and to lead that squad out there, it’s such an honor but also such a responsibility.”\nHoran, headed to her second World Cup, spoke about Sauerbrunn’s influence as a teammate on the Thorns and the national team in molding her as a leader.\n“I’m so, so sad for Becky. She was a huge role model for me and someone that took me under her wing and helped me with the leadership role,” said Horan. “My leadership role has changed a huge amount on the field, and I’ve worked more and more off the field. Going into a major tournament like this, it’s about doing my thing: who I am as a leader.\n“Not changing any bit because we, unfortunately, lost Becky. I’ll be the same Lindsey that I’ve always been, but do whatever I possibly can to help the team lift the trophy at the end of the day.”\nMegan Rapinoe expects to be fit for start of World Cup\nRapinoe, who is sitting on 199 caps for the national team, expects to be fit to start the World Cup.\nShe limped off the field in early June for OL Reign inside seven minutes against the Kansas City Current, grabbing her lower leg. She had suffered injury issues earlier in 2023 and sat out the USWNT’s January training camp.\n“The injury is going really well. It was quite minor. It was not amazing timing, but such is the life of an athlete,” Rapinoe said. “It’s nothing that I’m worried about for the start of the tournament. It feels like we’re here right now because we’re coming into camp, but we have a little bit of time and we’ll have time down in New Zealand before we get going. I’m feeling good, and training is going well, so I’m looking forward to getting back out there.”\nAdvertisement\nThe 2019 Ballon d’Or winner enters her fourth World Cup with her eyes set on a third title. While her role may be more rotational than she played in 2019, where she won the Golden Ball, she has had an excellent start to 2023 on the field, suggesting she still has a lot to give as one of women’s football’s most recognizable players.\n“First and foremost, when Pinoe is on the field, she’s a great player,” Andonovski said. “That’s the first reason why she’s on this team. Unfortunately, she got injured in the last game but the game before that she showed what she can bring to this team. She’s one of the most creative players I’ve ever seen and a true winner. She’s certainly a great player and that’s why we want her on the team. But also her experience and leadership is what she needs as well. She will have a role as a player, a leader and leading the leaders as well.”\nThe focus is on Vietnam\nThe USWNT kicks off its World Cup campaign against Vietnam on July 21 at Eden Park in Auckland, New Zealand. And, judging by the comments of Andonovski and the players, their focus lies squarely on their opening match — one they do not anticipate to be comparable to the 13-0 result against Thailand in 2019.\n“Looking at this tournament and games we’re going to be playing, you can’t compare our match against Thailand to any upcoming games,” said Morgan. “That tournament we started off with a bang.\n“We’re hopeful and optimistic that in this tournament we will be able to be successful. That’s what we’ve worked so hard towards these last four years. We have incredible respect for Vietnam.”\nVietnam is going into its first World Cup among the best sides in Asia, sitting fifth in FIFA’s continental rankings. In 2022, they reached the quarter-finals of the Asian Cup, losing 3-1 to eventual winners China. Currently, all but one of their players play their club football in Vietnam, but their 2-1 friendly defeat to Germany on Saturday highlights their potential to be a stubborn opponent for the USWNT.\n“They’re an incredibly organized team, and we can’t overlook the first match of the tournament,” Morgan said.\nAdvertisement\nAndonovski’s side will round out the group stage against the Netherlands in Wellington, New Zealand, before returning to Auckland to face Portugal.\n“It’s one of the hardest groups, if not the hardest group in the World Cup,” Andonovski said. “We have three teams that are very good. They’re all different types of teams with, in some ways, different philosophies and different styles of play which made it a little bit harder for us in the preparation for the group play because we had to dissect three different styles and approaches. We think that we have enough time to prepare for them separately. The goal is to win the group before we move to the ultimate goal.”\nGO DEEPER\nUSWNT World Cup roster breakdown: Who will shine brightest this summer\nAnd, if it was not clear. The ultimate goal is to add a fifth star to the national team’s crest.\n“Would I be happy with anything short of a third straight win? No,” Andonovski said, with a chuckle. “Absolutely not. There’s only one thing in mind going to this tournament – our goal is to win the World Cup.”\nInvesting in women\nThe USWNT has historically coupled its success on the field with the ability to affect change off it.\n“Having charter flights, having the best hotels, having all the recovery resources, having the money to provide that for players gives us the best opportunity to perform at our best and keep up with the level on the field that increases year over year,” said Rapinoe. “We’re fortunate to have that and we fought a lot for that over the years. To have an environment that allows for every team in the tournament to reach their full potential, that’s what it’s all about.”\nFIFA’s decision in 2022 to provide “the same conditions” and services for all female players and staff as their male counterparts was in part due to the USWNT efforts.\nWhile the new $110 million pot is just 25% of the $440 million paid out to the 32 national federations that participated at the Qatar World Cup, it is far beyond the $60 million pot that FIFA president Gianni Infantino previously promised in 2019.\nAdvertisement\nThe USWNT’s 2019 World Cup success was won with the backdrop of an equal pay lawsuit, accusing the United States Soccer Federation of “institutionalized gender discrimination” toward the team. While players from the USWNT settled their class action lawsuit for a total of $24 million in February of 2022, the senior leaders on the team say there is still a long way to go for equality.\n“The vibe is still the same, the vibe has been the same since 100 years ago. Just wanting to constantly strive for whatever the next thing is,” said Rapinoe. “This is not a team that does any sort of resting on its laurels, it’s always about the next game, the next area of progress, the next thing we can fight for using our platform and continuing on the field to be the best team that we possibly can. Being one of the best teams in the world, you’re always on that razor’s edge. The on-field is the most important thing and that’s been the fuel for the team always: striving to win every single game whether in practice or on the field.\n“Some of the players on the team now are never going to experience inequalities as a professional athlete under U.S. soccer,” Morgan added. “We actually just got our first settlement check in the mail a week ago. (Center back) Naomi (Girma) was joking that she didn’t get one and I was like, ‘Be grateful you don’t, you just get equal!’”\nThe upcoming World Cup will be the first Morgan will play as a mother, after giving birth to her daughter Charlie in 2020. Four years later, she became the highest-scoring mother in USWNT history, passing Joy Fawcett with the opener in a 2-1 win over Brazil in February. Fawcett, a member of the 1999 World Cup-winning team, held the previous record with 13 goals.\n“I’m really grateful for the women before me that fought for mom athletes. Joy Fawcett was the OG in that, and she had way less resources and support and was able to somehow become world champion and do many great things to create the legacy she has today,” said Morgan. “I have fought hard for female athletes to get the support and resources needed to continue to stay at the top of our game after having children.”\n(Photo: Keith Birmingham/MediaNews Group/Pasadena Star-News via Getty Images)",
