  "body_text": "The energy is exhilarating in both camps as Barbados Lady Tridents’ long-awaited return to international football competition is finally here, as they prepare to take on the highly rated Trinidad and Tobago Socca Warriors today at Kensington Oval.\nDuring a press conference at the Barbados Football Association Technical Centre in Wildey Sunday morning, both teams spoke ahead of the Concacaf W Qualifiers opening Group F kickoff match scheduled for 4 p.m. at the Mecca. Also in Group F with Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago are El Salvador and Honduras.\nHead Coach of Barbados women’s football team, Kerry Trotman, said the team has been working extremely hard, and their previous outings, including the Windward Islands Football Association tournament, which the Lady Tridents won, have helped preparation.\n“We are feeling good. The ladies have been working hard. We had a long break, and then we got back to it. We had the opportunity to go play some international friendlies in St. Vincent and the Grenadines in September. So, the ladies are excited and ready to try their tools at a stronger, more established national team,” Trotman said.\nDespite playing a few friendly matches in recent times, Trotman explained that the cohesion was not quite there, and therefore they did a lot more work on and off the pitch, and that helped the Lady Tridents in terms of the direction they wanted to go.\n“We are very happy now with everything. We have a vast variety of players, some old and some not so old, young. The ladies have been trying, and they are up for the task.\n“It is just to mesh young and experienced together, and hopefully we will see some good stuff come tomorrow, as it is our Independence weekend and the ladies are very excited,” Trotman explained.\nBarbados Captain and experienced midfielder Shanice Stevenson said the match, which falls a day after 59 years of Independence, makes this match even more desirable to win and give the Barbadian public something to celebrate and cheer about.\n“It is Independence time, so we just want to go out there and represent Barbados, make Barbados proud. Being one of the older players on the team, I have been here for a while, and it is just now to pass on the skills and knowledge to the younger players.\n“But during this time it is all about Pride and Industry, and we just want to make Barbados proud,” Stevenson said as she encouraged the public to come out and give their support.\nHead Coach of Trinidad and Tobago women’s football team, Damian Briggs, said since arriving in Barbados things have been going well.\n“It has been good being here so far. As a group we tried to take away the noise from the players and focus on what we have to do as a group. We had a good practice session yesterday as well.\nThe group settled in really well and we look forward to the game. The players are all buzzing and they are all excited. They are all up for the challenge and I just can’t wait for tomorrow’s game. We want to play exciting football,” Briggs told the media.\nAccording to Coach Briggs, Trinidad, with a group of 23 players, will aim to play as aggressively as they possibly can with a squad that is mixed with youth and experienced players.\n“We want to be as aggressive as we can off the ball, and when we are on the ball, we want to play exciting football and try to move the ball when we can. It would be good for us to start with a win. Positivity breeds positivity, and we look forward to that,” Briggs added.\nThe captain of Trinidad and Tobago women’s team, Kennya Cordner echoed the sentiments of her coach, saying the energy and vibes in the Soca Warriors camp are positive, and they are looking forward to the task ahead today against the Lady Tridents.
