  "body_text": "Trae Young's time with the Atlanta Hawks is over. A person with knowledge of the move says the Hawks have agreed to trade Young to the Washington Wizards for a package including veteran CJ McCollum. Corey Kispert is also heading from Washington to Atlanta. The person who confirmed the deal spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the trade had not received the required league approval as of Wednesday night. The Wizards held McCollum and Kispert out of their loss at Philadelphia on Wednesday night. Young was on the bench in street clothes for the Hawks’ game against visiting New Orleans.\nThe NFL coaching carousel may not be done spinning. Seven NFL teams are seeking a new head coach after Baltimore fired John Harbaugh on Tuesday. A couple more could join the search if their team is one-and-done in the playoffs. Harbaugh’s sudden availability after 18 seasons with the Ravens could create another opening. Multiple teams are interested in Harbaugh, including two clubs without current openings, two people with knowledge of the conversations told The Associated Press. Both people spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.\nATLANTA (AP) — The College Football Playoff semifinal at the Peach Bowl is a celebration of the Big Ten's strength with No. 1-seed Indiana facing No. 5-seed Oregon. The game is a rematch. Indiana won at Oregon 30-20 on October 11 to hand the Ducks their only loss. Indiana is undefeated. Each team is coming off dominant wins. Indiana overwhelmed Alabama 38-3 in the Rose Bowl as Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza threw three touchdown passes. The Ducks shut out Texas Tech 23-0 in the Orange Bowl. Brandon Finney Jr. had two interceptions and a fumble recovery.\nFRISCO, Texas (AP) — Jerry Jones' lofty Super Bowl goal sounds like more than his Dallas Cowboys can handle. Jones wants to be the owner with the most NFL championships despite New England's Robert Kraft having twice as many as his three. The Cowboys haven't even sniffed an NFL championship in the past 30 of 37 years under Jones. Dallas is coming off consecutive losing seasons, and Jones is 83. Even he acknowledges he might not have many NFL drafts left. And this one will be huge to try to fix one of the NFL's worst defenses.\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Steve Kerr upset his mother. Ann Kerr was mortified by the behavior of her 60-year-old son, for the first time in quite a while. She didn’t approve of Kerr's ejection in the fourth quarter of a one-point loss to the Clippers on Monday night, when the Warriors coach was held back from the officials by Gary Payton II, Gui Santos and assistant Terry Stotts. Kerr received back-to-back technical fouls and his fifth career ejection after becoming angry with official John Collins over a missed goaltending call.\nST. LOUIS (AP) — Alisa Efimova hopes to represent the United States at the Milan Cortina Olympics, but she needs to become a citizen first. She and her pairs partner, Misha Mitrofanov, delivered a stellar performance at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships on Wednesday. Efimova is from Finland. She and Mitrofanov were married in February 2024, and she received a green card in July of that year. She is seeking a waiver of the required three-year waiting period for citizenship. The finalized U.S. squad for the Winter Games will be announced on Sunday, and Mitrofanov says they are hoping for “a last-minute miracle.”\nHockey is set to be a highlight at the Winter Olympics, with NHL players returning for the first time since 2014 and top women’s players competing for the eighth time. The main arena will feature smaller ice than NHL players are used to. North American teams are the ones to beat, with stars like Sidney Crosby and Hilary Knight aiming for gold. Russia is barred from hockey due to the war in Ukraine, sidelining top players like Alex Ovechkin.\nBEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) — The teenage ski-racing triplets Helaina, Henri IV, and Henniyah Rivers are on a mission to represent their mother's country of Jamaica at the Winter Games. On top of that, they hope to open more doors for Black athletes in a predominantly white sport. It's a dream launched when their father found a pair of skis as a kid. Henri has already qualified for the slalom event, while his sisters are close. The triplets have traveled globally to chase races in an effort to qualify. Their story is often compared to the Disney movie, “Cool Runnings,” about the 1988 Jamaican bobsled team.\nGlenn Hall, a Hockey Hall of Famer whose streak of 502 consecutive starts as a goaltender remains an NHL record, has died at age 94. A spokesperson for the Chicago Blackhawks confirmed the team was informed of Hall's death from his family. A league historian in touch with Hall's son, Pat, said Hall died at a hospital in Stony Plain, Alberta, on Wednesday. A pioneer of the butterfly style of goaltending of dropping to his knees, Hall backstopped Chicago to the Stanley Cup in 1961. He won the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player of the playoffs in 1968 with St. Louis when the Blues reached the final before losing to Montreal.\nSAN ANTONIO (AP) — Keldon Johnson had 27 points, Victor Wembanyama added 16 points and 14 rebounds, and the San Antonio Spurs overcame 38 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists from Luka Doncic to beat the Los Angeles Lakers 107-91 on Wednesday night. San Antonio captured the battle for second place in the Western Conference despite shooting 4 for 24 on 3-pointers. LeBron James did not play. Jake LaRavia, with 16, and Jaxson Hayes, with 10, were the only other Lakers to score in double figures against the Spurs.\nFinals\nNATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE\nFinal Dallas 4 Washington 1\nFinal Montreal 4 Calgary 1\nFinal Utah 3 Ottawa 1\nFinal Chicago 7 St. Louis 3\nFinal OT San Jose 4 Los Angeles 3\nTOP-25 COLLEGE BASKETBALL\nFinal (1)Arizona 101 Kansas State 76\nFinal (3)Iowa State 70 Baylor 60\nFinal (4)UConn 103 Providence 98\nFinal (5)Purdue 81 Washington 73\nFinal (9)BYU 104 Arizona State 76\nFinal (11)Vanderbilt 96 (13)Alabama 90\nFinal (15)Arkansas 94 Ole Miss 87\nFinal (23)Virginia 84 California 60\nFinal Clemson 74 (24)SMU 70",
