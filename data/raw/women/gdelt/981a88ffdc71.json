All About Jessica Johnson\nBen Johnson has been married to his wife, Jessica Johnson, since 2014\nNEED TO KNOW\nBen Johnson, who has been the head coach of the Chicago Bears since 2025, is married to Jessica Johnson\nBen and Jessica met in high school in North Carolina and tied the knot in 2014\nJessica and their three children have supported Ben throughout his career and moved to Chicago with him in early 2025\nBen Johnson has had the support of his wife, Jessica Johnson (née Fleming), throughout his career.\nBen, whose Chicago Bears are vying for a spot in the 2026 Super Bowl, has been in a relationship with Jessica ever since high school. Both Ben and Jessica grew up in Asheville, N.C., and attended different colleges in-state.\nThe high school sweethearts tied the knot in 2014 and are parents to three children: Emory, Kennedy and Halle.\nAs Ben's career has taken him across the country, he's had the support of his wife — including when he moved them from Detroit to Chicago when he became the Bears head coach in January 2025.\nSo, who is Ben Johnson's wife? Here's everything to know about Jessica Johnson.\nBen and Jessica are high school sweethearts\nBen and Jessica each grew up in the Asheville, N.C., area and attended the same high school, A.C. Reynolds High School. Although they went to high school together, they each studied at different universities.\nBen walked on to the University of North Carolina football team as a quarterback and studied mathematics and computer science, per his Bears bio. Meanwhile, Jessica attended North Carolina State University.\nMore than two decades after Ben attended A.C. Reynolds, he still honors his high school football team by implementing their motivational saying in the Bears' locker room. Ben's own high school coach chanted the same phrase that he's since taken to the Bears: \"Good, better, best / Never let it rest / Till your good gets better / And your better gets best.\"\n\"I remember being in that locker room, and that was just the rallying cry at that time,\" Johnson told ESPN in January 2026. \"And I think there's something to be said when a group of men, they're all believing the same thing, they're saying the same thing.\"\nHe's since gotten the entire Bears team onboard, and they all frequently chant it in the locker room after wins.\nJessica previously \"dated\" country singer Chase Rice\nEven though Ben and Jessica are high school sweethearts, she had a brief \"date\" with country artist, Chase Rice. The \"Eyes on You\" singer revealed that he also attended the same schools as Ben and Jessica and joked that Ben \"stole\" her from him.\nRice visited the Johnsons in Detroit when Ben was still working as the Lions' offensive coordinator in December 2024.\nMore in Celebrity\n\"Proud as hell for my middle school through college QB Ben for Killin it all these years. I'm still mad he stole my middle school dance date from me and married her but it was great to see you too Jessica,\" he jokingly captioned pictures from the trip on X.\nWhile Ben was the quarterback for their high school team, Rice played as his star linebacker, and the two served as co-captains on the team. Both Ben and Rice went on to play at UNC together, and they've stayed close friends over the years. Ben and Jessica even watched Rice perform when he toured in Chicago over the summer of 2025.\nJust like Ben implemented the \"Good, better, best\" chant with the Bears, Rice now uses the phrase as a pre-show ritual with his bandmates.\nBen and Jessica share three children together and live outside of Chicago\nTwo years after Ben and Jessica got married in 2014, they announced that they were expecting their first child in November 2016. They became parents in 2017 when they welcomed daughter Emory.\nThe family of three expanded when they welcomed son Emory and later added daughter Halle to the mix. After Ben was announced as the Bears head coach in January 2025, he and Jessica purchased a $3.25 million six-bedroom home in Lake Forest, Ill., the Chicago Tribune reported. The couple bought the property after listing their four-bedroom home in Plymouth, Mich., in July.\nWhile Ben and Jessica mostly keep their kids out of the spotlight, Ben told the Bears ahead of Father's Day that some of his favorite moments have been exploring Chicago as a family. Ben also reflected on fatherhood and shared that he's taken much of how he was raised and tried to apply it to his own kids.\n\"There were times when I was young, where I might not have liked what [my father] was saying or how he was saying it,\" Ben said. \"But when I look back at it, it was the best thing for me. It's what I needed to hear, and I keep that in mind when I talk to my own kids. I want them to know that I'm proud of them and I love them to death, but at the same time, I want them to be ready for the real world down the road as well. It's always a balancing act and I wish I had all the answers.\"\nMeanwhile, Ben's father, Don Johnson, told the organization that he has loved becoming a grandfather while also watching Ben become a father.\n\"That's the really rewarding part,\" Don said. \"From my role being the dad and kind of the trendsetter for a lot of things in our family, I get to watch the trendsetter now. Ben can use me as a sounding board if he wants to. But I understand that my role as a grandpa is just to give those kids a sounding board of their own if they need it.\"\nHe continued, \"I try not to discipline them — I can talk with them sternly if I need to, but I don't need to very often. So that's a real good thing. It's a sign for me that their dad and mom are doing a great job of preparing them for what they need to get done.\"\nThe couple made a pact to not go consecutive weekends without seeing each other\nAs Ben's career has skyrocketed over the last few years, he and Jessica have also made sure to prioritize their marriage and family life.\nBen told the Bears organization that he and Jessica agreed to not go two weekends in a row without seeing each other. As of the 2025-2026 season, they found a way to follow that pact.\nBen specifically recalled a favorite moment with his family over Memorial Day weekend when they visited some of Chicago's tourist attractions, including the Navy Pier Ferris Wheel and the Shedd Aquarium.\nBen expressed his gratitude for Jessica’s support and uprooting their lives to Chicago\nAfter six years with the Detroit Lions, Ben was promoted to the Bears head coach in January 2025. When he was introduced as the head coach on Jan. 22, his entire family supported him at the press conference.\nBen was pictured walking in and holding hands with Kennedy, while Jessica held Halle and Emory walked in with a teddy bear, per the Chicago Tribune. As Ben thanked several people for helping him accomplish the career milestone, he specifically acknowledged that his family is \"one of the biggest pieces of the puzzle.\"\n\"It doesn't take long to realize that this place is special,\" Ben said of Chicago. \"These people are special. This is exactly where I wanted to raise my family, my kids. I know we're going to have so much fun living up here in Chicago.\"\nAlthough he expressed his excitement over the move, he also admitted that it was \"hard to uproot a great situation\" they had in Detroit, so saying goodbye to their former home was \"emotional.\"\n\"That place had been so special to my family,\" he told the Bears organization. \"It's hard for a mother to want to uproot her kids when they were really thriving in that location. It's a hard thing to deal with. I know she was feeling emotional, and I'm so grateful that she had the understanding and the ability to say, 'Hey I trust you and I'll go along with you.' \"\nJessica has since embraced the Bears and the city. In October 2025, she attended her first Bear Wives Luncheon, where she received a historical hand-sewn Bears patch.\n\"It's such an honor to be presented with a patch that has so much history,\" Jessica told the Bears organization at the time. \"To give all the women here today a different glimpse into where it all started, the memories, the hard work and the history of this franchise is special. I know we will all wear the patch with honor knowing we get to be a part of such an incredible organization and family.\"\nRead the original article on People",
