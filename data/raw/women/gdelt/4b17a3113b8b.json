  "body_text": "Travis Hunter has found a new home in the NFL, but he was given one more award in college football on Monday night.\nDuring the 25th annual CU Sports Performers of the Year (CUSPY) Awards, the now former Colorado star was named the male athlete of the year in the athletic department for the second year in a row. Jordan Nytes, the goalkeeper for the soccer team, was named the female athlete of the year.\nThe event, organized by organized by CU’s Student Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) for the 2024-25 athletic year, had over 350 student-athletes, coaches, staff and C-Club board members in attendance.\nHunter, who was selected No. 2 in the NFL Draft on Thursday by the Jacksonville Jaguars, was the most decorated player for a single season in college football history last fall.\nIn addition to becoming the second Heisman Trophy winner in CU history, the star receiver/cornerback won the Chuck Bednarik Award and Lott IMPACT Trophy for defense, the Biletnikoff Award (top receiver), a second Paul Hornung Award (most versatile player) and won the Associated Press and Walter Camp Player of the Year honors.\nHunter was a unanimous first-team All-American (and all Big 12 Conference) selection, and was the Big 12 defensive player of the year. Playing over 1,400 snaps between offense, defense and special teams, he caught 96 passes for 1,258 yards and a record 15 touchdowns, with 36 tackles, four interceptions and 11 pass deflections on defense. He was also a two-time Academic All-American.\nLast year, Hunter shared male athlete of the year honors with basketball player KJ Simpson, now with the NBA’s Charlotte Hornets.\nNytes was named the Big 12 goalkeeper of the year last fall and was a third-team All-American as selected by the United Soccer Coaches. She also earned the Sportswomen of Colorado’s Collegiate Player of the Year honor, and was a five-time Big 12 Goalkeeper of the Week.\nLast season, Nytes started all 22 games and helped CU to a 12-5-5 record, racking up 101 saves in allowing just 22 goals. Her save percentage of .821 ranked second in the conference, as did her 11 shutouts. She made seven saves in CU’s 3-2 win over Georgia in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\nOther men’s finalists were senior golfers Justin Biwer and Dylan McDermott, junior Isaiah Givens (track), senior Julian Hammond III (basketball) and sophomore Filip Wahlqvist (alpine skiing). Women’s finalists included Tilde Baangman (Nordic skiing), Ema Bubalo (tennis), freshman Sydney Givens (golf) and Jade Masogayo (basketball).\nBiwer was honored for the male career athletic achievement Award. He currently holds 21 school records and could set more. His 69.50 stroke average for 34 rounds this season leads CU and the Big 12 and is third in the nation. His 28 career top 20 finishes rank first all-time, as do his rounds of par or better (99) and subpar rounds (80, 47 in the 60’s).\nWomen’s basketball senior Frida Formann earned the female career athletic achievement award. Although she missed 16 games with a foot injury this past season, Formann leaves CU as the program’s all-time leader in 3-point field goals made (300 of 779), with her percentage of .385 fourth-best in school history (but first for those with 600 or more attempts). She is 13th in career points, with 1,538.\nMale freshman of the year went to football offensive tackle Jordan Seaton. He earned freshman All-America honors from On3, 247 Sports and Pro Football Focus, and the Big 12 coaches named him as the honorable mention pick for both the offensive lineman of the year and the freshman of the year.\nFemale freshman of the year honors were shared by golfer Sydney Givens and alpine skier Louison Accambray.\nGivens led the Buffs in stroke average (73.59), as well as in stroke average in relation to par (+1.59), both school bests by a freshman. Accambray was the RMISA most valuable skier for the giant slalom, earning second-team All-America honors at the NCAA Championships in both the giant slalom (ninth place) and the slalom (seventh). She was the first CU skier ever to win her first three collegiate giant slalom races.\nNewcomer of the year awards went to LaJohntay Wester, a senior receiver for the football team who transferred to CU from Florida Atlantic; and junior Nordic skier Tilde Baangman.\nLacrosse player Samantha Lipka was presented with the Spencer Nelson Buffalo Spirit Award named for the CU skier who died in a tragic hiking accident in August 2010.\nSeveral other awards were handed out during the night.
