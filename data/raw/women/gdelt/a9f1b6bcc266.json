  "body_text": "Soccer\nThe shock sacking of Seaford United senior coach Paul Williams and five new signings for Mornington have grabbed the headlines this week.\nAdd to that confirmation from Chelsea that coaching legend Gus Macleod will continue as head coach and there’s been plenty to talk about in local football circles.\nLast week’s bombshell announcement that Williams had fallen victim to his club’s end-of-season review was unexpected given that his last three seasons as senior coach have seen the club consistently in the top four.\nWilliams guided Seaford to a second-placed finish in 2023, fourth in 2024 and second this year.\n“I’m not going to hide the fact that I was hurt at what happened but I’m not going to criticise the club that I’ve played for at various levels and I have many, many friends there,” Williams said.\nThere is a view that some in the administration had their sights set on Williams and didn’t miss.\nHe was shown the door last week after meeting with club president Karyn Pert and treasurer Chris Daly.\nPert has been asked a number of questions about the review and the decision to dump Williams but she has not addressed them, adding to the intrigue surrounding Williams’ departure.\nThe official line from the club is that the decision not to re-appoint Williams was based on player feedback and a need to bridge a perceived gap between the men’s and women’s senior programs.\nThere is no way of checking the authenticity of this claim of negative feedback and judging by the flood of text messages and voicemail messages Williams was inundated with after his dismissal, he had the support of the senior squad.\nThat’s likely due to Williams overseeing the men’s most successful season since Seaford won the State 4 South championship in 2013.\nWhen Pert took over from long-serving president Willie Lyn in late 2023, she made it clear that she believed the club focussed too much on the men’s program to the detriment of the women’s program and she intended to redress that imbalance.\nWilliams was seen as a flag-bearer for the senior men’s program, which put him at odds with Pert, and this is believed to have been a crucial element in his sacking.\nThe committee is understood to be considering lowering the men’s playing budget in order to boost the budget for the successful women’s senior side, which now plays in State 1.\nThis decision already has caused unrest among the senior men’s playing group. It could trigger a player exodus from the senior men’s squad and the club’s recent history shows how damaging this can be.\nEarly favourites to take on the senior coaching role are reserves coaches Jason Alizzi and Paulo Pinheiro. The latter is a former Seaford senior coach.\nThere’s much more stability at Dallas Brooks Park where Seagulls gaffer Adam Jamieson has been busy adding to his squad for another tilt at the State 1 South-East title and a long-awaited promotion to Victoria’s elite club competition.\nEthan Goulding and Campbell Steedman have joined from Peninsula Strikers, Kostas Droutsas has switched from Bayside Argonauts, while his brother Chris joins from Bentleigh Greens, and Joe Hunt also joins from Bentleigh Greens.\nGoulding, Steedman and Kostas Droutsas are former Mornington players. “The (Droutsas) twins are very good footballers who can play anywhere across the midfield,” Jamieson said. “Kostas is x-factor, a real talent. “He wants to take players on and create things which is something we didn’t have a lot of.\n“Chris is a really good all-round footballer. “Technically he’s very good and he’s very sharp – he can do things going forward and do things going the other way as well.\n“I was really disappointed to lose Campbell a couple of years back as he’s got something we don’t have – serious pace. “He’ll play up high in a two or wide in a three.\n“Ethan is probably the best young talented footballer on the peninsula and we’ll use him as a central midfielder.\n“Joe played every game for Bentleigh Greens this year in their promotion side so it’s been a big get to bring him down here.\n“Unfortunately Ziggy (Razuki) has retired so Joe will slot right into the left-back role.”\nJamieson also has his sights set on an attacking midfielder from VPL2.\nKane Runge had an outstanding season, winning the club’s best and fairest award and will again be the number one goalkeeping choice, while his deputy, Jarrod Nardino, is yet to agree but Jamieson is keen to retain him and talks are ongoing.\nNathan Peel will again assist Jamieson, but there’s a “new” face on the scene in former player Marinos Panayi.\nMornington vacates Dallas Brooks Park next week as a $10 million facelift gets underway.\nThe end result will include four new pitches and Jamieson believes it will transform the club’s profile.\n“I think it will change the club’s prospects significantly,” he said.\nMornington will be hoping that when it returns to its home ground it will be as a VPL2 club, but where it plays its home games next season is still to be decided.\nIn State 4 news, Chelsea re-appointed Macleod last week along with assistants Ronnie Whitton and Chris Porteous.\nSam Arcuri is reserves coach and his assistant is Marek Boccari.\nOnce more, ace goalscorer James Stinson is in the pre-season spotlight with the expectation that he will receive attractive offers from other clubs.\nStinson scored 36 goals in State 4 South this year, winning the league’s Golden Boot award in a canter as the runner-up was Mentone striker Marcus Spivey with 18 goals.\n“I hope he’ll stay,” Macleod said. “He’s well treated here and he’s well liked.\n“If he wants to go for the money, there’s nothing we can do about that but I think he’d enjoy being here next year if we can take the next step and try and win the thing.”\nMacleod is likely to bring in three or four fresh faces to an already talented squad with a view to improving both in quality and depth.\nAt Chelsea’s recent presentation night, Stinson was the big winner collecting the senior player of year, players’ player and Golden Boot awards.\nAdam Dunsford was player of the year runner-up.\nIn the reserves, Matteo Barba and Luca Fidanza were joint winners of the player of the year award and Chris Neumann was runner-up.\nAndrew Jencik won the players’ player award and the Golden Boot.",
