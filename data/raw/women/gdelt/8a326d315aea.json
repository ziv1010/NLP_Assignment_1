There’s even some high stakes drama mixed in for good measure, as Oscar winner Colin Firth leads the cast of Lockerbie: A Search for Truth — a thrilling event series about the tireless efforts of a father's efforts after his daughter is killed in a plane crash.\nArriving on Peacock on January 2, Lockerbie: A Search for Truth sets Firth in the starring role as Dr. Jim Swire, a father who spearheads a fact-seeking movement for bereaved families after losing his own daughter in the Pan Am Flight 103 explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland. The actual 1988 tragedy claimed the lives of 259 people, alongside 11 Lockerbie residents who perished in the path of the disaster. Dr. Swire’s search for the truth will take him across continents and even face to face with the Libyan leader linked to the terrorist attack, while taking a personal toll on the sweeping international incident's individual survivors — including his wife Jane (Catherine McCormack).\nRELATED: Everything to Know About Peacock's Lockerbie: A Search for Truth Starring Colin Firth\nCelebs, reality stars, and even an English lord! The conniving new cast members already are sharpening their treacherous knives as The Traitors brings Peacock’s all-original Emmy-winning reality competition back to the bird app for a hugely anticipated third season. Hosted by Alan Cumming with a wicked wit that’s perfectly suited to the whole murder-mystery vibe, Season 3 of The Traitors features even bigger creative ways to make everyone seem like a suspect inside Cumming’s creepy Scottish castle. The stakes are definitely higher than ever as a batch of 21 new contestants vies for the chance to take home up to $250,000 in prize funds… so long, that is, that they’re willing to get their hands nice and dirty.\nRELATED: The Traitors Experience to Reopen Its Doors to All You Traitors and Faithful: Ticket Details & More\nIf you ever wondered what was going through Will Ferrell’s mind on Saturday Night Live as Christopher Walken hilariously clamored for more cowbell, tune in on January 16 when SNL50: The Anniversary Special! goes behind the scenes to explore 50 years’ worth of SNL history from the mad-genius comedy minds who make it all happen. Spread across four installments all ready to stream at once, the Peacock original series packs in rare footage, interviews with celebrity hosts, and oodles of insight from SNL writers and cast members — both past and present — who’ve been keeping America up late (and laughing) for an amazing half-century.\nRELATED: Every Musical Guest for Saturday Night Live Season 50: Gracie Abrams, Hozier\nBy mid-January, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish might just be getting their game face ready to contend for college football’s ultimate prize… or else, they’ll be fresh off a loss to knock them out of playoff contention ahead of the January 20 national championship game. Either way, the timing couldn’t be better for the seventh and final installment in Peacock’s Here Come the Irish docu-series to arrive on January 16, chronicling one of sports’ most storied programs through unprecedented exclusive behind-the-scenes access.\nRELATED: Notre Dame vs. Georgia College Football Playoff Quarterfinal: Everything to Know\nThere's tons more new content streaming on Peacock in January, including a compelling look deep inside hip-hop history when Diddy: The Making of a Bad Boy premieres on January 14. Season 2 of Love Island All Stars arrives on January 15, followed on January 16 by the kid-pleasing toy tech that powers Team Mekbots: Animal Rescue (Season 1). And just in case you missed it, catch Eddie Redmayne as a suave international assassin in Season 1 of Peacock’s critically-acclaimed The Day of the Jackal — the better, of course, to stay sharp and on point for the series’ already-announced second season!\nHere’s a look at everything streaming on Peacock in January 2025\nTitles marked with “*” are exclusive to Peacock.\nPeacock January Highlights\nJanuary 2: Lockerbie: A Search For Truth (Peacock Original)*\nJanuary 9: The Traitors, Season 3 -
