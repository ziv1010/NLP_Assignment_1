In 2001, Chris Anderson’s Sapling Foundation acquired TED and repositioned it as a nonprofit committed to spreading ideas that aim to change the world. From sharing free content online, to scaling community reach with the launch of TEDx, to expanding formats (hello, TEDNext), TED's live events are leaving a legacy far beyond the stage. What began as a conference has truly evolved into a cultural phenomenon.\nLIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD\n#DesignForDigital and Beyond: Cara Kleinhaut’s Experiential Marketing Legacy\nSubmitted by AGENC\nPhoto: Courtesy of AGENC\nCara Kleinhaut launched her woman-owned agency, AGENC, in 2003 and has since helped shape experiential marketing into a cultural and commercial force. She coined the term #DesignForDigital as an early adopter of influencer-driven experiential; has built longstanding partnerships with clients like Dior and the Essence’s Black Women in Hollywood Awards (which her team produced for 16 years); and made headlines for work like the custom-built \"Mountain Village\" for Paramount/CBS during Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas.

Standout details included a vanilla espresso martini fountain, a cotton candy \"studio\" that blended edible art with fragrance, and a blooming tea ceremony cart. But what really made it special? As this took place in Los Angeles not long after the devastating wildfires from earlier this year, the event featured a \"Give Back Bar\" in partnership with Project Glimmer, helping restore wellness essentials to displaced families.\nBEST BRAND COLLABORATION EVENT\nClover x Shark Tank Summit\nSubmitted by Clover\nPhoto: Courtesy of Clover\nThe inaugural Clover x Shark Tank Summit was created as a first-of-its-kind event to equip small business owners with the tools, insights, and connections to help them defy the odds. This was an experience where fandom met function. The summit merged the cultural power of Shark Tank with Clover’s mission to empower small businesses, offering a blueprint for the next generation of entrepreneur events.\nBEST BRAND/PRODUCT LAUNCH\nJeep Cherokee Reveal: Jeep 4x4 City Camp\nSubmitted by George P. Johnson Experience Marketing\nPhoto: Courtesy of George P. Johnson Experience Marketing\nStaged in the heart of Brooklyn, N.Y., this launch event for the 2026 Jeep Cherokee went far beyond brand awareness—it was about cultural reclamation. To honor the legacy of the iconic SUV, George P. Johnson Experience Marketing and G7 Entertainment Marketing created era-themed installations spanning the 1970s to 2000s and a floating off-road course on the East River (pictured). From the barge to the branded vignettes, everything was crafted to push the boundaries of traditional auto marketing.\nBEST CANNES LIONS BRAND ACTIVATION\nPinterest Manifestival\nSubmitted by Pinterest\nPhoto: Courtesy of Pinterest\nPinterest has turned heads (and phone cameras) for many years at Cannes Lions, one of the world's top events for creative marketing professionals. This year was no exception. Pinterest Manifestival was open to all, a deliberate choice that broke with the norm of the many invitation-only spaces at Cannes Lions. It aimed to mirror the positive, inclusive environment Pinterest fosters online. The result was a brand presence that felt accessible, optimistic, and participatory. \"More than anything, I appreciate the personalized approach and how there was an intentional effort to focus on a certain generation because of their impact and engagement with the brand,\" one of our EEA judges said about this submission. \"There was an obvious 'this is for you!' approach, and it showed in the results.\" See BizBash's previous coverage of Pinterest Manifestival here.\nBEST CES BRAND ACTIVATION\nBOSE Immersive Brand Experience CES\nSubmitted by Mirrored Media\nPhoto: Courtesy of Mirrored Media\nFor CES 2025, Bose offered a white-glove demo experience to attendees. Produced by Mirrored Media, its activation at the consumer electronics show transformed the T-Mobile Arena—typically an ice hockey venue—into a cutting-edge Bose-branded space that allowed it to demonstrate the future of its automotive audio technology in an interactive setting. One EEA advisory board member called it \"an innovative way of breaking through at a very dense event\" and gave kudos to its premium build and detailed touches. See BizBash's previous coverage of Bose at CES here.\nBEST COACHELLA BRAND ACTIVATION\nPinterest at Coachella\nSubmitted by Pinterest\nPhoto: Courtesy of Pinterest\nThe fact that Pinterest can create major buzz at not one but two major cultural festivals is a testament to its live events prowess. For this year's Coachella, the brand created a destination for discovery and transformation that invited attendees to try on and remix Pinterest’s top fashion and beauty trends, so their most authentic festival selves could come to life. Highlights included a \"stereopunk\" CCTV zone that multiplied a person's image across stacked monitors and a fairyland diorama with scaled props and nested frames. See BizBash's previous coverage of Pinterest at Coachella here.\nBEST CONFERENCE OR CONVENTION\nCanva Create 2025\nSubmitted by Public School, Creative Studio\nPhoto: Courtesy of Public School, Creative Studio\nThis is the second year in a row that Canva Create has taken home this award, and it's not hard to see why. \"In a world saturated with AI features, Canva is delivering experiences that make the technology feel deeply relevant to human connection and the human condition,\" one of our EEA judges said. Following the public debut of Canva Create in 2024, the bar for its sequel was set sky-high. This year, the event expanded in both footprint and format but still felt cohesive, useful, and energizing at every touchpoint. See BizBash's previous coverage of Canva Create 2025 here.\nBEST CORPORATE EVENT CONCEPT\nBest of Quest by Power Home Remodeling\nSubmitted by Power Home Remodeling\nPhoto: Courtesy of Power Home Remodeling\nPower Home Remodeling's version of a corporate retreat is certainly unique (just take it from this pictured three-story trust fall). The company's massive end-of-year celebration, called Quest, is one part music festival, one part wellness retreat, and one part beach vacation. Its December 2024 iteration was its biggest yet and included a three-day music festival with an A-list lineup of artists (like Post Malone and Weezer), interactive art installations, and daily workouts. Surprise and delight was woven into nearly all aspects of this employee appreciation event.\nBEST CULTURAL/MULTICULTURAL EVENT\nApartment Therapy x Walmart Mainstays Mujeres Event\nSubmitted by Apartment Therapy\nPhoto: Courtesy of Apartment Therapy\nThis past spring, Walmart and Apartment Therapy teamed up to celebrate the Becky G & Alejandra home collection—while also spotlighting the often-overlooked personal milestones of Latina creators. To mark the launch, Apartment Therapy hosted an intimate event called Mainstays Mujeres, where the brands partnered with four Latina design influencers to curate vignettes throughout the home with Walmart products. Each designer created a space that commemorated an important moment on their individual path to success. The event and content worked in unison to reach a wide audience of home design enthusiasts, Walmart shoppers, and supporters of the Latina community. See BizBash's previous coverage of the event here.\nBEST EVENT APP\nvFairs Event App: The Ultimate Tool for Engagement and Seamless Event Navigation\nSubmitted by vFairs\nPhoto: Courtesy of vFairs\nThe vFairs Event App is a tool for attendees, exhibitors, sponsors, and organizers for on-site events. Standout features include an AI assistant, multilingual support, gamification features, and lead capture.\nBEST EVENT DECOR\nUno Social Club Las Vegas\nSubmitted by Mirrored Media\nPhoto: Courtesy of Mirrored Media\nThere are many aspects of the Uno Social Club Las Vegas that make it award-worthy, and one of them is certainly its attention to detail. Global toy brand Mattel teamed up with Mirrored Media to celebrate its classic card game Uno by creating the ultimate gaming experience. Enter: Vegas. A suite at the Palms Casino Resort was transformed into the Uno Social Club, complete with playful Uno-themed art and decor. The space featured custom rugs and wall art with decals on the mirrors, windows, and walls. The bowling alley featured custom bowling balls lined up in Uno colors; bunk beds were also decked out in Uno colors. Even the shower, bathmats, soaps, and mirrors were all converted to the theme. See BizBash's previous coverage of the Uno Social Club Las Vegas here.\nBEST EVENT ENTERTAINMENT ACT\nOfficina Maranello\nSubmitted by Cirque Berzerk Productions\nPhoto: Courtesy of Cirque Berzerk Productions\nCirque Berzerk Productions aimed to redefine live entertainment by using theatrical storytelling to bring the creation of Ferrari’s iconic V12 engine to life. Its show in Abu Dhabi comprised innovative set pieces, an LED video wall, and inspired choreography that led a multicultural audience through each phase of the engine build and factory.\nBEST EVENT TECHNOLOGY/PRODUCT/SERVICE\nBlink ExperienceOS - SXSW London 2025\nSubmitted by Blink\nPhoto: Courtesy of Blink\nSXSW's first European edition, SXSW London 2025, needed an event tech platform that could channel its creative energy into something operationally flawless, while guiding thousands of attendees through hundreds of sessions, venues, and activations. It turned to Blink ExperienceOS, a modular, end-to-end platform built to manage layers of complex, any-scale events, covering operational control and personalized attendee engagement within one ecosystem. The app helped the festival feel personal, navigable, and engaging without ever losing the spontaneity that defines SXSW. \"What stands out in this submission is the app's ability to create personalized experiences and itineraries for each individual through AI,\" one EEA judge said. \"While this isn't new to the industry, as many apps are leaning in or have been leaning in this direction, it's great to see usage at scale.\"\nBEST FAIR/FESTIVAL\n400 Conejos Mezcal y Mischief Festival Tour\nSubmitted by POPLIFE\nPhoto: Courtesy of POPLIFE\nMezcal brand 400 Conejos, with the help of POPLIFE, ran the Mezcal y Mischief Festival Tour from March through October this year.

The goal was to transform the complex (and often dry) subject of financial management into an engaging journey of self-discovery and manifestation. Attendees first took a personality quiz to see which one of five financial archetypes they fit, before being matched with a Cash App card. On-site local artists could then customize the cards for them. The goal was to champion financial literacy and accessibility, especially for young women of color, who have historically been underserved by mainstream institutions.\nBEST FLORAL DESIGN FOR AN EVENT OR MEETING\n\"Futura Florentia,\" The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society’s 2025 PHS Philadelphia Flower Show Entrance Garden\nSubmitted by Pennsylvania Horticultural Society\nPhoto: Courtesy of Pennsylvania Horticultural Society\nThe Philadelphia Flower Show, the nation's largest horticultural event, returned this past spring with the theme \"Gardens of Tomorrow,\" aiming to intertwine the metaphorical vines of innovation and nature. That notion was certainly on display at the show's entrance garden, \"Futura Florentia,\" created by the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society and GMRdesign. Attendees entered through a glowing arch tunnel made of 30 LED light arcs before standing under a circular, botanical chandelier made of 450 strands of flowers. The scene also featured 24 white Yoshino cherry trees, which were later donated to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, extending the life of the design beyond the show. See BizBash's previous coverage of the 2025 Philadelphia Flower Show here.\nBEST GUERRILLA MARKETING INITIATIVE/MARKETING CAMPAIGN\nHeineken 0.0 Unjudged\nSubmitted by Amplified Marketing\nPhoto: Courtesy of Amplified Marketing\nBeverage brand Heineken promoted its alcohol-free product, Heineken 0.0, during the US Open by reciting positive affirmations and passing out samples to New York foot traffic at Grand Central Terminal, Hudson Yards, and the Seaport District.

Spanning several rooms, the experience allowed visitors to craft their own cocktails using Don Julio tequilas, as well as step inside tech-driven installations powered by cinematic projections, 4D spatial audio, and evocative scents like the warm aromas of roasted agave and rich oak. This wasn't being immersive for immersive’s sake. The experience was designed to transform how people see and remember Don Julio. See BizBash's previous coverage of the activation here.\nBEST INCENTIVE PROGRAM\nIncentive Event Final Night Celebration\nSubmitted by TENCUE\nPhoto: Courtesy of TENCUE\nTENCUE worked with a Fortune 500 tech company on this surrealist incentive event in California's Bay Area. The guiding theme centered around the butterfly effect: What would happen if an artist colony was cut off from the rest of the world for 200 years and allowed to evolve and flourish? The result was this fantastical event featuring costumed actors and performers, bedazzled animal masks, and garden-inspired centerpieces.\nBEST INFLUENCER EVENT\nUNO Social Club Las Vegas\nSubmitted by Mirrored Media\nPhoto: Courtesy of Mirrored Media\nUno Social Club Las Vegas takes home another award for its success in catering to its influencer audience. The details and touchpoints were all orchestrated to maximize the use of the space, allowing influencers to enjoy the experience and make content throughout it—from a caricature artist who created personalized Uno cards to add to an at-home deck to gold UNO wildcards hidden through random decks as interactive surprise-and-delight game moments. See BizBash's previous coverage of the event here.\nBEST INVITATION-ONLY EVENT\nTikTok LIVE Fest\nSubmitted by Seen Presents\nPhoto: Courtesy of Seen Presents\nAlthough TikTok LIVE Fest was built for viewers around the world to enjoy, a lot of focus went into shaping an unforgettable experience for in-person invited attendees. The event ripped up the rulebook of a traditional awards ceremony and created an environment bespoke to TikTok LIVE creators, where they could broadcast, comment, and create in the moment.\nBEST MILLENNIAL/GEN Z EVENT\nPhineas and Ferb Vans Warped Tour\nSubmitted by Mirrored Media\nPhoto: Courtesy of Mirrored Media\nAt the Vans Warped Tour in Washington, D.C., Disney Channel series Phineas and Ferb offered superfans a fun secret spy lair overflowing with the show's unique humor. For starters, there was a “Portal Potty” entry experience that was disguised as, yep, a fleet of porta-potties. Inside were photo ops, character meet-and-greets, and gift giveaways that catered to the festival crowd. The goal was to promote the show's new season—arriving after a 10-year hiatus—to both old and new fans alike. See BizBash's previous coverage of the activation here.\nBEST MOBILE TOUR/ROADSHOW\nThe One Arcade by Uber One\nSubmitted by CNC Agency (Coffee ‘n Clothes)\nPhoto: Courtesy of CNC Agency (Coffee ‘n Clothes)\nWith a 15-stop tour at college campuses all around the country, Uber created a mobile experience to promote its Uber One for Students product, which offers benefits across Uber and Uber Eats. Produced by CNC Agency, the experience combined nostalgia, entertainment, and tangible rewards to showcase the benefits of the membership. \"I love an experience that has a clear aesthetic throughout the entire concept, even when working with some of the most iconic brands and restaurants out there,\" one EEA judge said. \"Each activity had a clear branding through line with the bubble effect, but then the brand also showed up in its iconic way.\"\nBEST NEW EVENT PRODUCT/SERVICE\nNBA Tees & Threes Golf Tournament\nSubmitted by the NBA\nPhoto: Courtesy of the NBA\nThe NBA Tees & Threes Golf Tournament was designed to launch a new premium event product to build out the event offerings during the Emirates NBA Cup under the NBA Experiences portfolio, blending the excitement of NBA culture with the tradition of golf. The event was designed for scalability and flexibility in mind.\nBEST NONPROFIT EVENT CONCEPT\nCricket to Conquer Cancer\nSubmitted by ASTOUND Group\nPhoto: Courtesy of ASTOUND Group\nThe purpose of Cricket to Conquer Cancer was to launch a first-of-its-kind fundraising event that could unite multicultural communities in support of cancer research through the shared passion of cricket. Organized by the Princess Margaret Cancer Foundation in partnership with Ethnicity Matters and ASTOUND, the initiative sought to break new ground in how charitable organizations engage diverse audiences by moving beyond traditional gala dinners or walkathons to create something more authentic, celebratory, and scalable for the future.\nBEST OVERALL BRAND ACTIVATION\nUNO Social Club Las Vegas\nSubmitted by Mirrored Media\nPhoto: Courtesy of Mirrored Media\nThis activation thoroughly impressed our judges this year. It was cheeky, thoughfully curated, and it pretty much went viral. The success of the Las Vegas version of the Uno Social Club was so impactful that it even launched a nation-wide tour. Following the Vegas activation, the Uno Social Club toured the country with additional, smaller pop-up experiences. For Mattel, activations like this are part of a broader strategy to meet audiences where they are. See BizBash's previous coverage of the activation here.\nBEST OVERALL FESTIVAL ACTIVATION\nPhineas and Ferb Vans Warped Tour\nSubmitted by Mirrored Media\nBy disguising its entrance as a wall of porta-potties, this Vans Warped Tour activation from Disney and Mirrored Media became a talking point before anyone even stepped foot into the experience. Taking this otherwise mundane festival staple and infusing it with classic Phineas and Ferb humor made it stand out in a fresh way that deeply resonated with crowds. \"The speakeasy porta-potty was not on my Bingo card, but this captures the essence of festival life brilliantly while creating surprise and delight,\" said one EEA judge. See BizBash's previous coverage of the activation here.\nBEST POP-UP EXPERIENCE\nPeacefest 2025: The First-Ever Music Festival at SDCC\nSubmitted by NVE Experience Agency\nPhoto: Courtesy of NVE Experience Agency\nAt this year's San Diego Comic-Con, HBO Max, DC Studios, and NVE Experience Agency built a full-blown music festival, transforming Peacemaker’s SDCC off-site into a three-day hair metal festival called Peacefest. The multiday event featured 45-minute concerts with live bands, talent appearances (like creator James Gunn and star John Cena), free drinks, and character activities that rewarded exploration. Every element aimed to reinforce the show's DNA: irreverent, theatrical, and proudly alternative. See BizBash's previous coverage of Peacefest at SDCC here.\nBEST PRESS EVENT\nScout Motors Vehicle Reveal Event\nSubmitted by New Moon\nPhoto: Courtesy of New Moon\nLate last year, Volkswagen Group’s Scout Motors celebrated its return to the U.S. market with an experiential-packed day in the hills of suburban Tennessee. This event marked the first Scout vehicle reveal in over 40 years and needed to serve as a powerful reintroduction of the brand to America. Most OEM reveal events are in a black-box studio environment, but production partner New Moon put these cars out in nature. It was a risk, but the event was meant to challenge the way a traditional vehicle reveal functions and stay true to the brand. See BizBash's previous coverage of the event here.\nBEST PRIDE EVENT\nOUTLOUD Music Festival at WeHo Pride 2025\nSubmitted by JJLA\nPhoto: Courtesy of JJLA\nOUTLOUD is intentionally embedded within West Hollywood’s official Pride programming, anchoring entertainment while aligning with free city events and a televised parade. The 2025 curation balanced global headliners and queer trailblazers (Lizzo, Kim Petras, Shygirl, Honey Dijon, Paris Hilton, and more) to position OUTLOUD as both a celebration and platform for LGBTQIA+ voices at Pride Month’s kickoff.\nBEST REIMAGINED EVENT EXPERIENCE\nRoku UpFront Dinners - \"Dinner in Roku City\"\nSubmitted by Todo Productions\nPhoto: Eric Vitale Photography\nThis year, Roku set out to reimagine the typical upfront experience by creating targeted, high-impact events that shifted from volume to value. The Roku UpFront Dinners were designed to move away from large-scale presentations and toward more intimate conversations with key clients. The experience was designed to feel like stepping directly into Roku’s universe. Guests weren’t just attending a dinner—they were dining in Roku City. \"While all of the submissions were beautiful and thoughtful experiences, Roku took the boldest approach to reimagining their event by downsizing dramatically to a more surgical approach in the way they engaged their customers with bespoke hospitality moments, and weaving the event into a larger year-round approach,\" said an EEA judge.\nBEST RETAIL EXPERIENCE\nNike @ Super Bowl LIX\nSubmitted by Brand Activation Services, Fanatics, and Nike\nPhoto: Courtesy of Brand Activation Services, Fanatics, and Nike\nNike’s retail environment at the NFL Experience at Super Bowl LIX was a fusion of past and future, nodding to the French Quarter’s iconic architecture while reimaging it through sport and innovation. Two-story-tall arched balconies and terraces became digital canvases, illuminated by video walls and kinetic lighting that brought the rhythm of New Orleans to life in a modern, athletic way. \"It feels bespoke for this particular event, which makes it feel even more special,\" an EEA judge said. \"Every angle is eye-catching.\" See BizBash's past coverage of Nike at Super Bowl LIX here.\nBEST SEASONAL EXPERIENCE\nWestfield UTC Peppermint Beach Club\nSubmitted by Studio Left\nPhoto: Courtesy of Studio Left\nThe Peppermint Beach Club at Westfield UTC reimagined the classic Christmas narrative through a distinctly modern San Diego lens. Instead of using traditional North Pole tropes, Studio Left created an experience where Santa trades in his wintry workshop for a few relaxing days at his La Jolla beach bungalow before heading off on his global gift-delivering journey. Don't worry; lifeguards were on duty!\nBEST SOCIAL EVENT\nThe Shape of Water: An Immersive Wedding at Montage Laguna Beach\nSubmitted by Kristin Banta Events\nPhoto: Courtesy of Kristin Banta Events\nThis August wedding in Laguna Beach, Calif.—designed by Kristin Banta Events—aimed to transport guests through a narrative journey inspired by water and nature.

The luxurious affair treated the celebration as a continuous experiential journey rather than discrete, standalone moments.\nBEST SPONSOR ACTIVATION AT AN EVENT\nPhineas and Ferb Vans Warped Tour\nSubmitted by Mirrored Media\nPhoto: Courtesy of Mirrored Media\nThrough every step of the Phineas and Ferb experience at the Vans Warped Tour, Disney and Mirrored Media employed high-quality tech to ensure a seamless experience that felt natural to the flow. The inclusion of the festival itself in the narrative helped further the immersive element of the activation. Guests didn’t leave the experience behind; it came out of the activation walls and into the festival with them. See BizBash's previous coverage of the activation here.\nBEST STAGING/SET/ENVIRONMENT DESIGN\nTikTok LIVE Fest\nSubmitted by Seen Presents\nPhoto: Courtesy of Seen Presents\nFor its global awards ceremony, TikTok LIVE Fest reimagined London's Roundhouse as a fully responsive stage environment that mirrored the immediacy of the platform itself. A suspended kinetic structure adorned with oversize LIVE gift icons shifted in real time with creator interactions, while a spherical stage and surrounding LED displays ensured every angle felt stream-ready. The result was a living, ever-changing set that kept both IRL guests and global viewers immersed.\nBEST SUSTAINABILITY/CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM\nTED Countdown Summit 2025\nSubmitted by TED Conferences\nPhoto: Courtesy of TED Conferences\nAt the TED Countdown Summit in Nairobi, Kenya, sustainability wasn’t an add-on—it shaped every decision, from circular materials and plant-forward menus to zero-emission transportation and hyper-local sourcing. The event achieved TED’s lowest on-site carbon footprint to date while spotlighting Africa’s climate innovation ecosystem through immersive field visits and community partnerships. \"Based on their previous win for the last event, to return a new submission and prove they've continued to innovate and find new ways to push the envelope on what sustainability looks like is beyond impressive,\" said an EEA judge.\nBEST SXSW BRAND ACTIVATION\nMuseum of the Future at SXSW\nSubmitted by Czarnowski Collective\nPhoto: Courtesy of Czarnowski Collective\nFor its SXSW debut, Dubai's Museum of the Future transported festivalgoers to the year 2071 through a trio of immersive galleries blending art, innovation, and Middle Eastern culture. Highlights included a 360-degree Refik Anadol LED installation, a packed amphitheater hosting global thought leaders, and an open-air garden serving thousands of Dubai-inspired treats. The result was one of SXSW’s most talked-about activations, drawing 25,000 visitors and spotlighting Dubai as a rising hub of creativity and technological vision. See BizBash's previous coverage of the activation here.\nBEST TEAM-BUILDING ACTIVITY\nCaterpillar Centennial World Tour\nSubmitted by MC² and History Factory\nPhoto: Courtesy of MC²\nTo celebrate its 100th anniversary, Caterpillar took team building on the road with a global touring experience that visited 117 cities across 25 countries, giving more than 100,000 employees the chance to engage with the company’s history and future firsthand. Expandable pods filled with employee imagery, interactive AR displays, and a motion-enabled D2 Dozer simulator created shared moments that sparked connection across departments, languages, and roles.\nBEST TECH BRAND ACTIVATION\nThe G Suite @ ADCOLOR 2024\nSubmitted by Creative Theory Agency and Inkling\nPhoto: Courtesy of Creative Theory Agency and Inkling\nAt ADCOLOR, Google’s G Suite activation reframed AI as a personal, accessible creative tool by inviting guests to generate custom taglines through a Gemini prompt builder and see them transformed into artwork by local LA artists.

Interactive sampling, storytelling touchpoints, and sustainability-focused features (including reusable r.Cup stations and AI-enabled recycling) turned the booth into a walkable brand experience rather than a traditional display. \"I really liked the combination of both callbacks to convenient stores where the products are usually available, but also some higher-end consumer experiences,\" said an EEA judge.\nBEST TV OR FILM PREMIERE EVENT\nWarner Bros.’ F1 The Movie World Premiere\nSubmitted by Warner Bros. and 15|40 Productions\nPhoto: Courtesy of Warner Bros. and 15|40 Productions\nFor the world premiere of F1 The Movie, Warner Bros. transformed Radio City Music Hall and Times Square into a full-scale racing environment, complete with authentic F1 cars, a racetrack-style black carpet, and fan challenges inspired by pit crew drills and driver prep. The mix of Hollywood talent, real racers, and hands-on activations gave attendees a rare, high-energy glimpse into the culture and precision behind the sport. \"What's most impressive about this submission is the scale and being able to do it in NYC, where space is limited and impressions are hard to pull,\" said an EEA judge. \"I also appreciated the variation of activations within the premiere.\"\nBEST UPFRONT EVENT\nNetflix Upfront\nSubmitted by Seen Presents\nPhoto: Courtesy of Seen Presents\nTo stand out in a crowded upfront season, Netflix replaced the traditional sales presentation with an 80-minute theatrical experience that blended immersive staging, sensory design, and live celebrity moments. Extended LED ribbons, cinematic audio cues, and timed “sense boxes” featuring fragrances, chocolates, and themed drinks pulled the audience directly into the worlds of Netflix’s shows. See BizBash's previous coverage of Netflix at the 2025 TV Upfronts here.\nBEST USE OF AI AT AN EVENT\nCode with Claude: AI in Action\nSubmitted by MAS\nPhoto: Courtesy of MAS\nAt Anthropic’s first developer conference, AI powered hands-on moments that let attendees create alongside Claude in real time. A custom-built 8-bit avatar photobooth transformed live portraits into AI-generated pixel art, while “Collab with Claude” invited developers to build animations that were later stitched into a collective visual mosaic. By turning abstract capabilities into playful, tangible experiences, the event showcased Claude’s creative and technical range in a way that resonated with developers.\nBEST USE OF EVENT TECHNOLOGY\nEncore Presents: Peak Perspectives – A Gondola Journey Beyond Expectations\nSubmitted by Encore\nPhoto: Courtesy of Encore\nWhen a real gondola went offline ahead of PwC’s partners conference, Encore turned the setback into the event’s standout moment: a fully automated, AI-personalized gondola simulation that greeted each attendee by name as they ascended through Unreal Engine-built alpine scenes enhanced with wind, scent, and responsive lighting.
