A Bucks County native, Jessica Mihos, walked into her local McDonalds only to find “several armed guards” planted at the fast food joint, she told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “We walked in. It seemed fine. We ordered and we sat down, but then we looked to our left, and there were several armed guards just sitting there,” she said.

For that matter, the system doesn’t appear to protect against someone fraudulently casting ballots in the names of domestic voters by claiming to be overseas. Oregon’s online elections portal, “MyVote,” lets... -\nSuspected drunk driver 'almost struck' Kamala Harris motorcade\nA suspected drunk driver \"almost struck\" Vice-President Kamala Harris's motorcade after driving the wrong way down a highway in Milwaukee on Monday.

Abrams to Reboot Kamala in Final Stretch of Campaign\nThe Kamala Harris campaign is getting a little Hollywood treatment with former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton starring in a video produced by Star Wars director J.J. Abrams, in which the former secretary of state attempts to sale Harris to voters who may still be on the fence. “Kamala is the right person for this time in our country She has the character, experience and vision, to be our next president. But the excitement and energy that she has already generated, I think, points to a generational change that she is going to exemplify. She is going to spearhead into... -\nWomen’s Soccer Club Embroiled in Trans Controversy After Team Fielded Two ‘Bearded Guys’\nA Spanish women’s soccer club has sparked outrage after fielding two “bearded guys” who are transitioning from female to male — including one who scored one of the winning goals.

Powers is a transgender woman who has golfed against biological females. Powers has also competed in many other sports. “I had to take a step back and realize that biological realities are real and competitive advantages will always exist despite the number of years or whatever surgeries and hormones you’ve done, and then understood that my place is not in women’s sports,” Powers said in a recent interview with OutKick. Powers said coaches and other competitors have even said, “‘You belong here.’... -\nHarris Promises Not to Make You Buy an EV—Until After She Wins\nVice President Kamala Harris’ claim that she “will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive” is the climate-policy equivalent of President Barack Obama’s famous lie about the Affordable Care Act: “If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.” But while Obama at least managed to get a law passed, the Biden-Harris administration has tried to transform the automotive industry without even persuading Congress. To be sure, while serving in the U.S. Senate in 2019, Harris enthusiastically co-sponsored legislation mandating that all new car sales be electric by 2040. But as vice president, she... -\nDonald Trump: Unlike Kamala ‘We Embrace Followers of Jesus’\nThe Trump campaign embraces followers of Jesus, former President Donald Trump made clear this week after Vice President Kamala Harris seemingly mocked a man at a Wisconsin rally for shouting, “Jesus is Lord!” “While Kamala said that people who believe in Jesus don’t belong to her rallies, in our Movement — We love Christians, we welcome believers, and we embrace followers of Jesus,” Trump wrote on Instagram, sharing a video showcasing this contrast.

Telemundo host Julio Vaqueiro grilled Harris on her plans for addressing the massive issue, a longtime weak spot for Democrats even before the border crisis started when Joe Biden became president. \"Right now, we're talking about border security, and there's nobody, no Democrat, talking about pathway to citizenship, immigration relief, benefits that migrants bring to this country,\" Vaqueiro said to Harris. \"I am.

This happened for the first time 10 days ago, after a SpaceX Starship rocket blasted off from its pad in Boca Chica, Texas, USA.

Credit: Lucy Reading-Ikkanda/Simons Foundation. ===================================================================== New research has revealed that the star Betelgeuse is likely sharing its orbit with a companion astronomers have nicknamed “Betelbuddy.” According to the new findings, unexpected dips in the star’s brightness observed in 2019 caused some scientists to speculate Betelgeuse may soon enter its supernova phase. As a result, media outlets quickly dubbed the tenth brightest star in the sky the doomed star. Now, an international team of scientists says they’ve ruled out all conventional explanations for the star’s change in brightness, a phenomenon witnessed by observers dating... -\nFlorida boy, 14, killed himself after falling in love with ‘Game of Thrones’ AI chatbot: lawsuit\nA 14-year-old Florida boy killed himself after a lifelike “Game of Thrones” chatbot he’d been messaging for months on an artificial intelligence app sent him an eerie message telling him to “come home” to her, a new lawsuit filed by his grief-stricken mom claims.
