Although she had the upper hand for at least two straight rounds during the intense game, she faltered in the third, eventually handing the win to Anisimova.\nIt was at this point that rumors of her injuries surfaced, with Osaka herself admitting that although she wanted to continue playing, her injuries would not allow her to do so.
