Here’s how to follow the action.\nThis is it – the final qualifying event for the 2024 Wanda Diamond League – and it will bring the world’s best track and field athletes to one of the most storied venues in sports.\nOn Sept. 4-5, the largest event venue in Switzerland – Letzigrund Stadium – will welcome athletes to Zurich for the 14th meet on the 15-event Diamond League schedule.\nWeltklasse Zurich/Diamond League Zurich 2024 is the last chance for the year’s top performers to qualify for the two-day season-ending event in Brussels, Belgium, and the entry list is a who’s who of track and field this year.\n- Subscribe To FloTrack To Watch More Track & Field Meets All Year Long\n- Watch The Diamond League Live On FloTrack, Starting In 2025\n- How Does The Diamond League Point System Work? Here’s What To Know\nMany of the athletes headed to Zurich have been in the spotlight since finding success at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, and they’re not ready to see their seasons come to an end. Others are searching for redemption and one more opportunity to prove they belong among the elite.\nThe competitors have crossed the globe in 2024, collecting points and hoping to qualify for the final event of the Diamond League season, while also focusing on team trials within their own countries, just for a chance to go to the Olympics.\nThe Olympic Games took place in Paris from July 26 through Aug. 11, with the track and field events being held Aug. 1-11.\nThe first seven events on the 2024 Diamond League schedule took place between April 20 and June 2, after which, a month-long hiatus allowed many countries to finalize their teams and plans for the Olympic Games.\nDiamond League action resumed briefly with events in Paris (July 7), Monaco (July 12) and London (July 20), before it was time to head to the biggest stage in sports in the City of Light.\nMany have been able to continue their Olympic momentum during recent Diamond League events in Lausanne (Aug. 22), Silesia (Aug. 25) and Rome (Aug. 30). Others still are hoping to gain some traction and finish the Diamond League season strong.\nWeltklasse Zurich 2024 is their last chance to earn enough points to secure their spots in Brussels. Otherwise, the long wait for the 2025 season begins.\nWeltklasse Zurich first was held in 1928. The event and the host venue have come a long way in the last 96 years, and it has been held every year since 1973. The original version of the stadium, featuring a dirt track, opened in 1925.\nLetzigrund long has been a destination for top-tier track and field events, but the stadium also is home to multiple teams and clubs – FC Zurich (soccer), Grasshopper Club Zurich (soccer) and LC Zurich (athletics).\nThe facility has room for up to 30,000 visitors for sporting events and more than 50,000 for concerts.\nThe original stadium was used from 1925-2006. During that time, there were multiple renovations, including the addition of lights in 1973. The modern Letzigrund opened in 2007.\nTo learn more about the facility, click HERE.\nWhat Has The 2024 Diamond League Season Looked Like?\nThe 2024 Diamond League season kicked off at the end of April with a pair of stops in China – Xiamen and Shanghai/Suzhou – and then visited Qatar on May 10, Morocco on May 19, Eugene, Oregon (Prefontaine Classic), on May 25, Oslo (Bislett Games) on May 30, Stockholm (BAUHAUS-galan) on June 2, Paris on July 7, Monaco (Herculis EBS Meeting) on July 12, London (London Athletics Meet) on July 20, Lausanne (Athletissima) on Aug. 22, Silesia (Silesia Kamila Skolimowska Memorial) on Aug. 25 and Rome (Golden Gala Pietro Mennea) on Aug. 30.\nDuring the 15-event Diamond League schedule this year, athletes have traveled the world, with the season-ending championship event set for Brussels on Sept. 13-14.\nThe Diamond League Zurich 2024 will include seven men’s disciplines and seven women’s disciplines, as athletes continue collecting points toward the year’s final event in Belgium.\nThe invitation-only Diamond League brings together the most elite track & field athletes to showcase their skills, earn prize money, collect points toward the season-ending championship event and ultimately elevate the status of athletics across the globe.\nTraditionally, Diamond League competition includes a slate of 16 disciplines, though not every meet features all of them.\nPoints accumulated during the first 14 events of the season determine the athletes who advance to the final event, where they compete for more prize money and Diamond League titles.\nOn the line at each event - $10,000 for a win at a regular event and $30,000 for a win in the final event.\nThe disciplines featured in Zurich in 2024 will be:\nMen\n- 200 Meters\n- 1,500 Meters\n- 110-Meter Hurdles\n- 400-Meter Hurdles\n- Shot Put\n- Javelin\n- Long Jump\nWomen\n- 100 Meters\n- 800 Meters\n- 5,000 Meters\n- 100-Meter Hurdles\n- 400-Meter Hurdles\n- Pole Vault\n- High Jump\nAmong the entrants for Weltklasse Zurich are some of the fastest athletes on the planet, and they’ll be showcasing their speed and skills in some of the fans’ favorite events – the women’s 100, men’s 200 and all four hurdle events.\nThe women’s 100 will feature the top two finishers from the recent Olympics – St. Lucia’s Julien Alfred and Team USA’s Sha’Carri Richardson.\nAlfred’s win in Paris was the first medal of any kind for her tiny island nation, and while it delayed Richardson her Olympic redemption, that later came as the anchor for the United States in the women’s 4x100, where she finally secured her first Olympic gold medal.\nThe men’s 200 in Zurich will feature five of the eight finalists from Paris, including gold medalist Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, who became the first African athlete to win the 200 at the Olympics. The win came in an African-record 19.46 seconds.\nReally, it would be easy enough to go through each event and list the accomplishments of each athlete or compile all of the terrific storylines of upsets, redemption, possibilities, etc., but the result would be a very lengthy story.\nThe week in Zurich also will feature a little bit of fun beyond the business, especially for pole vault sensation Armand Duplantis of Sweden, who won the gold medal in Paris with a world-record effort.\nThough the men’s pole vault won’t count for Diamond League points in Zurich, he’ll still be there competing, and he’ll get to go against his idol, French star Renaud Lavillenie, the 2012 Olympic champion.\nDuplantis also will participate in a special event that will see him showcase his speed in a 100-meter dash against Norway’s Karsten Warholm, an Olympic and world champion in the 400-meter hurdles. Neither competes in the event on a regular basis, but they have in the past. Their showdown will take place at Letzigrund Stadium on Sept. 4.\nThe complete list of entries for Zurich is available HERE.
