  "body_text": "Tottenham Hotspur Women have opened their season with two wins and a draw in their first three matches (including Wednesday’s League Cup win over Charlton) and are earning some early season plaudits. Tottenham manager Robert Vilahamn has been nominated for September’s WSL Manager of the Month award, while Beth England has earned a nomination for Player of the Month.\nSpurs Women’s Vilahamn, England nominated for WSL monthly awards\nEarly plaudits for Tottenham Women!\nLet’s start with Vilahamn, and I think it’s deserved. Sure, it’s only two matches and one of them is a draw, but Spurs looked super impressive in their season-opening win over Crystal Palace, and while Spurs looked below their expected level in the draw against Villa, starting the season off unbeaten shouldn’t be discounted. Tottenham look at minimum slightly better than last season’s team, and a lot of that comes down to Bob’s coaching. He’s going up against new Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor and United’s Marc Skinner, both of whom are undefeated in their first two, so winning the award is probably a bit of a heavy lift.\nNow, Beth England’s nomination: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Look, I love Beth, but she didn’t start either of the two WSL matches and I’m having a bit of a difficult time justifying her inclusion on this list ahead of other potential Tottenham players, like Drew Spence or Haley Raso, both of whom I’d say has played more and better football. But England did score the equalizing goal against Villa, so I guess? Whatever, I doubt she wins this, it might end up going to Grace Clinton (sob) who honestly looks like she’s not very happy at United based on that photo of her and that means we should kidnap her in the dead of night and bring her back to Hotspur Way which is obviously her happy place amirite?\nAnyway, you can vote for your favorite Tottenham players and managers at thefa.com.",
