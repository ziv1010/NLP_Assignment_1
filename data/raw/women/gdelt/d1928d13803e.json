Before arriving in Tuscaloosa, Cahalan was a star for Hewitt-Trussville High School. She was ranked the No. 1 overall player in the 2023 class by Perfect Game Softball and 2022 Alabama Miss Softball.\nCrimson Tide's NFL Draft First-Rounders During Saban's Tenure\nGallery Credit: Jacob Harrison\nAlabama's 2024 A-Day\nGallery Credit: Wyatt Fulton\nAlabama's Final Four Loss to UConn\nGallery Credit: Wyatt Fulton\nSport Your Favorite Sports Station with Exclusive Tide 100.9 Gear\nGallery Credit: Threadless, TSM\nDeBoer Introduction as Alabama Football Head Coach\nGallery Credit: Simon Besnoy\n2023 SEC Championship Alabama vs. Georgia\nGallery Credit: Crimson Tide Photos/ UA Athletics",
