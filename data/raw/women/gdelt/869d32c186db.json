Sorry to worry everyone, I'm OK, the wonderful paramedics at Saints have said it's probably a virus, just need a bit of rest and hydration.\"\nWoods expressed her embarrassment over the incident happening on live TV and thanked her colleagues for their assistance, reports the Manchester Evening News.\nHer fiancee, 38 year old Adam Collard, confirmed in a post on X that Woods was \"all OK\" and expressed gratitude for the supportive messages received.\nWoods regularly presents the coverage of football matches for ITV and TNT Sports. Supporters at home were quick to send their well-wishes after the scare, and expressed concern.\nOne X user said: \"Really hope Laura Woods is okay.

Speedy recovery\"\n\"Gosh, I hope Laura Woods is okay?\" added a further fan. \"Just watching #lionesses #engvgha Bravo Katie Shanahan who has stepped in at a moment's notice.\"\n\"I hope that Laura Woods is okay...
