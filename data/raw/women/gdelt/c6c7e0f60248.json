What does this mean? Our family's main asset is in a trust due to Dad dying in 1983 with underage children. How can Australians plan for their future and retirement if the government keeps changing the goal posts?\nAnswer\nThere have been rumours about changes to family trusts for as long as I can remember. Given they will be an election next year. I don't think we're going to see too many onerous tax changes in the next 15 months. Given your trust would appear to be a testamentary trust from the information provided, I suggest they would be the last ones to be attacked.\nQuestion\nI want to leave my super to my adult kids - will they have to pay tax on this ?\nAnswer\nThe laws are clear - there is a tax of 15 per cent plus Medicare levy on the taxable component of your superannuation that is left to a non-dependent. Obviously, most adult children would be non-dependents. The solution is withdraw your superannuation before you die tax-free and either put it in your bank account, where it will be part of your estate or give it to the kids while you're still alive.\nQuestion\nDespite having a reasonable knowledge of superannuation, one question that I have not been able to find an answer for follows. If or when, my wife and I sell and downsize, I know that the amount that we can contribute to our super is limited by law, however are we further limited to our original transfer balance, in our case $1.6 million, or will we be able to top up to the transfer limit applying at that time?\nAnswer\nNo contributions to superannuation are allowed once you reach 75, or if your total superannuation balance exceeds $1.9 million. The down-sizer contribution is a one off exception. You can contribute up to $300,000 each from the sale of your residence provided certain conditions are met.\nThe contribution can be made irrespective of your age or total superannuation balance. Having used up your transfer balance cap of $1.6 million, no more transfers to pension mode are allowed - however your pension account can grow without limit provided you take the mandatory pension each year.\n- Noel Whittaker is the author of Wills, death and taxes and numerous other books on personal finance.
