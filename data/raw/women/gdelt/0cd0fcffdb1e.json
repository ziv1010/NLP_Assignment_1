The good news is that we are going to be looking at the fun topic of players who played, or still play, for the Pride. The bad news is, again, you will be reading my prose and not that of Charles Dickens.\nIt would take some real David Copperfield (you English majors out there see what I did there) type magic for Dickens to write this since he died in 1870, 26 years before the first-ever Summer Olympics and 126 years before the inclusion of women’s soccer in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. We will not be going all the way back to 1996, but let’s go back to 2016 and 2021 (and yet, somehow, also 2020), and from there we will look at the current Paris games and I will close with a prediction about which Pride players I think have a chance to participate in a future Olympiad.\nThe Pride’s inaugural season was 2016, and that team sent five players to the Rio de Janeiro Olympics: Steph Catley and Laura Alleway represented Australia; Mônica represented Brazil; Josée Bélanger represented Canada; and the face of the franchise, Alex Morgan, represented the U.S. All four nations advanced out of the group stage and into the knockout stage, and all of the Pride players averaged playing at least 60 minutes per match, with two players even averaging more than 90 minutes per match due to playing in games where there was extra time.\nHere is a chart of some of the 2016 Pride players’ key statistics during those Olympic games, laid next to their stats from the NWSL season (all data from fbref.com, and it should be noted that Alleway, Catley, and Mônica were defenders):\nA few items on these players and their performances in the 2016 Olympics:\n- There were several Pride vs. Pride matchups, with only Morgan going through the tournament without seeing one of her teammates on the opposing side of the field.\n- Canada defeated Brazil in the third-place game, with both Bélanger and Mônica going the full 90 for their respective teams. Also on the field during that match for Brazil were future Pride players Marta and Rafaelle, though neither were playing in the NWSL at the time.\n- Morgan’s two goals tied her for sixth in the Olympics, despite the Yanks’ early departure in the quarterfinals, when they were defeated by Sweden.\n- It is rather crazy to see that both Alleway and Mônica averaged more than 90 minutes per game, but Brazil went into extra time in two separate matches and Australia did in one.\nThe next Olympics should have been during the 2020 season, but despite the branding staying as the 2020 Summer Olympics, the games actually took place in 2021 in Japan due the pandemic. The Pride sent four players to Japan: Marta represented Brazil; Erin McLeod represented Canada; Ali Riley represented New Zealand; and Morgan once again represented the United States.\nNew Zealand did not make it out of the group stage, but the other three nations did, with Brazil losing in the quarterfinals, the U.S. winning bronze, and Canada winning the gold medal. It was somewhat of a backwards performance for the Pride players, as the best two individual performers (Marta, Riley) had their teams go out the earliest, and of the two who earned medals, one did not play at all (McLeod, who was a backup goalkeeper) and the other had a poor performance by her high standards (Morgan).\nHere is a chart of some of the 2021 Pride players’ key statistics during those Olympic games laid next to their stats from the NWSL season (note: McLeod was an unused goalkeeper in the Olympics and Riley is a defender):\nA few items on these players and their performances in the “2020” Olympics held in 2021:\n- There were once again several Pride vs. Pride matchups, and this time every Pride player played at least one game against a teammate. Well, McLeod did not play, but you know what I meant. You did. I know you did.\n- Both Marta and Riley were the captains for their respective nations, though neither captained even one match throughout the entire 2021 Pride season (Ashlyn Harris captained most matches, with Ali Krieger and Toni Pressley captaining the other matches).\n- Marta’s three goals tied her for eighth overall, and when she scored her first goal it marked the fifth — let me repeat the fifth — straight Olympics where she had scored at least one goal. Ranking second overall in goals scored during that Olympics? A 19-year-old Barbra Banda, then playing her club soccer in the Chinese Women’s Super League.\nThis brings us to the current Olympiad, in which the Pride are tied with Gotham FC for the highest representation across the NWSL with seven players on Olympic rosters: Adriana, Angelina, Marta and Rafaelle representing Brazil; Emily Sams representing the U.S.; and Banda and Grace Chanda representing Zambia.\nThe tournament is still ongoing, so these stats may change, but here is how the players have been doing thus far, as compared to their NWSL stats (Angelina is an alternate for Brazil and was in the lineup for only one match, and Sams is an alternate for the USA and was in the lineup for only one match. Chanda was only recently signed by the Pride, so she has not yet dressed for a Pride match.):\nA few items on these players and their performances in the 2024 Olympics:\n- Thus far, there have not been any Pride vs. Pride matchups. Although the U.S. played Zambia, Sams was not in the lineup for that match.\n- Banda scored her third career Olympic hat trick in Zambia’s matchup against Australia, which makes her the only woman ever with three hat tricks in the Olympics. She now has scored 10 goals total in her Olympic career, which ranks her tied for fourth all-time on the Olympic scoring list.\n- Marta is playing in her sixth straight Olympics. Very few athletes in any sport are able to compete in six consecutive Olympics, and those who do generally play in sports which require less physical exertion than that is required from soccer (shooting, equestrian and sailing have the most athletes who have six or more Olympic appearances) .\n- Both Rafaelle and Chanda suffered injuries and missed games during the group stage.\n- Banda and Marta both captained their teams in every game they played.\n- Brazil and the U.S. have both advanced to the quarterfinals, while Zambia is out, so the stats for Banda and Chanda are final, but the stats for the other five Pride players could change.\nI would be remiss not to mention that Marta has said she will be retiring from playing for Brazil after this season, but I certainly hope that she plays at least one more match for the Seleção (Brazil’s nickname for their national team), so that her final match for her country does not end with her having received a straight red card, which is currently the case after Brazil’s match against Spain on Wednesday. Marta will be suspended for the quarterfinal match, but if Brazil wins, I am sure she will be back in the lineup for the semifinal.\nThat said, let’s transition to looking at the future and consider which current Pride players are most likely to make an appearance in a future Olympiad. Looking at this by nation:\nArgentina — Mariana Larroquette started all three matches during the 2023 World Cup and is still a common call-up for the national team. Argentina has a decent chance to qualify for an Olympics, though it did not this year, but Larroquette may need to be playing more minutes to still be a viable selection in four years, and minutes are going to be hard to come by for the Pride as long as Banda is still on the team. My confidence level (on a scale of 1-10, where 10 is the highest level of confidence): 2.\nBrazil — Luana, Marta, and Rafaelle will be likely nearing the end of their careers or possibly already retired in four years (and Luana’s soccer future is currently uncertain), so although I would never put anything past any professional athlete, I am going to remove all three from consideration. That leaves Adriana and Angelina from the Brazilian contingent, and I think it is likely Brazil will qualify and that both have excellent chances of being on that team in four years. My confidence levels: Adriana 7, Angelina 9.\nCanada — Amanda Allen has already been called up to the senior team once and has played frequently for the youth national teams of Canada, one of the strongest teams in the world. Canada is likely to make every Olympic tournament until other nations in Concacaf get stronger, and since Allen is only 19, she likely has several chances to make the team at least once. She will have the same issue as Larroquette in terms of earning minutes while on the Pride, but I think her talent will get her on the field somewhere, and she will make a future Canadian Olympic Team. My confidence level: 9.\nEngland — Anna Moorhouse was called into camp for England just a few weeks ago on the strength of a solid performance in the first few months of this season. England is very deep in goalkeeping talent though, with three players around her age or younger with eight or more starts for England and several others who are starters in the Women’s Super League in their home country. England also did not qualify for this year’s Olympics, and is in a difficult area of the world to feel confident that it will qualify in the next cycle. My confidence level: 1.\nSpain — Celia has not played for the national team since 2019, and being that Spain is the reigning World Cup champion, it feels unlikely she will return to the team in the near future, let alone in four years’ time. My confidence level: 1.\nSweden — Evelina Duljan is in a similar situation to Allen, though at a different position and at a slightly older age. Duljan has played quite a few matches for the youth national teams of Sweden and seems a likely part of the senior team’s future, but she will need to get minutes at the club level in the next few years. As fellow Mane Land writer Sean Rollins wrote recently, the NWSL x Liga MX Femenil Summer Cup (which should be sponsored by Dos Equis…think about it), is a great opportunity to get some minutes for players like Duljan, who have been on the bench for most of the season. Sweden did not qualify for the 2024 Olympics and is in the tough European region, so that does knock down my confidence level for Duljan, but she is still young enough that I think she will have multiple chances in her future. My confidence level: 5.\nUnited States — Americans make up approximately half of all members of the Pride, but I think really only a few have a chance to play for the national team: Ally Lemos, Emily Sams, and Summer Yates. Although Yates has played for the youth national team in the past and is having an excellent second season in the NWSL, I think she is a longshot to get a call-up and to be on the the team for the next Olympics, even though I have been impressed by her play this season. Lemos has been part of the youth national team since she was 14 and frequently starts for the U-20 team. She is one of only 37 players in NWSL history to have played more than 250 minutes in a season at the age of 20 or younger. I think she has a decent chance to be called up the senior national team, and then she will have a chance to prove herself and earn a full-time role. Sams is already on the team today as an alternate (recently moved to the active roster as a replacement for the injured Tierna Davidson) and will definitely be involved in the program during the next few years. My confidence levels: Lemos 5, Sams 8, Yates 2.\nZambia — Without Banda, it is doubtful that Zambia makes the Olympics, so as she goes, they go. She is one of the best players in the world, and I think she can get the team into the Olympics on her own at least once, if not multiple times during the rest of her career. Chanda I have not seen enough from yet, but she made the team and played in this Olympics and is still young enough (27) that she likely would be in contention if Zambia qualifies for 2028 and possibly also 2032. My confidence levels: Banda 10, Chanda 6.\nSo, there it is. I am not Jacob Marley, but we were visited by the ghosts of Pride Olympic past, present, and future, and hopefully for all of you it was as enjoyable a read as are the sounds of the music of another famous Marley — Bob, who obviously would have been a Pride fan. All the remaining Pride players will play again on Saturday in the Olympic quarterfinals, and the bracket is set up for a possible Brazil vs. U.S. gold medal game if each team can win two more games.\nI will be rooting for that final, as even though it would delay the return of five players, it would be amazing to see Marta potentially close out her international career with a gold medal. No matter what, it will be exciting to see, and I look forward to watching this coming weekend.\nOrlando City\nOrlando City, Orlando Pride Remain Hidden During Preseason\nOrlando City and the Orlando Pride continue the odd policy of hiding information from fans as they prepare for the upcoming seasons.\nAs preseason continues for Orlando City and the Orlando Pride, little is known about the progress the team is making in their preparations for the upcoming seasons. But it wasn’t always that way. The club used to be quite open about their preseason scrimmages. The social media accounts would provide lineups, substitutions, goals, and other game updates, allowing fans to follow along.\nBut there was more.\nWhen the Wilf family took over ownership, they opened the doors to the club during preseason. In 2022, two games were open to season ticket members and both teams had a preseason game open to all fans and media.\nThe club continued providing an open preseason game for both teams in 2023, giving a chance to see the teams in action before the regular season started. However, less and less access has been provided to the outside world since then.\nThe 2024 season saw the open preseason games removed for both City and the Pride. The Lions had an FC Series game against Flamengo before camp began and a late game for Society XXI members. Last year, the Lions started with an FC Series game again, this time against Atletico Mineiro. They ended with a season ticket member game.\nThe club released very little information other than the FC Series contest. That leads us to this preseason, in which the club has been as tight-lipped as it has been since the Wilf family took charge of the club.\nThere has been even less information about the Pride. Since Seb Hines became the permanent head coach leading into the 2023 season, the club doesn’t even provide an official preseason schedule anymore.\nWhile the club at one time provided updates on games and opened one to media and at least season ticket members, you’re lucky to even get a reference that the team still exists. The occasional photo is the only way fans know the team has even begun preseason.\nThe lack of availability during preseason is quite unique to American soccer. Other major American sports — the NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL — allow fans and media to attend their preseason games. Soccer teams from other countries also sell tickets to preseason games and local fans often travel abroad, following the team.\nAlso, not all MLS teams are this quiet as they prepare for the season. On Sunday, for example, the LA Galaxy live streamed a scrimmage against the Chicago Fire.\nOrlando City played Nashville SC in a scrimmage Saturday afternoon. The opposition provided lineups, substitutions, goals, and other updates throughout the contest. The only thing they didn’t offer was Orlando CIty goal scorers, something likely requested by the Lions.\nBut what advantage does Orlando City gain from this?\nIt could be argued that the club is working on tactics and doesn’t want to give anything away. But it hasn’t been like that in the past, and that argument doesn’t hold water when you see teams that routinely are more open about their preseasons making deep playoff runs.\nOscar Pareja made the most significant tactical change since arriving in Orlando during the 2024 preseason. He moved attacking midfielder Dagur Dan Thorhallsson to right back and put either David Brekalo or Wilder Cartagena at left back. The team played five in the back defensively and three in the back while in the attack. It was a significant change, but the club still provided information to fans.\nIn today’s sports world, fans have more access than ever before. Television networks and streaming services regularly give fans a behind-the-scenes look at some of the most popular sports teams in the world. These programs aren’t the teams or leagues showing gratitude to fans. They’ve realized that giving fans this glimpse makes them feel more connected to the teams they follow and builds a buzz heading into the season. As a result, they’re more likely to watch games on television or attend games in person.\nUnfortunately, Orlando fans aren’t getting that connection anymore. The excitement for the start of preseason is nearly gone, because City and Pride fans know they’ll receive little, if any, information until the season begins.\nThe club will argue that it provides several experiences for all fans leading up to the regular season opener — from public jersey unveilings to drinks with coaches and players. But what would help build fan excitement about the upcoming season would be the ability to see the team in action and catch glimpses of new signings. Or at least to know how they’re progressing.\nWhether the club’s habits revert to how they were just a couple of years ago remains to be seen. There’s definitely an appetite as The Mane Land and other outlets regularly field requests from fans looking for any possible information. But even those that cover the club regularly are kept at a distance.\nFor the time being, fans will have to be content with the occasional player signing, community event, and photo from a scrimmage the club may or may not admit is happening. And they’ll continue to count down until Orlando City’s first MLS game on Feb. 21 and the Orlando Pride’s first NWSL game on March 15.\nOrlando Pride\nThe Pride Need to Tie Barbra Banda to Their HIP\nA look at the NWSL’s new High Impact Player classification, and how the Pride might allocate those funds.\nIs it just me, or has the off-season seemed even longer than usual this year? It feels like forever since any of the Orlando clubs played a match, and while we are getting social media pictures and videos from their respective preseasons, we are still weeks away from the season openers. The off-season just seems to keep going and going.\nIt reminds me of “Rapper’s Delight,” the 1979 song that is often cited (incorrectly, but that is a story for another time and website) as the first-ever hip hop song. It’s a 14-plus-minute audio experience that also just seems to keep going and going, and it starts off with one of the most well-known lines in contemporary pop music: “I said a hip hop, the hippie, the hippie to the hip, hip hop and you don’t stop.”\nThe hips that Wonder Mike was rapping about are not the same ones that were in the news recently, as those are not hips but HIPs, as in High Impact Players — the NWSL’s new roster mechanism (introduced in December) that will allow teams to go beyond the salary cap to sign certain players to much higher salaries than previously.\nWithout belaboring over the details, a simple definition for a HIP is that the player must have met at least one classification from the list below:\n- 2025 SportsPro Media Top 150 Most Marketable Athletes.\n- 2025 Ballon d’Or voting (top 30 players).\n- 2024 Ballon d’Or voting (top 30 players).\n- 2025 Guardian Top 100 football players in the world (top 40 players).\n- 2024 Guardian Top 100 football players in the world (top 40 players).\n- 2025 ESPN FC Top 50 football players in the world (top 40 players).\n- 2024 ESPN FC Top 50 football players in the world (top 40 players).\n- 2025 minutes played for the USWNT (top 11 field players, top goalkeeper).\n- 2024 minutes played for the USWNT (top 11 field players, top goalkeeper).\n- 2025 NWSL MVP Finalists.\n- 2024 NWSL MVP Finalists.\n- 2025 End of Year NWSL Best XI First Team.\n- 2024 End of Year NWSL Best XI First Team .\nAs of December 2025, The Equalizer reported there are 102 players around the world who qualify, though that number is fluid because some of the 2024 lists will be replaced by new lists, once they are released. The Pride currently have two players on the roster who are HIP eligible: Barbra Banda and Marta, each of whom qualified under eight of the 13 possible qualifications, though in reality they went eight for 11 since Banda is Zambian and Marta is Brazilian, making neither eligible to play for the United States Women’s National Team (USWNT). Emily Sams was also eligible while a member of the Pride, but she is now a member of Angel City, so she is dead to me.\nJust kidding, I will still root for Sams, but only when she is playing for the USWNT. Or if she comes to her senses and asks to return back to a club that actually has won something in the league.\nThe Washington Spirit signed Trinity Rodman to the NWSL’s first-ever deal using the HIP mechanism last week, making her the highest paid women’s soccer player in the world, earning more than $2 million annually according to reports. Unlike MLS, the NWSL does not release contract details, so we do not know how much more that is than the next-highest-paid players in the league, but we know that she just set the new bar, and deservedly so.\nBut is it deservedly so? Let’s take a look.\nLet me start by saying that Rodman is one of my favorite athletes to watch across all sports. Not among women’s athletes, among all athletes. She plays with speed, power, skill, and joy, and even though she plays for a rival team in the NWSL, I root for her to succeed, because her style of play is one that every athlete should aspire to replicate. It certainly helps that she also plays (and when healthy, starts) for the USWNT, my second favorite soccer team behind the Pride, but even if she was playing elsewhere I am confident I would still be a fan. How could you not, when she makes plays like this and then gets her coach to join the celebration?\nThat combination of success on the field and likeability is what makes her one of the most marketable athletes in the NWSL as well, and marketability was included in the list of HIP criteria, so I think it is a quick and resounding yes, it is deservedly so that Rodman set the new bar.\nBut once a bar is set, another player will want to jump over it. Rodman has a tremendous mix of soccer skills and marketability, but NWSL general managers want to win championships more than just the hearts and minds of fans, so they are generally more interested in bringing in the best players than they are the most marketable players. Rodman is a great player and has set that bar very high, but now every GM in the league has a target they can use to try to acquire a new player by pulling a Jerry Maguire and showing them the money.\nRodman might not have many peers in the marketability space, but let’s take a look at a few players on the soccer side. Just for fun we’ll call them Player B and Player M, to see if they match up with her and might want a similar salary. Here are their stats per 90 minutes from the combined 2024 and 2025 seasons with their NWSL ranks included in parentheses:\n*data from what’s still available on fbref.com (goal contributions, plus/minus), as well as FotMob (chances created (a.k.a. key passes), FotMob rating) and American Soccer Analysis (goals added).\nYou did not need to be a Bletchley Park-level codebreaker (deep cut for the history buffs) to figure out that Player B is Banda and Player M is Marta. Banda compares quite favorably to Rodman, exceeding her performance in nearly every category, and while Marta lags behind the other two in a few categories (reminder, she played those seasons at 37 and 38 years old and is the oldest player in the league), she surpasses both of them, and the rest of the soccer world, in the categories of heart and, you know, being the greatest of all time. That, however, probably will not translate into the Pride signing her to a HIP deal at this point in her soccer career, even though there is no player in soccer who more perfectly fits the definition of high impact than Marta.\nBanda does not have Marta’s global profile or status, but at 25 years old (she will turn 26 in March) she is already a superstar, with high-level achievements already in the Summer Olympics and World Cup for Zambia, a goals-scored-per-90-minutes ranking of fourth in NWSL history (0.62 per 90), and she played a pivotal role in helping the Pride win the NWSL Shield and the NWSL Championship during the 2024 season. The injury she suffered during the 2025 season did not completely derail the Pride’s season, but the offense was not the same without her in the lineup — one of the main reasons that the Pride came up short in their quest to win back-to-back titles.\nWhen she was acquired in 2024, Banda reportedly (again, it would be ideal for the NWSL to actually release this information instead of forcing people to use words like “reportedly”) signed a four-year deal worth up to $2.1 million over the life of the contract, but with Rodman’s deal now worth nearly that amount per year, it is certain that Banda’s agent has already been in discussions with the Pride’s front office about signing her to a brand new contract using the HIP mechanism.\nHer current contract runs through the 2027 season, but in recent months the trends have pointed to more players wanting to go to Europe than stay in the NWSL. While that is not exclusively about money, the ability of European teams to offer whatever they want certainly has played a role in enticing players to make a move. With two years left on her contract the Pride are not at risk of losing Banda imminently, but there are few strikers like her in the world (she is one of only 44 women across fbref.com’s database of 16 women’s leagues who have averaged more than 0.60 goals scored per 90 minutes while playing more than 3,000 minutes in the last two seasons), and she is still in the early prime of her career.\nI expect the Pride to offer Banda a HIP contract in the upcoming months, as now that Rodman’s deal has been signed, every team has a benchmark in place, and they can negotiate with the agents and players using that deal as a starting point. Banda’s statistical performance and age is similar to Rodman’s, though the Pride will likely offer her a lower amount as she does not have the same commercial profile. There are no hard and fast rules to defining “commercial profile” or “marketability,” so it is more about perception than anything, but I think the Pride will discount something off of Banda’s offer, even though a good argument can be made that Banda delivers more on the field than Rodman.\nHopefully, the Pride’s front office and Banda can come to an agreement on a new contract in the near future, and when they do, it will only be right that we all shout out HIP HIP hooray!\nVamos Pride!\nOrlando Pride\nReading (Into) the Minutes: How The Pride Might Allocate Playing Time This Season\nHere’s how the Pride might replace the minutes played by those players who departed the club during the off-season.\nOn Tuesday, the Pride held their first practice of the preseason, and even though it is not November, I am giving thanks that they are finally back on the field. There are only so many stories out there during the off-season, when news comes in drips and drabs. It was great to see players back in their Pride practice uniforms and smiling together on the field, and with every passing day, the Pride’s roster will get closer and closer to being set for the 2026 season, and we will know which players will compete to replace the minutes of those who departed the club during the off-season.\nAt almost this exact time last year I wrote an article about how the 2025 Pride were bringing back nearly every player from their 2024 team, and while just two weeks later the Pride said “oh really, Andrew?” and transferred Adriana to Al Qadsiah in Saudi Arabia, a robust 87% of the minutes played by Pride players during the 2025 NWSL regular season were played by players from that 2024 team. That percentage would likely have been even higher if not for the injury to Barbra Banda, but 87% is still the second-highest percentage of minutes played in the subsequent season by returning players from the league champion in NWSL history, as you can see from the table below:\nThe 2025 Pride had a lot of continuity from that 2024 team, and while we will never know what would have happened if Banda had stayed healthy (my completely unbiased prediction: back-to-back champs, wins in every playoff game by at least 10 goals), we know that when she played, the team had a +10 goal differential in 16 (but really 15) games, and the team was +1.04 goals per 90 minutes better with her on the field than off the field. That stat is courtesy of fbref.com, a phrase I sadly may not be able to say again this season, as fbref’s data provider cut off its data access this week, and sadly one of the world’s best free databases for men’s and women’s soccer statistics is now gone. I am feeling more verklempt than Mike Myers in an SNL sketch. Let’s move on.\nThere is only a weak negative correlation between the percentage of minutes played by returning players in the subsequent season and a champion’s finish in the subsequent regular season. So, while a negative correlation means as the percentage of minutes played by returning players increases, a team’s regular-season finish decreases (decreasing being good, because the number is getting closer to one, which is first place), the correlation is weak. In plain language, that means just because a lot of players return, it does not imply the team will challenge for the regular-season title.\nThe correlation is also weak and negative for the relationship between returning player minutes and a team’s finish in the subsequent playoffs, and the numbers back up what most of us inherently think anyway, which is that while it is good to have continuity and bring back championship-winning players, it does not guarantee anything.\nThis leads me to the roster, as we know it, for the Pride. I wrote a piece in our most recent newsletter, which you can subscribe to by clicking here, about the positional breakdown of the players currently on the Pride’s roster. But if we step back and look at the macro view for the Pride, the following players, who played at least one minute during NWSL play in 2025, are no longer with the club: Emily Sams, Ally Watt, Carson Pickett, Morgan Gautrat, Prisca Chilufya, Simone Charley, Grace Chanda, and Bri Martinez. Those players combined to play almost exactly 25% of the NWSL regular-season minutes last season, and some quick math tells us that means the Pride currently have 75% of their minutes played in 2025 returning for 2026, as it stands today.\nKylie Nadaner’s return date is still to be determined, so that is another 6% currently unavailable (dropping the total down to 69% returning) but will probably be back during the season. The upshot of all this is the team returns approximately two-thirds of its minutes from last year from a team that, when healthy, was among the best in the league.\nIt is not ideal that the minutes that have to be replaced include one of the league’s best center backs in Sams, who played the full 90 minutes in every game except one, but at the same time, it is ideal that Banda is likely to play 500+ more minutes and Jacquie Ovalle will probably play 1,000+ more minutes than they did in 2025. If those two hit those benchmarks they will replace all or nearly all of the minutes played by the now-departed Watt and Charley, and while they were solid contributors, minutes played by Banda and Ovalle will be considered an upgrade.\nPickett’s departure will likely be covered by a combination of the new defenders who have signed with the Pride in recent weeks, some Kerry Abello minutes in the midfield instead of at left back, and increases in minutes for Julie Doyle, Simone Jackson, or Summer Yates, who hopefully will be fully healthy this year and return to her 2024 form. Thus far, the Pride have signed two attacking players — rookies Solai Washington and let’s-hope-she-doesn’t-wear-number-six Seven Castain — but both players primarily played forward in college, so we do not yet know if they have the ability to play out on the wing.\nIf they do, those two could also be in the mix to replace Pickett’s midfield minutes as well as the minutes played by Chanda, Chilufya, and some minutes at their natural position of forward. That leaves the one minute played by Martinez, which will be absorbed by the Pride’s deep list of right backs (Cori Dyke, Hailie Mace, Oihane, Nicole Payne). The midfield minutes played by Gautrat can be filled by Ally Lemos, Luana, and Viviana Villacorta, though most likely by the first two.\nYou surely noticed that I skipped over replacing the minutes from Sams and Nadaner (while she is out). While there are players on the roster who can do that, there is also the ever-present risk of a Rafaelle injury, as she has not been the most durable player while in Orlando. Zara Chavoshi and the recently acquired Hannah Anderson are both center backs, though last season Anderson was the third center back for a bottom-of-the-standings Chicago team and Chavoshi was the fourth center back in Orlando. Both players are young and have the potential to improve, and in Chavoshi’s case she was behind three really good center backs last season, so being fourth on the depth chart is not an indication of her talent.\nSome of the Pride’s other outside back players like Abello, Dyke, Mace and potentially others could also play some center back, but it still feels like that position is unsettled at the moment and there is not enough depth, especially with Rafaelle’s injury history and an even longer schedule this year due to the two new expansion teams joining the league.\nSpeculation season will come to an end soon, but new Vice President of Soccer Operations and General Manager Caitlin Carducci still has weeks left to make additional signings or trades and firm up the roster (hopefully she ensures Own Goal stays for another year). As the preseason opens, it seems like the Pride have backfill options already on the roster to adequately cover every departed player except for Sams, but that $650,000 they received for her is some dry powder that Carducci surely will make use of at some point to acquire additional new talent. Perhaps Anderson, Chavoshi, or another defender will show so much in preseason that those funds can be deployed elsewhere, or maybe Carducci will go center back shopping, but either way, there will be a new center back pairing when the season opens.\nThe countdown is on until the season opener on March 15 at home against Seattle, and while right now most fans are focused on how many days are left until that game, you can be assured that in the front office and among the coaching staff they are having just as many conversations about how to allocate the game minutes as they are how to allocate those practice days.\nBoth conversations matter, but none more than how game minutes will be allocated. Pride leadership will make minute examinations of minute details, parsing minute distinctions to determine who ultimately earns major minutes.\nVamos Pride!\n-\nLion Links2 weeks ago\nLion Links: 1/30/26\n-\nOrlando City1 week ago\nThe Orlando City Off-Season Blues\n-\nOrlando City2 weeks ago\nOrlando City’s Defensive Unit Primary Concern Heading Into Regular Season\n-\nLion Links1 week ago\nLion Links: 2/4/26\n-\nOpinion2 weeks ago\nLikes and Dislikes from the Third Week of Orlando City Preseason\n-\nOrlando City1 week ago\nOrlando City Preseason Notes: Jansson Undergoes Surgery, Lions Sign Nolan Miller\n-\nLion Links2 weeks ago\nLion Links 2/2/26\n-\nLion Links2 weeks ago\nLion Links: 2/3/26",
