  "body_text": "A Letter to the Faithful from Team Reporter Briana\nBriana Jeannel\nDear Faithful,\nGrowing up in the Bay Area, Sundays meant one thing: 49ers football. Some of my earliest memories are of gamedays at Candlestick Park, sitting in the stands, cheering on my hometown team alongside my family, and feeling like I was part of something bigger than myself. Those moments became a part of who I am. When Levi's Stadium was built, I saw it rise from the ground up. Now, it's a place I'm proud to call home.\nToday, I'm beyond grateful to officially step into my new role as the San Francisco 49ers team reporter. This is more than a job for me, it's a dream rooted in childhood memories, family traditions, and a lifelong love for this team and its fans.\nSince joining the organization in 2021, I've had the honor of working alongside incredible storytellers like Keiana Martin and Lindsey Pallares, two women who've represented the 49ers with grace, talent, and heart. I'm proud to help carry on the thoughtful and passionate storytelling that defines this team.\nOver the years, I've grown alongside this team, celebrating incredible highs and witnessing the unforgettable moments that define what it means to be a part of the 49ers. I share a heart with this team and with the Faithful, the best fanbase in the NFL. Your unwavering passion, loyalty, and love for this franchise inspire everything we do.\nAs I step into this role, I'm committed to doing things the \"Forty Niner Way:\" with heart, excellence, and a deep respect for the legacy of this team. I'm honored and humbled to help tell the stories that make this organization so special, and I can't wait for what's ahead.\nLet's do this!\nWith love and gratitude,\nBriana\nUp Next\nLatest Videos Channel\nBoyer Details Kicker Battle, Return Strategy, and Special Teams Growth\nLatest Videos Channel\nRobert Saleh Shares Key Takeaways from Camp, Growth of Young Defense\nLatest Videos Channel\nMac Jones, Brock Purdy Share 49ers Camp Progress\nLatest Videos Channel\nRicky Pearsall, Ji'Ayir Brown Reflect on Growth, Elevated Expectations\nLatest Videos Channel\nBryce Huff, Jake Brendel Reflect on Padded Practice, Rookie Impact\nLatest Videos Channel\nKlay Kubiak Highlights Offensive Depth, Talks 49ers WR Room\nLatest Videos Channel\nSaleh Analyzes Rookie Class, Defensive Growth & First Impressions in Pads\nLatest Videos Channel\nJuszczyk, Pinnock Talk First Day of Pads, Leading the Rookies at Camp\nLatest Videos Channel\n49ers Specialists Talk Camp Competition and Special Teams Goals\nLatest Videos Channel\nBrant Boyer Evaluates Kicker Competition & Special Teams Identity\nLatest Videos Channel\nNot Your Average Entrance.\nLatest Videos Channel\nSome Treasures Were Made to Be Worn.\nLatest Videos Channel\nTrent Williams, Dee Winters Talk Camp Competition and Team Mindset\nLatest Videos Channel\nRobert Saleh Breaks Down Rookie Progress and Defensive Outlook\nLatest Videos Channel\nKyle Shanahan Breaks Down Opening Day of Camp\nLatest Videos Channel\nNick Bosa, George Kittle Talk Training Camp Mindset\nLatest Videos Channel\nBrock Purdy, Fred Warner Discuss Competition and Leadership at Training Camp\nLatest Videos Channel\nLynch, Shanahan Preview 2025 Training Camp, Share Key WR Updates\nLatest Videos Channel\n49ers FLAG x SF City Girls Flag Skills Camp\nLatest Videos Channel\n49ers PREP x SF City Taube Tackle Skills Camp\nLatest Videos Channel\n49ers EDU Selects Bay Area Teachers as 2025 'Follow Your Bliss' Award Recipients\nLatest Videos Channel\n49ers Foundation Host High School Female Student-Athletes for T.H.I.N.K.
