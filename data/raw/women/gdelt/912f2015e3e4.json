  "body_text": "RANKED: The 10 best WSL defenders on current form\n- The WSL has just eight gameweeks remaining in the 2024/25 season\n- Emily Fox, Jayde Riviere and Lucy Bronze have been strong for their sides\n- 90min has ranked the top ten defenders in the league right now\nThis Women's Super League (WSL) season has seen several defenders take their games to the next level, underlining why it is arguably the best domestic competition in the world.\nFrom no-nonsense centre-backs to dynamic wide defenders, the WSL has witnessed one of its most accomplished defensive seasons yet.\nWith Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester United all recording nine clean sheets, the campaign has showcased an exceptional level of defending. Even the once regular thrashings when big clubs met struggling sides are now generally a thing of the past.\nHere, 90min ranks the top then defenders in the WSL right now...\n10. CJ Bott (Leicester City)\nCJ Bott's league form has flown under the radar so far this season. The Leicester City full-back has been one of the most defensively sound players in the WSL, ranking in the top ten per cent of defenders for recoveries, duels won and interceptions.\n9. Millie Turner (Man Utd)\nDespite the fact that Manchester United currently trail Chelsea by seven points at the top of the league standings, the team have had the most impressive campaign in the WSL so far. Holding nine clean sheets and conceding just six goals, the Red Devils have been rock solid.\nMillie Turner has been at the centre of that structure, holding the space at the centre of defence alongside Maya Le Tissier. Turner provides strong presence at the back, as well as a key target for attacking set-pieces.\n8. Leah Williamson (Arsenal)\nLeah Williamson endured a tough road back from her 2023 ACL injury, initially sidelined with several minor setbacks as built up her minutes.\nNow, it is safe to say that she is back at her very best. Williamson's ability to open up play with her pinpoint distribution has been integral to Arsenal's reform under Renee Slegers. The England captain has returned to the most carefree and confident version of herself, and it is showing on the pitch.\n7. Maria Thorisdottir (Brighton & Hove Albion)\nDespite the fact that Brighton & Hove Albion have endured some rocky moments in recent weeks, Maria Thorisdottir has been strong at the back.\nA no-nonsence centre back with impressive aerial threat, Thorisdottir has been a real asset for Dario Vidosic's side.\n6. Natalie Bjorn (Chelsea)\nWhen the news broke that centre back Kadeisha Buchanan had ruptured her ACL, many fans were concerned on how the injury would hinder Chelsea's defensive strength. Enter, Nathalie Bjorn.\nThe Sweden international has been near-perfect since slotting into the starting lineup last January, complementing Millie Bright well at the heart of defence. Bjorn's strong performance against Arsenal helped the Blues extend their lead at the top of the league standings.\n5. Lucy Bronze (Chelsea)\nA statement signing of the summer window has transpired into something brilliant for Chelsea as Lucy Bronze continues her strong form. The Lionesses right-back has brought a new level to this Chelsea side, holding off attackers whilst streaming down the wing to aid the Blues going forward.\nWith many beginning to think that we may have reached the end of the Bronze era, the defender has proved why she is still at her very best.\n4. Sara Holmgaard (Everton)\nSara Holmgaard may just be one of the most underrated players in the WSL right now. The Everton full-back has been integral to the side this season, pivotal in important results against Manchester City and Arsenal.\nWhilst also being a strong defender, Holmgaard's delivery is where she makes the difference. It feels like the Dane can locate teammates with her eyes closed, catalysing attacks from open play and set pieces.\n3. Maya Le Tissier (Man Utd)\nFollowing the departure of former captain Katie Zelem at the end of last season, it was confirmed that Maya Le Tissier would take over the Manchester United armband. Despite the fact that United's new leader is just 22, she is one of the strongest presences in the league.\nThe centre-back has been instrumental in United's defensive run this season, dictating the back four with authority whilst leading by example.\n2. Jayde Riviere (Man Utd)\nAfter struggling to maintain her playing time last season due to persistent minor injury worries, Jayde Riviere entered the 2024/25 campaign as a fresh player. The Canadian right-back has been firing for Manchester United, dictating the channels with flair and excitement.\nAt just 24 years of age, she still has years ahead of her too.\n1. Emily Fox (Arsenal)\nEmily Fox has been one of the most consistent players in the WSL all season, starting every league game for Arsenal.\nThe American right-back has iron lungs, constantly covering her channel from box to box with intense work rate. Fox's overlapping ability provides Arsenal with a strong threat going forward. Recently on the scoresheet with a star spangled banger against Tottenham in the north London derby, Fox has a case to be one of the best full-backs in the world.",
