It's magnificent!\"\n\"Chengdu's technology, culture and way of living are inspiring,\" Bonomi said, adding that she felt like a little girl going through an adventure park.\nSydney Martin, a gold medalist from the United States cheerleading pom doubles team, said she and her teammates had a memorable experience visiting giant pandas and exploring different parts of Chengdu.\n\"We took a boat cruise, ate hotpot and watched Sichuan Opera. These were all things we never expected before we came, and it was truly amazing,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, many niche sports found new fans in China thanks to the Chengdu games.\nAlexander Kallai, a representative of the International Casting Sport Federation, said his federation's promotion in Chengdu during the games attracted local residents across all age groups.\n\"Casting has much in common with recreational angling, and given China's massive angling community, we see tremendous potential for its growth here,\" he said.\nRan Jiaqing, a student at the Civil Aviation Flight University of China and a volunteer at the games, said he tried all the niche sports at The World Games Plaza during breaks.\n\"The games have ignited my and my schoolmates' passion for niche sports,\" he said.\nXu Xingguo, executive vice-president and secretary-general of the games executive committee and vice-mayor of Chengdu, said that while preparing for The World Games, the city launched experience programs for the featured sports in over 1,000 communities.\nChengdu has also incorporated sports such as flag football and breaking into the curricula of 130 local schools, reaching more than 50,000 students, Xu said.\nThe proportion of Chengdu citizens participating in emerging trendy sports has reached 18 percent, he added.\n责任编辑： 李想\n扫码下载新海南客户端\n扫码关注南海网微信公众号\n- 违法和不良信息举报邮箱：nhwwljb@163.com\n- 互联网新闻信息服务许可证：4612006002\n- 增值电信业务经营许可证：琼B2-2008008\n- 违法和不良信息举报电话: 0898-66802310\n- 信息网络传播视听节目许可证：2108281\n- 广告经营许可证：460000100120\n- 南海网备案号 琼ICP备09005000号\n- 互联网出版许可证：琼字001号\n- 琼公网监备号：46010602000273号",
