He was honored at both wide receiver and kick returner, excelling at both positions. He is still UW’s all-time leader in all-purpose yardage with 5,921 for his career, as well as kickoff return yards (2,016) and average yards per game (126). He holds the single-game record for kickoff return yardage with 219 against Utah in 2005. He ranks fifth on the all-time list for touchdowns scored with 30. He led the Cowboys to the 2004 Las Vegas Bowl and a victory over UCLA, a game in which he had 107 receiving yards and even threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to backup quarterback J.J. Raterink on a trick play. In his senior season of 2005, Bouknight was a semifinalist for the Biletnikoff Award (presented to the nation’s top collegiate wide receiver), while leading the Mountain West Conference in receiving yards, all-purpose yards, and touchdowns, as well as ranking number two in kickoff returns. He ranked among the top 15 players in the nation in each of those three categories that year.\nKELSEY CONCI\nSwimming, 2009-2012\nHometown: Craig, Colorado\nA two-time All-American, Kelsey Conci finished her career as the school record holder in the 100 freestyle, the 100 backstroke, the 200 and the 400 medley relays and the 200 and 400 freestyle relays. She won the Mountain West 100 backstroke event both her junior and senior years and qualified for the NCAA Swimming Championships, earning All-American status both years, becoming the first women’s swimmer to record back-to-back All-American years. During her senior season of 2012, she was undefeated in the 100 backstroke in dual meets. She competed at the Olympic Team Trials and became the first UW women’s swimmer to make it to the semi-finals.\nDIANE DODSON\nAdministration\nHometown: Torrington, WY\nFor 37 years Diane Dodson has worked tirelessly to promote University of Wyoming athletics in her various roles within the Media Relations office, as well as serving as the Executive Administrative Assistant to the Hall of Fame since its inception in 1993. Her service to UW began as an office associate in Sports Information and grew into the role of Media Relations Office Manager, and to her current position as Assistant Media Relations Director for Operations. She has been one of the “faces” of Wyoming Athletics as she interacts with media, alumni, fans, coaches, student-athletes athletic administrators/staff and staff members across the UW campus, and Hall of Fame inductees. She has been responsible for the coordination of media credentials to local, regional and national media attending UW athletics events as well as game-day media operations for home football games and Cowboy and Cowgirl basketball games. She has been an outstanding mentor to the media relations staffers throughout her amazing career. Dodson has been equally valuable to the Hall of Fame itself, providing administrative support to the committee, maintaining historical records, coordinating nominations, and serving as the main point of contact for both past and new Hall of Fame inductees. Her service to UW, and the athletics department has been unequalled.\nADAM GOLDBERG\nFootball, 1999-2002\nHometown: Edina, Minnesota\nA three-time All-Mountain West Conference offensive tackle, Goldberg started 44 of 45 career games for the Cowboys. As a senior, he was selected to the Outland Trophy Watch List prior to the 2002 season and was a first-team all- conference selection. A left tackle, he was one of the premier offensive linemen in the Mountain West Conference. A team captain as a junior, he earned first-team all-Mountain West Conference honors in 2001. He earned second-team all-conference honors as a sophomore. As a redshirt freshman in 1999, he started all 11 games at left tackle. His first career start came against defending national champion Tennessee in Knoxville in the opening game of the 1999 season. He was selected to play in the Rotary Gridiron Classic College All-Star Game after the 2002 season. An undrafted free agent, he played for the Minnesota Vikings and the St. Louis Rams in the NFL for several seasons.\nJOE LEGERSKI\nWomen’s Basketball Coach, 2004-2019\nHometown: Rock Springs, WY\nThe winningest coach in Wyoming women’s basketball history, Legerski coached the Cowgirls to 314 wins, ten seasons of at least 20 wins, and a school-record 27 wins and a WNIT national championship in 2007. Coaching at his alma mater, he earned three Mountain West Coach of the Year awards and coached five All-Americans during his sixteen seasons as head coach. The all-time Cowgirl attendance record was set during his tenure in 2007 with a sellout of the Arena-Auditorium for the WNIT championship game. He coached the Cowgirls to their first NCAA Tournament appearance and their first national rankings in 2008. Legerski coached two Mountain West Players of the Year, three MW Defensive Players of the Year, three MW Newcomers of the Year, two MW Sixth Players of the Year, and 21 All-Mountain West performers. Twelve of the twenty-six Cowgirl basketball players who scored one-thousand points in school history played for Coach Legerski. Legerski retired in 2019 after a season in which his Cowgirls won 25 games and advanced to the quarterfinals of the WNIT.\nJIM SANCHEZ\nCross Country Coach, 1981-2003\nHometown: La Jara, Colorado\nSanchez coached the UW men’s and women’s cross country teams for twenty-two years. He was selected as the Western Athletic Conference Coach of the Year five times. His teams won two WAC championships, with seven second-place finishes and eight third-place finishes. During his time at UW, he coached 14 NCAA All-Americans. An excellent motivator, he studied the mechanics of cross country running so he could help his athletes improve. He was an extremely popular coach and many of his student-athletes considered him a mentor and friend long after their competitive days were over. He was the coach in September 2001 when eight cross country athletes were tragically killed in a car accident. He was widely credited with comforting the remaining team members and guiding them through the devastating loss, as well as rebuilding the program.\nJIL ROBINS THOMASON\nVolleyball, 1991-94\nHometown: Bend, Oregon\nRobins was named an All-Region selection by the American Volleyball Coaches Association in 1994, one of only nine Cowgirls in UW history to earn that honor. As the setter for the 1994 volleyball team, she earned all-Western Athletic Conference first-team honors while leading Wyoming to the NCAA Tournament. With her quarterbacking the offense, the 1994 Cowgirls set and still own the school record for most kills in a single season and most assists in a single season. An extremely versatile player, Robins ranked third on the Wyoming career assist list at the end of her career and still ranks fifth in career assists today. She also ranks seventh on the career service aces list and seventh in digs. A four-year letterwinner, Robins also holds the second best single-season assist total in Cowgirl history, set in 1994. She was named Most Valuable Player of the 1993 team.\nPrevious inductees by class:\nClass of 1993: Dick Ballinger, (wrestling, 1958-60); Fennis Dembo (men's basketball, 1985-88); Mike Dirks (football, 1965-67); Jerry Hill (football, 1958-60); Glenn J. \"Red\" Jacoby (athletic director, 1946-73); Jay Novacek (football and track, 1982-84); Kenny Sailors (men's basketball, 1941-46); Everett Shelton (men's basketball coach, 1939-59); Johnny Winterholler (football, baseball, and basketball, 1936-39); 1943 National Champion basketball team.\nClass of 1994: Paul Carlin (track, 1951-53); George \"Duke\" Humphrey (president, 1945-64); Everett Lantz (wrestling coach, 1937-65); Flynn Robinson (men's basketball, 1963-65); Mary Shea (volleyball, 1980-83); Bill Strannigan (men's basketball, 1941-42); Ken Sturman (football, 1937-39); Eddie Talboom (football, 1948-50) Bowden Wyatt (football coach, 1947-52); 1950 Gator Bowl football team.\nClass of 1995: Jack Aggers (trainer, 1958-84)); Jim Crawford (football, 1954-56); John Corbett (administration, 1915-39); Bob Devaney (football coach, 1957-61); John Kosich (football, baseball, 1946-49); Dewey McConnell (football, 1949-51); Pat Miller-Davis (track and field, 1980-82).\nClass of 1996: Larry Birleffi (broadcaster, 1947-86); Charles W. \"Tub\" Bradley (basketball, 1979-81); Glenn R. \"Bud\" Daniel (baseball coach, 1951-61, 1963-71); Michele Hoppes Daum (basketball, 1984-87); Jim Kiick (football, 1965-67); Mark Miller (swimming, 1985-88); Milward L.
