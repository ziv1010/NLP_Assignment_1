I would like to take this opportunity to repeat that it was never my intention to do anything other than pay the right amount.\"\nSir Laurie said in a report presented to the Prime Minister: \"Accordingly, it is with deep regret that I must advise you that in these circumstances, I consider the Code to have been breached.\"\nSir Keir was asked if Ms Rayner was the victim of a sexist and classist \"briefing war\", as some of her allies have claimed.\nHe told BBC Radio 5 Live's Matt Chorley: \"Angela came from a very humble background, battled all sorts of challenges along the way, and there she is proudly - and I'm proud of her - as our deputy prime minister.\"",
