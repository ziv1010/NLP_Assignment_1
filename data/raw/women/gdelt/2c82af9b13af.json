The 27-year-old is the WSL's all-time top scorer with 79 goals. As a Gunner, she managed 125 goals and 50 assists in 172 appearances.\nBut it transpired that Arsenal didn't offer the Netherlands international a new deal.\nMiedema has now spoken candidly for the first time about her Arsenal exit with former USWNT midfielder Sam Mewis on the Friendlies podcast.\nThe 27-year-old admitted that she found it difficult returning from ten months out of action after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury in late 2022, shortly after signing her last contract.\n\"I decided to re-sign two years ago because at that moment in time I thought Arsenal were going in the right direction, and I always believe that if I'm happy off the pitch, I'm good on the pitch,\" she said. \"And, I thought London feels like home, so let's do it again.\n\"Obviously, with the injuries and with the struggles I've had lately, it's been really difficult to be around the club and to be at the club sometimes. And I think from both sides we realised this wasn't the fit it was two years ago anymore, and from there on you need to look to the future.\"\nAs a result, Miedema admitted that she actually debated ending the chapter even earlier: \"I had been speaking to clubs in winter, and I was really close to potentially moving.\n\"And from there, my focus has always been on getting fit and moving forward somewhere else. Obviously it's sad, and when you've been somewhere for so long, you've been part of the club, part of their development. But I think it's the best thing for me, and hopefully I can show that next year someplace else.\"\nMiedema confirmed that she has decided which club she will be joining, and is hopeful it will be announced soon. 90min understands that Manchester City are the frontrunners to sign her. The player's preference is to remain in England and a Bayern Munich source has confirmed to 90min there has been no approach from her old club.",
