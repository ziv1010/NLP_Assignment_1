Make yourself one and join me at our own Algonquin Round Table, the spirit of Dorothy Parker abides.\nIt’s Sunday, dear friends. Bright summer skies that seem to belie the tragedy of yesterday’s assassination attempt on Donald Trump. So fill up and pass around the flutes. Let’s offer our first toast to the continued health of 45 and prayers to the families of innocent victims of the assassin. What a way to end the week.\nThough, I can’t say I haven’t been entertained by the clown car that passes for the Democratic Party careening about their circus tent as they try to wrest the wheel from Creepy Joe “Doctor” Jill. Jill “Edith Wilson” Biden is clinging to her perks like a Hunter to his crack pipe. And, boy howdy, she hates VP Roundheels with a passion! The DNC convention in a month is gonna be lit. In addition to the wonderful brunch I’ve assembled for your gastronomic delight, I’ve arranged for a gourmet popcorn bar. Fill up a bag or three on the way home. Apropos for this election season, right? Now, let’s get to it. L’Chaim!\n*******************************\nEvery House democrat just voted to\n-keep men in women's sports\n-put men in women's bathrooms & locker rooms\n-house men in women's dorms\n-control your speech & demand the language by which you call these menEvery. Single. Democrat…even those with daughters of their own. Evil. pic.twitter.com/xkGC6NVmpr\n— Riley Gaines (@Riley_Gaines_) July 11, 2024\nThe Left isn’t interested in women’s rights as inherent to individuals. “Group rights” is what animates the woke neo-Marxists and right now, males-in-dresses are a few rungs up the intersectional ladder from mere women. And the Handmaids of the Left are participating in their own debasement.\n*******************************\nWhile Gavin Newsom (remember, he is running for President) tries to tell everyone to not believe their lyin’ eyes and that crime is down in the state, we get a really good example of why what’s on paper doesn’t match reality.\nThe City of Sacramento, California threatened to fine a popular retail store for public nuisance over numerous calls to police after thieves repeatedly targeted its Land Park location, according to a report.\nThe Sacramento Bee reported that officials warned they would fine the Target at 2505 Riverside Boulevard in Land Park during the past year. A police spokesperson confirmed the location. (snip)\n“Newsom keeps insisting that reports of theft are dropping – well now we know why. Not only are thieves let off without even a slap on the wrist, but now the victims are being threatened for even reporting crimes,” said California Assembly GOP Leader James Gallagher.\nCriminal defense attorney Nicole Castronova criticized lawmakers for leaving citizens vulnerable and allowing crime to flourish. She noted that retailers are being victimized by both thieves and the government.\nCalifornia has long been known as the worst place in the nation to start and own a business. In Sacramento, retail shops faced with criminal thieves should just lay back and ignore it.\n*******************************\nDespite years of taxpayers being bamboozled into voting for “water bonds”, like Charlie Brown believing that Lucy won’t pull the football this time, Newsom and his merry band of criminal Democrats are giggling while they yank all that lovely money away from taxpayers and put the ration screws to them.\nCalifornia is imposing \"permanent water restrictions\" for the first time ever. This comes after 20,000 cubic feet per second flowed to the ocean last year because of inadequate storage.\nUnder the order, rationing and low-flow device mandates will be used to reduce water 30… pic.twitter.com/jAJv9JcwBy\n— Kevin Kiley (@KevinKileyCA) July 11, 2024\nThe last new reservoir built in California was 1979. Remember, Gavin Newsom is running for President.\n*******************************\nVP Roundheels, the “Border Czar” … oh, excuse me a moment, I think I snorted a bit of champagne up my nose on that one … is already measuring for new drapes in the Oval Office. So, let’s not let Democrats forget we know what Missy Cackles is all about.\nSince she’s probably going to be running for President, it’s important people remember that Kamala Harris – in August of 2020 – encouraged the BLM Riots that killed over 25 and caused billions in damage. pic.twitter.com/IwwO5S1kav\n— Eric Matheny ️ (@ericmmatheny) July 4, 2024\n*******************************\nAt least that’s what Creepy Joe’s military leaders are teaching now …\nA U.S. Army base training presentation described two pro-life organizations as “terrorist groups,” according to a watchdog report confirmed by the military.\nThe training material was part of an “anti-terrorism brief” at Fort Liberty, formerly Fort Bragg, in North Carolina, independent journalist Sam Shoemate reported on X\nForget that there at least 50 illegal aliens with ties to ISIS wandering about the United States right now, there are American citizens with pro-life license plates on their cars who just might do something more nefarious than 9/11 or bombing the Boston marathon. You know, like donating money to a pregnancy center to support moms-in-need.\nThe slide also showed an image of specialty pro-life license plates, which are available in many states. The proceeds fund pregnancy support services for families in need, according to Choose Life America, the organization that promotes them.\nHowever, the slide suggested the specialty plates are something soldiers should watch for as a potential sign of a terrorist, according to Shoemate’s report.\nQuelle horreur!!\n*******************************\n“Democrats right now” pic.twitter.com/yJWr5KRHXY\n— Conservative Momma (@conmomma) July 9, 2024\n*******************************\nKyle Adamkiewicz, 33, has lived with epilepsy since being diagnosed at age 6. He is now combining his love of art with the power of nature to help bring his seizure disorder into the spotlight.\nIn Oct. 2022, Adamkiewicz began collecting seashells from the New Jersey shore, then painting and decorating them with heartfelt messages in search of a cure. He places his works of art along the seaside boardwalks in the hopes that they will inspire strangers to spread the word — and the shells.\nPeople with debilitating conditions already have so much challenge in their lives on a daily basis. But Kyle has taken up, as much as possible, the reins to his own life to the point of giving back.\nAdamkiewicz estimates that he’s painted some 1,100 shells so far.\nMany include messages about finding a cure for epilepsy, but he has also created themed designs for various occasions, like Shark Week and Halloween. (snip)\nIn addition to a hand-painted design, each shell contains Adamkiewicz’s initials, the year he decorated it and a QR code.\nWhen people find the shells and scan the QR code, it takes them to a website. From there, they can access Adamkiewicz’s Facebook group, his Instagram account and a GoFundMe page set up to help raise funds for people to get “seizure alert” dogs.\nThis young man has had a rough life with his condition. At age 6, he was experiencing upwards of 100 seizure a day. Yet he has grown into a thoughtful young man who wants to give back.\nBravo.\n*******************************\nWell, dears, another Sunday here and gone. Next week is the RNC convention, which promises some fireworks on their own. Not the least of which will be the hyperventilating and fainting spells from Lamestream media about the danger non-left folk present to Our Democracy. Now don’t roll your eyes too hard, you’ll give yourself a headache! Enjoy the rest of this bright summer day and I’ll see you here next week. Cheers!\nfeatured image original graphic by Darleen Click\n-\nI had read a little about the Pro-Life folks being considered terrorists, and suspect that they may have gotten the list from SPLC.\nIt’s nice to know that I am now considered a terrorist, because I have a pro-life license plate on my car.\n-\nBeing called a terrorist by a hate group like the SPLC is a badge of honor.\n-\nSPLC is abut as credible as NAACP and ACLU…\n-\n-\n-\n[…] Victory Girls Blog has Sunday morning cafe cocktails linkage.
