  "body_text": "John Herdman has emerged as a possibility to take over Toronto FC’s vacant head coaching job, The Athletic has learned Monday.\nCanada’s men’s national team head coach is not believed to have had a formal interview for the position, but multiple sources familiar with the hiring process told The Athletic he has had informal conversations with TFC about what the job entails.\nAdvertisement\nMultiple sources told The Athletic that Bobby Smyrniotis, head coach of the Canadian Premier League’s Forge FC, and current D.C. United assistant Carl Robinson are among the other prospective coaches who have had formal interviews for the position.\nToronto FC has been without a permanent head coach since parting ways with former head coach and sporting director Bob Bradley at the end of June. Terry Dunfield has served as interim head coach since then, with Jason Hernandez serving as sporting director.\nHerdman’s contract as Canada’s men’s national team head coach runs through the 2026 World Cup, according to former Canada Soccer general secretary Earl Cochrane.\nEven without a formal interview, the conversations suggest a level of mutual interest from both Herdman and TFC.\nIn his current position, Herdman is seen as being responsible for overhauling the Canadian men’s team’s backroom culture and uncovering key up-and-coming players. Herdman oversaw a once-underwhelming Canadian side rise to the top of the CONCACAF World Cup qualifying table, leading the side to the 2022 World Cup, Canada’s first qualification for the tournament since 1986.\nYet since qualification, Canada has regressed. The team lost all three of its games at the World Cup, becoming just one of two teams not to get a result in Qatar. It then faltered in the Nations League finals, being outclassed by the United States in a 2-0 loss in the final. Canada then lost to the United States again in the 2023 Gold Cup before being eliminated on penalties in the quarterfinal.\nThese results, coupled with the consistent turmoil off the field surrounding the men’s team and their lack of a contract with Canada Soccer, have cast a shadow over the men’s national team in 2023.\nWhy would Herdman be interested in the TFC job?\nDespite having one of the largest payrolls in the league and having two of the most talented players in MLS on its roster, TFC’s 2023 season has been disastrous. In-fighting between teammates and Bradley coupled with underperforming stars has led to one of the worst seasons in TFC history, with the club in second-last place in MLS. TFC has scored just 18 goals in 24 games.\nAdvertisement\nYet the opportunity to build TFC back to its former glory would be appealing for any prospective head coach. TFC’s owners, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, remain among the highest spenders in MLS. Herdman would have the kind of consistent financial resources at his disposal that he doesn’t always enjoy with Canada Soccer, which continues to operate in dire financial straits.\nWhile Herdman has enjoyed levels of success in the international game, including with New Zealand and Canada’s women’s national teams, taking the TFC job would be a prime chance for Herdman to prove himself at the club level.\nFor TFC, Herdman would be a recognized name that would raise the interest level in the club locally after a horrendous season. TFC President Bill Manning has never shied away from his intentions to make the team a destination for national team players ahead of 2026. Prying Herdman away from Canada Soccer could be a step in that direction.\nWould Herdman leave Canada Soccer ahead of the 2026 World Cup?\nHerdman has long praised the opportunities that come with playing a World Cup on home soil. He has experience doing that, running the women’s national team when Canada hosted the 2015 World Cup. Given the exposure that comes with playing a World Cup at home, as Canada will in 2026, it would take a lucrative offer for Herdman to leave his job.\nThat said, it’s worth asking whether recent results have changed the outlook for Herdman with less than three years to go before the World Cup. Furthermore, Herdman has recently been openly critical of Canada Soccer and its lack of financial resources.\n“We’re not serious,” Herdman said of Canada Soccer after the Nations League final. “We’ve brought a World Cup to our country, and we’re not serious about winning it.”\nCanada Soccer’s poor financial state meant the men’s team could not afford to book any friendlies in the upcoming September international window.\n(Photo: Candice Ward /USSF / Getty Images for USSF)",
