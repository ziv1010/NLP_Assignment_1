  "body_text": "The United States Women’s National Team is back in action after opening the year with an underwhelming second-place finish at the SheBelieves Cup, albeit with a roster that was missing several key performers. Next on the schedule awaits what has been dubbed “Olympic Gold Medal Rematches,” with two friendlies against Brazil. The South American power has maintained consistent dominance and put in strong showings at global competitions, continuing to keep pace with a rising tide. The first match is set for SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, a 70,240-seat venue with a recently-installed “natural grass test system”; San Jose, California’s PayPal Park, an 18,000-seat soccer-specific stadium with a hybrid SISGrass surface, will host the latter fixture.\nUSA vs. Brazil, 2025 Friendly: Scouting Brazil\nThe two sides meet for the first time after the Olympic final.\nThese are the 42nd and 43rd all-time meetings between the two nations, with the USWNT holding a 33-3-5 advantage and triumphing most recently in the Olympic final. Ranked eighth internationally by FIFA, Brazil has been on an undefeated friendly run since claiming the silver medal with a draw and a win against Colombia (1-1 and 3-1) and two road warrior victories over Australia (3-1 and 2-1). Seleção (The National Squad) reigns as the clear dominant program in South America with eight out of nine Copa América titles and appears to be the odds-on favorite to claim another trophy this summer.\nAppointed in September of 2023, Arthur Elias took over for Pia Sundhage and hit the ground running, feeling that his team can “lift their heads” after claiming the silver medal at the Olympics. The 43-year-old from São Paulo was a well-regarded domestic manager who won a bevy of titles at the club level with Corinthians, including four Copa Libertadores. He expressed positivity at the first training camp of the year, believing that the group was able to “further develop [their] game model” without “any type of incident,” instead focusing on “improvement in ideas and execution with possession of the ball, attacking behavior, and transitions.”\nElias named a 23-player roster for the pair of friendlies, a young group that demonstrates the commitment to “renewal” for the current World Cup cycle. The domestic Campeonato Brasileiro is home to nine of the call-ups, while five compete in the National Women’s Soccer League and seven are on the books of European clubs. Notable absences include Rafaelle, Ary Borges, Ana Vitória, Vitória Yaya, and Priscila.\n***\nGOALKEEPERS (3): Lorena (Kansas City Current), Natascha (Palmeiras), Camila (Cruzeiro)\nDEFENDERS (8): Tarciane (Lyon), Isa Haas (Cruzeiro), Kaká (São Paulo), Lauren (Atlético de Madrid), Bruninha (Gotham), Antônia (Real Madrid), Yasmim (Real Madrid), Fê Palermo (Palmeiras)\nMIDFIELDERS (4): Duda Sampaio (Corinthians), Angelina (Orlando Pride), Laís Estevam (Palmeiras), Mariza (Corinthians)\nFORWARDS (8): Adriana (Al-Qadsiah), Gio (Atlético de Madrid), Jheniffer (Tigres), Amanda Gutierres (Palmeiras), Kerolin (Manchester City), Gabi Portilho (Gotham), Ludmila (Chicago Stars), Luany (Atlético de Madrid)\n***\nWith intense study and preparation, Elias juggles tactics depending on the opponent but seems to prefer the 3-5-2 or 3-4-2-1 formations, pressing high against teams that play out of the back. Total Football Analysis describes the defensive set-up as “aggressive,” forcing the game to the sides and limiting passing options in order to create turnovers and quickly transition into the counter. However, Brazil is methodical during the build-up phase, whether surging through the lines or attempting more direct medium-range balls to the wing.\nOver the past few months, Elias rotated the goalkeeper position between two options. Lorena has been in the number-one role for several years and recently joined the Kansas City Current, using her imposing six-foot size to cover the frame and also corral crosses with ease. She is quick to come off of her line and displays decent enough footwork to adjust and regain an angle, comfortable when facing down the opponent on short- and long-range opportunities. Former Switzerland youth international Natascha Honegger has been steadily receiving more matches, providing another tall option in net but more of a shot-stopper presence with deliberate movement. The Palmeiras 27-year-old was named the Best Goalkeeper due to “shining” during the triumphant 2024 Campeonato Paulista campaign, providing “decisive saves, especially during the final stages” and “guaranteed [her] team safety in moments of the greatest pressure.”\nIsa Haas is the new addition to the lineup, making her senior debut after the Olympics and picking up four friendly starts by using her “maturity and strength to neutralize” attackers. The 24-year-old Cruzeiro centre-back employs a physical style that set the tone against Australia while also displaying leadership and “a skilled ball release” that leads to line-clearing balls over the top. After a single season with the Houston Dash, Tarciane was the subject of one of the largest transfer fees in NWSL, bringing “one of the best young players in the world” to Lyon. Standing at six-feet tall, she has a rangy athleticism with a long stride to chase down opponents, obvious aerial prowess, long distribution, and a willingness to send a message with some instigation. At the young age of 22, Lauren is already well traveled with stops at São Paulo, Centro Olímpico, Madrid CFF, the Kansas City Current, and now Atlético Madrid, emerging as one of the top passers in Liga F. Her athleticism enables her to chase down pacey wingers on the outside, but her the size and strength allow her to engage with physical forwards and win headers in both boxes. There is also the potential for São Paulo’s Kaká to feature following an “eye-catching campaign” that saw her lead the Tricolor to a second-place finish in the domestic league and win the ensuing Supercopa do Brasil title. Following “a period of adaptation,” her “firm and confident performances” along with a nose for the goal have the Brasiliense pushing for a spot in the rotation amidst significant program turnover.\nAfter a decorated tenure with Corinthians, Yasmim made the jump to Real Madrid and has jumped into the starting lineup, registering solid per-90 statistics in the attacking and build-up phases. She can be quite productive in the final third and has a fantastic free kick, capable of beating goalkeepers from distance with a hard, bending shot. On the other side of the formation, Ludmila had an encouraging first few months in the NWSL with three goals in seven appearances, carrying over her scoring prowess from Atlético Madrid. The 30-year-old Chicago Stars wide player is devastating off of the dribble and constantly looks to run directly at opponents but also employs a tireless effort. The experienced Adriana of Al Qadsiah should also factor into proceedings following three finishes for Brazil in 2024, bringing speed on the outside and the ability to act as an additional forward in the final third. Known as Maga (the Wizard), her “great technical ability and work rate” endue her with the ability to “set the tone for pressure and defensive shape,” providing accurate tackles and a good rate of success in aerial duels.\nWith “refined passing and creativity,” Duda Sampaio is one of “the best midfielders in Brazil” with a vast array of accolades born from her dominant work in the build-up, replete with pressure avoidance and shutdown of the opponents. The 23-year-old at Corinthians prevents her team from getting trapped in the defensive half and “is constantly seen moving up the field” into advanced areas, serving as a progressor and facilitator. New Jersey-born Angelina recently entered her fifth season in the NWSL, having spent time with OL Reign and the Orlando Pride, with 24 combined appearances and two goals in 2024. Total Football Analysis praises her as a versatile option with “outstanding interception abilities and physical strength” while also providing an element of “influential playmaking” that gives her a balanced profile. Manchester City’s Kerolin is a dynamic “difference maker” who boasts “searing pace and an eye for goal,” displaying “clever movements in the box, quality on the ball, and [the] ability to go on either foot.” She can deploy in a variety of positions but does her best work when receiving the ball in transition and charging into the final third, jockeying with defenders and placing her shots into the corner. For another offensive option, Lais Estevam of Palmeiras is a regular source of production at the club level with an aggressive style and a willingness to fight for her chances in the box. In addition to setting up teammates, her late runs into the box and streak of opportunism or luck make her an intriguing figure who can open up crowded areas.\nFormer United States youth international Giovana “Gio” Queiroz has struggled to find her spot at the professional level due to “injuries and a lack of continuity,” having passed through Barcelona and Arsenal before landing at Atlético Madrid and “getting her confidence back.” She likes to “press high, get forward quickly, and go one-on-one,” displaying “change of pace and brilliant ball-carrying abilities that are particularly dangerous weapons on counterattacks” with the abilities to create and score. After several decorated seasons at Corinthians, Gabi Portilho moved to NJ/NY Gotham FC and began her NWSL tenure with a fantastic volleyed finish from the top of the box. The “star of the Olympic Football Tournament” looks to drive inside with weaving dribbling runs and also has the innate sense of movement in the box to get onto the end of crosses. The five-foot-nine Amanda Gutierres contributed nearly a goal per game over the past two years with a dizzying array of conversions that utilize her combination of speed, strength, and comfort with the ball at her feet. The 24-year-old Palmeiras striker scored two goals in the 3-1 victory over Australia and could become one of the leaders during the current World Cup cycle, filling the role of a poacher at the top of the formation.\nDespite the recent gold medal, the USWNT remains in a transitional phase and will benefit from continuing to compete against quality opposition. Brazil looks to maintain standing as the top dog in CONMEBOL and ideally close the gap with the world’s top programs, continuing to hunt for a first global title. Over the course of the two friendlies, both managers will likely shuffle the deck with mass substitutions and test out different tactical tweaks, which could lead to unpredictable results.\nThe first match is scheduled for Saturday, April 5th at 5:00 p.m. Eastern, 2:00 p.m. Pacific. Viewing options include TNT, truTV, Telemundo, Universo, Max, Peacock, and FUBO TV (free trial).\nThe second match is scheduled for Tuesday, April 8th at 10:30 p.m. Eastern, 7:30 p.m. Pacific. Viewing options include TBS, truTV, Universo, Max, Peacock, and FUBO TV (free trial).",
