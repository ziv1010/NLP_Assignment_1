But we are finally getting a reprieve for a couple of days as the rain chances disappear, and the heat gets applied. Those record highs out west are moving our way as daytime highs through mid-next week will hover near 90 degrees each day.\nThere are no rain chances in the forecast today and tomorrow but don't get used to it. Small chances for rain return in the early hours of Saturday morning and stick around all weekend. They could play havoc with the Tuscaloosa Softball Regional schedule this weekend.\nThe Forecast:\nDemocrats in the House and Senate have argued against the bill at every opportunity and now it needs a Senate vote and then a House concurrence vote to agree with a change made in a Senate committee.\nSingleton said Democrats will try to amend the bill further on Wednesday. He said he expects Republicans to cloture Democrats, meaning debate is stopped to keep Democrats from delaying votes.\nAlso raising a red flag with Democrats are a number of bills targeting illegal immigration that the GOP hopes to pass through the Legislature by the end of the day today.\nJudge Denies \"Stand Your Ground\" Claim in Fatal Shooting of TPD Officer\nLuther Bernard Watkins, Jr will stand trial in September for the shooting death of TPD Investigator Dornell Cousette in September 2019.

Under the act, the attorney general or a district attorney must request the appointments.\nSports:\nBama Women's Rowing Looking for New Head Coach\nAfter leading the team to a recent 3rd place finish in the SEC Women's Rowing Championship and numerous accolades in previous years, University of Alabama Coach Glenn Putyrae the for the last seven seasons, is stepping down.\nPutyrae first arrived at Alabama by way of Gonzaga, where he coached in two stints. He was named the 2019 Big 12 Coach of the Year.

He ruled that the league’s punishment of banned individuals ends after their deaths.\nAfter years of denial, Rose admitted he bet on baseball games, however, he always maintained her never bet against his team. Joe Jackson, better known as \"Shoeless Joe \", was banned after he got tangled up with the \"Black Sox Scandal\".\nJackson and seven other members of the Chicago White Sox were banned from the league in 1921 for their role in throwing the 1919 World Series. Rose was banned in 1989 after an investigation determined that he bet on games while managing the Cincinnati Reds.\nRose claimed until his death last year that he never bet on the Reds games while he was a player. Jackson, who couldn't read and write, claimed he didn't understand what his teammates were doing.\nRose is MLB's all-time leader in hits (4256), games played, at-bats, singles and outs. He won the World Series three times in his career, twice with the Reds and once with the Philadelphia Phillies.\nJackson held a career batting average of .356, which is the fourth highest in MLB history. Although he admittedly accepted money from gamblers in the 1919 World Series, his actions were not one of a man throwing a game. Shoeless Joe batted .375 in the series, didn't make a single error and hit the only White Sox home run. He was considered for Hall of Fame entry for decades by voters but did not make it in. Rose, because of the \"Pete Rose rule,\" was never on the ballot.\nBoth Charlie Hustle and Shoeless Joe had spectacular careers and based on their on the field accomplishments only, should be considered for the MLB HOF. That could happen as soon as 2028 but it is not a guarantee. Manfred's announcement has already sparked considerable controversy among baseball purist, many of whom, ironically, bet on baseball.\nProfessional sports and gambling intertwine in today's game. Sports betting is a legal activity, further integrating it into brand and culture. ESPN and other TV networks are investing in it.\nFormer Bama star Calvin Ridley bet on NFL games, to include his Falcons team, and still returned to play football.\nNote on their plaque the reason they were not selected until after death. That is fair. But it would be a shame to hold Rose and Jackson to a standard that no longer exists.\n(Opinions expressed in Morning Observations are those of the author and are not necessarily those of the ownership, management, staff or sponsors of Townsquare Media Tuscaloosa.)\nClick TuscaloosaThread.com for the latest West Alabama news, sports and weather throughout that day.
