The female athletes just get on with it, they definitely do not roll around and grimace as if both their legs are broken with an innocuous tackle to try and milk a free kick. Also, there is much less push and shove, in-your-face stuff. Most women's games they play hard, fairly and get on with the sport and not try and win an Oscar.\nOverall, there is true sportsmanship at the end of a tight contest. During this World Cup, there are a lot of the victors consoling the defeated. I find this is not matched in the men's game. Sportsmanship!\nThe support for this women's World Cup, for all teams, shows that a large number of people in Australia believe that female football at national level is worth supporting and paying for given the high ticket sales.\nThe standard of women's football at the national level is as good as the men's, plus I think it is actually more enjoyable to watch with much less theatrics and broken play.\nFemale football players at international games deserve the same pay as men without question.\nChristopher Marley\nReading this on mobile web?
