Childhood experiences become less distinct, emotional memories fade in strength, and many details are forgotten. In rare cases, however, some individuals can recall specific names, dates, and events with unusual accuracy and emotional detail. This rare ability, known as hyperthymesia or autobiographical hypermnesia, enables individuals to recall a large number of life events in exceptional detail. A new case study from the Paris Brain Institute highlights the complexity of this condition. A Different Kind... -\nThousands attend funeral of Houthi leaders killed by Israeli strike, vow revenge\nThousands of mourners attended a funeral at the largest mosque in Yemen's capital Sanaa on Monday for 12 senior Houthi figures, including their prime minister, who were killed by an Israeli strike.
