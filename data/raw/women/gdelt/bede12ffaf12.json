This is the 46th Hall of Fame class, and the group will be formally inducted on Friday, Oct. 18 at 7 p.m. in the Terrace Room in the Elaine Langone Center on campus, as part of Homecoming Weekend festivities.\nThe Bucknell Athletics Hall of Fame Class of 2024:\nBelow is more information on each member of the Hall of Fame Class of 2024.\nLUKE ROHRBAUGH '71 came to Bucknell from Hanover, Pa., and developed into a dominant offensive lineman. After suiting up on the freshman team in 1967, he started every game for the next three years and earned All-Middle-Atlantic Conference and First Team Associated Press All-State honors in 1969. He was a Third Team All-State selection in 1970, and following that season, Rohrbaugh was chosen to play on the East team at the inaugural Pennsylvania Dutch Bowl in Lancaster. He also received the George Rieu Award as the Team's top lineman in 1970.\nRohrbaugh, who also competed in the shot put and discus on the Bison track and field team, was a pro prospect on the gridiron. He was invited to training camp by the Baltimore Colts after graduating in 1971, and he was one of the team's final cuts. Rohrbaugh was in Colts camp with three other Bucknell alums and future Hall-of-Famers: players Tom Mitchell '66 and former teammate Sam Havrilak '69, and offensive line coach George Young '52.\nRohrbaugh went on to launch a successful career in personal finance, and his son Carson Rohrbaugh '12 was a four-year letterman on the Bucknell football team, following in his father's footsteps as an offensive lineman.\nTED PETERSON '76 was a three-year starting goalkeeper on some of Bucknell's finest men's soccer teams from 1973-75. The Bison went 31-7-5 in those three seasons and made NCAA Tournament appearances in 1974 and 1975. Two of the seven losses in that span came in overtime in NCAA Tournament matches.\nThe 1974 side, coached by Hall-of-Famer Craig Reynolds, is considered one of Bucknell's most successful teams in any sport. That squad was undefeated after beating La Salle in the East Coast Conference championship match, and then the Bison knocked off unbeaten Penn State 1-0 on its home field in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. A second-round double-overtime loss to Philadelphia Textile left the Bison at 12-1-2 with only five goals against on the season. The team set school records with 10 shutouts and 0.33 goals allowed per game, and the Bison were ranked No. 14 in the final Intercollegiate Soccer Association of America national poll.\nThe 1975 squad went back to the NCAA Tournament but fell in penalty kicks (7-6) to Fairleigh Dickinson in the first round. Peterson and the Bison defense kept the Knights off the board for 150 minutes of play, including four overtime periods, in a match that took place over two days and was the longest in NCAA history at the time. That team finished 10-3-2 with 10 shutouts. Peterson, a Silver Spring, Md., native, joins fullback Gary Toubman '76 and the high-scoring brother tandem Bruce '75 and Scott Strasburg '77 from that era in the Hall of Fame.\nPeterson's .943 save percentage in 1974 is still the Bucknell record, and he graduated with school marks for career shutouts (24) and saves (220). One year after graduation, Peterson and former teammate George Collins '77 founded a custom residential home construction company, and today Peterson and Collins, Inc., is an award-winning firm located in the Washington, D.C., area.\nGARRIN KAPECKI '89 is one of the finest water polo players in Bucknell history, and he earned Honorable Mention All-America honors following his junior and senior seasons. He was a three-time All-Mid-Atlantic Conference selection, claiming Second Team honors as a sophomore and First Team citations as a junior and senior, and in 1987 he was selected as the league's Most Valuable Player.\nKapecki was selected to the All-Eastern Championship team in all four of his collegiate seasons, including First Team honors in his final three appearances. He helped lead the Bison to a league championship and an NCAA Tournament appearance in 1985, and he captained the team in 1987 and 1988. Kapecki was the second-leading scorer as a freshman on the 1985 championship team with 67 goals and 27 assists. It was his tally with 32 seconds remaining that gave Bucknell a dramatic 11-10 win over Navy in the Mid-Atlantic Conference championship game. The Bison went on to reach the finals in the Eastern Championships, which qualified them for the NCAA Tournament. They defeated Loyola Chicago in the seventh-place game at NCAAs to finish 25-9 with a final national ranking of 11.\nKapecki's best individual season came as a junior in 1987, when he piled up 110 goals and 63 assists for 173 points en route to league MVP and Honorable Mention All-America honors. He played through a knee injury in his final season in 1988 but still finished with 64 goals and 16 assists while repeating as an Honorable Mention All-American.\nKapecki graduated ranked third on Bucknell's all-time goals (316) and points (443) lists. He played on four straight winning teams that combined for a 67-41 mark under Hall of Fame head coaches Dick Russell and Lynn Comer Kachmarik.\nFollowing his senior season, he was selected to play for the United States National \"B\" Team. He represented his country at the Mexico City Olympic Festival before being sidelined with the knee injury, and he also played in three more United States Olympic Festivals in 1989, 1991, and 1993. Kapecki was inducted into the Collegiate Water Polo Association Hall of Fame in 2019.\nA native of Northbrook, Ill., Kapecki went on to a successful business career while continuing to play water polo as a member of the New York Athletic Club. He helped that team win four national championships, and he remained connected to the sport through numerous volunteer and administrative roles at the local and national levels, including chairman of Illinois Water Polo in the early 2000s. He also served as a color analyst for the Big Ten Network's coverage of water polo for over 15 years.\nAMY MANTUSH FILANOWSKI '10 was one of the most prolific and versatile athletes in the history of the Bison women's track and field program. She won seven individual gold medals and four silver medals at Patriot League Championships, she was a two-time Patriot League Field Athlete of the Meet, and as one of the league's top point-producers, she helped the Bison claim six team championships and two runner-up finishes in her career.\nMantush Filanowski won Patriot League outdoor titles in the high jump in 2007, the high jump and triple jump in 2009, and the long jump in 2010. She added indoor gold medals in the high jump in 2007, setting the Patriot League record in the process, and both the high jump and pentathlon in 2010. She was named the Patriot League Field Athlete of the Meet following the 2009 Outdoor Championships and the 2010 Indoor Championships.\nMantush Filanowski's top indoor high jump of 5'8\" during her freshman year broke a 21-year-old school record and held up all the way to 2024 when it was broken by Karen Hull. Mantush Filanowski's school-record 5'7\" outdoor high jump held up for 12 years. She graduated No. 2 all-time in the outdoor triple jump (39'1\"), behind only Hall-of-Famer Jill Wise, and she also graduated ranked fifth all-time in the heptathlon and second in the pentathlon.\nA two-year team captain and a member of the Patriot League 25th Anniversary Team, she has remained in collegiate track and field as a coach. After stints at Allegheny and Misericordia, she returned to her alma mater for a three-year term as assistant coach under Kevin Donner from 2015-18. She later moved on to Kutztown (2018-22) and recently wrapped up her second year as an assistant at Muhlenberg. Following the retirement of longtime head coach Brad Hackett at the conclusion of the 2023-24 season, Mantush Filanowski has been named as his successor.\nThis will not be Mantush Filanowski's first Hall of Fame nod, as she was named to the Luzerne County Sports Hall of Fame in 2022 and the Hazleton Area Sports Hall of Fame in 2016.\nAUSTIN WINTER '10 became the first player in Bucknell men's lacrosse history to earn three Honorable Mention All-America citations. The high-scoring attackman was only the second four-time First Team All-Patriot League selection in league history, he was the 2007 PL Rookie of the Year, and he was twice named to the watch list for the Tewaaraton Award, which is given to the sport's national player of the year.\nA native of Mountain Lakes, N.J., Winter logged 77 goals and 117 assists for 194 points in his career. At the time of his graduation, he ranked third in team history in career assists and fourth in total points. He also ranked in the top six in Patriot League history in assists and points. A model of consistency, Winter recorded at least one point in all but one game over his four years, and as a sophomore he ranked second in the nation with 33 assists.\nIn Winter's four years at Bucknell, the Bison posted a 38-22 record – making that group the winningest class in team history at the time -- including a 17-7 mark in Patriot League play.
