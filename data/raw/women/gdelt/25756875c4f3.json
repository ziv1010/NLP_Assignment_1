The package includes a concourse meal deal (hot food, drink, and snack) and the official matchday programme. Guests also receive a 10 per cent Megastore discount and non-matchday Museum entry, providing a great value, family-friendly match experience for home fans.\nMarc Skinner had high hopes for Geyse as he brought her in to reinforce United's frontline after losing England striker Alessia Russo to Arsenal.\nHer first season saw her make 21 appearances and be a part of the history-making FA Cup-winning side in 2024.\nHer second season saw her play nine games, starting just six. Following the tragic death of her brother in a car accident, she returned home to Brazil on compassionate leave last January.\nWhile attending her brother’s funeral, it was reported that United were accused by Geyse’s agent of trying to loan her out to clubs.\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nReturning to the side in March, she played against Leicester City but spoke out about being ‘lonely’ in a statement on her social media.\nGeyse wrote: \"Staying in a place where we don't feel happy is an agonising and lonely feeling. Every day seems heavier, and the simple fact of being there becomes a burden.\n\"The environment, which should be welcoming, becomes a field of discomfort, where inner peace is difficult to find. When we are not in tune with what surrounds us, the world around us loses its colour and energy.\n\"Sometimes, the desire for change arises as an urgent need, but the fear of the unknown or insecurity about the future can paralyse us. However, it is essential to remember that we deserve to be in places and situations that bring us happiness and fulfilment. That's the only way we can grow.\"\nFollowing the post, Manchester United and Skinner said they were supporting Geyse in her wellbeing and were continuing to look for options which suit all parties.\nGeyse did not play again for United and instead went on loan to New York side Gotham FC in March 2025, with the head of women’s football Matt Johnson stating at the time: “The loan deal is important to Geyse as we continue to have her wellbeing at the centre of our decision-making.”\nWith no clear resolution emerging at United, Geyse's time in Manchester officially ended with a permanent move to Club America in Mexico on 13 January.\nAyisha Gulati is the women's football writer at FourFourTwo.
