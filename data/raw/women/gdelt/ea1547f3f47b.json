  "body_text": "Leah Williamson commended our team's performance as we coasted to an excellent win over Reading on Sunday night.\nMomentarily stepping away from her familiar role as a centre-back, Williamson spent the game in midfield and delivered a Player of the Match-worthy display.\n\"I actually loved that!\" she said after the final whistle. \"Sometimes it's just nice to enjoy football and when the team plays that well, how can you not?\"\nAfter a disallowed goal against Liverpool in midweek, the Lionesses captain was pleased to get on the scoresheet officially this time. Williamson happened to score her last WSL goal against Reading in March 2022 - a game that coincidentally also ended 4-0 to the Gunners.\n\"I should have had three, I think! I should have had a hat trick, so we'll take it but I'm sure that will be the feedback.\"\nSunday evening's win marked our third in a row and there is a steadily growing chemistry on the pitch to reflect the unity that has always been there behind the scenes.\n\"You know us as a team: we're the tightest. One of the tightest I've ever played in but sometimes you just need to click out there and I think you're seeing that at the minute. It's not a tangible thing, it's just something that you feel.\n\"Everyone's just super focused and the energy, that high - when you're like that, you have to just take advantage of it.\"\nA short break now beckons for our squad before crunch time in the Champions League: a quarter-final first leg away to Bayern Munich.\n\"I think firstly, enjoy the break. We've got a week of just training and putting in hard work. But I think the ruthlessness that you're seeing that's what Arsenal should be, whilst also being as tight as we are.\n\"Hopefully, that's what you'll see on Tuesday.\"\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
