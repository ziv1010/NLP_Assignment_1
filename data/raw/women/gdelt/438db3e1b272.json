Nominations are submitted to the Cabinet Office’s Honours and Appointments Secretariat, which oversees the honours system.\nHere are some of the UK community heroes, charity champions and campaigners that have been recognised this year.\nCalum's Cabin founders Jenna, Caroline and Duncan Speirs\nJenna Speirs and her parents Caroline and Duncan Speirs have been awarded a British Empire Medal (BEM) for their work with the cancer charity Jenna co-founded after her twin brother died of the illness, aged 12.\nThe trio, from the Isle of Bute, started the charity Calum’s Cabin following the death of Calum, who had an inoperable brain tumour, in 2007.\nDuring his time in hospital, Calum told his sister Jenna, now 30, he wanted to start something called “Calum’s Caravan” for children with cancer to spend time away with their families. “It was his idea. He wanted people to be able to take time away,” she said.\nThe Speirs family, who had initially planned to start the charity when Calum recovered from his illness, started fundraising at his funeral. Two years later, Calum’s Cabin had acquired its first holiday home for families of children being treated for cancer in Scotland to use.\nSince then, thousands of families have been helped by the charity, which now has several holiday homes as well as flats in Glasgow for hospital patients and their families to stay in if they live further afield.\nIt is the first time three family members have been named in the same honours list, and Jenna said the King being open about his own cancer diagnosis “has been really good for men”.\nOn being named in the King’s Birthday Honours, Jenna, a therapeutic radiographer, said Charles sharing his cancer diagnosis has helped men open up.\nJenna said: “Him being so open about his cancer journey has been really good for men in particular. You see a lot of men sitting alone in the waiting rooms, but now they are chatting more.”\nSouthport knife attack medical responders\nMedical staff on scene at the tragic knife attack at a Taylor Swift dance class in Southport, which left three children dead, have been recognised for their brave role in responding to the tragedy.\nPaul Smith, a senior paramedic team leader, treated victims at the scene where Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, were murdered and 10 others injured last July.\nMr Smith, who works for the North West Ambulance Service, was awarded a British Empire Medal (BEM) for his services to the community in Merseyside after “he put the needs of the injured before his own safety”, the NHS said.\nDr George Bramham, who was also a first responder, received the same honour.\nMartin Johnson and Elizabeth Parsons, who were part of the surgical team in theatre who treated people sent to Southport Hospital after the stabbings, have been given the same medals.\nSir Jim Mackey, NHS chief executive, praised the staff for their “incredible dedication\"”.\n\"I want to give my heartfelt congratulations to all the people working in the NHS that have received honours, who work tirelessly everyday to care for their patients,\" Sir Jim said.\n\"I’d also like to recognise those staff who were involved in the response to the knife attack in Southport last summer. These awards rightly honour their incredible dedication and commitment in an awful situation.\n\"The NHS is made up of highly committed and dedicated people that work hard to give the best possible care to patients, and these honours recognise their skill, compassion and bravery.\"\nCarmela Chillery-Watson, 11, who has\nCarmela, an 11-year-old girl, is the youngest person ever to be made an MBE and said she “never thought anything like this would happen”.\nCarmela Chillery-Watson, from Dorset, has LMNA congenital muscular dystrophy – a progressive muscle-wasting condition which affects her movement, heart and lungs – and is becoming a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the King’s Birthday Honours for services to charitable fundraising.\nShe was diagnosed with the condition in 2017, aged three, and in recent years has helped charity Muscular Dystrophy UK raise more than £400,000 by doing around 25 fundraising and awareness campaigns.\n“I’m just really ecstatic and surprised that I’m receiving the honour,” Carmela told the PA news agency. “It’s incredible.”\nThe 11-year-old campaigner has undertaken a variety of challenges, including her Wonder Woman Walk where she walked one kilometre a day and then went another nine kilometres a day in her wheelchair for a month in 2020.\nDressed as her favourite superhero Wonder Woman, Carmela travelled across 30 different places in Cornwall, Somerset, Wiltshire and Surrey to complete the 300-kilometre trek.\nShe has also carried out a 100-mile walking challenge across the Jurassic Coast in Dorset.\n“I have to say, I love all of them,” Carmela said of her various fundraising campaigns. “They are all so fun.”\nPam Duncan-Glancy, MSP and disability campaigner\nLabour MSP Pam Duncan-Glancy, a tireless disability campaigner, has been made an MBE for political and public service.\nShe has been MSP for the Glasgow region for four years and is the first permanent wheelchair user elected to the Scottish Parliament.\nShe said: “I’m really, really proud to have been given this honour for the work that I’ve done in the community and for disability rights.\n“It’s a real honour to do this. When I got elected as an MSP, I said I was a wee working class woman in a wheelchair. To think that I could be a wee working class woman in a wheelchair who’s also got an MBE, I just thought that was pretty special.”\nElected in May 2021, Ms Duncan-Glancy has impressed in her first term as an MSP, being given a spot on the Scottish Labour frontbench before even making it to Holyrood, when she was appointed social security spokeswoman by leader Anas Sarwar in the early weeks of his tenure.\nBefore entering politics, she worked in communications for the NHS and campaigned for the rights of disabled people.\nParents of aid worker killed in Afghanistan\nA couple who set up a charity in memory of their daughter who was killed in Afghanistan have been recognised with an OBE.\nJohn and Lorna Norgrove set up the Linda Norgrove Foundation in memory of their daughter Linda, an aid worker who was kidnapped by the Taliban and died in an attempted rescue by US forces in October 2010.\nThe foundation funds education, health and childcare for women and children in Afghanistan.\nIt has worked with both the Scottish and UK governments to bring 19 female Afghan medical students to Scotland to train to continue their degrees as they were barred by the Taliban from completing their university studies in Afghanistan.\nThe couple said the charity was set up to help Afghan women and children in their own country and they now plan to focus on that rather than bringing more of them to the UK.\nThe couple said: “We are honoured to have received this recognition of the work being carried out by the Linda Norgrove Foundation. We are a tiny charity, mostly volunteers, who all share the same goal – to make life better for women and children in Afghanistan.\"\nThey hope the honour will raise awareness about the work the foundation is doing in Afghanistan, where girls and women are living under severe restrictions imposed by the Taliban.\nThey added: “We dedicate this honour to all those brave women who remain in Afghanistan, or who have made the decision to leave their homes and families behind to move abroad and continue their studies and careers. Their struggle continues and they are the real heroes of this story.”\nThe 'Hillwalking Hijabi'\nA social media influencer known as the Hillwalking Hijabi has been recognised for championing diversity in outdoor activities. Zahrah Mahmood, 34, is made an MBE for her contribution to voluntary service in Scotland.\nShe has dedicated herself to championing diversity and inclusion within the outdoor community, and she received the royal honour for “exemplifying the spirit of innovation and commitment to social change”.\nThe Glaswegian, who posts as @the_hillwalking_hijabi on Instagram, uses the online platform to share her own activities and practical advice for beginners, and her appointment as president of Ramblers Scotland has been described as a “testament to her leadership and vision”.\nThe mother-of-two, who also works as a chartered accountant, was introduced to hillwalking by friends who were supporting her through a difficult time.\nShe said there are still \"barriers to access\" within diverse communities, including among new mothers and low-income families.\nMrs Mahmood said of becoming an MBE: \"If I’m being honest I’m still taking it in. I’m grateful, and I hope I can continue using whatever platform this brings to keep doing the work which matters to me and so many others.\"\nShe said she never intended to become an influencer, but believes \"visibility\" is a first step towards inclusion.\nMrs Mahmood said: \"If this recognition helps a little to show that the outdoors is for everyone, that would mean the world to me. But I’m also aware that visibility is often the first step. I would love to play a small part in continuing to move things in the right direction.\"\nDefibrillator f\nA father whose 12-year-old son died following a cardiac arrest has been made an OBE after setting up a foundation which has saved more than 80 lives by providing defibrillators.\nMark King’s son Oliver suffered a cardiac arrest during a swimming lesson at school in Liverpool in 2011 and died from sudden arrhythmic death syndrome.\nThe Oliver King Foundation has since given out 7,000 defibrillators, and Mr King’s campaigning led to the Government ensuring every state school in England has access to one of the life-saving machines.\nHe said: “Our Ollie was only with us for 12 years but he never let us down once and this is us not letting his name down.”\nMr King, 63, said when he first found out he was to be included in the King’s Birthday Honours he thought the letter had gone to the wrong address. He said: “I’m not one for awards, I just want to march on. I’m just a dad, that’s it, I’m a dad. But, for an OBE to come through – I was cartwheeling in the garden!”\nHe said Oliver was “very sporty”, “always had a football under his arm” and was about to sign for Everton, but unknown to the family he had a genetic condition passed down from his father which led to his cardiac arrest.\nMr King is working to set up a centre to provide testing for all children to see if they have the gene.\nSince the foundation was set up in 2012, Mr King has personally delivered all the defibrillators to schools, businesses and sporting venues as far north as Stornoway and as far south as Portsmouth.\nHe said 84 lives had been saved with the defibrillators, including a child as young as four.\nCharlotte Charles, mum of tragic teen biker\nThe mother of a teenage motorcyclist, killed by a US citizen who was able to leave the UK under diplomatic immunity laws, has been made an MBE.\nCharlotte Charles said she feels “undeserving” of her award because she was “a mum who was just totally broken”.\nThe mother of 19-year-old Harry Dunn said her work on road safety following the crash that resulted in her son’s death in 2019 was an “avenue to direct my grief down”.\nHarry was killed when a Volvo driven by then-US state department employee Anne Sacoolas hit him while on the wrong side of the road outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity asserted on her behalf following the crash and she was able to leave the country 19 days later.\nMrs Charles, alongside Harry’s father Tim Dunn, campaigned for justice for three years – which included a meeting with US President Donald Trump at the White House.\nMrs Charles, 50, said: \"I just always wanted to make sure his death led to change, and if it means that a few more lives are saved, and victims of a serious crime are treated a little bit better, and that the roads in and around our bases in the UK are safer, then I’m thrilled to accept the award on behalf of him.\"\nShe continued: \"I think when I received the letter I just felt almost a little bit undeserving – because you don’t forget all of the achievements that you’ve worked so, so very hard to secure. But at the end of the day I just view myself as a mum who was just totally broken. I didn’t know any other way of coping apart from focusing on as many positive things as I possibly could.\"\nMrs Charles, and the rest of the Dunn family, are expecting a parliamentary inquiry to be announced soon before the sixth anniversary of Harry’s death in August.\nDaughter of MP killed in Brighton bombing\nThe daughter of an MP murdered in the Brighton bombing 40 years ago has spoken of her pride at being made a CBE.\nJo Berry, 67, has dedicated her life to peace and reconciliation since her father Sir Anthony Berry, the former Conservative MP for Enfield Southgate, died.\nThe bombing on October 12 1984 tore apart the Brighton Grand Hotel, where then-prime minister Margaret Thatcher and members of her cabinet were staying while the Conservative Party conference took place. Five people, including Sir Anthony, were killed in the explosion and another 34 were injured.\nThe bomber, IRA member Patrick Magee, was handed eight life sentences at the Old Bailey in 1986, with a recommendation he serve a minimum of 35 years. He was released in 1999 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.\nTwo days after the bombing, Ms Berry, who was 27 at the time, embraced peace rather than hatred and as part of her work she met Magee in 2000. Since then they have appeared together at events hundreds of times.\nIn 2009 she set up the Building Bridges for Peace charity and has now been honoured for her lifetime’s work.\n\"When I read the letter I was in shock, such a surprise. I’m deeply honoured to receive this award,\" Ms Berry, from Frome in Somerset, said. \"It was not something that ever occurred to me it would happen. For me it’s about everyone who’s supported me on my journey to help me achieve what I’ve achieved. I also see it as for everyone who’s chosen empathy over hatred.\"\nMs Berry said she was looking forward to her investiture and hoped to take her three daughters with her. “They are my rock and without them I couldn’t have done what I’ve done,” she said.",
