  "body_text": "Khadija Shaw is made for the big stage. She has presence, a big personality and an infectious, radiating smile. The Jamaica international is Manchester City Women’s record goalscorer, her strike in the Manchester derby in March having taken her tally to 68 in 82 appearances, surpassing Georgia Stanway (67 in 186 appearances).\nAdvertisement\nCity signed Shaw from French Division 1 side Bordeaux in 2021 for her goalscoring prowess. She was the league’s top scorer with 22 goals in 20 games in her final season there and she is replicating that form in England, leading the Women’s Super League golden boot race.\nNicknamed ‘Bunny’ by older brother Kentardo because of her love of carrots, Shaw lights up a room as soon as she walks in. As the 6ft Jamaica international enters Manchester City’s indoor football arena, braids hanging down her back, there is a spring in her step. She takes a seat, ready to analyse some of her City goals.\nWe start with a crucial one against rivals Chelsea, which ended the reigning champions’ run of 33 unbeaten league matches at home.\n“From the beginning of the season, one of our things was pressing out of possession,” says Shaw. “When we press the way we know we can press, not only do we win possession, but we’re higher up to score. Me and Jess (Park) have been working on pressing and communicating. This scenario already happened in training.” Park dispossesses the usually reliable Erin Cuthbert in Chelsea’s half.\n“That was all Jess,” says Shaw. “When she picked the ball up, I was just thinking: ‘Drive, drive, drive, drive.’” Park plays, in Shaw’s words, a “perfect pass” and literally ‘feeds the Bun’, a chant sung by the City fans.\n“Then I waited for the keeper to come. I just lobbed it over in the corner.” Shaw opts to shoot with the outside of her right foot. “Carter was already on my left,” she explains. “So if I put my left foot back, maybe my leg would have touched her and it would have thrown me off. The keeper was going to close the angle. If I used my left foot, I would have to put it extra wide and I didn’t want to miss the goal.”\nShaw runs towards the stands, cupping her hand to her ear and stands bolt upright in front of the Chelsea fans. It was Shaw’s first league goal against Chelsea and brought City level with their title rivals at the top of the WSL. “I love the big games,” says Shaw. “The hype, the atmosphere, the build-up, everything in these games just gets me pumped and ready to go.”\nIt is not the first time she has silenced rival crowds in big games. In front of 43,615 fans at Old Trafford in November, Shaw dealt the killer blow in a 3-1 win over Manchester United. Once again, pressing was key.\n“How satisfying was this one?” asks The Athletic. “Very,” replies Shaw. “I’ll walk you through it.” Shaw tucks her chair in and takes full control of the laptop.\nMary Earps plays the ball to Maya Le Tissier…\nEarps’ clearance rebounds off Shaw into the back of the net. “What did you think when that went in?” asks The Athletic. “I was watching it too, you know!” says Shaw. “I was like, ‘YESSS!!!”. While Shaw wheels away, teasingly nodding her head to the United fans, the camera pans to Earps, who mouths: “What the f***?”\n“We warmed up in that corner and the fans were giving us pure stick,” says Shaw. “Chloe (Kelly) said: ‘I love this!’ So when I scored I went over there and I was like, ‘OK, what are you gonna say now?’”\nShaw then pulls out some dance moves, celebrating with Kelly, a routine inspired by Nigerian singer David Adeleke, better known as Davido, who performed at the Professional Footballers’ Association awards a couple of months earlier. “I practicsed it,” explains Shaw. “I asked Chloe how I looked and she said I looked great. On matchday she said if either one of us score, we’re going to perform it. I completely forgot, she came, she reminded me, started doing it. Bam! Viral. I think it got over a million views.”\n@barclayswsl 🥵 CHLOE KELLY 🥵 #barclayswsl #bwsl #chloekelly #mancitywomen ♬ Vois Sur Ton Chemin – D$8 & DKSH & SLAP HOUSE MAFIA\nThe striker’s family, who live in Manchester, were not in the crowd that day as they had given their tickets to Shaw’s friends who had flown in especially from Jamaica. Shaw, who is very proud of her Jamaican roots, has a fellow lover of Jamaican culture in the City squad.\n“I tell everyone Chloe (Kelly) is 60 per cent Jamaican,” she says. “I truly believe it.” When Shaw first met the England international in the summer of 2021, Kelly suggested going to a Jamaican restaurant together in Manchester. “We were driving in the car and Chloe started playing Jamaican music,” says Shaw. “We got to the restaurant and I thought ‘let me see what you’re going to order’. She wanted plantains and everything. I was like, ‘Oh my God, wow, it’s crazy!’. I get along really well with Chloe, she’s class off the field.”\n“Yes, G!” Shaw shouts as her team-mate Alex Greenwood walks past. “Make that pass,” says Greenwood, smiling. “Make that pass, G!” replies Shaw. Shaw’s eyes return to the screen.\n“I’m not even looking at the ball,” she says. “I always look at the player. I invite that pass. It’s like playing a game. As soon as the goalkeeper puts her head down, I go.” (Shaw claps her hands). With a half turn, she changes her body shape.\nManager Gareth Taylor has spoken to Shaw about aggression off the ball. “I’m a naturally aggressive player, not that I want to be but because of my physicality,” she says. “He just told me to embrace it. In training I work on it with the girls sometimes.”\nAt times, however, Shaw gets frustrated when she is penalised for fouls which in her eyes are not offences. Her red card in the Women’s World Cup against France last summer after a second yellow card springs to mind.\n“Because I’m naturally physical, it comes off as a foul,” she adds. “If it were another player, it probably wouldn’t be.”\nFocusing purely on Shaw’s physique would be to do her technical qualities an injustice. Before the next clip plays, The Athletic asks if she remembers this goal. Shaw looks at the still image of the build-up.\n“Long ball from Leila (Ouahabi),” she replies without a moment’s hesitation. “I assisted a similar almost pitch-perfect ball like this to Julie (Blakstad) last season.”\nShaw gets in between the two Everton centre-backs and allows the long ball to bounce. “Once it bounces, I see the goalkeeper in my vision. I don’t know why she is coming. If I control the ball, it would have been difficult because there’s three defenders and the goalkeeper.”\n“I try to spend more time on my hips and adductors so that I’m able to make certain movements and when I get on the field it’s not really uncomfortable. I saw it was working on the field and I just stuck at it. Here we are,” she smiles, casually.\nShaw, who loves the gym, demands a lot from herself physically and mentally. “I get very hard on myself in training,” she says. “You hear me scream and yell. Sometimes you think I’m going crazy but that’s just how I am as a person. I want to try to do the best that I can to help the team.”\nA minute before scoring this audacious chip, Shaw had missed a penalty. Taylor has highlighted her mental resilience, comparing her to another prolific City striker, Erling Haaland. “These players are just so supremely, mentally strong, that they’re able to just go again and know that they’re going to get opportunities,” Taylor said a year ago.\nShaw says the team gives her the confidence to keep trying. “The players trust me enough to give me the ball to score,” she says. “I might miss two or three. Sometimes I get on at myself. I say: ‘Focus on the next one, (Shaw claps her hands), you better make sure you put this on target. I can’t dwell on the past. I have to focus on the future.”\nWe get ready to move on. Once again, Shaw is one step ahead, just like she is on the pitch. “I wonder if this was the free-kick against Everton…” she says. It is. Alex Greenwood stands over the ball. “Pause a second,” Shaw instructs The Athletic. She wants to provide some context.\n“I have a very good relationship with Alex (Greenwood). Just before she took the free kick, she was telling me, ‘Come across!’. I was like: ‘Shut up and just let me be, just put the ball (in). I promise I’m gonna get there.’\n“We drive each other. We hold each other to very high standards. If you hear us, you think we hate each other. That’s just how we hold each other accountable in games. I know where she’s going to put the ball, she knows where I’m going to be. I like to create a block so that I’m able to get free, she crosses the ball and I score. Alex was like: “OK, OK, I hear you, I hear you, it’s all you.”\nScoring an acrobatic diving header to round off a hat-trick is as simple as that for Shaw but it’s not quite that straightforward. Can she elaborate on how she “creates a block” and times her run? Shaw leans closer to the screen to explain. “You see three players here,” she points. “You see where Leila is. I’m going to run in front of Leila. This person is trying to block me. This person is marking Leila. I don’t know what this one is doing.\n“Sometimes heading comes with confidence,” Shaw says. Now, she finds it easy. “Especially with my height. That’s why I always tell them to put the ball in the air. One, I’m more physical. Two, I have height. When I jump, surely I should be even taller.”\nWith that combination, Shaw is, at times, unstoppable in the air, as shown against Tottenham Hotspur when her header sailed past compatriot Becky Spencer.\n“That’s just straight power,” she says. “When the ball is whipped in from a wide area, it’s just about getting the power. Once that ball is in the air, I give myself some time to get a run onto it. The ball is straight at the keeper but because I am coming in so hard and I put so much power in, it’s difficult for her to save. The header isn’t even to one of the corners.”\nShaw agrees her hold-up play since joining City has vastly improved.\n“My hold-up play comes in two different situations,” she says. “When a player is touch-tight to me, that’s the best feeling because I can easily roll them. Once I feel you, it’s game over. That makes me happy. What I find now is that sometimes they give me space.\n“As the ball is coming in, I check to see if I have space. If I do, I take the extra touch to then try to find my No 8 or No 10. If they come tight, I just roll them and play. I try to put my body in between the person and the ball. Once I’m in between, there’s no way on earth you’re going to get the ball.”\n“This is what I’m saying!” she says as the next clip plays right on cue. “When you’re touch-tight, I can roll you.”\nKerstin Casparij cuts the ball back to Shaw, who is tightly marked by the Aston Villa defender….\nThere will surely be plenty more goals though.\n“The more I score, the more confident I become and so does the team,” she says. “They always say, ‘Bunny, you lead from the front’. I just have to keep going.”\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Eamonn Dalton)",
