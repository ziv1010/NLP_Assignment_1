  "body_text": "—The U of L baseball team will play its first midweek contest of the young season tonight when it hosts Xavier. Here’s a preview.\nWednesday afternoon Cardinal news and notes\nEmerson is cheering on basketball until her main man Jeff Brohm takes center stage in the fall.\n—Louisville is up one spot from No. 5 to No. 4 in the latest Baseball America top 25 poll.\n—The latest U of L women’s basketball Bracketology from ESPN has Louisville as a 7-seed taking on Washington State in the first round.\n—Brandon Marcello of 247 Sports writes that Cincinnati was one of the biggest losers of the most recent college football coaching carousel, and that Louisville was one of the biggest winners.\nLouisville\nLouisville fans didn’t have to pack Scott Satterfield’s bags, after all. Fans have been smothering Satterfield for his lack of big wins over the last two seasons and were openly wondering late in 2021 if he should be fired. One year later, they got their wish and it didn’t cost the school a dime. Satterfield instead left for Cincinnati and Louisville hired their favorite son, former Louisville quarterback Jeff Brohm.\nAsk even the most cynical Cardinals fan and they’ll tell you this is an upgrade – and at a darn good discount. Brohm isn’t just a Louisville man, he’s an incredibly successful coach.\nBrohm led Purdue to a Big Ten Championship appearance last season and also pushed the Boilermakers into four bowl games in six seasons, including the Citrus Bowl. Louisville fans watched him up close — and certainly wished loudly that he would step in as head coach — when he led Western Kentucky to a pair of Conference USA titles and had 22 combined wins in his final two seasons leading the Hilltoppers in 2015 and 2016.\nNo team in this hiring cycle received a better deal and a bigger upgrade, and also expertly play fan service, than Louisville.

Not acceptable,” Payne said after their loss to the Blue Devils. “We tried to explain to them what kind of environment this is. We have a coach on the staff, Nolan (Smith), who played here, coached here, went through everything that this program is and what it means to be here, and how they were gonna come out and play against us. Something didn’t click.\n“We as coaches, me personally, I’ll take the blame for that.
