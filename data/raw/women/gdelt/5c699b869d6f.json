This week we've got the cricketers seeing if they've still got it for a good cause, and the Raider returning to reality television.\nOne of women's soccer's most iconic Canberra clubs has put a desperate call-out for help.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nANU Women's Football Club controversially dropped out of the National Premier League last year after only four games due to injuries and limited playing numbers, ending its run in the top division competition since being promoted in 2023.\nThose ANUWFC players that were keen to play on were granted the ability to transfer to other NPLW clubs, which led to more member departures.\nBut as the club prepares to kick-off its 48th season, ANUWFC is facing another shortage, this time with volunteer coaches for its social soccer divisions.\nAs a club that prides itself on being very inclusive, particularly for those from the LGBTQI+ community, there is concern that without more volunteers in key areas, the sport's accessibility is put at risk.\n\"As Canberra's oldest and largest women's-only football club (inclusive of cis, trans women and non-binary people), we're passionate about creating a welcoming, safe and fun environment for people to play football at every level,\" the club told The Canberra Times.\n\"But without enough coaches, that access is at risk - especially for those who play for connection, fitness, and community rather than competition.\"\nANUWFC is not alone in its struggle for numbers, with other Canberra women's teams in rugby union and league experiencing similar players shortages in recent years.\nThough NPLW is still off cards for the upcoming season, ANUWFC aims to field two teams in every Capital League division from first to sixth, and they are most in need of coaches in divisions four to six.\nPre-season commences after Australia Day weekend and trials start on February 3.\nCricket for a cause\nEver swung so hard at a long hop that you've almost done a cartwheel, collapsed on your stumps and finished flat on your back?\nMaybe warming up by watching a series of highlights from Euro Cricket, Brett Lee and Damien Martyn wasn't quite enough. But then again, this wasn't just about cricket.\nJust when Canberra's streets were becoming a magnet for burnouts, a group of mates came together for a game of cricket dubbed the Canberra Cricket Classic.\nForget Summernats, this was Seamernats, where a group driven by Trent Pollard came together to raise $3120 for Menslink - a charity supporting young men - in a light-hearted cricket game at Dickson Oval on Saturday.\nPlayers came from Byron Bay, Newcastle and even Texas to play in stifling conditions. There were almost as many dropped catches as there were boundaries. And while the Portly Big Hitters prevailed over the Stoutly Slow Seamers, you can bet they'll do it all again next summer.\nWhile we're talking about cricketers playing for a cause, Cricket ACT will host its annual Donate for Jake round this week to spread awareness about the importance of donating blood and plasma.\nJake Floros was 16 years old when he starting feeling a pain he figured was a cramp. What he didn't know was a bacterial infection was eating away at his hip, and he would require emergency surgery.\nFloros - whose family name is synonymous with Tuggeranong cricket - suffered toxic shock syndrome, and required a series of blood and plasma transfusions.\nA hip replacement would spell the end of Floros' playing career, opening the door for a move into coaching which has allowed him to play a role in developing junior cricketers.\nRaider returns to reality TV\nYou might know Luke Bateman as the former Canberra Raiders forward. Maybe you know him from his appearance on The Bachelor. Maybe he's the farmer talking about fantasy novels you've seen on TikTok. You might remember him speaking about about the gambling addiction which cost him about $500,000.\nNow the ex-Raider is about to return to TV screens on the new series of I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here!\n\"In some very exciting news, I'll be trading the Australian outback for the African jungle,\" Bateman said in an Instagram video.\n\"I'll be going into the jungle representing my charity, Farm Angels, which is a charity very close to my heart. They do amazing work in my community.\n\"I'm very excited to see what Robert [Irwin] and Julia [Morris] have cooked up for me. I'm sure there'll be some delectable food items, and some fear-instilling trials. I can't wait.\"\nThe new season premieres on Sunday, and Bateman - who looks to follow Sam Thaiday's footsteps in winning the reality show - is sure to be compelling viewing.\nThe latter stages of Bateman's NRL career were hampered by a knee injury before he retired in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when player wages took a major cut to keep the game afloat.\nHe returned to a life on the farm in Queensland and soon made a shock comeback to the television screens of Raiders fans during a season of The Bachelor, then went viral on TikTok to land a book deal for a debut series of fantasy novels before opening up on his past struggles.\nA $1 million fever dream\nNick Kyrgios celebrated like he'd won the real Australian Open. Ashleigh Simes could only laugh when Andy Lee took a point off her to advance.\nThe Australian Open's 1-Point Slam felt like a fever dream. There was Canberra's Simes, then there was Carlos Alcaraz, Kyrgios, Jannik Sinner, Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff, Steve Waugh, Karl Stefanovic, Bailey Smith, Andy Lee and Dave Hughes. Oh, and a $1 million bounty.\nSimes calls the one-point slam concept \"terrifying\". The concept operates just as it sounds: win a point and move on. A game of \"rock, paper, scissors\" determines who serves. Whoever wins the point advances to the next round, with the winner of the final match claiming the $1 million prize.\nAnd just as organisers would have hoped, a community tennis player won the ultimate prize - and beat world No.2 Jannik Sinner along the way - with NSW qualifier Jordan Smith pocketing a cool million at Rod Laver Arena on Wednesday night.\nThe dream wasn't to be for Simes, who bowed out in the first round against Andy Lee after the comedian and media personality jokingly employed some psychological warfare by stalling, ditching jacket and asking for a number of balls before his serve.\nAs for Kyrgios? He won a point over Steve Yarwood and you would have thought he'd won the entire thing.\n\"This might be the biggest match of my career,\" Kyrgios grinned.\nKyrgios fell to Joanna Garland, the world No.117 who eventually lost in the final to Smith.\nThe physio to the stars\nTim McGrath has spent two years rebuilding NFL players at the Washington Commanders, and now the former Brumbies and Raiders physiotherapist is on his way back to Canberra.\nMcGrath will open his books at Elite Rehab and Sports Physiotherapy in Dickson, fresh off a two-year stint with an NFL franchise worth more than $11 billion.\nIt is the latest role on a resume which includes stints at the ACT Brumbies, Raiders, Cronulla Sharks, St George Illawarra, Port Adelaide and Australian rugby sevens.\nMcGrath is the brains behind \"Pitch Ready\", a program built on cutting-edge sports science described as \"the gold standard\" in injury reduction strategies and rehabilitation analysis.\nRaider signs new deal\nJordyn Preston rolled the dice on a deal with the Raiders, and now the back-rower has been handed a two-year contract which keeps her in Canberra until the end of 2027.\nPreston follows Emma Barnes in signing a new deal for a Raiders NRLW side she believes can \"win a premiership in the green jersey\", while Madyson Tooth has been elevated to the top squad after spending a year as a development player.\n\"It is very rewarding for Jordy, she came here on a one-year deal I guess to get out of her comfort zone. She was terrific for us, she filled a couple of positions earlier on in the season but she got better and better as the season went on and fully deserves her contract extension,\" Raiders coach Darrin Borthwick said.\n\"She's a well-liked member of the team, someone that I think relishes in the Canberra environment. I'm looking forward to having her back and hopefully continuing on the season that she had.\n\"She will certainly put a lot of pressure on the group and that's what we want ultimately, everyone putting a bit of pressure on each other positionally. That gets the best out of everyone.\"\nGoulburn junior Tooth has now been elevated to Canberra's top 24, leaving just two more spots in the squad for the 2026 season.\n\"Maddy was very unlucky last year not to get an opportunity to play NRLW. Whenever she went back to Mounties she performed really, really well. It was an easy decision in the end to elevate her into our top 24,\" Borthwick said.\nStar athletes bound for AIS\nOlympians, Commonwealth Games medallists and national record holders are among the headline acts bound for the ACT championships at the AIS next week.\nParis Olympian and Commonwealth Games bronze medallist Mia Gross is locked in for the highlight event on the ACT athletics calendar after a stellar 2025 campaign littered with personal best times.\nThe championships will also feature Catriona Bissett, a former Australian 800m record holder who has a world championship final and Commonwealth Games medal to her name.\nAlso among the top-shelf inclusions are 400m runner Jemma Pollard, rising sprint star Aidan Murphy, Paralympian Rhiannon Clarke and New Zealand 400m record-breaker Lev Revell-Lewis.\nGold medal for ACT\nThe ACT has claimed back-to-back men's national titles on their home deck at Hockey Australia's indoor championships.\nThe hosts finished the tournament undefeated, lifting the silverware at Lyneham's National Hockey Centre following a grand final victory over Western Australia.\nConnor Tuddenham was named player of the tournament while Aiden Dooley finished as the leading goal scorer.\nCanberra is poised to host five separate national championship events in 2026 in what Hockey ACT chief executive Rob Sheekey says will deliver a \"$3 million impact for the Canberra economy\".\nThe open-age, under 21 and under-18 indoor national championships are being played in Canberra from January 11-24. The under-21 outdoor titles follow from April 23-30, and the under-14 age group rounds out proceedings with its outdoor championships from October 4-10.\nHave your say\n- Have you heard something and want to get in touch?\n- caden.helmers@canberratimes.com.au",
