From U.S. elections to international crises to the latest chunky baby animal hitting the internet, this year had a lot to offer.\nTake our quiz and test your knowledge of the top stories of the year.\na.

There is no scientific research or evidence behind mewing to suggest it actually works.\nc. Starring in a 2000s YTV kids' show. Born in Chicago and raised in Oakville, Ont., Mr. Clark’s first success came while starring in the 2000-02 Canadian children's TV show The Zack Files, a YTV-created spoof of the Fox hit The X-Files. As Shane Dingman reported this year, Mr. Clark was the majority owner of a series of companies that went on a reckless buying spree that amassed more than 600 properties across Ontario.\nb. Through a Zoom call with Mr. Trudeau. Ms. Freeland, who was Canada’s first female federal finance minister, wrote in her resignation letter that she and the Prime Minister have been “at odds” over the past few weeks. Sources say Mr. Trudeau told his long-time colleague and deputy prime minister that she was going to be replaced, and offered her a different position in the cabinet, which she refused.\nc. Preordered his signature McDonald’s Christmas dinner. Mr. Trump hasn’t wasted any time ruffling feathers since becoming the second president to be elected to two non-consecutive terms.

In May, the U.S. Department of Justice said TD Bank was central to a criminal ring that laundered US$653-million worth of drug money through American financial institutions.

Montreal. They get good bagels and poutine, and now an eclipse? The rare celestial event hit Ontario and Quebec before curving off into the Atlantic provinces, and millions of Canadians gathered for a few minutes of total obscurity.\nc. 200,000. As Vanmala Subramaniam reported this year, 203,260 international students in Canada hold postgraduation work permits that will expire in the next 15 months. The decision by the Liberals to lower immigration rates comes barely a year before a federal election and amid a housing affordability crisis that many Canadians have linked to soaring population growth.\nb. Bouncing Pig. Born in July, Moo Deng has charmed people around the world with her antics, which include trying to nibble her handler, despite lacking teeth.\nb. Los Angeles, 1984.
