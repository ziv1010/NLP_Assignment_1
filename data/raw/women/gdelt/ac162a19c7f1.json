  "body_text": "The royal family’s ‘brutal’ 2024 as the Windsors faced major health challenges\nA double cancer diagnosis for the King and the Princess of Wales marked a difficult, challenging 2024 for the royal family.\nIt was, in the words of the Prince of Wales, a “brutal” time.\nKate shared heartfelt updates on her cancer journey, as both the princess and the monarch underwent treatment for the disease.\nCharles was back on public duties in the spring with the Queen often urging him to take it easy.\nThe princess has made a gradual return, while the King carried out a major long haul tour to Australia and hosted two state visits.\nKate’s festive annual carol concert was a highlight, but there was controversy as the year came to a close thanks to the Duke of York’s close links to an alleged Chinese spy.\n– January\nJanuary started badly for Andrew with hundreds of pages of court documents relating to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal unsealed in the US.\nAllegations the duke sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre when she was 17, which he denies, were given a fresh airing in the legal papers, amid growing pressure on the Metropolitan Police to investigate.\nThen the royal family was hit by a double health scare when Kate underwent abdominal surgery and it was announced on the same day that the King was to be treated in hospital for a benign, enlarged prostate.\nKate spent 13 nights in hospital and was expected to take the next three months to recuperate.\nCharles visited his daughter-in-law’s bedside as he was admitted to the same clinic for his procedure, and a three-night stay.\nWilliam stepped back from official duties to juggle caring for his children and his wife, and Kensington Palace said Kate’s operation was not-cancer related.\nJust days later, there was a further blow to the royal family when Sarah, Duchess of York was revealed to have skin cancer, with her malignant melanoma diagnosis coming less than a year after she had breast cancer.\n– February\nThe Windsors’ health problems were only just beginning.\nOn February 5, Buckingham Palace announced to the nation the King had cancer – not prostate cancer but another undisclosed form.\nThe Duke of Sussex made a transatlantic dash to see his father, but in the end met him for around 30 minutes, and had no reunion with William.\nCharles, who had already begun treatment, cancelled all face-to-face public duties, and William returned to work, restarting his official engagements, with the Princess Royal and the Queen also holding the fort.\nCamilla, on a visit to Salisbury, said the King was doing “extremely well under the circumstances”.\nHarry gave an interview to Good Morning America and suggested the King’s illness could lead to a reconciliation with his father, saying: “I love my family.”\nCharles went on to resume his weekly audiences with the then-prime minister, and told Rishi Sunak the public’s “wonderful” get well messages had “reduced me to tears most of the time”.\nWilliam pulled out of attending his godfather King Constantine of Greece’s memorial service in Windsor at the last minute due to an undisclosed personal matter, fuelling speculation about Kate’s health.\nThere was devastating news at the end of February when the Palace announced the sudden death of Thomas Kingston, the 45-year-old husband of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent’s daughter Lady Gabriella Kingston.\nMr Kingston took his own life, in what his family said was an impulsive action provoked by an adverse reaction to depression drugs and sleeping tablets, an inquest later found.\n– March\nThere were concerns about the “threadbare” working monarchy, with Anne carrying on with her many engagements, the ailing Duke of Kent also out on public duties and the Queen heading off on a week’s break.\nRumours began to intensify on social media about Kate, with no sighting of the princess for more than two months.\nBut soon after, she was papped, wearing dark sunglasses, being driven in a car by her mother near Windsor.\nSarah, Duchess of York was given good news, when she learned her skin cancer had not spread.\nConspiracy theories about Kate’s whereabouts abounded online and speculation grew worse when Kensington Palace released a Mother’s Day photograph of the princess and her three children, and photo agencies “killed” the image when it turned out to have been digitally altered.\nThank you for your kind wishes and continued support over the last two months.\nWishing everyone a Happy Mother's Day.

new black and white photo of George, looking grown up in an open-necked white shirt and dark blazer and wearing a friendship bracelet on his left wrist, marked his 11th birthday.\nA National Audi Office report revealed the ongoing £369 million renovations of Buckingham Palace had been well managed but structural damage and the discovery of asbestos, which led to cost increases, “could have been foreseen”.\nWishing Prince George a very happy 11th birthday today!\n📸 The Princess of Wales, 2024 pic.twitter.com/Tybyz7Z8cs\n— The Prince and Princess of Wales (@KensingtonRoyal) July 22,
