  "body_text": "- Read on for the latest news and gossip from around the grounds in Canberra sport. This week we've got the Australian No.1 from Canberra you might not have heard of, why a Queanbeyan export is walking away from the AFLW and a scrapper chasing gold.\nJoey Wild had never even heard of pickleball the first time he stepped onto a court in Texas. Needless to say he got absolutely schooled. But since then, \"I haven't put the paddle down\" - and now the Canberra export is the best in the country with an Olympic dream.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nHe's making appearances on national television, seeing his name in newspapers and talking pickleball on podcasts as Australia's No.1 ranked player on the Pro Pickleball Association tour.\nSome change from the day the Daramalan College product was dusted in his first game on public courts in Austin, where he was studying a postgraduate degree in electrical engineering at the University of Texas.\n\"I was living over in the US and it was just going crazy. Everything was shut down in the middle of COVID. Soccer was shut down, which was the sport I'd played all my life, and then one of my mates invited me out for a hit of a sport I'd never heard of before or even seen,\" Wild said.\n\"He took me out one night, it was an average evening in Austin. We played against a couple of other blokes there, and they schooled us. They worked us around the court and I had no idea what was going on, but I loved every second of it.\n\"Since then, I haven't put the paddle down.\"\nWild jokes pickleball being snubbed by the International Olympic Committee is \"one of the biggest disgraces of the 21st century\". In a tongue-in-cheek video posted on Instagram, he calls it the most athletic and entertaining sport known to man, and figures it could easily replace equestrian (because the horse does most of the work), table tennis (because why would you have foosball when you already have soccer?), rowing (because it's a gym warm-up, and don't even get him started on the cox), and of course, breakdancing (no comment necessary).\nNow he wants pickleball included on the Olympic Games schedule for Brisbane in 2032.\n\"I'm currently No.1 in Australia so I want to keep that up and bring the whole level of Australia up to where the US is. It's kind of a pipe dream, but if it was to become an Olympic sport, that would be a dream come true,\" Wild said.\n\"For now it's about raising awareness. For me, it's just a sport I found at the right time which made me happy. I'd love for people to have that joy.\"\nThe sport's roots can be traced back to the 1960s, with the game played with paddles on courts smaller than those used for tennis. The ball is light with holes in it, and a rule set is designed to reward tactical movement as opposed to brute force.\nSome think there's a rivalry brewing between pickleball and tennis. But Nick Kyrgios and Naomi Osaka have already invested in the Miami Pickleball Club - alongside Super Bowl-winning quarterback Patrick Mahomes - in the Major League Pickleball competition in the US.\n\"I probably picked it up just as it was booming. It's a really social game and easy to get good at,\" Wild said.\n\"Last year when I left Austin, there were publicly accessible venues where there would be three or four courts, there were four of those within 10 minutes of the city. They'd just be packed every single afternoon, with people playing and queuing up to get on the courts.\n\"On the professional side of things, it wasn't much five years ago, but now it's huge. Sell-out events with grandstand seating ... it's hard to think of for Australia because we don't really have it here, but in the States, it's just nuts.\"\nTHE BATTLE OF THE COMETS\nI mean, 51 is good, but it's not 61, is it? Hanno Jacobs jokes he might have bragging rights over ACT Comets coach Jono Dean when they return to training at Phillip Oval.\n\"Jono's a great man, but maybe I'll have to hold it against him,\" Jacobs grinned.\nBecause the former ANU all-rounder just blasted 61 from 60 balls for the Prime Minister's XI at Manuka Oval, picking apart a Test-quality Indian bowling attack missing just Jasprit Bumrah from their ranks.\nPM's XI appearances from Comets players have been few and far between since Ricky Ponting walked over to Dean and said: \"Guess what? You're opening the batting, good luck.\" Dean responded with a 40-ball half-century at the top of the order for the Prime Minister's XI against the West Indies, landed a Big Bash contract and eventually won a title with the Adelaide Strikers.\nSo, you'd figure the former ANU all-rounder could eventually be on the radar of domestic sides, because he certainly didn't let Prime Minister Anthony Albanese down.\n\"Always nerves in a game like this, but you've just got to embrace it. It was good fun. They had a good attack, after 20 or so balls I felt a bit more comfortable,\" Jacobs said.\n\"It was an awesome time with the likes of Scotty Boland and Tim Paine, there's so much to learn off those guys. Even to rub shoulders with Rohit [Sharma] and Shubman Gill was awesome.\n\"Hopefully I can push further in the future. If I'm more comfortable the next time, I'm better for it.\"\nQUEANBEYAN AFLW STAR CALLS TIME\nHannah Dunn feels like she has more to give to football - but her son needs her more.\nThe former Queanbeyan Tigers premiership-winning captain has retired from AFLW, ending her stint with Port Adelaide after giving birth to son Oliver in October.\nDunn made her debut for the GWS Giants and captained the Gold Coast Suns before becoming one of Port Adelaide's marquee signings alongside the likes of Erin Phillips and Gemma Houghton in 2022.\nThe Queanbeyan export missed Port Adelaide's run to the 2024 finals series after announcing her pregnancy, and the arrival of her baby boy has convinced her the time is right to retire.\n\"I would have loved to keep playing and feel like I probably have a bit more in me, but it was going to prove difficult logistically with Oliver and my husband's business being interstate,\" Dunn explained.\n\"In saying that, this has been one of the most rewarding and unforgettable chapters of my life. I'm very grateful that I was given the opportunity to play at the highest level. It's been an absolute privilege to play with and against so many talented players.\n\"The club has done an excellent job to create a program and an environment that sets its players up for success.\n\"While it was hard not playing this year, it has probably made the transition to retirement a bit easier. It was so good to see all the hard work pay off for the girls. They put in so much over the off season and this year's performance was a result of that work. I can't wait to see what the group can achieve next year and beyond.\"\nDIDIER CHASING GOLD\nDuke Didier can talk the talk. The best part about it? He'll walk the walk.\nWith mixed martial arts gold, grappling titles, and a Commonwealth Games appearance for judo, Didier will feature on a Fusion Fighting Championship card in search of the promotion's 100-kilogram Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu championship at the Melbourne Pavilion on February 21.\nVowing to stay active while coaching and fighting out of Progression MMA, the Canberra product takes on Augusto Cursino - an opponent he has beaten before - inside a cage, under the bright lights for a promotion marketed as the country's most exciting jiu-jitsu show.\nAnd of course, Didier has a message for the man in his way.\n\"Your wins don't impress me, your takedowns don't impress me, your submissions don't impress me,\" Didier said in a video shared by Fusion Fighting Championship.\n\"I beat this guy once already before. After I beat him, all I hear is whining about weight, and that I was too big for him. There's nowhere I don't win this.\n\"Once they lock that cage door, it's going to be a very bad night for that boy.\"\nBUILDING THE PERFECT COURSE\nImagine you're taking the best 18 holes across Canberra and putting them all together on one golf course. That's just what we want to do.\nDepending on who you talk to, you could make a case for all 18 of the best holes in the region to come from Federal and Royal Canberra - which is why we want to hear from you.\nIt might be the most picturesque or the most challenging. Maybe Dave Irvine would be keen to include the 21st at Royal Canberra, because for most it's a par four, but for him, it's hole-in-one territory.\nMaybe it's a hole from the Canberra Public Golf Course - the no-collar club once likened to an overgrown goat track which now opens its doors to dogs to join you while you play. Wherever it is, we want to hear from you.\nHave your say\n- Have you heard something and want to get in touch?\n- caden.helmers@canberratimes.com.au",
