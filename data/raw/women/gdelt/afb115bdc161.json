The Ted Lasso star was joined by Brendan Hunt for a cover of the B-52's 1989 hit, \"Love Shack.\" The B-52s had been around for more than a decade when they released the song, which brought them out of the underground into the mainstream.\nAt THUNDERGONG!, an energetic Waddingham hits the stage after Jason Sudeikis introduces her as Hunt sings the intro of the song. Their groovy rock rendition of the song is a heart-warming, fun watch. Hunt is comical and dramatic, while Waddingham is just as dramatic, but just a better singer. Watch their performance below:\nWaddingham covered A Star Is Born's \"Shallow\" with Sudeikis at the same show. She kicked off Will Forte before he attempted to sing Lady Gaga’s part. In perfect Wadidingham fashion, she stepped in between Sudeikis and Forte, not missing a beat of the song. She then smashed her hand on Forte’s face and pushed him aside. Later during the annual benefit concert for amputees in need, she shaved off Hunt’s beard while Sudeikis serenaded him with Justin Bieber’s “Love Yourself.”\nTHUNDERGONG! 2023\nSudeikis described THUNDERGONG! as “your most clever friend made you a mixtape” with songs that make you cry and songs that make you excited. The actor and comedian said the variety show, which began in 2017, is an evening of “that great, eclectic mixtape.” Waddingham said it best with, “It’s hunkering down with your pals, and creating things for the greater good.” Last year, the event raised over $600,000 for the Steps of Faith Foundation to provide prosthetic limbs for amputees. This year’s pinball-themed musical throwdown raised a new high score of $804,267 raised after six years. Other performers at this year’s event included singer-songwriter Nathaniel Rateliff, comedian Sam Richardson, musician Kevin Morby, and band Summer Breeze.\n‘Ted Lasso’ Finale: Where Do The Characters Go From Here?\nAfter three seasons, Apple TV's Ted Lasso ended after dropping its series finale yesterday (May 31). The producers have always said that it will end after three seasons. Jason Sudeikis, who stars as the title character, developed the series with Bill Lawrence, Brendan Hunt (who plays Coach Beard) and Joe Kelly, told Deadline that, \"This is the end of this story that we wanted to tell, that we were hoping to tell, that we loved to tell.\" But Sudeikis and his team have expressed being open to spinoffs. And surely Apple TV would love to continue the stories of at least some of the characters. On the other hand, Apple is a company that prides itself in innovation. Many streamers put a lot of work into bringing back old characters (Disney+ mostly lives off of new stories in the Marvel and Star Wars universes, Paramount+ has done well by spinning off The Good Fight from The Good Wife and preserving the Star Trek universe). But Apple is a company that the iPod revolutionized; and when the iPod became obsolete, they quietly said goodbye to it.\nOn the one hand, the finale neatly wrapped up the most compelling storylines. It may not have been perfect, but neither is life - that's sort of Ted Lasso's message. But unless you're a troll, it was a pretty satisfying ending. They nailed the landing in a way that few series have. On the other hand, they certainly left room for more stories to be told.\nSo we thought it would be fun to look at where our characters ended up, and how their stories can continue in potential spinoffs or specials. It should go without saying but we'll say it anyway: There are spoilers ahead, so don't read this unless you've finished the series.",
