  "body_text": "'The Old Trafford waterfall' - How the world reacted to Man Utd's terribly leaky roof\n- Man Utd lost 1-0 at home to Arsenal on Sunday\n- Old Trafford roof gave away again as rain fell to the stands\n- Irony of metaphor for state of club disrepair was not lost on anyone\nBy Sean Walsh\nManchester United became the laughing stock of world football again on Sunday, but at least it wasn't for anything to do with the performance of the men's first team.\nIf anything, the playing squads did well to hold the image of the club up in spite of some off-field nonsense. United's women's side won their first-ever FA Cup down at Wembley, while back at Old Trafford, a heavily depleted men's team put up a good fight in a 1-0 loss to Premier League title-chasers Arsenal.\nAfter being hammered 4-0 by Crystal Palace on Monday, Erik ten Hag's charges were in desperate need of a performance as much as a result back on home soil against the Gunners.\nAgainst the backdrop of a roasting Manchester afternoon, they were spiriting if not wasteful. But as the storm clouds crept in and the rain started to poor, attention was taken away from the game and towards the stands, were fans hurried out of their seats and towards the gangways. The rain was falling, and once more, the Old Trafford roof was not keeping to its end of the bargain.\nUnited's disappointing season continues to fade away with not much of a whimper, and the continued issue of the roof was ironic given the state of disrepair all around the club.\nThere's work ahead for Sir Jim Ratcliffe to attend to. How can he and INEOS turn United around on and off the pitch?",
