  "body_text": "Georgia head coach Kirby Smart has a way of living up to his last name.\nLonghorns Daily News: Georgia’s Kirby Smart: Texas joining SEC is ‘extremely tough’\nPlus: The biggest of days for Texas softball\nBut despite winning two out of the last three College Football Playoffs, Smart recently admitted he views the Texas Longhorns as a threat ahead of the program’s joining the Southeastern Conference, alongside regional rival Oklahoma, later this summer.\n“It’s extremely tough, the fact that they’re in our conference,” Smart said, per On3. “They’re further away. They’re a powerful football team. They’ve got a great state to recruit in.”\nSmart added that that’s the case for Oklahoma, too.\n“Both their coaching staffs are really good,” Smart said. “Sark and Brent [Venables] both have SEC experience, with Brent being over in the ACC and playing at Clemson he’s played SEC teams forever. They both know the climate their jumping into and we think it makes our conference better. The brand extends further west.”\nWHAT THEY’RE SAYING ABOUT THE LONGHORNS\nAssociated Press: SEC left with more questions than answers after NCAA’s landmark $2.8 billion settlement\nAustin American-Statesman: Texas football will face UTSA in 2024’s first night game\nAustin American-Statesman: The ABCs of the Texas Longhorns and the College Station Regional\nAustin American-Statesman: Texas faces Stanford in Women’s College World Series game.
