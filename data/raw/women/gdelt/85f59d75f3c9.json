  "body_text": "Sport groups in Morley and Noranda will soon have more space at their club building.\nThe City of Bayswater has selected Solution 4 Building to carry out upgrades to the Morley Noranda Recreation Club at the Noranda Sporting Complex.\nThe $717,566.37 contract includes the demolition of part of the existing changerooms and extending the building to include four new accessible changerooms — two for women and two for match officials.\nThe upgrades are expected to benefit the Noranda City Football Club, Morley Bowling Club, Noranda Tennis Club, Morley Darts Club and Brumbies Country Music Club.\nNine submissions for the project were received by the city.\nSolution 4 Building’s bid was not the lowest price but the city’s assessment panel had more confidence in it.\nA council report said the lowest bid was 41 per cent lower than the average cost of all the other submissions but it did not provide enough detail and the panel was not confident it could deliver the project.\nThe works were a Federal election commitment in 2022 and in January 2024 the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communication and the Arts committed $800,000 to the project.\nAny leftover money from the grant will be returned.",
