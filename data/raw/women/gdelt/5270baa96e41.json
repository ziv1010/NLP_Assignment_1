The conversations had been going really well but the World Cup was ahead of us, so they needed to stop and then start up after the World Cup. That's what happened.\n\"That makes me really happy because it's good for the players and good for the women's game to take the next step. We can focus on football.\"\nThe Lionesses are set to face Scotland in their first Nation's League match tomorrow at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland.",
