Newcastle United’s announcement of a new senior arrival in July generated all of those.\nA new chief executive and sporting director were the two appointments needed, yet an unexpected hire for an entirely new position was made at a point when there was a lack of executive-level leadership.\nAdvertisement\nSudarshan Gopaladesikan — or “Suds”, as he is known — had joined from Italian side Atalanta as Newcastle’s first technical director, to lead “football data operations” and, according to the club, “report into a new sporting director”. That prompted questions as to what Gopaladesikan’s specific remit would be, why he was in situ three months before Ross Wilson was confirmed as the new sporting director just over a week ago, and, most importantly, who had given him the job.\nThe decision, it turns out, came from the very top.\nGopaladesikan’s appointment may have been a legacy hire from the Paul Mitchell era, but it followed a mandate from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), Newcastle’s majority ownership, to revolutionise the use of data and AI at the club and bring in a “best-in-class” hire. Senior PIF figures wanted to introduce greater objectivity into the decision-making process and Gopaladesikan’s growing reputation had already reached the Gulf state.\n“The way the ownership are approaching Newcastle, it’s like they’re driving a car at a very fast speed,” says a senior source, speaking anonymously so they can talk freely, like others quoted in this article. “They want to get to the top as quickly as possible and see data as a critical booster on the journey.”\nFirst things first: Newcastle’s version of a technical director is not to be confused with the sporting director position.\nGopaladesikan’s first role in professional football was with Benfica, ironically Newcastle’s Champions League opponents on Tuesday, having joined the Portuguese club after leaving Microsoft. He is not going to be overseeing football operations and his brief will be moulded by Wilson, but the 33-year-old’s directive is to plan for the club’s medium- and long-term technical interests. The idea is for the technical director to protect the club and Eddie Howe, the head coach, by better informing both through objective insights.\nTechnical directors elsewhere in football, especially across Europe, can essentially be sporting directors in their own right. Initially, that led to some internal concern as to the scope of Gopaladesikan’s influence, until his actual role was explained.\nAdvertisement\nDuring discussions over what his job title at Newcastle should be, Mitchell was keen not to pigeonhole Gopaladesikan as “the data guy” by making his designation too narrow. Mitchell envisioned him becoming the “James Bunce equivalent” on the data-and-insights side, as one insider describes it. Bunce became the club’s first performance director in 2024, and the idea is for Gopaladesikan to lead data operations, while also bridging across departments to create further connectivity. Newcastle stated he would implement “data-informed practices across all sporting departments throughout men’s, women’s and academy teams”.\nThere are those at the club, meanwhile, who describe Gopaladesikan’s purview as being “the purest definition of a technical director, relative to other technical director roles”.\nGopaladesikan has told others at Newcastle that he sees his position as defining the DNA of the club’s playing philosophy and principles under Howe, to then inform and influence decision-making. With that information to hand, data models and algorithms can be built to guide match preparation, performance, sports science, recruitment, loans, player rotation and much more.\nThe idea is to remove some of the outside emotions and bias from decision-making through data, while also safeguarding continuity in the long run.\nPIF is pump-priming the use of data and AI across dozens of other companies and is determined that Newcastle do not fall further behind in the elite footballing sphere.\nMomentum is already being generated, with Newcastle confident they are on course to construct one of the best-qualified data teams in Europe, even if they are still low on numbers relative to many elite clubs. Howe really trusts Michael Emmerson, head of data and insights, and Tom Coffield, head of performance analysis, and the vision is to better support them with additional manpower.\nAdvertisement\nNewcastle’s first principal scientist is close to being confirmed — a role which was signed off directly by PIF — with a highly regarded individual from a serial trophy-winning club who are already fixtures at Champions League level set to join. This person will focus solely on recruitment analytics, building models to estimate player skill, positional flexibility and their transferability into Newcastle’s system. Another couple of additions are anticipated, too, including an academy-focused position.\nThe change in approach requires patience, however.\nAt the Portugal Football Summit earlier this month, where Gopaladesikan was a panellist, he stressed that the shift to becoming a data-driven organisation is never “immediate”.\nJust as the role itself is a novelty, Gopaladesikan has taken an unorthodox route to a senior position at a Premier League club.\nBorn in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania to Indian parents, Gopaladesikan — who speaks five languages — studied mathematics at Swarthmore College, just outside Philadelphia, before joining Microsoft. As a program manager, Gopaladesikan visited sports clubs around the world and, after rolling out a technical partnership with Real Madrid, settled in Lisbon, where he founded Benfica’s first sports-data-science department.\nAfter five years in Portugal’s capital, Lee Congerton, the former Leicester City executive, lured Gopaladesikan to Atalanta, just as he was about to join the footballing arm of the Red Bull group. Congerton credits Gopaladesikan with bringing a “360-degree view to various transfer-market ideas” and, as the Bergamo-based Serie A club’s director of football intelligence, he developed a state-of-the-art statistical analytics program.\nThat helped convince Atalanta to sign Ademola Lookman (from RB Leipzig) and Rasmus Hojlund (from Sturm Graz) — with the latter’s movement mapped and overlaid on a visual representation of the club’s attacking play, showing how the Danish striker could perfectly slot in — for a combined €31million (£26.9m/$36.1m at the current rates).\nIf Mitchell’s clumsy claim that Newcastle’s recruitment model was not “fit for purpose” last year was negatively received internally, there is nevertheless an acceptance that the club must keep evolving.\nAdvertisement\n“The way we recruit players, it’s only going to become more data-based,” Eddie Howe told The Athletic. “The key with data, though, is it has to be your data. Bespoke to your team, your club. That’s the challenge — to create that ourselves.”\nThat is where Gopaladesikan comes in. He and his team will build algorithms and use AI models which are Newcastle-specific, making the club less reactive and more proactive. The goal is for transfer spend to become reduced, given PSR (the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules) restrictions.\nBeyond further refining how Newcastle identify players with the characteristics required to carry out the particular roles Howe desires, there is a belief data can better place young loanees at other clubs, improve individualised development programmes, hone set-piece delivery and provide coaches with customised analysis tools.\nWith recruitment, Howe demands targets with certain non-negotiables, but data can help shift biases from what a player cannot do to what they can do — potentially opening up fresh markets and widening the pool of options.\nThere is internal conviction in Howe’s ability as a player developer, so there is a desire to provide Newcastle’s head coach with greater prior knowledge of the exact refinement a potential recruit would require.\nGopaladesikan’s age and unconventional footballing background have generated some scepticism.\nGiven Newcastle’s previous sporting director oversaw the recruitment process, Gopaladesikan was also initially viewed by some as “Mitchell’s man”. Yet the pair only met once and Gopaladesikan was really a PIF-led appointment — contact was first made in August last year — and his influence will be shaped by Wilson.\nDescribed by a former colleague as having a “sky-high IQ and sky-high EQ (emotional quotient)”, Gopaladesikan’s soft skills will be critical in building relationships. He does not yet have a specific office at Newcastle’s training ground, but once their Benton base is restructured and extended later this season, there will be a dedicated space for the data team.\nAdvertisement\nEarning Howe’s trust is an ongoing process. The head coach was initially suspicious of Bunce, but soon embraced the performance director once he saw the positive influence he could have.\nThe hope is, in time, the same happens with Gopaladesikan, who has been welcomed by Howe, but whose impact will be better felt once his data models are finished. Validation of his methods is crucial.\n“Bringing such a profile inside the technical team was a challenge,” says Domingos Oliveira, Benfica’s CEO when Gopaladesikan was tasked with improving technical analysis there. “Some staff were reluctant to use data analysis. But, with time, senior coaches not only accepted, but strongly embraced, the use of data in decision-making.”\nGopaladesikan is not blinded by the importance of statistics, though, and told the Portugal Football Summit that outlining the pitfalls of any data set is essential. It is only part of the decision-making equation, not the entire picture.\nCritically, he is not going to be the ultimate decision-maker. Howe retains final say on recruitment, Steve Harper runs the academy and Bunce oversees performance. The idea behind the American’s role is to enhance what others do by providing objective data to better inform their calls.\nIf one of Gopaladesikan’s weaknesses is his atypical footballing background, those at the top of Newcastle’s heirarchy feel it can also be his greatest strength. He is not conditioned to think in a specific way — and that brings creativity and a fresh perspective.",
