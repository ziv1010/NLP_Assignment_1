Dodge the motorbikes whizzing around impossibly tight bends, people dragging wheelbarrows through dense crowds and the gerrabs dressed in traditional red and green outfits before stepping inside the tightly packed market stalls.\nAdvertisement\nThere is merchandise on offer from some of the biggest clubs in the world, including Barcelona, Manchester United and Real Madrid, but one team appears more than any other. Paris Saint-Germain’s kits are available in lots of different colours but the name on the back of the shirts is always the same.\nAchraf Hakimi is Morocco’s captain and star player. In November, the 27-year-old won the Confederation of African Football (CAF) men’s Player of the Year award, beating Liverpool and Egypt forward Mohamed Salah. When Hakimi finished behind Nigeria’s Ademola Lookman in 2024, some of the crowd walked out of the event held in Morocco’s capital, Rabat. He finished sixth in the voting for the 2025 Ballon d’Or and was named in the men’s XI of the year at the FIFA Best awards.\nHakimi is the poster boy for the 35th edition of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), which Morocco has been hosting over the past few weeks. When the defender came off the bench in their third group game against Zambia — his first appearance of the tournament after recovering from an ankle injury he suffered playing for PSG against Bayern Munich at the beginning of November — the crowd inside the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium went wild. They screamed in frustration when a diving save from Zambia’s goalkeeper Willard Mwanza prevented him from making a goalscoring comeback. Hakimi has started Morocco’s past two games and is expected to lead them in Wednesday’s semi-final against Nigeria.\nHowever, a cloud has been hanging over Hakimi for the past three years. In February 2023, French prosecutors opened a preliminary investigation into an allegation of rape against him. He was charged the following month and placed under judicial supervision. Hakimi has repeatedly denied the accusations and claimed he is a victim of “blackmail”.\nAdvertisement\nThe case has dragged on but the Nanterre prosecutor’s office told The Athletic it issued a final referral to the criminal courts in August. The investigating judge now needs to decide whether Hakimi will face trial or not.\nHakimi is unconditionally idolised around the world, not just in Morocco, but should he be? And what will happen if he lifts the AFCON trophy this weekend and then finds himself in a courtroom later this year?\nHakimi grew up in Spain but never showed any interest in representing them, unlike his international team-mate and Real Madrid forward Brahim Diaz, who is the top goalscorer at this edition of AFCON. Hakimi started his career in Madrid’s academy, then played for Borussia Dortmund and Inter before moving to PSG in July 2021 for €60million (£52m, $70m).\nHakimi has won four consecutive French league titles with PSG and helped them win the Champions League for the first time last season, scoring the opening goal in a thrilling 5-0 victory over his former side Inter in the final.\nHe scored the decisive penalty when Morocco beat Spain in a shootout in the round of 16 at the last World Cup and played a crucial role in helping them to become the first African side to reach the semi-finals in the competition’s history.\nThey have been drawn into a group with Brazil, Scotland and Haiti for this summer’s tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Hakimi will be 31 and could still be close to the peak of his powers when Morocco co-hosts the 2030 World Cup with Spain, Portugal, Paraguay and Uruguay. In the summer of 2024, instead of taking a break, he claimed a bronze medal with his country at the Olympics after they lost to eventual champions Spain in the semi-finals.\nMen and women of all ages wear his shirts — PSG team-mate Kylian Mbappe even turned up for the group game against Mali sporting Hakimi’s Morocco top — while he advertises products for the telecommunications company Inwi on billboards throughout the country. It is easy to understand why the public worship Hakimi but they appear to be ignoring that he is under investigation in France for allegedly committing a serious offence, albeit he strenuously denies any wrongdoing.\nAccording to multiple reports in the French media, Hakimi is said to have started exchanging messages with a 24-year-old woman on Instagram in January 2023. It is claimed he paid for a taxi to collect her and drop her off at his home in Boulogne-Billancourt on the evening of February 25. It was the same weekend that PSG beat Marseille 3-0 in an away game in the French top flight but Hakimi was not in the squad due to a thigh injury. Hiba Abouk, Hakimi’s then-wife, was on holiday with their children.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to the French media, the woman claims Hakimi started kissing her and making non-consensual sexual advances.\nThe alleged victim visited a police station in Nogent-sur-Marne (Val-de-Marne) the following day and claimed she had been raped but declined to make a formal complaint. The Nanterre prosecutor’s office took control of the case from their counterparts in Creteil. Hakimi was questioned by the authorities and formally charged with rape on March 2.\nIn a statement to The Athletic at the time, PSG said: “The club supports the player who has firmly denied the accusations and trusts the justice system. PSG is an institution that promotes respect on and off the pitch.”\nA month after the alleged incident, Abouk released a statement on social media which said: “Some time ago, after much reflection, the father of my children and I made the decision to end our relationship, long before the events in which I have been involved in the media and of which I am totally unaware.”\nShe spoke of needing “time to digest the shock” of the situation, adding: “We can only trust in the good work of justice.”\nThe police investigation has not prevented Hakimi from travelling abroad to play for club and country. He started all four of Morocco’s games at the 2023 AFCON, which was held at the beginning of 2024 to avoid the extreme weather of the host nation, the Ivory Coast. Hakimi did not have to travel far for the Olympics later that year because they were held in Paris. He captained Morocco and started all of their games. He featured for PSG at last summer’s Club World Cup in the United States.\nIn January 2025, Hakimi spoke publicly about the accusations for the first time in an interview with the podcast #ABtalks and claimed he was the victim of a “blackmail” attempt.\n“It’s the first I speak about that with anyone because, since this incident two years ago, I haven’t said an opinion or anything, and, as I said, we left this matter to the judiciary and it’s the best way to explain things,” Hakimi said.\nAdvertisement\n“When you achieve success and things go well, you become an easy target. That taught me that I shouldn’t trust a lot of people around me.”\nIn August, French prosecutors called for Hakimi to face trial in a criminal court. A decision on whether or not he will face trial is still awaited. The following month, he said, “I have never been subjected to such harm” during an interview with Clique TV for a documentary about his life on CANAL+.\n“For me, it was difficult and it continues to be,” he said. “Because when you write lie after lie, it hurts, especially for my family. My children are still young. They don’t know the internet and they can’t read. But one day, they’re going to read this kind of thing. And for me, seeing that these lies have been written about their father is not pleasant. And I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.\n“I know that what I was accused of is a lie. I know who I am. I know that I have done nothing and that I will never do that. I have always been at the disposal of the police. I even asked to speak to them to give my version of events. They also have my DNA. I have always been at their entire disposal…”\nIn a statement given to The Athletic on Tuesday, Hakimi’s lawyer, Fanny Colin, said: “Achraf Hakimi is charged with false accusation, which is evidenced by all the elements of the case.\n“Achraf Hakimi will therefore attend any trial with the utmost serenity, confidence and fighting spirit.”\nHakimi’s career does not appear to have been impacted by the allegations. Morocco’s head coach Walid Regragui described him as a “true leader” and a “source of motivation” for his team-mates following their 2-0 victory over Cameroon in the AFCON quarter-finals.\nPeople were dancing in the streets of Rabat after that game because Morocco reached the last four of this competition for the first time in 21 years. If Hakimi plays a pivotal role in helping them to lift the trophy for the third time — they have not won since 1976 — he will be at the centre of the celebrations. It would be a difficult image for others to accept, though, given the seriousness of the allegations against him.",
