He said the choice and decision of the forum to pitch their tent and support Sanwo-Olu’s re-election bid was hinged on his hard work, sterling performance in the area of infrastructure and engagement with critical stakeholders of the society.\nHe said 65 members of the FPP are deregistered political parties.\nAjayi said: “The deregistered members of the FPP still have their full political structures on the ground across all the 20 local government areas and 37 local council development areas of Lagos State, and they will activate it to achieve victory for the governor on Saturday.”\nIn another development, the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika has described Governor Sanwo-Olu as the best option.\nThe minister, who urged the electorate to avoid sentiment, also said it will be risky to take a chance with inexperienced hands.\nSirika made this known via his official Twitter handle @hadisirika yesterday evening. The tweet reads: “I lived & played in Lagos for decades, I understand & appreciate its socio-economic & political significance to our country.\n“It will be risky to take a chance with inexperience hands. I know stakes are high, regardless, Sanwo-Olu is the best option. Avoid sentiments, vote wisely”.\nSimilarly, Christians and Muslims under the aegis of the Alimosho Council of Religious Leaders have pledged their support for the re-election of the Lagos governor, following his first term performance.\nThe convener of the group, Dr. Dickson Elijah Asaju said at a press conference in Lagos on Wednesday that the mandate of the group is to restate its confidence in the leadership of the governor and to throw its weight behind his election for a second term in office.\nHe said: “We are all living witnesses to his sterling performance in taking Lagos State to another enviable level. In his first four years, he has proved that he is reliable and dependable in leadership. With all we can see and hear across the state, we want to stand firmly behind his candidacy and call on all well-meaning residents of Lagos State to vote for him and all candidates of the APC.”\nThe governor wrapped up his campaign with a grand road show in Alimosho yesterday.\nAkiolu rejects Rhodes-Vivour, says Sanwo-Olu will win\nThe Oba of Lagos, Riliwan Akiolu, has again declared his support for Governor Sanwo-Olu in tomorrow’s election, saying he will win.\nOba Akiolu spoke yesterday when the LP governorship candidate, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, visited the Iga-Iduganran palace to make his intentions known. While Akiolu hailed Rhodes-Vivour for his courage and persistence, he however insisted that Sanwo-Olu would be victorious in Saturday’s poll.\nHe said: “I declared my support for Sanwo-Olu because I believe in him and the Lord has said it is Sanwo-Olu who will win. For you Gbadebo, the future is open to us. God will not kill you; there is nothing wrong in you contesting. All of those contesting are my children. God should help us to make the state better. When Sanwo-Olu wins, the government will involve all of us, there is no winner takes all, and God will grant him long life.”\nOn the alleged statement that ‘Lagos is a no man’s land’, the monarch said such should not be heard of and urged Lagosians to eschew any act of electoral violence but embrace peace in discharging their civil duty.\n“By the grace of God, there is no reason we should quarrel with ourselves. The people should come out en masse and be very peaceful while performing their constitutional duties. There should be no harassment of anyone, we are all part and parcel of this country.”\nProfessionals root for Makinde\nThe Oremeji Agugu group of Professionals, a body of young men and women in Ibadan, Oyo State has asked residents to vote en masse for Governor Seyi Makinde’s re-election .\nA statement by the group’s Chairman Micheal Olutoye Oyeleye, said: ‘’it is stated Makinde has recorded landmark achievements in the last four years which should pave way for him to win reelection.\n“Governor Seyi Makinde did a yeoman’s job in his first four years as Oyo State helmsman. He has recorded landmark achievements which are unprecedented which we feel the Oyo State residents will cherish and so support him in his reelection bid.”\nThe statement noted: “The governor is a man of vision and is borne by mission to leave indelible legacy. This mindset is what has set him apart. If achievement is what determines reelection then Engr. Makinde should have an easy ride to victory. He’s ranked among the best governors Oyo State has produced.”\nMicheal highlighted among other achievements provision of sports infrastructure across the state evident in refurbishment of stadia in different zones of the state, funding of football clubs campaigning in national leagues, rejuvenating our hopes and performances at the Sports Festival through great motivations and rewards for Sportsmen and women and so on just as the good performance being posted by Oyo state contingents at various national meeting is mentioned as another credible achievement of the incumbent governor.\nPLATEAU:\nThree governorship candidates step down for APC candidate\nAhead the governorship and House of Assembly elections in Plateau State, three governorship candidates have stepped down from the race and unanimously endorsed their APC counterpart, Dr Nentawe Yilwada.\nThe three political parties are the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), the Action Alliance (AA), and the African Democratic Party (ADP). They have already collapsed their structures into that of APC.\nIn a brief ceremony to receive the new members into the fold at the APC party secretariat in Jos yesterday, the APC chairman, Rufus Bature said their addition to the party is a homecoming as many of them were members of the APC at its formation.\nHe assured them that they would be accorded the same privileges as those they met on the ground, adding that their returns to the APC would not be taken for granted. He added: “As far as we are concerned, every single vote is important to us”\nResponding on behalf of the governorship candidates, Chief Yibalkos Amos Adam, the candidate, said: “We jettisoned our ambition to support the candidate of the APC, Professor Nentawe Yiltwada, because of his background and the qualities that placed him ahead of other candidates.”\nOYO:\n‘Like Ladoja, Makinde will overcome political coup’\nThe Oyo State chapter of the PDP has said that no amount of political coup or conspiracy against Governor Seyi Makinde by enemies would see the light of the day as the party prepares for tomorrow’s governorship and state assembly elections.\nThe chapter leadership hailed Governor Makinde for his political doggedness, firmness and sagacity amidst fierce political gang up by those described as enemies of the masses, adding that the governor will triumph at the polls, just as former Governor Rashidi Ladoja did in 2006 when faced with a similar situation.\nThis was contained in a statement by Publicity Secretary, Akeem Olatunji.\nTraditional rulers across the state have declared their support for the governor ahead of tomorrow’s election.\nThe Olugbon of Orile-Igbon, Oba Francis Alao said yesterday that traditional rulers in the five broad zones of the state have expressed their support for the incumbent governor.\nOba Alao hinged the decision of the monarchs on Makinde’s performance, saying the governor has “shown credibility, character, good governance, brilliance, understanding of the economy, and has achieved infrastructural development”.\nIn a separate development, the Oremeji Agugu group of professionals, a body of young men and women have asked Oyo State residents to vote en masse for the governor. A statement by the group’s Chairman Micheal Olutoye Oyeleye said the body took the decision based on some of the governor’s major achievements as having a direct impact on the teeming youths and masses.\nMeanwhile, the PDP candidate for Oyo South Senatorial District in the last general elections, Chief Joseph Tegbe, has urged youths across Oyo State to work for the re-election of Gov. Seyi Makinde. He said this was necessary in order to enjoy more dividends of democracy.\nTegbe spoke when he led a coalition of some leading youth groups to the Deputy Governor, Alhaji Bayo Lawal, at the Governor’s Office in Ibadan on Thursday.

This is a call to INEC to restore the citizens’ confidence in our democracy.”\nYiaga Africa raises alarm over movement of small arms\nAn election monitoring group, Yiaga Africa has raised the alarm over the proliferation of light arms and small weapons in Rivers State.\nThe organisation said it received troubling reports about the proliferation of light arms and small weapons in Abua-Odual, Andoni, Akuku Toru, Asari Toru, Eleme, Gokana, Khana and Tai councils in Rivers State.\nIt said the adoption of a House of Assembly candidate for the Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni State Constituency has created a tense atmosphere ahead of the elections in the state.\nThe organisation said this during the presentation of its third Election Manipulation Risk Index (EMRI) supported by the European Union through its Support to Democratic Governance in Nigeria (EU-SDGN) at a press conference in Abuja on Thursday.\nThe organisation said it will deploy 1,547 duly trained and accredited stationary and roving observers to observe the conduct of the governorship election in 28 states.\nA member of the Board of Yiaga Africa, Ezenwa Nwagwu said there had been a trend in both ethnic and religious divisive conversation in some states especially post the 25 February election.\nNwangwu said: “Yiaga Africa will be deploying the Parallel Vote Tabulation (PVT) methodology to observe the governorship elections in Benue, Delta and Kano states. The pre-election period has recorded relative calm since the February 25 election with no major reports of insecurity. In addition, Yiaga Africa received troubling reports about the proliferation of light arms and small weapons in Abua-Odual, Andoni, Akuku Toru, Asari Toru, Eleme, Gokana, Khana and Tai LGAs in Rivers State.”\nKADUNA:\nI won’t step down, says LP candidate\nMr Jonathan Asake, the governorship candidate of the LP in Kaduna State says he is not dropping out of tomorrow’s election for any candidate.\nAsake said this yesterday while addressing reporters in Kafanchan, the headquarters of Jema’a Local Government Area.\nHe said the allegation that he collected N100m from Uba Sani, APC candidate and Gov. Nasir el-Rufai to damage PDP’s chances on Saturday is unfounded. He said: “They are poisoning people’s minds that I am being sponsored by Uba Sani so that the votes of Southern Kaduna will be split and Uba Sani will win.\n“None of the leaders of the PDP could face me and ask for a round table, instead they resorted to using proxies to get me to step down.”\nHe challenged the PDP or anyone with evidence that he collected the money in question to make it public.\nBAYELSA:\nJonathan warns against do-or-die politics\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan has admonished politicians against do-or-die politics ahead of tomorrow’s elections.\nThe former president gave the admonition yesterday at Sampou community in Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government Area of Bayelsa State shortly after paying a condolence visit to Governor Douye Diri over the demise of his father, Pa Abraham Diri.\nJonathan stressed that politics should be about service and not about self, urging politicians to wait for God’s time to get into leadership positions.\nHe said in a democracy, the people play a critical role and wondered why those who aspire to lead want to force themselves on the people.\nHe also advised people of the state to conduct themselves in a peaceful manner during the House of Assembly elections.\nSpeaking on the late Pa Diri, Jonathan said the death of a parent is painful but urged the departed’s family to take solace in the worthy legacies he left.\nDELTA:\nEight governorship candidates adopt PDP’s Oborevwori\nEight governorship candidates in Delta State yesterday adopted the PDP governorship candidate, Chief Sheriff Oborevwori, for tomorrow’s election.\nThe governorship candidates led by Prince Henry Eze of the Allied Peoples Movement (APM) disclosed this at a news conference in Asaba.\nThe political parties were the AA, the ADP, the APM, the AAC, the ADC, APP, Accord and the Booth Party. Eze said the decision to jettison their ambitions and endorse Oborevwori for Saturday’s election was in recognition of the achievements of the PDP, especially Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa-led administration.\nHe said: “Delta is a traditional PDP state; for stability and furtherance of an atmosphere for inter-party harmony and cohesion. It became necessary to adopt a governorship candidate with good political credentials, pedigree and general acceptability as a consensus candidate for the 2023 governorship election in the state.\n“The choice of our consensus candidate fell on Sheriff Oborevwori of the PDP who happens to be the current Speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly. Oborevwori has worked very hard, embarked on ward-to-ward campaigns and done wide consultations with virtually all known stakeholders in the state.”\nBroadcaster endorses Omo-Agege\nA veteran broadcaster, Comrade Godspower Omadhebor, has endorsed the Delta governorship candidate of the APC, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, for governor.\nOmadhebor stated this yesterday in a statement issued in Effurun, Uvwie council area, asserting that Omo-Agege remains the best governorship candidate with the capacity and antecedents to change the underdevelopment trajectory of the oil-rich state.\nThe broadcaster, fondly called PG, called on his fans and all Deltans to join him to vote en masse for Omo-Agege, in tomorrow’s governorship election.\nHe berated Governor Ifeanyi Okowa-led government’s failure to tackle infrastructural decay and the dearth of socioeconomic activities across the State.\nOmadhebor, who is also an international media consultant and recently voluntarily retired from the Delta State Broadcasting Service, Warri, said the PDP government in the state should be rejected and not allowed to continue their maladministration further.\n• Reports by Kolade Adeyemi, Jos; Oyebola Owolabi, Lagos; Halimah Balogun, Lagos;\nYinka Adeniran, Ibadan; Grace Obike, Abuja; Simon Utebor, Yenagoa; Elo Edremoda, Warri; Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt; Frank Ikpefan, Abuja; Adekunle Jimoh, Ilorin; Adeola Ogunlade, Lagos; and Vincent Ikuomola, Abuja.",
