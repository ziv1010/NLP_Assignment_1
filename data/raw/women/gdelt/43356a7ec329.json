  "body_text": "The NFL recently made history by airing the first of its 2024 playoff games not on a network, but exclusively on the streaming service Peacock TV. That meant that unless you’d signed up for Peacock, you couldn’t watch the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Miami Dolphins (the Chiefs won, incidentally).\nThis arrangement had NFL fans the world over asking the same question: does Peacock have a free trial? After all, a simple solution would have been to sign up for a Peacock trial, watch the game, then cancel the subscription. The unfortunate answer is that Peacock TV does not offer a free trial. However, there’s at least one workaround to this, and, if you’re willing to pay a little bit, Peacock TV has a very inexpensive tier you can sign up for. That’s one of the reasons we think it’s one of the best live TV streaming services on the market in 2024.\nIs there a Peacock TV free trial?\nThe answer to the question, “Does Peacock TV have a free trial” is an unfortunate no. For whatever reason—perhaps because its core plans are already so cheap, or due to a lack of profitability–the streamer has decided against offering a free trial, just like there’s no Disney Plus free trial.\nThe paid Peacock plans include the Premium and Plus tiers, which cost $6 per month and $12 per month, respectively. You can also pay for 10 months at once and Peacock will give you the last two months of the year for free. These packages give you complete access to the full library of Peacock shows, channels, and movies. The only differences between the two is that the $12 per month Peacock Plus plan is ad-free and allows you to download and watch select shows and movies offline.\nOnce you sign up, you’ll get access to all of the best shows on Peacock, like Downton Abbey, Psych, and 30 Rock. You’ll also get access to live sports, so you can watch boxing, international soccer matches, and more with the cheapest subscription. If you want to see more, check out our lists of the best shows on Peacock as well as what’s new on Peacock this month to see what else is on tap.\nCan you get Peacock TV for free?\nPeacock used to have a completely free tier called Basic that had about 10,000 hours worth of content. It had ads of course, but nobody was about to complain about free. Unfortunately, Peacock stopped the free service in early 2023, so you now need to have a Plus or Premium plan in order to stream anything on the site. Bummer right? Well, there’s a slight workaround to this issue, and a way to get Peacock for free (sort of): Instacart+.\nGet Peacock TV for free with Instacart+\nInstacart is a grocery delivery and pick up service that’s exploded in popularity in recent years. Last year the company debuted its new Instacart+ subscription service, which offers a variety of benefits (unlimited free delivery on orders over $35, lower service fees, etc.) over its pay-as-you-go plan. The best part? Instacart+ now comes with a Peacock TV subscription. Instacart+ costs $9.99/month or $99/year. In sum, while you need to shell out a bit for an Instacart+ membership, this is a way to technically get Peacock TV for free.\nAre there any Peacock TV deals?\nThere’s no free or reduced Peacock TV deal going on right now, but compared to some of the other services, the regular prices are reasonable. You can sign up for Peacock Premium for just $6 per month. Peacock Premium is a great value even at its normal price, considering that you get a lot of on-demand shows and movies as well as live TV channels, so it’s a solid bargain. You can always go with Peacock Plus for $12 per month, as well, which allows you to download select titles and watch them offline and also removes a majority of the ads you’d see with the lower tier plan. Whatever the case, now’s a great time to sign up for Peacock TV to catch some of its exclusive content. Some of the best TV deals out there include Peacock subscriptions, so if you’re in the market for a new home theater screen, you might get the opportunity to test out the service.",
