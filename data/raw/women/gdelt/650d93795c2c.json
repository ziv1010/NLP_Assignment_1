  "body_text": "The Washington Spirit is finalizing an agreement with Club Olimpia to sign Paraguayan 18-year-old forward Claudia Martinez, says Club Olimpia president Rodrigo Nogués.\n“The conversations are very advanced. As an institution, we have received a very solid formal proposal, and we are currently in the contract-drafting stage. Our priority is to finalize an agreement that is both beneficial for the club and the player’s career,” Nogués told The Athletic.\nAdvertisement\nESPN has reported a $950,000 transfer fee has been agreed upon by the two clubs. Olimpia will hold onto a percentage of Martinez’s future sell-on value that the Spirit receives.\nNogués did not confirm the transfer fee or the exact sell-on percentage that Olimpia will retain. The Spirit declined to comment when approached by The Athletic.\n“The exact figures remain confidential until the signing, but I can assure you that this is one of the most significant deals in the history of Paraguayan women’s football. Furthermore, Olimpia will retain a significant percentage of the transfer fee, ensuring revenue in the event of a future sale, thus protecting the club’s assets,” he said.\nMartinez’s journey to NWSL\nIn January 2024, Martinez signed for Olimpia after one season playing for nearby Sportivo Ameliano. In July 2024, aged 16, Martinez received her first call-up to the senior Paraguayan women’s national team.\n“When we signed her in 2024, we identified a talent with enormous potential, although still in the development stage. The club provided her with the structure, the demanding environment, and the professional support so that she could maximize her abilities,” said Nogués.\n“Today, we are presenting to the international market a mature, top-tier athlete ready to make history. This evolution is a testament to her hard work, but also to the comprehensive work that Olimpia is doing.”\nMartinez’s profile greatly increased after she finished as joint top scorer with six goals at the 2025 Copa America Femenina aged 17. Across five matches, she notched a hat-trick against Bolivia, while also scoring against Colombia, Venezuela and eventual winners Brazil. Paraguay finished fifth and Martinez was named in the tournament’s Best XI.\nIn the wake of her performances for Paraguay that summer out in Ecuador, clubs from all over the world started to inquire about signing Martinez. Olimpia duly renewed her contract and briefed Martinez on what they believed would be best for her and Olimpia.\nAdvertisement\n“Following her performance in the Copa América, we received formal inquiries from several markets, including clubs in Europe and South America. We analyzed all the options, but the project in the United States is the one that best aligns with our objectives and offers the competitive development we seek for our players,” said Nogués.\nSouth America has been a growing hotbed of talent in the women’s game with top young players heading abroad after turning 18 and impressing on the international stage. In February 2023, just days after she turned 18, Colombia’s Linda Caicedo left Deportivo Cali for Real Madrid after starring at the 2022 Copa America Femenina with her country.\nIn a similar twist of fate, Martinez turned 18 on January 15 and is expected to complete her move to the Spirit this week.\nNogués hopes Martinez can impress in the NWSL and be a beacon for Paraguayan women’s soccer.\n“Claudia is a source of pride for our institution and an example of the Olimpia DNA,” he added. “She is an ambassador for the club. Seeing her leave our home to succeed internationally validates the work we are doing in all our disciplines. Her career demonstrates that Olimpia is a very significant showcase in the world and the ideal place to dream big.”",
