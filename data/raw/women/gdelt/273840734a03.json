  "body_text": "Topline:\nFan interest in women’s sports has increased over the last decade and seen a notable uptick in the last couple of years — from record-setting viewership of the FIFA Women’s World Cup final back in 2015, to 2024’s record-breaking women’s NCAA college basketball championship game, which drew a larger TV audience than the men’s game for the first time ever.\nWhy it matters: There's been a spillover effect for the WNBA, with superstar rookies — like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese — drawing big crowds and boosting ratings this year. When it comes to the Los Angeles Sparks specifically, the team saw a 30% increase in season ticket sales this year compared with 2023.\nWhat's on the schedule? While the Sparks’ last home game is today (Sept. 17), there’s also an away game on Sept. 19. And there’s still time to catch an Angel City match this season. You can check their schedule here.\nWhat to know if you're a new fan of the L.A. Sparks or Angel City: We asked our LAist followers on Facebook for their advice to new fans about attending games at BMO Stadium (the home of Angel City) or Crypto.com Arena (the home of the Sparks). Read on for their tips.",
