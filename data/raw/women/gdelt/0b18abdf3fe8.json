Only St. Sylvester’s (Dublin) and Cahir (Tipperary) have played in two previous finals, sharing one title between them.\nGalway’s final record is superb with St. Brendan’s (2001) and Claregalway (2013) also winners Only Clonbur (2014) didn’t win the big prize. But Annaghdown will be the first to claim intermediate honours twice if they overcome the Carlow and Leinster champions.\nAnd while Annaghdown may start as favourites, nothing can be taken for granted. Carlow have struggled in inter-county football but are notable for club competitiveness.\nEire Óg lost All-Ireland senior finals in 1993 and 1996 but won five Leinster crowns, while O’Hanrahan’s also took provincial honours in 2000. But this is the first time a women’s team has reached a national decider.\nBut Bennekerry/Tinryland possess one of the country’s best players in Cliodhna Ní Shé, The 24-year-old forward won the inaugural inter county golden boot in 2021, scoring 9-19 for Carlow. And she kicked 0-4 in Carlow’s Division 4 League Final win over Limerick earlier this year.\nGoal scorer Maeve O’Neill and player of the match Ruth Bermingham were other instrumental figures that day who’ll also line out in Saturday’s final. Midfielder Elaine Ware is a cousin of Connacht Rugby’s Cian Prendergast.\nPictured: Annaghdown’s Rebecca Fahy in action against Fionnuala O’Driscoll of O’Donovan Rossa during the All-Ireland Club ladies football intermediate semi-final. The Galway champions head to Croke Park on Saturday to contest the All-Ireland Final.\nFor more, read this week’s Connacht Tribune:\nConnacht Tribune Digital Edition App\nDownload the Connacht Tribune Digital Edition App to access to Galway’s best-selling newspaper.
