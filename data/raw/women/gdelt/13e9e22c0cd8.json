  "body_text": "Fifa have docked Canada women’s football team six points at Paris 2024 and banned English coach Bev Priestman for a year in an unprecedented response to the drone spying scandal.\nThe national federation was also hit with a £175,000 fine and a further two coaches were suspended as the governing body took fast-track action. It is a disastrous verdict for Canada’s gold medal hopes and individually for head coach Bev Priestman, who was Phil Neville’s assistant when he was England manager.\nPriestman, who led Canada to the Olympic title in Tokyo in 2021, was already suspended by the national soccer federation and removed from the Olympic tournament. She is now banned from all football for a year after two assistant coaches were caught using drones to spy on opponent New Zealand’s practices before their opening game on Wednesday.\nFifa judges found Priestman and her two assistants “were each found responsible for offensive behavior and violation of the principles of fair play.”\nPriestman and the Canadian federation now can challenge their sanctions at the Court of Arbitration’s special Olympic court in Paris.\nMen’s team dragged into spying row\nCanada’s camp was thrown into disarray earlier this week. Jesse Marsch’s Canada men’s squad has also been dragged into the furore on Thursday.\nKevin Blue, the Canada Soccer chief executive, confirmed he had received “anecdotal feedback” of drone use at the Copa America but Marsch had been unaware it had been used.\nOn Friday, however, Blue confirmed claims now extend to the men’s team. “I am aware of an instance of attempted drone usage at the Copa America,” Blue said. “I have spoken with our current head coach about the incident after it occurred and I know he denounced it as a practice to his staff.”\nUnlike the former Leeds United manager, who appears to be unaware of the potential use of a drone last month, Priestman, 38, was judged as “highly likely” to have been aware of the incident at the Olympics, leading to her suspension by Canada Soccer. British coach Priestman denied any involvement, but did not attend Thursday’s 2-1 victory over the Kiwis.\nCanadian media report that both of the country’s senior teams – men’s and women’s – have relied on drones for years. Blue said in a release that “additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.”\nHe added Priestman was suspended from her duties until the end of the tournament and the completion of the organisation’s independent external review. Assistant coach Andy Spence will lead the defending gold medalists for the remainder of the tournament.\nThe COC said on Wednesday that assistant coach Jasmine Mander and analyst Joseph Lombardi were “sent home immediately,” and that it had accepted Priestman’s decision to remove herself from coaching the opening match.\nPriestman had agreed to a contract in late January to coach Canada through the 2027 Women’s World Cup. She was hired in November 2020 to succeed Kenneth Heiner-Møller and had been working on a rolling contract. She led Canada to a gold medal at the 2021 Olympics, but was eliminated in the group stage of last year’s World Cup. She has coached the team to 28 wins, nine losses and 10 draws.\nThe Fifa Appeal Committee said in a statement that it had “evaluated all evidence on file” and the punishments were “for violation of art. 13 of the FDC (Offensive behaviour and violations of the principles of fair play) and art. 6.1 of the OFT Regulations (Responsibilities)”.\n“CSA was found responsible for failing to respect the applicable Fifa regulations in connection with its failure to ensure the compliance of its participating officials of the OFT with the prohibition on flying drones over any training sites,” the body said.\n“The officials were each found responsible for offensive behaviour and violation of the principles of fair play in connection with the CSA’s Women’s representative team’s drones usage in the scope of the OFT.”",
