  "body_text": "RANKED: The 5 best WSL players so far in 2024/25\n- Over half of the 2024/25 WSL season has now been played\n- Chelsea lead the way at the top of the standings\n- 90min ranks the top five standout performers so far\nAs the first international break of 2025 is well underway and the perfect time to reflect on the Women's Super League (WSL) season so far.\nChelsea comfortably lead the way at the top of the table. They hold a seven-point lead over Manchester United in second, and ten or more over both Arsenal and Manchester City.\nAt the other end of the table, newly promoted side Crystal Palace are deep in a relegation battle, but at least five teams above them are still at risk of being dragged in with a string of poor results. That includes Aston Villa, Leicester City, Everton, West Ham United and even Liverpool.\nWhether it’s guiding a team to the top of the table or keeping them afloat at the bottom, there have been a number of standout performers in the competition this season.\n90min has ranked the top five players in the WSL so far…\n5. Olivia Smith (Liverpool)\nAlthough Liverpool have endured a difficult season so far, as they sit just nine points clear of Crystal Palace, summer signing Olivia Smith has been a shining light for the Reds. She has four WSL goals for the season and has shown glimpses of becoming a star in the not too distant future.\nThe 20-year-old Canada international has quickly established herself as an integral player for Matt Beard's side, and her fitness and form could be crucial come the end of the season.\n4. Nikita Parris (Brighton)\nNikita Parris has been a standout performer for Brighton & Hove Albion this season, thriving after her summer move from Manchester United. With five goals and two assists in the WSL, she has been a key attacking force for Dario Vidosic’s side, helping them cement their place as the 'best of the rest' outside the traditional top four.\nNothing speaks louder about her impact than a recent England recall, her first Lionesses selection since November 2022. While injuries within the England squad undoubtedly played a part, Parris' inclusion ahead of clubmate Fran Kirby is a testament to the form she has shown this season.\n3. Johanna Rytting Kaneryd (Chelsea)\nJohanna Rytting Kaneryd started the season in blistering form, contributing four goals and three assists in the WSL. That audacious volley against Tottenham in October has arguably been the standout moment from the 27-year-old.\nA calf injury has disrupted her campaign, which is the only reason she isn't ranked higher. If the Swede stays fit, she will have a massive role to play as Chelsea push for silverware on four fronts in the final months of the season.\n2. Elisabeth Terland (Man Utd)\nAfter a slow start at Manchester United following her summer move from Brighton, Elisabeth Terland has now found her stride. With seven goals and four assists, she is the only player currently ranked in the top five for both.\nMarc Skinner's side struggled in the early months of the season but have surged into second place ahead of Arsenal and Manchester City. It is no coincidence that their revival has come as Terland has hit top form.\n1. Khadija Shaw (Man City)\nThese rankings wouldn't be complete without Manchester City's Khadija Shaw. Despite some injury setbacks, she leads the Golden Boot race with 11 goals and is firmly on track to finish as the WSL's top scorer for a second consecutive season.\nEven with City stumbling in their title race, and top three pursuit, Shaw remains simply unstoppable. One of the most prolific strikers in women's football, she is deserving of every accolade that may come her way.",
