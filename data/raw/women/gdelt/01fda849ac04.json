Formerly referred to as the \"Friends of\" Accounts, Excellence Funds allow your gift to be specifically designated for a particular sports program. Any gift to a specific Excellence Fund will count towards your priority points total and can increase your priority point rank.\nMustang Excellence Funds are used to benefit or enhance the specific program's greatest need for that particular year. As an example, recruiting needs for a particular year may exceed a particular sport's budgeted dollars. The program's Excellence Fund could supplement those costs and maximize competitive recruiting opportunities. Excellence funds are also applied to supplement team travel, special equipment purchases, or a variety of other unforeseen operational expenses.\nFor specific information on a program's Excellence Fund, please contact the Mustang Club office at (214) SMU-CLUB (768-2582).\nGive to Friends of SMU Libraries Today\nThe Friends of SMU Libraries endowment fund was established in 1992 to secure a permanent source of funds to enhance the budgets of the SMU Libraries, to allow the Friends of SMU Libraries to provide continuous support not solely dependent on membership dues and to provide the staff necessary to support its activities.

Safety reviews confirmed significant wear and raised concerns about performance and increased injury risk. The new field was replaced in summer 2025 and includes a shock-absorbing turf pad that reduces the risk of concussions as well as joint injuries. The new turf field is designed for a 15 year lifespan and should be in use until 2040, making it a smart investment in both player safety and facility longevity.\nWe humbly request your consideration in supporting the Crum Lacrosse Field Replacement Campaign. Your gift, whether large or small, will make a lasting impact on the wellbeing and success of SMU students.\nNaming opportunities begin at $10,000.
