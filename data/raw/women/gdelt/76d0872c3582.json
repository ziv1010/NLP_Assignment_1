The Lioness, 38, is currently taking part in the BBC Saturday night favourite alongside professional partner Carlos Gu, and the sports star has consistently placed highly on the leader board.\nBut now, it's been revealed that she actually knew one of the previous winners rather well, and they lived next door to each other at one point, although it has been described as a \"complete coincidence \" that she ended up on the show as well.\nComedian Chris McCausland made an appearance on Friday's edition of ITV's Lorraine to promote his memoir Keep Laughing, and stand-in host Christine Lampard asked him who he thinks could walk off with the Glitterball Trophy this year, almost a year on from when he made history as the first blind contestant, and winner, of the programme.\nExplaining to the Loose Women star that the footballer is the whole point of what the show is about given her progress, he said: \"Karen Carney is what the show is about. She's coming in, learning, had her ups and downs, she's really thriving. Me and Karen, also, completely coincidentally, were next door neighbours for quite a while and we met during lockdown.\n\"We had the same communal garden, so I think to have two consecutive Strictly winners from the same road will put the house prices up!\" Chris and his professional Dianne Buswell won a BAFTA for their performance that was set to You'll Never Walk Alone, and the CBeebies star insisted that his victory on the BBC show was a complete surprise to him.\nHe said: \"Listen, you can say reigning champion of Strictly, it comes and goes, doesn't' it? But honestly, what me and Dianne did is so bananas to me. No one was more surprised than I was, and I talk about it at the end of the book, but it's the most of anything I have ever been.\"\nIt comes just hours after Karen opened up about the mental health struggles she has endured in the past, which came about when she signed for US football team Chicago Red Stars in 2009 but had to take time off shortly after following a knee operation.\nWhile recovering from her operation, Karen said she became addicted to sleeping pills and began self-harming. \"I was in a pretty bad way,\" she said. \"I think that has been the hardest thing I've ever had to overcome.\" The football star said her coach Emma Hayes urged her to return to the UK even though she had another year left on her contract.\n\"I came back purely to… save my life,\" Karen told The Guardian. She said her friends helped her get out of the dark place she had found herself in - and she eventually ended her career on a high, becoming the third most-capped England player in history, with 144 appearances for the Lionesses across four World Cups, four European Championships and the London 2012 Olympics.\nSince retiring from football, she has become one of the UK's most respected pundits, working across TNT Sports and ITV. Then in 2022, she chaired the UK government's landmark review into the future of women's football. She was awarded an MBE in 2017 and an OBE in 2024.\nHowever, her career as a pundit hasn't been without its challenges, as she revealed the impact that social media comments had on her. As a football player, she had already been on the receiving end of horrific abuse with posts wishing \"cancer, leukaemia and rape\" on her.\nBut in December 2020, Karen decided to delete her Twitter (now called X) account after receiving thousands of abusive and sexist message following comments she made about Leeds United. She had praised Leeds while working on Amazon Prime during their 5-0 win against West Brom but said she was concerned they could \"blow up at the end of the season.\"\nShe added: \"I actually think they got promoted because of Covid in terms of it gave them a bit of respite.\" Close to tears, Karen told The Guardian: \"That crushed my confidence. It floored me as a human, completely floored me.\n\"I've never got over it. I'm more emotional about that than what I dealt with in America. I've not dealt with this.\" She added the online abuse felt \"like the whole world was caving in on me.\"\nShe continued: \"I've never experienced anything like it.\" However, she has vowed to continue commenting on the men's games, as she described her love of football as \"the greatest gift\" that was ever given to her. Following the abuse, however, she said she is hyper-vigilant and does a lot of research and prepares beforehand to avoid making any mistake - and she restricts who can comment on her Instagram posts.\nKaren said she feels her Strictly journey has been \"rebuilding\" her as she has been met with so much \"positivity\" which has left her feeling \"overwhelmed\" over the past few weeks. She also praised Carlos for helping her feel confident during her journey, saying he is \"unapologetically himself\" which encourages her to do her best and be herself. On Saturday, they will take to the dancefloor for a Couples Choice to Lady Gaga's Born This Way.\nIf you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.
