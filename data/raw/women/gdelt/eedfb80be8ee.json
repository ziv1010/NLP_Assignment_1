FIFA president Gianni Infantino in 2023 set a target of equal prize money for men and women at their next World Cups — the next women's tournament is scheduled for 2027 in Brazil.\nThe Club World Cup, controversially expanded from seven teams to 32 and shoehorned into the soccer calendar last summer, had a total prize fund of $1 billion. Chelsea won the top prize of up to $125 million for a tournament that faced fierce resistance from players and leagues and drew sparse crowds for some matches.\nFIFA has a different distribution model for the national team and club tournaments, with the disparity in prize money reflecting factors such as clubs with higher wage costs than national teams.\nBeyond prize money, further funds are put toward development of soccer globally.\nInfantino said the World Cup will be “groundbreaking in terms of its financial contribution to the global football community.”\nWorld soccer's governing body approved the prize money at a meeting of its council in Doha. FIFA in March projected revenue for its current four-year cycle through 2026 at $13 billion, up from $7.5 billion for 2019-22.\nEach of the 48 national federations at the expanded 2026 World Cup will receive $1.5 million for preparation costs and $9 million for participating in the group stage, the same as for the 2022 tournament.\nTeams advancing to the new round of 32 get $11 million and those reaching the round of 16 receive $15 million. Nations reaching the quarterfinals are paid $19 million, the fourth-place team $27 million, the third-place team $29 million and the final loser $33 million.\nIncluding participation fees, FIFA will distribute $727 million to the 48 federations.\nEach federation decides what to pay its players. The French sports daily L’Equipe reported France players were in line for a bonus of $586,000 by their federation if they won the trophy in 2022. France was ultimately beaten by Argentina in the final.\nThe U.S. Soccer Federation’s 2022 collective bargaining agreements with the unions for its men’s and women’s national teams call for prize money for men in 2026 and women in 2027 to be pooled together, and 80% of the money to be distributed among the players.\nSports Writer Ronald Blum in New York contributed to this report.\nJames Robson is at https://x.com/jamesalanrobson\nsoccer: /hub/soccer\nThis article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.",
