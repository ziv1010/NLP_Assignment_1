Both of them had accessorized with large rings with the former New England Patriots coach wearing one on every finger except for his thumb and Hudson sporting only one.\nOn Instagram, the NFL’s official Instagram account shared a zoomed-in photo of the pair’s hands, claiming: “Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson on the red carpet rocking Bill’s Super Bowl rings.”\nHowever, Hudson later debunked the claim, reposting the photo on her Instagram Story with a tag for the Bridgewater State University cheerleading team, indicating that she was actually wearing her Cheerleading National Championship ring.\nIn 2021 Hudson’s college cheerleading team was named NCA Collegiate Champions, which she highlights in her Instagram bio.\nThe couple, who are separated by nearly 50 years in age, were also the target of Snoop Dogg’s opening monologue.\n“I’ve been a football fan for a long, long time,” he said. “I remember back when the Cowboys was good. I remember back when the Chiefs was bad. And I remember — what was it? Bill Belichick’s girlfriend wasn’t even born yet.”\nThe couple appeared to take the joke in good humor as cameras panned over to show them laughing.\nTMZ first reported that Belichick and Hudson were dating back in June 2024. A source told the outlet at the time that the couple met on a flight from Boston to Florida in 2021. According to TMZ, the pair exchanged numbers and remained in contact over the years.\nIn December, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill announced that Belichick would be the school’s head football coach for the next five years.\n“We know that college athletics is changing, and those changes require new and innovative thinking,” the school’s director of athletics, Bubba Cunningham said in a press release at\nHudson celebrated her boyfriend’s new role by sharing a photo of the announcement on her Instagram Story, captioned: “We are on to Chapel Hill!!!”\nHer caption was a nod to Belichick’s famous 2014 press conference. At the time, he was coaching the Patriots, who had just lost to the Kansas City Chiefs. As reporters pressed him about the loss, Belichick repeatedly deflected, saying, “We’re on to Cincinnati,” five times. The Patriots ultimately went on to win the Super Bowl that season.\nBelichick had previously dated Linda Holliday for 16 years before they broke up in September 2023. Throughout his career with the Patriots, Holliday was seen supporting her then-partner on the sidelines of the football field. She also previously worked as the president and executive director of the Bill Belichick Foundation.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments",
