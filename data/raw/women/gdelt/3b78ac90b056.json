  "body_text": "Chelsea's head of women's football Green leaves club\n- Published\nPaul Green has left his role as Chelsea's head of women's football after 13 years at the Women's Super League club.\nGreen worked closely with former manager Emma Hayes, helping her deliver five successive WSL titles and reach a first Women's Champions League final.\nHe acted as interim manager in Hayes' absence in 2022 when she had emergency hysterectomy surgery, and has led recruitment across a number of successful transfer windows.\nThe club said Green \"played a significant role in the development and growth of the women's programme\" and \"contributed to the establishment of strong foundations and the evolution of Chelsea Women into one of the leading teams in the domestic and European game\".\nChelsea have won 19 trophies during Green's spell at the club, but it is believed his role started to change when the women's team was restructured in 2024.\nCo-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley have become increasingly involved with the decision-making on the women's side, and have already taken steps to shape the future of the club.\nLast week, Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor signed a new contract keeping her at the club until 2030.\nThat came days after she voiced her frustration at their recruitment in the summer transfer window, highlighting injuries and a lack of squad depth as one of the reasons Chelsea have fallen nine points adrift of WSL leaders Manchester City.\nSome fans had expressed concern over Bompastor's tactics, despite the Frenchwoman leading Chelsea to an unbeaten domestic treble in her debut season in charge, but the timing of her contract extension was a strong statement from the club.\nHowever, Green's departure comes as a shock given he has been a stalwart of the club's structure for more than a decade, and hugely successful in his position.\nIt will lead to further questions about Chelsea's direction and whether there is disharmony within the club.",
