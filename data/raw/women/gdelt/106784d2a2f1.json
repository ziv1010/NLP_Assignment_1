  "body_text": "Arsenal Women have been drawn against Belgian side O.H Leuven Women in the playoff round of the UEFA Women’s Champions League.\nThe Gunners will be aiming to keep their title defence alive as they prepare for another important European test this season.\nRenée Slegers’ side finished fifth in their group stage standings, which forced them into the playoff round.\nThey ended the group phase just one place and one point short of automatic qualification for the quarter finals.\nDespite missing out on direct progress, Arsenal showed strong form throughout the group stage. The North London club recorded four wins and suffered two defeats during the group stage campaign.\nThat return was enough to keep their European journey alive, but not enough to avoid the extra hurdle.\nArsenal lifted their second Women’s Champions League title in the 2024/25 season after beating Barcelona Femení in the final. That victory confirmed their status among the top sides in European women’s football.\nNow, they face the task of repeating that success while navigating a more difficult route this season.\nPlayoff clash with familiar opponents\nThe Gunners are already familiar with their upcoming opponents, Leuven Women, having faced them in the final game of their group stage this season.\nThat meeting ended in a comfortable 3-0 win for the English side, a result that helped Arsenal secure fifth place in the table.\nHowever, previous results will count for nothing once the playoff matches begin. Both sides will start level as they battle for a place in the quarter-finals.\nLeuven will be hoping to cause an upset and end Arsenal’s hopes of retaining the trophy. Arsenal, on the other hand, will aim to use their experience at this level to control the tie.\nThe first leg of the playoff will see the Gunners travel away on 09 February. They will then return home for the second leg on 16 February.\nChelsea tie awaits if Arsenal progress\nShould Arsenal come through the playoff round, a major test could be waiting next. The winner of this tie will face Chelsea Women in the quarter-finals.\nA clash between the two English sides would add extra pressure to the title defence. Chelsea remain one of the strongest teams in the competition and are well acquainted with Arsenal.",
