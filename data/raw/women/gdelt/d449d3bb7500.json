In the preview, Barr declared “privilege kills and bliss is ignorance” in a tangent about what she learned while everyone was in quarantine.\n“Privilege is what ruins lives when you start thinking, you know, that the world needs to be pretty for you. Well, it don’t, right?” Barr said. “Just because you’ve got a degree in gender studies that don’t mean shit. You’re not going to get a job no place. You can’t even get a job at Ho Ho’s Donuts.”\nThis segued into a bit on parenting, where Barr riffed on her adult children and her general exasperation with growing old.\nBarr — who proudly identifies as a socialist but has found refuge on the right since the backlash to her tweet — went on to joke that she maybe should have remained a Democrat so she could abort her “liberal” adult children:\nYes, I have three daughters. I told you they’re very liberal. But they’re in their late 40’s and 50’s. Three daughters in menopause that’s when you know you’re old.\n(LAUGHTER)\nFor God’s sake that’s when you know you’re old, right?\n(LAUGHTER)\nI can’t believe how fast it went to. Oh my God. And they tell me, you know, the things they come up with now. They’re like ‘Mom, the doctor — they want us to take testosterone for our symptoms. They’re trying to give everybody crazy ass hormones from the time they’re two all the way up.\nGiving women testosterone to treat their perimenopause and saying — I’m like great, now you’ll be lifting weights and watching football. I wouldn’t take it if I was you. That’s just asking for trouble.\nYou know because your IQ is going to decrease by half and then you’re going just start peeing on toilet seats for no good reason whatsoever. It’s just — I don’t think it’s good.\n(APPLAUSE)\nBut I kind of — I kind of think maybe I shouldn’t have left the Democrat Party so early, what with their full-term abortion stuff they’re doing these days because I’m thinking, ‘Hey, another couple months they’re probably going to move right into I’d be able to abort these bitches by the time they’re 50.'”\nWatch above.\nNew: The Mediaite One-Sheet \"Newsletter of Newsletters\"\nYour daily summary and analysis of what the many, many media newsletters are saying and reporting.
