  "body_text": "Wave make splash signing of Brazilian star Ludmila\n(Photo credit: Peter Aiken-Imagn Images)\nStar forward Ludmila is headed from the Chicago Stars to the San Diego Wave for a lucrative transfer fee.\nThe clubs on Tuesday announced the deal that will see the Wave pay an $800,000 transfer fee to Chicago to acquire the Brazilian international.\nLudmila's transfer could be worth as much as $1 million when all is said and done. Chicago will receive up to an additional $200,000 if certain conditions are met.\nOnly one other intraleague transfer in NWSL history cost more: Gotham FC paid $1.25 million to the North Carolina Courage to acquire midfielder Jaedyn Shaw in September.\nLudmila, 31, came to the NWSL in July 2024 when she signed with the Stars. She'd previously spent the bulk of her career in Spain with Atletico Madrid (2017-24).\nIn 31 games over a year and a half with Chicago, Ludmila recorded 13 goals and one assist. She broke the league record for the fastest hat trick last season, scoring three goals in 10:09 of game time when the Stars tied the Courage 3-3 in August.\n'I scored my first NWSL goal against San Diego and always was a team I admired. I loved the supporters, the energy of the team, and the vibes of the city when I visited. I'm very happy to be part of this Club's history,' Ludmila said in a news release. 'From the moment Cami and the organization showed interest in me, my focus was clear. I wanted to play for this team and this city. I didn't come here just to play. I came to give my best and fight to win trophies. I'm very excited to show my football in front of all the supporters and score many goals in these colors.'\nLudmila has earned 63 caps with the Brazil women's national team and scored six goals in international competition. She competed in two Olympic Games and the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n'We're very excited to come to an agreement to bring Ludmila to San Diego. She's a player who not only brings a great deal of talent, but also complements the strengths of our existing roster,' Wave sporting director and general manager Camille Ashton said in a statement. 'Her versatility allows her to operate in multiple attacking roles, giving our coaches more tactical options in different game situations. Her creativity and movement will enhance our ability to break down defenses, and we're confident she will be a valuable asset to the Club's success moving forward.'\n--Field Level Media",
