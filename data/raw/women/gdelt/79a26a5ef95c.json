The actor, now 56, was just 16 years old at the time. His character has become well known for being the most married in EastEnders history, with six marriages to five women.\nWoodyatt is the longest-running male actor in the show's history, and has a Lifetime Achievement Award from the British Soap Awards. Recently someone shared a picture of Woodyatt in Albert Square and said: \"This man's been shot, thrown in front of a car and blasted through the air from an explosion... Just another day in the life of Ian Beale.\"\nSo, with all his achievements and playing one of the most popular characters on the show, you would expect that he is earning big bucks, but fans have been shocked to learn his wages.\nREAD MORE: BBC EastEnders' Adam Woodyatt says co-star 'shaken up' over mistake in live sceneIt is claimed that Adam earns £260,000 a year, according to old reports. Recently in a tweet @PiggyBing was shocked after learning how high Woodyatt's alleged wages are, as she said: \"Do you know Ian Beale (well, the actor who plays him) earns £260,000 a year?! Blows my mind that.\"\nSoap fans rushed to comment. \"He deserves that more than MP's deserve £90K, to be fair,\" said one. \"Finest actor of our generation,\" commented another.\nAnother questioned: \"Why do they pay him that much? They could pay him 80k, it's not like there would be much more than panto open to him if he left. Bet he's got a fat pension too. I don't blame him though, I'd happily take 260k to pretend to be Ian Beale.\"\nOne other asked: \"How can they justify that? Is it like football? If you don't pay the obscene wages, then someone else will... Imagine losing Ian Beale to Corrie on a free transfer?\"\nOne other added: \"To be fair though that's not actually that much. Like don’t get me wrong I don’t enjoy being forced to pay for it. But the guy has been playing him since the 80s.\"\nThat figure places Woodyatt behind several of his co-stars, despite his achievements on the show.\nHow do other actor's wages compare?\nIt has been widely reported that Danny Dyer, who famously played Mick Carter, was earning up to £249,000 in 2017. Steve McFadden - the iconic face of Phil Mitchell - earns around £300,000 annually. Meanwhile June Brown, who plays Dot Branning, was once offered a £300,000 contract to remain on the show until March 2018.\nPlus, Rory Jennings, who played Craig Dixon on the soap for a short stint in 2007, appeared how the pay works while appearing on The Fellas Podcast. He said: \"It worked out that I was on £1,000 per episode, but this is way back in the day. But then you had the Sunday repeat - the omnibus on Sunday...and you would get 80% of your fee again.\"\nThe podcast host summarised that Rory would have been earning around £6,000 every week.\nDo you agree?
