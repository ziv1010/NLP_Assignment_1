We came here from from Ukraine, and Matilda was my first born in Australia. And I thought that Matilda is the most Australian name that can ever exist.\"\n.\nA man will appear in court today after he allegedly made antisemitic threats during a flight from Bali to Sydney.\nAustralian Federal Police officers arrested the 19 year old after he landed at Sydney International Airport and charged him with threatening force or violence against members of groups.\n.\nThe federal government says it intends to strengthen migration laws to ensure people with antisemitic views cannot visit or emigrate to Australia.\nAssistant Immigration Minister Matt Thistlethwaite says the review of migration policies is part of the government's response to Sunday's attack at Bondi, with a full response likely to be released in the coming days and weeks.\nThe government has been accused of failing to address antisemitism, despite having received a report from its special envoy several months ago.\nIt was suggested on the Today show this morning that the PM was not welcome at the Bondi victims' funerals as a result - and the Assistant Minister has told Nine that it's a difficult situation.\n\"We certainly respect the wishes of the families. I understand that the Jewish community is hurting at the moment and they're grieving. And I want them to know we're here to support them.\"\n.\nAuthorities are seeking urgent clarification of reports that an Australian man has been killed fighting Russian forces in Ukraine.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says consular officials are assisting the man's family while they wait for the report to be verified.\nA Telegram post in a pro-Russian channel said the man had been killed by Russian forces near Pokrovsk in Ukraine on December 10.\n.\nFive people have been arrested during a protest by pro-Palestinian demonstrators outside the Ministry of Justice in London.\nMetropolitan Police have declared they intend to take tougher action against people who use placards and chants to target the Jewish community.\nChief Commissioner, Mark Rowley, says recent violent incidents have changed the context around such protests - and officers will now be more assertive.\n\"The words and chants used, especially in protests, matter and have real world consequences... We know communities are concerned about placards and chants such as 'Globalise the Intifada' and those using it at future protests or in a targeted way, should expect the Met or Greater Manchester Police to take immediate action.\"\n.\nOfficials in the US Department of Justice are reportedly considering a plan to take legal action against the prosecutors who pursued cases against the January 6 rioters.\nFormer January 6 defence lawyer Ed Martin is said to have formed a working group that has held talks with at least three people charged in the Capitol attack since Trump’s inauguration.\nThose former defendants have urged officials to pursue charges against their prosecutors.\nOne of those prosecutors - Matthew Beckwith - says he fears this is part of a campaign of retaliation - and an attempt to rewrite history.\n\"I'm under no illusion that anyone needs to like their prosecutor. That's a very natural thing for you know, a defendant to not like their prosecutor to not like what's happening to them. I understand that. For that to suddenly be coming from inside the Department of Justice and to be for this extraordinary example of political violence to be normalised and legitimated, that was what was most shocking to me.\"\n.\nThe broadcasting of the iconic Academy Awards is moving online.\nThe US broadcaster ABC will continue to broadcast the annual ceremony through 2028, a year that will mark the 100th Oscars ceremony.\nBut then YouTube will stream the Oscars from the following year in what is being called a seismic shift for one of television's marquee events.\nThe Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences says YouTube will effectively be the home to all things Oscars, including red-carpet coverage, the Governors Awards and the Oscar nominations announcement.\n.\nTo sport and in football news,\nMatildas skipper Sam Kerr is back to her big-game best.\nShe has scored the winning goal in Chelsea's match against Wolfsburg, with the 2 to 1 result sending her side into the Women's Champions League quarter-finals.\nKerr has also become the first Australian, and just the second Chelsea player, to notch 20 Champions League goals with her header in Germany.",
