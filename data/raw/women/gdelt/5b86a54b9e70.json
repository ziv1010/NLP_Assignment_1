  "body_text": "We are delighted to announce the signing of Kyra Cooney-Cross on a permanent deal.\nThe 21-year-old Australian international midfielder joins us from Hammarby IF in Sweden.\nKyra will wear the No.32 jersey here at Arsenal.\nBorn in Herston, Australia on 15 February 2002, Kyra began her professional career at Melbourne Victory, where she made her competitive debut at the age of just 15.\nKyra went on to make 44 appearances for Melbourne Victory across two spells with the club, either side of a season-long stint at Western Sydney Wanderers in the 2019/20 season. She won the Australian league title in 2020/21 and 2021/22 with Melbourne Victory.\nA move to Hammarby IF in the Swedish Damallsvenskan followed in 2022, with Kyra making 30 appearances for the club and helping the team to win the Swedish Cup in the 2022/23 season.\nAt international level, Kyra made her Australia debut versus Denmark in June 2021 and has now amassed 39 caps for her country. She played a key role in Australia’s run to the semi-finals of the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup, starting all seven of the Matildas’ matches as they finished fourth in front of home supporters.\n“I’m so excited to join this club,” said Kyra. “Arsenal just felt right as soon as I heard about the interest. I’m really looking forward to experiencing the atmosphere at Emirates Stadium in front of a big crowd for our first game there this season. I can’t wait to get started and help us achieve something big together.”\nHead Coach Jonas Eidevall said: “Kyra is one of the best young players in world football and we are delighted to have brought her to Arsenal. Her passing ability and explosiveness allow her to affect games in a way you rarely see from such a young player, so we firmly believe she will be an excellent addition to our midfield, now and in the future.”\nHead of Women’s Football Clare Wheatley said: “We are so pleased to have brought Kyra to our club. At the age of 21, she already has impressive experience at domestic and international level and we believe she has huge potential for future development. Together with our supporters, we welcome Kyra to the Arsenal family and look forward to seeing her play in the red and white.”\nThe transfer is subject to the completion of regulatory processes.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
