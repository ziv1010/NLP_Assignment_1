  "body_text": "Arsenal star Kai Havertz says he will become the ‘biggest Tottenham fan ever’ when Spurs face Manchester City on Tuesday night.\nHavertz helped Arsenal secure a 1-0 victory at Manchester United on Sunday as the Gunners look to clinch their first Premier League title since 2004.\nArsenal are desperate for their north London rivals Tottenham to do them a huge favour when they host Pep Guardiola’s men in two days’ time.\nMikel Arteta’s side are top of the table on 86 points and have just one top-flight fixture left, which comes against Everton at the Emirates next week.\nCity, meanwhile, host West Ham on the final day after their trip to Tottenham – with the reigning champions just one point behind Arsenal at the moment.\nHavertz is praying that City will drop points and told Sky Sports: ‘I’m going to be the biggest fan of Tottenham ever! We are going to be, so let’s hope for the best.’\nHis teammate Leandro Trossard, who scored the winner against United, was asked for his own thoughts on the Spurs v City game and added: ‘You never know, it could be [enjoyable].\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘We can only hope and we have done our job and that’s the only thing we could have done. We just need to enjoy this and look forward to next week.’\nMeanwhile, Arsenal legend Paul Merson has promised to get a Tottenham tattoo if they pull off a shock result against City – but Arteta gave a more coy response when asked if he would be wearing ‘Spurs pyjamas’ on Tuesday night.\n‘We will certainly be watching the game,’ Arteta said. ‘We watch all the games. We need the result. It’s football, there are always possibilities.’\nSpeaking more generally about Arsenal’s win over United, Arteta added: ‘We know how tough it is, that’s why we have only won twice in 21 matches here.\n‘We started the game really well, the goal affected us with the things we had to do on the ball.\n‘Playing backwards, playing safe, it wasn’t progressing our play. We started to give our balls away and it was open. But the way we defended, we didn’t give away much at all.\nMore Trending\n‘The attitude of the whole team, the way Kai was chasing people all the time, the discipline and creating habits that were super important were very good today. It’s a collective thing.\n‘We are really happy to win, especially what we did in the second half. That’s another step the team has to make, to be even more dominant. But it was high stake today, the same at Spurs, great credit.\n‘You don’t have margins for error, these are big teams that make things difficult against you and you have will to win, that’s emotional. Today we wanted to open the door, last day in front of our people, our families will be there, let’s create the most beautiful day together.’\nMORE: Marc Skinner urges Mary Earps to stay after Man Utd win FA Cup final\nMORE: Man Utd thump Tottenham to clinch Women’s FA Cup for first time ever",
