Smith started his explanation by admitting he forgot that cameras would capture the moment.\n“Actually, I didn’t even know they had a picture of that until we got in the locker room after the game,” Smith said with a smile, “and then all my teammates were showing it to me and everybody was posting it on Twitter.”\nBut why did Smith do it?\n“All Michigan fans were right there at the bottom, so we out there warming up and they're talking, talking cash money or whatever they were saying, so I was like, ‘OK, I’ll score. I got something for ‘em.’ I scored. I ran up and I flipped ‘em off.”\nSmith said Ohio State’s coaches “got on me a little bit” for his celebration, especially when he made the image of him flipping off Michigan fans his profile picture on X. Still, the coaches let him keep the profile picture — briefly.\n“When I made it my profile picture, they was like, ‘You can keep it up for a little bit, but you got to take it down,” Smith said with a laugh.\n“That’s legendary,” Rencher said.\n“It was,” Smith said.\nYes, it was!\nI agree!\nSmith and Rencher discussed many other topics in the episode. I included some of the hits below, including Smith’s Ohio State Mount Rushmore, what makes the Buckeyes special and more.\nOn his Ohio State Mount Rushmore\n“One guy would be Archie Griffin, two-time Heisman winner. You got to throw Eddie George in there, he won a Heisman. Troy Smith was, too, he a Heisman winner… Imma go Orlando Pace.”\nWhen asked who he would pick from the newer generations of Ohio State football players, Smith said Braxton Miller. “Everybody love Braxton Miller here. He was crazy.”\nOn his favorite touchdown from this season\n“I’d say my touchdown against Team Up North, Michigan. I was ready. That was probably my best one. … It was good. I mean, we hadn’t beat them guys in four years. For us to go up there and do what we did to them guys, it was something special. We got our Gold Pants. Something special, for sure.”\nSmith added that he made a “promise” to Buckeye Nation that he would beat Michigan for the rest of his Ohio State career, and now he has to “stand on it” in 2026. “I got to hold my word. That’s what I gotta do.”\nOn what makes Ohio State special\n“The people. The people that’s in the program. We got a great head coach, Coach Ryan Day. We got a good strength and conditioning coach, Coach Mick Marotti. We just got a great staff. The people around us is pretty special at what they do, so I feel like that’s what make Ohio State special is the people.”\nEARN YOUR (SCARLET) STRIPES. With Davison Igbinosun and Lorenzo Styles Jr. entering the NFL draft and Aaron Scott Jr. and Bryce West entering the transfer portal, Ohio State’s cornerback depth looks thin this offseason.\nWhile there’s still plenty of time for the Buckeyes to bolster their depth behind Jermaine Mathews Jr. and Devin Sanchez — and I fully expect them to — Ohio State may need to lean on top-125 prospects Jay Timmons and Jordan Thomas to contribute in year one.\nFreshmen playing rotational roles can be a scary proposition at the college level, but Timmons and Thomas may not be ordinary frosh. Timmons — the son of former Florida State and Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Lawrence Timmons — checks in at 5-foot-11, 190 pounds, runs a 10.9-second 100 meters and boasts a nearly 21-foot broad jump. Thomas, meanwhile, brings a 6-foot, 190-pound frame, a jaw-dropping 78-inch wingspan (!) and a natural nose for the football.\nCould be pound-for-pound the best overall football player in this cycle@CharlesPower explains why Ohio State commit Jay Timmons is now a 5 for @Rivals\n— Josh Newberg (@josh_newberg) November 21, 2025\nMore rankings updates: https://t.co/HoQZiM5Rom pic.twitter.com/AO3hPBUtj7\nThomas put that skill set on full display Saturday at the Navy All-American Bowl, which also featured Ohio State signees Chris Henry Jr., Jerquaden Guilford and Sam Greer. According to Rivals’ Chad Simmons and Cody Bellaire, Thomas was one of the event’s top three performers alongside USC signees Luke Wafle and Jaimeon Winfield.\nthankful to be a captain and a top performer at the Navy All-American Game God is great!!!@ryandaytime @OGWalt_ @OhioStateFB @AABonNBC @Rivals @SWiltfong_ @adamgorney @247Sports @TomLoy247 @BrianDohn247 @On3sports @ChadSimmons_ @TheUCReport https://t.co/HKTuTetE3o\n— Jordan Thomas (@jordanthomas_21) January 11, 2026\nA top-three performer and a captain?\nYeah. I’ll be watching Thomas’ career with great interest.\nWAIT… WHAT NOW? You all see this Marcus Freeman news?\nIn one of the more bizarre stories of the college football season, The South Bend Tribune reported Sunday that Freeman was accused of battery in a police report filed Jan. 3 following an incident at his son’s high school wrestling match.\nAccording to the Tribune, the alleged incident occurred after Freeman’s son, Vinny, lost a match. As Freeman and Penn wrestling coach Brad Harper escorted Vinny out of the gym, New Prairie High School assistant wrestling coach Chris Fleeger allegedly began to “exchange words” with the group.\nExclusive: a police report has been filed against Notre Dame football coach Marcus Freeman, stemming from an incident at a high school wrestling invite last weekend. More details here: https://t.co/czdXBsLLxK\n— Austin Hough (@AustinRHough) January 11, 2026\nOnce in the hallway, Fleeger and Freeman’s wife, Joanna, started shouting at each other before local law enforcement and Mishawaka school officials separated the groups, according to the Tribune.\nNotre Dame shared the following statement about the alleged incident on Sunday: “Vinny Freeman, head coach Marcus Freeman’s son, was verbally accosted during and after his wrestling match by a local wrestling coach. Marcus and Joanna Freeman intervened and removed Vinny from the situation. At no point did Coach Freeman physically engage with anyone. We believe that the police report, which includes video evidence, fully exonerates Coach Freeman and makes clear these accusations are totally unfounded.”\nNo charges are expected against Freeman, according to ESPN’s Heather Dinich, so this situation should disappear sooner rather than later. Still, what a bizarre story involving the former Ohio State linebacker and current Notre Dame head coach.\nOLYMPIC VILLAGE. Ohio State’s Olympic sports had an epic weekend.\nFirst, Ohio State men’s hockey upset No. 2 Michigan State thanks to a go-ahead goal from captain Davis Burnside. Freshman goaltender Sam Hillebrandt also had 26 saves in his first-career win.\nAnother look at last nights gwg pic.twitter.com/2EP4fq1zF8\n— Ohio State Men's Hockey (@OhioStateMHKY) January 11, 2026\nThen, Ohio State wrestling blanked No. 23 Indiana 45-0 at the Covelli Center. The No. 2 Buckeyes recorded three decisions, two major decisions, two technical falls and three pins in the win, which improved the team’s dual record to 12-0.\nThe Buckeyes weren't messing around\n— NCAA Men's Wrestling (@NCAAWrestling) January 11, 2026\nNo. 2 @wrestlingbucks defeats No. 23 Indiana, 45-0. #NCAAWrestling pic.twitter.com/vfgXQDqLX9\nAnd last but certainly not least, Ohio State women’s basketball took down No. 8 Maryland on the road, 89-76, for its best win of the season to date. Jaloni Cambridge led the Buckeyes with 28 points after becoming the fourth player in program history to score 40+ points earlier in the week when Ohio State beat Illinois, 78-69.\nFirst top win of the season\n— Ohio State Womens Basketball (@OhioStateWBB) January 12, 2026\n: https://t.co/kVNweSduL0\n: https://t.co/0UyyCmWkdC#GoBucks pic.twitter.com/LWRX9oKZTR\nGood stuff, Buckeyes! Good stuff!\nNEW DUBCAST.
