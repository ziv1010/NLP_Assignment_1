But perhaps none is as important, or meaningful, as the observance of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Since the American Cancer Society helped create the campaign back in 1985, October has marked the month we focus on raising awareness of the disease, which is the second-most commonly diagnosed cancer in women (behind skin cancer).\nOne way to support those battling the illness and increase attention around it is to pass along one or more of the following Breast Cancer Awareness quotes. Many of these thought-provoking, encouraging and deeply moving words of wisdom are from famous women, like Sheryl Crow and Robin Roberts, who have faced their own breast cancer journeys and aim to empower those on the same path. Some quotes are from less well-known folks, or people who have watched loved ones fight breast cancer. All should help further understanding of the disease amongst those who don't have it, while providing comfort and inspiration to those that do.\nAccording to the National Breast Cancer Foundation, 1 in 8 U.S. women will develop breast cancer at some time during their lifetime. Anyone can get it, including young women and even men, but it predominately strikes middle-aged and older women. With an estimated 300,000-plus Americans facing an invasive breast cancer diagnosis this year alone, it's crucial that we all do our part to help get the word out about it. Sharing Breast Cancer Awareness quotes via social media, text, email or even in person is a great place to start.\nWant to do more to help a family member, friend, co-worker or neighbor with breast cancer? Consider lending a hand by cleaning their house, tidying up their yard, going grocery shopping for them, or whipping up a nutritious, homemade soup they can freeze until needed.\n- “Cancer survivors are blessed with two lives.
