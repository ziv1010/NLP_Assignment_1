  "body_text": "Raw recap & reactions (Jul. 21, 2025): Big dogs are barking\nNaomi causes drama, Dom is finally cleared, and Roman Reigns meets the new dog-faced, booty nephew in town on this week’s Monday Night Raw.\nThere’s a thing the kids say that I won’t say because I’m not one of them. Even if I were, I wouldn’t say it because when I was a kid, I went against the grain even if it was to my detriment. What can I say, I’m hardheaded. Anyway, there’s something they’d say Roman Reigns has that starts and ends with an A. Not just in the loud moments, like when his music hits and he walks to the ring rocking a pair of fresh Jordan 4s, but in the quieter moments when he needs to tell a story, like he did this week. Even more so when it involves weaving someone new into the tale like Bron Breakker.\nThis main event confrontation started with Paul Heyman being himself: He offered Roman Seth’s spot in the group! Seriously, with a straight face, he told his former Tribal Chief that since Seth is out of commission for a long time, this new crew is in the market for new leadership. All the while, there’s Bron looking like a rabid dog on a leash. He winced at every genuflect in Roman’s direction. He knew the plan and accepted the plan, but he clearly wasn’t onboard.\nSo there’s two things happening to focus on: Roman’s words once he tells Paul no, and Bron’s reaction to every word off Roman’s lips. Roman talked about his history with Paul but also insulted him. And Bron reacted to every diss lobbed in Paul E.’s direction. That gave Bron an emotional investment that he doesn’t have with the Bloodline saga. He wasn’t there for the beginning, he wasn’t there for the end. And, more importantly, he has no real history with the Tribal Chief. WWE addressed all of that when Roman “acknowledged” the similarities between he and Bron.\nThat’s a pretty easy dot to connect in the story. Roman sees Paul hitching his wagon to another young grappler with a hall of fame lineage. Said youngster also played football, harkens himself to a dog, and often finishes opponents with a Spear. My math isn’t always good but even I can do the addition there. Roman didn’t even get into all of that. Instead he stuck with the most pertinent piece of info that established a story and put Bron over: When Bron is running WWE one day, Paul will take all the credit for it.\nThat line piggybacks off Bron’s gauntlet performance and shows his position with Seth on the shelf. He’s the man now, at least as far as this group is concerned. It makes me wonder what happens in a world where Roman says yes to Paul’s insane offer, but that’s for alternate reality Marcus to write about.\nBron held his own on the mic against Roman. He didn’t have as much to work with nor was he as effortless, but he’ll get there. He was intense but stuck to general points: Roman’s old, he’s the future, WWE doesn’t need him anymore, this is his yard, etc. All that’s fine but it’s the conviction that carries Bron. I believe he believes everything he says. And he backs it up with action. Meaning even when Roman no sells him like he did here when he told Bron he didn’t hear a thing he said, it doesn’t hurt him because Bron’s violence will usually get the last word.\nJey Uso made the save once things got violent and it looked like a Tsunami might wash away the Island of Relevancy, which sets up the tag match at SummerSlam between Jey, Roman, Bron, and Bronson Reed. That’s the right call because there’s still time for a singles match with Bron and Roman. We’re not there yet but building to it methodically and intelligently, as they started here, will make that match worthwhile when it happens.\nAlbum Cuts\n- A couple standout moments from a match between Sheamus and Rusev that contained several. First? Sheamus losing his footing after going to the top rope yet still making lemonade after what could’ve been very sour lemons. Second? Rusev countering Sheamus’ Brogue Kick with a Powerbomb. Rusev caught a man Sheamus’ size in midair and Powerbombed him. Incredible. The match ended when Rusev’s tricks came back to haunt him. Like the last time they faced each other, Rusev needed the turnbuckle’s assistance. But unlike last time, Sheamus saw it coming and put Rusev’s face into the exposed metal. Rusev grabbed the shillelagh as a last ditch effort but it didn’t matter. Sheamus finally executed the Brogue Kick, which ended the match. This is obviously the second chapter of at least a three chapter story. When’s the rubber match?\n- Sigh. WWE’s preview of their new unscripted show is...an entirely scripted moment that they already released to fans shortly after the Royal Rumble. Remember when IShowSpeed replaced Tozawa at the Rumble? Yup, we saw that same thing just a few more seconds of it. You’d think a guy involved in the Curtain Call could expose the business-ah a bit better than that.\n- Triple threat tag matches are usually worthwhile. This one featuring New Day, LWO, and the Brothers Creed was no exception. The big development though? LWO wins despite El Grande Americano showing up to distract Dragon Lee. Why’d he do that? Besides the fact that he’s a jerk, El Grande didn’t appreciate Dragon getting in his face before the match. Dragon told the fake luchador that he is, in fact, a fake luchador. But he did so while Ludwig Kaiser cut an entire promo in Spanish, so props to him. LWO not only won but they pinned New Day, which sent the former champs into a tailspin wondering what they can do to change their fate and the tag team division. Enter Grayson Waller, who is a “free agent” now that A-Town Down Under officially went under with Austin Theory injured. Kofi Kingston & Xavier Woods weren’t exactly thrilled at the idea of adding him to New Day, but he could be the spark they need. Or do they have another third person in mind?\n- Weird way to break up A-Town Down Under, right?\n- Xavier made me cackle loud enough to wake my neighbors when he said the only thing that makes sense these days is AJ Styles being a janitor since he “should’ve been one from the start.”\n- Why is AJ a janitor you ask? Because he spent most of the episode surprising Dirty Dom. He dressed as a valet, a janitor, and a ring doctor when the Dirty one needed “medical attention” while Roxanne Perez & Raquel Rodriguez defended their tag championships against...Bayley & Lyra Valkyria? Yes, not a typo. Lyra thought it was weird too considering everything that popped off between them the past month. Bayley wanted the shot they never got at WrestleMania and is seemingly throwing all that dirty water under the bridge. And it almost worked out, despite Dirty Dom playing dirty. The reason Lyra & Bayley aren’t your new tag champs lies squarely on Becky Lynch’s shoulders.\n- Before the tag match commenced, Becky hit the ring with a promo aimed at Lyra. She did the heel thing where she reversed everything Lyra said about her and put it on her challenger. Lyra is the one hoarding opportunities. Lyra is the one holding other people back. She’s getting Intercontinental championship matches and tag team championship matches? Psh. How dare she! Lyra came out, accepted Becky’s stipulation that if she loses, she’ll never challenge Becky for this title again, while adding her own: No DQ, no count out, there must be a winner. Becky begrudgingly accepted and went for a sucker punch after telling Lyra to shake her hand. Lyra ducked the cheap shot and put Becky in the Manhandle Slam, which knocked The Man out of the ring as the tag match started.\n- Unbeknownst to anyone, she hid under the ring for most of the match and popped up to attack Lyra, which put Lyra out of commission when Bayley went for a tag, which led to Roxanne getting the win for her team. I loved all of this. The emotions felt real and earned, while the stories blended together rather seamlessly.\n- Dom vs. AJ at SummerSlam is official. Loved Adam Pearce being at his wits end after the tag match and forcing Dom to the medical office. Dom is fine, he attacked AJ from behind, and said he’d see him in Jersey. I’m almost sad this is ending soon because the comedy tickles me.\n- Before Chelsea Green and the Secret Hervice interfered (the right call), Stephanie Vaquer and IYO SKY rocked my world. Stunning match from two of my favorites doing it today, and a logical ending since neither woman can afford a loss at the moment. The chaos brought out the Women’s World champ Naomi, who got quickly dismissed. Then came Rhea Ripley to have IYO’s back against Chelsea and crew. The last image was Rhea, IYO, and Stephanie standing tall.\n- Sami Zayn, taped ribs and all, just wasn’t enough for Karrion Kross & Scarlett. Solid match that definitely made me feel for Sami because anyone fighting with taped up ribs will do that for me. But Sami just knows how to sell everything better. Karrion used Scarlett and a lead pipe to get the job done against a man who could barely breathe. Good heeling on his part and Sami is such a vulnerable face that it all came together well.\n- A bystander compared to the rest of the show and the last segment was CM Punk and GUNTHER. I didn’t hate it but it was just the two men in an opening promo segment that just lacked the emotion the rest of the night had in buckets. Considering the amount of time they have to build this championship match and the lack of familiarity between these two, that’s understandable.\nThis Raw hung together beautifully. It felt like a go home show rather than the penultimate show before a big event. Everything built to the ending with Roman addressing his former Wiseman, but they made sure to give Bron a big enough spotlight to make him important to the story. No complaints on my end for anything here. I’ll even give the opening segment a pass because they gotta start somewhere, right?\nWell done, boys and girls.\nWhat say you, Cagesiders?",
