  "body_text": "Uniquely able to explore the many nuances of life with hilarious excess and even absurdity while still delivering devastating and often poignant observations on humanity, relationships, and the state of society, comedy-drama series tend to provide stories that are defined by their complexity and layers. Public interest in such series has peaked only in recent decades, meaning many of the best comedy-dramas are shows that have aired in the last 20 years at most.\nRegardless of whether such series place their focus on relationships and human connection, explore the incomprehensible chaos of crime, or even set out to satirize the rich and powerful in spectacular fashion, each of these 10 series provide hilarity and dramatic heft in abundance. Unsurprisingly, given their astute genre-meshing and the depth it brings, many of these shows rank among the greatest television has ever seen.\n20 'Dead to Me' (2019–2022)\nCreated by Liz Feldman\nMacabre, murderous, and even moving when it wants to be, Dead to Me is an often gasp-inducing black comedy-drama about grief, loss, and lies. Jen (Christina Applegate) struggles to come to terms with the loss of her husband in a hit-and-run incident. Through her attendance at therapy and grief support groups, she befriends Judy (Linda Cardellini), a disturbed though duplicitous woman who is actually the driver responsible for the death of Jen’s husband.\nGranted, the series doesn’t always live up to the punch of its premise nor deliver on the prowess of its two stars, but it does strike a deft balance between exploiting the absurdity of its plot for laughs and finding powerful moments of drama in the complex and emotional journeys of its characters. Also implementing no small amount of suspense to the fold, Dead to Me is a striking comedy-drama that has a tendency to ensnare viewers in its twisted world of death, deceit, and devilish hilarity.\nDead to Me\n- Release Date\n- 2019 - 2022-00-00\n- Showrunner\n- Liz Feldman\n- Directors\n- Liz Feldman\n- Writers\n- Liz Feldman\n19 'Patriot' (2015–2018)\nCreated by Steven Conrad\nUsing its acidic black comedy and its venomous wit to brilliant effect as it otherwise runs as a political spy drama, Patriot is a refreshing spin on a favorite subgenre of television suspense that is as sublime as it is shocking. Intelligence officer (and aspiring folk musician) John Tavner (Michael Dorman) must forgo all safety measures and assume a non-official cover when he goes undercover as an industrial engineer in order to use his connections to manipulate the geopolitical sphere and prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear state.\nWhile the mission sees John thrust into the midst of many perilous and intense situations, Patriot is almost always willing to explore his heroics with a healthy dose of sardonic and cynical humor. Despite the fact that it spans just two seasons, Patriot marks a distinguished, albeit underappreciated, gem of mid-2010s television, a moody and meticulous series that offers a unique treat as a bitingly hilarious spy drama.\nPatriot\n- Release Date\n- 2015 - 2018-00-00\n- Network\n- Prime Video\n- Directors\n- Ted Griffin\n- Writers\n- Steven Conrad\nCast\n-\nChastity DotsonCarol\n-\nLawrence Lacroix\n-\nJulian RichingsPeter Icabod\n-\nTom Tavner\n18 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' (1997–2003)\nCreated by Joss Whedon\nWhile it may be best known for its blending of high school drama with fantasy, horror, and even science-fiction, Buffy the Vampire Slayer always had a certain knack for comedy as well. The iconic television series follows Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Geller), a teenage vampire slayer who must use her advanced powers to battle all manner of mythical evils while navigating the brutal social hierarchy of the schoolyard.\nIts spontaneous ability to juggle genres, and even shift between them, is one of Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s biggest strengths, enabling it to soar with intense dramatic episodes while also experimenting with comedy, as evinced by the Season 6 comedy-musical episode “One More, With Feeling.” The penchant for light-hearted fun and humor not only gave the series a greater appeal, but saw it thrive as one of the biggest and best cult series in television history. Even more than 20 years since its finale, it remains one of the most iconic shows the medium has ever seen.\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer\n- Release Date\n- 1997 - 2003\n- Network\n- The WB\n- Showrunner\n- Joss Whedon\n- Directors\n- Joss Whedon\nCast\n-\nBuffy Summers\n-\nNicholas BrendonAlexander Harris\n17 'The White Lotus' (2021–)\nCreated by Mike White\nA phenomenon of the 2020s that has only captivated more viewers with each of its three seasons thus far, The White Lotus has entranced millions with its satirizing of the wealthy through sheer absurdity and shock comedy. The anthology series sees each of its seasons take place over the course of a week in White Lotus luxury resort hotels in different parts of the world, with the lives and woes of guests and staff gradually entwining as each day of their paradisiacal getaways grows more complex and volatile as dark secrets are exposed.\nSeeing such lavish lifestyles of excess and unimaginable abundance brought undone by the characters’ own most damning flaws would be an intoxicating enough viewing experience on its own, but the fact that the series revels in such scandalous splashes of comedy has made it a true sensation. Coupling such bold and boisterous storytelling with perfect performances from an all-star cast and a dream-like setting only enhances the spectacle, making The White Lotus one of the defining series of the decade thus far, of any genre.\nThe White Lotus\n- Release Date\n- 2021 - 2024\n- Network\n- HBO\n- Showrunner\n- Mike White\n- Directors\n- Mike White\nCast\n-\nKate Bohr\n-\nLaurie Duffy\nThe White Lotus is a television series that explores the interactions of guests and staff at an upscale tropical resort. Premiering in 2021, the narrative unfolds over a week, revealing underlying complexities and tensions among the resort's seemingly ideal travelers and employees.\n16 'The Great' (2020–2023)\nCreated by Tony McNamara\nA striking combination of absurd satirical comedy and historical drama, The Great ran for three seasons through the early 2020s to a delightfully wicked and witty treat of modern small-screen entertainment. Soaring off the back of excellent performances from Elle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult, it serves as a loose detail of Catherine the Great’s (Fanning) astonishing journey from being a German noblewoman wedded to Peter III of Russia (Hoult) to becoming the longest-running female ruler in Russian history.\nAs it is upfront about its wild departures from historical accuracy, The Great manages to weave an enthralling spectacle of stupefying comedic might and bewildering political tangents to deliver a viewing experience that is both confounding and compelling. It is confronting with its boldness, hysterical in its appetite for dark laughs, and surprisingly powerful as a twisted drama with sharp revisionist feminist sensitivities.\n15 'Six Feet Under' (2001–2005)\nCreated by Alan Ball\nA funeral home family drama that often finds plenty of scope for comedic inflection, Six Feet Under is one of the more underrated series of the early 2000s. It follows Nate (Peter Krause) and David Fisher (Michael C. Hall), brothers who find ownership of the Fisher & Sons funeral parlor bequeathed to them in the wake of their father’s death. As other characters enter the fold, the series focuses on the dysfunctional family’s efforts to maintain the business while each individual character forms their own understanding of and relationship with the concept of death.\nThe comedy of the series is pitch black and biting, and not necessarily present in every episode. However, it is enough to be a defining aspect of the series, even as it thrives as a considered and commanding drama that was years ahead of its time in terms of its thematic grappling with such issues as sexuality and masculinity. Maintaining its dramatic depth and comedy flair right up to the final episode, Six Feet Under is a somewhat forgotten gem of television that many modern viewers would be well-advised to seek out.\n14 'The Bear' (2022–)\nCreated by Christopher Storer\nExcelling as one of the hit series of late, The Bear is perhaps more inclined to lean into the devastation of its drama more so than the bravura of its comedy, but it remains a sharp blending of genres that is often as outrageously hilarious as it is poignant. Dealing with heartbreaking family drama and the pursuit of one’s dreams, it follows award-winning chef Carmen (Jeremy Allen White) as he leaves New York City to return to Chicago to take over the decrepit restaurant left to him following his brother’s suicide. As he struggles through his family trauma, he is also confronted by many obstacles as he tries to launch the business.\nAuthentic, raw, and unflinching, The Bear is superb as both a grim and honest presentation of a dysfunctional family on the brink of collapse and a frenetic and foul-mouthed immersion in the chaos of a working kitchen. The inflection of comedy it brings to both aspects of Carmen’s life is not only bitingly funny, but surprisingly grounding and deftly realistic as well. The Bear is set to return for a fourth season in June.\nThe Bear\n- Release Date\n- June 23, 2022\n- Network\n- Hulu\n- Showrunner\n- Christopher Storer\n- Directors\n- Ramy Youssef\nCast\n-\nCarmen 'Carmy' Berzatto\n-\nRichard 'Richie' Jerimovich\nCarmen \"Carmy\" Berzatto, a young chef from the fine dining world, returns to Chicago to run his family's sandwich shop after a tragedy. As he navigates the chaotic environment of the small kitchen, Carmy must manage the struggles of turning around the failing business while dealing with his own grief and personal demons. The series dives deep into the intense world of culinary arts, highlighting the challenges of running a restaurant, the bonds formed among staff, and the relentless pursuit of perfection.\n13 'Barry' (2018–2023)\nCreated by Alec Berg and Bill Hader\nA powerful and poignant examination of depression, loneliness, and trauma that just so happens to be one of the most outlandishly hilarious crime series ever released, Barry rightfully became a mainstream hit in its later seasons. It centers on Barry Berkman (Bill Hader), an isolated veteran from Afghanistan whose work as a hitman leads to an unlikely opportunity when he follows a target into an acting class in L.A. and discovers a passion for the performing arts that serves as an outlet for his anxiety. As he commits to perusing acting professionally, he struggles to distance himself from looming figures of his past life.\nThe series evolves quite brilliantly throughout its four-season run, finding new depths in Barry’s psyche with every turn while expanding the story in intriguing ways as it maintains a dramatic weight and a flair for comedy amid its criminal intrigue. Delightfully offbeat and sneakily upsetting, Barry is as powerful as it is profound, and will likely come to be revered as a golden highlight of 2020s television.\nBarry\n- Release Date\n- 2018 - 2023-00-00\n- Network\n- HBO Max\n- Showrunner\n- Alec Berg\n- Directors\n- Alec Berg\nCast\n-\nBarry Berkman\n-\nSally Reed\n12 'Beef' (2023)\nCreated by Lee Sung Jon\nFinding resonance in road rage, the Netflix original miniseries Beef currently stands as one of the sharpest and most celebrated small-screen titles of the decade thus far. It follows Amy Lau (Ali Wong) and Danny Cho (Steven Yeun), two strangers who vie against each other as an incident in a parking lot erupts into a frenetic car chase, the aftermath of which takes a tremendous toll on both their lives.\nThe two characters’ explosive temperaments are almost as entrancing as their self-destructive pettiness, their simmering feelings of anxiety, helplessness, and anger are phenomenally explored through a deft balance of tragedy, drama, comedy, and even suspense. Fueled by the two outstanding lead performances, Beef soars as an often hilarious and increasingly surreal deep-dive into the minutiae of rage and frustration, and, in doing so, dissects a growing portion of America’s cultural psyche. A second season of Beef that will focus on new characters is in production.\n11 'The Boys' (2019–)\nCreated by Erik Kripke\nAbout as shocking as superhero entertainment has ever gotten, The Boys prides itself on taking the popular action subgenre, exploiting it with a wonderful penchant for graphic content, and mixing it with a ferocious satirical bite for good measure. Set in a world where superheroes are real and are adored as celebrities, it follows a small gang of wronged outcasts who set out to expose the true nature of the “supes,” showcasing their reckless violence and their moral corruption to the masses.\nThe series has never been shy of poking fun at trending issues in modern society with both comedic fervor and fierce dramatic urgency. In fact, it’s been about as subtle as a sledgehammer in its satirical skewering of the covering-up of illicit activities in high-profile industries and, in later seasons particularly, the growing vitriolic sentiment that has been festering amid far-right-wing groups in America. Couple this with the series’ penchant for obscene violence, graphic nudity, and ceaseless profanity, and The Boys ranks highly among the most scandalizing TV shows of all time.\nThe Boys\n- Release Date\n- July 26, 2019\n- Director\n- Dan Trachtenberg, Philip Sgriccia\n- Writers\n- Eric Kripke, Anne Cofell Saunders, Ellie Monahan, Garth Ennis, Evan Goldberg, Phil Hay\nCast\n-\nJennifer Esposito",
