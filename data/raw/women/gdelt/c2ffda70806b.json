RWA's Built Environment Plan\n(Stage One)\nB. RWA's Employment and Enterprise\nPlan\nC. RWA's Human Services Plan (Phase\nOne)\nD. RWA's Human Services Plan (Phase\nTwo) Draft\nThe Redfern-Waterloo Authority (RWA) was established on 17\nJanuary 2005.\nThe Redfern-Waterloo Authority Act 2004 sets out the\norganisation's aims and objectives. It contains a number of provisions which\nare specifically directed towards overcoming Indigenous disadvantage in the\nRWA's operational area.\nWhilst not formally expressed as seeking to close the\nlifetime expectancy gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people, the RWA's\nactivities under the Act are targeted at issues which include health and\nwellbeing, education, employment, housing, incarceration and the criminal\njustice system, cultural identity, self-determination and economic development.\nThe RWA regards these issues as going to the core of Indigenous disadvantage\nand has developed strategies which seek to tackle root causes of problems.\nIndeed, the Terms of Reference for the Standing Committee's Inquiry acknowledge\nthese as key issues which may impact on lifetime expectancy.\nThis submission therefore seeks to set out some of the\nmajor activities and achievements of the RWA over nearly three years of\noperation as part of the New South Wales Government's ten year Redfern-Waterloo\nPlan. It is submitted that a solid foundation is being laid for substantial and\nsustainable progress towards overcoming Indigenous disadvantage in the\nRedfern-Waterloo area.\nThe RWA has defined its strategic planning and operations\ninto three broad areas:\n* Built Environment – the creation of new planning\ncontrols on key strategic urban renewal sites to stimulate economic growth and\ninvestment thereby facilitating employment and training opportunities,\nencouraging new residents and affordable housing, improving public housing,\nestablishing new community and cultural facilities, and fostering a safer, more\nbalanced and therefore sustainable community, including through improved urban\ndesign.\n* Employment and Enterprise – the creation of essential\nlinkages between the area's economic growth and local employment, education and\ntraining needs –particularly for the Indigenous community, seeking partnerships\nto broaden opportunities for locals beyond the area's boundary, fostering\nIndigenous enterprise in key areas such as tourism, arts and hospitality and\npromoting advancement through sustainable self-determination.\n* Human Services – the creation of a comprehensive reform\nagenda for the delivery of essential human services including seeking new or\nimproved services to match the local community's real needs, advocating\nculturally-appropriate programs and enhanced social justice for the area's most\ndisadvantaged, creating partnerships with key agencies and non-government\norganisations to develop solutions to entrenched social problems and ensuring\nthat human services issues are relevantly reflected in the overall planning for\nthe area's urban renewal.\nSome of the key initiatives since the RWA's commencement\ninclude:\n- more than $600 million has been earmarked for\nurban renewal in Redfern-Waterloo – this will rise to more than $1 billion by\nend 2008\n- new planning controls have been introduced on\nGovernment lands and other strategic sites as an incentive to investment and\neconomic growth\n- important new community facilities such as a\nhealth centre and a national Indigenous centre of excellence are being\nestablished\n- the RWA has achieved returns to Government of\nmore than $25 million from sale of surplus lands for urban renewal and\nemployment creation and this will increase by a further $100-120 million in\n2008.\n- more than 2600 new jobs will have been created\n(by the end of 2009), which represents a greater than 20% increase in\nemployment numbers for the whole of Redfern-Waterloo\n- 209 construction jobs have been created under\nthe RWA's innovative Indigenous Employment Model.\n- an Indigenous training college has been\nestablished with more than 70% of graduates obtaining employment\n- the RWA-managed\nAustralian Technology\nPark (ATP) will achieve\nnormalised profits totalling $16.73 million, which are being reinvested in the\nPark's future growth\n- the market value of the ATP will have increased\nby $43.15 million as a direct result of the RWA's development activities\n- the built floor space at the ATP will have\nincreased from 44,000 square metres in 2006 to about 100,000 square metres by\n2009\n- a major reform to human services delivery has\nbeen achieved at no net increase in cost to Government\nThe Built Environment Plan (Stage One) encourages an\nemployment and investment based revitalisation of the area by developing new\nplanning controls on key strategic sites. These controls have been enacted in\nthe State Environmental Planning Policy (Major Projects) 2005.\nStage One was publicly released on 30 August 2006\nfollowing an extensive process of community consultation. The key strategic\nsites, which total about 35 hectares, are mostly owned by the State Government\nand/or located near the Redfern Railway Station and the Redfern Town Centre.\nThe Plan also identifies strategies for associated\ntransport and traffic management, heritage preservation/adaptive reuse, open\nspace and public domain improvements, new infrastructure and community\nfacilities, enhanced connectivity through pedestrian and cycle access and\nprovisions for the achievement of a safer and more sustainable community.\nIt is envisaged that Stage One of the Plan will generate\nabout 440,000 square metres of employment space which in turn could create up\nto 18,000 new jobs in the area. Although it is still only early days in the\ncontext of a ten year strategy, development projects already facilitated by the\nRWA will create about 2600 new jobs in the area which translates to more than a\n20% increase in jobs in Redfern-Waterloo.\nAbout 2000 new dwellings could also be developed under\nStage One.\nChapter 3 of this submission outlines in more detail the\nbeneficial employment, enterprise and training impacts on the Indigenous\ncommunity flowing from the RWA's overall built environment strategy.\nIn the Built Environment context, more than $600 million\nhas been earmarked for Redfern-Waterloo's urban renewal from the date of the\nRWA's commencement in January 2005. This is expected to increase to more than\n$1.1 billion by the end of 2008. The State Government will have been directly\nresponsible for facilitating about $1 billion of this current and future\ninvestment.\nMost of the construction or other projects detailed below\nhave a direct beneficial impact for the Indigenous community through jobs and\ntraining or cultural activities and some also provide new or improved\nfacilities which further strengthen cultural resilience. Quantifiable\nIndigenous impacts have been highlighted in bold.\nThe projects are:\n- $123 million being invested by ATP Partnership\nin constructing a new 43,500 sqm state-of-the-art media centre at the RWA-owned Australian Technology\nPark (ATP). Works\ncurrently underway and due for completion in September 2009 (60 Indigenous construction jobs to be\ncreated).\n- Concept planning and sale by the RWA to allow\nredevelopment of the former Rachel\nForster Hospital\nsite for a 150 dwelling residential development valued at $70 million upon\ncompletion. Sale\nis currently being finalised following conclusion of tender process in November\n2007.\n- $47 million invested by the RWA in developing a\nnew research building at the ATP to house National ICT Australia and the\nDefence, Science and Technology Organisation. Building due for completion at\nend of 2007 (29 Indigenous construction\njobs).\n- $40 million invested by Arts NSW for a new\ncontemporary performing arts space through adaptive reuse of the heritage CarriageWorks at North Eveleigh.\nProject completed in January 2007 (24\nIndigenous construction jobs).\n- $45\nmillion being invested by the Commonwealth's Indigenous Land Corporation (ILC)\nin purchasing and transforming the former Redfern Public School into a new\nNational Indigenous Development Centre. Project approval for the new sports,\neducation, community and cultural centre of excellence given by Minister for\nPlanning in October 2007 with works expected to commence in early 2008 (20\nIndigenous construction jobs).\n- $37 million to be delivered over the next 10\nyears for public amenities and works through the RWA's Contributions Plan. Plan\napproved by the Minister for Planning in May 2007.\n- $35 million to be delivered over the next 10\nyears for affordable housing through the RWA's Affordable Housing Contributions\nPlan (including $16 million in\naffordable housing for Aboriginal residents). Plan approved by the Minister\nfor Planning in May 2007.\n- $23 million to be delivered over the next 10\nyears for affordable housing through the RWAs Affordable Housing Planning\nAgreement resulting from the redevelopment of the former CUB site in Broadway.\nThe Agreement was finalised in January 2007.\n- $27 million being invested by the Department of\nHousing (DoH) in the redevelopment of public housing in Redfern's Elizabeth\nStreet. This will deliver 106 new dwellings which\nwill replace the existing homes on the site (RWA's Indigenous Employment Model to be applied to the construction\ncontract – job numbers to be determined).\n- Development approval and sale by DoH of land\nadjacent to the Elizabeth Street\nredevelopment to allow construction of 158 new private dwellings with a completion\nvalue estimated at $70-80 million.\n- $20 million invested by the City of Sydney on the upgrade to\nRedfern and Regent Streets. Project completed in 2007 (25 Indigenous construction jobs in the City's urban improvements\nprograms –including redevelopment of Redfern Park and the upgrading of three\nparks).\n- $20 million being invested by the City of Sydney for the redevelopment of Redfern Park.\nWorks currently underway.\n- $19 million being invested by South Sydney Leagues Club in a major upgrade of its Chalmers Street\nbuilding and facilities. Works underway. In conjunction with the City's Redfern Park upgrade, it signals the\n\"Return to Redfern\" of the Rabbitohs football club, which has always\nplayed a significant role in providing opportunities for the local Indigenous\ncommunity. Works currently underway. (5 Indigenous construction jobs).\n- $10\nmillion to be invested by NSW Health in transforming the heritage former\nRedfern Courthouse and Police Station into a major new community health\nfacility. Works to commence in 2008 and to be completed in August 2009\n(Indigenous job numbers to be determined).\n- $8\nmillion being invested by the Indigenous Land Corporation in the redevelopment\nof the vacant former Black Theatre site in Cope Street. Works currently underway (7 Indigenous\nconstruction jobs).\n- $6 million to be invested by the RWA in\nconstructing the Eveleigh Heritage Walk, a pedestrian/cycle bridge connecting North Eveleigh and the ATP. Detailed deign work underway (Indigenous job numbers to be determined).\n- $7.2 million invested by the RWA and ATP in new\nroads and infrastructure to facilitate the Technology Park's\nfuture development. Works completed (6\nIndigenous construction jobs).\n- $4.2 million invested by the NSW Police Service\nin March 2005 in establishing a new police station opposite Redfern Railway\nStation.\n- $3 million being invested by the RWA for the\nadaptive re-use of the heritage Blacksmiths Workshop at North\nEveleigh to create community markets. Development approval\nexpected by early December 2007 and completion expected in second half of 2008\n(Indigenous job numbers to be determined).\n- $1\nmillion invested by the City of Sydney in upgrading three parks in the Eveleigh\nStreet precinct – Yellowmundee, Hugo Street Reserve and Pemulwuy Park. Works\ncompleted.\n- $850,000 invested by the RWA in\ndeveloping the new Yaama Dhiyaan Indigenous training centre at North Eveleigh,\nincorporating the Les Tobler Construction Training Centre. Accredited training\nin the hospitality industry commenced in October 2006 and Koori Job Ready Courses in Construction commenced in early\n2007. Training funds are mainly provided by the NSW Department of Education and\nTraining along with some additional Commonwealth funding ( a total of 209\nIndigenous construction jobs to date and over 70% of hospitality graduates have\nobtained work).\n- More than $1 million being invested by the City\nof Sydney in the upgrade of the skate-park and\nyouth facilities at Waterloo\nPark.\n- $1.25 million in total allocated by the RailCorp\nand RWA for a concept design study for the upgrade of Redfern Railway station\n($250K) and by RailCorp ($1 M) for further feasibility work in 2007-08 on the\nupgrade.\nSale of Surplus Government Lands\nIn 2006 the RWA brokered the sale of the former Redfern Public School for $14.8 million to the\nCommonwealth Government's Indigenous Land Corporation. The ILC paid the sale\nprice to DET. This followed the RWA's rezoning blueprint for the site under\nStage One of the BEP, which was given effect in the SEPP. The ILC has\nsubsequently received planning approval for construction of a $30 million\nNational Indigenous Development Centre on the site.\nThe SEPP also rezoned the former Rachel Forster\nHospital site in\naccordance with the RWA's blueprint in the BEP. Following this, the RWA concept\nplanned the site and put it to market. The sale tender process closed on 20\nNovember 2007. Sale\nproceeds will be used to build a $10 million community health centre at the\nformer Redfern Courthouse/Police Station. The completion value of the proposed\nresidential development on the former Hospital site is estimated to be about\n$70 million.\nThe RWA is also currently concept planning surplus\nRailCorp lands at North Eveleigh to take to\nthe market for sale in mid 2008, subject to approval. Once again this land was\nrezoned by the RWA under its BEP. It is expected that the Concept Plan\napplication will be lodged in February 2008. The estimated commercial and\nresidential construction cost on this 10.5 hectare site is $466 million.\nThese projects are expected to be significant local\nemployment generators, in the construction phase and beyond. The RWA will be\nseeking to apply its Indigenous Employment Model to these projects.\nAboriginal Housing\nCompany Land – Eveleigh\nStreet Precinct (including the Block)\nThe new planning controls developed by the RWA in Stage\nOne of the Built Environment Plan for the Eveleigh Street precinct, which\nincludes 7752 square metres of land owned by the Aboriginal Housing Company\n(AHC), have considerably increased the value and development potential of AHC land.\nAHC land that was formerly zoned residential or open space\nhas been rezoned as 'Mixed Use' with increased heights and floor space ratios.\nIndeed under the RWA's new planning controls, the development potential of AHC\nland in the Eveleigh Street precinct has nearly doubled from that which existed\nunder the former City of Sydney planning controls – an increase of 6715 sqm\nfrom 7752 sqm to 14467 sqm of development potential.\nThe new 'Mixed Use' zone provides for a range of land uses\nwithin close proximity to Redfern Railway Station. It allows for employment\nactivity and job creation within a range of enterprises including businesses,\ncultural, recreation and community services. The zone also allows housing.\nOn 24 October 2007, the AHC lodged a Concept Plan\napplication with the Department of Planning for redevelopment of its land in\nthe Eveleigh Street\nprecinct. It is understood that the application seeks to take advantage of the\nsignificant opportunities provided by the new planning controls.\nOn 1 June 2006 the Commonwealth and NSW Governments\nentered into a formal partnership agreement for cooperation \"on enhancing\nthe economic and social revitalisation of Redfern-Waterloo in relation to the\nIndigenous community\".\nThe Partnership Agreement states that the two governments\nwill work closely together on key areas including employment and enterprise,\neducation, Indigenous housing and the Block and human services.\nThe mutual aim of the Agreement is to address social and\neconomic disadvantage, to reduce welfare dependency through wealth creation and\nto improve the delivery of services.\nThe terms of the agreement were negotiated by the RWA.\nThe RWA is currently working in partnership with the\nDepartment of Housing to ascertain the options that may exist for\nrevitalisation of existing public housing stock and the opportunities that this\nmay create to enhance the availability of affordable housing in\nRedfern-Waterloo. The aim is to facilitate a comprehensive social housing\nimprovement strategy for the area.\nOptions may include:\n- improving the public domain\n- renewing public housing\n- improving the mix of housing types and tenures\n- encouraging sustainable communities and\nenhancing social mix\n- facilitating the provision of affordable housing\nthrough consideration of various financial models, including a shared equity\nmodel of home ownership\nThe RWA and DoH will build on community strengths and\nrecognise in particular that high rise public housing is home to significant\ncommunities. It is critical that the future built environment matches the\ncommunity's needs.\nThe NSW Government has made the following public\ncommitments in respect to the future of public housing in Redfern-Waterloo:\n- there will be no cuts to the amount of public\nhousing\n- current residents will not be disadvantaged\n- all public tenancies are secure\nThe Redfern-Waterloo community and public housing tenants\nin particular will be extensively consulted on any proposals for public housing\nrenewal.\nThe RWA expects that there may be significant potential\nfor Aboriginal employment arising from the implementation of public housing\nrenewal under Stage Two.\nAt this stage, the RWA anticipates that a draft of Stage\nTwo of the Built Environment Plan may be available for public exhibition by\nMarch 2008.\nThe RWA assumed ownership of the Australian Technology\nPark on 17 January 2005\nby virtue of the Redfern-Waterloo Authority Act 2004. However, the RWA did not\nassume formal management of the ATP from the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority\nuntil 1 April 2005. Upon assuming management control, the RWA immediately set\nabout a restructure of the company's operations. A new business plan was\nintroduced and stricter financial disciplines were introduced.\nSince 2004-2005, the ATP has recorded normalised profits\ntotalling $16.73 million.\nThe profits that the ATP company is generating will be\ncritical to financing the significant costs necessary to fund the future\ndevelopment of residual land at the Park over the next five years or so.\nAvailable funds may also be responsibly utilised towards reducing debt (up to\n$47 million) incurred through the RWA's Treasury borrowings to fund the\ndevelopment of the NICTA building.\nThe table below provides a year to year comparison of the\ncompany's strong performance over the past three financial years. It\nillustrates strong revenue and profit growth over the period whilst operating\ncosts and employee related expenses have been reduced.\nATP Year to Year comparison [please see original for graph\npage 11 of submission - link No.\n11, Redfern-Waterloo Authority]\nOn 1 April 2005, the ATP was comprised of about 44,000\nsquare metres of employment space, most of which was in heritage former\nrailways buildings which had been adaptively reused. Indeed, there had been no\nnew commercial development at the ATP in the previous five years. About 1000\nemployees worked at the Park.\nSince assuming ownership and control, the RWA has built an\nadditional 12,000 square metres of employment space in the form of a new\nresearch facility to house National ICT Australia and the Defence Science and\nTechnology Organisation. The RWA's $47 million development will be completed at\nthe end of 2007.\nIn October 2007, the RWA also completed its $7.2 million\nRoads and Infrastructure Project, which has built new infrastructure critical\nto the Park's future commercial development.\nIn November 2007, early works also commenced on the $123\nmillion development of a 43,500 square metre media hub to house the Seven\nNetwork, Pacific Magazines and Global Television in the first instance.\nProbably the biggest single private sector investment in Redfern's history, the\ndevelopment negotiated by the RWA with ATP Partnership Limited is scheduled for\ncompletion in September 2009.\nThe above developments alone will see the ATP's employment\nfloor space increase from 44,000 in 2005 to almost 100,000 square metres by\n2009. Total jobs at the Park will have increased from 1000 to about 3600. This\nalso represents about a 20% increase in jobs for the entire Redfern-Waterloo\narea, reversing a decades-long decline in employment numbers.\nCurrent projects have created a total 95 Indigenous\nconstruction jobs at the ATP. The agreement for the development of the Seven\nNetwork is also intended to generate further Indigenous jobs in the media\nbusinesses establishing at the Park.\nOther development projects currently under negotiation are\nexpected to see the ATP develop its full potential of 200,000 square metres of\nemployment space over the next five or so years, which will result in about\n8000 jobs at the Park. This means that the ATP will be the key employment\ngenerator under Stage One of the Built Environment Plan.\nIt is important to note that the market value of the ATP\nhas increased by $43.15 million as a result of the RWA's development activities\nover the past two years.\n3.1 Jobs, Opportunity,\nProsperity\nThe RWA's employment and enterprise development strategy\naims to directly challenge the area's social and economic disadvantage by\nfostering jobs, educational and life opportunities and a higher standard of\nliving.\nThe RWA sees wealth creation as an antidote to welfare\ndependency. The path to wealth creation through well-paid employment is education\n– whether this is through vocational education or tertiary education.\nUrban renewal will mean enhancing employment and\nenterprise opportunities for the local and wider metropolitan community, as\nwell as revitalising the area with new residents and economic activity. The\nRedfern-Waterloo Plan encompasses the three inter-linked elements of renewal of\nthe built environment, facilitation of employment and enterprise development\nand reform of human services delivery by Government and Non-Government Organisations.\nThe Built Environment Plan proposes to create 440,000\nsquare metres of net employment floor space that will be developed over future\nyears through commercial development on sites currently designated as State\nSignificant within the Redfern-Waterloo area. This translates to about 18,000\njobs.\nThere are currently about 12,500 jobs in the area, which\nis more than the resident workforce, yet local Aboriginal unemployment is a\nmajor issue. It would seem therefore that local unemployment is more about local\njob seekers needing greater training and skills to secure and maintain jobs in\neither the local area or from the adjoining CBD, rather than simply a lack of\njob opportunities.\nWhilst there have been previous attempts to address\nAboriginal employment issues in the area, what is needed is a comprehensive\ntraining and employment strategy that delivers skilled job seekers to meet the\nspecific employment needs of the market, taking into account future growth\npotential.\nThe Aboriginal community has a high rate of unemployment\namongst those who are in the labour force (31 %). There are an extremely high\npercentage of local Aboriginal people not in the labour force (62%). This\nwidespread non-engagement with the workforce is a major factor contributing to\nthe social and economic disadvantages facing the community.\nYouth unemployment in the Aboriginal community has\nlong-term consequences because it occurs at the beginning of a person's working\nlife. Not only does the person suffer from a lack of income, but joblessness at\nthis age also means they miss out on opportunities for skill development that\nresults from on-the-job training and subsequent work experience.\nAboriginal people who experience unemployment early have a\nhigher probability of experiencing joblessness and lower earnings in the\nfuture.\nStudies (such as by the Smith Family 2003) have shown that\nthe youth most at risk of unemployment live in disadvantaged communities\ncharacterised by low socio-economic levels; that have a higher level of early\nschool leavers with associated low levels of literacy and numeracy skills and\nassociated low levels of workforce participation.\nAddressing the root causes of social disadvantage is a\nmajor part of addressing unemployment in the area. The Human Services Plan for\nRedfern-Waterloo, finalised by the RWA in December 2005, seeks to do this.\nPhase One of the Human Services Plan addresses reforming and integrating local\nservices for Aboriginal people. (Refer to Chapter 4 for further details of the\nHuman Services Plan)\nProviding opportunities for wealth creation is an\nimportant element of the RWA's employment strategy. Empowering Aboriginal\npeople to create their own wealth (through meaningful employment or starting\ntheir own enterprise) is one aspect of addressing the root causes of social\ndisadvantage experienced in sectors of the community.\nThe reasons for 31% of the Aboriginal Community being\nunemployed and 62% of the Aboriginal community not being in the labour force\nwill vary from person to person, but will include: lack of skills and\nopportunity, physical and mental disabilities; family caring arrangements which\nprohibit 'traditional' work and generations of family members being unemployed.\nThe RWA wants to identify ways to motivate people who are\nable to work but for various reasons currently do not want to. Some people have\nlost motivation to work or look for work after many years facing lack of\navailable opportunities, discrimination, stereo-typing, training course after\ntraining course that has not led to employment and even through not knowing how\nto apply for jobs.\nMany Aboriginal people have grown up in an environment\nwhere their parents and role models are unemployed and they therefore have much\nless familiarity with a culture of work.\nA large number of young people in the area have grown up\nin an environment where their parents and role models are unemployed. This can\nhave a large impact on attitudes to working when, for example, a young person\nmay not live in a home where any adults are engaged in the workforce. Young\nAboriginal people in these households are markedly disadvantaged in terms of\nexposure to working skills, the realities of working life and the simple\nhousehold rhythms of getting ready to go to work in the mornings.\nWorkplace technologies are changing rapidly and Aboriginal\npeople from households where family members are not in the workforce suffer\nfrom a lack of skills and exposure to modern workplace approaches and\nprocesses, particularly in relationship to the computerisation of complex tasks\nand the changes in the composition of work.\nDuring 2006 and early 2007 the RWA commissioned a\nspecialised project to work with the local Aboriginal community to gain an\nunderstanding of the factors that impact on how a community develops a culture\nof work. The project focused on identifying current programs and initiatives\nthat work and developing strategies that are applicable to Aboriginal people.\nRWA has found the best way to create a culture of work is\nto create the opportunity for Aboriginal people to become employed in\nmainstream jobs.\nThe RWA has developed several major strategies that are\nbeing progressively implemented over the next ten years.\nThe Built Environment Plan (Stage One) has been finalised\nand is currently being implemented. Initial projections estimate that up to\n18,000 jobs can be created in future years through commercial development on\nthe nine sites currently designated as State Significant by the\nRedfern-Waterloo Authority\n600 jobs alone will be created at the Australian Technology\nPark by 2008 with the\nRWA's decision to develop a $47 million new building to house the National ICT\nAustralia and the Defence, Science and Technology Organisation and due for\ncompletion in late 2007. A number of other significant building projects at the\nATP have commenced demonstrating the huge employment generating potential of\nthis site alone.\nThe largest project underway is the $123 million\ndevelopment of the corporate headquarters of the Seven Network and Pacific\nMagazines at ATP. This development is expected to generate 2,000 permanent\njobs. The RWA has negotiated for 60 jobs for Aboriginal people during the\nconstruction phase and is identifying job opportunities for Aboriginal people\nonce operations have commenced.\nThe RWA has identified several major strategies that\nsupport the development of employment and enterprise opportunities for both\nlocal Aboriginal residents as well as the broader metropolitan Aboriginal\ncommunity. These opportunities are located in walking distance to Sydney's second most\naccessible railway station; thereby ensuring jobs for Aboriginal people are\nlocated close to public transport services.\nIn addition to the above projects, the RWA's Employment\nPlan had identified further employment opportunities for Aboriginal people from\nthe construction and long term developments at Rachel\nFoster Hospital\nsite, Redfern Street Community Health Centre, National Indigenous Development\nCentre, the North Eveleigh precinct, the Redfern Station-Regent Street\nprecinct and the redevelopment of Elizabeth Street.\nIn urban renewal projects on Government land the RWA creates\njobs for Aboriginal people through implementing Aboriginal Participation\nprinciples. It is essential to the RWA's urban renewal vision that the local\nAboriginal community are direct and substantial beneficiaries of the area's\nsocial and economic revitalisation.\nOnly tenders that include an Aboriginal Participation Plan\nare accepted for major construction works on Government land.\nThe RWA is negotiating with other Government agencies to\ndo likewise, and is facilitating the training of a supply of skilled Aboriginal\npeople to take up these opportunities in Government contracts outside of\nRedfern-Waterloo.\nThe RWA's Indigenous Employment Model was developed to\nensure that the creation of employment opportunities for Aboriginal people in\nthe construction industry would be successful. Without such a model employment\nopportunities for Aboriginal people have historically not been successful. The\nmodel makes it easy for employers to employ Aboriginal trainees and\napprentices, through the RWA recruiting, providing pre-apprenticeship training\nand valuable mentoring support. .\nThe success of the RWA's ground breaking Indigenous\nEmployment Model continues as other sectors of Government are now using it to\nemploy Aboriginal people on their construction projects. The Indigenous\nEmployment Model has created significant numbers of jobs for Indigenous\nworkers.\nThe RWA has applied the Indigenous Employment Model to all\ngovernment projects in the area resulting in 24 jobs for Aboriginal people\nbeing created during the refurbishment of the Carriageworks Arts Centre and\nassociated infrastructure works at North Eveleigh.\n6 positions created on the refurbishment of Yaama Dhiyaan\nTraining Centre; 29 positions created during the construction of the NICTA\nbuilding at ATP; 6 positions created on the roadwork contract at ATP and 60\npositions to be created during the construction of the Channel 7 Headquarters\nat ATP.\nThe RWA provides the model to the City of Sydney which has resulted in the creation of\nmore than 25 employment opportunities for Aboriginal people in the City's urban\nimprovement programs. The RWA provides the full resources of its Indigenous\nEmployment Model to ensure the employment of Aboriginal people is successful.\nTo date the model has been used on a number of the City's\nprojects such as the Glebe Point Road Upgrade, Redfern-Regent Street upgrade and the Redfern Park redevelopment.\nThe Commonwealth Government - through the Indigenous Land\nCorporation - is working with the RWA to employ 7 Aboriginal people during the\nconstruction work on the Black Theatre site on Cope Street. The Indigenous Employment\nModel is also being used to create over 20 positions for Aboriginal people on\nthe construction of the National Indigenous Development Centre on the site of\nthe former Redfern\nPublic School.\nSince the RWA commenced implementing the Indigenous\nEmployment Model in mid 2005 approximately 209 jobs for Aboriginal people have\nbeen brokered in the construction industry in the Redfern Waterloo area.\nOf these 209 positions, 97 people have been employed to\ndate with another 112 positions to come on line in 2008-2009.\nAn analysis of the jobs filled to date identified\npositions across 24 trades, the major ones as follows:\n- Skilled labourers 30%;\n- Metal trades 9%\n- Painters 8%\n- Apprentice carpenters 7%\n- Apprentice electricians 7%\n- Apprentice plumbers 7%\n- Bricklayers 5%\n- Civil trainees 4%\n- Form work trainees 4%\n- Traffic controllers 3%\n- Apprentice landscapers 3%\nThree Aboriginal apprentices and trainees employed under\nthe model received industry awards for excellence during 2007.\nThe RWA aims to have the State, Federal and local\ngovernment sectors adopt the highly successful Indigenous Employment Model on\ncapital programs across NSW in areas of high Aboriginal populations. Other\nState Government agencies are expected to use the RWA's model in the near\nfuture, including the Departments of Commerce and Housing, and the Transport,\nInfrastructure and Development Corporation (TIDC).\nThe RWA is also negotiating for the City of Sydney to use the model\non infrastructure projects across the whole of the City as well as negotiating\nwith the local government park representative body to expand the model across\nlocal government projects throughout NSW.\nThe RWA has commenced offering the model to the private\nsector outside of the RWA area to increase the number of jobs available for\nAboriginal people. This area has been targeted by the RWA as offering unlimited\npotential following on from the successful program run in 2007.\nThe Yaama Dhiyaan Training &\nHospitality College\nopened its doors at Darlington in October 2006\nto offer a unique learning experience. An initiative of the RWA in partnership\nwith Aboriginal elder Aunty Beryl Van-Oploo\nand young Aboriginal chef, Matthew Cribb, the Centre offers an accredited\nhospitality training course with a strong focus on getting a job at its\nconclusion.\nThe NSW Government through the RWA committed $750,000 in\ncapital works and establishment costs to establish this centre in 2006, with a\nfurther $100,000 committed in 2007. NSW Department of Education and Training\nhas also provided support through training funds along with the Commonwealth\nDepartment of Employment and Workplace Relations.\nThe course teaches a nationally accredited 8 week\nCertificate II in Hospitality (Operations), with a focus on Indigenous culture\n& cuisine. Graduates also receive certification in Barista, Responsible\nService of Alcohol (RSA) and Responsible Conduct of Gaming (RCG). The quality\nand scope of the training provides graduates with the qualifications and\nexperience necessary for employment in the restaurant and café sectors, tourism\noperations, clubs, hotels and catering enterprises.\n\"There's a real feeling of pride amongst the local\ncommunity that the Centre has been established here in Redfern\" says Aunty\nBeryl Van Oploo.\nYaama Dhiyaan also provides function and catering\nservices, which are an invaluable source of work opportunities for students.\nSignificant on the job training and employment opportunities are also\nanticipated when the RWA commences operation of a commercial café and function\ncentre in early 2008.\nTraining is offered to a minimum of 60 students over four\ncourses delivered annually. More than 57 students have already graduated since\nYaama Dhiyaan opened in October 2006.\nThe RWA has developed partnerships with major hospitality\nemployers Compass Group, Accor Hotels and Spotless. Students are interviewed\nfor jobs with these companies towards the end of their training.\nOf the last hospitality courses, over 70% of students\nfound employment within a month of graduating, including some who have never\nbeen in the workforce previously. Jobs\ninclude housekeeping, working in banquets and functions and as kitchen stewards\nat Accor Hotels around Sydney;\nHuman Resources at Qantas; and catering work with Compass Group. In addition to\nthis, some graduates have found jobs in other industries or have gone back to\ncomplete further study. They have been able to do this after they have\nincreased their self confidence at Yaama\nThe Authority has developed partnerships with major\nhospitality companies including presentations to the students about employment\nopportunities with their companies, structured site visits to expose the\nstudents to the industry, programmed interviews and work experience.\nThis exposure to the industry is invaluable along with the\nwork experience gained on Yaama Dhiyaan functions and catering events.\nStudents who have graduated over the last year have found\nemployment or otherwise in the following areas:\n- Employed in hospitality industry 45%\n- Employed in industries other than hospitality 21%\n- Undertaking further education 8%\n- Custody issues preventing ability to work 8%\n- Parenthood 6%\n- Looking for work 6%\n- Travel 1%\n- No contact 5%\nLocated beneath Yaama Dhiyaan is the Les Tobler\nConstruction Training Centre where the Koori Job\nReady Course in Construction is taught.\nA partnership of the RWA and TAFE NSW, the Centre is named\nin honour of the Aboriginal elder Les Tobler, who was instrumental in\nestablishing the first Koori Job\nReady Program and involved in recruiting unemployed Aboriginal and Torres\nStrait Islanders for pre-employment programs.\nIn April 2007, 15 indigenous students took part in what\nwas the first of the three 8-week Koori Job\nReady Courses in Construction scheduled for 2007. On completing the courses,\ngraduates are offered employment on various Redfern-Waterloo building projects\nthrough the RWA's Indigenous Employment Model. Since this programme was\nestablished in 2006, the number of students who have graduated is more than 60\nwith another 15 expected to graduate in December 2007.\nThe on-site training program operating out of the centre\nprovides invaluable experience for students wishing to enter the construction\nindustry. The benefits of on-site training are substantial, particularly for\nAboriginal students as Aboriginal teachers can teach them within a workplace\ncontext, where successful Aboriginal tradespeople are employed on the major\nprojects.\nThe RWA delivers business workshops for Aboriginal\nenterprises, focusing on key business topics. These workshops are targeted at\nAboriginal people interested in expanding their own construction based\nbusinesses, as well as identifying opportunities for enterprise development.\nThe workshops have enhanced the business skills of\nexisting enterprises as well as informed Aboriginal people who are considering\nexpanding enterprises about business planning and financing.\nThe Aboriginal Enterprise Service also links private\nsector companies to Aboriginal businesses that support the growth of Aboriginal\nenterprises. This is achieved by providing an easily accessible point of\ncontact and up to date information on Aboriginal enterprises via the RWA web\nsite and through direct marketing to major construction companies.\nEnterprise Development opportunities for Aboriginal people\nin the Service industries\nThe Authority has identified the service industries as\noffering employment and enterprise development opportunities for local people.\nThe Authority has developed a partnership with the\nIndigenous Land Corporation to develop a training, enterprise and employment\nstrategy to ensure Aboriginal people are able to take up the future employment\nand contracting services that will be required to service the National\nIndigenous Development Centre, including hospitality cleaning, property\nmaintenance, security and landscape maintenance services.\nThe RWA has set up an Aboriginal Business Service, in\npartnership with the Department of State and Regional Development, to encourage\nand cuitivate successful indigenous businesses. Small business is a growing\nsector within the Redfern-Waterloo community and one where there are employment\nopportunities for local Aboriginal people.\nThe Aboriginal Enterprise Service has operated out of the\nRWA's office in Redfern since October 2005. The consultants located at the RWA\nprovide information on business start-up and business development. Aboriginal\npeople benefit from a one to one approach with an experienced business advisor\nwho can provide strategic business information and guidance. Making the service\naccessible locally provides greater support to the Aboriginal business\ncommunity.\nTo date, the service has advised on a wide range of\nbusiness initiatives from cafes to driving schools. The RWA is committed to\nexpanding this service in line with future demand and sees a role in\nidentifying business opportunities and working with the community to encourage\nlocal people to take up the emerging opportunities.\nOver the 2 years that the service has been operating, the\nbusiness consultant has assisted over 70 potential or existing enterprises and\nis seen by the local Aboriginal community as a significant support specifically\navailable for Aboriginal people.\nThe continuation of this service is invaluable to enable\nAboriginal people access to professional business support. The Authority will\nnegotiate with the Department of State and Regional Development to continue to\njointly fund this initiative\nThe education and employment training systems play a key\nrole in preparing Aboriginal young people for employment. Completing Year 12\nprovides a significant buffer against unemployment (particularly amongst\nAboriginal youth where high school retention rates are half that of non-Indigenous\nyouth).\nPhase one of the Human Services Plan for Redfern-Waterloo\nhas prioritised lifting the local school attendance and retention rates and\nlocal school numeracy and literacy levels to at least the state average. These\nfactors alone have a large impact on a person's employability.\nThrough teaching local Aboriginal children vocational and\nenterprise skills and exposing them to community based employment experiences,\nthey have an increased chance of successfully transitioning from school to\nemployment or further education and training.\nVocational learning is appropriate for all years of\nschooling and includes general employability skills, enterprise education,\ncareer education, community and work based learning.\nVocational learning should provide basic skills and\nknowledge relevant to a range of workplace settings. There should also be a\nstrong focus on commencing pathways to employment and further vocational\nprograms. Assisting students to set goals that lead to future employment and\nproviding employment experiences is also important.\nThe RWA delivers vocational educational opportunities to Alexandria Park Community\nSchool in construction\nand hospitality.\nStudents are offered work experience at Yaama Dhiyaan\nfunction centre throughout the year. In addition, the Authority delivers a\npractical building program each year, aimed at students at risk of disengaging\nwith school. Both programs have proven highly successful.\nIn addition, through Yaama Dhiyaan, the Authority is able\nto provide vocational training for young Aboriginal people in the Juvenile\nJustice system that historically have been excluded from achieving vocational\nbased outcomes.\n3.3.6 Business Enterprise training for Aboriginal school students\nIn 2006 the RWA delivered a business skills program for\nAboriginal students at Alexandria\nPark School\nthrough the successful school based Young Achievers Australia program.\nThis program taught school students through experiential\nlearning techniques to: develop, finance, produce, market and sell the product\nthey developed. The practical experience gained through this initiative has\nbenefited those students wishing to pursue a career in business, as well as\nexpose others to potential job opportunities in their community through\nenterprise development.\nAs the RWA's work progresses, it will:\n- Work with the local community to ensure that the\nopportunities for Aboriginal people through cadetships are maximised for young\nAboriginal people in the area.\n- Expand cultural enterprises through design\nproduction linked to the tourist industry as well as support connections to\ninternational markets.\n- Support Aboriginal cultural enterprises to\ncreate a cultural experience in Redfern targeted at the growing cultural\ntourism industry.\n- Facilitate the commercial development of\ncultural enterprises.\n- Work with other programs that support\nentrepreneurial development in young people.\nThe RWA is implementing a number of strategies to\nreposition Redfern-Waterloo as a major cultural precinct in Sydney. Opportunities for cultural enterprise\ndevelopment are expected to grow commensurate with the success of the\nrevitalisation program.\nThe CarriageWorks\nContemporary Performing Arts Centre currently operating at the North Eveleigh provides a unique opportunity to develop a\ncultural industry precinct within the RWA operational area. To facilitate this,\nthe RWA-owned Australian Technology\nPark is providing\nsponsorship support of $125,000 over four years to help bring the Sydney\nFestival to the CarrriageWorks each January.\nThe North Eveleigh\ncultural precinct has become the creative heart of the RWA urban renewal\nprogram; an evolving and dynamic urban area offering a unique environment for\nresidential and commercial development.\nThe RWA has identified the opportunity for a significant\nAboriginal Arts Centre to be developed in the North\nEveleigh precinct. The centre would showcase Aboriginal arts as\nwell as provide the opportunity for cultural industry development. This would\ninclude Indigenous design, textile printing and clothing manufacturing sold\nthrough the Arts Centre and retail outlets.\nThrough the development of local markets at North Eveleigh, a number of other enterprise\nopportunities will arise through food stalls, craft and art stalls and\nentertainment. Involvement of Aboriginal people in these markets will be a key\nelement in their success and will be what differentiates them from other\nmarkets across Sydney.\nThe North Eveleigh\ncultural precinct, along with the development of Indigenous cultural tourism in\nthe area, will create employment opportunities for Aboriginal people.\nTo support and sustain a cultural industry sector, the RWA\nin partnership with the Department of State and Regional Development, will hold\ncultural industries business development workshops in 2008. The workshops will\nfocus on market and arts development opportunities for Aboriginal people in the\nRedfern-Waterloo area.\nThe RWA is committed to strengthening Aboriginal cultural\nresilience through the development of enterprises that celebrate Aboriginal\nculture.\nYaama Dhiyaan has provided Aboriginal people with a place\nin their community where they are proud to be Aboriginal. Yaama celebrates\nAboriginal culture through its cuisine. It is a show case for Aboriginal art,\nshowing pieces from the Boomali Aboriginal Artist collection.\nThe management and staff at Yaama is Aboriginal and the\nAboriginal community expresses its support by choosing to have their weddings,\nwakes, birthday parties, elder's events and policy launches at Yaama.\nAunty Beryl Van Oploo teaches the non Aboriginal community\nabout the culture of Aboriginal Australians. Aunty Beryl embodies cultural\nresilience. Yaama hosts cultural awareness and appreciation events for schools,\nbusinesses, universities and the private sector.\nOver 100 students graduate from Yaama Dhiyaan and the Les\nTobler Training Centre annually. At the completion of each course a formal\ngraduation ceremony allows the family and friends of the students to come\ntogether to celebrate the success of their child, parent or relative in a\njoyous public event. These events celebrate the achievements of Aboriginal\npeople and Aboriginal culture in an Aboriginal environment and provide positive\nrole models of successful Aboriginal people.\nCultural resilience is the ability to withstand the\npressure that main stream society places on marginalised communities. The\nAuthority's position is to maximise the number of Aboriginal people who\nsuccessfully complete their education and move into employment or enterprise\ndevelopment thereby achieving economic independence. Economic independence\nfacilitates self determination.\nThe Authority's is committed to work with Aboriginal\npeople to cement the positive initiatives in the Redfern Waterloo area and to\nfacilitate the ongoing celebration of Aboriginal culture through the\ndevelopment of an Aboriginal Arts Centre and Aboriginal cultural industries.\nA review of human services in Redfern and Waterloo conducted in 2004\nconcluded that many services in the area were poorly coordinated and\nintegrated. In some instances, the review found that there were also administrative\ninefficiencies, poor governance and there was service duplication. It was noted\nthat services could offer better value for money if enhanced integration was\nachieved.\nThe Redfern Waterloo Authority developed the\nRedfern-Waterloo Human Services Plan in partnership with Commonwealth, State\nand Local government agencies, service providers and the local community. The\nPlan aims to improve the coordination, quality and access to health, education,\ndisability, transport, employment and other human services in Redfern and Waterloo.\nThe Human Services Plan was developed in Phases. Phase One\nfocuses on improving services delivered to children and families, Aboriginal\npeople and young people. It also identifies priorities and actions to address\nimprovements to the delivery of health services.\nPhase Two looks at improvements to service delivery for\nolder people, people with disabilities, migrant communities and homeless\npeople.\nAlong with improvements to service delivery the Plan also\nsets out to improve the capacity of non-government organisations (NGOs)\noperating in the area to deliver better services.\nOverall, the Human Services Plan is premised on delivering\npositive outcomes for the Redfern-Waterloo community, to be achieved through\nreforms to service delivery within existing resources.\nOn 13 December 2005 the NSW State Cabinet endorsed the\nrelease of the Redfern-Waterloo Human Services Plan (Phase One).\nThe Phase One priorities are:\n- Improve the health and well being of children;\n- Lift local school numeracy and literacy levels\nto at least the state average;\n- Lift local school attendance and retention rates\nto at least the state average;\n- Improve support for vulnerable people;\n- Reduce the incidence of family violence;\n- Increase participation and involvement of young\npeople in the community;\n- Increase numbers of young people accessing\nemployment and training opportunities;\n- Reduce drug and alcohol misuse;\n- Reduce offending and recidivism; and\n- Build community capacity.\nAs part of the development of the Human Service Plan, NSW\nGovernment agencies have worked with Aboriginal and other service providers to\nensure the strategies and actions in the plan deliver positive outcomes for the\nAboriginal community.\nNSW Government agencies and non-government organisations\nare also required as part of the Plan to provide services in a culturally\nappropriate manner and in ways that are relevant to the needs of the Aboriginal\ncommunity.\nThe Plan also creates opportunities for the Aboriginal\ncommunity to find ways forward and for Elders to pass on heritage to children\nand young people in a positive way. Where appropriate actions in the Plan have\nalso been linked to Two Ways Together, the NSW Government's Aboriginal Affairs\nPlan 2003-2012.\nThere has been much progress of the Human Services Plan\nPhase One to date. Reports on the implementation of actions by Government\nagencies have been collected by the RWA on a quarterly basis and base line data\nrelating to the priority areas has also been recorded and will continue to be\nrecorded until 2010 to track the anticipated changes over time.\nActions by agencies that have already been achieved in the\npriority areas and that will specifically assist in closing the gap to overcome\nindigenous disadvantage include the following:\n- The Aboriginal Teenage mothers' sustained home\nvisiting project is in place in Redfern and Waterloo.\n- A Pathways Project that documents service\ndelivery pathways to care from maternity hospitals in the Eastern Zone for\npregnant women and family with young children has been completed.\n- Early Childhood Action team formed by NSW\nDepartment of Community Service to support playgroups\n- Connect Redfern\nis providing support to programs such as the Inner\nCity Mobile Playbus\nand Playgroups in the Parks incorporating targeted early literacy and numeracy\nactivities as well as facilitating network and support forums for childcare\nworkers.\n- Redfern Occasional Care\nhas provided an additional 10 baby places.\n- Plans that have explicit literacy and numeracy\ngoals to meet Department of Education and Training targets for Aboriginal\nstudents are in place at Alexandria Park Community School (APCS) and Darlington\nPublic School\n(Aboriginal students make up a significant proportion of these school\ncommunities).\n- The Exodus Foundation Tutorial Centre to improve\nliteracy among disadvantaged children is in operation.\n- Early intervention approaches to literacy e.g.\nReading Recovery is being implemented by APCS and Darlington Public School.\n- Targeted leadership programs for Aboriginal\nstudents are in place at APCS, Green Square School\nand Darlington\nPublic School.\n- Regional student welfare consultant and regional\nconsultant Aboriginal education are acting as initial mentors for Aboriginal\nstudents.\n- Restorative Justice Practices with a strong\nemphasis on Aboriginal students and involving Aboriginal mentors being trialled\nat APCS\n- Mentor\ntraining for Aboriginal Education Aides, Aboriginal tutors and community\nmembers offered.\n- All Aboriginal Department of Community Services\n(DoCS) workers have been trained in Family Decision Making practices.\n- All Aboriginal DoCS workers have committed to\nparticipating in a Family Conferencing model.\n- Redfern Waterloo Case Co-ordination Project\ntargets school attendance for at risk children and young people.\n- Plan-it-Youth (youth mentoring program)\nCoordinator appointed and program is being rolled out at APCS.\n- DoCS Early Intervention Team established to\nsupport improved access to and coordination of services to families in need of\nassistance and improved case management – this includes increased staff numbers\nat Yallamundi the Aboriginal Intensive Family Based service run by DoCS.\n- Family Violence Taskforce established.

This\n100 strong group of men meet on a monthly basis to promote positive involvement\nof Aboriginal men in the local community in a variety of activities and\nprograms.\n- The RWA support and participate in the local\nWomen's group, the Koori Interagency and HACC Koori Advisory Group.\n- RWA have supported a number of NAIDOC week\nactivities in 2005, 2006 and 2007.\n- RWA have supported the Koori Knockout\ncompetition in 2005, 2006 and 2007.\nAn independent qualified consultant has been contracted to\nundertake the review and evaluation of the progress of the Human Services Plan\nPhase One to date.\nAn Evaluation Framework for the Human Services Plan has\nbeen developed and was endorsed by the relevant stakeholders in June 2006.\nThis framework consists of a hierarchy of outcome,\nintermediate and process indicators covering the ten key priority areas.\nKey tasks in developing the Evaluation report will\ninclude:\n- Review of relevant plans and policies including\nthe State Plan 2006 and Two Ways Together for Aboriginal people.\n- Assembly and interpretation of 12 month data on\noutcome indicators compared to baseline data.\n- Assembly and interpretation of 12 month data on\nservice output and intermediate indicators compared to baseline data.\n- Assembly and assessment of agency performance in\nimplementing key actions and strategies, and\n- Consultation with key stakeholders including\ngovernment agencies, non government agencies and community.\nThe draft evaluation report will be prepared for\ncirculation to the Human Services Plan Implementation Senior Officers Group for\ncomment in early March 2008. The Human Services Plan will continue to be\nreviewed and evaluated on a biennial basis to monitor progress and achievement\nof anticipated outcomes for the community of Redfern and Waterloo.\nThe draft Phase Two of the Human Services Plan has been\nthe subject of a community consultation process. The draft Plan proposes to\ncontinue the implementation of Phase One and ensure consistency and\ncomplementarity between actions in the two phases. The draft Plan is currently\nawaiting formal Government endorsement.\nThe draft Phase Two of the Plan is intended to help\nachieve three major priorities under the State Plan: Strengthening Aboriginal\nCommunities, Opportunity and support for the most vulnerable and early\nintervention to tackle disadvantage.\nThe eight draft priority areas are:\n- Improving dementia support;\n- Improving service quality for migrant\ncommunities;\n- Improving access to aged care and health\nservices by Aboriginal people 45 years and older;\n- Reducing homelessness;\n- Improving identification of need and access to\nservices for people with a disability;\n- Reducing social isolation;\n- Improving access to local and community\ntransport for people who are transport disadvantaged; and\n- Improving safety and amenity.\nKey draft actions arising from the priorities are to:\n- Make it easier for older people to access\ndementia services by improving hours of operation;\n- Involve general practitioners in diagnosis, care\nand case management;\n- Increase respite services for carers;\n- Improve access to information through community\nlanguage radio and newspapers;\n- Improve access to English classes for new\nmigrants;\n- Establish a Redfern Community Health Centre to\nimprove the delivery and coordination of health services to the local\ncommunity;\n- Examine the extension of the Seniors Card to\nAboriginal people aged 45 or older;\n- Examine the need for an aged care facility for\nAboriginal people;\n- Increase the number of Aboriginal people working\nin local services;\n- Develop a support service for homeless people\nthat is culturally appropriate and addresses the needs of 'transient' homeless\npeople;\n- Pilot housing models that lead to sustainable\naccommodation;\n- Develop an affordable housing strategy;\n- Ensure modifications to Redfern Railway Station,\nand other infrastructure, cater to people with disability;\n- Undertake community safety audits in public\nhousing estates with the support and assistance of tenants;\n- Give greater consideration to current tenants'\nneeds in the allocation of new tenancies;\n- Introduce an ongoing audit of maintenance in\npublic housing such as repairing lights, doors and removal of graffiti;\n- Involve older people in classroom and school\nactivities;\n- Examine the need for enhanced community\nfacilities in the Redfern-Waterloo area;\n- Trial projects that improve transport access for\nolder people, people with disability, transient people and people with low\nincomes;\n- Improve transport connections to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital\nand shopping venues;\n- Actively engage older people in planning and\nimplementing urban renewal strategies and improving the use of public space;\n- Review current and future Department of Housing\nmaintenance work plans;\n- Improve access to community facilities such as\nlibraries, computer rooms, meeting rooms and community kitchens; and\n- Examine the need for additional aged care\nfacilities in the Redfern-Waterloo area.\nSubject to endorsement by Government, the Human Services\nPlan Phase Two will also have a specific evaluation framework developed to\nreview and evaluate progress. The Evaluation Framework contains a hierarchy of\noutcome indicators, service output or intermediate indicators and process\nindicators representing the core priority areas within the Human Services Plan\nPhase Two enabling performance to be monitored.\nThe Evaluation Framework will be developed in conjunction\nwith agencies following endorsement of the Plan.\nThe experience of the Redfern-Waterloo Authority in its\nrelatively short period of operation is that there are no quick fix solutions\nto the problems of entrenched social and economic disadvantage.\nThe NSW Government's decision to establish an urban\nrenewal authority with a clearly-defined purpose - to prepare and implement a\nlong-term strategic plan for the area's revitalisation - has laid a solid\nfoundation for future growth and prosperity. Essential linkages are being\ncreated to ensure that the benefits of urban renewal are shared by those in\nmost need. However, positive change to the status quo is invariably\nincremental.\nIt is crucial that all tiers of government continue to\nengage with the local community and contribute significantly towards finding\nsolutions to endemic social problems. The local community must also accept its\nshare of responsibility and play a major role.\nThe Indigenous community of Redfern-Waterloo has suffered\nsocial and economic disadvantage over a sustained period of time. While there\nare many success stories which regrettably do not receive due recognition,\nthere is no denying that poverty, lack of opportunity, unemployment, inadequate\ntraining and skills, crime, substance abuse and poor health are factors which\ncontinue to confront the local Indigenous community. These necessarily\ncontribute to the lifetime expectancy gap.\nWithin its available resources, the RWA has deliberately\ntargeted its strategies towards addressing the root causes of Indigenous\ndisadvantage. A major effort is being made to leverage off the employment\nopportunities created by Redfern-Waterloo's new economic growth.\nAs the Employment and Enterprise Plan states:\nThe RWA's employment and enterprise development strategy\naims to directly challenge the area's social and economic disadvantage by\nfostering jobs, educational and life opportunities and a higher standard of\nliving.\nThe RWA sees wealth creation as an antidote to welfare\ndependency. The path to wealth creation through well-paid employment is\neducation – whether this be education at university or through vocational\neducation\nThe early signs are that these innovative strategies have\nnot only been successful, but in some respects they have been life-changing.\nIn the Redfern-Waterloo context, every forward incremental\nstep must be regarded as critically important.\nThe RWA submission contained as Appendices the various\nPlans produced by the RWA.
