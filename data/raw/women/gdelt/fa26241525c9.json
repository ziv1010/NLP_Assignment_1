We take that on the chin.”\nBuilding for the future\nHe said the government was committed to building more houses, building more schools and improving schools. And he said “teachers' pay will go up and we're also making their conditions better”.\n“We're never going to compete directly with the salaries that are paid here,” he said. “We want to make sure that those teachers who want to come home have pathways to come home.”\nHe said the government was also working to see if time spent abroad could be considered when educators move home.\nRecent figures published by Ireland’s central statistics office showed that more than 149,000 people entered Ireland, or immigrated, in the 12 months to April last year – a 16-year high. About 30,000 were Irish citizens returning.\nBut 69,000 people departed Ireland – the highest since 2015 – and including 35,000 Irish citizens.\nIreland has also seen a surge in asylum claims over the past several years.\n“I think those who equate immigration as being the sole issue affecting our housing situation are missing the very real point,” said Mr Richmond.\n“We're not building enough houses,” he said. “I'm not shying away from it.”\nGaza aid effort\nMr Richmond also has responsibility for international development and, on Wednesday will visit the UN Humanitarian Response Depot in Dubai on where Ireland stores significant amounts of humanitarian supplies that are dispatched to Gaza but also other places such as Afghanistan and South Sudan. He said Ireland is keen to ramp up Gaza aid efforts with the UAE.\n“The UAE has a great ability to get humanitarian aid into Gaza,” said Mr Richmond. “And that's the biggest issue – actually getting that aid in.\n“Until recently, we had a number of lorries of Irish humanitarian aid stuck in Jordan for about three months and we want to make sure that we can actually get aid into Gaza,” said Mr Richmond. “And of all the countries that have been able to get humanitarian aid in, the UAE is the best, and we want to make sure that we can work as closely with them.”\nMr Richmond will also meet UAE ministers such as Thani Al Zeyoudi, UAE Minister of Foreign Trade, and Reem Al Hashimy, Minister of State for International Co-operation during the visit and will talk to key members of the Irish business community.\nToday, at least 70 Irish businesses are present in the UAE with more than 200 Irish companies exporting to the UAE market.\nAnother issue for the Irish abroad is securing the ability to vote in presidential elections with an election due next month. Previous governments have announced plans to hold a referendum in Ireland to decide the issue.\n“I think it's a good thing,” he said. “But I don't want to run a referendum I'm going to lose. So that hasn't been cracked yet so we're reflecting.”\nMr Richmond said his message to the Irish community here was that Ireland was “proud” of what they have achieved and the embassy was always there to help.\nAnd for those residents who are thinking of returning, Ireland was “making it easier”.\n“We know we need to do more,” he said. “But we really are going to do more.”",
