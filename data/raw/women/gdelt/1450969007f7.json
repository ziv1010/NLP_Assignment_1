I got the bit between my teeth and I was like: ‘OK, we need to do something about that.’ That’s what I’m probably most proud of in terms of the stuff that we did off the pitch – to change how companies thought of us as athletes and to stop them taking the piss.\n‘The fight for World Cup bonuses was a key moment. We were going into World Cups with no [financial] incentive, no chance of getting any prize money whatsoever.\n‘But we ended up coming away with a biggish bonus for the World Cup in 2015 [when England finished third].\n‘For girls who could never put down a deposit on a house, it was life‑changing. That set the precedent. It became a normal conversation that we would sort the bonuses out well in advance of the tournament.’\nMORE: Drinking alcohol in stands to be trialled at some football matches in England\nMORE: Losing the fans and the dressing room!
