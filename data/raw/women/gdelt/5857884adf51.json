  "body_text": "BRISTOL — The game she loves could have killed Riley McDermott. She knows that now.\nTwo labrum tears in her hips and two resulting surgeries would have been enough to test the heart and soul of any high school athlete. Only would prove to be the precursor of something much, much more serious.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nIt is called Paget Schroetter syndrome. Another weekend travel ball tournament play in the summer of 2022 could have meant amputation of her right arm — or worse.\nBlood clots in two major veins of her upper arm that push blood to her heart ultimately would mean she is missing the first rib on her right side. It also means she would not miss softball for the rest of her life.\n“I feel very lucky,” she said. “I cherish moments differently than in previous years.”\nAs a senior captain, yes, the 4-3 walkoff loss in the Class L quarterfinals Friday to Bristol Central, No. 3 in the state poll, stung.. Riley said the team was closer than ever before, and the tears in her eyes after proved it. One strike away from the semis.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nYet there’s summer ball coming again and next year she will play at Eastern Connecticut.\nYes, she can cherish every moment differently now.\nRiley McDermott was not a soccer girl. She did dance for a time, but that wasn’t her thing. Her brother played baseball, so she tried softball in the second grade. She loved it. She played Ansonia Little League, went to Seymour Tradition for 10-U, then onto the Connecticut Raiders and Connecticut Impact.\nThe softball, the school community, the 15-minute proximity to her family’s home in Ansonia made St. Joseph-Trumbull a good fit.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nThe first torn labrum? That came from pitching in the spring of 2020. She said it was the result of repetitive motion on her landing leg, but there also was a moment while she was working out on her own.\n“I was throwing a drop ball and I landed wrong,” McDermott said.\nShe went to therapy. It wasn’t helping. Surgery was performed in May 2020 on her right hip. She was cleared in October. A month later, she would have surgery on her left hip.\n“I was out running and I felt a pop,” Riley said. “I tore my labrum on the other side. Mainly, it was genetic and repetitive motion more than anything else.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n“The healing time from the surgeries was about the same time, but the pain from the second one was way worse.”\nThe piece of good news is that this happened during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n“I didn’t have to go to school every day and crutch around,” McDermott said. “Doing therapy three times week at Ronai Physical Therapy in Orange and doing my exercise at home made it much easier.”\nAlthough the school was in hybrid stage after her second surgery, she remained home until January. She wanted to fully heal. All was good.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n“I was on a streak of no crazy injury,” she said.\nIn March 2022 she was throwing with a St. Joe’s teammate at practice when she felt something in her shoulder. She had given up pitching after the hip surgeries. The pain didn’t last for more than a week.\nIn June, McDermott played in a tournament with the Impact. There were six games over two days.\n“After the weekend, my upper arm was very swollen,” she said. “A vein in my lower arm became very defined. It was unusual.”\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nThat night Riley went out for a walk with her mom Kimberly and their dog Sophie. They stopped to see her grandmother who lives nearby.\n“She squeezed my arm, which is something that she does (as a show of affection),” Riley said. “I screamed. My mom’s like maybe we should go to Yale ER to get this checked out. I didn’t want to go. Every time we go to the hospital or doctor something bad happens.”\nMcDermott went to the practice the next day in advance of another tournament. Her throws were significantly weaker. This was not good. Despite Riley’s objections, mom took her to Yale. There was blood work. There was an ultrasound. There were all sorts of questions.\n“My mom is in the medical field and she saw some of the bloodwork had come back really high,” McDermott said. “She was hinting it was a blood clot. She was like, ‘I don’t think this is good news, Riley.’”\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nIt wasn’t.\n“It broke me, basically,” she said.\nHer right subclavian vein was completely blocked in two places and her right cephalic vein also was occluded.\n“The ER told me if I had played the next weekend without going to the hospital I could have either had my arm amputated or died on the field. I didn’t believe it at first. I thought he was being over-dramatic.”\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nHe wasn’t.\nRiley was taken to ICU and started on IV blood thinners in preparation for surgery. Originally it was thought the clots came from a case of COVID she had in 2021, which led to asthma complications. A wire was run up her arm to break up the clots. On June 21, McDermott returned to surgery to have the wire taken out.\n“They left it overnight to see if it made a difference,” she said. “It made a difference if my arm was lying flat. But if I raised it above shoulder height it occluded the vein.”\nDr. Cassius Iyad Ochoa Chaar, the vascular surgeon at Yale, determined it was not a genetic issue, but rather Thoracic Outlet Syndrome.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n“I spent the rest of the week in the hospital,” Riley said. “A lot of time trying to explain travel softball and how intensely I had been training and it was my summer to get recruited for college.\n“Dr. Chaar didn't understand that, and he was like you may not be able to go back and play softball again. I’m like, ‘I’m going back …’”\nMcDermott said it wasn’t until Yale pediatric hospitalist Dr. David Hersh, whose daughter Erin also plays travel ball, explained it to him that Chaar better understood the softball dynamics.\nMore specifically, Riley was diagnosed with Paget Schroetter syndrome. Only two people in every 100,000 get it and is prevalent in baseball and softball players, swimmers, wrestlers.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n“Since this could not be controlled with medication and I was determined to play softball, I went back in for my third surgery (on July 5) to remove the first rib on my right side,” she said. “Doing this would give my vein the requisite space it needed to prevent blood clots every time I lift my arm. This was the most painful surgery I have ever had. I had a drain for three days that made me extremely uncomfortable.”\nReleased from the hospital after a week, McDermott remained on blood thinners, which delayed her return to therapy for a month. Then it was off to Ronai again and more exercise at home. She worked with her chiropractor Charlie Benson to prevent arm inflammation. Meanwhile, Riley continued to go to the travel tournaments to cheer on her team. Coach Tom Pia called Riley his “walking miracle.”\nShe came off blood thinners in November and started hitting and fielding. She was ready to return in January and played some winter league. Since then?\n“No problems,” Riley said.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nWith a team of only three seniors, St. Joseph got to the FCIAC championship game and to the state quarterfinals. McDermott worked with a number of the younger players during the fall.\n“Every year we wondered if Riley would be able to play or not,” St. Joseph coach Jeff Babineau said. “But when I got the call over the summer (about the blood clots), your first concern is about her living her life, not worrying about softball.\n“Her determination is something we admire as coaches. The leadership she shows. It’s exciting. She has had a phenomenal year. It’s so great to see her on the field. She is very humble. She doesn’t look for sympathy. The kids recognize this and follow.”\nShe’s the kind of young women who wouldn’t end our conversation without making sure she could publicly thank her mom (“No. 1 supporter”), her coaches, her teammates and her family.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nMcDermott hit .356 with 21 RBI. She made only one error all season at first base. This summer, she will play for Pia on Team Connecticut and work as a counselor at YMCA Camp Teepee in Monroe. And then it’s off to ECSU. She will major in elementary education with plans to become a teacher.\n“I love kids,” she said.\nAnd her grandmother can squeeze her right arm without any pain.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n“She already is,” Riley McDermott said.",
