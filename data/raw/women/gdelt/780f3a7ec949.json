  "body_text": "5 good reasons you should root against the Chiefs in the Super Bowl\nThis is For The Win’s daily newsletter, The Morning Win. Did a friend recommend or forward this to you? If so, subscribe here. Have feedback? Leave your questions, comments and concerns through this brief reader survey! Now, here’s Mike Sykes.\nGood morning, Winners! Welcome back to TMW. Good to see you again on this Monday morning.\nSo we get the Chiefs and the Eagles in the big game again, huh?\nAs an Eagles fan, I am thrilled. I would say I can't believe we got here, but that would be a lie. This team was always good enough to get back to the Super Bowl — it was only a matter of whether it would self-sabotage. They've managed to avoid that so far.\nThe only question is whether they can be good enough to cancel out whatever cockamamie hocus-pocus the Chiefs have going on over there.\nI think we can help with that.\nHave you ever watched Dragon Ball Z? Yes, this is a very random pull. But I promise I'm going somewhere with this.\nEvery time Goku — the main character of the series — is faced with an opponent that just won't die, he has to go deep in his bag and pull out his most potent move: The Spirit Bomb.\nBut the Spirit Bomb is tricky. You can't use it all the time because the only way it becomes more powerful is if all the living beings around you choose to donate their energy to it. If they don't, then the blast is smaller.\nSo this is me, begging you all to donate all of your energy to Jalen Hurts' Spirit Bomb that we absolutely need to send to the Chiefs right now.\nI know this is a tough sell. The Eagles are not the most likeable team in the league. They don't throw the ball all over the yard like the Bengals, or whatever. And Nick Sirianni has a very punchable face. Even the Eagles' fans don't really like him all that much. But, then again, to be fair, Eagles fans don't really like anyone all that much anyway.\nI digress. Look. Guys. We need your energy to make this thing happen. I've come up with five really good reasons why you should root for the Eagles in two weeks on Sunday.\n- Enough is enough. Patrick Mahomes is already the GOAT in my eyes. Ain't y'all tired of seeing him win? Come on, man. They can drop this one and be just fine.\n- And I KNOW y'all are tired of seeing Taylor Swift. Me, personally? She's good money in my book. But, hey, man. The cutaway shots can stop if the Chiefs lose.\n- The Hunt family also sucks. We don't need another Clark Hunt speech where he gets to hold the trophy first like he actually played in the game. Did you know he was voted as the worst owner in the NFL? Do you want to support the worst owner in the NFL? No, you don't.\n- It'll be Saquon Barkley's birthday! Cooper DeJean's, too! And a Super Bowl would be a fantastic gift.\n- A.J. Brown needs a book deal ASAP.\nIf none of those reasons are good enough for you, then just do it for me. I need this. Revenge would be so sweet.\nGo Birds.\nA shakeup in the WNBA\nA blockbuster trade just brought one of the league's best scorers to Las Vegas.\nThe Sparks, Storm, and Aces concocted a three-team deal, sending Kelsey Plum to Los Angeles, Jewell Loyd to Las Vegas and the No. 2 overall pick to Seattle. That's the skinny of it.\nTHE DEEPER DETAILS:Here's Mary Clarke here with more from the trade last night after the news broke.\nIt's far too early to discuss winners and losers in this one. The season doesn't even start until May. Seattle probably made out the best here getting the No. 2 pick.\nBut, man. Las Vegas really broke the band up.\nThere was a strong chance that Kelsey Plum wouldn't be back with Vegas next season. She was entering free agency and would command money that Vegas likely wouldn't be willing to pay.\nI get all of that. But, man. It's going to be strange watching Plum on another team. It's really going to be strange watching Las Vegas without her.\nThat core has been A'ja Wilson, Kelsey Plum and Jackie Young for as long as I can remember it. Chelsea Gray came along later, but those three were the ones who really made the Aces what they were. That group shared so many moments together.\nMy favorite might've been this one.\nVegas is going to miss those vibes. I'm sure LA is happy to have them.\nBig shoutout to Madison Keys\nDon't let all this football distract you from the fact that Madison Keys won her first Grand Slam at the Australian Open over the weekend.\nIt's been a long time coming — Keys was a tennis prodigy who we thought would surely rip off slam after slam through her career.\nIt hasn't really materialized that way. She's always been a great player, but she's never been able to break through. Not until now. And she did it by taking down four top-10 opponents to make it happen, including WTA No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the finals.\nIf we liked it, Lil Wayne loves it.\nShoutout Maddi. Go get another one.\nQuick hits: Josh Allen's worst nightmare ... Patrick Mahomes is living the dream ... and more\n— Josh Allen was so confident going into the Bills' last possession. This is rough. Robert Zeglinski has more.\n— Patrick Mahomes, once again, is calling out his haters. Here's Charles Curtis with more.\n— The Bills' mistake was abandoning James Cook. Christian D'Andrea has more here.\n— Nate Burleson is imploring you to bask in the Chiefs' greatness. Please don't.\n— Have you ever seen a mascot play defense? Well, you have now. Blake Schuster has more.\n— The Commanders may have lost, but we all still won because Dan Snyder is miserable.\nThat's a wrap, folks. Thanks so much for reading today. We appreciate you. Have a fantastic week. Peace.\n-Sykes ✌️",
