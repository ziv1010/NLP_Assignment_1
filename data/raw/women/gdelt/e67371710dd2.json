The team is currently top of League One on goal difference, though the season is still young.\nThe actors are now considering a stake in Welsh Fire, the Cardiff-based The Hundred franchise, which plays at Sophia Gardens, also the home of Glamorgan CCC.\nREAD MORE: Major A55 resurfacing will see 12 days of closures with diversion in place\nREAD MORE: 'Huge response' on 20mph and update on when your local road could change back to 30mph\nGlamorgan will eventually hold a 51% stake in Welsh Fire, which they can control, if the sale of the 49% goes through, and according to the club's chief executive, Dan Cherry, Reynolds and McElhenney have \"made contact\" about purchasing a share of the franchise.\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) aims to raise approximately £500m from the sale of 49% stakes in the eight teams participating in The Hundred. Welsh Fire have the smallest capacity of the eight Hundred franchises and are thought to be the cheapest investment option, worth about £30m.\nWhen asked about interest from Reynolds and McElhenney, Cherry confirmed to ESPN: \"It is a feasible option. Contact's been made.\n\"There's not been anything substantial come back yet, but we're in the process and I know that they'll certainly be included in any process that we've got going forward. All bids and offers that are going to come in are going to be interesting to us, and we're going to have to evaluate what the best bid is for us.\n\"There's obvious interest in what Ryan Reynolds and the guys have done at Wrexham, which has been fantastic for football in North Wales. That doesn't necessarily mean to say that it'll be the right option for us, but if they're interested in talking to us, obviously it's an exciting proposition.\"\nWith their current involvement in Mexican football with Necaxa and Alpine Formula 1 team, Reynolds and McElhenney's potential cricket venture would mark another addition to their expanding sports investment portfolio.\nReynolds has amassed a huge personal fortune over the years, with a reported net worth of £300 million. Despite his incredible success on the big screen, it's some smart financial investments that have earned him the big bucks. Reynolds owned 25% of communications company Mint Mobile and in March 2023 they were sold to T-Mobile for $1.35billion (£1.08billion). The deal is reported to have earned him $300million (£240million).\nIn its ambition to secure investment partners for The Hundred franchises, the ECB has approached a broad scope of parties including all Indian Premier League (IPL) and Women's Premier League (WPL) team owners, NFL team owners, and private equity firms. Other parties interested in buying into the Hundred reportedly include Red Bull and Manchester United joint owners, the Glazers, as well as the owners of Pakistan Super League franchise Multan Sultans.\nSign up for the North Wales Live newsletter sent twice daily to your inbox\nSee the news happening in your area:",
