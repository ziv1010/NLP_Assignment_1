Murdoch Books RRP $55.\nSaffron infusion Za’feran-e dam kardeh\nSaddron is probably the most iconic, defining flavour associated with Iranian cuisine. We pride ourselves on producing the best saffron in the world, although we are rarely recognised for doing so.\nThis is partly due to lack of international marketing, and mostly to sanctions, forcing some Iranian-grown saffron to be exported to Spain, and somehow labelled there as \"Spanish\" saffron. But if you buy your saffron in any Middle Eastern shop around the world, chances are it has been cultivated in Iran, no matter what the label says.\nThe best saffron is farmed in Ghayenat, in the grand and ancient region of Khorasan in the northeast of Iran. \"Khorasan\" means \"where the sun rises\", since it has always been Iran’s most easterly area, even when it contained most of Afghanistan and parts of Central Asia.\nSunrise is also when the delicate purple crocus flowers that yield the saffron threads must be picked — traditionally a job for teenage girls and young women. The vivid red thread-like stigmas, or strands, need to be carefully and swiftly picked out of the crocus flowers within a few hours of harvesting, and then packed. You can recognise high-quality saffron by its colour: the threads or strands will all be deep ruby red, with no orange or yellow parts.\nInfusing is the technique we use in Iran to prepare saffron for all our dishes, both savoury and sweet. We call this infusing \"brewing\" in Persian — the same verb we use for preparing tea and steaming rice. I know there are other methods of preparing saffron as well, but please, whatever you do, don’t use the saffron threads dry and on their own. It’s unforgivably wasteful, because its exquisite flavour and colour are released much better when the threads are infused in warm water. It’s also way too expensive to just sprinkle dry saffron threads on top of dishes, not to mention also a bit obnoxious — especially to those young hands that collected those flowers one morning at sunrise in the east of the world.\nYou can make a larger batch and keep the infusion in the fridge for up to five days — ready to add spoonfuls to your tea, or drizzle over your eggs and pretty much every dish.\nMakes 3 tablespoons saffron infusion\n½ tsp saffron threads, very loosely packed\na good pinch of sugar\nGrind the saffron strands with the sugar in a small mortar. If you don’t have a small mortar, you can put the saffron and sugar on a piece of baking paper, fold all the sides so the powder won’t escape, then grind with a jam jar or rolling pin until you have a very fine powder.\nBoil the kettle, then let it sit for a few minutes. Tip the powder very gently into a small glass teacup, then gently pour 3 tablespoons of the hot water over it (never use boiling water, or you’ll \"kill\" the saffron). Cover the cup with a lid or saucer and let the mixture \"brew\" for at least 10 minutes without removing the lid, to release the colour and aroma of the saffron. After this time your saffron infusion is ready to use.\nIf you make a larger batch, store the leftovers in a clean sealed jar in the fridge for 4–5 days. You can also add any leftover saffron infusion to your regular cup of tea.\nGolden onion PIAZ dagh\n\"Know that onion is the flavour of all that one cooks, and it is to all ‘khoresh’ [stews] what is soul to the body. For a body without a soul is no more than a rock, or a log.\" — Nadder Mirza Qajar (1883) Karname-ye Khoresh.\nI meant to say fried onion is what \"soffritto\" is to Italian cooking, but that would be an understatement, since the Iranian \"piaz dagh\" (golden onion) appears in a greater variety of dishes, both as a foundation to build the dish upon, and as a garnish on top.\nThe important characteristic of Iranian golden onion is that simply sweating and sauteing onions won’t be enough. The onions need to be sliced, then fried in one layer in hot oil for about 10 minutes, until they turn golden. You also need a neutral-flavoured oil with a high smoke point, such as sunflower or peanut oil. It’s handy to have golden onion at the ready when you’re cooking Iranian dishes, so making a bigger batch is a good idea. It takes some time to slice and fry all the onion, but it will keep in the fridge for a couple of days, and you can also freeze some.\nThe general rule of thumb is one medium onion makes 1 tablespoon of fried golden onion. So if your recipe asks for 2 tablespoons of golden onion, it means you’ll need to fry two onions with a dash of ground turmeric.\nIf your recipe starts with golden onion, fry your onion in the same pot you’ll be cooking the rest of the dish in.\nMakes 2 tablespoons\noil, for deep-frying (the quantity will depend on the size of your pan)\n2 onions, halved, then sliced 5mm thick\n¼ tsp ground turmeric\nMethod\nIn a large pan suitable for frying, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Make sure the onion half-rings are separated from each other. When tiny bubbles appear in the oil, add one slice of onion to check the heat. If the oil around the onion bubbles and the onion comes to the surface, the oil is hot enough; otherwise, wait until this happens.\nUsually, two sliced onions can be fried in two or three batches, in a 23cm pan. If your pan is smaller, you should fry the onions in more batches. This is actually time saving, because one layer of onion fries more quickly, and piled-up onions become soggy and take more time to become golden and crunchy.\nFry each batch over medium-high heat for about 8-12 minutes, or until the onion has shrunk down and is completely golden. At the last moment for the first batch, add all the turmeric, stir around a bit, then with a slotted spoon transfer the onion to a large dish lined with a paper towel. The onion will darken once removed from the pan, turning golden brown on the paper. Add another batch of onion to the pan and repeat. For this amount of onion, the turmeric added to the oil at the end of the first batch is enough — if you’re making more than this amount, add a dash more turmeric each second or third batch. You can keep the frying oil for a week for frying up more golden onion, or to use in dishes where a hint of onion and turmeric would be welcome.\nYou can keep the golden onion in the fridge in an airtight container for 3-4 days, or freeze for up to 3 months. If using frozen golden onion, you won’t need to thaw it — just break off a piece and add it to the hot pan. It will just take a little longer to cook.\nAn orange-scented rice cake Torta di riso al profumo d’arancio\nThere is something universal about cooking rice in milk that translates to instant comfort — a soothing embrace that goes beyond borders and cultures and unifies them in silky sweetness. People everywhere make some form of rice pudding.\nRice pudding goes by a literal name almost everywhere: shir berenj in Persian, riz bel halib in Arabic, sultac in Turkish, rizogalo in Greek, and budino di riso in Italian.\nMore than the density or the temperature it’s served at, what makes the rice pudding of each region distinct are the aromatics and spices used. In Iran, rosewater is often used; and when made with saffron, the rice pudding is cooked in water rather than milk and becomes sholeh zard. Sometimes a few cardamom pods are added too.\nIn Lebanon, Syria and other parts of the Levant, rosewater, orange blossom water or both are used. Orange zest, a continuation of orange blossom water, also starts appearing here, with citrus coming forth more often in southern Italy and Spain, as a souvenir of the Arabs who first brought them here. The more we travel west, the more present vanilla becomes.\nThe following recipe is, by all accounts, just another rice pudding, with an addition of eggs, then baked. I am not sure about its origins, but I have eaten similar cakes both in Bologna and in the region of Campania.\nWhen it comes to orange-flavoured cakes that lie halfway between a cake and pudding, I can’t not think of the famous almond and orange cake of the legendary Claudia Roden. She first wrote about it in A Book of Middle Eastern Food, and it has inspired and obsessed many home bakers and cookery writers alike — including me. Two oranges are boiled whole, then blended with ground almonds, eggs and sugar, then baked for about an hour. The cake is an absolute delight that I bake several times each winter.\nMore fascinating still is the journey of that cake, which Roden calls a \"Judeo–Spanish cake\". Roden, a Jewish Egyptian, says she was given the recipe by her sister-in-law, who in turn learned it from her grandmother — who grew up in Aleppo, Syria.\nI would not be surprised if this orange-scented rice pudding cake had a similar journey, travelling full circle, coming back home after a long time away.\nMakes a 26cm cake\nIngredients\n1.7 litres full-fat milk\n180g sugar\nZest of ½ lemon, cut into large strips with a vegetable peeler\n300g risotto rice, such as arborio, carnaroli or vialone nano\n½ tsp salt\nButter, for greasing\n5 eggs, separated\n50ml orange liqueur (I use Cointreau)\n3 tsp vanilla extract or paste\nZest of 1 orange, plus extra to garnish\n40g candied orange zest, diced\nicing (confectioners’) sugar, for dusting\nIn a large saucepan, bring the milk, sugar and lemon zest to a moderate boil. Stir in the rice and salt.\nCook over medium heat for 30–40 minutes, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is sticky and creamy, stirring occasionally so the rice doesn’t stick. Remember that the mixture will become thicker as it cools. If it looks like the liquid is being absorbed before the rice is completely cooked through, reduce the heat. Transfer to a large bowl and leave to cool completely.\nPreheat the oven to 180°C . Lightly grease a round 26 cm cake tin with butter. Line the bottom and sides with baking paper, then rub a bit more butter on to the paper. Remove as many lemon zest pieces from the cooled rice as you can find.\nUsing a hand whisk, beat the egg yolks with the liqueur, vanilla and orange zest, then add to the rice with the candied orange zest and mix well.\nUsing a clean whisk and a very clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff and smooth, then gently fold them through the batter.\nCarefully pour the mixture into the cake tin and smooth the top with a knife. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the top is golden.\nRemove from the oven, then leave to cool completely in the tin for about an hour before unmoulding.\nBefore serving, dust with icing sugar, and garnish with extra orange zest. The cake will keep in an airtight container for a few days, refrigerated if the weather is hot.\nRoasted pumpkin and shallots, toasted hazelnuts and soft cheese\nServes 3–4\nIngredients\n700g-800g butternut pumpkin (squash), kabocha or mantovana squash, peeled and chopped into 3cm cubes\n3 French shallots, peeled, with the roots left on, then quartered lengthways\n1-2 tsp salt, plus extra for seasoning\nolive oil, for cooking and drizzling\n2 rosemary sprigs\n250g farro\n⅓ cup (50g) hazelnuts\nZest and juice of ½ lemon\n1 tsp white vinegar\nFreshly ground black pepper, to taste\n200g soft cheese, such as robiola or goat’s cheese\n1½ tsp balsamic vinegar\nMethod\nPreheat the oven to 200°C. Put the pumpkin and shallot on a large baking tray with ½ tsp of the salt, 2 Tbsp olive oil and the rosemary sprigs.\nToss to coat the vegetables, then arrange them on the tray so they’re not overlapping. Roast for about 30 minutes, or until the shallots are soft with some brown edges. Remove the shallots and, if necessary, roast the pumpkin for another 10–30 minutes, until soft with some brown edges.\nMeanwhile, cook the farro in a saucepan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions; this usually takes about 30 minutes. Drain the farro, place in a large bowl and toss with about 1 Tbsp olive oil, so it doesn’t dry out.\nToast the hazelnuts in a hot frying pan for just a few minutes until lightly browned, and fragrant with an earthy aroma. Remove immediately to a chopping board so the nuts don’t burn, leave until cool enough to handle, then coarsely chop.\nAdd the toasted hazelnuts to the farro with the roasted pumpkin and shallot (discard the rosemary twigs). Toss with the lemon zest and juice, white vinegar and another 2 Tbsp olive oil, then season to taste with salt and black pepper.\nPile the salad on to a shallow platter. Crumble the cheese into large chunks over the salad and drizzle with the balsamic vinegar; of course, another drizzle of olive oil never hurts.\nYou can keep this salad in the fridge for a couple of days; save the cheese for serving.\nSaffron roast chicken stuffed with dried fruit Morgh-e shekam por\nIn all cultures, sitting down to feast on a whole roast chicken, stuffed or otherwise, brings about feelings of comfort and abundance. Until not so long ago, beheading one of the family’s precious chickens for lunch was a luxury only few could afford, and for festive occasions alone.\nWhile a roast chicken has become an easy casual dinner — something you’d happily eat with your hands, then lick those juices off your fingers and lips — a properly stuffed saffron roast chicken on an Iranian table still holds some prestige and elegance, albeit with the same joyful finger licking.\nThe roast chicken would be like the golden centrepiece of a lavish spread for a gathering, next to trays of rice — of at least two kinds, one simple, perhaps another with broad beans and dill — and possibly lamb stew with courgette or aubergine.\nI am very fond of this filling for roast chicken, not only because of the richness of sweet and sour flavours from the dried fruit, but because it reminds me of the mehmooni (family gatherings) of my aunt, who has been living in Germany with her family for about 20 years now. She snatched the Azeri-inspired recipe from my grandmother, of course, and, being more daring than my mum in all matters in life, ended up being the only sister who could pull off two stuffed roast chickens to serve to her guests.\nMy mum stuck to her fail-safe khoresh — stews — which gained her the reputation of an excellent cook among family and friends.\nFor the chicken\n1 whole chicken, bout 1.8kg\n1 ½ Tbsp salt\n1 lemon, halved\nFor the stuffing\n1 cup (200 g) prunes, pitted\n½ cup (100 g) dried apricots, halved\n⅔ cup (100 g) dried barberries or cranberries\n30g butter\n⅔ cup (80 g) walnuts, coarsely chopped\n⅓ cup (50 g) golden sultanas (optional)\n1 tsp sugar (if using barberries)\n2 Tbsp golden onion (see below)\n2 Tbsp saffron infusion (see left)\n½ tsp salt\n¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper\nFor the saffron butter\n100g butter\n3 Tbsp saffron infusion (see left)\n1½ tsp salt\nSeveral hours before cooking, or even the night before, pat the chicken dry with paper towel. Rub the salt on the chicken skin and in the cavity. Squeeze the lemon juice into the cavity of the chicken and leave the squeezed lemon inside the cavity. Leave to rest in the fridge, preferably uncovered.\nAbout 2 hours before cooking, bring the chicken out of the fridge and let it reach room temperature. Discard the lemon.\nFor the stuffing, soak the prunes, apricots and cranberries in water in separate little bowls for 15–30 minutes. If using barberries, simply rinse them with water.\nMelt most of the butter in a pan. Drain the prunes, apricots and cranberries, then add to the pan with the walnuts and sultanas.\nCook over a gentle heat for a few minutes. If you’re using barberries, melt the remaining butter in a small pan, add the barberries and cook for a minute or two over low heat; add the sugar and keep stirring until it dissolves, then mix with the rest of the fruit. Add the golden onion, saffron infusion, salt and pepper. Give it a stir for 2 minutes, then take off the heat.\nPreheat the oven to 220°C .\nFor the saffron butter, melt the butter and mix well with the saffron infusion and salt.\nTo prepare the chicken for the saffron butter rub, first put it on one side, then use a sharp knife to score three deep incisions on one leg. Turn the chicken around and repeat with the other leg.\nThis will allow the legs and breast to cook at the same time.\nWith the chicken legs facing you, gently pull the skin at the end of the breast towards you with one hand, then insert two fingers of the other hand between the breast and skin. Repeat this carefully and gently, as much as you can, to separate the skin from the meat without tearing it.\nFill the cavity with about half the stuffing, reserving the rest for serving. Tie the chicken legs together with butchers’ twine and place it in a baking dish.\nUsing a pastry brush, rub as much as the saffron butter as you can on all sides of the chicken, and under the skin.\nTransfer to the oven and roast for about 1 hour 20 minutes, brushing the chicken with more saffron butter every 30 minutes. Once the chicken is cooked through, remove from the oven and leave to rest for at least 30 minutes.\nTo serve, strain the juices at the bottom of the dish, and use about ¼ cup (60 ml) to heat the remaining stuffing to use as a garnish. Pour the remaining juices into a gravy boat to serve alongside the chicken.\nServe with jewelled rice or sour cherry pilaf , although since it’s stuffed with dried fruit, I prefer plain rice. You could also serve it with roast potatoes.",
