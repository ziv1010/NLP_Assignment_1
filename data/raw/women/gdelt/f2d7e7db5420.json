It was widely expected to unfold in Las Vegas, home to the 1994 draw when the U.S. last hosted the World Cup and a natural backdrop for glitz. But since at least March, officials had privately discussed bringing the draw to Washington, home to a showman president who regularly hugs the spotlight associated with sports.\nSo during that July match in the stadium that will also host the final game of next year's World Cup, Trump and Infantino agreed to get going on holding the draw in the U.S. capital - namely, the Kennedy Center, another institution that Trump reshaped to his liking.\n\"During that Club World Cup final, there was a real seriousness to well, look, if we're going to do this, we've got to do it now,\" Andrew Giuliani, executive director of the White House FIFA task force, told The Associated Press. \"That's when talks heated up between the president and Mr. Infantino in terms of getting this done.\"\nThe collaboration over the draw, slated for Dec. 5, illustrates the bond that has formed between Trump and Infantino, described by the U.S. president as \"probably the most respected man in sports.\" The relationship will come into even sharper focus as the World Cup approaches, jointly hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada.\nAlso read: Trump invites global fans to World Cup and Olympics as US tightens visa policies\nTrump and Infantino develop a deep alliance\nDespite his affinity for sports, Trump is known more for his ties to golf and football than soccer. But his awareness of the sport was spurred in part by his youngest son, Barron, who is such a soccer fan that he had a net in the first lady's garden during Trump's first term. Trump's interest only grew when the U.S. won World Cup hosting rights in 2018. Shortly after the U.S. was awarded the tournament, Trump hosted Infantino at the White House. The relationship flourished in 2020 as both men plotted their futures.\nDuring a dinner that January at the global economic summit in Davos, near FIFA's home in Zurich, Infantino called the U.S. president \"my great friend.\" Trump, always appreciative of a compliment, responded by inviting Infantino to a White House signing event for the Abraham Accords, which sought to normalize diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab countries.\nThe FIFA leader has made sure to cultivate close ties with nations hosting the World Cup.\nInfantino appeared to relish public meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin before, during and after that country hosted the 2018 World Cup. He would later relocate to Doha ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, emerging as a strong defender of the tiny Gulf state that was fiercely criticized for its treatment of the hundreds of thousands of migrant workers needed to build essential stadiums, transport projects and hotels.\nInfantino has framed his close relationship with Trump as \"crucial\" to the success of the World Cup, a massive operation that relies on expansive cooperation with federal, state and local governments.\nAlso read: FIFA can’t solve geopolitical problems: Gianni Infantino\nInfantino's connections to Biden were far more limited\nAs the connection between Trump and Infantino deepened, Joe Biden dashed Trump's hopes of staying in the White House. For the next four years, Infantino's ties to Washington were far more limited. The two leaders had a brief meeting on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022.Second gentleman Douglas Emhoff also met with Infantino when he traveled for the Women's World Cup in July 2023.\nPreparations for the World Cup under Biden were under the radar by design, according to one senior official for that administration who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Even though the administration had its own World Cup 2026 task force, Biden aides were aware of sensitivities surrounding large gatherings so soon after the COVID-19 pandemic. They also were careful not to overtly promote a relationship with FIFA, which had sidelined the U.S. Soccer Federation in its traditional role in coordinating a home World Cup.\nAlso read: Trump to shift FIFA World Cup venues: What He Said About Seattle, San Francisco, and potential alternate cities\nTrump's return sets the stage for a 'MAGA' World Cup\nTrump's disappointment about missing out on the World Cup would prove to be unfounded after he was elected to a second, nonconsecutive term last year.Since that victory, Infantino's embrace of Trump has been gushing. He promptly congratulated him the day after Election Day, was at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's South Florida club, during the presidential transition and had a prime seat at his January inauguration. Trump called Infantino a \"winner\" in a video played at the Miami draw for the Club World Cup in December, which was attended by daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\nInfantino has had more public appearances with Trump than with any soccer officials from the sport's heartlands of Europe and South America, according to the FIFA leader's schedule and social media posts.\nDuring Infantino's most recent appearance at Trump's side in the Oval Office on Aug. 22, he took even some fellow soccer officials by surprise when he gifted a gold replica World Cup trophy to the U.S. president.\nThat handover was unexpected, according to one senior soccer official who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive dynamics. Even though it was a replica, the moment was still seen as a snub of World Cup tradition because Trump has held onto a trophy that is supposed to belong to the sport as a whole, not an individual person.\nA White House official said the trophy remains in the White House's possession. No such offer was publicly extended by FIFA to Mexico's President Claudia Scheinbaum or Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney. Infantino has not met with Carney this year and met Sheinbaum for the first time on Aug. 29.",
