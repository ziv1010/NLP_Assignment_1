  "body_text": "Defending champions Spartans clinched back-to-back Showtime Bowl titles after defeating Warriors in the final to claim the N6m grand prize at the Showtime Arena on Sunday night.\nDespite suffering a defeat to Warriors earlier in the campaign, Spartans bounced back to end their opponents’ impressive 11-game unbeaten run and retain their crown in an intense final.\nThe victory saw Spartans claim the lion’s share of the record N20m prize pool, with Warriors receiving N4m as runners-up, while Rebels and Outlaws secured N2.5m each for finishing third and fourth respectively.\nSpartans owner Otu Henshaw admitted his team’s slow start to the season forced them to make tactical adjustments.\n“We had a rough start to this season. We stumbled and lost games because everyone knows our team and our tactics, so we had to change things up,” Henshaw said.\n“This sport is about togetherness, teamwork and building culture. What I try to tell all my younger players is that the lessons learned here, they’ll carry throughout their lifetime. It’s been very tough, we’ve had some bad injuries with one of our players breaking his collarbone.”\nLeague Commissioner Adebare Adejumo hailed the growth of flag football in Nigeria, describing the season as a movement that has redefined the sport in Africa.\n“This season has been spectacular. What we’ve given to Nigerians is proof that flag football is currently the most inclusive sport. That’s why we have the co-ed version that we play, with both men and women participating,” Adejumo said.\n“This sport shows that no matter where you come from or what your age is, you can participate. This is the first professional league in the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, if not the entire continent.”\nSpartans wide receiver Theodora Amadiuke revealed the team’s determination to retain their title despite early doubts saying, “To be honest, it was a rough start, simply because there were new sets of rules that were hard for us to adjust to because of our style of play.\n“Many people doubted us, saying we couldn’t make it. The competition against Warriors in the final was incredibly intense. They had a fantastic season. We were close, but we were more hungry. When you’re competing against people who want your spot, you have to take a stand, and that’s exactly what we did.”\nNigerian music legend Rudeboy closed the night with a concert that capped off a season that combined sports and entertainment.\nOther teams that earned prize money include Mavericks, LA Knights, Titans and Raptors, who received N1m each for finishing between fifth and eighth positions, while Hawks (N400,000), Panthers (N300,000), Wolverines (N200,000) and Off-szn Athletics (N100,000) completed the prize list.",
