That’s how it happened and 10 years later here I am.”\nFormer firefighter Allison, who has previously spoken about encouraging more officials from under-represented backgrounds, was promoted to the Football League in 2020 and was moved up to the Championship earlier this year.\nWelch has also refereed in the Championship this year, as well as taking charge of Women's Super League and Women's Champions League matches and refereeing at the Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in the summer.\nRebecca Welch made history earlier this year when she became the first woman to be appointed to referee a game in the English Football League.\nShe was the first woman to take charge of an FA Cup third-round tie in 2022 after being added to the EFL's national list for men's football, which oversees both League One and League Two fixtures.\nWelch made history in November when she became the first woman to be involved in the Premier League in a refereeing capacity, taking up the role of fourth official when Manchester United beat Fulham 1-0 at Craven Cottage.\nHistory will be made in the Premier League this Christmas...\n— Premier League (@premierleague) December 14, 2023\nRebecca Welch will become the competition's first woman referee and Sam Allison the first black official to take charge of a match for 15 years 👇\nPremier League's first black referee in 15 years\nSam Allison will also take charge of a top-flight match in December, making him the Premier League's first black referee in 15 years according to the BBC.\nHe will oversee Sheffield United's match against Fulham on 26 December.\nUriah Rennie - the league's last black referee - retired from officiating in English football's top four divisions in 2009. The EFL's last non-white referee - Jarnail Singh - retired in 2010.\nIn July, the Football Association laid out plans to recruit 50% more referees from \"historically under-represented\" backgrounds by 2026, targeting an increase of 1,000 women referees and 1,000 black or Asian referees at all levels of football in three years.\nCurrently, 8% of officials are of black or Asian ethnicity, but only 3% in professional football. No black or Asian referee has taken charge of a Premier League game since Rennie's final match in 2008.",
