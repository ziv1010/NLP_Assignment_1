  "body_text": "The 25+ Best TV Shows on Paramount+\nPhoto Courtesy of Comedy CentralParamount+ is no small startup—it’s the premium streaming arm of Paramount (formerly known as ViacomCBS), a media megacorp that owns networks like CBS, MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, BET, Comedy Central, and more. Like Max, Paramount+ is not just a collection of TV properties, but also movies, news, and sports from the company’s vast empire. It’s also a rebrand of CBS All Access; basically, if you liked CBS All Access (and/or subscribed to it), you can tumble into Paramount+ and see all of your favorites.\nHowever, to offer you a little guidance, we’ve curated a list of the best shows to check out, including a few groupings of series (including classic TV, nostalgic programming, and more), which is why we made the list 25+. Because who doesn’t love a Plus, apparently? It’s also worth noting for sports fans that Paramount+ carries various games, tournaments, matches, etc. from around the world (the list includes: NFL, NCAA college football and basketball, Masters, PGA TOUR, The PGA Championship, UEFA Champions League, Serie A, UEFA Europa League, National Women’s Soccer League, and AFC Asian Cup).\nIn the U.S., Paramount+ has two pricing tiers: The Paramount+ Essential plan (formerly known as Essential) features limited commercials and will only set you back $5.99 per month. Meanwhile, the Paramount+ with Showtime subscription is the service’s ad-free tier and will cost you $11.99 per month. However, we did not include any Showtime programming on the list since it requires the additional cost to view. The app is currently available on all major carriers, including Apple products and Android, Chromecast, FireTV, Roku, Samsung, Vizio, Xfinity, as well as Xbox and Playstation.\nDetroiters\nCreated by: Zach Kanin, Joe Kelly, Sam Richardson\nStars: Sam Richardson, Tim Robinson, Pat Ver Harris, Lailani Ledesma\nThe key to Detroiters is its sincerity, which shines through almost every episode without any kind of smugness or self-congratulations. Sam Richardson (Ted Lasso, Veep) and Tim Robinson (Saturday Night Live, I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson) genuinely love each other, and their families, and their advertising company, and most of all their city. (It’s Detroit. Detroit, Michigan. That’s where they’re from.) The tone gets dark at times, and Tim and Sam occasionally act petty or vindictive, but there’s almost none of the cynicism and mean-spiritedness so often found in comedy today. When they’re making illicit purchases in a back alley at night with Tim’s sanity-challenged father, they’re not buying drugs, but fireworks. When Sam unintentionally becomes a gigolo, it takes him a while to realize it, and he’s convinced he’s in love with his only client. When they accidentally run over prospective client Jason Sudeikis, it gnaws at them until they inevitably let Sudeikis run them over as penance. Without this sweetness, Detroiters would probably still be funny, but it wouldn’t be as charming or as powerful. —Garrett Martin\nReview\nCreated by / Stars: Andy Daly\nNo half-hour comedy has ever broken my heart quite like Review, or even come close. Perhaps that’s why Andy Daly’s brilliant, pitch-black Comedy Central series didn’t make it past an abbreviated Season 3—the show parlayed its silly, meta premise into a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions. If that reads as overblown, then you, like too many people for Comedy Central’s liking, clearly have not seen Review. The show, in which fictional TV show host and “life critic” Forrest MacNeil (Daly) reviews viewer-submitted experiences with a zeal that can only be described as catastrophic, is the story of a good but woefully misguided man, undone by his own desperate search for meaning. To its adoring audience, Review will likely be remembered as the most inimitable show Comedy Central has ever aired. —Scott Russell\nAvatar: The Last Airbender\nCreated by: Michael Dante DiMartino Bryan Konietzko\nStars: Zach Tyler Eisen, Mae Whitman, Jack DeSena, Jessie Flower, Dee Bradley Baker, Mako, Grey DeLisle, Mark Hamill\nDon’t be put off by M. Night Shayamalan’s clunky 2010 live-action adaptation. This richly animated TV series merges the wild imagination of Hayao Miyazaki, the world-building of the most epic anime stories, and the humor of some of the more offbeat Cartoon Network originals. Following the exploits of the Avatar, the boy savior Aang who can control all four of the elements—fire, water, earth and wind—the series is filled with political intrigue, personal growth, and unending challenges. Spirits and strange hybrid animals present dangers, but so do the people who seek power for themselves. This is one you’ll enjoy watching with your kids or on your own. —Josh Jackson\nEvil\nCreated by: Robert King and Michelle King\nStars: Katja Herbers, Mike Colter, Aasif Mandvi, Kurt Fuller, Marti Matulis, Brooklyn Shuck\nEvil moved to Paramount+ from CBS ahead of its third season, but we still can’t believe the same network that airs, like, 50 different versions of NCIS ever aired this meditation on evil from the same people who brought you The Good Wife. Kristen Bouchard (Katja Herbers) is a forensic psychologist who becomes something of a believer when she meets priest-in-training David Acosta (Mike Colter) and tech expert Ben (Aasif Mandvi) and they begin to investigate the inexplicable. The always creepy (in the best way) Michael Emerson is also on hand as Leland Townsend, a mysterious character who epitomizes the title of the series. Truly, my only complaint about this drama, which gets better with each passing episode, is that may be too creepy for me. The show produces the kind of scares that stay with you long after the lights go out. —Amy Amatangelo\nNathan for You\nCreated by: Nathan Fielder, Michael Koman\nStars: Nathan Fielder\nFor two seasons, Nathan for You was something warped, uncomfortable, and ultimately refreshing. Ideas like “Dumb Starbucks” went viral, making it increasingly difficult for Fielder to use relative anonymity to convince his “clients” to go along with his disturbingly effective ideas. It wasn’t totally original TV, but there did seem to be a certain sincerity under it all, Fielder doing his best to never exploit the people he helped for the benefit of a good joke, hoping that somehow, at the very least, he could drum up attention for the suffering businesses. But the third season of Nathan for You is something so much more sublime: Over the course of eight episodes, Nathan contrived a fake exercise program replete with a fake creator to dredge up free labor for a moving company, created a sound-proof box for imprisoning children while their parents have sex in hotel rooms (which he tested with a porn star orgy), and devised a way for a dive bar to allow smokers inside through turning a typical night of patronization into an experimental bit of theater—all the while transforming each client interaction into a desperate bid to make a friend. It’s even in “Nail Salon/Fun” that Nathan finally admits he doesn’t have many friends, even though he’s actually a really fun guy to hang out with, so he concocts a plan to scientifically validate he’s an entertaining human, which of course involves stealing the urine of his new friend and suggesting on a lark they go get blood drawn together. It’s all so much more than cringe-worthy faux-documentary pranking; in Season 3, Nathan for You stumbled into the sublime, taking to task the pathetic, empty human connections at the heart of even the most basic tenets of capitalism. —Dom Sinacola\nJoe Pickett\nDeveloped by: John Erick Dowdle, Drew Dowdle\nStars: Michael Dorman, Julianna Guill, Sharon Lawrence, Paul Sparks, Mustafa Speaks, David Alan Grier\nJoe Pickett might just feature my new favorite TV family. The Picketts are one part Little House on the Prairie and one part Far Cry 5. They’re as ready and willing to strike up a cowboy song during a prairie picnic as they are to pick up the nearest rifle, shotgun, or hunting knife to defend kith and kin. They take their lead from patriarch and show namesake Joe Pickett, a hard-luck Wyoming game warden who loves his family, his job, and the wild animals that roam Yellowstone’s peaks and valleys, in that order. (Cowboy hats off to the prop and VFX department for bringing realistic emus, eagles, and elk to life—or death—without involving real animals.) The only things Joe hates about his job are the bureaucracy, the meager pay, and members of the seedy underbelly of nearby Saddlestring who will go to unimaginable lengths to consolidate their wealth and power. Not on Joe’s watch.\nBased on the novels by C.J. Box, Joe Pickett scratches the Western itch without the grimdark drama of similar shows, offering up a balance of vengeful violence and wholesome family values in equal measure. Put it on your must-watch Dad TV list. —Dave Trumbore\nGhosts\nDeveloped by: Joe Port, Joe Wiseman\nStars: Rose McIver, Utkarsh Ambudkar, Brandon Scott Jones, Richie Moriarty, Asher Grodman, Rebecca Wisocky, Sheila Carrasco, Danielle Pinnock, Roman Zaragoza, Devan Chandler Long\nBased on the U.K. series of the same name, the delightful Ghosts is a bona fide hit for CBS. But if you’re an elder Millennial, you could be knocked over with a feather to learn this is one of TV’s best series. And yet, don’t sleep on it. Ghosts follows a young couple, Samantha and Jay (Rose McIver and Utkarsh Ambudkar), who inherit a large country estate that is, turns out, filled with ghosts only Sam (after she goes through a near-death experience) can see and hear. These ghosts aren’t scary though, they’re mostly friendly and occasionally annoying in their demands to smell bacon or have Sam turn on the TV. They also make for a fantastic comedy ensemble. Comprised of a small percentage of those who have died on the estate’s property from the beginning of time, the ghosts rule the roost: Bossy Revolutionary War soldier Isaac (Brandon Scott Jones), kind Boy Scout leader Pete (Richie Moriarty), pants-less Wall Street bro Trevor (Asher Grodman), uptight lady of the manor Hetty (Rebecca Wisocky), certified hippie Flower (Sheila Carrasco), flamboyant jazz singer Alberta (Danielle Pinnock), deadpan Lenape tribesman Sasappis (Roman Zaragoza), and the oldest of all the ghosts, Thorfinn (Devan Chandler Long), a Viking.\nAs Sam and Jay work to establish a B&B, the ghosts both help and hinder the process in earnestly funny ways. The charming CBS series is not quite as cozy as the UK’s version, and features a few early hallmarks of American sitcom formatting that can feel heavy-handed, but when it hits, it really hits. Best of all, Ghosts is typically family-friendly enough for everyone to enjoy. —Allison Keene\nFrasier\nCreated by: David Angell, Peter Casey, David Lee\nStars: Kelsey Grammer, David Hyde Pierce, Jane Leeves, John Mahoney, Peri Gilpin\nWatch the Original on Paramount+\nWatch the Revival on Paramount+\nThe beloved sitcom Frasier owes its existence to the beloved sitcom Cheers, as the spinoff sees Kelsey Grammer’s Frasier Crane relocate from Boston to Seattle in an attempt to start over after his divorce. But while many classic sitcoms are paeans to blue-collar family life, Frasier was the odd show that made cultural elites and eggheads somehow seem like lovable characters to a mass audience. Both Frasier and his brother Niles (David Hyde Pierce) could be infuriatingly snobbish, but audiences soon found that when their petty jealousies were directed at each other, they could also be hilarious. The show quickly became an off-hand representation of the idea of “smart comedy” on TV, but it was also still a sitcom full of relationship humor. Viewers waited a hell of a long time in particular for the long-teased relationship between Niles and Daphne (Jane Leeves) to finally come to fruition (seven full seasons). Frasier, on the other hand, was never really lucky in love, but he was always better as a semi-depressed single, turning his probing mind on himself. There is a reason it ran for 11 seasons and became one of the most successful spinoffs in TV history. And perhaps that’s why it returned in 2023.\nIn the revival, Frasier returns to Boston to be a guest lecturer at Harvard University where his old friend Alan (Nicholas Lyndhurst) is a tenured professor and his nephew David (Anders Keith) is a student. Much to his chagrin, Frasier’s son Freddy (Jack Cutmore-Scott) has forgone a Harvard education in favor of being a Boston firefighter. Rounding out the cast are Toks Olagundoye as Olivia, the head of Harvard’s psychology department, and Jess Salgueiro as Freddy’s roommate Eve. The through-lines and similarities to the original series are pretty direct: David is Niles; Freddy is Martin; Alan and Olivia together are Roz; and Eve is Daphne. But here’s the thing: the show totally works. The comedic beats, witty repartee, and comedy of errors-pratfalls and misunderstandings are all still there. —Jim Vorel, Kaitlin Thomas, and Amy Amatangelo\nCorporate\nCreated by: Pat Bishop, Matt Ingebretson, Jake Weisman\nStars: Matt Ingebretson, Jake Weisman, Anne Dudek, Adam Lustick, Aparna Nancherla, Lance Reddick\nFor everyone who’s had a soul-crushing job where they can almost feel the walls closing in on them. For those who’ve sat in the office parking garage on Monday mornings and wondered if this would be the week that their guilt over their company’s environmental and/or human safety conditions finally broke them enough to quit their mid-level executive gig. For all the HR people who nod as workers blubber about unfair conditions, but who secretly know their mission is to protect the business at all costs. For the two Yes Men who know only one of them is actually needed on the payroll. For these people and more, creators Pat Bishop, Matt Ingebretson and Jake Weisman’s Comedy Central series is for you (and not at all for your human steroid of a CEO). —Whitney Friedlander\nSurvivor\nCreated by: Charlie Parsons\nHosted by: Jeff Probst\nSurvivors ready? Stream! There’s never a bad time to watch Survivor, one of the most famous reality competitions of all time. Host Jeff Probst lures Americans to a location far from their home, forcing them to live off of rice and canteen water for just over a month. All the while, they battle on another in two or three tribes full of strangers, going head-to-head in physical and mental mini-games that protect them from Tribal Council. But Tribal Council is inevitable: One way or another, they’ll be forced to sit around the fire and spew all the gossip around camp, eventually tasked with voting one person out of the game. There are some beloved characters, some villains, and some complete weirdos in the 40+ seasons of Survivor that have aired over the past 20+ years. Each season is a true gem, full of twists, bizarre drama, and extreme strategy. —Fletcher Peters\nThe Good Wife\nCreated by: Robert King, Michelle King\nStars: Julianna Margulies, Matt Czuchry, Archie Panjabi, Graham Phillips, Makenzie Vega, Josh Charles\nAre network dramas supposed to be this good? Julianna Margulies stars as the title character, Alicia Florrick, who (in a storyline ripped from many, many headlines) is subjected to public humiliation when her husband, Peter (Chris Noth), the district attorney of Chicago, is caught cheating with a prostitute. The scandal forces Alicia back into the workforce, and she takes a job with her (very sexy) old law school friend Will Gardner (Josh Charles). But Alicia is not your typical “stand by your man” woman, and The Good Wife is not your typical show. The brilliance of the series is that it deftly blends multiple and equally engaging storylines that both embrace and defy genre conventions. Each episode is an exciting combination of political intrigue, inner-office jockeying, family strife, sizzling romance, and intriguing legal cases. The series features a fantastic array of guest stars, and creates a beguiling and believable world where familiar characters weave in and out of Alicia’s life just like they would in real life: You’ll be fascinated by Archie Panjabi’s mysterious Kalinda Sharma, delighted by Zach Grenier’s mischievous David Lee, marvel at Christine Baranski’s splendid Diane Lockhart. And, witness the transformative performance Alan Cumming gives as the cunning Eli Gold. But the real reason to stick with the series is to partake in the show’s game-changing fifth season. Many series start to fade as they age, but The Good Wife peaked late in its mostly glorious seven-season run. —Amy Amatangelo\nEverybody Hates Chris\nCreated by: Chris Rock, Ali LeRoi\nStars: Tyler James Williams, Terry Crews, Tichina Arnold, Tequan Richmond, Imani Hakim, Vincent Martella\nChris Rock is one of the funniest comedians of all time. This is far from a controversial stance. Upon developing a period sitcom about his Brooklyn childhood for the (now defunct) UPN back in the mid-2000s, however, the question emerged of whether or not his brand of knowing, acerbic comedy could survive the transition to network TV. The answer proved to be both yes and no. From the opening seconds of its pilot, Everybody Hates Chris positions itself as an incisive, utterly confident comedic tour-de-force that is perfectly in line with Rock’s brand. And yet, in the hands of co-creator/showrunner Ali LeRoi, the show aimed to be much more than simply the comedian’s stage work reformatted into TV storylines. The result was a family sitcom that both harkened back to the Norman Lear comedies of old, while still retaining the rapid pace and tight construction of the best single-camera productions. The show was never more successful, however, than when it came to its casting, with Tyler James Williams demonstrating immense charisma and comic timing as a young Chris; meanwhile, Terry Crews and Tichina Arnold would promptly enter the pantheon of great TV couples as Chris’ larger-than-life parental units. And though low ratings and frequent schedule shifts would ultimately snuff Chris out after four seasons, it quickly sketched out its place as one of the greatest sitcoms of the new millennium. —Mark Rozeman\nTwin Peaks\nCreated by: David Lynch, Mark Frost\nStars: Kyle MacLachlan, Michael Ontkean, Mädchen Amick, Dana Ashbrook, Richard Beymer, Lara Flynn Boyle, Joan Chen, Eric Da Re, Sherilyn Fenn\nAt its heart, Twin Peaks is a detective story, with Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan), a stalwart, by-the-book FBI agent, descending upon the small logging town of Twin Peaks to investigate the murder of a young woman. But since this was a TV series conceived using the weird and wonderful visions of David Lynch, it wound up being so much more. Like its nearest antecedent, Blue Velvet, it explores the weirdness that lies beneath the surface of Anytown, U.S.A., including a lot of soap opera-like psychosexual drama and assorted oddball characters like The Log Lady (Catherine Coulson) and agoraphobic Harold Smith (Lenny Von Dohlen). The horror of the show came in with the supernatural underpinnings of this storyline, with the killer of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) potentially being an otherworldly force that goes by the name of Bob. Through Lynch’s lens and through the guise of actor Frank Silva, that spirit haunted every last scene in the show, no matter how outlandish and far-reaching it got. With the help of Angelo Badalamenti’s haunting score and the atmosphere created by the set designers, you spent the entirety of the two seasons waiting for something terrible to happen to everyone on screen. And it only made those moments when things did go sour feel that much worse. Twin Peaks: The Return premiered on Showtime in 2017 and is available to stream on Paramount+ with Showtime. Its wild surrealism and resistance to narrative confirm the visionary nature of Lynch’s original. —Robert Ham\nRuPaul’s Drag Race\nCreated by: RuPaul Charles\nJudges: RuPaul Charles, Michelle Visage, Ross Mathews, Carson Kressley\nRuPaul’s Drag Race was the first in a global series of Drag Race competitions. The show pits around a dozen glamorous drag queens against one another in search of America’s next drag superstar—though the challenge has also popped up in the United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands, Chile, and more. Not only that, the reality franchise has also launched spin-offs like All Stars and Secret Celebrity Drag Race. Watch famous queens like Jinkx Monsoon, Trixie Mattell, and Shea Couleé rise to the top, or start afresh from the very beginning and root for whoever grabs your eye. There’s so much to watch in the Drag Race universe, each new episode more glamorous than the last. —Fletcher Peters\nYounger\nCreated by: Darren Star\nStars: Sutton Foster, Debi Mazar, Miriam Shor, Nico Torotorella, Hilary Duff, Peter Hermann\nMy friends and I joke that my taste in TV is “dumb, loud and set in New York City,” and while Younger checks two of those boxes, it’s a whole lot smarter than some of the other “dumb, loud” NYC shows I’ve logged in the past (looking at you, Real Housewives of New York City and Gossip Girl). Younger, featuring Broadway star Sutton Foster and ex-Disney darling Hilary Duff, is a clever examination of Millennial culture, full of topical episodes and socially relevant plotlines, but it’s also just a soapy good time with a soundtrack that sounds like something they’d play inside an H&M. Younger remains light-hearted while giving its viewers a little something more than the TV equivalent of junk food. —Ellen Johnson\nKey & Peele\nCreated by / Stars: Keegan-Michael Key, Jordan Peele\nWe miss Key & Peele. By we, I don’t mean just myself or Paste, but society as a whole. And by “miss” I don’t mean we reflect fondly upon the show, which made us laugh and exists no more, but that our culture literally feels its absence, all the more glaring in the country’s depressing racial climate. Not every sketch was political, and not every sketch was a hit, but at their best, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele hilariously attacked issues few other comedians or shows would dare to touch. They used comedy to become a vital part of the national conversation. —Garrett Martin\nLegend of Korra\nCreated by: Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko\nStars: Janet Varney, David Faustino, P.J. Byrne, J.K. Simmons, Kiernan Shipka\nWhen Avatar: The Last Airbender creators Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino first announced Legend of Korra—a sequel series set 70 or so years after the events of their beloved original show—they certainly were subjected to no shortage of high expectations. And despite a few bumps in the road here and there, Legend of Korra more than met these expectations, crafting a relentlessly engaging series of stories that married the whimsy and imagination of Hayao Miyazaki with the kind of complex political intrigue one might find in a typical episode of Game of Thrones. Moreover, the show also gave us an incredible female protagonist in the form of its titular character—a kickass teenage girl who must save the world, all the while going through that all-too-familiar adolescent journey to discover her own inner self. —Mark Rozeman\nStrangers With Candy\nCreated by: Amy Sedaris, Paul Dinello, Stephen Colbert, Mitch Rouse\nStars: Amy Sedaris, Paul Dinello, Stephen Colbert, Greg Hollimon\nStrangers with Candy’s Jerri Blank—a 46-year-old crack-whore-turned-high-school-freshman, prone to layers of makeup, disturbingly sculpted hair and crocheted vests—is one of television’s most revoltingly loveable anti-heroines. Jerri’s overbite, high-rise pants, and tendency toward inappropriate sexual advances require an actress in possession of excessive valor and gusto: enter the New York-born, North Carolina-raised Amy Sedaris, sister of David, baker of cupcakes and cheeseballs, and beloved comedic foil—she boasted the rubbery mug, incomparable commitment and high, squeaky voice necessary to spark Jerri Blank into hideous fruition. —Amanda Petrusich\nReno 911!\nCreated by: Robert Ben Garant, Kerri Kenney, Thomas Lennon\nStars: Thomas Lennon, Cedric Yarbrough, Robert Ben Garant, Kerri Kenney, Niecy Nash, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Carlos Alazraqui\nA workplace comedy making fun of the police force? Um, yes. Reno 911! takes Cops to the next level: partially unscripted, wholly hilarious, the Comedy Central series takes a look into a satirized version of the Reno Sheriff’s Department. As the incompetent deputies attempt to keep their zones safe, chaos lurks behind every corner. The show pivots from the behind-the-scenes look into the police department, into the public realm, where the Reno 911 cast “arrest” real people (who, most of the time, act out to be filmed on camera). Quibi revived the series in a short-form model; however, with the death of Quibi came the death of the revival. Nevertheless, Reno 911! is always a hoot full of short-shorts, odd criminals, and commentary on the inabilities of our police system. —Fletcher Peters\nDaria\nCreated by: Glenn Eichler, Susie Lewis Lynn\nStars: Tracy Grandstaff, Wendy Hoopes, Julián Rebolledo, Marc Thompson, Alvaro J. Gonzalez\nA perfect distillation of ’90s goodness, Daria holds up as an animated series that both understands and lampoons high school life. The whip-smart and misanthropic Daria Morgandorffer was a heroine for a generation whose favorite refrain was “whatever,” as she navigated the suburban town of Lawndale, the irritation of her uber-popular sister Quinn, and her clueless work-obsessed parents. She couldn’t have done it without the help of her artist friend Jane, though (not to mention her iconic crush on Jane’s rockstar brother), or the help of a jaded, cynical view of this “Sick, Sad World” (as one of the show’s news programs is called). Daria is the poster child for Gen X and early Gen Y culture, and the series remains a delightful time capsule that still holds many truths. —Allison Keene\nThe Good Fight\nCreated by: Robert and Michelle King, Phil Alden Robinson\nStars: Christine Baranski, Rose Leslie, Erica Tazel, Cush Jumbo\nThe Good Fight achieved the holy grail of the TV spinoff. It took the animating question of The Good Wife—how far can you push the law?—and reinterpreted it for our own moment: Does the law even matter? As Diane (Christine Baranski) and Liz’s (Audra McDonald) “book club” debates whether or not to hack voting machines to right the disenfranchisement of voters in the 2016 presidential elections, or as Gary Carr (playing himself) shadows Roland (Michael Sheen) and Lucca (Cush Jumbo) to prepare for a role, The Good Fight is reminiscent of The Good Wife on a molecular level. And yet, its characterization, aesthetic, tone and plot are utterly without nostalgia for it. “What isn’t a lie these days, though?” Gary asks Lucca when she explains why she doesn’t like TV. “Politics, art, science: Everything is TV.” The Good Fight would know: It’s one of the best shows on television. —Matt Brennan\nStar Trek Collection\nFrom Captain Kirk to Admiral Janeway, from shorts to series to films, Paramount+ has every Star Trek TV property you can think of, and then some. CBS All Access made Star Trek its marquee focus, and Paramount+ shows no sign of slowing down on that front. If you love Star Trek and want to explore both the OG series and newer iterations like Picard and the excellent Strange New Worlds, this is your hub. —Allison Keene\n’90s Nostalgia\nFor the Xennials, Paramount+ is essentially a one-stop shop for your Nickelodeon and MTV nostalgia. It doesn’t have everything (including The Adventures of Pete & Pete), but you can find 90210, Are You Afraid of the Dark?, Clarissa Explains It All, Double Dare, Rugrats, Rocko’s Modern Life, and Legends of the Hidden Temple. There’s also The Real World, The Challenge, Celebrity Death Match, and Aeon Flux (hey, remember Liquid Television?). Basically, a little something for everybody who still secretly misses grunge, combat boots, and laughing at how bad those hair extensions looked on Laguna Beach. —Allison Keene\nClassic TV Shows\nLook, you don’t need us to tell you to watch Cheers or I Love Lucy or Perry Mason or The Twilight Zone or… you get the picture. Paragons of television, essentially. Yes, Paramount+ has a nice, although somewhat small collection of classic TV series, all conveniently placed in one genre search screen. For those who want to take a tour of some of TV’s best, there’s no better place to be. —Allison Keene\nSmithsonian Channel\nWhen getting excited over the sheer breadth of content that Paramount+ offers, don’t forget about the Smithsonian Channel. Yeah, this is mostly a channel for your dad—there are a lot of documentaries about various wars, some of which are colorized (which dads love). But there are also nature documentaries, historical deep-dives, and other educational programming that makes for a great brainy break between binges of The Hills. —Allison Keene\nFor all the latest TV news, reviews, lists and features, follow @Paste_TV.",
