Revenues from player trading and major events at Groupama Stadium reached record levels for a 1st half-year.\nEBITDA improved sharply by €31.4 m, benefiting from high capital gains on the sale of player registrations, to €7.6 m.\n1/ EBITDA UP SHARPLY (+€31.4 m vs N-1)\n(1) APM (Alternative Performance Measure) introduced on 30 June 2020 - “Total revenue” corresponds to revenue excluding player trading plus proceeds from the sale of player registrations\n*The half-year financial statements have been audited / have been subject to a limited review by the statutory auditors and their report is being issued.\nTOTAL REVENUE AS OF 12/31/2023: €172.0 M (+€37.1 M, +28%)\nTICKETING: €15.8 M (stable vs N-1)\nTicket sales were resilient in view of the sporting results, coming in at €15.8 m, the same level as N-1, and mainly including revenues from Ligue 1 home matches, as the club will not be playing in the European Cup in 2023/24 (as last season 2022/23).\nMEDIA AND MARKETING RIGHTS: €17.3 M (-€20.4 M, -54%)\nAt December 31, 2022, TV rights included €16.5 m relating to the 1st instalment of the LFP/CVC[1] commercial aid (no instalment at December 31, 2023).\nExcluding the impact of this installment registered on first-half 2022/23, TV rights fell by €3.9 m, due to the unfavorable effect of the provisional Ligue 1 ranking (15th on 31 December 2023 vs. 8th on 31 December 2022) and to the impact of the unfavorable UEFA ranking on international rights.\nSPONSORING - ADVERTISING: €16.7 M (-€2.4 M, -12%)\nRevenues from Advertising-Partnerships were adversely affected by the provisional ranking in Ligue 1 (15th), as well as by the reduction or termination of contracts with certain partners experiencing financial difficulties.\nBRAND-RELATED REVENUE: €11.1 M (stable)\nBrand-related revenue mainly comprises derivative products, stadium refreshment stand royalties, Arena refreshment stand revenue, image and miscellaneous revenue. As of December 31, 2023, Initial revenues from the LDLC Arena refreshment stands (€0.6 m) offset the slight drop in derivative products.\nEVENTS: €16.2 M (+€8.7 M, +117%)\nThe Major Events business reached a record level of €12.9 m, with the Red Hot Chili Peppers concert (July 11, 2023) and 5 Rugby World Cup matches in September and October 2023 at Groupama Stadium, as well as the first Events revenues from the LDLC Arena inaugurated on November 23, 2023 during ASVEL's Euroleague match against Bayern.\nThe Seminars and Tours business amounts to €3.2 m (vs. €3.4 m at December 31, 2022).\nTRADING PLAYERS: €94.9 M (+€51.1 M, +117%)\nRevenue from the sale of player registrations reached a first-half record of €94.9 m, with the sale of Bradley BARCOLA to PSG (€40.5 m), Castello LUKEBA to Leipzig (€30.0 m) and Romain FAIVRE to Bournemouth (€14.0 m), Thiago MENDES to Al Rayyan (€4.0 m), Abdoulaye NDIAYE to Troyes (€3.0 m), Karl TOKO EKAMBI to Abha FC (€1.5 m), Habib KEITA to Clermont (€1.1 m), CAMILO to Akhmat Grozny (€0.2 m), as well as incentives worth €0.6 m.\nAt December 31, 2022, revenue from the sale of players registrations amounted to €43.8 m, including the sale of 2 contracts for a cumulative amount of €38.1 m, as well as loan indemnities and incentives for a total of €5.7 m.\nEBITDA IN STRONG IMPROVEMENT TO €7.6 M (+€31.4 M vs N-1)\nEBITDA improved significantly, benefiting from high capital gains on the sale of player registrations (€78.3 m, vs. €31.2 m at December 31, 2022), in connection with the quality of OL Academy training and the major trading of the summer of 2023.\nExternal purchases and expenses totaled €60.0 m (€56.6 m at 12/31/22). The €3.4 m increase is mainly due to the strong Events business and the opening of the LDLC Arena at the end of November 2023. The ratio of External purchases and expenses to sales was 35%, compared with 42% in N-1.\nPersonnel costs were virtually stable at €84.5 m. Personnel costs in the sports sector fell by -€8 m, due to the large number of player departures in the summer of 2023. Administrative personnel costs rose by +€6.3 m, reflecting the increase in headcount and salary indexation, the development of LDLC Arena operations, and one-off items linked to changes in General Management. The ratio of personnel costs to sales was 49%, compared with 64% in N-1.\nOther ordinary income and expenses – at -€14.8 m (-€1.8 m at 31/12/22) include a significant amount of one-off expenses (€8.2 m) linked to ongoing projects (listing in the United States, sale of OL Reign, etc,…) and the sale of a majority stake in OL Féminin, as well as player loans expenses for the current season.\nNET PROFIT/LOSS (Group Share): -€60.6 M (-€0.4 M vs N-1)\nAfter net depreciation, amortization and provisions of €25.4 m (€2 6.2 m in N-1), operating loss was -€32.6 m, compared with -€51.8 m at December 31, 2022.\nNet financial expense came to €25.2 m (€9.5 m in N-1). The deterioration is mainly due to charges on receivables financing, as well as to financial charges linked to the early repayment of PGEs in relation with the debt refinancing completed in December 2023.\nPre-tax loss thus came to -€57.8 m (-€61.3 m in N-1). Net loss attributable to the Group was therefore -€60.6 m, compared with -€60.2 m a year earlier.\n2/ BALANCE SHEET AND DEBT\nSimplified balance sheet*\n* simplified presentation not in compliance with IFRS\nAssets linked to player registrations fell by €6.7 m, in connection with the player trading carried out during the 2023 summer mercato. At December 31, 2023, the market value of the men's professional squad is estimated at €187 m[2] (€255 m at December 31, 2022), leading to an estimated level of potential capital gains of €140 m (€198 m at December 31, 2022). At the end of the January 2024 mercato (as of February 2, 2024), the Transfermarkt and CIES websites value the professional squad at an average of €234 m.\nProperty, plant and equipment increased by +€20.4 m compared with June 30, 2023, to €464.7 m, mainly reflecting the completion of construction work on the LDLC Arena, which was inaugurated on November 23, 2023.\nShareholders' equity (including minority interests) stood at €19.0 m at December 31, 2023, including the half-year deficit.\nFinancial debt linked to rental obligations amounted to €140.9 m, up €23.5 m, reflecting the increase in CBI (Credit Bail Immobilier) debt for the LDLC Arena. Other financial debts, up €71 m, on June 30, 2023, include the December 2023 refinancing (€361 m) and a financial debt (€23 m), less the repayment of 2017 financing, Arena bonds and PGEs (€315 m).\nCurrent liabilities mounted to €173.8 m, (up +€73.1 m vs 06/30/23), mainly due to significant deferred income on future events at Groupama Stadium and to OL Groupe's purchase of a third of the shares held by Holnest in January 2024 (€14.5 m).\nNet cash debt (including net receivables and payables on player registrations) stood at -€423.7 m at December 31, 2023 (-€404.4 m at June 30, 2023).\n3/ RECENT EVENTS AND OUTLOOK\nWith the aim of improving sporting results, the winter mercato was particularly active, with the acquisition of 5 player contracts (Lucas PERRI, ADRYELSON, Malick FOFANA, Gift ORBAN and Nemanja MATIC) for a total of over €38 m (French standards, excluding incentives).
