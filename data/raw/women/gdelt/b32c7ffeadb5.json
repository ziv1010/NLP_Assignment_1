Scoring comes from practice and hard work, if you don’t shoot you don’t score is what I’ve been telling myself. I probably could have scored a few more.”\nA midfield trio of Kearns, Nagano and Holland has been Beard’s preferred line-up in recent weeks and the combination is one the academy graduate feels is working well.\nKearns stated: “I think we complement each other very well. We all offer different things but we all want to play football. Fuka will thread it through the lines to Ceri and myself to go and express ourselves but we both know we’ll work very hard to recover in. It’s great that we have that balance and we’re all enjoying it at the minute.”\nYou have to accept cookies in order to view this content on our site.\nNext up for Kearns and her teammates is the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park on Friday night and perhaps the chance to make up for a disappointing team performance at Anfield in the reverse fixture earlier in the season.\n“We’re improving every single game and we’re settled into this league a lot more now. I think the last game at Anfield came after we’d beaten Chelsea in the opening game and a big fuss was made of it,” Kearns said.\n“Now we’ve proved ourselves in this league and everyone knows what we’re about. It’s just about putting a performance in and getting a result, that’s what we want.\n“On a personal note I want to just keep improving for the rest of the season and as a team we’re in a good position to keep pushing on, try to get as many points in the last eight games and see where we end up.”",
