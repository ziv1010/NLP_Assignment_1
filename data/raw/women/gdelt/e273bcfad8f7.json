It works a treat.”\nGary’s three year deal with the crisps brand was said to be worth £1.2million in 2020. The former footballer is also paid £1.3million by the BBC to front the Premier League coverage, but will leave the show he first fronted in 1999 at the end of this season.\nFormer BBC star Dan hosted Football Focus on the BBC for 12 years, until 2021, and now presents on Channel 5 and Classic FM.\nREAD MORE: 'Obvious' Gary Lineker Match of the Day replacement named by BBC Sport punditHe is one of several names tipped to replace him, but speaking at the TRIC Christmas Lunch at the Londoner hotel this week, he remained coy, teasing: “Match of the Day is a brilliant programme. I love it. But who knows.”\nGary will remain at the Beeb until 2026 when he will host coverage of the next World Cup and next season’s FA Cup. Dan is the new chair of the The Television and Radio Industries Club, known as TRIC, having taken over from Roman Kemp this week.\nAs Gary confirmed his departure, he said: “I’m delighted to continue my long association with BBC Sport and would like to thank all those who made this happen.”\nAlex Kay-Jelski, director of BBC Sport, hailed him as a “world-class presenter”, who will be “hugely missed” on Match of the Day. He added: “We’re delighted he’ll lead our coverage of the next World Cup and continue to lead our live coverage of the FA Cup.”\nThe bookies’ favourites to replace the former England goal-machine include Mark Chapman, the regular Match Of The Day 2 presenter. “Chappers” is also a key part of the BBC’s coverage of football on radio, presenting Sports Report and the Monday Night Club on 5 Live. He also fronts Global podcast The Sports Agents with Gabby Logan, another candidate to succeed Gary, alongside Kelly Cates and Alex Scott.\nFormer gymnast Gabby has presented MoTD in his absence and fronted coverage of England women’s Euros 2023. Ex-Lioness Alex Scott is also firmly in the mix having presented The One Show and worked alongside Gary on the BBC Sports Personality Of The Year programme.\nA BBC statement said: “Plans for Match of the Day will be announced in due course.” In March last year, the presenter was briefly suspended from the programme after his tweet about the government’s asylum policy sparked a row over BBC presenters expressing political views on social media.\nFollow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.",
