  "body_text": "Group to be led by FIFA Chief of Global Football Development Arsène Wenger\nTeam of experts to share in-depth insights from across all 63 tournament matches\nPanel is responsible for selecting winners of FIFA awards\nFIFA today unveiled the Technical Study Group (TSG) that will provide cutting-edge analysis of all matches across the FIFA Club World Cup 2025™ while increasing and developing understanding of the game worldwide.\nLed by FIFA Chief of Global Football Development Arsène Wenger, the TSG line-up features Esteban Cambiasso (Argentina), Aliou Cissé (Senegal), Tobin Heath (USA), Jürgen Klinsmann (Germany), Roberto Martínez (Spain), Gilberto Silva (Brazil) and Pascal Zuberbühler (Switzerland).\nThe role of the FIFA TSG - an expert panel comprising national-team coaches and former players - is to observe matches, pinpoint tactical trends and innovations, and illustrate them using insights and data provided by the FIFA Football Performance Insights team.\nThe trends that it identifies are published on the FIFA Training Centre , where they are accessible to all free of charge. In addition, the TSG is responsible for selecting individual award winners and the team awarded the fair play prize at FIFA tournaments.\nThe TSG members' expertise enables them to highlight and analyse the technical trends encountered at a tournament with great accuracy.\nBesides analysing the on-pitch action, the TSG studies trends and benchmarks for the future of the game and their impact on coach education and talent development. The group poses questions such as: how is football evolving? What are the trends moving forward? What are the key elements involved in the game? Statistical analysis enables teams to delve deeper into what they see with their eyes alone and backs up those impressions with metrics and numbers to help them to analyse the opposition and themselves.\n\"We have brought together a group of experts from diverse cultures and various places in the world who have great experience and real expertise,\" said Wenger. \"We want to describe, analyse and interpret what is happening on the pitch with a view to inspiring technical experts and football fans in general. We will not only be collecting more data than before, but we will also be aiming to strike the right balance between technical expertise and data. We are looking to inform people about the FIFA Club World Cup technical observations directly and during the tournament itself, not months later.\"\nThe TSG line-up\nArsène Wenger After calling time on a highly distinguished coaching career that included spells at Monaco and Arsenal, Wenger has served as FIFA Chief of Global Football Development since 2019.
