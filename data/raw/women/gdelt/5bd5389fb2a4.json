  "body_text": "Welcome to Chelsea, Mara Alber!\nChelsea is thrilled to confirm the signing of Mara Alber, with the Germany Under-23 international joining the Blues from TSG Hoffenheim on 1 July 2025.\nAlber, who has signed a four-year contract with Chelsea, is a versatile forward who can play on either flank or through the middle and is considered one of the most exciting young talents in Germany.\nThe 19-year-old missed much of this season through injury but has established herself as a regular for Hoffenheim during the last two years despite her young age.\nAlber said: I feel proud to have signed for Chelsea. It is a special moment for me because it is such a big club, and I am really happy to have this opportunity.\nI am a player who has worked really hard up until this point and I am someone who always gives 100 per cent every day in training and in every match I play - I just love football so much.\nAlber made her Bundesliga debut in April 2022 at the age of just 16. She added a further six appearances in Germanys top flight the following season before establishing herself in the 2023/24 campaign.\nInjury limited Alber to six league outings this season but she already has 32 top-flight appearances and seven goals to her name.\nAlber has also enjoyed international success, finishing as joint top goalscorer when Germany lifted the Under-17 Euros in 2022. She was then named the third-best player of the tournament at the Under-17 World Cup later that year.\nIn 2023 she reached another final, scoring two goals as Germany finished runners-up at the Under-19 Euros, and is currently an Under-23 international.\nThe forward is good in one-on-one situations while also providing a goal threat due to her impressive finishing ability.\nPaul Green, head of womens football at Chelsea, said: Mara is a player we have been tracking for many years, despite her young age. She established herself as a key player for Hoffenheim over the last few years, despite the majority of her 2024/25 being cut short due to injury.\nMara has also showed her considerable talent with the German youth national teams, scoring in the final against Spain to win the Under-17 Euros, and reaching the final of the Under-19 Euros. We are looking forward to seeing Mara continue to develop over the coming years and are delighted to welcome her to Chelsea.\nEveryone at Chelsea warmly welcomes Mara to the club, and we wish her every success during her time as a Blue!\n( Press Release Image: https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/339614/339614-1.png )\nWebWireID339614\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.
