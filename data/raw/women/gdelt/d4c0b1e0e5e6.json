Alessia scored her first goal in our 3-0 league win over Brighton and Hove Albion at Leigh Sports Village in October 2020.\n\"Alessia went on to make 59 appearances in all competitions as a Red, scoring 26 goals in the process. Her time at the club culminated in a record-breaking 2022/23 season for United Women, with the team finishing second in the WSL, securing Champions League qualification for the first time, as well as making it to our maiden Women's FA Cup Final.\"\nREAD THE LATEST WSL NEWS, QUOTES, PREVIEWS & MATCH RATINGS HERE\nSources have now confirmed to 90min that Arsenal, whose interest in Russo dates back to 2020, are closing in on the striker's signature.\nThe Gunners still have work to do to finalise a deal, however, and there is still interest in Russo's services from Lyon and around the NWSL.\nSan Diego Wave head coach Casey Stoney, Russo's former manager at United, recently insisted that the 24-year-old will not be making the move to America.\n\"Trust me, if Alessia Russo was coming to the NWSL, I would be in the conversation.\" Stoney told reporters. \"I have a very good relationship with Alessia. If she was coming here we would be in the conversation… She is not coming here.\"",
