  "body_text": "The Orlando Pride announced today that they have hired former Houston Dash goalkeeper and Afghanistan women’s national team assistant coach Haley Carter as their new general manager and vice president of soccer operations.\nAccording to the Pride, Carter will oversee the coaching staff, scouting and analytics, sports performance and nutrition, and player care. Carter holds scouting certifications through the Professional Football Scouts Association and was a consultant for the Dash’s scouting and recruitment in 2019, and recently helped with organizing the evacuation of members of the Afghanistan women’s national team during the Taliban regime’s takeover of the country.\nAdvertisement\nCarter spoke with The Athletic on the day she flew from Texas to Orlando to start taking meetings and preparing for her move, discussing her priorities for the club, her vision for a better professional scouting system in women’s soccer, and how she’s willing to stake her professional reputation to making Orlando a place where players want to play.\nThis Q&A has been edited for length and clarity.\nWhat was the timeline of the GM search?\nMy initial conversation with Jarrod (Dillon, president of business operations) and Caesar (Lopez, general counsel) took place right around Thanksgiving. So it’s been in the works for a while and I will say it was a very diligent, very thorough, somewhat arduous process. Which, to be honest with you, is refreshing. You and I have been around long enough to know that this kind of diligence, it has not always taken place. It’s not always been a priority. So multiple rounds of interviews, multiple presentations to ownership and to the board, meetings with players, meetings with the technical staff, support staff. Personality testing, logical analysis, numerical reasoning. I mean, there was one day I think I took four hours of tests and I would be lying if I said I didn’t feel like I just sat for the LSAT again.\nYou weren’t in the GM position then, but I think the consensus is Orlando came out really well in the draft. You guys got five picks and there’s a lot of talk especially about Emily Madril and Messiah Bright.\nIn one meeting, my last meeting with ownership in Orlando, they asked me who I would pick with the third and I was like ‘Emily Madril.’ So when they picked Madril, I was like (fist pump). Listen, we had an excellent team working on things leading up to the draft, and even since the draft — there’s been a lot of work behind the scenes, identifying talent and going after it and making that a reality. So yeah, I feel really, really good about the roster that we have and obviously there’s still some gaps that need to be filled. But from a foundational standpoint, I feel really, really good.\nAdvertisement\nI think most people primarily know you from your playing days and then as a coach. So when (former Pride goalkeeper Erin McLeod) calls you and she’s like, ‘you should be a GM.’ What was the thought process there of like, yeah, I should be a GM.\nYou know, it’s not like football is the only thing I’ve done for the last 17 years. I’ve held corporate positions and I have an MBA and I’m a licensed attorney. I talk about sort of living on these two paths. And I’ve progressed from a sort of professional career, non-football standpoint, and then also on the soccer standpoint, this just was the perfect position to be able to consolidate my business prowess, if you will, awareness on the soccer side, in terms of coaching, recruiting and navigating all of that. So for me, it was like the perfect intersection of business and the game, and I feel like every personal and professional decision I’ve made over the last 17 years sort of led me to this point. And yeah, I’ve looked at individuals in the past who filled similar roles and why not me?\nI know that you watch the NWSL and you’ve always had lots of thoughts and opinions on this game, inside and out. So when you’re coming in, what do you think your priorities are for the Pride? Like, you mentioned on that business logistics side, but then also on that on-field/player/tactical side?\nMy first 90 days in this is really about relationship building, and building trust with the staff, with the players, with the league, with the players association, community, with the fans. But my biggest priorities are a couple of things: The first thing is really imbuing the staff and the roster with the belief and the commitment to believe that we can win NWSL championships. There is zero reason why the current roster that we put together cannot go and win an NWSL championship. The season is a marathon. We know that it’s a long season and there’s going to be intermittent goals between now and November, but every single person on day one is starting from a place that they believe that we can and we will win NWSL championships. … I am pragmatic and realistic about the fact that that might not happen right away. But we’re gonna get there.\nThe second thing is recognizing that, from a scouting and recruitment standpoint, I don’t think in the league we’ve really seen a club codify that or formalize that. And I think the closest you could probably say a club has done it is Mark Krikorian and Washington, and that’s because Mark has been recruiting and scouting players from overseas for 20 years and he’s very good at it. But as we start talking about culture, building a foundation, having an identity, who we are, how we want to play.\nThe press release specifically mentioned that player safety was important in Orlando’s search, and you’ve long been someone who’s advocated in this area. In the context of that, and everything that the league has gone through publicly, how do you feel about that part of your role and what do you want people to know about your approach to being that person within the Pride organization?\nWhen a player knows that you care about their safety — you care about their welfare, mental and physical, psychological, emotional, you care about what’s happening in their lives — when you make a decision, whether it’s to trade somebody or to waive somebody, that it’s coming from a place, one of mutual respect, and two, I have genuinely thought about everything that’s going on in your life and where you’re trying to be personally and professionally. We may agree to disagree on the business side of it, because ultimately, this is still a business. I’m going to do everything in my power to help you transition in a way that’s going to set you up in the future for what it is that you’re looking to do.\nAnd that takes time, that’s trust building. But I would like to think that, for the players that I know well, in the league and in the club, (they) have a pretty good idea of where I stand on this. And I think, from a credibility standpoint, I’m walking in with a little bit of a leg to stand on. But I think that also, from a leadership philosophy standpoint, leadership philosophies are communicated in actions and not in words. So it’s just gonna take time as we navigate through things. … Culture building doesn’t happen overnight. Building programs doesn’t happen overnight.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s a priority for me that everybody feels safe coming to work, that the staff feel safe coming to work, they can come in and they can do their jobs to the best of their ability. The priority for me is not just advocating for players. I want to advocate for every staff member on the team.\nYou mentioned wanting to standardize scouting, and I agree with you that that’s something that really hasn’t been done in the NWSL yet. I think some clubs are getting better at integrating analytics as a club position, but the scouting, specifically, it was so pasted together and it kind of still is a little bit. When you say ‘structuring the scouting at a club’, what does that look like to you?\nI’m a big fan of the English FA’s DNA model. And within their DNA model, they talk about who we are, how we play, what does our player look like? And one thing that I like to add to that is how we build. Before you can build, before you can recruit, before you can scout, you have to know who you are.\nIf you were to remove the Orlando Pride logo from athletes and they were on the field, what would we look like, what would we be identified as? And figuring out if this is how we want to play them, what do our players look like by position, and then developing notational analysis, we’re going to rate players based on these abilities. I very much believe that analytics need context. Without the context, they’re just numbers and I can make numbers say anything that I want them to say. And so looking at that four corner model of social, technical and tactical, (psychological) and physical, these attributes for disposition. And based on that, putting together notational analysis or a scale. If you’re rating players from one to five, and five is like, a Messi, then what skill sets and attributes fit within the five. What fit within a three or fit within a one, so that you can start to standardize how you’re evaluating players, so as we get scouting put in place, whether Seb (Hines) looks at a player or I look at a player, we’re using a standard scale… and then we can have really an educated conversation.\nI’m a big believer that you can’t Moneyball the NWSL for a couple of reasons, but one of the main reasons is in light of everything that’s happened over the last 18 months, we’ve got to find players that are attracted to the NWSL, that want to come and play in the NWSL. I think that will improve over time. Everybody’s working on creating a culture that this is a league where world-class players want to come and play. But you sort of have to cast a net based on, not just who fits within the position-specific profile, but are they interested in coming? Are they interested in coming to Orlando? Are they interested in playing in the NWSL? And then you kind of work your way down from there.\nYou were a player in this league, so that’s a particular perspective to have about what investment means. You hear investment you think, ‘throwing money at it.’ But for you, who has seen how the sausage is made, when you hear (the Wilfs, owners of the Pride) talk serious investment, what to you signals that’s a legit thing that they’re saying?\nStaff was a big one. Doing the due diligence. For me, an investment is diligence, going through that process, and for as arduous it was, like I said it was refreshing to go through that process. They went through a search firm (Bloom Sports). The board for Orlando City, Orlando Pride was on the call. It was clearly people that did not have to be involved in that conversation were involved in that conversation. And I would say that that’s particularly true of Mark Wilf. And he is in conversations almost daily about things that are happening around the club, from staff hires to player transactions to conversations about facilities and beautification. Those are things that when you really think about it, a lot of owners are not getting involved in that level of detail in today’s game. I think in the early days (of the NWSL) you would see that but really, that was more of a control issue, not more of an investment issue. … Our priority is to go above and beyond so that we can create — you know, the CBA is the bare minimum, it’s the floor.\nI know this is an Orlando Pride discussion, but I feel like I’d be remiss if I didn’t ask you about how the Afghanistan players are doing.\nThey’re doing really well. They got promoted to a higher league (in Australia). We’re still working really hard to make sure that there’s some sort of option for them to be able to be sanctioned as the Afghan women’s national team to compete internationally. We’re not making a lot of headway there. I’m sure you can understand that. … As much as we want to push for them to be able to play and compete as the women’s national team, we also have to take a step back and realize that there are people in Kabul, whether it’s the men’s national team, whether it’s the federation itself, who are scared to do the right thing, for the same reason that our athletes were scared and left the country. For me, that’s why it is especially critical that governing bodies make decisions that initiate change, because the Afghan Football Federation and the officials there are not in a position to sanction them. They can’t because then they’re putting their own lives and their families’ lives at risk. … I think that that’s why it’s critical that you have organizations like FIFPro advocating to FIFA on behalf of the athletes.\nMelbourne Victory, and the support that they’ve provided, is incredible. But I think the other thing, too, that folks need to remember is that, from a mental health standpoint, it’s hard. It’s hard and they have the game and that’s an outlet for them, but you still have women who, everything that they’ve worked on their entire lives went up in flames in a matter of 10 days. And now they’re separated from their families. They’re working two or three jobs to be able to send money back to Afghanistan and the ability to get humanitarian visas has slowed tremendously. Trying to get individuals out of the country is incredibly expensive and often not very safe.\nAdvertisement\nHow can people help, especially if it’s remotely from the U.S.?\nI will tell you that the Afghan women’s national team has a tremendous amount of support, very large organizations and very dedicated benefactors. What I tell people often is that we have so many Afghan families that are still trying to come to the United States and are arriving in the United States, whether they’ve been in Pakistan or they’ve been in Qatar or they’ve been in Dubai and other places. Trying to get involved in your local community and finding out about Afghan refugees and families in your local community and doing what you can to support them is really, really important. … Nobody wants to leave their home and their country, and what they know and what they work for to come to a country where they don’t know the language, it’s a different religion, there’s different customs, you don’t have a job, you don’t know what the future is and you’re trying to provide for your children. Nobody wants to do that. Ever. And whereas we’re very fortunate in the United States, and I know some of my (Afghan) athletes, they are appreciative to be in Australia, but man, do they really wish that they were at home in Afghanistan? Yeah. Recognizing that and getting involved in your local communities and finding where there are opportunities to support them, whether it’s with furniture, or clothes, or toys, or jobs, or anything.\n(Photo: Orlando Pride)",
