It will be the first FIFA Women's World Cup to have more than one host nation.\nThe opening match will be contested between New Zealand and Norway at Eden Park, Auckland, on 20 July 2023. The final will take place on 20 August 2023 at Accor Stadium in Australia.\nThere will be ten venues and nine cities split across Australia and New Zealand. Five cities and six stadiums will be used in Australia, and four cities and stadiums in New Zealand.\nWhile New Zealand has had more than enough time to prepare for a high profile event such as the Women’s World Cup on a sporting front, the country is facing other challenges which are currently on the media agenda. One of those challenges is the ongoing housing crisis which is affecting large parts of New Zealand.\nWe Rank The Best Football Betting Sites\nCheck Out The Best Mobile Betting Apps\nIt was even recently reported that Auckland was ranked the seventh least affordable housing market in the world in a new report.\nWith four cities across New Zealand, including Auckland, hosting the Women’s World Cup this represents a viable financial opportunity for New Zealeanders to take advantage of the increase in tourism and it makes sense for many to turn to Airbnb or other rental marketplaces to rent out their property over the duration of the tournament.\nAll that considered, the research team at Gambling.com decided to work out the Most Lucrative Airbnb Stadium Locations at the Women's World Cup 2023.\nIn addition, they found out which NZ regions are most interested in the Women’s World Cup.

The Sky Stadium in Wellington came in fourth place with an average price of $407 per night while Eden Park in Auckland completed the top 5 with an average price of $350 per night.\nWhen it comes to appetite for the Women’s World Cup it would be fair to assume New Zealeander’s are playing catch up to their European counterparts. However, playing the tournament on home soil could spike significant interest and FIFA are certainly hoping this is the case if the tournament is deemed a huge success.\nResearch reveals Manawatū-Whanganui is the number one NZ region for Google searches in relation to the Women’s World Cup.\nOtago and Nelson join them on the podium in second and third place respectively.\nWe Pick Out The Best Premier League Betting Offers\nCheck Out The Best New Betting Sites\nMethodology\nIn order to work out the Most Lucrative Airbnb Stadium Locations at the FIFA Women's World Cup 2023 Gambling.com did the following:\n- Analysed Airbnb data (average NZD prices for all Airbnb’s listed) for locations in the vicinity of every stadium venue at the tournament.
