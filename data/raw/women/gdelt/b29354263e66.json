  "body_text": "Volleyball Day in Nebraska sets world record for attendance at women's sporting event\nNebraska's Volleyball Day truly was a historic event, breaking the world record for a women's sporting event.\nMemorial Stadium in Lincoln, Nebraska, was filled with 92,003 fans to take in the action between Division II powers Nebraska-Kearney and Wayne State before seeing Omaha go up against the fourth-ranked Huskers.\nThe previous world record was 91,648, set during a Champions League soccer match in 2022.\nThe event also broke the U.S. record attendance for a women's sporting event of 90,185 for the 1999 World Cup soccer final between the United States and China at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.\nFans came from all over the country to partake in the excitement the volleyball teams had to offer.\nThe stadium's official capacity is slightly over 85,000 for football, but seating on the field allowed for more fans to join in on the fun.\nThe Huskers have sold out 306 consecutive regular season matches, but Wednesday's match will not count towards the streak because it is not in the team's Devaney Center court.\nThey have been leading the country in attendance numbers since 2013, and they were involved in eight of the nine top crowds in the history of NCAA Volleyball.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",
