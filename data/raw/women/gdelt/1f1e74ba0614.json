Whitlock slams new obsession with female leadership\nJanuary 08, 2026\nAs Carlie Irsay-Gordon takes over the Indianapolis Colts, Whitlock argues the league’s fixation on her sideline presence isn’t about football.\nJim Irsay was the owner of the Indianapolis Colts before he passed away. Now, his daughter Carlie Irsay-Gordon is the team’s new owner — and BlazeTV host Jason Whitlock isn’t thrilled with the attention her presence has been drawing.\n“She magically appears as the team’s owner and standing on the sideline. And she is what I’m calling an example of the equalizers and this whole feminist movement we have going on in the National Football League,” BlazeTV host Jason Whitlock comments.\n“America, beyond question — American culture, American society — the feminist movement has overtaken everything. And that’s why we have women like Carlie Irsay-Gordon pretending to be some sort of football savant and standing on the sidelines with headsets on and listening to the coaches,” he continues.\n“If women can overtake the NFL, that should be a message to you that they can overtake, and they are overtaking, all of American society,” he adds.\nAnd when Irsay-Gordon spoke about the end of their season during a press conference, Whitlock points out that she’s literally reading off a script.\n“She’s looking down every fourth word at notes in front of her. She’s reading a script. She’s pretending to be a male leader by reading a script. This is all scripted and intentional,” Whitlock says.\n“In 2022, NFL owners put out a statement saying that diversity in ownership was an important goal for the NFL. And so, they’ve been ushering in all of this female leadership into the National Football League,” he explains.\n“Anything that’s diverse, anything that promotes something that’s not male, patriarchal, and white, that’s all good. ... Anything that disrupts tradition, anything that disrupts biblical patriarchy, anything that disrupts male authority and leadership, it’s all good. It’s a positive. It’s a sign of progress,” he continues.\nWhile Irsay-Gordon isn’t the first daughter of an owner to inherit an NFL team, Whitlock points out that it’s not the fact that she inherited the team, but the hyperfocus on her while the Colts were off to an 8-2 start.\n“She was the hottest thing in the NFL — ‘She’s holding the coaches accountable, she’s on the sidelines during the games, she’s on headsets, let’s do stories about it,’” Whitlock mocks.\n“This is the future of the NFL,” he adds.\nWant more from Jason Whitlock?\nTo enjoy more fearless conversations at the crossroads of culture, faith, sports, and comedy with Jason Whitlock, subscribe to BlazeTV — the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.\nWant to leave a tip?\nWe answer to you.
