She was an inaugural participant in the NFL’s first Women’s Careers in Football Forum and one of the first women to earn the coveted Bill Walsh Diversity Internship in an on-field coaching position.\nJenkins is a proud member of the Dove Body Confident Collective, an all-star squad of influential female voices in sports assembled by Dove to support its Body Confident Sport initiative. The campaign aims to help young female athletes feel more confident in their bodies and on the field, and it also includes icons like Billie Jean King, Venus Williams, Sabrina Ionescu, Tara Davis-Woodhall, Kylie Kelce and Emma Navarro.\nJenkins has been featured on The Today Show, NBC, Sports Illustrated, Essence, CBS Sports, Yahoo Sports, NFL Network and more.

He has played a pivotal role in seeking justice for the late Muhlaysia Booker, a Black transwoman murdered in Dallas in 2019. In 2023, he led meetings with the White House, the U.S. House of Representatives Minority Leader, the U.S. Department of Justice, the FBI, the Dallas County DA’s Office and others, all combining to help get a a 50-year prison sentence for Muhlaysia’s killer and evaluations in federal policies.\nLast year, Goree traveled to Washington, D.C., to encourage federal officials to develop policies p’rotecting the voting rights of the LGBTQ community. As a result, Dallas County changed its poll worker training to make sure this community can vote without fear of discrimination or intimidation.\nIn January, Goree championed the Dallas Police Department’s leadership to start a Police Chief’s Anti-Hate Advisory Council, which now is represented by 15 community members from every sector of the city to help keep Dallas free from hate. He is currently a member of the Texas Southern University School of Business Advisory Council, a member of the board of directors for Texas Pride Community Foundation, board president of the Muhlaysia Booker Foundation, and a member of the VisitDallas 2026 FIFA World Cup Bid Committee, the Dallas County DA’s Advisory Council, and the mayor of Dallas’ Anti-Hate Advisory Council.\nGoree led Dallas Southern Pride through a time of uncertainty and stress following the death of the organization’s former head, Kirk Myers Hill, and in doing so brought thousands of visitors and an economic impact of $3 million to Dallas. he was named as a hero in the Dallas Voice’s 2024 Heroes and Villains feature and was a Dallas Business Journal and Fort Worth Business Press 40 under 40 honoree. He has received the North Texas LGBT Chamber’s Community Excellence Award and was named Dallas Black Chamber’s A. Maceo Smith Emerging Leader.\nBorn and raised in Dallas, Goree attended H.

While the aim of MMIW Texas Rematriate is to help families and survivors affected by the MMIP crisis, the organization also recognizes that building community and creating kinship relations is essential when it comes to healing from the many traumas this community has faced. “Native and Indigenous culture is a collectivist culture; we believe in creating strong community foundations, and we understand that we heal by being there for one another in times of need,” Thunderhawk said, adding that “This, as well as assuring 2SLGBTQ+ voices are never left out,” is what drives her to do the volunteer work that she does.\nThe Outstanding Leadership in Business Award went to Michelle Carpenter, a chef who trained under Tokyo sushi masters in La Jolla before returning to Texas. Born in Tokyo to a Cajun Airman and an Eddoko homemaker, Carpenter spent her childhood in Wichita Falls, Winn Parrish in Louisiana and San Antonio.\nAfter working for leading sushi restaurants in Dallas for more than a decade, Carpenter opened her own concept in 2007: Zen Sushi in the Bishop Arts, which was the Oak Cliff neighborhood’s first sushi bar. Her menu reflected her story, marrying Edo-style technique to regional ingredients.\nIn 2022, Carpenter fulfilled her lifelong dream to open a Cajun-Creole concept that paid homage to the other component of her heritage.

This position, she said, really opened her eyes to public health as she educated the community on topics like disaster preparedness and recovery, West Nile Virus, Chikegunya Virus, Zika Virus and Ebola.\nAfter a short time in PHEP, Marisa became the public information officer, again shiting her view of public health as media relations and social media became the focal point of her job. Currently, she is the community outreach program manager and is responsible for conducting and overseeing pop-up clinics in the community.\nGonzales also worked disaster response to Hurricane Ike in 2008 and Hurricane Harvey in 2017 response, as well as Ebola response, Zika/Chik-V/West Nile Virus response, COVID and Mpox responses, and any other emerging public health issues that arise. She holds a bachelor’s degree in Community Health from Texas Woman’s University and is a certified community health worker. When she’s not advocating for the community, Gonzales loves spending time with her family and her French bulldog “Chula.”\nThe Outstanding Leadership in Philanthropy Award was presented to Paul Von Wupperfeld, who has more than 35 years of work in LGBTQ community activism and who has been a driving force in advocacy and leadership.\nVon Wupperfeld chaired Texas Instruments’ Pride Employee Network and co-founded and chaired the Out & Equal Workplace Advocates DFW chapter.
