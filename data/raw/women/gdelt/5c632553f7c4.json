  "body_text": "Not all of Harrison Butker's moves have been total winners.\nBefore his Kansas City Chiefs team secured their spot in the 2025 Super Bowl, the NFL kicker faced criticism for delivering a commencement speech at Benedictine College, in which he discussed several topics, including abortion, LGBTQIA+ rights and the role of women in their families.\n\"How many of you are sitting here now about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career?\" Harrison asked the women in the audience during his May 11 speech at the Catholic university. \"Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world.\"\nThe 28-year-old went on to note that his wife Isabelle Butker—with whom he shares two kids—would be \"the first to say her life truly started when she started living her vocation as a wife and as a mother,\" and praised her for embracing \"one of the most important titles of all: homemaker.\"\nAnd Harrison didn't just direct his words at the graduating women. He also urged the men in the crowd to be \"unapologetic in your masculinity, fighting against the cultural emasculation of men.\" Plus, he targeted the LGBTQIA+ community, calling Pride Month \"the deadly sin sort of pride,\" and criticized the support of procedures such as abortion, IVF and surrogacy.\nAfter his speech spread online, many social media users, as well as celebrities like Serena Williams, Katy Perry, Hoda Kotb and his teammate Travis Kelce's sister-in-law Kylie Kelce, spoke out against his controversial messaging.\nIn her response, Kylie——who is married to former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce—encouraged women who want to pursue careers to not let Harrison's comments divert them from those goals.\n\"Those women graduating in that class have just achieved something that no one can take away from them,\" the 32-year-old said during a June 2024 interview with Cheddar. \"Their education will stick with them for the rest of their lives. I hope they were appropriately celebrated if that was not their view.\"\nMeanwhile, Hoda called out Harrison for speaking on behalf of a demographic he doesn't belong to, saying, \"Stop speaking for women out there.\"\nIn light of the backlash, the NFL made it clear that Harrison doesn't speak for the sports organization either, with chief diversity and inclusion officer Jonathan Beane sharing in a statement to People, \"His views are not those of the NFL as an organization. The NFL is steadfast in our commitment to inclusion, which only makes our league stronger.\"\nBut that didn't mean the NFL or the Chiefs condemned him for sharing his perspective, either. As Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes put it during a May 2024 press conference, \"When you're in the locker room, there's a lot of people from a lot of different areas in life. They have a lot of different views on everything and we're not always going to agree.\"\nAnd the squad's tight end Travis echoed those sentiments, saying, \"I cherish him as a teammate.\"\n\"When it comes down to his views and what he said at Saint Benedict's commencement speech, those are his,\" he continued. \"I can't say I agree with the majority of it or just about any of it outside of just him loving his family and his kids.\"\nAs for Harrison? The football player had no regrets about his comments in the wake of the criticism.\n\"There's things that I believe wholeheartedly that I think will make this world a better place, and I'm going to preach that,” he told reporters at training camp in August. “And if people don't agree, they don't agree, but I'm going to continue to say what I believe to be true and love everyone along the way.”\nFor more stars reaction to Harrison's polarizing speech, read on...",
