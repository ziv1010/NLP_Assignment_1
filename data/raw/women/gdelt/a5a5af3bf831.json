He said that he's only been in love once and he would \"give anything\" to feel that again. However, will the comments he made on a podcast a few months ago could stand between him and his ability to find love? He had said he was looking for someone 45-60 without an artificial hip or wig. He says he regrets it and he is sorry. Mel said that does not represent who he is. The women were definitely offended and not looking to waste their time, but seemed to be in a forgiving mood. They showed up!\nMel has two sons and he loves them more than anything. Lucas and Andre are his pride and joy. Mel was born in Detroit in 1958 and his dad was a teacher and a coach.

It really was like a fairytale! This is a relationship we'll want to watch! She seems like she could be around for a long time!\nMel met the rest of the women at a football field with Jesse Palmer. Alexandra said that Mel looked even younger in his uniform. They were at the original home of the Los Angeles Rams. They weren't there to play football, they were there to learn how to be cheerleaders. Cindy was excited because she used to be a pro cheerleader, 30 years ago. Paula Abdul joined them to help instruct them on how to become cheerleaders along with the Los Angeles Rams cheerleaders. They were split into two squads and would be putting on a show. The winning squad would get to spend the evening with Mel.\nThe yellow Mel's Angels who danced to \"Straight Up\" by Paula Abdul.

There is a group date rose sitting on a table. Monica P. shared her story of her divorce, remarriage and death of her spouse during COVID. She's terribly lonely now and really hoping to find love.\nDebbie talked about an early love that didn't work out at age 45, and how she had almost given up but she still wants to find love. Mel finds all of the women to be really loving. Cindy talked about how she misses her three daughters, and Mel played a video for her of her kids! She was at the Hollywood Bowl to dance with Diana Ross! Mel should take her on a date there! It made Cindy cry she was so happy. They spent a lot of time together and did a lot of kissing. Woo!\nIn the end, Mel decided to give the date rose to Cindy! It was tough for him to decide because they all shared so much with him. Cindy feels like she's already beginning to fall in love!\nWhen Mel arrived at Bachelor Mansion, he was swarmed by women. Mel took off his shirt by the pool and they were stunned by his amazing abs. Although the thing that was the craziest is that he jumped in the pool. Mel told Peg that he is still working and he plans on working forever. She wants someone who has time to do some fun things. She said, \"It's go time!\" Diana read him a poem she wrote. Do you think she could be a match for Captain Kim? I would love to see an all Golden Paradise this summer!\nThe women and Mel danced to some 80s hits by the pool and he did his best to give everyone attention. He said it was the most fun he had in years. Nicolle jumped in the pool and climbed on top of him and was kissing him and putting her arms around him in front of everyone. It was very awkward. It was great that there was a water gun by the pool because a few quirts with that by Gerri cooled Nicolle down!\n1) Cheryl (1-on-1 date)\n2) Cindy (group date rose)\n3) Roxanne\n4) Debbie\n5) Gerri\n6) Monica P.\n7) Monica B.\n8) Carol\n9) Peg\n10) Nicolle\n11) Robin\n12) Amy\n13) Terri\nThat meant that Diane, Alexandra, Mylene, and Carla were eliminated. Diane is a gem, I'm so glad that the journey gave her hope!\nPeg, Debbie, Gerri, Cheryl, and Cindy all seem to have a big connection with Mel! Nicolle also continues smooching Mel in front of everyone. He also has a lot of hard goodbyes in front of him. One woman leaves but he chases after her. \"I wish it was you,\" he says at some point. He also takes out a big ring at the finale location! So it looks like we'll be getting a proposal this season! Let's hope so!\nCopyright © 2026 OnTheRedCarpet.com. All Rights Reserved.",
