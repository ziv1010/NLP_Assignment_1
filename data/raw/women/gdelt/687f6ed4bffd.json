  "body_text": "—It was a monster weekend in the recruiting world for Jeff Brohm and the U of L football program, which received a pair of commitments from members of the class of 2025:\nMonday afternoon Cardinal news and notes\nCardinal kids are ready for some football.\nAfter receiving four commitments in seven days, Louisville’s class of 2025 is now comprised of 10 players.\n—Congratulations to Louisville’s Jayden Ulrich, who finished as the national runner-up in the women’s discus throw at the NCAA Outdoor Championships.\n—Kenny Payne spoke publicly on Friday for the first time since his firing at Louisville, and once again gave the impression that he thought he was doing a great job at U of L and that everyone else in the basketball world agreed with him.\nThe biggest shocker here is that we didn’t get a “hundreds of calls” reference.\n—Eric Crawford reacts to Payne’s words here.\nIf by “exactly what happened” they meant that Payne wasn’t cut out yet to be a head coach, not at Louisville, then yes, they knew what happened.\nPayne saw it another way.\n“You really were on the right page,” he tells himself.\nI don’t see how he can say that Louisville, with its empty arena and back-to-back last-place ACC finishes, was on the right page. If he thinks they were on the right page, we’re not even using the same hymnal. He had a chance to get them on the right page. In Louisville’s final eight ACC games of the season, the schedule eased up. The team actually had a chance to put together a little run, to dress up what had been another disappointing season.\nIt lost eight games in a row, and nine out of 10. What page is that? Is this a Stephen King novel?\nI think, instead, Payne is on the right page now, as an assistant coach. Understand, that’s not a knock. It’s not a criticism. He’ll make more money as an assistant this year than I’ll make in the next seven years. Not everyone is cut out to be a CEO. Some are really good COOs. And that’s a worthy thing.\nBut don’t try to sell me, “we know what happened.” What happened is that Louisville failed to thrive, despite the best wishes of an entire community. Despite some talented recruits. Despite a group of players who were not coached well enough to even offer the appearance of progress.\n“We know what happened,” implies that Payne didn’t have a chance at Louisville. Payne had the same chance that anyone inherits at Louisville. He had the same rabid fan base. He had the same facilities. He had NIL support. He lost his first exhibition game to a Division II opponent. He lost his first regular season game, to Bellarmine. He lost his first nine games. He lost to Arkansas AND Arkansas State.\nI don’t have to run back through all that stuff. You were there. You watched. Let’s not go back. But whatever page Payne was on at Louisville, it was not the right one. University administrators had no choice but to let him go. There was no financial reality other than the athletic department buying a winning Powerball ticket that would sustain a third season of Kenny Payne.\nWhat happened was a disaster.\n—Pat Kelsey calls strength and conditioning coach Eli Foy his “secret weapon.”\n—The schedule for the 2024 U of L women’s soccer season is out.\n—Shady car deals have been a part of major college athletics for basically the last century. Now, they’re all out in the open (Athletic link).\n—On the Saturday where they typically face Kentucky, the Louisville men’s basketball program will be facing another local school this year.\n—Racing Louisville finds itself squarely in playoff position after a 2-0 Friday night win over Houston.\n—The latest test for Racing will come Saturday at noon against defending league champion Gotham FC in a game that will be carried live on ESPN. It’ll be “Ali Day” at Lynn Family Stadium, and Lonnie Ali is among those who are planning to be in attendance.\nIf you’d also like to be in attendance, discounted tickets for Card Chronicle readers are available here.\n—Pat Kelsey says that hiring Peyton Siva has already proven to be a beneficial move.\n“One thing of significance I think we did that’s going to be very beneficial moving forward, and being a conduit or bridging between me and those former players, is Peyton Siva,” Kelsey told WDRB’s Tyler Greever in a recent interview. “Peyton is one of the hires that we made on the staff and gosh, is he a special, special person. Obviously, he’s one of the most beloved figures.”\nAs Kelsey noted, in Siva’s role, he will be responsible for helping bridge the gap between the current regime and the former players from all generations of the Louisville men’s basketball program. Because of his “infectious personality” and the amount of relationships he has fostered within the community, Kelsey believes Siva was the perfect hire for the role.\n“Peyton is an infectious personality,” he said. “Great heart. He’s got great energy. He’s respected by all the former players. He has so many relationships, not only with the basketball alumni, but in the city of Louisville as well. And people say all the time, ‘Did you hire him because of that bridge and that connection?’ I said, ‘I mean, that’s a byproduct.’ But the biggest reason I hired him was he blew me away when I interviewed him. He’s just smart.”\n—Louisville baseball has landed a transfer commitment from Marist SS Bayram Hot. As a sophomore in 2024, Hot batted .278 in with 14 doubles, 7 home runs, and 37 RBI.\n—Esquire counts down the 26 best movies of 2024 so far.\n—Stephen Herron is the guest on the latest episode of the From the Pink Seats podcast.\n—Pat Kelsey thinks his team’s maturity will help it find success in 2024-25.\n—Zach Randolph plans on being a fixture at the KFC Yum Center beginning this winter.\n—After advancing through the first two rounds of the state tournament, Trinity and PRP will square off in the state baseball semifinals Friday morning at 10 a.m. in Lexington.\n—Assumption softball has also advanced to the state semis, where they will face North Laurel at 3:30 p.m. on Friday.\n—Louisville has offered class of 2026 safety Craig Tutt from Tennessee.\n—Louisville Report breaks down the game of new running back commit Jaylin Brown.\n—I’m just so excited to be excited again.\n—There are many reasons to get excited for Louisville hoops. Terrence Edwards is definitely one of them.\n—Quarterback Mason Mims feels even better about his commitment to U of L after his most recent official visit.\n—It’s been an awfully large month and-a-half for events in the city of Louisville.\n—Except for, you know ...\n—Two Racing Louisville players were named to the NWSL’s Best 11 squad for the month of May.\n—The Louisville Bats were blown out in their series finale against Nashville on Sunday.\n—OL commit Jake Cook says his latest visit to U of L was “amazing.”\n—The AP has a feature on Pat Kelsey’s attempt at a fast rebuild at Louisville. The story also includes, I believe, the first mention of a second walk-on: Patrick Antonelli, who had previously played at Emory & Henry College. Antonelli is the son of former NC State star and current ESPN commentator Debbie Antonelli.\n—And finally, the Mike Rutherford Show returns this afternoon from 3-6 on 1450 The Big X.
