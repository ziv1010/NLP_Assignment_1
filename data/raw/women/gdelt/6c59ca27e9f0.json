  "body_text": "The Top 4 WSL clubs – Chelsea, Man City, Arsenal & Man City Women – go head to head this weekend. Arsenal Women will welcome Manchester United to a SOLD OUT Emirates Stadium, on Saturday 17th February, kick-off 12.30PM UK. You can watch the match live on SkySports.\nThis will be historic match, as it is the first time in Arsenal Women’s history that they have sold out the Emirates for a Barclays Women’s Super League match.\nCurrently, Arsenal Women sit 3rd in the WSL, 3 points behind Man City and 6 points behind reigning champions Chelsea. Manchester United are trailing in 4th, on 24 points, as you can see on the WSL table below:\n1st place Chelsea will go head to head with 2nd place Manchester City on Friday evening (full details below). The outcome of this match will be key in Arsenal’s WSL title ambitions, but only if they manage to overcome an in-form Manchester United on Saturday..\nFriday 16th February\nChelsea v Manchester City (Kingsmeadow Stadium, 7.15pm) – Live on BBC2\nSaturday 17th February\nArsenal v Manchester United (Emirates Stadium, 12.30pm) – Live on Sky Sports\nI’m hoping for a display from our Gunners, akin to when they beat Chelsea 4-1 at Emirates Stadium in December 2023. I was at that match. The atmosphere was electric. N5 was not quite sold out, but it wasn’t far short, with an attendance of 59,042. And our Gunners were on fire and playing some breathtaking football!\n“That’s as bad as I’ve seen us for a long time,” Chelsea boss Hayes said post-match. “They bullied us.”\nI hope we see that spark back in our Gunners on Saturday! That high intensity energy that leaves the opposition dumbfounded. With 60,000 fans in attendance, Gooners will be an excellent 12th player for our Gunners! And coming off the back of our Conti Cup QF win, our Gunners should be raring to go!\nAre you going to the match? We’d love to get a ‘Fan’s eye view’ of the day!\nCOYGW!\nMichelle Maxwell\nFollow JustArsenal’s Gooner Women on Just Gooner Women on Twitter (X) for regular updates on the Arsenal Womens Team!\nDo you want to read more about the Arsenal Women’s Team?
