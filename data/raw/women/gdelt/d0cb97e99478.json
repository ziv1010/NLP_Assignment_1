She has been left out of the squad to travel to Dakar this Wednesday morning.\n“We will overcome because we have reviewed the match and taken a lot of lessons on board. I commend the girls for regrouping after a tough first half, adjusting tactics and showing character in the second half. We could have won by more goals because we created a number of opportunities in that second period.\n“In Senegal, we must defend resolutely and attack with purpose. We will play with focus and determination.”\nThe Confederation of African Football has appointed officials from the Kingdom of Morocco to take charge of the second leg match, set for Stade Lat Dior in Thies, Senegal’s third largest city, which is 70 kilometres from the capital, Dakar.\nZakia El Grini will be the referee, to be assisted by Karima Khadiri (AR1) and Ihsane Ennouajeli Nouajli (AR2), with Zoulaikha Harmasse as fourth official. Oumou Souleymane Kane from Mauritania will be the commissioner while Kenyan Alice Kimani will be in the role of referee assessor.\nThe match has been slated to kick off at 5pm Senegal time (6pm Nigeria time), with the winner on aggregate to progress to the final round of the African qualifiers. The final tournament will take place in Poland in September.",
