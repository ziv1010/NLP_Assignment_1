  "body_text": "While reports about Ted Lasso season 4 being in development make the wait for its potential return more excruciating, there’s another fantastic sports comedy to watch in the meantime that just dropped its fourth season. Ted Lasso arrived in 2020 to make an early bid as one of the best-ever sports comedy shows, giving Apple TV+ one of its first major original hits while providing a heartwarming, emotionally compelling, and ultimately uplifting comedy story. Even if viewers didn’t know anything about soccer/football, there was something inherently engrossing about the character work and stories presented in Ted Lasso.\nTed Lasso’s achievements surpassed just viewership numbers, as it also became a critical and awards darling, dominating the Emmys in 2021 and 2022. As such, it came as somewhat of a surprise that the show was ending after just three seasons. In May 2023, Ted Lasso’s season 3 finale seemingly served as the series ending – until it was reported in August 2024 that Ted Lasso season 4 was in development. However, considering the wait for the hit show’s potential return will inevitably be quite long, there’s another fantastic returning sports series to watch in the meantime.\nShoresy Season 4 Is A Fantastic Ted Lasso Replacement Show\nShoresy & Ted Lasso Have Similar Sports Comedy Themes\nWith Ted Lasso still off the air for the foreseeable future, a great replacement show to watch is Shoresy, which dropped season 4 on Hulu on February 26. Created, written by, and starring Jared Keeso, Shoresy follows the titular character and the Sudbury Bulldogs, a Northern Ontario Senior Hockey Organization, who must start winning games, recruiting fans, and building themselves up as a team or risk getting shut down. Under the general management of Nat, her friends Ziig and Miig, coach Sanguinet, and experienced player Shoresy (Keeso), the Bulldogs make miraculous changes through the mantra of “hating to lose.”\nThe set-up of Shoresy is relatively similar to how Ted Lasso season 1 kicks off. Like AFC Richmond, the Bulldogs are a struggling team on the edge of its official downfall, with one character taking it upon himself to reshape the team both off and on the ice/pitch and make a name for them. Additionally, both shows notably feature women having recently inherited overall leadership positions of the struggling men’s teams, with Rebecca being the owner of AFC Richmond in Ted Lasso after her husband, while Nat is the general manager of the Bulldogs after her mother in Shoresy.\nFor the most part, what made Ted Lasso such a compelling sports series can also be found in Shoresy.\nFocusing on the come-up of a group of likable athletes on a team they know is failing, Ted Lasso and Shoresy share similar themes and tones that are often found in sports comedies. The journey of the Bulldogs by Shoresy season 3’s ending is just as uplifting as the journey of AFC Richmond throughout Ted Lasso’s first three seasons, with both providing optimistic stories, compelling protagonists, and an ensemble of approachable characters experiencing some inspiring personal development and growth. For the most part, what made Ted Lasso such a compelling sports series can also be found in Shoresy.\nShoresy's Humor Is Very Different From Ted Lasso\nShoresy Is A Much Raunchier Show\nThough Shoresy and Ted Lasso share some important similarities, it wouldn’t be accurate to suggest they have the same overall appeal. Shoresy leans much more into the raunchier, gritter humor of senior hockey players, which means Jared Keeso’s show comes with plenty more profanity, sexual jokes and references, insults, and immature humor than Ted Lasso. There’s a greater sense of innocence in Ted Lasso, despite the dark, heavy themes it often approaches, whereas Shoresy doesn’t shy away from its dirty humor and bolder take on optimistically reshaping its players.\n12 Best Quotes From Shoresy\nThe Letterkenny spinoff Shoresy is just as loaded with incredible one-liners as Jared Keeso's original comedy, and might even surpass it at times.\nUnlike Ted Lasso, the changes that Shoresy makes to the players as they bond and grow as a team aren't meant to turn them into upstanding citizens. Shoresy himself is a character who the show doesn’t necessarily want viewers to model themselves upon, and that’s part of the big difference in appeal between Jared Keeso’s Letterkenny spinoff and Apple TV+’s comedy. Audiences are meant to laugh at, be disgusted by, and be frustrated by Shoresy almost as much as they’re meant to support him, love him, and root for him to grow and become the best version of Shoresy he can be.\nShoresy Season 4's Coaching Story Makes The Show's Ted Lasso Comparisons Even Stronger\nShoresy Is No Longer A Player On The Team\nOne big difference between the set-up for Ted Lasso and Shoresy’s sports stories was that Jason Sudeikis’ character was the coach, whereas Jared Keeso’s character was the veteran hockey player. Shoresy was still on the team throughout seasons 1, 2, and 3 – until a career-ending injury meant he’d have to abandon that path and find another way to “scratch the itch” of his love for hockey. At the end of Shoresy season 3, Nat offered Shoresy the chance to coach the Bulldogs now that he can’t play – a choice he has to ponder throughout season 4.\nWhile there are reports of Ted Lasso season 4 being in development, the show's return has not officially been confirmed by Apple TV+.\nWith Shoresy season 4’s story evolving the titular character’s role from player to coach, it’s even more difficult to avoid comparisons to Ted Lasso. The frustrations of Shoresy not being on the ice and instead standing in the box make the show ripe for plenty of new conflicts and plotlines, but at least he won’t be starting fresh with the players like Ted Lasso did with AFC Richmond. Of course, the coaching strategies of Shoresy’s main character are certain to be a far cry from those implemented by Ted Lasso’s titular figure.\nSource: Rotten Tomatoes\n- Release Date\n- May 13, 2022\n- Network\n- Crave\n- Directors\n- Jacob Tierney, Sean Skene\n- Writers\n- Jared Keeso\nCast\n-\nJared KeesoShoresy\n-\nTasya TelesNat",
