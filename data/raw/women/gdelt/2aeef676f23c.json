  "body_text": "CLEVELAND (AP) — Joe Flacco passed for 309 yards and three touchdowns and the Cleveland Browns clinched an unlikely playoff berth and just their second since 2002 despite numerous injuries with a 37-20 win over the New York Jets. The Browns are assured of a wild-card spot and still have a chance to win the AFC North. They're still in the hunt for the conference’s No. 1 overall seed. That's something unfathomable just weeks ago as major injuries piled up. Flacco threw two TD passes to running back Jerome Ford and for 296 yards in the first half. The Jets held the Browns to just 3 points after halftime.\nORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Avery Johnson threw for two touchdowns and ran for one, DJ Giddens rushed for 151 yards and scored twice, and Kansas State beat No. 19 North Carolina State 28-19 in the Pop-Tarts Bowl. Johnson, a freshman making his first start after Will Howard entered the transfer portal, threw for 178 yards and rushed for 71. He directed a 15-play, 72-yard touchdown drive in the fourth quarter that put the game away and closed out a solid season for coach Chris Klieman’s Wildcats. Quarterback Brennan Armstrong rushed for 121 yards and a touchdown and threw for 164 yards in his final game for the Wolfpack. Both teams finished 9-4.\nSAN ANTONIO (AP) — Gunner Maldonado returned a fumble 87 yards for a touchdown and also had an interception as No. 14 Arizona forced six turnovers in a 38-24 comeback victory over No. 12 Oklahoma on Thursday night in the Valero Alamo Bowl. Noah Fifita threw for 354 yards and two touchdowns for Arizona (10-3). The Wildcats closed with seven straight victories as they depart the Pac-12 to join the Big 12 next season. Leaving the Big 12 to join the Southeastern Conference, Oklahoma also finished 10-3. Tetairoa McMillan had 10 receptions for 160 yards for Arizona. Oklahoma freshman Jackson Arnold threw for 361 yards and two touchdowns, but also had three interceptions in his first career start.\nUNDATED (AP) — The Memphis Tigers have a rare luxury chasing program history with all the comforts of home Friday against Iowa State in the Liberty Bowl. The Cyclones will work from Memphis’ usual sideline, pushing the Tigers to the visitors’ side. Memphis will get to use its own locker room. Memphis is trying to post the fifth season in program history with at least 10 victories and fourth since 2014. The Tigers also can get some payback for losing this bowl in 2017 to Iowa State by a single point despite being ranked. That's the only win for Iowa State in six previous games in the state of Tennessee.\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Devin Brown is about to become the first Ohio State quarterback to make his first career start in a bowl game. The sophomore starts Friday night against Missouri in the Cotton Bowl. He hasn't played in a game since Oct. 21, but takes over after Kyle McCord left the seventh-ranked Buckeyes earlier this season for Syracuse. Ninth-ranked Missouri has All-American running back Cody Schrader, two-year starting quarterback Brady Cook and playmaking receiver Luther Burden III. The Tigers have a three-game winning streak since opening November with a 30-21 loss at then-No. 1 Georgia.\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Alabama is covering every angle when it comes to preparing for Monday’s College Football Playoff semifinal game against Michigan at the Rose Bowl. That includes making sure their equipment and films do not get hacked in the wake of the Wolverines’ sign-stealing allegations from earlier this season. Wide receiver Isaiah Bond and running back Jase McClellan say watching film has been restricted to only as a group and with coaches at team facilities. McLellan also says that players are not receiving practice film directly on their iPads, and that only coaches are receiving it.\nNORMAN, Okla. (AP) — Javian McCollum scored 23 points and Otega Oweh added 16 as No. 12 Oklahoma bounced back from its first loss of the season with an 88-72 win over Central Arkansas. Sam Godwin scored 14 points and Jalon Moore had 12 points and nine rebounds for the Sooners (11-1), who were back in action for the first time since losing 81-69 to then-No. 11 North Carolina on Dec. 20. Johannes Kirsipuu scored 16 points to lead four players in double figures for Central Arkansas, which shot 47% from the field.\nLUBBOCK, Texas (AP) — Pop Isaacs scored a career-high 28 points and Texas Tech won its fifth straight, rolling past Sam Houston 96-60. Davon Barnes had 18 points for the Bearkats (6-8) and Marcus Boykin added 10. The Red Raiders made 15 of 33 3-point attempts, with Isaacs hitting five and Walton four, and shot 53% overall (42 of 60). They only had seven turnovers while scoring 15 points off 15 Sam Houston miscues. They also had a 16-0 difference in fast-break points. Joe Toussaint had 10 points in the first half, with four coming on free throws in an 8-0 run that doubled the Red Raiders’ lead to 16 at 41-25. Then in the last minute, Isaacs had consecutive 3-pointers, giving him 16 points and Texas Tech a 48-29 lead.\nSANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) — Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco failed to show up for a meeting with a prosecutor who is investigating him for an alleged relationship with a minor. Prosecutor Olga Diná Llaverías says the investigation will continue regardless of Franco’s no-show. She waited for the All-Star player and his lawyers at her office, but they didn't appear. Dominican prosecutors and police showed up on Tuesday at a Franco property in Baní, his hometown about 37 miles southwest of Santo Domingo. They did not find the 22-year-old player to request he appeared for testimony.\nLIENZ, Austria (AP) — Mikaela Shiffrin has held on to a big first-run lead to win a women’s World Cup giant slalom for the American’s record-extending 92nd career victory. Shiffrin lost most of her advantage as she skied a rather conservative final run and posted only the 17th fastest time. But it was enough to beat Federica Brignone by 0.38 seconds. The result sent the Italian to the top of the discipline standings. Sara Hector of Sweden dropped from second after the opening run to third. It was Shiffrin’s 22nd career win in GS but first this season.\nBOSTON (AP) — Hoping to avoid a 28th straight loss that would match the longest losing streak in NBA history, the Detroit Pistons forced overtime against the league-best Celtics before Boston recovered to win 128-122. Despite making it to overtime for the first time in the skid, Detroit matched the “Trust the Process” Philadelphia 76ers with 28 consecutive losses. The Pistons need a win at home against Toronto on Saturday night to avoid breaking the record. Kristaps Porzingis had 35 points for Boston and Jayson Tatum finished with 31 points and 10 assists. Boston won its fourth straight and ninth in 10 games. Cade Cunningham led Detroit with 31 points and nine assists.\nTHURSDAY SCORES\nNATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE\nFinal Cleveland 37 N-Y Jets 20\nTOP-25 COLLEGE FOOTBALL\nFinal (14)Arizona 38 (12)Oklahoma 24\nFinal Boston College 23 (17)SMU 14\nFinal Kansas St. 28 (19)NC State 19\nFinal Rutgers 31, Miami 24\nTOP-25 COLLEGE BASKETBALL\nFinal (12)Oklahoma 88 Cent.
