  "body_text": "Saturday, 21st Dec 2019 13:58\nIpswich Town Women’s game at Leyton Orient on Sunday has been postponed due to a waterlogged pitch.\nThe match is the Tractor Girls’ second game in two weeks to succumb to the weather with last Sunday’s home fixture with AFC Basildon also having been called off.\nThe Blues are next in action in the third round of the FA Cup on Sunday 5th January when they face Portsmouth at the Goldstar Ground, Felixstowe.\nAnother postponement means football in 2019 has now come to an end. I’d like to thank the players, staff & supporters for all their efforts over the last 12 months. I wish you all a very Merry Christmas & have some well earned rest before we get back at it on 5th Jan ðŸšœ pic.twitter.com/v6CYmuvZhP\n— Joe Sheehan (@joe_sheehan1) December 21, 2019\nPhoto: Ross Halls\nPlease report offensive, libellous or inappropriate posts by using the links provided.\n- Page:\n- 1\nYou need to login in order to post your comments",
