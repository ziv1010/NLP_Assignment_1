A key FIFA decision goes Cristiano Ronaldo’s way. Who’d have thought it?\nOn the way:\n- CR7 avoids World Cup ban\n- FIFA venue controversy\n- Estevao, take a bow\n- Cup draw apology\nWorld Cup hots up: Why was Ronaldo’s ban suspended?\nThe “will FIFA ban Cristiano Ronaldo for the start of the World Cup?” suspense was fun while it lasted. Those of you who staked your chips on “not a chance in hell”, collect your winnings now.\nAdvertisement\nA 12-day wait between Ronaldo’s red card for violent conduct against the Republic of Ireland and a decision on how to discipline him at least made it look as if the matter was given due consideration, but you could hear the sound of millions across the globe fainting as the cards fell in his favour.\nViolent conduct, typically, carries a three-match suspension. While Ronaldo’s dismissal forced him to automatically sit out Portugal’s final World Cup qualifier — a 9-1 rout of Armenia, in which they missed him greatly — FIFA’s disciplinary committee was compelled to consider whether a longer ban was appropriate.\nThe committee concluded that greater punishment should be imposed. And since Ronaldo’s red card had come in a competitive fixture, any ban would apply to competitive fixtures, too, meaning he would potentially miss the opening games of the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\nBut would you believe it? The kind men and women on the panel extended his ban to three games while conveniently ruling that the last two matches of it should be suspended “under a one-year probationary period”. If the 40-year-old keeps his discipline on the pitch for the next six months, he’s good to go.\nThis will doubtless relieve the World Cup’s organisers (also FIFA), who would rather one of the sport’s most famous faces was present and correct for its big event. After all, it’s Ronaldo’s sixth World Cup, and he was at the White House with Donald Trump and Gianni Infantino last week. He’s only just getting into the swing of things.\nTo be serious for a second, I’ve seen worse elbows than Ronaldo’s swing at Dara O’Shea. All the same, violent conduct is violent conduct — and in an era of moral panic about football going soft, it’s good to know that missing a cakewalk against Armenia is what the custodians of the sport think the offence is worth.\nAdvertisement\nSpain-Argentina final?\nFIFA has confirmed all seedings and procedures for its World Cup draw on December 5 (more on the logistics of that event shortly).\nBy far the most interesting development is that for the first time, the world governing body is actively keeping the top seeds apart. Spain (ranked No 1) and Argentina (ranked No 2) are on separate sides of the draw and can’t meet until the final. France (No 3) and England (No 4) won’t play either of those two until the semis, or meet until the final.\nAll play-off qualifiers, meanwhile, will be lodged in Pot Four, meaning a tough, tough group for four-time winners Italy if they edge through in March. Check out all the permutations here.\nKennedy Center controversy\nThe Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. will stage the draw a week on Friday. With draining inevitability, FIFA’s hiring of it is the source of some controversy.\nA U.S. Senate committee has been looking into alleged “cronyism and corruption” at the venue. Henry Bushnell and Adam Crafton have the full details, but a contract now being considered by the Senate Committee appears to list FIFA’s rental fee as precisely zero ($0.00 — no conversion to UK pounds needed).\nKennedy Center president Ric Grenell, however, fired back, saying: “FIFA has paid millions, plus covered all expenses.” The money, The Athletic was told, amounts to a $2.4million (£1.8m) donation and further sponsorship opportunities worth $5m. What people want to know is why the finances have been structured this way, rather than standard hire costs. As yet, there’s no answer.\nNews round-up\n- He’s been linked with Barcelona, but before Bayern Munich’s clash with Arsenal in the Champions League later today, Harry Kane says he expects to stick with Bayern next summer. It’s hard to see why he’d want to leave, to be honest.\n- Borussia Dortmund fans unfurled a profanity-filled banner at their Champions League tie against Villarreal, protesting La Liga’s attempt to stage a Spanish league match in the United States. I’ll let you fill in the blanks.\n- The NWSL championship game set a new TV record, with an average of more than a million viewers for the first time. It’s a 22 per cent jump on the 2024 final.\n- Xabi Alonso was careful not to say too much when asked about his relationship with Vinicius Junior in the aftermath of our story about the Brazilian refusing to sign a new deal at Real Madrid due to his awkward relationship with Alonso.\n- Ex-Tottenham Hotspur defender Mauricio Taricco has been working as an assistant at South Korean club Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors. He’s quitting after being given a five-game ban for allegedly making a racist gesture during a match. Taricco denied he was being racist. Jeonbuk defended him and planned to appeal.\nA star is born: Estevao, 18, leads the way for Chelsea\nIt’s rarely wise to tempt fate with Chelsea, but they’re sneaking up on the rails. They rose to second in the Premier League at the weekend, and last night’s demolition of Barcelona at Stamford Bridge ranks as one of Enzo Maresca’s best results as head coach.\nAdvertisement\nChelsea had Barca on toast from minute one, and a 3-0 win against 10 men was as comprehensive as it reads on paper. The pick of the goals was brilliant, scored (above) by the tricky Estevao, whose transfer fee of £28.7m might be weighty for a raw 18-year-old Brazilian, but it looks like money well spent. No wonder Raphinha was recently touting him and Lamine Yamal as the stars of their generation.\nManchester City, on the other hand, threw in another of those weeks they’re prone to: defeat to Newcastle United on Saturday, defeat to Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League yesterday. Malik Tillman shone for Leverkusen, and Weston McKennie scoring for Juventus won’t disappoint Mauricio Pochettino either. But Jonathan David sealing Juve’s 3-2 win at Bodo/Glimt was better news again for Canada. His three-month goal drought is over, and not before time.\nChair has his say: ‘I just wish I could take it back’\nIlias Chair is a skilful and accomplished Championship (English second tier) midfielder for Queens Park Rangers. His international career with Morocco took him to the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.\nThe biggest headlines about him, though, concerned an incident two years earlier in which a man suffered serious injuries after being hit over the head with a stone during an altercation in southern Belgium. Chair was prosecuted for the attack and sentenced to two years in prison, a penalty reduced to community service and a fine on appeal.\nHe has spoken to Sarah Shephard about the assault, saying: “I just wish I could take it back. My sincere apologies to that whole family (of the victim).” It’s a compelling interview, the likes of which you won’t often read.\nChair, 28, isn’t asking for sympathy, and I’m not sure he’s due any, but I would give him credit for talking about something others might prefer to sweep under the carpet. Read Sarah’s chat with him if you can.\nAround TAFC\n- To circle back to Arsenal versus Bayern, Seb Stafford-Bloor has done a super piece on Vincent Kompany’s impressive reign at the German champions. Anybody who starts work at 5am and finishes at 11pm deserves to succeed.\n- Arsenal Women winning the Champions League in May was supposed to herald the dawn of a dominant era. Instead, they’re having a hard time of it this season, and to go by Megan Feringa’s investigation, the culture of their dressing room is far from ideal.\n- I like this: in 1990, Ajax abandoned their long-standing club crest for a fresh design. The Dutch club are now reverting to their original badge, a hand-drawn image of the mythological Greek hero they are named after. Tradition is important.\n- The Athletic FC Podcast tried to figure out just how much pressure Liverpool head coach Arne Slot is under. It’s not minor, put it that way.\n- Most clicked in Tuesday’s TAFC: Idrissa Gueye’s bizarre red card.\nCatch A Match\nSelected games (all times ET/UK and 3pm/8pm unless stated)\nUEFA Champions League (all Paramount+ in U.S. and TNT Sports in UK): Arsenal vs Bayern Munich, Atletico Madrid vs Inter — both DAZN (U.S.); Liverpool vs PSV — ViX; Paris Saint-Germain vs Tottenham Hotspur — ViX.\nAdvertisement\nChampionship: Wrexham vs Bristol City, 2.45pm/7.45pm; West Bromwich Albion vs Birmingham City — both Paramount+/Sky Sports.\nAnd Finally…\nDraws for a tournament like the World Cup can be torturously long (and on that note — gird your loins for next Friday). They also have the capacity to be shambolic, at which point they get entertaining.\nThe draw for the English Women’s League Cup yesterday ticked the second box. The social media influencer conducting it peppered the broadcast with innuendo and, at one stage, pulled a ball out of the bag before putting it back in. She also insulted Tottenham Hotspur, prompting an apology to the club from the Women’s Super League.\nSeemingly, an adjudicator was present, so the pairings were deemed above board. But I’m guessing that TikTok’s GK Barry (for it was she) won’t be invited back.\n📬 Love TAFC? Check out The Athletic’s other newsletters, including Full-Time, for women’s soccer.",
