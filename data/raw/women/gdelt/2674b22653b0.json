The venue is one of the busiest stadiums in the world and ranked No. 1 in the U.S. for both tickets sold and ticket revenue in 2024 per Pollstar. MetLife Stadium was named \"Highest Grossing Stadium of the Year\" nine times by Billboard and \"Venue of the Year\" by StadiumBusiness. In 2021, MetLife Stadium became the first NFL Stadium to join the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's Sports for Climate Action Framework, which aims to achieve global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions goals.\nAbout the New York Football Giants: A cornerstone franchise of the National Football League, the New York Football Giants began play in 1925. The Giants have won eight championships: 1927, 1934, 1938, 1956, 1986, 1990, 2007 and 2011. After twice winning two titles in five years, the Giants are the only NFL franchise with Super Bowl victories in four consecutive decades.

The Jets won Super Bowl III, defeating the NFL's Baltimore Colts in 1969 – a victory many believe led to the 1970 merger of the AFL and NFL that set the foundation for today's league. The organization takes great pride in a long-standing, year-round commitment to their community by implementing impactful programs that will positively influence the lives of young men and women in the tri-state area, particularly in disadvantaged communities.
