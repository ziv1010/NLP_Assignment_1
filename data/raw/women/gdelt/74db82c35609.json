Discussions may stray into ‘tinfoil’ territory, but the goal is to peel back and confirm information so we can make informed decisions and actions. Incredible as it seems, “tinfoil” conspiracy theories have fast become realities so they can no longer be ignored outright, but must be... -\nX: Musk Estimates the Fraud is $1.5 Trillion Per Year\nElon Musk @elonmusk My lower bound guess for how much fraud there is nationally is ~20% of the Federal budget, which would mean $1.5 trillion per year. Probably much higher. -\n‘Conservatives Want Women In Handmaid’s Tale Outfits,’ Declares Liberal Wearing Hijab\nMINNEAPOLIS, MN — Democratic Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan donned a full hijab for a press conference where she warned that conservatives want to force women into Handmaid's Tale outfits. Flanagan adjusted her head covering as she cautioned that Republicans would like nothing more than to force women to cover their bodies and be treated as property. \"If Republicans had their way, women would all be shoved into Handmaid outfits,\" explained Flanagan as she replaced her mouth covering. \"They want a culture where young women are stripped of their rights and become totally subjugated to men. Women wouldn't be allowed to... -\nWho Secretly Destroyed Two Russian Nuclear Reactors?\nIn December 2024, a Russian cargo vessel sank under mysterious circumstances. No one paid much attention to it, though, because it was one of many interesting things happening in the world at the time. However, a year-long Spanish investigation has revealed that the ship was carrying two nuclear reactors, with delivery intended for North Korea. Today's video explores the investigation and who might be responsible. I think the content is super captivating. The torpedo though, might be supercavitating -\nMinnesota’s Quality ‘Learing’ Center ‘Bustling’ with Children After Viral Video, Resident: ‘Never Seen Kids Go In There Until Today’\nThe now-infamous Quality “Learing” Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, has reportedly been “trucking in” children following the release of citizen journalist Nick Shirley’s viral video alleging fraud. The Quality “Learing” Center — which found itself at the center of national attention and mockery after Shirley’s video showed the facility misspelled “learning” on its sign — was “bustling” with children on Monday, with one resident telling the New York Post they “never” saw children “go in there until today.” The local told the outlet that seeing children at the daycare center on Monday — just three days after Shirley shared his video... -\nIt's not just Minnesota. Or just daycares. The deepest government honeypot is blue-state Medicaid.\nYou’ve seen the video. Nick Shirley, a citizen journalist (aka a journalist), traveled around Minnesota looking for fraud at state-funded daycare centers largely run by Somali immigrants. He found obvious evidence of malfeasance — and a worldwide audience on X. Shirley’s 42-minute video has now been viewed 115 million times, even forcing a huffy response from Governor Tim Walz (last seen exaggerating his military service). Shirley deserves the attention. But when it comes to waste, fraud, and abuse in government programs, nothing holds a candle to health-care spending. Especially in blue states. And especially since the Affordable Care Act and... -\nMiami pulls biggest upset in College Football Playoff history with 24-14 win over Ohio State\nMore than 20 years after it was on the other end of one of the biggest upsets in BCS history, Miami pulled off the biggest upset of the College Football Playoff era on New Year’s Eve. The No. 10 Hurricanes beat No. 2 Ohio State 24-14 in the Cotton Bowl to advance to the semifinal round of the playoff. Miami was a 9.5-point underdog at kickoff. Before Wednesday night, the biggest upset in playoff history — in either the four-team playoff or the current 12-team format — was Ohio State’s win over Alabama as a 7.5-point underdog on Jan. 1,... -\nNYE Washington Monument illumination kicks off Trump’s yearlong America 250 celebration\n17 min video Stunning Historical Beautiful -\n“Brussels doesn’t believe its policies have failed: it believes you are the problem”—Sociologist Ashley Frawley\nEducation has become one of the main ideological battlegrounds across the Western world and particularly within the European Union. Although the EU treaties recognise education as a national competence, in recent years Brussels has developed an increasingly sophisticated architecture of programmes, funding streams and partnerships with NGOs aimed at exerting direct influence over what happens in classrooms—especially in areas related to identity, gender and sexuality. It is in this context that the report Indoctrinating Children: How Brussels Embeds Gender Identity in the Classroom, published by MCC Brussels and authored by sociologist Ashley Frawley, must be understood. The study documents how... -\nBREAKING: Historic Vondelkerk Church in Amsterdam just burned to the ground on New Year’s Eve\nSuch a coincidence that so many European churches are being burned to the ground. They should install more extinguishers. -\nFlorida's favorite grocery store slammed for 'criminal' prices as customers protest 'ridiculous' cost of meat\nPublix has long been considered Florida's favorite supermarket, but it seems customers are turning their backs on the grocery giant. One frustrated shopper recently took to Reddit to air their grievances after picking up a prime tenderloin steak at a Publix store in Yulee, Florida. A photo of the package showed the meat priced at a jaw-dropping $61.49 — or $49.99 per pound. 'This is criminal,' the customer wrote. 'You can get a full ribeye or tenderloin dinner with table bread, 2 sides and softdrinks in Florida at a Outback, texas roadhouse or Longhorn for $26 - $31,' one wrote.... -\n[Catholic Caucus Devotional] My Catholic Life! Catholic Daily Reflections: The Overflowing Heart of the Mother of God - Thursday, January 1, 2026\nDaily Readings from the USCCBSolemnity of Mary, the Holy Mother of God The Octave Day of the Nativity of the LordThe shepherds went in haste to Bethlehem and found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known the message that had been told them about this child. All who heard it were amazed by what had been told them by the shepherds. And Mary kept all these things, reflecting on them in her heart. Luke 2:16–19 At the birth of Christ, the Blessed Mother’s Immaculate Heart was full of love and... -\nNetherlands New Year chaos sees two killed by fireworks as thugs battle in the streets, 'unprecedented' violence and 19th century church destroyed - as country bans pyrotechnics today\nThe New Year festivities in the Netherlands left two people dead, saw 'unprecedented' violence against police and destroyed a 19th century Amsterdam church. A 17-year-old boy from Nijmegen and a 38-year-old man from Aalsmeer were killed in fireworks accidents. Three others were left seriously injured. One person has been arrested in connection to the teenager's death, but authorities have not yet revealed any information on the suspect's identity and an investigation is ongoing. -\nThe Second Horseman of the Apocalypse - Human nature, demographics, and the decline of the West.\nFrom Wikimedia Commons: Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Viktor Vasnetsov, 1887). Predictably, human nature remains constant across the centuries, driven by the same primal impulses—ambition, fear, greed, and tribal loyalty—that fuel conflict and upheaval. These enduring drives and emotions ensure that humanity cannot permanently exorcise evil; it persists, resurfacing in ever-shifting forms. In the twentieth century, Western civilization teetered on the brink of annihilation, barely surviving the twin horrors of Nazism and Bolshevism. These ideologies, shrouded in propaganda myths about “race” and “class”, respectively, unleashed unprecedented destruction, claiming tens of millions of lives and threatening the very foundations of liberal... -\nIconic Amsterdam church destroyed after devastating fire rips through spire during New Year's celebrations\nAn iconic church in Amsterdam has been partially destroyed after a fire ripped through its spire in the early hours of New Year's Day. The Vondelkerk, which sits just next to the Dutch capital's famous Vondelpark, collapsed in on itself as 2026 celebrations unfolded. The blaze is thought to have started just after midnight, and was soon declared a major fire and a regional emergency. By 2.30am local time, the inferno was still raging - with authorities warning locals about the heavy smoke. The blaze went on to cut off the electricity of almost 100 nearby homes. Dramatic images from... -\nThe Garden Thread - January, 2026\nThe MONTHLY Gardening Thread is a gathering of folks that love soil, seeds and plants of all kinds. From complete newbies that are looking to start that first potted plant, to gardeners with some acreage, to Master Gardener level and beyond, we would love to hear from you. If you have specific question about a plant/problem you are having, please remember to state the Growing Zone where you are located. This thread is a non-political respite. No matter what, you won’t be flamed, and the only dumb question is the one that isn’t asked. It is impossible to hijack the... -\nSecond highest number of Channel crossings by migrants recorded in 2025\nA total of 41,472 migrants arrived in the UK in 2025 after crossing the English Channel – the second highest annual figure on record. The Home Office confirmed on Thursday that no migrants made the journey on New Year’s Eve, continuing a run of no crossings over the festive period. It means the overall number of arrivals last year finished 9% below the all-time high of 45,774 in 2022. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said Sir Keir Starmer’s plan to “smash the gangs” had been “a complete disaster” and the “one in, one out” deal with France is a “farce”.... -\nChina's EV Car Bubble is Finally Bursting! (you tube 13 minutes)\nChina's EV Car Bubble is Finally Bursting! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mG-eJDtySU8 186,000 Views Living in China for 14 years, one thing I noticed about China is that China is wasteful. I'm talking from the top to the very bottom. Everybody is guilty of being wasteful in China. It's part of Chinese society. If you go out for a meal with friends, you order a huge amount and there's always leftovers that just get thrown away. Especially if you're trying to show off, this is part of what you do. If you're a government official, you're going to have every single dish in the... -\n🇺🇸Pray For The Peace of Jerusalem 🇮🇱(1/1/26)[Prayer]\n🇺🇸Pray For The Peace of Jerusalem 🇮🇱(1/1/26)[Prayer]A New Study For A New YearGenesis 2:77 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.New International Version (NIV) Holy Bible, New International Version®, NIV® Copyright ©1973, 1978, 1984, 2011 by Biblica, Inc.® Used by permission.
