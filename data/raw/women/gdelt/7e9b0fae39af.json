  "body_text": "The downfall of an Arsenal wonderkid who was hailed as a 'massive talent' by Arsene Wenger aged 19 but is now facing jail for drug smuggling\nHailed by Arsenal's legendary manager Arsene Wenger as a 'massive talent', Jay Emmanuel-Thomas once seemed to have the world at his feet.\nSo how did this football prodigy end up facing jail after being convicted of trying to smuggle £600,000 worth of drugs?\nAnd what possibly could have persuaded the Londoner, who was still playing professional football during the plot, to risk everything to pursue a life of crime?\nWind back to 2010 and things were looking very different for Emmanuel-Thomas.\nAged 19, he had just made his Premier League debut for Arsenal against Chelsea, hot on the heels of captaining its youth team to the FA Youth Cup.\nThe technically gifted, agile striker was lauded by Wenger for his 'outstanding quality', who predicted he would 'not only be a good player but a great player'.\n'It is down to how far he wants to go because he has big potential,' the Frenchman added.\nDespite his promising start, Emmanuel-Thomas struggled to stay in the Arsenal first team.\nEmmanuel-Thomas (centre) won the FA Youth Cup with Arsenal in 2009, alongside Jack Wilshere (left) and Sanchez Watt (right)\nEmmanuel-Thomas pleaded guilty at Chelmsford Crown Court in Essex to cannabis importation\nEmmanuel-Thomas appears to have began building ties with weed growers after a transfer to PTT Rayong, an obscure Thai team based just south of the capital, Bangkok\nHe went on loan to Ipswich Town and then Bristol City, where he scored 24 goals in 82 appearances, before a spell at QPR.\nBut the move that would prove his downfall came in 2019, when he accepted a transfer to PTT Rayong, an obscure Thai team based just south of the capital, Bangkok.\nThailand had become the first East Asian country to decriminalise cannabis just a year earlier, a decision that has led to a booming industry of commercial and cottage growers.\nThe profits to be made smuggling Thai cannabis into the UK clearly tempted Emmanuel-Thomas, who is believed to have acquired contacts in the country's weed industry during his short spell at PTT Rayong, which folded the year he joined.\nAnd despite continuing his professional career with an Indian team and several Scottish clubs, including Aberdeen, the footballer pursued a drug smuggling business on the side.\nThis was finally exposed in September 2024, when officers from the National Crime Agency arrested him at his home in Gourock, Renfrewshire.\nIt followed the arrest of his girlfriend, Yasmin Piotrowska, 33, and her 28-year-old friend Rosie Rowland, 28, who he had promised £2,500 in cash to travel to Thailand for an all-expenses-paid trip.\nIn return, they were asked to bring home two suitcases each, which the pair had been assured contained gold, Chelmsford Crown Court heard.\nBorder Force officers stopped the footballer's partner and her friend at Stansted and found them with £600,000 of cannabis in their suitcases\nDrug dogs can sniff cannabis even if it is kept inside vacuum-sealed bags\nDuring his professional career, the footballer also played for Bristol City, QPR, MK Dons and Gillingham\nBut after flying business class from Bangkok to Stansted, via Dubai, they were stopped by Border Force officers - who opened the cases to find vacuum-packed cannabis with a street value of £600,000.\nAfter being arrested and charged with drug importation offences, detectives began investigating the source of the drugs.\nThey soon identified Emmanuel-Thomas, who had paid the women for a similarly lavish trip in July.\nFollowing his arrest, he told NCA officers: 'I just feel sorry for the girls.'\nThe footballer was sacked by Scottish Championship side Greenock Morton following the charges, which he initially denied.\nBut he went on to plead guilty at Chelmsford Crown Court in Essex to cannabis importation between July 1, 2024 and September 2, 2024.\nIt is believed Emmanuel-Thomas was the intermediary between suppliers in Thailand and drug pushers in the UK.\nAppearing in court, he expressed regret for tricking his girlfriend into the drugs plot, and charges against the 33-year-old and her friend were subsequently dropped.\nThe footballer kept an Instagram account, where he shared images of himself relaxing off the pitch\nEmmanuel-Thomas - pictured in 2009 - was described by Arsene Wenger as having 'outstanding quality' and had 'big potential'\nThe footballer is far from the first Brit to fall foul of the law while attempting to profit from Thai-grown cannabis, with dozens off tourists caught trying to hide weed in their luggage.\nGrowing concern about the issue has prompted the country's government to vow to tighten cannabis laws, which could include requiring users to present a prescription.\nMore than 50 British nationals had been arrested in Thailand for attempting to smuggle cannabis since July, according to UK officials.\nSuspects recently identified by Thai police include Mark Siemaszkiewicz, 46, Richard McMahon, 46, Oluwatosin Peace Adefila, 27, and Bose Esther Fakuade, 26.\nThe group were pulled aside at the airport on the island of Koh Samui and found with 144kg of cannabis in several 32-inch long cases, police say.\nA spokesman said they had planned to bring the cannabis into the UK as part of a 'debt-clearing arrangement'.\nFour British tourists were recently arrested for allegedly trying to smuggle cannabis stuffed in seven giant suitcases from Thailand to the UK. Pictured: Oluwatosin Peace Adefila, 27\nRichard McMahon, 46, was also part of the group. Thai police said they had planned to bring the cannabis into the UK as part of a 'debt-clearing arrangement'\nIf convicted, the British tourists could face up to 10 years in prison\nDavid Philips, NCA senior investigating officer, said: 'Organised crime groups make significant profits by trafficking and selling perceived high-quality cannabis legally grown in the US, Canada and Thailand illegally in the UK.\n'Organised criminals like Thomas can be very persuasive and offer payment to couriers. But the risk of getting caught is very high and it simply isn't worth it.'\nEmmanuel-Thomas, a father of two, is now behind bars at HMP Chelmsford and will return to Chelmsford Crown Court for sentencing at a date.",
