  "body_text": "The Israeli regime’s chess team has been forced to withdraw from a high-profile international tournament after organizers prevented it from playing under the regime’s flag in protest at Tel Aviv’s ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip.\nThe Athletic, The New York Times’ sports journalism department, reported the development on Friday concerning the seven-strong team that had planned on competing in the Basque Country Chess Championship in the Spanish town of Sestao.\nThe event, officially known as the Basque Country Open, is slated to go underway later this week. Upon launch, it would mark the 40th edition of the tournament that features hundreds of players from dozens of countries.\nThe report cited the organizers as saying, “We want to raise our voices to reject the crimes committed against the Palestinian civilian population in the Gaza strip and the indiscriminate attacks by the Israeli army.”\nUpon facing the rejection, the Israeli competitors did not accept to play under the flag of the World Chess Federation (FIDE) either.\nCommenting on the matter, Sestao’s chess club said the request from the organizers to ban the regime’s flag served as “a sign of rejection of Israel’s systematic violation of human rights.”\nThrough their rejection, the organizers sought to “express their strongest condemnation of the genocide being carried out by Israel in Gaza,” the club added.\nThe event, the report added, is now set to go underway, with only flags of Spain’s autonomous communities and the Palestinian flag being displayed on the tables.\nIt added that the organizers had originally planned to bar the Israeli team from the tournament altogether.\nThe Israeli regime’s October 2023-present war of genocide has so far claimed the lives of more than 64,750 Palestinians, mostly women and children.\nHundreds of the victims have perished due to the regime’s near-total siege of the territory that runs concomitantly with its incessant bombardments of the densely-populated coastal sliver.\nPro-Palestine groups and football fans launch a boycott campaign across Europe against Israeli teams, demanding federations take action before the 2026 World Cup.\n— Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) September 12, 2025\nFollow Press TV on Telegram: https://t.co/LWoNSpkc2J pic.twitter.com/L3vpbE7wuM\nThe war has escalated international resentment of the regime’s atrocities, triggering far-and-wide acts of protest, including thousands-strong demonstrations and requests for Israeli officials to be banned from national territories.",
