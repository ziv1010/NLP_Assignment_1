After consultations with the medical team, the decision has been made that he can no longer continue in the competition.'\n'He's doing okay and is receiving the best medical care!' before announcing that another contestant, Matt, would be taking his place.\nReturning to the arena with his leg in a brace, Chung said: 'Yeah, I'm disappointed to not be able to finish this race but the support I've had from the crowd has been incredible and it's really helped me get through it. So thank you to you guys!'\nElla-Mae Rayner/Comet\nElla-Mae Rayner, a former gymnast and cheerleader, also known as Comet, ruptured three ligaments and broke her ankle and foot during the games\nEven before the Gladiators reboot hit screens, one of its stars, Comedy, had already been forced off the show.\nComet, whose real name Ella-Mae Rayner, was climbing a 30-foot high wall when she fell - breaking her ankle and foot and rupturing three ligaments in her leg.\nThe cheerleader and gymnast, 28, was treated at the Sheffield's Utilia Arena, where Gladiators was filmed, before she was sent to hospital and operated on.\nElla-Mae's fall, which occurred in June 2023, will not be aired and it is not yet known if she will appear in future episodes this series.\nElla-Mae is currently undergoing physiotherapy for her shattered heel and has already had surgery performed on her.\nSpeaking to The Sun, Ella-Mae said: 'It just goes to show that we aren't acting. This isn't WWE, this is one of the toughest shows on TV.\n'The injury was really, really tough but I had the team around me and everyone was amazing. I couldn't have asked for a better medical team.'\nHer injuries were deemed too nasty to show on air, and lla-Mae is currently undergoing physiotherapy for her shattered heel after receiving surgery\nShe continued: 'I am nearly [recovered] but it is always going to be an injury I know about. But it is not going to stop me doing what I want to do. You are going face to face and it is contact, so injuries are part and parcel of it. Comet is here to stay.'\nNot long after her accident, Ella-Mae, who wasn't the only Gladiator to suffer an injury during filming, took to Instagram and wrote:\n'Life is not about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving - right now, this quote couldn't ring truer.\n'During the filming of one of the games I sustained a severe foot injury.\n'Multiple scans and X-rays later I found out that I had broken my ankle and foot in multiple places, including the talus and something known as a lisfranc injury, ruptured 3 ligaments and dislocated a bone.\n'I am now resting up following an operation to fix my foot and stabilise the broken bones. This is just a minor blip in the road and ignites the fire in me to come back better and stronger than ever before.
