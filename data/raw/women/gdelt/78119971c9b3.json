  "body_text": "Following a career that, to this point, has included very successful stops in both coaching and administration, Ryan Bisio has been named permanent College of the Redwoods Director of Athletics, said a press release from the school. Bisio is a Humboldt County native and has sandwiched a stint as Athletic Director of St. Bernard’s High around jobs coaching title-winning Arcata High and College of the Redwoods men’s basketball teams, the latter of which he led to the Sweet Sixteen of the CCCAA playoffs in his first season just a year removed from a winless campaign in 2018-19.\nBisio, who professes a love for and college degree in music theory, which he weaves into his basketball coaching, went to St. Bernard’s and redshirted on scholarship at College of Notre Dame. He then played collegiately at Santa Rosa Junior College and Cal State Monterey Bay (receiving his degree in music) before getting his graduate degree in coaching and athletic administration at Concordia University in Irvine. His career coaching would lead him to Europe before he found out about the Arcata High job in 2014 while visiting friends and family. He was hired there and also “worked locally as an instructional aide for students with severe physical disabilities, an experience that shaped his philosophy of patience, empathy and connection,” according to a CR press release.\nAfter amassing an 82-41 record at Arcata High and winning three Big Five and three Dick Niclai titles, he made the jump to CR with the assistance of a multitude of local talents that helped the team succeed immediately in 2019-20. While there, he would win multiple Golden Valley Conference titles, making it into numerous playoffs while being named the 2023 California Community College Coach of the Year award.\nThe last couple years he has been working as interim Director of Athletics at CR under longtime AD Bob Brown, who gave Bisio his initial opportunity at CR, before the official transition via the press release Tuesday. Brown had previously coached baseball for 15 years there before moving into the assistant AD role in 2015 and AD in 2017. With him looking to retire in the near future, there has been a bit of a “succession plan” in recent years since 2023-24, as Bisio has assisted Brown, who still is the Director of the Physical Education and Kinesiology Department. He also works in Student Life as a conduct officer.\nBisio has coached men’s basketball and taught as the transition occurs.\n“I knew a little bit of Ryan from his past as a player and his coaching at Arcata,” said Brown of when Bisio first started coaching at CR. “And then when he moved on athletic directing and in conduct at St. Bernard’s. I was familiar with him but didn’t know him personally, just some from his days as a player. I coached baseball, and he was a pretty decent player back in the day when I was a coach at CR. But basketball was his first love, where he was successful as both a player and coach.\n“When we were looking to hire, I got some really positive feedback on him and what set him apart, including just the connection that we made from his interview forward. From that time, he came in with a very shared mission and values regarding the culture of a successful athletic program and teams and demonstrated that right from the get-go by turning our men’s basketball program into a powerhouse right away. And the impact that he had on the athletic program as a whole, the energy infused with the team’s success, really helped build the culture we’ve been trying to drill home the last couple years at CR.”\nRegarding Bisio’s most recent hire, Brown offered, “Internally, in looking at it, I was asked who I felt might be good to take over the athletic director role, and I immediately thought of Ryan a couple years ago. With the growth in our department, we’ve brought football back, men’s and women’s wrestling, now rodeo. We’ve gotten much larger and have our most participants ever.\n“With that growth and to sustain that with student success, you have to grow internally as well.” Brown says he was provided that support as AD, and Bisio immediately came to his mind when the new opportunity arose. As the years passed and the transition became viable, Brown said, “I think he has all of the qualities to make that [student success and sustainable growth] happen.”\nCurrent CR men’s basketball coach Justin Claus, Bisio’s partner in crime for many years since the program’s re-invigoration, said of their camaraderie, “It means a lot; he’s one of my best friends at this point, and the past six years together have been life-changing, and I owe him a lot for the opportunity when he got hired bringing me on and my ability to help lead the team. I couldn’t have developed myself anywhere else professionally, and I owe that to him. To see him get the AD job and it become official is great to see, and I’m really excited for him.”\nClaus said Bisio gave him the opportunity to be creative and have autonomy when it came to developing ideas, especially offensively for a high-powered squad, “setting him up in a way I couldn’t have found in a different scenario. It’s not often a head coach probably trusts someone to be as free as I was, and that’s what’s helped me the most. As he’s transitioned, it’s been great to have him around (to) bounce ideas off and get feedback from.”\nClaus also said he saw leading people always as Bisio’s strongest suit, being able to watch as a coach, along with the personal touch he possesses, now with coaches as he once did with players. And as to the basketball legacy he’s left, Claus reflected, “I think everyone who’s been involved in the last five or six years with us are really proud of not only the success but the sustainable style and culture we’ve built, which is something I’m excited to continue. We want to progress, but we never want to sacrifice that; we’re hoping to just sharpen up and execute what we do at a higher level.”\nAsked what led him initially to Brown, CR, and the opportunities inherent there, Bisio said, “I think I’ve benefited from a lot of lucky occurrences in my life and career, the CR men’s basketball job at that time being incredibly fortuitous. I’ve always been compelled to junior college athletics based on the impact it had on me as a student-athlete. It’s such an important transitionary time in all our kids’ lives that I’ve been inspired to provide service in this particular area. For me, that basketball opportunity opened at that perfect time in life, and that’s what led me there.”\nDuring his time at CR, Bisio said he has “really found my voice professionally, not just as a coach but as a leader. The confidence that has always been placed in me by our president Dr. (Keith) Flamer, my former boss Bob Brown and all of my colleagues that have supported me unwaveringly the entire time I’ve worked here. It’s allowed me to establish my own style, and given the opportunity to do that, I think that’s why now I’m in the role I’m in.”\n“A lot of this work, whether it be coaching or adminstrative, comes down to interpersonal communication,” he said of the diversity of his journey. “Particularly, speaking about my European experience, being able to persuade players and educate them with a language barrier kind of forced me to hone in on all the intangibles it takes to communicate effectively and interpersonally. That remains the same regardless of the role in athletics. I think you have to find a way to get to student-athletes’ hearts and minds and a way to inspire their best performance, either in the classroom or on the field or court. I still feel like those tools are incredibly relevant in this role because not only do you have access to a broad spectrum of student-athletes, but you’re doing the same things enabling your coaches to operate with maximum confidence and let it rip with maximum support that I was lucky enough to receive from Dr. Flamer and Bob.”\nBisio, again modestly defaulting to circumstance, marvelled at the caliber of player available to him locally when he first jumped into college coaching, it being “historically very rare.” He also mentioned how coaching at Arcata High really allowed him to establish himself coaching locally again, giving credit to Troy Ghisetti “when I was just a guy in town visiting his dad who just got back from Europe.\n“That helped me find my feet on the North Coast and develop a style and a body of work to create these opportunities down the line,” Bisio said. “I’m incredibly grateful for all the folks in this community who’ve supported me and continue to support CR athletics.”\nBisio’s goals for CR athletics moving forward include it becoming a “prized destination.”\n“I want us to be synonymous with athletic excellence, and I’ve always used Gonzaga’s model,” Bisio said. “I want us to be the Gonzaga of the north in junior college athletics, a remote place where kids want to come and compete and want to be a part of our brand and experience that our leaders can provide.”\nOn the admin side specifically, he wanted to continue to bring new facilities on board. He referred to it being “exciting times with the capitol projects, phase two of Community Stadium and the new fieldhouse, the physical education building and new gym. These are big-ticket items that we have to see all the way through, so I’m committed to that. We’re looking to continue to grow our athletic program’s numbers, which are at an all-time high this year. I want to continue to develop and mentor our leaders, which have direct influence over our kids. That’s what I’m focused on.”\nFinally, asked about the importance of someone in his role having deep local roots and a commitment to Humboldt County, Bisio said, “I think that’s how community college was intended to operate. Members homegrown in a community developing future members, doing so with a unique understanding of the historical context. Back in the old days, you stayed home, played for the local community college, and let it rip. In modern times, it’s a lot different, but this is a very traditional approach to serving our community and it makes me proud.”\nKen McCanless can be reached at 707-441-0526.",
