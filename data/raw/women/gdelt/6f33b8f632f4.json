I just threw up my cream tea all over the keyboard.\nPosted\n28/06/2025 at\n17:21:18\nYeah, but they're playing in the wrong stadium. It's the home of the NFL champion Eagles and seats 68k. Neither of these clubs has much US following, and most of them are in Miami, not Philly.\nNow that was a South American challenge.\nPosted\n28/06/2025 at\n18:10:28\nGood shout Mike. My first visit to Miami surprised me, although it shouldn't have. There were parts, even in the downtown where Spanish was the first language. It was only when they realised you could speak native, they reverted to English.\nSpanish was spoken a lot in San Antonio, Texas, where I spent a lot of time with work, but not as much as in Miami. Default was English.\nI think what you say indicates, that they could have planned this competition better in terms of where teams play.\nNever mind, we're off to Accrington Stanley next month and I've got my ticket!! I hope we don't get summer rain. There doesn't seem to be too much roof coverage.\nPosted\n28/06/2025 at\n18:53:35\nI stepped away to watch the Rugby… then an episode of\nThe Gold.\nSay what you want about the BBC, the entire thing is brilliant — writing, casting, filming, characterisation — all six episodes are brilliant.\nAnd we haven't even started Series 2!\nI hope they go straight to penalties!\nPosted\n28/06/2025 at\n19:10:05\nDanny, I can't imagine why the warm, gentle summer rain so common in England would impact your pleasure in watching the game!\n(Kidding, of course.)\nHave a great time.\nPosted\n28/06/2025 at\n19:17:39\nOh wow... somebody scored.\nPosted\n28/06/2025 at\n19:38:43\nDanny, contact me when you arrive in Accrington. I owe you big time. Or if you need a lift from Merseyside for the Accrington game, get yourself to Southport and I’ll drive you from there.\nPosted\n28/06/2025 at\n20:16:19\nDanny and Brent, hope to see you both at Accrington. Are you going to Blackburn also? I see both games have since sold out.\nPosted\n28/06/2025 at\n20:18:51\nNeil. Yes I’ll be at Blackburn as well.\nPosted\n28/06/2025 at\n20:47:48\nHope to see you there too Brent\nPosted\n28/06/2025 at\n21:04:09\nYes, I'm at both.\nPosted\n28/06/2025 at\n21:16:52\nOff topic sorry but yesterday I took my wife to Chester Zoo*\nAs she’d never been before. I wore that special edition light blue Goodison tee shirt and the number of blues I met and said hello was heartwarming. I don’t know if anyone else has noticed though but the large label with the short history in the back neck of the shirt is fcuking uncomfortable. When it’s hot it sticks to your skin as it’s plastic. I think I’ll save it for winter when I can wear an undershirt.\n* Chester Zoo prides itself as the best zoo in Europe. Most of the animals were in hiding, in fact the only one we saw was a small dog. My wife thought it was a Shih Tzu.\nPosted\n29/06/2025 at\n09:28:24\nMark, you would have to visit Oslo Zoo to get the same \"hello\" if you had the redshite shirt!!!\nPosted\n29/06/2025 at\n10:39:16\nWe switched over to watch the last 15 minutes of the Chelsea match after Germany v England U21s.\nWhen they called the teams off the pitch with 4 minutes of normal time remaining, we couldn't be bothered and decided to call it a night.\nIt was only when I woke up this morning and realised they held the players up in the changing room for two hours, before getting them back on the pitch.\nRidiculous. Why not abandon? At 86 minutes, the result would have stood. Very unhappy Chelsea manager and rightly so.\nBrent, thank you for the kind offer. I'll be up at my sisters for the week, but will take you up on that kind gesture. Looking forward to seeing you and Neil and anyone else travelling, with our bottles of milk.\nMark, on dogs. I picked up my new addition last Tuesday. He's a beauty. I refrained from calling him Sheedy. I would have heard the discontent from the heavens. I wanted a German name, but I've been outvoted by family and he's got an Italian name; Enzo. So now I have Francessca Bella and Enzo. Lion Hunters!!\nPosted\n29/06/2025 at\n16:09:24\nDanny, did you get the new dog from the pound as a sort of salvage hunter?\nPosted\n29/06/2025 at\n17:11:59\nSavage Rhodesian Ridgeback hunters Alan! Unfortunately for them, no Lions near us, so they make do with do with urban foxes and squirrels. One of my previous was a master and caught a few squirrels if she got them in the open!!\nI was looking at the fixtures for this competition for this evening. I might take in Flamengo v Bayern.\nAs I looked on the BBC Sport website, I the Women's International friendlies were listed underneath.\nAustralia v Slovenia\nEngland v Jamaica\nUSA v Republic of Ireland\nJesus. Could the organisers not arrange something more regional? They make Hartlepool v Plymouth on a Wednesday night a short trip.\nPosted\n29/06/2025 at\n17:40:34\nPretty goal by PSG.\nPosted\n29/06/2025 at\n17:53:43\nIts pretty pointless this Club World Cup.\nA phenomenal young PSG side doing what they want against what appears to be a 'Legends' Miami team. Could realistically be 10 nil at HT.\nPosted\n29/06/2025 at\n19:03:34\nUtterly boring competition.\nHowever, PSG movement forwards off the ball shows that you don't have to pass chuffing backwards all the time — please, football teams, learn from it...\nPosted\n29/06/2025 at\n20:45:48\nDo we hold some sort of hope of attracting a South American youngster?\nI have forgotten the name and the club — any ideas?\nPosted\n29/06/2025 at\n21:05:30\nPosted\n29/06/2025 at\n21:24:33\nLooked like a pretty good strike by Harry Kane there... but it took a jammy deflection off a foot and snuck in at the post.\nMight get interesting as I imagine the Brazilians will really have a go now. Maybe Michael Oliver will make some horrendoous decisions to turn the game…???\nPosted\n29/06/2025 at\n21:35:43\nWhat an absolutely brilliantly worked goal from Flamengo. Just scintillating... an absolute rocket over Neuer's head.\nPosted\n29/06/2025 at\n21:41:28\nSecond chance Flamengo have had to break at speed... but absolutely no-one running up in support of the lone man taking the ball forward.\nPosted\n29/06/2025 at\n21:47:56\nGreat strike by Goretzka restores 2-goal lead for Bayern.\nReally poor foul on Kane. Probably worth a red card.\nPosted\n30/06/2025 at\n19:39:11\n@21 Thanks Brendan\nPosted\n01/07/2025 at\n20:42:02\nAlexander Arnold is shocking at defending.\nHe's also now got 'Trent' on the back of his shirt. How long before his mate has 'Jude'.\nHope Real Madrid get battered.\nHow to get rid of these ads and support TW\n© ToffeeWeb",
