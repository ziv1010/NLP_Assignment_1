Proceeds from the event will benefit HU student-athletes through the Hampton Athletics Foundation.\nThe other inductees are Roger deSantis Guedes (tennis), Kellie Wells Brinkley (track and field), Dr. James Griffin (track, football, basketball coach, educator), Cordell Taylor (football) and Patricia Cage-Bibbs (women’s basketball coach).\nLewis, who went to Menchville and Denbigh High, won the 2006 indoor and 2007 outdoor NCAA triple-jump titles. She was a four-time All-American and holds 10 school records.\nMathis was an All-American in football and track and field. In 2004, he led Division I-AA (now known as FCS) with 29.8 yards per reception and 35.5 yards per kickoff return. He was a two-time NCAA East Region champ in the 200-meter dash, and he played in the NFL for the Houston Texans (who drafted him in 2005) and Washington.\nGuedes, from Brazil, was Hampton’s first nationally ranked tennis recruit under coach Robert Screen. Guedes was the 1976 NCAA Division II singles runner-up and doubles champion with Bruce Foxworth, leading the Pirates to the team crown, and got as high as No. 89 in the world rankings.\nBrinkley, a MEAC Hall of Famer, won the 60-meter dash at the USA Indoor Nationals in 2011 and finished the year ranked fourth in the world in the 100-meter hurdles. She won the bronze medal in the 100-meter hurdles at the 2012 Olympics in London.\nGriffin was a 1940 Black All-American at quarterback, and he became Hampton’s head football coach soon afterward. He set school records in the 100-yard dash (9.6 seconds) and 220 (21.3).\nHe was on the university faculty for 46 years, was the first coach in Virginia to allow Black and white athletes to compete together, and is in the CIAA and Athletic Hall of Fame of the Lower Virginia Peninsula. He was on the Hampton school board for eight years.\nTaylor, from Norfolk’s Booker T. Washington High, was a standout cornerback, chosen in the 1998 NFL draft’s second round. He was on three NFL teams, NFL Europe’s Scottish Claymores and the Canadian Football League’s Edmonton Eskimos before serving on the coaching staffs of HU, Savannah State and Norfolk State.\nCage-Bibbs coached Hampton to a 127-83 record from 1997-2004, 95-31 in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference. Her teams won three MEAC tourneys and four regular-season titles. She also coached at Grambling and North Carolina A&T, finishing with a 505-321 record and six NCAA Tournament berths.\nHonored with a Lifetime Achievement Award: Newport News native John “Buster” Jackson, who became a student manager in 1978 and has attended 512 consecutive Pirates football games over 46 seasons. He is now an assistant director of athletics for facilities and equipment operations.\nThe 1985 football squad was named a Team of Distinction for going 10-2 and winning the school’s first CIAA football title since 1931. Those Pirates, including quarterback Marco Stacy and running back Carl Painter, advanced to the Division II playoffs and were recognized as Black college national champs.",
