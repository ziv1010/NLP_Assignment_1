  "body_text": "It is Athens 2004. The Super Falcons arrived in Athens as an emerging force in women’s football. At the time, they were already five-time Women African Cup of Nations (WAFCON) champions.\nAthens would be their second outing at the Olympics after Sydney 2000, where they failed to pick a point exiting at the group stage.\nFour years after Sydney, a spirited squad featuring the likes of Precious Dede, Maureen Mmadu and Mercy Akide would make history by reaching the quarter finals of the event.\nWhere no African team has ventured before, they progressed from the group stage to the quarter finals but lost 2-1 to Germany.\nIn Beijing 2008, Falcons failed to soar as they left the tournament at the group stage without a point.\nTheir underwhelming performance in Beijing was also evident in their failure to qualify for three subsequent editions of the Olympics.\nSixteen years on, Falcons would return from their Olympic wilderness, with relatively young and experienced players, set for the Paris 2024 Olympics glory.\nFor the glory, Falcons will have to ease past Brazil, Spain and Japan, their opponents in Group C.\nArguably and at least on paper, Nigeria has been handed one of the toughest draws in the tournament with all rivals in the group, in the top 10 of the FIFA Women’s World Ranking, while Nigeria rests on 36th position.\nAlthough the nine-time African champions, do not shy away from challenges.\nAt the 2023 FIFA World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, Nigeria was arguably placed in a group of death, with Australia, Canada and the Republic of Ireland but was able to qualify from the group against all odds.\nHowever, exiting the World Cup on penalties to England at the Round of 16 stage.\nThe team earned lots of respect for their tactical ability, resilience in defence and ability to create more chances against quality opponents.\nNigeria boasts of players like six time-CAF Player of the Year Asisat Oshoala, captain Rasheedat Ajibade, goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie, Michelle Alozie and a host of others, who can bring their ‘A’ game to the fore.\nAside second-choice goalkeeper Tochukwu Oluehi, the rest of the squad will be making a debut at the Games and Oshoala, who is primed to spearhead Falcons attack in France, believes the team can secure a medal.\n“I have lots of confidence in the team. We have many young players and we can make things difficult for our opponents,’’ the Bay FC forward, told FIFA.com.\n“ We have many young players and can make things difficult for our opponents. We don’t just think about getting out of the group, I think that we can actually work away with a medal’’.\nNnadozie, current CAF goalkeeper of the year and first African to win the French D1 Arkema Goalkeeper of the season, has been outstanding at goal.\nThe 23-year-old shot-stopper remarkable saves at her Paris FC Club and especially at the 2023 World Cup earns her all the accolades she gets.\nOne of those that comes to mind is her penalty save against Canada’s Christine Sinclair at the previous World Cup, denying the Canadian a chance to become the oldest goal scorer at the tournament.\nCaptain Ajibade has been prolific at the just concluded season, culminating to her becoming the Atletico Madrid Women’s Player of the Season 2023/2024\nThe 24-year-old scored 10 goals and provided eight assists for Athletico in the campaign, helping her side secure qualification to next season’s UEFA Women’s Champions League Preliminary round.\nIn the Paris 2024 Olympic qualifiers against South Africa, Ajibade scored the only goal in the 1-0 aggregate win against Bayana Bayana.\nAlthough, a lack of action in the three months preceding the Games, aside a friendly loss to Canada on July 17, is far from an ideal preparation.\nU.S based Coach Randy Waldrum will be relying on his 22-player squad to secure Africa’s first podium finish at the Games.\nTo begin the campaign for a podium finish, Nigeria will first face Brazil, two silver medalists on Thursday at the Stade Bordeaux.\nBrazil, who are 10th placed on the FIFA rankings came close to the gold medal but lost twice to USA in Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008, will be keen on ensuring they nip this one this time around.\nMarta, one of Brazil’s most capped players, who will be featuring in her sixth Olympics in France. The 38-year-old was part of the Athens 2004 squad where they finished as runners up.\nThe player who is yet to win a global trophy is one the Falcons should be wary of in spite of her age as she has got lots of experience under her belt, and plenty of magic left in her boots.\nThe young players in the squad will be looking to win this title in her honour.\nAside Brazil, Falcons will face current World Cup champions and top ranked FIFA side, Spain on July 28 at the Stade de la Beaujoire in Nantes.\nThe reigning 2023 Ballon d’Or winner, Spanish Aitana Bonmati is one player to watch and one Falcons defence will look to halt her pace and skill.\nBonmati was instrumental to the team’s 0-1 win against England to win the 2023 World Cup as well as netting in the final as Barcelona beat Lyon 2-0 to the Champions League trophy.\nHinata Miyazawa, the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup Golden boot winner, will carry the dreams of over 125 million Japanese in France.\nMiyazawa scored two goals in the 4-0 thrashing of Spain at the group stage of the previous World Cup; although the Spainards went on to win the tournament.\nAlthough Japan exited at the quarter final stage, Miyazawa scored five goals to be named the Golden boot winner and could cause havoc to Falcons campaign if not restrained.\nWaldrum, will however, miss the likes of defenders Halimat Ayinde and Asleigh Plumptre due to injury but he has got lots of young talents at his disposal and applying the tactics right, Nigeria could go beyond the quarter final stage.
