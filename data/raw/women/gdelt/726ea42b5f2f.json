  "body_text": "The Barcelona-Negreira case has taken an unexpected turn after it emerged a Spanish referee filed an individual criminal complaint against Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira and his son.\nJavier Estrada Fernandez, a Spanish VAR official, broke ranks from the Spanish FA (RFEF) and filed a new complaint last Friday at a Barcelona court over potential corruption and malfeasance.\nAdvertisement\nIt has now come to light that this new complaint from Estrada Fernandez means that La Fiscalia (the Prosecutor’s office) has had to abruptly stop its questioning of witnesses and search for new documents. Spanish law requires an existing investigation to stop as soon as the case goes to court.\nThe Barcelona-Negreira scandal came to light two weeks ago after it was revealed the Catalan club had made payments to a company owned by Enriquez Negreira, who, at the time, was vice president of Spanish football’s refereeing committee.\nNegreira’s son, Javier Enriquez, has also been involved in the case as the administrator of DASNIL 95, the company which received Barcelona’s payments.\nNegreira has denied ever favouring Barcelona in terms of refereeing decisions. Barcelona have admitted hiring an “external consultant” who provided reports “related to professional refereeing”. Negreira’s son says the money he was paid was in exchange for actual reports and delivered all of those to the Prosecutor’s office during their investigation.\nRFEF general secretary, Andreu Camps, confirmed the latest developments in the Barcelona-Negreira case on Thursday. Camps appeared publicly with the president of the referees’ committee, Luis Medina Cantalejo, at the organisation’s Las Rozas headquarters.\n“Every referee has collaborated with our investigation, fulfilling an internal survey we sent them over, except one,” Camps said.\n“One referee didn’t answer our requests, not even after we contacted him for a second time.”\nMore than 200 national referees, from La Liga to the third tier and the women’s league, were present at the event, which was intended to serve as a display of unity among referees in relation to the Negreira case.\nEstrada Fernandez’s complaint has caused some unrest among the Spanish referees’ group. They were expecting a unified and organised action over the whole investigation, and this new complaint has been seen as an individual move without the consent of the rest of the officials.\nAdvertisement\nThe initial plan the referees’ committee had was to enter the investigation once the Prosecutor’s office had completed its search and officially raised charges in court. Now, the Prosector’s office must wrap up its investigation and decide whether to bring charges imminently.\nCamps, not naming anyone, additionally claimed there was another person between the RFEF and the CSD (Consejo Superior del Deporte, a government department) who knew about Negreira and Barcelona’s relationship and said nothing.\nJose Maria Sanchez Martinez, a La Liga referee, meanwhile led a nine-strong group of the league’s officials and thanked the “work and transparency from the RFEF”.\nHe added: “We keep our right to take the appropriate legal action in order to protect the honourability of our group.”\nGO DEEPER\nThe Barcelona-Negreira scandal is only deepening — here's what you need to know\n(Photo: Getty Images)",
