And it’s not going to happen with 11 people in the race.”\nVOICES: From Donald Trump to CM Punk: is 2023 the year toxic men finally get their comeuppance?\n13:45 , Rachel Sharp\nBoris Johnson humiliated?

But to the No Labels point, there’s an opportunity there like never before. It would have to be the right candidate.

We don’t know. That’s one of the concerns that a lot of people have got — me, as well,” he said, when asked about the former president’s chances in 2024.\nHe said the party needs a “uniter” rather than a “divider.”\n“It’s the reason why I think if we bring in a uniter, rather than a divider, I think we’ve got a better shot at doing what’s right for this country long term. And that’s what I want,” he said.\nVoices: What would Trump’s TV arraignment look like?\n04:45 , Oliver O'Connell\nJay Black writes:\nDonald Trump has pleaded “not guilty” to the charges facing him in Fulton County, waiving his right to an arraignment, and, because not every wish in my hope journal can come true, also waiving our right to see him humbled in front of a judge on television.\nOn the surface, that might seem like an odd move. After all, Trump’s other arraignments were fundraising bonanzas for the former president, with each one sending legions of innumerate retirees to his website to hemorrhage money faster than a Trump casino.\nThe list of Donald Trump’s favorite things is well known: golf, sedition, watching TV, sending Eric’s calls to voicemail, putting ketchup on steak, putting ketchup on walls, and, of course, having other people pay his legal bills.\nSo why skip out on the easy money of another arraignment?\nThe answer is that the Fulton County arraignment would have been the first one to be televised.\nWhat would Trump’s TV arraignment look like?\nVivek Ramaswamy says he will pardon Trump if elected\n02:45 , Graig Graziosi\nVivek Ramaswamy, a 2024 GOP presidential hopeful, told ABC’s “This Week” that he would pardon Donald Trump if he was elected to the presidency.\nHe made the comments after saying he would vote for Donald Trump if the former president wins the Republican primary, even if he is convicted in one of his four ongoing legal battles.\n“What I’ve said is clear, if Donald Trump’s the nominee, yes, I will support him,” Mr Ramaswamy said. “And if I’m the president, yes, I will pardon him, because that will help reunite the country, but it’s not the most important thing I’m going to do as the next president.”\nMr Ramaswamy would not be able to pardon Mr Trump in his New York or Georgia cases, should he be convicted, as those are state charges and are not covered under federal pardons.\nTrump was too busy ‘saving millions of lives’ from ‘nuclear holocaust’ to run company, fraud probe told\nMonday 4 September 2023 00:45 , Oliver O'Connell\nDonald Trump claimed to be too busy “saving millions of lives” from a nuclear holocaust as president to be able to also run his company, specifically not to be able to commit business fraud.\nAnother entry into the pantheon of memorable excuses...\nTrump said he was too busy saving millions from ‘nuclear holocaust’ to run company\nVivek Ramaswamy doubles down on voting for Trump if he is convicted\nSunday 3 September 2023 23:00 , Graig Graziosi\nGOP 2024 presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy has doubled down on his decisiont to vote for Donald Trump, even if the former president is convicted in one of his four ongoing legal battles.\nGeorge Stephanopoulos asked Mr Ramaswamy on ABC’s “This Week” why he thought it would be “ok” for a convicted felon to serve as the president.\n“I do not want to see us become a banana republic where the administrative police state uses police force to eliminate opponents from competition,” Mr Ramaswamy said. “That’s not the way it works.”\nHe added that “I will pick who I believe the best next president should be,” before saying he believed he should be the president, but that he would support the Republican nominee.\nDemocratic Senator Tim Kaine says ‘strong argument’ for Trump’s disqualification under 14th Amendment\nSunday 3 September 2023 21:42 , Graig Graziosi\nDemocratic Senator Tim Kaine said he believes there’s a “strong case” for Donald Trump to be disqualified from the 2024 presidential race based on the 14th Amendment.\n“In my view, the attack on the Capitol that day was designed for a particular purpose at a particular moment, and that was to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power of as is laid out in the Constitution,” Mr Kaine said during an interview on ABC “This Week.” “So I think there’s a powerful argument to be made.”\nHe said that the 14th Amendment “is specific” in a section concerning the ineligibility for office of an individual who previously took an oath to defend the Constitution but “engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or [gave] aid or comfort to the enemies thereof,” barring amnesty granted by a two-thirds vote of the Congress.\nHe said that the issue would likely be settled in the courts.\nAll Trump’s criminal charges and lawsuits - and where they stand\nSunday 3 September 2023 16:45 , Oliver O'Connell\nDonald Trump has never been more vulnerable.\nWithout the privileges and prestige of the presidency to protect him, Mr Trump is facing serious lawsuits and criminal indictments across New York, Florida, Georgia and Washington.\nFederal officials, local prosecutors, and individuals are going after him for everything from his private conduct to his political maneuvering during the 2020 election. If even just one of these efforts are successful, the US could see its first-ever former president in prison.\nHere, The Independent explains each major case:\nTracking Trump’s criminal charges and lawsuits - and where they stand\nComing soon to a screen near you...\nSunday 3 September 2023 15:00 , Graig Graziosi\nYes, the American public (and presumably a sizeable international audience) will be able to gather around their phones, tablets, and flat screens and watch the entirety of Donald Trump’s trial for allegedly attempting to subvert the presidential election in Georgia.\nFulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee announced on Thursday that he would allow all hearings and trials in the case to appear on a YouTube stream.
