Here, OK! takes a look at her family life and net worth...\nAs the Champions League football tournament makes its much-anticipated return, Kate Abdo is all set to take centre stage once again.\nThe 43-year-old has been the face of American channel CBS Sports' football coverage and has hosted the UEFA Champions League Today show since 2020, sharing the screen with football legends like Micah Richards, Thierry Henry and Jamie Carragher.\nBorn and raised in Manchester, Abdo is best known for her work across the pond in the USA. She attended Christ the King School and Withington Girls' School before moving to Spain at 17 to learn Spanish and complete her high school diploma.\nShe later returned to Manchester to earn a degree in European languages from the University of Salford, while also studying translation and interpreting at the University of Malaga. Despite being a big name in sports journalism now, Abdo has previously confessed that she struggled to find work opportunities as a young adult - even revealing that she couldn't keep a job at popular high-street bakery, Greggs, reports the Manchester Evening News.\nAbdo spilled the beans about her humble work history with a confession that had Carragher, Richards and Anita Jones in stitches. During a Champions League pitch side chat back in October last year, she revealed: \"Do you know who else used to work for Greggs? One and only... yes I did,\" before quipping: \"I wasn't dripping in Louis Vuitton quite so much back then, but yeah, that was my first job.\"\nClimbing the ranks in sports broadcasting\nAbdo's journey into the competitive arena of journalism began when she snagged an internship at Deutsche Welle in Germany in 2005. Not long after, she took up a spot as a production assistant on Goal! The Bundesliga Magazine until 2007. She then graced Deutsche Welle screens as a newscaster through to 2009, fronting their English and German language sports segments.\nHer career trajectory then saw her linking arms with CNN to present World Sports programme. After wowing audiences there, Sky Sports News in Germany snapped her up where she became a leading anchor and the face of the channel. Her next chapter unfolded back in England with Sky Sports, presenting PPV boxing events, European football and news and even made a guest appearance on Fox Sports during the Womens' World Cup in 2015.\nLiving the American dream, presenter Abdo made the big move across the pond to anchor coverage for the Champions League and Europa League, before becoming the charismatic host of Fox's Premier Boxing Champions. When Fox had to bid adieu to their Champions League rights, Abdo didn't miss a beat and switched over to TNT at Turner's Atlanta base. Fast forward to 2024, and she's become the beloved face of CBS Sports' UEFA Champions League Today show, reportedly accumulating an impressive £2million net worth with her broadcasting gigs.\nTrouble on-air with Jamie Carragher\nAbdo was involved in a memorable on-air clash with Carragher during CBS Sports' broadcast of the Arsenal vs Porto match this March. The scene saw fellow pundit Richards unexpectedly sporting an Arsenal shirt, which Carragher ended up wearing as well.\nBut when he suggested: \"For the last part, you've got to wear it,\" firm Manchester United supporter Abdo staunchly replied: \"No, I'm loyal. I'm loyal.\" Carragher's retort: \"To who?\" only led to Abdo affirming: \"Manchester United, thank you very much.\" The exchange took another shocking turn when Carragher quipped: \"Not to Malik (Scott),\" referencing Abdo's then-fiance, leaving both the studio team and viewers at home astonished.\nAbdo was left in shock when she asked: \"What? Why would you even say that,\" as Carragher nervously laughed. The clip quickly spread across social media, with Scott - a former professional boxer- warning he would \"show up in a physical manner\" if Carragher ever crossed the line again, but it seemed to be forgotten soon after.\nAbdo got her own back on Carra the following night while presenting Champions League coverage alongside the Scouser, Henry and Richards for Atletico Madrid's match against Borussia Dortmund. Starting the show, she said: \"This group, we've been together now for three-and-a-half-years is it? And I grew up with a brother and doing this show I feel like I've gained three more here.\"\nShe labelled Henry as the 'golden child who can do no wrong' before focusing on Carragher. She continued: \"Then there is the middle child, Jamie Carragher. Chip on his shoulder, capable of saying anything for attention. Does he go too far sometimes? Absolutely. Does he apologise? Yes, he does - but all of us have that one annoying family member that we still love and accept.\" Abdo then described Richards as the 'little bro - loud but loveable'.\nA devoted wife\nAbdo demonstrated her loyalty to husband Malik Scott earlier this year, tying the knot in a grand ceremony in Malibu Hills, California. To honour her 43 year old's roots in boxing, she created a beautiful wedding cake which paid tribute to a career which 'saved his life'.\nScott was deeply touched by his wife Kate's thoughtful wedding gesture, as he recounted to Genting Casino: \"Kate did something incredibly creative, caring and compassionate, reflecting the walk of life I come from. She took an old picture of my first ABC Gym in North Philadelphia, where I was raised, the gym that essentially saved my life.\n\"She copied the ring from that gym and turned it into a cake, with me in the ring wearing the boxing trunks I had on when I fought Tony Thompson. Those trunks had a design I borrowed from Sugar Ray Leonard when he fought Tommy Hearns the second time, but I added my own colours - pink and black with stripes. She even put herself next to me in a wedding dress.\n\"The thoughtfulness and creativity moved me to tears because it took me back to my childhood in that ring, where I faced many challenges, learned hard lessons, and grew. That ring always meant the world to me. She made sure to incorporate that into our wedding day, placing us both in the ring on the cake her in a wedding dress, me in my boxing outfit. The contrast was beautiful, thoughtful and loving.\"\nScott began his boxing journey at the tender age of 11, before clinching the Junior Olympic Championships when he was just 17. From 2000 to 2016, Scott built an impressive professional record of 38-3-1, sharing the ring with big names like Derek Chisora and Deontay Wilder. Although he never won a title, he earned the respect of his peers, opponents and boxing fans worldwide for his powerful punches and warrior spirit. He later transitioned into coaching, joining forces with old rival Wilder in 2021 and has since overseen fights against Tyson Fury, Robert Helenius, Joseph Parker and Zhilei Zhang.",
