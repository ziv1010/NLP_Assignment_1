  "body_text": "The Nigeria Football Federation has congratulated Super Falcons’ captain Rasheedat Ajibade on her recent accolade as Player of the Season for Atlético Madrid Femenino, her Spanish top-division club.\nAjibade’s remarkable performance throughout the season was capped off by her decisive goal against Villarreal ladies in the final game, securing Atlético Madrid’s qualification for next season’s UEFA Champions League.\nShe finished the season with 10 goals and eight assists, underscoring her crucial role in the team’s success.\nNFF General Secretary, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi, expressed the federation’s pride in Ajibade’s achievements, highlighting her as a paragon of discipline, dedication, and commitment both for her club and the national team.\n“Rasheedat has always been a role model, exemplifying the qualities expected of a star player. Her discipline, dedication, and patriotism have been evident in her performances for the Super Falcons,” Dr. Sanusi said.\n“We congratulate her on this prestigious award and believe it will inspire her to lead the Super Falcons to glory at the forthcoming Women’s Olympic Football Tournament in France.”\nAjibade played a pivotal role in the Super Falcons’ journey to the Round of 16 at last year’s FIFA World Cup in Australia, where they remained unbeaten in regulation time before being eliminated by England in a penalty shootout.\nFollowing the World Cup, Ajibade assumed the captaincy of the Super Falcons and has since led the team to qualify for the Women’s Olympic Football Tournament for the first time in 16 years.",
