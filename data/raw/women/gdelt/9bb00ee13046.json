Not only is the newly-minted HGTV star taking the channel by storm with her new show, Home in a Heartbeat, but she's also found love with boyfriend Dale Moss. But, if you keep your finger on the pulse of pop culture, his name might sound familiar. Chances are, you might even recognize Moss from your own small screen. Don't worry, we're breaking down everything you need to know about this HGTV beau—and his and Alix's adorable love story.\nWho is Dale Moss?\nFormer football wide receiver, current global ambassador to the Special Olympics—Alix's boyfriend wears a lot of different hats. However, Bachelor Nation will remember Moss for his historic (and slightly) controversial appearance on the Bachelorette.\nIn 2020, Moss competed for Clare Crawley's heart during the show's 16th season—and it was love at first sight. Literally. Crawley was so enamored with Moss that she famously renounced her Bachelorette title a few episodes into the season—and was replaced with Tayshia Adams midway through the show's love journey. Right before the twosome took their whirlwind romance off-screen, Moss got down on one knee for a romantic, on-camera proposal. Unfortunately—after an on-again, off-again relationship—Moss and Crawley ultimately called it quits in 2021.\nSince then, Moss has made quite the name for himself by brokering plenty of influencer deals and even making his acting debut in a movie called Putting Love to the Test.\nHow Did Galey Alix and Dale Moss Meet?\nThink of Moss and Alix's relationship as a modern-day love story. While the HGTV star didn't recognize him from the Bachelorette, she became smitten with him as she listened to a 2018 episode of the podcast Girls Gotta Eat, which featured her future beau.\nAs the Home in a Heartbeat star told People: \"I was walking the dogs, listening to the podcast … and I just remember thinking, 'This person is so well-spoken. He is witty. He is vulnerable and shows things about his life, but without spilling all the jelly beans. He's smart.' And I also really liked the sound of his voice.\"\nA few scrolls on his Instagram feed later, Alix decided to shoot her shot by sending him a direct message. (Or, as she told People, \"I DIY'ed it.\") Alix and Moss have been together for over a year—and Home in a Heartbeat fans could not be more supportive of their relationship.\n\"I'm so happy for you,\" one follower commented on Alix's birthday post for her boyfriend. \"I've been following your journey for a long time and to see you thriving makes my heart so happy.\" Another wrote, \"I am so happy for those feelings that can put you constantly on cloud [nine]. There is no better feeling in someone's lifetime.\"\nWill Dale Moss Appear on Home in a Heartbeat?\nFrom the rare glimpses we get of their relationship, Alix and Moss seem happy and head-over-heels into each other. Of course, we can't help but wonder when the couple will take the next big step: Featuring Moss on Home in a Heartbeat, of course! While the former Bachelorette contestant has yet to make his HGTV debut, Alix shares that he's a huge help with her speedy renovation projects.\n\"He has come to [nearly] every single install, and he's on top of roofs, sweating,” she revealed to People. \"He's painting and he's wallpapering in back rooms. He's doing everything he can to help me with my dreams in the most selfless way.\"\nTranslation? It seems like a cameo is inevitable—and we'll be keeping our eyes peeled so we can share all the details!",
