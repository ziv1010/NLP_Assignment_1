Shocking footage showed cars caught in the crossfire, as terrified drivers were told to lock themselves in their vehicles.\nThe violence came just hours after two people lost their life during intense nationwide violence following PSG being crowned European football champions for the first time in Munich, Germany, on Saturday night.\nOne of the worst incidents took place in Dax, in the south-west of France, where a 17-year-old was knifed in the stomach.\n\"He was part of a crowd celebrating the PSG win in designated fanzone, and died from his wounds in hospital’ said a local police spokesman, without naming the deceased. An investigation is underway, and CCTV is being used to try and find those responsible.’\nAnother man was also killed when his scooter smashed into a car in Paris on Saturday, after the victim was seen celebrating the football win.\nMeanwhile, in Normandy, a police officer was seriously injured after a firework was deliberately launched at his face in Coutances. He remains in intensive care, placed in a coma with devastating head and eye injuries.\nThe person who launched the firework attack - which has been reported as deliberate - has not yet been identified, according to an investigating source. In Grenoble, in eastern France, a car attempting ‘a handbrake turn on a tram line’ ploughed into a young family of four, severely wounding them.\nThree - including two women - were left fighting for their lives and the driver is now in custody.\nA total of 294 people were arrested for football-related violence and looting in Paris as France’s Interior Minister, Bruno Retailleau, described trouble makers as ‘barbarians’.\nReacting to the disorder on X, Mr Retailleau said: \"True PSG fans are getting excited about their team's magnificent performance.\n\"Meanwhile, barbarians have taken to the streets of Paris to commit crimes and provoke law enforcement. I have asked the internal security forces to react vigorously to these abuses.\n\"I offer my support to the Police Prefect and all the police officers who are ensuring everyone's safety this evening. It is unacceptable that it is not possible to party without fearing the savagery of a minority of thugs who respect nothing.\"\nThe Champs-Élysées was locked down in a ring of steel, with stores boarding up windows and barricading entrances. However, that didn’t deter looters from ransacking shops, including a Foot Locker and a Maisons du Monde furniture store, said a police spokesman.\nMasks thugs in hoodies were seen prowling the streets, while discared mattresses were set alight, sending thick black smoke billowing through the night sky.\nThere was even fighting reported around the Eiffel Tower, which was lit up in PSG’s red, white and blue following their 5-0 win.\nAround 5,400 police officers were on duty across Paris at the weekend, as trouble was always expected, whatever the result.\nPSG fans have built a notorious reputation for violence in recent years, with incidents against Arsenal and Aston Villa supporters during this year’s Champion’s League campaign.\nThere was also trouble reported in Munich, where rival French and Italian fans fought each other.\nNasser Al-Khelaïfi, the PSG club president, appealed for calm on Sunday, as PSG took part in a victory parade in central Paris.",
