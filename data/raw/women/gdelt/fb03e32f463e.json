We will look at it with all stakeholders and see what we can do.\"\nSpeaking about the women's game in his closing remarks, Infantino also said the total prize money for the 2023 Women's World Cup will be $150m (£124.3m) compared to $15m (£12.4m) in 2015.\nLast year's men's World Cup in Qatar had a total prize fund of $440m (£364.7m).\n\"Our mission will be able to have equality in payments for 2026 men's and 2027 women's World Cups,\" Infantino said.\nThe 52-year-old succeeded Sepp Blatter as Fifa president in 2016, retaining the role in 2019 and has been re-elected unopposed for another four-year term.\nDuring Infantino's time in charge, Fifa has looked into staging the World Cup every two years in a concept that has faced criticism from federations, leagues and players.\nThere was also controversy at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar when the build up to the tournament was dominated by the country's treatment of migrant workers, along with its stance on same-sex relationships and its human rights record.\nA number of European nations planned to wear a OneLove armband during matches to promote diversity and inclusion but did not do so because of possible sanctions from Fifa.\n\"It is an incredible honour and privilege, and a great responsibility,\" said Infantino following his re-election.\n\"I promise to continue serving Fifa and football around the world.\n\"To those that love me, and I know there are many, and those who hate me ... I love you all.\"\nTime to 'walk the walk' on human rights\nThe congress also included a video address by Michael Llamas, chairperson of the Fifa sub-committee on human rights and social responsibility, who said Fifa was committed to assessing the human rights legacy of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\nHuman rights organisations claimed thousands of migrant workers had died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup but Qatari authorities denied this, and stressed the country was making labour reforms.\nLise Klaveness, the head of the Norwegian Football Association, who led the calls for Fifa to address the issue, welcomed the pledge as a first step in the process.\n\"The most important thing with Mr Llamas' statement today was that he did not put human rights up against football, he did not say 'we are not the Red Cross',\" Klaveness told BBC Sport.\n\"He established human rights as something fundamental that should be embedded in everything we do. Of course then you have to walk the walk but it was very important that he talked the talk today.\"\nHuman rights organisation Amnesty International welcomed Fifa's pledge but said workers had \"already waited far too long for justice\".\n\"Any review must focus on exactly how Fifa will ensure that workers and their families are compensated for the abuses they suffered — including illegal recruitment fees that have been paid, wages that were stolen and lives that have been lost — rather than whether they intend to do so at all,\" said Amnesty International's head of economic and social justice Steve Cockburn.\nRelease or detain?
