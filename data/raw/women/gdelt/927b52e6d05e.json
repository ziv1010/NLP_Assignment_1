  "body_text": "UEFA confirm four nations bidding for 2027 Women's Champions League final\n- Four countries are interested in hosting the 2027 UWCL final\n- The 2024/25 final will be held at the Estadio Jose Alvalade in Lisbon, Portugal\n- Barcelona are the current holders of the trophy\nEuropean football governing body UEFA has confirmed declarations of interest from four nations to host the 2027 Women's Champions League final.\nBarcelona are the current holders of the competition following their triumph in Bilbao earlier this year. French side Lyon, on the other hand, are the most successful club in the competition with eight titles to their name.\nThis season, the final will be held at the Estadio Jose Alvalade in Lisbon, Portugal on May 25, 2025. All three English clubs, Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City, are competing in the group stage of the competition.\nIn May last year, UEFA opened the bidding process for the 2026 final. 12 months later, it was announced that the Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo, Norway, will stage the 2026 showpiece event.\nProposed venues must be ranked as a category four UEFA stadium, and include natural grass. A gross capacity of 30,000 to 60,000 is preferred, so 90min has taken a look at the four nations to express interest in staging the 2027 final, with the hosts set to be appointed in May next year.\nPGE National Stadium\n- Country: Poland\n- City: Warsaw\n- Capacity: 56,826\nPoland has never hosted a women’s European final, but the country has staged the Europa League finals in 2015 and 2021, as well as the UEFA Super Cup in 2024. It has never hosted the men’s Champions League final, but was one of the stadiums used during UEFA Euro 2012, which was co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine.\nThe PGE National Stadium is situated in the capital city of Warsaw, and has a UEFA seating capacity of over 56,000. The stadium opened in 2012 and is a multipurpose venue that hosts sporting events, concerts, cultural events and conferences.\nCamp Nou\n- Country: Spain\n- City: Barcelona\n- Capacity: 99,354\nThe Camp Nou in Barcelona is the biggest stadium in Europe, and the capacity is set to increase to 105,000 once renovations are complete. Work has been underway at the home of Barcelona since June 2023, and the stadium is currently only partially open.\nReports suggest work will be complete in the summer of 2026, which could make it the ideal stage for the 2027 UWCL final. Barcelona are three-time winners of the competition, and have won the last two titles.\nSpain has hosted numerous UWCL finals, including the 2023/24 showpiece in Bilbao. However, the Camp Nou has never been the stadium used, and it last hosted the men’s Champions League final in 1999.\nSt Jakob Park\n- Country: Switzerland\n- City: Basel\n- Capacity: 38,512\nSt Jakob Park in Basel, Switzerland, is one of the eight venues set to stage the UEFA Women’s Euros in 2025. It has a football capacity of a little over 38,000, and is the home of FC Basel.\nIt is the largest football venue in Switzerland and it also staged the Euros in 2008, as well as the men’s Europa League final in 2016. Switzerland has never hosted the UWCL final.\nPrincipality Stadium\n- Country: Wales\n- City: Cardiff\n- Capacity: 74,500\nCardiff last hosted the UWCL final in 2017 when Lyon beat rivals Paris Saint-Germain on penalties to clinch the trophy. However, on that occasion, the match was staged at the Cardiff City Stadium, which has a capacity of a little over 33,000.\nThe Principality is no stranger to big European games, however, as it hosted the men’s Champions League final that same year when Real Madrid beat Juventus 4-1.",
