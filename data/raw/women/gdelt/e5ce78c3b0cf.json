  "body_text": "Mary Earps has announced her retirement from international football just 39 days before the start of England’s European Women’s Championship campaign.\nThe 32-year-old, who currently plays for Paris Saint-Germain, has been capped 53 times by the national side and was a key part of the Lionesses’ success at Euro 2022.\nEarps has also won the Women’s Finalissima, the SheBelieves Cup and the Arnold Clark Cup twice during her time with England, while she was also in goal for the Lionesses defeat to Spain in the World Cup final in 2023.\nHowever, ahead of the Women’s Euros this summer, Earps looked set to be the second-choice goalkeeper for the tournament with England manager Sarina Wiegman preferring Chelsea’s Hannah Hampton.\nEarps has now opted to step away from the Lionesses, who begin their Women’s Euros campaign against France on July 5, before playing the Netherlands and Wales in Group D.\n‘I have taken the difficult decision to retire internationally,’ Earps said in a statement.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?

I left it all out there on the pitch and did my best to help systemic change of it.
