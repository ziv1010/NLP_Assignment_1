  "body_text": "“I’m not Jorge Vilda, I’m Montse Tome.”\nThe Spain women’s team manager has repeated this message several times since she was given the job in September.\nHowever, some things seem not to have changed with her in charge. Vilda’s tenure was characterised by poor communication with the players — especially during the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. This problem has been evident again in Spain’s most recent time together.\nAdvertisement\nTuesday evening saw Spain end the UEFA Women’s Nations League group stage the same way as they started: a victory over Sweden but tension within the camp. The 3-2 win in Gothenburg in September was their first match since lifting the World Cup and everything that followed. Last night’s 5-3 meeting took place against a less dramatic backdrop — but one that has still caused concern.\nOn Friday, Spain’s 3-2 home defeat by Italy featured a surreal situation with mistakes from the coaching staff at its centre. After half-time, Spain came out with only 10 players — and it was very nearly nine — because of a mix-up over substitutions.\nLucia Garcia only just made it onto the pitch in time for the restart — with her boots half on and laces untied. She had found out she was coming on at the end of a warm-up session that took place during the break, with virtually no time to prepare.\nEsther Gonzalez — who had not warmed up at all — then had to hurry to come on, too. By the time she did, in the 48th minute, Italy had taken advantage and equalised for 1-1.\n“I didn’t understand anything,” Gonzalez said in a Spanish TV interview after the match. “I was sat on the bench and suddenly, with the game already started, they look at me — Montse and (assistant coach) Irene del Rio — and tell me: ‘You have to go on without warming up.'”\nAfter the match, Tome said that Garcia’s substitution for Athenea del Castillo had been agreed upon at half-time, but that Aitana Bonmati “had given us short notice that she could not continue”.\nDel Castillo herself appeared to contradict this version of events when she said after the game: “It must have been a miscalculation. At the start of the team talk, we already knew we were on the bench.”\nDuring half-time, there was a moment of tension between Bonmati and Tome, and Bonmati asked not to return to the pitch, according to dressing-room sources who wished to speak anonymously to protect their position. They said the coach did not seem to understand, and this led to the situation of Spain starting the second half with only 10 players.\nBonmati commented on social media after the game.\nAdvertisement\n“During half-time, I didn’t feel well and I asked the coaching staff to replace me because I understood that the best thing for the team was for another team-mate to come on,” she wrote.\n“From here on, the situation was over and the important thing is that the team qualified for the final four.”\nGonzalez, meanwhile, said: “The information I have now is that really the information of the change came late.\n📹 𝗥𝗘𝗦𝗨𝗠𝗘𝗡 I Vuelve a disfrutar con la remontada de la @SEFutbolFem ante Suecia (5-3)\n🇪🇸 5-3 🇸🇪#JugarLucharYGanar | #UWNL pic.twitter.com/E7qP1GPjde\n— Selección Española Femenina de Fútbol (@SEFutbolFem) December 5, 2023\n“The information has to come earlier, first of all for the team. You can’t leave the team with 10; it’s a big mistake. And secondly, the staff must be able to act much earlier. You can’t let them start the second half with 10 players.”\nThis, along with other blunders made by staff in recent matches, has created a feeling in the dressing room that the coaching team is having to improvise.\nAgainst Switzerland on October 31, four players — Irene Paredes, Ivana Andres, Gonzalez and Mariona Caldentey — were not able to feature because of a human administration error when uploading their details to UEFA’s platform.\nInitially, it was said to be due to a computer problem, but the reality is that the platform did not cause problems in any of the other matches played that day. It was a mistake made by staff.\n“These are things that end up bothering you, and you don’t understand them,” said Gonzalez.\n“We have been sent a set of guidelines and we hope it won’t happen again,” Tome said at a press conference on November 21.\nThat same day, Tome named her squad for the two recent matches against Italy and Sweden. The call-up of Alexia Putellas was controversial, as she was injured.\nAdvertisement\nThe Barcelona forward had missed the Clasico meeting with Real Madrid two days previously and wasn’t fit to play against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Women’s Champions League the next day. Putellas withdrew from the Spain squad on November 27.\nIt was another sign that communication between the coaching staff and players was not the best — and it is worth remembering that Tome’s first press conference as coach was already controversial. The vast majority of the players she called up had only days before repeated that they would not represent Spain until changes at the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) were made, following Luis Rubiales’ kiss on Jenni Hermoso.\nGO DEEPER\nThese shocking stories explain why Spain's women's team want systemic change\nTome ignored this and called them up anyway. She said she had spoken to them, but the players publicly denied this was the case. They ended up returning — at least initially — because they were worried about potential sanctions for not doing so.\nWhat followed should undoubtedly be considered good progress: the meetings with government officials until the early hours of the morning, the establishment of a joint committee where players will have a greater voice, and the removal of some senior RFEF figures. The waters are calmer now. The team also now has a new sporting director, Markel Zubizarreta, who has the full confidence of the players, especially those with whom he worked at Barca.\nBut Tome’s future in her position remains uncertain. Elections for the new RFEF presidency will likely be held in early 2024 and it is expected that there will be changes. All these misunderstandings only give a bad image to the national team. It is something that does not please a team that three and a half months ago were proclaimed world champions.\n(Top photo: Joaquin Corchero/Europa Press via Getty Images)",
