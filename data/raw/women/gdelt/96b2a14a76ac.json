Celebrating the triumph on the presidential balcony while holding his genitals next to the queen is unacceptable and disgusting.\"\nThat criticism was a reference to another incident on Sunday evening, broadcast around the world, which appeared to show Rubiales grab his genitals with both hands to celebrate Spain's victory.\nLess than two metres away from his seat were Spanish Queen Letizia and her daughter, Infanta Sofia, who were also watching the match.\n\"It's an incident which has entered the history of world sport and, more seriously still, will forever be linked to our national women's team,\" said La Liga F who described it as a moment of \"unprecedented international disgrace for the 'Spain brand', for Spanish sport and for women's football in the world\".\nGovernment demands 'urgent' investigation\nEarlier on Wednesday, the Spanish government demanded transparency and urgent action from the football federation.\nThe RFEF on Tuesday called an emergency meeting for Friday and activated an internal investigation into the incident.\nVictor Francos, Spain's secretary of sport and president of the country's sports council (CSD), said the council would take action if the RFEF did not -- they can raise the case to Spain's Administrative Court for Sports.\n\"I imagine that what the responsible people will do is talk to the two parties involved and issue a report,\" Francos told radio station Cadena Ser.\n\"I have personally told the federation this report has to be transparent and urgent, because, if it is not, obviously we are obliged to take the corresponding additional measures.\"\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Tuesday that Rubiales' apology for the kiss was insufficent.\n\"The government has said what it has said -- it is an unacceptable act, more steps (are happening) and we will use our instruments to prove transparency in the process and the corresponding resolution, if the time comes,\" added Francos.\nAmerican forward Megan Rapinoe, the world's highest-profile women's player, was similarly scathing in an interview with The Atlantic on Tuesday.\n\"What kind of upside-down world are we in? On the biggest stage, where you should be celebrating, Jenni has to be physically assaulted by this guy,\" said Rapinoe.\nShe referred to Rubiales' behaviour at the final as portraying \"a deep level of misogyny and sexism\".\n© 2023 AFP",
