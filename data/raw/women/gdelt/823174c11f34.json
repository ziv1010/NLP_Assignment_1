demonstrated that they are naturally doing it on-farm,” says judge Steve Canton.\n“An example of this is the multiple PPE points they have stationed around the farm, to ensure it’s available and able to be used when required.”\nThe judges noted Jonathon and Stacey also had an excellent emergency response plan which included a response to adverse weather events.\nThe Hoets are 20% equity partners
