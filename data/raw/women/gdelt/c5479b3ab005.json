  "body_text": "TROY, N.Y. — Dr. Matthew Shaftel has a lot to be excited about as he enters his second year as Russell Sage College (Sage) President.\nFor starters, enrollment is up — again.\n“We are at our largest enrollment in a decade,” Shaftel said. “As of (last week), we passed 2,830 students, about 1,500 of which are graduate students. It’s a student population that’s very different than 20 years ago. We’re leaning into that.”\nShaftel’s primary focus is on doing everything in the college’s power to put the students first. Staff training and development this year included studying five different student archetypes that represent the most common types of students that come to Sage, whether they are starting fresh out of high school, transferring from another school, staying on after their bachelor’s degree, or returning to school at an older age.\nStudents will soon be able to use a transfer portal that will utilize an AI-assisted evaluation of their transcripts and prior learning that can count towards credits. The program is designed with ease and accessibility in mind, to be a “game changer” for adult students who want to change their circumstances.\nAll of this is part of the school’s “Sage Forward Strategic Plan” that was developed and will be officially approved in October.\n“It’s part of how do we really lean into a higher educational world where we add value no matter where you are in your life,” Shaftel said. “And it’s about removing barriers.”\nA “Forever Russell Sage” initiative is also in the works to support alumni who want to return to Sage to further their education.\nShaftel has high praise for his staff, who continue to work hard putting students first and continuing to make Russell Sage College a top private college for social mobility – top 25% in the nation and number one in the Northeast for six years in a row.\n“Those numbers show we’re better at this than most people, so why not lean into what you know is your strength – how do you really maximize the potential of each individual student and how do you really support them?” Shaftel commented. “I couldn’t be more grateful — the faculty here are truly exceptional, which is why I brag about them all the time. Time and time again, the way they engage students in hands-on experiential learning day in and day out, I think that speaks volumes to who we are and what our values are.”\nThe biggest project that Sage will be working on throughout the year is the strategic merger with Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences.\n“It’s massive,” Shaftel said. “Between working on that and implementing the Strategic Plan — and those two things are integrated — that really pushes us forward for the year. We’ve got 12 or 13 Integration Teams working across the two campuses making decisions – there’s literally hundreds and hundreds of decisions that have to be made. Assuming we get the approval from NYSED, the eventual Russell Sage University will be part RSC and part ACPHS, but also totally something that’s bigger and better than its parts. To really invent that together is such an exciting opportunity.”\nThe decision to become Russell Sage University is something that Shaftel says is the right thing to do at this time.\n“We qualified by state standards for university status several years ago because we have doctoral programs and undergraduate programs, the breadth of our portfolio, the number of students, and so forth,” Shaftel explained. “But we didn’t pursue it at the time because we had just gone through a branding exercise in 2020 when we officially became co-ed and both undergraduate and graduate across two campuses. We weren’t quite ready to start that over again.\n“But in this moment, it makes perfect sense to celebrate this coming together, to be about 4,000 students and the fourth-largest private school in the entire region, I think, within a 90-mile radius. That is the opportunity to think through how do we take the pieces we know exist and rebrand around the comprehensive university that we will become — and we really have been for a long time.”\nWhen the merger is completed — pending NYSED approval — students at what will become Russell Sage University — pending NYSED approval — will have access to even greater opportunities than before at either school.\n“As we talk about how we’re going to serve the students, you think about a student who’s doing a six-year pharmacy doctoral program, who now can be involved in musical theater or Division 3 baseball,” Shaftel remarked. “I think we’re really doing what comprehensive institutions do best, which is allow the students to have a highly unique pathway to their success by being involved in many different things.”\nOne of those different things will be a collegiate women’s flag football team, which will be ready to start competing intramurally next year and so far is the first of its kind in the region.\n“There’s so much energy around it,” Shaftel said. “We recruited a new coach over the summer, and we have five transfer students already, even though we don’t have a full conference schedule yet. It’s going to be really exciting. I think being the first collegiate program in the region is going to be so important. To me, it really links to our identity around empowerment and social mobility, because we’re taking a sport that has so traditionally been a sport for men, and integrating it here as a sport for women, and I love that.”\nThe new flag football team is part of Sage’s ongoing efforts with its Strategic Plan to make every student feel like they belong. About half the student body participates in sports, with the flag football team as one more option for students to get involved. At the same time, Shaftel is exploring what other affinity groups should be available so that everyone has a place where they fit in. Sage already has a wide variety of clubs and groups that cater to an equally wide variety of student interests, with more in development.\n“We’ve been tracking this, and there’s only about 15% of our students that don’t have a natural affinity group when they come in, and so we’re trying to develop affinity groups for those 15% so that every student has that place where they have an adult they can connect with, they have peers they can connect with, and they feel like they belong to something. It’s so critical,” Shaftel explained.\nExtracurricular activities and clubs won’t be the only place where students can feel like they belong. Sage has a number of new programs that have been approved and are ready to begin, such as its bachelor’s in Speech Language Pathology, the reopened RN-BSN program, and the accelerated nursing degree — which is so popular it has a waitlist. Sage’s Flex MBA program is also generating a lot of traction. Adapted last year, the program gives students the option to go through the coursework however they choose – by attending classes in person, attending classes online in a synchronous environment, or by watching the class recordings and completing the work asynchronously. And those options can change every week, depending on the students’ individual needs.\nAnd that’s not the only new thing on campus. Sage underwent an enormous amount of renovation over the summer and is still working on some projects as the school year begins. The end goal of all the construction work is to create spaces that best cater to students’ needs.\n“We have done a full-scale overhaul of the first floor of our education building,” Shaftel said. “We’re not quite done, but we’re very close. We’re building a classroom of the future that is designed not only with all of the contemporary technologies, but also that has spaces for students to be able to recover and connect and do their resiliency work. We can really model positive education in this space. The renovation to Sage Hall is a wonderful call to our history. It’s the first building that the Sages built on our campus. It was a centerpiece of the women’s right to vote movement, it was centered around the suffragette movement, and in this moment, of all moments, as we’re thinking about how do we live in (a) democracy, to renovate that building and have it be again the crown jewel of our campus is so exciting.\n“Our sophomore residence hall was renovated, too, over the summer, and it looks great,” Shaftel continued. “The students are thrilled. We did new furniture, new carpets, new paint, we added sinks and fans, so students have a lot more ability to be independent in those spaces. We renovated three other classrooms, and in the Schacht Theater, we’re starting to lay groundwork for an overhaul of that space. It’s historic, it’s important, but it could use some love.”\nTwo new partnerships are also in the works. One is between all of the region’s higher education institutions and the Capital Region Chamber of Commerce, called the College Attainment Campaign, which will help Capital Region residents to better understand the value of a higher education and how to access whatever path will suit them best. The other is between Sage and Girls, Inc., which now includes a scholarship program for Eureka Program graduates.\nShaftel says it’s all part of leaning into all parts of the college’s portfolio and becoming a comprehensive university with ways to meet the needs of every single student. He is eternally grateful to the college’s generous donors who have made so much of it possible. Last year was Sage’s largest fundraising year in history, which makes Shaftel confident that the school is “on track to do an incredible job.”\nOn a personal level, Shaftel is looking forward to being able to refine the work he does, now that everything isn’t quite so brand new to him.\n“Having a year under the belt to think about who we are, where we’re going, and where we still have (the) opportunity to do things better, that gives us a lot to work with this year that we really didn’t have last year,” he said. “This community has been supportive in a way that I just couldn’t be more grateful for.”",
