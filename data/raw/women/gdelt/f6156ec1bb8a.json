It’s a funny paradox; it takes so much preparation to be so unseen — to basically be the equivalent of the psychological “Invisible Gorilla Experiment,” where test subjects were focused so hard on people passing a ball around that they completely failed to notice someone in a gorilla costume walking through their midst. Audiences often overlook the work it takes to prepare just one referee for an international soccer game, let alone an entire World Cup’s worth of referees.\nAdvertisement\nAs FIFA’s head of refereeing, Kari Seitz is responsible for helping select and prepare 33 referees, 55 assistant referees and 19 video match officials for the 2023 World Cup in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand. It’s the culmination of a three-and-a-half-year selection process that winnowed down approximately 300 candidates to 107.\nSeitz described the process to The Athletic in a call, saying that she first worked with the confederations to identify their initial talent pool and then further refined the group. Candidates attended yearly seminars, were invited to referee feature competitions like the U-20 and U-17 World Cups, and were monitored for performance while reffing their domestic leagues. FIFA also appointed fitness coaches who tracked candidates’ progress and gave them programs to follow in cooperation with their countries. Like the auditioning process for a national team, approximately six months before the World Cup, FIFA sent out its official invitations. Finally, soccer’s governing body put on a final preparation seminar before everyone was sent back home for five months to be tracked closely by technical and fitness coaches.\nAccording to Seitz and FIFA, this World Cup has an added layer of difficulty thanks to the long travel for most referees to reach the tournament and the multiple hops between countries within the tournament, where there will be large timezone changes based on game assignment. Even the relatively short three-hour trip by plane from Sydney to Auckland induces a two-hour time change.\nFIFA was able to get a lot of its World Cup crew on-the-ground experience when they took part in the 10-team intercontinental playoff tournament in Aotearoa New Zealand in February, which determined the last three berths for the World Cup. But there’s no getting around that with increased travel time, it’s not just athletes, but also referees who need increased recovery times. Seitz said normally referees train in the morning with the FIFA referee trainers and then travel to their venue. This time, they’ll arrive earlier so they can rest before on-site training sessions.\nAdvertisement\nOn top of that, just as the physical standards for players are evolving and growing constantly, referees have to be able to keep up.\n“I think the players, coaches, spectators would be shocked by the amount of work these referees do to prepare physically,” Seitz said. “The change over the last I would say seven, eight years and the physical capacity of our referees has been incredible.”\nSeitz said that most of the female referees she’s been working with can pass the men’s international referee standard in physical testing, which includes timed sprints (6 seconds to run 40 meters for men, 6.4 seconds for women) and interval running (4 km divided into 40 running/walking intervals, completed in 22 minutes for men, 24.6 minutes for women). They also do dynamic yo-yo testing, where cones are placed around the field in areas where referees generally need to run to be able to see the play and test overall for things like agility, endurance, and strength.\n“It’s really designated for the requirements of the match. We’re preparing them not to pass a fitness test, we’re preparing them to referee,” Seitz said. Overall, she says the data shows a center referee’s physical load in a match is comparable to what midfielders endure, with recent figures landing around running seven to eight miles per game.\nIt’s not just flat-out running, though. It’s running combined with having to make accurate calls in the moment, which can get exacerbated by high-transition games.\n“When do most of the red cards happen? The end of the first half, the end of the second half and that’s when people are tired,” Seitz said. “And when you are tired, the blood goes to your legs, not to your brain, and referees have to make decisions the whole 90 minutes, the whole 120 minutes. We really have to train beyond the limits of the game in order to have a match official prepared and not lose the ability (for) further decision-making.”\nAdvertisement\nSome referees also get their own personal mental performance coaches. FIFA doesn’t offer those at this time alongside the physical and tactical preparations, but referees are still being asked to execute at the highest possible level in front of an audience alongside the players. And this year they will also have to increase communication with in-stadium announcements following video-assisted review decisions, according to FIFA.\nGO DEEPER\nFIFA referees to announce VAR decisions at Women's World Cup\n“You can imagine,” Seitz said of the mental load, “it’s unlike a player, where in this case, most of the people don’t like you most of the time.”\nReferees have to be tactically adept too; knowing each player and each team’s tendencies helps refs anticipate where the game will go and when they might need to be extra watchful. FIFA provides match analysts to help coach referees and prepare dossiers on each team that examine how these teams play — something they did for the 2019 World Cup and which they will continue in 2023.\n“When they lose the ball, do they quickly respond to try to win it back, do they give space?” Seitz said of their match analysis. “ When they attack, is it generally a long ball when they hit it, then they have fast transitions? Are they moving the ball right, left? Normally are the corner kicks generally to this area of the field?”\nMany refs are former players, which helps in the tactical analysis, from looking individually at players and zooming all the way out to if their country has an overarching style or ethos.\n“This idea of understanding football, not just responding with the whistle, but really reading the game and anticipating,” Seitz said, “We’re going to see the fouls better. We’re going to be able to maintain control.”\nFIFA’s referee management extends all the way to account for the fact that refs may have to take one approach to calls in their domestic leagues that differs from the FIFA approach. Some leagues may have goal-line or offside technology while others do not. Some leagues may have better referee education than others. Or, referee organizations may simply have different standards in applying the same laws of the game, like what constitutes “clear and obvious errors” in triggering VAR. The best referees, Seitz said, are adaptable and open to these differences.\nAdvertisement\n“We will have referees from 54 different countries and across all six confederations, and the reality is those countries are very different,” she added. “Whether you’re a man or a woman, they’re very different. How they invest in football, how they invest in referees. Also to take into account being a female in different parts of the world is a very different context. For the first time ever, for example, we will have a referee from Palestine. We will have referees from North Africa, places where women haven’t been in these kinds of leadership roles on the field. It takes time to change culture.”\nWith so many different factors at play, it’s almost a wonder that there’s ever a game where the refereeing is smooth and unnoticeable. But that kind of frictionless play will get better the more FIFA and its federations invest in training and in providing platforms for referees to implement that training. Seitz was encouraged by seeing female referees in Qatar, like Stephanie Frappart becoming the first woman to take charge of a men’s World Cup match with Costa Rica vs. Germany. Bringing women into these competitions gives them more pathways to success and increased visibility encourages more nations to invest in their female referees, which in turn raises the level of the game everywhere.\n“We believe 100% that this will be the best World Cup ever,” Seitz said.\n(Photo: Hannah Peters, FIFA via Getty Images)",
