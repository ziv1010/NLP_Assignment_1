  "body_text": "Baffling? Distracting? The fallout from Earps' book\n- Published\nComments made in Mary Earps' autobiography about former England team-mate Hannah Hampton and manager Sarina Wiegman have dominated headlines.\nIt is rare for a current player to release a book detailing conversations and events with people who remain in the game.\nGoalkeepers Earps and Hampton have both hit the heights of the game, earning top individual accolades, as well as winning European titles with England and Wiegman.\nSo it is understandable Earps' words have caused controversy.\nWhat has the reaction been and how could it impact the Lionesses going forward?\nI've not written book to tear anyone down - Earps\n- Published3 November 2025\nBompastor backs 'class' Hampton after Earps comments\n- Published1 November 2025\n'It's not nice to see it obviously'\nIn her book, of which extracts were released in the Guardian, Earps claimed she told Wiegman she was rewarding \"bad behaviour\" by recalling Hampton to the England squad, having previously been dropped for being \"disruptive and unreliable\".\nIn response, Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor backed her goalkeeper Hampton, saying she had shown \"class\" and that she felt Earps had disrespected Wiegman.\nFollowing the negative reaction, Earps told BBC Sport in an exclusive interview that she had not written the book to \"tear anyone down\".\nManchester City goalkeeper Khiara Keating, who made her England debut against Brazil last month, says she has \"a lot of time\" for both Earps and Hampton, and hopes they can resolve issues that have arisen from the book.\n\"At the end of the day, we're all here to do the same job. Feelings aside, we were always a close-knit group. As goalkeepers, we normally stick together,\" she told BBC Sport.\n\"That's what we'll do going forward. I'm sure they will sort out what they need to sort out - but I love them both. People have different opinions.\n\"Their issues are their issues. They know what happened so that's not for me to share anyone's business. It's not nice to see it obviously.\n\"We've done so many good things with England winning back-to-back Euros. The media will be what it is - it comes with the job. I just hope it will all brush over and we can focus on what matters again.\"\n'I would never go into what happened'\nThe stir the book has caused is widespread.\nFormer England striker Ellen White was in the Euro 2022 squad alongside Earps and played with Hampton at club and country in her career.\nShe said she felt \"uneasy\" and \"nervous\", as well as \"a lot of sadness\" discussing the outcry on the Women's Football Weekly podcast.\n\"I feel like we almost have this unwritten oath when you're in a team, that the togetherness and what happens in the dressing room, in training, and in your bubble, stays within the team and that environment,\" said White.\n\"I was there in 2022 and I would protect my team with my life. I would never go into what happened within that environment. That's not for me to speak about.\n\"Mary has gone into what she wanted to. What I would say is when Sarina [Wiegman] came in, we built a culture, philosophy, togetherness, and that family-like feel so it felt unbreakable and beautiful at the same time.\n\"It just feels like that has been penetrated a little bit and that is quite hard to take.\"\nEx-Scotland and Arsenal defender Jen Beattie added that there were \"really difficult times\" in team environments but they are \"better left behind closed doors\".\nSources close to many of the Lionesses say there is confusion over why Earps felt the need to publish her book so close to their Euro 2025 success.\nMany of the players Earps won Euro 2022 with still remain in the England squad and those who have played alongside her and Hampton feel caught in the middle.\nA number of Lionesses have asked to be kept away from media, not wanting to get caught up in the headlines or to create further division among their team-mates.\nWhether it was intended or not, Earps' comments about Hampton have created the illusion that it is this person's side, or the other's - and nobody wants to choose.\nIn Hampton's case, sources close to the Chelsea goalkeeper say she is trying to block out the noise and focus on the crucial Women's Super League game against Arsenal on Saturday, but she has been affected by the unwanted attention.\nWilliams 'baffled' by comments\nEarps herself said she hoped the \"noise of this situation hasn't changed\" her relationship with Wiegman.\nBut most are braced for a distracting period as Wiegman is set to name her squad for England's upcoming friendlies against China and Ghana in two weeks' time.\nThose matches will bring further scutiny on the situation and Wiegman will be forced to address the issues in media conferences, alongside her players.\nIt is not an ideal way to end 2025 - a year in which the squad became the first English team to defend their European title, and to win it on foreign soil.\nThese matches are meant to complete a four-game 'homecoming series' to celebrate their Euro 2025 success. It doesn't feel like much of a celebration now.\nFormer England midfielder Fara Williams wrote in her TNT Sports column that people might \"look at Mary a bit differently\" but her legacy will not be tarnished.\n\"She will always be in the history books after becoming the first goalkeeper to win the Euros with England, making that memorable penalty save in the World Cup final, fighting for young girls to buy goalkeeping shirts, and making goalkeeping fun and popular for the next generation,\" said Williams.\nBut Williams said she \"didn't like\" the comments on Hampton and is \"baffled\" by Earps' decision to speak out publicly about their relationship.\n\"If Mary is going to be open and honest about the situation, she needs to go into more detail about the supposed bad behaviour rather than leave it up in the air,\" added Williams.\n\"I personally don't know if there was bad behaviour from Hannah, but even if that was the case, she served her punishment after being left out of the squad.\n\"If there was any doubt about Hannah's behaviour in the past, it is clear from her actions that she has learnt from that experience.\"",
