As a mother of 3 young adults, two sons and a duaghter, and a high school teacher, I can't impress on you how delighted I was to be watching this game for the reasons below: the sheer athletism, skill, determined effort and sportsmanship being shown by both teams the androgynous sporty non-sexulaised inclusive playing outfits the lack of sports betting or beer ads or inappropriate / dubious sponsorships. Please know that your restraint and thoughtfulness in who you have chosen as your sponsors is so valued. Well done.\n- KMS\nFinal thoughts\nWhat a way to enter into their home World Cup: with a victory over world number 5 and 2019 hosts France.\nMatildas boss Tony Gustavsson will be very happy with what he saw tonight. From different player combinations to different tactical systems, there were a lot of lessons taken from that match.\nThe big worry will be injury. Tameka Yallop came on in the second half only to be substituted out again after hyper-extending her knee, while Kennedy also couldn't see out the whole game.\nLuckily, the work Gustavsson has done over the past two years means he was able to lean on his bench and find ways to fill the gaps.\nIndeed, it was a substitute - Mary Fowler - who made the biggest impact, scoring the game's only goal after a fantastic passage of passes between Hayley Raso and Kyra Cooney-Cross in the second half.\nThey now sail into their opening game against the Republic of Ireland on July 20 having secured wins over three of the world's top five teams - France, England, and Sweden - in the past six months. That'll give them huge confidence that they can go further in this tournament than they ever have before.\nAnd I'll be there every step of the way to take you through it.\nKeep an eye out on ABC Sport tomorrow for my analysis of tonight's match, and I'll see you in less than a week as the Matildas get their World Cup campaign underway!\nLoadingFull-time: Australia 1 - 0 France\n98' France free kick\nLe Sommer is clipped from behind just outside the box on the left side by Clare Hunt in what will likely be the last play of the game.\nThe ball is looped in but cleared away by the wall of yellow shirts.\nGlorious Gorry\nGorry player of the match for mine, she got through a heap of work. Pickle juice all round ladies! Rest well, see you all again soon.\n- Big Ben\nShe's been absolutely immense tonight, hasn't she?\nHer partnership with Kyra Cooney-Cross in midfield has completely changed the look of the Matildas. Their collective engines, creativity, grunt, and fight gives Australia an edge through the middle that not many nations have.\nShe looks totally out of puff, and understandably so. Let's hope she pulls up okay after 98+ minutes of running.\n94' Selma Bacha is down\nThe young French winger has been excellent tonight, but the replays show she's just rolled her ankle quite severely after trying to clear a ball being hunted down by Hayley Raso.\nShe's in tears on the pitch, with Renard leaning over her to offer some comforting words.\nThe stretcher is out. This is a huge blow for France if Bacha is sidelined for a couple weeks.\n93' France corner\nThey're always a scary prospect given the height of Renard and power of Le Sommer, but Australia have batted away every corner that France has had tonight. They've looked really comfortable defending those set pieces as a collective, which is something we weren't able to say a few years ago. Clare Hunt in particular has been epic.\n91' Shout-out to Kyra Cooney-Cross\nWe're into extra time and the youngster just did a half-field sprint to claw down a French player who was trying to dribble up-field and start a counter. She's developed an immense engine playing club football in Sweden and is now almost indispensable for Australia in the middle of the park.\n5 minutes of added time\nFingers crossed, Adam!\nThe injuries are going to be disastrous for the Matildas this close to the World Cup, hopefully neither Alanna Kennedy nor Tameka Yallop end up being ruled out of a home World Cup.\n- Adam\n85' Australia 1 - 0 France\nFive minutes plus stoppage time to go and France have all the ball.\nAustralia are effectively in a back five now, with two screening midfielders in Gorry and Van Egmond, with Raso up front to try and run after every clearance.\nIt's a great test for the team as they prepare for the World Cup. Tony Gustavsson has spoken a few times about rehearsing every possible scenario they could face starting from next week, and managing games in their dying stages is something Australia has struggled to do in the past.\nSo far, it's working.\n82' Kyra Cooney-Cross tries from distance!\nA poor clearance from France's goalkeeper falls right into the chest of the young midfielder, who winds her leg back and goes for the heroic half-volley from about 30-yards out.\nBut she doesn't quite time it right and the ball spins off the top of her toes and out for a goal kick.\nIf she had connected with that and the ball had sailed into the net, I think I would have shattered the windows of the media box from screaming.\n81' Yallop is back on the turf\nThe substitute needs to be substituted. Aivi Luik comes on to shore up the defensive line. Gustavsson wanting to practise holding onto a one-goal lead, perhaps?\n76' Kennedy is down now\nBut it's not clear what she's done.\nIt may just be cramp - she's pulling at her toe as her leg is extended. And it'd make sense: she hasn't played a full game at international level for over six months now, so it's little surprise that her body is still catching up.\nThe break gives the rest of the Matildas a chance to come grab a drink on the sidelines.\nClare Polkinghorne eventually emerges from beneath the bench covers and comes on to replace Kennedy.\nSteph Catley also comes off for Courtney Nevin.\nFrance have made a couple substitutions, too. Both head coaches almost entirely emptying their benches to give most of their squads a run before July 20. Won't be shocked if the final 10-15 minutes are a bit chaotic because of that.\nUpdate\nMary Fowler being in the starting eleven for the World Cup opener against Ireland is practically a given now, how good.\n- Adam\n73' Yallop is down\nAnd she's clutching the back of her left knee after replays showed her hyper-extending it in a tackle.\nI almost choked on my water when the footage came up on the big screen. Big ouch. Given she just came back from an ankle injury, this is the last thing she needs...\nOfficial crowd: 50,629\nIt doesn't quite break the Matildas' home record, but it's a fantastic turn-out six days before what should be the Big One at Stadium Australia against the Republic of Ireland.\nGood job, Melbourne!\nLoading70' France substitution\nDiani has worked hard tonight and gets a well-earned early rest.",
