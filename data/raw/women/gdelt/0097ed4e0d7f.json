The list was ranked by the percentage of respondents who liked the actor. YouGov distinguishes actors in their surveys with a binary understanding of sex and gender. Stacker understands that potentially limits who is represented on this list.\nHowever, the rankings still include an impressive range of thespians, including Oscar winners, box office juggernauts, and some of the \"sexiest men alive.\" A handful of these actors have been on the nation's A-list for decades, while others have taken over headlines and screens more recently.\nSteve Martin, for instance, built up a lengthy career in comedy writing and acting but had begun to slow down in the last few years. That is until he soared back into the limelight in 2021 with his role on Hulu's hit series \"Only Murders in the Building,\" which launched its fourth season in August 2024. Ryan Gosling, too, took some time away from Hollywood to focus on fatherhood after starring in the generally panned \"Blade Runner 2049\" and \"First Man,\" only to reassert his blockbuster chops by playing Ken in 2023's massive hit \"Barbie.\" And that's to say nothing of Matthew McConaughey's resurgence in the 2010s, a phenomenon aptly dubbed the \"McConaissance.\"\nWhether on this list for the first time or the fifth, these actors wield some serious star power and have made quite an impression on American audiences. Read on to see if your favorite performer made the cut.\nYou may also like: James Baldwin: The life story you may not know\n- Liked by: 68%\n- Disliked by: 10%\n- Neutral opinion: 19%\n- Have heard of: 97%\nAfter starting early as a child actor with supporting parts on \"Romper Room\" and \"Growing Pains,\" Leonardo DiCaprio became one of the most lauded U.S. actors of all time.
