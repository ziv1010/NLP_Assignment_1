  "body_text": "Fortune hopes key duo will return for Shels showdown\nBy Darryl Geraghty\nFollowing last weekend's victory over Peamount United in their Women's FAI Cup quarter-final, Athlone Town's attention swiftly turns to a potentially title defining league clash at home to arch rivals Shelbourne on Saturday evening (7.35pm).\nAlthough the sides still have to play each other twice more this season, Saturday's game (live on TG4) could go a long way towards deciding the fate of the Women's Premier Division title.\nThe Reds have leapfrogged Athlone at the summit thanks to three league wins on the spin, whilst the reigning champions drew three games in a row over the same period that now sees them two points behind.\nWhen questioned on a potential return to action of the likes of Izzy Groves or Hannah Waesch, Athlone manager Colin Fortune opted to remain tightlipped on any potential walking wounded returning from injury, keen to not show his hand.\n“Yeah we’re looking forward to it, it's another big game like we have had in recent weeks. I know it sounds like a cliché but it’s just the next game on the list,\" said Fortune.\n\"We’re going to prepare as normal, rest and recover now and get ready during the week. It’s two top teams on TV, so let's hope that football decides who the winner is, and not something else. So I'm really looking forward to it.\n“Look, we’ll assess everyone, injured and not, during the week with the hope of having maybe one or two back involved but not sure yet. We have a lot of other tough games coming up so it's about finding the balance and only putting players on the pitch that are 100% fit. At this level you can’t afford anyone not at 100%, it will just do more damage so let’s see.”\nReflecting on the win over Peamount (see report on page 65), Fortune was relieved after seeing his side fight tooth and nail to overcame their impressive Dublin opponents in the sunny surroundings of Greenogue Park.\n“Delighted after a game like this, absolutely delighted,” said the former Athlone star. “That’s what it's about at this stage, it’s all about just getting through to the next round.\n“It wasn’t pretty, not a nice game to watch but the important thing is we’re through to a semi-final. I’m very proud, and I've been saying it all year, I'm so proud of this bunch. They never stop, their commitment, their workrate and even when it’s not going well, they dig deep and throw their bodies on the line.”\nFortune praised Peamount who had a couple of good chances but were met by some top class goalkeeping in the shape of Maria Matthaiou who saved her side on the day.\n“Listen, Peamount are a good side. People thought we were just going to turn up and Peamount were going to roll over and it was never going to be like that. There is nothing between the teams in the top half of the table. Peamount were probably the better team on the day; I'm sure they’re very disappointed they didn’t get anything out of the game, but we’re delighted, we dug deep again.”\nA stunning, long range Aoife O’Connor strike separated the sides and the talented 18-year-old, affectionately known as 'MOC' (from her full surname Murphy O’Connor), came in for some special praise. A beaming Fortune added: “We see that every week in training from her. That's why she is with us and that's why she is playing. She is a top, top player, and I've said it for a while now, she's one to watch for now and for the future and what a top class goal to win the tie for us.”",
