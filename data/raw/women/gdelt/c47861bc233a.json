Miedema wore number 11 for the majority of her time at Arsenal, but is used to donning number 9 when representing the Netherlands on the international stage.\nCity have also confirmed Japan international Risa Shimizu will wear the number 2 shirt in her debut season.\nLucy Bronze was the first owner of the shirt during her first spell at City between 2015 and 2017. Shimizu becomes the fifth different player to the wear the number 2 and the first since Kerstin Casparij during the 2022/23 campaign.\nDuring the summer transfer window, Ellie Roebuck, Demi Stokes, Esme Morgan, Ruby Mace and Filippa Angeldahl have all exited City.\nInside the club, Australia international Alanna Kennedy has taken Morgan's number 14, while midfielder Jill Roord has switched from 20 to 10.\nThe options up for grabs as it stands are:\n- 1\n- 3\n- 6\n- 12\n- 20\n- 30\nCan WSL players change squad numbers?\nIn the modern game and due to so many players being flexible in their positioning, squad numbers don't have as much meaning as they used to.\nPlayers tend to have the option to choose any number they wish, but certain clubs may enforce specific numbering rules.",
