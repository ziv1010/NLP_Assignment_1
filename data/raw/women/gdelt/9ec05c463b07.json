  "body_text": "Germany proud but defeated as Spain retain Nations League\nDecember 2, 2025Not too long ago, anything but winning was unacceptable for Germany's women's national team. But, despite a 3-0 loss to Spain in the Nations League final, a new generation are showing real signs of progression.\nAs Spain added a second consecutive Nations League title to their 2023 World Cup win, Germany were left reflecting on a trophy drought that will soon stretch beyond a decade.\nBut Christian Wück's team's presence in the final, and performance across the two legs, were enough to suggest that a major tournament win is not beyond the current generation.\n\"We can be very, very proud,\" said Wück after two second half goals from Claudia Pina either side of one from Vicky Lopez were enough for Spain.\n\"It was even in the first half but we couldn't maintain that level of play. We have to be honest about that.\"\nProfligacy proves costly again\nGermany's best chance fell shortly before halftime but, one on one with the keeper, Nicole Anyomi pulled her shot wide. It was a familiar tale for the 2016 Olympic champions, who failed to take advantage of numerous chances in the first leg in Kaiserslautern on Friday.\n\"That has to go in, and she had another one in the box in the second half,\" Wuck said of Anyomi’s chance.\n\"That's the difference between us and the technically gifted Spanish players.\"\nSpain’s cohesive style at both club and national level is the blueprint for Wück, who has gradually rebuilt Germany after their shock group stage exit at the 2023 World Cup. Gone are veterans like Alex Popp and Svenja Huth, and new leaders, such as Klara Bühl, Giulia Gwinn and Sjoeke Nüsken are beginning to assert their authority.\n\"You saw over the two games we can live with Spain. We can take a lot of positives out of the first game. But today the Spanish were just more efficient to break the deadlock,\" Nüsken, who plays her club football for Chelsea, told German broadcaster ARD after the game.\n\"If we had taken our chances (in the first game) it could have been different.\"\nBeaten but not bowed\nThat is was not enough against Spain is no disgrace.\n\"It's extremely painful, but I think we can be very, very proud,\" said Bühl, echoing the words of her coach.\nWins against the Netherlands and France in this competition will undoubtedly boost the morale of a relatively inexperienced German team who will now look to the World Cup in Brazil in 2027. Beyond that is a possible home Euro 2029, with European football governors UEFA set to announce the tournament hosts on Wednesday. Germany are the favorites over Poland and a joint bid from Denmark and Sweden.\nA crowd of 40,000 in the first leg in Germany would have done the bid no harm. Even more packed into the Metropolitano in Madrid on Tuesday, including the King of Spain, yet more evidence of the sustained growth of the women’s game, at international level at least.\nHermoso back in Spain fold\nAmong those to enjoy that was Jenni Hermoso, recalled to the Spain squad for the Nations League semifinals by new coach Sonia Bermudez and substituted on with 10 minutes remaining. Hermoso was forcibly kissed on the lips after the 2023 World Cup win by then Spanish football federation president Luis Rubiales, creating worldwide outrage and eventually leading to a FIFA ban and a sexual assault conviction for Rubiales.\n\"My happy face says it all, to come back, to win in my city, with my people, with the whole family, that we put on a show, it's great,\" Hermoso told Spanish broadcaster TVE.\n\"Today I am very proud to wear this shirt, to win a title, and still be enjoying football.\"\nAfter the shock of 2023 and a Euros where they fought hard without inspiration, Germany appear to be starting to enjoy their football again, even if this team still lack the cutting edge once provided by Popp. A World Cup qualifying group featuring Slovenia, Norway and Austria awaits next year.\nEdited by: Chuck Penfold.",
