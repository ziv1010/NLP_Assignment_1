Group A guide\n- Published\nGroup A is perhaps the toughest to call at Euro 2025.\nHosts Switzerland are in the group, alongside Norway, Iceland and Finland.\nIceland are the highest ranked team in the group, sitting 14th in the world, but two-time winners Norway have pedigree in the competition.\nMeanwhile, Switzerland will be keen to impress on home soil - like England and the Netherlands did in the last two editions.\nThree of the teams - Switzerland, Norway and Iceland - were all in the same Women's Nations League group so have faced each other recently and the Norwegians fared better in those meetings.\nBBC Sport takes a closer look at the teams involved.\nFinland\nManager: Marko Saloranta Appointed: 2023 Nationality: Finnish\nCaptain: Tinja-Riikka Korpela Position: Goalkeeper Club: Servette\nKey player: Emma Koivisto Position: Defender/midfielder Club: AC Milan\nForm: Finland finished bottom of their qualifying group but managed to qualify by beating Scotland 2-0 on aggregate in their play-off final in December.\nThey have fared well in League B - the second tier - of the Nations League but how will they perform against tougher opposition in Switzerland?\nTournament hopes: With a manager who has never guided a team through a major tournament before and after losing all three of their group-stage games in 2022, Finland will definitely be classed as an underdog in Switzerland.\nFinland - the second lowest ranked team in the competition - have a solid defence but they're missing a key threat up front.\nIceland\nManager: Thorsteinn Halldorsson Nationality: Icelandic Appointed: 2021\nCaptain: Glodis Perla Viggosdottir Position: Defender Club: Bayern Munich\nKey player: Karolina Lea Vilhjalmsdottir Position: Forward Club: Bayern Munich\nForm: Iceland enjoyed a superb qualifying campaign, finishing the group second behind eight-time European champions Germany, who they beat 3-0.\nBut they are winless in their last 10 matches, having last won in July 2024, although they have drawn three of their last four matches in the Women's Nations League - twice against Norway and once with Switzerland, who they will face again in this group.\nTournament hopes: In the four editions of the Euros that Iceland have qualified for, they have only won one game - against the Netherlands in 2013.\nThorsteinn Halldorsson will hope attacking stars Karolina Lea Vilhjalmsdottir of Bayern Munich and Wolfsburg's Sveindis Jane Jonsdottir can spearhead the team further this summer.\nNorway\nManager: Gemma Grainger Nationality: English Appointed: 2024\nCaptain: Ada Hegerberg Position: Forward Club: Lyon\nKey player: Caroline Graham Hansen Position: Winger Club: Barcelona\nForm: In a difficult qualifying group with Italy and the Netherlands, Norway won just one game and were forced to seal their place at the Euros via the play-offs by beating Northern Ireland in December.\nIn the same Nations League group as two of their fellow Group A teams, Norway have beaten Switzerland twice already this year but Iceland have proved a tougher opponent - holding Gemma Grainger's side to a draw on both occasions.\nTournament hopes: Despite their recent form, Norway will be favourites to top Group A thanks to their pedigree as former world, European and Olympic champions.\nHowever, they have failed to reach the quarter-finals at the last two Euros and suffered a humiliating 8-0 defeat by eventual champions England during the group stage in 2022.\nTheir squad boosts immense attacking talent with names like Caroline Graham Hansen, Ada Hegerberg, Frida Maanum and Elisabeth Terland, but they appear to lack the same kind of quality in defence.\nSwitzerland\nManager: Pia Sundhage Nationality: Swedish Appointed: 2024\nCaptain: Lia Walti Position: Midfielder Club: Arsenal\nKey player: Sydney Schertenleib Position: Forward Club: Barcelona\nForm: Having qualified automatically as the hosts, Switzerland still impressed during the qualifying tournament, winning five of their six games.\nA win against France in October was seen as a big deal but they have since been thrashed 6-0 by Germany and failed to beat both Norway and Iceland in the Nations League.\nTournament hopes: Switzerland, who are making just their third appearance at a European Championship, have never advanced past the group stage.\nHowever, they surprised people when they topped their group at the 2023 World Cup, pipping Norway and co-hosts New Zealand to first place before losing to eventual champions Spain in the last 16.\nThe hosts have a good mix of youth - with the likes of Barcelona teenager Sydney Schertenleib - and experience, with players like Lia Walti and Ana-Maria Crnogorcevic, although striker Ramona Bachmann misses out with a serious knee injury.\nRelated topics\n- Published27 June 2025\n- Published23 June 2025\n- Published23 June 2025",
