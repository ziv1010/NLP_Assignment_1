America needs to recalibrate its priorities to protect the lives and aspirations of its citizens. The horrific murder of Laken Riley by a repeated felony offender and illegal alien Jose Ibarra, 26, a Venezuelan citizen, was preventable—had federal immigration laws simply been enforced by the Biden administration. When called out in his recent State of the Union address, President Biden referenced the deceased Ms. Riley. But Biden misidentified her as “Lincoln Riley”—the USC football coach! Biden only accurately noted that she “was killed by an “illegal.””... -\n16 SWAT officers hospitalized after blast at training facility in Southern California\n16 SWAT officers hospitalized after blast at training facility in Southern California An explosion during a California training exercise sent 16 members of the Orange County Sheriff’s Department SWAT team to the hospital... The FBI Special Agent Jerry Crowe Regional Tactical Training Facility south of Los Angeles hosts firearms training and qualifications tests for the bureau and local law enforcement agencies, Eimiller said. The FBI will lead the investigation, Gonzalez said.... ... -\nBiden’s ‘Trojan Pier’ for Gaza\nSix Americans are still being held hostage by Hamas, and Biden has sent no troops to help them, but at the State of the Union address, he promised to send troops to build a pier for Gaza. The estimated over 1,000 troops will spend as long as 2 months laboring to build a floating pier in a war zone under potential attack to help transfer aid to the Hamas supporters living in Gaza. Nothing about this plan makes sense. The media has taken to falsely claiming that the Arab Muslims occupying parts of Gaza are starving. Vice President Kamala Harris... -\nTop U.S. military chief visits munitions plants with lawmakers to press the need to arm Ukraine\nJoint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. is visiting U.S. weapon factories in Oklahoma and Arkansas on Thursday as the Pentagon frames the $95 billion aid package hanging in the balance on Capitol Hill as not only vital to Ukraine’s survival but also critical to the U.S. economy. Brown is visiting Lockheed Martin’s Camden, Arkansas, weapon facility and the McAlester Army Ammunition Plant in McAlester, Oklahoma, with the lawmakers who represent those factory workforces to address concerns over billions of dollars being sent overseas when there are so many needs at home. Some of those lawmakers have either already... -\nYellen on Record Credit Card Spending: We Have ‘Normalization,’ Not ‘Disturbing New Trend’\nDuring an interview with the Fox Business Network on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen answered a question on record credit card spending by stating that we still have strong credit quality and delinquencies have gone up a small amount from a historically low level and while “particularly lower-income households are borrowing again on credit cards. I see that as a normalization, rather than a disturbing new trend.” Fox Business White House Correspondent Edward Lawrence asked, [relevant exchange begins around 4:05] “Last year, many economists predicted a recession this year. We haven’t seen it. It looks like we may not see... -\nBaseball legend Steve Garvey has edged ahead of U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff in California's U.S. Senate primary.\nAs of Wednesday morning, Garvey, a former 10-time MLB All-Star, led Schiff by an incredibly slim margin of just 4,801 votes with more than 5 million votes tallied — about 85% of expected returns. -\nTeacher Pay: Half-truths and Reality; Are Public School Teachers Really Underpaid?\nBenjamin Franklin once famously quipped, “In this world, nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes.” Today, however, we can alter that to “death, taxes, and a slew of myths about teacher pay.”Leading the half-truth brigade, on March 4, a headline in My eLearning World read, “New Teachers Are Earning 20% Less Than They Were 20 Years Ago.” The piece informs us that if starting salaries for new teachers had kept pace with inflation over the last 20 years, a teacher just starting out would currently be making $53,303 per year. Instead, using data from the National... -\nIllegal migrant charged with assaulting girls at Maryland church was deported twice: ICE\nErvin Jeovany Alfaro Lopez has been charged with sexually abusing four girls at a church in Maryland... An illegal migrant from El Salvador who has been twice deported from the U.S. was this week charged with more than 20 counts of sex abuse and sex offenses of minors during his time working as a church teacher in Maryland. Ervin Jeovany Alfaro Lopez, 33, was arrested on Monday by the Montgomery County Department of Police on charges including sex abuse of a minor. The incidents allegedly took place between 2016 and 2018 at a Derwood church located in the 15700 block... -\nThursday War Room, 10AM-Noon & 5-7PM ET\nPM 4Liberty, if you want On/Off this listhttps://pluto.tv/live-tv/americas-voicehttps://americasvoice.news/Tune in via Roku/AppleTV/AmazonFire with the America’s Voice App https://americasvoice.appLIVE STREAM all Bannon shows & find past episodes here: https://rumble.com/c/BannonsWarRoom | https://americasvoice.news/playlists/the-war-room/ -\nThe IRS is putting David Horowitz’s Freedom Center out of business\nAccording to Horowitz, the IRS contends that, by reporting on Hillary Clinton’s national security violations, the tax-exempt foundation effectively endorsed Trump. Nobody likes the IRS, but Americans always assumed that the IRS was an equal opportunity government pest, bedeviling people across the political spectrum. The belief in the agency’s non-partisan status vanished in 2013 when we learned that the IRS had deliberately withheld tax-exempt status from Tea Party organizations, severely hampering their ability to share information during the 2012 presidential election. Now, David Horowitz contends that the IRS is trying to destroy his long tax-exempt Freedom Center, which, among many... -\nBoeing plane forced to make emergency landing at LAX after possible mechanical issue (6th issue in a week!)\nThe American Airlines flight took off from Dallas-Fort Worth in Texas and landed safely at the Los Angeles airport An American Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing in California Wednesday evening after its pilot reported a possible mechanical issue, the airline said. -\nHochul: Republicans Are Now to Blame for Migrant Crisis\nGovernor Kathy Hochul (D-NY) said Wednesday on ABC’s “The View” that she believed after the border bill failed, Republicans were to blame for the migrant crisis. Hochul said, “We are a nation of immigrants. I’m sitting here because my grandparents were teenagers in Ireland leaving great poverty. My grandpa started as a migrant farm worker himself in South Dakota in the wheat feels.” She continued, “Fast forward to today, which is your question, we are doing the best we can to manage the influx, get people housing, it is very expensive and the state of New York is in for... -\nVIDEO: Democrat Palm Beach County Sheriff Denounces Federal Open Border Policy\nVIDEOThis is a local story that should be national. The Democrat Sheriff of Palm Beach County, Ric Bradshaw, has DENOUNCED the federal open border policy that has allowed this country to be flooded with dangerous illegal aliens. Three of the illegals were just arrested in his jurisdiction for sexually assaulting a local woman. Meanwhile Joe Biden who ALREADY has the power to shut down the border without any additional legislation is now on an apology tour for calling an illegal murderer \"illegal.\" -\nReport: Biden Officials to Meet Palestinians in Chicago amid Wave of Antisemitism\nSenior White House officials will reportedly meet with members of the Arab, Muslim, and Palestinian immigrant communities in Chicago on Thursday, without having commented on the latest wave of antisemitism in that city. CNN reported: Senior White House officials are planning to meet with Arab-, Muslim- and Palestinian-American community leaders in Chicago on Thursday, multiple sources familiar with the meeting told CNN, as President Joe Biden continues to grapple with anger and concern across the country about the Israel-Hamas war. … Among those expected to participate in the meeting, according to sources, are: Tom Perez, the White House’s director of... -\nOur Fake, Fake, Fake World\nWill our historical era be remembered as the “Age of Fakes”? We have fake news, fake meat, fake elections, fake genders, fake vaccines, fake budgets, fake democracy, fake truths, fake hate, fake Russian collusion, fake insurrections, fake climate emergencies, fake freedoms, fake outrage, fake speech crimes, fake money, fake justice, fake intellects, fake women, fake borders, fake wars, and even a fake president. In some ways, it is a very silly time to be alive. So much of our fake world has been built on two monstrously fake foundations: fake progress and fake liberalism. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson... -\nJohnson signals shift on Ukraine to GOP senators\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told Republican senators Wednesday to expect the House to send them legislation to help Ukraine, but cautioned that what comes out of the House will look substantially different than the $95 billion foreign aid package the Senate passed last month. Johnson tried to reassure frustrated GOP senators who asked him about funding for Ukraine during a question-and-answer session at the annual Senate Republican retreat, which was held at the Library of Congress. Johnson told senators that the House will send a Ukraine aid package to the Senate but floated the idea of making it a loan... -\nHow the Czech Republic has just stopped Putin cold and saved Ukraine\nRussia went to war in Ukraine two years ago with twice as many artillery pieces as Ukraine had. But it isn’t the advantage in howitzers that really matters – it’s the advantage in shells. The Czechs found, for Ukraine, nearly a million shells precisely when Ukraine needed those million shells the most: at the peak of Russia’s winter offensive. It’s not an exaggeration to say that the Czech artillery initiative probably saved entire Ukrainian cities, by giving the Ukrainian army the firepower to resist a much bigger Russian army. It’s no secret how Ukraine got into an artillery bind late... -\nBan on foreign state ownership of UK newspapers effectively halts UAE takeover of Telegraph\nForeign state control of British newspapers is to be outlawed, effectively blocking the UAE’s attempted takeover of The Telegraph. Ministers revealed plans on Wednesday “explicitly to rule out newspaper and periodical news magazine mergers involving ownership, influence or control by foreign states”. The move, announced by Lord Parkinson, the culture minister, was made to see off a rebellion being led by a Tory peer and sparked by The Telegraph’s predicament. RedBird IMI, a fund 75 per cent backed by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE vice-president, had positioned itself to take control of The Telegraph and The Spectator... -\nThe Crime of Mohamed Hadid-An Israel hater utters a threat to Joe Biden\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...Ah, the Hadids. Where would we be without them? Brainless beauties, those Hadid girls, Gigi and Bella, sashaying down the catwalks of the Western world, and their doting, equally empty-headed, stage-door papa, a real-estate tycoon on his uppers and down on his luck, in sunny California, appear to have no other subject in their empty heads – as their Instagram postings make clear — than the hideousness of the Israelis and the sheer wonderfulness of the Palestinians they persecute. Gigi has informed the world that “Jesus was a Palestinian,” that the Palestinians are the “indigenous”... -\nThreats to Humility: Strength and Boasting -Protestant Caucus/Devotional\n“Walk . . . with all humility” (Ephesians 4:1-2). Satan will tempt us to be proud of our abilities and accomplishments, but we must remember that every good thing we have is from God. We’ve just studied three steps to humility. Let’s look at the issue from another angle: What kinds of pride threaten to destroy our humility? Where will we struggle to be humble? There are several areas in which Satan will attack us. The first area I call ability pride. We’re often tempted to be proud of our strong points, not our weak ones. I’ve never been tempted...\nBrowse by Forum\nGet Connected!
