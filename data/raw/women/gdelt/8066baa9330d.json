  "body_text": "Frida Maanum's wonder strike against Bayern Munich has been voted second in our 2022/23 women's Goal of the Season poll.\nAfter trailing Bayern in the opening quarter-final of the UEFA Women's Champions League, it was vital for our side to get a good start back at Emirates Stadium and in the 19th minute, our Norwegian maestro delivered.\nIn an exemplary display of our aggressive high press, we forced an error from Bayern in the final third, allowing Lia Walti to pick up possession. The next few seconds were one-touch football at its best: Stina Blackstenius quickly laid the ball off to Leah Williamson at the edge of the area and our defender's no-look backheel found Frida ready and waiting.\nHit with power and precision, her shot sailed into the top corner like a postage stamp, causing Jonas Eidevall and our coaching staff to literally jump for joy as the rain continued to pound down in north London. This spectacular goal has already been named the Champions League Goal of the Tournament, beating Caroline Graham Hansen and Mapi Leon to scoop the accolade.\nSee every angle of Frida's belter by clicking play on the video above.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
