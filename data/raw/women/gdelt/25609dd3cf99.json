  "body_text": "Ex-player Kemme: DFB must think outside the box in search for coach\nFormer women's international Tabea Kemme has said the German Football Federation (DFB) is not thinking outside the box enough by not looking abroad in its search for a new women's team coach.\n\"The DFB is moving slowly - and in my opinion has already missed looking at the international coaching market,\" Kemme said in a column for the t-online portal.\n\"It would be important for the DFB to show the courage to get involved with someone who brings a new, fresh perspective from abroad. The future depends on it.\"\nThe 2016 Olympic champion added the past has shown that the association \"always falls back on the same old candidates. I have the feeling that the DFB doesn't think outside the box enough.\"\nThe DFB last month parted ways with Martina Voss-Tecklenburg in the wake of a World Cup group stage exit and is yet to announce a successor. Horst Hrubesch is acting as interim coach until next year's Paris Olympics, provided the team qualifies.\nKemme named England's Emma Hayes, Barcelona's Jonatan Giráldez and Juventus' highly exciting candidates but not all available.\n\"These are all top players from abroad, at the DFB I always see the same people who have also gone through their own system,\" criticised 32-year-old Kemme.\nKemme meanwhile welcomed the appointment of Nia Künzer as DFB women's football director, saying that the 2003 World Cup winner \"has the necessary leadership skills. With her, this enormously important position in women's football finally has a face.\"\nShe expressed hope that Künzer \"will also receive the support she needs to tackle the tough challenges she will have to face.\"\n\"It is clear that the male leaders at the DFB continue to sketch outdated images and are less open to a woman in a high-ranking position,\" Kemme said.",
