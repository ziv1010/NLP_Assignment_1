The Lioness kicked off her football career with her home city's women's team before joining Everton Women in 2006 and Manchester City in 2013.\nJill's career highlights include winning the Women's Super League title with City in 2017, scoring England's winner against Holland in the Euro 2009 semi-finals, and representing Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics, Yorkshire Live reports.\nREAD MORE: Saturday Night Takeaway fans disagree as Ant forced to apologise\nJill also won the most recent series of I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here, having made it to the final alongside Hollyoaks' Owen Warner and former Health Secretary Matt Hancock.\nBack in 2020, Jill shared the exciting news she was engaged to former Lionesses player Rachel Unitt's sister Shelly Unitt. They have been together for around five years, and while fans may know Jill best as a footballer, she also co-owns a coffee shop with Shelly.\nAs they got engaged during lockdown, they said there was \"no engagement party\", but after she emerged from the jungle as the winner, Jill said: \"We need to sit down and just catch up on the last five weeks and what’s happened but obviously getting engaged, the next plan is to get wed.”\nIt’s not clear how much Jill Scott is worth, but according to Heart her net worth is somewhere between $1.5million (£1.3million) and $4million (£3.4million).\nReceive newsletters with the biggest and breaking TV and showbiz news by signing up here\nREAD NEXT:\nEmmerdale fans taken aback by Laurel Thomas star's real age\nBBC Bargain Hunt host forced to apologise as viewers complain\nMartin Lewis urges everyone to 'send two texts' before April\nNew Look's 'incredible' £36 dress that's 'perfect for a spring wedding'\nStrictly Come Dancing's Shirley Ballas debuts new look after 'sad' news",
