  "body_text": "Friday briefing: What happened when Keir Starmer met Donald Trump\nGood morning.\nKeir Starmer’s meeting with Donald Trump began as expected: handshakes, backslaps, and warm compliments. Like any good guest, the prime minister did not come empty-handed, offering the president an “unprecedented” second state visit. Starmer was pulling out all the stops to save and protect the decades-old transatlantic alliance. And it seems, for now, that he achieved it: after private talks, Trump affirmed that “the US and UK have a special relationship, very special, really like no other passed down through the centuries. And we’re going to keep it that way. We’re going to keep it very strong as it is.”\nDespite the generally cordial tone, Trump didn’t shy away from goading the prime minister at times. During questions about the war in Ukraine, he asked the prime minister, “could you take on Russia by yourselves?”, prompting nothing more than a laugh from Starmer.\nToday’s newsletter goes through the key takeaways from last night. That’s right after the headlines.\nFive big stories\nChina | Dozens of Uyghurs have been deported from Thailand to China in the face of warnings from human rights experts that there is a high risk they will suffer torture, enforced disappearance and imprisonment. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on Thursday said the US condemned Thailand’s move “in the strongest possible terms”.\nTransport | HS2 has become “a casebook example of how not to run a major project”, according to the latest scathing report on the high-speed rail line from MPs on the public accounts committee. The MPs said it was “unacceptable that over a decade into the programme, we still do not know what it will cost, what the final scope will be, when it will finally be completed or what benefits it will deliver”.\nLocal authorities | Almost half of councils in England risk falling into bankruptcy without action to address a £4.6bn deficit amassed under a Conservative-era policy, the government’s spending watchdog has warned.\nUK news | A network of Telegram channels with Russian links is encouraging people in Britain to commit violent attacks on mosques and Muslims and offering cryptocurrency in return, campaigners have warned.\nEntertainment | The Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife, classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, were found dead at their New Mexico home on Wednesday afternoon. The Press Association confirmed an “active investigation’’ into the deaths.\nIn depth: Starmer’s charm offensive\nAs with other world leaders, Trump dominated the conversation. The prime minister did, however, gently push back at points – most notably when correcting Trump on the nature of British assistance to Ukraine. When Trump claimed European countries were getting most of their money back, Starmer interjected, clarifying that much of Britain’s aid to Ukraine was given, not loaned. It echoed a similar moment with the French president, Emmanuel Macron.\nAll in all, after much hand-wringing, Starmer appears to have successfully threaded the needle with the president. Trump called him a “very tough negotiator” – high praise in Maga circles – suggesting that in private Starmer managed to hold his ground without resorting to sycophancy or outright deference.\n***\nTrump and the king\nTrump’s admiration for the royal family is no secret – it was one of the few diplomatic cards Starmer could play with confidence. Handing over the king’s invitation to meet in Scotland, Sky’s Beth Rigby noted that Trump “genuinely seemed utterly delighted”. The clout of an unprecedented second state visit appears to have done the trick – for now. As Washington bureau chief David Smith aptly put in his sketch: “Starmer calculated correctly that the puff and pageantry of a state visit with King Charles was bound to appeal to a man who, when he recently wrote on social media, ‘LONG LIVE THE KING!’, had only himself in mind.”\n***\nDenials\nDonald Trump took aim at Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week, falsely calling him a “dictator” and deepening the rift between the two leaders. The remark sparked widespread criticism across Europe, with Starmer making it clear he stood firmly with Zelenskyy.\nWhen a reporter pressed Trump on his comment, the former president came back with a Steve Urkel-style response: “Did I say that?” His answer made it clear he had no intention of doubling down. He did, however, attempt a conciliatory tone, calling Ukraine’s president “very brave,” though he stopped short of fully retracting his initial comment.\n***\nThe minerals and the peace deal\nAfter days of negotiations, Zelenskyy announced that Ukraine and the US had reached a “preliminary” deal to hand over revenue from some of Ukraine’s critical mineral resources to the US. The Trump administration expects him to sign the deal later today. Initially, Zelenskyy had accused Washington of pressuring him into an agreement that would leave 10 generations of Ukrainians paying it back.\nTrump defended the deal yesterday, calling it a “backstop”. He argued that the presence of American workers and companies extracting the minerals would serve as a deterrent against Russian attacks. But this falls far short of the security guarantees that Ukraine has long sought. Ultimately, Trump declined to commit to deploying US forces alongside European and British peacekeeping troops, though he insisted that the US would “always” support the British military if need be.\nEarlier this month, Zelenskyy warned that it would be “very, very, very difficult” for Ukraine to survive without continued US military support. “Security guarantees without America are not real security guarantees,” he told the Guardian.\nOn the broader negotiations, Trump expressed confidence that Putin would honour a peace deal. “I don’t believe he’s going to violate his word. I don’t think he’ll be back when we make a deal. I think the deal is going to hold now. They’re going to have security.”\nEarlier in the day, Putin continued his months-long charm offensive towards Trump, praising his administration for its “pragmatism, a realistic worldview”.\n***\nChagos Islands\nTrump suggested he would support the UK’s controversial plan to give up control of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, which would then lease one of the islands back to Britain to maintain a strategic airbase used by both the UK and the US.\nThe deal was first announced in October but became mired in uncertainty after the election of a new Mauritian leader, who has pushed to reopen negotiations. He is asking for changes that could see the total cost soar from £8bn to £19bn. The government has denied this and was hoping for more support from the US.\n***\nTariffs tirade\nThe UK’s distance from the European Union appears to have worked in its favour when it comes to Trump’s tariffs. While the president did not explicitly confirm that Britain would be spared, he strongly implied it, stating that the UK is in a “very different place” to the EU.\nEarlier this week, Trump accused the EU of trying to “screw the United States” and said he plans to impose 25% tariffs on goods from the bloc “very soon”. His tariff tirade against allies has left the UK increasingly anxious, but for now, at least, the discussion seems to have eased those concerns. He even said the US could have “great trade agreements” with the UK.\nHow long this goodwill will last remains uncertain. As Guardian political correspondent Andrew Sparrow noted, no matter how well this meeting went, the real test “will come when the Trump administration takes decisions, and at this point it is hard to tell how useful the positive language will turn out to be”.\nWhat else we’ve been reading\nHannah Selinger’s account of working in one of New York’s finest restaurants is a shocking read, as the crisp formality of the dining room gives way to the seedy abuses of the star chef who works behind closed doors.

Sixteen massage therapists from the Baltimore area have to date come forward alleging “degrading” behaviour during their treatment of the five-time All Pro.\nFootball | The Premier League could be forced to operate two separate transfer windows this summer due to disruption caused by the Club World Cup. Fifa has announced plans to open an interim transfer window at the end of this season to allows clubs competing in the tournament to add to their squads and agree contract extensions with their current players before the tournament begins on 14 June.\nThe front pages\n“Trump: US workers in Ukraine would be a security ‘backstop’” says the Guardian while the Times has “Trump: We’ll end war and strike trade deal with UK”. “Trump backs Starmer on Chagos” – that’s the Telegraph and the Mirror goes with “Keir’s Trump card”. “Charmer Starmer pulls off diplomatic win in White House” is the i’s version while even the Mail has to give credit with “What an unlikely bromance!”. “Trump backs ‘great trade deal’ for Brexit Britain” – surprisingly there’s no subheading somehow claiming it as a “victory for the Express”. The Financial Times has “Trump dashes hopes over US cover for Europe peacekeepers in Ukraine”. Top story in the Metro is “Mystery of Hackman deaths”.\nSomething for the weekend\nOur critics’ roundup of the best things to watch, read, play and listen to right now\nTV\nToxic Town | ★★★★☆\nCorby, Northamptonshire, 1995: the disused steelworks that were once the heartbeat of the town are to be redeveloped into housing and a theme park. As the land is cleared, a crimson dust of toxic substances is stirred up; open-topped trucks full of the stuff career past unknowing residents to a messy landfill. And so the scene is set for Toxic Town, a true-story drama about a very British scandal. Susan (Jodie Whittaker) and Tracey (Aimee Lou Wood) meet on a maternity ward, before both give birth to children with disabilities. When Susan realises other women nearby have had similar outcomes, she starts a campaign for justice. In the darker moments here, there are flashes of the bleak malevolence of Red Riding or Sherwood. But, however distressing the facts of the case, Toxic Town feels a responsibility to ensure its audience sticks it out. So, ultimately, this is a bittersweet feelgood piece, where ordinary people suffer in deindustrialised towns that have intractable problems, but score a win by supporting each other. Jack Seale\nMusic\nPanda Bear: Sinister Grift | ★★★★☆\nMuch as Noah “Panda Bear” Lennox – the most prolific and intriguing member of Animal Collective – has cautioned against viewing Sinister Grift purely as an album about divorce – a kind of lysergic Blood on the Tracks for Pitchfork readers – it’s hard not to. Initially at least, the lyrics are pitched against music that’s not just richly melodic, but incongruously sun-kissed. But then, just after Sinister Grift’s midpoint, the album begins to shift: the tempo dramatically drops, the vague hint of melancholy that underpins even Animal Collective’s most euphoric moments seems to gradually overwhelm its sound. This is a bold, risky way to sequence an album: listeners entranced by the pop smarts of its opening tracks may give up and turn Sinister Grift off as the whole thing dissolves into mournful, introspective and abstract territory. But if you pay attention to the words, you can’t say Lennox didn’t warn you, and for those minded to stick with it, there’s something striking and believable about its emotional arc. Tagging along is a curious and curiously powerful experience. Alexis Petridis\nFilm\nLast Breath | ★★★★☆\nIt does not take much to convince that, as an opening title card for Last Breath states, the job of a saturation diver is one of the most dangerous on earth. Based on real catastrophic events during a would-be routine pipeline fix 3,000ft below the surface of the North Sea in 2012, Last Breath is a gripping disaster flick of routine, improvisation and unfathomable experience – the participants shockingly cool under pressure, as the viewer descends into deep, deep stress. The story has been out there for awhile, but it’s best to avoid Googling, if possible, to feel the full, stomach-dropping shock of events one stormy late night in September, off the coast of Aberdeen. Riveting, seamless, at points genuinely shocking, Last Breath exemplifies the possibilities of human collaboration – a feat that has stuck with me and, yes, took my breath away.
