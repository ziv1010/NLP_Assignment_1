  "body_text": "Bullets appoints even ex-players in coaching panels\nTNM Super League champions FCB Nyasa Bullets have named seven former players in various positions of their reserves and Under-19 teams.\nIn a statement released yesterday, the People’s Team named their 2024 technical panels for all teams with head coach Kalisto Pasuwa maintaining the majority of his first team quadruple-winning coaching and support staff.\nHowever, Bullets have made some changes in the reserves and youth teams by appointing immediate ex-players John Lanjesi, Yamikani Fodya, Henry Kabichi, Rabson Chienda and McFallen Mgwira as well as former captain Chimango Kayira and former goalkeeper Simeon Kapuza in various positions.\nKabichi is assistant coach to Reserves side head coach Enos Chatama while Fundi Akidu remains the team manager.\nFormer captain Lanjesi has been appointed the reserve team’s physical trainer while Chienda is now the team’s goalkeeper trainer.\nFormer defender Fodya is now Under-19 head coach with Chimango Kayira as his assistant.\nKayira thanked Bullets for the appointment which came while he was with Mpira Mmudzi Mwathu as coach.\nHe said: “I look forward to an exciting adventure as I commence my coaching journey. Thank you all for the love and support through and through.”\nMgwira is now under-19 team second assistant coach while Chikumbutso Kanyenda has been retained as team manager with Kapuza as goalkeepers’ trainer.\nThe notable change in the senior team technical panel is the appointment of performance analyst Michael Ngore as first assistant coach, a position which has been vacant since last year when their firmer great Peter Mponda, who is now Silver Strikers coach, left for Black Leopards of South Africa.\nHeston Munthali has retained his second assistant coach post while James Chilapondwa is still the team manager.\nFormer midfielder Fischer Kondowe has also retained his physical trainer position while Vincent Gona will continue training goalkeepers.\nBullets have also maintained their women’s football team coach Maggie Chombo-Sadiki while Charles Lubani is assistant coach.\nIn an interview yesterday, Bullets chief administration officer Albert Chigoga said the club’s policy aims at promoting their former players coaching careers.\nHe said: “It is more than a thank you for their services. These guys demonstrated leadership attributes during their playing days and in the twilight of their respective careers.\n“Some of them started pursuing coaching courses at different levels while they were still playing.\n“Our policy is to help nurture their coaching skills through training and hands on experience within our technical structures.\nBullets’ 2024 technical panel announcement comes a fortnight after their arch-rivals Mighty Mukuru Wanderers named theirs which has Nsanzurwimo Ramadhan as head coach.”",
