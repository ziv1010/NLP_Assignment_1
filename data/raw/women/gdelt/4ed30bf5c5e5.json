  "body_text": "If the thought of ripping your entire CD collection to MP3 makes you want to scrub the grout in your shower instead, send it off to Ripshark.\nAfter they ship you the packing materials to accomodate all your CDs , for reasonable rates (down to 69 cents a disc) they'll rip your entire collection to MP3 at whatever bitrate you'd like, to either DVD or a portable hard drive.\nSounds like a good way to hand off a tedious, time-consuming task and go to the park instead.",
