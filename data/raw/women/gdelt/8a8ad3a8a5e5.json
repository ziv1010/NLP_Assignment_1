  "body_text": "AUSTIN, Texas — The Austin Police Department (APD) held a press conference on Dec. 4 to share more details from their investigation into the death of 19-year-old Texas A&M student Brianna Aguilera.\nAguilera's death on the weekend following the Texas-Texas A&M football game has gained national attention.\nEditor's note: Details included in this article may be difficult for some to read.\nAPD said officers responded to reports of an unresponsive person at around 12:46 a.m. on Nov. 29, at the 21 Rio Apartments, located at 2101 Rio Grande St. in in West Campus. Aguilera was found on the ground near the complex, with trauma consistent with a fall. She was pronounced dead at 12:56 a.m.\nOn Dec. 1, Austin police said investigators do not believe foul play was involved and they are not investigating Aguilera’s death as a homicide. Police say witnesses have been cooperative and the apartment complex provided access to its internal security cameras, which helped establish a timeline of events leading up to Aguilera's death.\nTimeline of events\nDuring the Dec. 4 press conference, APD Lead Det. Robert Marshall outlined a timeline of the events that occurred on Nov. 28 and Nov. 29.\nFriday, Nov. 28\n4–10 p.m. – Aguilera attended a tailgate party at the Austin Rugby Club, arriving between 4 and 5 p.m. and leaving around 10 p.m. Witnesses said she appeared intoxicated and was asked to leave\n11 p.m. – Aguilera arrived at the 21 Rio apartment complex and was seen entering a unit\nSaturday, Nov. 29\n12:30 a.m. – Surveillance footage showed a large group leaving the apartment, leaving Aguilera and three other women inside\nWitnesses told police Aguilera borrowed a friend’s phone to call her out-of-town boyfriend, with whom she was heard arguing. Call logs confirmed the 1-minute call lasted from 12:43 a.m. to 12:44 a.m.\n12:46 a.m. – Officers responded to a 911 call and found Aguilera’s body\n6 a.m. – Detectives contacted an employee at 21 Rio Grande Apartments. Police say staff cooperated with the investigation\n10 a.m. – Investigators accessed security footage showing the hallway of the apartment\n12:14 p.m. – Friends called 911 to report Aguilera missing, unaware of her death\n12:50 p.m. – Aguilera’s mother, Stephanie Rodriguez, contacted police to help locate her daughter\n2 p.m. – Rodriguez informed police Aguilera’s phone had been located\n3:30 p.m. – Officers found Aguilera's phone in a wooded area near Walnut Creek, by the Austin Rugby Club\nOn Dec. 1, APD said Aguilera’s parents met with police victim services staff and turned over her phone. Investigators later found a deleted digital suicide note dated Nov. 25.\nPolice also said Aguilera had made suicidal statements to friends in October and showed indications of suicidal ideation in her phone activity before her death.\n\"I understand how grief and the need for answers can raise intense emotions and many questions. But sometimes, sometimes, the truth doesn't provide the answers we are hoping for and that is this case,\" APD Chief Lisa Davis said at the Thursday press conference.\nDavis said it is not common for APD to speak about deaths by suicide, but inaccurate information has circulated about Aguilera's death, leading to additional harm to innocent people.\nAguilera's family has hired prominent Houston attorney Tony Buzbee to take on their case. APD said it is working around the clock on the investigation.\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with mental health, call or text 988 anytime to connect with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline for free, confidential support.
