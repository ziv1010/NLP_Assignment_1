  "body_text": "Senior outside hitter Natalie Monroe, a four-year starter committed to UNLV, had a career night, and that paid dividends for Santa Cruz High’s girls volleyball team.\nMonroe made a career-high 28 kills to go along with 12 digs, and the No. 2 seed Cardinals swept No. 4 Aptos 25-22, 25-20, 25-17 in the Santa Cruz Coast Athletic League Tournament championship at Cabrillo College on Wednesday night.\n“It’s pretty big,” said first-year Cardinals coach Jordan Kirchner, of entering the upcoming Central Coast Section playoffs on a hot streak. “We’re on a positive incline. It’s a positive push.”\nKirchner, 26, a former UC Santa Cruz player who hails from Rancho Cucamonga, is a fourth-grade teacher at Gateway School. She had only coached middle school volleyball before this season.\n“This is my first year as coach; it doesn’t even feel real,” Kirchner said. “It has been an honor to be a part of their experience.”\nKirchner praised the Cardinals (19-10 overall) for banding together under new leadership. She’s the program’s third head coach in the past four years.\n“We had a big culture shift,” Kirchner said. “That was my main focus. We wanted the girls to support each other, play for every point, and play for each other. … I wanted them to feel like it was our privilege to be there, and, tonight, we took care of business. Tonight was recognition for the growth we’ve had.”\nThe Cardinals lost junior setter Colette Huynh to an ACL injury midway through league, which forced the team to swap its 6-2, two-setter system in favor of a 5-1. Sophomore setter Irie Butler continued to thrive while keeping the offense flowing. She finished with a whopping 42 assists.\nSophomore outside Haisley Flanagan also turned in another big match. She set the tone early at the service line and finished with 14 kills and 11 digs.\n“Her serving pressure was amazing, and having Natalie in the front row is pretty lethal,” Kirchner said.\nSenior libero Lovela Jones made a career-high 17 digs for Santa Cruz and junior defensive specialist Maggie Redwine had eight digs.\nAptos dropped to 0-3 against the Cardinals this season.\n“We came up a little short against a very in-rhythm Santa Cruz team that we haven’t quite cracked the code on this season,” said Mariners coach Hunter Zeng. “I’m proud of what it took to get to tonight’s stage. We had the toughest road with three back-to-back matches and our win over Scotts Valley late last night (Tuesday) was not freely given.”\nOutside hitter Ella Dueck, a junior who is committed to play beach volleyball at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, had 15 kills, eight digs, and two aces to lead the Mariners (19-12).\nSenior outside hitter Kenzie Smith made eight kills and nine digs for Aptos, and sophomore middle blocker Caitlin Lavelle had six kills, two aces, and two blocks. Junior setter Mady Reed made 13 assists, two aces, and three digs, and freshman setter Cana Taylor made 11 assists.\nZeng gave kudos to the Cardinals on their win and thanked fans for creating a fun, supportive environment.\n“While our block-defense system needs a little work, we lost to pretty quality play from the Cardinals,” Zeng said. “Natalie Monroe played championship caliber volleyball with quality setting from Irie Butler, followed by solid backcourt defense from Haisley Flanagan.”\nBoth teams look to continue their late-season momentum in the CCS playoffs. The seeding meeting takes place Thursday at noon. First-round action begins Saturday.\nSt. Francis 3, at Pajaro Valley 1: Senior outside hitter Peyton Orradre made 21 kills and 24 digs, and the Sharks beat the Grizzlies 25-21, 24-26, 25-16, 25-15 to earn a share of the Pacific Coast Athletic League’s Cypress Division title on Wednesday.\nThe Sharks (19-7, 12-2) share the crown with Rancho San Juan (21-5, 12-2), which swept Seaside in its finale Wednesday.\nIt’s the first league title for the Sharks, who have just one other title in the sport in school history. The Sharks won the CCS Division V title in 2008 after taking third in the eight-team SCCAL.\n“This was by far our biggest game of the year and we came out on top to win league,” Sharks coach Sabrina Bracken said. “This is the first time, ever, St. Francis’ girls varsity volleyball has won league, so this was a big deal for us.”\nSenior setter Georgia Otzman made 41 assists and 18 digs for the Sharks. Senior outside hitter Julie Lopez had 15 kills and 18 digs, and junior middle blocker Ella Dewig had seven kills and four blocks.\nBracken was a junior on the Sharks’ section championship team.\n“It’s the cherry on top for me to be part of both teams who got the only banners at St. Francis — once as a player and now as a coach,” she said.\nSt. Francis went 7-7 in league a year ago and made tremendous strides this season.\n“This year, we ended being 12-2,” Bracken said. “That’s a huge achievement. I couldn’t be more proud of the girls for their determination and mental toughness.”\nBracken anticipates that the Sharks will host a first-round CCS match Saturday night.\nSalinas 3, at Monte Vista Christian 0: Charlotte Johnson made eight kills, and the balanced Cowboys swept the Mustangs 25-16, 25-18, 25-20 to complete PCAL Gabilan Division play unbeaten on Wednesday.\nThe Cowboys (21-5) went 14-0 in division play. MVC (8-21, 2-12) finished tied with Santa Catalina (6-13, 2-12) for seventh place.\nWomen’s volleyball\nCabrillo 3, at De Anza 0: The No. 23 state-ranked Seahawks posted their 13th sweep of the season, 25-15, 25-16, 25-19, on Wednesday to snap a two-match losing skid in Coast Conference North Division action.\nCabrillo (17-4, 3-2) plays at Las Positas (14-7, 1-4) in Livermore on Friday at 3 p.m.\nFlag football\nScotts Valley 19, at Santa Cruz 13, 3 OT: The Falcons slipped past the Cardinals in three overtimes in the teams’ SCCAL finale at Santa Cruz High on Wednesday night.\nLyla Rebbert caught the game-winning touchdown on a pass from quarterback Jazzy Phillips.\nRebbert also had a touchdown reception in the first quarter. Sammy Rebbert scored a touchdown in the second quarter.\nScotts Valley was led on defense by Presley Pastrell, who recorded her fifth interception of the season and made 15 flag pulls.\nAptos 13, Soquel 6: Senior quarterback Ella Porter rushed and passed for touchdowns to help the repeat SCCAL champion Mariners rally past the Knights in their regular-season finale at Santa Cruz High on Wednesday night.\nThe Knights led 6-0 at the half.\n“What has impressed me the most about these athletes is their mental development,” said Mariners coach Denise Russo. “They have learned not to give up, that even if you make a mistake, or you get behind, you just have to go out on the next play and execute. That mental edge combined with hard work and their camaraderie is what you expect from a champion team.”\nPorter scored on a 2-yard run and added a PAT run to take a 7-6 lead in the third quarter. She completed a 28-yard touchdown pass to junior Ellie Marta with four minutes remaining.\nPorter sealed the win by making an interception on defense, one of three by the Mariners. Elenah Esquivel and Marta also had picks.\nMarta and freshman Ella Jacobs each finished with six tackles, and Esquivel made four stops. Sophomore Mary-Anne McCarthy recorded three sacks, and classmate Julia Parello had a sack and two hurries.\nHarbor 7, SLV 6: The Pirates beat the short-handed Cougars in the teams’ SCCAL finale, which ended prematurely at Santa Cruz High, on Wednesday.\nSLV’s Amaya Moore hauled in a touchdown pass from Savanna Robertson in the first quarter.\nUnfortunately for the Cougars, the game was called after they lost a player to injury, leaving them with just four players.\nCougars coach Shannon Pichler thanked Harbor for lending them a player after game officials declined to wait for a replacement to arrive. The game was called early.\n“Tough way to end the season, but I am so proud of the resilience and the heart the SLV girls have had all season despite the low turnout,” Pichler said. “I am hoping we can bring more awareness to the community to build a bigger program next year.”\nMen’s soccer\nAt William Jessup 1, UC Santa Cruz 0: The NCAA Division III Banana Slugs were shut out by the D-II Warriors in their match in Rocklin on Wednesday.\nAidan Vangelatos scored the winning goal for the Warriors (2-8-4) on a pass from Justin Parrish in the 65th minute.\nGoalie Tobias Jacobson-Bell made one save for the Banana Slugs. Alonso Ruiz made three saves for the Warriors.\nUCSC (8-6-1) hosts NAIA program California Maritime Academy (1-11-0) in its regular-season finale on Sunday at 1 p.m.\nWomen’s soccer\nAt Fresno Pacific 3, UCSC 1: Camille Anneet scored her fourth goal of the season on a pass from Sydney Boyd in the 89th minute to help the D-III Banana Slugs avoid being shut out by the D-II Sunbirds on Wednesday.\nThe Sunbirds (2-7-5) scored twice in a two-minute span in the first half on goals from Mackenzie Madron in the 17th minute and Gizelle Aguirre in the 19th minute, and made it 3-0 on Bailey Roberson’s tally in the 46th minute.\nGoalie Ainsley Gove made two saves over 77 minutes before giving way to Katelyn Beaman, who didn’t face a shot on goal. Katelyn Gonzalez and Ayana Kirisimasi each made two saves for the Sunbirds.\nIt was the regular-season finale for UCSC (4-7-2), which next competes in the Coast-To-Coast Conference Tournament in Salisbury, Maryland, on Nov. 6-9.\nReporting Scores\nCoaches are encouraged to report scores and highlights to sports@santacruzsentinel.com following games.
