Council spends your money over the next 12 months will be decided in a vote at full council on Thursday, February 12.\nThe Green-led authority has proposed a £634million budget from April on day-to-day spending, such as road repairs, libraries, bin collections, and street lighting, partly funded by a 4.99 per cent increase in council tax.\nA further £232million would be invested in long-term infrastructure like new schools, houses and bridges, plus £180million on council homes from tenants’ rent, and £583million from the government for education.\nBut each year at budget full council, all party groups in the chamber can submit their own ideas on spending priorities, called amendments.\nThese must pay for themselves by being cost-neutral to maintain an overall balanced budget, so any new outgoings or investments must be funded by the same amount of cash raised, borrowed or saved by fresh cuts to pay for them.\nThe Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have put forward theirs.\nThis is what Labour would do with your money.\nThe first of the opposition group’s five amendments earmarks £1.7million for three new community hubs in deprived areas and a grant programme for community facilities.\nThese include refurbishing Avon Youth Hub, serving Avonmouth & Lawrence Weston ward, and Eagle House in Knowle West.\nThe former Tenants Hall site, in Barton Hill, was demolished in 2024 with plans to replace it with community-led housing and a community centre, and Labour ’s plans would see the council cover a £368,000 shortfall.\nThese would be paid for by borrowing money and repaying it over 25 years, which in turn would be funded by a cut to staffing support for policy committee chairs.\nOutlining the implications, finance officers wrote in budget papers: “The policy chair support is essential for ensuring an appropriate level of support to policy committee chairs.\n“The proposed withdrawal of this support will mean that policy committee chairs are not supported with their leadership roles, including diary co-ordination, correspondence, the decision pathway, managing external relationships and inquiries relating to their areas of responsibility.”\nBut they said how the set of proposals would be financed was “considered to be reasonable” and within borrowing limits.\nPublic health and communities committee vice-chair Cllr Emily Clarke (Labour, Bedminster ) said: “Avonmouth, Knowle West, and Lawrence Hill are some of Bristol’s most deprived communities.\n“Local people tell us how badly they need more community spaces and youth facilities.\n“The Labour group has put forward a fully funded plan to refurbish Avon Youth Club to turn it into a multi-agency youth hub, renovate the former Eagle House Youth Club, and replace Tenants Hall site with community-led housing and community space.\n“Other community organisations need investment, so we’re also proposing a new grants system.\n“This could help them maintain and upgrade their properties, retrofit them so they’re more climate-friendly, or even host one-off events like a World Cup party.\n“All this will come at a small cost – not employing any more staff to manage the Green Party and Liberal Democrat councillors’ diaries.\n“The cost of the committee system already far outweighs the cost of the mayoral system.\n“The public was promised a cheaper system – it’s time to get a grip of the spiralling costs.”\nLabour’s Filwood ward councillors Rob Logan and Lisa Durston added: “The Green Party promised to return the former Eagle House Youth Club to community use within six months of taking office.\n“They’ve not only refused to do that, they’re now refusing to carry out the renovation works it needs, meaning that a vital community building will be empty and could even be demolished.\n“We’ve been holding them to account for this promise – we’re giving the administration yet another chance to stick to their word.”\nLabour’s second amendment\nAbout £8million of funding for the seemingly now-doomed plans to ban through-traffic on Park Street would be redirected to other transport improvements such as fixing potholes and unblocking drains.\nCouncillors from the other three parties on the council out-voted the ruling Greens on the transport committee on Thursday, February 5, to scrap the idea.\nThat came after West of England metro mayor Helen Godwin, who holds the purse strings at the region’s combined authority, announced she would not back the proposals for Park Street because of the potential impact on air quality by vehicles being diverted past the city centre hospitals.\nSpeaking about the budget amendment, Labour transport lead Cllr Tim Rippington ( Brislington East) said the money could be spread across the city.\nHe said: “We can commission a number of new bus routes or other interventions such as improved frequencies; unblock every drain in the city, audit them, and put in measures to mitigate flooding in future; triple the road-marking repainting budget; install solar lights on dark active travel routes; replace bus stops that have been removed; and fill more potholes.\n“When you weigh up the opportunity cost of our proposal against the Greens’, there’s a clear winner.”\nLabour’s third amendment would reallocate £900,000 of developer contributions, called Strategic Community Infrastructure Levy (SCIL), away from a proposed new pontoon at Cascade Steps at the top of the Floating Harbour to pay for refurbishing the Downs football changing rooms.\nCllr Kye Dudd (Labour, Southmead ) said: “The Downs changing rooms are falling apart.\n“Failing to invest in it puts the historic league’s future at risk.\n“It’s not fit for purpose, and the longer the Greens refuse to do the right thing, the more expensive it will be to fix it.\n“When I brought forward a plan to refurbish the Downs last year, the Greens voted it down, promising to bring back a new democratic process for allocating SCIL receipts.\n“They haven’t followed up on this promise.\n“They’ve allocated £900,000 towards a project without the committee voting on it.\n“There’s a huge democratic deficit here.\n“Anyone with an interest in local democracy should be outraged that their council tax is being allotted to projects without their local representatives having a say.\n“We’re also proposing a grant programme for grassroots projects to improve participation in sport.\n“Playing sport supports physical and mental wellbeing, it helps people form social bonds and brings communities together.\n“The more the council can do to promote it, the better.”\nIn budget papers, finance officers said that if the Cascade Steps landing stage was not delivered this year “there is a high likelihood that the entirety of the decked area would be closed off due to being unsafe to access”.\nThey said: “This would prevent this being used as a ferry landing.\n“Closure would negatively impact businesses that rely on the landing stage for operation.\n“The high-profile visitor destination feature being closed off pending an unknown repair time would cause reputational damage.”\nBut officers said investing in the Downs changing rooms supported public health priorities by increasing access to safe, quality community sport facilities.\nThey said: “Facility improvements, particularly those that better serve women and girls, disabled people and communities with lower levels of activity, aligns with our strategic commitment of creating healthier, more active neighbourhoods.\n“This proposal strengthens the city’s ability to deliver inclusive, community-based opportunities that improve health, mental wellbeing, social connections and community cohesion.”\nLabour’s fourth amendment would extend library opening hours and provide more council-owned children’s homes in the authority’s housing company Goram Homes’ properties.\nThis would be funded by cutting member extra pay by merging two policy committees with relatively little business to discuss, assigning the organisation’s deputy leader a specific role, equivalent to the former deputy mayors’ cabinet responsibilities, and reducing the number of top directors whose pay, Labour says, has nearly doubled since the Greens came to power.\nLabour group leader Cllr Tom Renhard ( Horfield ) said: “Since the Greens have taken office, executive pay has sky-rocketed – almost doubling since May 2024.\n“A relatively small senior management restructure could give our youth services a £200,000-a-year boost.\n“Merging two policy committees and requiring the deputy leader of the council to have a specific job would free up some more cash, which would also be invested in our youth services.\n“Politics is about choices, and I am clear on what should be more of a priority here.\n“By buying more council-owned children’s homes, we can save the taxpayer thousands and provide a better service for in-care children, freeing up yet more funding to extend our libraries’ opening hours.”\nLabour said the average weekly running costs for internal children’s homes were about £4,000 per child, compared with £7,000 for external providers.\nBut finance officers assessing the proposals said in their report: “Given the council is already increasing the number of internal children’s homes places it is questionable whether purchasing additional places would be good value for money and therefore whether these savings would be realised.\n“However, the targeted saving of £420,000 seems to assume that between two and three children would transfer between provision which, given 10-15 places would be created, is prudent.”\nThey said the proposed extension in library opening hours would provide an additional 160 staffed hours a week for branches with two staff – equal to six hours per location for all 26 libraries.\n“It could also be used to create a hybrid model with additional extended access libraries and more staffed hours,” officers added.\nLabour’s final amendment removes £800,000 to complete the full business case for the Southville and Windmill Hill sections of the controversial South Bristol Liveable Neighbourhood.\nModal filters – roadblocks – would be scrapped while allowing long-held plans for match-day parking near Ashton Gate to go ahead, along with traffic-calming measures such as segregated cycle lanes in BS3.\nCllr Rippington said: “Bristol has often been criticised as a city which consults its citizens but then doesn’t listen to the results.\n“Residents in Southville have made it clear that, even where they are keen cyclists or frequent walkers, they do not support the plans to segment their area and make it more difficult to move around when they need to use a car.\n“We think the council needs to listen to these concerns, which is why we ensured that the recent petition was debated at the transport committee at the earliest opportunity.\n“Following this debate, and having listened to local residents, we are calling on the council to drop the plans to close off roads and use the money instead to fund measures which will improve the area whilst not breaking it up into silos.”",
