  "body_text": "David Parker speech – Piketty, Inequality and Climate Change\nConspicuous consumption amongst the super wealthy undoubtedly shows the world\nthat, in general, those with the most pollute the most.\nPrivate jets produce 10 times as much greenhouse gas as a commercial airline\npassenger.\nSuper yachts are even worse. The mega yachts of the mega rich are longer than\nfootball fields.\nEven the newly launched hydrogen fuel cell super yacht – called project 821 – pumps\nout the greenhouse gas pollution.\nDespite costing a whopping 600 million euros, it still can’t carry enough hydrogen to\npower its 119m hull across the ocean on its fuel cells, and so uses fossil fuels for\nvoyages. Its green-hydrogen fuel cells do power what are called “hotel” functions .\nIt is said the R&D from the project will flow through to Norwegian ferries, but given\nwe already have the first hydrogen fuel cell ferries operating elsewhere, I’m not\nconvinced a super yacht was a necessary development pathway.\nPerhaps the most extreme example is private space travel.\nAnd with billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos privatising space, blasting ever\nmore frequently through the stratosphere, the effects on climate are becoming more\nsignificant.\nPiketty makes the more fundamental point that some of that huge amount of wealth\nconcentrated at the very top of wealth holders needs to be redeployed to help\ncivilisation avoid catastrophic runaway climate change.\nHe has two main reasons for this view. One is about money. The transition to lower\nemissions costs more than the status quo. It doesn’t always cost more, but\nsometimes it does. And when it does, the money has to come from somewhere.\nA real example is the cost of a battery electric vehicle cf a petrol or diesel car. The\nprice is converging, but is still apart.\nPrices matter – after the clean car discount was cancelled by the incoming\ngovernment, the proportion of new petrol and diesel light vehicle imports increased\nmassively from 42% in November 2023, to 60% in May 2024. The proportion of\nhybrids, plug in hybrids and battery electric vehicles plunged from 58% – more than\nhalf – to 40%.\nIf, for arguments sake, the difference between the whole of life cost – including fuel –\nfor a battery electric vehicle was $10,000 more than a petrol one, then the 600\nmillion euros spent on that one super yacht – a billion New Zealand dollars – could\ninstead pay for that difference for 100,000 cars.\nOne more super yacht or 100,000 fewer petrol cars – which is better for the planet?\nYes, some are philanthropists, albeit on average at levels that are less than even\nmodest tax rates.\nAnd, yes some invest in the weightless economy, and others are striving to green\nenergy systems.\nNonetheless it remains true that the consumption patterns of the very wealthy often\ndrive higher emissions.\nIt is also true that globalisation has lifted a billion people out of poverty and reduced\nthe gap between rich and other countries, but substantial inter-country disparities\nremain.\nAnd we know that, internationally, if developing countries take the fossil fuel intensive\npath to development, we all fry.\nIt is a shame that the clean development mechanism in the Kyoto protocol did not\nsurvive, because that provided a rational way to help the world reduce emissions\ncost effectively. In New Zealand, our ETS linked to the clean development\nmechanism until the Kyoto protocol failed, after the USA did not ratify Kyoto. While\nthe CDM had implementation flaws in its early years, those were fixable.\nInternational aid and climate finance, while very important, are an inferior alternative\nfor reducing emissions in other countries. Inferior, because they do not mobilise as\nmuch capital.\nPiketty’s other, perhaps more important, point is that increasing inequality within\ncountries also undermines societal support for the changes needed to clean up the\nmeans of production and to green our consumption choices.\nThis should not be a surprise, because it is a subset of a wider truth. Increasing\ninequality takes societies backwards not forwards.\nBefore diving into some detail I’m going to put up two general slides – the first simply\nshows NZ is average for taxes cf other OECD countries.\nTaxes affect the shape of the economy.\nGross inequality adversely impacts both the shape of the economy and many social\noutcomes.\nThe economic effects include more speculation rather than productive investment. It\nis one of many factors behind asset price inflation for land-based assets. Paintings\nand rare cars are another example, where eye watering prices are paid by the\nsuperrich as they outbid each other.\nGet the shape of taxes wrong and productive investment drops.\nLook at this graph for New Zealand of new capital formation over time as case in\npoint.\nThe anti-social effects of high inequality are clearer still.\nI don’t have time today to rehearse the voluminous evidence in support of this. Many\nothers have. I’ll mention two.\nThe Spirit Level by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett described how more equal\nsocieties almost always do better. It presented data showing that once a country\nescapes absolute poverty, relative inequality within a country drives physical ill-\nhealth, mental illness, obesity, violence, drug abuse, big prison populations, lower\nhome ownership, and distrust.\nAnd Tony Judt’s, Ill Fares the Land. A pithy book, whose title was drawn from a poem\npenned by Oliver Goldsmith in the mid 1700s. “Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a\nprey, where wealth accumulates and men decay.”\nI know the language is old fashioned, and that men means and men and women. But\na decade and a half after Judt critiqued the paradoxical resurgence of unfettered\ncapitalism after the GFC, that sentence still sends a chill down my spine.\n“Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey, where wealth accumulates and men\ndecay.”\nIt captures a raw emotional truth.\nI lament that since that book was written inequality within countries has got worse.\nLower income people in New Zealand and elsewhere have long lived close to the\nedge. What has changed is that the middle is ever more pressured.\nOver the last decade, attention has moved from income inequality to the resultant\nwealth disparities.\nWealth inequality piles up year upon year. Just as the investments of the super\nwealthy compound in value, so too does wealth inequality.\nDonald Trump may not have drained the swamp, but he did speak to a disaffected\nmiddle class.\nThis is deeply ironic, given that he features in Peter Goodman’s Davos Man – How\nthe billionaires devoured the world. That book described tax data leaked in the USA.\n“The details affirmed the audacity of the undertaking. In both 2007 and 2011 Jeff\nBezos paid zero in federal taxes. Others who achieved that distinction included Elon\nMusk, Geoge Soros and Michael Bloomfield”\nIn this age of misinformation, allied with the disproportionate influence of the wealthy\nlike Rupert Murdoch, it can be hard to move the dial.\nSurrogate organisations describe tax as theft – unless it’s paid by someone else to\nprotect their property rights.\nEquality of opportunity is redefined to exclude social mobility. When it comes to\nsharing the fruits of our economy, inherited privilege dominates over working and\nsaving. I’m not talking just a few mil each, but sometimes hundreds of, even billions\nof dollars.\nIt’s easy to drop into the cynicism redolent in the phrase some attribute to Mark\nTwain ‘Lies, damned lies and statistics’, and so it can be hard to break through the\npower of the status quo.\nBut sometimes someone breaks through. And in my view that accolade deservedly\ngoes to Thomas Piketty.\nWhat a treasure to read. Romantic literature, the belle epoque, the great depression,\nthe effect of wars, and post war policies that made a difference, and their demise,\nand the consequences we now bear witness to.\nThe sweep of history augmented by recent data. Genius. He proved the math. And\npeople know that maths does not lie.\nR > G.\nI’ll come back to that.\nIn New Zealand, we tested the validity of Piketty’s findings for New Zealand with a\ndetailed study based on actual data. Not models based on population wide surveys\nwhich are necessarily simplistic. Actual data.\nThis was born of the limitations of the Household Economic survey conducted by\nstats NZ at the top end – as Piketty described. General surveys seldom encounter\nthe very wealthy. Their questions are necessarily simple to enable ordinary folk to\ncomplete the survey, which then means the complex investment entities of the very\nwealthy are not well covered. There are other reasons too, which I don’t have time to\ndetail here.\nBack then only 1 participant in the household economic survey had reported more\nthan $20m wealth. That person had $30m. Three years on and the latest I heard was\nthe survey has covered two 2 such people. This, in a country with billionaires. It\nshows the HES was and is pretty much useless at the top end.\nWe changed the law to allow CIR to collect information for policy puposes, not just\ntax administration purposes. This was modelled on UK law. Until then tax\nintermediaries, who ordinarily owe a duty of confidence to the taxpayer, could refuse\nto provide information.\n$5m was allocated in the budget to carry out the complex work.\nData was sought for 350 high wealth individuals – this included their life partner,\ndependent children, and trusts where they controlled distribution or the appointment\nof trustees.\nThe information gathered could only be used for the study, not tax enforcement. High\nlevels of compliance resulted.\nIn practice the information generally came from their tax intermediary – accountants\nor lawyers\nAn expert reference panel and OECD advice guided analysis.\nThe data collected established the network of legal entities each HWI invests\nthrough – often this is very complex with multiple trusts, partnerships, and hundreds\nof public and private company shareholdings.\nIRD had in depth information for just about all of these – the complexity arose from\nputting the puzzle together. Which net assets, income and tax paid should be\nattributed to whom.\nThe median wealth of those in the HWI study was $106m and average was $267m\neach. Massive – an average of $267 m after the deduction of all debts.\nWhat are their sources of income?\n93% is from investments.\nOf course, the HWI are the most successful investors in New Zealand. They can buy\nthe best of advice, they are long term professional investors, they are well connected\nand can invest in projects unavailable to others, they have the ability to leverage\nassets, to spread risk, and to minimise tax.\nBefore describing the results for IRD study of the high wealth group, I’ll cover the\ncompanion work carried out by the Treasury on the 90% plus of the population the\ngovernment already had good information on from the HES survey and other\nsources.\nThis too was a big piece of high-quality work carried out by officials, published\nacross a number of Treasury working papers.\nNew Zealand has a progressive income tax rate which applies to what is defined as\ntaxable income.\nA lot of people who talk about tax focus on income tax rates. This is only part of the\nstory.\nGST is a big part of the NZ system, and therefor is a big part of the tax most Kiwis\npay.\nA lot of people who talk about tax focus on marginal taxable income tax rates. But\nthat is only part of the picture.\nThe GST slice of the pie changes a bit over time, but in all years is a lot higher in\nNew Zealand c.f. OECD generally.\nNZ has a very broad GST. It covers just about all goods and services. Groceries,\nelectricity, clothes, appliances, repairs etc.\nWhat doesn’t include GST? Rent, mortgage payments and savings.\nMost people spend about 2/3 of their income on GST inclusive goods and services.\nThe GST rate is 15%.\n2/3 income times 15% GST = about 10% of income being spent on GST.\nDecile 1 is not shown on the graph because tax losses of some taxpayers render it\nunsuitable for direct comparison. But extrapolating from the second decile we know\nthat low-income people on average pay 10 or 11% of their income on GST.\nGST as a percentage of income is moderately regressive in deciles 1 to 9. Decile 9\nspend about 7% of their income on GST (over and above their income tax).\nAt the top decile the average is misleading for a different reason – it drops sharply at\nthe top, and the average obscures that.\nI will return later to why GST outcomes are more significant than most people\nrealise.\nGoing back to the general population, the income system is augmented by transfer\npayments – benefits and the like, and these have to be considered. The statutory\ndefinition of taxable income also excludes significant sources of income like capital\ngains. All these different aspects of income were factored in to examples to enable a\nfair comparison of the effective average tax rates paid by low and middle income\nNew Zealanders c.f. those in the HWI study.\nYou won’t be able to see the details of this, but it shows how our system is\nprogressive at the lower end.\nTransfer payments and tax credits normally phase out at about $80,000 to $100,000\ndepending upon the number of children.\nMyriad examples were calculated – high and low salaries and wages, with and\nwithout transfer payments, home ownership, renting, rental properties, Kiwisaver.\nEach different scenario divided the population into 20 subsets of 5% (a 5% subset is\na ventile). This was done by both income and wealth.\nThe tables were prepared before the 38% tax rate on the part of taxable incomes\nover $180,000, and so it understates effective tax rates for high salary earners.\nA middle-income salary or wage earner pays an average effective income tax rate of\n22 or 25%. Some higher.\nPlus GST at about 8 or 9 % as we’ve already discussed.\nThat’s a total effective tax rate of 30 to 34% on all of their income, including income\nfrom capital.\nFor some the total is higher.\nSo, in comparison what were the results for those in the HWI study?\nThe high wealth individuals pay much less.\nTheir income tax averaged under 9% of their income\nAnd their expenditure GST averaged under 1% of their income.\nThat’s a total of under 10%\nThat is 1/3 of the rate of tax paid by the middle class and less than half what is paid\nby a low-wage single person.\nRemember it’s 93% investment returns.\nThere was another interesting discovery from the study.\nThe larger the proportion of a company owned by a HWI, the lower the ostensible\nrate of taxable income and tax.\nHow can that be? These are the best investors in the country.\nIt is evidence of structuring of investment portfolios for tax minimisation purposes.\nSensitivity analysis was done to compare the last economic cycle with earlier ones,\nand the outcomes were not all that different.\nWe have proof that most income of the HWI is reinvested because fortunes and\nincomes are so large they cannot be spent. Most are careful with money, and it’s\nhard to spend that much income.\nThis showed up in the GST analysis I spoke of earlier.\nOnce you have a house, and holiday home and a few cars and a boat, imagine trying\nto spend $20k per week in the subsequent years.\nYou’d have to be full time on the supermarket trolley and do overtime at the mall. And\neven if you spent $20k per week, that totals “only” $1m per year.\nIf your income is $10m, you are only spending a tenth of your income on GST\ninclusive goods and services, and your GST is 1.5% of your income.\nIf your income is $100m, your GST would be 0.15% of your income.\nRemember that for most New Zealanders GST is about 8 or 9% of theirs.\nSo, if you’re not spending most of your income, what happens to it? It is reinvested,\neither by way of retained earnings or investments in other entities.\nPiketty was right.\nR is > G\nWhat does this mean? Why is it important?\nR – is the rate of return on large pools of capital, after inflation and tax.\nG – the economic growth rate within countries.\nThose returns on large pools of capital are largely reinvested, rather than spent.\nAnd Piketty was right about what this means.\nWhen R – the rate of return on large pools of capital – is greater than G – the growth\nin the economy, the share of wealth at the top grows ever larger, and the share of\nwealth held by the rest of society decreases.\nDitto the income from that wealth. The same thing happens.\nThe transfer of wealth to the very top is compounding.\nThe maths is irrefutable.\nThis conclusion is grounded in data, not general surveys or models. Actual data.\nMore and more of this is sitting in trusts. For the first time we have decent data on\nthis too, because we also changed the law to require disclosures by trusts\nOver $450 billion plus of wealth is now sitting in trusts – intergenerational asset\nholding vehicles\nPiketty’s work led to what we now know.\nAs a result of the IRD and Treasury work, Treasury was able to better calculate the\nshare of wealth sitting at the top end. Turns out it was more than previously thought.\nThe top 1% of household now holds much more than 20% of all wealth in New\nZealand. The figure is 26% of all wealth when calculated according to the\ncapitalisation of returns method.\nEven this astounding 26% figure is probably an underestimate because, as the\nliterature suggests and the HWI study found, taxable profits and dividends are\nsuppressed for tax minimisation reasons. When this occurs, the valuation of assets\ncalculated on the basis of capitalisation of earnings understates the true value of\nassets held by the wealthy.\nThis includes owner occupied housing. If you think that in some ways owner\noccupied housing is different from other investments, as I do, then the share of other\nnet investments, wealth, held by the top 1% is much higher still.\nWhichever of these figures is used, the concentration of wealth within the 1% is high,\nand it is compounding. If that share keeps going up, whose share is going down?\nThere are only 100%.\nThe contrast is stark. The bottom 50% of households now hold just 6% of wealth.\nAlthough there is an age/ stage of life component here, the overall position is clear.\nThat 6% can’t go down much. The saying goes, you can’t get blood out of a stone.\nSo, it increasingly comes at the expense of the middle. Most of the people in this\nroom.\nPiketty’s work has enabled the world to better understand and highlight the raging\ninequality we now have at the top end.\nWhich is why I was pleased to accept this invitation today to your forum on Piketty\nand climate change.\nInequality is a serious problem. So is climate change. They are linked, and both must\nbe addressed.\nDavid Parker\nSeptember 2024",
