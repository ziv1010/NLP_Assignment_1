Last year the World Cup created a 92 per cent increase in visibility for women's sport. It generated 324 million dollars in decreased healthcare costs, all up it had a 1.3 billion dollar economic impact. It is brilliant but we have to capitalise it now, the World Cup was a start and we have to go on.\"\nIt follows a $200 million government support package announced for women's sport.\nIt's been pledged toward women's gear, facilities and a review of broadcasting rules to ensure major events are free to watch.\nTwo hundred million dollars will also be invested through the Play Our Way program to improve sporting facilities and equipment specifically for women and girls.\nChief Executive of Football Australia James Johnson says this $15 million will go towards tournament start up costs.\n\"The sport is growing by every metric, our participation is up 20 per cent across the country, we've got more revenue coming into the sport, which means we can reinvest back into the teams. We've invested more in the Socceroos and Matildas in the last four years than ever in our national team program and I think we're seeing the benefits of that on the pitch because we're seeing great results on the pitch.\"\nThe AFC Women's Asian Cup is one of the oldest international women's competitions in the world.\n2026 will mark its 50th anniversary by bringing 12 nations together in Australia.\nIt will be Australia's second time hosting the competition with matches set to take place in New South Wales, in Queensland and Western Australia.\nAlthough Matildas player Lydia Williams will look to end her career on a high before hanging up her international boots in Paris, she says it's clear women's football has grown rapidly in recent years.\n\"A home world cup, a home Asian cup is only something I would've dreamed of a long time ago I'm really excited to see where football is going in the country. To be putting ourselves on the map as one of the top teams not only in Asia but the world, I definitely think home Asian Cup is something we're excited for, the prospects of winning on home soil is a little bit extra.\"\nThe tournament has been predicted to inject $250 million into local economies, attract 24,000 international visitors to Australia, create more than 1,000 jobs and secure a global television audience of hundreds of millions.\nBut the biggest benefit is thought to be for the future generations, like young Matildas player Sasha Grove.\n\"It's really a testament to their hard work cause so many athletes the uplift the sport, and so I'm very lucky cause I'm a young player I'm really reaping the rewards that players before me has worked so hard for. It's certainly amazing to see in the future something as brilliant as a home Asian cup and it's something to aspire toward in the future.\"",
