  "body_text": "Lionesses head coach Sarina Wiegman and goalkeeper Hannah Hampton were both winners at the 2025 Ballon d’Or awards ceremony on Monday.\nWiegman was handed the Johan Cruyff Trophy – given to the best manager in women’s football – after England’s remarkable triumph at Euro 2025.\nHampton, meanwhile, was awarded the Yashin Trophy – cementing herself as the top goalkeeper in women’s football on the planet – a remarkable achievement for a player who was born with a serious eye condition as she paid tribute to late former Liverpool boss Matt Beard in her speech.\nWiegman received the Johan Cruyff Trophy from Dutch icon Ruud Gullit, who urged her to return as head coach of the Netherlands, but she said she was staying put at England before delivering a speech to the crowd.\n‘What an honour to get this award after a very special summer, and even more of an insane tournament we had at the Euros in Switzerland,’ Wiegman said.\n‘First of all I would like to thank the players, the staff, the FA and my family for the hard work, the trust and the unconditional support. Without you I would not be standing here.\n‘The women’s game has grown so far we have broken records. I would also like to thank Switzerland for organising the Euros because it was absolutely insane.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories? Metro's exclusive football newsletter, In The Mixer, is your essential guide.\nFrom the latest transfer rumours and managerial moves to analysis of the biggest games and a lot more, our experts have you covered.\nSign up here, it's an open goal.\n‘This is not just a personal honour. I see it as a recognition of the women’s game, of our journey and where we have come so far. With that recognition we have to take responsibility and try to keep our identity.\n‘Being authentic, being inclusive, a place where everyone belongs. I hope we will keep fighting together against misogyny and racism. Sport should always unite and never divide.\n‘This award means even more because it is named after Johan Cruyff. He believed in the power of sport and believed in every kid having the opportunity to play, to grow and to belong, and that is why I feel so connected with him.\n‘I would like to say let’s keep moving forward, keep uniting our beautiful game and enjoying our beautiful game too.\n‘Let’s celebrate our successes too. And if Burna Boy’s around, let’s do some dancing too!’\nHampton, meanwhile, paying tribute to the late Beard, added: ‘The women’s game sadly on Saturday lost a real trailblazer, Matt Beard.\n‘Matt was someone who cared an awful lot for the women’s game when no one else did. He lit up the room when everyone was in it.\n‘And this is just a message to show that not everyone should have to go through these dark moments alone.\n‘Sometimes the brightest smiles in the room hide the heaviest pain. He’ll be greatly missed.’\nHampton, who plays her club football for Chelsea, then said: ‘I stand on the shoulders of so many great goalkeepers of the past.\n‘Sitting alongside my fellow nominees, I’m proud to be a part of such an incredible group and inspiring future generations of goalkeepers coming through and training so hard.\nMore Trending\n‘I’d like to thank my family, my brother who is here tonight, for the sacrifices that you made when I was growing up, driving me around everywhere so that I could fulfil my dream and be here tonight.\n‘To all the coaches, there’s so many, from Frosty at Stoke, to all the coaches at Birmingham, all those at Villa, at Chelsea with Emma and Strew bringing me in, and now with Seb, Dan and Sonia having to put up with me on a daily basis.\n‘To Sarina and Dan for having the faith in me over the summer, with the success we’ve had. To the fans, your support does not go unnoticed and it truly means a lot.\n‘Finally, to Grandpa. I love and miss you everyday. I hope I made you proud. We did it.’\nMORE: Lamine Yamal’s father blasts Ousmane Dembele’s Ballon d’Or triumph in emotional rant\nMORE: Ballon d’Or 2025 full rankings: Ousmane Dembele and Aitana Bonmati land top prizes\nMORE: Why Ballon d’Or favourite Ousmane Dembele might not attend tonight’s ceremony",
