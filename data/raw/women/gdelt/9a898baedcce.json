He’s finally ready to leave the criminal world behind to open a diner with his wife, Alice (Christina Ricci), but his \"one last job\" goes very wrong. Now, with his plans ruined and the mob after him once more, Ray has to figure out a way to protect his family while navigating his exit from the criminal underworld for good — while doing a little bumbling around, of course.\nPremieres December 1 on Paramount Plus\n'Predators'\nDirector David Osit turns his lens on one of reality TV's most controversial series in \"Predators\". This provocative documentary takes a deep dive into an investigation of Dateline’s iconic \"To Catch a Predator,\" exploring some of the show’s complicated and often disturbing methods. It questions how things got done, the show's impact, and the cultural changes from the series that ended up inspiring vigilante justice and beyond.\nPremieres December 8 on Paramount Plus\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\n'Little Disasters'\nDiane Kruger and Jo Joyner star in this psychological drama adapted from Sarah Vaughan’s bestseller.
