(Xinhua/Zheng Huansong)\nEder, who has traveled frequently to China for FISU competitions, recalled his first visit in 1985.\n\"I could see the development of sports in many cities I have visited. It demonstrates that this state program has helped to develop sport all over China. This development is going fast, and I believe it will not stop in the future,\" said the Swiss official.\nEder highlighted the strong government support for university sports, noting the successful hosting of previous FISU events in China.\n\"I'm sure more events will come in the near future. This has demonstrated the value China places on university sports. This is a legacy which will go on, and I'm looking forward to the next events,\" Eder said.\n\"We have a contract for four editions of the University World Cup Football [to be held in China]. This is the third one, and one more will come in the future,\" he added.\nEder also emphasized that university sports should go beyond competition.\n\"The motto of FISU is education, culture, and sport. We try to combine everything, not just playing sports,\" he said.\n\"It's important to combine sport events with cultural experiences. Some people are coming to China for the first time. They need to communicate with students from Chinese universities and learn the local culture - whether it's dancing, cultural events, or food. Culture and education go hand in hand with sports. This is what university sports is all about.\"",
