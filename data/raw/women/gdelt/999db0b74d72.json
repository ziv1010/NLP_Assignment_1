  "body_text": "The current winner of the Ballon d'Or, Aitana Bonmatí, has renewed her contract with Barcelona until 2028, leaving many speechless in women's soccer. Having joined the club when she was 13, this midfielder is truly a symbol for the Blaugrana. With this renewal by Aitana and Barcelona, the message goes very clear: the commitment to women's soccer is much firmer now than ever. Living in the day and age of astronomical offers and seducing opportunities, Bonmatí has opted to stay with Barça-a milestone worth taking a further look into.\nFollow Playing for 90 on X (Twitter).\nAitana Bonmatí's importance to Barcelona\nAitana is infinitely more than just one more player in Barcelona. At only 26, she has won five Spanish Leagues, six Queen's Cups, four Super Cups, and most importantly, three Champions League titles. Her stats speak volumes: 275 matches played, 96 goals scored, and 23 trophies. Those numbers place Aitana among the greatest in the club's history, and surely this renewal until 2028 will see much more achieved by her.\nBut why is Aitana Bonmatí important to Barça? Well, aside from what she is on the field-she's an international icon with accolades from the Ballon d'Or to UEFA Women's Player of the Year to Laureus Sportswoman of the Year-not just a little longer, this renovation secures a great player but reaffirms the identity and commitment of the club to the growth of women's soccer.\nBig offers rejected\nThe market for women's football is really heating up, and Aitana Bonmatí is right at the heart of this movement. Michele Kang, the owner of Lyon and Washington Spirit, was determined to get a signature from the Barcelona star; hence, she offered her a deal playing for both Lyon and later Washington Spirit. Chelsea also slammed €11 million on the table for a four-year contract. Yet, despite such tempting offers, Bonmatí chose to stay at Barça.\nThe fact that Aitana chose to remain with Barcelona, her \"home,\" is much larger than it seems. Living in a world fully dominated by big financial offers, her decision to stay at an apartment she loves says much about those values of identity and loyalty which, in women's football, can still be found. Barça, for Aitana, is much more than just a team; it's where she grew up, developed, and reached the pinnacle of the soccer world.\nThe Number 14, Symbolism of Rejection of Opportunities Because just in case there was any doubt from anyone, especially lovers of symbolism, Aitana's renewal is with the number 14. It is the number she carries on her jersey, and precisely announced at 14:14 was the renewal. Curious-if you add 14+14, you get 28, the year when her new contract will expire. It was a coincidental gesture, yet symbolic, of the care and attention Barça has given to valuing its star. This is not just numbers or dates, but about how the club recognizes the importance Aitana has for the present and future.\nSpeaking to the future, what will Aitana's renovation mean for women's soccer on the international stage? While being one of the most wanted by clubs like Lyon and Chelsea, Aitana followed her heart and refused all kinds of offers that could take her career somewhere else. She decided to stay with the club she grew up in, making history while helping consolidate Barcelona as one of the strongest teams in women's soccer.\nA statement, that is what the renovation of Aitana is. Of course, it is not just about securing one of the best players in the world for another five years, but rather a statement to reinforce your commitment to building an enduring legacy in women's soccer.",
