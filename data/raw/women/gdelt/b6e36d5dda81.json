  "body_text": "THE 2024 Toyota AFL Grand Final between the Sydney Swans and Brisbane Lions starts at 2.30pm AEST on Saturday, September 28.\nThis will be the first time that these two clubs have faced each other in a Grand Final in the AFL era, the first time they have played in a Grand Final since relocating or merging, and just the second overall since they first clashed in the 1899 Grand Final as South Melbourne and Fitzroy.\nSydney is seeking to become the fourth minor premier in a row to take out the premiership cup, following the success of Melbourne (2021), Geelong (2022) and Collingwood (2023). Brisbane, however, is aiming to be the first team since Adelaide in 1998 to win the premiership from fifth, and the first since the Western Bulldogs (2016) to win the flag from outside the top four.\nIt's also the first time since 1995 that a Grand Final will be played between the two teams who lost the past two season deciders. Carlton (lost in 1993 to Essendon) and Geelong (lost to West Coast in 1994) clashed in the '95 decider with the rampant Blues winning by 61 points.\nThe Swans are looking to win their first premiership since 2012, having lost three Grand Finals since (in 2014, 2016 and 2022), and their sixth overall. The Lions are eyeing their fourth premiership as the Brisbane Lions, following the famous three-peat successes in 2001-03, and their 12th overall as a merged entity including Fitzroy's eight VFL premierships.\nHow to watch the Grand Final\nFans in Australia can watch the game on TV on Channel 7 and 7Plus in 1080p HD. The game will also be streamed live on the AFL Live Official App on mobile and tablet devices. Download from the App Store or Google Play.\nFans outside Australia can catch the game via Watch AFL.
