  "body_text": "He is a giant of popular music, the man who signed some of the biggest acts in the world. As the founder of Island Records, Chris Blackwell has nurtured the careers of many all-time great artists, including Steve Winwood, Cat Stevens, Roxy Music, Grace Jones and U2, whose frontman Bono described Blackwell as “an adventurer, entrepreneur, buccaneer, a visionary and a gentleman.”\nAnd yet Blackwell admits to “missing a few.” He turned down Pink Floyd (“I never connected with the music”) and Elton John (“I thought he was far too shy to be a performer”). He missed out on Dire Straits because he stayed upstairs in a bar talking while they played a show for his benefit and passed on Madonna because “I couldn’t work out what on earth I could do for her.” He turned down the Rolling Stones at the height of their golden period in 1970 because he thought “it would have been too much of a circus for Island”, possibly capsizing his independent label. And he let Led Zeppelin slip through his fingers.\n“I knew right away they’d be huge,” admits Blackwell, who had been in Olympic studios in 1968, producing a Traffic album, when he heard Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones and John Bonham playing in another room. “They didn’t even have a name yet, but the music was unbelievable.” He struck a verbal deal with manager Peter Grant but later realised he had been manipulated to get a better offer from Atlantic Records. “I’m glad I didn’t sign them in the end. They were too dangerous in my opinion. They would have been wrong for Island.”\nThe artist that is perhaps most emblematic of Island is Bob Marley, who Blackwell helped turn into the first and greatest reggae superstar. The Island logo, a palm tree, is inspired by the Jamaican soil on which both Blackwell and Marley grew up, the former as a wealthy heir of a Jamaican-British rum-making family, the latter as the poor but gifted mixed-race son of a Jamaican woman and former British military officer who died when Marley was a child.\nTheir paths crossed in London in 1972, where Marley was trying to hustle the record label owner for money for a flight back to Kingston. Blackwell was struck right away by Marley’s charisma and composure. “I thought, f___, this is the real deal.” He advanced him £4,000 to make an album without a contract.",
