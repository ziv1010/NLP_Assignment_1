Footage from the match showed William enthusiastically cheering and embracing those around him at Villa Park, as his team triumphed 1-0 against the German titans on Wednesday evening, mirroring their European Cup final win from 42 years ago.\nPost-match, William confessed: \"I've lost my voice. I can't quite believe it. 42 years.\" Prior to the Champions League game, William had a meet-and-greet with Villa's 1982 European Cup-winning squad at the stadium, an event the club shared on social media with the caption: \"Royalty meets Aston Villa royalty.\"\nA post on the Prince and Princess of Wales's X social media account read: \"42 years on, our 1982 European Cup winning legends are here on an historic night for @AVFCOfficial. Ready for the first game on home turf in this year's European adventure... #UTV (Up the Villa).\" Villa, who kicked off their European campaign with a 3-0 victory against Swiss team Young Boys, played their first home fixture in Europe's premier competition since a quarter-final loss to Juventus in 1983.\nEarlier on Wednesday, football stars including ex-Scotland player Ally McCoist were honoured by William at an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle. McCoist, who was awarded an OBE, said the pair chatted about football, including Aston Villa's European tie. The former player and manager told the PA news agency: \"I'm obviously well aware that the prince is an Aston Villa fan they've got a very, very big game tonight, which I think he's going to.\n\"So we spoke about that, and just generally working in broadcasting and life really.\"\nFormer England international Karen Carney, who was made an OBE, said she had \"some banter\" with William who supports the rival team to her Birmingham City. \"To be brutally honest, a lot of people know I'm a Birmingham City fan, there's a big game at Aston Villa tonight,\" Carney said.\n\"Obviously with Prince William being a Villa fan I thought there was a good opportunity for some banter with him. He was really gracious, he's going to the game, which is cool. So we just chatted about football really which is I think the common language for everybody, I think everyone can talk about football which is really good.\"\n\"I've met him previously with the Lionesses, he's a football fan for both the men's and women's game, which is really cool.\" Earlier this year, William was seen cheering on the England men's national team at the Euros.",
