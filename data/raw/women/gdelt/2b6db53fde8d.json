We have so many remarkable people in our community, and this is where we’re going to hear their stories. We’re going to get their perspectives on CSU’s next 150 years and gather their very best advice for today’s CSU students. Let’s get started, Rams. Today, I’m excited to have CSU Basketball stars McKenna Hofschild and Joe Palmer with me. Both are extraordinary Rams who’ve made history on the basketball court and who have won the admiration of legions of fans, including myself. I’ve loved watching you play this season, and I’ve asked you both here today because you’re not only top athletes, but you’re also great student leaders at Colorado State University. So first of all, thank you for being here and welcome to CSU’s Next 150 Podcast.\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:00:52] Thank you for having us. This is exciting.\nJoe Palmer [00:00:54] This is great.\nAmy Parsons [00:00:55] Well, let’s get going with an icebreaker question. So see if you can choose a chip out of the bowl there. And that will tell me what my first question is for you.\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:01:03] Okay. All right. I got chip two.\nAmy Parsons [00:01:06] Okay. We’ll start with you, McKenna. What’s the first thing you. Yeah. What’s the first thing you do if you and I switched roles for a day?\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:01:15] The first thing I would do if we switched roles would be. Oh, there’s so many things I would do. I feel like you got a lot of power. You could. I don’t know. I would give, I would give all the students free parking.\nAmy Parsons [00:01:33] Free parking?\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:01:34] Yes. Yeah. Yeah.\nAmy Parsons [00:01:36] It always comes back to parking. Always, always. All roads lead to parking. Yeah, I love it. All right, Joe, what question do you have?\nJoe Palmer [00:01:43] Four.\nAmy Parsons [00:01:43] Number four. Would you rather go back, and would you rather go back and relive your first year or your last year at CSU and why?\nJoe Palmer [00:01:54] I’m going to say my last year, just because we had so much success as a basketball team and being with that team was so much fun. There’s so much camaraderie, and all the guys were so close with each other. And then obviously, too, we made it to the big dance, and that’s kind of been the dream. So reliving that would be unreal.\nAmy Parsons [00:02:15] Absolutely. Yeah. And we’re going to come back to the big dance in a minute because that was just amazing this year. So, McKenna, you are a graduate student. College of business. You’re one of the best women’s basketball players in CSU history. You have a long list of accolades, including four time member of the All Mountain West team. This season, you have the nation’s number two assist average. Amazing. You’re Colorado State’s and Mountain West all time assist leader. Second in program in league history and scoring. Sportswoman of the year, just to name a few. I’m not going to name them all here. You also helped us to sell out Moby with so many fans coming to see you play this year, that was an amazing day. So, you know, as one of the best players in collegiate basketball today, what does it feel like now looking back on this incredible career you’ve had here?\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:03:06] Ah, man, I think the past four years here, the career I’ve had, it’s just been such a blessing. Looking back, just the amount of people I’ve been able to meet, the places I’ve been able to go, the experiences I’ve had are second to none. And my whole journey kind of coming and getting here to CSU. I won’t change it for the world. I think this has been the best four years of my life. So, just to leave my my mark on the basketball court, but hopefully also on the university and the community, just, it means the world to me. And it will always be a place I call home.\nAmy Parsons [00:03:34] That’s great. Well, it’s been a blessing to us, to have you here and, and CSU is a better place because you’re around and because of your time here at Colorado State, and we’ll always be just so proud of you no matter, no matter where you go. So, Joe, you are a graduate student also studying sports management with your bachelor’s degree in history and social behavioral science. You’re without a doubt CSU fan favorite. This season you played in all 36 games.\nJoe Palmer [00:04:00] Yeah.\nAmy Parsons [00:04:00] That’s amazing, including in March Madness and early in the season, you scored 11 points against Colorado, our rival, to win that game with those three three pointers, I think that was one of the most fun games I think I’ve ever personally been at in my life. And of course, we can’t forget your headband fame, which everyone was wearing your, your headband by the end of the season. And you’ve had a remarkable basketball journey from Division III basketball to playing in March Madness this year. So, tell us a bit more about what it was like for you to play. I was there cheering you on in Dayton, there cheering you on in Charlotte. And what was that like for you?\nAmy Parsons [00:04:36] Yeah, I think coming for, from where I come from, Division III, you know, small school, in Minneapolis, I think, I would have called you a liar if someone said, “Hey, in a couple of years, you’re going to be at Colorado State University playing in March Madness.” But, you know, I stayed the course, and Coach Medved and the coaching staff here took a chance on me. And I’m forever grateful for that opportunity that they gave me. And then this year, just being in the big dance and I’ve been dreaming about that since I’ve been five years old. My dad was an elementary school principal and I would grab the newspapers from his office and fill out brackets for hours after school while he was still working. So I, that’s literally been my basketball dream since I’ve been a young kid is to just play in March Madness. And then having so much support from you and the Colorado State community and fans was just great because they traveled so well. I mean, in Charlotte, it was great just seeing how many fans were there for us and it made a difference, believe it or not.\nAmy Parsons [00:05:38] Yeah.\nJoe Palmer [00:05:38] The game didn’t go how we wanted it to go, but it was still just, you could really feel the love from Colorado State and everyone that was there for us.\nAmy Parsons [00:05:46] Yeah.\nJoe Palmer [00:05:46] I’ll never forget that.\nAmy Parsons [00:05:48] You’re absolutely right about the fans.\nJoe Palmer [00:05:49] Yeah.\nAmy Parsons [00:05:49] It was so much fun for me, traveling with the team to see all of the Rams who came out in Dayton, all the fans who came out in Charlotte and I know that you had so many fans back here in Colorado. Students were at the football stadium watching it on the big screen, watching the games. And so just congratulations on that success. And I think that’s really the power of collegiate athletics is, is how much it can unify people. Especially you know, and we’ve got tremendous players like you both. So we’re all grateful. We’re all grateful for that. Joe, sticking with you for a moment, I imagine you’ve learned a lot of lessons in your time as a, as an elite basketball player and, and balancing that with your academic career, as well. That’s a lot.\nJoe Palmer [00:06:29] Yeah.\nAmy Parsons [00:06:30] To balance all the time. Talk to us about some of the leadership lessons that you’ve learned in your time that you think will serve you well after your time at Colorado State?\nJoe Palmer [00:06:39] Yeah. So obviously the big one, being a basketball player and being in academics is time management. So that was a big thing for me, is just learning to balance my time and make sure I’m staying on top of my schoolwork. And then one of my favorite quotes from Coach Medved that he says that I’ll never forget for the rest of myself is: “Know who you are, be who you are, and love who you are.” And I’ll carry that with me for the rest of my life with leadership roles and whatnot, and just trying to give back to people who are in my position. So, I think that’s such a great life motto to have and I’ll carry that with me. And I’ve learned so much from being a student here, from being an athlete here, and it’s made me a better person overall that, you know, I wouldn’t have gotten it anywhere else. So, I’m so thankful to be a CSU Ram.\nAmy Parsons [00:07:32] That’s great. Know who you are.\nJoe Palmer [00:07:34] Be who you are\nAmy Parsons [00:07:34] Be who you are.\nJoe Palmer [00:07:35] Love who you are.\nAmy Parsons [00:07:35] Love who you are. That’s really great. Yeah, I’ve, I’ve learned a lot from Coach Medved and the coaching staff.\nJoe Palmer [00:07:41] Yeah, he’s, he’s got a lot of tricks of the trade that he knows. So I kind of get upset with him sometimes because it’s like, gosh, it’s like he’s reading my mind, right? He knows exactly what I’m what I’m thinking. So. But he made me a better man for it, so.\nAmy Parsons [00:07:55] That’s great. Well, I’m 100% certain that those lessons will serve you very well.\nJoe Palmer [00:08:00] Yeah.\n[00:08:00] No matter where you go after here, after graduation.\nJoe Palmer [00:08:03] I think so.\nAmy Parsons [00:08:04] Yeah. McKenna, same question for you. There’s so many leadership lessons that I’m sure you’ve learned as a leader on the team, a leader of the sport, while balancing your academic career, as well. How do you see those lessons carrying you forward after your time as CSU?\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:08:20] Well, I want to be a coach, so I see those lessons carrying a lot of weight in my, my future career path. I think the biggest thing is just being good to those that have been good to you. Basketball, sports, everything’s all about relationships, I think. So just, just trying to be the best person you can be and inspire the next generations and kind of show ’em the ways that, that made me successful and made me kind of find my way and be a good person on the floor, be a good person outside of the floor, be a good student in the classroom and just try my best to be a good role model and an example for those that come after me.\nAmy Parsons [00:08:58] Yeah, maybe you’ll be one of those coaches who can read minds.\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:09:01] Yeah, hopefully. I’m going to have to talk to Coach Medved about that.\nAmy Parsons [00:09:04] Yeah.\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:09:04] See what he’s got for me.\nAmy Parsons [00:09:06] Well, one of one of the people who I really admire is Becky Hammon, who of course, is a ram who went on to have I mean, she’s she’s an incredible coach right now, out there in the WNBA and the Aces and, and she was playing here when I was here as a student. So I’ve followed her for a very long time and I’m really excited to see her successes. Is she someone who you look up to, as well, as just a ram who’s out there doing amazing things in coaching.\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:09:30] Totally. I think Becky Hammon is, like, just so legendary, especially around Fort Collins in this community. I mean, you can’t go anywhere without somebody talking about her just because of the footprint that she left here. And to kind of follow that same path of being a player and then trying to be into the coaching world is just, she’s a good person to look at and try and kind of follow and emulate.\nAmy Parsons [00:09:53] Yeah, she’s a lot of fun to watch too.\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:09:54] Oh yeah.\n[00:09:55] As she’s coaching, so yeah. So hey, hey, Becky, if you’re listening, come back and hang out with us, we’d love to have you any time. Let’s stick with the topic of women’s sports and women’s basketball for a minute. McKenna. I mean, there’s a lot of momentum right now around women’s sports. It’s so exciting to see what happened this year. With Caitlin Clark and just the viewership and the fandom around women’s basketball and, and what’s happening in the WNBA as well, and even in volleyball, you know, an increasing viewership in volleyball. We have our own national champion in Maya Lesner this year and winning the, winning the shot put for the NCAA, I mean, it’s it’s really exciting what’s happening in women’s sports right now. And just your perspective on how we all can really keep up that momentum and build that fandom that women’s sports deserves.\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:10:41] Yeah, I mean, it has been such an incredible year for women’s sports. And I think the biggest thing is, just the amount of people that have gone into it’s super open minded. And I feel like in the past people might look at women’s sports and be like, oh, I’m not really interested. But once you get to a game, you are totally invested. I’ve heard that so many times, just talking to fans that have come to our games, and I think this year it’s just kind of exploded for women’s basketball, volleyball, all the sports, people really want to be a part of something special. And, and this is a great time to do it and to have people like Caitlin Clark, Paige Beuckers, all these amazing athletes kind of being the spokesperson or the leader of that movement is just. It’s huge and I’m so excited to see where it goes. And, hopefully it continues to grow, not only for women’s basketball, but every sport.\nAmy Parsons [00:11:30] Yeah, it is really exciting and, and you know, I mentioned it earlier about this year when we had the sell out of one of your games and to see fans all the way up to the rafters and so many kids afterwards getting your autograph and, and really becoming fans, I mean, that’s something that I’m dedicated to in my role of just really keeping that momentum and that fandom going. It’s exciting. Joe, I don’t want to leave you out of this conversation.\nJoe Palmer [00:11:55] I was gonna add to that. McKenna, first off, can’t leave her name out of that conversation with Caitlin Clark and Paige Beuckers and all them.\nAmy Parsons [00:12:02] Absolutely.\nJoe Palmer [00:12:02] It was, it was quite a year, I think just the awareness, level of women’s sports was on a completely different level this year, and that was such a big deal, you know, being on national televised games and whatnot. And I’ll say, when I was back home with my with my parents, I don’t think I’ve ever seen my mom that invested into a basketball game. And she raised seven kids, who all played basketball, and we were watching on the TV, and she’d watch a lot of McKenna’s games, too, just because she loves everything CSU now. But, she was literally like up off the couch at like nine at night watching these games. And she was so invested. And I thought that was just like, really cool to see because, you know, having the women’s sports be on ESPN, be on CBS Sports is such a big deal because it shows that, you know, people want to watch them just as much as they want to watch men, and if not more. I mean, this year especially was actually I mean, with the Final Four and Women’s March Madness side almost getting.\nJoe Palmer [00:13:04] I think.\n[00:13:04] Most watched ever.\nJoe Palmer [00:13:05] Yeah.\nAmy Parsons [00:13:05] More viewership than ever.\nJoe Palmer [00:13:06] So that was that was great to see.\nAmy Parsons [00:13:08] Yeah, it is really exciting. And when I see, you know, these big games and the big games coming to see you play, I love seeing that the boys getting autographs too, right? I mean, you’re, you’re obviously a great role model for little girls, right? And young girls who, who want to be in various sports and they see the success that you’ve had and they want to be like you. And I also love seeing seeing the guys and. Yeah, and the boys are because they are fans as well. And that’s what we, we want to show them. Right is, is to be fans of both. And I, I loved at that sellout game looking up, we’ve got our entire men’s football team up there cheering you on. Right? And and just just that camaraderie, right?among among our students for the sports is really exciting. Joe I got to say I hung out with your mom a lot last year.\nJoe Palmer [00:13:51] She’s a hoot.\nAmy Parsons [00:13:51] She and I are friends now. And we were in Dayton and Charlotte together, and.\nJoe Palmer [00:13:56] She has a thick Minnesotan accent, too.\nAmy Parsons [00:13:58] Yeah. No she was great. And she was she was so excited for you as well. And that’s and and McKenna, I saw your mom, at so many games and and consider her a friend too. And I find her in the crowd at the games and, you know, just the support that I’ve seen both of you have from from your parents, I think has been has been really special. So, yeah.\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:14:16] Yeah, it makes all the difference in the world.\nJoe Palmer [00:14:19] Sure does. It helps to have that, family life to fall back on when things are kind of getting tough. You know, you can always rely on mom.\nAmy Parsons [00:14:27] Yeah.\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:14:27] Totally. Totally.\nAmy Parsons [00:14:29] Yeah. They’re out there cheering you on. No matter what happens, no matter what happens. Always. I can count on parents, and it’s always fun for me to go find the moms and dads in the crowd and see how they’re doing as we go through these games. So, so, so a minute ago I mentioned the the fandom, right? And seeing all of the students up there cheering you on in these games, I want to talk about that for a minute. I think there’s something really special about collegiate sports, in a place like Colorado State University. And, and to me, it actually relates to much bigger principles like democracy in this country. You know, I talk a lot about democracy in my role. CSU is a land grant institution. We’re kind of founded on democracy. It’s something that’s really important to us. And in today’s society, it’s a very polarized society, with politics and, and issues that divide people. And I really believe that to make progress in this country and to kind of close some of that polarization and that divisiveness, it’s going to come down to leaders like, you know, to be honest, it’s going to come down to our, our young adults, our our leaders who are just emerging as leaders in this country. And, and to do that, our leaders have to know how to work with people who are very different from them, know how to work with people from different backgrounds, different cultures, be able to have those social bridges with people so that you can talk about issues and make progress as a society. And I think that looking at collegiate sports is kind of a perfect way to look at it. I imagine that on the teams that you’ve played on maybe your whole lives, but certainly here in college athletics, you’ve been shoulder to shoulder with people who come from very different backgrounds, from you might have different cultural experiences. But when you’re on the team together, you’re all pulling in the same direction. You have the common identity as Rams. You have the same goals going forward. When I look up at the fandom, the thousands of students who come up and fill our stands to cheer you on, they are literally shoulder to shoulder with one another, with a shared identity of fans willing you to victory, right? Hanging on everything that’s happening. And it doesn’t matter that they come from different backgrounds and cultures, in that moment, they’re cheering you on. That’s really important. I think of kind of exercising that muscle of, we we all have a shared humanity. We all have some shared identities. So not to put too much of a burden on you guys, but the future kind of depends on on the skills that you have and that you demonstrate to bring people together from different backgrounds. So I guess, you know, I’ll, you know, give us some thoughts on what it’s been like for you to really get to know people, and to, to work with and, and be at a university from people from very different places.\nJoe Palmer [00:17:06] Yeah.\nAmy Parsons [00:17:06] I mean, it’s a big question.\nJoe Palmer [00:17:07] Yeah. No, I think the first thing kind of we, we have more in common than we think. I think, to start off and having, like a shared identity, even though people come from very different cultural backgrounds, you know, having a shared identity and a common goal can kind of bring you together in ways you never thought imaginable.\nAmy Parsons [00:17:25] Yeah.\nJoe Palmer [00:17:25] You know, if, we have something that you can kind of strive for as, like a group, then it makes it all that much easier, you know? So.\nAmy Parsons [00:17:37] Yeah. It makes other conversations easier.\nJoe Palmer [00:17:39] Yeah. And just sharing each other’s experiences, too. You know, like, you like you mentioned, everyone comes from different backgrounds and no two people are the same, but, experiencing each other’s different cultures and different backgrounds and kind of having that, camaraderie of togetherness can show you that, you know, we’re not all that different, and it’s not as bad as it seems.\nAmy Parsons [00:18:06] Right. Yeah. Yeah, that’s a great perspective. Yeah.\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:18:08] It was good perspective. I think sports is the most special thing that can bring people together from all walks of life. I think it is like no other in that regard. And being on the women’s team, we’re big in international recruiting. So I’ve had teammates from Spain, Hungary, Sweden, India, all over the world. And I think it just really makes you appreciate everyone’s differences. But it is really cool to see, you know, people from different cultural backgrounds come together and work towards one goal. And, yeah, once you find that one goal, everyone kind of has that same mindset, regardless of how you’re raised or where you’re from. It’s, it’s pretty cool what sports can do and how it can bring people together and lead into some really great things.\nAmy Parsons [00:18:57] Yeah. I mean, I think you’re absolutely right. I don’t know what else besides the sports can do it at that level, at scale. Thousands of people watching, pulling in the same direction. And I think it it has a ripple effect too, is that with a victory, everybody celebrates together in a big way and just shares those joyous moments. And, you know, with a heartbreaking loss, it’s the same. Everyone is commiserating together, and it’s this social bridge among people that you’re right. McCann and I don’t know anything else in our society that can really do it at that level. And…\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:19:29] I just think about when you guys were in Dayton, we a lot of the women’s team went to Brothers Bar and Grill. I think it was, Was it a Tuesday?\nJoe Palmer [00:19:38] Yeah.\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:19:38] Because it’s $2 burgers on Tuesdays. So we were all excited about that. And really oh, we can watch the men’s game. And I mean that place was packed wall to wall. There was nowhere to sit. Everyone was so excited like it was a game before you guys even were playing. And they would they would shoot over to like, you guys warming up and every one of the night everyone would go crazy. And I think that was the coolest part, is this is just a huge group of people that don’t really know each other, but we’re all cheering for the same group of people, and I think that unites people a lot.\nJoe Palmer [00:20:09] Yeah, I think that, too, to bounce off that, I think sports are such a great bridge to have shared experiences. And, you know, when we’re all rooting for like the same, the same team or the same goal and stuff like that in goodness and in badness.\nAmy Parsons [00:20:24] Yeah.\n[00:20:24] It kind of, you know, it, it it helps to, make things not as hard or difficult when they are bad and it makes things all that much better when things go well. And, you know, when teams like CSU win. So, I’m sure that, I’m sure that Tuesday game was a lot better than.\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:20:39] Oh, it was so much fun.\nJoe Palmer [00:20:40] The Charlotte game. So…\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:20:42] But even that when we all like gathered around and we watched it and we were cheering you guys on as if we were front row.\nJoe Palmer [00:20:48] Yeah.\nAmy Parsons [00:20:49] Yeah, it’s so great. Like you say, like what else can do that? And I think it really is a value, honestly, of coming to college of of getting a degree at a place like CSU is that you can find those common identities, have those experiences cheering on our athletes playing, right? That you’re not going to get somewhere else that doesn’t have that as part of the culture.\nJoe Palmer [00:21:09] No, there really is no better spot than CSU for that. I’m so glad that, that I wish I wish I had more than two years here. I’ll say that, so..\nAmy Parsons [00:21:16] Yeah, yeah, so do I. I wish you both, but, I’m going to miss you both so much when you leave, so. So let’s let’s then, you know, sort of pivot to your, at your, at the end of your college careers, sadly, for us. Think about what advice you would give to students at CSU who are just starting their careers, just arriving on campus in Fort Collins in the fall semester. What would you like them to know? Or maybe what do you wish you would have known that you didn’t know when you first became a Ram?\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:21:49] Oh good question.\nJoe Palmer [00:21:50] That’s a good one.\nMcKenna Hofschild [00:21:51] I think my advice would be, it sounds so cliche, but just enjoy every moment. I think my four years here really did fly by, and I look back and I I’m so grateful for everything, but I wish I had more time, right? And just try and get out as much as possible in the community and do different things. Try things you’ve never done. I think as athletes, we can kind of get a little stagnant in our day to day lives. We have school, we have basketball. We hang out with the same people every day. We see the same people. And so to just get out of your comfort zone a little bit, maybe join a different group or club or whatever it is to meet new people, try new experiences and, just really enjoy the moment because it flies by and so fast.\nJoe Palmer [00:22:33] Yeah,.\nAmy Parsons [00:22:33] So fast. Yeah.\nJoe Palmer [00:22:35] I want to go off that too. I mean, I remember being an 18 year old freshman like it was yesterday, and now I’m here in my fifth year at CSU. So what I would say to that again, cliche, but it goes by way too fast. The good times goes by way too fast. So, just enjoy it. And like McKenna said, to get involved, do things, you know, I mean, don’t just do the, the bare minimum, you know, schools, school is great. It’s going to take up a lot of your time. But, you know, join a club, join an activity, go to a, go to a sports game. And because that will just lead you to so many more relationships and it’ll really make your time here that much more valuable and that much more memorable when you look back at it. So I wish, I wish I could go back and and restart, I really do, I wish I could restart it, but yeah, a lot of great memories.

Like you’ll you’ll check Instagram or Twitter or Facebook or something like that. It’s like you’re everywhere and not a lot of school. I don’t think any other school in the United States can say they have a president, that that’s their that involved with everything.
