I'm thinking all those things. But a wise man once said, my mentor Paul Honsinger, he said, 'Sometimes you gotta get a win and get the hell out,' and that's what it felt like tonight.\n“I feel like our group is starting to understand that we don't need to win pretty. I'm a big football fan, but I think to the Kansas City Chiefs. With my Chiefs this year, it hasn't been pretty, but we don't need to win pretty if they buy into that.”\nThe Mocs got off to a hot start to the day, scoring the game’s first five points of the game. While UTC was then able to hold the lead for much of the first quarter, a late pair of baskets by Furman saw the Paladins leading 15-14 through the opening 10 minutes.\nThat lead wouldn’t last long for the Paladins, as the Mocs came out ready to rumble in the second frame with Chattanooga out-scoring Furman 17-5 over the course of the second quarter. Elisaldez led the charge for the Mocs while UTC’s tenacious defense stonewalled the Paladins. Heading into the halftime break, the Mocs were looking at a double-digit lead with Chattanooga up 31-20.\nUTC kept their distance from the Paladins over the course of the third period, not allowing Furman to really gain an inch and finding a response for every basket by the Paladins. Heading into the fourth quarter ahead 48-39, the Mocs had their sights set on closing out the day with a W.\nA full court press by Furman in the final 10 minutes gave the Mocs some issues, but having been in a similar situation earlier in the season, the Mocs took Furman’s best shot and still stood standing. The closest the Paladins were able to make it was a 64-60 UTC lead with nine seconds remaining.\nWith a technical foul on Furman and some clutch free throws by Sigrun Olafsdottir, the Mocs blew that lead right back up to eight as the final buzzer sounded. With a 68-60 scoreline, UTC picked up a massive win to now sit just one game back from first place in the SoCon standings as the league heads into the second half of league play.\nThe Mocs now return home for a pair of in-conference clashes, starting first on Thursday, February 6 with UNC Greensboro coming to town. Thursday’s game against the Spartans is set for a 6 p.m. ET start time and will be available to stream on ESPN+. It will also be available over the radio on WFLI 96.1 FM/100.3 FM/1070 AM.\nThe Mocs (10-10, 5-2 SoCon) entered hostile territory on Saturday, but thanks in large part to a career-high 24 points by sophomore Caia Elisaldez, the Mocs earned their fifth SoCon win of the season as the team hits the midway point of the SoCon schedule.\n\"I think me being the perfectionist I am, I'm always dissecting, and that game shouldn't have been that close,” head coach Deandra Schirmer said.\n“I feel like our group is starting to understand that we don't need to win pretty.
