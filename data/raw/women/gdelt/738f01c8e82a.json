Payne signed a contract through 2026 with PSG.\nPSG are one of the biggest soccer clubs in the world.

PSG\"s men\"s team won the French Ligue 1 championship last year with international superstars Lionel Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe on their roster.\n\"It's something I've always dreamed of,\" Payne told PSG TV of signing with the club. \"I became a professional player when I was a teenager, and I've grown up playing football (soccer) since I was four, so to experience a moment like this is very special. I'm really grateful to be here.\"\nPayne, a Birmingham native, played for Oak Mountain in high school, where she earned All-County First Team honors as a forward in 2019 and a midfielder in 2017.
