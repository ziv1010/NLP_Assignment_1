  "body_text": "Stick here for live updates and analysis as Denver takes on the Jets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.\nLive updates\nFINAL | Broncos 13, Jets 11\nThe Broncos recorded nine sacks on Jets quarterback Justin Fields Sunday as Denver narrowly held on to win 13-11 over New York in London.\nNone was more important than the split sack by Jonathon Cooper and Brandon Jones late in the fourth quarter with the Jets on fourth-and-8. The play sealed Denver’s victory.\nNext up for the Broncos: Hosting the Giants at 2:05 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 19.\nMore Broncos coverage:\n- Broncos Analysis: Defense racks up 9 sacks, bails out offense in London win over Jets. ‘That was a masterclass.’\n- Broncos-Jets report card: Sean Payton’s offensive slump, sloppy special-teams play nearly down Denver.\n- Broncos HC Sean Payton baffled by Aaron Glenn’s end-of-half clock management for Jets: ‘That’s unusual.’\n- Broncos QB Bo Nix bemoans offense’s ‘complete lack of rhythm’ in second half against Jets 1.\n- Broncos LG Ben Powers’ injury absence looms large as Matt Peart racks up three penalties in starting debut.\n- Broncos four downs: Vance Joseph, defense bails Sean Payton out. Again.\n- PHOTOS: Denver Broncos beat New York Jets 13-11 in London during NFL Week 6.\nFourth-quarter updates\nBallgame (10:33 a.m.): The Broncos offense and special teams did everything they could to trip up across the pond and Vance Joseph’s group simply wouldn’t let it happen. Nine sacks of Justin Fields sends the Broncos on a very long flight home 4-2. — Gabriel\nThe Broncos defense saves the day … again. What a performance. Nine sacks. 82 total yards allowed. If not for special teams and a turnover, this probably isn’t even a game. Vance Joseph, game ball. — Schubert\nThis is as close to a loss as a win gets. The Broncos are 4-2 after six games and have a whole spread of results to iron out on the flight home from London. Baffling play-calling and offensive and special-teams mistakes nearly cost them, and the pass-rush bails them out yet again. — Evans\nSacked (10:32 a.m.): The ninth sack of the day for Denver locks up their win. — Nguyen\nAND SACK NO. 9!!!! — Schubert\nHuge play (10:31 a.m.): Talanoa Hufanga flies in to break up the third-down pass! What a play. And the Jets are going for it. — Schubert\nSacked (10:30 a.m.): Justin Strnad with a huge sack. Five-yard loss on the play. — Nguyen\nBroncos pass rush produces its 8th sack of the game. And now the Jets are behind the sticks at midfield. — Schubert\nRamifications (10:28 a.m.): That overturned fumble call is really looming large right now. — Schubert\nPrime position (10:25 a.m.): Broncos’ awful offense puts team in spot to get walked off for third time this season. — Renck\nJets get the ball at their 44-yard line with 2:23 to go. Unbelievable.\nJets are essentially one 15-yard gain away from potentially stealing this game. — Schubert\nFourth down (10:24 a.m.): Instead, Bo Nix is sacked and the Jets are going to get the ball back trailing 13-11 with under three minutes left. The Broncos are doing everything they can to lose this game. — Schubert\nThird down (10:23 a.m.): Two runs and the Broncos are facing third-and-long. It’s hard to believe the Jets can make anything happen on offense, but all it takes is one play. A first down sure would be nice for Bo Nix. — Schubert\nFirst downs needed (10:22 a.m.): Two first downs and Broncos win one of ugliest games in franchise history. — Renck\nSacked (10:19 a.m.): No. 7 for the Broncos on No. 7. Split sack by Nik Bonitto and Zach Allen. — Nguyen\nNik Bonitto with his fourth straight multi-sack game. The Broncos defense with their seventh sack of the game. Just a masterful performance from this elite pass rush. — Schubert\n(Not technically a multiple sack game, I don’t think, because they gave him split credit on both.) — Gabriel\nYou are correct. Bonitto credited with a half sack. — Schubert\nSpecial teams (10:18 a.m.): Jets were this close to breaking another big kick return. Instead, it’s Jets ball at its 33-yard line. — Schubert\nField goal, Broncos (10:15 a.m.): Wil Lutz buries the 27-yard field goal. Broncos lead 13-11 with 5:06 to go. — Nguyen\nBo Nix overshoots Courtland Sutton on third down, and the Broncos have to settle for a field goal. Suboptimal. — Schubert\nAnother incompletion (10:15 a.m.): Bo Nix audibles to … a run stuff. Third and goal at the 10. — Schubert\nIncompletion (10:13 a.m.): First down boot and rollout with nobody looking to catch a pass. Ouch. — Gabriel\nBootleg with no one in route. Playing chess today. — Renck\nAnother first down (10:12 a.m.): Nix to Pat Bryant gives the Broncos the ball inside the 10. First and goal. — Schubert\nBig first down (10:11 a.m.): Bo Nix finds Marvin Mims Jr., who goes 26 yards on the catch-and-run. — Nguyen\nWhen the going gets tough, getting the ball in 19’s hands is a good idea. — Gabriel\nFinally, a schemed-up play for a big gain: Marvin Mims Jr. on a swing pass out of the backfield has Denver in field goal range. A touchdown here might win it. — Schubert\nFirst down (10:09 a.m.): Bo Nix connects with Evan Engram for a 12-yard gain. It’s Nix’s first completion since the second quarter. — Nguyen\nEvan Engram high-points a first-down grab and Bo Nix finally has his first completion of the second half. — Schubert\nDo something (10:08 a.m.): If Sean Payton’s got something in the bag today, this would be a pretty good time for it. Or maybe he got pickpocketed on the way here. — Gabriel\nPunting (10:05 a.m.): Jets are winless and controlling this game and yet decide to punt from their own 30 on fourth and a couple inches. Remember that one. — Gabriel\nJets are up to 95 yards in this game … and leading 11-10 in the fourth quarter. Either the Broncos offense wakes up, or this team squanders all of the goodwill from beating the Eagles last week.\nIn case you missed it: Aaron Glenn just called a timeout on fourth-and-1 … to punt. — Schubert\nBig attendance (9:58 a.m.): 61,155 being treated to the finest product the NFL has to offer this afternoon at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. — Gabriel\nBroncos’ second half offense: three three-and-outs and a safety. Embarrassing. And compromising a ferocious defense in front of crowd of 61,155. Feels like Denver needs a defensive TD or short field to win this game. Just writing that is embarrassing. — Renck\nThree-and-out (9:56 a.m.): Three plays, 4 yards. Denver has to do better if they want to retake the lead. — Nguyen\nWhere is the Sean Payton who schemed up Nate Adkins for a wide-open touchdown? Someone needs to pull that guy out of afternoon tea.\nThree-and-out and Bo Nix has zero passing yards in the second half. — Schubert\nThird-quarter thoughts — Jets 11, Broncos 10\nLuca Evans, Broncos beat reporter: Anyone who might’ve decided to play “take a shot every time the Broncos get an offensive penalty” would be hilariously drunk before 10 a.m. today in Denver. Either Sean Payton’s offense tightens up, or the defense might have to win a ballgame by themselves.\nParker Gabriel, Broncos beat reporter: Sean Payton’s team is squarely in mess around and find out territory through three quarters. They’ve got 15 minutes to avoid what would be a hideous loss and a wholly unpleasant flight home tonight.\nMatt Schubert, sports editor: Bo Nix and Co. got it done against the Eagles in a (slightly) similar situation last week. Time to do it again across the pond. This is not a loss the Broncos want on their resume. Serious teams do not lose these kinds of games.\nThird-quarter updates\nSacked (9:51 a.m.): Jonathon Cooper and Justin Strnad sack Justin Fields. Six for Denver on the day. — Nguyen\nLittle surprise they overturned that call. Broncos respond with six sacks. Never heard of a team losing a game with six sacks, but Denver seems desperate to try out this theory. Denver had 9 yards on six plays in third quarter. No excuse. Just awful. — Renck\nThe Broncos get absolutely robbed on review of what should’ve been a fumble recovery in Jets territory. Instead, they register sack No. 6. This defense is doing everything it can to save Denver today. — Schubert\nIncomplete (9:50 a.m.): After the review, it was deemed incomplete. — Nguyen\nSomeone please tell me how catching a ball and turning upfield is not a football move. — Schubert\nTurnover? (9:48 a.m.): Pat Surtain II pops the ball out after Garrett Wilson caught the ball. Jonathon Cooper comes down with the fumble recovery. Maybe? It’s being reviewed. — Nguyen\nThree-and-out (9:45 a.m.): When do I start the Stathead search for most sacks by a losing Broncos team? Three and out, and the Jets are getting the ball back. — Schubert\nI am old enough to remember when people thought Ben Powers was a liability. — Gabriel\nRough sequence for Meinerz (9:44 a.m.): First the hold in the end zone, then his attempt at chipping Jermaine Johnson actually dislodged him from McGlinchey and led to the hit on Nix. — Gabriel\nAnother chance (9:43 a.m.): Broncos get the ball back inside their own 20 and really need to make something happen on offense.\nNot to state the obvious, but this is the sort of loss that derails division title hopes. You cannot drop gimme games like this. Even in London. — Schubert\nSacked (9:40 a.m.): Talanoa Hufanga sacks Justin Fields on third down. Punt unit coming out. — Nguyen\nTalanoa Hufanga: Third-down sack.\nFifth of the day for the Broncos defense, which is doing what it can to keep Denver in range despite a slopfest from the other two units. — Gabriel\nWe’re now up to five sacks in a game the Broncos are trailing. — Schubert\nSpecial teams (9:40 a.m.): The Broncos are now trailing a team they’ve outgained 181-82 because special teams has been a negative and the offensive line can’t stop committing penalties. — Schubert\nSafety (9:36 a.m.): A holding call on Garett Bolles in the end zone gives the Jets a safety. And the lead. Jets 11, Broncos 10 with 4:56 to go in the third quarter. — Nguyen\nDISASTER.\nGarret Bolles flagged for holding in the end zone … and suddenly the Jets are leading this game 11-10 after a safety. — Schubert\nQuinn Meinerz gets beat and holds on play. What a mess. Broncos sloppy play has them trailing now. — Renck\nJust not really sure what the Broncos’ offense is doing dropping back and throwing it out of its own end zone to begin with. — Gabriel\nTime to drive (9:33 a.m.): Broncos could use a nice, long drive here. Hardly have been on the field since the 2-minute warning of the first half. — Gabriel\nThe Broncos are going to get this ball back at their 2-yard line. The Jets special teams are having one hell of a game. — Schubert\nDefensive stop (9:31 a.m.): Denver’s defense shuts down the Jets’ drive. Six plays for just 13 yards. Now they’re punting. — Nguyen\nTalanoa Hufanga misses one tackle for loss, but gets it back because … that dude never stops playing. The Jets remain a disaster on third-and-long. Justin Field tried Pat Surtain II, and that’s generally a bad idea. — Schubert\nLet Bo loose (9:28 a.m.): Bo Nix — skipping to huddles, smiling after missed looks — is as loose as he’s ever been mid-game. And yet Broncos’ run game and offensive trickery isn’t working. Strangely, after so much clamoring to run the ball for a few weeks, it seems like Sean Payton needs to just let Nix rip. — Evans\nSpecial teams (9:26 a.m.): Special teams getting a major thumbs down so far today. — Schubert\nFormer Broncos ST assistant Chris Banjo’s Jets units are getting the better of current Broncos STC Darren Rizzi’s so far today. And it’s not particularly close.\nPart of the reason New York is in this game. — Gabriel\nInjury update (9:25 a.m.): Hufanga has a wrist injury but he’s back out there to start this drive. — Gabriel\nThree-and-out (9:23 a.m.): Three plays, 6 yards for Denver on that drive. — Nguyen\nNot entirely sure what Sean Payton’ was thinking with that too-cute third-and-short play call, but zero Jets were fooled. As much as Denver has dominated this game, the Jets now have the ball at their 42 with a chance to go ahead on a field goal. — Schubert\nRunning start (9:22 a.m.): Broncos open their drive with a toss to J.K. Dobbins. Rough day on the ground for him: Eight carries for just 19 yards. — Nguyen\nField goal, Jets (9:17 a.m.): Nick Folk nails the 38-yard field goal. Ten plays for 37 yards on that drive. Broncos 10, Jets 9 with 10:25 to go in the third quarter. — Nguyen\nBroncos letting Jets hang around bc of special team lapses and penalties. — Renck\nBroncos pass rush stops the Jets at the 20. We somehow have a one-point game in London. — Schubert\nOffensive flow (9:14 a.m.): Former Bronco Josh Reynolds just manned up for a first down there and the Jets are marching. For the first time all game, they appear to have a plan on offense. — Schubert\nHalftime thoughts — Broncos 10, Jets 6\nLuca Evans, Broncos reporter: I can’t really muster my thoughts for an end-of-half update because I’m still trying to process what the Jets are doing. But Broncos are only up 10-6 on New York because of continual penalties. Needs to get cleaned up in the second half — and this year in general — for Denver to separate.\nMatt Schubert, sports editor: The Broncos absolutely dominated that first half … and only lead 10-6. Sloppy games like this might work against the Jets, but not a whole lot of other teams. Is Matt Peart really the best option at left guard?\nSecond-quarter updates\nThat was weird (8:57 a.m.): And the Jets just let the clock run out without doing anything on fourth down. — Nguyen\nWhat the hell? — Evans\nWatching Jets offense brings back memories of Broncos in London in 2022. What are they doing? Was that a 2-minute drive or a 200-minute drive. My word. That was straight Nathaniel Hackett level incompetence. — Renck\nIs Nathaniel Hackett still on the Jets’ sideline? — Schubert\nKinda made sense for the Jets to go for it on fourth-and-1 even if you’re playing pretty conservatively because it kept the Broncos from getting another crack with the ball, but man, if you don’t trust your team to even try to get into FG range, you’ve got bigger problems. — Gabriel\nSacked (8:55 a.m.): Nik Bonitto and Zach Allen split that sack on Justin Fields. — Nguyen\nWhy on Earth run a fake-punt 4th-and-1 conversion in your own territory only to run the ball and then hold the ball for a sack the next two plays. — Evans\nFirst down (8:54 a.m.): Jets convert on a fake punt run. — Nguyen\nJets just BARELY convert a fake punt. Very, very risky. Not sure it was worth it either, given what they’ve been doing on offense. — Schubert\nWinner winner (8:49 a.m.): The Jets just awarded a London women’s flag football MVP free tickets to Super Bowl. Hope they let her know they are not playing in game so she decides to make the trip. — Renck\nPenalties (8:48 a.m.): Broncos’ Achilles heel is rearing its ugly head once again.\nHave dominated the Jets today and yet are up 10-6 because of five first-half penalties. Just can’t continue at this rate to truly cement themselves in NFL’s upper echelon. — Evans\nPeart hurts (8:47 a.m.): Jets best defensive player has been Matt Peart. — Renck\nWardrobe malfunction (8:47 a.m.): Talanoa Hufanga doesn’t have an injury, per the Broncos. He had a tape or shoe issue on that third-and-long that caused P.J. Locke to go into the game, but Hufanga was with the team on the sideline and is back in the game now. — Gabriel\nInjury updates (8:46 a.m.): Jets edge Will McDonald being evaluated for a concussion. LB Cam Jones doubtful to return due to a hip injury. — Gabriel\nAnother penalty (8:38 a.m.): Holding on Matt Peart. Again. Third-and-16. — Nguyen\nMatt Peart has third penalty. Yeah that’s, how do they say in proper London English, not good. — Renck\nLotta people thought replacing Ben Powers would be easy or that he wasn’t playing well, but Broncos have been really happy with what he’d done before the biceps injury early this year. — Renck\nPromising drive stalls with back-to-back penalties. This continues to be a problem for Denver. — Schubert\nPenalty (8:37 a.m.): Bad penalty by rookie receiver Pat Bryant. False start on third-and-1. Now it’s third-and-6. — Nguyen\nRun, Bo, run (8:36 a.m.): A 9-yard scramble for the Broncos quarterback. — Nguyen\nNoffense (8:34 a.m.):The Jets are averaging 0.1 yards per play. — Schubert\nSacked (8:31 a.m.): Jonathon Cooper sacks Justin Fields for a 9-yard loss. Fourth down for the Jets. — Nguyen\nCooper absolutely mauls his former Ohio State teammate Justin Fields on a sack. Cooper made huge play vs. Fields in win over Chicago two years ago. — Renck\nBroncos have three sacks on eight Justin Fields drop backs so far. — Gabriel\nBroncos have three sacks. Jets have one yard and six points. — Schubert\nSacked (8:29 a.m.): Justin Fields taken down by Eyioma Uwazurike. — Nguyen\nEwazurike continues to reward Broncos for giving him a second change. Nets a sack, Denver’s second today. Watching Jets offense conjuring memories of Wales vs. England earlier this week. — Renck\nRoster moves (8:25 a.m.): People were clamoring for Jaleel McLaughlin over Tyler Badie, but with Badie inactive today McLaughlin hasn’t yet seen the field and J.K. Dobbins just dropped a third-down swing pass that looked like a good bet at a first down. — Gabriel\nIn J.K. Dobbins’ defense, that throw could’ve been a wee bit better. — Schubert\nThrowaway (8:25 a.m.): That’s an expert throwaway from Bo Nix against the Jets blitz. — Schubert\nRun, Bo, run (8:22 a.m.): Bo Nix keeps it on third-and-2 and then clobbers Jarvis Brownlee Jr. on the end of the play. Brownlee heads to the bench. — Nguyen\nWas that Bo Nix or Cam Skattebo? — Schubert\nHave some. Bo Nix turns corner and lowers shoulder on Brownlee. Haven’t seen that since his early days at Auburn. — Renck\nPass-heavy (8:20 a.m.): Broncos are at 17 dropbacks and 6 called runs so far today. And the longest rush of the day is an 11-yard Bo Nix scramble. — Gabriel\nEngram (8:17 a.m.): Four catches, 30 yards so far. — Nguyen\nDid not see The Evan Engram offense coming across the pond. This is what you get when you sign a Jacksonville Jaguar. — Schubert\nBiggest sign that Joker Evan Engram has arrived in Denver: an end-around on second down. And it WORKED. Bafflingly successful call from Sean Payton. — Evans\nGoing deep (8:16 a.m.): Bo Nix tries going deep to Marvin Mims Jr., but it sails well over his head. — Nguyen\nI would’ve supported Bo Nix taking off and running for 25 yards there. — Schubert\nWhole middle of the field opened up for Nix on that deep shot if he’d have turned down double coverage and taken off running. — Gabriel\nThree-and-out (8:13 a.m.): Really hard to imagine this Jets offense getting into the end zone today. — Schubert\nThe Jets do in fact have a receiver named Garrett Wilson. Take a guess as to why you haven’t heard his name yet.\nRiley Moss does his job opposite Pat Surtain, shadowing Arian Smith on third-down incompletion. Jets don’t have an established WR2 opposite Wilson. — Evans\nRookie watch (8:12 a.m.): Rookie OLB Que Robinson in the game on that third-down pass-rush. — Gabriel\nFirst-quarter thoughts — Broncos 10, Jets 6\nLuca Evans, beat reporter: Bo Nix looks like the guy Sean Payton bragged about this offseason to every national reporter that came through Denver. The Broncos’ defense looks like the unit that every member of that unit has bragged about to every reporter that came through Denver. If the Broncos clean up a few breakdowns, this is a blowout.\nParker Gabriel, beat reporter: If the Broncos’ offense and special teams stop handing New York prime field position over the final three quarters, Sean Payton’s team is going to have a happy flight home.\nTroy Renck, sports columnist: Broncos have 117 yards. Jets have 9 after first quarter. If Denver protects ball this will look like a Payton game vs NFC South, circa 2024.\nMatt Schubert, sports editor: As long as the Broncos can avoid giving short fields to Justin Fields, this game is under control. Bo Nix looks like the Nix of November 2024, and Evan Engram is now a dude. Not a terrible start across the pond.\nFirst-quarter updates\nTouchdown, Broncos (8:06 a.m.): Bo Nix connects with a wide-open Nate Adkins for a 16-yard touchdown. Nine plays for 69 yards on that drive. Broncos 10, Jets 6 to close out the quarter. — Nguyen\nJets just completely dropped coverage on Adkins after Mims motioned to his side pre-snap and showed the bubble screen action.\nBroncos lead, 10-6, at the end of the first quarter. — Gabriel\nBo Nix. Dealing. Past two quarters he’s played we’ve seen him at his absolute best. Sean Payton has said he likes tempo early — Broncos go to it there and Nix delivers a lightning-quick TD drive.\nAdvanced-level dart to Evan Engram, then Nate Adkins wide open for a score. — Evans\nEngram alert (8:06 a.m.): Now Engram up the seam out of the slot. The Jo…. OK, The Cleaner has arrived. — Gabriel\nGoing for it (8:02 a.m.): Engram out of witness protection and making plays in London. — Renck\nAggressive go on fourth-and-5 from Sean Payton and Evan Engram rewards him. — Gabriel\nBig play Evan Engram. That’s what they’re calling him here in Denver. We’ll see if that nickname catches on in London. — Schubert\nNasty move by Evan Engram on a choice route. That’s why the Broncos got him. You can sense the comfort growing in his role. — Evans\nCheering section (8:02 a.m.): Palcho has his own family cheer. Peart has own Bronx cheer. — Renck\nNo McLaughlin (8:02 a.m.): Third-and-16 and it’s J.K. Dobbins in the backfield with Bo Nix. So Jaleel McLaughlin not replacing Tyler Badie one-for-one in terms of role today. — Gabriel\nPenalties (8 a.m.): Two penalties on new Broncos LG Matt Peart already today. First a false start and now a hold. — Gabriel\nPeart Plus: As in, plus yardage in penalties. — Schubert\nTwo first-quarter penalties for LG Matt Peart in filling in for Ben Powers.\nBo Nix recognized the Jets’ ILB blitz and motioned to the left side of the line for protection. But Peart got beat. Not a great start for him. — Evans\nFocused (7:59 a.m.): London Bo Nix looks like the same guy who dissected the Eagles in the fourth quarter last week.\nTerrific mechanics and quick decision-making on the move so far. — Evans\nField goal, Jets (7:54 a.m.): The Jets have 9 total yards and six points. Broncos defense is doing its job. — Schubert\nJets settle for a 41-yard field goal after a four-play, 1-yard drive. Jets 6, Broncos 3 with 4:55 to go in the first. — Nguyen\nNik Bonitto shoves the Jets’ left tackle back into Justin Fields and Zach Allen crunches him from the interior on that third-down floater. Having those two guys next to each other on the Broncos’ defensive line and locked up for four years is nuts. — Evans\nOpportunities (7:53 a.m.): The only way this Jets team is scoring TDs is on short fields. And the Broncos have already obliged them with two in this game. — Schubert\nA 72-yard return for Jets. Rizzi’s special teams work giving off Brock Olivo vibes this season. Good teams win in the margin. #Broncos have to get better. Yielded too long kickoff returns this season, had leverage penalty on a FG that cost them Colts game, and a missed FG. … Need better. — Renck\nHuge return (7:52 a.m.): Kene Nwangwu with a huge 72-yard kick return for the Jets. New York will start at the Denver 24. — Nguyen\nNot sure how the Broncos don’t bring him down at the 30. — Schubert\nField goal, Broncos (7:47 a.m.): Wil Lutz nails a 57-yard field goal to tie the game. Seven plays for 23 yards on that drive. We’re tied up at 3-apiece with 7:03 to go in the first quarter. — Nguyen\nWhat a boot on the Lutz lad. — Gabriel\nFittingly, some expert kicking across the pond. Personally, I would’ve gone for it on fourth-and-5, but I’m also a schmuck who just woke up 45 minutes ago. — Schubert\nIt’s those darned K-balls. — Evans\nLutz nailing 57-yarder makes me think Payton not giving him enough credit. Passed up multiple 55-yard types this season. — Renck\nScreen pass (7:47 a.m.): Can’t tell you how much I don’t like screen passes to Evan Engram. — Schubert\nFirst down (7:44 a.m.): Bo Nix connects with rookie Pat Bryant to give Denver its first first down of the day. — Nguyen\nPat Bryant sighting on third down! — Schubert\nIt was only a matter of time until Pat Bryant started to get more involved as a receiver, with how big of a role he’s had in recent weeks. And Broncos turn to him on third down in his favorite area — the middle of the field. — Evans\nNice return (7:42 a.m.): Mims got caught trying to go horizontal on the first return of the day but knifed up the field there and had a good return out to the 38. — Gabriel\nField goal, Jets (7:39 a.m.): Nick Folk nails the 52-yard field goal to get the Jets on the board first. Four plays for 3 yards on that drive after the lost fumble. Jets 3, Broncos 0 with 11 minutes to go. — Nguyen\nJets gain a grand total of 3 yards on that drive, and get a field goal for their troubles. All things considered, not a bad outcome for the Broncos. — Schubert\nThe Broncos’ defense has been really good when put in adverse situations so far this season. Did the job again there to hold the Jets to a long FG after New York took over on the plus side of midfield. — Gabriel\nWould have to imagine the gameplan for Vance Joseph’s defensive front against Justin Fields and the Jets is much the same as the gameplan against the Eagles: keep strict rush lanes off the edge and keep Fields from escaping. Good job by John Franklin-Myers on second down and the secondary in third-and-long to contain Fields. — Evans\nSacked (7:38 a.m.): John Franklin-Myers sacks Justin Fields. — Nguyen\nRough start (7:36 a.m.): Jarvis Brownlee just got traded to New York in the past week and already makes a big play, stripping Troy Franklin and causing the first turnover of the game on Denver’s first offensive possession. — Gabriel\nNever want to be the team that gives up the first turnover of the season to the Jets. — Schubert\nBroncos first down becomes turnover as Troy Franklin stripped by CB. Only way Broncos lose this game is by giving gifts. — Renck\nCoin toss (7:27 a.m.): Jets won the toss and deferred. Broncos will start with the ball.\nAfter, of course, the national anthem. And hopefully Sean Payton remembers that God Save the King comes after that. — Gabriel\nPre-game updates\nEarly start (7:25 a.m.): We’re really playing football at 7:30 a.m.? — Schubert\nHome-field advantage? (7:16 a.m.): There’s one end zone painted orange. The crowd is legitimately probably 75% Broncos fans. And it’s actually, truly sunny on White Heart Lane. This is like a home game 4,700 miles from home. — Gabriel\nRun defense (7:04 a.m.): Jets RB Breece Hall has given the Broncos fits in the past. TD runs of 62 in 2022 and 72 in 2023 (en route to 177 yards).\nJust 4 yards on 10 carries last year. Denver’s run defense has been mostly solid so far this season, but an interesting challenge today. — Gabriel\nCollege vibe (7:01 a.m.): Will be interesting to see if creating collegiate feel with hotel in middle of nowhere will translate to an urgent start. Broncos would be well served not to play with their food against team seeking first win. — Renck\nO-line (6:53 a.m.): Broncos offensive line left to right in warmups: Garett Bolles, Matt Peart, Luke Wattenberg, Quinn Meinerz, Mike McGlinchey.\nNo surprise Peart’s the next man up with Ben Powers on IR. — Gabriel\nBold statement (6:48 a.m.): Jets fan holds up sign that reads: “No haircut until playoffs.” Will look like Crystal Gayle at this rate. — Renck\nWil Lutz in warmups (6:19 a.m.): Plenty of leg from 51, got it there from 58 and came up a touch short from 61 twice. — Gabriel\nInactives (6:06 a.m.): The Broncos have some changes to their gameday active list today.\nSo, DL Malcolm Roach, RB Jaleel McLaughlin and OLB Que Robinson all set to make their season debuts.\nFull set of inactives:\n- RB Tyler Badie\n- QB Sam Ehlinger (emergency 3rd)\n- OLB Jonah Elliss (shoulder/ribs)\n- OL Frank Crum\n- DL Jordan Jackson\n- DL Sai’Vion Jones\n— Gabriel\nWell traveled (6:04 a.m.): It is very obvious why Colts didn’t want to face Broncos in Munich. Broncos Country travels well. This is a home game for Jets and you would never know it if not for the signage and Jets flags on the backs of seats. — Renck\nGood Colorado morning from London (6:02 a.m.): It’s a chilly day here but no complaints for October in England. Little bit of sun peaking through, even, at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Broncos and Jets on deck.\nThe public address system here is going through the basics of American football. How touchdowns and extra points work, divisional setup and playoff formats, so on and so forth. Pretty great. — Gabriel\nScouting report (5:45 a.m.): Check out how the Broncos match up with the Jets in Luca Evans’ scouting report.\nGame predictions\nParker Gabriel, Broncos writer: Broncos 27, Jets 13.\nIf this game were in Denver or even New Jersey, it’d have the trappings of a trap game. Instead, Sean Payton’s had the distinct privilege of sequestering his team away at a castle-esque outpost in Ware — where?! — a town well north of London proper. The group has had nothing to do but football. They’ll have had no choice but to get the message loud and clear. Plus, one of Payton’s biggest strengths the past two years has been having Denver ready to beat opponents it should beat. This is one of those games. If the Broncos keep Breece Hall bottled up and run the football well themselves, this should be a nice stroll through St. James Park.\nLuca Evans, Broncos writer: Broncos 34, Jets 17\nAfter watching the tape back from Philadelphia, it seems Bo Nix has found something. It seems Sean Payton has found something, too, with his running game. The pieces are set to perfectly align in London against a Jets defense that blitzes all the time but struggles to properly pressure. This could shape up as one of the cleaner and better games of Nix’s young NFL tenure. Joseph’s pass-rush might experience a bit of fatigue after running the same containment game plan two weeks in a row, but this should still be a blowout. Thinking the Jets score a couple times early and once in garbage time.\nTroy Renck, Broncos writer: Broncos 27, Jets 10\nIf the Broncos cannot beat the Jets after knocking off the undefeated Eagles, there is no reason to come back home. The Jets stink. Every fringe fan will be cheering for the Broncos. And they will have reason to get loud as J.K. Dobbins continues chewing up yards and spitting out defenders, freeing up Bo Nix for gash plays on bootlegs. Justin Fields will not be as lucky. Look for Broncos’ defense to produce five sacks, including two for Nik Bonitto, as Broncos continue a trend from last season of smashing the NFL’s dregs.\nSean Keeler, Broncos writer: Broncos 26, Jets 20\nTrap game in cloudy London? Nah. Losing Ben Powers dings Sean Payton’s new ground-and-pound mojo, but probably only a little. Meanwhile, Justin Fields is running for his life and hanging on to his NFL future by a pinkie finger. The Jets rank seventh in opponent sack rate allowed, which plays right into the hands of the NFL’s best pass rush like (British) beans on toast. The only opponent more dangerous than a defending Super Bowl champ is an NFL roster that hasn’t won a game after a month of trying. Unless, of course, that team is the Jets.\nBroncos-Jets NFL Week 6: Must-reads\nHow are Broncos rookies Jahdae Barron, RJ Harvey, 2025 draft class progressing?\nA third of the way into this 2025 season, though, RJ Harvey still has yet to carve out a clearly defined role, receiving just four carries in last weekend’s win over Philadelphia. It’s the overarching theme of this Broncos rookie class: Each pick has flashed potential, and each has made progress. But none — outside of punter Jeremy Crawshaw — have seen consistent opportunity on this 3-2 Broncos team.\nHere’s a look at where each draftee stands heading into Week 6’s London matchup with the Jets. Read Luca Evans’ story.\nRenck: Three years later, Broncos arrive back in London as NFL royalty. Credit owners Greg Penner, Carrie Walton Penner\nThe juxtaposition is striking.\nThree years ago in London, co-owner Greg Penner stood at the Barrowboy and Banker restaurant and supported a hapless coach and defended a washed-up quarterback. The enormity of the challenge and organizational layers of dysfunction were laid bare as Penner awkwardly navigated explanations about a “disappointing” season two months into the new ownership group’s stewardship.\nFriday, Penner comfortably walked up to the microphone at a North London manor and country club, praised the culture established by Sean Payton, beamed with pride over the team’s upset of the Eagles, the franchise’s biggest win since Super Bowl 50, and discussed how the team is prepared to handle goals that extend beyond getting blown out in a first-round playoff game. Read Troy Renck’s column.\nHow night in London reveals Broncos OLB Nik Bonitto’s plan for handling superstardom\nJust three years ago, Nik Bonitto came here as a wayward Broncos rookie. He logged his first sack at Wembley Stadium and celebrated so hard everything “went black,” he said with a laugh this week. Then he returned to having minimal impact, losing playing time and confidence in concert, and wondering exactly how his career might shift out of neutral.\nNow, on his return to London, full-circle moments abound. On Wednesday, Bonitto talked with teammates about that first sack while sitting on a franchise record-tying streak of three straight games of multiple sacks.
