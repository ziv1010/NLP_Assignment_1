(WCJB) - The 2023 Florida football season is mercifully over after unbeaten Florida State beat Florida in a packed swamp on Saturday night. After getting out to a 5 and 2 record, the Gators limped to the finish line with a five-game losing streak that ends the season without a bowl invite. Back-to-back losing seasons now means there is enormous pressure on Coach Billy Napier to show some sign of improvement in year three of his tenure next year with a schedule that on paper is really difficult.\nLet’s be honest here. When Napier was hired, there was general consensus from Gator Nation that he needed time to recruit and rebuild because former Coach Dan Mullen and his staff did not recruit well. But a lot of people have forgotten that sentiment in the wake of a season where the offensive line was often injured and ineffective, the defense was again unable to generate turnovers and was torched by big plays and special teams that often were not special at all. In short, there is a ton of work that needs to be done in a hurry.\nNapier still has a very highly rated recruiting class coming in, but he has to hold it together as other schools look to pluck that talent away with the lure of playing for a winning program or more name, image and likeness money. The transfer portal opens on December 4th and the Gators must hit that hard and often to bring in experienced impact players that will help plug holes right away while at the same time hoping that some of Florida’s better players don’t look to play elsewhere. And Coach Napier needs to do a deep dive evaluation of his entire program and how it is run starting with him. Determine whether or not he should hire an offensive coordinator, an on field special teams coordinator, make staff changes and perhaps changes with strength and conditioning, an area that I believe Florida must totally change to become bigger, faster and stronger to compete in the SEC. That process must start now! It can be done; we have seen what Mike Norvell has done at FSU and Eli Drinkwitz at Missouri to turn around losing seasons with big time ones, but it didn’t happen overnight. It took time but will a frustrated fan base give him that time? The clock is ticking.\nOn a more positive note, do you like what you see early on from the Florida basketball teams? The Gator women seem much improved from a year ago with an infusion of talent and even more talent on the way next year with the signing of not one but two five-star players for coach Kelly Rae Finley. The key here is to better in the SEC. LSU and South Carolina are dominant, but can Florida make more noise outside of those two schools? And Todd Golden has done a heck of a job in retooling his roster with transfers who can play. The Gators needed more length, athleticism, shooting and interior presence and Golden went out and got that and more. Riley Kugel is big time and the cast around him is much better, but they must defend the three ball better, still a problem from a year ago. But these teams should be fun to watch to help gator fans get past a difficult football season.
