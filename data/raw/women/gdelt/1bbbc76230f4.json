In fact there was a 51 per cent surge in round one attendance compared to last year and every single home team outperformed their previous round one numbers.\nBut WNBLs incredible start doesn’t stop there, digital fandom also exploded, with social engagement soaring more than 300 per cent, app installs up 483 per cent and website traffic jumped 617 per cent.\nSticking with the basketball trend, the NBA also tipped off yesterday with two blockbuster games. First it was the defending champs, Oklahoma City Thunder playing host to a stacked Houston Rockets side led by superstar and new recruit Kevin Durant. OKC edged out Houston by one in a double overtime blockbuster.\nThis spectacular match was followed by basketball sensation Stephen Curry’s Golden State Warriors going to war against Lebron James’ Los Angeles Lakers. Unfortunately, for the Lakers, James was absent due to an injury, and to rub salt into the wound, his side was defeated 119-109.\n@espn #nba #basketball #warriors #lakers #espnsocial ♬ original sound – ESPN\nWelcome back to B&T’s Spotlight on Sponsors series, where we break down all the major sponsorship news from inside the sporting world.\nBut it isn’t just basketball season that’s tipping off, with sponsorship numbers not slowing down for a second.\nThis week’s Spotlight on Sponsors features North Melbourne signing a co-major partnership with CHiQ, partnering with Mazda who has been the major sponsor for over 25 years, a busy North Melbourne also extends with Intrepid Travel, Swftyx becomes the first cryptocurrency exchange to sponsor a rugby union club competition, Kookaburra extends its lon standing partnership with Hockey Australia and The Victoria Racing Club and Diageo release new cocktail for the Melbourne Cup.\nNorth Melbourne x CHiQ\nCHiQ has inked a strategic partnership with the North Melbourne Football Club. Over the 2026 and 2027 seasons, CHiQ will be the club’s co-major partner for the AFL and platinum partner for the AFLW. This partnership follows the announcement that Mazda will continue its 25 years of sponsorship, however, as a co-partner.\nAs per CHiQ’s new partnerships, branding will be featured prominently across official playing apparel—bringing CHiQ’s dynamic energy and modern spirit to one of Australia’s most-watched sporting stages.CHiQ also harnesses a successful alliance with the St George Illawarra Dragons rugby league team, marking this step into the AFL a significant one in the brand’s expansion across Australia’s elite sports marketing landscape.\nAs one of Australia’s most influential sporting leagues, the AFL attracts over 152 million viewers annually, boasting a surging commercial value and public engagement. CHiQ’s collaboration with the North Melbourne Football Club further deepens its connection with local communities and its brand presence in the Australian market.\n“CHiQ is a rapidly growing global home appliance brand, already trusted by households across Australia,” said Orry Lack, chief commercial officer of North Melbourne Football Club. “Partnering with a brand of such international calibre is a tremendous milestone for our club. We look forward to growing our partnership together.”\nDavid Esler, marketing director of CHiQ Australia, added, “We’re honoured to join forces with North Melbourne. The determination of the men’s team and the excellence of the women’s program deeply resonate with our brand values. This partnership is not only a celebration of sporting spirit—it’s a meaningful step in forging emotional connections with Australian consumers.”\nOver the next two seasons, CHiQ and North Melbourne will co-launch a series of interactive activations online and offline, with key retail partners across Australia to amplify brand visibility and drive mutual growth.\nSince entering the Australian market in 2018, CHiQ has earned widespread consumer trust through its commitment to quality and innovation, recognised by two respected Australian organisations. Canstar Blue honoured CHiQ as the prestigious Five-star Best Performance Award, and Finder conferred CHiQ’s freezers as Most Reliable, Loved Brand, and Value.\nFrom the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup and Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Europe to Australia’s St George Illawarra Dragons and North Melbourne Kangaroos, CHiQ continues to engage in global sports marketing—connecting with consumers through passion and innovation, showcasing the strength of Chinese home appliance brands to the world.\nNorth Melbourne x Intrepid Travel\nIntrepid Travel will become a prominent feature on the top back of North Melbourne’s AFL and AFLW guernseys for the 2026 and 2027 seasons as part of a two-year partnership extension with the club.\nIntrepid will continue as a platinum partner of the AFL team and co-major partner of the AFLW side in a huge boost for the Kangaroos.\nThe renewal solidifies Intrepid’s position as the official travel and experiences partner of North Melbourne’s AFL and AFLW teams. As the club’s official membership partner, Intrepid will also offer members exclusive deals on travel packages for trips across Australia and the world.\nThis extension comes at a historic time for the Kangaroos, following the club’s recent B Corp certification. As revealed on Tuesday, North Melbourne is the first professional sporting club in Australia to achieve this globally recognised standard for social, community and environmental performance. Intrepid has been a certified B Corp since 2018 and joined the North Melbourne family last year. Senior leaders from Intrepid were there alongside the club at the national B Corp conference on the NSW Central Coast on Monday night, when the announcement was made to over 300 businesses.\nNorth Melbourne chief commercial officer Orry Lack said this shared commitment has been the foundation of this increasingly meaningful partnership.\n“Intrepid Travel first joined us in 2024 in a values-aligned partnership, and this two-year extension shows the powerful synergy between our organisations,” Lack said.\n“Our pursuit of B Corp certification has naturally attracted partners who share that same outlook, and to have Intrepid standing with us as we embark on this new chapter is a great honour.\n“We appreciate the strategic guidance and commitment demonstrated by the Intrepid team, and we’re incredibly excited about the next two years.”\nGeneral manager of sales and marketing ANZ at Intrepid Travel, Yvette Thompson, said the renewal reflected the company’s commitment to partnering with values-aligned brands to drive greater impact.\n“We’re proud to continue our partnership with the Kangaroos. Becoming a B Corp takes time, care and a genuine commitment to doing good—something we share with North Melbourne.\n“Travel, like sport, is all about connection. Whether it’s at Arden Street or on the road, we’re excited to bring our experience-rich small group adventures to the club’s passionate fan base and inspire more North fans to explore the world the Intrepid way.”\nRugby Australia x Swyftx\nSwyftx has agreed a multi-million-dollar deal with Rugby Australia to become the first cryptocurrency exchange to sponsor a rugby union club competition.\nThe Rugby Australia partnership will see Australian cryptocurrency brokerage Swyftx take over as the official naming rights sponsor of both Super Rugby Pacific and the Super Rugby Women’s competitions in Australia until the end of 2027.\nGlobally, sponsorship of sports teams and venue infrastructure by crypto exchanges is now a lucrative business across sports, including F1, soccer, and basketball. The international crypto sports sponsorship market was valued at around USD 565 million (AUD $869 million) in the last financial year and is projected to reach USD 685 million (AUD $ 1.5 billion) in 2025/26.1\nSwyftx is one of Australia’s fastest-growing tech companies. Founded in 2018, it today has 1.5 million customers across Australia, New Zealand and the US.\nThe Rugby Australia deal with Swyftx is believed to be the first crypto sponsorship of a major Rugby Union club competition in histor,y and means Swyftx is now a major sponsor of Rugby Australia, the NRL and AFL Premiership winners, the Brisbane Lions.\nJason Titman, Swyftx CEO, said Super Rugby Pacific was a natural fit for the business. He described the partnership as part of a broader strategy linked to Swyftx’s international expansion. The business is seeking to establish a multi-code footprint that delivers value for sports organisations and their fans.\n“Super Rugby Pacific is one of the great club competitions, and rugby union is one of the great global sports. To be the first exchange to sponsor the game at this level and support its expansion is a huge milestone. We’re delighted to back Rugby Australia’s growth as we approach the 2027 World Cup,” he said.\n“We see sports partnerships as an important way for Swyftx to connect with new fans and say we’re here, and we’re helping Australians to securely embrace a new technology and a new way to build wealth and engage with the financial system.”\nUnder the terms of the new deal, the Swyftx logo will feature on the playing kit of all four Australian clubs in the Swyftx Super Rugby Pacific and all five Swyftx Super Rugby Women’s teams for the next two seasons. The upcoming season commences in February.\nRugby Australia CEO Phil Waugh commented, “We’re delighted to welcome Swyftx to the Australian rugby family with a partnership that will elevate the Super Rugby Pacific and Super Rugby Women’s competitions.”\n“As an Australian business with an expanding global network, Swyftx will help our world-class competitions engage with new and diverse audiences. We look forward to working closely with the Swyftx team to drive some exciting initiatives over the next two seasons.”\nOne in five Australian adults today owns digital assets, with many of those investors having a high affinity to sports. Swyftx has invested tens of millions of dollars over the last three years into codes, including the NRL, AFL, and cricket.\n“There is a natural overlap between sport and crypto,” added Titman. “Both are fast-moving spaces, and our research shows a strong connection between sports fans and digital asset investors.\n“There are several young crypto brands in the market, like Swyftx, that are scaling very quickly, and they understand the importance of investing in rugby and other sports. It’s a competitive market, and you are only going to see more crypto dollars flowing into sport over the next few years.\n“Internationally, football and F1 are among the biggest beneficiaries, with digital asset investment in soccer now accounting for a significant portion of that total.”\nHockey Australia x Kookaburra Sport\nHockey Australia has extended its long-standing partnership with iconic sporting goods brand Kookaburra Sport through to the end of 2027.\nUnder the renewed agreement, Kookaburra Sport will continue as the major partner of the Kookaburras (Australia’s Men’s national team), category partner of the Hockeyroos (Australia’s women’s national team), and the official ball partner of Hockey Australia and the Hockey One League.\nThe extended partnership strengthens the decades-long association with Kookaburra, one of the most recognised names in the sport globally. The partnership will also see the Kookaburra logo proudly featured on the Kookaburras’ playing kit during major international events, including the FIH Pro League, the FIH World Cup, and in the lead-up to the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.\n“Kookaburra and hockey go hand in hand, and their continued support is invaluable. Their commitment to Hockey Australia and the sport is greatly appreciated by our staff, players and fans. Over the next two years, we’ll continue working together to connect more Australians with hockey and create more opportunities for everyone to enjoy the game anywhere, anytime,” said Hockey Australia CEO David Pryles.\nKookaburra Sport was established in Melbourne by Alfred Grace (AG) Thompson in 1890. After 135 years, Kookaburra Sport remains a 100 per cent Australian family-owned business. Fourth and fifth generation members of the Thompson family continue to work atthe head office in Melbourne, with additional offices in India, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, and an agency in South Africa, employing over 200 people globally.\nBrett Elliot, Kookaburra Sport group managing director, added, “We’re thrilled to extend our partnership with Hockey Australia and the Kookaburras. Supporting the game we love—from elite national teams to grassroots hockey clubs across Australia—is a core part of Kookaburra’s identity. We look forward to continuing to play our role in the growth of Australian hockey.”\nThe extension marks a continued legacy of support that will help drive visibility, participation, and performance in hockey from community levels through to the world stage.\nVRC x Diageo\nThe Victoria Racing Club (VRC), in partnership with Diageo, has elevated the spirit of this year’s Melbourne Cup Carnival with the debut of the exclusive ‘Don Julio Golden Gallop’ cocktail, crafted by Australia’s leading bartender and Diageo award winner, Jimmy Irvine.\nTastemakers, style leaders and racing royalty know that every golden moment deserves a golden pour, and the Don Julio Golden Gallop signature serve will be quite the accessory.
