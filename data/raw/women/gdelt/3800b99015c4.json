  "body_text": "WSL predictions: Gameweek 15\n- The WSL returns this weekend after the first international break of 2025\n- Chelsea are still the runaway league leaders while Crystal Palace are rock bottom\n- Manchester City’s visit to Tottenham among standout clashes\nThe first international break of 2025 has come to a close, and the Women’s Super League (WSL) returns this weekend.\nLeaders Chelsea will be hoping to extend their advantage at the top of the table, while the likes of Crystal Palace and Aston Villa are in desperate need of a positive result. With the business end of the season fast approaching, nobody can afford to slip up from this point onwards.\nEverton’s trip to Villa Park and Tottenham’s clash with Manchester City are among the standout fixtures this weekend. Villa will be hoping to create some distance between themselves and the relegation zone, while City desperately need to pick up the pace in the battle for Champions League qualification.\nHere, 90min predicts the outcome of every WSL game this weekend…\nManchester United vs Leicester City\nThe last meeting between these two teams ended in a comfortable 2-0 victory for Manchester United, and this time around should be no different. Leicester City have struggled with consistency this season under Amandine Miquel and find themselves battling at the wrong end of the table.\nUnited, as things stand, are Chelsea's closest challengers in the title race and cannot afford any slip-ups if they are to keep up the pressure. So far, they’ve shown little sign of slowing down.\nPrediction: Manchester United 4-1 Leicester City\nAston Villa vs Everton\nThis is arguably one of the tougher games to call, as just three points currently separate Aston Villa and Everton in the standings. The Toffees are slightly ahead, having won one more game than their opponents this season.\nThe last meeting in January ended in a 1-1 draw, with Rachel Daly’s first-half effort cancelled out by a late equaliser from Veatriki Sarri. It looks set to be another closely contested match, although Villa will have the advantage of playing at home.\nPrediction: Aston Villa 2-2 Everton\nTottenham vs Manchester City\nManchester City have shown signs of slowing down in the title race, slipping to fourth in the table and 12 points behind leaders Chelsea. They've dropped points to Arsenal and United, but apart from a slip-up against Everton before Christmas, they’ve taken care of business against teams lower down the standings.\nTottenham come into this game on the back of a 5-0 drubbing at the hands of Arsenal, and City’s 4-0 win over them in November suggests they have more than enough firepower. It may not be the walkover it was last time, but expect Gareth Taylor's side to take the three points.\nPrediction: Tottenham 2-3 Manchester City\nCrystal Palace vs Liverpool\nCrystal Palace are in desperate need of points as they sit rock-bottom of the table and are at risk of relegation. A string of positive results could transform their fortunes, and Liverpool will be a side they'll be confident of getting something against.\nPalace managed a 1-1 draw with the Merseyside club back in October, and Liverpool’s inconsistency this season shows they aren’t the force they were at this stage last year. Liverpool have looked vulnerable defensively all season and Matt Beard ultimately paid with his job. Palace's Laura Kaminski suffered the same fate, ensuring that there will be two new faces on the touchline this Sunday.\nPrediction: Crystal Palace 1-2 Liverpool\nBrighton vs Chelsea\nWhile Brighton enjoyed a promising start to the season, their recent form suggests they may not have what it takes to go the distance. They'll likely finish among the ‘best of the rest’, but Spurs are hot on their heels for that fifth-place spot.\nIt doesn't help that their next opponent is likely champions Chelsea. While it might be too early to call the title race, it's hard to see anyone catching Sonia Bompastor's side at this stage. They'll continue their hot form this weekend against the Seagulls.\nPrediction: Brighton 0-3 Chelsea\nArsenal vs West Ham\nFinally, Arsenal host West Ham at Meadow Park in the late kick-off on Sunday, hoping to build on their progress under new manager Renee Slegers. The Gunners have looked a completely different team under the Dutch coach after a dismal start to the season, which resulted in Jonas Eidevall’s departure in October.\nArsenal's last meeting with West Ham was their first league match under Slegers and marked the beginning of a fantastic run, in which they've suffered just two defeats across all competitions. They are showing no signs of slowing down, which could make it a long night for Rehanne Skinner's side.",
