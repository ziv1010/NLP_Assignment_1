  "body_text": "Mayor Demings’ touts county successes but still worries\nOrange County Mayor Jerry Demings, whose annual state-of-the-county address Friday focused on recent local success stories, expressed worry afterward that presidential executive orders may hurt international travel and disrupt the region’s tourism-dependent economy.\n“We really don’t know how it’s going to impact our international visitation but suffice it to say that there will be likely some impact on us,” he said, in a post-speech press conference that also included his most extensive comment yet about the possibility of Major League Baseball coming to Central Florida. “We believe, however, our tourism numbers will continue to be strong based upon advance hotel bookings. But as we move closer to the next year, we’ll have to see if those numbers continue to remain strong.”\nThe county’s 6% tax on Orlando hotel rooms, often viewed as a reliable gauge of the tourist industry’s health, has shown no ill effects so far: It took in $40 million in March, the second-highest, one-month total ever, as it charged ahead at a record pace through the first six months of the fiscal year.\nApril data will be released Monday.\nPresident Trump’s latest orders, set to go into effect next week, ban travel to the United States by citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. They also limit travel from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. The orders include some exemptions, including people with existing visas.\nThe orders don’t restrict travel from key markets like Brazil, Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom. But previous Trump administration actions have roiled residents of those countries as well, and some indicators show tourism from Canada in particular has begun to wane.\nThe mayor said his speech theme, Building Better through Efficiency, was appropriate in light of state and federal actions.\n“I do believe Orange County government is going to have to do more with less,” Demings said. “I base that upon the fact that our federal government has created this Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is going to force every subdivision of our nation — from state governments to the local governments — to likely reduce their budgets because of cuts in federal funding.”\nHe said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis launched a state version of DOGE with an eye on reducing the state and local government budgets.\nWhile the governor and state Legislature have yet to finalize a state budget, “all indications are that we’re going to see some reduction in taxation,” Demings said, which could impact Orange County government if sales or property tax revenues are trimmed. “We have challenged our departments, divisions and sub-units in the county to take a look at their budgets to ensure we are spending taxpayer dollars in the most efficient ways.”\n“We strive for perfection, but we’re not there yet, so we’re trying to improve on our efficiency,” he said.\nDuring his speech, Demings lauded the newly opened Epic Universe theme park, saying it “dazzled record-breaking audiences of all ages with its entertaining and immersive five worlds” and he threw flowers to a county permitting office on I-Drive that worked closely with Epic’s build teams.\nMore in U.S.\n“In fact, for Universal alone, Orange County issued 1,500 permits and conducted nearly 34,000 inspections at Epic Universe. By having staff nearby, Orange County saved 300 workdays for these onsite inspections, reviews and customer service,” Demings said.\nHe also praised Orlando’s athletic achievements last year, highlighting the Orlando Pride which capped a 2024 season by winning both the National Women’s Soccer League championship and The NWSL Shield, awarded to the team with the best regular season record.\nBehind him images of the team filled a giant video screen.\nHe cited the success of the Orlando Magic, who made the NBA playoffs, and recognized Pine Hills native and Olympic welterweight Omari “The Banger” Jones, the only American to medal in boxing in the Paris Summer Games, winning bronze. He also said hosting the NFL Pro Bowl has provided an economic boost for the region.\nThe mayor made no mention in his speech of a local effort to bring a major league baseball franchise to Orlando.\nOrlando Dreamers eye county-owned land for potential MLB stadium. Will it work?\nBut afterwards, he said big league baseball is “something worth having a conversation about.”\n“Yes, I have been approached by different ownership groups. It’s really more than one, and so at this point, all of those conversations at a high level. But in order to get down to any seriousness, there has to be some very specific plans, financial plans,” he said. “Those who are talking about bringing Major League Baseball to our community, at this point, they are not prepared. They don’t have details…Our Board of County Commission has not really had a broad conversation about it because it’s premature at this time. It’s just a vision. It’s just a dream.”\nDemings said any discussion must detail how a team will help improve the community.\n“We don’t want to just create an opportunity for billionaires and wealthy people to come in and make money and our community not make money and thrive as a result of that investment,” he said. “Those are conversations that have not been had at this point.”",
