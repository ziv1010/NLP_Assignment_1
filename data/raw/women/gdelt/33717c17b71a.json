It's a pilgrimage for some people,\" he added.\nJunior players representing Italy and Belgium play a game on September 22, 2024. (Photo by Adrian Dennis / AFP)\nThe game's collectability has always been part of its allure, with many people accumulating the finely-painted teams, stands, supporters, floodlights, replica trophies and scoreboards without actually playing.\n\"It's quite cool, you can control the ball and the amount of power with your own hands,\" said spectator and part-time player Harry Brown, 12.\n\"I like how you can paint the players and change the teams,\" he added.\nLockdown boost\nEngland youth player Alex Scott told AFP that he didn't play video games because Subbuteo is \"a lot more fun\".\nA player holds his Subbuteo player close to the badge on his team shirt. (Photo by Adrian Dennis / AFP)\n\"Its the competitiveness and going around different places meeting new people,\" he added.\nHis father, Justin, runs a club in Wolverhampton and was one of many at the event who said they had noticed an increase in members.\n\"A lot of people went into their loft and found their Subbuteo\" during Covid lockdowns, and \"then looked if there was a club when everything reopened,\" he explained.\nThe aim of the game is the same as football, to score more goals then your opponent.\nThis is achieved by flicking the tiny players, who either have a flat or semi-circular base, into the ball and manoeuvering it into goalscoring positions.\nThe team event knockouts (U12s, U16s, U20s, veterans, women and open) at the climax of the tournament took place around the same time as Sunday's Premier League match between Manchester City and Arsenal.\nBut all eyes in the Tunbridge Wells Sports centre were on the 50 bright green 90 x 50 centimetre cloth tables.\nBefore the games, the combatants took their star players out of their ornate wooden boxes, lubricated their bases and set them up in precise formations. After a 10-second countdown, the flick-off began 30 minutes of action.\n'Bloodied hero'\nThe team games consist of four simultaneous individual matches, with huge roars punctuating the general buzz of the spectators, indicating where goals were being scored.\nTensions came close to spilling over on occasion, including when England players took off on a victory dash after scoring a goal against the mighty Italians, only to have it controversially ruled out.\nBut that disappointment was forgotten when \"super\" Bob Varney scored the golden-goal winner in England's veteran semi-final against Belgium, sparking wild celebrations as he was mobbed by dozens of teammates and spectators.\n\"Just remember, it's a children's board game, recommended age group 7-11. It says it on the box,\" Varney had joked to an AFP photographer, moments before his goal.\nVeteran England player Bob Varney's hand, sporting a bandage on September 22, 2024.

It was lost, it's incredible,\" World Cup winner Matteo Ciccarelli, 25, told AFP, with sweat pouring from his brow after winning his final match 4-1.\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
