Hayes left to become the United States women's soccer coach.\nKerr, 30, Chelsea's star goalgetter, is set to face trial after being charged with racially aggravated harassment of a London police officer.\nShe pleaded not guilty to the offence at a court hearing in March, according to the Crown Prosecution Service, and is scheduled to appear at Wimbledon Magistrates Court in February 2025. It follows an alleged incident in January 2023.\nKerr has also been sidelined since sustaining an anterior cruciate ligament injury at the club's warm weather training camp in Morocco in January.\nShe has scored 99 goals in 128 matches since joining Chelsea in 2019, and is her country's all-time record goalscorer with 69 goals in 128 games.\nBompastor, who won seven trophies in her three years in charge of Lyon, begins her new role on July 1.\n\"I am incredibly grateful to join Chelsea Football Club as the head coach of the women's team. It is an institution in English football,\" the former France international said.\n\"I hope to live up to Emma's legacy and continue the work that has been done in recent years. Let the adventure begin.\"\nBompastor's last match in charge of Lyon was a 2-0 defeat to Barcelona on Saturday in the Women's Champions League final. Lyon were seeking a record-extending ninth European trophy.\nBompastor's appointment came on the same day Chelsea announced plans for the \"strategic growth\" of its women's team.\n\"In advance of next season, Chelsea Women will be repositioned so that it sits alongside, rather than beneath, the men's team in a move that heralds a new era for the club,\" a club statement said.\n\"Chelsea Women will therefore have dedicated resources, management and commercial leadership, which will be focused solely on the growth and success of the women's team.\"\nAustralian Associated Press",
