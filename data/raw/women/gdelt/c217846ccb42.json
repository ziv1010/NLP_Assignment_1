Kaipu this time the provider, crossing for Gunemba to double her team’s lead with a close range finish.\nLess than a minute later, Maneu added her side’s third, chipping Seumanutafa from a tight angle to put the result beyond doubt for Hekari United with 45 minutes still to play.\nKaipu scored quickly in the second half, tapping in from close range in the 51st minute as the Avatiu defence failed to clear from the danger zone. She narrowly missed securing her hat-trick two minutes later, shooting wide after being released by Michaelyne Butubu.\nWith an eye on knockout football, Ericson Komeng began to cycle his wider squad into the game, first withdrawing goalscorer Gunemba and then replacing goalkeeper Fidelma Watpore with Zaire Kuyae for her first appearance of the tournament – although she had very little to do.\nRegardless of personnel, his side maintained their intensity and industry, with Kaipu running the channels and marshalling her forward line.\nShe turned provider again in the 80th minute, chasing the ball down her favoured left wing and cutting back for substitute Hortance Kimit to bury past a stranded Kimberley Uini, who replaced had Seumanutafa in nets at half-time.\nKaipu had a final late chance to find her third but Uini denied the talismanic forward with a strong save as the minutes ticked down.\nSecure in the result, Hekari were content to see the game out, maintaining possession and preventing Avatiu from mounting an attack for a consolation goal.\nWith today’s dominant performance, and having only conceded via a penalty so far in the tournament, last year’s runners up became the first team to confirm their place in the semi-finals, sending a warning to their opponents in the process.\nHekari United FC: 5 (Marie KAIPU 7’, 51’, Anashtasia GUNEMBA 43’, Christie MANEU 45’, Hortance KIMIT 80’)\nAvatiu FC: 0\nHT: 3-0\nHekari United’s win in the day’s early fixture meant that there was little room for error for Tafea FC and Henderson Eels. A draw would be enough to guarantee Tafea made the semi-finals, while this was a must-win match for the Eels.\nThe Vanuatuans were the first out the gate and took the lead after just six minutes, as Leimata Simon galloped into the Henderson Eels’ penalty area and cut back to Diana Sine, who stayed onside to tap in from three yards.\nSine then drew a foul, from which Jane Alatoa doubled her side’s lead. Curling a beautiful free-kick through the arms of Betty Sade in the Eels’ goal to put Tafea in control.\nAlatoa was a composed, slick presence throughout the match, with most of Tafea’s attacking opportunities traced back to her close control and canny decision making.\nSuch was her impact, Eels head coach Godfrey Manehioha turned to his bench early to try and contain her, bringing Florence Aretoro on for Mirriam Suimae in the 29th minute in an attempt to stifle Alatoa’s influence.\nShortly after the change Henderson almost conceded a third but for Betty Sade, who snuffed out Simon’s attempt by bravely coming off her line. Henriette Sangul used her speed to fashion a final opportunity for Tafea deep into added time of the first half but Simon headed her cross over the bar.\nHenderson finished the half stronger than they started, but were still unable to unlock Tafea’s defence as they chased a goal to get back into the match.\nHeavy rainfall arrived as the second period began and it seemed to suit the Eels, disrupting Tafea’s preference for keeping the ball on the deck. However, just as the home side thought they might be finding a way back into the game, Tafea struck a decisive third, with Elma Aiviji taking advantage of a half-cleared corner to drill the ball home and all but secure a semi-final place for her team.\nKnowing they needed a large goal difference to make ground on Hekari’s five unanswered strikes earlier in the day and finish above their Papua New Guinea rivals, Tafea pushed on for further goals, with Sangul missing a golden opportunity to score a fourth after beating the offside trap but firing wide on the hour mark.\nIn the end, Tafea had to settle for a 3-0 and second place in Group A. They will discover their semi-final opponents tomorrow when Group B comes to a close.\nHenderson Eels FC: 0\nTafea FC: 3 (Diana SINE 6’, Jane ALATOA 13’, Elma AIVIJI 54’)\nHT: 0-2\nContent Sourced from scoop.co.nz\nOriginal url",
