I'm just scoring against them - what can I say?\n\"Once we go at every game on the front foot from the first whistle, we're really good.\n\"We have to keep going and see where we can raise the level even better, so when we get to that level, we're unstoppable.\"\nHemp and Shaw's 'great' relationship\nThere was a hat-trick of assists for England international Lauren Hemp, who provided the crosses for Shaw's second and third goals - and the City forwards have built a strong bond on and off the pitch.\n\"We've got a great relationship. It helps. It shows with the connection we've got on the pitch. It definitely is like that off the pitch,\" said Hemp.\n\"She's a great laugh and I feel like we've got such a good connection. If I put a bad ball in, she will be the first to tell me.\n\"If she didn't finish one of my crosses, I will be the first to tell her, which is what you need in this squad. We've got a mutual respect.\n\"I always know she's going to be there. Sometimes I don't even need to look up and I know she's going to be there.\"\nHemp and Shaw top the tables for most assists and goals respectively in the WSL this season and they do not look like slowing down.\nCity captain Alex Greenwood says Shaw \"scores when she wants\" and that it is great to see her combining with Hemp so well.\n\"When I stand at the back and I watch them, it's obviously really enjoyable,\" she added.\n\"They speak a lot, they work on things, it's something they talk about quite a lot. They've got a great connection and it showed tonight.\"\n'Self-confidence was lost' by Spurs\nWhile it was an enjoyable evening for Manchester City, it was a night to forget for Tottenham as they were comfortably beaten.\nThere was a catalogue of individual errors, and they were perhaps fortunate not to have conceded even more goals, particularly in the first half.\nSpurs boss Robert Vilahamn says the early goal by Shaw \"killed momentum\" and his side struggled to recover.\n\"Mentally it's really hard - you can see the self-confidence of the players is lost for a while before they come back into the game,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\"We just need to understand how good [City] are in the second half and that we don't give away any more [goals].\n\"It's a mixture of quality as well. The mistakes is something we need to develop - we need to do better actions in some of these situations.\n\"We need to find ways to not concede these goals so easily. Self-confidence is a mixture of performances, so it's a mix of things.\"\nDefender Molly Bartrip said the goal was the worst possible way to start against City and they were then facing an uphill battle.\nBut she added it is on the players to \"question each other\" about why they are making so many errors, which she insisted is \"not good enough\".\n\"Our identity is going to be playing out from the back and it’s something we want to do. I don't think we will change our game in that way,\" she added.\n\"Of course, there’s a time and place for it. If we're not doing it well, then we have to start going longer and stretch the game.\n\"But we are conceding goals way too easily and it's something we need to address.\n\"We have to start analysing it and questioning each other on why these goals have gone it. It's obviously not good enough.\"",
