  "body_text": "THREE years before the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, Nigeria is preparing to repeat its disastrous outing at the last Games. In the Paris 2024 Olympics, Team Nigeria returned empty-handed. The disgrace was writ large with the late release of funds, administrative lapses, and other scandals. President Bola Tinubu should move strategically to save Nigeria from another embarrassment at LA 2028.\nSports have been under the radar after the initial outrage that greeted the Paris Games fiasco. This is the usual pattern: anger, disappointment and noises followed by relative quietude after a major event.\nBut now, Amos Adamu, a former Director-General of the National Sports Commission has reminded the sports authorities to act.\nAdamu, who also headed the defunct Nigeria Football Association as a sole administrator, recently castigated his ex-colleagues for repeating the same mistake. “The same fate can befall us at the next Olympic Games in Los Angeles in the US in 2028 because there is so far no concrete plan on the ground to change the narrative,” he said. “Where would the medals have come from? They don’t buy medals at the Olympics. You plan and work for this over time.” Well said.\nIn sports, three years is a short period. Serious countries have launched preparations beyond the LA Games. So, Tinubu and the NSC DG should move post-haste to initiate a comprehensive programme complete with sustained investment ahead of the next Games.\nThese days, Nigeria has a shortage of budding and experienced athletes. The country used to make waves in boxing, athletics, wrestling, weightlifting and lately, football.\nChidi Imoh, Falilat Ogunkoya, Mary Onyali, David Izonrintei and Peter Konyegwachiewere household names here. That was after Nojim Maiyegun clinched Nigeria’s first medal ever in the Tokyo 1964 Games in the light middleweight category.\nNigeria has fared poorly in the quadrennial Games. It did not win any medal at its maiden outing in Helsinki ’52. The woeful tale continued at the 1956 Melbourne and 1960 Rome Games until Maiyegun rescued the country in Tokyo.\nFrom 1952, Nigeria has attended every Games except Montreal ’76. It led a boycott of the Games in protest of the apartheid regime in South Africa.\nIn all, Nigeria has won just 27 medals since Helsinki: three gold, 11 silver and 13 bronze. This is a paltry return. It will not change significantly in LA 2028 as Adamu observed.\nBarcelona ’92 and Atlanta ’96 have brought the richest rewards to the country. Team Nigeria grabbed a silver medal in the men’s 4x100m relay in Barcelona, and a bronze in the women’s 4x100m relay. It won four medals in Spain.\nNigeria’s first two gold medals arrived at Atlanta with the U23 team (Dream Team) winning the men’s football gold medal. With a leap of 7.12 metres, Chioma Ajunwa grabbed the women’s long jump for Nigeria’s second gold medal and the first individual gold medal by a Nigerian athlete.\nExcept for the Sydney 2000 Games, Nigeria has not won a gold medal again. This is mostly due to meddlesomeness by the Federal Government, poor investment in athlete training and decrepit sports facilities.\nAt London 2012 and Paris 2024, Team Nigeria won no medal. In the 2016 Rio Games, it won only a bronze medal.\nTo be fair, Tinubu has restructured sports administration by scrapping the Ministry of Sports, where novices were appointed ministers. In replacement, he saddled the NSC (under Shehu Dikko) with sports administration. This is a good move.\nIn the 2025 federal budget, Tinubu allocated N78 billion to sports as against the N31 billion approved for 2024. The money should be spent wisely.\nBut it can only bear fruits if the preparationsfor the LA 2028 Games and investment in athletes’ welfare commence immediately.",
