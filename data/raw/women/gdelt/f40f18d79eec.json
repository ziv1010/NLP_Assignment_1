Only one can win.\nSaturday, Feb. 7, 2026 | 2 a.m.\nIn the month leading up to its first All-Star Game last February, the staff of the Pro Volleyball Federation was worn thin. Even for established leagues, All-Star Games are a headache to plan. And as a brand-new league, PVF had to conceive the entire event from scratch.\nThe match would be airing on CBS, the first time a major U.S. network would carry a professional game. How could PVF get viewers to stick around? Not just to the end of the match, but with the sport.\nLanding a random sports celebrity seemed to be PVF’s strategy to hook potential fans. The league had made an offer to former NFL player Rob Gronkowski to host the match. He had a big following and stage presence, but it was like asking Simone Biles to host a men’s lacrosse tournament.\nOn a video call to discuss the plans, Leonard Armato, a longtime sports marketing executive and a consultant for PVF, urged the board of directors to try something else. “Nobody’s going to tune in to watch Gronk, you know, jump around,” he said. “They’re going to tune in because it’s the Pro Volleyball Federation All-Star match, the first ever women’s professional all-star match.”\nThey should consider other options, he argued. “There’s a lot of volleyball dads,” Armato said — LeBron James, Jamie Foxx. “Those are the kind of people we need to try to get. Because they love volleyball, and they have daughters.”\nGronk didn’t work out, but the league ended up hiring different celebrity hosts with no obvious connection to volleyball, either: Jalen Rose, a former NBA player, and Shawn Johnson East, a former Olympic gymnast. The 8,000-person venue in Indianapolis was nearly full, and more than 400,000 people watched at home.\nThe broadcast, in other words, was a success. But would the league be one?\nWhen PVF started in 2024, it was the only traditional professional women’s volleyball league in the United States. But by its sophomore season, PVF had a competitor: League One Volleyball, or LOVB. Both leagues’ new seasons started last month. The competition is down to two leagues, a relief for those in the sport: Last year, there was a possibility of a third league entering the fold.\nEveryone involved in volleyball acknowledges that America cannot sustain multiple leagues. The business of sports is much like a sport itself. There can be only one winner. At one point, there were two major football leagues, two major basketball leagues and two major hockey leagues. All of these stories ended the same way, with one league swallowed by the other.\nHoping for even one successful pro league might seem overly optimistic. Major League Volleyball, which started in the 1980s, lasted less than three years.\nBut industry analysts say that volleyball, which is popular abroad, has the bones of a sport that could become, if not the national pastime, then a national pastime. In 2014, volleyball surpassed basketball as the most popular team sport for high school girls. A 2023 college match in Lincoln, Nebraska, drew 92,003 people, making it the best-attended women’s sporting event in history.\nViewers appear to be tuning in on television, too. Beach volleyball is among the most-watched summer Olympic sports, and viewership of the 2025 NCAA indoor volleyball season was up 36% from the year before, after several years of a steady climb.\nBoosters hope volleyball can be the next WNBA, though both leagues are quick to say they don’t expect this to happen right away. The WNBA was founded almost 30 years ago and only recently began to regularly sell out games. It has yet to turn a profit. It also benefits from its relationship with the NBA.\nVolleyball, on the other hand, is a test case of what happens when the women’s sport comes first, without a male counterpart. The leagues will have to persuade people to care when they might not understand the sport’s rules or lingo.\nBut if they do manage to build volleyball into a major league sport, hundreds of opportunities will open for women who, until now, had to leave the country if they wanted to make a career out of the game they love. And the leagues will be creating not just a new business category but a new cultural force.\n“We intend to be the last one standing,” said Scott Gorsline, the co-chair of PVF’s board.\nLOVB, of course, has the same plan.\nA culture war\nThe two leagues have taken drastically different approaches to building a culture.\nLOVB — pronounced “love,” with a silent B — has attracted a number of celebrity investors, including Kevin Durant, Chelsea Handler, Amy Schumer and Billie Jean King. In July, LOVB announced a partnership with Kim Kardashian’s loungewear company, Skims. “I’ll never forget the day when I saw the images of that Nebraska-Omaha game, and I realized we’ve been sleeping on this,” said Jens Grede, the CEO and co-founder of Skims, referring to the college game in Lincoln with record-setting attendance. The partnership with LOVB followed.\nThe league also has a multimillion-dollar deal with Adidas, which designs its uniforms and merchandise, including a “Volleyball Is the Next Major League” hoodie.\nLOVB’s business strategy is inspired by the European soccer model, where professional teams commonly have a youth sports arm. (LOVB operates more than 75 youth clubs.) Instead of a draft, teams are managed by a central office, and league executives build the teams with a goal of distributing talent in a fair and equitable way.\nThen there’s the branding. Each LOVB team is named after its city — LOVB Houston, LOVB Atlanta — and has an abstract logo. (The league described them as “unique marks built from two or three interconnected letterforms that are recognizable but not necessarily ‘readable.’”)\nRosie Spaulding, president of LOVB’s professional league, argues that its true advantage is neither its celebrity backers nor its built-in youth audience; it’s that the league tends to recruit more experienced athletes than PVF. Months before LOVB’s first match in January 2025, the league announced that it had raised $160 million and had signed 10 of the 17 athletes on the U.S. Olympic roster in Paris. (PVF declined to share its fundraising numbers.)\nOn “Volley Talk,” however, the online chat forum for volleyball fans, many commenters found that between the two leagues, PVF games were more fun to watch: Though its athletes may not be as well known as LOVB’s, PVF understands how to make games into spectacles, leaning more into the familiar trappings of American sports, with large arenas, mascots, halftime performances and T-shirt tosses. It holds a draft each fall for the top college players.\nAll eight teams have fun names, like the Omaha Supernovas or the Atlanta Vibe. And in the first two seasons, PVF teams played for real, material stakes; the championship team won $1 million. LOVB’s champion takes home a sleek, sterling silver trophy designed by Tiffany’s.\nIt’s tempting to label LOVB, with its centralized model, European influences and muted pink branding, as left-coded; and PVF, an old-fashioned American sports league, as right-coded — especially when you learn that for its first couple of years, PVF was propped up by Dan DeVos, a longtime Republican backer, who owns the Grand Rapids Rise with his son Cole. (DeVos’ sister-in-law is Betsy DeVos, who was the secretary of education during the first Trump administration.) When two of the league’s teams — one in Las Vegas and the other in Columbus, Ohio — went stretches with shaky ownership, they got their funding from Dan DeVos.\nThe star-making machine\nMorgan Hentz, 27, who was an alternate for the U.S. Olympic team in 2024, considered joining both leagues. But PVF was starting first, and she didn’t want to wait another year to play at home. “I needed a chance to make a living,” she said.\nHentz played in Germany after college, but the salary was low, and she missed her family. In European volleyball leagues, players often receive about $20,000, along with room and board, for a nine-month season. PVF and LOVB offer a base salary of $60,000, and more than double that for some players.\nBefore PVF’s first season, Hentz reached out to hundreds of players to pitch them on joining the nascent U.S. league. Its original founders were not volleyball people; they didn’t have her connections, and Hentz was intent on making the league work.\n“Coming out of college, there weren’t opportunities to stay and play in the U.S.,” she said. “And now that they’re here, I just want it to last so badly.”\nAfter Caitlin Clark transformed the WNBA with her fame, a general sense emerged that volleyball would need a star or two to achieve cultural relevance.\nIt hasn’t happened yet, but there are only six players on the floor at a time, so TV viewers can easily recognize each one. And a well-known but possibly uncomfortable fact about volleyball players is that they tend to have the kind of look that sells. The official indoor volleyball uniform includes short-shorts, and the unofficial uniform, embraced by many, includes jewelry and makeup.\nGorsline was noncommittal in an interview about whether players’ looks were good for business. “I don’t think it’s a bad thing,” he said, carefully. But Brooke Nuneviller, a top player for the Omaha Supernovas, who has a sponsorship with the jewelry company Gorjana and around 180,000 followers on Instagram, was blunt about the feedback she was getting from some higher-ups. “They say we’re marketable because of the way we look, because of what we wear on the court,” she said.\nA name change\nIn August, PVF announced a name change: Major League Volleyball, the same name as the short-lived league from the 1980s.\nIt was the result of a summer of negotiations: The owners of the Omaha Supernovas — the most successful team in either league — had announced their intention to start yet another competing league they were calling Major League Volleyball, with a supposed $100 million in funding. Now, though, they had agreed to a merger with PVF, but under the name MLV, which everyone agreed sounded more like an established American sports league. The influx of cash meant that the league could transition to a business model that would reduce its dependence on the DeVos family.\nVivek Ranadivé, the chair of the NBA’s Sacramento Kings, had been involved with the upstart league and would now own a team in the MLV. He was the kind of established sports executive who could help the league get to the next level.\nIn its last big social event before the name change, MLV held an awards gala at a Hard Rock Cafe in downtown Vegas to celebrate the end of its season. There was a red carpet at the entrance and a selfie station on the terrace where the athletes took photos in their evening wear.\nFran Flory, then the general manager of the Vegas Thrill, stood at the bar chatting with three season-ticket holders. One of them, Shawna Jaramillo, 53, who works as a mail carrier, started playing volleyball when she was 9. When she heard that Las Vegas would host a professional volleyball team, she screamed and immediately bought season tickets, she said. Her wife and sister were skeptical. They thought it looked boring.\nBut as soon they saw their first match, they fell in love with the sport.\nThey marveled at the speed of it, how the women hit the floor to make a save and, moments later, jumped high to spike the ball. “They play so well together,” said her sister, Denise Jaramillo, who is a full-time caretaker for their elderly parents. Shawna Jaramillo now designs custom Thrill necklaces and pendants.\nThe competition to be the last volleyball league standing shows no sign of abating. MLV has a new team in Dallas this season and plans to start teams in Minnesota, Washington and Northern California for its 2027 season. Its All-Star Game will air on CBS next month. And LOVB is adding three teams for its 2027 season, in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Minnesota. Some of their games this season will air on USA Network and ESPN2.\nFlory said she was among a minority of volleyball people who thought that multiple leagues were good for the sport.\nFlory’s team, the Thrill, will not be playing with the MLV this season because the league couldn’t find an owner. Even though she’s out of a job, Flory remains excited about the future of volleyball.\n“No one makes it professionally without competition,” she said. “Competition is what makes people with money commit.”\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.",
