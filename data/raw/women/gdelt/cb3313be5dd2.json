  "body_text": "This weekend, English football will mark Remembrance Sunday.\nThis is a yearly event, held on the second Sunday each November — the nearest to the 11th of that month, Armistice Day, which marks the anniversary of the end of the First World War in 1918 and is also known as Remembrance Day in the United Kingdom.\nAdvertisement\nIt serves as a reminder of the contribution of the British and Commonwealth armed forces in the two World Wars and other conflicts. But how does the Premier League and English football commemorate the occasion, and why has it become controversial to some?\nWhy are poppies worn?\nDuring the First World War, from 1914 to 1918, the Western European countryside battlefronts were repeatedly bombed and fought over, but bright red Flanders poppies continued to grow.\nA Canadian doctor, John McCrae, wrote the poem “In Flanders Fields” in 1915, shortly after losing a friend in Ypres, Belgium, which inspired the use of the poppy as a symbol of remembrance.\nLast year, the Poppy Appeal distributed 32million poppies and wreaths across the United Kingdom and raised £51.4million ($67.5m) for the Royal British Legion, according to the charity. Formed in 1921, the body first sold poppies on November 11 of that year.\nIs this just a British thing?\nCanada’s Remembrance Day equivalent is Armistice Day, also November 11. Millions of Canadians wear a poppy to mark the occasion and support the Royal Canadian Legion.\nPoppies in Canada, which are made in Toronto, have four petals with a black centre and no leaf, differing from the one used in England but matching the design used in Scotland. The poppy used in England has two petals, a leaf and a black centre.\nThe flower is also used in New Zealand and Australia for ANZAC Day. This takes place on April 25, marking the day that Australian and New Zealand forces first went into action in the First World War, during the Gallipoli Campaign in Turkey. ANZAC stands for Australian and New Zealand Army Corps.\nIn the United States, November 11 is known as Veterans Day, when red, white and blue lapel ribbons, matching the U.S. flag, are more commonly used instead of a poppy.\nAdvertisement\nHow is the occasion marked in English football?\nThe Premier League first introduced the wearing of poppies on the weekend of Remembrance Sunday for all players in November 2012. This year, the majority of players have been wearing poppies on their shirts from October 23 through to November 11, though individuals are free to decide against doing so.\nThese match-worn shirts are signed and then auctioned, with the funds going to the Royal British Legion. Mohamed Salah’s shirt from Liverpool’s 2-0 win against Aston Villa on November 1, in which he scored his 250th goal for the club, was on a £6,667 ($8,776) bid at the time of writing, with two days remaining.\nThe auctions have raised more than £5million in total for the charity, with £483,000 generated in support last season by Premier League clubs.\nManagers also wear poppies on the touchline, including Thomas Tuchel, the German who is currently head coach of the England men’s national team having previously managed Chelsea in 2021 and 2022.\nInternationally, world football’s governing body FIFA fined England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for their use of the poppy to mark Remembrance Day in 2016, deeming it to be a political symbol. A year later, FIFA decided poppies could be worn if both teams and the relevant competition’s organiser agreed before a given match.\nClubs across the United Kingdom play the ‘Last Post’, lay wreaths and observe a minute’s silence before games in the weeks leading up to the day. Many clubs across the English football pyramid, such as Manchester City and Leeds United, have posted on their websites about their Remembrance Day plans for this weekend.\nWhy has it become controversial to some?\nWhile many members of the British military have risked their lives and died in battle, there have also been lives lost at the hands of those same forces.\nAdvertisement\nFormer Premier League players Nemanja Matic, who is from Vrelo in Serbia, and James McClean, born in Derry (officially Londonderry) in Northern Ireland, both decided against wearing the poppy on matchdays due to conflicts their communities had with British units that resulted in casualties.\n“Whilst I have done so previously, on reflection I now don’t feel it is right for me to wear the poppy on my shirt,” wrote Matic on Instagram in 2018, when he played for Manchester United. “I recognise fully why people wear poppies, I totally respect everyone’s right to do so, and I have total sympathy for anyone who has lost loved ones due to conflict.\n“However, for me, it is only a reminder of an attack that I felt personally as a young, frightened 12-year-old boy living in Vrelo as my country was devastated by the bombing of Serbia in 1999.”\nIn some cases, actions of the British armed forces have been described as unjustified. A 2010 UK government inquiry found this was the case on ‘Bloody Sunday’, when British soldiers shot and killed 14 unarmed nationalist protesters in Derry in January 1972.\n“The poppy represents for me an entirely different meaning to what it does for others,” McClean, who now plays for Championship side Wrexham, wrote on Instagram in November last year. “Am I offended by someone wearing a poppy? No, absolutely not, what does offend me, though, is having the poppy try be forced upon me.\n“The poppy, which originally stood for World War I and II, has now been adopted to honour and remember British soldiers who have served in all conflicts throughout the world. That is why I never have and never will wear a poppy. If the poppy’s sole purpose was to honour World War I and II, then I would have no issue wearing it, but that’s not the case.”\nMcClean says he has received death threats over the issue, and his wife, Erin, wrote on Twitter, now X, in 2021: “Why should we have to read messages like that daily for almost a decade? We’ve been spat at, shouted at, and nights out have been ruined by people making remarks towards him. I even remember once someone threatened him, saying they were taking a gun with them to a certain match, and I can still remember watching that match in absolute fear on the TV.”\nLast week, four Republic of Ireland internationals playing in the Women’s Super League in England, Katie McCabe (Arsenal), Caitlin Hayes (Brighton & Hove Albion), Abbie Larkin (Crystal Palace) and Hayley Nolan (London City Lionesses), chose not to have the poppy on their team shirts.",
