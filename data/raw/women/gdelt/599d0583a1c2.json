  "body_text": "The Archbishop of York has sent a good luck message to the Three Lions ahead of Sunday's Euro 2024 final, saying: \"God speed and every blessing to England.\"\nStephen Cottrell has joined the rest of York in sending good luck messages ahead of the big game, which will see England's men take on Spain in the UEFA European Football Championship final at the Olympiastadion in Berlin.\nOllie Watkins' late winner in a dramatic 2-1 victory against the Netherlands on Wednesday, July 10, propelled the team to their second Euros final in as many tournaments.\nNow, the team are hoping to go one further and echo the victory of the Lionesses in 2022 Euros women's final.\nIf successful, Gareth Southgate's men would be the first England men's team to win a major tournament since the famous 4-2 victory over Germany in the 1966 World Cup.\nRemembering that day, the Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell said: \"One of my earliest childhood memories is running into the back garden and reliving England winning the World Cup back in 1966.\n\"Here we are 58 years later and hopefully England are about to win EURO2024.\n\"God speed and every blessing to England as they take on Spain.\"\nYork's newly elected Members of Parliament also backed the England squad.\nRachael Maskell, MP for York Central, donned an England shirt to cheer on Gareth's men.\nShe said: \"The England team have made us proud in reaching the final of the Euros. It’s brilliant how inspiring they are to younger generations.\n\"They once again pulled together as a team and produced a really strong performance against the Netherlands. We’re all excited for the game and I wish them all the best of luck.\"\nThe newly elected Luke Charters, MP for York Outer, added: \"I’m so proud of this team - bring it home on Sunday.\"\nThe Three Lions will take on Spain at 8pm on Sunday.\nWhile the Spaniards have been nearly faultless this tournament, toppling the likes of France, Germany, Italy and Croatia - the English have faced a far scrappier road to the final, seeing two of their three knockout games go to extra time.\nAre you from York and going to the final?
