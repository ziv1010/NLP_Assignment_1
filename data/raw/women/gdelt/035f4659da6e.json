Please include your home address and telephone number below your letter. No attachments. See here for our rules and tips on getting your letter published.\nMIDDLE EAST\nBarney Zwartz’s article (‘This suffering calls me to speak up’, 3/7) neatly summed up my dilemma. As someone who lived in Israel and an ardent Zionist, I feel betrayed by the government of the country I grew up in and loved. Netanyahu’s government appears to be sacrificing the lives of hostages, soldiers and civilians in order to stay in government.\nI hope at the next elections, he and his extremists will be replaced with a government willing to make peace with the proper security conditions and democratic processes for all. This will require international oversight.\nAndrew Easton, Caulfield South\nWhen the pendulum swings\nThank you Barney Zwartz for bringing some realities of the Gazan war, particularly Hamas’ chief goal to turn Western powers against Israel at the expense of its own people, into focus. What should now be common knowledge; namely, the war would end if Hamas releases the remaining hostages and lays down its arms, is largely ignored when the pendulum swings towards vilifying the Jewish state.\nIn fact, in response to the West turning against Israel, Hamas can now demand the establishment of a Palestinian state (no mention of any two state solutions) and with Jerusalem as its capital, before it does anything to alleviate its own people’s suffering.\nHenry Herzog, East St Kilda\nBalfour Declaration misunderstanding\nBarney Zwartz rightly acknowledges that the Gaza situation calls for nuanced responses rather than the ‘self-righteous anger’ of Melbourne keffiyeh-wearing performative protesters. In posing the question as to when the seemingly intractable Middle Eastern conflict between Jews and Palestinians began, he might have cited also the much maligned ‘Balfour Declaration’ of 1917 in which the British government confirmed support for the establishment of a ‘national home’ for the Jewish people.\nToo often forgotten in history is the fact that the declaration also called for safeguarding the civil and religious rights for the Palestinian Arabs, who composed the vast majority of the local population.\nIn 2017, the British government recognised finally that this historic reference to Palestinian political rights had not given sufficient recognition.\nInterestingly, the always prescient Winston Churchill had a century before forecast the tragedy inherent in not giving such due consideration to the declaration’s acknowledgement of Arabs. The misreading of Balfour’s intentions has to this day been arguably a metaphor for the ongoing ignorance and prejudice fostered by malign forces on both sides of the divide.\nJon McMillan, Mornington\nVictory before ending suffering\nBarney Zwartz says he never wrote about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in all his years as religious editor because it had nothing to do with religion. I’m sure Hamas would beg to differ. As far as the terrorist are concerned, the whole reason for their determination to destroy Israel is because, as far as they’re concerned, the land is Islamic.\nThat’s why they are so prepared to sacrifice their own people as human shields and to see civilians suffer, rather than ending the war by surrendering as any organisation with a conscience would do.\nMark Kessel, Caulfield North\nIsrael the Goliath\nI’d like to reassure Barney Zwartz that as a Palestinian sympathiser, I’m far from enraged by his nuanced and heartfelt article. I too, totally abhor Hamas, but I’m with Zwartz in lamenting that “Today Israel is the Goliath, mercilessly hammering a people who simply cannot resist″.\nKevin Burke, Sandringham\nTHE FORUM\nRight to work at home\nThe legislation to enshrine a universal right to work from home two days per week may be well-intentioned, but it shows a worrying disconnect from the realities faced by small, creative, service-based businesses.\nAs a co-director of a 10-person architecture and design practice, we’ve tested hybrid models only to find reduced productivity, increased errors, miscommunication, increased meetings and a breakdown in the in-person culture that drives innovation and quality. We already offer one day of remote work each week, along with flexibility for carer duties and personal commitments – but a mandated entitlement would force us to reconsider that goodwill.\nRather than supporting employees in the way intended, this policy further disadvantages small firms operating under tight margins and quality-driven procurement.\nIn an environment already burdened by inflated salary expectations, undercutting and procurement practices that favour price over quality, the dropped standards and added inefficiencies fuelled by mandated remote work could be terminal for many businesses and increase their exposure to legal risk.\nFlexibility should be earned, not assumed. Let’s not legislate a one-size-fits-all model that compromises performance, accountability and the very future of our small business sector.\nPeta Heffernan, Melbourne\nMore important issues\nRe enshrining ″the right″ to work from home for two days a week. One would have thought that the premier would have enough on her plate with huge debt, tobacco wars, the construction industry being infiltrated by organised crime, youth crime, shortcomings in the child-minding industry etc than worry about increasing the demands of workers over their employers.\nThe ability to work from home is something that many workers would like and, indeed, one that many have. However, employers are trying to run their businesses efficiently. I am sure that if working from home enabled the business to maintain or improve productivity, then an employer would be happy to allow it. Enshrining it in legislation, though? Really? Victorian employers already are faced with considerable costs in this state. They don’t really need another requirement to have over their heads which could easily result in arguments over what is ″practical″. Victorian employers don’t need another unnecessary piece of legislation to make them wonder whether they would be better off in another state.\nShaun Quinn, Yarrawonga\nFree transport too\nRetail assistants, cleaners, gardeners, receptionists and essential service, transport and factory workers are just the tip of the iceberg of workers who cannot ″reasonably″ work from home. Perhaps I am jumping the gun and there will be provision for the ″unreasonable” to be given two days of free public transport, a fuel subsidy or something similar?\nBarb Kingston, Mt Waverley\nReducing productivity\nThe premier’s latest offering to the Victorian workforce shows she has little understanding of small businesses employing 10 persons or fewer that make up 97 per cent of all businesses in Australia.\nThey operate as teams where every employee is needed every day at the workplace for the business to run effectively, and they do not have the flexibility to have an employee or two working from home on days that suit them. This proposal merely divides the workforce in two, with those businesses large or flexible enough to be able to allow employees to work from home against those unable to do this.\nWhile it may suit employees of larger enterprises, it will increase the pressures and concerns on small businesses already struggling to survive. Hardly a move to encourage increased productivity.\nPeter Norman, Glen Iris\nRight to demonstrate\nYour correspondent (Letters, ″Democracy Park″, 3/8) suggests establishing a park somewhere in metropolitan Melbourne to be the only legal place for demonstrations. A nice idea. After all, protests, like children, should be neither seen nor heard.\nThe idea is not consistent with our democratic traditions. A little thought reminds us of how many demonstrations have been a force for good, and even better if governments had listened more often. Aboriginal protests in Melbourne in the 1950s; the protests that saved a section of the old inner rail loop as the romantically named ″Linear Park″; Vietnam moratorium marches; anti-freeway protests; anti-Iraq war marches; demonstrations for women’s safety; the current protests against the slaughter in Gaza – the list goes on. Our problem is not protests; it is that protests are too often needed before our leaders find some moral courage.\nJames McDougall, Fitzroy North\nOngoing trauma\nThe Garma Festival this week has shone a spotlight on our dismal attempts to close the gaping disadvantage experienced by our First Nations people. Do our leaders actually understand the term ″generational trauma″, or is it just a buzz word for them?\nIf we steal a generation of children from the nurture of their family unit and bring them up in institutions where they are exposed to abuse in varying degrees, they will grow up ill equipped to raise their own children, who in turn will pass this trauma to their children.\nPunishing the children of these affected adults is an ineffective way to handle this problem. Governments need to properly fund services that support young families and help them to raise children who are educated and can live satisfying, meaningful lives.\nJan Downing, Hawthorn East\nNAPLAN hysteria\nAs a recently retired teacher, I certainly don’t miss the annual NAPLAN hysteria. With an increasingly complex job, heavy with administrivia, and an expanding curriculum including a non-evidence-based obsession with standardised testing, coupled with a wide range a challenging student behavioural issues, it is becoming extremely difficult to attract and retain teachers.\nHowever, one thing remains constant – that all the input into how to improve outcomes for students comes from a range of consultants, pop-up ″experts″, academics and politicians, rarely from the group charged with their learning: the teachers themselves.\nCraig Jory, Albury\nCost of medicine\nRe Letters, ″Doctor Shortage″ 2/8. It is obscene that people living in small communities expect the same level of health services as those who live in big cities. Unfortunately for country folk, it can’t be the same due to cost effectiveness. Health services in the country that might be accessed a few times a week or fortnight are not going to provide 24-hour, seven-day, fully staffed amenities.\nI recently read about a gentleman who lives in Bega who complained that he had to travel to Canberra for an MRI as this couldn’t be done in his region. If that MRI machine is only used once a month, it is not financially viable – unless he’d like to buy one for the Bega Valley.\nJen Gladstones, North Carlton\nAlgae link\nThere is a strong link, in my opinion, between the terrible algae bloom problems in South Australia and the extremely high level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that is causing the seas to become much hotter. Algae bloom thrives on excessive heat, and the practice of burning fossil fuels by large corporations to create energy continues to release massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\nIt seems obvious to me that the stand-out prime cause of the algae problem is the burning by large corporations of fossil fuels to create energy.\nBrian Measday, Kingswood, SA\nSports bias\nIn one of the great comebacks of the millennium in Aussie sport, the Vixens came from fourth place after scraping in to the finals to defeat the red-hot favourites in the Netball Super League grand final. It was a win for the ages, reminiscent of the Western Bulldogs winning the 2016 AFL premiership.\nBoth memorable grand finals were played within a short walking distance of each other, at the MCG and Rod Laver Arena, to maximum capacity crowds in Australia’s most popular male and female team sports.\nAnd yet, while the AFL grand final was televised free to air nationwide, as no doubt will be the AFLW grand final in 2025, our Super League netball champions were relegated to pay TV.\nThis prevented so many struggling families and pensioners who cannot afford pay TV or cannot easily access a viewing site from watching the most important game of the year.\nIt also reflects the media’s biased attitude towards our premier female team sport. All genuine sports fans should be ashamed of the discrimination against the champion athletes of netball that is so painfully evident in parts of our male-dominated sporting community.\nJohn Bell, Heidelberg Heights\nABC failure\nShame on the ABC for not providing any live coverage of the Super Netball grand final. Despite being the leading female sport in participation, attendances, and TV ratings by some margin, one of its many digital channels could not be spared. Female versions of AFL, NRL, cricket and soccer all manage to be covered, perhaps because they are just that, female versions of male-dominated sports.\nThe ABC prides itself on standing for gender equality, but when it comes to netball, by far the biggest female sport in the country, it fails miserably.\nPeter Heffernan, Balaclava\nAND ANOTHER THING\nJacinta Allan\nAs a retired small business owner, I’d bet the premier wouldn’t last a month if it was her own money at risk.\nBruce Severns, Toorak\nI read Jacinta Allan is ensuring her employees continue to vote for her at the next election by allowing them to stay at home two days a week.\nPeter Gustavsen, Brighton\nWhile Jacinta Allan worries about the traffic, Victorians protest mass murder.\nHans Paas, Castlemaine\nIt’s ironic that our Premier appears more enthusiastic about locking up pro-Palestine protesters than violent, machete-wielding criminals.\nAngela Szalla, Donvale\nFurthermore\nSince 2015, taxpayers have spent more than $13 million managing the lead issue in Broken Hill’ 3/8). Surely, this is the responsibility of the mining companies who have caused the problem, not taxpayers.\nBelinda Burke, Hawthorn\nl think a ban on over 50s using social media should be the group targeted.\nJames Lane, Hampton East\nIt is heartening to learn that Australia’s superannuated politicians turned AUKUS consultants are motivated by the “national interest”.\nBernd Rieve, Brighton\nHow come they don’t have someone like Snoop Dogg at the Logies?\nCraig Tucker, Newport\nI’m surprised Trump wasn’t nominated for a Logie. He’s been ″strutting his stuff‴ on the world stage for months. Still, maybe an Oscar is waiting in the wings.\nMyra Fisher, Brighton East\nIs Donald Trump attempting to emulate medieval monarchs who, when displeased with hearing of news and events not to their liking, commanded their minions ″Off with his head!″\nPam McConnell, Boronia\nAs an avid football follower, I thoroughly enjoyed the Collingwood/Brisbane match on Saturday night. On ABC radio.\nDavid Cayzer, Clifton Hill\nThe opinion newsletter is a weekly wrap of views that will challenge, champion and inform your own. Sign up here.",
