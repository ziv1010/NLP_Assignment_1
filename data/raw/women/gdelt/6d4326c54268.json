However, the latest commission does not include drawing up plans for either revamping the ground itself, nor building an all-new 100,000-capacity home, which is understood to be the club’s current preferred choice.\nFosters’ new role comes less than three months after United revealed that the practice was leading a planned £50 million revamp of the football club’s Carrington Training Complex.\nUnited’s billionaire co-owner Jim Ratcliffe said at the time that ‘fellow Mancunian’ Norman Foster had ‘brought some great inspiration to the [Carrington] design, in conjunction with the Manchester United team’. Work on the new training complex is currently under way.\nAdvertisement\nRatcliffe, who bought a significant stake in the club in February, has called for Old Trafford to become the ‘Wembley of the North’.\nBased on initial feasibility plans drawn up by Populous, Fosters’ masterplan for the area around the club’s main ground in the Salford Quays area aims to create a ‘world-class football destination’ for fans as part of a wider vision which includes homes and workspaces ‘which will benefit the local communit’.\nThe team is now set to carry out ‘substantial engagement with fans’, community members, local authorities and the Old Trafford Regeneration Task Force before drafting up the masterplan design.\nThe stadium itself will not form part of the design work, which will only begin once the club has decided on the development options.\nHowever, the club said a ‘stadium will ultimately sit at the heart’ of the proposals and help act as a catalyst for wider regeneration.\nAdvertisement\nFoster + Partners, which famously worked on the new Wembley stadium, has also been asked to look at how the ‘stadium district’ vision can sit alongside the existing Trafford Wharfside masterplan and the Greater Manchester Combined Authority’s goals for the city region.\nFoster said: ‘As a proud Mancunian, I am passionate about the chance to rebuild on Manchester’s great industrial heritage, creating a vibrant new mixed-use community, served by highly sustainable and improved transport links, providing homes and jobs for the local community, all catalysed by a world-class stadium for the world’s most famous football team – Manchester United.’\nCollette Roche, Manchester United FC’s chief operating officer, added: ‘We’ve a clear vision to transform and revitalise the club-owned land around Old Trafford and we know that Foster + Partners is the best partner to help us develop the plans.\n‘We want this area to become a true destination, that not only provides an unbeatable match-day experience for our fans, but also supports other forms of entertainment, leisure, business and residential facilities surrounding a world-class stadium. Foster has unrivalled experience in delivering projects of this scale and ambition.’\nThe completion of the masterplan will pave the way for the next stage in the journey to create a larger home for the club, speculation about which has been swirling for months.\nA report recently presented to United officials recommended building an all-new stadium, rather than an upgrade of the existing structure, at a cost of around £2 billion. It concluded that refurbishment would cost between £1 billion and £1.2 billion and reduce stadium capacity while works took place.\nThe current stadium, which the club has used since 1910, is already the UK’s second-largest football venue after Wembley.\nOfficials are, however, considering retaining the existing stadium in any future scenario which could be retained and downsized to create a venue for Manchester United women’s team.\nThe recommendation to build an all-new ground was made by a committee announced in March by United, which appointed former captain Gary Neville and Manchester mayor Andy Burnham to the working group.\nNeville, who has overseen projects include Hotel Football and Hodder + Partner’s 43-storey St Michael’s tower scheme in Manchester, has spoken publicly about a preference for a new-build stadium.\nHe wrote on Instagram in 2022: ‘I actually think that it would be the right move. I think by the time that they have spent money on Old Trafford, the existing one, then I think you would be better off building a brand new, better, super-stadium.\nNeville added: ‘I do think that Manchester United should always be at the forefront of stadiums, have the best facilities – and they have fallen behind.’\nSpeaking to the BBC earlier this year, Ratcliffe added that retrofitting the ‘tired’ existing ground could create an 80,000-90,000 seater stadium, but it would ‘not be perfect’.\nRatcliffe continued by telling the broadcaster that a ‘new world-class, state-of-the-art stadium’ could be used to host both England games and FA Cup semi-finals, which are currently played at Wembley.",
