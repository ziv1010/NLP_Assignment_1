The fashion designer captioned her post and explained its relevance to the campaign.\nShe said: \"I was 3 years old in this picture and already experimenting with fashion!!\n\"Our early childhood years are so important to shaping the rest of our lives, which is why I'm supporting @princeandprincessofwales in raising awareness for #ShapingUs and @earlychildhood.\"\nDavid isn't the only England captain to get involved, with both Harry Kane and Leah Williamson joining the campaign.\nTottenham star Harry, 29, who is sporting a striking pair of black and white striped shorts in his picture, wrote: “I’m only 5 in this pic, but look at the right foot ready to go!\n“Our early childhood shapes the rest of our lives. From pregnancy to the age of five, the world around us, the people we meet, and the experiences we have are all #ShapingUs.”\nEngland women’s captain Leah, who led the Lionesses to glory at last summer’s European Championships, is just three and dressed in a fairy costume, complete with a shiny star, in the photograph she shared.\nWilliamson, 25, wrote: “3 years old. Starting to believe in [dizzy emoji]”\nBroadcaster Fearne Cotton, 41, has also got involved by sharing an image of her at about four, wearing denim dungarees and winking at the camera.\nShe adds: “Possibly the age I started to cultivate my own style and love of clothes and definitely the age I started to get super passionate about art and creativity.”\nApart from his musical talents, rapper Professor Green, 39, is also known for his campaigning on mental health and his openness about his own personal struggles.\nThe Read All About It hitmaker, originally from Hackney, east London, chose an image of himself as a toddler riding a bicycle.\nHe wrote: “PG at 3 years old. Little did I know the mischief I’d later get up to while ‘peddlin’ ‘ [winking emoji]\n“Given the start I had in life anyone on the outside could have probably seen me coming a mile off – the unexpected bit was making good.\n“Our early childhood shapes the rest of our lives (all the work I’ve done and I’m still unlocking parts of mine till this day!)”\nChef Jamie Oliver, 47, who has become a household favourite after a series of TV shows and a campaign to improve school dinners, is beaming in his childhood photograph.\nHe wrote: “I was 5 years old here. Check out how happy I look in my brown cords, trackie top and strap-on roller skates! I feel so lucky I had a great childhood, growing up in my mum and dad’s pub.\n“Not only did it give me a thirst for food knowledge, and a passion for pursuing that as a career, it taught me about people and community.”\nFormer Saturdays singer Rochelle Humes is four in her photograph and smiling straight at the camera in a denim outfit.\nShe joked: “I hear double denim is back..ahead of the curve…” and added “our early childhood shapes the rest of our lives.”\nREAD MORE:\n- To read the very best of today’s OK! content from breaking news to Royals and TV - CLICK HERE\n- Katherine Ryan keeps her cool after locking herself out with baby inside in CCTV video\n- 'Molly-Mae's getting grief but Bambi's name is nobody's business!'
