  "body_text": "Meet the Manchester City WAGs in Amazon Prime's Married to the Game - including Mahrez and Gündoğan\nAmazon Prime Video's new docuseries that explores the glamorous lives of Premier League WAGs - including some Greater Manchester names\nThe wives of two Manchester City legends are to star in a new Amazon documentary series that explores the lives of Premier League WAGs. Launching later this month, Prime Video’s Married to the Game will offer unprecedented access to the WAGs’ lives during the summer break, as one season ends and the new transfer window opens.\nThe six-part series will follow the partners of ex-Manchester City footballers İlkay Gündoğan and Riyad Mahrez – as well as those of Arsenal’s Jorginho, Everton’s James Tarkowski and Nottingham Forest’s Matt Turner. The series will see its cast of confident and independent women juggle their own careers and huge social media followings alongside supporting their partners’ all-consuming careers.\nThe WAGs’ lives may look glamorous from the outside, but beneath the glitz they are dealing with the same challenges that affect everyone. Married to the Game will see these women dealing with issues from work/life balance and baby blues to relationship stresses and strains, all under a glaring media spotlight.\nREAD MORE: Amazon customers hail £15 white noise gadget a 'game changer' for anyone who struggles to sleep\nMarried to the Game will premiere on Prime Video on Friday, February 23. It will be available to stream with an Amazon Prime subscription, which usually costs £8.99 a month or £95 a year and comes with a host of benefits like next day delivery, Amazon Music Prime, Deliveroo Plus and free delivery on HelloFresh orders for a year – while Prime Video alone can be joined for £5.99 a month.\nBut TV lovers can sign up today and access all these great benefits absolutely free thanks to Prime’s 30-day free trial. This means loads of great films and shows – including Saltburn, Rylan reality show Hot Mess Summer and Donald Glover’s Mr. and Mrs. Smith series – can be watched without paying a penny.\nHere, we take a closer look at the stars of Married to the Game.\nSara Gündoğan\nSara is married to Barcelona midfielder and former Manchester City captain İlkay Gündoğan. She is described as a whirlwind – bright, animated, opinionated and very funny.\nShe speaks six languages and was formerly a successful model and TV presenter on Italy’s biggest network. Last April, she gave birth to their son, Kais, and is looking to get her modelling career back up and running alongside being a mum.\nSpeaking to Amazon, Sara explained how starring in the documentary gives her the opportunity to show how perceptions of the WAG lifestyle are wrong. She said: “I thought it was a super nice idea, because it was an opportunity for me to show that the general idea of what it's like to be married to a footballer is totally wrong.\n“We don’t just spend all day shopping and buying handbags! Many of us had our own lives before we got married and we’ve tried to keep them going, and it’s nice to be able to show that I’m not a cliché.”\nTaylor Ward\nTaylor is married to former Manchester City winger Riyad Mahrez, who now plays for Saudi Pro League club Al-Ahli. Taylor is the daughter of The Real Housewives of Cheshire star Dawn Ward and ex-Premier League footballer Ashley Ward, so is no stranger to sharing her life with football.\nJust three months after giving birth to her daughter Mila, Taylor created and launched her jewellery brand ‘Astalia’ with her older sister Darby. In addition to growing her brand, Taylor has a wedding to plan and a sudden move to the Middle East to contend with.\n“That’s one of the downfalls of being a footballer,” she said. “One day you think you’ll be in Manchester for another two years and the next you get a call saying you’re off to Saudi the next day.\n“I’ve always had such a strong family unit and amazing friends around me, so I was worried I wouldn’t be able to just pick up the phone and have someone pop around – if I have a problem, you are a six-hour flight away from family support, which is a massive thing when you’ve got a child.”\nSamantha Tarkowski\nSamantha is married to Everton centre-back James Tarkowski. The northern lass is eager to prove she has her own identity, and having recently obtained her personal training qualifications plans to open her own gym to help other women get fit, healthy and be happy.\nMost importantly, she wants to set a good example to her and James’ young daughter, Ivy. Samantha said: “I want her to know that she's very, very lucky to live this life – not everyone gets to live in the house that we live in or get so many toys or go on lovely holidays, so I do want to keep her humble.\"\nCat Harding\nCat is the fiancée of Arsenal midfielder Jorginho. An aspiring singer, Cat loves being the centre of attention and has dreams of recording an album one day.\nAside from music, Cat has a host of ideas she hopes to pursue now that her son Jax is a little older. She has a particular love of fashion and is launching a styling company, ‘Cat Cavelli Curates’ with her best friend Harriet.\n“I set up the business last year and it’s something I’m so passionate about,” Cat said. “I’ve always done a bit of styling over the years but it was after I had my daughter that I felt like I really lost my own sense of style and it took me a while to get it back, and to get my confidence back.\n“It's really important for me to have something that I do outside of the house and something that brings me not just joy, but also confidence and a sense of achievement.”\nAsh Turner\nAsh is the wife of Matt Turner, goalkeeper for Nottingham Forest and the USA National team. The former NFL cheerleader moved with Matt from the States in 2022 heavily pregnant with their first child.\nOne year later and heavily pregnant with their second, Matt received an unexpected transfer from Arsenal to Nottingham Forest, leaving Ash to contend with yet more upheaval. Prior to the move and starting a family, Ash established the Miss Pink Organisation, a thriving non-profit charity supporting women with cancer.\nOn the difference of football’s role in British culture as opposed to American, Ash said: “I feel so grateful to be a part of that – it’s an honour and a privilege to see the fans come together, singing songs, and getting behind the teams. It’s definitely deeper, richer, and very powerful.\n“You also notice there are many more eyes on you – people ask for photos when you walk down the street or just want to have a chat. I got attention as an NFL cheerleader, but this is definitely different.”\nMarried to the Game premieres on Amazon’s Prime Video on Friday, February 23.\nClick here to join Amazon Prime.
