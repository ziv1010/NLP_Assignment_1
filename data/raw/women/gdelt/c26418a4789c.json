It also gave guests a confidential insight into planned upcoming media offerings.\n“The Masked Singer South Africa has made an indelible mark on television viewers and has delivered outstanding returns on investment and conversion rates for those of our clients who cleverly grabbed the sponsorship opportunities ‘sight unseen’ of these flagship programmes on my first mention that we would offer the shows to the market. It’s broadcasting at its very best,” said Lindile Xoko, CEO of Primedia Broadcasting.\n“More than R4 million was paid out in Deal or No Deal. One winner pocketed R250,000 in prize money, allowing him to purchase his first home. We want to make a much-needed difference in the lives of our audiences with our television productions, and this is just the beginning,” Xoko said.\nPrimedia Studios has invested in several more reality competition and game shows, which will be announced in due course and is also about to announce its move into scripted fiction – an obvious next move eagerly anticipated by the industry.\nIn the Primedia Retail and Malls division, the company is dominating the 3D billboard space. Primedia Outdoor grew significantly in the past year due to its extensive digital reach and creative reimagination of the outdoor landscape. In another future-focused feat, Primedia secured and started developing prime virtual real estate in the Metaverse with AfricaRare, Africa’s metaverse.\nPeople moves\nUltimate Media Expands Staff Complement.\n“The radio industry in South Africa is evolving rapidly and we are evolving with it,” said John Walls, managing director at Ultimate Media.\nAs an independent radio agency, Ultimate Media believes they are ideally positioned to fill this growing demand. Which is why they are expanding their staff complement to 34 with the addition of two experienced Client Leads.\nSa’adah Tavira joins as the agency client lead for Johannesburg. Tavira is hugely experienced having spent many successful years at Primedia and is well known in the industry. She is perfectly poised to excel at Ultimate Media.\nWhile the majority of Ultimate Media’s business is agency-led, the launch of their Aggregated Audience Radio Packages has prompted them to appoint a direct client lead. This role will be filled by Tshepang Louw. Louw has had great success in the sales industry and comes with an excellent reputation and a strong track record.\nA further development sees Lerato Letsoalo take over as MD of Barati Media, the government business arm of Ultimate Media. Letsoalo is part owner of this growing agency and will now be fully focused on the public sector radio and audio advertising business.\nJulia Stuart signs off, but won’t be lost to SuperSport viewers\nHaving honed her craft as an award-winning football presenter for eight years at SuperSport, Julia Stuart has landed a plum job at Premier League Productions in the UK.\nHappily, she will continue to be a presence on the Home of Sport as she will present the weekly preview show Team Talks, which is broadcast on SuperSport every Friday (SS Premier League 203, from 7pm).\nEven though Stuart signed off from SuperSport after presenting the recent FIFA Women’s World Cup final, SuperSport remains confident of working with Stuart in future.\n“This is a remarkable opportunity and I’m excited to tackle the new challenge,” she said from London. “Leaving SuperSport was a massive decision and now the irony is it seems like I’ve only really moved channels from 202 to 203 – even though my location and the league I cover has changed completely.”\nStuart earned acclaim for her expertise while at SuperSport, both as an anchor and pitchside reporter on various football properties like the DStv Premiership.\nM+N and Avatar announces key leadership changes.\nM+N has announced significant leadership changes that will drive the company’s continued growth and creative excellence.

When the pandemic brought the events industry to a standstill, CWDi found itself at a crossroads. And so, they opted for a rebirth, which resulted in the emergence of Happy Friday, a creative TTL agency. What’s more, the agency launched as South Africa’s first people-centric agency, determined to make a positive change for its people and revolutionise an industry plagued by a lack of work-life balance.\nHappy Friday’s commitment to the well-being of its team materialised in tangible benefits: 4-and-a-half-day work weeks, 25 leave days, on-call counselling, support for side hustles, and EXCO mentorship. These perks were not arbitrarily chosen; the agency actively listened to its team’s needs through “MD for a Day” sessions.\nThe agency didn’t stop at prioritising its team; it revolutionised client-agency relationships. The “skin-in-the-game” approach, partnering with clients on risk, transformed Happy Friday into a true extension of their businesses. This approach yielded not just trust but also tangible results. So far, the agency has welcomed 14 new clients into the Happy Friday family.\nClient happiness is paramount to Happy Friday, and after sending out client surveys, the agency was ecstatic to receive an average rating of 85/100 on the happiness scale. Furthermore, 30% believe the agency’s service and work quality improved post-rebrand, while 70% feel it has maintained its excellence. A Net Promoter Score of 70 underscores the agency’s client-centric approach.\n“Happy Friday is a true testament and demonstration of when you take care of your people, your people will take care of your business,” says Craig Naicker, co-CEO of Happy Friday.\nTime to act – Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the United Democratic Front\nThe Apartheid Museum will launch TIME TO ACT, the UDF40 exhibition on Heritage Day – Sunday, 24 September.
