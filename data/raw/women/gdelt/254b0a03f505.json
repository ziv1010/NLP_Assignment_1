Whether that was with the new campaign being promoted via the big screens and on the pitchside perimeter for those watching at home, or with the specially-branded matchday programme, the messaging was clear as our new campaign aims for women and girls to access, participate and thrive in football, whilst showing it is a sport where they belong. You can order a copy of the programme here.\nLatest Lionesses legacy caps presented\nThose at Wembley had the chance to celebrate a number of former England women’s internationals, who were being presented with their legacy caps on the night. This included our most-capped women’s player Fara Williams, who scored 40 goals across a remarkable 172 games, and record goalscorer Ellen White, who netted 52 times in 113 games. Toni Duggan, who spent several seasons in Spain, also collected her legacy cap. The 33 year old scored 22 goals in 79 games. Also picking up their caps as special guests of the FA were Clare Wheatley (#115, 1 cap), Jo Potter (#156, 35 caps and 3 goals) and Rachel Williams (#171, 15 caps and four goals). Find out more about the Lionesses legacy here.\nTeam GB Olympic hero in attendance\nGreat Britain’s Olympic Gold medallist Keely Hodgkinson was among the crowd supporting the Lionesses from the Royal Box at Wembley. Not only is Keely, who won gold in the women’s 800 metres race in Paris last summer, a huge football fan but she’s also a former classmate and close friend of England ace Ella Toone who was part of the starting lineup on Wednesday. Keely was introduced to the Wembley crowd before the game.\nFormer USA boss checks in\nThe former USA women’s national team coach, Jill Ellis, was at Wembley to see the game between the current EURO and world champions in her role as FIFA’s chief women’s football officer. Ellis, who was born in England before moving to the USA with her family as a child, is no stranger to the top-level international game having won two World Cup titles with the USWNT in 2015 and 2019 during her five years at the helm. She was joined at Wembley by Sarai Bareman (FIFA Chief of Women's Football), Sara Booth (FIFA Head of Competition, Women's Football) and former FA colleague Kelly Simmons who has also been working for FIFA as a women's competition expert since leaving her role as director of the women’s professional game in 2024.\nMaisie joins FA Chair in Royal Box\nFresh from being named as the Deaf Sports Personality of the Year for 2024, Maisie O’Shea was a guest of FA Chair Debbie Hewitt MBE on Wednesday to watch the game from the Royal Box. The England women’s deaf international is currently in preparation for the World Deaf Championship in Italy this summer. Debbie also welcomed the new president of the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), Rafael Louzán, who was appointed to the role in December.",
