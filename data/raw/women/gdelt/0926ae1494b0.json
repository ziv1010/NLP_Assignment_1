  "body_text": "Good Tuesday morning. This is Rosa Prince with Andrew McDonald at Liberal Democrat conference in Bournemouth.\nDRIVING THE DAY\nTORY CONTEST KICKS OFF: Home Secretary Suella Braverman will fire the starting gun on the next Conservative leadership contest with a barnstorming speech Stateside calling on world leaders to rip up the 70-year-old U.N. Refugee Convention and introduce a migration regime “fit for our modern age.” It’s the stuff of grassroot Tory fantasies, a bold declaration that: “Seeking asylum and seeking better economic prospects are not the same thing.” She’s even brought a TV crew along for the ride.\nLiving her best life: Braverman wakes this morning in the splendid surroundings of the British ambassador’s mansion in Washington — Playbook was there recently and can confirm it’s pretty fab. As she sips a glass of Tropicana and flicks through the press cuttings, it’s easy to imagine the trace of a smile playing on her lips. The home sec’s bold words splash the Mail, Express and Telegraph, which carries a striking full-length portrait of her. Take that, Kemi!\nAmerican pie: The centerpiece of Braverman’s three-day U.S. trip is her speech this afternoon at the American Enterprise Institute, from 3.30 p.m. It marks the first time Braverman has directly taken aim at the 1951 Refugee Convention, although her views on its European counterpart, the ECHR, are well known.\n**A message from Google: Every year Google helps people across the UK collectively make an extra £7 billion from their side projects, using tools like Gmail and YouTube. Read more in our Economic Impact Report 2023.**\nTearing up the rules: In her speech, Braverman says refugees cannot be allowed to “shop around” for safe havens, arguing that the convention is being interpreted as providing a right to asylum to those who face discrimination, rather than the higher bar of persecution. She’ll argue this means as many as 780 million people could in theory be eligible for resettlement.\nIn numbers: The Telegraph says the 780 million figure is made up of an estimate of the numbers who could have a “well-founded fear of being persecuted” on the grounds of race, religion and nationality, added to 89 million forcibly displaced, and 40 million in modern slavery. Braverman will go on to say that “Nobody entering the U.K. by boat from France is fleeing imminent peril,” adding: “There is an argument that they should cease to be treated as refugees when considering the legitimacy of their onward movement.”\nDidn’t get the memo: The reaction from refugee charities is, as might be expected, unenthusiastic. Writing in the, checks notes, Express, Enver Solomon of the Refugee Council says tearing up the Refugee Convention would diminish Britain’s proud postwar record of coming to the aid of those in need. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper adds: “The Home Secretary has given up on fixing the Tories’ asylum chaos at home so now she’s resorting to grandstanding abroad and looking for anyone else to blame.”\nNever mind the haters: Braverman won’t care about the pushback from charities and NGOs — but that broader question of whether her rhetoric will be accompanied by success in actually stopping the boats, one of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s all-important five pledges, becomes ever more pertinent as we hurtle toward the election.\nWhat Suella did next: Braverman will later meet members of U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Attorney General Merrick Garland, for talks on migration and national security. Following her call for social media firms to do more to tackle online child abuse, the home secretary will also visit the U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. And she’ll see work to tackle America’s epidemic of opioid abuse.\nEVERYONE’S A CRITIC: Separately, Braverman was criticized by former Director of Public Prosecutions Ken McDonald over her tweet at the weekend in support of armed Met Police cops who handed in their guns and badges in protest at the prosecution of a colleague accused of murdering Chris Kaba. “I think her intervention was a little unwise, frankly,” given her constitutional position, he told Times Radio.\nALSO IN THE STATES: A newly signed memorandum of understanding (MoU) will allow British aerospace and aviation firms to more easily send engineers to the U.S. state of Washington, Business and Trade Minister Nus Ghani told POLITICO. The U.K. announced the new MoU deal Monday night — the sixth deal with a U.S. state since the start of 2022.\nWashington on your side: The Department for Business and Trade said the deal would ensure “investor intros, trade missions, and increasing access to procurement markets” for the aerospace industry. Seattle, Washington’s largest city, is a major hub for aerospace companies such as Boeing and SpaceX. Other “priority areas” include “clean energy, digital, life sciences, supply chain resilience, agriculture, and innovation.”\nWho’s next? Ghani said the next MoU will likely be with the state of Florida — the home of Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis. The Florida governor met Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch earlier this year during a trip to London.\nEND OF THE LINE\nTRAIN DELAYS — TILL NOVEMBER: What remains of Westminster is still obsessing over the greatest will-they-won’t-they since Rachel dithered over whether to get on the plane to Paris or stay with Ross: the future of HS2. After days of speculation, the Times seems to have been given a full briefing, concluding the project will indeed be scaled back — but with a formal announcement delayed until the Autumn Statement in November.\nHuh? What’s the point in that? It’s hard to make much sense of a Downing Street comms strategy which set a hare running that the Manchester branch of the project would be axed this week, only to stay the execution in the face of a tsunami of criticism. The opposition now numbers — count ’em — two former prime ministers, three ex-chancellors, three current mayors, a former transport secretary or two and, according to the FT, NFL star Tom Brady.\nBut but but: Given how many years these arguments have been playing out, surely No. 10 would have been braced for the backlash.\nAnd why were senior Cabinet ministers — Grant Shapps and Jeremy Hunt — allowed to show ankle in recent days by all but confirming that HS2 was on the chopping block? Especially given that the entire Cabinet was about to decamp for party conference in, where else, Manchester.\nCould it be … cock-up rather than conspiracy? The first sniff of a hint that HS2 was in peril came a fortnight ago, when intrepid Downing Street photographer Steve Back, who tweets as @PoliticalPics, spotted what appeared to be a document relating to the spiraling costs of the project. The story was stood up by the Independent last week, and once out there, ministers such as Shapps and Hunt who faced questions were in a pickle; to their credit neither denied a story they presumably knew by then to be true.\nStill speculation here: No. 10 then had the choice whether to, as with the net-zero retreat on Wednesday, bring forward the announcement that parts of HS2 were due to be iced. After agonizing for a couple of days, it seems a decision has been taken that doing so now, on the eve of a Manchester conference, would be just too toxic.\nAnd so: Making the best of a bad job, the government spin machine has now been let loose, with briefings that Rishi Sunak had become “alarmed” at the spiraling costs and profligacy of the project. The Times says HS2 executives acted like “kids with the golden credit card.” The Mail reports that ministers have known for a couple of years that the business case for HS2 “doesn’t stack up.”\nAll aboard the gravy train: The PM was concerned that there were more than 40 HS2 Ltd. executives paid more than £150,000, with outgoing Chief Executive Mark Thurston trousering £640,000 a year, the Times suggests.\nSweetening the pill: The Guardian reports that Sunak and Hunt will seek to sweeten the pill for Manchester and points further north by reallocating money saved from scrapping the upper reaches of HS2 (and stranding London-bound passengers at Old Oak Common) in other transport projects. This could include Northern Powerhouse Rail between Manchester and Leeds and even a new underground rail station in Manchester, the Times says.\nSneaky move: After the Independent suggested that rather than scrapping the Manchester line altogether Hunt could announce a delay of seven years, the Times points out this would help balance the books by pushing the cost into a new financial period for the purposes of assessment by the Office for Budget Responsibility.\nSee you in 2 months’ time: For more of the same briefing and counter briefing when we do it all over again at the Autumn Statement.\nGOOD NEWS FOR RISHI: Last week’s net-zero reset has reaped rewards at the polls, if not for the planet. A new poll by Deltapoll shows the Labour lead has shrunk by 8 points, with the PM’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol and diesel cars proving something of a winner. The Sun has more.\nALL ABOUT THE EVS: Meanwhile, British trade officials will meet with their EU counterparts Wednesday to discuss post-Brexit tariffs on electric cars, Bloomberg reports. As POLITICO told you earlier this month, a major split has opened up in Brussels over the issue, raising hopes in London that new tariffs could be scrapped.\nRISHI’S RESET: YouGov has done some snap polling on the other measures Sunak is said to be mulling as part of his government reset. The proposal to ban youngsters from buying cigarettes seems the most popular, with 71 percent in favor. Asked for their experience of inheritance tax (which Sunak and Hunt are reported to be mooting axing, only 4 percent said they had paid tax on an inheritance, 23 percent had inherited money without paying tax and 65 percent had never received an inheritance.\nThis might be a goer, Steve: Two-thirds of those polled supported (either strongly or somewhat) fining those who failed to turn up for NHS appointments.\nWATCH YOUR RIGHT FLANK: The New Conservative group of 2017 and 2019 MPs will hold a rally at Tory conference demanding Sunak introduce policies including withdrawal from the ECHR, protecting female-only safe spaces and bringing in tax cuts, the Express’ David Maddox reports.\nLIBERAL DEMOCRAT LAND\nDAVEY DAY … PART II: Lib Dem leader Ed Davey will close his party’s first fall conference in four years with an election rallying call, Andrew McDonald writes — as the Lib Dems coalesce around a blue wall-focused strategy. His speech is at 2.30 p.m.\nSome of those lines: According to pre-released extracts, he’ll argue that “voting Conservative is bad for your health.” The speech will have a healthy dose of focus on … health, as well as the cost of living and how best to get the Tories out. He’ll say: “Britain isn’t working, because the Conservatives aren’t working. They’re more like a bad TV soap opera than a functioning government.”\nAlso in there: Davey will talk about his personal experience as a carer in some depth — and a new Lib Dem health policy, to be announced in the speech, is also expected.\nWhat won’t be in there: Any big calls for Britain to rejoin the EU or much chat about Europe at all. Davey will devote a chunk of the speech to a Europe strategy, but don’t expect anything new. Instead of banging on about Brexit, the Lib Dems are pursuing an ultra-focused strategy aimed at winning a number (more on that in a minute) of seats in the blue wall. Andrew has a big piece on the Lib Dem’s plans here.\nThat’s numberwang: Lib Dem officials have been hesitant to put a number on the party’s aims for the next election, for obvious reasons. Playbook has heard a few numbers tossed about by activists — one said they hoped the party could win 35 to 40 seats, a fair few reckoned doubling would be a great result and another said they dreamed of usurping the SNP as the third-largest party. That would require at least 30 seats, in all likelihood.\nICYMI: The Lib Dem leadership lost out in a bid to scrap its own national housebuilding target. Andrew had more in Monday’s Playbook PM.\nLAST NIGHT AT GLEE CLUB: Activists old and young gathered in a tightly packed (once again, more below) space at the Marriott for Glee Club — the Lib Dems’ big moment to let their hair down and sing strangely remixed ditties about liberalism.\nAs usual: Ears were ringing with songs from the 1900s about Lloyd George, even older laments referencing land reform, and a rather smutty number devoted to Mark Oaten’s unsuccessful 2006 leadership bid (torpedoed after the News of the World revealed he hired a sex worker and … let’s just leave it there). Plus guests were treated to a rousing sing-along of Flower of Scotland led by Scottish MPs and Scottish leader Alex Cole-Hamilton. One Lib Dem attendee said it was like a third divorcee’s wedding get-together.\nThis is democracy manifest: This year’s Glee Club was so popular that a 40-minute queue formed outside, forcing hotel staff to implement a one-in-one-out policy. So far, so good. But as the venue’s toilets were outside, revelers who wanted to relieve themselves had to effectively kick themselves out. Which is less than ideal for any journalists attending for work purposes … or activists consuming a lot of alcohol. Or both.\n**Listen in to what today’s and tomorrow’s leaders are thinking with Power Play, a brand new POLITICO podcast.
