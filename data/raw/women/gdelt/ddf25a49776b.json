How confident are you the club will make it happen and be playing in round one of the BFNL next year?\nBONNIE CAVANAGH: \"We've been through such a long journey in the fact that Broadford is in such a unique location.\n\"I think people forget that we are in the middle of eight different competitions and when we sought to make sure we're in a sustainable competition there are so many factors at play.\n\"We've done a bulk of research and consultation in looking where do we sit in the eco-system because clubs just aren't supported by the archaic systems in place to make these decisions, so we have to do it on our own.\n\"When we went through the process of moving out of Riddell District and going into Outer East (in 2020) we did that to make sure we had sustainable pathways for our junior kids coming through into the senior club.\n\"So I think it's important to first frame the journey we've been on from decisions that have been made in the past.\n\"We ended up going with the Outer East because it had a good connection with our age groups and then COVID hit, the competition went through a restructure and it left us in a space where we needed to make sure we were safeguarding ourselves for a long time.\n\"We had failed applications to join the Kyabram District league due to various interests from club presidents, shall we say, and it has been in us all along to be playing major league football and netball.\n\"We're under no illusions it's a very tough ask for us to come out of recess after a second year and expect to play in a major league competition.\n\"But we feel we've done enough of the research and had the conversations with past players and the right people to be able to say that we'll be able to deliver this product on our terms and we're getting ready to launch into 2026 with a lot of confidence.\n\"I think it's very important to note this hasn't just been an overnight decision; we've been having to determine and shape our future for a number of different factors and we've put in a lot of work over a long period of time to get here.\n\"We've set up working groups, sub-committees, had regular check-ins with our members, life members and past players over a long period of time to demonstrate we have the support and backing to get this up and going.\n\"The netball department hasn't stopped. We're currently competing in the Northern league and playing really good divisional graded netball.\n\"We have a really strong netball department and again have the backing of entering Bendigo in 2026 in terms of going through recruiting, mentors from elite pathways... we've got all that locked away.\n\"Back on the football program, we've got extremely incredible networks that we are working with who are all genuinely excited for us because they see the vision and planning that has gone in to get this off the ground.\n\"We've got to take it in our own time and I understand the nervousness and people not believing it's going to happen. But we're confident that everything we have been building is going to hit 2026 for Bendigo.\"\nHow critical is it to nail this senior coaching appointment?\n\"We don't want to compromise on quality and the fact that we've done the hard yards shall we say... they have got to believe in our strategy and vision because we're not just talking about 2026, it's 2026 and beyond and nurturing our kids who are coming through.\n\"You can't compromise on quality and we won't do it.\"\nThe league several weeks ago indicated a coaching appointment wouldn't be far off. How close could that be now given we're now pushing into mid-June.\n\"We feel we're on the cusp and I totally get that everyone is doubting, asking and wanting to know what's going on.\n\"We are providing a briefing paper to the board for their meetings, we are on the phone regularly giving the league updates, I'm in the president emails, I'm in the presidents meetings, so while it's not the broader community...\n\"At the end of the day, we're always going to get criticised and there's going to be mis-information out there about our process, but we've got a united committee, loyal players and volunteers and passionate supporters, which keeps us focused and motivated - it's an exciting new era for us.\"\nRecruiting is a tough enough caper as is for established teams. How are you going to get the numbers to fill your seniors, reserves and under-18s teams next year?\n\"We do have a working group dedicated solely to this and they meet regularly, but in basic terms, our list of names is long.\n\"We've got multiple avenues to use in terms of recruitment and as you could imagine, we're talking to a lot of people and there's a lot of excitement around it.\n\"This is why the appointment of the coach is so crucial because if you can bring someone who has their own personal brand who can connect with what we're trying to achieve as a club will entice others as well.\n\"We're in a unique spot in terms of being able to connect into Melbourne, along with the Shepparton and Bendigo direction.\n\"We've got fantastic facilities, a club gym that is basically brand new, our oval is amazing, great lighting, two brand new netball showcourts and another two that are being upgraded in time for the 2026 season, new netball changerooms, and our main club changerooms are getting upgraded.\n\"So the whole package that we offer and have been talking to players about is exciting for them. We're a very family-orientated club, there's a lot of kids around too, so it's a very welcoming and a safe space.\"\nYou've obviously got ex-Broadford players scattered through various leagues. What level of commitment have you got from past players willing to return?\n\"They miss the club and we miss them, and that to me is really warming because it speaks to our club culture.\n\"Club culture everywhere gets challenged at times and we've been lucky in my seven years as president that it is honestly a great place to be and we have those players popping their heads in. I think a lot of those players are realising that the way we run the club, they are missing it.\"\nOCTOBER 31, 2024: Broadford's timeframe for BFNL entry confirmed - it's going to be 2026\nOn the topic of culture, the club has obviously had its issues in the past in relation to its reputation, particularly when you go back to its previous days over this way in the Heathcote District league. How do you go about addressing the past when you are asked about it?\n\"Everyone has skeletons in their closet and at what time do you move on?\n\"When I was advocating for the club on behalf of the committee to enter the Bendigo league I spoke about the history of the club and put it on one of the slides for the presidents.\n\"I said this was all 20-something years ago and we've come through and held our ground now in terms of running the club like a business, so we need to create a safe workspace for everyone and we need to create a welcoming environment for anyone who wants to come and visit.\n\"The way we welcome people in is something that we really value and we do get constant compliments around how we do make it a safe and welcoming space.\n\"It's a generational shift and probably not something that really gets spoken about much anymore because of the turnaround that we've had over a long period of time.\n\"We've shifted the dial so much from back then and we just don't compromise on our values and expectations... we don't want to be dealing with bad behaviour, we want to be laser focused on ensuring we offer a warm, fun, safe, inviting environment for everyone of all ages.\"\nThe BFNL has just gone through the years of struggle of Maryborough on and off the field, which has now led to the club departing the competition. While acknowledging this is going to take time to build, what assurances can you give the competition that the league isn't about to embark on a similar situation with Broadford?\n\"We're in a major growth corridor and if you look at our location for a start, we're straight down the Hume from Melbourne and hitting major league country football that people just love to play.\n\"We're in amazing situation where we can offer something that is going to be a long-term sustainable pathway for us.\n\"We've got huge junior numbers; really talented junior footballers and netballers that we have traditionally lost to the Goulburn Valley league because it's just next door.\n\"We're all-in on this commitment and have four key focus areas in our strategic plan: pathways, operations, community connections and leadership/governance.\n\"Everything that we are setting up is to make sure that we don't go in and it just falls over straight away and that's why the pace and decision-making is so crucial.\n\"We're incredibly focused on making sure that we set things up properly - we're serious about giving this a good crack and we're putting every effort into it. It's very exciting.\"\nWhat's the greatest value you feel your club can bring to the BFNL that will improve this competition going forward?\n\"We are so positive about everything we are doing and while we do see a lot of negativity out there and know we'll have our critics and will never please everyone, we believe in what we're doing.\n\"In terms of the value-add that we bring to the league, I know what we have to offer is a club that is professionally run, we really care about our opposition and the visitor's experience and we want them leaving having had a really good time and a great contest.\n\"Our biggest strength is we get involved and we'll bring a crowd... it's literally only an hour away from Bendigo, so we won't be coming over in dribs and drabs, we'll bring a supporter base. I think it's important to note that we're not a basketcase coming in. We're extremely well run and we won't compromise on quality.\"\nHow's the sponsorship and business support for the club ahead of next year?\n\"We've been able to re-establish our Swap Meet, which ran for about 25 years before COVID, so that's one of our major fundraisers. We had that back this year and got a massive response for it.\n\"In terms of other fundraising we've just started doing weekly Bingo with another partner at Kilmore Trackside, so we've got some core ongoing revenue streams.\n\"In terms of sponsorship, we've got a really loyal network of sponsors who see we are doing things for the Broadford community, not just our club, and they are excited about what we've got to offer for next season and we're in constant conversations.\"\nWhat does the return to play committee that is supporting you look like?\n\"We've got the right people involved for the right reasons on our committee and we've been building a really strong cohort of committee members.\n\"We've got really good mix of men and women, young and older generations, life members, new players and past players and we've assigned portfolios according to their skills, strength and passions. We've got a really good cross-section of people.\"\nHow important will it be to potentially get some assistance from the BFNL, whether it be additional player points or salary cap, to give you the best possible chance to field a competitive side next year?\n\"We've indicated that we're going to potentially require some assistance in that space and it has been briefly noted at a presidents meeting.\n\"We've been very open and transparent that we may need assistance to get this happening, but again, it comes back to wanting to set up something that is sustainable.\"\nYou look back through the history of the club over 140-odd years and Broadford has come and gone from a lot of different leagues. What's your level of confidence the BFNL will be home for Broadford for a sustained period?\n\"It's extremely high and it already feels through our research and conversations like, 'why didn't we try this before?'\n\"As I said earlier, if you're sitting centric to eight leagues, one is metro, one is country, one has netball on a Friday, one has netball on a Saturday and so on... to me we've got everything in place to make this happen and we're excited by becoming part of this Bendigo league community\n\"I just urge everyone to really get to know us, embrace us. We were facing the same apprehension when we went into the Outer East and within 12 months we were having opposition clubs join our functions.\n\"Those clubs took to us straight away because we are a warm country club and I just really want people to give us a go - that's all we can ask for.\"",
