Town were initially able to regain possession but dithered on the ball and were almost caught out wide of their area, eventually drawing a foul to get themselves out of trouble.\nOn 42 Dean looked to break forward on the left but the referee brought a halt to play following a clash of heads between two Saints players and Thomas. When play did resume the Blues striker was able to take a speculative shot from distance but Goddard was able to head clear from the edge of the Southampton box.\nIn the first of five additional minutes Southampton made it 3-0, again from a corner, with Mary Bashford heading home at the near post.\nThe Saints almost added a fourth before the break with Megan Collett going through on goal, but Negri was able to come out and go low to close the angle and force the right-back out wide.\nSouthampton continued their dominant display from the restart, Negri called into action in the first minute to save an attempt following a scramble in the Town area.\nOn 51 the Blues won a corner after some good offensive play from Thomas, but Stenson was able to punch the deep effort well clear.\nFour minutes later, Saints substitute Ruby-Rae Tucker was able to latch on to a through ball but could only shoot well wide.\nImmediately after, Sheehan made his first changes of the game by bringing off Robertson and O’Brien and handing debuts to Ruby Doe (her third for the club and first since signing permanently) and Jenna Dear.\nTwo minutes later, however, Southampton scored their fourth goal and ended any remaining faint, lingering hopes. A Saints corner was not fully dealt with by the Town defence and Negri appeared to be caught napping by an effort back into the box, only being able to tip the ball towards her back post for Bashford to tap in her second goal of the afternoon.\nSouthampton were content to see the remaining 30 minutes out but almost created another chance on 62 when Goddard was able to head the ball back across goal from a long ball in, Town’s blushes spared by an offside call from the assistant referee.\nSix minutes later, Dean was able to catch Stenson’s short pass out from the back, but the home side were quick to smother the Blues forward before she could make any meaningful attempt on goal.\nIn the 72nd minute, Dean was again in a dangerous area in the Southampton box but lost the ball before being able to pull the trigger. On first viewing, Ipswich’s claims for a penalty seemed well-founded, but on replay it was apparent it was a well-timed challenge to take the ball away from Dean before she could get her shot away.\nOn 75 Sheehan made a further change, removing Dean and giving Maddy Earl her debut for Ipswich Town having joined the club on loan from Arsenal on deadline day. On 82 Jenna Dear was able to shoot from just outside the box but her effort was well wide.\nWith the game petering out, Town fans were treated to a trademark Sophie Peskett drive down the right flank on in the second minute of injury time but her cross into the box was nowhere near a blue shirt. The referee brought proceedings to an end shortly after.\nIn an eerie parallel to the men’s team’s experience in the Premier League last season, Ipswich Town Women struggled with the step up against the physicality and speed of an established WSL2 side and not having the majority of possession as they had been accustomed to in the third tier.\nAlthough the Blues had 10 shots to Southampton’s 11, none were on target and no big chances were created. Ipswich also struggled with set pieces, conceding two goals directly from corners and another from the second phase of play following a set piece.\nAlthough there were some bright moments offensively from the Blues, Saints keeper Stenson was never really troubled by any of Town’s attacking players.\nThe result sees Town at the foot of the WSL2 table with last season’s bottom team Sheffield United, who also lost 4-0 to Sunderland in their opening game of the season last night.\nTown return to WSL2 action next weekend, playing their first home game at the Jobserve Community Stadium in Colchester against fellow newly promoted side and last season’s FA WNL Cup winners Nottingham Forest, who kick-off their campaign tomorrow with a home fixture against Newcastle United.\nTown: Negri, Neville, Boswell, Peake, Roe, Robertson (Doe 55), Mitchell, Peskett, O’Brien (Dear 55), Thomas, Dean (Earl 75).
