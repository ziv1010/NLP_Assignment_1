  "body_text": "Royals fly equivalent of twice around the world in helicopters\nTwo new royal helicopters that came into service earlier this year have already flown a total of 58,000 miles – the equivalent of travelling twice around the Earth.\nThe AgustaWestland AW139s, used by senior members of the Royal family in the UK, racked up 420 hours of flying time between Feb 25 and the end of November.\nThe Princess Royal, who consistently carries out many public engagements all year, appears to have made the most use of the new aircraft, with her Gatcombe Park home in Gloucestershire the most frequently visited destination with 68 stops, according to flight data.\nThe Prince of Wales, who has made the environment a key plank of his work, has also proved an enthusiastic user of the new fleet, with 47 stops made in Windsor and a further five at Forest Lodge, the family home he moved into in October.\nThe data suggests the Prince flew by helicopter to multiple jobs each month, including a referee training course in Walsall, a women’s rugby match in Exeter, a visit to the England women’s football team at their training base in Staffordshire, a Homewards job in Sheffield and an Earthshot job in Norwich.\nOn Nov 25, one royal helicopter flew just under 500 miles, from its RAF Odiham base to Forest Lodge, before taking the Prince to his first stop in Wales, then onto Hawarden Airport, then Llandudno South before flying back to Forest Lodge and back to base.\nWhen the Princess of Wales visited a wellbeing garden at Colchester Hospital on July 2, her helicopter made seven separate journeys totalling 390 miles: from its base at RAF Odiham to Windsor, then on to Merville Barracks in Colchester and from Merville Barracks to Anmer Hall, the Prince and Princess’s private residence in Norfolk.\nAfter what appears to have been a refuelling stop at RAF Marham, it flew back to Windsor two and a half hours later, and finally, on to its base at Odiham.\nb'\n'\nOn Armistice Day, when the Princess laid a wreath at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, the helicopter flew from RAF Odiham to Forest Lodge, then onto Staffordshire and back the way it had come.\nThe Prince and Princess together travelled by helicopter to various joint engagements, including one at the Principality Stadium, Cardiff, where they watched a Six Nations match, one in Southport, where they met families bereaved in the 2024 knife attack and a visit to the Scottish islands in April.\nThe Prince also makes a point of travelling by public train, and is often photographed in his seat or at the station.\nHe travelled to Birmingham by train in January last year to attend a paramedic conference and to Liverpool, where he chatted to passengers in a first-class carriage.\nThe following month, he went to Poole, Dorset, by train for a Homewards job. On Feb 26, the Prince and Princess travelled to Pontypridd by train to celebrate St David’s Day.\nb'\n'\nBuckingham Palace has said that the King is “pretty allergic” to travelling by helicopter and would always “raise an eyebrow” and object when the mode of transport was suggested.\nIt was said in 2022 that such aircraft were considered only if every other option failed, but sources acknowledge that the position has changed.\nIt was announced in June 2024 that the Royal household was to take delivery of two new leased helicopters to replace two 15-year-old Sikorsky aircraft and was committed to maximising their use.\nAides said they would help reduce reliance on expensive fixed-wing travel and increase the household’s ability to utilise Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as they operate with the maximum industry standard of 50 per cent.\nTim Fauchon, the chief executive of the British Helicopter Association (BHA), said the King was “leading by example” when it came to using the greenest forms of aviation.\nExplaining that the King’s flight crew are members of the BHA, Mr Fauchon said it was common knowledge among the association that the flight “actively seeks out” airports which can supply SAF for its operations.\n“I know full well the Royal Flight do look for a blend,” he added.\n“You’ve got to appreciate it comes as an expense... but the helicopter industry is very forward-leaning on doing the (regulatory) clearances for SAF.”\nFlight data analysed by The Telegraph reveals that between them, the two new aircraft made around 340 trips over nine months, if journeys with stops of one hour or more are treated as separate trips.\nIf this stopping time is reduced to ten minutes or less, the number of trips rises to around 700.\nThe choppers made 45 stops at Kensington Palace, 32 at Bagshot Park, home to the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh and 14 at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh.\nThere were 14 stops in Lacock, Wiltshire, near the Queen’s private home, 11 at Sandringham, six at Dumfries House, home to the King’s Foundation, and five at Buckingham Palace.\nb'\n'\nSince they came into use on Feb 25, one or the other flew on 142 out of the 279 days until Nov 30 – equivalent to almost every other day.\nThe longest individual leg by distance was a 372-mile flight from Dundee back to the RAF Odiham base on May 23. Over the previous two days, the chopper had been bouncing between various Scottish locations, including Dumfries House, the headquarters of the King’s Foundation, in Ayrshire.\nThe furthest distance travelled in a single day was 941 miles, when one of the helicopters shuttled from Leuchars in Scotland over to Campbeltown, then back down to RAF Odiham via Prestwick and Edinburgh, on July 3.\nOn that day, the King was carrying out various engagements celebrating Scottish culture and community as part of the annual Holyrood Week.\nThe shortest trip took place when the Princess Royal was visiting the Channel Islands on May 10.\nOne of the helicopters flew from Guernsey to Sark, first landing in a small field to its south before then taking off again and flying just 1.9 miles to the centre of the island.\nThe aircraft landed less than seven minutes later in a field, for just over three hours, before taking the Princess back to her Gatcombe Park home.\nThe cost of royal travel is covered by the Sovereign Grant, an annual payment to support official duties, which is pegged to the profits from the Crown estate.\nIn 2025-26, the grant increased to £132.1m from £86.3m the previous year.\nAn aide said last year that helicopters were “a very important tool”, allowing the King and other members of the family to be “seen throughout the length and breadth of the UK”.\nAsked whether helicopter use should be reduced, the official said: “If you’re going to make an investment of that magnitude, then you need to sweat the asset.\n“So, therefore, you need to maximise the utilisation of the aircraft otherwise you end up in a situation whereby a small number of visits, compared to the cost of running those assets, it does not make good financial sense.”\nThe annual Sovereign Grant details only journeys that cost £17,000 or more. The most recent report, published in June, listed only four such journeys in the last financial year, wrapping the cost in with linked charter flights.\nBut it revealed that a further 141 helicopter journeys were made over the 12 months, costing £475,290.\nThe previous year, no flights costing more than £17,000 were declared but 170 helicopter journeys were taken, at a cost of almost £1.1m.\nA Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “Helicopters are a key component of the royal travel plan due to their unique capability to access remote regions of the UK which are not otherwise readily served by other modes of transport.\n“They also allow members of the Royal family to undertake multiple engagements in a given day.”",
