  "body_text": "The fans at Highmark Stadium in Buffalo did not receive high marks from this journalist on Sunday night.\nLike many watching the Sunday night football game between the Baltimore Ravens and Buffalo Bills, I was shocked and appalled when NBC showed fans leaving the Bills home stadium — in its last year of existence after five decades. The weather wasn’t too bad at the venue and the hometown Bills were only down 15 points — or two scores — with about seven minutes to play.\nThis wasn’t a bad Bills team, considered a major contender to win the Super Bowl. However, fans that are likely season ticket holders and paid an average price of more than $1,000 for the year, still left early.\nYou probably know what happened next.\nThe Bills scored two more touchdowns, then forced a great Baltimore team to a three-and-out before kicking the winning field goal as time expired. The game was immediately called an instant classic.\nWhich is why you never, ever, ever, ever, ever leave a game early unless you’re feeling unhealthy or in the case of a Philadelphia fan, too drunk.\nSo that’s my first tip to all sports fans as another week begins with big-time local high school games, as well as college and professional contests in baseball, football and basketball.\nDon’t. Leave. Early.\nMeanwhile, here’s a guide of when to show up or plop yourself down on the couch to watch what could be some more instant classics.\nLocal sports\nAfter a week in which it seemed most Solano County football teams were on the road, this week it seems as if they are all at home. Two games will be played at Corbus Field this weekend and Benicia travels just a few miles away to visit old Solano County Athletic Conference rival American Canyon.\nSpeaking of never leaving early, that’s exactly what Jesse Bethel did in 2024. Even after losing its first six games of the season last year, the Jaguars showed grit, instead of throwing helmets on the sideline and complaining, they got down to business, won the three games that really mattered and made the postseason.\nThis year the Jaguars only waited until their second game of the year to pick up a win, a victory over a young ELITE team last Thursday. Bethel will have extra rest when it takes on Pinole Valley. Bethel is hoping that quarterback Kylen McNeal can have another big game. He rushed for five touchdowns and threw for more than 100 yards in last week’s victory.\nELITE, which lost to Bethel last week, is hoping for better luck against Vallejo High on Saturday night (6 p.m. start time) when the squads meet at Corbus Field. Vallejo is 1-1 and is playing at home for the first time this year. Julio Ramirez threw a game-winning touchdown to help the Redhawks defeat Highlands in Week 1, but they lost in Week 2 against a tough Mt. Diablo squad.\nSt. Patrick-St. Vincent High is also at home for the first time this year and will look to pick up its first win of the season against Terra Linda. The Bruins lost last week to San Rafael and their defense needs to improve after giving up 42 points a game the first two weeks.\nAmerican Canyon lost to St. Vincent de Paul last Saturday in a matchup of two strong teams from a year ago. The loss for the Wolves was their first in six games going back to last year when they won a state title. Meanwhile, Benicia will look to pick up its first win of the year after falling to Las Lomas a week ago. The Panthers’ defense played well, but the offense needs to improve. That game at Wolf Den Stadium is scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m.\nIt’s also rivalry week in girls tennis with Vallejo taking on Bethel on Thursday at 3:30 p.m. at Vallejo High. Bethel also plays St. Patrick-St. Vincent on Tuesday at home. St. Pat’s is also at home on Thursday against St. Mary’s. American Canyon girls tennis plays Casa Grande at home the same day.\nIn girls volleyball, the American Canyon girls kept rolling over the weekend, finishing third in the NorCal Tournament with a 3-1 record. The Wolves are on the road this Tuesday and Thursday with matches at Justin-Siena and Petaluma.\nBenicia’s volleyball team has also played well and are at home for two matches this week — a Tuesday contest against Campolindo and a Thursday match against Miramonte. Both are slated to begin at 6:30 p.m..\nJesse Bethel has forfeited a few recent games due to players with COVID, but are scheduled to be back in action at home this week, starting Monday night with a matchup against Mt. Diablo, before facing De Anza and Fairfield on Wednesday and Friday. Vallejo High was scheduled to play at John Swett on Monday night and Tamalpais on Wednesday night.\nIn water polo, the American Canyon programs are slated to take on St. Patrick-St. Vincent on Tuesday. The girls start at 4 while the boys play at 5 p.m. that day.\nIn college sports, Solano women’s volleyball hosts a few tournaments this week. On Wednesday the Falcons play DeAnza and Shasta College at 4 and 6 p.m. respectively. On Friday Solano takes on Santa Rosa and Sac City at 3 and 5 p.m. respectively. Admission is free, although a $2 parking pass will be required.\nIn girls soccer, Solano plays Evergreen at home on Tuesday at 4 p.m.\nCollege football\nThere are plenty of big college football games this week, starting on Friday night with the battle of the Hoosier state as Indiana State plays at Indiana.\nOn Saturday you can line up your day by watching Wisconsin at Alabama and Oregon at Northwestern at 9 a.m., then watch Georgia at Tennessee at 12:30 p.m., while Purdue at USC at the same time could be a good matchup. South Florida takes on Miami at 1:30 p.m., while top-seeded Ohio State will likely destroy Ohio University around the same time.\nThe best games of the day come around 4 p.m. with Arkansas visiting Ole Miss, Florida visiting LSU, while 4:30 p.m. brings Texas A&M at Notre Dame.\nCal and Stanford both play at home this week in night games. Cal takes on Minnesota, while Boston College visits Stanford.\nNFL\nThe San Francisco 49ers are coming off a big win at Seattle, and will play one more road game before coming home. This week’s matchup is at New Orleans at 10 a.m. on Sunday. So the 49ers have a decent chance at starting out 2-0, with the Saints losing at home last weekend to Arizona.\nOther interesting 10 a.m. games on Sunday include the New York Giants at the Dallas Cowboys, where both teams look for their first win. The Chicago Bears at the Detroit Lions is a good NFC North matchup, while the Seattle Seahawks at Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cleveland Browns visiting the old Cleveland Browns in the Baltimore Ravens are other good morning games.\nAt 1 p.m. is the biggest game of the week — a Super Bowl rematch with the Philadelphia Eagles visiting Arrowhead Stadium and the Kansas City Chiefs. The Sunday night game is the Atlanta Falcons at the Minnesota Vikings, while there are two Monday night football games — the Las Vegas Raiders (that is still so weird saying) at home against the Los Angeles Chargers (that is also still so weird saying), and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers visiting the Houston Texans. The Thursday night game this week is a good one with the Washington Commanders visiting the Green Bay Packers. One of those teams will go 2-0 barring a tie.\nMajor League Baseball\nSomehow, someway, the San Francisco Giants have taken advantage of the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres playing terrible lately, and are still in the pennant race, only seven games out of the lead and four games out of the last wild card spot. If they want to have a chance, they have to do damage this week with home games against the Arizona Diamondbacks and Dodgers over the weekend.\nThe A’s are also at home this week, with games against the Boston Red Sox early this week before a weekend slate against the Cincinnati Reds during the weekend. The A’s are out of playoff contention, but both the Red Sox and Reds are fighting for playoff spots so it could be some good action in Sacramento.\nOther big games early in the week include the Mets and Phillies starting Monday night, while the Kansas City Royals at Cleveland Guardians, Milwaukee Brewers at Texas Rangers and Reds at San Diego Padres and a Sept. 11 game at Yankee Stadium as the Detroit Tigers come to town.\nWeekend matchups to watch include the New York Yankees at Fenway Park. That series includes the Sunday night ESPN game, which returns after a week off. ESPN will not carry baseball next year, so enjoy these games while you can. Also, watch if Cal Raleigh can beat Mickey Mantle for the most homers by a switch-hitter. The Mariners take on the Los Angeles Angels starting Thursday. The Royals and Phillies face off in a 1980 World Series rematch, while Tampa Bay visits Wrigley Field and the Chicago Cubs and the St. Louis Cardinals take on the Brewers in a 1982 World Series rematch.\nWNBA\nThe Golden State Valkyries have clinched a playoff spot, but end the regular season with two road games this week. They play at Minnesota and Seattle.\nTo read\n“The Game” by Ken Dryden (the goalie for Montreal recently died).\n“My Wild Ride in Baseball” by Davey Johnson (Johnson, a stellar player and manager, also died over the weekend).\nWatch\n“Nine Innings from Ground Zero: The 2001 World Series” (to watch on 9/11).",
