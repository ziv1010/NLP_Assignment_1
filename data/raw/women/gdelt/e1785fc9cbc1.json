Korea releases photos of Kim Jong-il\nPosted on : 2008-10-13 12:30 KST Modified on : 2019-10-19 20:29 KST\nExperts question the validity of the photos, citing the difference in the season depicted\nthe first photos of Kim released in 56 days amid rumors about the state of his health. Questions remain about the authenticity of the photos because none of them were dated\nA North Korean news outlet released photographs of North Korea’s National Defense Commission Chairman Kim Jong-il inspecting a military unit on October 11. Video footage of Kim was not, however, released. It was first time in 56 days that the North’s state-run Korean Central News Agency carried a photo of Kim; the last time was on August 16, following a report on the North Korean leader’s inspection of a military unit on August 14.\nOn the morning of October 11, the North’s Korean Central Television Station released 10 photographs of Kim, who was shown inspecting a women’s artillery company of military unit 821. In the photos, Kim is wearing his usual khaki jumpsuit and sunglasses and is exchanging dialogue with soldiers, clapping his hands and watching a training session. The photos, which show images of Kim from both the front and side, do not provide any indication that he has had brain surgery such as the traces of a haircut, which would typically be part of the procedure.\nThe release of the photos was seen as North Korea’s intention to prove that Kim’s leadership is intact amid intense speculation that he may be ill. Since August 16, there have been no reports from North Korean media outlets about Kim’s public activities such as on-site military inspections or meetings with foreign diplomats. On October 4, the North’s state-sponsored media reported that Kim had attended a football match. On October 10, the North Korean media ran a report on a speech given by Kim, and on October 11, the photos were released. This could mean that North Korean media outlets have gradually stepped up the extent of their coverage about Kim.\nThe photos were released immediately before the U.S. government announced that it had removed North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism on October 11 (EDT). Ko Yoo-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University, said, “I believe the release was made to emphasize that all diplomatic achievements, including the removal (of North Korea from the U.S. list) of terrorism sponsors, were those of Chairman Kim.” Ko said that North Korea may have wanted to show that Kim’s “disappearance” was deliberate, rather than a consequence of his health, as a way to resolve the nuclear standoff between North Korea and the United States.\nHowever, many analysts say these latest photographs are not enough to quell the speculation that Kim is ill. Although the release could mean that Kim’s grip on the North’s power structure is still strong, it is difficult to say definitively the North Korean leader does not have health problems.\nIn particular, some experts have raised questions about the validity of the photographs themselves. Yang Moo-jin, a professor of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said, “The dark green color of the trees in the photographs does not match North Korea’s current season of autumn. If the photographs were taken in the past few days, there is no explanation for why North Korea didn’t release photos of Kim watching the football match on October 4, which was just seven days ago.”\nCiting the dark green color of the trees in the photographs, some analysts say the images were taken in July or August. Kim was reported to have visited the women’s artillery company of military unit 821 in July 2004, August and October 2003 and September 2001. In a report published July 29, 2004, the North’s KCNA said the women’s artillery company was stationed near the Demilitarized Zone.\nAnalysts say that speculation about Kim’s illness would subside only if North Korea were to release video footage of Kim or images of Kim attending a public event or meeting with foreign diplomats.\nPlease direct questions or comments to [englishhani@hani.co.kr]\n광고\n- [Column] Moment of truth: What the Epstein files really show us\n- [Editorial] Coupang’s lobbying in US won’t win back Korean customer base\n- [Column] Today’s diverging paths of human virtue, hegemony and tyranny\n- [Column] As South Korea profits from arms, North Korea pays in lives\n- [Column] Trump loses steam, Takaichi gains momentum — where does that leave Korea?\n- [Column] Back to the bad old pre‑WWII days\n- [Guest essay] Will humans be crushed by the AI tide, or carried by it?\n- [Guest essay] UNC is not the boss here — Korea needs to say so\n- [Column] Bond warfare threatens mutually assured destruction\n- [Column] How North Korea’s upcoming party congress could change history\n- 1In Korea, Filipino home helpers are expected to do double duty for half the pay\n- 2[Column] Today’s diverging paths of human virtue, hegemony and tyranny\n- 3Ex-interior minister knowingly advanced unconstitutional martial law plot, court rules\n- 4Coupang asks for US attorneys to ‘sit in on’ Korean government probe over Zoom\n- 5South Korea reviewing charter of Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ as it weighs membership\n- 6US acknowledges Korea’s investment process differs from Japan’s, says Foreign Ministry\n- 7Snowboarder Choi Ga-on pulls off stellar comeback to win Korea’s first Olympic gold in snow event\n- 8Former bodyguard’s dark tale of marriage to Samsung royalty\n- 9[Column] Trump loses steam, Takaichi gains momentum — where does that leave Korea?\n- 10US spearheads critical minerals trade bloc to check China’s dominance",
