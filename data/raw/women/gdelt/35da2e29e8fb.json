  "body_text": "Five massive events happening in Greater Manchester this weekend you won't want to miss\nPunk, art, football, dancing and good vibes are all on the agenda\nIn case you haven’t yet realised, Manchester is well underway with a year full of exciting events and shows.\nIn the last few months alone, the city-borough has hosted big names including Bruce Springsteen, Kylie Minogue and Robbie Williams and, well, it’s perhaps safe to say we are only really just getting started.\nOf course, Oasis will be bringing their huge reunion shows to Heaton Park for five dates next month, whilst we also have events like Manchester International Festival and Manchester Pride coming up this summer.\nBut if you’re ready and raring to go with the good vibes and good times, there’s plenty going on this weekend. Saturday and Sunday alone will play host to a range of gigs, festivals and matches all alongside Father’s Day celebrations.\nWe’ve already rounded up some of the best offers and freebies available this Father’s Day here - with a chance to bag free pints, free tickets and even a free haircut by heading out to certain places.\nBut when it comes to what’s on this weekend, we’ve got you covered below. Naturally, we’re talking Parklife and Soccer Aid - but there’s a couple more exciting things going on in the next two days that you might not have been aware of.\nParklife 2025\nHeaton Park will be hosting up to 160,000 people this weekend - with some big names in the world of music taking to the stage during Parklife 2025.\nThe two-day event, which is ticketed, will be headlined by huge performers 50 Cent and Charli XCX. There will also be performances across the weekend from the likes of Jorja Smith, Rudimental, Confidence Man, Armand Van Helden and Bicep.\nThere are a limited number of tickets remaining if you’ve not yet committed to going to Parklife this year. They are available via Ticketmaster here, with prices starting from £95.20 for a day ticket. Weekend and VIP tickets also available.\nSoccer Aid\nPerhaps on the other side of the spectrum and certainly on the other side of Greater Manchester is Soccer Aid - taking place at Old Trafford on Sunday (June 15).\nThe charity football match, which will be airing on ITV, will feature appearances from a host of celebrities as well as big sports stars. Amongst the roster this year will be One Direction star Louis Tomlinson, TV presenter Bear Grylls, Olympian Dame Denise Lewis, and Strictly Come Dancing star Gorka Marquez.\nThere will also be the likes of Robbie Keane, Jill Scott, Steph Houghton, Wayne Rooney and Gary Neville taking part in the match too.\nThe game is set to begin at 7.30pm. Tickets for the event have now sold out, so your best bet is to watch the action live on ITV.\nChris Brown at Co-op Live\nChris Brown will be performing the first of four huge shows at Co-op Live on Sunday (June 15). He’ll return again on Monday (June 16), on June 24 and on July 3.\nPart of his Breezy Bowl XX tour, he will be joined by Bryson Tiller. Sunday’s show will mark the first time Chris has appeared in Manchester since he was arrested in the city last month.\nWhilst tickets for the shows have sold out, there are a limited number of resale tickets available - with verified resale tickets on Ticketmaster beginning from £75.42 at the time of writing.\nResale tickets are also available from Viagogo, as well as on StubHub and Vivid Seats.\nIt is always advised to be cautious about where you buy tickets from - and only use trusted platforms.\nHorizons Festival\nRunning until Sunday with a host of events, including film screenings and panel discussions, will be the Horizon Festival.\nCelebrating creativity, community, and connection, this year’s festival takes on the theme of More in Common - reflecting a desire to 'build understanding and prevent divisions in society caused by fear and misinformation, championing the power of art to unite people across cultures'.\nThere will be the chance to preview new art work at HOME from Pinar Yildiz, as well as free drop-in family workshops to make paper mosaics. There will also be the launch of the More in Common exhibition from WAST (Women Asylum Seekers Together), as well as workshops teaching the likes of Palestinian dance, printmaking, and drumming.\nAll events will either be free or cost no more than £4.70 - all taking place at HOME. More information here.\nOutbreak Fest\nIf the music of Parklife is not up to your standards, then how does a weekend of punk and hardcore sound?\nOutbreak Fest, taking place at Bowlers Exhibition Centre on Saturday and Sunday, will be headlined by Knocked Loose, Alex G, and Slowdive, with the likes of Glassjaw, Sunny Day Real Estate, Denzel Curry and Danny Brown also taking to the stage across the weekend\nIt follows exactly day after the Friday show at London's Victoria Park with a slightly varied line-up. Tickets for Manchester's Outbreak Fest can be bought here with day tickets costing £106.40, including fees.",
