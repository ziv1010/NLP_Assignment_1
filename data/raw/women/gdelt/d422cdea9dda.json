It is now the Credit Union.\nAcross the street is the old Downshire Hotel which once was a Royal Bank. Before that it was used as a residence by the Downshires. Price Albert the husband of Queen Victoria stayed there around 1858. The hotel hosted the wedding of gay Byrne and Kathleen Watkins. Across the road from the hotel is the four stone tree.\nFinally beside the Garda barracks was the Coffee Palace which was open on Fair days to keep the farmers sober.
