  "body_text": "The opening match of the 2023 Women’s World Cup featured a milestone moment as the referee explained a decision to supporters in the stadium.\nReferee Yoshimi Yamashita (pictured) awarded a penalty to co-hosts New Zealand in the 88th minute after a VAR review, communicating the process via the Tannoy system at Eden Park in Auckland.\nAdvertisement\nRia Percival’s spot kick struck the crossbar after the late drama, but Hannah Wilkinson’s earlier second-half goal secured a 1-0 win over Norway — and earned New Zealand their first win at a World Cup finals — women’s or men’s — in front of 42,137.\nReferee Emikar Caldera Barrera was also in the spotlight in Brisbane during England’s game against Haiti, announcing two VAR decisions including a re-taken penalty.\nHere, we explain what you need to know about VAR at the tournament in Australia and New Zealand, what happened at Eden Park, and whether the development might pave the way for further transparency in other competitions…\nFollow the Women’s World Cup on The Athletic…\n- Women’s World Cup 2023: Group guides\n- Women’s World Cup fixtures, results, tables\n- Women’s World Cup news — live updates\nHow is VAR working at the Women’s World Cup?\nVAR is being used at the Women’s World Cup for the second successive tournament after its introduction in 2019.\nGoals scored, mistaken identity, potential red cards and potential fouls in the penalty area will all be checked.\nBut FIFA announced at the start of July that referees would announce decisions over the loud speaker at games this summer.\nThis process happened previously at the men’s FIFA Club World Cup in Morocco and the Under-20 World Cup in Argentina, but this is the first time live, in-play decisions have been heard at a senior World Cup tournament for men or women.\nIt was in January that football’s lawmakers, IFAB, agreed to trial broadcasting explanations of VAR decisions to the crowd and television audience at FIFA tournaments over the next 12 months.\nThe announcement, given in English after the decision has been made, can include all or some of the following elements: the final decision itself, the reason it has been given, which player committed the offence and, occasionally, some extra detail about the offence.\nKari Seitz, FIFA’s head of refereeing in women’s football, said before the tournament: “The most important thing for us is the decision on the field. If we can get all of that inside the announcement, great. But our priority is to make the correct decision. If we can explain these four things, that’s the extra content.\nAdvertisement\n“I’m confident we can get 80-90 per cent of this. Our goal is to make sure the spectators in the stands have a better understanding of what’s happening on the field.”\nFIFA’s refereeing chief, Pierluigi Collina, said the development was about giving “more transparency, more understanding of the decision made by the referee,” but admitted mistakes were possible given officials were still learning.\nCollina said there were no plans to expand the information or decision-making process given live beyond the broadcast of the decision itself, adding that he did not want to put “pressure” on referees speaking in a second language and further noting, when asked about other sports, that NFL officials had been “doing this for quite a long time”.\nWhat happened in the tournament opener?\nNew Zealand, co-hosting the tournament with Australia, were leading 1-0 in the closing stages of the game when a late flashpoint ensued.\nJitka Klimkova’s team were attacking down the right flank when a Malia Steinmetz cross appeared to hit Tuva Hansen’s hand with two minutes of normal time remaining.\nOn the advice of the VAR, Tatiana Guzman from Nicaragua, the referee headed to the pitchside monitor, with viewers and spectators able to see footage of the incident from several angles.\nSatisfied that Hansen’s outstretched arm had made her body illegally bigger, referee Yamashita pointed towards the spot and, for the first time in World Cup history, said: “The decision is… penalty”.\nPercival, New Zealand’s most-capped player, failed to convert from the spot after her effort hit the crossbar, but the co-hosts hung on for a priceless victory.\nNew to the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup:\nAfter a VAR review, the referee makes an announcement to the fans inside the stadium that a penalty has been awarded as a result of the check 🎥⚽️ pic.twitter.com/WrYyg1gH69\n— FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) July 20, 2023\nHistory at the Women's World Cup! 🤯\n📢 The first time in football that the referee has announced their VAR decision live to the stadium.\nNew Zealand awarded a penalty…#BBCWorldCup #FIFAWWC #NZLNOR pic.twitter.com/EzAb1bfjEM\n— BBC Sport (@BBCSport) July 20, 2023\nWhat was it like inside the stadium?\nThe Athletic‘s Meg Linehan:\n“From within the stadium, it was a fairly clear and quick process.\n“We saw the sign go up, saying it was a possible penalty review, followed by the ref motioning for a video review, then watching the video review and making the announcement.\nAdvertisement\n“It was a little hard to hear that, simply because it was so loud in the stadium, but very clear that a penalty had been awarded.\n“Because it was the opening match, because New Zealand had the lead, their first World Cup win on the line, the reaction to the announcement was even more dramatic; one of the loudest moments of the game.”\nFormer Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright, watching from inside the stadium, was certainly satisfied with the experience, too.\nThat new VAR business was good 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 pic.twitter.com/0QbvJdgBpi\n— Ian Wright (@IanWright0) July 20, 2023\nAny chance this might happen in the Premier League?\nWe’ll have to wait and see.\nAsked what the future might hold for VAR audio, Collina said: “After, we will discuss and consider what is best for the future.”\nThe chief executive of the Football Association, who chaired the IFAB meeting in January, admitted he felt crowds did not currently receive enough information about what was happening on the field during VAR reviews.\nHe said: “We think it’s important in terms of transparency, predominantly to the crowd who at the moment, we don’t think receive enough information.”\nThe Premier League’s referees’ chief, Howard Webb, indicated in May that audio recordings of VAR deliberations could be released next season to help explain contentious decisions.\nDuring a segment on Sky Sports, Webb showed video and audio recordings of interactions between on-field referees and VAR officials discussing in-game situations and decisions.\nIt was the first time such footage had been shown to Premier League viewers in the UK and, asked by pundit Gary Neville whether more might be released on the day of a game from next season, Webb said increased access was under consideration.\n“We are looking to do this as much as we possibly can,” he said. “We have made small steps forward. Going forward into next season, we will be looking to do more. FIFA does not allow us to play this out during the game. Who knows where that might go in the future?”\nAdvertisement\nAnything else to watch out for at the Women’s World Cup?\nLike at the 2022 men’s World Cup in Qatar, semi-automated offsides will be used to help assistant referees that have missed real-time offsides.\nThe limb-tracking technology, which FIFA says collects 29 data points per player 50 times every second, is intended to make offside decisions more efficient, avoiding frustrating delays for supporters.\nGoal-line technology, implemented a decade ago to far more positive reaction than VAR, will also be in use during the Women’s World Cup.\nCollina said that match officials in Australia and New Zealand would be encouraged to be strict in adding additional minutes for stoppages, in a bid to deter time-wasting.\nEleven additional minutes were played at Eden Park on Thursday.\n(Photo: Getty Images)",
