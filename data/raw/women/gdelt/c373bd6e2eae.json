  "body_text": "For UH athletics, the transfer portal door swings both ways\nAs the regular season ends, the NCAA transfer portal has taken center stage in college football and women’s volleyball, marking the start of a chaotic offseason in collegiate sports.\nSince the portal opened earlier this month, more than a thousand players between the sports have entered, including several from the University of Hawaii. Among the notable departures are football players Ezra Evaimalo and Kaena DeCambra, along with reigning Big West Player of the Year in women’s volleyball, Caylen Alexander.\nAccording to Kanoa Leahey of Spectrum Sports and ESPN Honolulu, the transfer portal’s rise—fueled by the potential for athletes to secure lucrative NIL deals—has reshaped the expectations of fans and programs alike.\n“I think we have to no longer think about college sports in the way that we did previously,” Leahey said. “It’s not always about the name on the front of the jersey anymore. Loyalty isn’t the top priority. There are going to be many reasons why student-athletes transfer, and you have to respect that and anticipate it.”\nLeahey pointed out that while most current headlines focus on players leaving programs, the transfer portal also presents opportunities for schools to attract talent. For example, Hawaii’s 2024 football team MVP Cam Stone, defensive MVP Elijah Robinson, and special teams MVP Lucas Borrow were all transfers who came to the program through the portal.\nSpoke with Kanoa Leahey of Spectrum Sports & ESPN Honolulu amid the transfer portal frenzy in college football & women's volleyball ▪️ Part of the conversation is the reality that for the University of Hawaii, the portal door swings both ways https://t.co/LOSlCYZmUP #HawaiiFB… pic.twitter.com/KY9Hs3KGzM\n— Rob DeMello (@RobDeMelloKHON) December 13, 2024\n“The portal door swings both ways,” Leahey said. “It taketh away, and it giveth. You’re going to suffer some losses, but you’re also going to be granted opportunities to add to your program. It doesn’t have to be seen as a terrifying aspect of college sports. The challenge is putting the right network of individuals and support staff in place to make it work for your program.”\nThe NCAA transfer portal will remain open until Dec. 28 for football and Jan. 6 for women’s volleyball, leaving coaches and fans anxiously awaiting both departures and arrivals in the weeks to come.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
