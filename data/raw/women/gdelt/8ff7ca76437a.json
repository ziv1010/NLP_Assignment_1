  "body_text": "Lindsey Vonn was airlifted off the mountain after crashing early in her run in the Olympic women’s downhill in Cortina.\nThe American superstar clipped a gate and somersaulted off the course, leading to an extended delay as she was tended by a team of medics.\nThe 41-year-old, who won downhill gold in Vancouver in 2010, had been intent on competing despite tearing her ACL in a warm-up race in Crans-Montana just over a week ago.\nThe huge crowd at the Tofane Alpine Centre fell almost silent as Vonn received extended treatment, then broke into cheers as the medical helicopter arrived to whisk her to hospital.\nFormer British Olympian Chemmy Alcott, co-commetating from the BBC, was clearly distressed watching the scenes and said: ‘Breezy Johnson will not be enjoying sitting in that [gold medal] chair, we all know what Lindsey has done to our sport.\n‘Lindsey was an early bib number and the temperature is increasing so the later athletes will be taking a big risk.\n‘It means the surface wont be as constant and the trust in the ski won’t be as good.\n‘This sport is tough and you are pushing yourself to your limit at speed. We have a standing ovation now as the helicopter goes.’\nVonn initially retired from the sport in 2019 following a slew of injuries but, after undergoing a partial knee replacement in April 2024, she returned to competition in December of that year.\nShe had won two World Cup events this season and been among the favourites for the downhill before her fall in Switzerland.\nVonn had successfully completed two practice runs on the Cortina course on Friday and Saturday, wearing a brace on her injured knee, and her coach Aksel Lund Svindal felt she was in ‘good enough’ condition to challenge for a medal.\nIn an emotional Instagram post, published on Saturday, Vonn had made of point of underlining her determination to prove her critics wrong.\nShe wrote: ‘I will stand in the starting gate tomorrow and know I am strong. Know that I believe in myself. Know that the odds are stacked against me with my age, no ACL, and a titanium knee- but know that I still believe.\n‘And usually, when the odds are stacked against me the most, I pull the best of what’s inside me out.\n‘I will race tomorrow in my final Olympic Downhill and while I can’t guarantee a good result, I can guarantee I will give it everything I have. But no matter what happens, I have already won.’\nDouble Olympic champion Tina Maze, speaking on Eurosport and TNT Sports coverage, however, felt the potential ramifications were always likely to outweigh the reward for competing.\nMore Trending\nShe said: ‘We all know the difficulties Lindsey was going through in the last days, and I think in the end she risked too much.\n‘This kind of crash can happen of course, if you are not healthy the consequences are even worse, but Lindsey wanted to do this no matter what.\n‘It’s really tough for everyone here to see this especially for her family and teammates and everyone working with her. It’s just terrible. A tough day.’\nMORE: Israeli athletes robbed and passports stolen at Winter Olympics\nMORE: Arsonists ‘sabotage’ rail cables in Italy on first day of Winter Olympics\nMORE: Boos drown out Winter Olympics for ‘first time in 22 years’ as JD Vance appears on screen",
