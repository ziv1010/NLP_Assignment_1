  "body_text": "Arsenal suffers shock loss to Tottenham in WSL as Caitlin Foord bemoans missed opportunities\nPerhaps the presence of Ange Postecoglou in the stands was a lucky charm, but Tottenham's women's team has left home fans stunned by earning its first Women's Super League triumph over London rival Arsenal.\nKey points:\n- Arsenal had been looking to claim the top of the WSL table outright with victory over Tottenham\n- The loss leaves them equal on points with Sam Kerr's Chelsea, who play Bristol City on Monday morning\n- The victory pushed Tottenham up to sixth on the table, equal on points with Liverpool\nThe men's team boss Postecoglou, watching on a day after being floated as the next Manchester City manager, must have feared the worst as he watched his fellow Australian Caitlin Foord hit the post with a fine run and shot in the 17th minute as Arsenal looked rampant.\nBut ultimately, after having 31 attempts on goal to the home side's eight, unfancied Spurs battled hard to eke out a 1-0 win on Sunday morning (AEDT) thanks to a fine team move finished by Martha Thomas just before the hour mark.\nIt meant deep frustration for Arsenal, with their three Matildas — Foord, Steph Catley and Kyra Cooney-Cross — all having hoped they might celebrate going into Christmas with their side on top of the WSL.\nInstead, after their brilliant 4-1 win over Chelsea the previous week, Arsenal, which remains on 22 points after 10 games, blew it to offer Sam Kerr's champions, also on 22 after nine matches, the chance to take control again when they visit Bristol City on Monday morning.\nIt left Catley hugely disappointed.\n\"It's extremely frustrating, it's a tough league and you can't afford to drop too many points,\" she said.\n\"We created big, big chances — and a lot of them too — and on another day, a lot of them, or just one, might have gone in.\n\"They had one chance and it went in. Football can be cruel sometimes.\n\"Today just wasn't our day, we'll have to regroup and come back stronger. It's a long season and we'll keep on fighting.\n\"We have to keep focusing on the next results and make sure we get points in every single game from here on.\"\nIt was an extraordinary result, considering how Arsenal had approached the game off the back of seven straight league wins and mid-table Spurs, who had shipped 11 goals in their last two league games, had never beaten their north London foes in seven previous WSL meetings.\nFoord was at the heart of Arsenal's first-half domination but, despite her one brilliant moment when her cut-in and driving shot rattled the woodwork, she was guilty of some wasteful moments as she foraged down the left flank.\nAfter Thomas had got on the end of a well-worked move that began deep in Spurs' own half in the 58th minute, Arsenal couldn't break down the home side, marshalled well by league debutant keeper Barbora Votikova.\nCooney-Cross had a late, goal-bound volley headed away close to her own line by Angharad James and moments later, Catley claimed to have been brought down by the same defender in the box, prompting boos from the Spurs faithful.\nThe game was paused late for a medical emergency in the crowd but when supersub Vivianne Miedema hooked over in the first minute of 11 added on, all was lost for Arsenal.\nAAP",
