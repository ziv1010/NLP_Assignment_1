Meet Skyler Mott.\nScholar, Athlete, Entrepreneur.\nA senior business major majoring in business management and cognitive science at Lehigh University, Mott describes himself as a “prolific ideator.” However, he is equally a roll-up-your-sleeves doer. Among his latest ventures, you’ll find Markit-Athletics, patented pins to replace tape in track and field competitions, and Mountain Movers Storage, which has helped over 200 students re-locate their belongings. the business major also founded Broadway Realty, which offers over a dozen affordable student housing options that carry a combined $5 million dollar valuation.\nA ten-time winner of Lehigh’s Eureka Pitch Night – not to mention the Grand Prize recipient for both the Holy Cross Cross-tank and Worcester Woo-tank competitions – Mott became a founder in earnest when he purchased his first house.\nWHAT MAKES A BEST & BRIGHTEST?\nMott is one member of the 2025 Best & Brightest Business Majors from Poets&Quants. Now in its 10th year, the Best & Brightest honors 100 senior business majors who made the biggest impact on their programs and personified the best of their cohorts. To compile the list, P&Q invited schools from its Top 50 undergraduate ranking to participate, from the Wharton School to Indiana University’s Kelley School to U.C. Berkeley’s Haas School. In addition, P&Q added seniors from such top international programs as Alliance Manchester in the United Kingdom and IE Business School in Spain.\nLike past years, business schools selected nominees using their own criteria (though P&Q encouraged them to factor in such qualities as academic excellence and extracurricular leadership).\nAs a whole, these exemplary business majors were nearly split equally between men and women (51-to-49, respectively), with 13 representatives hailing from outside the United States. Come graduation, seven members will be starting at McKinsey & Company, while another 6 will join Deloitte.\nWhat do the 2025 Best & Brightest Business Majors have in common? Think passion and purpose – a commitment to a particular industry or outcome – that pushes to always be questioning listening, learning, and growing. Go-getters all, they possess an infectious, can-do drive that leaves little room for half measures. Some command the whole room and others quietly hold teams together. Either way, they bring a calmness and confidence amid the setbacks. You don’t just count the Best & Brightest to show up – you can expect them to deliver.\nThe Best & Brightest may have interned at Bain and Morgan Stanley, but they learned business fundamentals scooping ice cream at Stone Cold Creamery or delivering meals through DoorDash. Outside business school, these rising stars competed in football, cross country, wrestling, and rugby – along with case and big idea competitions. They worked as teaching assistants, residence advisors, research assistants, and ambassadors – when they weren’t busy running clubs, organizing fund-raisers, or mentoring underclassmen. In the end, the Best & Brightest were the catalysts who made things happen. Filled with faith and optimism, these business majors elevated their classmates to be their best selves. In the process, they became as urgent as they were unforgettable. Over time, that spirit will enable each of them to do something special, in one form or another.\nSkyler Mott, Lehigh University\nCAPITALIZING ON EVERY OPPORTUNITY\nMott is just one of many on this year’s list. “[I] realized that all juniors and seniors live off campus during their upperclassmen years,” he tells P&Q. “When looking into rent, I realized that the mortgage cost was the same as the monthly rent. From that moment, I was determined to buy my first home. Through various strategies and creative financing, I accomplished that goal. I spent the entire summer replacing the floors, painting the walls, putting in blinds, an outdoor fence, a new refrigerator, and a washer and dryer. I managed to finish all the renovations by the start of school and had five students living there in my junior year.”\nOnce listed among the best ten-year-olds in chess, Mott started chess programs at two elementary schools to provide meals and teach problem-solving skills. He also ranks among the nation’s top 50 high jumpers, while serving as captain of Lehigh’s 130-member track and field team. A four-time member of the Dean’s List, Mott even led the marketing efforts for a Barcelona startup – along with completing treks to Silicon Valley and Vietnam. With graduation looming, Mott is now weighing whether to scale his ventures or start graduate school. Either way, he made the most of every minute and opportunity at Lehigh – and left his classmates and community better for it.\n“Skyler Mott is one of the hardest-working, creative, and execution-focused students I’ve worked with,” shares Chris Kauzmann, Innovator-In-Residence at Lehigh University. “Not only does he possess the ability to identify market opportunities, generate creative ideas, and execute on those ideas, he does so with a kindness, charm, and support of others that is truly exceptional. Skyler has not only been an exceptional student, but a role model to other students.”\nIsabella Suffredini, Cornell University\nSETTING THE BAR ON AND OFF THE COURT\nSome Best & Brightest students are already leaving big shoes to fill. Case in point: Stephen Mitchell, an example of a true servant leader. A starting guard on Marquette University’s basketball team, Mitchell doesn’t need to score points to make an impact. Known for energy and leadership, Mitchell is a finalist for the Naismith National Defensive Player of the Year. This year, he also chipped in 10 points, 4 rebounds and 2 steals per game. In the process, he helped Marquette reach the NCAA tournament during all four years on the team. However, Mitchell equally shines away from the hardwood. He was named the Men’s Basketball Scholar-Athlete of the Year by the Big East Conference and Marquette’s Most Outstanding Senior in both Finance and Information Systems. And those accolades don’t include achieving a perfect 4.0 GPA in the fall of 2024.\nThere really isn’t any secret behind Mitchell’s success, says Dr. Terence Thong-Hwee Ow, a Professor of Information Systems, Analytics and Supply Chain Management at Marquette University’s College of Business. He just puts in the work on and off the court. “He pays rigorous attention to details to solve problems in programming; as an example, he put in copious amounts of work analyzing his opponents’ tendencies, which allowed him to create turnovers for his team. His classmates at Marquette marvel at his commitment and excellence in coursework.”\nMore in U.S.\nOthers marvel at just how the Best & Brightest can juggle everything in their lives. At Cornell University’s Nolan School of Hotel Administration, Isabella Suffredini has been selected to TA for nine courses. That doesn’t count running the sales operation for the Hotel Ezra Cornell annual conference – or teaching her classmates how to play cards in the Cornell Women’s Poker Club. Saanvi Sood, a senior at Emory University’s Goizueta School, is a TA for three clubs: the Marketing Consulting Practicum, Corporate Political Strategy and Business Communications. Ticketed to join the Boston Consulting Group, Sood also served as the President of the Emory Data Science Club and CEO for the Emory Impact Investment Group.\n“[The latter is] microfinancing organization supporting small businesses in historically underserved Atlanta communities,” Sood tells P&Q. “During my tenure, I led a fundraising campaign to expand our fund and amplify our impact. Through outreach to over 500 contacts and the support of the Goizueta community, we grew our fund from $200K to $360K—ensuring the club’s ability to provide low-interest loans in perpetuity.”\nMAKING AN IMPACT, EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY\nLevi Montoya, University of California-Berkeley\nSome Best & Brightest members invested heavy time in particular areas. Levi Montoya became a first-generation college student after growing up in a single parent home. After transferring from community college to the University of California-Berkeley’s Haas School, he got involved in nearly everything, from being elected president of the Consulting Club to being tapped to conduct public policy research. However, Montoya found his real footing in case competitions. Here, his team ranked among the top performers in several events – even claiming Best Presentation at the MasterCard Advisors Case Competition. Compare that to Chad Burks. Over his four years at Binghamton University, Burks’ case teams collected five first-place finishes. Along the way, he was named the school’s Transformational Leader of the Year in 2022-2023. Such achievements would’ve come as a surprise to Burks when he was a freshman. Back then, he was hesitant to get involved, worried he wouldn’t fit in.\n“The truth is that growth and being comfortable often cannot coexist,” he tells P&Q. “I realized that the only fear I had was not putting myself in a position to do the things I needed to in order to reach what I imagined to be my full potential. From there, I finally started challenging myself to get extremely involved and meet others on campus. Doing this has paid tremendous dividends in helping me achieve things that I previously couldn’t have imagined to be possible.\nAt USC’s Marshall School, Santiago Briones Lopez could also be found nearly everywhere. He worked as a consulting career advisor, performing over 100 one-on-one coaching sessions. He led the 250-member Latino Student Business Association, growing membership by 60%. He also gave campus tours as a student ambassador and completed internships at KPMG, Bain, and FTI Consulting. You could say Lopez equals leadership – a quality he attributes to his father and mother, whose combined backgrounds include management, marketing, consulting, teaching, and hospitality. From them, he says, he learned that success is measured more in making a difference than in titles and accolades.\n“That’s why my proudest achievement isn’t a title or an internship—it’s my impact. As a student ambassador, I’ve helped students find their place at USC. As a mentor, I’ve guided peers into their dream careers. And as a leader, I’ve helped build communities that will outlast my time in them. If I’ve made someone’s journey a little easier, a little clearer, or a little more possible—then I’ve done something worth being proud of.”\nGIVING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY\nHali Jama, University of Wisconsin\nImpact has also been the mission for the University of Wisconsin’s Hali Jama, who co-founded the school’s Somali Student Association and Business Behind Fashion Club. After creating a career advice video that generated over a million views on social media, she launched Success Sessions, a coaching venture that was booked up four months in advance. At Binghamton University, Adam Bandler played a number of leadership roles in the Harper’s Ferry Student Volunteer Ambulance Service, a volunteer, 24×7 EMS service that provides basic and advanced life services to students and the local community alike. At the University of Pittsburgh, Isabelle Layding proved she could perform at the highest levels during her Consulting Field Projects.\n“I’ve been an Engagement Manager for two projects with billion-dollar companies, which has been an incredible learning experience. Through my work with FedEx Ground, I was able to work with a group of MS students to find $4 million [dollars] of value for our clients, which was a pretty cool feeling as an undergraduate Junior. I’m currently working with the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, and I am very excited for the potential impact that this engagement will have on the future of nuclear energy internationally. These projects encouraged me to pursue a career in consulting after graduation, and I learned a great deal about managing teams, building client relationships, and delivering significant results in a short period of time.”\nLayding wasn’t alone in delivering impact outside the business school walls. At the Wharton School, Daniel Babalola helped to launch VITA@Penn, a student organization that partners with the IRS to provide tax assistance to working families. His classmate, Shivani Desai, instructs local elementary students as part of the West Philadelphia Tutoring Project. At the same time, she teaches English to West African immigrants for an after-school program at Henry C. Lea Elementary School. Similarly, Mark Metryoos, a senior at Notre Dame’s Mendoza College and President of the 2,000-member Wall Street Club, teaches financial literacy at a local high school. Here, he discovered that many students – particularly those in the First Generational Low Income (FGLI) category – lacked financial literacy and job search skills. From this epiphany, the Equity in Business InMy Sitesitiative (EBI) was born.\n“Largely because of Mark’s efforts, EBI provides programming and other resources to students who seek to fill in the gaps in their business comprehension,” explains Andrew Wendelborn, Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Studies at Mendoza. “From résumé preparation and money management workshops to career treks and graduate school visits, EBI serves to break down barriers for both business and non-business students while creating a strong community among them.”\nLAUNCHING INITIATIVES TO GIVE CLASSMATES MORE OPPORTUNITIES\nCaroline Mazur-Sarocka, Rice University\nIn fact, the Best & Brightest often launched initiatives that solidified their legacies at their schools. At Texas Christian University, Luke Swan, a Dean’s Scholar and finalist for the school’s Outstanding Senior Award, co-founded its Pickleball Club. Down I-45, Caroline Mazur-Sarocka calls Rice University home. Here, she is the captain of the Lacrosse team and President of the 500-member Rice Business Society. Along the way, she started the Investment Banking Bootcamp to provide training and alumni mentorship to sophomores and juniors looking to enter the field. Through Mazur-Sarocka’s leadership, the initiative has educated 100 students, while hitting 80% placement in recruiting.\n“After going through the finance recruiting process myself, it allowed me to share all the resources I had accessed,” she explains. “As the number of undergraduate students at Rice Business began to grow, I was worried that students would become competitive and the recruiting process would become more difficult for everyone. That inspired me to organize this event, bringing all students interested in investment banking together once a week over the course of a semester. Everyone bonded and quickly became friends, helping one another mock-interview and find the best internship opportunities.”\nCornell University’s Brian Kim-Koutsis identified a similar need at the Dyson School of Applied Economics and Business. He developed the Dyson Undergraduate Student Handbook after arriving on campus and realizing there was “no easy one-stop location” for answers on everything from classes to clubs to recruiting. For him, the handbook was a means to “level the playing field” for students.\n“Before arriving on campus, everyone has different levels of business knowledge and connections to Cornell,” he tells P&Q. “Some students have already completed internships at banks or have siblings who attended Cornell. Others start with a blank slate, similar to me. The purpose of the handbook is to increase accessibility to the information necessary to thrive in Dyson…I can now say with certainty that every future student entering Dyson will have a place to find answers to nearly all their questions, easing their stress and facilitating a successful transition to campus.”\nNext Page: Fun Facts and Advice to Future Students\nPages 3-4: 100 in-depth profiles of the 2025 Best & Brightest Business Majors\nDavid Elias Kurzmann, ESCP Business School\nEXCELLENCE IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP\nWhen the Class of 2025 wasn’t launching new clubs or initiatives, they were opening new businesses. Case in point: vipi.education from David Elias Kurzmann at ESCP Business School. Think of it as an interactive version of the Khan Academy. Unhappy with the tutoring available through his school, Kurzmann set out to create what he describes as a “student society organizing free student-to-student tutoring lectures.” Launched in 2022, vipi – “voluntary, independent pioneers of education” – has since expanded to 1,000 students across cities like London, Paris, Madrid, and Berlin. Even more, it now includes 11 topics ranging from Advanced Statistics to Microeconomics to Managerial Accounting. One Financial Accounting session even drew 134 students! Even more, vipi was considered so innovative that it earned Kurzmann the ESCP Dean’s Award in 2023 – making him the first underclassman to achieve this feat.\n“It was a concept I first developed during the COVID-19 pandemic for free online tutoring at local high schools,” Kurzmann explains. “The idea is simple: students with a better understanding of a subject help their peers for free in lecture-style tutoring sessions. In this way, the tutors gain a unique edge to their understanding and the students receive vis-à-vis explanations without pressure. This way, the entire community thrives, improving everyone’s learning experience.”\nAnd the Best & Brightest didn’t just launch ventures. They supported them too. Look no further than Alliance Manchester’s Jasper Lee, who was president of Accelerate ME – which he calls the “largest student-led startup accelerator in Northern England. Here, he led a 30-member in selecting startups and developing programming.\n“To date, we’ve distributed over £250K, and our alumni have raised over £45m in follow-on funding,” he tells P&Q. “I’m thrilled to be part of a community that helps break down barriers to entrepreneurship and turn ambitious ideas into reality.”\nFROM THE UN TO THE WHITE HOUSE\nTimothy Held, University of Tennessee\nIn some cases, the Class of 2025 shouldered responsibilities that mimicked their professors. At the University of Tennessee’s Haslam College, Timothy Held designed a machine learning model used to forecast how top college basketball players would perform in games. For her senior thesis, Wharton’s Daniel Babalola chose a stretch assignment. He has been hatching a computer model for radiologists to quantify lung cancer nodules.\n“Though lung cancer image classification is a well explored field, there is potential for novelty in identifying the presence of dissolving tumors post-treatment,” Babalola explains. “As someone with almost zero background in medicine prior to this thesis, it has been a fruitful intellectual exercise. Pushing myself to work in an unfamiliar field has forced me to adapt the frameworks I’ve developed in strategy and product management.”\nSome class members were even invited into the proverbial ‘room’ at the highest levels. For Purdue University’s Rachel Labi, that meant speaking to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on human trafficking. By the same token, Villanova University’s Olivia Hansen landed a coveted summer internship with the Joe Biden administration last summer.\n“Being in the White House at the intersection of political and business decisions for the betterment of the American people was an honor of a lifetime, and hopefully the beginning of a long career in improving the lives of others through business. Being accepted as one of only two individuals in the entire nation to intern in the Contract and Procurement Office is an accomplishment that I am beyond grateful for. My time serving in the Executive Office of the President was a transformative educational experience that I will never forget.”\nA FASHION MODEL, A WORLD TRAVELER, AND A JAZZ CAT\nHillary Simmons, University of Michigan\nThat said, Hillary Simmons’ biggest moment happened outside the spotlight. In 2023, she left the comforts of the University of Michigan’s Ross School to take a summer internship in New York City. For her, the big accomplishment was overcoming her wariness of risk and embracing growth.\n“I began my freshman year being afraid to go outside of my dorm after the sun went down,” Simmons admits. “However, I got to a point where I was willingly packing my suitcase to spend a summer by myself in the largest city in the country. From learning how to navigate the subway to immersing myself in diverse cultures and questioning my ways of being, spending the summer in New York City boosted my confidence in so many ways. I had to advocate for myself in ways I’d never had to before, and I learned so many things about myself…It was a lesson in the power of dreaming big.”\nAlas, the classroom and the office don’t define who the Class of 2025 is. Glenys Yevi, a University of Houston grad and Wells Fargo hire, is a fashion model who was part of New York Fashion Week in February. When Gregory Hilldrup isn’t preparing for medical school or running student government at the University of Richmond’s Robins School of Business, he is playing the conga and djembe drums. Maybe Hilldrup could jam with the University of Georgia’s V’shoi Garfield Emanuel, who is known for his “jazz bass solos and gigs around town with other jazz cats.”\nLooking for a world traveler? Indiana University’s Maggie Essmann has stepped foot in all seven continents. Seeking stories of adventure? Georgia Tech’s Logan Roach ran with the bulls in Pamplona between his freshman and sophomore year. Along with majoring in Accounting and Marketing at Georgetown University’s McDonough School, Matthew De Meulder co-hosts The Honky Tonk Show on radio. And let’s just say the University of Houston’s Daniel Kalathoor is getting an early start on his career.\n“I will be graduating at 20 years old, and a year early from university!”\nSydney Anne Drysdale Fairbairn, University of Denver\nTHE ONES WHO PAVED THE WAY\nMake no mistake: The Class of 2025 has plenty of people to thank along the way to graduation. Levi Grimm, an Information Systems and Entrepreneurship major at Miami University’s Farmer School, credits a high school teacher, Tom O’ Neill, for making him proactive in the face of adversity.\n“He left a lasting impact on how I approach opportunities and challenges. Mr. O’Neill instilled the mindset of thinking in terms of possibilities and seeing obstacles as opportunities. He believed that the best way to learn was by doing even if it meant failing forward. He urged me to be relentless in pursuing my goals and to see ‘no’ as a temporary barrier to ‘yes.’ It was the way he pushed and mentored me that ignited a fire to not admire the problems around me but to do something about them.”\nMarian University’s Zivan Mynhardt absorbed similar lessons from his father around sacrifice and work ethic. “Growing up in Cape Town, I watched him pour relentless effort into everything he did: long hours, no shortcuts, always pushing forward. That example wasn’t just inspiring; it essentially became my blueprint. He made it possible for me to study abroad, footing the bill for this journey. However, it’s more than that. He instilled a belief that hard work and resilience can overcome any obstacle.”\nFor Sydney Anne Drysdale Fairbairn, her mother’s support has literally been a life-saver. Diagnosed with a congenital heart defect, tomorrow was never a given for Drysdale Fairbairn growing up. Instead, she was guided by her parents’ axiom about her heart: “Push it to grow, but never to the point of breaking.” While she couldn’t play traditional sports, Drysdale Fairbairn became a Pilates instructor and a game statistician. These successes, she says, stemmed from the support she received at home.\n“I cannot fathom the strength it took for my parents to be handed a million-piece LEGO set with no instructions—just the dismaying counsel of “build it.” My mother did more than build, though; she created a life for me where limitations were not roadblocks, rather they were challenges to navigate. She never allowed me to be a victim of my condition. Instead, she instilled in me two principles that guide my life to this day: “For every one thing you can’t do, find the millions of things you can,” and “Always stop and smell the roses.”\nKassidy Allen, Texas Christian University\nWHAT LIES AHEAD?\nWhat lies ahead for Drysdale Fairbairn after earning her degree from the University of Denver’s Daniels College? Well, she is still working that part out. Long-term, she pictures herself paying forward the blessings she has received.\n“Given my personal health journey, I am committed to supporting children facing medical challenges. I aspire to serve on the board of a nonprofit dedicated to helping children with health conditions and disabilities, or, if possible, establish my own philanthropic initiative with that mission.”\nThe Best & Brightest harbor similar ambitions. After walking off the stage at Carnegie Mellon’s commencement, Chloe He hopes to work in two countries (“at least”) before opening her own bakery café. Olivia Hansen’s aspirations reflect a common dream among the Class of 2025: join the faculty and write a book. The same goes for Texas Christian’s University’s Kassidy Allen (Give a TED Talk) and Syracuse University’s Talia St. Angelo (Be featured in Times Square). Then again, Josh Novick just hopes to stay an engaged alum at the University of Virginia.\n“I aspire to come back to Grounds and McIntire one day as a guest speaker and try to get involved in all ways. Throughout my time here, I found the alums to be some of the most forward-thinking, kindest, and insightful connections and resources. I would love to give back to the place that has given me the most.”\nADVICE TO FUTURE BUSINESS MAJORS\nLooking back on the past four years, the Class of 2025 has some advice for the business majors following in their footsteps. For many students, grades and experience often take priority in business school. Still, USC Marshall’s Wednesday Satterlee observes that students can gain the biggest long-term return by emphasizing relationships.\n“You’ll hear this often in business school, but it’s true: your network is your net worth. Making meaningful connections with peers, professors, and co-workers is the best investment you can make in your early career. Do not take anyone for granted, you will always have something to learn from the people you meet, and you never know when your connections can lead to exciting opportunities.”\nIsabelle Layding, University of Pittsburgh\nAs a student, Isabelle Layding was involved in everything from leading the student consulting firm to handling logistics for Greek Week. Such experiences enabled her to test her mettle – and hone a wide range of skills. Her advice to prospective students? Say “Yes” to every opportunity at every turn.\n“The value of your business degree is directly related to your campus involvement, leadership experience, and work experience. Join clubs, talk to professors about their research – figure out what interests you and do something with it. So, if there’s a chance for you to stretch yourself by taking on a leadership position in a club, starting something new, or moving somewhere you’ve never been for an internship… do it, even if you’re uncomfortable for a little bit. The most pivotal moments of growth for me happened when I said “yes” to opportunities that seemed terrifying!”\nThe University of Minnesota’s Jillian Buenger, a future health strategist, would tag a corollary onto Layding’s advice: Always ask. “That’s true whether you want to learn more about a club; interested in a career that a professor of yours used to work in; or want to sit down to coffee with an upperclassman that you admire. You never know where one interaction will lead. For me, ‘just asking’ put me in the position to open so many more doors to chances and opportunities that would have passed me right by if I hadn’t just been brave for that one moment.”\nWhile many graduates are boxing up belongings and lining up apartments for the first ‘real’ jobs, others are still wrestling with what to do next. And that’s no big concern, says NYU Stern’s Alexander Talamonti, who himself is still seeking the right fit in software development. There’s plenty of time to find your way.\n“I would advise students to be open to trying different things and avoid stressing too much about not knowing what they want to do. In my opinion, it is better to have done many things and know what you don’t want to do than to silo yourself because you’re afraid to be late to the game. However, once you find something that you love, dive deep into it. Being passionate about something is a wonderful gift!”\nCongratulations, Class of 2025!
