Ukraine is losing territory and out of ammo, the world is focused on Israel, Russia's economy is growing and US aid is drying up... a brutally honest assessment\n- ***WARNING: CONTAINS GRAPHIC IMAGES***\nSaturday marks two years since February 24, 2022 - when Vladimir Putin ordered his armies to invade Ukraine.\nIn those 730 days, thousands of soldiers and civilians have been killed in brutal warfare - the likes of which has not been seen in Europe since the end of the Second World War, almost 80 years ago.\nThe first year saw Russian tanks reach the gates of Kyiv. Many feared the worst, but Ukraine's forces expelled the invaders from the north and - with lighting counteroffensives - pushed Putin's armies back east.\nWhile images from Ukraine at the time revealed the true brutality Putin's war, they also projected hope as Kyiv's soldiers marched forward - liberating swathes of their country that had fallen under Russian occupation.\nThe same cannot be said of photographs from the second year. With the summer counteroffensive of 2023 stalling, soldiers on both sides are now dug into trenches that stretch across hundreds of miles of eastern Ukraine, much of which has been turned into a battle-scarred wasteland.\nFatigue is setting in among Ukraine's soldiers and concerns grow over dwindling supplies of ammunition, waning optimism in the West and endless waves of Russian soldiers used as canon fodder by Putin's merciless generals.\nBut hope remains. Kyiv's armies have still dealt significant blows to their Russian advisories over the last 365 days, and the Ukrainian people continue to defend their homeland against the aggressor from the east.\nFrom the final days of the battle of Bakhmut, audacious strikes deep into Russian-held territory, the fall of Avdiivka, an attempted coup against Moscow, and the continued bravery of the Ukrainian people - MailOnline today looks back at some of the most memorable images from the second year of war in Ukraine.\nFEBRUARY 2023\nFEBRUARY 24, 2024: A Ukraine Army serviceman rests laying on
