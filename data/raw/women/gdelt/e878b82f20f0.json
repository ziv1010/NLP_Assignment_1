  "body_text": "Team GB have arrived at the Winter Olympics 2026 with an impressive array of talent amongst their ranks.\nBut they aren’t the only ones who have turned up in Italy with an enviable collection of stars, with TNT Sports and the BBC boasting their own star-studded line-ups.\nBoth broadcasters are bringing action from the Milano Cortina Games directly into the homes of UK audiences, with over 1000 hours of combined coverage promised to TV viewers.\nAnd given the lack of exposure British fans usually get to the 16 winter sports outside Olympic periods, the expertise provided by the TNT and BBC pundits will be particularly insightful for those of us tuning in to catch a glimpse of the fun on the snow and ice.\nHere are the presenters, pundits and commentators who will be featuring on our screens across the 17 days of competition.\nTNT Sports\nReshmin Chowdhury\nChowdhury is tasked with presenting the evening highlights show from the TNT Sports studio.\nAway from the Olympics, Chowdhury has established herself as one of the most popular hosts in football broadcasting, regularly fronting coverage of TNT’s Europa League and Conference League offering.\nOrla Chennaoui\nChennaoui will be well-known to viewers who regularly tune in to TNT Sport’s cycling output, where she fronts the channel’s coverage of the Grand Tours.\nThe Northern Irish presenter is hosting TNT’s hour-long studio show Buongiorno Milano each morning, which recaps events from the previous day as well as looking ahead to what that day’s action has in store.\nAimee Fuller\nFuller is a two-time Olympian, having represented Great Britain in the snowboard slopestyle in the 2014 and 2018 Games.\nFuller has been part of the BBC’s Winter Olympics coverage in recent years, but 2026 sees her take to the screens for TNT instead.\nAmy Williams\nWilliams’ memorable gold in the skeleton at Vancouver 2010 saw her become the first British athlete to claim gold in an individual event at the Winter Olympics for 30 years.\n16 years on from her history-making triumph, Williams is providing her expert opinion to viewers tuning into TNT Sport’s coverage of the sliding events.\nVicki Chalmers\nChalmers was part of the Scotland team that won a staggering six curling World Championship titles between 2011 and 2017.\nDespite the dominance enjoyed by Scotland at World Championship level, the team were unable to repeat the success when they came together to represent Great Britain in the 2014 Olympics, walking away from Sochi with bronze instead of the desired gold.\nTNT Sport's Winter Olympics line-up\nPresenters\n- Orla Chennaoui\n- Reshmin Chowdhury\nExperts and commentators\n- Amy Williams – former skeleton gold medallist\n- Aimee Fuller – two-time snowboard slopestyle

first British woman in almost 25 years to reach the final of the 100m.\nSince hanging up her running shoes, Kwakye has forged a successful path into broadcasting and is certainly no stranger to Olympic audiences, having presented the BBC’s TV coverage of the morning sessions from Beijing 2022 and Paris 2024.\nLizzy Yarnold\nYarnold is Great Britain’s most decorated Winter Olympian of all time with two gold medals to her name in the skeleton.\nAfter clinching top spot at the Sochi 2014 Games, Yarnold further cemented her position as a British Olympic legend by successfully defending her title four years later in Pyeongchang – the only gold medals that Great Britain won at either Olympics.\nChemmy Alcott\nThe popular former skier, who has seven British National Championships to her name, is a veteran of four Olympic Games, with a best-placed finish of 11th arriving in 2006 and 2010.\nAlcott is a regular fixture in the BBC’s Winter Olympics output and has been a presenter on Ski Sunday since retiring from the sport in 2014.\nVicky Wright\nWright is tasked with casting her expert eye over Great Britain’s quests to win gold in the curling events.\nMore Trending\nAnd Wright certainly knows what it takes to prevail on the biggest stage of all, with the Scottish curler part of the team that clinched gold at the last Winter Olympics under the guidance of skipper Eve Muirhead.\nMontell Douglas\nDouglas is the first and only female British athlete to have featured at both the Summer and Winter Games, having competed as a 100m sprinter at Beijing 2008 and as part of the two-woman bobsleigh team at Beijing 2022.\nDouglas will be better known to some viewers from her time on Gladiators, where she appeared as ‘Fire’ in the BBC’s reboot of the iconic show in
