He then got to work on a unique and specially commissioned England women's football Lioness doll.\nInspired by the recent successes of the Lionesses, Eric said: “I watched with joy as the England Ladies Football team lifted the Euro 2022 trophy aloft last summer.\n\"It was at that moment I realised that an England Ladies doll would be a perfect gift for her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte.”\nThe doll, inspired by Eric Powell MBE, wears a full England Ladies home team strip which was hand stitched and designed by Kulthida Richardson known locally as Minthra, a local seamstress from Middlesbrough. The doll’s strip bears the number 2 referring to the fact that the Princess was the second born. It also has the Princesses name emblazoned on the back.\nMinthra said “I was approached by Eric Powell MBE who asked If I could make a replica kit for a doll which would be sent to her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte. At first, I thought it was a wind up but when he showed me the letter from Kensington Palace I knew it was the real thing.”\nThere has been a huge rise in the popularity of women's football since the Lionesses Euro's success. Prince William and Princess Charlotte even recorded a special message to the team prior to the finals, with the young Princess sending her best wishes to the inspiring sports stars.\nREAD NEXT:\n- Paedophile who says he feels 'physically sick' about watching child abuse images avoids prison\n- Former hardman Brian Cockerill living in fear as campaign of terror escalates to 'firebombs' at home\n- Venue's landlord 'starting all over again' after tenants leave popular bar\n- Dog walking area scrapped from £500k park overhaul as improvements start date looms\n- For breaking news in your area direct to your inbox every day, go here to sign up to our free newsletter",
