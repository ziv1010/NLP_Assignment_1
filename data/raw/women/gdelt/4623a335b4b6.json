  "body_text": "Renée Slegers could have no complaints following Wednesday's impressive 4-0 win away to OH Leuven.\nWe convincingly beat the Belgian side in the UEFA Women's Champions League quarter-final play-off first leg.\nOur head coach was delighted with the performance, and after the match, she said: \"Happy, everything we wanted. Clean sheets, goals, good performances, a lot of players involved, a lot of players contributing to the team's performances. Really happy.\n\"This was only the first half, so we still have those 90 minutes to play at home, but it's a really good starting position for the second leg.\n\"There were some really good goals. I think, again, three out of the four, I have to watch them back, but they are such good goals, all the way, how we combine and build up to that final finish.\n\"Really happy with how the team is performing.\"\nRenée handed Kim Little her 400th appearance on the night, and was more than happy to field questions about our captain.\n\"She's a top professional,\" she said. \"I think anyone you would ask about Kim, what do you think when you see Kim as a football player? It's her professionalism. She does everything. She has such high standards.\n\"She does everything to be as good as possible in her own performances and for the team. She gets herself ready for every challenge. She's always reflecting and learning.\nShe wants to do things the best way possible, so she's special to work with. She's very humble and I think we want to be humble as a team. We play with big belief and I think Kim embodies that and spreads that to the team.\"\nThere was also a word for the supporters that made the trip out to Belgium to create another memorable atmosphere at Den Dreef.\n\"They were amazing as always,\" Renée said. \"I think 800 fans in the stands, we could hear them during the warm-up getting us ready.\n\"I just left the pitch and they were still singing. They stayed in the stadium for so long. I'm so happy that we can give them the performances and the results because they deserve it as well because they're such good supporters.\"\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
