  "body_text": "This article was updated to reflect the Thursday June 5 announcement that the Denver NWSL ownership group has been finalized.\nDenver – The Denver NWSL ownership group keeps growing and is getting more familiar faces to Colorado sports fans. On Tuesday morning, the Women’s Soccer expansion club announced that former Denver Bronco and Hall of Fame quarterback Payton Manning has joined the ownership group.\nManning is one of the most recognized athletes in Colorado and America. He’s one of the most beloved athletes in Denver behind John Elway, maybe Joe Sakic. We’ll see about Nikola Jokić.\nTwo Super Bowls, one with the Broncos. Five MVPs. He does a bunch of NFL media. He’s in a bunch of commercials. He’s likable and successful.\n“It’s a real honor to be part of something so meaningful to the Colorado community,” said Manning. “I’m proud to support the growth of women’s sports and excited to help build a club that our city and our state can rally behind.”\n“His impact on Colorado sports is unmatched, and we’re incredibly proud to have him as a partner. He brings passion, insight, and deep local roots — all of which will help us shape the future of Denver NWSL,” said controlling owner Rob Cohen.\nThis club’s ownership group and front office are growing by the week. World champions skier Mikaela Shiffrin joined as an owner recently. They’ve hired Jen Millet as President and Curt Johnson as General Manager. Both have good NWSL resumes.\nIt’s a good question how much of the club is still up for sale. The front page of Google estimates Manning is worth $250 million so he might have bought in for more than Mikaela Shiffrin. Cohen is still described as the “controlling owner” in club press releases. So he has to have at least a plurality stake, but probably 51% or more. Peyton might have bought 10%.\nAnother likable and familiar face who can be a good ambassador for the club and help pay for a few transfer fees for a star player or two. Maybe Denver beats Gotham next fall and he makes a joke to Eli on Monday Night Football about it.\nWith this, Denver NWSL confirmed that they have finalized their ownership groups:\n- Rob Cohen\n- Ariel Investments’ Project Level, led by Denver NWSL Alternate Governor\nMellody Hobson - FirstTracks Sports Ventures: Siblings Jon-Erik Borgen, Kaia Borgen Moritz and\nRandi Borgen - Neelima Joshi and Dhiren Jhaveri\n- Molly Coors\n- Mikaela Shiffrin\n- Peyton Manning\n- Cordillera Investment Partners\n- The Soin Family Led by Vishal Soin\n- Brooke Woody\n- For Denver FC Capital Partners (SPV): Ben Hubbard, Tom Dunmore, Jordan Angeli and Nicole Glaros, and Stacy Carter, among others.\n“Each investor brings a unique perspective and deep commitment to supporting women’s sports. Together, we’re building something that will reflect the values and spirit of Colorado and have a lasting impact in our community,” said Cohen.\nThere’s still two potential hiccups to await the outcome of. The club and local politicians have described the stadium and training ground as a “public private partnership.” There’s the question of how much tax revenue is going to that and the economic development that comes out of that. Does ownership try to get a cut of any TIF (tax incentive financing)?\nSecondly, Curt Johnson was in the front office at Carolina Courage when Paul Riley was head coach. Riley is now banned from the NWSL after it was found that he engaged in sexual coercion and verbal abuse of players while at Carolina and Portland Thorns. What does Johnson believe he could have done differently to prevent that from happening? What will he and others do to ensure this club is a safe and healthy working environment for players and female staff?\nPhoto Credit: For Denver FC\nThank you for reading Burgundy Wave.
