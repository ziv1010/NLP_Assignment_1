Regardless of what point of their careers the athletes were at, both players had a lot to play for.\nDjokovic was playing to win his 25th Grand Slam victory, which would have made him the first ever to do so, and also the oldest ever player to win a major tournament. For the 22-year-old Alcaraz, he was fighting to be the youngest player in tennis history to win all four major grand slams, a feat that he achieved in a four set thriller.\nThe UFC returned to Sydney for the first time since 2023, and boy did it put on a show for the sold out Qudos Bank Arena. The afternoon streamed on Paramount+ was headlined by Alexander “The Great” Volkanovski defending his featherweight world champion status against Brazilian Diego Lopes. On home soil, in front of 20,000 fanatics, Volkanovski showed off his composure and mixed martial arts skills, claiming a unanimous decision result.\nView this post on Instagram\nWelcome back to B&T’s Spotlight on Sponsors series, where we break down all the major sponsorship news from inside the sporting world.\nThis week we take a closer look into the AFL, where brands have been pouncing on opportunities. Specifically, Prime Video has released an official trailer for an AFL docuseries, Grant Burge Wines has poured themselves into the AFL and AFLW signing on as as the official wine partner, and KFC has extended its finger licking good partnership with the Collingwood Magpies for a further five seasons.

Executive produced by Paul Martin, James Gay-Rees, Hillary Olsen, Nick Batzias, Charlotte Wheaton and Dan Colless as the showrunner.\nSince 2019, Prime Video has collaborated with the AFL to produce three local Prime Original projects that have offered unprecedented access to the league, its players, and the broader cultural impact of Australian football.

The AFL and AFLW have a unique connection to Australian culture, and we’re proud to have Grant Burge Wines as the official wine of the game, alongside Vinarchy as the official wine partner of Marvel Stadium,” concluded Vinarchy CEO, Danny Celoni.\n“We’re excited to connect with consumers in a way that feels relevant and inspiring, pairing moments of passion and performance with the same dedication and quality that define our wines.”\nCollingwood Magpies x KFC\nThe Collingwood Football Club and KFC have extend their finger licking goof partnership, with the iconic household brand renewing its commitment to the black and white for a further five years.\nThe new deal will see KFC continue to be the Premier Partner across the club’s AFL and AFLW programs.\nSince coming on board in 2021, the familiar red logo has been featured across Collingwood’s AFL guernseys, including on the back of the guernsey worn in the victorious 2023 AFL Grand Final.\n“We are incredibly fortunate to have long-term and loyal partners at Collingwood and we are pleased to have KFC further extend their commitment to us for another five years,” said Collingwood CEO, Craig Kelly.\n“When KFC first partnered with us, we were undergoing a period of change, with Craig McRae coming on board as Senior Coach. Since then, alongside KFC, we have continued to go from strength to strength across all areas of our Club. We are proud to align with a global brand like KFC and we look forward to another five years of working alongside each other.”\n“For the past four years, KFC and Collingwood have been serving up an unbeatable combo and we’re thrilled to continue the partnership for another five. We love backing the footy community and we’re proud to continue supporting both the men’s and women’s teams as the Pies step into another massive chapter,” concluded KFC CMO Vanessa Rowed.\nWith Collingwood one of four AFL teams that the Colonel sponsors, KFC are well and truly entrenched in the sport. KFC also sponsor Port Adelaide, Collingwood, Richmond, and Hawthorn.\nAtlassian Williams F1 Team x Anthropic\nAnthropic and Atlassian Williams F1 have signed a multi-year partnership, making Claude the team’s Official Thinking Partner.\nClaude will be integrated across the entire Williams organisation, working alongside engineers and team strategists to support how the team thinks, plans, and performs across race strategy, car development, and operations. With Formula 1 entering its biggest regulatory change in a generation, Claude will support the team’s ability to make the improvements that count.\nClaude is Anthropic’s frontier AI. Teams will use Claude to debug reams of code, analyse dense research, and build entirely new products—helping them ask better questions, challenge assumptions, and make clearer decisions under pressure.\nWilliams has built nine Constructors’ Championships on ingenuity and innovation—finding crucial milliseconds that deliver results on track. Like Anthropic, it started as outsiders who believe thinking differently is the key to winning.\nAs one of F1’s few remaining independent teams, that resourcefulness remains central to how it competes.\nUnder team principal James Vowles, with drivers Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon, Williams finished fifth last season. Now, Atlassian Williams F1 Team is thinking with Claude as the team enters 2026 with clear ambition: to take the next step towards returning to the front of the grid.\nClaude branding will appear on Atlassian Williams F1 Team’s FW48 cars, drivers, and team kit that started with the 2026 livery reveal on February 3. This will be the first chapter in a multi-year partnership that both organisations hope will prove the value of thoughtful AI in high-stakes environments.“We are thrilled to welcome Anthropic to Atlassian Williams F1 Team and Claude as our Official Thinking Partner. At a time when our team is on a journey to the front, this partnership is an opportunity for us to show what’s possible when you combine elite human talent with the right frontier models. We know that there are no shortcuts to success and look forward to working with Anthropic to continue building long-lasting performance,” said James Vowles, team principal, Atlassian Williams F1 Team.\n“Formula 1 is ultimately about the pairing of human endeavour and technical excellence. I’ve watched Atlassian Williams F1 Team find ways to punch above their weight for years, that’s exactly the kind of team Claude is built for,” added Mike Krieger, co-lead of Anthropic Labs.\n“We chose Atlassian Williams F1 Team because they’re one of F1’s last truly independent teams—they compete on the quality of their thinking and their attention to detail. When we met James and his team, we recognised that immediately. They are world class problem solvers, focused on the smallest details, that’s the same drive that animates Anthropic. It’s why this partnership felt right from the first conversation,” concluded Andrew Stirk, head of brand marketing at Anthropic.\nThe Ripper GC x Hahn\nHahn is swinging big in 2026, recruiting a brand-new partnership with Ripper GC, becoming an official sponsor of one of golf’s most electric teams. From the first tee to the 19th hole, it’s a natural fit: great mates, great banter and a great beer backing an all-Aussie team ready to rip in.\nThe Ripper GC team is led by Cameron Smith and joined by fellow Australians Marc Leishman, Lucas Herbert and the newest member of the team, Elvis Smylie. The Ripper GC team has quickly built a reputation for big energy, bold play and an unmistakably Australian spirit.Hahn’s partnership with Ripper GC will come to life across Adelaide, with Hahn ensuring that Aussie golf fans get behind the all-Aussie team on Tour. As fans flood into the city for what many regard as the biggest event on the LIV Tour (mainly Aussies), Ripper GC and Hahn will be unmissable.\nFor Hahn, the partnership is a natural fit.\n“The Hahn and Ripper GC partnership just makes sense,” said Alex Honson, brand partnership leader at Lion. “They’re a team that competes hard out on the course, but also know the simple\nenjoyment of a post-round beer with mates. They play hard, live loud and back each other, and that balance of performance and enjoyment is exactly what Hahn stands for.\n“We’re hopeful that the Aussie public get behind the Aussie team competing on the world stage, whether they’re taking in the action from Ripper House, the local sports bar or their own house, we want fans to cheer on the Ripper GC team, with a Hahn in hand of course!”\nThere’ll be a number of designated Ripper GC clubhouse venues across Adelaide where fans will be able to enjoy a Hahn for their chance to win 1 of 500 Ripper Supporter packs including a Hahn x Ripper GC cap that has a glorious blonde mullet flowing from the back.“The mullet caps perfectly encapsulate this team and this partnership, they allow fans to get behind their team and have a bit of fun in the process” added Honson.\nAs the build up continues in the coming weeks, participating venues will also give fans the opportunity to get up close to the action, cheering on the Ripper team from Ripper Point as the boys push for victory on the final Sunday of the event.\n“This team is built on trust, chemistry and doing things our own way,” commented Ripper GC general manager, Nick Adams, “Hahn gets that. It’s about big moments, shared experiences and enjoying a beer that goes the distance.”\nTeam captain and global star Smith said the partnership felt authentic from the outset.\n“We’re Aussies at heart… we compete hard on the weekend but we’re also good mates off the course, we’re always up for a beer and some light hearted banter once the job’s done,” he admitted. “Hahn fits perfectly into that rhythm. It’s a great beer to enjoy with your mates after a day out on the course, and we’re stoked to have them backing us.”",
