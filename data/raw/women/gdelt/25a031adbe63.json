  "body_text": "Marc Skinner shares an update on Man Utd contract extension talks\n- Man Utd manager Marc Skinner is out of contract this summer\n- Skinner has expressed his hopes of remaining in charge\n- The side currently occupy second spot in the WSL standings\nMarc Skinner has expressed his desire to remain as Manchester United head coach as his contract approaches its expiration this summer.\nThe 41-year-old penned a new one-year deal with the club in May 2024, which included an option to extend for a further year. United have until the end of this month to trigger the extension clause to take the contract to 2026, but will be able to negotiate a new deal with Skinner beyond that deadline.\n\"It's a conversation that's ongoing and they have to inform me by the end of the month whether it's an option or whether it's a contract conversation,\" Skinner expressed.\n\"I'd love to stay, because I feel that there is unfinished business.\"\n\"I really want to take this club and this team. We've designed and built a young team, and I feel it has the imprint, the DNA, of a real famous Manchester United team. So I want to see that through, and I want to make sure that the fans and everybody know that I have that complete energy.\n\"I think you've seen this from last year, it has changed in a totally positive direction, where it's all about driving this club forwards. With all the things that are thrown at us we're going to be able to make sure that we direct it in the way that we want to. So I want to stay, I want to stay and make sure that we reach the successes I think this club can.\"\nFollowing the dismissal of Manchester City boss Gareth Taylor, Skinner is now the longest-serving manager in the Women's Super League (WSL), having led United since July 2021.\nUnited are currently second in the WSL standings, eight points adrift of leaders Chelsea, with a game in hand and still to face the reigning champions at home before the season ends. The Red Devils haven't lost a game since a narrow 1-0 defeat away to Chelsea in November, and are seeking an eighth consecutive league win when they travel to Liverpool on Friday night.\nAfter a turbulent start to the 2024/25 campaign, Skinner believes that the uptick in form is down to a change in spirit around the dressing room.\n\"I think there's a little bit of that spirit again. It's always been the same type of spirit, but it feels [the same as] two years ago when were trying to push for that that title,\" the United boss admitted.\n\"I think from the start of the season, we've we've just gotten used to each other. So I think that experience together has helped us to get those games over the line, and those experiences of taking those tough kind of results.\"\nReflecting on his tenure at United, the head coach shared that he has learned to adapt to the pressures that come with the job.\n\"I think that I learn lots every day about dealing with pressure, who I am under pressure, how I have to lead under that pressure, how I try not to let those pressures get to the people I work with. Those pressures can be good and bad, but we don't have to shift to the bad pressure,\" Skinner said.\n\"You know that there's good pressure of being Manchester United manager as well. So it's constantly seeing what you do be scrutinised when really, there's not really the full story. I think that can be a challenge that I've had to learn to deal with, but in reality, it's trying to remain human while being in a job that tries to change and adapt you as a human all the time.\"",
