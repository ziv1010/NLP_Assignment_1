  "body_text": "COLLEGE FOOTBALL\nJordan McCloud could play for his fourth college team, announcing this weekend his intentions to enter the NCAA transfer portal yet again. But first, the James Madison quarterback – who began his career with South Florida and then played for Arizona – will play one final game for the Dukes.\nMcCloud confirmed, through a JMU spokesperson Saturday, that he intends to play in the Dukes’ bowl game, despite having his name in the NCAA transfer portal. JMU will learn its bowl destination Sunday.\nMcCloud was the Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year this season after leading JMU to an 11-1 record and accounting for 3,711 offensive yards and 40 touchdowns.\nCurt Cignetti, the Sun Belt Coach of the Year, accepted the head coaching position at Indiana on Thursday, but plans to coach JMU in its first-ever bowl appearance. Cignetti has led the Dukes to a 19-4 record in their two FBS transition seasons, posting the East Division’s best record both times.\nSources at JMU told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that the team expects many – if not most – of the players who have entered the transfer portal to play in the bowl.\nDefensive back Chauncey Logan entered the portal. He had 59 tackles, 18 pass deflections, four tackles for loss and two interceptions with JMU.\nCOLLEGE WOMEN’S SOCCER\nFSU, Stanford reach NCAA final in Cary\nFlorida State and Stanford moved to the NCAA College Cup final with victories Friday night in Cary, North Carolina, where the championship match will be held Monday night.\nThe Seminoles (21-0-1) advanced to their seventh championship match with a 2-0 win over ACC rival Clemson.\nKaitlyn Zipay’s volley in the 37th minute put FSU ahead. In the 53rd minute, Hermann Trophy semifinalist Jordynn Dudley, a freshman, doubled the lead.\nStanford’s goals from Allie Montoya and Maya Doms in the first five minutes, followed by outstanding defense against Brigham Young’s relentless attack, gave the Cardinal (20-0-4) a 2-0 triumph.\nFor the first time in championship history, both College Cup finalists boast undefeated records.",
