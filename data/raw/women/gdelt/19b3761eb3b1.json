Also locked up was a takeaway owner who collapsed to the floor as he was jailed after being unmasked as a sex offender and a cowardly hit and run driver who hit and killed a \"fit and healthy\" grandad.\nLiverpool Crown Court also heard the case of two shop workers who thought they had got away with their crime. The court heard the staff members burgled the store where they worked to cover up the fact they had been repeatedly stealing from the safe.\nIn another case, a \"cowardly\" van driver who sped through a red light and struck an elderly jogger before leaving him dying in the street was also sentenced this week. Here are the faces of 20 people who are now locked up for the crimes they have committed.\nPaul Dryhurst\nPaul Dryhurst, 33, of Gale Road in Litherland was jailed for two years after admitting violent disorder. Liverpool Crown Court heard how he \"smiled in satisfaction\" after hurling a missile at police, but was recognised by an officer he went to school with.\nDavid Engleby\nEngleby was seen filming the violence in Southport on his mobile phone and chanting \"Allah, Allah, who the f*** is Allah?\". The 29-year-old, of Scarisbrick New Road in Southport, then \"surged forward with the crowd\" before picking a brick up from the floor and throwing it towards PCs.\nHe subsequently followed this up with a second \"projectile\". Engleby was identified from video footage provided to the police and handed himself in at Southport Police Station on August 12, having been circulated as wanted. Engleby nodded and gave a thumbs up after being locked up for 28 months.\nLuke Summerfield\nSummerfield, of Mansfield Street in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, was shown on footage \"throwing a projectile towards the police\" and then \"with a group of males attacking an individual for an unknown reason\", although he was said to be \"in a more peace making role\". The 29-year-old was previously handed a 21-month suspended prison sentence for conspiracy to produce cannabis in 2016. He was jailed for 26 months.\nSentencing, Judge Denis Watson KC said: \"David Engleby, you can be seen picking up and item - a brick - and throwing it at the police, and then throwing a second missile at the police. Paul Dryhurst, you are visible joining the same large, aggressive mob. You can be seen picking up and item and throwing it before smiling in satisfaction. Luke Summerfield, you can be seen to pick up an item and throw that at the police.\n\"Those who choose to participate in such disorder - causing injury, damage and fear to communities - will inevitably be punished with sentences designed to deter others from similar activity.\"\nJoshua Jones\n\"Football hooligan\" Joshua Jones claimed to have attended a three-mile charity walk in memory of the victims of the Southport stabbings before \"things got out of hand\". Joshua Jones repeatedly hurled missiles towards police officers as violent scenes unfolded in the seaside town following the killings of six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice DaSilva Aguiar, nine.\nUnder interview, he \"stated that he went to Southport to attend the vigil\" and \"referenced taking part in a three-mile charity walk to support the murdered children\". Jones declined to watch any of the CCTV and said he \"couldn't remember anything\" due to his undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, ADHD and autism.\nJones, who previously worked as the manager of a gym in Spain, admitted violent disorder, possession of an offensive weapon in a private place and breaching a suspended sentence order. His partner sat in tears in the public gallery as he was jailed for 38 months.\nAndrew Jackson\nJackson hurled 14 bottles at police before casually walking away from the scene, but tried to run when officers came knocking at his door two weeks later. He became embroiled within violent scenes which unfolded in Southport\nUnder interview, Jackson \"denied being any part of the violent disorder\". However in court Jackson admitted violent disorder and possession of cannabis. Appearing in the dock with a shaved head and sporting a grey Berghaus t-shirt, he was jailed for 32 months.\nLuke Moran\nMoran smashed the window of a police van with a concrete slab as a PC sat in the driver's seat. A judge described his actions as being \"as bad a case as he has seen\" in relation to the riots.\nThe court heard how he took a \"large piece of concrete\" and began smashing the driver's side window with it while Police Constable James Hayes sat in the driver's seat.\nMoran, of Leybourne Avenue in Birkdale, then \"began to try to rip the wing mirror off\" and was later seen holding a \"large chunk\" of debris in his hands and, with \"gritted teeth\", raising the implement above his head and striking the window three times. PC Hayes said he \"feared for his life\" and retreated into the back of the van.\nMoran was subsequently circulated as wanted by Merseyside Police and handed himself in at Copy Lane Police Station on August 14. He gave a prepared statement under interview following his arrest saying that \"he was sorry\" and \"he had no intent to cause serious injury or harm\".\nMoran, who blew a kiss to his supporters in the public gallery at one stage during the hearing admitted violent disorder and was jailed for three years.\nNicholas Sinclair\nNicholas Sinclair, of Bury Road, in Birkdale, hurled bricks towards police officers as violent scenes unfolded in Southport. He was seen \"shouting towards the police and throwing missiles\" including bricks, as well as \"pointing and shouting\" and \"motioning for others to move forward into the surge of people as they pressed upon the police cordon\".\nThe 38-year-old was later recorded \"rummaging in bins and bin bags\" in the street. Sinclair handed himself in at Copy Lane Police Station on August 14 after footage of him was released as part of a public appeal by the force. He was jailed for 28 months after admitting violent disorder.\nTerry Godwin\nA vile sex offender sexually assaulted a young girl on hundreds of occasions and tried to buy her silence with cash. Terry Godwin's horrific crimes remained a dark secret for years.\nHis victim has been left with a \"horrible shadow\" lingering over her \"for as long as she can remember\" as a result of the countless assaults. Decades later, her abuser has finally been brought to justice.\nGodwin admitted a total of 42 child sex offences including indecent assault and gross indecency with a child at Liverpool Crown Court. Appearing via video link to HMP Liverpool, he was jailed for seven years - of which he must serve at least two thirds before becoming eligible for release - and handed an additional year on licence.\nHe was also handed a 20-year sexual harm prevention order and a restraining order banning him from contacting his victim for life. He will be required to sign the sex offenders' register indefinitely.\nBarry Simm\nA cyclist told suspicious police officers he was on his way to buy weed before being caught with more than £700 worth of class A drugs. Barry Simm, 45, of Gosford Street, Toxteth, was stopped by police while cycling around Dingle on July 31 last year.\nHe had £25 cash on him, and told the officers he was going to buy cannabis. The officers set their sights on him, and when they saw him again a short time later, they once again stopped him and found he had £45 in his possession. He then told them he had \"white and brown on him\".\nHe had 19 wraps of heroin on him with a street value of £380, and 33 wraps of crack cocaine with a value of £330.

The 53-year-old was arrested on August 13 at Manchester Airport, which the ECHO understands came as he was returning from a holiday in Greece.\nWhen interviewed, the dad-of-three told detectives that he had \"been at a public house and noticed a large group gathering and went to see what was happening\". Whitehead \"accepted throwing an item\" but said he \"didn't believe it had hit any of the officers\". He has 18 previous convictions for 47 offences between 1987 and 1998.\nWhitehead admitted violent disorder.

He claimed he visited the seaside town to \"pay his respects\" to the victims but instead snorted cocaine and trashed a police van.\nCarrigan, of Preston Grove in Anfield, was seen kicking at a police van and throwing two items \"one after the other\" at one of its windows. The 41-year-old handed himself in at St Anne Street Police Station on August 14 after being circulated as wanted.\nUnder interview, he \"accepted he was involved in the violent disorder and causing damage to the police carrier\" and said he had taken the train to Southport \"with the intention of paying his respects\". But, having taken cocaine and seen a \"large crowd gathering\", Carrigan stated he \"got carried away and threw bottles\" at the van.\nHe added he \"doesn't know why he got involved\", but was \"venting frustration at the government\". His criminal record shows convictions for eight offences, including battery in 2007 and being handed a suspended prison sentence for racially-aggravated assault in 2016 after telling a traffic warden \"he should return back to his own country\".\nCarrigan, who made a love heart sign with his hands towards his supporters in the public gallery at one stage during the hearing, pleaded guilty to violent disorder and criminal damage. He nodded and said \"thank you\" after being jailed for 32 months, then added \"love you mum, don't be angry, love yous all\" as he was led to cells.\nJake Lowther\nA \"well behaved and hard working\" man ruined his life during one night of madness. Jake Lowther had never found himself in trouble with the police before he hurled missiles at officers as violent scenes unfolded in Southport following the fatal stabbings of six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and nine-year-old Alice Da Silva Aguiar last month.\nLowther, of Abrams Fold in Banks, was captured on video throwing \"two pieces of rock or concrete\" towards PCs and was \"seen to be part of the mob as it moved towards officers\". The 20-year-old then \"appeared to meet up with another male and a female\" and left the scene with them.\nHe was subsequently circulated as wanted by Merseyside Police and handed himself in at Copy Lane Police Station on August 11. Under interview following his arrest, Lowther told detectives he \"threw a block of concrete\" then \"went back and threw stones\" but had \"no intention to hit anyone\".\nThe landscape gardener added that he \"got caught up in the moment\", having travelled to Southport with friends by car to \"drive past the vigil\".

He nodded when his mum told him \"love you, it's ok\" as he was led to the cells, while she added \"thank you, thank you\" to the judge as she left the courtroom.\nNathan Knox\nA heroin dealer who stashed drugs inside Kinder Eggs threw his ill-gotten gains to the floor after being caught red-handed. Nathan Knox, 24, was stopped by police officers on patrol in Warrington on July 16 after they had been alerted to the problem of drug dealing in the area.\nKnox, of Chesterfield Drive, Kirkby, was searched by the officers on Statham Avenue. They found two Kinder Eggs containing wraps of white and brown powder, and another large bag believed to contain drugs. Knox was arrested, and when he was, he threw £360 cash on the floor - which was also promptly seized.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard was found with five plastic wraps of cocaine worth up to £100, and four wraps of heroin worth £40, and the large bag was found to contain a further 84 wraps of heroin worth £840. His Nokia phone was seized, however, police were unable to download its contents as it was not compatible with their technology.\nPaul Wood, defending Knox, asked for the case to be adjourned while a pre-sentence report to aid the dad-of-one's mitigation was prepared. But Judge Simon Medland said Knox had failed to communicate with the service, asking \"Does it need to be enscrolled on parchment and delivered on horseback to be acknowledged by him?\" He was sentenced to 32 months in prison.\nJohn Mozley and Ben Tyler\nTwo shop workers burgled their own shop to cover up the fact they had been repeatedly stealing from its safe. John Mozley and Ben Tyler were employed as store manager and shop assistant respectively at Today's Extra on Thelwall New Road in Warrington when they plotted the audacious scheme to hide the fact they had stolen thousands of pounds.\nMozley and Tyler attempted to throw other staff members and police off their trail to cover up the significant amount of money that was no longer present. Text messages from Tyler's seized mobile phone revealed he and Mozley had been repeatedly stealing from the store's safe as well as the tills, leaving it short thousands of pounds.\nThe duo had planned the burglary to account for the missing money and, during the night of the failed burglary attempt, Tyler had texted Mozley saying he \"couldn't get on (in)\" to the store and to call him as soon as possible. Officers also located a spade at the rear of the location that had likely been used to gain access to the building. A later forensic examination would provide a DNA match to Tyler.\nCCTV footage also captured Mozley stealing cash and stock from the store. Tyler, 35 and of Pelham Road in Warrington, and Mozley, 55 and of Ringwood Close, also in Warrington, were sentenced to two years and 30 months' imprisonment respectively.\nTommy Callaghan\nA gas engineer who joined in racist chants and threw objects at police in Southport has been jailed for two years and two months. Tommy Callaghan, 32, of Platt Bridge, Wigan, appeared via videolink from HMP Altcourse at Liverpool Crown Court, where footage was played showing him wearing a fluorescent yellow T-shirt and sunglasses in a \"large and aggressive mob\" on July 30.\nViolent scenes broke out in the town on the day after the murder of three children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance event. People had gathered near a mosque in Southport after false information spread claiming the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard Callaghan was one of those chanting \"who the f*** is Allah\" with his \"left arm and fist raised as you chanted and gesticulated in rhythm\". He also was part of the mob who surged through the police line and threw a brick at a police van and a further missile.\nThe court also heard Callaghan had put his business, through which he employed three people, and the mortgaged home he shared with his partner and nine-month-old daughter \"at risk.\"\nChristopher Daly\nA \"cowardly\" van driver sped through a red light and struck an elderly jogger before leaving him dying in the street. John Newton was out jogging on February 25 this year when he was hit by a Ford Transit van as he crossed Utting Avenue East in Norris Green.\nThe \"fit and healthy\" grandad, who still worked as a part-time mechanic, died in hospital aged 81 the following day as a result of his \"catastrophic\" injuries. Motorist Christopher Daly, who has been banned from the roads for more than 20 years, callously fled the scene of the crash then denied that he had been driving when the police came knocking at his door.\nA trial at Liverpool Crown Court heard the 42-year-old, of Walton Village, Walton, was travelling along the 30mph limit road in the early evening when he switched lane without indicating \"in close proximity\" to another vehicle to his rear. Then, as the dad approached the junction of Parthenon Drive and Lorenzo Drive, a set of traffic lights changed from green to amber.\nInstead of stopping however, Daly sped up to between 44 and 56 mph. The lights changed to red before he passed through them. Mr Newton was meanwhile crossing the road at the other side of the junction while out for a jog and was struck by Daly's van.\nMr Newton suffered \"catastrophic injuries\" as a result of the incident and died in hospital on February 26 from \"massive blunt force head and chest injuries\". Daly meanwhile sped off from the scene of the crash, leaving his victim lying gravely injured in the road and later abandoned his \"extensively damaged\" vehicle, but was later linked to the van by his fingerprints.\nWhen arrested he also claimed he had not been the driver. Daly was unanimously found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving by a jury of six men and six women, having previously admitted causing death by careless driving.\nHe also pleaded guilty to causing death by driving while disqualified and uninsured. Daly was later jailed to 12 years in prison and showed no reaction when sentenced.\nAbdulrahman Al-Nomire\nA takeaway owner collapsed to the floor as he was jailed after being unmasked as a predatory sex offender. Abdulrahman Al-Nomire \"presented a wholesome face to the outside world\", including being the founder of several community initiatives for kids and families.\nBut the businessman hid a secret past, having subjected a girl to years of sexual abuse when she was aged as young as five. He wept uncontrollably as he was finally brought to justice.\nLiverpool Crown Court heard the 41-year-old, of Wavertree Road in Edge Hill, would \"grind on top of\" his victim in acts which were described as \"simulated intercourse\". These assaults continued over the course of around three years, leaving her \"uncomfortable and scared\".\nAl-Nomire was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault by a jury. Appearing via video link to HMP Liverpool, he put his head in his hands and began wailing when he was told that he would be required to sign the sex offenders' register for life and handed a restraining order and sexual harm prevention order - both lasting for 10 years.\nThe defendant became emotional to such an extent that Judge Brian Cummings KC called a break in proceedings midway through his sentencing remarks. Al-Nomire then fell off his chair in the video link booth and continued crying on the floor.\nOnce court was reassembled, he was jailed for four-and-a-half years - a term of which he will be required to serve at least two thirds before becoming eligible for release - and handed an additional four years on licence\nAlan Murphy\nAn escaped prisoner who was found with a nail bomb, two imitation firearms and a knife was planning to blow up a bank after watching a Netflix documentary, a court has heard. Alan Murphy, 62, was jailed for 15 years at Liverpool Crown Court and given an extended licence period of five years after Judge Neil Flewitt KC ruled he was a dangerous offender who the public required protection from.\nThe court heard Murphy, who had a string of convictions including for robbery with a firearm and possessing imitation firearms, had planned an attack on the HSBC bank in Blackpool after watching documentary Dirty Money: Cartel Bank, which reported alleged connections between the bank and the funding of terrorism and drug cartels.\nMurphy was “unlawfully at large” in November 2020, after absconding from prison, and was living in a camper van next to a soup kitchen in Blackpool. When police came to see the defendant on November 26 that year for a safeguarding check, because he hoped to move into other accommodation, he gave a false name, but after fingerprints revealed his identity he was asked whether he had a gun, the court heard.\nA search revealed the explosive what was described as a nail bomb in court, as well as a BB gun which had been painted black, a homemade shotgun and a kitchen knife. The court heard Murphy, who appeared by video link from HMP Preston, had pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing an imitation firearm in a public place, possession of a knife in a public place and having in his possession an explosive substance with intent to cause serious injury to property.\nAt a trial at Preston Crown Court earlier this year, he was acquitted of possessing the explosive with intent to endanger life. The court heard Murphy had submitted a basis of plea in which he said he had been “outraged” at “nefarious activity” by HSBC after watching the documentary and intended to demonstrate his grievances by damaging the Blackpool branch or the cars of employees in the car park, but did not want to hurt anyone.\nThe court heard he intended his actions to “come to the attention of the media and be widely reported, causing widespread fear, damage to the reputation of HSBC bank and lead to a change in the policy of the bank”.\nRory Allington-Mott\nA racist thug smirked and shook his head as a judge scorned him for the “repulsive” views that saw him target a mosque with bricks during a riot. Liverpool Crown Court was told today, Friday, that Rory Allington-Mott played a “leading role” during the violent disorder on both Sussex Road and St Luke’s Road on July 30 this year.\nThe court heard the 34-year-old, of High Street in Newport, was part of a violent mob that targeted a mosque chanting “who the f*** is Allah” just an hour after a peaceful vigil was held in memory of three young girls killed in a mass stabbing at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party the previous day.\nA compilation of videos taken from both CCTV and body-worn camera footage showed Allington-Mott hurling “at least 20 bricks” towards police officers, police vehicles and the local mosque. He also picked up a wheelie bin and a recycling bin and again hurled them at a line of police officers, who did not have protective clothing on, as other missiles from the thousand-strong crowd rained down on them.\nThe court heard Allington-Mott, who had travelled around two hours to Southport, also pushed over a wall at the mosque which “provided ammunition” to other rioters. Addressing the racist thug during his sentencing remarks, Judge Denis Watson KC said: “You shake your head, but that underlines your entrenched racist views which are repulsive to right-minded people in this country.”\nThe court heard Allington-Mott, who had travelled around two hours to Southport, also pushed over a wall at the mosque which “provided ammunition” to other rioters.

As Allington-Mott was led down to the cells, he winked towards the press bench.",
