  "body_text": "It has been revealed that Nathan Cleary didn’t get a warm reception from all of his girlfriend Mary Fowler’s Matildas teammates, with the NRL superstar banned from coming onto their pitch in Perth.\nThe Penrith Panthers star’s romance with the 20-year-old soccer superstar came to light when he enjoyed a string of dates with Fowler in Perth as he cheered on her team’s successful Olympic qualifying games.\nBut now Fowler’s teammates are crying foul for breaking their own hearts.\nWorld Cup goalkeeping hero Mackenzie Arnold is from the Gold Coast and joked she is holding a grudge against Cleary after his team, the Penrith Panthers, left Brisbane Broncos fans shattered with a comeback to win this year’s Grand Final.\nBroncos fan Arnold revealed how she spotted 26-year-old Cleary in the stands in Perth and explained: “I think it was definitely seeing Nathan Cleary in the crowd that was crazy for us.”\n“I was still salty from the Grand Final. I wasn’t happy about it and let Mary know he couldn’t come on the field.”\nFowler and Cleary are yet to speak publicly about their romance but were seen sharing an emotional goodbye at Perth Airport as they flew in separate directions.\nCleary shared an Instagram photo dump of his off-season since winning the Grand Final and while he didn’t include a picture of Mary, he posted a romantic sunset picture from Scarborough Beach at the top of Sunset Hill.\nMeanwhile, Arnold admits the ladies are on a winning streak when it comes to their love lives.\nAfter WA superstar Sam Kerr showed off her engagement pics with US player Kristie Mewis, Arnold shared how she is mixing business with pleasure with her own West Ham teammate back in Scotland.\nThe 29-year-old goalkeeper spilled on how she fell for Scotland player Kirsty Smith.\nArnold told 2DAY FM’s Hughesy, Ed & Erin on their breakfast show: “She started at West Ham this year so we met only last June pre-season.”\nShe added: “It hasn’t been very long but she came over from Manchester United and she plays for Scotland as well.”\nWhile Australia is infatuated with our soccer heroes, Arnold says playing in London is a welcome break from the fame as they are little known in the UK.\nShe added: “Over in London, you are back in your own bubble.”",
