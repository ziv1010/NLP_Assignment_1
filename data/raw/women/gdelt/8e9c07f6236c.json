But would Hayes consider the job if the opportunity arose?\nShe told FourFourTwo: “I’ll never say never to managing my country, but I’m really happy with what I’m doing now and I’ll be in the USA for a minimum of four years.\n“As long as they’re not competing against the USA, I’ll always be cheering on the Lionesses. I’m always going to be English and want them to do well. But we all know they’ve got an amazing manager in Sarina.”\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nHayes added she told the Football Association she wasn't interested in pursuing the England job when it was available.\nShe has been impressive as USWNT boss, bringing them golden success after they crashed out of the World Cup in the last 16 under former manager Vlatko Andonovski in 2023.\nHayes, who in FourFourTwo's view will lead the US to more World Cup glory, added: \"International football is for more experienced coaches,” she says. “My vast experience in the club game has prepared me for this. You only get to coach for a small percentage of time, but a lot of it is building strategy. I am enjoying it more than I’d anticipated.\n“I very much enjoy all of the other elements off the pitch, building the infrastructure. There was definitely many a year when this would never have interested me, as I loved being on the grass every day. But this is the right time in my life now to be doing this job.”\nSarah joined the FourFourTwo team in September 2024 in a freelance role.
