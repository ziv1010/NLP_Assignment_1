Mina Tanaka subbed on in the second half to strengthen the attack in her first action since March, but wasn't able to find the back of the net in her return from injury.\nAlly Sentnor, who is one of four players with one goal this season for Utah, mentioned a missed opportunity she had in the first half and the process of improving the quality of passes and shots being taken by her and her teammates.\n\"I am just trying to get as many quality chances on goal myself or setting up teammates as possible, because those will ultimately lead to goals,\" Sentnor said. \"Really just trying to get us into goal zone opportunity chances, instead of just half chances here and there.\"\nOn the defensive end, goalkeeper Mandy McGlynn put up five saves in the loss and also forced a missed penalty late in the game.\nUtah heads on the road next for a tough pair of matches at Angel City and the Washington Spirit before returning to America First Field on May 23 against the Orlando Pride.",
