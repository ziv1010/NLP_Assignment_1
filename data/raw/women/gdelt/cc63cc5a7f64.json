  "body_text": "Ben Shelton Is the Tennis World’s Fiery, Fashionable New Star\nAs the saying goes: “Like father, like son.” Or, in the case of the tennis world’s new shooting star, Ben Shelton, it’s more “like father, like mother, like sister, like son.” Before stepping onto the courts professionally, the Atlanta-born, Florida-raised athlete got a crash course in the sport at the dinner table. His mother, Lisa, is the sister of the former World No. 4 doubles player Todd Witsken, and his sister, Emma, is a senior on the University of Florida women's tennis team. But it’s his dad, Bryan, a former pro who won the Newport title in 1991 and 1992, who might be the most famous of all in his familial orbit (and not just because of the viral moment when Ben stopped a post-game press conference to take an untimely call from his dad). Ben’s been coached through the intricacies of the sport since he was ten, and Bryan has been an anchor for the young star as he’s navigated tournaments around the world. To put all that into pop culture terms, Bryan is to Ben as Richard Williams was to Venus and Serena (go watch King Richard), with the added skill of Challengers’ Tashi Duncan.\nEven with a family full of tennis players, Ben nearly swerved onto a different path. Like any good origin story tinged with teenage rebellion, the towering 6’4” prodigy was more likely to be found on the football field and basketball court. But you can only fight against fate for so long, especially when you enroll at the University of Florida, where your father happens to be the tennis coach. During his short but strong Gators tennis team career, he clinched a 2021 NCAA men's team title and a 2022 NCAA singles title, cementing him as one to watch when he inevitably left his university in August 2022 to go pro.\nAs anyone with eyes and even the most fleeting interest in tennis could tell you, that fateful decision two years and one month ago has worked out pretty well. The 21-year-old has had an ascent as fiery as his famed 150-mile-per-hour serves. Shelton took to the professional courts with a powerful left-handed forehand and two-handed backhand, breaking into the top 100 players in 2022 without ever leaving the United States. By 2023, Shelton’s international reputation was confirmed: He reached the quarterfinals in the 2023 Australia Open, fought his way to the semifinals in the US Open, won his first ATP Tour title at the Japan Open in Tokyo, and locked in an endorsement with On, the apparel brand blazing its own fiery path within the sportswear industry.\nLike his fateful embrace of tennis, it feels like kismet watching Shelton’s star power cemented on and off the court this year. Of course, any hot, young tennis player will have an entirely fresh set of eyes watching them in this fateful year of Challengers Mania: The culture has been engulfed in tennis fever. Searches for “adult tennis lessons” increased by 245% after the film was released; the US Open shattered attendance records with over 1 million attendees packing into the stands this month to watch sweating athletes in short shorts smack balls back and forth across the net. While he’s admitted he didn’t understand the plot of the film, the “Challengers effect” has caught Shelton in its sights; a new wave of fans have caught on to his towering height, scruffy hair, and boyish grin these past few months, inspiring fancam videos and at least one fantasy tweet.\nYou won’t see Shelton caught up in the fanfare. Despite clearing over 769,000 followers on Instagram, his focus has stayed on the courts. Specifically, the hard courts inside Berlin’s Uber Arena for the Laver Cup. After a noble showing at the US Open, the star has been in the German capital this week for the fierce competition that pits six of Europe’s best men's tennis players against six men’s players from around the world. Between matches, practice sessions, and photo ops at the Brandenburg Gate, we caught up with Shelton — decked out in head-to-toe On gear, naturally — for a quick chat about music, movies, and trusting the process.\nBefore you hit the court, what’s your go-to song or soundtrack to get in the zone? Are there any musicians you have on repeat?\nAnything Central Cee at the moment. British rap has been my beat since I’ve been out on tour. It really allows me to lock in for my matches.\nTennis has a long legacy of being immortalized in film. Who would be your pick to play Ben Shelton in a future film about your career?\nIt’s hard to choose just one actor. I would love to have Kevin Hart’s wit and humor, Tom Cruise’s likability factor and Leo Di Caprio’s ability to take on serious roles.\nDo you enjoy playing around with your style? What guidelines do you have for picking what you wear on and off the court?\nYeah, I’m starting to have some fun with it. Tennis has a lot of tradition when it comes to fashion, but I like pushing those boundaries — especially off the court. On apparel has been a big part of that for me. Their tennis gear is not only high-performance, but also has a clean, modern style that fits my vibe perfectly. I’m all about keeping things sharp but not being afraid to try something bold when it feels right.\nYou only left the US for the first time last year. Outside of tennis, what was your favorite moment while traveling abroad?\nHonestly, seeing the world outside of the US was an eye-opener for me. I’d say my favorite moment was getting to explore Italy. The food, the culture, it’s all so rich. And just slowing down and taking in the scenery between matches was amazing.\nYou have one of the fastest serves in tennis, sometimes clocking 150 mph. Do you have a specific pre-serve routine or visualization that helps you hit those speeds?\nI definitely have a routine. I focus on my breathing first, which helps me stay loose and calm under pressure. It’s all about staying relaxed and letting the power come naturally. If I overthink it, I don’t get the same pop, so I try to stay in the moment and trust the process.\nYou’ve been good friends with Coco Gauff for a while. How has that friendship developed as you both deal with being young tennis players and navigating celebrity status?\nCoco’s like a sister to me. We’ve both been through a lot of the same challenges, balancing this crazy tennis life with being young and figuring things out. It’s been cool to see her success, and we keep each other grounded. We know what it’s like to be in each other’s shoes, so it’s great to have that kind of support.\nYou’ve said your favorite film is Top Gun: Maverick. What would your call sign be if you were a fighter pilot, and why?\nGood question! I’d go with “Blaze.” I like to play fast, go for big shots, and just bring the fire to the court. It fits!\nWho’s the most competitive person in your family, and what’s the craziest family competition you’ve had?\nMy dad is the most competitive. Having played professionally, he brings that same intensity to everything we do. As for the craziest competition, it’s hard to pin down one specific moment. The competitive energy is always there whenever we’re on the court or just playing casually.\nWhat was the biggest lesson you’ve learned about tennis from growing up in such a unique household?\nThe biggest lesson was the importance of discipline and consistency. I saw firsthand how much work it takes to compete at a high level, but also how to stay focused and enjoy the process. Tennis isn’t just about hitting the ball hard; it’s about being smart and staying mentally tough. That’s something I carry with me every day.\nYou’re the first active male tennis player to land an On sponsorship. How have the shoes and clothes helped you level up your game? Why is finding the perfect fit a key part of preparing for a match?\nLanding the On sponsorship has been huge for me. The shoes and clothes are all about performance, and they’re designed with a level of precision that really makes a difference on the court. Comfort is key, too. If your gear doesn’t fit right or you’re uncomfortable, staying focused for hours at a high intensity is hard. Having the perfect fit isn’t just about comfort, though. It’s about confidence. When you know your gear won’t let you down, you can focus on your game plan, execute your shots, and stay locked in. It’s all part of how I prepare mentally and physically for every match.",
