  "body_text": "Villarreal have reportedly entered the race to sign Arsenal outcast Cedric Soares who is expected to leave the Emirates in January.\nMany thought Cedric would be sold last summer, having fallen far down the pecking order in Mikel Arteta’s side and even spending the last half of the 2022/23 season on loan at Fulham.\nHowever there was little interest in the right-back and so he stayed, but despite a number of defensive injuries, the Portuguese Internatonal has scarcely featured this campaign.\nHe has made just two appearances for the Gunners: A three-minute cameo in the Carabao Cup win at Brentford and 62 minutes from the start of Tuesday night’s Champions League dead rubber against PSV.\nAnd even with Takehiro Tomiyasu and Jurrien Timber injured, Cedric is unlikely to feature much more and Arsenal will be looking to save some money and offload him next month before his contract expires at the end of the season.\nAnd it would seem that interest in the 32-year-old has now emerged, with ESPN reporting that Villarreal have been tracking the defender since the summer and are expected to open talks over a possible move.\nIt is also said that several clubs in Turkey are interested in his services.\nGet your football fix\nDon't want to miss the week's biggest football stories?
