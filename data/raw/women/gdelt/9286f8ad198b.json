His wish for that to show in action was not granted.\nThe Scots were slack and slapdash and, while they dominated possession, it was the Serbs who probed the most.\nPerhaps that was due to the presence of Damnjanovic. The 29-year-old plays at the highest level in Germany and was by far the best player at Stadium Dubocica.\nIn stark comparison, Scotland started with Davidson through the middle - a player who arguably plays her best club football out on the wing.\nIt's small margins at the elite level and a star striker really could be all the difference.\nHowever, it was not just a striking issue for Scotland. There was a lack of zip in midfield.\nBayern's Sam Kerr was the opposite to her club team-mate and was extremely quiet, while Cuthbert - who is so often turned to for a moment of stardom - could not muster up any tricks.\nOn paper, this was the hardest game of the group out of the way. However, Scotland are still the top seeds in this group and the longer this winless run in competitive fixtures continues, the louder the criticism will be.\nWhat they said\nScotland head coach Pedro Martinez Losa: \"I think it was a game of two different phases. We had good moments on the ball, opportunities in the final third and I think, the second half, the opponent had a good level in the final third and we had moments where we made sure we didn't lose the game and we also had moments where we could have won the game but we didn't take advantage.\n\"This result can be good if we can get the three points on Tuesday, or if we beat Serbia at home. I think this is about the campaign. We picked up a point away from home against the most difficult opponent. Everything else is irrelevant.\"\nScotland defender Sophie Howard: \"I think we are disappointed not to get more, but in the end, it was a deserved point for both teams.\n\"I think we could have given the game away at the end, but we showed great character to hold on, put bodies on the line and just disappointed not to get more.\"\nWhat's next?\nScotland take on Slovakia at Hampden on Tuesday, 9 April with a 19:35 BST kick-off, while Serbia take on Israel at 15:00 on the same day.",
