  "body_text": "The Amazing Race reveals season 35 cast\nThe Amazing Race is back — and CBS has revealed the cast of its upcoming 35th season. The next race begins on Sept. 27, with 13 teams that will run to the ends of the Earth for a chance to win $1 million.\nFor the first time on the show, racers will head to Slovenia in addition to Sweden, India, Ireland, Thailand, Germany, and Washington State. But the globetrotting won't begin until competitors attempt to cross a tightrope from the rooftop of the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles.\nThe 35th season will look a little different than recent iterations of the series as it returns to commercial travel and brings back elimination legs, the Express Pass, and a twist on the U-Turn. Another major change? Every episode of the season will be 90 minutes long — a length that creators and executive producers Bertram van Munster and Elise Doganieri say will \"allow us to show more of each city we travel to, especially the people and the culture, plus we get to know our contestants on a deeper level and their relationships with each other.\"\nSonja Flemming/CBS The cast of 'The Amazing Race' season 35\nMeet the racing teams below.\nJocelyn Chao and Victor Limary\nJocelyn Chao and Victor Limary, both 49, are a married couple who work as grocery store managers in Albuquerque, N.M.
