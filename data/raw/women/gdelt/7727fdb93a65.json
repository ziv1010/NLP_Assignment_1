She was part of the Black Queens team that beat host nation Cote d'Ivoire 1-0 to win the maiden edition of the WAFU Zone B Women's tournament in Abidjan.\nThe 31-year-old goalkeeper also played for the Black Maidens team that qualified Ghana for its first-ever FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup in New Zealand after a 2-1 win over Cameroon in Yaounde.\nSpeaking on Asempa FM, Mantey explained how she got her injury.\n\"I sustained my ligament injury in October 2021 while playing a friendly game with my club at McDan Astro Turf. It was a corner kick, so I jumped into the air and caught the ball. When I landed, I realized my leg had twisted,\" she said.\n\"After my MRI test, the doctor told me that my ligament tissues had torn into pieces, and I needed to undergo surgery, which cost GHC 60,000.\n\"Although Immigration still pays me, I appeal to the GFA, Ministry of Youth and Sports, and the general public to support me with money to undergo ligament surgery.\"\nLatest Stories\n-\n‘I wanted to be an architect but ended up as a nurse’ – Diana Hamilton reveals\n34 minutes -\nFrom wards to worship: Diana Hamilton reveals how nursing school shaped her destiny\n51 minutes -\nMahama demands binding deadlines for African reparations\n1 hour -\nThis is not the time to settle political scores – Bawumia to government\n3 hours -\n5 definitive Valentine’s Day gifts to win your lover’s heart in Ghana\n3 hours -\n37% of SHS students exposed to drugs – Opare-Addo\n3 hours -\nNLC secures court injunction against striking tertiary unions\n4 hours -\nWaiting in the Ring: life inside Bukom’s halted boxing scene\n4 hours -\nRed Notice cancellation: OSP official fires back at Ofori-Atta’s lawyers\n4 hours -\nOfori-Atta saga: Red Notice ends after arrest – OSP official clarifies\n5 hours -\nAAG raises alarm over billboard demolitions, calls for presidential intervention\n5 hours -\nHealth Minister to chair probe into ‘No Bed Syndrome’ death; promises system overhaul\n6 hours -\nPrime Insight to tackle ‘galamsey tax’ debate, cocoa reforms and Ayawaso East fallout this Saturday\n6 hours -\nCocoa crisis, galamsey complicity and election credibility to dominate this Saturday’s Newsfile\n7 hours -\nINTERPOL deletes Red Notice for Ofori-Atta as extradition process continues — OSP confirms\n7 hours",
