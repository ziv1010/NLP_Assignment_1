  "body_text": "FARSLEY Celtic have released a lengthy statement on social media to try and ease the numerous current concerns among their fanbase.\nBut the club’s official supporters’ group are not satisfied, and continue to call for chairman/owner Paul Barthorpe to leave the club, saying they have shown “remarkable patience over several years” with him.\nFarsley are currently playing home games at Buxton in Derbyshire, with no fixed date for their return to Throstle Nest, now known as The Citadel, while key players and staff have departed of late, including popular physio Gareth Liversidge after 18 years.\nWhile one issue has been resolved, with Farsley’s current transfer embargo officially lifted as of yesterday, the Celts’ board approved a statement to go out on Monday night addressing several other matters of interest.\nIn summary, they said work would start on the pitch this week, after “unavoidable and unforeseen” problems and that the move to Buxton had to be made at 72 hours’ notice to the National League, after a previous agreement with Bradford (Park Avenue) fell through.\nThey also relayed the fact that the club is a privately owned legal entity, and as a result of that there is a confidentiality agreement between all directors and the club/company meaning detailed internal information such as finances etc cannot be shared publicly.\nFarsley also claimed to have paid every venue they have played at on time and that the land’s covenant states that it is for sports and commercial use only, so there is no intention of selling it off for things like housing.\nThey state that the internal structure of the club, which has been in place for two years, means that the deaf, the women’s and the development sections are predominantly self-funded and self-managed, but that the club will look to support them with any finance or resource requests.\nFarsley also confirmed they operate with a level of debt, saying most businesses do, but say that because their gearing is low it gives them a level of financial stability.\nThey also added that they have a positive relationship with their current key suppliers and will continue to develop those relationships further in the future.\nThe Celts insist a group was set up between the chairman and members of the supporters’ club, but that the chat had not been utilised for some time.\nUnsurprisingly, the Farsley Celtic Football Club Supporters’ Club are not satisfied by the statement, with many fans messaging the T&A thanking us for our drone story on the ground yesterday.\nAn FCFCSC spokesperson issued the following response to Farsley’s Monday night social media statement yesterday, telling the T&A: “Farsley Celtic Supporters’ Club notes with frustration yet another defensive statement from the owner which again sees him reluctant to take any responsibility for the current chaos surrounding the club.\n“As owner, the buck stops with you, no-one else.\n“The relationship between the owner and supporters have been strained for several years and we have shown remarkable patience.\n“We cannot envisage relationships with supporters improving should the owner remain.\n“The supporters’ club notes the owner provides no explanation for the delays in the pitchworks at the Citadel.\n“It fails to explain why no work has been undertaken for six months, nor does it state specifically the nature of the problems at the ground.\n“We have been given no reason why the dates stated by the chairman for the recommencement of pitch work have all been pushed back and the basic reason for why work has not been undertaken has not been addressed.\n“We still have no set restart date, or date when football will again be played at The Citadel.\n“The chairman's statement also fails to mention or address why key staff have left the club.”\nThe spokesperson added: “We’d like to restate our admiration and respect for the incredible work of volunteers connected to both the women’s and deaf team in what we know are incredibly difficult circumstances.\n“Ultimately we repeat our call of no confidence and renew our call for the chairman to sell the club.”",
