  "body_text": "Harry Redknapp's wife Sandra suffered 'freak accident' leaving husband devastated\nHarry Redknapp was left feeling \"beside himself\" after a \"freak accident\" caused his wife an horrific injury.\nHarry Redknapp was \"distraught\" after he inadvertently injured his wife Sandra. The former Premier League boss, 78, has enjoyed the unwavering support of his spouse since they fell in love as teenagers at 17. Sandra has stood by him through it all. Harry claims the pair have \"never had a row\" in over 50 years of matrimony, which is quite an extraordinary feat. She didn't even hold a grudge when he accidentally ran over her foot in 2016, in what he termed a \"freak accident\".\nAt the time, eyewitnesses recounted how she cried out in pain as she was dragged along by Harry's vehicle during the incident in Bournemouth. Her coat had become trapped in the door while her foot remained in the footwell of the four-by-four. One onlooker told The Sun at the time: \"There was a lot of blood on the tarmac and Harry was beside himself,\" reports the Mirror.\nAn ambulance swiftly transported Sandra to hospital where a concerned Harry remained by her side until she underwent surgery. In 2019, Harry confessed: \"We have honestly never had a row and she didn't blame me for turning her ankle into what looked like a slice of bacon. It was entirely my fault as I wasn't paying attention.\n\"She had to have skin grafts after half of her ankle was left in the road but you couldn't have a row with my missus if you tried. She's so placid. I don't know what I'd do without her. She's my electrician, my chef, my handyman, my chippie and a good Samaritan to everyone.\"\nThe beloved former Spurs and West Ham manager was terrified his wife might lose her foot. Harry described the injury as looking like \"looked like a shark had taken a bite\" when speaking to BBC News.\n\"It was just a freak accident you know,\" he explained.\n\"Sandra went across the road and, unfortunately, she had gone behind the car to cross over the road and as I went to drive off I caught her. I drove over her ankle basically, if the full weight of the car had gone over the ankle god knows what would have happened to her ankle and her foot.\"\nHe continued: \"We've never had a row. Ever. After all these years, we've never had a minute's problem between us. And that's true. That's not bulls***. If I get the hump, she'll just say, 'Look at you Harry, look at you, just calm down' and I do.\"\nEndearingly, Sandra is the only person Harry has ever penned a card for - and now she takes care of all his correspondence. Despite being part of a footballing dynasty, Harry has always maintained that Sandra and her late sister Pat, who was married to Frank Lampard senior, were never WAGs.\n\"Sandra listens to all the games on the radio or on TV but she doesn't often come to football,\" Harry clarified. \"WAGs didn't exist back then. Besides, they both worked at a hairdresser in Barking on Saturdays anyway... I've just been so lucky. Jamie always says I won the lottery marrying [Sandra], and he's dead right, I did.\"\nDespite having had his choice of celebrity friends over the years, the only person Harry has ever wanted or needed is his wife. \"I'm not really bothered about friends. I've got my family. But most of all, I've got Sandra and that's all that matters,\" he expressed.",
