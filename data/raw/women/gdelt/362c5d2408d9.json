Happy Labor Day!!\nDid you know the first Labor Day celebration took place in New York over 140 years ago? Each year since the nation has paused to recognize the contributions America's working men and women have made to this nation's strength, prosperity and well-being.\nLabor Day was created by the labor movement in the late 19th century and became a federal holiday in 1894. Labor Day weekend also symbolizes the unofficial end of the summer vacation season.\nSadly, many of these men and women, and often children, have labored long hours, many in dangerous jobs, with below standard wages and benefits. As manufacturing increasingly supplanted agriculture as the bulk of the American economy, labor unions, which had first appeared in the late 18th century, grew more prominent and vocal. They began organizing strikes and rallies to protest poor conditions and compel employers to renegotiate hours and pay.\nEmployers fought back and the battle for fair labor treatment turned violent. A strike by workers of the Pullman Palace Railway Car Company crippled railroad traffic nationwide. To break the Pullman strike, the federal government dispatched troops to Chicago, unleashing a wave of riots that resulted in the deaths of more than a dozen workers.\nIn an attempt to show support for workers, congress passed an act making Labor Day a legal holiday in the District of Columbia and the territories. On June 28, 1894, President Grover Cleveland signed it into law. To this day, the true founder of Labor Day has yet to be positively identified.\nDuring good times and bad times, America's working men and women have worked hard to support their families and to keep this nation string. One major case-in-point is the fact that the USA would never have become the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" during World War II had it not been for the long hours spent by American labor making ammunition and building the guns, planes, tanks and ships the U.S. and its allies needed to win the war.\nThe American working men and women have been and are truly at the center of America's history. Today, we officially say thank you!\n-----\nLabor Day weather should be pretty good for most of you with cookout, golf, swimming pool and other outdoors plans. The heat and humidity will still be around but most of the rain chances will be south of Demopolis today.\nRain potential goes up as the week goes along and as the week moves toward weekend daytime highs will moderate into the 80s with lows near the upper 50s over the coming weekend.\nAs for the tropics, we are eight days away from the peak of the 2024 Hurricane Season and the National Hurricane Center is keeping an eye on several disturbances.\nThe weak area of low pressure just offshore of the middle Texas coast is expected to bring some heavy rain the Gulf Coast later this week. It is still too early to determine the potential strength and track of the other two tropical systems brewing.\nThe Forecast:\nTopping the News:\nAccording to a complaint filed in Walker County District Court, Walker County authorities have charged Amanda Dawn Chappell with multiple counts of animal cruelty. Investigators say the found 26 cats in a camper in front of Chappell's house and another dozen inside her home.\nAlso in Walker County, three people were arrested and charged with drug trafficking. 39-year-old Loralyn Noelle Trotter, 34-year-old Kasey Joe Mote, and 46-year-old Noah Ferguson were arrested on Pleasant Grove Road, in Oakman.\nSaturday a week ago Mountain Brook's Lulu Gribbin returned home to a welcoming parade. She had been in a North Carolina hospital treated from losing a hand and leg as a result of a shark attack off the Florida panhandle coast in June.\nThe Alabama Republican party will conduct its annual \"Summer inner\" a week from Friday with Republican National Committee C-Chair Laura Trump as a guest speaker.\nThe Southern Pine Bark Beetle continues to inundate Alabama to epidemic levels. The latest map from the Alabama Forestry Commission reveals all of West Alabama is covered except for central and northeastern sections of Tuscaloosa County.\nTopping Sports News:\nNine of the AP Poll's Top 10 teams won Saturday, and we will find out tonight about #10 Florida State tonight when they host Boston College in a 6:30 game in Tallahassee.\nIf you are a subscriber to Direct TV or UVERSE you will be out of luck if you want to see tonight's vs FSU game or the Bama game on Saturday night. Disney (owner of ESPN, the SEC Channel and ABC) and the two tv providers owned by AT&T are locked in a contract dispute and the channels have been blocked until a settlement can be reached.\nFor the third year in a row LSU has lost a prestigious season opener. Last night it was a very beatable Southern Cal team that came back late to knock off the Tigers in a back-and-forth 27-20 game in Las Vegas. USC senior running back Woody Marks exploded through a hole for a 13-yard touchdown run with eight seconds remaining to break a tie.",
