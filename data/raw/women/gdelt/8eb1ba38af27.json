  "body_text": "Good Tuesday morning. This is Rosa Prince with Dan Bloom at TUC Congress in Liverpool. Eleni Courea will be with you Wednesday.\nDRIVING THE DAY\nGETTING A GRIP: Prime Minister Rishi Sunak meets his Cabinet at the usual time of 9.30 a.m, and after a week in which his agenda was knocked off course by crumbling schools, an escaped prisoner and a suspected Chinese spy in parliament, his officials might be wise to hold off on drawing up the agenda until the last possible minute.\nPAY DAY: Here’s something ministers are likely to discuss. In the last few minutes, the latest earnings figures from the ONS will have dropped here. They’ll be greeted with even greater interest than usual, given the implications for the pensions triple lock, which ties the chancellor to an increase linked to the higher of wages, inflation and 2.5 percent, and which, whisper it, ministers are said to have in their sights.\nWhat’s at stake: The figures are expected to show that wages in September rose by around 8 percent, meaning a substantial boost to pensioner incomes is on the way. As the IFS think tank pointed out last week, maintaining the lock has the potential to add billions to the cost of providing the state pension, because OAPs are guaranteed a generous annual uplift regardless of what else is happening in the economy.\n**A message from Intuit: It's essential to monitor small business statistics closely, as small businesses are early indicators of aggregate economic activity. Learn more in the Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index, a powerful monthly indicator for the health of the small business economy in the UK, providing up-to-date employment and hiring insights.**\nUnlocking the lock: So could it be time to scrap the triple lock? As William Hague points out in his Times column, prizing benefits from pensioners is politically dangerous, but economically may make sense, as the population ages and inflation and therefore wage increases remain high. It’s notable that Sunak refused to commit to the triple lock during his G20 weekend jaunt, although his official spokesperson on Monday said it remained government policy.\nREAD MY LIPS: Meanwhile, after a weekend of briefing that ministers could pay for tax cuts in the run up to the election with a reduction in the benefits bill — further fueling speculation about the triple lock — Jeremy Hunt insisted in an interview with Bloomberg that he had no plans to slash taxes in his Autumn Statement.\nMore Hunt: The chancellor, who is in New Delhi for a gathering of G20 finance ministers, also told the Independent the government was unlikely to offer concessions on visas in order to secure a trade deal with India, saying it was “difficult to imagine how much more we could give on that front.”\nTECH TALK: In other Cabinet minister news, Tech Secretary Michelle Donelan is taking over No. 10 for a roundtable to discuss online abuse and the Online Safety Bill, with celebs and sports stars among those invited to Downing Street. The gathering comes as the loooooong awaited bill returns to the Commons. Donelan has the morning round to discuss her plans — timings below.\nStar power: Among the famous faces who’ll be making their way through the Number 10 black door are footballer Fara Williams and reality stars Georgia Kousoulou and Georgia Harrison, who are all advocates for a safer internet. Donelan will tell them the new legislation will make the U.K. the safest place in the world to be online. In words briefed overnight she said: “It’s time to pass our online safety law and crack down on the sick and cowardly trolls who prowl out of sight online.”\nMore from the Cabinet: Justice Secretary Alex Chalk faces justice questions and will no doubt be braced for a grilling over the escaped prisoner Daniel Khalife, who was on Monday charged with breaking out of prison. And Education Secretary Gillian Keegan escapes from the furor over RAAC with an address to the Sutton Trust to launch the OECD’s Education at a Glance report at 11 a.m.\nCAN ANYTHING SHIFT THESE NUMBERS? Or is all this activity by Sunak and his Cabinet an exercise in futility? A YouGov poll for the WPI consultancy today finds that 54 percent of voters would “definitely” not support the Conservatives at the next election, while 32 percent said the same of Labour. Here’s more in the Times. And More in Common’s Luke Tryl has a poll showing three-quarters of voters say the U.K. needs a new government.\nWHAT EVERYONE’S ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT\nAYE SPY: But enough of the Cabinet. All anyone’s actually talking about is the arrest of a parliamentary researcher on suspicion of spying for China. The best spy drama since le Carré dominates the conversation around Westminster’s bars and cafes, and makes a pretty big show in the papers too.\nRead all about it: My POLITICO colleagues have you covered, with all the latest from parliament and beyond. Here’s Bethany Dawson and Emilio Casalicchio on Rishi Sunak’s statement, Emilio and Vincent Manancourt on what happens now for Sunak’s prized November AI summit, and Esther Webber and Stuart Lau on what it all means.\nTO NAME OR NOT TO NAME: That was the question editorial conferences across London were grappling with on Monday. So far none of the other major newspapers or broadcasters have followed the Times over the edge in naming the researcher suspected of being a spy. The consensus seems to be the risk is less of defamation and more the “Cliff Richard” factor, after the Beeb got itself in hot water over its 2014 aerial filming of a police raid on the crooner’s home; he was never arrested or charged with any crime.\nNot naming the suspect: MPs, after Speaker Lindsay Hoyle warned them that to name names, even using parliamentary privilege, could jeopardize an investigation. The Guardian has a good run down of the exchanges in the Commons, while the Telegraph leads on tensions between China hawks and ministers, including Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch who insist, on the importance of maintaining relations with Beijing.\nINNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN: The researcher issued a statement through his lawyer emphatically rejecting the suggestion he spied for China.\nGood question: Guardian sketchwriter John Crace wonders why, if China really wanted to know what the likes of Alicia Kearns and Tom Tugenhadt thought about them, they didn’t just tune into LBC/Times Radio/Sky News/Radio 4 like everyone else.\nTHE PLOT THICKENS: The Telegraph’s Robert Mendick and Hayley Dixon have an interesting piece questioning the timing of the story breaking in the Sunday Times, six months after the researcher was arrested but as Rishi Sunak was attending a major international summit, and speculating whether it could have been designed to nudge the government towards a tougher stance on China.\nMore developments: Among the new lines emerging Monday night: the Independent’s Kate Devlin says the alleged spy was cited in an official report by the Foreign Affairs Committee; former MI6 chief Richard Dearlove told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on her show Politics Hub that espionage was “just part of the game;” Iain Duncan Smith told Channel 4 News China should be disinvited from the forthcoming AI Summit; and writing on the GB News website, Tobias Ellwood calls for a rethink on the government’s attitude towards China.\nSOMETHING YOU WANT TO TELL US NADINE? Nadine Dorries has a startlingly believable step by step guide to how a young researcher could get turned in her latest Mail column.\nSPIES LIKE US: It’s not just the Chinese who are accused of a spot of snooping. At 9 a.m. the European Court rules on Wieder and Guarnieri v the United Kingdom, a case brought by American IT worker Joshua Wieder and Italian Claudio Guarnieri, a privacy and security researcher, who accuse the British government of intercepting their communications.\nLIVERBIRDS\nSTUDENT POLITICS: Labour leader Keir Starmer is still in Liverpool, having arrived Monday night for a dinner with union bosses at TUC Congress. He’s due to take part in a Q&A with sixth formers at an event moderated by the Liverpool Echo’s Maria Breslin and Liam Thorp. Labour spinners suggest he’ll be asked about “devolution in the region” and “the future of the U.K’s economy.” So not tuition fees. Definitely not.\nHARD DAY’S NIGHT: Starmer arrived at the dinner at the Liverpool Hilton after 9 p.m, having been delayed by China statements in the Commons, and got a standing ovation for a “comradely” speech containing “nothing new.” Playbook’s Dan Bloom in Liverpool reports he then cracked a joke about his team Arsenal’s clash with TUC General-Secretary Paul Nowak’s Everton this weekend. So droll.\nTODAY IN LIVERPOOL: Angela Rayner’s big TUC Congress speech is at 10.45 a.m. Labour’s deputy will tell 15 rows of desks in a windowless basement that leveling-up can mean “a house and a good, unionised job.” The most interesting bit — for union bigwigs — is her “New Deal” on workers’ rights. It launched two years ago, but its timescale was, er, clarified by Labour’s National Policy Forum. Left-wing union leaders are adamant it’s been “watered down.” Moderates argue they’re guarding against future dilution.\nWhat it is: Sky’s Sam Coates has a good analysis of what’s in the New Deal, and the Sunday Mirror had a trail of plans to strengthen laws against union blacklisting. A Starmer-friendly general-secretary told Dan it is “radical and credible” but added: “We will hold the leadership’s feet to the fire.”\nROBOT FUTURE: Members will probably today pass a motion saying unions should be consulted on new AI technology. How exactly that’d work isn’t decided. “The role of the trade unions shouldn’t be thinking of how to stop tech,” says one union leader. “It should be about being in the strongest position to deal with the change.”\nMEANWHILE IN STRIKES: National Education Union leader Daniel Kebede said his members will “close” any school that sacks staff over new minimum service laws, reports the Telegraph’s Amy Gibbons. GMB general-secretary Gary Smith adds to the Mirror’s Lizzy Buchan: “We could potentially see spontaneous action.” UNISON chief Christina McAnea is on a health workers’ picket line on the Wirral at 8.30 a.m.\nAnd in football: A motion today calls for female professional footballers to have the same conditions as men in their contracts.\nAnd the rest: Today will see a motion calling for tuition fees to be scrapped … An FDA motion on standards in public life naming Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab … and a motion supporting self-ID for trans people, a policy Labour no longer backs.\n**POLITICO’s Power Play podcast unveils the world of policy, politics, and power, with just a play button.

Forget Shagaluf, get yourself down to Calais if you want a real party.\nIn contrast: Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper will use a speech to the Police Superintendents Association Conference in Stratford-upon-Avon to call for a new medal for police officers killed in the line of duty. “When officers tragically lose their lives just because of the difficult job they do, there should be proper recognition in their memory and for their devastated families too,” she’ll say.\nNOT TODAY BUT: Kudos to Victoria Derbyshire for not even flinching when confronted with one of those Bully XL dogs on Newsnight Monday night during a discussion about whether the breed that may not be a breed should be banned (Playbook is very much a cat person).\nNOT IN WESTMINSTER BUT: Ministers have been accused of using the overseas aid project UK Aid Match for political advantage and “charity washing,” a report by the Aid Match APPG says — the i’s Chloe Chaplain has more.\nNO STONE UNTURNED: Reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) has been found in parliament during a routine inspection, with mitigations put in place — Bloomberg’s Alex Wickham has the exclusive.\nNANNY STATE PART I: Ministers are being urged by a group of London council leaders to ban smoking from outdoor hospitality seating areas on pavements outside pubs and restaurants to help people quit smoking — via the Mirror.\nNANNY STATE PART II: Disposable vapes will be banned to stop children becoming addicted under government proposals to be announced as early as next week — here’s the Telegraph‘s write-up\nDOCTOR WHO? The Guardian splashes on a poll showing one in three medical students plan to quit the NHS within two years of graduating … meanwhile the Times‘ front page features figures showing nearly a third of female NHS surgeons have been sexually assaulted by a colleague in the past five years, according to a British Journal of Surgery research paper.\nOn notice: Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting tells the FT he is giving NHS leaders “notice that Labour will act” following failings in the case of child serial killer Lucy Letby.\nELECTRIC DREAMS: The i’s Paul Waugh reckons the government’s response to its consultation on electric vehicles is delayed because the DfT is waiting for Downing Street to “sign off” the plans.\nTHE KIDS AREN’T ALRIGHT: Three-quarters (76 percent) of low income 18-to-24-year-olds in the U.K. are going without essentials, Open Data Institute analysis found.\nNEW POLITICAL ANIMAL: Singer Will Young calls on the government to end animal testing in a House magazine op-ed — Young leads a roundtable discussion at Labour conference on October 10.\nSW1 EVENTS: Chatham House holds a discussion on the Israel-Palestine conflict with speakers including former U.N. envoy Robert Serry from 2 p.m. … WPI Strategy holds a discussion about the center-ground with Keir Starmer’s former policy head Claire Ansley, Spectator Pol Ed Katy Balls and former Downing Street Chief of Staff Nick Timothy on Carlton House Terrace from 6 p.m. … and Shadow Education Minister Helen Hayes hosts a celebration of the forthcoming book Women Who Won: 70 extraordinary women who reshaped politics by Ros Ball in the Jubilee Room from 7.30 p.m.\nHOUSE OF COMMONS: Sits from 11.30 a.m. with justice questions followed by Labour MP Sam Tarry’s 10-minute rule bill on electricity supply … and then the main business is tributes to the clerk of the House, consideration of Lords amendments to the Online Safety Bill and a motion on Draft Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) Order 2023.
