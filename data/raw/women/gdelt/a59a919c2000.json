  "body_text": "In his green and blue chequered kilt, Professor Gordon Mackay was proclaimed the ‘Godfather’ by Brazil’s national-team surgeon Dr Moises Cohen.\nThe Scot had been invited out to Sao Paulo to explain his groundbreaking internal brace (IB) technique to leading South American surgeons who work in the football world, and he departed with something that outshone a nickname and even professional acclaim.\nAdvertisement\nHe was presented with a video from his footballing idol Pele, who had recorded a special message: “Gordon… not Gordon Banks! – we want to thank you for your mentorship… I would like to be your friend one day,” he said.\nThat one day memorably came in October 2019, when he was able to return the favour by gifting Pele a Clan Mackay sgian dubh – a black knife worn along with Highlander regalia.\nIt was a fitting gift, given it is Mackay’s expertise in helping athletes recover after a trip to the operating table that led to the original idea for the trip to Brazil, where Dr Cohen has adopted the IB for all his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) procedures.\nThe IB was first devised as a concept by Mackay in 2011 and, in conjunction with leading US-based sports-surgery company Arthrex – which has applied the technique to 17 different areas of the body and taken it to 30 different countries – the number of surgeries to have been performed using his patented method has passed one million.\nLast year alone, 50 per cent of soft-tissue knee surgeons started to introduce the IB for reconstruction, and there are now 214 academic papers on its role in recovery and accelerated healing.\nThe IB has been adopted by the US special forces, which has returned troops to free-fall parachute jumps just two-and-a-half weeks after ankle-ligament damage.\nIB surgery has also meant that the NFL’s leader in career completion percentage, Drew Brees, was back playing quarterback within five weeks in 2019 after tearing a ligament in the thumb on his passing hand; golfer Brooks Koepka competed at The Masters in 2021, four weeks after damaging ligaments and dislocating his kneecap; and, in 2013, British bobsleigh pilot John Jackson was the first person to have his Achilles tendon internally braced, going on to win an Olympic bronze medal the following year.\n“It is a big step forward and is transforming sports surgery around the world. I believe it is going to have a big impact on world football too. It takes time to change approaches and attitudes, but the evidence is building,” Mackay tells The Athletic.\nAdvertisement\nAn ACL (anterior cruciate ligament – the main ligament through the centre of the knee which keeps the joint stable) injury used to be viewed as the dreaded curse for footballers, as a return to the game was not always guaranteed.\nAdvancements in technology mean it is not the career death knell it once was, but there is still a 10 per cent re-injury rate and some players still don’t get back to the level they were at before.\nRecovery time was around a minimum of nine months to get back to playing, but former Aberdeen and Dundee United defender Mark Reynolds’ return was reduced to just four-and-a-half months courtesy of Mackay’s IB repair in 2018, while now-Rangers winger Scott Wright was fully recovered in the same timeframe after an ACL tear playing for Aberdeen the following year.\nMackay has 20 years of experience as a specialist in sports surgery, but there were various inspirations behind the idea for the IB technique. His father had been a footballer for Kilmarnock and his mother was a doctor, but when his own career as an aspiring player took him to Rangers in 1988, he witnessed the trauma that ligament injuries could cause.\n“Ian Durrant was undergoing his knee reconstruction when I was a reserve player,” he said. “He was on crutches for a long time and when I caught up with him years later he had undergone 17 procedures on his knee. If you go through that Rangers squad, you see the number of hip and knee replacements and realise there is a price to pay.\n“Folk realised their knee had gone, (but) they didn’t really understand what it was (that had happened to it). They would find that when they pivoted or twisted, it would swell up and they couldn’t play on, so they would rehab for three months.\n“The knee would settle and they’d be OK running in a straight line, but as soon as they got into football (movements) – landing and twisting – the knee would buckle again and the two bone surfaces (the thigh and the shin) would be smacking together with the cartilage in between torn. That would be the start of the arthritic process. There would be stories of people who went on and said they could play without a cruciate ligament, but an unstable joint predisposes to arthritis.\nAdvertisement\n“We’re doing it in a way that preserves joint health so people can still kick a ball about with their kids rather than having joint replacements. The only reason I play with Scotland Over-50s is by elimination. Everyone else better than me has now had a joint replacement or is arthritic.”\nWhile starting his medical career in Glasgow’s Erskine Hospital, Mackay became fascinated by the braces that ex-servicemen amputees would be given to wear. But his initial cynicism regarding the consensus on how to treat ligament injuries came from frustration at being stuck in a cast after injuring an ankle ligament, as the affected leg became wasted and stiff.\nThe basic repair four decades ago consisted of opening the knee up like a book, putting in a couple of stitches on the damaged ligament and then closing the incision before leaving the leg in a cast for three months.\nA study conducted by Dr John Fagan with military recruits showed that only around a third of them healed when treated in this fashion. When the two doctors met, Mackay was urged to revisit the topic and challenge 40 years of consensus – and that is how the idea came to life.\nBefore his first pioneering surgery – completed on his son’s best friend in 2011 – the done thing had been to reconstruct the ACL by taking part of the ligament from the hamstring to replace it.\nMackay’s method is a less traumatic alternative to traditional reconstruction: repairing the ligament as soon as possible and augmenting it with an internal brace.\n“Our aim was to not weaken the knee, if at all possible,” said Mackay.\n“People get very confused about ACL repair and ACL reconstruction.\n“A ligament repair tries to retain all the natural tissue, so the injured ligament can heal again. The IB idea is that it protects the ligament so it is fully healed. Whereas a reconstruction is taking a part of the ligament from the hamstring to replace the damaged ligament.\nAdvertisement\n“Some surgeons only do their reconstructions using hamstring tendons and some get good results, but inevitably there will be some residual weakness and, because you’re not moving for a few months, you lose conditioning and muscle bulk.\n“I thought, ‘Why can’t we protect things and mobilise them while we heal?’. We do it with external braces. Why don’t we do it internally by matching the natural ligament? Don’t replace it, let it heal and just protect it.\n“We’ve found that we can use a hybrid, which is a slightly reduced graft in size. We keep the stump of the damaged ligament so you’ve still got nerve supply and blood supply, and back it up with this internal brace.\n“It is only 2mm in diameter, like a ribbon, but it significantly improves the strength of the reconstruction. We’ve also found recently that, with the addition of a second internal brace on the outside of the knee, you can reduce the risk of re-injury by a further third.\n“Our outcomes would appear to be the best we’ve ever had. Our re-injury rate is in the process of being submitted for publication after following patients for five years with a reduced-size graft, backed up by an internal brace. The average is a 1.1 per cent re-injury rate in five years, so we’ve reduced it considerably.\n“The internal brace allows you to get out of a boot and get walking, driving, within 10 days. If you do internal brace, you can do the early-phase recovery while it’s remodelling and it acts as a seatbelt to protect it from being stretched. By six months, you’ve fully recovered and maintained better bone strength and movement due to the early movement.”\nThe subject of ACL damage in women’s football has become a hot topic in recent months, particularly when Arsenal duo Beth Mead and Vivianne Miedema both suffered the injury within a week of each other last month.\nAdvertisement\nMead expressed her discontent at what she perceived to be a lack of research into why female players are four-to-six times more likely to suffer an ACL injury than their male counterparts.\nGO DEEPER\nMiedema, Mead and Putellas: Why are there so many ACL injuries in the women's game?\n“Most surgeons feel a little bit nervous operating on female players as re-injury is highest among young girls and you’re looking to get the best result for your patients,” Mackay says.\n“Young females are often more elastic than males. There is more of a bungee effect in their tendons, so there is a higher chance of their tendons stretching out and failing. In Australia, they did a big study on hamstring reconstruction and found the re-injury rate is as high as 15 per cent, as revision reconstruction means a lot of people won’t get back to sport at the level they had enjoyed before.\n“There is a high rate of re-injury on the opposite knee, which could be argued that, if your recovery isn’t as complete, you become more dependent on your other side. But we’ve seen a low incidence of that with this IB technique, so we are encouraged that there seems to be a secondary benefit we weren’t anticipating.”\nMackay admits the numbers are concerning and backs the call for further research into the causes, but he believes his IB system can help improve the return rate.\n“ACL injuries aren’t just pot-luck. There is an element that is outwith your control, but you can minimise those risks and there has been some very good research suggesting how that can be done.\n“FIFA has tried to develop a programme of exercises to minimise the risks for young girls, to address potential weaknesses. They argue that it reduces the incidence by a third if they adhere to their protocols, which include functional exercises to improve the balance between the quads (the muscles in the front of the thigh) and the hamstrings.\nAdvertisement\n“They work on agility, so you have an awareness of where your knee is by doing foot drills. They do core work so the stability is coming from the glutes (the backside and hips) and hamstring down to the floor, and they also look at landing and turning. Some girls have a tendency to end up in a knock-kneed position, due to the female pelvis position.\n“The most common way to rupture your ACL is landing after a header when your leg is fully extended, or when you twist and your knee ‘sticks’, which causes your body to pivot around it and the knee collapses in the way. The incidence in young females is partly down to that alignment, so they practise landing drills – like jumping from a box, so your knees are directly in line with your hips. This ensures your knees don’t converge when you land.\n“Footwear is another important thing as female footballers tend to use male boots, which are often broader fitting and with bigger blades (for gripping the turf).”\nMackay believes football could rapidly gain knowledge on this issue and many others if greater importance is placed on tracking and reporting injuries and recovery.\nIt is why he has invested £400,000 ($486,000) in ScribePro, an app co-founded by the Scottish Football Association’s Dr John Gordon. The software records anonymous clinical interactions between athletes and medical teams, which can be instantly accessed by any clubs or associations using the service.\n“It collates data in real-time, and the pooled data shows trends which can advise on risk factors and how to accelerate recovery. All of this info comes from different sports and countries,” Mackay says.\n“It is designed to be a very accessible system, as going forward there is going to be a need for deeper medicals, given the information is often sparse so decisions can be unscientific, as there is no real digital record on a player.\nAdvertisement\n“But things like ACLs in females, concussion episodes, hamstring issues, these can disappear in the treatment room and are never recorded. ScribePro logs everything and helps to steer the gaze in a certain direction, so others can avoid injury or recover quicker.”\nNo matter the success of ScribePro, the internal brace remains the jewel in the crown of Mackay’s surgical career.\nIt may not have been his first ambition as an Ibrox trainee 35 years ago when he delayed going to study in London to give football one last shot, but he has impacted more careers than he ever could have playing up front.\n(Top photo courtesy of Professor Gordon Mackay)\nThe Athletic’s Spanish football coverage has expanded…\n- La Liga news, La Liga table; La Liga fixtures and results\n- Dermot Corrigan is joined by four new writers…\n- Real Madrid news from Mario Cortegana and Guillermo Rai\n- Barcelona news from Pol Ballús and Laia Cervelló Herrero",
