Goodell was asked about the trending belief nationwide that the Chiefs are a beneficiary of calls, and the idea was quickly shot down.\n“It sort of reminds me of the idea that I would write the script and I have the script for the entire season,” Goodell said. “I think a lot of those theories are things that happen in social media and they get a new life as you say it’s not your theory but it’s out there. I understand it reflects a lot of the fans’ passion and I think it also is an important reminder for us how important officiating is.\n“I think the men and women who officiate in the NFL are outstanding, they have the highest possible standards, it’s a ridiculous theory for anyone who might take it seriously.”\nREAD MORE: NFL’s Walt Anderson defends penalty calls made during Chiefs-Texans game\nWhile Goodell pushed back on the idea of the officials being favorable toward the Chiefs, some of the key individuals pushing the idea remain the very competitors going up against Kansas City. During an end-of-season press conference last week, Buffalo Bills head coach Sean McDermott admitted he told his team not to expect to get calls when playing the Chiefs.\n“We went into the game and one of my messages to the team, and this happens from time to time, is you’re going to have to -- you’re not going to get calls,” McDermott said. “We’re not going to get calls. And I think just when you prepare a team, you prepare them ahead of time, mentally, for this is the way it’s going down. And you live with that.”\nPart of McDermott’s issue with the officiating was a 4th and 1 stop by the Chiefs which was ruled short on the field and deemed to be a ‘call stands’ following a review. Goodell provided his thoughts on potential technological advances that might allow spotting the football to be done in a different fashion in the future.\n“It is complicated,” Goodell said. “Obviously, there’s a lot of humanity that interferes with some of that at least from a camera angle standpoint. You also have a shape of the ball that is different and it’s about where the individual is, so there’s a combination of factors that exist but I do think that technology will exist some time in the future.”\nBLOG: KCTV5 begins coverage from New Orleans for Super Bowl week\nMcDermott then claimed “that’s not the reason we lost,” but followed a similar tone to Houston Texans head coach Demeco Ryans following Houston’s AFC Divisional loss to the Chiefs.\n“We knew going into this game, man, it was us versus everybody,” Ryans said following Houston’s 23-14 loss on Jan. 18. “When I say everybody, I mean everybody.”\nThe Chiefs will take on the Eagles Sunday, Feb. 9 at 5:30 p.m. CT. With a win, Kansas City would become the first team in the Super Bowl era to win three consecutive titles.\nCopyright 2025 KCTV. All rights reserved.",
