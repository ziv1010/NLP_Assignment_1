  "body_text": "Manchester United have reportedly identified their preferred replacement for women’s team goalkeeper Mary Earps, who is set to leave the club imminently.\nEarps’ contract with United is poised to expire in a matter of days.\nThe Red Devils had been locked in negotiations with the England international over a new deal but an agreement was never reached. A few weeks ago, Earps insisted that she would only stay at Old Trafford if the club matched her ambitions.\nLast summer United turned down a world-record bid from Arsenal for Earps and it seems like they’re now set to lose her on a free.\nA recent report covered by The Peoples Person revealed that she is closing in on a blockbuster switch to French outfit Paris Saint-Germain.\nIt was stated that PSG made a lucrative offer to the 31-year-old but her decision to join the Parisians was ultimately not motivated by money. She wants to compete for top honours and play in the biggest competitions such as the Champions League.\nUnited will of course not be playing Champions League football because they finished a lowly fifth in the Women’s Super League, 20 points behind table leaders Chelsea.\nAccording to reliable Sky Germany reporter Florian Plettenberg, United are already planning for life without Earps and have identified a replacement for her.\nPlettenberg wrote on X (formerly Twitter), “Bayern’s Maria Luisa Grohs is a candidate for Manchester United Women.”\n“Grohs, open to leave FC Bayern to fulfill her personal target joining a top club in the FA Women’s Super League.”\n“Grohs could replace Mary Earps who is about to join Paris Saint-Germain!”\n🔴🧤Excl. | Bayern’s Maria Luisa Grohs is a candidate for @ManUtdWomen!\n➡️ Grohs, open to leave FC Bayern to fulfill her personal target joining a top club in the FA Women's Super League.\nGrohs could replace Mary Earps who is about to join Paris Saint-Germain! #MUFC… pic.twitter.com/O5c8zVZ6we\n— Florian Plettenberg (@Plettigoal) June 26, 2024\nGrohs kept 14 clean sheets in 21 Bundesliga appearances last term to help Bayern win the title.\nWant to be the first to hear breaking Man United news?
