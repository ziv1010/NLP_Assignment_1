  "body_text": "Good morning. If Rachel Reeves’s priority in yesterday’s spring statement was to insist nothing much had changed, at the same time as saying repeatedly that the world has changed, it was a success: she came out with the same £9.9bn fiscal headroom she gave herself in October, and the markets barely reacted.\nBut there was a lot of frantic activity beneath the surface to reach that position of stasis – and as the impact assessment on the government’s welfare cuts made terribly clear, for a lot of people the results will be profound. Meanwhile, as Donald Trump’s new 25% car tariff showed overnight, there are many reasons to think that the economic outlook is not settled.\nSo how did a budget that wasn’t a budget produce a rupture that changed nothing at all? And has it staved off the prospect of tax rises in October - or made any different to the prospects for a healthier economy? Today’s newsletter, with Mike Brewer, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, explains why the chancellor’s balancing act remains very precarious indeed. Here are the headlines.\nFive big stories\n-\nTariffs | Donald Trump has announced plans to impose sweeping 25% tariffs on cars from overseas, days before the US president is expected to announce wide-ranging levies on other goods from around the world. The announcement drew swift condemnation from the European Union, Canada, and Japan.\n-\nSouth Korea | Authorities in South Korea are battling wildfires that have doubled in size in a day in the country’s worst ever natural fire disaster. At least 26 people have died and hundreds of buildings destroyed in North Gyeongsang province, with the country’s disaster chief saying the fires had exposed the “harsh reality” of the climate crisis.\n-\nMartha’s rule | Thousands of patients or their loved ones have sought a second opinion about their NHS care as a result of hospitals adopting Martha’s rule, MPs have heard. More than 100 patients have been escalated to intensive care “or equivalent” under the pilot scheme for the patient safety procedure, named after Martha Mills, who died in 2021 aged 13.\n-\nSignal leak | The Atlantic magazine has published further messages from a group chat among top US officials in which they discuss specific operational details of plans to bomb Yemen. The release prompted leading Democrats to accuse Trump administration officials of lying to Congress by claiming the messages did not contain classified information.\n-\nEuropean Union | People in the EU are being advised to stockpile enough food, water and essentials for 72 hours to ensure readiness for natural disasters, pandemics and military attacks. Hadja Lahbib, the European commissioner for preparedness and crisis management, said that “ready for anything” must be “our new European way of life”.\nIn depth: ‘We’re still stagnation nation’\nYesterday began very badly for Rachel Reeves, and for those who rely on disability benefits, with news that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had studied the welfare cuts set out last week and concluded that they would not save as much as the government hoped. That meant another £1.6bn cuts on top of those that have already been trailed, with £500m from the same benefits. Last week’s announcement was described as a thoughtful move to a “more pro-active, pro-work system”; this week’s expansion is dressed as very little but a matter of fiscal necessity.\n“The problem with the emphasis placed on fiscal rules is that it puts so much weight on being just the right side of a slightly arbitrary line,” Mike Brewer said. “If she had more headroom in the first place, we would not be scrutinising every single raising of the eyebrow by the OBR in the way we are.”\nWhen the OBR’s forecast was published, it also showed that predicted growth this year had been downgraded from 2% to 1%, while forecasting slightly improved figures for later in this parliament. But, Brewer noted, “the 2020s as whole are still going to be terrible compared to the 2010s, let alone the 2000s. We’re still stagnation nation.”\nThe big picture, he said, is that “this was a lot more boring than we might have expected. Perhaps that shows the power of briefing and announcing policy in advance. When you look across the whole government, it amounted to a small trimming of the sails.”\nWhat new cuts did the chancellor announce?\nIn October, the OBR estimated Reeves’s budget left her with £9.9bn in fiscal headroom. That has been wiped out by high borrowing costs, primarily driven by Donald Trump’s economic policies, and lower than expected UK growth. Yesterday, the OBR said that without any changes, the UK would now be forecast to be £4.1bn in deficit in 2029/30.\nHere’s what Reeves said about how she would plug the gap:\nThe same welfare cuts announced last week by the work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, now valued at £3.4bn instead of £5bn, plus another £500m. The difference will be covered by freezing the incapacity element of universal credit until 2030, meaning a real terms cut in light of inflation. There will also be a cut to the basic rate of universal credit, which Kendall said would be raised.\nA 15% reduction in administrative costs across the civil service, targeting savings of about £2bn; and £1bn in expected additional tax revenues thanks to new anti-avoidance measures. “All governments do this, so I’m not going to blame this one in particular,” Brewer said. “But the government already came out with a very big clampdown on avoidance in October, so it’s a bit surprising that they’ve found so much more five months later.” But in this interesting piece, Dan Neidle of Tax Policy Associates welcomes the changes.\nOther measures will not be set out in detail until the three-year spending review in June – but the expectation of much larger cuts for “unprotected” departments has not really materialised. “She has made what amount to quite small changes, asking departments to spend £3bn or £4bn less by the end of the parliament,” Brewer said.\nAnother £3bn was expected to come through growth, thanks to the OBR’s forecast of an improved picture later in the parliament.\nTaken together, all of that is forecast to put Reeves back in the black, with the same £9.9bn headroom. “It does suggest the last-minute fine tuning to the welfare package was done so the Treasury could say they were back where they were at the last budget,” Brewer said. In her analysis piece, Heather Stewart writes that Reeves ended up “boxing and coxing to accommodate every last few million quid”.\nWere there any silver linings?\nReeves was determined to take a positive tone where she could, highlighting a “transformation fund” worth £3.25bn over three years to support projects that will enhance productivity. She was also able to celebrate the impact of planning reform on the OBR’s growth forecast.\nBut it was hard to find much to smile about in the new measures: the extra money for defence, for example, has largely been paid for by a cut to the international aid budget.\nReeves did say that she would allocate £2bn for new social and affordable homes. “But that is in no way new money,” Brewer said. “It’s just giving detail ahead of the spending review on part of the broad allocation set out in October. It’s actually less than the previous government was spending, which is why they’re very keen to emphasise that it’s a ‘downpayment’.”\nWhat did the impact assessment on welfare cuts say?\nLast week, the government said that it would not publish its findings on how severely the cuts would affect those who rely on universal credit and the personal independence payment (Pip) until yesterday. Many viewed that as a deliberate attempt to bury difficult headlines – and the stark picture that the document revealed certainly lends weight to that case.\n800,000 will lose Pip, 150,000 will lose the carers’ allowance, and 250,000 more will be in poverty, including 50,000 children. Across all the changes, about 3.2 million current or future claimant families will lose an average of £1,720. Many Labour MPs are now considering voting against the changes in May, with rumours of frontbench resignations.\nOne striking detail, Brewer said, was that the assessment “suggests that this is a cut on a really slow burn. By the end of the parliament, only 700,000 of the three million people on the health-related part of universal credit will be on the new lower rate. The case load changes very slowly – so newly disabled people in the future who are going without will mean that the impact will get bigger over time.”\nAre tax rises likely in the autumn?\nThe cost of borrowing has risen further since the OBR made its working assumptions last month – and its growth forecast rests on productivity assumptions which some economists think are unrealistic. That means that Reeves could very easily slide back into the red. Richard Hughes, of the OBR, said that the entirety of Reeves’ headroom would be wiped away by a 0.6 percentage point rise in the cost of borrowing, or 20% tariffs from the US.\nIf that happens, she may feel that there is no room for further cuts, and that the least politically awful option is to increase taxes.\n“Despite everything the chancellor said about how the world has changed, the OBR forecast doesn’t fully reflect that,” Brewer said. “And we can’t factor in the possible consequences of a global trade war, or European countries devoting more of their economies to defence. We don’t think that she’s really grappled with public spending pressures that might be coming, either – the most obvious of which is defence. There is a fully costed plan to get to 2.5%, but the prime minister has said that he wants to get to 3%.”\nDoes this amount to austerity?\nIt depends on how you look at it. Labour firmly denies it, and has some decent reasons for doing so: any analysis of the new cross-government cuts should reflect that because of the spending increases baked in last year, they are coming from a higher base.\n“There is no doubt that she is being more generous than Jeremy Hunt planned,” Brewer said. “It isn’t like the austerity of the early 2010s, where George Osborne made really big cuts across a large number of departments. But there will be departments that see their spending fall.”\nBut it is also true that the legacy of the austerity era means public services are creaking, and that further cuts are therefore bound to show up in people’s lives more painfully than they might do against a brighter backdrop.\n“Technically none of this constitutes a return to austerity,” Gaby Hinsliff writes in this piece. “[But] good luck explaining that to people who use the phrase more as shorthand for the sinking feeling that no matter what was promised, nobody is coming to the rescue.”\nWhat else we’ve been reading\n-\nDig out your grandmother’s fur coat, because fashion has a new imperative: “boom boom”. Morwenna Ferrier has an excellent piece explaining the arrival of a decadent look in a straitened time: “There is an end of empire, end of history nihilism to it, a sense of raising another bottle of Moet into the air while the world crumbles and burns around you.” Archie\n-\n“They won’t stop here. The settlers will continue to attack us. I’m more scared now than before,” says Hamdan Ballal, the Oscar-winning Palestinian film director who was violently attacked by Israeli forces and settlers, to Lorenzo Tondo in this powerful interview. Nimo\n-\nAs protests sparked by the arrest of Istanbul mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu convulse cities across Turkey, the journalist and author Ece Temelkuran writes perceptively about the challenge they set opponents of authoritarianism anywhere: “Will the youthful energy of the masses be allowed into the wreckage to transform it into a living organism?” Archie\n-\nAfter numerous angry denials from senior White House officials over the now-infamous Signal group chat, where war plans were inadvertently shared with the Atlantic’s editor-in-chief, the magazine has released much of the remaining information. Peter Beaumont’s analysis explores the fallout. Nimo\n-\nHolding on to grudges can feel strangely satisfying and self-righteous – but it’s ultimately counterproductive. Emine Saner spoke with psychologists about how we can learn to forgive and move forward.

In arguably the Gunners’ finest performance of the season, Alessia Russo led the way with two goals.\nTennis | Emma Raducanu’s encouraging run at the Miami Open came to a difficult end in the quarter-finals on Wednesday night as she went toe-to-toe with Jessica Pegula for two-and-a-half hours before eventually being beaten 6-4, 6-7 (3), 6-2 by one of the best players in the world.\nFormula One | Red Bull are poised to replace Liam Lawson with Yuki Tsunoda after just two races of the Formula One season. Tsunoda would join Max Verstappen for his home grand prix in Japan next week, with Lawson likely returning to the Racing Bulls feeder team.\nThe front pages\nWhat’s that theory – if you’re criticised from all sides, you must be doing something right? “Reeves accused of balancing books at expense of the poor,” says the Guardian, and the Mirror goes with that too: “Balancing the books on the backs of the poor”. The Daily Mail has “Reeves on the ropes” calling the chancellor “Deluded” for sticking to her economic plans. “‘Reckless’ Rachel ‘tanks economy’ by killing growth” – there’s the Express putting itself on first-name terms … “Five years of record taxes” is the Telegraph’s hook while the i goes with “Tax hikes and extra cuts on the way as 250,000 people pushed into poverty by benefits squeeze”. “Anger at Labour’s warfare state” – that’s the Metro, while the Financial Times’ version is “Tax rise fears cloud Reeves’ fiscal fix”.\nToday in Focus\nWeapons vs welfare: Rachel Reeves spring statement\nLabour was gambling on growth, but with stubbornly gloomy forecasts can they cut their way out of an economic hole? Peter Walker reports\nCartoon of the day | Ella Baron\nThe Upside\nA bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad\nAfter losing his father to liver cancer, Ghanaian immunologist Yaw Bediako was driven to understand the disease, realising Africa’s cancer burden was far greater than expected – accounting for about 700,000 deaths every year – and that very few scientific papers about the disease on the continent were available. In 2020, he co-founded Yemaachi Biotech in Accra to build Africa’s largest cancer database, addressing a critical gap in genetic research.\nWith a young, diverse team, the company is creating the African Cancer Atlas, which will aid drug discoveries and treatment research, freely available to African scientists. Less than 2% of human genomes studied so far are African, limiting understanding of cancer treatments for populations in Africa. Bediako hopes to change that, despite challenges in funding and global perceptions. “My dream is one day there will be drugs used to treat cancer around the world that will be derived from knowledge that was generated from this continent – and that shows Africa has something to offer the world,” he says.\nBored at work?\nAnd finally, the Guardian’s puzzles are here to keep you entertained throughout the day.
