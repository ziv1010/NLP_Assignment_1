  "body_text": "“Write your own script, control your destiny.” Those were Chloe Kelly’s words and they defined her unforgettable 2025.\nAs the year comes to a close, we’ve created a breakdown of her incredible 12 months, which saw her rejoin us, go on to claim European success at club and international level and earn plenty of individual plaudits along the way.\nJanuary\nChloe made her homecoming at the end of January. After leaving us for Everton in 2018, in 2025 she returned to us on loan from Manchester City and would go on to represent us for the remainder of the 2024/25 campaign.\nFebruary\nOn February 16, she made her second debut for us in the north London derby, 2,815 days after her previous game for the team. It was a game that we would go on to win 5-0 thanks to goals from Mariona Caldentey, Frida Maanum, Alessia Russo, Emily Fox and a Clare Hunt own goal.\nAfter the game, Chloe said: \"It was absolutely amazing. The fans were incredible. They really showed their support and they were loud. We definitely heard them and it was amazing to step onto this pitch for this amazing club and what a way to do it in the north London derby.\n“This is what dreams are made of, to step out in a full Emirates Stadium. It's incredible.”\nOn February 26, she got her 50th senior cap for the Lionesses in a 1-0 win against Spain at Wembley.\nMarch\nOn March 2, Chloe scored for the first time in her second spell with us in a 4-3 win at home to West Ham United.\nIt was a stunning seven-goal thriller at Meadow Park, where we went 2-0 down inside 12 minutes courtesy of an Amber Tysiak brace, but Chloe reduced the arrears when she turned home a Mariona delivery.\nAfter Shekiera Martinez put West Ham 3-1 up and Katie McCabe pulled another one back for us, Kelly then provided a cross for Leah Williamson to nod home. Mariona added our fourth from the penalty spot.\nMay\nOn May 10, after our 4-3 win over Manchester United, which was our final WSL game of the season, Chloe said: “Time flies when you're having fun and that's exactly what I have done since I stepped foot into the training ground on the first day.\n“We have unfinished business. We're still in the Champions League final and it's one more to go, so I'm really excited for that. Hopefully, we bring some silverware back to the Emirates. Momentum is everything and hopefully we can start fast again and really get going.”\nOn May 24, she won the Women’s Champions League as we added a second European trophy to our honours board, and went on to show off the trophy in front of our supporters outside Emirates Stadium. “I'm absolutely buzzing, what an unbelievable club,” she said after winning the match.\n“I'm grateful for the opportunity this club gave me. I said I came here to win trophies and we did just that. It's history. We got to speak to the girls this week, the ones who won it in 2007, and I think that was so inspiring for us all. And now to do it ourselves, we've written history.”\nJune\nOn June 6, international football beckoned as Chloe was named in England’s squad for UEFA Women’s Euro 2025, as she looked to retain the trophy she helped clinch in 2022 via her winner in the final against Germany.\nJuly\nOn July 2, we signed Chloe again on a permanent basis to ensure she remains a Gunner going forward. “Putting pen to paper on a permanent contract at Arsenal is a standout moment for me”, she said. “Learning from an incredible manager and continuing to build relationships with an excellent team is a journey I’m looking forward to continuing.\n“I’m excited for more silverware at this special club and to bring more trophies back to north London to celebrate with our supporters. I’ve always said that Arsenal supporters are the best and to have them on my side, singing my name, means so much to me.”\nOn July 22, she scored the winning goal in the 119th minute of the Euros semi-final against Italy, and on July 27, Chloe came on in the final and assisted Russo’s goal before scoring the winning penalty. That led to wild celebrations outside Buckingham Palace on July 29.\nAugust\nOn August 9, her homecoming was marked by Queens Park Rangers, as Chloe presented the matchball for a men’s game at Loftus Road.\nSeptember\nOn September 22, Chloe’s amazing achievements saw her come fifth in the Women’s Ballon d’Or.\nIt was a big night for the whole club, with Williamson, Russo and Mariona also finishing in the top 10, while Arsenal Women won Women's Club of the Year and Viktor Gyokeres picked up the Gerd Muller Trophy for his goalscoring exploits.\nOctober\nOn October 3, Chloe scored against her former club in a 3-2 defeat at Manchester City with a lovely curling effort.\nNovember\nOn November 3, Chloe was named in FIFPRO World 11 alongside Williamson and Russo, and on November 11 she won Sportswoman of the Year at the SJA Sports Awards alongside Breakthrough Athlete Michelle Agyemang.\nDecember\nOn December 1, she joined Frimmy for the first time on Colney Carpool!\nOn December 11, Chloe was nominated for BBC Sports Personality of the Year. Agyemang also had something to celebrate, winning the Young Sports Personality of the Year, while Mariona was nominated for World Sport Star.\nCopyright 2026 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
