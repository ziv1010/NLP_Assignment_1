  "body_text": "No going back: World Cup final a tipping point for women’s rugby\nThe 7.59am train from Newcastle to King’s Cross on Saturday was busier than usual. In fact, there was not a seat to be had. Shortly after the train pulled into Darlington, a group of men had to give up their table to a party of Red Roses supporters who had booked their seats. More white-shirted fans piled on at York. Supporters of the England men’s team are well used to cramming themselves like sardines onto the train from Waterloo to Twickenham, but this felt different. It was a day brimming with moments of significance.\nWhen the last World Cup final was staged in England, back in 2010, at the Stoop, Harlequins’ stadium in the shadow of Twickenham, it was a push to attract 13,253 fans to see New Zealand retain their crown. Yet here were supporters making the long and expensive journey south to see if the Red Roses could finally fulfil their destiny, having won 62 of their last 63 matches but having not won the title since 2014.\nThere was so much about the day that was different. Three hours before kick-off, Richmond, normally packed with beer-swilling supporters ahead of a men’s international, was deserted. Instead, 50,000-plus supporters had already made their way to the stadium to see New Zealand win the bronze medal final against France.\nOn their way, some may have noticed a Portakabin in the north car park where the world’s media could pick up their accreditation for the tournament. In 2008, the office for the Rugby Football Union for Women, before the women’s organisation was formally embraced by the RFU, used to be based nearby in a Portakabin just yards away, with those employed not allowed to enter the stadium itself.\nThe vibe was different too, with cowboy hats prevalent and everyone in their seats minutes before kick-off. The build-up felt like a celebration of the women’s game, even though everything was at stake for England.\nMake no mistake. England simply had to win this World Cup. The RFU has made a remarkable financial investment in the women’s game to reach this pinnacle.\nIn 2022, the RFU announced it would invest £222m over the next 10 years to establish the first fully professional women’s club league in the world. The following year, after the disappointment of losing another World Cup final to the Black Ferns, the RFU hired John Mitchell, a heavyweight coach from the international men’s game, as the missing piece of the jigsaw.\nIn the history of the game, the Red Roses went into this final with the highest number of world ranking points of any international side, either men’s or women’s: there was arguably more pressure on Mitchell’s side to deliver than the All Blacks at their home World Cup in 2011 after their successive failures since the inaugural tournament in 1987.\nThe Red Roses faced a Canada side – ranked second in the world – who launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise $1m to top up the backing they had from the union for their tournament preparations.\nA defeat for England was unthinkable, and that is what makes their triumph one to cherish. For all their talk of sticking to “processes”, their players would have been acutely aware of the pressure on their shoulders. And yet despite all the admirable attributes of this Canadian side, the Red Roses possessed too much power, finishing prowess and bloody-minded nerve. Money can buy you a lot of things, but not that.\nThe England side have now won their second Women’s World Cup since the men in 2003, and this triumph promises to be the most significant.\nMeg Jones, England’s magnificent centre, has perhaps best captured the spirit of the last six weeks. “There has been huge momentum again with women’s sport this year and I feel like every week I can’t believe how many people are here,” she said.\n“I hope everyone sees the beautiful game for what I see it as because it gives you so much more than just the game itself.\n“I hope people see that and understand there is more than just a game. We definitely feel that as a group and we know the impact we can have because of everything we have been through not just as individuals but as a collective.\n“Over the years I have seen the impact of each nation wanting to up their game and try to compete with us.”\nThere has to be a word of caution about the future. It took the men’s game more than 100 years before the commercial tipping point forced the administrators to start paying their players and 30 years on it is still struggling to make ends meet.\nThe RFU, in funding a professional game, has raised expectations and in doing so placed financial pressure on other less wealthy unions to match them to ensure the international game remains competitive. Critical decisions about the next stage of the development of the women’s game must still be answered to ensure that it is placed on a sustainable footing.\nBut for the moment they can wait. What is certain is that this tournament has broken all records and brought rugby union to a new audience and hopefully inspired more children and young people to take up the sport. The handling skills and collisions alone made this an utterly compelling spectacle.\nThis was a special and unique moment for the game. There can be no going back.\nRed Roses say win will ‘redefine women’s rugby’\nEngland’s World Cup stars hailed a dream afternoon in front of almost 82,000 fans at Twickenham, proclaiming that their win would “redefine women’s rugby”.\nCanada were beaten 33-13 in the final of a ground-breaking tournament, with the Red Roses scoring five tries in a decider that set an all-time high for a crowd at a women’s match.\nTwo months to the day since the Lionesses retained football’s European trophy, this was a 33rd consecutive win for England and sealed their third World Cup triumph, 11 years after they ousted the same opponents.\nZoe Aldcroft, the Red Roses captain, saluted the wider impact of the result and her side’s success. “It was such an amazing occasion, playing in front of 82,000 people,” she said.\n“That was next level, and I think it was a chance to redefine women’s rugby. We’ve been on this journey ‘for the girls’. It wasn’t just the girls in our circle. It was for the girls we also inspire, the girls that have come before us and everyone who supports us and wants to be part of us as the Red Roses. It was amazing – a dream come true.”\n“[It means] absolutely everything,” added Natasha Hunt, England’s scrum-half. “In 2014 I know Katy [Daley-McLean] did an amazing interview where she spoke about the fact that she wanted to leave a lasting impression and this is just unimaginable.\n“Honestly, to walk out here in front of nearly 82,000 and to perform like that and get the job done – I could not be prouder of the girls. I’m so overwhelmed, I’m absolutely buzzing. I just hope that everyone is here today for women’s rugby.\n“It’s huge [for women’s sport]. I don’t think any of us could have imagined it would ever be like this and I think that’s testament to everyone behind the scenes and what they’ve done and also everyone that keeps showing up and hopefully they’re here to stay.”\nJohn Mitchell, who was named in the aftermath as World Rugby Coach of the Year, began his tenure three years ago in the wake of a gut-wrenching loss to New Zealand in the final of the last World Cup. His strategy had been to disrupt Canada’s free-flowing style and “put them in a rugby contest”.\nHaving set out to bring the Red Roses from good to great, Mitchell believes that goal has been achieved. “This is a phenomenal team,” said the New Zealander. “It’s been good, very good. But we needed to bring closure to what we set out to do three years ago. Greatness is deserved, I think.”",
