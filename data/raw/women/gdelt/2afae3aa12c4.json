It was like a deposit.\n\"Then there is the worry about it breaking down, which it has done in some places. It is 44 years old and almost everything inside has been replaced.\"\nGetting to Hamburg was considerably easier.\nStarting off in Hardenberg in the Netherlands, the bus and 75 other orange vehicles - including VW Beetles and campervans - drove the 190 miles to Hamburg in a colourful convoy.\nBy Friday night there were pockets of Netherlands supporters all around Hamburg, but on Sunday morning at 08:30 they gathered at the city's fan zone in their thousands.\nThere they danced along as Dutch DJ Armin van Buuren blasted out a catalogue of his greatest hits before they made their way to one of the main roads close by to prepare for their famed fan walk to the ground.\nI joined them for this, walking alongside fans dressed as their favourite players, some wearing bright orange suits and top hats, others giant lion costumes and some carrying large stuffed lions on their shoulders.\nSlowly, tens of thousands of supporters then started making their way through the streets of Hamburg, out of the city centre and towards Volksparkstadion.\nLocal families, perhaps popping out for a quiet Sunday morning breakfast, could not help but stop and stare, before smiling and taking photos of the joyous scene.\nI walked alongside a Dutch lady wearing a cheese wheel as a hat. She has been pictured at tournaments featuring the Netherlands men's and women's teams for decades.\n\"I don't remember but it's a lot,\" she said when I asked how many of these fan parades she has participated in.\nAt the other end of the scale Danny was taking part in it for the first time.\n\"It is great,\" he said. \"It shows unity. Even though it is really early it is already a great party.\"\nNo matter the tournament or where in the world it is, the Dutch are always guaranteed to get the party started.\nAllow X content?\nThis article contains content provided by X.
