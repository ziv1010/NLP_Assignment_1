  "body_text": "Nigerian striker Joy Omewa has met the minimum points requirement to obtain a Governing Body Endorsement to play in the English Women’s Super League, PUNCH Sports Extra reports.\nDespite not qualifying for an automatic pass, reserved for players who have featured in at least 80 per cent of Nigeria’s matches over the past one to two years, Omewa has accumulated the necessary 24 points through her club and continental performances.\nThe GBE system, designed to regulate the transfer of foreign players into the WSL, assigns points based on league quality, international appearances, continental competition, club performance, and continental progression.\nOmewa secured 12 points from playing in Denmark’s Fortuna Hjorring, a Band 1 league in the system, where she appeared in 90–100 per cent of her team’s matches.\nShe earned two points from featuring in the UEFA Europa League, having played nearly every minute, and 10 points for helping Fortuna Hjorring win the domestic league last season, bringing her total to the exact threshold required to qualify.\nOmewa’s eligibility comes as English topflight sides Brighton, West Ham, and Aston Villa reportedly line up to sign her during the January transfer window.\nAccording to Soccerdonna, the women’s football equivalent of Transfermarkt, all three clubs are eager to strengthen their attacking line-up with the 22-year-old forward.\n“Joy Omewa has attracted attention from the WSL, with West Ham, Brighton and Aston Villa wanting to sign her during the winter transfer window,” Soccerdonna reported.\n“The three clubs are understood to be keen to bolster their attacking options with the 22-year-old forward.”\nThe Nigerian striker has been in exceptional form for Fortuna Hjorring this season, scoring 13 goals in 14 league appearances and helping her team sit second in the A-Liga behind HB Koge.\nShe has also netted three goals in the Women’s Champions League before elimination by St. Polten and followed that with four goals in four UEFA Women’s Europa Cup matches. Last season, she scored 25 goals across competitions to help Fortuna Hjorring secure a domestic and cup double, finishing as the league’s top scorer and being named Player of the Season.\nHer prolific record would provide a significant boost to any of the three interested WSL sides. Aston Villa and Arsenal have struggled to convert chances this season, drawing four matches and missing numerous opportunities, while Brighton face attacking shortages following Michelle Agyemang’s season-ending ACL injury. West Ham have scored just six goals in nine WSL games, sitting second from bottom with only one win.\nOmewa’s anticipated move highlights the growing demand for Nigerian talent in the WSL, which already includes Chiamaka Nnadozie at Brighton, Tony Payne at Everton and Rofiat Imuran at London City Lionesses.\nOmewa hits WSL eligibility status\nAll rights reserved.
