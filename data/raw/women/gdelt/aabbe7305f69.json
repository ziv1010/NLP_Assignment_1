  "body_text": "In our latest Michigan Wolverines news roundup, Caleb Love won’t be playing for Michigan basketball, a Schembechler has returned to Michigan football and more.\nIt’s been a rough offseason but Michigan basketball fans were feeling better about their team due to some transfer portal additions, namely Caleb Love before the news broke that Love, the former North Carolina Tar Heel won’t be joining the Michigan Wolverines after all.\nIt’s a huge blow to Juwan Howard and Michigan basketball. Love wasn’t the perfect player but he can be a dynamic scorer and had first-round ability.\nAt the very least, Love is a go-to guy and now, Michigan basketball doesn’t have a single player that averaged in double figures a year ago on the entire roster.\nOf course, we should have known that admissions was going to get in the way as it did with Terrance Shannon last offseason. What’s worse is that Nimari Burnett and Tray Jackson haven’t been announced either.\nIt sounds like Love could have done some more school work to get admitted, but the transfer policies are ridiculous and exceptions need to be made for athletes.\nWhen President Santa Ono was hired, he said he wanted the Michigan Wolverines to be the leaders and best in everything, including athletics.\nSo far, he’s done basically nothing to back up the excitement around his hire. The Michigan Wolverines lost an elite baseball coach because the athletic department wouldn’t give Erik Bakich the resources to compete and the same thing is happening to Juwan Howard.\nAs it stands right now, Michigan basketball is in a terrible position. It has three open scholarships and desperately needs proven scorers.\nHopefully, Juwan can work some magic, but this Michigan basketball job is made much harder by the University and that’s just sad.\nShemy Schembechler is hired by Michigan football\nJim Harbaugh hired a familiar face to the Michigan football staff as the son of former head coach Bo Schembechler, Shemy, has been announced as part of the Michigan Wolverines recruiting staff following a 20-year career in the NFL working in different scouting departments.\nSchembechler is going to work in the recruiting department and I’m sure a big part of his job is going to be evaluating players. Michigan football has been exceptional in that area — just look at the NFL draft — nine guys were drafted and only one was a four-star ranked in the top 300.\nThat means Michigan football knows how to identify players and develop them. Schembecher should help with that.\nMore Michigan Wolverines news\n- The Michigan Wolverines were eliminated by Georgia in the NCAA women’s tennis quarterfinals as UGA knocked off U-M by a score of 4-0. The men’s tennis team will face TCU on Thursday also with a chance to advance to the national semifinals.\n- Also on Thursday, Michigan baseball will take on Ohio State in the first of three games to end the regular season. Michigan is 13-8 in the Big Ten and tied for fourth place. The Michigan Wolverines and Buckeyes will have the first pitch go out at 6 PM EST.\n- Finally, Ohio State appears to have pulled ahead in a big way for Michigan football target Aaron Scott. The four-star corner is now trending with predictions for the Buckeyes.",
