Their study centers around the genetic variant of the manganese transporter SLC39A8, which affects manganese levels in the body. People with a genetic variant in SLC39A8, or ZIP8, can have manganese deficiency, which this and prior studies have linked to inflammatory diseases of the intestines such as Crohn's and colitis. \"Our research reveals the crucial role of the manganese transporter SLC39A8 in maintaining healthy manganese levels and intestinal health. Our work also... -\nWhy Now? Election Watchdog Criticizes GOP Fear Mongering About Noncitizen Voting\nWhat’s happening in Ohio. A bit closer to home, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is working in the same vein. He’s recently urged state lawmakers to impose similar proof-of-citizenship requirements at the state level following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing an Arizona law to remain in place. And Wednesday he called on Congress to support his efforts to find alleged noncitizens on the voter rolls. Earlier this week he referred old cases to the Attorney General. Since taking office, LaRose stated in a press release, his office has sent more than 600 incidents of alleged election fraud to... -\nALMOST UNTHINKABLE: Marjorie Taylor Greene Accuses Andrew Cuomo Of Murder To His Face\nAt today's House Select Committee on the Coronavirus hearing, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) questioned former Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) about his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. -\nBuried news: Hamas digging tunnels under San Diego -IDF colonel\nDoes San Diego, California have a 'Hamas' problem? No, not the ignorant student protestors at universities being directed by Hamas's proxies. No, not the terrorists rolling into the area from Joe Biden's and Kamala Harris's open border. They may be seeing actual tunnels, dug by Hamas itself or its clients the Mexican cartels, coming in through Mexico. The U.S. Border Patrol has discovered more than 200 of them since 2003, according to the Department of Customs & Border Protection. The most recent one found, that there's any news on, at least, was a 2022 Tijuana-to-San Diego tunnel , complete with... -\nWes Allen’s voter purge program targeted Alabama’s naturalized citizens, lawsuit claims\nA longtime state resident born in Florida and naturalized citizens are among the victims of Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen’s effort to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls, according to a lawsuit they and others filed Friday in federal court in Birmingham. Allen announced last month that 3,251 registered voters were issued noncitizen identification numbers, prompting him to tell boards of registrars in Alabama’s 67 counties to immediately take steps to remove any non-citizens from the voting rolls. It is illegal for people who are not citizens to register to vote in Alabama. A federal law enacted in 1996... -\nInsulin resistance is linked to over 30 diseases—and to early death in women, finds UK study\nInsulin resistance is associated with 31 different diseases, and in women, is also linked to higher odds of early death. This is according to a study of data on hundreds of thousands of people. There is compelling evidence of links between insulin resistance and conditions as diverse as Parkinson's disease, gout and sciatica. Insulin resistance is also a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. To find out more, Ms. Jing Wu and colleagues analyzed data from the UK Biobank. The study involved 429,159 participants. Levels of blood sugar and fats, including cholesterol, were used to calculate each participant's TyG index—a measure... -\nNLRB Orders Starbucks to Reopen Two Closed Ithaca Locations\nNational Labor Relations Board Administrative Law Judge Geoffrey Carter ordered Starbucks to reopen “within a reasonable period of time” two Ithaca locations that closed after employees formed a union, stating that its move to “chill unionism” violated the National Labor Relations Act. Carter ruled on Friday that the May 2023 permanent closures of the Ithaca Commons and Meadow Street Starbucks locations and failure to bargain with the union were unlawful, as the board found the stores were closed for “antiunion reasons” and in an effort to quell unionizations elsewhere. The NLRB similarly ordered on July 6, 2023, that the third... -\n[Catholic Caucus] APOSTOLIC JOURNEY - Agreement between China and the Holy See on the appointment of Bishops, the Pope: \"Good result, I am happy\"\n[Catholic Caucus] APOSTOLIC JOURNEY - Agreement between China and the Holy See on the appointment of Bishops, the Pope: \"Good result, I am happy\"Vatican City (Agenzia Fides) - \"The result\" of the agreement between China and the Holy See on the appointment of bishops \"is good, I am happy.\" This is what Pope Francis said during the usual press conference on the plane on his return flight from Singapore, the last stop of his long Apostolic Journey to Asia and Oceania.Responding to the question on the agreement posed by the journalist Stefania Falasca for the Chinese online newspaper Tianou Zhiku,... -\nAstronomy Picture of the Day - The Moona Lisa\nExplanation: Only natural colors of the Moon in planet Earth's sky appear in this creative visual presentation. Arranged as pixels in a framed image, the lunar disks were photographed at different times. Their varying hues are ultimately due to reflected sunlight affected by changing atmospheric conditions and the alignment geometry of Moon, Earth, and Sun. Here, the darkest lunar disks are the colors of earthshine. A description of earthshine, in terms of sunlight reflected by Earth's oceans illuminating the Moon's dark surface, was written over 500 years ago by Leonardo da Vinci. But stand farther back from your screen or... -\nDavid Muir of ABC Committed A Freudian Slip and Major Faux Pas When He Asked Kamala Harris The First Question During The Debate. Did Anyone Else Catch It?\nMuir's first question to Harris began as follows: Vice President Harris, you and President Trump were elected four years ago....\"Oh, really? After that one, the remainder of Muir's question made no sense at all. I would have thought Trump would have jumped on Muir's gaffe immediately and corrected it--\"You meant Crooked Joe Biden, right? (snicker)\". He didn't. So Muir's \"Freudian slip\" revising the winning ticket of the 2020 election didn't get called out. Not by anyone. I'll leave it to the collective Free Republic imagination as to just what Ronald Reagan would have done to Muir with that one. -\nMissouri woman indicted in attempted Graceland foreclosure sale, records show\nA Missouri woman accused of trying to defraud Elvis Presley's family through an attempted foreclosure sale of Graceland has been federally indicted, records show. Court documents show that Lisa Jeanine Findley was indicted on charges of mail fraud and identity theft. Her arrest warrant alleges that she used aliases and email addresses to create a fake company called \"Naussany Investments\" in an effort to facilitate the fraudulent sale of the famous Memphis landmark in May. Court records allege that Findley claimed Lisa Marie Presley, Elvis' daughter, borrowed $3.8 million from the fake firm and pledged Graceland as collateral. The arrest... -\nMigrant tent city in Brooklyn will stay another year as feds extend lease for controversial encampment\nThe controversial migrant encampment at Brooklyn’s Floyd Bennett Field will remain for another year, The Post has learned. The National Parks Service, which oversees the historic former airfield off Flatbush Avenue, notified city officials Friday it has agreed to the Adams administration’s request for a lease extension to continue operating the 2,000-bed tent city. The original lease was set to expire Saturday. “This extension request was thoroughly reviewed and responds to the State of New York’s continued emergency declaration,” wrote Jennifer T. Nersesian, superintendent of Gateway National Recreation Area, a part of the National Park Service. “As stewards of this... -\nFamed ‘Concussion’ Dr. Bennet Omalu begs again for Tua Tagovailoa to retire\nBennet Omalu, the neuropathologist who has been credited with finding chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in ex-football players, is once again calling on Tua Tagovailoa to step away from the game. Omalu told TMZ Sports that the Dolphins quarterback, who suffered his third known concussion on “Thursday Night Football” against the Bills this week, could become “permanently incapacitated” if he does any more damage to his brain. The doctor, who was portrayed by Will Smith in the 2015 film “Concussion” on his life and work, urged Tagovailoa to retire from the NFL for the second time in less than two years. -\nCalifornia pair convicted in Chinese birth tourism scheme\nA jury on Friday convicted a Southern California couple of running a business that helped pregnant Chinese women travel to the United States without revealing their intentions to give birth to babies who would automatically have American citizenship. -\nMissouri Judge Rules Radical Amendment for Abortions Up to Birth Violates State Law\nOn September 6, a Cole County, Missouri Circuit Court judge ruled against Missouri’s proposed Amendment 3, also known as the “Right to Reproductive Freedom Initiative.” In the judgment released late Friday, the judge found that Missourians for Constitutional Freedom and Dr. Anna Fitz-James, who are leading the campaign effort to pass Amendment 3, ran afoul of state law. The judgment follows a lawsuit against Amendment 3 filed on August 22, 2024, by Thomas More Society attorneys, and rules favorably on the allegation that the Amendment 3 initiative petition violated state law by failing to provide voters with a list of... -\nJudge Overturns North Dakota Abortion Ban That Protects Babies\nA state judge in North Dakota has issued a ruling overturning the state’s abortion ban that protects the lives of unborn children. Although no abortion centers operate in the state, the ruling makes abortion legal for the time being while the case continues. “Pregnant women have a fundamental right to choose abortion before viability exists,” North Dakota District Judge Bruce Romanick wrote, even though the Supreme Court ruled no such right exists. The Center for Reproductive Rights filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Red River Women’s Clinic, arguing that North Dakota’s SB 2150 was so vague that it put... -\nInflux of wild-driving Haitian migrants turning streets of Springfield, Ohio, into combat zone: ‘Eight to 10 accidents a day here’\nSPRINGFIELD, Ohio — Forget about the ducks and geese allegedly disappearing from public parks. In this beleaguered city, residents say the biggest problem by far is that wild-driving Haitian migrants — unfamiliar with US road laws — are turning the streets into combat zones. And the results can be deadly. The family of Springfield grandma Kathy Heaton experienced this firsthand on Dec. 1 — a day after her 71st birthday — when a Haitian migrant ran her down while she was collecting her garbage cans. And the driver got off scot-free. -\nIndiana judge denies Planned Parenthood’s request to expand abortion\nA special judge in Monroe County, Indiana, has denied a request by Planned Parenthood to broaden the medical exceptions under which abortions would be allowed under state law. Indiana’s abortion law, SB 1, protects nearly all preborn children in the state from abortion. Abortion is only permitted in cases of rape and incest, if there is a “lethal fetal anomaly” before 20 weeks, and when “abortion is necessary when reasonable medical judgment dictates that performing the abortion is necessary to prevent any serious health risk to the pregnant woman or to save the pregnant woman’s life.” The law also requires... -\nScooby-Doo Turns 55! See the Actors Who Have Played the Scooby Gang Members Through the Years\nThere’s no mystery when it comes to the enduring popularity of the Scooby-Doo characters. The children’s mystery franchise, which turns 55 on Sept. 13, 2024, introduced the world to the Scooby Gang — comprised of the charming Fred Jones, fashionable Daphne Blake, studious Velma Dinkley, quirky Shaggy Rogers and the eponymous mascot, Scooby-Doo. Also known as Mystery Inc. and the Mystery Gang, the five characters have stood the test of time across dozens of TV films, series and video games. Fred, Daphne, Velma and Shaggy have been played by several actors each as the franchise has launched animated series and... -\nCan coffee be the secret to slow down ageing and face wrinkles? Here’s what a new study says\nIf you are worried about fine lines and wrinkles appearing on your face with some loosening of the skin, then you might just want to increase your daily coffee quota. A study published in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology says that drinking three to five cups of coffee daily slowed down ageing of facial skin. Research says polyphenols (compounds that are antioxidant and anti-inflammatory) present in roasted coffee may improve skin elasticity and hydration, delaying wrinkles and other signs of ageing. According to Dr DM Mahajan, senior dermatologist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi, freshly brewed black coffee has the...\nBrowse by Forum\nGet Connected!
