Our target is to lift the trophy and bring it back to Rivers State, having lost the opportunity to win the league. As a team, we are indebted to the Rivers State government for bringing back the trophy. That is the only way we can show appreciation for the government’s huge investment in the team.”\nNational women’s U-17 coach, Bankole Olowokeere, who is in charge of Naija Ratels admits his side are underdogs in the contest but believes the Abuja club will make history in Lagos.\n“For sure, we are the distinct underdogs against Rivers Angels that have won this trophy eight times before now. But no team is unbeatable. We have a plan and a strategy to emerge champions on Saturday. We want to do this for our proprietor and for our supporters who have been with us through victory and defeat, through thick and thin. I can assure you that Naija Ratels are determined to make history.”\nAside from the title, the men’s final has more to offer – a CAF Confederation Cup ticket.\nAfter overcoming a somewhat difficult season in the league, Abia Warriors were the first team to arrive in Lagos ahead of the final.\nBeating Kano Pillars on penalties in the semi-finals has boosted Abia Warriors’ image as favourites for the title and the last continental ticket against two-time champions El-Kanemi Warriors who also needed penalties to beat Kebbi United in the other semi-final.\nAbia Warriors coach Bethel Orji has no doubt that the Umuahia side will come good in the final.\n“We are here and we’re highly motivated. We are all elated. I thank God for the turnaround in the fortunes of the team, and I am delighted to be playing my first Cup final as a coach,” Orji told thenff.com in Lagos on Wednesday.\nEl-Kanemi Warriors aren’t lacking motivation as well, having just secured promotion back to the NPFL after a season in the second division.\n“I commend the players for not only ensuring promotion back to the top flight but also reaching the President Federation Cup final. Yet, it is not over until it is over. We are here and we are determined to wrest the title,” El-Kanemi coach Aliyu Zubairu said.\nThe last time Lagos hosted the final of the oldest competition in the country was in 2017 at the Agege Township Stadium.",
