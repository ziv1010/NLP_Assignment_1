  "body_text": "Manchester United Women have made history this season.\nRecord-breaking women\nOn Thursday, they officially qualified for the Champions League knockout phase for the first time in their brief history since 2018.\nThe Red Devils have made massive strides over the years but this momentum is in danger of being lost.\nUnited started the season in fine form, picking up draws with Arsenal and Chelsea and winning the other five.\nThey also managed to win their opening three Champions League ties against Valerenga, Atletico Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain.\nNonetheless, their season has begun to unravel a little with consecutive Premier League defeats to Aston Villa and Manchester City.\nThey were also soundly beaten 2-5 by Wolfsburg midweek in Germany.\nOf course it is impossible to play well and continue winning throughout the season, every team has these moments. Nonetheless, United’s problem is deeper. The fact of the matter is they do not have the squad depth to compete at the top levels of both Europe and the league.\nMarc Skinner knows this\nAfter the defeat to Manchester City last weekend, Skinner lamented the series of games his side were on.\nHe spoke of the importance of using the January window to recruit players who can help them take the next step.\nTalented squad but cannot absorb big losses\nOver the years, United have built a strong team with many outstanding talents.\nNonetheless, the loss of Phallon Tullis-Joyce has significantly weakened the team with United conceding nine goals in their three games without her.\nFor context, they conceded just seven in their first 11 matches.\nWhat’s more, an injury to the likes of Jess Park, Melvine Malard or Maya Le Tissier would be unthinkable and could derail the whole season.\nCompetition\nIf United are looking to be in and around the European spots and perhaps grab a cup win, they invest enough.\nNonetheless, to take the next step, they have to start spending like their competition. Chelsea spend massively in comparison to their rivals but gain success, winning seven out of the last eight WSL titles.\nThey have not won the Champions League, but they will just keep spending until they finally find the formula for European success.\nArsenal and FC Barcelona are also examples of teams who invest heavily in their women’s team and it is no surprise it was these two who competed in the Champions League final last season.\nMoreover, with a rejuvenated Manchester City this season, there is a strong chance United could miss out on Champions League football next season, even if they are currently sitting in third spot in the league.\nUnited have good scouts\nClearly, United can invest well. Jess Park has been a revelation since signing for the club and has already consolidated herself as one of the team’s most important players.\nFridolina Rolfo has also been very impressive, scoring two goals in the Champions League and showing her talent on the biggest stage. Julia Olme has also been a smart addition, adding composure and steel to the centre of the park.\nCrucially Olme and Rolfo were both free transfers and Park was a swap deal involving Grace Clinton going the other way.\nThe argument is, if United can identify three players like this on a free, imagine what the scouts could do with serious finances to spend.\nThe Red Devils have proven they can compete with anyone on their day against the likes of Chelsea and Arsenal.\nNonetheless, if they are to truly capitalise on this squad’s amazing potential, they need a helping hand or two in the January window.\nMan United Women summer signings\nFeatured image Molly Darlington via Getty Images\n–\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade.
