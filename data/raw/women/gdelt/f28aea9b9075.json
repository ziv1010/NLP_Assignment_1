We are hopeful that these activations will bring the communities closer to the FA Cup while at the same time giving us the opportunity to support community football,\" he stressed.\nHe said these community game centres would promote discussions, create networking opportunities, and serve as a business arena.\n\"We want to use the games to drive progress in our communities. On match days, there would be Fan Zones at the various stadia. Fans will have the opportunity to engage in activities such as Target Shooting and Wheel of Fortune to win prizes,\" he said.\nHe said, the 2023/2024 season of the MTN FA Cup promises to be exciting and anticipating spectacular skills and brilliant moments.\nAt the end of the draw defending champions Dreams FC would face off with lower tier side Soccer Intellectuals while Bofoakwa Tano would battle it out with Skyy FC for a place in the semi-finals of the competition.\nIt would be a premier league teams affair as last year's semi-finalist Nsoatreman FC squares off with Karela United in a very exciting fixture while Legon Cities and Bechem Utd would fight for a place in the next round.\nThe games would be played between March 29 and April 1.\nThe Chairman of the MTN FA Cup Committee, Mr Wilson Arthur said the competition level was very high despite the elimination of top clubs including Accra Hearts of Oak and Kumasi Asante Kotoko.\nHe said, organisers were looking forward to an exciting round and urged families especially ladies and children to visit the venues for quality time.\nLatest Stories\n-\n‘I wanted to be an architect but ended up as a nurse’ – Diana Hamilton reveals\n48 minutes -\nFrom wards to worship: Diana Hamilton reveals how nursing school shaped her destiny\n1 hour -\nMahama demands binding deadlines for African reparations\n2 hours -\nThis is not the time to settle political scores – Bawumia to government\n3 hours -\n5 definitive Valentine’s Day gifts to win your lover’s heart in Ghana\n3 hours -\n37% of SHS students exposed to drugs – Opare-Addo\n3 hours -\nNLC secures court injunction against striking tertiary unions\n4 hours -\nOSP says it remains guided by law after INTERPOL deletes Ofori-Atta’s Red Notice\n4 hours -\nWaiting in the Ring: life inside Bukom’s halted boxing scene\n4 hours -\nRed Notice cancellation: OSP official fires back at Ofori-Atta’s lawyers\n5 hours -\nOfori-Atta saga: Red Notice ends after arrest – OSP official clarifies\n5 hours -\nAAG raises alarm over billboard demolitions, calls for presidential intervention\n6 hours -\nHealth Minister to chair probe into ‘No Bed Syndrome’ death; promises system overhaul\n6 hours -\nPrime Insight to tackle ‘galamsey tax’ debate, cocoa reforms and Ayawaso East fallout this Saturday\n6 hours -\nCocoa crisis, galamsey complicity and election credibility to dominate this Saturday’s Newsfile\n7 hours",
