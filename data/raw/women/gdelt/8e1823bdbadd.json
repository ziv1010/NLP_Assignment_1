  "body_text": "Super Falcons goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie has been shortlisted for the 2025 International Federation of Football History and Statistics Women’s World Best Goalkeeper award, joining an elite list of ten nominees announced by the global football body, PUNCH Sports Extra reports.\nNnadozie, who currently plays for Brighton & Hove Albion in the Women’s Super League, is the only African among the nominees for the prestigious honour.\nShe faces stiff competition from some of the world’s best, including Germany’s Ann-Katrin Berger (Gotham FC), Spain’s Cata Coll (Barcelona), England’s Hannah Hampton (Chelsea), and Chile’s Christiane Endler (Lyon).\nOther goalkeepers in contention are Daphne van Domselaar (Netherlands/Arsenal), Katharine Tapia (Colombia/Palmeiras), Lorena Leite (Brazil/Kansas Current), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (USA/Manchester United), and Jennifer Falk (Sweden/Häcken).\nThe IFFHS awards, established in 1987, recognise the best performers across various football categories annually, based on votes from journalists and football experts in over 120 countries.\nThe results for the 2025 edition will be announced in December, with official rankings for goalkeepers, players, referees, and coaches to follow.\nNnadozie’s nomination comes at the end of an exceptional year for the 24-year-old. Since joining Brighton, she has become one of the standout goalkeepers in the WSL, earning multiple accolades and nominations for her performances.\nShe was nominated for the October Barclays WSL Save of the Month on Monday following her remarkable stop from Tottenham midfielder Eveliina Summanen’s free-kick in Brighton’s narrow defeat.\nHer consistent displays between the sticks have also seen her claim the Best Goalkeeper award at the 2025 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations, where she played a key role in Nigeria’s campaign.\nShe became the first Nigerian and African goalkeeper to be nominated for the Women’s Yachine Trophy, awarded to the world’s best female goalkeeper, finishing fourth in September.\nNnadozie has also been shortlisted for the CAF Women’s Goalkeeper of the Year award, which she is tipped to win for a record third consecutive time, further cementing her status as one of Africa’s most accomplished footballers.\nShould she win the IFFHS World Best Goalkeeper award, Nnadozie would become the first African woman to receive the honour, which will mark another milestone in her fast-rising international career.",
