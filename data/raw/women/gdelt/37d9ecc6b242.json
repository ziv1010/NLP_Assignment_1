He observed that in earlier times, individuals were able to secure good jobs despite limited education, but modern-day competition in every field, including sports, has become much tougher.\nHe urged the youth to give their full focus to any profession, whether in studies or sports, stating that partial efforts cannot match the dedication of others giving their 100 percent. He added that athletes underperform due to over-participation in multiple events and highlighted issues of dependency and indiscipline among Nagas, emphasizing that discipline must come from within.
