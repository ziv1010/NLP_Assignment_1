It hurts me a bit. More than hurting me, it makes me sad. I’m a player that no one can criticise, I’m always available, I always give my best…\n“I don’t see it as a matter of money. Financially I can’t complain, although the difference with Saudi Arabia is massive.”\nWiegman named coach of the year\n“It’s an honour to receive this award again.” 💬\nSarina Wiegman receives her fifth The Best @FIFAcom Women’s Coach award. pic.twitter.com/RqlpMBs6WK\n— Lionesses (@Lionesses) December 16, 2025\nEngland boss Sarina Wiegman was been named women’s coach of the year at The Best FIFA Football Awards for the fifth time after leading the Lionesses to Euro 2025 success.\nThe 56-year-old saw off competition from Chelsea’s Sonia Bompastor, Arsenal’s Renee Slegers, Seb Hines of Orlando Pride and Lyon’s Jonatan Giraldez to take the prize at a ceremony in Doha.\nWiegman, who was not in attendance to pick up the award in person, said in a pre-recorded video: “Thank you so much, it is an absolute honour to receive this award again.\n“This award is for players and staff. We have shown so much conviction, belief and togetherness which led us to our second Euros win.”\nWhat’s on today?\nManchester City host Brentford in the Carabao Cup quarter-final whilst Fulham go to Newcastle.\nIn Scottish Premiership, Celtic host Dundee United.\nChelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal all face tough away games in the Women’s Champions League.",
