  "body_text": "'We're happy' - Beth Mead credits Renee Slegers for Arsenal's improved form\n- Arsenal are in UWCL action against Juventus on Tuesday evening\n- The Gunners go into the game in good form after Friday’s' win against Brighton\n- Beth Mead was on the scoresheet in their last WSL outing\nArsenal star Beth Mead has credited interim manager Renee Slegers for a recent upturn in form, explaining the team are heading in the right direction under her leadership.\nIt has been a turbulent few weeks for the Gunners after Jonas Eidevall resigned as manager following a home defeat to Chelsea. Under Slegers, the team are unbeaten in four games across all competitions, dropping WSL points just once in a draw they dominated against Manchester United.\nLast time out, Arsenal comfortably beat Brighton & Hove Albion 5-0, which is a significant result given the Seagulls remain above them in the WSL standings. But the Gunners have started to close the gap on their rivals, and Mead insists former assistant Slegers has taken to the role \"like a duck to water\".\n\"We've worked really hard alongside Renee in training and stuff,\" Mead explained ahead of the team's Champions League group stage clash with Juventus. \"We've really tried to hone in on small things that we're not quite getting right in front of goal at the moment.\n\"Sometimes small details can win you games and ultimately that's probably what we did on Friday night. We've obviously worked with Renee for quite a while now in different roles to the ones she's in now but she's taken to it like a duck to water.\n\"It's been an easy transition for us as a group. We know what she gives us and the confidence she gives us.\n\"We're playing good football, so I think as individuals and as a collective we're happy with what Renee is doing for us right now. She deserves the credit for making us feel good and the performances that are coming on the pitch.\"\nOne of the big positives for Arsenal in recent weeks has been the mood within the squad. There's been a growing sense of togetherness and that's a sentiment echoed by Mead.\nAgainst Brighton, there were five different goalscorers, including Mead. A further two players contributed with assists and they are now just seven points behind league leaders Manchester City.\n\"I think we're just in a good place at the moment,\" Mead concluded. \"We're building in the right direction. We've got a good foundation to build from. It's just a release of new energy right now and when you get the results and the performances, it always makes you a happier footballer.\n\"Myself, individually, I felt that. I can't speak for the whole team, but I know that we feel like we're all in a good place. We're all looking after each other. We knew, obviously, it was a tough period with the transition of how things have gone, so we've stuck together.\n\"It's the new energy that the girls have brought. It's just showing on the pitch right now. And we were so close to doing that before, but we just weren't quite clicking at that point. But it was nice to get that feeling for most of the game on Friday.\n\"I won't say we were perfect on Friday, but for most of the game, it felt that.\"",
